The question considered here is whether <b>antisense</b> <b>DNAs</b> will also be important to future nuclear medicine imaging. While efforts toward developing antisense imaging are comparatively nonexistent thus far, investigations into the mechanisms of cellular transport and localization {{and the development of a}} second generation of <b>antisense</b> <b>DNAs</b> have occurred largely within the antisense chemotherapy industry. Fortunately, many of the properties of <b>DNA</b> for <b>antisense</b> imaging, such as high in vivo stability and adequate cell membrane transport, are the same as those for antisense chemotherapy. Unfortunately, interests diverge in the case of several other key properties. For example, rapid localization and clearance kinetics of the radiolabel and prolonged retention in the target are requirements unique to nuclear medicine. No doubt the development of antisense imaging will continue to benefit from improvements in the antisense chemotherapy industry. However, a considerable effort will be required to optimize this approach for imaging (and radiotherapy).

Using <b>DNA</b> microarrays, we have conducted a systematic characterization of gene expression in cells exposed to antisense, either exogenously or endogenously.

40|$|One of the {{problems}} that hamper the use of <b>antisense</b> <b>DNAs</b> as effective drugs is the non-specific binding of chemically-modified oligonucleotides to cellular proteins. We previously showed that the affinity of a model ssDNA-binding protein, the Ff gene 5 protein (g 5 p), was > 300 -fold higher for phosphorothioate-modified DNA (S-DNA) than for unmodified dA 36, consistent with the propensity of S-DNA to bind indiscriminately to proteins. The current work shows that g 5 p binding is also sensitive to sugar and pyrimidine modifications used in antisense oligomers. Binding affinities of g 5 p for 10 36 mer oligomers were quantitated using solution circular dichroism measurements. The oligomers contained C- 5 -propyne (prC), 2 ′-O-methyl (2 ′-O-Me) or 2 ′-OH (RNA) groups, alone or combined with the phosphorothioate modification. In agreement with reported increases in antisense activity, the addition of prC or 2 ′-O-Me modifications substantially reduced the affinity of oligomers for g 5 p by ∼ 2 -fold compared with the same DNA oligomer sequences containing only phosphorothioate linkages. That is, such modifications moderated the propensity of the phosphorothioate group to bind tightly to the g 5 p.

In several publications the selectivity and duplex forming were reported. The strong growth of HIV-infections in those days, commercial interests and patent rights led to the decision to cooperate with the virologist Jaap Goudsmit of the Academic Medical Center of Amsterdam University.

5000|$|UBE3A-ATS/Ube3a-ATS (human/mouse), {{otherwise}} known as ubiquitin ligase E3A-ATS, is the name for the <b>antisense</b> <b>DNA</b> strand that is transcribed {{as part of a}} larger transcript called LNCAT (large non-coding antisense transcript) at the Ube3a locus. The Ube3a locus is imprinted and in the central nervous system expressed only from the maternal allele. Silencing of Ube3a on the paternal allele is thought to occur through the Ube3a-ATS part of LNCAT, since non-coding antisense transcripts are often found at imprinted loci. [...] The deletion and/or mutation of Ube3a on the maternal chromosome causes Angelman Syndrome (AS) and Ube3a-ATS may prove to be an important aspect in finding a therapy for this disease. While in patients with AS the maternal Ube3a allele is inactive, the paternal allele is intact but epigenetically silenced. If unsilenced, the paternal allele could be a source of active Ube3a protein in AS patients. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of how Ube3a-ATS might be involved in silencing the paternal Ube3a may lead to new therapies for AS. This possibility has been demonstrated by a recent study where the drug topotecan, administered to mice suffering from AS, activated expression of the paternal Ube3a gene by lowering the transcription of Ube3a-ATS.|$|E

Both <b>antisense</b> RNA and <b>DNA</b> against CA II and the V-ATPase were used to compare their specificities as regards inhibiting bone resorption in vitro.

5000|$|The two {{complementary}} {{strands of}} double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) are usually differentiated as the [...] "sense" [...] strand and the [...] "antisense" [...] strand. The DNA sense strand {{looks like the}} messenger RNA (mRNA) {{and can be used}} to read the expected protein code; for example, ATG in the sense DNA may correspond to an AUG codon in the mRNA, encoding the amino acid methionine. However, the DNA sense strand itself is not used to make protein by the cell. It is the <b>DNA</b> <b>antisense</b> strand which serves as the source for the protein code, because, with bases complementary to the DNA sense strand, it is used as a template for the mRNA.

The mRNA is what is used for translation (protein synthesis).Hence, a base triplet 3'-TAC-5' in the <b>DNA</b> <b>antisense</b> strand {{can be used as a}} template which will result in an 5'-AUG-3' base triplet in mRNA (AUG is the codon for methionine, the start codon).

Recently, Conde et al. {{developed}} a nanomaterial platform based on gold nanobeacons to detect, target and inhibit the expression of a mutant Kras gene in an in vivo murine gastric cancer model. The conjugation of fluorescently-labeled <b>antisense</b> <b>DNA</b> hairpin oligonucleotides to the surface of gold nanoparticles enables using their localized surface plasmon resonance properties to directly track the delivery to the primary gastric tumor and to lung metastatic sites. The fluorescently labeled nanobeacons reports on the interaction with the target as the fluorescent Cy3 signal is quenched by the gold nanoparticle and only emit light following conjugation to the Kras target owing to reorganization and opening of the nanobeacons, thus increasing the distance between the dye and the quencher. The systemic administration of the anti-Kras nanobeacons resulted in approximately 60% tumor size reduction and a 90% reduction in tumor vascularization. More important, the inhibition of the Kras gene expression in gastric tumors prevents the occurrence of metastasis to lung (80% reduction), increasing mice survival in more than 85%. The developed platform can be easily adjusted to hybridize with any specific target and provide facile diagnosis and treatment for neoplastic diseases.|$|E
5000|$|NanoFlares {{utilize the}} SNA {{architecture}} for intracellular mRNA detection. In this design, alkanethiol-terminated <b>antisense</b> <b>DNA</b> strands (complementary to a target mRNA strand within cells) {{are attached to}} the surface of a gold nanoparticle. Fluorophore-labeled “reporter strands” are then hybridized to the SNA construct to form the NanoFlare. When the fluorophore labels are brought within close proximity of the gold surface, as controlled by programmable nucleic acid hybridization, their fluorescence is quenched (Fig. 6). Following cellular entry (enabled by the SNA geometry), reporter strands are concomitantly driven from the NanoFlare and replaced by the longer, target mRNA sequence. Note that mRNA binding is thermodynamically favored since the strands holding the reporter sequence have greater overlap of their nucleotide sequence with the target mRNA. Upon reporter strand release, dye fluorescence is no longer quenched by the gold nanoparticle core, and increased fluorescence is observed. This method for RNA detection provides the only way to sort live cells based upon genetic content, and has thus enabled significant advances in disease diagnosis and cellular genetics. AuraSense and AuraSense Therapeutics are two start-up companies founded to advance these SNA structures in several sectors of the biomedical industry. In 2011, AuraSense entered into partnership with EMD-Millipore to commercialize NanoFlares under the SmartFlare trade name. There are now over 1600 commercial forms of SmartFlares sold worldwide.|$|E
50|$|The steps {{contributing}} {{to the production of}} primary transcripts involve a series of molecular interactions that initiate transcription of DNA within a cell's nucleus. Based on the needs of a given cell, certain DNA sequences are transcribed to produce a variety of RNA products to be translated into functional proteins for cellular use. To initiate the transcription process in a cell's nucleus, DNA double helices are unwound and hydrogen bonds connecting compatible nucleic acids of DNA are broken to produce two unconnected single DNA strands. One strand of the DNA template is used for transcription of the single-stranded primary transcript mRNA. This DNA strand is bound by an RNA polymerase at the promoter region of the DNA.In eukaryotes, three kinds of RNA—rRNA, tRNA, and mRNA—are produced based on the activity of three distinct RNA polymerases, whereas, in prokaryotes, only one RNA polymerase exists to create all kinds of RNA molecules. RNA polymerase II of eukaryotes transcribes the primary transcript, a transcript destined to be processed into mRNA, from the <b>antisense</b> <b>DNA</b> template in the 5' to 3' direction, and this newly synthesized primary transcript is complementary to the antisense strand of DNA. RNA polymerase II constructs the primary transcript using a set of four specific ribonucleoside monophosphate residues (Adenosine monophosphate (AMP), Cytidine monophosphate (CMP), Guanosine monophosphate (GMP), and Uridine monophosphate (UMP)) that are added continuously to the 3' hydroxyl group on the 3' end of the growing mRNA.|$|E

Since T lymphocytes are largely responsible for alloimmune activation, targeted gene transfer of gene of cyclin kinase inhibitor p 21 into T cells might inhibit their aberrant proliferation. A number of strategies using either adenoviral or lentiviral vectors linked to mono or bispecific antibodies directed against T cell surface markers/cytokines did not yield the desired results. Therefore, {{this study was designed to}} test if a CD 3 promoter-p 21 chimeric construct would in vitro and in vivo transfer p 21 gene to T lymphocytes and result in {{inhibition of}} proliferation. CD 3 promoter-p 21 chimeric constructs were prepared with p 21 in the sense and antisense orientation. For in vitro studies EL 4 -IL- 2 thyoma cells were used and for in vivo studies CD 3 p 21 sense and <b>antisense</b> plasmid <b>DNA</b> was injected intramuscularly in mice. Lymphocyte proliferation was quantified by 3 H-thymidine uptake assay; IL- 2 mRNA expression was studied by RT-PCR and using Real Time PCR assay, we monitored the CD 3, p 21, TNF-α and IFN-γ mRNA expression. Results Transfection of CD 3 p 21 sense and antisense in mouse thyoma cell line (EL 4 -IL- 2) resulted in modulation of mitogen-induced proliferation.
