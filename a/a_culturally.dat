5|$|All of the Irish kingdoms {{had their}} own kings but were {{nominally}} subject to the High King. The High King was drawn {{from the ranks of}} the provincial kings and ruled also the royal kingdom of Meath, with a ceremonial capital at the Hill of Tara. The concept didn't become a political reality until the Viking Age and even then was not a consistent one. Ireland did have <b>a</b> <b>culturally</b> unifying rule of law: the early written judicial system, the Brehon Laws, administered by a professional class of jurists known as the brehons.|$|E
5|$|Bridging the {{gap between}} self-expressive {{piercing}} and spiritual piercing, modern primitives use piercing {{and other forms of}} body modification as a way of ritually reconnecting with themselves and society, which according to Musafar once used piercing as <b>a</b> <b>culturally</b> binding ritual. But {{at the same time that}} piercing can be culturally binding, it may also be a means of rebellion, particularly for adolescents in Western cultures.|$|E

5|$|Gunther Erich Rothenberg {{was born}} in Berlin. His family was <b>a</b> <b>culturally</b> assimilated German Jewish family. In 1937, Rothenberg moved to the Netherlands with his mother; his father later joined them. The family moved next to Britain, where Rothenberg had some schooling. In 1939, he moved to Mandatory Palestine, then under British rule. There he joined the Zionist {{movement}} and Hashomer Hatzair (The Youth Guard), a Socialist-Zionist youth movement. He retained his passion for a Jewish homeland throughout his life.|$|E
5|$|India's {{geography}} and geology are climatically pivotal: the Thar Desert {{in the northwest}} and the Himalayas in the north work in tandem to effect <b>a</b> <b>culturally</b> and economically important monsoonal regime. As Earth's highest and most massive mountain range, the Himalayas bar the influx of frigid katabatic winds from the icy Tibetan Plateau and northerly Central Asia. Most of North India is thus kept warm or is only mildly chilly or cold during winter; the same thermal dam keeps most regions in India hot in summer.|$|E
5|$|Morrowind also {{contained}} a fair bit of voiced dialogue; an aspect somewhat better {{received by the}} gaming press. Of note is Lynda Carter, television's Wonder Woman, promoted by Bethesda {{for her role in}} voicing the female Nords in the game. Morrowinds race-specific voice acting received praise from some reviewers, though was met with disdain from others, who disliked the discord between <b>a</b> <b>culturally</b> inflected voice spoken in an alien dialect and the grammatically flawless dialogue printed in the dialogue boxes. The Special Edition Soundtrack was released over DirectSong as a digital release.|$|E
40|$|We present {{extensive}} numerical {{simulations of}} the Axelrod's model for social influence, aimed at understanding {{the formation of}} cultural domains. This is a nonequilibrium model with short range interactions and a remarkably rich dynamical behavior. We study the phase diagram of the model and uncover a nonequilibrium phase transition separating <b>an</b> ordered (<b>culturally</b> polarized) phase from <b>a</b> disordered (<b>culturally</b> fragmented) one. The nature of the phase transition can be continuous or discontinuous depending on the model parameters. At the transition, the size of cultural regions is power-law distributed.

5|$|Gerty Theresa Radnitz {{was born}} into a Jewish family in Prague in 1896. Her father, Otto Radnitz, was a chemist who became manager of sugar {{refineries}} after inventing a successful method for refining sugar. Her mother, Martha, a friend of Franz Kafka, was <b>a</b> <b>culturally</b> sophisticated woman. Gerty was tutored at home before enrolling in a Lyceum for girls, and at the age of 16 she decided {{she wanted to be a}} medical doctor. Pursuing the study of science, Gerty learned that she lacked the prerequisites in Latin, physics, chemistry, and mathematics. Over the course of a year, she managed to study the equivalent of eight years of Latin, five years of science, and five years of math.|$|E
5|$|Nartanasala was {{produced}} by actress C. Lakshmi Rajyam and her husband C. Sridhar Rao under the banner Rajyam Pictures. The film's story was based on Virata Parva, one of the eighteen books of the Indian epic Mahabharata. Rajyam and Rao felt that barring Keechaka Vadham (19161918) and Vijayadasami (1937), no other Indian film dared to explore Virata Parva and found it a unique premise. Also, the belief that reading Virata Parva in Telugu-speaking lands would result in heavy rainfalls made the subject <b>a</b> <b>culturally</b> significant one. Samudrala Raghavacharya wrote Nartanasala script and Kamalakara Kameswara Rao was chosen to direct the film. Nartanasala was Kameswara Rao's first mythological film.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{the fires}} of 1996 to 2003, archaeologists had {{surveyed}} approximately {{ninety percent of the}} park. Dense undergrowth and tree cover kept many ancient sites hidden from view, but after the Chapin V, Bircher and Pony fires, 593 previously undiscovered sites were revealed– most of them date to the Basketmaker III and Pueblo I periods. Also uncovered during the fires were extensive water containment features, including 1,189 check dams, 344 terraces, and five reservoirs that date to the Pueblo II and III periods. In February 2008, the Colorado Historical Society decided to invest a part of its $7million budget into <b>a</b> <b>culturally</b> modified trees project in the National Park.|$|E
5|$|The Greek and Latin histories, which {{represent}} {{the majority of}} materials covering Parthian history, are not considered entirely reliable since they were written {{from the perspective of}} rivals and wartime enemies. These external sources generally concern major military and political events, and often ignore social and cultural aspects of Parthian history. The Romans usually depicted the Parthians as fierce warriors but also as <b>a</b> <b>culturally</b> refined people; recipes for Parthian dishes in the cookbook Apicius exemplifies their admiration for Parthian cuisine. Apollodorus of Artemita and Arrian wrote histories focusing on Parthia, which are now lost and survive only as quoted extracts in other histories. Isidore of Charax, who lived during the reign of Augustus, provides an account of Parthian territories, perhaps from a Parthian government survey. To a lesser extent, people and events of Parthian history were also included in the histories of Justin, Strabo, Diodorus Siculus, Plutarch, Cassius Dio, Appian, Josephus, Pliny the Elder, and Herodian.|$|E
