5|$|At {{some point}} {{following}} {{the fall of}} the Western Roman Empire, a retrenchment was built within the city, reducing it to its present size.

The younger lavas may have formed from the mixing of dacite with the magmas forming the older lavas. Some inclusions in Licancabur rocks seem to be from wall rocks of the magma chamber.|$|E
5|$|Bethe {{managed to}} work it out on the train from New York to Schenectady. He arrived at a value of 1040MHz, {{extremely}} close to that obtained experimentally by Lamb and Retherford. He did so by realising that it was a non-relativistic process, which greatly simplified the calculations. His paper, published in the Physical Review in August 1947 was only two pages long and contained just 12 mathematical equations, but was enormously influential. Hitherto, it had been <b>assumed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> infinities meant that QED was fundamentally flawed, and that a new, radical theory was required. Bethe demonstrated that this was not necessary.|$|E
5|$|By {{the thirteenth}} and fourteenth centuries AD, Virgil had gained a {{reputation}} as a virtuous pagan, a term referring to pagans who were never evangelized and consequently during their lifetime had no opportunity to recognize Christ, but nevertheless led virtuous lives, so that it seemed objectionable to consider them damned. Eventually, some Christians sought to reconcile Virgil's works with the supposed Christianity present in them. Consequently, during the Late Antiquity and beyond, many <b>assumed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> puer referenced in the Fourth Eclogue was actually Jesus Christ.|$|E

Morning would provide any assistance that Scott might require during this period.|$|E
