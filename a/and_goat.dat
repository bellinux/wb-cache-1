There have also been numerous identifications of Nomadic pastoralism in archaeological sites, identified by a prevalence of sheep <b>and</b> <b>goat</b> bones, a lack of grain or grain-processing equipment, very limited architecture showing a set of characteristic traits, a location outside the region's zone of agriculture, and ethnographic analogy to modern nomadic pastoral peoples.|$|E
5|$|The {{gray wolf}} has been fully {{protected}} in Italy since 1976, and now holds {{a population of}} over 1,269-1,800. Italian wolves entered France's Mercantour National Park in 1993, and at least fifty wolves were discovered in the western Alps in 2000. By 2013 the 250 wolves in the Western Alps imposed a significant burden on traditional sheep <b>and</b> <b>goat</b> husbandry {{with a loss of}} over 5,000 animals in 2012. There are approximately 2,000 wolves inhabiting the Iberian Peninsula, of which 150 reside in northeastern Portugal. In Spain, the species occurs in Galicia, Leon, and Asturias. Although hundreds of Iberian wolves are illegally killed annually, the population has expanded south across the river Duero and east to the Asturias and Pyrenees Mountains.|$|E

40|$|Background: Besides the {{strategy}} based on test-and-slaughter policy for seropositive sheep <b>and</b> <b>goats</b> after {{an evaluation of}} the situation, vaccination measure of those animals against brucellosis with Rev 1 vaccine in 2008 have been implemented. Aims: To examine the influence of the new measure for control and eradication of brucellosis in sheep <b>and</b> <b>goats</b> on the incidence of human brucellosis before and after vaccination with B. melitensis Rev. 1. Material and methods: This is a retrospective study in which comparison of the incidence of human brucellosis in the three regions has been made depending on the vaccination procedure in sheep <b>and</b> <b>goats</b> one year before the implementation of the vaccination (2007) and 4 years later. Data for the infected sheep <b>and</b> <b>goats</b> were obtained from the Food and Veterinary Agency and data for human brucellosis were obtained from the Institute of Public Health of the Republic of Macedonia. Results: The greatest decrease in the incidence of human brucellosis (from 124. 3 to 19. 7 / 100, 000 inhabitants) was registered in the region 3 where mass vaccination of sheep <b>and</b> <b>goats</b> was conducted. The highest incidence rate of brucellosis in sheep <b>and</b> <b>goats</b> was registered in 2007 (2010 / 100, 000 sheep <b>and</b> <b>goats)</b> <b>and</b> the lowest in 2011 (156 / 100, 000 sheep <b>and</b> <b>goats).</b> Periodic prevalence of brucellosis in sheep <b>and</b> <b>goats</b> prior to vaccination was 6882 / 100, 000 sheep <b>and</b> <b>goats</b> <b>and</b> after vaccination 3698 / 100, 000 sheep <b>and</b> <b>goats</b> (p< 0. 05). There was a moderate positive correlation between the number of infected individuals with brucellosis and the number of infected sheep <b>and</b> <b>goats</b> (r= 0. 26). Conclusion: Decline of the incidence of human brucellosis {{is one of the major}} indicators for successfully implemented new control programs and strategies for prevention and eradication of brucellosis in sheep <b>and</b> <b>goats.</b> Vaccination was good measure to control brucellosis in the 3 regions...|$|R

Even after obtaining a building as the best possible fit in the coastal town of Bobbili, infestation of snakes and bats posed a problem for the crew. In addition, the building was not strong enough to support the filming equipment. Under these circumstances, the makeshift production designers refurbished the building with space for chicken coops <b>and</b> <b>goat</b> pens as required by the script. To make the space look inhabited, local help was sought for trampling the ground with their livestock. The local people wanted to act as extras in exchange for providing farming tools, bullock carts and other material. As a result, the crew had to ensure that these extras didn't look into the camera during filming.|$|E

25|$|Research {{suggests}} {{the use of}} multiple guard llamas is not as effective as one. Multiple males tend to bond with one another, rather than with the livestock, and may ignore the flock.

Some llamas appear to bond more quickly to sheep or goats if they are introduced just prior to lambing. Many sheep <b>and</b> <b>goat</b> producers indicate a special bond quickly develops between lambs and their guard llama and the llama is particularly protective of the lambs.|$|E
