500|$|Retrospectively, the 32X {{is widely}} criticized {{as having been}} under-supported and a poor idea {{in the wake of}} the release of the Sega Saturn. [...] 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish stated that the 32X [...] "tainted just about {{everything}} it touched." [...] GamesRadar also panned the system, placing it as their ninth-worst console with reviewer Mikel Reparaz criticizing that [...] "it was a stopgap system that would be thrown under the bus when the Sega Saturn came out six months later, and everyone seemed to know it except for die-hard Sega fans and the company itself." [...] Retro Gamers Damien McFerran offered some praise for the power increase of the 32X to offer ports of Space Harrier, <b>After</b> <b>Burner,</b> and Virtua Fighter that were accurate to the original arcade versions, as well as the add-on's price point, stating, [...] "If you didn't have deep enough pockets to afford a Saturn, then the 32X was a viable option; it's just a shame that it sold so poorly because the potential was there for true greatness." [...] Levi Buchanan, writing for IGN, saw some sense in the move for Sega to create the 32X but criticized its implementation. [...] According to Buchanan, [...] "I actually thought the 32X was a better idea than the SEGA CD... The 32X, while underpowered, at least advanced the ball. Maybe it only gained a few inches in no small part due to a weak library, but at least the idea was the right one." ...|$|E
500|$|The 32X's {{game library}} {{consists}} of fortytitles, including six that required both the Sega 32X and Sega CD. [...] Among the titles for the 32X were ports of arcade games Space Harrier and Star Wars Arcade, a sidescroller with a hummingbird {{as a main}} character in Kolibri, and a 32X-exclusive game in the Sonic the Hedgehog series titled Knuckles' Chaotix. [...] Several of the games released for the 32X are enhanced ports of Genesis games, including <b>After</b> <b>Burner,</b> NFL Quarterback Club, and World Series Baseball '95. In a retrospective review of the console, Star Wars Arcade was considered the best game for the 32X by IGN for its cooperative play, soundtrack, and faithful reproduction of the experiences of Star Wars. In a separate review, IGN's Buchanan praised the 32X title Shadow Squadron as superior to Star Wars Arcade. [...] Retro Gamer writer Damien McFerran, however, praised Virtua Fighter as [...] "the jewel in the 32X's crown", and GamesRadar named Knuckles' Chaotix as the best game for the system. Next Generation called Virtua Fighter [...] "the colorful wreath on 32X's coffin", [...] reflecting the consensus among contemporary critics that the game was at once arguably the 32X's best release and a clear harbinger of the platform's imminent discontinuation, since it was clearly inferior to the Saturn versions of Virtua Fighter Remix (which had already been released) and Virtua Fighter 2 (which was due out {{in just a few}} months). In response to fan inquiries, Sega stated that the 32X architecture was not powerful enough to handle a port of Virtua Fighter 2.|$|E
