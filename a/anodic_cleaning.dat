40|$|Gallium {{extraction}} from Bayer Liquor {{is carried}} out by adopting techniques like (i) Amalgam metallurgy. (ii) Cementation with Al-Ga alloy as cementing agent, (iii) Solvent extraction and (iv) Ion-exchange resin process. The metal obtained {{by any of the}} above process has a purity of about 97 - 99. 9 %. There are several method of subsequent purification employed to get electronic grade metal (6 N purity). The method presented here is simple and less cumbersome, consisting of acid and alkali leaching followed by <b>anodic</b> <b>cleaning</b> in HCl medium, multiple shaking of the resultant gallium metal using saturated KCl solution containing oxidising agent like H 2 O 2 or (NH 4) 2 S 2 O 8 and acetic acid and finally subjecting it to differential solidification. The reported methods viz. electrorefining, vacuum heating/distillation, zone refining, etc could be avoided. Metal of the required 99. 9999 % purity is obtained which naturally commands higher prices than lower grade...|$|E
