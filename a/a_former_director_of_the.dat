25|$|On 12 June, Prime Minister Casares Quiroga met General Juan Yagüe, who falsely {{convinced}} Casares of {{his loyalty}} to the republic. Mola began serious planning in the spring.

He was well respected in the Army of Africa, the Army's toughest troops. He wrote a cryptic letter to Casares on 23 June, suggesting that the military was disloyal, but could be restrained if he were put in charge. Casares did nothing, failing to arrest or buy off Franco. British sympathizers with the rebels (who were associated with the British Secret Intelligence Service) chartered a Dragon Rapide aircraft to transport Franco from the Canary Islands to Spanish Morocco. The plane flew to the Canaries on 11 July, and Franco arrived in Morocco on 19 July.|$|E
25|$|Mortimer Wheeler {{formally}} {{resigned as}} Honorary Director in 1944 {{when he became}} Director-General of the Archaeological Survey of India and, {{at the end of}} the Second World War, the Directorship was awarded to V.

Grimes, like Wheeler <b>a</b> <b>former</b> <b>Director</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> London Museum, and best known today for his 1954 excavation of the London Mithraeum. Following Grimes, the Directorship has been held by the Mediterranean prehistorian John Davies Evans; the geographer David R. Harris; Peter Ucko, founder of the World Archaeological Congress and the prehistorian and evolutionary theorist Stephen Shennan. It is currently held by prehistorian Sue Hamilton. Initially the Institute was based in St John’s Lodge, Regent's Park, London, but in 1958 it moved into its purpose-built new premises in Gordon Square. 2012 marked the Institute's 75th anniversary and a number of events and activities were held to mark this occasion.|$|E
500|$|Ctenosaura bakeri {{was first}} {{described}} by Norwegian-born American zoologist Leonhard Stejneger in 1901, {{while working for}} the Smithsonian Institution. The generic name, Ctenosaura, is derived from two Greek words: ctenos (Κτενός), meaning [...] "comb" [...] (referring to the comblike spines on the lizard's back and tail), and saura (σαύρα), meaning [...] "lizard". Its specific name, bakeri, is the Latinized form of Stejneger's friend and colleague Frank Baker, who was <b>a</b> <b>former</b> <b>director</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> National Zoo in Washington, D.C..|$|E

500|$|In July 1904 the New York Times {{obtained}} {{a copy of}} the Quimby manuscript from Sally Wentworth's son, and juxtaposed passages with Science and Health to highlight the similarities. It also published Eddy's handwritten notes on Quimby's manuscript to show what the newspaper alleged was the transition from his words to hers. Quimby's manuscripts were published in 1921. Eddy's biographers continued to disagree about his influence on Eddy. Bates and Dittemore, the latter <b>a</b> <b>former</b> <b>director</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Christian Science church, argued in 1932 that [...] "as far as the thought is concerned, Science and Health is practically all Quimby," [...] except for malicious animal mesmerism. Robert Peel, who also worked for the church, wrote in 1966 that Eddy may have influenced Quimby as much as he influenced her. Gardner argued in 1993 that Eddy had taken [...] "huge chunks" [...] from Quimby, and Gill in 1998 that there were only general similarities.|$|E
500|$|On 12 June, Prime Minister Casares Quiroga met General Juan Yagüe, who was rightly {{accused of}} masterminding the growing {{conspiracy}} in North Africa, but Yagüe managed to convince Casares of his {{loyalty to the}} republic. Mola held a meeting between garrison commanders {{in the north of}} Spain on 15 June, and local authorities, on hearing of the meeting, surrounded it with Civil Guards. However, Casares ordered their removal, saying he trusted Mola. Mola began serious planning in the spring, but General Francisco Franco hesitated until early July, inspiring other plotters to refer to him as [...] "Miss Canary Islands 1936". Franco was a key player because of his prestige as <b>a</b> <b>former</b> <b>director</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> military academy and as the man who suppressed the Socialist uprising of 1934. He was well respected in the Spanish Moroccan Army, Spain's strongest military force. He wrote a cryptic letter to Casares on 23 June, suggesting that the military was disloyal, but could be restrained if he were put in charge. Casares did nothing, failing to arrest or buy off Franco, even if placing him in overall command was impossible. Franco was to be assigned control of Morocco in the new regime, and largely sidelined. On July 5, an aircraft was chartered to take Franco from the Canary Islands to Morocco. It arrived on July 14.|$|E
