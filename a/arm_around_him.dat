2500|$|Rumsfeld {{discusses}} the longtime problems of his son, Nick, with drug addiction. He recalls {{when his son}} checked into a rehab clinic shortly after 9/11, and Rumsfeld, overcome with emotion, breaks down {{in a meeting with}} Bush in the Oval Office. He writes, [...] "I had not imagined I might choke up... at that moment George W Bush wasn't just the president. He was a compassionate human being who had a sense of what Joyce and I were going through." [...] Rumsfeld states that Bush rose from the Presidential desk to put his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>him</b> in understanding.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the last}} day of her life, Kupcinet had dinner with future Lost in Space cast member Mark Goddard and his wife, Marcia Rogers Goddard, at their house on Coldwater Canyon Drive in Beverly Hills (near Mulholland Drive). She was due there at 6:30 pm, but arrived an hour late by taxicab. The couple said Kupcinet only toyed with her food during the meal. Marcia Goddard told two {{officers}} from the L.A. County Sheriff's Office that during dinner with Kupcinet [...] "... her lips seemed numb. Her voice was funny. She moved her head at odd angles." [...] The Goddards also noticed that her pupils were constricted. Mark Goddard told authorities that he confronted Kupcinet about her altered state during the meal, and she began to cry, putting her <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>him.</b> At one point during the meal, Kupcinet told her friends an unsubstantiated story about a baby that had been abandoned on her doorstep earlier that day. At 8:30 pm, a taxicab arrived to take her home, and she promised to telephone the Goddards soon.|$|E
60|$|He {{held on to}} the bar, {{his legs}} {{wobbling}} under him, Martin's <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>him</b> and supporting him, while he thought.|$|E
60|$|She {{crossed over}} {{to the back of}} his chair and put her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
60|$|She laughed suddenly, with a wild {{catch in}} her voice, and flung her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
60|$|For a {{few moments}} McMurdo and the girl stood in silence. Then she threw her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
60|$|She {{caught one}} <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>him,</b> as his was around herself; the tremor ran {{from him to}} her; both sat dumb.|$|E
6000|$|... "You think Mr Blake is silly. He is a silly young man, I allow; but Mr Hall {{has been}} very civil. As I am to go there for a week, {{you might as well}} take me." [...] As she spoke she put her <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>him,</b> caressing him.|$|E
60|$|The next instant Joe was by {{his side}} on the bunk, his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>him.</b> Prompted by some instinctive monitor, {{he had done it}} before he thought. A week before he could not have {{imagined}} himself in such an absurd situation--his arm around a boy; but now it seemed the most natural thing in the world. He did not comprehend, but he knew, whatever it was, that it was of deep importance to his companion.|$|E
60|$|But Olive put her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him</b> and coaxed him for her sake to let {{the matter}} rest. And, finally, the captain, grumblingly, assented.|$|R
60|$|I {{could not}} help laughing, and he stood {{looking at me with}} such a {{whimsical}} expression that I rose and flung my <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... (Going to Tommy, and {{bending down}} with her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him.)</b> No, Tommy. Mama {{has to go to}} that horrid dinner to-night. But to-morrow we'll play.|$|R
60|$|The {{crowd was}} in a tumult. The men of rank and dignity, who stood more {{immediately}} around the clergyman, were so taken by surprise, and so perplexed as to the purport of what they saw--unable to receive the explanation which most readily presented itself, or to imagine any other--that they remained silent and inactive spectators of the judgement which Providence seemed about to work. They beheld the minister, leaning on Hester's shoulder, and supported by her <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>him,</b> approach the scaffold, and ascend its steps; while still the little hand of the sin-born child was clasped in his. Old Roger Chillingworth followed, as one intimately connected with the drama of guilt and sorrow {{in which they had}} all been actors, and well entitled, therefore to be present at its closing scene.|$|E
60|$|Feverish and excited, {{he tried}} {{in vain to}} sleep again; and after an hour's tossing, rose and dressed, and started for a bathe on his beloved old pebble ridge. As he passed his mother's door, he could not help looking in. The dim light of morning showed him the bed; but its pillow had not been pressed that night. His mother, in her long white night-dress, was {{kneeling}} {{at the other end of}} the chamber at her prie-dieu, absorbed in devotion. Gently he slipped in without a word, and knelt down at her side. She turned, smiled, passed her <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>him,</b> and went on silently with her prayers. Why not? They were for him, and he knew it, and prayed also; and his prayers were for her, and for poor lost John Oxenham, and all his vanished crew.|$|E
60|$|For {{a single}} instant {{she turned her}} set face to the window with a sudden convulsive movement, as if she would have called him back, {{but at the same}} moment the {{opposite}} door creaked and her brother slipped into the room. Whether a quick memory of the deserter's entrance at that door a year ago had crossed her mind, whether there was some strange suggestion in his mud-stained garments and weak deprecating smile, or whether it was the outcome of some desperate struggle within her, there was that in her face that changed his smile into a frightened cry for pardon, as he ran and fell on his knees at her feet. But even as he did so her stern look vanished, and with her <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>him</b> she bent over him and mingled her tears with his.|$|E
5000|$|... {Shu Nian {{tries to}} walk away, but is again stopped by Xie Yan that grabs Shu Nian from behind {{wrapping}} his <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him</b> holding him tightly.} ...|$|R
6000|$|And {{the bright}} blade gleamed over Victoria's head.... He was struck down--blinded--half-stunned--but rose {{again with the}} energy of madness.... What was this? Soft <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him....</b> Victoria's! ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{rushed into}} his embrace, and {{throwing}} her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him,</b> {{buried her face}} upon his breast. 'Alaric, Alaric, my husband! my love, my best, my own, my only love!' ...|$|R
60|$|I was {{determined}} to wait up for his return, so I piled some coals upon the fire and took down a novel from the shelf. My thoughts proved {{more interesting than the}} book, however, and I threw it on one side. An indefinable feeling of anxiety and depression weighed upon me. Twelve o'clock came, and then half-past, without any sign of my friend. It was nearly one when I heard a step in the street outside, and then a knocking at the door. I was surprised, as I knew that my friend always carried a key--however, I hurried down and undid the latch. As the door flew open I knew in a moment that my worst apprehensions had been fulfilled. Barrington Cowles was leaning against the railings outside with his face sunk upon his breast, and his whole attitude expressive of the most intense despondency. As he passed in he gave a stagger, and would have fallen had I not thrown my left <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>him.</b> Supporting him with this, and holding the lamp in my other hand, I led him slowly upstairs into our sitting-room. He sank down upon the sofa without a word. Now that I could get a good view of him, I was horrified to see the change which had come over him. His face was deadly pale, and his very lips were bloodless. His cheeks and forehead were clammy, his eyes glazed, and his whole expression altered. He looked like a man who had gone through some terrible ordeal, and was thoroughly unnerved.|$|E
6000|$|Ariel {{had been}} {{beforehand}} with me. She had raised her master in the chair; she had got one <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>him.</b> In {{her free hand}} she brandished an Indian club, torn from a [...] "trophy" [...] of Oriental weapons that ornamented the wall over the fire-place. The creature was transfigured! Her dull eyes glared like {{the eyes of a}} wild animal. She gnashed her teeth in the frenzy that possessed her. [...] "You have done this!" [...] she shouted to me, waving the club furiously around and around over her head. [...] "Come near him, and I'll dash your brains out! I'll mash you till there's not a whole bone left in your skin!" [...] Benjamin, still holding me with one hand opened the door with the other. I let him do with me as he would; Ariel fascinated me; I could look at nothing but Ariel. Her frenzy vanished as she saw us retreating. She dropped the club; she threw both arms around him, and nestled her head on his bosom, and sobbed and wept over him. [...] "Master! master! They shan't vex you any more. Look up again. Laugh at me as you used to do. Say, 'Ariel, you're a fool.' Be like yourself again!" [...] I was forced into the next room. I heard a long, low, wailing cry of misery from the poor creature who loved him with a dog's fidelity and a woman's devotion. The heavy door was closed between us. I was in the quiet antechamber, crying over that piteous sight; clinging to my kind old friend as helpless and as useless as a child.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Listen to me, Alroy,' said Honain {{in a low}} voice, and {{he placed}} his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>him,</b> 'I am your friend. Our {{acquaintance}} is very brief: no matter, I love you; I rescued you in injury, I tended you in sickness, even now your life is in my power, I would protect it with my own. You cannot doubt me. Our affections are not under our own control; and mine are yours. The sympathy between us is entire. You see me, you see what I am; a Hebrew, though unknown; one of that despised, rejected, persecuted people, of whom you are the chief. I too would be free and honoured. Freedom and honour are mine, but I was my own messiah. I quitted in good time our desperate cause, but I gave it a trial. Ask Jabaster how I fought. Youth could be my only excuse for such indiscretion. I left this country; I studied and resided among the Greeks. I returned from Constantinople, with all their learning, some of their craft. No one knew me. I assumed their turban, and I am the Lord Honain. Take my experience, child, and save yourself much sorrow. Turn your late adventure to good account. No one can recognise you here. I will introduce you amongst the highest as my child by some fair Greek. The world is before you. You may fight, you may love, you may revel. War, and Women, and luxury are all at your command. With your person and talents you may be grand vizir. Clear your head of nonsense. In the present disordered state of the empire, you may even carve yourself out a kingdom, infinitely more delightful than the barren land of milk and honey. I have seen it, child; a rocky wilderness, where I would not let my courser graze.' ...|$|E
60|$|He {{sank back}} gently into his chair, {{and did not}} speak again. But it was some hours before he had ceased to breathe, with Mirah's and Deronda's <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{seems to}} be {{considerable}} hoist in it," [...] he said, directly. And then I put my <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him,</b> and found that I could raise him from the ground.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, you dear ninny!" [...] Dora cried, {{throwing}} her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him</b> and hugging him. [...] "Then you saw it, too! I thought something was the matter, you were acting so strangely." ...|$|R
60|$|When {{they were}} all gone she bent forward and, smiling sweetly, {{partially}} by signs and partially by exclamations {{made it clear to}} us that she was very anxious to know where we came from. The difficulty was how to explain, but at last an idea struck me. I had my large pocket-book in my pocket and a pencil. Taking it out, I made a little sketch of a lake, and then as best I could I drew the underground river and the lake at the other end. When I had done this I advanced to the steps of the throne and gave it to her. She understood it at once and clapped her hands with delight, and then descending from the throne took it to her sister Sorais, who also evidently understood. Next she took the pencil from me, and after examining it with curiosity proceeded to make a series of delightful little sketches, the first representing herself holding out both hands in welcome, and a man uncommonly like Sir Henry taking them. Next she drew a lovely little picture of a hippopotamus rolling about dying in the water, and of an individual, in whom we had no difficulty in recognizing Agon the High Priest, holding up his hands in horror on the bank. Then followed a most alarming picture of a dreadful fiery furnace and of the same figure, Agon, poking us into it with a forked stick. This picture perfectly horrified me, but I was a little reassured when she nodded sweetly and proceeded to make a fourth drawing -- a man again uncommonly like Sir Henry, and of two women, in whom I recognized Sorais and herself, each with one <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>him,</b> and holding a sword in protection over him. To all of these Sorais, who I saw was employed in carefully taking us all in -- especially Curtis -- signified her approval by nodding.|$|E
5000|$|In 1993, after {{a lengthy}} and highly publicized jury trial {{stemming}} from his involvement with the Bank of Credit and Commerce International and its secret acquisition of First American Bankshares Inc., Altman was acquitted. Carter was seen on the TV news with her <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>him,</b> declaring, [...] "Not guilty! Not guilty!" [...] to the gathered reporters.|$|E
5000|$|A season {{earlier in}} 1963, Darryl Hill of the University of Maryland {{was the first}} and only African-American {{football}} player in the ACC. According to Lee Corso, a Maryland assistant coach at that time, Wake Forest had [...] "the worst atmosphere" [...] of any campus the Maryland football team visited. Piccolo went over to the Maryland bench, walked Hill over to the area in front of the student section and put his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>him,</b> silencing the crowd.|$|E
6000|$|He {{had a fit}} of coughing. Winifred {{passed her}} <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him</b> and held him up. [...] "If you stay," [...] she whispered to Hefferom, [...] "you will kill him. He ought not to speak ever a sentence." ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Smithson made {{a strange}} moaning noise, and, {{snatching}} his hat from the table, clapped {{it on his}} head and made for the door. Mr. Clarkson flung his <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him</b> and dragged him back by main force.|$|R
60|$|Instantly Joan saw it--saw in him {{the return}} of the other and better Kells, how {{stricken}} with remorse. She slipped to her knees and clasped her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him.</b> He tried to break her hold, but she held on.|$|R

50|$|He is {{even said}} to create social vignettes with the toys. For example, {{the day after}} he first allowed his owner to put her <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>him,</b> he placed a large bear with its arm around a smaller frog. Dr. Barbara Smuts, a {{professor}} of psychology and specialist in animal behavior at the University of Michigan who studied Donnie and captured his activities on video, suggests that these behaviors may be linked to self-entertainment, or to past experiences such as his time spent in a shelter for a year with only a single toy. In her view, there have not been enough examples of behavior like Donnie's, to decide scientifically what they may mean.|$|E
50|$|The {{season ends}} with Tommy, Lou, Sean, Michael Gavin (Tommy's Dad), and Uncle Teddy {{attending}} a Newark Bears {{minor league baseball}} game {{at the request of}} Tommy's dad. Tommy and his father take the close up seats {{while the rest of the}} crew take seats higher up in the same section. Lou explains to Garrity how Baseball is like life, waiting for something to come and not being awake for it to happen, but having enough time for a beer, a hot dog, and maybe a blowjob here and there. Also, Colleen is seen attending a picnic with Black Shawn. The last shot is of Tommy showing his father a hit, and his dad not responding or waking up. Tommy realizes that his father has died and puts his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>him</b> and continues to watch the game.|$|E
60|$|The {{poor woman}} had {{suffered}} too much already to shrink from this last crushing blow. But she walked quietly {{to his side}} without a word or cry, knelt, placed her loving <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him,</b> and I left them so together.|$|R
60|$|Old Mr Kennedy {{seemed to}} have lost his powers of speech. He gazed at his son {{for a few seconds}} in silence, then {{suddenly}} threw his <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him</b> and engaged in a species of wrestle which he intended for an embrace.|$|R
6000|$|There {{was no need}} of {{any more}} words, no need of tears or kind <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him.</b> He knew he was an orphan now, and turned instinctively to the old friend who loved him best. Throwing himself down beside his dog, Ben clung about the curly neck, sobbing bitterly,-- ...|$|R
