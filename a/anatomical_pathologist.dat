40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) The {{treatment}} {{of patients with}} metastatic melanoma has been revolutionized by the discovery of crucial activating kinase mutations, making melanoma susceptible to targeted kinase inhibition. The result is that melanoma, once a notoriously treatment resistant malignancy, has become {{the poster child for}} the promise of personalized cancer therapy. We have sought to identify what the incidence of various kinase mutations are in a group of 192 melanoma patients, sampled from a population that harbors one of the highest rates of melanoma in the world, and what this may mean for their prognosis and treatment. In our cohort of patients with advanced melanoma, mutations in BRAF, NRAS, KIT and KRAS occurred with frequencies of 24. 5 %, 20. 8 %, 4. 7 % and 2. 6 %, respectively. We show that BRAF-mutant melanomas have a specific clinical profile. Furthermore, we reveal that BRAF and NRAS mutant melanomas show significant differences in their respective rates of metastatic spread and overall survival. Our mutation screen also revealed two relatively common juxtamembranous MET single nucleotide polymorphisms to be significantly over-represented in our melanoma patient cohort. As the identification of some of these clinically relevant mutations will become routine in the workup of patients with advanced melanoma, we turned our attention to the search of a phenotype/genotype association that may be employed by <b>anatomical</b> <b>pathologists</b> to triage cases for molecular analysis. Using m-RNA extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin embedded melanoma tissue, we identified a number of genes differentially expressed in BRAF, NRAS and KIT-mutant melanomas. The levels of these differentially expressed genes were then assessed using immunohistochemical staining and quantitative scoring on a matching melanoma tissue microarray. We show a strong correlation in the expression data and immunohistochemical staining for some of the genes identified. Some of these differences in protein staining were also shown to be capable of having a good predictive capacity for identifying cases likely to harbor KIT mutations. Quantitative cytomorphological analysis identified a BRAF-mutant melanoma specific morphological phenotype, characterized by larger cellular volumes, more rounded shapes and lower degrees of cellular pleomorphism. In conclusion, we show that incorporating discriminatory clinical; cytomorphological and immunohistochemical data can generate a decision tree algorithm with fair to good predictive power for the detection of KIT and BRAF-mutant melanomas...|$|R

40|$|The {{finding of}} {{possibly}} contaminant tissues or cells in surgical or cytology case material {{can be a}} challenging problem in diagnostic anatomical pathology samples. The reported rates of occurrence have ranged from 0 to 8. 8 % (including prospective and retrospective cases). A diagnostically dissimilar tissue fragment, whether contiguous with other tissue or among other fragments within a paraffin section, and which is not incompatible with the case tissue, often requires a rigorous investigation to confirm or deny its relevance to the case. Fluorescence in situ hybridization using dual red and green DNA probes to regions of the X and Y chromosomes, respectively, were used in one case where the potential contaminant was suspected to have originated from a male patient. The putative contaminant tissue fragment was confirmed as male, with cells having one X and one Y chromosome, unlike the other tissue fragments on the slide with two X chromosomes. In a second case, DNA polymorphisms were used to compare allelic patterns that were informative not only in proving the extraneous tissue as a contaminant, but in addition, {{could be used to}} trace the latter to its original tissue source.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer/American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society {{classification}} of lung adenocarcinoma recommends identification of pathologic patterns in metastatic samples where possible. We investigated the clinical relevance of these patterns. METHODS: Patients with a surgical biopsy of lung adenocarcinoma from a metastatic site were included. Slides were reviewed by an <b>anatomical</b> <b>pathologist</b> identifying the histologic patterns of solid with mucin, acinar, micropapillary, papillary, and assigning a major adenocarcinoma subtype {{according to the}} International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer/American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society classification. EGFR and KRAS mutation testing were performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded blocks. Mutations were detected by high resolution melting assay with high resolution melting-positive samples confirmed by Sanger sequencing. RESULTS: One-hundred patients were included. The major histologic subtype prevalence was as follows: solid (50), acinar (29), micropapillary (20), and papillary (1). Of 100 patients, 45 received no systemic therapy with no overall survival differences seen by histologic subtype and 55 received systemic therapy (chemoradiotherapy with curative intent or palliative chemotherapy). Worse survival {{was seen in the}} major solid histologic subtype compared with major acinar (hazard ratio 0. 32 [95 % confidence interval 0. 15 - 0. 68], p = 0. 003) and micropapillary subtypes (hazard ratio 0. 34 [95 % confidence interval, 0. 17 - 0. 69], p = 0. 003). The major solid histologic subtype was less likely to harbor EGFR mutations (p = 0. 006) and was less frequent in never smokers (p = 0. 010) compared with other histologic subtypes. CONCLUSION: The major solid histologic subtype of lung adenocarcinoma at metastatic sites is associated with shorter overall survival on systemic anticancer therapy. Furthermore, the major solid histologic subtype is less likely to harbor EGFR mutations. These results require validation in larger cohorts. Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|E
40|$|Immunohistochemical (IHC) {{staining}} of formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues (FFPE) {{is widely}} used in diagnostic surgical pathology. All <b>anatomical</b> and surgical <b>pathologists</b> use IHC to confirm cancer cell type and possible origin of metastatic cancer of unknown primary site. What kinds of improvements in IHC are needed to boost and strengthen the use of IHC in future diagnostic pathology practice? The aim of this perspective is to suggest that continuing reliance on immunohistochemistry in cancer diagnosis, search and validation of biomarkers for predictive and prognostic studies and utility in cancer treatment selection means that minimum IHC data sets including “normalization methods” for IHC scoring, use of relative protein expression levels, use of protein functional pathways and modifications and protein cell type specificity may be needed when markers are proposed for use in diagnostic pathology. Furthermore evidence based methods (EBM), minimum criteria for diagnostic accuracy (STARD), will help in selecting antibodies for use in diagnostic pathology. In the near future, quantitative methods of proteomics, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) {{and the use of}} high-throughput genomics for diagnosis and predictive decisions may become preferred tools in medicine...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} {{framework}} and methodology for the automated identification and delineation of tissues and their pathologies in hematoxylin and eosin (H 2 ̆ 6 E) stained images. Histopathology {{is vital to}} medicine and research as it enables quantitative and qualitative analysis of tissue samples, stained and visualized via microscopes; the most routine and cost-effective of these stains is H 2 ̆ 6 E. In clinical diagnostic surgical pathology, the pathologist interprets H 2 ̆ 6 E-stained tissue slides by determining whether a given sample represents normal or abnormal tissue for the given <b>anatomical</b> location. Although <b>pathologists</b> accurately and consistently identify and delineate such tissues and their pathologies, this is a time-consuming and expensive task; thus the need for automated algorithms for improved throughput and robustness. We develop such an algorithm that uses local histograms and occlusion models as a mathematical framework for pixel-level classification. We also develop an expert-guided feature set called the histopathology vocabulary that mimics the visual process used by pathologists. To expand applicability, we achieve simultaneous identification and delineation by performing pixel-level classification. Experimental results on both a clinical application (active colitis) and a research one (tissue development in teratoma tumors) validate the discriminative power of our approach. We also present comparisons to popular, though general, feature types to demonstrate the power of our expert-guided feature set. Our framework and methodology demonstrates great promise towards {{the creation of a}} framework and methodology for the automated identification and delineation of tissues and their pathologies in H 2 ̆ 6 E-stained images...|$|R
40|$|Diagnosis of bone tumors {{is based}} on careful {{evaluation}} of clinical, imaging and a pathologic findings. So the biopsy of bone and soft tissue sarcomas is the final step in evaluation and a fundamental step in the diagnosis of the lesion. It should not be performed as a shortcut to diagnosis (1). The biopsy should be performed in order to confirm the diagnosis and differentiate among few diagnoses after careful staged studies. Real and artificial changes in imaging studies will be superimposed after performing biopsy, which may alter the interpretation if done after biopsy is taken (1). The correct management of a sarcoma depends on the accurate diagnosis. Inadequate, inapprppriate, or inaccurate non-representative biopsy leads to poorer outcome in terms of survivorship and limb salvage. An incorrect, unplanned incision and biopsy may unnecessarily contaminate uninvolved compartments which may convert a salvageable limb to amputation. Anatomic approach along with the proper biopsy techniques may lead to success or catastrophe. It is clear that in patients with inappropriate biopsy, the chance {{of the need to}} change the treatment to more radical than would originally be expected is significantly higher. Also it is more probable to need to  convert curative to palliative treatment and to require adjuvant radiotherapy in patients with inappropriate biopsies. Patients with sarcoma are best served by early referral to a specialized center where staged investigations and biopsy can be performed with minimal morbidity (3). Open biopsy is still considered the gold standard; however, recent studies suggest comparable results with percutaneous core needle biopsy. Our study on 103 consecutive CNB and open biopsy showed comparable results as well. Surgeons need to answer to two questions prior to performing a biopsy: 1 -          Where is {{the best part of the}} lesion to be biopsied? 2 -          What is the safest route without contaminating other anatomic structures? (4) Carcinomas are homogeneous, and a simple CNB is usually sufficient for diagnosis, but in soft tissue sarcomas, the periphery of the tumor is the growing part and usually represents the authentic underlying malignancy. The center of the tumor may be hemorrhagic or necrotic, thus taking biopsy from this part may distract from the correct diagnosis. Extraosseus part of a bone sarcoma is as representative as bony component of the tumor. Violating the bone and weakening the cortex may predispose it to pathologic fracture, so biopsy of an extraosseus part is sufficient for the diagnosis if present (3). The biopsy tract “open or CNB” is contaminated by tumor cells and should be widely excised if a wide excision or amputation is performed. For this reason, excision of the biopsy incision or needle entrance should be planned along with the definitive tumor excision to prevent complications and the need for altering the treatment strategy (Figure A, B, C). Open incisional biopsy provides sufficient material for microscopic diagnosis as well as immune- histochemical, cytogenetic, or electron microscopic studies. It has some disadvantages such as wound healing problems, infection, tumor cell contamination, and nerve and vessel injuries (1). For open biopsies, the incision should be as small as necessary and longitudinal. Transverse incisions are not advisable. To perform an intraosseus biopsy, the window should be circular or oblong, and as small as needed to prevent a pathologic fracture. Closing this window by PMMA prevents tumor cell contamination. Compressing the PMMA exceeds the chance of metastasis. As a rule, culture what you biopsy and biopsy what you culture. Use of a tourniquet without exsanguinations helps better visualization and meticulous hemostasis which prevents spreading of the tumor cells in hematoma. Importantly, it should be deflated before closing the wound (3). The port of entry of drains, if necessary, must be in line and proximity to the skin incision, because this tract is also contaminated and must be excised with the surgical specimen. Imaging-guided core needle biopsy is a well-established technique for the diagnosis of bone and soft tissue tumors and tumor-like lesions in specialized orthopedic oncology centers. Although large lesions of the limbs can easily be biopsied without image guidance, lesions in the spine, para spinal area, and pelvis are difficult to target, therefore taking the advantage of C. T. guidance will improve the accuracy of targeting the lesion for biopsy purposes. We can benefit from image intensifiers for targeting limb lesions rather than C. T. guidance. Also sonographic guide can be applied for soft tissue lesions (Figure D, E, F). In soft tissue tumors, the results of percutaneous CNB are relatively inferior compared to open biopsy whereas almost equal results are expected for bony tumors except for low-grade chondrosarcoma. CNB is a safe, minimally invasive, and cost effective technique for the diagnosis of bone lesions if done by an experienced orthopedic oncologic surgeon and be evaluated by an experienced <b>anatomical</b> bone <b>pathologist</b> (1, 3). For soft tissue tumors, CNB results depend on the size of the lesion, its location and amount of tumor necrosis. Guided needle biopsy have become the standard technique in most orthopedic oncologic centers. The accuracy of this method in our center is more than 90 % for bone tumors. Cores should be taken in different directions including areas of central necrotic tissues but from a single well planned entrance. The procedure is quick, especially for bone CNB or soft tissue FNA and CNB, and the diagnosis can be achieved within 24 – 48 hours. The material should be sufficient for immunohistochemistry evaluations as well (1 - 3). Because I have seen 3 cases of tumor implantation at the towel clips puncture site including 2 chondrosarcomas and a case of malignant schowanoma, so I highly suggest that never crush the skin by towel clips especially when you do an open incisional biopsy (4). In summery open, needle or core biopsies should be performed by a surgeon who is responsible for definitive surgery of a tumor after complete staged evaluation to minimize the biopsy complications if we expect a successful outcome and longer survival (1 - 3) ...|$|R
