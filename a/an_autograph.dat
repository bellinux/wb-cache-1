5|$|The {{original}} {{scenario for}} the short involved a magician who incorporates <b>an</b> <b>autograph</b> seeking rabbit into his act after his previous rabbit leaves him. Complications arise as the new rabbit suffers from stage fright. Sweetland compared it to the plot of A Star Is Born. The idea was reworked due to being too long and complicated, taking an estimated three minutes longer to tell.|$|E

5|$|For her thirteenth {{birthday}} on 12 June 1942, Frank {{received a}} book she had shown {{her father in}} a shop window a few days earlier. Although it was <b>an</b> <b>autograph</b> book, bound with red-and-white checkered cloth and with a small lock on the front, Frank decided she would {{use it as a}} diary, and she began writing in it almost immediately. In her entry dated 20 June 1942, she lists many of the restrictions placed upon the lives of the Dutch Jewish population.|$|E

Greenwald is {{one of the stars of}} the wrestling documentary, Bloodstained Memoirs.|$|E
5|$|Scholars cannot {{pinpoint}} the exact date of composition. Orm wrote his book {{over a period}} of decades and the manuscript shows signs of multiple corrections through time (Burchfield 1987, p.280). Since it is apparently <b>an</b> <b>autograph,</b> with two of the three hands in the text generally believed by scholars to be Orm's own, the date of the manuscript and the date of composition would have been the same. On the evidence of the third hand (that of a collaborator who entered the pericopes at the head of each homily) it is thought that the manuscript was finished circa 1180, but Orm may have begun the work as early as 1150 (Parkes 1983, pp.115–27). The text has few topical references to specific events {{that could be used to}} identify the period of composition more precisely.|$|E

5|$|To promote Party Never Ends, {{a series}} of concerts were held in Norway in November 2012. The record was further {{promoted}} by a tour in the United States in Detroit, New York, Chicago, Washington, D.C. and Los Angeles. During another tour in Mexico, Inna visited Mexico City, Leon, Chihuahua, Ciudad Juarez and a festival in Acapulco. When choosing her wardrobe, the singer was inspired by Mexican culture and Mexican painter Frida Kahlo. The final concert at the Auditorio Nacional was sold out, with an attendance of 10,000 people. During promotional endeavors, the singer also had appearances on television and radio stations, and attended <b>an</b> <b>autograph</b> session with over 1,500 fans.|$|E
5|$|Van der Weyden was preoccupied by {{commissioned}} portraiture {{towards the}} end of his life and was highly regarded by later generations of painters for his penetrating evocations of character. In this work, the woman's humility and reserved demeanour are conveyed through her fragile physique, lowered eyes and tightly grasped fingers. She is slender and depicted according to the Gothic ideal of elongated features, indicated by her narrow shoulders, tightly pinned hair, high forehead and the elaborate frame set by the headdress. It is the only known portrait of a woman accepted as <b>an</b> <b>autograph</b> work by van der Weyden, yet the sitter's name is not recorded and he did not title the work.|$|E
5|$|At home, Bart {{comes up}} with a {{character}} called Angry Dad, based on the frequent angry outbursts of his father, Homer. Bart rolls out the first issue of Angry Dad, which becomes a hit with the kids in school. During <b>an</b> <b>autograph</b> signing session in the schoolyard, Bart is approached by a spokesman for an Internet entertainment site. He wants to make Angry Dad into an online animated cartoon series, and Bart agrees in exchange for stock. The cartoon becomes an Internet hit, becoming the single most popular non-pornographic website of all time. The only one still unaware of Angry Dad is Homer, who finds out one day at work. Once the humiliated Homer gets home, he finds Bart and strangles him. Marge and Lisa stops him and calms him down, and Homer agrees to suppress his anger from that point on.|$|E

5|$|However, Russell also {{received}} negative attention. Constantly provoked by New York Knicks center Ray Felix during a game, he complained to coach Auerbach. The latter {{told him to}} take matters into his own hands, so after the next provocation, Russell punched Felix unconscious, paid a $25 fine and was no longer a target of cheap fouls. With his teammates, Russell had a cordial relationship, with the notable exception of fellow rookie and old rival Heinsohn. Heinsohn felt that Russell resented him because the former was named the 1957 NBA Rookie of the Year: many people thought that Russell was more important, but Russell also had only played half the season. Russell also ignored Heinsohn's plea to give his cousin <b>an</b> <b>autograph,</b> and openly said to Heinsohn that he deserved half of his $300 Rookie of the Year check. The relationship between the two rookies remained reserved. On the other hand, despite their different ethnic backgrounds and lack of common off-court interests, his relationship with Celtics point guard and fan favorite Bob Cousy was amicable.|$|E
