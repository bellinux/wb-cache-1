5|$|That same year, a {{group of}} liberal ministers {{composed}} a statement defending their theological views known as the Auburn Affirmation {{due to the fact}} that it was based on the work of Robert Hastings Nichols of Auburn Seminary. Citing the Adopting Act of 1729, the Affirmation claimed for the PCUSA a heritage of doctrinal liberty. It also argued that church doctrine could only be established by action of the General Assembly and a majority of presbyteries; therefore, according to the Affirmation, the General Assembly acted unconstitutionally when it required <b>adherence</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> five fundamentals.|$|E

This study aimed to identify dietary patterns, and to examine their associations with general (body mass index) and central (waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio) obesity in community-living elderly in a Brazilian city. Methods: this cross-sectional study included 126 elderly subjects aged 60 or older (57. 1 % females and mean age 74. 2 &# 177; 6. 46 years). Anthropometric variables, weight, height, waist (WC) and hip (HC) circumferences, were measured. Body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) were calculated. Answers to a Food Frequency Questionnaire were interpreted by Principal Component Analysis in order to identify dietary patterns. Results: five dietary patterns were identified and named as prudent (fruit, vegetables and meat), sweets and fats (pastries, sugary foods, fatty foods, whole milk), typical Brazilian (fried eggs, cooked beans, beef, candy, string beans, fried cassava), Mediterranean (fruit, vegetables, olive oil and nuts) and traditional meal (rice and beans). Moderate and high <b>adherences</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Mediterranean pattern were protective factors to general and central obesity (WHR).

Lieutenant governor Linn Boyd had died in office, and Magoffin refused to allow Speaker of the Senate John F. Fisk to succeed him as governor. Accordingly, Fisk resigned and the Kentucky Senate elected Magoffin's choice, James F. Robinson, as speaker.
