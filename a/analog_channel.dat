5|$|VK3RTV is an {{experimental}} Amateur Television repeater located on Mt Dandenong {{to the east}} of Melbourne. In late September 2009 the former single <b>analog</b> <b>channel</b> was converted to a 2 channel digital system. The output of the transmitter is on 446.5MHz which can be received on some set top boxes and digital televisions. Both channels are transmitted in standard definition.|$|E

PBS member station WCNY-TV in Syracuse operates translator W22DO-D on <b>analog</b> <b>channel</b> 22 and digital channel 24. Several low-power television stations, such as WPNY-LP 11 (MyNetworkTV), also broadcast in the area. Cable television viewers are served by the Syracuse office of Charter Communications (doing business as Charter Spectrum), which offers a local news service, a local sports channel, and public-access channels. Dish Network and DirecTV provide satellite television customers with local broadcast channels.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We explore several {{fundamental}} {{questions at the}} intersection of sampling theory and information theory: how is channel capacity affected by sampling below the channel's Nyquist rate, and what is the optimal input and sampling strategy at a given sub-Nyquist sampling rate. In particular, we derive the capacity of sampled <b>analog</b> <b>channels</b> for several sampling mechanisms, including a filter followed by sampling and a filter bank followed by sampling. Connections between sampling and MIMO Gaussian channels are illuminated based on this analysis. These results demonstrate the tradeoff between channel capacity and sampling rate, and also illustrate the interplay between sampling techniques and capacity of sampled <b>analog</b> <b>channels.</b> Index Terms—sampled <b>analog</b> <b>channels,</b> sub-Nyquist sampling, channel capacity I...|$|R

50|$|In the 2000s (decade), {{the analog}} {{national}} and autonomic channels started simulcast on Digital Terrestrial Television. In 2005, Canal+ stopped its analog service {{to move to}} Digital Plus and was substituted by Cuatro. Some weeks later, the last <b>analog</b> national private <b>channel,</b> La Sexta, started testing broadcasts, to begin its regular analog schedule in 2006. In 2009, the analog service started its closure {{in a process that}} lasted one year.

25|$|WTVR-TV is a CBS-affiliated {{television}} station licensed to Richmond, Virginia, United States. The station {{is owned by}} Tribune Broadcasting, a subsidiary of Tribune Media Company. It broadcasts a high definition digital signal on UHF channel 25, using the virtual channel assignment of 6.1 via PSIP (to associate it with its 60-year former position on <b>analog</b> <b>channel</b> 6), and its studios and transmitter are located on West Broad Street in the West End {{of the city of}} Richmond. The tower is also the transmitter for former sister station WTVR-FM and NPR member WCVE-FM.|$|E

The station shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 8, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal continued to broadcasts on its pre-transition VHF channel 9.

25|$|WTVJ ended {{programming}} on its analog signal, on VHF channel 6, on June 12, 2009, {{the official}} date in which full-power television {{stations in the}} United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal continued to broadcasts on its pre-transition UHF channel 31. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's's virtual channel as its former VHF <b>analog</b> <b>channel</b> 6. After the transition, the station moved its main transmitter from the former WCIX tower site in Homestead to a facility on the Broward–Dade county line, bringing WTVJ's signal on par with the other Miami television stations {{for the first time}} in fourteen years.|$|E
2500|$|A mixed-signal {{oscilloscope}} (or MSO) has {{two kinds}} of inputs, {{a small number of}} <b>analog</b> <b>channels</b> (typically two or four), and a larger number of digital channels(typically sixteen). [...] It provides the ability to accurately time-correlate <b>analog</b> and digital <b>channels,</b> thus offering a distinct advantage over a separate oscilloscope and logic analyser. Typically, digital channels may be grouped and displayed as a bus with each bus value displayed {{at the bottom of the}} display in hex or binary. [...] On most MSOs, the trigger can be set across both <b>analog</b> and digital <b>channels.</b>|$|R
50|$|On cable {{television}} systems, analog-digital simulcasting (ADS) means that <b>analog</b> <b>channels</b> are duplicated as digital subchannels. Digital tuners are programmed {{to use the}} digital subchannel instead of the analog. This allows for smaller, cheaper cable boxes by eliminating the analog tuner and some analog circuitry. On DVRs, it {{eliminates the need for}} an MPEG encoder to convert the analog signal to digital for recording. The primary advantage is the elimination of interference, and as <b>analog</b> <b>channels</b> are dropped, the ability to put 10 or more SDTV (or two HDTV, or various other combinations) channels in its place. The primary drawback is the common problem of over-compression (quantity over quality) resulting in fuzzy pictures and pixelation.|$|R

25|$|In July 2009, {{the station}} applied with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to operate three {{repeater}} signals: channel 21 in Derry Township {{which was not}} used and the permit has expired, channel 23 in Uniontown, and channel 33 in New Castle. The signal in Derry Township was expected to cover all of Westmoreland County, while the Uniontown signal could penetrate into the Pittsburgh suburb of McKeesport. The New Castle signal might go into Youngstown, Ohio (which New Castle is much closer to despite {{being part of the}} Pittsburgh DMA) and serve as a secondary NBC affiliate for the Youngstown television market, which is primarily served by WFMJ-TV, while giving the Youngstown market an outlet for MeTV. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the virtual channels of its main signal and its three repeaters as its former VHF <b>analog</b> <b>channel</b> 11.|$|E
2500|$|WTVR-TV {{shut down}} its analog signal, over VHF channel 6, {{in the late}} morning of June 12, 2009, after more than 60 years, the {{official}} date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 25. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers continues to display the station's virtual channel as its former VHF <b>analog</b> <b>channel</b> 6.1. [...] Prior to the transition, the audio component of WTVR's <b>analog</b> <b>channel</b> 6 signal at 87.75MHz had been heavily promoted as available to listeners tuning to 87.7 on a standard FM radio receiver. WTVR lost this benefit of the <b>analog</b> <b>channel</b> 6 allocation when analog transmission ended.

40|$|A remote data {{acquisition}} chassis, called a HOTLink Rack Monitor, HRM, {{has been developed}} {{for use in the}} Fermilab control system. This chassis provides for 64 <b>analog</b> input <b>channels,</b> 8 <b>analog</b> output <b>channels,</b> and 8 bytes of digital I/O. The interface to the host VMEbus crate is by way of a 320 MHz HOTLink serial connection to a PMC mezzanine module. With no processor intervention, all data sources in the remote chassis are read at 100 microsec intervals, timestamped, and stored in a 2 MB circular buffer on the PMC module. In operation, the memory always contains the most recent 16 k samples of 10 kHz data from all 64 <b>analog</b> input <b>channels.</b> An expansion module that resides in the HRM chassis records snapshot data for 8 <b>analog</b> <b>channels,</b> each channel consisting of up to 16 k readings, digitized at rates up to 10 MHz. Snapshot data is also returned and stored in buffers on the PMC module. Because the HRM presents a memory-mapped interface to the host, it is independent of the operating system and may be used in any system that supports PMC mezzanine modules.
