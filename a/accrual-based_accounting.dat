The entire project {{is based on the assumption}} that the “superiority of the accruals principle, whether for macro or micro fiscal monitoring, is indisputable” (EC, 2013, p. 6). The paper offers critical perspective on the possible adoption of the European Public Sector Accounting Standards (EPSAS) inspired by the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS). More specifically, the paper deals with the theoretical concepts of harmonization, standardization, and unification, as defined by the international accounting literature, with a view to identify the possible consequences of the public accounting unification process that is going to be promoted by the EU. In the European Union perspective, accounting unification is a desirable outcome, a pre-condition for attaining, measuring, controlling, and demonstrating budgetary equilibrium, according to a strictly rational logic consistent with a functionalist perspective of public sector accounting. Such an approach, it is argued in the paper, leads to a misunderstanding of public sector accounting, which is considered as a neutral technology whereas it is actually a tool of commensuration with a strong influence on the economic and political life of social communities, since it generates interpretative categories and contributes to change social relationships and values prioritization...|$|R

As additions to the traditional cash-based budgetary accounting, the system now includes <b>accrual-based</b> financial <b>accounting</b> and reporting, as well as cost accounting. The keystone for the changes was the Chart of Accounts for Local Government, issued in 1999 {{as a consequence of}} a wider reform process (comprising administrative, financial management and accounting issues) started in 1990 for the whole Portuguese Public Administration. This thesis describes how the Portuguese local government accounting system currently works, specifically addressing budgetary, financial and cost accounting techniques. Using Lüder’s Financial Management Reform Process Model, it also explains the current innovations in the Portuguese governmental accounting, and presents the context within which the reforms have been taking place. The same framework is used to predict the conduciveness to future developments, providing some insights into the probability of further reforms. Finally, it offers an inductive theory of Portuguese local government accounting in comparative-international perspective, in comparison with the United Kingdom.

It aimed to explain the extent earnings, accruals, EBITDA and operating cash flows are able to predict listed Malaysian industrial products manufacturing corporations’ operating cash flows. Ordinary least squares method was used to develop fifteen multiple linear regression models in examining {{up to three years}} of prediction horizon. Current operating cash flows, as proxy for future operating cash flows, are regressed on past one, two and three years of earnings, operating cash flows, operating cash flows combined with aggregated/disaggregated accruals and EBITDA as predictors. The sample was collected from annual financial statements of 97 listed corporations from 1999 to 2009 (11 years) and categorised into two subsamples; the within sample (1999 to 2008) to develop the models and the holdout sample (2009) to validate the robustness of the models. Results from the regression analyses revealed that all the accounting measures examined have significant predictive abilities but differing powers. Earnings are superior to operating cash flows but EBITDA are stronger than both earnings and operating cash flows while the operating cash flows have the weakest predictive powers. The model comprising of both operating cash flows and disaggregated accrual components have the strongest predictive abilities. This suggests that disaggregating earnings into operating cash flows and accruals and further decomposing the aggregated accruals into the individual accrual components enhance the predictive abilities. These findings revealed that accruals have incremental explanatory powers beyond that contained in operating cash flows and disaggregated accrual components provided incremental explanatory powers exceeding that provided by aggregated accruals. Aggregated earnings masked the contributions of each accrual component. Disaggregating earnings and further decomposing the aggregated accruals unmask the contributions and effects of each accrual component. As individual predictors, both earnings and accruals have the significant abilities to predict future operating cash flows for only one year-ahead (short term), EBITDA can predict up to two years-ahead (medium term) and operating cash flows can predict up to three years-ahead (long term) ...|$|R

However, the suitability of <b>accrual-based</b> <b>accounting</b> in the public sector are debatable based on the experience of pioneer countries of accruals. This study explores the perceptions of Malaysian public managers on the applicability of accrual accounting concept in the public sector and the usefulness of accrual-based governmental financial reports towards the public managers in discharging their duties. Besides, this study also highlights the neutral response upon the study. This study finds that there are significant differences between the responses from three different level of government sector on the reporting entity of a consolidated report, the definition and concept of controlled assets by public entities and the use of accumulated surplus and equity as a financial performance indicator. In addition, the study indicates that familiarity and experience over time will contribute to higher perceptions towards the usefulness of accrual-based information. Furthermore, the neutral response from the respondents suggests that an in-depth discussion between the public sector managers and experts from the accounting field to improve the understanding among the Malaysian public sector managers. Hence, this study provides useful insights to the standard setters in the process of MPSAS formulation with regards to the general purpose financial reporting model for the public sector in Malaysia.

30|$|Consistent {{with the}} {{aforementioned}} research issues, the following subsections exhibit the core {{issues of the}} concept exploration. First, the conceptual scheme of ‘accounting archetypes’ serves the purpose of differentiating the directed outcome state of <b>accrual-based</b> <b>accounting</b> change at the organizational level, in particular outlined as the contextual setting where (strategic) HRM activities occur. Second, the framing develops a more comprehensive approach to distinguishing patterns of (strategic) HR systems, furthermore classified as the dependent construct in the analysis. Finally, the antecedent factors shaping HR strategy formation are identified. From a resource and capability-based view, the complementarity and co-evolution of organizational change interventions and the HRM role are emphasized to uncover sequential outcome states that stress both the (strategic) pattern of HRM activities in place {{and how it is}} aligned with the strategic issues of managing a (large system) change, {{as in the case of}} accounting change in German local governments.|$|E
30|$|The {{previous}} {{analysis has}} outlined that <b>accrual-based</b> <b>accounting</b> introduction in local governments incorporates ‘corporate’ change interventions and, thereby, {{a set of}} possible consequences for HRD systems, in particular concerning rigidities associated with the portfolio of required resource investments. The results provided further evidence that the outcome state of HRD system changes is linked with strategic HR activities, respectively, enacting the role of HR change agency in terms of either an individual or group assigned {{to be responsible for}} leading HR-related processes. Hence, the outcome state remained ambiguous because of a ‘performing–learning’ tension (Smith and Lewis 2011) associated with the ‘delegation’-effect: at first glance, the uncertainty of performing (strategic) HRM activities associated with the devolution of HR managerial responsibility to the public service level, and, subsequently, that enacting HR change agency rests on the learning efforts to adjust HR systems within the enabling setting of accounting change interventions. Thus, the final step of analysis aims to explore how the HRD system changes emerge.|$|E

Alternative 'behavioural persistence' and 'regression to the mean' hypotheses about the determinants of underfunding practices are formulated and tested using an OECD data set describing the financial and socio-economic characteristics of government-sponsored public pension systems in these countries. Consistent with the behavioural persistence hypothesis, cross-sectional variations are found {{to be associated with the}} funding ratio and the rate of taxation required to keep government debt constant.

40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is {{artificial}} earnings management in municipalities. Its occurrence {{is linked to the}} premise that politicians act in a political market and therefore have incentives to affect the picture of the municipality’s finances presented to presumptive voters and other stakeholders. The regulation, including a balanced budget requirement, can also create incentives to engage in artificial earnings management. When surpluses or deficits are managed, resources are shifted between different accounting periods, which can help create scope for political action. Vote-maximizing politicians can exploit this scope to attract voters through promises of future reforms. The occurrence of artificial earnings management in at least some municipalities and situations must, in light of political self-interest, be regarded as expected. But why artificial earnings management occurs in some municipalities but not in others, and why the extent of artificial earnings management varies is not as clear-cut. Earlier research either stops at pointing out individual cases and describing and problematizing the phenomenon, or at studying a very limited number of factors that may explain why the phenomenon occurs and varies in extent. In relation to the reforms in the field of municipal accounting, where Sweden and many other OECD countries have changed from cash-based accounting to <b>accrual-based</b> <b>accounting</b> in public sector, it is relevant {{to find out more about}} the artificial earnings management that occurs and thus add to the limited literature in the field. By finding out more about artificial earnings management that occurs when an <b>accrual-based</b> <b>accounting</b> model is applied, it can create understanding of the phenomenon and how it can be handled in future accounting reforms and thus, for example, improve conditions for attaining the goals of the reforms, such as better decision input and political accountability. A case study and a quantitative study were performed within the framework of this thesis to explain why artificial earnings management occurs and varies in extent. The studies show that economic factors are the primary explanation for why artificial earnings management occurs but the factors of politics and civil servants also have some explanatory power. With regard to the extent of artificial earnings management, the economic factors are the only studied factors that have any explanatory power...|$|E
