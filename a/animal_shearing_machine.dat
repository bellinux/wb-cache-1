40|$|In {{this paper}} the Kamat-Riley (K-R) event-based Monte Carlo {{simulation}} method {{was used for}} reliability analysis of longwall <b>shearer</b> <b>machine.</b> <b>Shearer</b> <b>machine</b> consists of six subsystems; water, haulage, electrical, hydraulic, cutting arms and cable systems in a series network configuration. A shearer in the Tabas coal mine was selected as case study and its all failure data were collected and used for reliability analysis of subsystems. With negligible assumption of time to repair, a flowchart was built for programming the simulation process. The Matlab mathematical programming software was used for reliability simulation process. Finally the reliability plot of longwall <b>shearer</b> <b>machine</b> was achieved and upper and lower bound reliability were calculated. The results illustrate that the reliability of <b>shearer</b> <b>machine</b> reduces to zero {{in a period of}} 100 h. There is a 50 % chance that the shearer will not fail for the first 12 h of operation. Validerad; 2013; 20130815 (behzad...|$|R

50|$|Around 17million of SA 29million sheep {{are still}} blade shorn today. This {{is due to}} the {{relative}} expense of <b>machine</b> <b>shearing</b> compared to blade shearing.

50|$|During 1887, Herbert Austin joined, {{as chief}} engineer, Wolseley Sheep <b>Shearing</b> <b>Machine</b> Company Limited, {{incorporated}} in Sydney, {{a new business}} linked to R G Parks & Co, to make Wolseley's machinery in his workshops at Goldsbrough Mort & Co. Ltd Melbourne. This company was wound up in 1889 and ownership transferred to a new British company, The Wolseley Sheep <b>Shearing</b> <b>Machine</b> Company incorporated in London with a capital of £200,000. Operations remained in Australia, Austin studied the machinery while it was in use on sheep stations and made further patented improvements.

50|$|David Unaipon, Australian inventor, had {{a lifelong}} fascination with {{perpetual}} motion.

50|$|Looking {{for other}} {{products}} to even out the workload, Herbert Austin {{became interested in}} motor cars and built {{two different types of}} three-wheelers in his own time. A version of one of these was taken up by the Wolseley Sheep <b>Shearing</b> <b>Machine</b> Company and listed for sale in 1900, but the Wolseley board could see no profitable future for a motor industry. In 1901 Vickers bought Wolseley's car interests, taking Austin too, and naming the new business Wolseley Tool & Motor Company setting it up in Adderley Park, Birmingham. Herbert Austin retained his interest and ties with The Wolseley Sheep <b>Shearing</b> <b>Machine</b> Company. He was chairman of their board from 1911 to 1933, when he retired not long before his death.|$|R
50|$|Further {{diversification}} {{occurred in}} 1901 with {{the purchase of}} Herbert Austin's embryo car manufacturing plans, and Austin himself, from The Wolseley Sheep <b>Shearing</b> <b>Machine</b> Company.

50|$|Direct shear {{tests can}} be {{performed}} under several conditions. The sample is normally saturated before the test is run, but can be run at the in-situ moisture content. The rate of strain can be varied to create a test of undrained or drained conditions, depending whether the strain is applied slowly enough for water in the sample to prevent pore-water pressure buildup. Direct <b>shear</b> test <b>machine</b> is required to perform the test. The test using the direct <b>shear</b> <b>machine</b> determinates the consolidated drained shear strength of a soil material in direct shear.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{failure cause}} and failure mode of cutting tool is {{analyzed}} {{based on the}} reliability analysis on cutting tool of vertical <b>shearing</b> <b>machine.</b> Reliability calculation model is established, and experimental research on cutting tool is operated. The {{results show that the}} critical failure mode of cutting tool is electric die grinder. The crucial failure cause is that in the shearing process, the UO 2 ceramic in the fuel components is crushed into particles with high hardness, these hard material will lead to tool wear. The reliability of cutting tool is 0. 892, which can’t achieve the spent fuel reprocessing working <b>shearing</b> <b>machine</b> reliability requirements. The structure and materials of cutting tool must be improved. The parallel distance between the upper surface of cutting tool and the lower surface of the pressing block has to be adjusted...|$|R

40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{part of the}} thesis focuses on the description of particulate materials and their mechanical behaviors {{with a focus on}} flow properties.

The {{theoretical part}} focuses on the characterization of particulate matter using a variety of methods available, such as visual, separation, sedimentation, surface methods and methods of scanning field and flow. The practical part is focused on the determination of flow characteristics and surface finishing of finely ground limestone Omyacarb VA with various grain sizes. The surface was modified using stearic acid and calcium stearate. Attention was paid to the influence of the concentration of surface-regulating substances on the flowability of the material. The flowability of commercially supplied material was compared with lab modified materials and the determination of the theoretical content of stearic acid or calcium stearate was accomplished. Shear properties were measured using the Jenike <b>shear</b> <b>machine.</b> The material was further tested by laser diffraction and SEM with EDS particle surface analysis and elemental surface mapping...|$|R
