25|$|The {{amendments}} {{gave the}} General Counsel of the National Labor Relations Board discretionary power to seek injunctions against either employers or unions that violated the Act. The law made pursuit of such injunctions mandatory, rather than discretionary, {{in the case}} of secondary boycotts by unions. The amendments also established the General Counsel’s autonomy within the <b>administrative</b> <b>framework</b> of the NLRB. Congress also gave employers the right to sue unions for damages caused by a secondary boycott, but gave the General Counsel exclusive power to seek injunctive relief against such activities.|$|E
25|$|McNutt {{was very}} {{involved}} in joining the state to the new federal welfare programs. Legislation was passed to allow the state to participate in Social Security and worker's unemployment programs. Additionally, he was most active in pursuing federal jobs and created the <b>administrative</b> <b>framework</b> necessary for Indiana {{to participate in the}} Works Progress Administration programs. More than 75,000 Hoosiers were working in the government program before he left office.

Significantly, their original remit was to encompass not only Historic Monuments, but also Constructions.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{intended}} {{to contribute to the}} thinking of those involved in the management of the water in the Jordan Basin. It describes the situation as it was in 2010 with regard to water management and raises the question, “What changes may be needed if the problems posed by increase in temperature and decrease in precipitation are to be dealt with effectively?” The paper is based in part upon interviews with prominent experts from Israel, Jordan and Palestine. It presents the water management of the three national entities describing the relevant legal and <b>administrative</b> <b>frameworks</b> under which water is managed and comments on the situation with regard to day-to-day management. At the time of the underlying research all three national entities {{were in the process of}} reviewing the legal and <b>administrative</b> <b>frameworks</b> under which water is managed in the Jordan Basin. However there is little evidence that, in any of the thinking of the respective parties, attention is being given to the Basin as a whole or how to improve the existing structures for regional cooperation...|$|R

In 2011–2012, a political process providing benchmarks {{for the establishment of}} permanent democratic institutions was launched. Within this <b>administrative</b> <b>framework</b> a new provisional constitution was passed in August 2012, which reformed Somalia as a federation. Following the end of the TFG's interim mandate the same month, the Federal Government of Somalia, the first permanent central government in the country {{since the start of the}} civil war, was formed and a period of reconstruction began in Mogadishu. Somalia has maintained an informal economy, mainly based on livestock, remittances from Somalis working abroad, and telecommunications.|$|E
25|$|Initially the {{committee}} proposed an independent investigation {{board for the}} maritime sector, either {{as part of the}} Norwegian Maritime Authority or as an independent agency subordinate to the Ministry of Justice. During the political discussions a joint board was favored instead. Parliament approved the new jurisdiction in 2004. However, it took four years to implement the decision, and nine years from the conclusions of {{the committee}} were presented. The delays were caused by the legal implications and complexity of the investigations. Because the board was only to investigate from a safety point of view, a new legal and <b>administrative</b> <b>framework</b> had to be implemented to ensure that the Norwegian Police Service take over the responsibility for criminal investigation of the marine accidents.|$|E
500|$|It {{was widely}} {{expected}} that Southern Rhodesia {{would eventually be}} incorporated into the Union of South Africa as its fifth province. It was generally considered part of South Africa geographically and in colonial terms, part of the British expansion into the region that had begun with the 1820 Settlers. Representatives from Rhodesia had participated in the South African National Convention of 1908 and section 150 of the South Africa Act 1909 made specific provision for the accession of BSAC territories. Coghlan had represented the interests of the Rhodesian people at the Convention, although his contribution was insignificant. The presence of the Rhodesian delegation had been supported - and even secured - by Louis Botha, who was keen to win the trust of the settlers. In November 1909, at a banquet for Lord Selborne, the departing High Commissioner in Cape Town, Coghlan spoke of the BSAC and the people of Southern Rhodesia working together towards entering the Union, though some settlers wished to enjoy what he called [...] "an artificial stage of responsible government" [...] first. Indeed, the order in council of 1898 had provided Southern Rhodesia with a constitution that resembled that of a Crown Colony with responsible government and the South Africa Act made no changes to the territory's <b>administrative</b> <b>framework.</b>|$|E

[...] Horror stories of (mis)-treatment of paupers under the New Poor Law not only featured in the speeches of its opponents; they also circulated in Chartist newspapers such as Augustus Beaumont's Northern Liberator and Feargus O'Connor's Northern Star and were collected in George R.

[...] Not all the stories were entirely accurate, and some propaganda was very black; a document recommending infanticide and alleged to {{be the work of}} the Poor Law Commission was published as the Book of Murder.|$|E

50|$|In Peter Zinoman’s {{study of}} the colonial prison system in Vietnam (1862-1940), he situates prisons as {{decentralized}} and autonomous institutions ran in different territories in Annam, Tonkin, Cochinchina, Cambodia and Laos due to different legal and <b>administrative</b> <b>frameworks,</b> low budgets, and unprofessional staff (divided into small European administrative elite and a large corps of Vietnamese warders) running the prisons. Zinoman argues that the colonial prison was ill-disciplined. The rehabilitative orientation within colonial punishment was absent as there was no discernible effort to reform the prisoners by discipline or provision of “total care”.|$|R

2500|$|The Local Government Finance Act 1988, with {{follow-up}} legislation, {{provided a}} fresh <b>administrative</b> <b>framework</b> for assessing and billing, {{but did not}} redefine the legal unit of property, the hereditament, that had been developed through rating case law. Properties are assessed in a rating list with a rateable value, a valuation of their annual rental value on a fixed valuation date using assumptions fixed by statute. [...] Rating lists are created and maintained by the Valuation Office Agency, a UK Government Executive Agency. Rating lists can be altered either to reflect changes in properties, or as valuations are appealed against. New rating lists are normally created every five years, however, the 2015 revaluation has been postponed until 2017.|$|E
2500|$|The Poor Law Commission {{intended}} (or {{said they}} intended) {{to allow the}} new Poor Law Boards in manufacturing areas to continue out-door relief, but opponents of the New Poor Law held that the safest way to defend out-door relief {{and the rest of}} the status quo was to prevent the New Poor Law <b>administrative</b> <b>framework</b> becoming established. [...] Hence they strove to prevent new Poor Law Boards being established (or to elect Guardians hostile to the New Poor Law who would obstruct or delay clerks to Poor Law Boards being appointed), since their existence would allow the Poor Law Commission to specify changes in the regime of existing poorhouses and greatly facilitate the cessation of out-door relief should the Commission change its mind ( [...] or not be telling the truth).|$|E
2500|$|Izard {{worked to}} whip the militia into shape. He and Brigadier General Bradford pleaded with local commanders {{to take their}} {{responsibilities}} seriously. Noting that Arkansas lay directly in the path {{to be used in}} the removal of the Eastern Indians, the governor spoke frequently of the need [...] "to place the Militia in a condition to afford immediate protection to our settlements, should any disorder attend the passage of those people." [...] Governor Izard's agitation slowly began to get results. In 1825 the legislature authorized the printing of the militia laws of the territory, with a copy of each to go to every officer in the militia. Izard issued three militia reorganization plans in his three years as governor. He worked to regularize musters, established a regimental organization, and tried to improve the officer corps by forcing the resignation of officers who failed to attend musters, left the territory for more than three months, or who failed to send their strength reports. Finally, in November 1827, a bill passed providing for the first complete overhauling of the militia. The act organized the forces into two separate brigades, provided that battalions were to muster annually and companies were to assemble twice yearly, and established an <b>administrative</b> <b>framework</b> to oversee the organization. Izard's periodic reorganization orders, combined with legislation, resulted in the formation of a much more effective militia system for Arkansas Territory.|$|E
