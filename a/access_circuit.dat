Materials and MethodsTwo hundred seventy-five patients were randomized at 23 US sites to stent-graft placement or percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA). Primary study endpoints were <b>access</b> <b>circuit</b> primary patency (ACPP) at 6 months and safety through 30 days; secondary endpoints were evaluated through 24 months. ResultsACPP at 6 months was significantly higher in the stent-graft group (18. 6 %) versus the PTA group (4. 5 %; P <. 001), and freedom from safety events (30 days) was comparable (stent graft, 96. 9 %; PTA, 96. 4 %; P =. 003 for noninferiority). The separation in ACPP survival curves remained through 12 months (stent graft, 6. 2 %; PTA, 1. 5 %). Treatment area primary patency (TAPP) was superior for the stent-graft group (66. 4 %) versus the PTA group (12. 3 %) at 6 months (P <. 001), with a survivorship difference in favor of stent-graft placement maintained through 24 months (stent graft, 15. 6 %; PTA, 2. 2 %). ACPP and TAPP for the stent-graft group were better than those for the PTA group when compared within central and peripheral vein subgroups (P <. 001). In central veins, TAPP was 13. 6 % in the stent-graft group versus 4. 3 % in the PTA group at 24 months (P <. 001).

40|$|Abstract [...] Enterprise access links remain {{bottlenecks}} even as LAN and WAN link rates increase. We verified {{this with}} an Internet traffic measurement study on our university's access link, which is presented here. To solve the problem, we propose a service called DUE (Dial-Up Ethernet). The service concept {{is to provide}} end hosts with a high-speed <b>access</b> <b>circuit</b> on a call-by-call shared basis. The DUE circuits map Ethernet segments at the end hosts into Ethernet-over-SONET signals and connect the end hosts directly to the IP router of the enterprise's Internet Service Provider (ISP). This results in lowered packet loss rates on the access link and thus translates into lower mean file transfer delays. The DUE service is proposed as an add-on to the primary Internet access service already available to enterprise hosts. If the circuit setup fails, the end host will fall back to the primary access link. If the circuit setup is successful, the end host will enjoy a much better performance on file transfer delays. For example, a 100 MB file transfer on a primary TCP/IP path with a round-trip propagation delay of 50 ms, the bottleneck link rate of 100 Mbps, and a packet loss rate of 0. 01 takes 441. 535 sec, while via an DUE circuit with the same bottleneck link rate and a reduced packet loss rate of 0. 00001, the transfer time is 10. 01 sec. To determine {{the conditions under which}} an end host with access to DUE service should attempt circuit setup, we analyze mean file transfer delays as a function of call blocking probabilities in the access network, packet loss rates on the end-to-end path, round-trip propagation delays, link rates, etc...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveTo {{compare the}} results of stent graft {{placement}} to balloon angioplasty {{for the treatment of}} stenosis at the venous anastomosis of failing and thrombosed prosthetic hemodialysis grafts. MethodsThis prospective, multicenter trial included 293 patients randomized (1 : 1) to the stent graft (n = 145) or balloon angioplasty (n = 148) group for treatment of stenosis at the venous anastomosis of dysfunctional (n = 164) or thrombosed (n = 129) hemodialysis grafts. The primary study end point was target lesion primary patency at 6  months; participants were followed for up to 24  months. Primary patency of the <b>access</b> <b>circuit</b> was a secondary end point. Statistical analysis of effectiveness was performed using both the intent-to-treat population and the effectiveness-per-protocol (EPP) populations for primary patency end points. Statistical analysis of additional effectiveness end points was performed using the EPP population. ResultsThe 6 -month target lesion primary patency was statistically greater in the stent graft group than the balloon angioplasty group (intent-to-treat, 51. 6 % vs 34. 2 % [P =. 006]; EPP, 52. 9 % vs 35. 5 % [P =. 008]). Compared with the angioplasty group, the stent graft group increased the median time from the index procedure to the next intervention on the target lesion by 95  days (203 vs 108 days). Patients with dysfunctional (stenotic) grafts had higher target lesion primary patency compared with patients with thrombosed grafts regardless of treatment (EPP, stent graft, 64. 6 % vs 36. 1 % and balloon angioplasty, 45. 8 % vs 23. 5 %). When compared with angioplasty, using a stent graft for treatment of a venous anastomotic stenosis of a thrombosed graft increased the 6 -month target lesion primary patency by 53. 6 % (EPP, 36. 1 % vs 23. 5 %). ConclusionsWhen compared with balloon angioplasty, a stent graft provided superior target lesion primary patency at 6  months for treatment of venous anastomotic stenoses of dysfunctional and thrombosed prosthetic hemodialysis grafts...|$|E

40|$|Debugging {{electronic}} circuits is traditionally done with bench equipment {{directly connected to}} the circuit under debug. In the digital domain, the difficulties associated with the direct physical <b>access</b> to <b>circuit</b> nodes led to the inclusion of resources providing support to that activity, first at the printed circuit level, {{and then at the}} integrated circuit level. The experience acquired with those solutions led to the emergence of dedicated infrastructures for debugging cores at the system-on-chip level. However, all these developments had a small impact in the analog and mixed-signal domain, where debugging still depends, to a large extent, on direct physical <b>access</b> to <b>circuit</b> nodes. As a consequence, when analog and mixed-signal circuits are integrated as cores inside a system-on-chip, the difficulties associated with debugging increase, which cause the time-to-market and the prototype verification costs to also increase.

This study evaluated the efficacy and durability of covered stents in treating CVOD to preserve a functional dialysis <b>access</b> <b>circuit.</b> MethodsA retrospective review was performed of all patients with clinically significant CVOD who were treated by placement of covered stents from April 2007 to September 2010. Demographics, lesion locations and anatomic characteristics, stent graft, and access patency rates were determined. Complications, reinterventions, and factors influencing their outcomes were examined. ResultsIn 25 patients (56 % men; mean age, 57 ± 29 years) with CVOD, covered stents were used in 20 to treat symptomatic venous hypertension or in 5 {{at the time of}} access creation to enable functionality. The target lesion was accessed via the dialysis access site or the common femoral vein. The Viabahn endoprosthesis (W. L. Gore and Associates, Flagstaff, Ariz) was used in 24 patients (average size and length, 11 mm × 5 cm) and a 13 -mm × 5 -cm Fluency covered stent (Bard Peripheral Vascular, Tempe, Ariz) was implanted in 1 patient. Technical success was 100 %, and resolution of arm edema occurred after covered stent deployment in symptomatic patients. Two postprocedural cases (8 %) of thrombosis occurred, one within 30 days and another at 3 months. Both required percutaneous thrombectomy and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA). Three additional patients (12 %) required PTA due to restenosis in one of the ends of the device. Covered stent primary patency (PP), assisted primary patency (APP), and secondary patency (SP) were 56 %, 86 %, and 100 % at 12 months, respectively. Access patency rates at 12 months were 29 %, 85 %, and 94 % for PP, APP, and SP, respectively, in patients that received a covered stent for access salvage; patency rates were 74 %, 85 %, and 94 % for PP, APP, and SP, respectively, in patients in whom the access was created after the venous outflow restoration. ConclusionsPlacement of covered stents for hemodialysis-related CVOD is safe, effective in relieving symptoms, and enabled functionality of new dialysis access circuits. Further prospective and randomized studies are necessary to determine whether covered stents provide superior long-term results to those achieved with PTA and bare metal stents...|$|E
