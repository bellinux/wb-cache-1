5|$|As of 2004, hunting was {{restricted}} to a few animals each year off the Caribbean island of Bequia in the nation of St. Vincent and the Grenadines.

5|$|The island came to {{prominence}} in the late 18th century <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>visit</b> by Sir Joseph Banks. He and his fellow-travellers extolled {{the natural beauty of}} the basalt columns in general and of the island's main sea cavern, which Banks renamed 'Fingal's Cave'. Their visit was followed by those of many other prominent personalities throughout the next two centuries, including Queen Victoria and Felix Mendelssohn. The latter's Hebrides Overture brought further fame to the island, which was by then uninhabited. It is now in the care of the National Trust for Scotland.|$|E
5|$|After {{his term}} in the Senate, Rowan {{returned}} to Kentucky, where he served as {{the first president of}} the Louisville Medical Institute and the Kentucky Historical Society. In 1840, he was appointed to a commission to prosecute land claims of U.S. citizens against the Republic of Mexico, but resigned his commission in 1842 because of failing health. He died July 13, 1843 and was buried on the grounds of Federal Hill, his estate in Bardstown. According to tradition, Stephen Collins Foster, a distant relative of Rowan's, was inspired to write the ballad My Old Kentucky Home <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>visit</b> to Federal Hill in 1852, but later historians have been unable to conclude whether or not Foster ever visited the mansion at all. The mansion is now owned by the state of Kentucky and forms the centerpiece of My Old Kentucky Home State Park.|$|E

The warship arrived at Cavite on 27 May and resumed patrols on 3 June. She spent another seven months conducting patrols in the Philippines and supporting the Army’s operations in the island chain. On 3 January 1901, she departed Cavite and shaped a course for Hong Kong. The gunboat arrived in that British colony on the 6th and began over six months of repairs. At the completion of that work, she departed Hong Kong on 25 June. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>visit</b> to Shanghai, the warship headed back to the United States in July and arrived at the Mare Island Navy Yard on 19 August. She was decommissioned there on 5 September 1901.|$|E
5|$|Born in Tivoli, near Rome, Segrè studied {{engineering}} at the University of Rome La Sapienza before taking up physics in 1927. Segrè was appointed assistant {{professor of physics at}} the University of Rome in 1932 and worked there until 1936, becoming one of the Via Panisperna boys. From 1936 to 1938 he was director of the Physics Laboratory at the University of Palermo. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>visit</b> to Ernest O. Lawrence's Berkeley Radiation Laboratory, he was sent a molybdenum strip from the laboratory's cyclotron deflector in 1937, which was emitting anomalous forms of radioactivity. After careful chemical and theoretical analysis, Segrè was able to prove that some of the radiation was being produced by a previously unknown element, named technetium, which was the first artificially synthesized chemical element that does not occur in nature.|$|E
5|$|Coleridge {{began writing}} The Eolian Harp on 20 August 1795 during his {{engagement}} to Sara Fricker. Like his previous poem Lines Written at Shurton Bars, the poem discusses both his engagement and his future marriage. Coleridge {{was inspired to}} write the poem <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>visit</b> to a house in Clevedon that would serve as his and Fricker's home after their marriage. As Coleridge worked on the poem, he and Fricker were married and they moved to the Clevedon home. During this time, Coleridge held an idealised view of his life with Fricker, and these thoughts work {{their way into the}} poem. The poem was published in the 1796 edition of Coleridge's poems and in all subsequent collections. Of his poems for the 1796 collection, Coleridge felt that The Eolian Harp was his favourite.|$|E
50|$|Among {{the most}} monumental of the Icelandic manuscripts thus {{collected}} is the Flateyjarbók, which was secured only <b>after</b> <b>a</b> personal <b>visit</b> {{to the owner}} from Brynjólfur.

The manuscript was given to King Frederick III in 1656, and placed in the Royal Library of Copenhagen.|$|R
50|$|Havilah {{took its}} name <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>visiting</b> clergyman {{discovered}} specks of gold and, citing Genesis, named the area the 'land of Havilah'. The farm was first owned by Nicholas Paget Bayly (1814-1879) and was sold {{after his death}} to Henry Charles White (1837-1905). The farm is renowned for a history of producing high quality merino sheep and horses. The homestead has major additions designed by architect John Horbury Hunt.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to this relation to infanticide, {{the fact that the}} zashiki-warashi are in old homes as well as {{the fact that they are}} often told in relation to legends about how <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>visiting</b> Buddhist pilgrim from outside the village was killed, the family of the home came to ruin, so it has been suggested that these zashiki-warashi are signs of the dark undersides of the village's community.|$|R
