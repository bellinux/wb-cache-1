Noorani notes [...] {{that the}} {{doctrine}} has [...] "now spread {{far and wide}} beyond its frontiers.", but that the eventual attribution to Dietrich Conrad is absent, who propounded the arguments in a lecture to the law faculty in the Banaras Hindu University. The argument, Noorani narrates made way to M K Nambyar who read the excerpt out in Golaknath. [...] "Perhaps {{the position of the}} Supreme Court is influenced {{by the fact that it}} has not so far been confronted with any extreme type of constitutional amendments. It is the duty of the jurist, though, to anticipate extreme cases of conflict, and sometimes only extreme tests reveal the true nature of a legal concept. So, if for the purpose of legal discussion, I may propose some fictive amendment laws to you, could it still be considered a valid exercise of the amendment power conferred by Article 368 if a two-thirds majority changed Article 1 by dividing India into two States of Tamilnad and Hindustan proper?"Could a constitutional amendment abolish Article 21, to the effect that forthwith a person could be deprived of his life or personal liberty without authorisation by law? Could the ruling party, if it sees its majority shrinking, amend Article 368 to the effect that the amending power rests with the President acting on the advice of the Prime Minister? Could the amending power be used to abolish the Constitution and reintroduce, let us say, the rule of a moghul emperor or of the Crown of England? I do not want, by posing such questions, to provoke easy answers. But I should like to acquaint you with the discussion which took place on such questions among constitutional lawyers in Germany in the Weimar period - discussion, seeming academic at first, but suddenly illustrated by history in a drastic and terrible manner."

It also means the obtaining of knowledge and know- how required for one’s living. Objective of this paper was to identify the role of libraries in Sri Lanka for the process of improving lifelong learning and identify strategies applicable from the e-marketing concept. Use of the web pages as a marketing tool among university libraries were examined by logging onto the homepages of respective libraries of government universities. Contents, strategic links, and the accessibility of these homepages were explored. However, this was not a technological exploration but a view in a marketing perspective. Underutilization of university libraries has become a common issue and it was assumed that implementation of Lifelong learning could address this issue to a certain extent. Orientation of marketing can target the real need of users and retain users as lifelong learners. Web pages can be utilized in university libraries to interact with users, conduct live communication with them, develop information skills among users, and disseminate information directly to relevant individual or group. The success of this process leads to the proliferation of Lifelong learning. Thirteen home pages out of Fifteen were logged on. Almost all the pages have given priority to include contact details, history, general procedures of the respective library, online public access catalogue, staff details, and free electronic resources etc. Nearly 50 % of libraries have made worthy attempts to link the page with other libraries and information resources available outside. Yet some of these links were not updated or associated with errors of linking. A few libraries have made satisfactory attempts to include subject gateways, Ask a Librarian facility, Live Chat corners etc which are helpful to enhance lifelong learning.

40|$|Purpose – This study tests {{hypotheses}} {{regarding the}} importance of employee preferences in explaining Sticky Floors, the pattern that women are, compared to men, less likely to start to climb the job ladder. Data/methods – We use original data obtained using a survey and a vignette study in which participants had to score the likeliness with which they would accept job offers with different promotion characteristics. Findings – The main findings are that female young professionals have a less pronounced preference for more demanding and less routinary jobs and that this effect is mediated by the greater risk aversion and anticipated gender discrimination among women. No gender {{differences were found in}} the relative likeliness to apply for jobs that involve a promotion in terms of job <b>authority.</b> <b>Limitations</b> – The vignette method assumes that artificial settings with low stakes do not bias results. Another limitation follows from the focus on interorganizational promotions among young professionals, which raises the question to what extent the results can be generalized to broader settings.

The researcher looked for evidence of Gonzalez-Herrero and Pratt's crisis theory in China Airlines' crisis management by identifying the following parts of the theory: issue management, planning prevention, the crisis, and the post-crisis. The researcher sought to suggest the use of Gonzalez-Herrero and Pratt's crisis theory in the formative research of China Airlines crisis management and to help public relations planners in the airline industry understand how crisis management incorporating Gonzalez-Herrero and Pratt's crisis theory could be presented and disseminated. Procedures began with collection of facts and interviews with the key public relations personnel of China Airlines. Next, the researcher applied Gonzalez-Herrero and Pratt's crisis theory to the China Airlines case for analysis. In addition, by viewing the other two airlines crash cases, this study provided a comparison of their crisis management strategies. The researcher followed Miles and Huberman's (1994) guidelines for addressing reliability and validity. Recommendations for improving China air's crisis management would be to use issue management, planning prevention, the crisis, and the post-crisis, the four steps of Gonzalez-Herrero and Pratt's crisis theory, for managing crises. The researcher also recommends periodical internal drills for different crises, and establishment of organizational legitimacy and <b>authority.</b> <b>Limitations</b> of the study included the legitimacy of qualitative research, that the study included the legitimacy of qualitative research, thus the study may not be considered {{a case study}} in the strictest sense, and that crisis management did not intentionally incorporate the process of Gonzalez-Herrero and Pratt's crisis theory in China Airlines' crisis management because of the company's culture issue.

40|$|The {{large number}} of {{surrendered}} and feral cats is a big animal welfare problem all over the world. Populations of feral cats arise through a {{large number of}} unwanted cats which can lead to surrender of these, through cats allowed to roam free outside which can lead to the owner losing these and through the reproduction that occurs amongst these surrendered or lost cats. One aim {{of this study is to}} give an account of this problem. It is however difficult to draw general conclusions about these populations of cats since studies all over the world has been carried out on different types of populations, during different conditions and different periods of time. The welfare of many of these cats is presumably low because they are exposed to risks as disease, starvation, climate, traffic, other animals and humans. Even when it comes to other consequences as risks of infection, predation and competition over resources it is difficult to draw general conclusions from the studies that have been carried out. This uncertainty mixed with strong emotions and views of these cats contribute to an intensive debate over how the problem with unowned cats should be managed. Conclusions from studies of different methods for managing the problem shows that a combination of measures is often needed, decided after the prevailing conditions. To spread information to cat owners as a preventive measure is an important part of the management of this problem. An account is also given for how the problem can be managed according to Swedish legislation. This gives different possibilities of managing the problem which has resulted in further uncertainty as can be seen in legal cases and a varying choice of management from <b>authorities.</b> <b>Limitations</b> in using euthanasia of unowned and feral cats also imply difficulties in pursuing that sort of control over populations to a greater extent. The other aim of this study is to account for how a number of municipalities in Skåne County have perceived and managed the problem until January 1, 2009 when the animal welfare control was moved to the County Administrative Board. The results show that the problem has been perceived different between as well as within municipalities and some possible reasons for this is given. Cooperation with associations that work with these cats has often been carried out but is described in a varying way, from well functioning to problematic. A few municipalities have also conducted campaigns with information to cat owners. All of these have experienced the effect as good. Other conclusions of this study are that the level of knowledge concerning cats and the problems that can arise needs to be improved and that a well functioning cooperation is needed to manage the problem...|$|R

40|$|The Problem” {{occurs when}} a statute’s {{provisions}} become contradictory or unworkable {{in the context of}} new or unforeseen phenomena, yet the statute mandates agency action. The application of an unambiguous statutory provision may become problematic or unclear. Similarly, unambiguous provisions may become inconsistent given a particular application of the statute. During the same term, in Scialabba and UARG, the Supreme Court performed a Chevron review of agency interpretations of statutes facing three variations of the Problem, which this Note characterizes as direct conflict, internal inconsistency, and unworkability. In each case, the Court defined ambiguity in various, nontraditional ways and deferred to the agency’s reasonable interpretation of the statute. The broadest definition of ambiguity provided by the Justices encompassed direct conflicts, internal inconsistencies, and unworkability. In contrast, the narrowest definition found ambiguity based only on internal inconsistency. Some Justices found no ambiguity, but allowed an agency more interpretive flexibility to resolve the Problem and accomplish the unambiguous mandate of the statute. This Note contends that ambiguity in broken statutory frameworks may influence the traditional Chevron analysis; the Court may defer to an agency’s reasonable interpretation or allow an agency greater interpretive flexibility where it would not otherwise. But an agency does not have unlimited interpretive authority each time the Problem arises. Agency interpretations that alter or ignore unambiguous statutory text or functionally change the statute may still be impermissible under Chevron review. This Note raises agencies’ awareness regarding these nontraditional definitions of Chevron ambiguity, and discusses agency interpretive <b>authority</b> and <b>limitations</b> {{in the context of the}} Problem...|$|R

In this paper, we propose a clustering method i. e., identify the clusterheads among all the nodes. Though there are several clustering algorithms that have been proposed; however, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, there is none that characterizes the different node parameters in terms of entropy. Entropy is a measure of information. We use the local information available to every node to determine the mutual information. We considered two parameters in the selection procedure, namely, energy and mobility. Extensive simulations have been conducted and the performance of the proposed clustering scheme has been shown in terms of the average number of clusterheads or clusters, the average number of cluster changes, and the average connectivity. The results demonstrate that the mutual information captured through entropy is very effective in determining the most suitable clusterheads. I...|$|R
