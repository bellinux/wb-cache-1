The three main video screens were angled to give the side audience a better <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision.</b> A Hippotizer V3 media server was used for content playback and operated by PRG Nocturne's Will Stinson, and five cameras were manned for this show. PRG used their newly invented GroundControl followspot devices which were attached as truss {{to the top of}} the screens, using Clay Paky Stormy Strobes. Fitted with high-definition cameras, they could be operated from backstage, who could simply use the cameras and direct the lights to illumate specific areas as required, without having to have knowledge about the physical stage. Console director Joshua Hutchings controlled their color, beams and shutters. Advantage of the followspot was to allow the lightning personnel to operate from a comfortable environment, rather than to climb on heights atop the stage. Hutchings explained the whole show was time-coded, going inline with the choreography.|$|E

2500|$|The {{austerity}} of {{the composition}} marks {{a new and more}} abstract tendency in Eakins's work, presaging the increasing sense of isolation that would be characteristic of his later portraits.

Despite formal similarities between The Concert Singer and works by Eakins's French contemporaries, there is a difference in mood: Degas' singers work in cafes, their glamor undercut by garish lighting, and Daumier's essays of the theme are more cynical still. In contrast, the Eakins painting reflects an American appreciation for singing as a manifestation of high culture. Unidealized, Weda Cook's figure is depicted as substantial and sensuous.

40|$|Background: Sponsored by the European Commission, the FP 7 STIFF-FLOP project {{aimed at}} {{developing}} a STIFFness controllable Flexible and Learn-able manipulator for surgical operations, {{in order to}} overcome the current limitations of rigid-link robotic technology. Herein, we describe the first cadaveric series of total mesorectal excision (TME) using a soft and flexible robotic arm for optic vision in a cadaver model. Methods: TME assisted by the STIFF-FLOP robotic optics was successfully performed in two embalmed male human cadavers. The soft and flexible optic prototype consisted of two modules, each measuring 60 mm in length and 14. 3 mm in maximum outer diameter. The robot was attached to a rigid shaft connected to an anthropomorphic manipulator robot arm with six degrees of freedom. The controller device was equipped with two joysticks. The cadavers (BMI 25 and 28 kg/m 2) were prepared according to the Thiel embalming method. The procedure was performed using three standard laparoscopic instruments for traction and dissection, {{with the aid of}} a 30 ° rigid optics in the rear for documentation. Results: Following mobilization of the left colonic flexure and division of the inferior mesenteric vessels, TME was completed down to the pelvic floor. The STIFF-FLOP robotic optic arm seemed to acquire superior <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> the surgical field in the pelvis, resulting in an intact mesorectum in both cases. Completion times of the procedures were 165 and 145 min, respectively. No intraoperative complications occurred. No technical failures were registered. Conclusions: The STIFF-FLOP soft and flexible robotic optic arm proved effective in assisting a laparoscopic TME in human cadavers, with a superior field <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> compared to the standard laparoscopic vision, especially low in the pelvis. The introduction of soft and flexible robotic devices may aid in overcoming the technical challenges of difficult laparoscopic procedures based on standard rigid instruments...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDue {{to his or}} her profession, any {{building}} facility manager has to face many decision-making situations. One of {{the most}} important to be mentioned is the arbitration of a multi-year maintenance plan for buildings. Deciding between proposed maintenance actions, according to several constraints, so as to aim at satisfying corporate strategy is a complex choice. Risk approaches can be particularly effective because of their ability to handle complexity and uncertainties. The problem is then to be able to propose a method considering risks, adapted to the specific context of building facility management. Our method, regarded as a traditional approach, includes needed resources (i. e. costs) according to constraints (i. e. budget), but it also considers several risk domains (safety, technical preservation, client satisfaction, etc.), through the consequences (gain and loss).

The author challenges the view at the exhibits of a Peace Museum only as stiffened trace of time, memory index and memorial objects. It is proposed to consider museum artifacts as actual participants of current events from two <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision.</b> Historical artifacts as museum exhibits and bygone experiences (samples of the past) acquire their meaning and significance only in contact with the present, joining the dialogue on the latest challenges humankind faces here and now. At the same time, objects as samples of peacemaking convey experiences of a culture of nonviolence and reconciliation, and therefore become the most in demand in urgent and dramatic situations of the present day. Unlike standard interpretations, I argue that the objects exhibited at a peace museum can be useful to the society only when we manage to relate and update them to the current life experience. Keeping and exposing the artifacts of peacemaking only as exhibits of the past, we mothball them, depriving them of vital communion with modernity.

40|$|Though often {{produced}} with a propagandist aim, many an early modern bird's-eye view {{can be seen}} as a contradictory cultural product. For example, the Spanish views commissioned by the Habsburg rulers did not contribute to buttressing the system they were meant to dignify. Instead, the views of Anton van den Wyngaerde in the 1560 s and those reproduced in the Civitates orbis terrarum (1578 - 1612) both reflect and construct a sense of local pride in the context of a totalitarian state aspiring to uniformity and social control. The vindication of fragmentation against the state's notion of unity is only one of the paradoxes embedded in the production of bird's-eye views. The fact that the views highlight royal palaces, the houses of the nobility, and church buildings does not disguise the fact that there is no all-embracing concept of urban planning that would render those cities ideal in the eye of the beholder. Moreover, the different <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> and the presence of the draftsmen also convey an idea of hegemony that highlights the individual subject, undermining the notion of that subject's subordination. This is further corroborated by the shifting position of the viewer, who can occupy the position of the artist and who, as an urban dweller, is also the object of study, that is to say, the sight...|$|R
6000|$|Sociology, it is evident, is, upon any hypothesis, no {{less than}} the attempt to bring that vast, complex, unique Being, its subject, into clear, true {{relations}} with the individual intelligence. Now, since individual intelligences are individual, and each is a little differently placed in regard to the subject under consideration, since the personal <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> is much wider towards humanity than towards the circumambient horizon of matter, it should be manifest that no sociology of universal compulsion, of anything approaching the general validity of the physical sciences, is ever to be hoped for--at least upon the metaphysical assumptions of this paper. With that conceded, we may go on to consider the more hopeful ways in which that great Being may be presented in a comprehensible manner. Essentially this presentation must involve an element of self-expression must partake quite as much of the nature of art as of science. One finds in the first conference of the Sociological Society, Professor Stein, speaking, indeed a very different philosophical dialect from mine, but coming to the same practical conclusion in the matter, and Mr. Osman Newland counting [...] "evolving ideals for the future" [...] as part of the sociologist's work. Mr. Alfred Fouillée also moves very interestingly in the region of this same idea; he concedes an essential difference between sociology and all other sciences in the fact of a [...] "certain kind of liberty belonging to society in the exercise of its higher functions." [...] He says further: [...] "If this view be correct, it will not do for us to follow in the steps of Comte and Spencer, and transfer, bodily and ready-made, the conceptions and the methods of the natural sciences into the science of society. For here the fact of consciousness entails a reaction of the whole assemblage of social phenomena upon themselves, such as the natural sciences have no example of." [...] And he concludes: [...] "Sociology ought, therefore, to guard carefully against the tendency to crystallise that which is essentially fluid and moving, the tendency to consider as given fact or dead data that which creates itself and gives itself into the world of phenomena continually by force of its own ideal conception." [...] These opinions do, in their various keys, sound a similar motif to mine. If, indeed, the tendency of these remarks is justifiable, then unavoidably the subjective element, which is beauty, must coalesce with the objective, which is truth; and sociology mast be neither art simply, nor science in the narrow meaning of the word at all, but knowledge rendered imaginatively, and with an element of personality that is to say, in the highest sense of the term, literature.|$|E
60|$|I {{find myself}} back {{again at the}} {{comparison}} of the botanist and myself. There is a profound difference in our imaginations, and I wonder {{whether it is the}} consequence of innate character or of training and whether he is really the human type or I. I am not altogether without imagination, but what imagination I have has the most insistent disposition to square itself with every fact in the universe. It hypothesises very boldly, {{but on the other hand}} it will not gravely make believe. Now the botanist's imagination is always busy with the most impossible make-believe. That is the way with all children I know. But it seems to me one ought to pass out of it. It isn't as though the world was an untidy nursery; it is a place of splendours indescribable for all who will lift its veils. It may be he is essentially different from me, but I am much more inclined to think he is simply more childish. Always it is make-believe. He believes that horses are beautiful creatures for example, dogs are beautiful creatures, that some women are inexpressibly lovely, and he makes believe that this is always so. Never a word of criticism of horse or dog or woman! Never a word of criticism of his impeccable friends! Then there is his botany. He makes believe that all the vegetable kingdom is mystically perfect and exemplary, that all flowers smell deliciously and are exquisitely beautiful, that Drosera does not hurt flies very much, and that onions do not smell. Most of the universe does not interest this nature lover at all. But I know, and I am querulously incapable of understanding why everyone else does not know, that a horse is beautiful in one way and quite ugly in another, that everything has this shot-silk quality, and is all the finer for that. When people talk of a horse as an ugly animal I think of its beautiful moments, but when I hear a flow of indiscriminate praise of its beauty I think of such an aspect as one gets for example from a dog-cart, the fiddle-shaped back, and that distressing blade of the neck, the narrow clumsy place between the ears, and the ugly glimpse of cheek. There is, indeed, no beauty whatever save that transitory thing that comes and comes again; all beauty is really the beauty of expression, is really kinetic and momentary. That is true even of those triumphs of static endeavour achieved by Greece. The Greek temple, for example, is a barn with a face that at a certain <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> and in a certain light has a great calm beauty.|$|E
6000|$|I am {{moved to}} add after so much {{insistence on the}} scenic side of my labour that I have found the steps of re-perusal almost as much waylaid here by quite another style of effort in the same signal interest--or have in other words not failed to note how, even so {{associated}} and so discriminated, the finest proprieties and charms of the non-scenic may, under the right hand for them, still keep their intelligibility and assert their office. Infinitely suggestive such an observation as this last on the whole delightful head, where representation is concerned, of possible variety, of effective expressional change and contrast. One would like, at such an hour as this, for critical licence, {{to go into the}} matter of the noted inevitable deviation (from too fond an original vision) that the exquisite treachery even of the straightest execution may ever be trusted to inflict even on the most mature plan--the case being that, though one's last reconsidered production always seems to bristle with that particular evidence, [...] "The Ambassadors" [...] would place a flood of such light at my service. I must attach to my final remark here a different import; noting in the other connexion I just glanced at that such passages as that of my hero's first encounter with Chad Newsome, absolute attestations of the non-scenic form though they be, yet lay the firmest hand too--so far at least as intention goes--on representational effect. To report at all closely and completely of what [...] "passes" [...] on a given occasion is inevitably to become more or less scenic; and yet in the instance I allude to, WITH the conveyance, expressional curiosity and expressional decency are sought and arrived at under quite another law. The true inwardness of this may be at bottom but that one of the suffered treacheries has consisted precisely, for Chad's whole figure and presence, of a direct presentability diminished and compromised--despoiled, that is, of its PROPORTIONAL advantage; so that, in a word, the whole economy of his author's relation to him has at important points to be redetermined. The book, however, critically viewed, is touchingly full of these disguised and repaired losses, these insidious recoveries, these intensely redemptive consistencies. The pages in which Mamie Pocock gives her appointed and, I can't but think, duly felt lift to the whole action by the so inscrutably-applied side-stroke or short-cut of our just watching and as quite at an <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> as yet untried, her single hour of suspense in the hotel salon, in our partaking of her concentrated study of the sense of matters bearing on her own case, all the bright warm Paris afternoon, from the balcony that overlooks the Tuileries garden--these are as marked an example of the representational virtue that insists here and there on being, for the charm of opposition and renewal, other than the scenic. It wouldn't take much to make me further argue that from an equal play of such oppositions the book gathers an intensity that fairly adds to the dramatic--though the latter {{is supposed to be the}} sum of all intensities; or that has at any rate nothing to fear from juxtaposition with it. I consciously fail to shrink in fact from that extravagance--I risk it rather, for the sake of the moral involved; which is not that the particular production before us exhausts the interesting questions it raises, but that the Novel remains still, under the right persuasion, the most independent, most elastic, most prodigious of literary forms.|$|E

Focus group discussion also focuses on the process beyond the individual’s memory and desires. The richness and complexity of group dynamics should be considered. Focus group can also access to social interactional dynamics that produce particular memories, ideologies, and practices among the group members. It themselves becomes relevant, termed as units of analysis of our study. Questions, issues and topics process focus group. Through different dynamics multiple <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> {{can be seen in the}} new world in unexpected ways. Focus group helps us move towards constructing a ‘methodology of getting lost” and toward enacting “double practices” (lather, 2001). This seems a necessary step towards conducting qualitative research. Keeping norms and rules of groups in mind the researcher and research participants realize that interpretation of individual are situated, provisional, contingent, unstable thus it’s unchangeable. It is necessary for the researcher to have self-reflectivity that involves making the research transparent rhetorical and poetic work of the researcher in representing the object of the study. It is theoretically important to construct a mutual ground between the researcher and the research participants. The second sense of self-reflexivity is important to encourage refection on interpretive research as the dual practice of knowledge gathering and self transformation is done through self-reflection and mutual reflection. Allowing ourselves to dwell in the existing inevitable indeterminacies, we are leading ourselves in the best way of the qualitative research practice.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} 50 years, {{the scale and}} {{intensity}} of livestock farming have increased significantly. At the same time, Western societies have become more urbanised and fewer people have close relatives involved in farming. As a result, most citizens have little knowledge or direct experience of what farming entails. In addition, more people are expressing concerns over issues such as farm animal welfare. This has led to increasing public demand for more sustainable ways of livestock farming. To date, {{little research has been}} carried out on the social pillar of sustainable livestock farming. The aim {{of this study is to}} provide insights into the sociocultural sustainability of livestock farming systems. This study reviews the key findings of earlier published interdisciplinary research about the social perceptions of dairy farming in the Netherlands and Norway (Boogaard et al., 2006, 2008, 2010 a and 2010 b) and synthesises the implications for sociocultural sustainability of livestock farming. This study argues that the (sociocultural) sustainable development of livestock farming is not an objective concept, but that it is socially and culturally constructed by people in specific contexts. It explains the social pillar of the economics/ecological/social model sustainability in terms of the fields of tensions that exist between modernity, traditions and naturality – ‘the MTN knot’ – each of which has positive and negative faces. All three <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> can be seen in people's attitudes to dairy farming, but the weight given to each differs between individuals and cultures. Hence, sociocultural sustainability is context dependent and needs to be evaluated according to its local meaning. Moreover, sociocultural sustainability is about people's perceptions of livestock farming. Lay people might perceive livestock farming differently and ascribe different meanings to it than experts do, but their ‘reality’ is just as real. Finally, this study calls for an ongoing collaboration between social and animal scientists in order to develop livestock farming systems that are more socioculturally sustainable...|$|R

50|$|The cone {{of vision}} of a flame {{detector}} {{is determined by the}} shape and size of the window and the housing and the location of the sensor in the housing. For infrared sensors also the lamination of the sensor material plays a part; it limits the cone of vision of the flame detector. A wide cone of vision does not automatically mean that the flame detector is better. For some applications the flame detector needs to be aligned precisely to take care that it does not detect potential background radiation sources. The cone of vision of the flame detector is three dimensional and is not necessarily perfectly round. The horizontal <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> and the vertical <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> often differ; this is mostly caused by the shape of the housing and by mirroring parts (meant for the self test). Different combustibles can even have a different <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> in the same flame detector. Very important is the sensitivity at angles of 45°. Here at least 50% of the maximum sensitivity at the central axis must be achieved. Some flame detectors here achieve 70% or more. In fact these flame detectors have a total horizontal <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> of more than 90°, but most of the manufacturers do not mention this. A high sensitivity on the edges of the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> provides advantages for the projection of a flame detector.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of the research is {{to carry out the}} tests <b>of</b> binocular <b>vision</b> at esotropia postoperatively. The research was conducted on 58 examinees with esotropia that underwent operative treatment. Data used for this research were gathered from the illness history data of the patients treated at the Ward for Orthoptics and Pleoptics of the Eye disease Clinic of Tuzla University Clinic Centre. The examinees were between 3 and 14 years of age. The research included three periods of observation: initial examination, postoperative period and a year upon operation. The examinees were divided into two age groups, from 3 to 6 and from 7 to 14. Test variables included: age, visual acuity of right and left eye and binocular vision (simultaneous perception, fusion and stereoscopic vision). The following methods were used in this research: analysis of medical records, examination of visual acuity, refraction, ocular motility examination and ocular misalignment balance of the eye muscles, test coverage and detection of the eye (cover test), measuring objective deviation <b>of</b> objective <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> strabismus (the synoptophore with mandatory alternating occlusion before measuring the <b>angle),</b> examination <b>of</b> binocular <b>vision</b> (the synoptophore). The results indicate the need for the inclusion of children with strabismus in orthoptic-pleoptic treatment at an early age...|$|R
40|$|This article {{suggests}} that a law firm that desiring to promote ethical behavior by its lawyers needs to complement efforts to establish an “ethical infrastructure” and an “ethical culture” with attention to its broader organizational culture. Specifically, research indicates that the perception that an organization treats its members fairly–their sense of organizational justice [...] {{is an important factor}} in prompting members’ ethical behavior. Many law firms in the last two or three decades have devoted attention to establishing what has been called an “ethical infrastructure” that reflects appreciation of the importance of organizational policies and procedures in encouraging ethical behavior. Such measures are salutary efforts to move beyond relying simply on individual character to ensure that law firm lawyers behave ethically. Research indicates, however, that policies and procedures will have little effect if members of an organization do not believe that they reflect ethical values to which organizational leaders genuinely subscribe. This has led to efforts in recent years to promote an “ethical culture” in firms that stresses the firm’s genuine commitment to the values underlying the professional responsibilities of lawyers in the firm. Modeling ethical behavior, penalizing those who violate ethical duties notwithstanding the revenues they generate, and openly discussing the relevance of professional values in various settings are some of the ways that this can done. This can be important in communicating that policies and procedures are not simply formalities with little substantive significance. When members of an organization think of ethics, however, they tend first to focus on how fairly they believe the organization treats people who work there. Research indicates that there is a strong connection between the perception of organizational justice and ethical attitudes and behavior. In the law firm setting, this directs attention to features not necessarily regarded as having salience with respect to professional responsibility, such as a firm’s compensation system, its support for members dealing with medical or family issues, and whether people who exhibit cooperative or competitive behavior are more likely to advance. The article {{suggests that}} ethical infrastructure and ethical culture can be seen as nested with a broader organizational culture. They each can provide distinct and complementary ways of promoting ethical outcomes, and also offer different <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> for research on behavior in law firms...|$|R
