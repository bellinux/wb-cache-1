30|$|Dental enamel is the {{outermost}} layer of teeth. It {{is white and}} translucent and its true color might be observed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edges</b> of <b>the</b> teeth only. Enamel is highly mineralized and acellular, {{so it is not}} a living tissue. Nevertheless, it is sufficiently porous for diffusion and chemical reactions to occur within its structure, particularly acidic dissolution (dental caries) and remineralization from saliva (possible healing of caries lesions). Therefore, it acts as a selectively permeable membrane, allowing water and certain ions to pass via osmosis (Avery 2001; Nanci 2012).|$|R

Due to the very fast response time of the nano sensor layers and the direct control of the critical wear zone, novel steering methods for tomorrows's cutting processes will possibly be feasible in future...|$|R

40|$|AbstractPain during {{injection}} {{of a medical}} needle is greatly influenced by the surface roughness and geometry of its <b>cutting</b> <b>edges.</b> An ion- plasma sputtering treatment is a promising candidate as a clean and precise polishing method for the painless needles. In this paper, the mechanism of the reduction of inserting force of the plasma-treated needles is investigated by microscopically observing artificial skins and needles during insertion. It {{was found that the}} time distribution of insertion force was influenced by <b>the</b> roughness <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edges.</b> Plasma-treated needles resulted in force reduction by approximate half in comparison of untreated ones. Furthermore, the microscopic observation found that the sharp dropping of force was occurring <b>at</b> <b>the</b> corners between <b>cutting</b> faces. Using <b>the</b> plasma-treated needle, the sharp dropping was significantly decreased. The plasma-etching treatment will lead to a clean finishing process for painless medical needles...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Drilling is a semi-enclosed cutting process. Drilling of difficult-to-machine {{materials}} generates thermal/frictional damage <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edges</b> of {{drill bit}} and decreases the life. In this paper, a new cooling and lubricating technique in drilling difficult-to-machine materials is developed {{to improve the}} life of drill bit. For this study, a water vapor generator and feeding system is developed. Comparative experiments are performed for various difficult-to-machine materials under the conditions of oil water emulsion, water vapor as coolant and lubricant and dry drilling, respectively. The effectiveness of water vapor {{on the basis of}} drill bit wear is studied. Experimental results show that with water vapor as coolant and lubricant the flank wear is reduced by 45 - 80 % and 10 - 15 % in comparison with dry drilling and oil water emulsion, respectively...|$|R

500|$|These details {{form the}} context for Clement's {{appearance}} in Scotland and his selection as the new Bishop of Dunblane. Three {{years had passed since}} the death of the last bishop, Osbert. Since there was no electoral college for the diocese, Pope Gregory IX charged the bishops of St Andrews, Brechin and Dunkeld, to find and nominate a suitable replacement. There can only be informed speculation regarding the choice of Clement. Importantly, perhaps, King Alexander was later noted for [...] "his concern for building churches for the Friars Preacher [...] ". The status of the Dominicans <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> of religious reform, together with Clement's background, may have been the decisive factors. At any rate, Clement was consecrated as bishop at Wedale on 4 September 1233, by William de Malveisin, Bishop of St Andrews. His consecration meant that he was the first Dominican in the British Isles to obtain a bishopric. This has prompted the historian Archie Duncan to comment that [...] "the choice of the first friar-bishop ... can only be called daring".|$|E

In this study, finite element modelling (FEM) based 3 -D process simulations are utilized to predict forces and temperatures on various uniform and variable edge micro-geometry tools.

30|$|Teeth (singular: tooth) are dense mineralized hard tissues {{found in}} the jaws, mouth and/or pharynx of many {{vertebrates}} (Koussoulakou et al. 2009). They have various structures {{to allow them to}} fulfill their different purposes. The primary function of teeth is to tear and chew food, while for carnivores it is also a weapon. Therefore, teeth have to withstand a range of physical and chemical processes, including compressive forces (up to ~ 700  N), abrasion and chemical attack due to acidic foods or products of bacterial metabolism (Jones 2001). The roots of teeth are covered by gums. From the surface teeth are covered by enamel of up to ~ 2  mm thick <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edges</b> of <b>the</b> teeth, which helps to prevent cavities on the teeth. The biggest teeth of some gigantic animals (elephants, hippopotamuses, walruses, mammoths, narwhals, etc.) are known as tusks or ivory.|$|R

2500|$|After Stokowski's death, Tom Burnam writes, the [...] "concatenization of canards" [...] {{that had}} arisen around him was revived {{that his name}} and accent were phony; that his musical {{education}} was deficient; that his musicians did not respect him; that he cared about nobody but himself. Burnam suggests {{that there was a}} dark, hidden reason for these rumours. Stokowski deplored the segregation of symphony orchestras in which women and minorities were excluded, and, so Burnam claims, his detractors got revenge by slandering Stokowski. Nevertheless, and notwithstanding the claims made by Tom Burnam, attitudes towards Stokowski have changed dramatically over the years since his death. In 1999, for Gramophone magazine, the noted music commentator David Mellor wrote: [...] "One of the great joys of recent years for me has been the reassessment of Leopold Stokowski. When I was growing up there was a tendency to disparage the old man as a charlatan. Today it is all very different. Stokowski is now recognised as the father of modern orchestral standards. He possessed a truly magical gift of extracting a burnished sound from both great and second-rank ensembles. He also loved the process of recording and his gramophone career was a constant quest for better recorded sound. But the greatest pleasure of all for me is his acceptance now as an outstanding conductor of nineteenth- and twentieth-century music, including a lot that was <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> of contemporary achievement." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{the late}} Goryeo Dynasty, Goryeo was <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> of {{shipboard}} artillery in world. In 1356 early experiments {{were carried out}} with gunpowder weapons that shot wood or metal projectiles.

The policy of placing cannons and other gunpowder weapons continued well into the Joseon Dynasty and by 1410, over 160 Joseon warships had cannons on board. Choe Mu-seon, a medieval Korean inventor, military commander and scientist, introduced {{the widespread use of}} gunpowder to Korea {{for the first time and}} created various gunpowder-based weapons. The weapons were created because of Japanese pirates (Wokou) frequently raiding Korea's coastal regions. Choe obtained knowledge of gunpowder from a Chinese merchant named Lee Yuan despite the fact that it was against Mongol law. Lee was at first reluctant but eventually came around because he was impressed by Choe's patriotism and determination. Choe later impressed the Koryo court and King U which then built him a laboratory and a factory geared solely toward gunpowder. He invented the first Korean cannons and other weapons such as the Singijeon (Korean fire arrows) and later the Hwacha which were first built in 1377 and are widely considered to be the first true multiple rocket launchers. These weapons were a vast improvement over the previous rocket weapons with one of the key features was that it could fire up to 200 rockets at one time.|$|E
