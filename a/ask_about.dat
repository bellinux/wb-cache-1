5|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) takes a {{pregnant}} Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{to the hospital}} when she doubles over in pain. There, Reyes phones him to <b>ask</b> <b>about</b> the case, but Mulder cedes {{to the authority of}} John Doggett (Robert Patrick), who is formally running the X-Files. However, Reyes says she can't call Doggett since it is about him. Meanwhile, Jeb is in a hotel room in Georgia trying to shoot himself in the head. Suddenly, he notices something wrong with his face; he claws at his face, peeling away the skin to reveal burning embers beneath the skin.|$|E
5|$|Bawdsey, {{right on}} the eastern coast in a {{relatively}} secluded location, could not effectively be protected from air attack or even bombardment from boats offshore. The need to move the team to a more protected location on the opening of hostilities had been identified long before the war. During a visit to his alma mater at Dundee University, Watt approached the rector to <b>ask</b> <b>about</b> potentially basing the team there, on short notice. When the Germans invaded Poland and war was declared on 3 September 1939, the research teams packed up and arrived in Dundee to find the rector only dimly recalling the conversation and having nothing prepared for their arrival. Students and professors had since returned after the summer break, and only two small rooms were available for the entire group.|$|E
5|$|Cox {{sold the}} head in 1799 for £230 (about £7,400 in today's money) to three {{brothers}} named Hughes. Interested in starting their own display in Bond Street, the brothers acquired the head as part of other Cromwell-related items. Thousands of posters were produced for the event, but the exhibit was marred by doubtful provenance. The Hughes brothers and their publicist, John Cranch, wrote Cox to <b>ask</b> <b>about</b> the gaps in the journey, but Cox was evasive, leading to concerns that he had sold them a fake. Indeed, Cranch could {{not come up with}} a documentary history of how the head came into their hands, so improvised a story that Cromwell's head was “the only instance of a head cut off and spiked that had before been embalmed; which is precisely the case with respect to {{the head in}} question”. Although Henry Ireton had also been embalmed before being beheaded, the story stuck, but it was in vain. The exhibition was a failure. The entrance fee was high (two shillings and sixpence, about the equivalent of £5) and rumours that the head was a fake were prevalent.|$|E
50|$|People in Zambia {{were not}} {{continuously}} counted by race before independence, {{and when they}} were counted by race it were primarily the non-Africans/non-blacks who were counted. People were counted by language only in 1931, while they were counted for ethnicity at various points since 1969. The 1969 census <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> language but not ethnic group, and the 1974 census <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> ethnic group, but not language. The 1980 census <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> ethnic group, mother tongue, and language of most frequent use, while the 1990 census <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> ethnic group and mother tongue. The 2000 census <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> ethnic group, language of most frequent use, and second language.|$|R

In fact, the comparison between a target concept and an associated concept is queried based on the property the student is <b>asking</b> <b>about.</b> If the student is <b>asking</b> <b>about</b> the usage, the associated concept will be a concept in the student’s culture that has the same usage.|$|R
5|$|Halperin {{cautioned that}} Austen often satirised popular sentimental romantic fiction in her letters, {{and some of}} the {{statements}} about Lefroy may have been ironic. However, it is clear that Austen was genuinely attracted to Lefroy and subsequently none of her other suitors ever quite measured up to him. The Lefroy family intervened and sent him away at the end of January. Marriage was impractical, as both Lefroy and Austen must have known. Neither had any money, and he was dependent on a great-uncle in Ireland to finance his education and establish his legal career. If Tom Lefroy later visited Hampshire, he was carefully kept away from the Austens, and Jane Austen never saw him again. In November 1798, Lefroy was still on Austen's mind as she wrote to her sister she had tea with one of his relatives, wanted desperately to <b>ask</b> <b>about</b> him, but could not bring herself to raise the subject.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, a mysteriously ill Jordan {{continues}} to <b>ask</b> <b>about</b> Helen's whereabouts, and her remarks about Helen's conditions lead Black {{to believe she}} is starting to experience the seemingly-psychic visions {{he is capable of}} seeing, which allow him to see the evil people are capable of. Elsewhere, Green is arrested. His property is searched but Helen is nowhere to be found—although another corpse is dug up in the garden, evidently killed nine years before. Black deduces that Green could not have killed Helen at the cabin as his house was already being watched by the police. He sees a set of tools in Green's home which he realizes were not used for murder or torture, but to immure Helen in the basement. Black and the police dismantle a newly finished plaster wall, finding Helen injured but alive; it is at this point that Black realizes Green was simply a pawn, used by his father to lure victims to the house.|$|E
5|$|Realizing that Roberts {{needed more}} help if his racing career {{was going to}} progress, Aksland {{introduced}} Roberts to airline pilot and amateur motorcycle racer Jim Doyle, who would become Roberts' personal manager. In 1971, Doyle and Roberts approached Triumph's American distributor to <b>ask</b> <b>about</b> {{the possibility of a}} sponsored ride, but were told that Roberts was too small for one of their bikes. They then turned to the American Yamaha importer's team, who agreed to make Roberts a factory sponsored rider at the age of 19. Yamaha asked the head of their American racing program, former 250cc world champion Kel Carruthers to help guide Roberts' racing career. It marked the beginning of a long and productive relationship between the two men. Carruthers ended his riding career after the 1973 season to concentrate full-time on managing Roberts' and Yamaha's efforts in the A.M.A. Grand National Championship, a series which encompassed events in four distinctive dirt track disciplines plus road racing.|$|E

5|$|The three member team is {{composed}} of Edward Tolby, his daughter, Silvia Tolby (of unspecified age, but vaguely described as an adolescent or young adult), and their mutual friend, Robert Penn. While {{en route to the}} valley, the team arrives in a small rural town by the name of Fairfax. Fairfax is littered with ancient, decaying gadgets; the last remnants of the era of governments and high tech society, which none of the locals know how to fix or reproduce. Excited by the strangers, the locals <b>ask</b> <b>about</b> the League. Tolby answers their questions in turn, ending with an explanation of the timeline of events which led up to the great revolt. The event is summarized as having begun with revolts in Europe which overthrow the national governments. After France exists for a month free of government, millions join the by then explicitly anarchist movement to disarm the nuclear powers. At each toppled government center, millions of records are burned and government integration robots are destroyed. These events result in the setting of the story; a world full of anachronistic high-technology, interspersed in a pre-industrialized, agrarian culture.|$|E
5|$|While Dredd {{works his}} way towards Ma-Ma, she {{calls in the}} corrupt Judges Lex, Kaplan, Chan and Alvarez. The four relieve Volt and Guthrie from duty and are allowed into the building. Dredd {{encounters}} Chan and is suspicious {{that he does not}} <b>ask</b> <b>about</b> Anderson's status. Seeing his cover blown, Chan attacks Dredd, but is killed. Meanwhile, Kay tries to execute Anderson with her own weapon, but the pistol's DNA scanner does not recognise him and explodes, taking his arm off. She escapes and later encounters Kaplan, whom she promptly kills after reading Kaplan's mind. Elsewhere, Dredd kills Alvarez but runs out of ammunition, and is shot by Lex in the abdomen. Lex moves in to execute Dredd, but Dredd stalls him long enough for Anderson to arrive and kill Lex.|$|E

40|$|Clinicians often <b>ask</b> {{pregnant}} women <b>about</b> tobacco smoking, but their practices of <b>asking</b> <b>about</b> other smoking and nicotine exposures are unknown. This study analysed how often clinicians <b>ask</b> {{pregnant women}} <b>about</b> {{their use of}} e-cigarettes, cannabis, chewing tobacco, and second-hand smoke (SHS) exposure. Two cross-sectional surveys were undertaken. A random sample of 500 General Practitioner (GP) members were invited from the National Faculty of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health (NFATSIH) to complete an on-line survey, and 5571 GP and Obstetrician (OBS) members of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RANZCOG) were sent a paper survey by mail. Questions on frequency of <b>asking</b> <b>about</b> the exposures used Likert Scales, later dichotomized to "often-always" and "never-sometimes". Logistic regressions estimated associations between clinician type and <b>asking</b> <b>about</b> cannabis, e-cigarettes, chewing tobacco, and SHS. An adjusted model reduced potential confounders of location, guidelines, gender and population. n = 378 GPs and OBS participated (6. 2 % response). In total, 13 - 14 % <b>asked</b> "often-always" <b>about</b> e-cigarettes; 58 % cannabis; 38 % cannabis with tobacco; 27 % SHS, and 10 % chewing tobacco-compared to 95 % of the sample <b>asking</b> <b>about</b> cigarette smoking. After adjustment, the odds of RANZCOG GPs (OR 0. 34) and OBS (OR 0. 63) <b>asking</b> <b>about</b> cannabis were lower compared to NFATSIH GPs. Clinician type was non-significant for <b>asking</b> <b>about</b> e-cigarettes, chewing tobacco and SHS. Surveyed Australian GPs and obstetricians <b>asked</b> less frequently <b>about</b> e-cigarettes, chewing, SHS exposure, and cannabis, potentially missing important exposures for mother and child...|$|R

Three questions <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> the participants’ level of engagement (α[*]=[*] 0.91), three questions <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> the participants’ level of performance-approach goals (α[*]=[*] 0.86), and three questions <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> participants’ level of mastery-approach goals (α[*]=[*] 0.80).

40|$|In {{this chapter}} it is {{confirmed}} that in Bari Italian an intonational distinction is made between polar questions <b>asking</b> <b>about</b> new information (QUERY-YN moves in the HCRC Map Task coding scheme) and those <b>asking</b> <b>about</b> given information (prototypical CHECK moves in the same coding scheme). The former, where the speaker believes that the information is not shared and therefore mutually inactive, employ a rising pitch accent (L+H*). The latter, where the speaker believes that the information is mutually active, are expressed with a falling accent (H*+L or H+L*). The situation is more complicated for moves classified as CHECKS which are <b>asking</b> <b>about</b> information which has been mentioned earlier in the dialogue as opposed to the prototypical CHECKS where the information is given immediately before the current turn. These CHECKS, <b>asking</b> <b>about</b> textually accessible as opposed to given information, as well as those <b>asking</b> <b>about</b> something which can only be inferred from the context, can have either rising or falling pitch accents. The intonational variation is related to the degree of speaker confidence that confirmation being sought in the question will be provided...|$|R
