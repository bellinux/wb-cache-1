40|$|INTRODUCTION The Schwarz {{algorithm}} {{is a useful}} tool {{when it comes to}} adaptive refinement. The implementation of these complex algorithms can be kept simple by using regular grid structures for the discretization. However, any sophisticated refinement strategy will yield highly irregular refinement regions. In [6] and [11] an implementation of the AFACx {{algorithm is}} presented that is based on block structured refinement grids, that consist of non-overlapping regular cartesian grids. There are situations where overlapping grids have advantages, since simpler grids or substantially fewer blocks can be used. One example is the use of boundary <b>aligned</b> <b>grids</b> along the boundary and a cartesian grid in the interior of a domain as it has been used by Linden (cf. [8]) and Chesshire/Henshaw (cf. [3]). Without allowing overlap, complicated grids have to be constructed. Another example is the refinement along a shock with d cells orthogonal to the shock. If rotated cartesia...|$|E
40|$|The use {{of shock}} {{capturing}} finite-difference techniques in computing flow fields containing shocks {{results in a}} smeared or oscillatory solution {{in the vicinity of}} the shocks. This smearing or oscillatory behavior is due to the discretized form of the governing differential equations used to compute the solution. The discretization error can be reduced by a proper clustering of mesh points in the region of the shock and by using shock <b>aligned</b> <b>grids.</b> This paper uses a simple method that was developed earlier to cluster points near the shocks and serves to introduce a new method of generating a shock aligned mesh. Applications to the one-dimensional inviscid Burgers' equation, supersonic flow over a wedge with the associated straight oblique shock, one- and two-dimensional inviscid flows through an expanding duct and the problem of a straight oblique shock in a uniform supersonic freestream are presented. Significant reduction in the oscillatory behavior of the solution is demonstrated...|$|E

40|$|Realistic {{simulation}} of smoke {{is used in}} the special effects industry to produce smoke in both feature films and video games. Traditional simulations utilize uniformly spaced rectangular computational grids to perform the smoke simulation. Various changes had been proposed to improve different aspects of the simulation, including level of details, memory usage and simulation speed. In this thesis, I propose a novel computational grid that improves upon the level of details as well as memory usage. I propose a frustum <b>aligned</b> <b>grid</b> that takes advantage of the viewing camera because details are most important in the area close to the camera. A frustum <b>aligned</b> <b>grid</b> reduces the amount of grid points necessary to cover the whole domain by placing a high concentration of grid points near the camera while having sparse grid points away from the camera. By using a larger number of grid lines in the direction parallel to the camera and fewer grid lines in the direction perpendicular to the camera, high level of details using a smaller amount of memory can be achieved. The grid is logically rectangular and a perspective transformation can map the grid into a spatially rectangular one. These properties enable the use of existing simulation tools with some modifications, thus maintaining the level of speed. Experimental results and comparison with a standard uniform grid demonstrate the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed method. i...|$|R

40|$|Accurate {{measurement}} of physical parameters {{is essential for}} the practice of modern medicine and ophthalmology in particular. A measuring device is presented that combines a single lens reflex (SLR) camera body incorporating two aligned in-camera grids with a calibrated macrozoom attachment. The device has multiple applications wherever accurate measurements are required. The ability to measure and record physical parameters in both health and disease is essential to modern medical practice. This is particularly so in ophthalmology. Despite the relative accessibility of external structures, the clinician's measuring equipment often {{takes the form of a}} clear plastic ruler with the ever present possibility of inaccuracy from parallax and perspective. Indeed, even in the hands of expert observers, the results from the commercially produced Hertel exophthalmometer are prone to significant variation. Various photographic methods of measurement have been described using a fixed focal length lens system, and recently evaluated. These, however, require processing of the photographs before measurements can be taken. We present a simple, relatively inexpensive multi-purpose device which can measure physical parameters directly and record photographic evidence of these measurements. In essence, the device consists of a single lens reflex (SLR) camera fitted with two carefully <b>aligned</b> <b>grids,</b> linked to a calibrated macrozoom lens...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In fusion plasmas {{there is}} extreme {{anisotropy}} {{due to the}} high temperature and large magnetic eld strength. This causes diusive processes, heat diusion and energy/momentum loss due to viscous friction, to eectively be aligned with the magnetic eld lines. This alignment leads to dierent values for the respective diusive coecients in the magnetic eld direction and in the perpendicular direction, {{to the extent that}} heat diusion coecients can be up to 1012 times larger in the parallel direction than in the perpendicular direction. This anisotropy puts stringent requirements on the numerical methods used to approximate the MHD-equations since any misalignment of the grid may cause the perpendicular diusion to be polluted by the numerical error in approximating the parallel diusion. Currently the common approach is to apply magnetic eld <b>aligned</b> <b>grids,</b> an approach that automatically takes care of the directionality of the diusive coecients. This approach runs into problems in the case of crossing eld lines, e. g., x-points and points where there is magnetic reconnection. This makes local non-alignment unavoidable. It is therefore useful to consider numerical schemes that are more tolerant to the misalignment of the grid with the magnetic eld lines, both to improve existing methods and to help open the possibility of applying regular non-aligned grids. To investigate this several discretization schemes are applied to the anisotropic heat diusion equation on a cartesian grid...|$|E

40|$|International audienceNuclear fusion is one {{promising}} way {{to produce}} a clean energy in the forthcoming years. The possibility to construct nuclear fusion reactors is studied in large scale physics experiments as the international ITER project in construction in Cadarache, France that gathers contributions from seven different countries. In this experimental reactor, known as a tokamak, (a Russian acronym meaning toroidal chamber) an extremely hot plasma of hydrogen isotopes is confined thanks to a very large magnetic field, {{in order to reach}} sufficiently high temperatures and densities to initiate nuclear fusion reactions. The equilibrium state of this plasma is described by a non-linear elliptic equation known as the Grad-Shafranov equation[1, 2]. Due to the complexity of the magnetic geometry, this equation can only be solved by specialized numerical solvers[3]. However, since the plasma is highly unstable, the confinement properties of the equilibrium have to be studied by other numerical simulations addressing some specific physical issues as the turbulent transport in the plasma that is done by gyrokinetic codes or the stability of the plasma that is studied by magnetohydrodynamic solvers. These different numerical codes have therefore to be coupled in an appropriate way. Due to the highly anisotropic character of strongly magnetized plasmas, a crucial point in the coupling of these different codes is the construction of a mesh that is aligned on the magnetic flux surfaces computed by the Grad-Shafranov equilibrium solvers. In this work, we will describe an original method for the construction of flux <b>aligned</b> <b>grids</b> that respect the magnetic equilibrium topology. This method relies on the analysis of the singularities of the magnetic flux function and the construction of a graph known as the Reeb graph [4] that allows the segmentation of the physical domain into sub-domains that can be mapped to a reference square domain. We will present several examples taken from existing tokamaks and ITER to illustrate this grid generation process. REFERENCES [1] Grad, H., and Rubin, H...|$|E

Due to its computational efficiency, the method of short-characteristics is often employed, despite it introducing numerical diffusion as an interpolation artifact. In this paper, we quantify {{the effect of the}} numerical diffusion on the spatial resolution of synthesize emergent intensity images, and derive a closed form analytical model of the diffusion error as a function of viewing angle when using linear interpolation. We demonstrate that the image degradation adversely affects the comparison between simulated data and observations, for observations away from disk-center, unless the simulations are computed at much higher intrinsic resolution than the observations. We also show that the diffusion error is readily avoided by interpolating the simulation solution on a viewing-angle <b>aligned</b> <b>grid</b> prior to computing the radiative transfer.

40|$|Abstract The spatial {{responses}} {{of many of}} the cells recorded in all layers of rodent medial entorhinal cortex (mEC) show mutually <b>aligned</b> <b>grid</b> patterns. Recent experimental findings have shown that grids can often be better described as elliptical rather than purely circular and that, beyond the mutual alignment of their grid axes, ellipses tend to also orient their long axis along preferred directions. Are grid alignment and ellipse orientation aspects of the same phenomenon? Does the grid alignment result from singleunit mechanisms or does it require network interactions? We address these issues by refining a single-unit adaptation model of grid formation, to describe specifically the spontaneous emergence of conjunctive grid-by-head-direction cells in layers III, V, and VI of mEC. We find that tight alignment can be produced by recurrent collateral interactions, but this requires head-direction (HD) modulation. Through a competitive learning process driven by spatial inputs, grid fields then form already aligned, and with randomly distributed spatial phases. In addition, we find that the self-organization process is influenced by any anisotropy in the behavio...|$|R

40|$|The {{contribution}} of wave {{energy to the}} renewable energy supply is rising. To extract {{a considerable amount of}} wave power, Wave Energy Converters (WECs) are arranged in several rows or in a ’farm’. WECs in a farm are interacting (e. g. the presence of other WECs influence the operational behaviour of a single WEC) and the overall power absorption is affected. In this paper wake effects in the lee of a single WEC and multiple WECs of the overtopping type, where the water volume of overtopped waves is first captured in a basin above mean sea level and then drains back to the sea through hydro turbines, are studied using the time-dependent mild-slope equation model MILDwave. The wake behind a single WEC is investigated for long-crested and short-crested incident waves. The wake becomes wider for larger wave peak periods. An increasing directional spreading results in a faster wave regeneration and a shorter wake behind the WEC. The wake in the lee of multiple WECs is calculated for two different farm lay-outs, i. e. an <b>aligned</b> <b>grid</b> and a staggered grid, with varying lateral and longitudinal spacing.

40|$|Several Wave Energy Converters (abbreviated as WECs) have intensively {{been studied}} and {{developed}} {{during the last decade}} and currently small farms of WECs are getting installed. WECs in a farm are partly absorbing, partly redistributing the incident wave power. Consequently, the power absorption of each individual WEC in a farm is affected by its neighbouring WECs. The knowledge of the wave climate around the WEC is needed to predict its performance in the farm. In this paper a technique is developed to implement a single and multiple WECs based on the overtopping principle in a time-dependent mild-slope equation model. So far, the mild-slope equations have been widely used to study wave transformations around coastal and offshore structures, such as breakwaters, piles of windmills and offshore platforms. First the limitations of the WEC implementation are discussed through a sensitivity analysis. Next the developed approach is applied to study the wave height reduction behind a single WEC and a farm. The wake behind an isolated WEC is investigated for uni- and multidirectional waves; it is observed that an increase of the directional spread leads to a faster wave redistribution behind the WEC. Further the wake in the lee of multiple WECs is calculated for two different farm lay-outs, i. e. an <b>aligned</b> <b>grid</b> and a staggered grid, by adapting the performance of each WEC to its incident wave power.
