5|$|Branford is {{the first}} {{previously}} rebuilt station to be further renovated with <b>a</b> <b>second</b> platform. A $60 million bond in February 2011 included $16.5 million for <b>a</b> <b>second</b> platform and pedestrian bridge at Branford, $7.3 million for platform extensions at Guilford, and $11 million to add catenary wires to currently unwired sidings along the line. Construction on the new platform at Branford began in September 2013, and the Guilford work is under way as well. After delays, the enlarged Branford station opened on September 30, 2016, although the north platform was not immediately served by trains. Bidding on <b>a</b> <b>second</b> platform and three-level parking garage at Madison, planned since 2009, was scheduled to begin in 2013 but did not occur. Per the agreement with Amtrak, <b>a</b> <b>second</b> platform is planned {{to be added to}} Clinton station. The project was originally planned to start in early 2012, but has since been indefinitely delayed.|$|E
5|$|Catalytic triads perform {{covalent}} catalysis via an acyl-enzyme intermediate. If this intermediate {{is resolved}} by water, {{the result is}} hydrolysis of the substrate. However, if the intermediate is resolved by attack by <b>a</b> <b>second</b> substrate, then the enzyme acts as a transferase. For example, attack by an acyl group results in an acyltransferase reaction. Several families of transferase enzymes have evolved from hydrolases by adaptation to exclude water and favour attack of <b>a</b> <b>second</b> substrate.|$|E
