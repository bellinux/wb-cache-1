5|$|For graphs G and H, the {{question}} of whether G has a homomorphism to H corresponds to a CSP instance with only one kind of constraint, as follows. The variables are the vertices of G and the domain for each variable is the vertex set of H. <b>An</b> <b>evaluation</b> is a function that assigns to each variable an element of the domain, so a function f from V(G) to V(H). Each edge or arc (u,v) of G then corresponds to the constraint ((u,v), E(H)). This is a constraint expressing that the evaluation should map the arc (u,v) to a pair (f(u),f(v)) that is in the relation E(H), that is, to an arc of H. A solution to the CSP is <b>an</b> <b>evaluation</b> that respects all constraints, so it is exactly a homomorphism from G to H.|$|E

40|$|The Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement {{describes}} {{a method of}} evaluating measurement uncertainty that involves attributing an underlying variance to each component of the total measurement error. Assessment of such a variance by statistical methods is known as Type <b>A</b> <b>evaluation</b> of uncertainty, while assessment by any other means is known as Type B evaluation. The involvement of degrees of freedom with Type <b>A</b> <b>evaluation</b> is in accordance with statistical theory. However, the use of “degrees of freedom” with Type B <b>evaluation</b> is <b>an</b> idea primarily developed for practicality, and might be improved upon. That idea {{ignores the fact that}} the underlying distribution of the corresponding error will often be assumed to be blunter than normal, as with a uniform distribution, and it can lead to underestimation of the total error variance. Consequently, an alternative concept for Type B evaluation is presented. The resulting analysis fits easily with the use of degrees of freedom in Type <b>A</b> <b>evaluation</b> and leads to an overall method of evaluation that often permits the proper quotation of shorter uncertainty intervals...|$|R
