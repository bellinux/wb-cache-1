In addition, critics note that despite rising CATS scores, the remedial requirements for Kentucky's entering college freshmen remain very high (nearly one of two recent high school graduates requires at least one college remedial course in Kentucky's public college system) which has led to pending legislation to replace CATS with a more up to date and credible assessment.|$|E

40|$|Background: Neurocognitive {{deficits and}} {{decrease}} in intelligence quotient (IQ) {{is one of}} the complication of prophylactic central nervous system (CNS) treatment in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. In this study, we compare the IQ in survivors of ALL that were treated with different prophylactic CNS treatments. Materials and Methods : We compared 43 long-term survivors of ALL: 21 survivors with intrathecal methotrexate (IT MTX) as CNS prophylaxis, 22 with IT MTX+ 1800 - 2400 rads cranial irradiation and 20 healthy controls. The IQ was measured using the Raven′s test in these patients. Results: Raven′s test revealed significant differences in IQ between the survivors of ALL that were treated with IT MTX, IT MTX plus cranial irradiation and control group. There {{was no significant difference in}} the IQ with respect to sex, age and irradiation dose. Conclusion: We can that reveal that CNS prophylaxis treatment, especially the combined treatment, is associated with IQ score decline in ALL survivors.

The good news is that recent reports from the National <b>Assessment</b> <b>of</b> T <b>Educational</b> <b>Progress</b> (NAEP) reveal that observable improvements have been made by girls in both participation and achievement in mathematics. The 1990 and 1992 NAEP results in mathematics show that, overall, females are enrolling in more mathematics courses and that females’ scores on the NAEP assessment are steadily increasing (Mullis, Dossey, Owen, & Phillips, 1993).

40|$|The standards-based <b>educational</b> reform {{initiatives}} <b>of</b> the 1990 s {{call for}} assessment innovations {{in support of}} high standards.

The <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> LEP students <b>educational</b> <b>progress</b> has long posed a dilemma for state departments of education, which generally use state assessment data to report student achievement. LEP students have typically been either exempted from state assessments or included inappropriately. Because kindergarten through twelfth grade students whose first language is not English constitute a large and growing segment of the U.

40|$|Researchers {{have long}} sought to {{identify}} manipulable factors distinct from student socioeconomic status and race-ethnicity that might increase overall student achievement or reduce differences in achievement between white and non-white students who attend the same school. Numerous quantitative research syntheses that researchers {{mounted in the}} 19802 ̆ 7 s generally uncovered few factors. In recent years, however, researchers have applied different synthesis methods to old data. Some of these analyses have produced evidence of several statistically significant relationships between factors such as class size and achievement. Nevertheless, this evidence is unconvincing for numerous reasons, creating a need for additional research with new data. In this study, I investigate the relationship among several school policies, practices and resources, the reading achievement of fourth-grade students, and differences in reading achievement between white and non-white fourth-grade students who attend the same school by applying a series of multilevel statistical models to data from the 1994 National (NAEP) and Trial State <b>Assessments</b> (TSA) <b>of</b> <b>Educational</b> <b>Progress.</b> Analyses <b>of</b> Pennsylvania data indicate that per-pupil spending, school racial composition, and an interaction between class size and teacher experience are associated with reading proficiency. Analyses of New York data indicate that per-pupil spending, school racial composition, and teacher experience are associated with reading proficiency while teacher certification level is associated with differences in reading proficiency between white and non-white students who attend the same school. Finally, analyses of United States data indicate that school racial composition is associated with reading proficiency while teacher certification level and school location are associated with differences in reading proficiency between white and non-white students who attend the same school. The evidence produced here provides new, potentially useful information to policy makers at national, state, district, and school levels. Lessons learned {{through the application of}} multilevel statistical modeling to NAEP and TSA data and through the linkage of several disparate data sets also provide new, potentially useful information to those empowered to modify the future design of surveys producing data sets of these types. ...|$|R
