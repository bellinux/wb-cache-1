25|$|Tchaikovsky's {{first three}} symphonies, while {{seemingly}} optimistic and nationalistic, are also chronicles of {{his attempts to}} reconcile his training from the Saint Petersburg Conservatory with Russian folk music and his own innate penchant for melody. Both worked against sonata form, the paramount <b>architectural</b> <b>concept</b> in Western classical music, not with it. The First, while conventional in form, shows Tchaikovsky's individuality strongly; it is rich in melodic invention and exudes Mendelssohnian charm and grace. The Second Symphony is among the more accessible of Tchaikovsky's works and exists in two versions. While the latter version is the one generally performed today, Tchaikovsky's friend and former student Sergei Taneyev considered the earlier one to be finer compositionally speaking. The Third, the only symphony Tchaikovsky completed in a major key, is written in five movements, similar to Robert Schumann's Rhenish Symphony, shows Tchaikovsky alternating between writing in a more orthodox symphonic manner and writing music {{as a vehicle to}} express his emotional life; with the introduction of dance rhythms into every movement except the slow one, the composer widens the field of symphonic contrasts both within and between movements.|$|E

We conclude that language design should be based upon the careful consideration of <b>architectural</b> <b>concepts.</b> This paper aims at supporting designers by presenting a methodological design framework {{in which they can}} reason about the design and implementation of distributed systems. The paper is also meant for language developers and formalists by presenting a collection of <b>architectural</b> <b>concepts</b> which deserve consideration for formal support. 1 Introduction <b>Architectural</b> <b>concepts</b> are abstractions (models) of frequently occurring aspects of technical objects.

The architectural assertions are written in terms of <b>architectural</b> <b>concepts</b> such as components, connectors, and configurations, and thus they can be easily mapped to or traced back to the original high-level constraints written in an architectural description language.
