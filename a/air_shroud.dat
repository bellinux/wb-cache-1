50|$|The typical bell {{applicator}} {{consists of}} five major assemblies: the valve module, the bell cup, the turbine, the shaping <b>air</b> <b>shroud,</b> and the electrostatic system.|$|E
50|$|The {{valve module}} is a {{manifold}} consisting of passages for paint, solvent, and compressed air, and valves {{to control the}} flow of materials for paint delivery, cleaning and purging with solvent, and management of compressed air to the valves, turbine, and shaping <b>air</b> <b>shroud.</b>|$|E
50|$|The shaping <b>air</b> <b>shroud,</b> or {{shaping air}} ring, {{is simply a}} ring with {{passages}} for air to flow out {{the front of the}} atomizer, outside of the cup diameter, to manage the size of the spray pattern produced.

5000|$|On {{the day of}} the {{accident}} Croydon <b>Air</b> Port was <b>shrouded</b> in fog with visibility fluctuating at around 50 m; and all aircraft were operating under so-called [...] "QBI" [...] (a Q code denoting that all operations have to be performed under instrument flight rules) conditions. Crews of aircraft were following a white line laid out approximately East-West on the grass surface of Croydon's landing area during their take-off runs (a normal procedure at several airports in the United Kingdom at the time, that had been in use at Croydon since 1931). A number of departures by this method had already been made that day by the time the KLM DC-2 took off, including a Swissair DC-2 about 25 minutes beforehand.|$|R
5000|$|An {{atomized}} spray {{produced from}} an ultrasonic nozzle {{is subjected to}} a heated substrate typically ranging from 300-400 degrees C.

5000|$|The rubber-gaiters were {{replaced}} by a cleaned up [...] "Ceriani-style" [...] set of forks. A touted benefit was better engine cooling but, with ram air, this was a non-issue for the most part. The three separate carburetors {{were replaced}} by three unitized rack mounted carburetors with a push-pull cable arrangement. The benefits of this were less costly carburetor balancing and more accurate fuel metering. The handlebar mounted cable operated choke was gone, replaced by a lever mounted directly on the rack of carbs. The cylinder head and the ram <b>air</b> <b>shroud</b> were redesigned to cater for this new carb setup.|$|E
40|$|The {{one-dimensional}} {{character of}} sooting premixed porous-plug (McKenna) burner flames has been examined, motivated by recent investigations where the one-dimensionality has been questioned. The examination employs laser diagnostic techniques to measure different characteristics: temperature using rotational coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy (CARS) and soot properties using laser-induced incandescence and elastic light scattering. Special {{attention has been}} paid to the influence of an outer shroud gas flow of either nitrogen or air. The nitrogen shroud gas leads to flame cooling at the outer edge, whereas the <b>air</b> <b>shroud</b> results in heating through the oxidation of CO/H- 2 /soot. This generally results in a more inhomogeneous spatial particle size profile for the nitrogen shroud flame, with smaller particle sizes at the flame edge. The present results emphasize the need to characterize burner and operating conditions accurately, and also, regarding parameters that at first glance seem less relevant, such as the shroud gas, to provide useful data for comparison between laboratories...|$|E
40|$|DE 10036159 A UPAB: 20020418 NOVELTY - An {{apparatus}} for {{the cultivation}} of cells having at least one recess to hold a solution, and a gas feed into the holder recess, is new. The gas is delivered close {{to the base of}} the recess containing the solution, so that the gas flows generally through all the solution. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An apparatus for cell cultivation is a micro-titration plate with at least one recess, or a square well plate, is new. The gas is fed by a tube, with openings in the side wall at the downstream end, with the opening size decreasing upstream from the downstream end of the tube. The assembly has a number of gas feed tubes, in a spaced array matching the layout of recesses holding cell solutions. The upstream end of the tubes opens into a hollow body which passes the gas into the tubes. The plate with the cell solutions is covered by an <b>air</b> permeable <b>shrouding,</b> sealed against the ambient environment, together with the gas feed system in a one-piece unit. USE - The apparatus is for {{the cultivation of}} cells and micro-organisms in the pharmaceutical industry, to assess interactions with other substances e. g. recombinant expressed polypeptides in micro-organisms. It is also for use in genome analysis. ADVANTAGE - The apparatus gives an effective small scale cultivation of cells...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{a simple}} {{expression}} {{to predict the}} average diameter of columns created with single, double and triple fluid jet grouting is proposed considering both {{the energy of the}} eroding jet and the resistance of the soil. The injection system (single, double or triple) and the composition of the injected fluids are taken into account on the basis of theoretical analysis of the turbulent diffusion of submerged jets. Instead of separately considering the energy of the <b>air</b> jet <b>shrouding</b> the eroding fluid, a simple parameter is introduced which represents the beneficial effect of air in reducing the energetic dissipation on the jet external surface. In this way, a new expression of the specific kinetic energy of the jet at any distance from the nozzle is proposed, which is a relevant step forward if compared with that at the nozzle or at the pump previously proposed, as it takes into account both the system characteristics and the composition of the eroding jet (either grout or water). In the expression proposed to predict the diameter of jet grouting columns, soil resistance is considered by way {{of the results of the}} standard penetration test and cone penetration test, in terms of NSPT and qc respectively. The expression has been calibrated on a number of experimental data, and in most cases proved its efficiency in predicting columns’ diameter with a scatter of less than 20 %. The field trials results highlight that jet grouting is more effective in coarse-grained soils, as clearly shown by an efficiency parameter proposed by the authors. Design charts are drawn to quickly estimate the average diameter Da for different soils, injection systems and input energies...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} new experimental measurements, at conditions {{representative of}} an aero engine, of heat transfer {{from the inner}} peripheral surface (shroud) of a rotating cavity. The results are taken from the University of Sussex Multiple Cavity Rig, {{which is designed to}} be similar to a gas turbine high pressure compressor internal <b>air</b> system. The <b>shroud</b> Nusselt numbers are shown to be dependent on the shroud Grashof number and insensitive to throughflow axial Reynolds number. The magnitude of the shroud Nusselt numbers are consistent with accepted correlations for turbulent free convection from a horizontal plate, yet show a trend (gradient of Nusselt to Grashof numbers) that is similar to laminar free convection. A supporting high-resolution 3 D unsteady RANS simulation was conducted to investigate the cavity flow structure with particular attention paid to the near shroud region. This demonstrated flow structures that are consistent with published work but also show the existence of a type of Rayleigh-Bénard flow that manifests as a series of streaks that propagate along the periphery of the cavity. These structures {{can be found in the}} literature albeit in different circumstances. Whilst these streaks have been shown in the simulation their existence cannot be ratified without experimental confirmation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a generalized approach for predicting {{the diameter of}} jet grout columns based on the theoretical framework of turbulent kinematic flow and soil erosion. The proposed calculation method is applicable to all conventional jet-grouting systems and {{takes into account the}} full range of operational parameters, fluid properties, soil strength, and particle size distribution, including the effect of the injection time on erosion distance. It was demonstrated that the increase in the jet grout column diameter arising from the use of a compressed <b>air</b> <b>shroud</b> in the double and triple fluid systems is approximately 27 - 81 % for the typical range of air pressure of 0. 5 - 1. 5 MPa. The proposed method was applied to four case histories involving four variants of jet-grouting systems, i. e., single fluid, double fluid, triple fluid, and an enhanced triple fluid system. Comparison between the calculated and the measured jet grout column diameters indicated that the proposed method can produce reasonable predictions for a variety of soil conditions. It was shown that jet grout columns formed by the enhanced triple fluid system are larger than those formed by the conventional triple fluid system by approximately 36 % on average. The proposed generalized approach allows all the key variables to be considered and is a useful means for the design of ground improvement by jet grouting. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers...|$|E

40|$|Among the Roman {{foundations}} {{in modern}} Catalonia was the colonia of Barcino, which, unlike {{several of its}} neighbours, had no local native predecessor. The growth of these cities was slow, and an <b>air</b> of mediocrity <b>shrouds</b> them all, save Tarraco. With the decline of nearby communities in the third century, the significance of Barcino increased. New defences and economic activity, supplemented {{by the presence of}} civil and ecclesiastical powers in the Visigothic period, ensured the survival of urban life, although a tendency to contraction around the religious centre is apparent in the topography of the 6 th. century, marking the beginning of the transition to the medieval plan. In the following centuries the fortress function was foremost: only from the mid tenth century can changes be detected, with the appearance of suburbs and a 'Port'. Braked by Almansur's raid, the impetus of growth was soon recovered. The development of the city during the succeeding two centuries can be traced from nearly a thousand documents, mainly unpublished. In this period, Barcelona's population increased ten-fold, with corresponding alterations to the townscape, while details of topography which have survived until the present day were often determined in this period. Three main zones are detectable: the adapted pattern of Antiquity within the defences, the spontaneous growth of the inner suburbs, while those of c. 1080 onwards contain elements of planning. By 1200, open land, once commonplace, had disappeared and the medieval city of narrow streets and tightly packed houses had been formed. The reasons behind this growth are diverse. Historical circumstances and the precedents of the Visigothic period played some part. Equally significant were the decline of Barcelona's neighbours and the maintained agricultural strength of its plain. Finally, Barcelona formed a focal point not only for this territorium, and a wider hinterland, but also for the emergent Catalonia...|$|R
40|$|In many aeroengines the {{accessory}} power offtake is achieved using a {{spiral bevel gear}} set running {{off one of the}} main shafts. The crown and bevel gears are housed in an internal gearbox. Over the past few years the Nottingham University Technology Centre (UTC) in Gas Turbine Transmission Systems has researched flow near spiral bevel gears both computationally and experimentally using a purpose-built test rig. In the current investigation the rig was configured with a Trent crown gear and slightly modified shroud covering the full 360 ° of the gear. No external containment chamber was fitted and all testing was conducted single-phase (air only) at 5, 000 rpm. Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA) was used to obtain the three components of flow velocity at a shroud exit slot and at shroud inlet. A 2 D system was utilised and thus two measurements were required at each point to give the 3 velocity components. The LDA technique enabled detailed mapping of flow features over the chosen regions, which included areas very near the shroud surfaces. Data was obtained over two measurement regions: 1) a volume mapping the air “jet” exiting the shroud exit slot at top dead centre (TDC) and 2) an area capturing the flow structures local to the shroud inlet. Combined the results form an excellent set of high quality, detailed, 3 -component flow data for direct use in validating CFD models and/or to define CFD boundary conditions. At the shroud exit slot the maximum velocity measured was 46. 2 m/s with the jet velocity dispersing over the measurement volume such that by 26 mm from slot plane the maximum velocity was less than 20 m/s. The jet angle was found to be only 16 ° off perpendicular azimuthally and 22 ° down from perpendicular. Data from the top 5 slots shows good similarity indicating the detailed data for the TDC slot is probably applicable to all slots. <b>Air</b> entering the <b>shroud</b> comes down the shroud face and up the rotating end face of the gear shaft. The azimuthal velocity component at shroud inlet was around 20 m/s; this is of the order of 50...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes an}} experimental {{investigation of the}} effects of varying the shroud profile shape on the performance of MAV (Micro <b>Air</b> Vehicle) -scale <b>shrouded</b> rotors. Hover tests were performed on seventeen models with a rotor diameter of 16 cm (6. 3 in) and various values of diffuser expansion angle, diffuser length, inlet lip radius and blade tip clearance, at various rotor collective angles. Compared to the baseline open rotor, the shrouded rotors showed increases in thrust by up to 94 %, at the same power consumption, or reductions in power by up to 62 % at the same thrust. These improvements surpass those predicted by momentum theory, due to the additional effect of the shrouds in reducing the non-ideal power losses of the rotor. The uniformity of the rotor wake was improved by the presence of the shrouds and by decreasing the blade tip clearance, resulting in lower induced power losses. Strong suction pressures were observed on the shroud inlet surface, at the blade passage region; taking advantage of this phenomenon could enable further increases in thrust. However, trade studies showed that, for a given overall aircraft size limitation, and ignoring considerations of the safety benefits of a shroud, a larger-diameter open rotor is more likely to give better performance than a smaller-diameter shrouded rotor. A single shrouded-rotor model was subsequently tested in translational flight at various angles of attack. In axial flow, at the same collective, the net thrust and the power consumption of the shrouded rotor were lower than those of the open rotor; in edgewise flow, the shrouded rotor produced greater thrust than the open rotor, while consuming less power. Measurements of the shroud surface pressure distributions illustrated the extreme asymmetry of the flow around the shroud, with consequent pitch moments much greater than those experienced by the open rotor. Except at low airspeeds and high angles of attack, the static pressure in the wake did not reach ambient atmospheric values at the diffuser exit plane; this challenges the validity of the fundamental assumption of the simple-momentum-theory flow model for short-chord shrouds in translational flight...|$|R
