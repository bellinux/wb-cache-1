5|$|The next morning, despite poor flying weather, {{an effort}} was made to air-drop <b>ammunition</b> <b>to</b> the Polish force on the ridge. Learning that the Canadians had resumed their push and were making for Point 239, at 07:00 a platoon of the 1st Armoured Regiment's 3rd Squadron reconnoitered the German {{positions}} below the Zameczek.|$|E
5|$|Angel {{gives up}} {{his share of}} the gold to Pike in return for sending one crate of rifles and <b>ammunition</b> <b>to</b> a band of rebels opposed to Mapache. The holdup goes largely as planned until Deke's posse turns up on the train the gang has robbed. The posse chases them to the Mexican border, only to be foiled again as the robbers blow up a trestle {{spanning}} the Rio Grande, dumping the entire posse into the river. The pursuers temporarily regroup at a riverside camp and then quickly take off again after the Bunch.|$|E

5|$|At 13:30 Gay {{ordered the}} 8th Cavalry Regiment to {{withdraw}} its men off Ka-san.

However, Holley could not reach anyone in D Company, 8th Engineer Combat Battalion.|$|E
5|$|From South Africa the Inconstant {{sailed to}} St Helena, and the Cape Verde Islands, where the {{squadron}} received orders {{to proceed to}} Gibraltar, {{and from there to}} Malta and Egypt {{to take part in the}} Anglo-Egyptian War. On 11 July 1882, Alexandria was bombarded and in the next two weeks Louis served in the Flying Squadron delivering shells and <b>ammunition</b> <b>to</b> the battle fleet, and then as a guard to the Khedive at Ras Al Teen Palace. He was decorated with the Egypt War Medal by Queen Victoria personally.|$|E
5|$|In 1806, a British {{expeditionary force}} invaded Buenos Aires. A 13-year-old Rosas served distributing <b>ammunition</b> <b>to</b> troops in a force {{organised}} by Viceroy Santiago Liniers {{to counter the}} invasion. The British were defeated in August 1806, but returned a year later. Rosas was then assigned to the Caballería de los Migueletes (a militia cavalry), although he was probably barred from active duty during this time due to illness.|$|E

5|$|In 1852, he was {{commissioned}} by the Ottoman authorities {{to prevent the spread}} of a Druze rebellion from Hauran to northern Palestine. He successfully satisfied this request, aided by his Bedouin allies. Among his assignments during the rebellion was the protection from Bedouin raiders of a supply route which the Ottomans used to send <b>ammunition</b> <b>to</b> their troops in Hauran. Aqil and his men accomplished the task successfully.|$|E
5|$|In 1915 Collins {{was one of}} 417,000 Australians who enlisted and was {{a member}} of the First Australian Imperial Force (AIF) as a {{reinforcement}} for the Australian Light Horse. He served in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign and later on the Western Front, carting <b>ammunition</b> <b>to</b> the artillery shelling the German lines. At the end of the War, Collins was a Lance Corporal.|$|E
5|$|Recommissioned on 17 November 1898, with Commander Charles S. Sperry in command, Yorktown sailed {{again for}} the Far East on 7 January 1899. Rumors of German machinations in Samoa {{lengthened}} Yorktowns stay at Hawaii from {{a few days to}} a few weeks; but, when the anticipated trouble failed to materialize, Yorktown resumed her voyage to the Philippine Islands. On 23 February, she arrived at Cavite Navy Yard, near Manila where patrolled to prevent gun-runners thought to be supplying guns and <b>ammunition</b> <b>to</b> the Insurrectos, Filipinos fighting for independence.|$|E

5|$|The 5.7×28mm {{cartridge}} weighs 6.0grams (93grains)—roughly {{half as much}} as {{a typical}} 9×19mm Parabellum cartridge—making extra ammunition less burdensome, or allowing more <b>ammunition</b> <b>to</b> be carried for the same weight. Since the 5.7×28mm cartridge also has a relatively small diameter, a relatively high number of cartridges can be contained in a magazine. The cartridge has a loud report and produces considerable muzzle flash (when fired from a pistol), but it has roughly 30 percent less recoil than the 9×19mm cartridge, improving controllability. Due to its high velocity, the 5.7×28mm also exhibits an exceptionally flat trajectory.|$|E
5|$|The Dutch Navy {{had already}} {{acquired}} {{a quantity of}} the Hispano Suiza 20mm guns before the war for mounting in torpedo boats and other craft and 6 of these were mounted in the cruiser Jacob van Heemskerck when she made her escape to Britain in 1940. The Hispano fired similar 20 × 110 <b>ammunition</b> <b>to</b> the Oerlikon but had a higher rate of fire and slightly higher muzzle velocity. The Hispano Suiza however was to prove insufficiently durable for shipboard use and would find its niche as a highly successful aircraft gun.|$|E
5|$|The RPF advance caused {{panic in}} France, which had long {{supported}} the Habyarimana regime. Several hundred French troops were immediately dispatched to Rwanda, along with arms and <b>ammunition,</b> <b>to</b> bolster the FAR forces. The arrival of these French troops in Kigali significantly changed the military {{situation on the}} ground. The RPF now found themselves under attack, with French shells bombarding them as they advanced southwards.|$|E

5|$|The {{next day}} at 12:00, the newly arrived 3rd Battalion resumed the attack against Hill 518 from the south, as did the 1st Battalion the day before, in a column of {{companies}} that resolved itself in the end into a column of squads. Again the attack failed. Other attacks failed on September 4. A North Korean forward observer captured on Hill 518 said that 1,200 North Koreans were dug in on the hill {{and that they had}} large numbers of mortars and <b>ammunition</b> <b>to</b> hold out.|$|E
5|$|This {{letter was}} one of several that Travis sent during the siege of the Alamo. Each carried a similar message—the Mexican army had invaded Texas, the Alamo was surrounded, and the Texians needed more men and <b>ammunition</b> <b>to</b> wage a {{successful}} defense. No assistance was forthcoming from the Texas government. By this point infighting had rendered the provisional government completely ineffective, and delegates convened on March 1 at the Convention of 1836 to create a new government. Most of the delegates believed that Travis exaggerated the difficulties he faced.|$|E
5|$|Aside from {{constant}} bombing sorties, Potez 25 and Breguet 19 aircraft {{were also}} used for daily supply missions to the besieged army garrison at Rogatica. They would land under fire at a small improvised grass landing strip, unloading ammunition and other supplies while keeping their engines running and taking off as soon as was possible. On 23 March, a ZNDH Potez 25 was shot down by the Partisans and the crew were killed. Three days later an Avia Fokker F.9 was damaged whilst dropping <b>ammunition</b> <b>to</b> Rogatica but managed to return to base safely. As {{a result of the}} determined re-supply effort by the ZNDH, the Rogatica garrison succeeded in holding out until relieved by German-NDH forces on 17 April.|$|E
50|$|The Ottomans were officially intentioned {{to respect}} their obligations, however, in reality, they {{supported}} the League of Prizren. The Ottoman governor of Scutari sent <b>ammunitions</b> <b>to</b> Gusinje {{to be distributed}} to the local population. Thousands of armed irregulars were mobilized by the League of Prizren all over the region and gathered in Plav and Gusinje. The British Ambassador at Istanbul Austen Henry Layard informed his government that the Ottoman Empire did nothing to prevent the influx of armed bands into the region of Gusinje and emphasized that the High Porte would {{be held responsible for}} the consequences. Since October 1879 there were numerous skirmishes between the Montenegrin forces and irregulars.|$|R

5|$|Between 1941 and 1946 Hickling {{served as}} an {{ordinary}} seaman in World War II with the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve on board HMS La Malouine, a 29-metre French corvette {{taken over by the}} British. The ship was part of Convoy PQ-17, carrying matériel from Britain and the US to the USSR. PQ-17 sailed in June–July 1942 and suffered the heaviest losses of any Russia-bound convoy, with 25 vessels out of 36 lost to enemy action. On D-Day, he was a sub-lieutenant commanding an Mk IV Landing Craft Tank 1013 with LCT 1018 of the 43rd LCT flotilla, which carried several hundred tons of <b>ammunition</b> <b>to</b> Sword Beach, Normandy.|$|E
5|$|In early September, Prinz Eugen {{supported}} a {{failed attempt to}} seize the fortress island of Hogland. The ship then returned to Gotenhafen, before escorting a convoy of ships evacuating German soldiers from Finland. The convoy, consisting of six freighters, sailed on 15 September from the Gulf of Bothnia, with the entire Second Task Force escorting it. Swedish aircraft and destroyers shadowed the convoy, but did not intervene. The following month, Prinz Eugen returned to gunfire support duties. On 11 and 12 October, she fired in support of German troops in Memel. Over the first two days, the ship fired some 700 rounds of ammunition from her main battery. She returned on the 14th and 15th, after having restocked her main battery <b>ammunition,</b> <b>to</b> fire another 370 rounds.|$|E
5|$|Mdina was not {{attacked}} directly {{during the}} Great Siege of Malta, but it nonetheless {{played a crucial}} role in the siege. Ottoman general Lala Mustafa Pasha wanted to take over the poorly-defended city first, but was overruled by Piali Pasha who wanted to attack Fort Saint Elmo. The fort was taken over after a month of heavy fighting, but the Ottomans had lost crucial time in doing so. On 7 August 1565, the Order's cavalry in Mdina attacked the unprotected Ottoman field hospital, which led in the invaders abandoning a major assault on the main fortifications in Birgu and Senglea. The Ottomans tried to take over the city in September so as to winter there, but abandoned their plans when Mdina fired its cannon, leading them to believe that the city had <b>ammunition</b> <b>to</b> spare.|$|E

In the past this town was surrounded by thick forest that gave natural fiction — a haven of safety and comfort — to the Visayan settlers. Although they were brave and courageous, they lacked arms and <b>ammunitions</b> <b>to</b> fight the Moros.|$|R
