40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the existence of}} crowding out in the United States by determining to what degree the proportion of <b>actual</b> <b>GNP</b> that was devoted to investment was affected by the proportion of GNP devoted to federal government spending. The empirical results in the regression estimation tentatively indicate that private investment in new capital is in fact crowded out by federal government outlays. Nevertheless, {{the evidence in this}} regression indicates also that although crowding out does occur, it is incomplete. ...|$|E
40|$|Spontaneous {{shifts in}} output {{originating}} within {{the business sector}} are {{an important factor in}} aggregate fluctuations. This paper develops a simple two-component decomposition of the movement of real GNP. One component is the path that GNP would have followed in order to deliver the volume of goods and services actually taken by consumers, government, {{and the rest of the}} world. The second component, noise, is the residual between <b>actual</b> <b>GNP</b> and the theoretical calculation. The two components are of roughly the same size, but noise has more of its power at higher frequencies. ...|$|E

This thesis investigates the role of Korea's government in her economic development, with an emphasis on its industrial-financial policy. The policy includes governmental provision of policy-directed loans to selected industries at exceptionally low interest rates. Although Korea has enjoyed rapid economic development, her government has been criticized for distorting the economy by changing relative prices facing entrepreneurs. The principal research question of the thesis is, what were the welfare costs of this preferential low interest rate policy? The thesis investigates static welfare cost and intertemporal effects of capital market distortions in Korea, whereas most previous studies have dealt with only the static concept. The model used in the study combines features of several computable general equilibrium (CGE) models, including Walrasian adjustment of prices, an international trade sector, and a simple model to estimate the dynamic consequences of the policy. It obtains estimates of investments under different policies and compares them with those that actually took place. The efficiency loss of factor price distortions is expressed in terms of the ratio of distortion-free GNP to <b>actual</b> <b>GNP</b> for 1978, the year that is associated with the highest degree of capital market distortions. The static efficiency loss arising from the factor distortions caused by Korea's interest rate subsidies is about 7. 4 percent of the 1978 gross national product, which is smaller than the losses we observed for other countries. Mobility of labor limits the distorting effect of capital market distortions. The results also suggest that the total capital stocks are greater with the policy than they would have been otherwise, and the capital is concentrated in sectors that have been favored by the government. The results of the study suggest that the dynamic efficiency gains from capital-intensive production technology and large scale production brought about by the industrial-financial policy might have more than offset the allocative inefficiency caused by the capital market distortions in Korea. The findings of the study imply that if some of the adverse impacts of the policy on social and economic issues, such as uneven income distributions and social and economic injustice caused by big conglomerations, can be avoided, other developing countries may benefit from the Korean model of economic development...|$|E
40|$|This paper reexamines Okun's law by {{applying}} the Box-Cox transformation of variables. Major findings are {{that the effect of}} a change in the GNP gap on the unemployment rate varies from - 0. 280 in 1969. 1 to - 0. 801 in 1982. 4; the effect is larger (smaller) when the unemployment rate is higher (lower); and the linear form can be rejected at the 1 percent level. To reduce the unemployment rate by one percentage point in 1982.

40|$|Traditional {{estimates}} of prewar {{gross national product}} (GNP) exaggerate the size of cycles because {{they are based on}} the assumption that GNP moves approximately one for one with commodity output valued in producer prices. This paper derives new {{estimates of}} GNP for 1869 - 1908 using an estimate of the <b>actual</b> relationship between <b>GNP</b> and commodity output. This estimated relationship is allowed to be time-varying and is derived from a regression covering the periods 1909 - 28 and 1947 - 85. The new estimates of GNP indicate that there has been much less stabilization between the prewar and postwar eras than is conventionally believed.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} main issues that supply shocks pose for {{the conduct of}} {{monetary}} policy. A simple version of the Gordon-Phelps model shows that the necessary condition for <b>actual</b> real <b>GNP</b> to be maintained at its equilibrium level {{in the wake of a}} supply shock is for the change innominal GNP to exceed the change in the nominal wage by the change in the income share of the raw material in GNP. The required "wedge" between nominal GNP and wage growth can be accomplished by any combination of monetary accommodation and nominal wage flexibility. Without this combination a "macroeconomic externality" occurs, with real CNP falling below its equilibrium level. The obstacles to monetary accommodation are examined in terms of a taxonomic wage adjustment equation that allows for differing responses to current inflation, lagged inflation, and lagged wage change. Monetary accommodation is infeasible when there is full indexation to current inflation and creates a permanent acceleration of inflation following a one-time permanent shock when there is indexation to lagged inflation. With "forward-looking" expectation formation in the sense of Taylor, a supply shock is likely to cause changes in parameters of the wage adjustment equation as workers attempt to avoid the macroeconomic externality. The final section of the paper discusses doctrinal debates that originated in part from the empirical failures of earlier Phillips curves that neglected supply shocks. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{literature}} on the exchange-rate-based stabilization has focused almost exclusively in Latin America. Many other countries however, such as Egypt, Lebanon and Turkey; have undertaken this sort of programs in the last 10 - 15 years. I depart from the existing literature by developing a model specifically for the 2000 - 2001 heterodox exchange-rate-based stabilization program in Turkey: When the government lowers the rate of crawl, the rate of domestic credit creation is set equal to the lower rate of crawl, bond sales finance the fiscal deficit, and money growth occurs only through capital inflows. Without appealing to high intertemporal elasticity of substitution, the model does very well at replicating {{the magnitude of the}} current account deficit (5. 5 % of GDP predicted vs. 5 % of <b>GNP</b> <b>actual),</b> the peak in total consumption spending (10. 08 % predicted vs. 9. 6 % actual), average growth rate in total consumption spending (6. 7 % predicted vs. 6 % actual), the peak in durables spending (37. 06 % predicted vs. 39. 5 % actual), and the average growth rate in durables spending (24 % predicted vs. 27. 4 % actual) observed in Turkey following the inception of the program. inflation, exchange-rate-based stabilization, durables...|$|R
