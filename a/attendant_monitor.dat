40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the influence of}} political discourse on the context of English primary school teachers in relation to National Curriculum music. A teacher’s classroom context {{is defined by the}} layered policies of school and Local Education Authority, which are in turn derived from national government policy. The 1988 Education Reform Act and its <b>attendant</b> <b>monitoring</b> systems clearly link teachers in their classrooms to the imperatives of national policies, which have their source in contemporary social discourse. The paper describes the genesis, birth and early years of National Curriculum music in primary schools (English Key Stages 1 and 2). It suggests that the ascendancy of the political discourse of accountability and an economically-justified standards agenda have not helped the cause of classroom curricular music...|$|R
25|$|Parking lot attendants {{can include}} people who simply {{coordinate}} where to park {{and how much}} to pay or they may also include formal valets who will park a vehicle and keep track of the driver's keys while he or she is in the club. Some clubs require paid or valet parking to be used if keeping cars on the premises, to generate revenue and help regulate patron behavior. Bathroom <b>attendants</b> <b>monitor</b> the restrooms on behalf of management; primarily watching for policy violations and potential liability concerns. In strip clubs, policy enforcement can range from watching for drug use, sex, fighting, and other activities the club would prefer to see done off the premises. The attendant will also attempt to keep the restroom area clean, assist with the washing of hands, and if available, provide by request an assortment of cologne, mints, and other disposable items.|$|R
50|$|Trunk {{groups may}} also be {{assigned}} a button with an indicator light so the <b>attendant</b> can <b>monitor</b> their use. If {{nearly all of the}} trunks in a trunk group are in use, the light illuminates. The attendant may push the button forcing all calls that would normally use the trunk to be routed to the attendant console, thus allowing the attendant to decide how to ration the remaining free trunks.|$|R

5000|$|Alcoholic {{air marshal}} Bill Marks boards a Boeing 767 of British Aqualantic Airlines (cf. British Airways, Virgin Atlantic), from New York City to London Heathrow. He {{sits next to}} Jen Summers, who has {{switched}} seats so she can be by the window. After takeoff, Marks receives a text message on his secure phone stating that someone will die every 20 minutes unless $150 million is transferred to a specified bank account. Marks breaks protocol and consults Jack Hammond, the other air marshal, who dismisses the threat. Marks also checks his phone. Marks, however, has Summers and flight <b>attendant</b> Nancy <b>monitor</b> the security cameras while texting the mysterious person to try to identify him.|$|R
25|$|In spring 2005, {{the current}} CBTC-enabled R143-class {{equipment}} {{was expected to}} run under full automation with a single operator (known as OPTO, or One Person Train Operation) acting as an <b>attendant</b> to <b>monitor</b> the train's operation and take over manual operation if necessary. However, technical mishaps including the test train rolling away by itself delayed the start of automatic train operation. The project caused numerous service disruptions on the L at night and on weekends. Frequently, service was shut down in separate sections of the line, usually from Eighth Avenue to Lorimer Street, Lorimer to Broadway Junction, or Broadway Junction to Rockaway Parkway. During this time, shuttle buses served suspended areas. This project also required the temporary closing of some stations, either in one direction or both directions, and for the line to be operated in two sections.|$|R
60|$|In truth, {{this was}} the very Mrs Wickam who had {{superseded}} Mrs Richards as the nurse of little Paul, and who considered herself to have gained the loss in question, under {{the roof of the}} amiable Pipchin. The excellent and thoughtful old system, hallowed by long prescription, which has usually picked out from the rest of mankind the most dreary and uncomfortable people that could possibly be laid hold of, to act as instructors of youth, finger-posts to the virtues, matrons, <b>monitors,</b> <b>attendants</b> on sick beds, and the like, had established Mrs Wickam in very good business as a nurse, and had led to her serious qualities being particularly commended by an admiring and numerous connexion.|$|R
40|$|Atrial {{fibrillation}} (AF) is {{the most}} common cardiac arrhythmia in the elderly, affecting 1 in 20 adults over the age of 70  years. Stroke is a major yet highly preventable complication of AF, and the strokes related to AF often are disabling and fatal. Warfarin is the treatment of choice in high-risk patients with AF, and its superior efficacy over aspirin for preventing stroke in these patients is widely recognized. However, several eligible patients with AF are not being treated with warfarin or are being treated inadequately, largely because of concerns regarding the <b>attendant</b> strict <b>monitoring,</b> drug interactions, and risk of major bleeding. As such, alternative antithrombotic therapies that can rival or exceed the efficacy of warfarin, yet compare favorably with its administration and side effect profile, are being sought. One such strategy, the use of a combination antiplatelet regimen, for stroke prevention in high-risk patients with nonvalvular AF was investigated recently in two clinical trials. This article reviews the role of combination antiplatelet regimens in stroke prevention for patients with AF. Other therapies discussed include oral anticoagulation, single antiplatelet therapies, oral anticoagulation plus antiplatelet treatment, direct thrombin inhibitors, and factor Xa inhibitors...|$|R
40|$|In Burkina Faso, {{an initial}} {{experiment}} in training 280 traditional birth <b>attendants</b> (TBAs) was <b>monitored</b> and assessed before extending this training {{to the whole}} country. The activities of trained TBAs in 142 villages were continuously recorded. File cards were filled out for 6129 women registered by the TBAs {{in the course of}} the prepartum, delivery and postpartum. The risk factors and the decisions associated with these procedures were standardized for all the villages involved in the study. In addition to the evaluation of the work of the TBAs, registering the women enabled us to assess the obstetrical pathology found, and to estimate, in a rural environment, the maternal mortality ratio, which amounts to 452 for 100 000 deliveries (27 deaths). Obstructed labour is the main factor leading to complications and maternal death. However, the majority of the deaths occur during postpartum, and the causes for these are not well defined by the TBAs. © 1993 Oxford University Press.

40|$|Background: Neonatal deaths {{account for}} over 40 % of all under- 5 year deaths; their {{reduction}} is increasingly critical for achieving Millennium Development Goal 4. An estimated 3 million newborns die annually {{during their first}} month of life; half of these deaths occur during delivery or within 24 hours. Every year, 6 million babies require help to breathe immediately after birth. Resuscitation training to help babies breathe and prevent/manage birth asphyxia is not routine in low-middle income facility settings. Helping Babies Breathe (HBB), a simulation-training program for babies wherever they are born, was developed for use in low-middle income countries. We evaluated whether HBB training of facility birth attendants reduces perinatal mortality in the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development’s Global Network research sites. Methods/design: We hypothesize that a two-year prospective pre-post study to evaluate {{the impact of a}} facility-based training package, including HBB and essential newborn care, will reduce all perinatal mortality (fresh stillbirth or neonatal death prior to 7 days) among the Global Network’s Maternal Neonatal Health Registry births ≥ 1500 grams in the study clusters served by the facilities. We will also evaluate the effectiveness of the HBB training program changing on facility-based perinatal mortality and resuscitation practices. Seventy-one health facilities serving 52 geographically-defined study clusters in Belgaum and Nagpur, India, and Eldoret, Kenya, and 30, 000 women will be included. Primary outcome data will be collected by staff not involved in the HBB intervention. Additional data on resuscitations, resuscitation debriefings, death audits, quality monitoring and improvement will be collected. HBB training will include training of MTs, facility level birth <b>attendants,</b> and quality <b>monitoring</b> and improvement activities. Discussion: Our study will evaluate the effect of a HBB/ENC training and quality monitoring and improvement package on perinatal mortality using a large multicenter design and approach in 71 resource-limited health facilities, leveraging an existing birth registry to provide neonatal outcomes through day 7. The study will provide the evidence base, lessons learned, and best practices that will be essential to guiding future policy and investment in neonatal resuscitation.
