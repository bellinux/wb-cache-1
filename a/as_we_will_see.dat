25|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the behavior of the theory at large and small momenta, a key quantity is the propagator. For a Yang–Mills theory we have to consider both the gluon and the ghost propagators. At large momenta (ultraviolet limit), the question was completely settled with the discovery of the asymptotic freedom. In this case it is seen that the theory becomes free (trivial ultraviolet fixed point for renormalization group) and both the gluon and ghost propagators are those of a free massless particle. The asymptotic states of the theory are represented by massless gluons that carry the interaction. The coupling runs to zero <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> in the next section.|$|E

25|$|It {{is at this}} point, the {{beginning}} of 1907, that I propose to bring this first volume to an end. The 25-year-old Picasso is about to conjure up a quintet of Dionysiac Demoiselles on his huge new canvas. The execution of this painting would make a dramatic climax to these pages. However, it would imply that Picasso's great revolutionary work constitutes a conclusion to all that has gone before. It does not. For all that the Demoiselles is rooted in Picasso's past, {{not to speak of}} such precursors as the Iron Age Iberians, El Greco, Gauguin and Cézanne, it is essentially a beginning: the most innovative painting since Giotto. <b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> in the next volume, it established a new pictorial syntax; it enabled people to perceive things with new eyes, new minds, new awareness. Les Demoiselles d'Avignon is the first unequivocally 20th-century masterpiece, a principal detonator of the modern movement, the cornerstone of 20th-century art. For Picasso it would also be a rite of passage: what he called an exorcism.' It cleared the way for cubism. It likewise banished the artist's demons. Later, these demons would return and require further exorcism. For the next decade, however, Picasso would feel as free and creative and 'as overworked' as God.|$|E

2500|$|In {{classical}} statistical mechanics, {{the number}} of microstates is actually uncountably infinite, since the properties of classical systems are continuous. For example, a microstate of a classical ideal gas is specified by the positions and momenta of all the atoms, which range continuously over the real numbers. If we want to define Ω, {{we have to come}} up with a method of grouping the microstates together to obtain a countable set. This procedure is known as coarse graining. In the case of the ideal gas, we count two states of an atom as the [...] "same" [...] state if their positions and momenta are within δx and δp of each other. Since the values of δx and δp can be chosen arbitrarily, the entropy is not uniquely defined. It is defined only up to an additive constant. (<b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>see,</b> the thermodynamic definition of entropy is also defined only up to a constant.) ...|$|E
2500|$|This {{turns the}} set of such {{sequences}} into a commutative ring, which {{is in fact a}} real algebra A. We have a natural embedding of R in A by identifying the real number r with the sequence (r, r, r, …) and this identification preserves the corresponding algebraic operations of the reals. The intuitive motivation is, for example, to represent an infinitesimal number using a sequence that approaches zero. The inverse of such a sequence would represent an infinite number. <b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> below, the difficulties arise because of the need to define rules for comparing such sequences in a manner that, although inevitably somewhat arbitrary, must be self-consistent and well defined. For example, we may have two sequences that differ in their first n members, but are equal after that; such sequences should clearly be considered as representing the same hyperreal number. Similarly, most sequences oscillate randomly forever, and we must find some way of taking such a sequence and interpreting it as, say, , where [...] is a certain infinitesimal number.|$|E
2500|$|Though the Republic {{was only}} a small country, with a small {{population}} (about two million inhabitants when England had five million, and France already 20 million), these strategic drawbacks were more than compensated for by the economic and [...] financial might of the Republic. Uniquely in Europe in this age, the Dutch state was able to tap the already sophisticated Dutch capital market, {{without having to go}} through banking intermediaries, to finance emergency military spending by borrowing. At the same time the taxing capacity was sufficient to service the still-manageable public debt this engendered. In case of need, the Republic could therefore rapidly expand its standing army by hiring mercenaries in [...] "congenial" [...] markets, like Scotland, the Protestant Swiss Cantons, and sundry Protestant German principalities, foremost Prussia. This was most spectacularly demonstrated {{in the months leading up}} to the Dutch invasion of England in 1688, when the standing army was simply doubled in size by hiring Prussian troops. But it also applied during most of the period under consideration (though it failed miserably in 1672, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>see).</b>|$|E

Following this had come a journey to Africa and into the jungle in search of Mr. Rover, and this mission accomplished, the Rover boys had gone West to establish a mining claim in which their father was interested. This claim was disputed by the Baxters, and when the Rovers won out and went for a pleasure trip on the Great Lakes, the Baxters {{did their best to}} bring Dick, Tom, and Sam to grief. But instead of accomplishing their purpose they failed once more, and Arnold Baxter was returned to the prison from which he had escaped some months before.

30|$|Many other {{scheduling}} {{techniques were}} proposed that are applicable to TSCH networks or {{to one of}} its forerunners, the WirelessHART standard [26].

Traffic awareness is an important property for improving throughput <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> also <b>see</b> {{in the evaluation of}} this paper. However, centralized scheduling algorithms come with a high overhead for building, distributing, and maintaining the schedule, especially in large networks. Therefore, many decentralized approaches were suggested, such as DeTAS [29] and DIS_TSCH [30].|$|R

Connectionism is the hypothesis that distributed computations are capable of instantiating intelligent functions without relying on the representational character of symbols, but rather on the computational states themselves which are cal 1 ~ distributed representations (Haugeland, 1991). This distinction puts connectionism at odds with symbolic theory. The current debates tend to be over which theory will yield intelligent systems [...] symbolic or connectionist?

New solution techniques are required, and to contain the complexity this paper considers the relatively simpler scenario of a single-hop network (<b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> soon <b>see</b> solutions for even this restricted scenario are non-trivial). Our subsequent work in [11, 12] has extended our solution technique to multihop networks, with corresponding increase in solution complexity (discussion of which {{is beyond the scope of}} the current paper).|$|R
