5|$|Prior to 1916, J. Grossman's Sons {{contacted}} American jazz composers Peter DeRose and Ivan Reid {{to write}} a song about Grapico. DeRose, who would later {{be inducted into the}} Songwriters Hall of Fame, produced the piano accompanied song, Meet Me in the Land of Grapico. Meet Me in the Land of Grapico is a sentimental ballad from Tin Pan Alley that imagined a faraway Land of Grapico where love lives forever. The song (see below) and its cover sheet alluded to <b>a</b> <b>grape</b> vine-covered arbor in the Land of Grapico, even though Grapico contained no grape juice. Dedicating the song to all the drinkers of Grapico, J. Grossman's Sons published the song in 1916 and provided it free on request.|$|E

5|$|Within {{minutes of}} the British attack, Ceylon {{surrendered}} and boats from Magicienne sought but failed to take possession of her. The French crew drove the captured East Indiaman on shore, joined shortly afterwards by Minerve, Bellone and later by Victor, so that by 6:30 pm the entire French force was grounded and all but Bellone prevented from firing their main broadsides by beached ships blocking their arc of fire. Bellone however was ideally positioned to maintain her fire on Nereide from her beached position, and at 7:00 pm a cannon shot cut Nereides stern anchor cable. The British frigate swung around, presenting her stern to Bellone and pulling both her broadsides away from the French squadron. Raked by Bellone and desperate to return fire, Willoughby had the bow anchor cable cut, bringing {{a portion of his}} ship's starboard broadside to bear on Bellone. At 8:00 pm, Duperré was seriously wounded in the cheek by shrapnel from <b>a</b> <b>grape</b> shot fired by Nereide; Ensign Vigoureux concealed his unconscious body under a signal flag and discreetly brought him below decks while Bouvet assumed command of the French squadron on board Bellone, placing Lieutenant Albin Roussin in charge of Minerve. Building an improvised bridge between the French ships and the shore, Bouvet increased the men and ammunition reaching Bellone and thus significantly increased her rate of fire. He also had the rail removed between the foredeck and the quarterdeck of Minerve, and had iron hooks nailed to the freeboard below the starboard gangway as to provide attachment points for additional guns, thus building a continuous second deck on his frigate where he constituted a complete second battery. By 10:00 pm Nereide was a wreck, receiving shot from several sides, with most of her guns dismounted and casualties mounting to over 200: the first lieutenant was dying, the second was severely wounded and Willoughby's left eye had been dislodged from its socket by a wooden splinter. Recognising her battered state, Bouvet then diverted fire from Nereide to concentrate on Magicienne.|$|E

25|$|Pinot noir {{is almost}} {{certainly}} a very ancient variety that may be {{only one or two}} generations removed from wild, Vitis sylvestris, vines.

25|$|Under Argentine wine laws, if <b>a</b> <b>grape</b> name {{appears on}} the wine label, at least 80% of the wine must be {{composed}} that grape variety.

Very vigorous vines, these varieties are able to produce many clusters weighing as much as 9 pounds (4kg) and tend to produce pink or deeply colored white wines that oxidize easily and often have noticeable sweetness.|$|E

25|$|Another myth {{associated}} with Boötes by Hyginus {{is that of}} Icarius, who was schooled as <b>a</b> <b>grape</b> farmer and winemaker by Dionysus.

Maera, Icarius' dog, brought his daughter Erigone to her father's body, whereupon both she and the dog committed suicide. Zeus then chose to honor all three by placing them in the sky as constellations: Icarius as Boötes, Erigone as Virgo, and Maera as Canis Major or Canis Minor.|$|E

25|$|The exact {{origins of}} Muscadet wine, and its {{association}} with the Melon de Bourgogne grape, is not clear. One estate near Nantes, Château de la Cassemichère, claims that the first Melon de Bourgogne vines used to make Muscadet were transported from Burgundy and planted in their vineyards in 1740. However, most ampelographers believe that the Melon de Bourgogne grape {{was introduced to the}} Pays Nantais region in the 17th century by Dutch trader looking for a sufficient source of neutral, white wines that could be distilled into brandewijn. Following the deep freeze of 1709, most of the red grape varieties were severely damaged and replaced by the hardier Melon de Bourgogne. The French ampelographer Pierre Galet found evidence that following that deep freeze, King Louis XIV ordered the replanting himself with <b>a</b> <b>grape</b> called Muscadent blanc that was most likely the Melon de Bourgogne.|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{fermentation}} {{characteristics of}} ice wines made from freeze-dried Muscat Bailey <b>A</b> <b>grapes</b> were determined.

The content of alcohol was 9. 6 % in conventional wine but was 10. 3 and 10. 6 % in ice wines at 34 and 40 oBx, respectively. It was {{observed that the}} red and violet colors of ice wines at 34 and 40 oBx became dominant compared to the controls.
