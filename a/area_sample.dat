40|$|Summary: The {{properties}} of a variable <b>area</b> <b>sampling</b> technique, {{by which the}} observer varies the searchradius to obtain approximately a prescribed number of woody plants in each tier measured, were determined by (i) comparison of fixed area and variable <b>area</b> <b>sampling</b> of a computer-mapped shrub population; (ii) comparison of results from fixed area and variable <b>area</b> <b>sampling</b> of woody plants exceeding about 2 m height in a rata-kamahi forest; (iii) two variable area surveys of woody plants exceeding 30 cm height in a beech forest. Variable <b>area</b> <b>sampling</b> gave unbiased estimates of crown area and plant density in the computer-mapped population. These were as precise as estimates obtained by fixed <b>area</b> <b>sampling</b> when sampling intensities were equal. For {{the same number of}} plots, 20 m x 20 m fixed <b>area</b> <b>sampling</b> of density and basal area in rata-kamahi forest was more precise than variable <b>area</b> <b>sampling</b> in plots containing 30 stems per plot, but in terms of sampling intensity and time, variable <b>area</b> <b>sampling</b> was more efficient. Both sampling methods gave similar stem diameter frequency patterns. Two surveys of beech forest, conducted 11 years apart, showed that with about 70 - 80 single-tier plots, differences in basal area of about 15 % can be detected using the variable area plot method. Variable <b>area</b> <b>sampling</b> is robust and suitable for ecological surveys of New Zealand's indigenous forests...|$|R

The results show that fixed-location <b>area</b> <b>sampling</b> cannot accurately predict the dust exposure of a machine operator, even when the best fixed location is sought, the fixed location is quite close to the operator and the bias due to the dust concentration gradient is corrected. Industrial hygienists have known for many years that <b>area</b> <b>sampling</b> is unsuitable for measuring air contaminant exposures in the workplace. Near contaminant sources, the dilution air and the contaminants are not evenly mixed.

40|$|Agriculture {{has been}} {{utilizing}} digital earth resource observation satellite data since {{the launch of}} the first Landsat in 1972. There are three major applications in the U.

The <b>area</b> <b>sampling</b> frame construction process is the largest operational application. <b>Area</b> <b>sampling</b> frames remain as the statistical foundation of many U.

40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the occupational exposure of jeepney drivers to selected volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in Manila, Philippines. Personal sampling was conducted on 15 jeepney drivers. <b>Area</b> <b>sampling</b> was conducted to determine the background VOC concentration in Manila as compared to that in a rural area. Both personal and <b>area</b> <b>samples</b> were collected for 5 working days. Samples were obtained using diffusive samplers and were analyzed for 6 VOCs (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, m,p-xylene and o-xylene) using gas chromatography. Results showed that the average personal exposure concentration of jeepney drivers was 55. 6 (± 9. 3), 196. 6 (± 75. 0), 17. 9 (± 9. 0), 72. 5 (± 21. 1) and 88. 5 (± 26. 5) µg/m 3 for benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, m,p-xylene and o-xylene, respectively. The urban ambient concentration was 11. 8 (± 2. 2), 83. 7 (± 40. 5) and 38. 0 (± 12. 1) µg/m 3 for benzene, toluene and o-xylene, respectively. The rural ambient concentration was 14. 0 (± 6. 0) and 24. 7 (± 11. 9) µg/m 3 for toluene and o-xylene, respectively. The personal samples had significantly higher (p< 0. 05) concentrations for all selected VOCs than the urban <b>area</b> <b>samples.</b> Among the <b>area</b> <b>samples,</b> the urban concentrations of benzene and toluene were significantly higher (p< 0. 05) than the rural concentrations.
