With a molecular weight of only 12-15 kDa, single-domain antibodies are much smaller than common antibodies (150-160 kDa) which are composed of two heavy protein chains and two light chains, and even smaller than Fab fragments (~50 kDa, one light chain and half a heavy chain) and single-chain variable fragments (~25 kDa, two variable domains, one from a light and one from a heavy chain).|$|E
40|$|The {{formation}} of amyloid fibrils {{is a common}} biochemical characteristic that occurs in Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s disease and several other amyloidoses. The unifying structural feature of amyloid fibrils is their specific type of β-sheet conformation that differentiates these fibrils from the products of normal protein folding reactions. Here we describe the generation of an <b>antibody</b> <b>domain,</b> termed B 10, that recognizes an amyloid-specific and conformationally defined epitope. This <b>antibody</b> <b>domain</b> was selected by phage-display from a recombinant library of camelid antibody domains. Surface plasmon resonance, immunoblots, and immunohistochemistry show that this <b>antibody</b> <b>domain</b> distinguishes Aβ amyloid fibrils from disaggregated Aβ peptide {{as well as from}} specific Aβ oligomers. The <b>antibody</b> <b>domain</b> possesses functional activity in preventing the {{formation of}} mature amyloid fibrils by stabilizing Aβ protofibrils.

(Biocca & Cattaneo, 1995) Since Antibodies are proteins whose folding depends on the formation of critical disulphide bonds, the successful recognition of the physiological target, located in a reducing environment such as the cytoplasm, is somewhat unpredictable. For this reason, a general and reliable method for the intracellular selection of Intrabodies was developed (Visintin et al, 1999). Based on the two-hybrid assay in yeast, the so-called “IACT” (Intracellular Antibody Capture Technology) allows us to isolate specific intrabodies, from diverse cDNA libraries of <b>antibody</b> <b>domains</b> [either ScFv (Single Chain Fragment Variable domains) or dAbs (single <b>domain</b> <b>antibodies)</b> ] directly in the cytosolic environment, avoiding any protein manipulation and solving the folding problem...|$|R

Aggregation of mAbs {{continues to be}} a major problem in their developability.

Although the aggregation propensities of antibodies and antibody-based proteins can be affected by the external experimental conditions, they are strongly dependent on the intrinsic antibody properties as determined by their sequences and structures. In this review, we describe how the unfolding and aggregation susceptibilities of IgG could be related to their cognate sequences and structures. The impact of <b>antibody</b> <b>domain</b> structures on thermostability and aggregation propensities, and effective strategies to reduce aggregation are discussed.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Monoclonal {{antibodies}} {{are one of}} {{the most}} useful and ubiquitous affinity reagents used in the biological sciences. Immunostaining of fixed and live cells for microscopy or cytometry measurements frequently employs fluorescently labeled antibodies, in particular fluorescein-labeled antibodies. This dye emits light at a wavelength overlapping with cellular autofluorescence, making it difficult to measure antibody binding to proteins of relatively low copy number or in cells of high green autofluorescence. A number of high affinity fluorescein binding antibodies and antibody domains have been developed that quench the dye’s fluorescence. Using a fluorescein-binding recombinant <b>antibody</b> <b>domain</b> genetically fused to a fluorogen activating protein (FAP), we demonstrate a molecular converter capable of binding and quenching fluorescein, while binding and activating a fluorogenic triarylmethane dye. This reagent converts fluorescein conjugates to far-red fluorescent probes, where cellular autofluorescence is low, improving signal-to-background of cell-based antibody binding measurements by ∼ 7 -fold.

5000|$|Secondary {{antibody}} {{is especially}} efficient in immunolabeling. Secondary antibodies bind to primary antibodies, which are directly {{bound to the}} target antigen(s). In immunolabeling, the primary <b>antibody's</b> Fab <b>domain</b> binds to an antigen and exposes its Fc <b>domain</b> to secondary <b>antibody.</b> Then, the secondary <b>antibody's</b> Fab <b>domain</b> binds to the primary <b>antibody's</b> Fc <b>domain.</b> Since the Fc domain is constant within the same animal class, only one type of secondary antibody is required to bind to many types of primary antibodies. This reduces the cost by labeling only one type of secondary antibody, rather than labeling various types of primary antibodies. Secondary antibodies help increase sensitivity and signal amplification due to multiple secondary antibodies binding to a primary antibody.|$|R

Knowledge on conserved functional and structural regions within <b>antibody</b> <b>domains</b> is imperative in order to rationally design stable and specific antibodies. Of particular interest {{for the design of}} therapeutics are antibody variable and constant domains, which are responsible for antigen binding and immune response. These <b>antibody</b> <b>domains</b> are part of the larger immunoglobulin (Ig) V-class and C-class families, respectively. We find that, although both classes belong to the Ig-fold superfamily, the sets of conserved residue positions and identities differ between these classes. We exploit these evolutionary differences to derive a metric based on sequence positional entropy that distinguishes C-class from V-class sequences utilizing only sequence information. By distinguishing different domain families using sequence information alone, we enable the application of domain-specific design strategies without the need for secondary or tertiary structural information. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Folding {{intermediates}} play a {{key role}} in defining protein folding and assembly pathways as well as those of misfolding and aggregation.

Furthermore, by a single point mutation we were able to trap the intermediate in equilibrium and characterize it at atomic resolution. The intermediate exhibits the basic β-barrel topology, yet some strands are distorted. Surprisingly, two short strand-connecting helices conserved in constant antibody domains assume their completely native structure already in the intermediate, thus providing a scaffold for adjacent strands. By transplanting these helical elements into β 2 -microglobulin, a highly homologous member of the same superfamily, we drastically reduced its amyloidogenicity.
