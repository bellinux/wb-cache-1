5|$|Much of {{the food}} thrown away {{could have been avoided}} (4,100,000 tonnes, 61 per cent of the total <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> waste) and with better {{management}} could have been eaten or used. Unavoidable foods, such as vegetable peelings and tea bags, account for 19 per cent of the total, with the remaining 20 per cent being unavoidable through preferences (e.g. bread crusts) and cooking types (e.g. potato skins). However, the vast majority of consumers (90%) are unaware of the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> they throw away; individuals who believed that their household wasted no food were shown to be throwing away 88kg of avoidable food per year.|$|E
5|$|The larger workhouses had {{separate}} {{dining rooms}} {{for males and}} females; workhouses without separate dining rooms would stagger the meal times to avoid any contact between the sexes. Rations provided for the indoor staff were {{much the same as}} those for the paupers, although more generous. The master and matron, for instance, received six times the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> given to a pauper.|$|E
5|$|Although {{satellite}} {{males are}} on average slightly smaller and lighter than residents, the nutrition of the chicks does not, as previously thought, influence mating strategy; rather, the inherited mating strategy influences body size. Resident-type chicks will, if {{provided with the}} same <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>food,</b> grow heavier than satellite-type chicks. Satellite males {{do not have to}} expend energy to defend a territory, and can spend more time foraging, so they {{do not need to be}} as bulky as the residents; indeed, since they fly more, there would be a physiological cost to additional weight.|$|E

5|$|Before the war, the Belgian {{government}} had planned an emergency system of rationing, which was implemented {{on the day}} of the German invasion. The German occupying authority used Belgium's reliance on food imports as a bargaining tool. The <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> permitted to Belgian citizens was roughly two-thirds of that allowed to comparable German citizens and was amongst the lowest in occupied Europe. On average, scarcity of food led to a loss of five to seven kilograms of weight per Belgian in 1940 alone.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the severe agricultural damage, the government initiated a food ration. By {{two months after the}} storm, assistance pledges amounted to over $37 million (1979 US$) from various groups around the world. Similar to the aftermath of other natural disasters, the distribution of the aid raised concerns and accusations over the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> and material, or lack thereof, for the affected citizens. The Hurricane destroyed some important landmarks, including {{a significant part of the}} ruins of the Fort Young which had stood since the 1770s.|$|E
5|$|Many of the Quest's {{rules are}} {{intended}} to ensure the health of dogs in hazardous conditions. This process begins before the race, when all dogs must be examined by race veterinarians, who certify that the animals are suited and healthy enough to participate. Before the race, dog equipment also must be checked by race officials. Padded harnesses are required, each musher must carry an appropriate <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>food,</b> and additional food supplies must be in position at checkpoints.|$|E

5|$|The <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> waste {{produced}} by a household and its occupants is affected by several factors; WRAP found the most impacting factors to be: firstly {{the size of the}} household, followed by the age of the individual occupants and finally the household composition (e.g. single occupant household). The other factors: job status, lifestage, ethnicity and occupation grouping of individuals were found to have less correlation between the amount of avoidable waste.|$|E
5|$|The {{invasion}} of non-native plants into its habitat {{is a large}} threat to the bog turtles' survival. Although several plants disrupt its ecosystem, the three primary culprits are purple loosestrife, reed canary grass, and reeds, which grow thick and tall and are believed to hinder {{the movement of the}} turtles. Such plants also out-compete the native species in the bog turtle's habitat, thus reducing the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> and protection available to the turtles.|$|E
5|$|All baleen {{whales are}} carnivorous; however a 2015 study {{revealed}} they house gut flora {{similar to that}} of terrestrial herbivores. Different kinds of prey are found in different abundances depending on location, and each type of whale is adapted to a specialized way of foraging. There are two types of feeding behaviors: skim-feeding and lunge-feeding, but some species do both depending on the type and <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>food.</b> For example, Antarctic whales mostly feed on euphausiids; however, this is mainly effective for lunge-feeders, whereas skim-feeders, like the right whales, feed primarily on copepods. They feed alone or in small groups. Baleen whales get the water they need from their food, and their kidneys excrete excess salt.|$|E

50|$|LARA was {{operational}} 1946-1952 {{and sent}} large <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> and clothing to Japan, by December 1949 more than 10 million tonnes had been sent.|$|R
5|$|Bliss {{was left}} in the strong room for three weeks wearing a {{skullcap}} (a heavy vice for the head), thumb screws, iron collar, leg irons, and irons round his ankles called sheers. One witness said the swelling in his legs was so bad that the irons on one side could no longer be seen for overflowing flesh. His wife, who was able to see him through a small hole in the door, testified that he was bleeding from the mouth and thumbs. He was given a small <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> but the skullcap prevented him from chewing; he had to ask another prisoner, Susannah Dodd, to chew his meat for him. He was eventually released from the prison, but his health deteriorated and he died in St. Thomas's Hospital.|$|E
5|$|Clutches contain {{between two}} and six eggs, {{typically}} three or four. Variation in clutch size depends on the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> available for young birds. Presumably owing to the greater availability of food, clutches are larger during {{the peak of the}} breeding season, and in more southern latitudes of the Cape sparrow's range. Both birds of a pair incubate the eggs during the day, switching every ten or fifteen minutes. At night, only the female incubates the eggs, while the male roosts outside or in the nest. In pairs breeding outside of colonies, birds leave the nest to make room for their mates upon hearing their mates approaching. Among colonial pairs, the incubating bird waits until its partner arrives in the nest, to prevent other birds from entering the nest. Incubation seems to begin before the clutch is complete, and lasts 12â€“24days.|$|E
5|$|In early February Amundsen began organising the depot-laying {{journeys}} {{across the}} Barrier, {{in preparation for}} the following summer's assault on the pole. Supply depots laid in advance at regular intervals on the projected route would limit the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> and fuel that the South Pole party would have to carry. The depot journeys would be the first true tests of equipment, dogs and men. For the first journey, to begin on 10February, Amundsen chose Prestrud, Helmer Hanssen and Johansen to accompany him; 18dogs would pull three sledges. Before leaving, Amundsen left instructions with Nilsen regarding Fram. The ship was to sail to Buenos Aires for reprovisioning, before undertaking a programme of oceanographic work in the Southern Ocean and then returning to the Barrier as early as possible in 1912.|$|E
50|$|Morning nausea {{may also}} {{indicate}} gastroparesis. Vomiting may {{not occur in}} all cases, as sufferers may adjust their diets to include only small <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>food.</b>|$|R
5000|$|If, at {{any point}} during or {{immediately}} after the contest, a competitor regurgitates any food, {{he or she will}} be disqualified. Vomiting, also known as a [...] "reversal", or, as ESPN and the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest call it, a [...] "reversal of fortune", includes obvious signs of vomiting as well as any small <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> that may fall from the mouth deemed by judges to have come from the stomach. Small <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> already in the mouth prior to swallowing are excluded from this rule.|$|R
50|$|Also, on Rosh Chodesh {{there are}} often chagigot which have {{included}} Gaga games and copious <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>food.</b> Rosh Chodesh breakfast after davening {{has also been a}} popular addition.|$|R
5|$|Other sectors also {{attribute}} to {{the amounts of}} food waste. The food industry produces large amounts of food waste, with retailers alone generating 1,600,000 tonnes of food waste per year. Supermarkets particularly have been criticised for wasting items which are damaged or unsold (what the industry calls 'surplus food'), but that often remain edible. However, exact statistics for the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> wasted by supermarkets is mostly unavailable; although a few voluntarily release data on food waste, it is not required by law. Similarly, limited information is available on amounts generated by the agricultural sector. Before a reversal of European Union policy in 2008, which came into effect on 1 July 2009, misshaped or 'wonky' fruit and vegetables could not be sold by retailers and were required to be thrown away.|$|E
5|$|Religious beliefs were {{central to}} the Kingdom of Nri. Nri oral {{tradition}} states that a bounty of yams and cocoyams could {{be given to the}} eze Nri, while blessings were given in return. It was believed that Nri's influence and bountiful <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> was a reward for the ruler's blessings. Above all, Nri was a holy land for those Igbo who followed its edicts. It served as a place where sins and taboos could be absolved just by entering it. Even Igbo living far from the center of power would send abnormal children to Nri for ritual cleansing rather than having them killed, as was sometimes the case for dwarfs or children who cut their top teeth before their lower teeth.|$|E
5|$|Sectors of {{the food}} {{industry}} (manufacturing and retail) have pledged to reduce the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> they directly waste, and additionally what they cause households to waste indirectly. This is planned to happen through a combination of: effective labeling, pack size range, storage advice and packaging that extends the duration of food freshness. The latest initiative in May 2009, rather than a new policy, {{is seen as an}} expansion to ongoing attempts to reduce the wider food packaging. The aim is to cut UK household food waste by 155,000 tonnes (2.5% of total waste) before the end of 2010 by helping UK households prevent food going to waste.|$|E
25|$|As of 2015, Seles is a paid {{spokesperson}} for Shire Pharmaceuticals, {{the makers of}} the first drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat BED, {{to raise awareness of}} the disorder she has suffered from since she was a young adult. Seles would eat normal <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> at meals, and then secretly eat large <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> junk <b>food</b> when she was alone.|$|R
5|$|Birds are {{important}} economically, providing substantial <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>food,</b> especially protein, largely but not exclusively from the domestic chicken; feathers and down {{are used for}} bedding, insulation, and other purposes.|$|R

5|$|Termites {{construct}} shelter tubes, {{also known}} as earthen tubes or mud tubes, that start from the ground. These shelter tubes {{can be found on}} walls and other structures. Constructed by termites during the night, a time of higher humidity, these tubes provide protection to termites from potential predators, especially ants. Shelter tubes also provide high humidity and darkness and allow workers to collect food sources that cannot be accessed in any other way. These passageways are made from soil and faeces and are normally brown in colour. The size of these shelter tubes depends on the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> sources that are available. They range from less than 1cm to several cm in width, but may extend dozens of metres in length.|$|E
5|$|The Hamsa mendicants are {{constantly}} on the move, staying in villages for just one night, in towns {{no more than five}} nights, and in sacred places for no more than seven nights. The ascetic practice of Hamsa monks includes daily consumption of the urine and dung of a cow. The Hamsa monks practice the Chandrayana cycle in their food eating habit, wherein they vary the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> they eat with the lunar cycle. They eat a single mouthful of food on the day after the dark new moon night, increase their food intake by an extra mouthful each day as the size of the moon increases, and reach the maximum fifteen mouthfuls of food for the day after full moon night. Thereafter, they decrease their food intake by a mouthful each day until they reach the new moon night and begin the cycle again with one mouthful the following day.|$|E
5|$|The Sajkab'chen {{company of}} native musketeers pushed {{ahead with the}} road {{builders}} from Tzuktzok' to the first Kejache town at Chunpich, which the Kejache had fled, leaving behind a substantial <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>food.</b> The company's officers sent for reinforcements from GarcÃ­a at Tzuktok' but before any could arrive some 25 Kejache returned to Chunpich with baskets to collect their abandoned food. The nervous Sajkab'chen sentries feared that the residents were returning en masse and discharged their muskets at them, with both groups then retreating. The musketeer company then arrived to reinforce their sentries and charged into battle against approaching Kejache archers. Several musketeers were injured in the ensuing skirmish, and the Kejache retreated along a forest path without injury, mocking the invaders. The Sajkab'chen company followed the path and found two more deserted settlements with large amounts of abandoned food. They seized the food and retreated back along the path.|$|E

40|$|This {{project was}} {{initiated}} by the Nordic Council of Ministers and its waste prevention group. The background to the project is that waste prevention is the highest priority in the waste hierarchy according to the EU Waste Directive. One other reason is the heavily increasing discussions in society on food waste in general. The project has been focusing on <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> waste, causes for food waste generation and initiatives to reduce the <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> waste from the retail and wholesale sector. Furthermore it gives some recommendations to measures that could be taken to change the present situation...|$|R
