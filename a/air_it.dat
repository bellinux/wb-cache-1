5|$|Because {{potassium}} {{reacts with}} water vapor in the <b>air,</b> <b>it</b> is usually stored under anhydrous mineral oil or kerosene. Unlike lithium and sodium, however, potassium {{should not be}} stored under oil for longer than 6 months, unless in an inert (oxygen free) atmosphere, or under vacuum. After prolonged storage in air dangerous shock-sensitive peroxides can form on the metal and under {{the lid of the}} container, and can detonate upon opening.|$|E
5|$|Chlorine is a {{toxic gas}} that attacks the {{respiratory}} system, eyes, and skin. Because it is denser than <b>air,</b> <b>it</b> tends to accumulate {{at the bottom}} of poorly ventilated spaces. Chlorine gas is a strong oxidizer, which may react with flammable materials.|$|E
50|$|Despite its {{overwhelmingly}} negative {{reception and}} short run, the series still has been rebroadcast in later years, with VH1 and A&E Network <b>airing</b> <b>it</b> on separate occasions {{later in the}} 1990s, and Trio <b>airing</b> <b>it</b> in the 2000s.|$|R
5|$|It was {{announced}} in 2009 that off-network syndication rights for 30 Rock had been acquired by Comedy Central and WGN America for a combined value {{in the range of}} $800,000 an episode.

5|$|Freshly {{prepared}} samarium has {{a silvery}} luster. In <b>air,</b> <b>it</b> slowly oxidizes {{at room temperature}} and spontaneously ignites at 150°C. Even when stored under mineral oil, samarium gradually oxidizes and develops a grayish-yellow powder of the oxide-hydroxide mixture at the surface. The metallic appearance of a sample can be preserved by sealing it under an inert gas such as argon.|$|E
5|$|Titanium {{tetrachloride}} (TiCl4), a colorless liquid, {{is important}} {{as an intermediate}} {{in the process of}} making TiO2 and is also used to produce the Ziegler–Natta catalyst. Titanium tetrachloride is also used to iridize glass and, because it fumes strongly in moist <b>air,</b> <b>it</b> is used to make smoke screens.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} {{wave off}} the Bahamas organized into Tropical Depression Six {{on the afternoon}} of July 21. The depression became the sixth named storm of the season only two hours later, the first time the sixth storm of the season had ever formed that early in the season. The storm headed northward from the Bahamas, then northeast over the Atlantic, becoming disorganized by July 24 under the effects of shear and drier <b>air.</b> <b>It</b> moved erratically, inching closer to Bermuda while barely remaining a tropical storm. Bermuda received some strong wind gusts, but was otherwise unaffected. Tropical Storm Franklin then accelerated north and northeast, roughly paralleling the East Coast of the United States, and intensified to near hurricane strength. Eventually, Franklin became extratropical along the coast of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland.|$|E

50|$|In syndication, {{the show}} was usually shown on Tuesday or Sunday evenings; this, of course, {{depended}} on decisions made by local television stations. For example, KTRV in Boise, Idaho <b>aired</b> <b>it</b> at first on Tuesday, then Saturday nights at 6:30 PM, while WNBC in New York City <b>aired</b> <b>it</b> first on Sundays at 1:00 PM then moved it back to 9:00 AM. KPTV in Portland, Oregon first <b>aired</b> <b>it</b> Saturday mornings at 10:30 AM, then moved it back to 9:30 AM. The shuffling time slots affected the ratings, and it was cancelled the weekend of May 25, 1986. Reruns aired on CBN (now ABC Family) from 1985-1986.|$|R
50|$|That was {{the very}} first Kids' WB special, and was a Saturday morning preview special not unlike those that had been shown on ABC in the past. However, this special is rather hard to find, as not many WB Network {{affiliates}} actually <b>aired</b> <b>it.</b> And the few WB affiliates that did air the special <b>aired</b> <b>it</b> right after Kids' WB's first broadcast.|$|R
5|$|As {{inert gas}} is {{introduced}} into {{a mixture of}} hydrocarbon vapors and <b>air,</b> <b>it</b> increases the lower flammable limit or lowest concentration at which the vapors can be ignited. At {{the same time it}} decreases the upper flammable limit or highest concentration at which the vapors can be ignited. When the total concentration of oxygen in the tank reaches about 11%, the upper and lower flammable limits converge and the flammable range disappears.|$|E
5|$|In October 2014, Apple {{released}} the iPad Air 2 and the iPad Mini 3. The iPad Air 2 {{is the first}} iOS device to feature a triple core CPU and 2GB of RAM. As well as being thinner and faster than its predecessor, the iPad <b>Air,</b> <b>it</b> features Touch ID and is available with a gold color option. The iPad Mini 3 is similar than the iPad Mini 2 in design and hardware, but also includes Touch ID and available in gold color.|$|E
5|$|Iron(III) chloride, {{also called}} ferric chloride, is an {{industrial}} scale commodity chemical compound, with the formula FeCl3 and with iron in the +3 oxidation state. The colour of iron(III) chloride crystals {{depends on the}} viewing angle: by reflected light the crystals appear dark green, but by transmitted light they appear purple-red. Anhydrous iron(III) chloride is deliquescent, forming hydrated hydrogen chloride mists in moist <b>air.</b> <b>It</b> is rarely observed in its natural form, the mineral molysite, known mainly from some fumaroles.|$|E

5|$|Loves of a Blonde was {{submitted}} {{to a number of}} the major film festivals of the day: it was the opening film of the 1966 New York Film Festival, was an invited entry in that year's London Film Festival and was nominated for the highest prize at the Venice Film Festival. Shortly after it was completed, it was purchased by a Czech distribution company called Filmexport, only to be re-sold as part of a multi-picture package to a firm called CBK, which proceeded to <b>air</b> <b>it</b> on television through a number of 24-hour movie channels.|$|E
5|$|Numerous mixed lead(II,IV) oxides are known. When PbO2 {{is heated}} in <b>air,</b> <b>it</b> becomes Pb12O19 at 293°C, Pb12O17 at 351°C, Pb3O4 at 374°C, and finally PbO at 605°C. A further {{sesquioxide}} Pb2O3 {{can be obtained}} at high pressure, along with several non-stoichiometric phases. Many of them show defective fluorite structures in which some oxygen atoms are replaced by vacancies: PbO {{can be considered as}} having such a structure, with every alternate layer of oxygen atoms absent.|$|E
5|$|One {{industrial}} application for helium is leak detection. Because helium diffuses through solids three {{times faster than}} <b>air,</b> <b>it</b> {{is used as a}} tracer gas to detect leaks in high-vacuum equipment (such as cryogenic tanks) and high-pressure containers. The tested object is placed in a chamber, which is then evacuated and filled with helium. The helium that escapes through the leaks is detected by a sensitive device (helium mass spectrometer), even at the leak rates as small as 10−9 mbar·L/s (10−10 Pa·m3/s). The measurement procedure is normally automatic and is called helium integral test. A simpler procedure is to fill the tested object with helium and to manually search for leaks with a hand-held device.|$|E

5|$|Plutonium is a {{transuranic}} radioactive {{chemical element}} with symbol Pu and atomic number 94. It is an actinide metal of silvery-gray appearance that tarnishes {{when exposed to}} air, and forms a dull coating when oxidized. The element normally exhibits six allotropes and four oxidation states. It reacts with carbon, halogens, nitrogen, silicon and hydrogen. When exposed to moist <b>air,</b> <b>it</b> forms oxides and hydrides that can expand the sample up to 70% in volume, which in turn flake off as a powder that is pyrophoric. It is radioactive and can accumulate in bones, which makes the handling of plutonium dangerous.|$|E
5|$|Scandium is a {{soft metal}} with a silvery appearance. It {{develops}} a slightly yellowish or pinkish cast when oxidized by <b>air.</b> <b>It</b> {{is susceptible to}} weathering and dissolves slowly in most dilute acids. It does not react with a 1:1 mixture of nitric acid (HNO3) and 48% hydrofluoric acid (HF), possibly due {{to the formation of}} an impermeable passive layer. Scandium turnings ignite in air with a brilliant yellow flame to form scandium(III) oxide.|$|E
5|$|Shielding gas {{mixtures}} {{of three or}} more gases are also available. Mixtures of argon, carbon dioxide and oxygen are marketed for welding steels. Other mixtures add {{a small amount of}} helium to argon-oxygen combinations, these mixtures are claimed to allow higher arc voltages and welding speed. Helium also sometimes serves as the base gas, with small amounts of argon and carbon dioxide added. However, because it is less dense than air, helium is less effective at shielding the weld than argonwhich is denser than <b>air.</b> <b>It</b> also can lead to arc stability and penetration issues, and increased spatter, due to its much more energetic arc plasma. Helium is also substantially more expensive than other shielding gases. Other specialized and often proprietary gas mixtures claim even greater benefits for specific applications.|$|E

5|$|Subcutaneous {{emphysema}} is when gas or air is in {{the layer}} under the skin. Subcutaneous refers to the tissue beneath the skin, and emphysema refers to trapped <b>air.</b> <b>It</b> is sometimes abbreviated SCE or SE and also called tissue emphysema, or Sub Q air. Since the air generally comes from the chest cavity, subcutaneous emphysema usually occurs on the chest, neck and face, where {{it is able to}} travel from the chest cavity along the fascia. Subcutaneous emphysema has a characteristic crackling feel to the touch, a sensation that has been described as similar to touching Rice Krispies; this sensation of air under the skin is known as subcutaneous crepitation.|$|E
5|$|The company {{turned to}} regular charter {{services}} to Bergen and Stavanger in the 1980s, and from 1984 served the routes with scheduled flights, using seven-passenger Beechcraft 200 King Air. In 1985 {{the company was}} converted to a limited company and bought by Kosmos. It subsequently acquired four 30-passenger Embraer EMB 120 Brasilias—as the second European airline. It introduced several new routes, including international flights to Denmark and the United Kingdom, and took the name Norsk Air. The company bought Norving's Skien Airport, Geiteryggen division in 1987 and started operations from a second base. Kosmos failed in 1988 and Norsk Air was eventually given for free to Widerøe in 1990. Skien operations were discontinued the following year and the airline changed name to Widerøe Norsk <b>Air.</b> <b>It</b> remained a subsidiary until being amalgamated in 1996.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{electrode}} holder is a semiautomatic air-cooled holder. Compressed air circulates {{through it to}} maintain moderate temperatures. It is used with lower current levels for welding lap or butt joints. The second {{most common type of}} electrode holder is semiautomatic water-cooled, where {{the only difference is that}} water takes the place of <b>air.</b> <b>It</b> uses higher current levels for welding T or corner joints. The third typical holder type is a water cooled automatic electrode holder—which is typically used with automated equipment.|$|E
