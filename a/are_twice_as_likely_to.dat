25|$|In animals, {{diabetes}} is most commonly encountered in dogs and cats. Middle-aged animals are most commonly affected. Female dogs <b>are</b> <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be affected as males, while {{according to some}} sources, male cats are also more prone than females. In both species, all breeds may be affected, but some small dog breeds are particularly likely to develop diabetes, such as Miniature Poodles. The symptoms may relate to fluid loss and polyuria, but the course may also be insidious. Diabetic animals {{are more prone to}} infections. The long-term complications recognized in humans are much rarer in animals. The principles of treatment (weight loss, oral antidiabetics, subcutaneous insulin) and management of emergencies (e.g. ketoacidosis) are similar to those in humans.|$|E
25|$|Girls {{are most}} likely to enjoy high {{self-esteem}} when engaged in supportive relationships with friends, the most important function of friendship to them is having someone who can provide social and moral support. When they fail to win friends' approval or couldn't find someone with whom to share common activities and common interests, in these cases, girls suffer from low self-esteem. In contrast, boys are more concerned with establishing and asserting their independence and defining their relation to authority. As such, {{they are more likely to}} derive high self-esteem from their ability to successfully influence their friends; on the other hand, the lack of romantic competence, for example, failure to win or maintain the affection of the opposite or same-sex (depending on sexual orientation), is the major contributor to low self-esteem in adolescent boys. Due to the fact that both men and women happen to have a low self-esteem after ending a romantic relationship, they are prone to other symptoms that is caused by this state. Depression and hopelessness are only two of the various symptoms and it is said that women <b>are</b> <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> experience depression and men are three to four times more likely to commit suicide (Mearns, 1991; Ustun & Sartorius, 1995).|$|E
25|$|A 2008 {{study by}} Jenifer L. Bratter and Rosalind B. King {{conducted}} {{on behalf of}} the Education Resources Information Center examined whether crossing racial boundaries increased the risk of divorce. Using the 2002 National Survey of Family Growth (Cycle VI), the likelihood of divorce for interracial couples to that of same-race couples was compared. Comparisons across marriage cohorts revealed that, overall, interracial couples have higher rates of divorce, particularly for those that married during the late 1980s. The authors found that gender plays a significant role in interracial divorce dynamics: According to the adjusted models predicting divorce as of the 10th year of marriage, interracial marriages that are the most vulnerable involve White females and non-White males relative to White/White couples. White wife/Black husband marriages <b>are</b> <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> divorce by the 10th year of marriage compared to White/White couples, while White wife/Asian husband marriages are 59% more likely to end in divorce compared to White/White unions. Conversely, White men/non-White women couples show either very little or no differences in divorce rates. Asian wife/White husband marriages show only 4% greater likelihood of divorce by the 10th year of marriage than White/White couples. In the case of Black wife/White husband marriages, divorce by the 10th year of marriage is 44% less likely than among White/White unions. Intermarriages that did not cross a racial barrier, which was the case for White/Hispanic White couples, showed statistically similar likelihoods of divorcing as White/White marriages.|$|E

500|$|Benzodiazepines are {{sometimes}} {{used in the}} treatment of acute anxiety, as they bring about rapid and marked or moderate relief of symptoms in most individuals; however, they are not recommended beyond 2â€“4 weeks of use due to risks of tolerance and dependence and a lack of long-term effectiveness. As for insomnia, they may also be used on an irregular/"as-needed" [...] basis, such as in cases where said anxiety is at its worst. Compared to other pharmacological treatments, benzodiazepines <b>are</b> <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> lead to a relapse of the underlying condition upon discontinuation.

2500|$|Though {{frequently}} underappreciated, unilateral neglect {{can have}} dramatic consequences. [...] It has more {{negative effect on}} functional ability, {{as measured by the}} Barthel ADL index, than age, sex, power, side of stroke, balance, proprioception, cognition, or premorbid ADL status. Its presence within the first 10 days of a stroke is a stronger predictor of poor functional recovery after one year than several other variables, including hemiparesis, hemianopsia, age, visual memory, verbal memory, or visuoconstructional ability. [...] Neglect is likely among the reasons that patients with right hemisphere damage <b>are</b> <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> fall as those with left brain damage. Patients with neglect rehabilitate longer and make less daily progress than other patients with similar functional status.

2500|$|All populations {{experience}} hip fractures but numbers {{vary with}} race, gender, and age. Women suffer {{three times as}} many hip fractures as men.

[...] These statistics provide insight over a lifespan and conclude that women <b>are</b> <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> suffer a hip fracture. The overwhelming majority of hip fractures occur in white individuals while blacks and Hispanics have a lower rate of them. This may be due to their generally greater bone density and also because whites have longer overall lifespan and higher likelihood of reaching an advanced age where the risk of breaking a hip goes up. Deprivation is also a key factor: in England it has been found that people in the poorest parts of the country are more likely to fracture a hip and less likely to recover well than those in the least deprived areas.|$|E

2500|$|Rates of {{exposure}} to distal stressors are much higher among racial and sexual minorities than among majority individuals. [...] For example, LGB adults <b>are</b> <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> recall experiencing prejudice throughout their lives compared to heterosexuals, and LGBT youth report significantly higher rates of prejudice and discrimination compared to their heterosexual peers. In one carefully controlled study, researchers compared rates of victimization among LGBT youth and their heterosexual siblings, and they found significantly higher rates of abuse among the LGB individuals. Comparing rates of perceived discrimination among African American and White individuals, researchers have found large differences in reports of discrimination: 30.9% of Whites reported experiencing [...] "major discrimination" [...] throughout their lives compared to 48.9% of African Americans. [...] Similarly, 3.4% of Whites reported experiencing discrimination [...] "often" [...] in their lives, compared to 24.8% of African Americans. Thus, collectively, research suggests that minority individuals face frequent exposure to distal stressors compared to their majority group counterparts.|$|E
2500|$|Although the {{dominant}} strain in Judaism is that God is personal, {{there is an}} [...] "alternate stream of tradition exemplified by ... Maimonides," [...] who, along with several other Jewish philosophers, rejected {{the idea of a}} personal God. This reflected his belief in negative theology: that God can only be described by what God is not. Rabbi Mordecai Kaplan, who developed Reconstructionist Judaism and taught at the Conservative Jewish Theological Seminary of America, also rejected the idea of a personal God. Kaplan instead thought of God [...] "as a force, like gravity, built into the very structure of the universe," [...] believing that [...] "since the universe is constructed to enable us to gain personal happiness and communal solidarity when we act morally, it follows that there is a moral force in the universe; this force is what the Constructionists mean by God," [...] although some Reconstructionists do believe in a personal God. According to Joseph Telushkin and Morris N. Kertzer, Kaplan's [...] "rationalist rejection of the traditional Jewish understanding of God exerted a powerful influence" [...] on many Conservative and Reform rabbis, influencing many to stop believing in a personal God."
