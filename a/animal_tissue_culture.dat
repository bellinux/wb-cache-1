40|$|<b>Animal</b> <b>tissue</b> <b>culture</b> {{has been}} in {{existence}} {{for over a century}} and, for much of that time, has played a subsidiary role to that of other life sciences. However, the discipline has expanded rapidly over recent years and is now firmly established as a science in its own right. The main {{purpose of this study was}} to research the historical and modern development of <b>animal</b> <b>tissue</b> <b>culture</b> and to gain practical expertise in some of the basic techniques which are employed in a working tissue culture laboratory. Tissue culture techniques were used to study the effects of substitution on the efficacies of three well known, commercially available dyes, methylene blue, toluidine blue-O and Victoria blue-BO. These dyes, exploited traditionally in industry for their powers as photosensitizers, have now attracted interest as possible agents in clinical photodynamic therapy (PDT). PDT is a novel treatment for both microbial and malignant disease. It combines the application of a photosensitizing drug with red light irradiation, in the presence of molecular oxygen, to induce a cytotoxic response in target cells. The major proportion of the study examined the effects of methylation on the photocytotoxicity and dark toxicity of the phenothiazinium dyes, methylene blue and toluidine blue-O, against the mammary tumour cell line, EMT- 6. The toxicities of the dyes and several derivatives were assayed using standard tissue culture techniques and the 3 -[4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl]- 2, 5 -diphenyl- 2 H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT') assay. Both I-methyl methylene blue and 1, 9 -dimethyl methylene blue exhibited increased photocytotoxicity, with concomitant higher dark toxicity, compared to methylene blue. A similar trend was found in the toluidine blue series, but with some variation. It would appear therefore, that, in terms of a clinical application, the methylated derivatives may hold greater promise than the parent compound itself. In addition, the effect of amino substitution on the cellular uptake of the triarylmethane, Victoria blue-BO, was examined, also in the EMT- 6 cell line. Victoria blue-BO and its derivative, MOVB, were extracted from cells using methanol and their intracellular concentrations determined spectrophotometrically at 612 nm and 622 nm respectively. Amino substitution reduced cellular uptake at lower concentrations, but at concentrations above 2. 5 uM, uptake of MOVB was similar to that of the parent compound. These results are important, but it must be remembered that, although <b>animal</b> <b>tissue</b> <b>culture</b> is a valuable tool for preliminary testing, cultured cells are not representative of similar cells in vivo, and cannot replace whole animal testing of potential drugs...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe dynamic {{nature of}} the {{eukaryotic}} actin cytoskeleton {{is essential for the}} locomotion of animal cells and the morphogenesis of plant and fungal cells. The F-actin nucleating/branching activity of the Arp 2 / 3 complex is a key function for all of these processes. The SCAR/WAVE family represents a group of Arp 2 / 3 activators that are associated with lamellipodia formation [1, 2]. A protein complex of PIR 121, NAP 1, ABI, and HSPC 300 is required for SCAR regulation by cell signaling pathways [3], but the exact nature of this interaction is controversial and represents a continually evolving model [4]. The mechanism originally proposed was of a SCAR trans repressing complex supported by evidence from in vitro experiments [3]. This model was reinforced by genetic studies in the Drosophila central nervous system [5] and Dictyostelium[6], where the knockout of certain SCAR-complex components leads to excessive SCAR-mediated actin polymerization. Conflicting data have steadily accumulated from <b>animal</b> <b>tissue</b> <b>culture</b> experiments suggesting that the complex activates rather than represses in vivo SCAR activity [7 – 9]. Recent biochemical evidence supports the SCAR-complex activator model [9]. Here, we show that genetic observations in Arabidopsis are compatible with an activation model and provide one potential mechanism for the regulation of the newly identified Arabidopsis Arp 2 / 3 complex...|$|E

The isloated phloem elements from infected plant showed typical fluorescence indicating {{the presence of}} causal phytoplasma. No such specific fluorescence was observed in healthy phloem tissues. Key words: Brinjal little leaf. phytoplasrna, macerating enzymes, OAP!, fluorescence microscopy Brinjal little leaf (BLL) caused by phytoplasma (formerly mycoplasma- like organism, MLO) (Varma et al [...] 1969) is a serious disease of brinjal (Solanum melongena L.) in India {{and other parts of}} the world. Since attempts to culture BLL phytoplasma have been unsuccessful so far, identification and detection of little leaf disesase is usually based on graft and leafhopper transmission or on electron microscopy (EM). EM is the only method by which the characteristic ultrastruc-ture of phytoplasmas can be observed, but it is time consuming, expensive and not easibly available. In recent years, more simple techniques have been developed for confirming phytoplasmas in plant tissue using a DNA-binding fluorochrome, 4 ', 6 -diamidino- 2 -phenyl indole (DAPI) and fluorescence microscopy. Russel et al. (1975) first used this technique to monitor <b>animal</b> <b>tissue</b> <b>culture</b> cells for mycoplasma contamina-tion.

40|$|Microbial mass {{can be said}} {{to occur}} in one of two states; as 'flocs ' frcely {{suspended}} in an aqueous medium, or as a 'film ' adhering to a support surface. Industrial fermenter configurations, at least since the development of deep-tank fermentation, have almost invariably been based on the use of microbial flocs, and the occurrence of a visible microbial film during fermentation is generally avoided. Exccptions include the 'trickling filter ' in the waste water treatment industry, 'vinegar ' towers, <b>animal</b> <b>tissue</b> <b>culture</b> and microbial leaching. Under the stimulus of increasing industrialization, aerobic fermenters evolved from configurations based upon surface growth at the gas—liquid interface to the use of suspended cultures in stirred-tank arrangements. The application of this latter configuration to continuous operation is subject to a number of basic disadvantages, particularly 'wash-out ' and the difficulties inherent in the provision of an appropriate environmental history for the microbial mass. These disadvantages can to some extent be overcome with fermenter configurations based upon the use both of microbial films and flocs. The kinetics of microbial films are now sufficiently well understood, at least for growth-associated systems, to justify inclusion in the conventional theories for both batch and continuous fermentation. Such theoretical treatments illustrate some of the advantages of using microbial films in terms of increased productivity, absence of wash-out, etc., as well as suggesting the magnitude of the surface area: fermenter volume ratios necessary in particular cases.

40|$|Abstract Background Tpl 2 /Cot {{oncogene}} {{has been}} identified in murine T-cell lymphomas as a target of MoMuLV insertion. <b>Animal</b> and <b>tissue</b> <b>culture</b> {{studies have shown that}} Tpl 2 /Cot is involved in interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) production by T-cells contributing to T-cell proliferation. In the present report we examined a series of 12 adult patients with various T-cell malignancies, all with predominant leukemic expression in the periphery, for the expression of Tpl 2 /Cot oncogene in order to determine a possible involvement of Tpl 2 /Cot in the pathogenesis of these neoplasms. Results Our results showed that Tpl 2 /Cot was overexpressed in all four patients with Large Granular Lymphocyte proliferative disorders (LGL-PDs) but in none of the remaining eight patients with other T-cell neoplasias. Interestingly, three of the LGL-PD patients displayed neutropenia, one in association with sarcoidosis. Serum TNF-α levels were increased in all Tpl 2 /Cot overexpressing patients while serum IL- 2 was undetectable in all subjects studied. Genomic DNA analysis revealed no DNA amplification at the Tpl 2 /Cot locus in any of the samples analyzed. Conclusions We conclude that Tpl 2 /Cot, a gene extensively studied in <b>animal</b> and <b>tissue</b> <b>culture</b> T-cell models may be also involved in the development of human LGL-PD and may have a role in the pathogenesis of immune manifestations associated with these diseases. This is the first report implicating Tpl 2 /Cot in human T-cell neoplasias and provides a novel molecular event in the development of LGL-PDs. </p...|$|R
