50|$|Ammonium fluorosilicate (also {{known as}} <b>{{ammonium}}</b> <b>hexafluorosilicate,</b> ammonium fluosilicate or ammonium silicofluoride) has the formula (NH4)2SiF6. It is a toxic chemical, like all salts of fluorosilicic acid. It {{is made of}} white crystals, which have at least three polymorphs and appears in nature as rare minerals cryptohalite or bararite.|$|E
50|$|Bararite is the beta, {{trigonal}} (scalenohedral) form of <b>ammonium</b> <b>hexafluorosilicate.</b> Its symmetry is 2/m. The {{space group}} is Pm1. The a-axes {{in the unit}} cell are 5.784 ± 0.005 Å (angstroms), and the c-axis is 4.796 ± 0.006 Å. The unit lattice is primitive. (Note: Data for the space group come from synthetic crystals.) Cryptohalite has the cubic (isometric) crystal structure and corresponds to the alpha form. Both minerals have the chemical formula (NH4)2SiF6. The halides of form AmBX6 fall into two groups: hieratite and malladrite. The hieratite group is isometric whereas the malladrite is hexagonal.|$|E

From the diffraction patterns of 13 samples from some aluminium refineries, the particulate fluorine pollutants were found to consist mainly of cryolite, Na_ 3 AlF_ 6. <b>Ammonium</b> <b>hexafluorosilicates</b> were identified in dust samples of a factory of ammonium phosphate fertilizer, and calcium fluorides were detected in dust samples from a multi phosphate and a plaster boad factory...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was the study of {{catalytic}} behaviour of mordenite and ZSM 5 zeolites modified with <b>ammonium</b> <b>hexafluorosilicate</b> in the transformation of ethylbenzene and their mixture with o-xylene. This reactions system was analysed to identify the main reactions that occur in both zeolites with and without a metallic function. The use of <b>ammonium</b> <b>hexafluorosilicate</b> makes possible the preferential dealumination of the outer surface of the zeolites, occuring simultaneously the deposition of silica on the outer surface and at the pore entrances. This deposit formation increases the diffusional limitations, {{that in the case}} of mordenite leads to a significant reduction of the adsorption capacity. The modified mordenites showed a reduction of the catalytic activity and a rise in the selectivity of xylenes. The improvement in the selectivity is the result of the isomerization of ethylbenzene into xylenes and also the reduction of the xylenes disproportionation and transalkylation involving large intermediates. In bifunctional catalysts with ZSM 5 zeolite, the modification with <b>ammonium</b> <b>hexafluorosilicate</b> increased the catalytic activity of the catalysts for these reactions system, with a simultaneous reduction of xylenes disproportionation and a small rise of the paraselectivity, which shows the passivation of the outer surface of crystallitesAvailable from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av.

40|$|<b>Ammonium</b> <b>hexafluorosilicate</b> (AHFS) is an {{effective}} dealumination reagent for MCM- 22 zeolite, and the Si/Al(2) ratio range of MCM- 22 was extended largely (SiO(2) /Al(2) O(3) similar to 300) by AHFS treatment. The physicochemical properties of the MCM- 22 samples before and after dealumination were characterized by XRD, XRF, N(2) adsorption and pyridine-IR measurements. Also, the samples were used as catalysts in C(4) alkenes catalytic cracking to propene and {{the results showed that}} properly dealuminated MCM- 22 (Si/ Al(2) ratio 58) exhibited higher activity, better stability and similar product distribution relative to the parent MCM- 22 zeolite.

40|$|H-MCM- 22 zeolites with {{different}} Si/Al ratios were hydrothermally synthesized, also the parent sample was dealuminated by <b>ammonium</b> <b>hexafluorosilicate</b> (AHFS). Then {{all of the}} samples were characterized and evaluated for the methanol-to-olefin (MTO) conversion. The correlation of structural and acidic properties of H-MCM- 22 with catalytic performance was investigated. The H-MCM- 22 (Si/Al= 35. 1) exhibits best catalytic stability in all the samples because of its suitable acid site amount and distribution. As for the H-MCM- 22 (Si/Al = 35. 1) after dealumination by AHFS, most of the extra-framework Al species were selectively removed, the selectivity of light olefin was enhanced further and the coke deposition seems to be inhibited.

40|$|A new {{heterogeneous}} {{oxidation catalyst}} was prepared by impregnation of TiO 2 from titanium(IV) tetra- 2 -propoxide {{on the surface}} of ZrO 2. The surfaces of TiO 2 -ZrO 2 particles were then modified by the fluorination of <b>ammonium</b> <b>hexafluorosilicate</b> and followed by alkylsilylation of n-octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS). The resulting catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), nitrogen adsorption isotherm, UV-Vis Diffuse Reflectance (UV-Vis DR), and Energy Dispersive X-Ray Analysis (EDAX) techniques. The catalytic potential of catalysts for oxidation reactions has been verified in the liquid phase epoxidation of 1 -octene to 1, 2 -epoxyoctane with aqueous hydrogen peroxide. It is demonstrated that the fluorination and alkylsilylation enhance the catalytic activity of TiO 2 -ZrO 2. A high catalytic activity of the modified TiO 2 -ZrO 2 was related to the modification of the local environment of titanium active site and increasing the hydrophobicity of catalyst particles by fluorination and alkylsilylation...|$|E
40|$|Nanomaterials {{have been}} widely used in catalysis, {{separation}} technology and chemical sensing. In particular, materials with strong surface acidity and high thermal stability are essential in many catalytic applications. However, mesoporous materials reported such as Mobil crystalline (alumino-) silicate MCM- 41 and alumino-phosphate based materials lacked such basic properties: this thus limited their applications in petroleum industry. In this work, novel silica nanoboxes H-dealX and deal-CaA with high thermal and chemical stability were developed by secondary synthesis from alumina-rich zeolites. The whole procedure consisted of controlled dealumination of alumina-rich zeolites, ion exchange (optional) and temperature-programmed calcination (TPC) treatments. The optimum conditions for controlled dealumination of alumina-rich zeolites [type 13 X (NaX) and 5 A (CaA) ] using <b>ammonium</b> <b>hexafluorosilicate</b> (AHFS) were determined. It has been found that the richer the silica content in the parent zeolite, the smaller the average pore size produced and the narrower the pore size distribution obtained. The absence of micropores in the dealuminated solids is also a key point for having high thermal stability...|$|E
40|$|Materials with {{enhanced}} {{carbon capture}} capacities {{are required to}} advance post-combustive amelioration methods; these are necessary to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide emissions and the associated rate of global temperature increase. Current technologies {{tend to be very}} energy intensive processes with high levels of waste produced; this work presents three new metal organic framework materials with embedded Lewis base functionalities, imparted by the nitrogen-rich ligand, demonstrating an affinity for carbon dioxide. Thus, we report the synthesis and characterization of a series of metal organic framework materials using a range of metal centers (Co, Ni, and Zn) with the 1, 4 -bis(pyridin- 4 -yl) - 1, 2, 4, 5 -tetrazine organic linker, in the presence of <b>ammonium</b> <b>hexafluorosilicate.</b> Three distinct crystal structures are reported for Zn-pytz(hydro) 1 D chains, and Ni-pytz and Co-pytz isostructural 1 D Ladders.

30|$|<b>Ammonium</b> <b>hexafluorosilicate</b> {{solution}} {{was used to}} remove the EFAL from the USY samples: USY-A, USA-C, 320 HOA, and from the acid-leached 350 HOA, due to the samples having different silicon-to-aluminium ratios, and thus different numbers of aluminium atoms as non-framework on their crystal unit cells. As with dealumination, after the process the aluminium removed from the framework remains on the crystal and migrates to the surface in an extension that is dependent on the partial pressure of the steam used. This can be confirmed by Si/Al ratio results on the above USYs surfaces by XPS analysis as shown in Tables  4 and 6 and {{it can be seen that}} the Si/Al ratios on the surfaces are much lower for zeolites that have only been dealuminated, such as USY-A, USY-C, and 320 HOA than for the acid-leached zeolites such as CBV 712, CBV 720 and 350 HOA. The resulting AHFS modified zeolite samples were characterised by XRD, MAS NMR, ammonia TPD, ICP, XPS and BET, with the effects of the treatments on the total amount and type of EFAL, the relationship between amount and nature of acid sites, and the deactivation behaviour discussed below.|$|E
40|$|Zeolites such as SSZ- 25 and SSZ- 35 exhibit Constraint Indexes (CI) {{lower than}} expected. Two {{hypotheses}} for {{the origin of}} the lower CI values are that partial cages on the external surface of the zeolites significantly contribute to the overall conversions and that the large cages within the crystalline structures provide less steric hinderence at the active site than would be expected from the size of the pores. The effect of external surface activity is observed by comparing the as-synthesized materials to those passivated via dealumination with <b>ammonium</b> <b>hexafluorosilicate.</b> The external surface dealumination is verified by XPS and by the reduction in reactivity toward isopropanol dehydration observed from materials still containing their SDAs. The external surface of calcined zeolites is shown to have little influence on the CI value. Cage accessibility is investigated by comparisons of structures having larger cages to those that do not and by following the time dependent behavior of the CI values for these materials. The presence of large cages in the zeolites is shown to lower the CI values below those expected from the pore sizes, and the time dependence of the CI value can provide insight into the existence of these larger cage structures. ...|$|E
40|$|Adsorption of n-pentane and 2, 2, 4 -trimethylpentane at 298 K {{was carried}} out in order to {{characterize}} the porosity of a series of HBEA dealuminated zeolites. The HBEA samples were prepared from a calcined parent sample by steaming, by treatment with hydrochloric acid and by treatment with <b>ammonium</b> <b>hexafluorosilicate</b> (HFS) solutions. The comparison of the adsorption results with those previously obtained by nitrogen adsorption, show that the use of this latter adsorptive alone is insufficient for evaluating the changes provoked by dealumination. The narrow mesopores which were found in the parent sample show distinct behaviour with respect to each of the organic adsorptives. Treatment with HFS solutions and steaming causes the most significant changes in the microporosity, decreasing the micropore volumes of the samples. The former also causes a substantial loss of external area. Treatment with HCl solutions primarily removes extra-framework aluminium species formed during calcination; while this treatment has no significant effect on the microporosity, it causes an increase in the external areas of the samples. The removal of extra-framework aluminium species from the mesopores of the calcined sample contributes towards this increase. On the other hand, these mesopores are blocked during steaming and treatment with HFS solutions...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} the textural {{properties}} and morphology of zeolite Y, used as support of iron (Fe) or cobalt (Co) oxides, on {{the quantity and quality}} of the multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) synthesized by catalytic chemical vapour deposition (CCVD) of acetylene was studied. The parent zeolite Y was modified by various dealumination procedures, namely hydrothermal treatment (steaming), treatment with <b>ammonium</b> <b>hexafluorosilicate</b> (AHFS) and combined steaming-AHFS. The ion-exchange and wet impregnation methods were used for supporting the metals on the zeolite Y samples, with the latter method providing the most effective catalysts for carbon nanotube (CNT) formation. Severe dealumination of zeolite-Y by steaming, which induced the formation of secondary meso/macropores and of relatively large particles/aggregates, resulted in significant decrease in the formation of CNTs compared to the catalysts based on the parent zeolite-Y. Post-treatment of the steamed samples with AHFS had no beneficial effect on the catalysts' activity. Moderate dealumination of the parent zeolite Y by AHFS also inhibited the formation of CNTs, but to a lesser extent compared to the catalysts based on steamed zeolite Y. The TGA studies revealed the presence of carbon phases with different thermal stability in the zeolite-CNT composites, ranging from amorphous carbon to well-graphitized MWNTs. TEM images and micro-Raman spectra taken right after growth confirmed the formation of high quality MWNTs with a low degree of disorder irrespective of the catalysts used, the degree of dealumination of the zeolite Y and the textural and morphological characteristics of the zeolitic support.

40|$|Light olefins such as {{ethylene}} and propylene are {{the most}} important chemical monomers used for the production of plastics and synthetic fibres. They are usually obtained by cracking (steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking) of hydrocarbons from petroleum gas oils, and are generally called petrochemical intermediates. As we know, ethylene can also be produced through dehydration of ethanol obtained by fermentation of biomass materials (bioethanol). This may be an alternative way for obtaining the petrochemical intermediates. In the present work, catalytic dehydration of aqueous ethanol (ethanol in aqueous solution) over some solid acidic catalysts, such as dealuminated zeolite X(also called silica nanoboxes), silica nanoboxes acidified by incorporation of triflic acid, zeolite Y, zeolite USY (Ultra Stable zeolite Y), zeolite ZSM- 5 etc. (all in acidic form) has been studied. Dealuminated zeolite X has been obtained by AHFS (<b>ammonium</b> <b>hexafluorosilicate)</b> dealumination technique and has been fully characterized. Influences of experimental conditions on the textural properties of the porous products in dealumination of NaA, NaX, NH 4 Y zeolites and Na mordenite by AHFS treatment have been investigated. It has been found that the decreasing order of the resistance to AHFS dealuminating action is as follows: Na mordenite > NH 4 Y zeolites > NaX zeolite > NaA zeolite; and only NaA and NaX zeolites can be used as starting materials for preparation of mesoporous aluminosilicates by pore enlargement technique of AHFS dealumination. Mesoporous materials obtained from X zeolite(also called silica nanoboxes) show a high hydrothermal stability and a quite interesting ion-exchange capacity. Zeolite ZSM- 5 / 50 (SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 ratio is 50) shows the highest catalytic activity mostly when compared to the faujasite type zeolites. The order of catalytic activity for the catalysts is explained by their surface acidity (density and strength). Therefore, the second part of this study was based on the zeolite ZSM- 5. For the ZSM- 5 series, an increase of SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 ratio leads to the decrease in catalytic activity because of a decrease in their surface acidity. The effects of reaction temperature, the WHSV (weight hourly space velocity) and the concentration of ethanol in water on the total conversion of bioethanol and on selectivity to ethylene and propylene over zeolite ZSM- 5 / 50 are also investigated. It has been found that with increasing reaction temperature, total conversion of bioethanol increases, and nearly reaches 100 % at 250 °C. In temperature range of 200 - 250 °C, the main product is ethylene. When the reaction temperature is higher than 250 °C, the selectivity to other light olefins such as propylene and BTX aromatics significantly increases due to the further conversion of ethylene on strong acid sites. At 275 °C, the yield of ethylene plus propylene reaches a maximum value. The results also show that the yield of ethylene decreases when the WHSV increases and the yield of ethylene slightly increases when the concentration of ethanol in water increases...|$|E
