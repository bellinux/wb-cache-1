The DTA approach utilizes 3 D non-contact (3 DNC) measurement {{to obtain a}} full part dimensional representation at all critical matching interfaces of a part assembly to the vehicle.

Biological mineralization and skeletal growth are frequently accomplished through proteins containing polyproline repeat elements.

The examination has been performed during spring semester 2013 at Volvo Construction Equipment in Eskilstuna. This report, Development of parking brake component, describes the {{product development process}} of the parking brake component for articulated hauler, wheel loader and grader. Volvo CE has problems with the parking brake switch that exist today on articulated hauler, wheel loader and grader. The purpose of this project is to develop one common solution for the parking brake component for articulated hauler, wheel loader and grader. The secondary purpose is to find final concept proposal for each machine. Employees at the Volvo CE were interviewed; they were contacted via e-mail, phone calls and via meetings {{to get the information}} about the machines and the information around the parking brake component. Volvo CE databases were also used for gathering information about standards and pictures. Lots of different ideas were sketched and concept proposals were created with the aid of material from marketing analysis, competitor analysis, target group analysis, requirement specification, function analysis, standards and ergonomics. Eight concept proposals were chosen to be evaluated with QFD, Pugh’s matrix and FMEA. Two concepts were most suitable and developed further to three dimensional models with the aid of Solid Works. The different aspects were taken into account when designing and dimensioning the final concepts. Two models were created with the aid of plasticine for figuring out the ergonomics and dimensions of the product.

40|$|Compared to the {{traditional}} solid fuel geometry for PWRs, the internally and externally cooled annular fuel offers the potential to increase the core power density while maintaining or increasing safety margins. It is demonstrated that for the Korean OPR- 1000 reactor, power density can be increased by 20 % when the 16 x 16 solid fuel assemblies are replaced by 12 x 12 annular fuel assemblies. In this annular fuel design, the <b>assembly</b> <b>dimensions,</b> coolant flow rate, and core outlet coolant temperature are kept fixed at the reference values for the OPR- 1000 with solid fuel. The core inlet temperature is decreased to accommodate the additional 20 % energy. Thermal hydraulic steady state analyses are carried out to determine the Minimum Departure Nucleate Boiling Ratio (MDNBR) margin and evaluate improvement in the design to maximize this margin. Whole core VIPRE- 01 model results show that a proposed 14 x 14 annular fuel design cannot achieve high power uprate because of sub-limit MDNBR in the inner channel. To better optimize the 12 x 12 annular fuel design, the rod dimensions are fine-tuned by slightly increasing the inner channel diameter and outer channel diameter, while keeping the fuel to moderator ratio fixed. The modified design can achieve 20 % power uprate. In addition, MDNBR sensitivity to manufacturing tolerances is investigated, showing that the new proposed design can accommodate typical manufacturing tolerances. Partial blockage at the inlet of the inner channel {{and the impact of}} corrosion and crud growth are also analyzed by conservertive models. The inner channel can accommodate a blockage of up to 43 % of its flow area before MNDBR falls below the 1. 3 limit. The crud and ZrO 2 buildup does not reduce MDNBR margin below the 1. 3 limit, as long as the combined thickness is less than 74 [mu]m- 94 [mu]m. Neutronic analyses are performed for OPR- 1000 with both the solid fuel and the annular fuel. The results from an MCNP model of the reference solid fuel assembly and a CASMO- 4 model show excellent agreement. The benchmark of annular fuel array shows that CASMO- 4 overpredicts the eigenvalues and the slope of the reactivity burnup curve. Fictitiously increasing U- 238 number densities in CASMO- 4 inputs by 10 % produces good match with the MCNP-based burnup code, MCODE 2. 2. The whole core model of Ulchin Nuclear Unit 5 is established as a benchmark using SIMULATE- 3 to calculate the steady state reactor core performance. Last but not least, an equilibrium annular fuel core is proposed, and its steady state core performance is analyzed. The proposed annular fuel assemblies composed of 7. 5 % and 6. 5 % U- 235 enriched fuel rods, and burnable poisons with various Gd 20 3 weight percentages (4 %, 6 %, 8 %, 10 %, and 16 %) can satisfy the design targets, such as peak boron concentration, cycle length, and peaking factors in a certain equilibrium loading pattern. by Liang Zhang.

40|$|Assembly plays a {{vital role}} in the quality of a final product and has a great impact on the {{manufacturing}} cost. The mechanical assemblies consist of parts that inevitably have variations from their ideal dimensions. These variations propagate and accumulate as parts are assembled together. Excessive amount of variations in an assembly may cause improper functionality of the product being assembled. Improving assembly quality and reducing the assembly time and cost are the main objectives of this thesis. The quality of an assembly is determined in terms of variations in critical <b>assembly</b> <b>dimensions,</b> also known as Key Characteristics (KCs). Key Characteristics are designated to indicate where excess variation will affect product quality and what product features and tolerances require special attention. In order to improve assembly quality and reduce assembly time and cost, it is necessary to: (1) model non-ideal parts based on tolerances defined in design standards or current industrial practice of component inspection, (2) model assemblies and their associated assembly processes to analyse tolerance stack-up in the assembly, (3) develop probabilistic model to predict assembly variation after product assembly, and (4) implement control strategies for minimising assembly variation propagations to find optimum configuration of the assembly. Two assembly models have been developed, a linear model and a fully non-linear model for calculating assembly variation propagations. The assembly models presented in this thesis also allows for inclusion of geometric feature variation of each assembly component. Methods of incorporating geometric feature variations into an assembly variation model are described and analysis techniques are explained. The assembly variation model and the geometric variation models have been developed for 20 and 3 D assemblies. Modelling techniques for incorporating Modelling and Controlling Variation Propagation in Mechanical Assemblies process and measurement noise are also developed and described for the non- linear assembly model and results are given to demonstrate the calculation of assembly variations while considering part, process and measurement errors. Two assembly case studies originating in sub-assemblies of aero-engines have been studied: Case Study 1, representing the rotating part (rotor) of an aero-engine, and Case Study 2, representing non-rotating part (stator) of an aero-engine. A probabilistic method based on the linear model is presented as a general analytical method for analysis of 3 D mechanical assemblies. Probability density functions are derived for assembly position errors to analyse a general mechanical assembly, and separate probability functions are derived for the Key Characteristics (KCs) for assembly in Case Studies 1 and 2. The derived probability functions are validated by using the Monte Carlo simulation method based on the exact (fully non-linear) model. Results showed that the proposed probabilistic method of estimating tolerance accumulation in mechanical assemblies is very efficient and accurate when compared to the Monte Carlo simulation method, particularly if large variations at the tails of the distributions are considered. Separate control strategies have been implemented for each case study. Four methods are proposed to minimise assembly variations for Case Study 1, and one error minimisation method is suggested for assemblies of Case Study 2. Based on the developed methods to optimise assembly quality, the two case studies were investigated, and {{it was found that the}} proposed optimisation methods can significantly improve assembly quality. The developed optimisation methods do not require any special tooling (such as fixtures) and can easily be implemented in practice. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

Due to the impact of a variety of deviation source coupling phenomena, the goal of assembly precision optimization is difficult to be confirmed accurately. In order to achieve optimization of assembly precision accurately and rapidly, sensitivity analysis of deviation source is proposed. First, deviation source sensitivity is defined as the ratio of <b>assembly</b> <b>dimension</b> variation and deviation source dimension variation. Second, according to assembly constraint relations, assembly sequences and locating, deviation transmission paths are established by locating the joints between the adjacent parts, and establishing each part’s datum reference frame. Third, assembly multidimensional vector loops are created using deviation transmission paths, and the corresponding scalar equations of each dimension are established. Then, assembly deviation source sensitivity is calculated by using a first-order Taylor expansion and matrix transformation method.

A dimension variation model was developed based on thermal stress prediction with {{finite element analysis}} (FEA). This model was validated against experimental data, analytical solutions and the data from literature. Using the FEA-based dimension variation model, deformations of typical composite structures were studied and regression-based dimension variation models were developed. By introducing the material modification coefficient, this comprehensive model can account for various fiber/resin types and stacking sequences. The regression-based dimension variation model can significantly reduce computation time by eliminating the complicated, time-consuming finite element meshing, material parameter defining and evaluation solving process, which provides a quick design guide for composite products with reduced dimension variations.

40|$|Although thorium {{has long}} been {{considered}} {{as an alternative to}} uranium-based fuels, most of the reactors built to-date have been fueled with uranium-based fuel {{with the exception of a}} few reactors. The decision to use uranium-based fuels was initially made based on the technology maturity compared to thorium-based fuels. As a result of this experience, lot of knowledge and data have been accumulated for uranium-based fuels that made it the predominant nuclear fuel type for extant nuclear power. However, following the recent concerns about the extent and availability of uranium resources, thorium-based fuels have regained significant interest worldwide. Thorium is more abundant than uranium and can be readily exploited in many countries and thus is now seen as a possible alternative. As thorium-based fuel technologies mature, fuel conversion from uranium to thorium is expected to become a major interest in both thermal and fast reactors. In this study the feasibility of fuel conversion in a fast reactor is assessed and several possible approaches are proposed. The analyses are performed using the Advanced Fast Reactor (AFR- 100) design, a fast reactor core concept recently developed by ANL. The AFR- 100 is a small 100 MW{sub e} reactor developed under the US-DOE program relying on innovative fast reactor technologies and advanced structural and cladding materials. It was designed to be inherently safe and offers sufficient margins with respect to the fuel melting temperature and the fuel-cladding eutectic temperature when using U- 10 Zr binary metal fuel. Thorium-based metal fuel was preferred to other thorium fuel forms because of its higher heavy metal density and it does not need to be alloyed with zirconium to reduce its radiation swelling. The various approaches explored cover the use of pure thorium fuel as well as the use of thorium mixed with transuranics (TRU). Sensitivity studies were performed for the different scenarios envisioned in order to determine the best core performance characteristics for each of them. With the exception of the fuel type and enrichment, the reference AFR- 100 core design characteristics were kept unchanged, including the general core layout and dimensions, <b>assembly</b> <b>dimensions,</b> materials and power rating. In addition, the mass of {sup 235 }U required was kept within a reasonable range from that of the reference AFR- 100 design. The core performance characteristics, kinetics parameters and reactivity feedback coefficients were calculated using the ANL suite of fast reactor analysis code systems. Orifice design calculations and the steady-state thermal-hydraulic analyses were performed using the SE 2 -ANL code. The thermal margins were evaluated by comparing the peak temperatures to the design limits for parameters such as the fuel melting temperature and the fuel-cladding eutectic temperature. The inherent safety features of AFR- 100 cores proposed were assessed using the integral reactivity parameters of the quasi-static reactivity balance analysis. The design objectives and requirements, the computation methods used as well as a description of the core concept are provided in Section 2. The three major approaches considered are introduced in Section 3 and the neutronics performances of those approaches are discussed in the same section. The orifice zoning strategies used and the steady-state thermal-hydraulic performance are provided in Section 4. The kinetics and reactivity coefficients, including the inherent safety characteristics, are provided in Section 5, and the Conclusions in Section 6.

40|$|Manufacturing {{variation}} {{results in}} {{uncertainty in the}} functionality and performance of mechanical assemblies. Management of this uncertainty {{is of paramount importance}} for manufacturing efficiency. Methods focused on the management of uncertainty and variation in the design of mechanical assemblies, such as tolerance analysis and synthesis, have been subject to extensive research and development to date. However, due to the challenges involved, limitations in the capability of these methods remain. These limitations are associated with the following problems: The identification of Key Product Characteristics (KPCs) in mechanical assemblies (which are required for measuring functional performance) without imposing significant modelling demands.  Accommodation of the high computational cost of traditional statistical tolerance analysis in early design where analysis budgets are limited. Efficient identification of feasible regions and optimum performance within the large design spaces associated with early design stages.  The ability to comprehensively accommodate tolerance analysis problems in which assembly functionality is dependent on the effects of loading (such as compliance or multi‐body dynamics). Current Computer Aided Tolerancing (CAT) is limited by: the ability to accommodate only specific loading effects; reliance on custom simulation codes with limited practical implementation in accessible software tools; and, the need for additional expertise in formulating specific assembly tolerance models and interpreting results. Accommodation of the often impractically high computational cost of tolerance synthesis involving demanding assembly models (particularly assemblies under loading). The high computational cost is associated with traditional statistical tolerancing Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) methods reliant on low‐efficiency Monte Carlo (MC) sampling. This research is focused on addressing these limitations, by developing novel methods for enhancing the engineering design of mechanical assemblies involving uncertainty or variation in design parameters. This is achieved by utilising the emerging design analysis and refinement capabilities of Process Integration and Design Optimization (PIDO) tools. ii The main contributions of this research are in three main themes:  Design analysis and refinement accommodating uncertainty in early design;  Tolerancing of assemblies subject to loading; and, efficient Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) in tolerance analysis and synthesis. The research outcomes present a number of contributions within each research theme, as outlined below. Design analysis and refinement accommodating uncertainty in early design: A PIDO tool based visualization method to aid designers in identifying assembly KPCs in early design stages. The developed method integrates CAD software functionally with the process integration, UQ, data logging and statistical analysis capabilities of PIDO tools, to simulate manufacturing variation in an assembly and visualise assembly clearances, contacts or interferences. The visualization capability subsequently assists the designer in specifying critical <b>assembly</b> <b>dimensions</b> as KPCs.  Computationally efficient method for manufacturing sensitivity analysis of assemblies with linear‐compliant elements. Reduction in computational cost are achieved by utilising linear‐compliant assembly stiffness measures, reuse of CAD models created in early design stages, and PIDO tool based tolerance analysis. The associated increase in computational efficiency, allows an estimate of sensitivity to manufacturing variation to be made earlier in the design process with low effort.  Refinement of concept design embodiments through PIDO based DOE analysis and optimization. PIDO tools are utilised to allow CAE tool integration, and efficient reuse of models created in early design stages, to rapidly identify feasible and optimal regions in the design space. A case study focused on the conceptual design of automotive seat kinematics is presented, in which an optimal design is identified and subsequently selected for commercialisation in the Tesla Motors Model S full‐sized electric sedan. These contributions can be directly applied to improve the design of mechanical assemblies involving uncertainty or variation in design parameters {{in the early stages of}} design. The use of native CAD/E models developed as part of an established design modelling procedure imposes low additional modelling effort. Tolerancing of assemblies subject to loading:  A novel tolerance analysis platform is developed which integrates CAD/E and statistical analysis tools using PIDO tool capabilities to facilitate tolerance analysis of assemblies subject to loading. The proposed platform extends the capabilities of traditional CAT tools and methods by enabling tolerance analysis of assemblies which are dependent on iii the effects of loads. The ability to accommodate the effects of loading in tolerance analysis allows for an increased level of capability in estimating the effects of variation on functionality.  The interdisciplinary integration capabilities of the PIDO based platform allow for CAD/E models created as part of the standard design process to be used for tolerance analysis. The need for additional modelling tools and expertise is subsequently reduced.  Application of the developed platform resulted in effective solutions to practical, industry based tolerance analysis problems, including: an automotive actuator mechanism assembly consisting of rigid and compliant components subject to external forces; and a rotary switch and spring loaded radial detent assembly in which functionality is defined by external forces and internal multi‐body dynamics. In both case studies the tolerance analysis platform was applied to specify nominal dimensions and required tolerances to achieve the desired assembly yield. The computational platform offers an accessible tolerance analysis approach for accommodating assemblies subject to loading with low implementation demands. Efficient Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) in tolerance analysis and synthesis:  A novel approach is developed for addressing the high computational cost of Monte Carlo (MC) sampling in statistical tolerance analysis and synthesis, with Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) uncertainty quantification. Compared to MC sampling, PCE offers significantly higher efficiency. The feasibility of PCE based UQ in tolerance synthesis is established through: theoretical analysis of the PCE method identifying working principles, implementation requirements, advantages and limitations; identification of a preferred method for determining PCE expansion coefficients in tolerance analysis; and, formulation of an approach for the validation of PCE statistical moment estimates.  PCE based UQ is subsequently implemented in a PIDO based tolerance synthesis platform for assemblies subject to loading. The resultant PIDO based tolerance synthesis platform integrates: highly efficient sparse grid based PCE UQ, parametric CAD/E models accommodating the effects of loading, cost‐tolerance modelling, yield quantification with Process Capability Indices (PCI), optimization of tolerance cost and yield with multiobjective Genetic Algorithm (GA).  To demonstrate the capabilities of the developed platform, two industry based case studies are used for validation, including: an automotive seat rail assembly consisting of compliant components subject to loading; and an automotive switch in assembly in which functionality is defined by external forces and multi‐body dynamics.  In both case studies optimal tolerances were identified which satisfied desired yield and tolerance cost objectives. The addition of PCE to the tolerance synthesis platform resulted in large computational cost reductions without compromising accuracy compared to traditional MC methods. With traditional MC sampling UQ the required computational expense is impractically high. The resulting tolerance synthesis platform can be applied to tolerance analysis and synthesis with significantly reduced computation time while maintaining accurac...|$|E
