5|$|Millennium Group member Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) {{travels with}} his wife Catherine (Megan Gallagher) and {{daughter}} Jordan (Brittany Tiplady) to visit Catherine's parents in Arlington County, Virginia. Also present are Catherine's sister Dawn (Barbara Williams and her husband Gil. In Maryland, Henry Dion (Mike Starr) follows a woman home and murders her; he is later visited by a strange man hiding his face behind dark glasses—it becomes apparent {{that this is the}} man who has been sending Black threatening polaroid pictures. Dion thanks the man (Paul Raskin) for finding the victim for him, but is chided for not committing the murder while Black was in the area. Dion takes the corpse into the woods to bury it, all the while speaking to it <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>in</b> conversation.|$|E
25|$|The book, The Holy Sinner: Sadequain, {{includes}} drawings series titled, Cacti series, the Sun series, Exposition series, Cobweb series, etc. A {{word about}} the Cobweb series is appropriate, because it was created during the turbulent times of 1960s and the drawings depict men and women, even the building structures immobilised by cobwebs <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>in</b> decay and transgressing instead of marching on the rocky road to the peaks of perfection.|$|E
25|$|A {{dispatch}} {{officer with}} MacRobertson Miller Aviation observed the aircraft take off normally, then climb {{to an almost}} vertical position, roll over and dive vertically towards the ground, twisting as it did so. Written evidence from the aerodrome control officer on duty in the control tower stated that he observed the aircraft turn through 180 degrees <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>in</b> a spiral turn or spin.|$|E

25|$|Gwynplaine renounces his peerage and {{travels to}} find Ursus and Dea. He is nearly driven to suicide {{when he is}} unable to find them. Learning that they are to be deported, he locates their ship and reunites with them. Dea is ecstatic, but {{abruptly}} dies. Ursus faints. Gwynplaine, <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>in</b> a trance, walks across the deck while speaking to the dead Dea, and throws himself overboard. When Ursus recovers, he finds Homo sitting at the ship's rail, howling at the sea.|$|E
25|$|Henze {{lived with}} his partner Fausto Moroni from the early sixties, and Moroni planned and planted the {{hillside}} garden around La Leprara. Moroni cared for the composer when he suffered a spectacular emotional collapse during which he barely spoke {{and had to be}} encouraged to eat, living <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>in</b> a coma. In 2007, shortly after Henze's sudden recovery, Moroni died after a lengthy battle with cancer. Elogium Musicum (2008), for large orchestra and chorus singing Henze's own Latin text, is a memorial to his partner of more than forty years.|$|E
25|$|Although the Conservative {{government}} from 1951 wanted to privatise the steel industry, it {{was unable to}} sell the Steel Company of Wales due to its size; however it tried to operate <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>in</b> private ownership. Adamson became a Director of Richard Thomas and Baldwins in 1959, and in 1960 he {{was appointed to the}} council of the Iron and Steel Institute. His position made him politically prominent. Adamson was not a supporter of the Labour Party (claiming that hearing Herbert Morrison speak of the party's virtues had put him off), but he was known to be a 'liberal capitalist with a profound social awareness'.|$|E

500|$|More recently, Kristen Kuster {{created a}} choral orchestration, Myrrha, written in 2004 and first {{performed}} at Carnegie Hall in 2006. Kuster {{stated that the}} idea for Myrrha came when she {{was asked by the}} American Composers Orchestra to write a love-and-erotica themed concert. The concert was inspired by the myth of Myrrha in Ovid's Metamorphoses and includes excerpts from the volume that [...] "move {{in and out of the}} music <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>in</b> a dream, or perhaps Myrrha’s memory of the events that shaped her fate," [...] as described by Kuster.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} written by the band's lead singer, Bernard Fanning, {{following}} a night he spent drinking with bassist John Collins {{towards the end of}} the recording phase of Dream Days at the Hotel Existence. The song {{was written by}} Fanning on guitar, but he later wrote the main riff on piano, which was then converted into a lead guitar riff performed by Ian Haug. The guitars for the song are all tuned down one step; while the guitar finger positioning is played <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>in</b> the key of C major, the detuning brings the key of the song down to Bb, with the song leading off with Bb's relative minor, G minor. During the recording phase, Fanning suggested [...] "softening" [...] the main riff by returning it to the piano, and even recorded this concept; however this piano version did not end up in the final album mix, nor was it included as a B-side on the single.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} year, [...] "American Life" [...] {{was included}} on her Re-Invention World Tour. It opened the Military-Army segment and {{started with the}} sound of a helicopter in the background as Madonna's backup dancers, dressed as soldiers, crawled on their bellies <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>in</b> the middle of battle, then hugged each other as if saying goodbye. Madonna appeared onstage, on top of a structure made up of TV sets, wearing camouflage pants, an olive army jacket and black beret. She started performing the song as war footage of death and destruction flashed on screens behind her. At the end of the song, it showed a George W. Bush look-alike lovingly resting his head on the shoulder of a Saddam Hussein look-alike, as though the pair were waiting for a marriage license. During the performance, Madonna ran down a lengthy V-shaped catwalk that descended from the ceiling and allowed her to reach the middle of the stadium. Toronto Suns Jane Stevenson praised the performance, but called the background images [...] "sober". The performance was included in the I'm Going to Tell You a Secret live album and documentary.|$|E

500|$|A {{correspondent}} from The Daily Telegraph visited Ellen about 22months {{after she}} fell ill. He wrote:The girl's face {{is by no}} means cadaverous. There is flesh on the cheeks, which have a pinkish tint, and there is some colour in the thin lips. The eyes are calmly closed, <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>in</b> healthy sleep. I ventured to raise one of the lids and touch the eye beneath... but there was not even a quivering of the eyelash.... The girl's [...] was quite warm and moist, and the finger nails were neatly trimmed. The fingers are not the least bit stiffened... It is not a skeleton hand, neither are any of the girl's limbs so emaciated as, under the extraordinary circumstances alleged, might be expected.... The child's body is very thin as compared with her limbs.... There is not much substance in her flesh, however; it is soft and flabby... almost ice-cold.... As regards the child's breathing, it is so feeble that {{it is almost impossible to}} detect it; you cannot feel it by holding the cheek to her mouth, and the only faintest flutter is felt when the hand is laid over the region of the heart.|$|E
500|$|The {{central theme}} of the show was unity versus violence. It was divided into five acts with {{different}} themes: French Baroque–Marie Antoinette Revival, Military–Army, Circus–Cabaret, Acoustic and Scottish-Tribal segments. It began with [...] "The Beast Within", an ominous recitation from the Book of Revelation by Madonna and the screens displaying Madonna's X-STaTIC PRo=CeSS installations. Once the introduction had finished, Madonna appeared onstage on a rising platform in a golden corset (for some European shows she wore a lilac one), striking yoga poses to perform [...] "Vogue". It {{was followed by the}} energetically performed [...] "Nobody Knows Me" [...] on a conveyor belt with some of the words to the song appearing on the screens, then [...] "Frozen", during which a video of a naked male and a naked female wrestling, caressing and intertwining in water, their faces and genitals darkened by shadows so as to preserve their androgyny, were displayed on the backdrops. This video was directed by Chris Cunningham, who directed Madonna's original music video to the song. The military segment started with the sound of a helicopter in the background as Madonna's backup dancers, dressed as soldiers, crawled on their bellies <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>in</b> the middle of battle, then hugged each other as if saying goodbye. Madonna appeared onstage, on top of a structure made up of TV sets, wearing camouflage pants, an olive army jacket and black beret. She started performing [...] "American Life" [...] as war footage of death and destruction flashed on screens behind her (at the end of the song, it showed a George W. Bush look-alike lovingly resting his head on the shoulder of a Saddam Hussein look-alike, as though the pair were waiting for a marriage license [...] ). During the performance Madonna ran down a lengthy V-shaped catwalk that descended from the ceiling and allowed her to reach the middle of the stadium. She also twirled army rifles during a march-like [...] "Express Yourself" [...] before strapping on a guitar for rock versions of [...] "Burning Up" [...] and [...] "Material Girl". During the latter's performances, the backdrops displayed mathematical equations along with DNA helixes rushing through the screens. A remix interlude of [...] "Hollywood" [...] featured a breakdancer, a firedancer, a bellydancer, a tapdancer and a skateboarder. The screens displayed animations of tarot cards.|$|E
2500|$|In a 1926 poem {{dedicated}} to the mountain Avetik Isahakyan wrote: [...] "Ages <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>in</b> second came, / Touched the grey crest of Ararat, / And passed by...! [...] It's now your turn; you too, now, / Stare at its high and lordly brow, / And pass by...!" ...|$|E

When the {{remarkable}} Dulce (singer) reached the climax of her song of praise to Nature, she raised her arms <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>in</b> veneration of Maria Makiling. As if on cue, golden leaves from surrounding trees showered the audience like petals from the heavens. The astounded crowd gasped and aahhed in unison. [...] whispered to me, “The diwata approves.” ...|$|E
2500|$|It is {{commonly}} {{agreed that the}} gem cutter who created Gemma Augustea was either Dioscurides {{or one of his}} disciples. [...] Dioscurides was Caesar Augustus’ favorite gem cutter, and his work and copies of it are seen from all over the ancient Roman world. [...] The gem is [...] "set" [...] <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>in</b> the period c. AD 1020, although some scholars believe it to have been created decades later because of their interpretation of the scene.|$|E
2500|$|The United States {{declined}} {{to recognize the}} All-Palestine government in Gaza by explaining that it had accepted the UN Mediator's proposal. [...] The Mediator had recommended that Palestine, as defined in the original Mandate including Transjordan, might form a union. Bernadotte's diary said the Mufti had lost credibility {{on account of his}} unrealistic predictions regarding the defeat of the Jewish militias. Bernadotte noted [...] "It would seem <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>in</b> existing circumstances most of the Palestinian Arabs would be quite content to be incorporated in Transjordan." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Restoration in the Sacrament of the Eucharist. Window in the Ante-Chapel South. 1902. This three-light window {{links to}} the [...] "Man's Fallen State" [...] window {{opposite}} and through the death and resurrection of Christ we have gone full circle and man and God are now reconciled. [...] Now Adam and Eve are clothed and kneel <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>in</b> contrition and look across at an angel who holds out a chalice in her left hand whilst {{in her right hand}} she holds a wheatsheaf. [...] "Man has been restored through the sacrifice of Christ and the Sacrament of the Gospel" [...] is the message and in the centre of his composition Whall depicts wheat stalks and vine leaves (the bread and wine of the Eucharist).|$|E
2500|$|He was {{considered}} an attacking batsman who could score all around the wicket with [...] "a style that is entirely his own". He scored quickly when on form and was an [...] "ideal cricketer". His cover drive {{was considered}} particularly effective and hard hitting as well as attractive - A. A. Thomson wrote of him: [...] "Though a crabbed unemotional Northerner, I sometimes think that if one last fragment of cricket had to be preserved, <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>in</b> amber, {{it should be a}} glimpse of K. L. Hutchings cover-driving under a summer heaven." [...] According to David Denton and George Hirst, he hit the ball harder than any other player of their time (and they were contemporaries of Gilbert Jessop, one of the harder hitting batsmen of the Golden Age of cricket).|$|E
2500|$|Helm {{recalled}} {{her experiences}} of shooting {{the film in}} a contemporary interview, saying that [...] "the night shots lasted three weeks, {{and even if they}} did lead to the greatest dramatic moments – even if we did follow Fritz Lang’s directions <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>in</b> a trance, enthusiastic and enraptured at the same time – I can’t forget the incredible strain that they put us under. The work wasn’t easy, and the authenticity in the portrayal ended up testing our nerves now and then. For instance, it wasn’t fun at all when Grot drags me by the hair, to have me burned at the stake. Once I even fainted: during the transformation scene, Maria, as the android, is clamped in a kind of wooden armament, and because the shot took so long, I didn’t get enough air." ...|$|E
