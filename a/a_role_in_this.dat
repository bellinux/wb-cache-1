5|$|Although cholangiocarcinoma {{is known}} to have the {{histological}} and molecular features of an adenocarcinoma of epithelial cells lining the biliary tract, the actual cell of origin is unknown. Recent evidence has suggested that the initial transformed cell that generates the primary tumor may arise from a pluripotent hepatic stem cell. Cholangiocarcinoma is thought to develop through a series of stages - from early hyperplasia and metaplasia, through dysplasia, to the development of frank carcinoma - in a process similar to that seen in the development of colon cancer. Chronic inflammation and obstruction of the bile ducts, and the resulting impaired bile flow, are thought to play <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> progression.|$|E
5|$|As of October 2011, {{consumption}} of liquefied petroleum gas, gasoline, kerosene, and diesel has cut between 4 and 19%, {{despite the fact}} that more than 1 million cars have been added to Iran's fleet. Increased use of compressed natural gas (CNG) to fuel cars has also reportedly played <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>this.</b> According to the government, if oil products consumption had not been managed, {{consumption of}} gasoline would have increased to 120 million liters per day, while by reforming consumption pattern the figure has fallen to 60 million liters per day. In November 2011, the Government reported that the subsidy reform plan has saved Iran $6 billion.|$|E
5|$|Jackson's {{skin was}} a medium-brown color {{throughout}} his youth; however, {{starting in the}} mid 1980s, his skin gradually grew paler, which was partly due to vitiligo, but also widely considered {{to be due to}} skin bleaching and changing of his features to appear white. According to Jackson's biographer, J. Randy Taraborrelli, in 1984, Jackson was diagnosed with vitiligo, which Taraborrelli stated was sometimes considered by doctors to be a consequence of damage done by bleaching chemicals over the years. However, vitiligo is a rare non-contagious disease; the causes are not known, but a range of genetic, auto-immune, and environmental factors are suspected to play <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> disease. Between 1% and 2% of the world population is considered to be affected. The depigmentation occurs in patches and affects all ethnic/racial groups equally.|$|E

25|$|With {{the threat}} from {{submarines}} greatly diminished by early 1945, the Coast Guard turned its attention to development of the helicopter in the search-and-rescue role.

25|$|Coyotes {{occasionally}} {{lose their}} wariness {{of humans and}} frequent roadsides or developed areas, becoming conditioned to human food by receiving handouts or picking up food scraps. They can quickly learn bad habits like roadside begging behavior. This leads to potential danger for humans and coyotes. Several instances of coyote aggression toward humans {{have occurred in the}} park, including one that involved an actual attack. Habituation most likely played <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> unusual coyote behavior.|$|E
25|$|In many {{developing}} countries, cholera still reaches its victims through contaminated water sources, and countries without proper sanitation techniques have greater incidence of the disease. Governments can play <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>this.</b> In 2008, for example, the Zimbabwean cholera outbreak was due partly to the government's role, {{according to a}} report from the James Baker Institute. The Haitian government's inability to provide safe drinking water after the 2010 earthquake led to an increase in cholera cases as well.|$|E

25|$|Heavy metal {{toxicity}} {{has been}} proposed as a hypothetical etiology of autism, and dysfunction of MT synthesis and activity may play <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>this.</b> Many heavy metals, including mercury, lead, and arsenic {{have been linked to}} symptoms that resemble the neurological symptoms of autism. However, MT dysfunction has not specifically been linked to autistic spectrum disorders. A 2006 study, investigating children exposed to the vaccine preservative thiomersal, found that levels of MT and antibodies to MT in autistic children did not differ significantly from non-autistic children.|$|E
25|$|Other {{interesting}} observations {{include the}} importance of napping: improved performance in some kinds of tasks after a 1-hour afternoon nap; studies of performance of shift workers, showing that {{an equal number of}} hours of sleep in the day {{is not the same as}} in the night. Current research studies look at the molecular and physiological basis of memory consolidation during sleep. These, along with studies of genes that may play <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> phenomenon, together promise to give a more complete picture of the role of sleep in memory.|$|E
25|$|Emotional target cues {{have been}} shown to {{eliminate}} age differences in prospective memory. For older participants, emotional prospective memory cues were better remembered than neutral cues. Whether the cues are positive or negative, strong emotional attachment makes the cue more self-relevant and easier to remember. For example, an aversive picture of a snake biting a person or a positive picture of a dog licking its owner are easier to remember because they evoke emotional responses, as opposed to a neutral picture of an animal that does not evoke an emotional response. It is speculated that the amygdala and hippocampus may play <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> emotionally enhanced memory effect.|$|E

25|$|On 12 August 2004, Azad {{was found}} dead in his {{apartment}} in Munich, Germany, where he had arrived a week earlier to conduct research on the nineteenth century German romantic poet Heinrich Heine, several months after the Islamists' machete attack on him at a book fair, which had left him grievously injured. His family demanded an investigation, alleging that the extremists who had attempted the earlier assassination had <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> death. While alive, Azad had expressed his wish to donate his body to medical college after his death. But he was buried in Rarhikhal, his village home in Bangladesh as doctors denied to take his body for medical research, as several days had passed to reach his body to Bangladesh from Germany.|$|E
25|$|The {{investigations}} {{were widely}} {{reported in the}} press, but eventually junta leader Prayut Chan-o-cha intervened: the embezzlement case had already been closed in 2006 by the then Attorney-General {{and that was the}} end of it. Prayuth was afraid of the rising conflicts. He then dissolved the religious committee of the reform council. However, Paiboon, Phra Suwit and Mano continued to address the leading Sangha's shortcomings through judicial means. In the meantime, the DSI investigated further, and it was discovered that a used vintage car in Wat Paknam's museum had not been properly registered, allegedly to evade taxes. Somdet Chuang was charged with tax evasion by the DSI, and the accusations were reason enough for the government to further postpone the appointment. Fear of Phra Suwit Dhiradhammo and his ties to the army may have played <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> stalling. In December 2016, the National Legislative Assembly amended the 2005 Monastic Act to allow other monks than Somdet Chuang to be appointed Supreme Patriarch. Finally in February 2017, Somdet Amborn was appointed by King Vajiralongkorn to serve as the next Supreme Patriarch.|$|E
25|$|Hence Halbertsma {{expected}} to be appointed professor of Dutch language and literature, and several times such an appointment seemed almost within his grasp, but each time it slipped away. His sharp pen probably played <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>this,</b> {{but there were other}} reasons, too. In 1830, he lost out from the surplus of applicants washing over the Netherlands from the universities of Belgium, which at that time had just seceded from the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, and after 1840 a different type of scientist was called for, with a more specialised knowledge than Halbertsma commanded. That in 1837 he was awarded an honorary doctorate in literature by the University of Leiden, was scant consolation to him. In part because of these disappointments, Halbertsma balanced {{on the edge of a}} burn-out for a long time, and especially in 1839, when he was passed over yet again, he went through a deep crisis. It was only in the 1860s, when he was in his seventies, that he seems to have achieved a state of mental composure.|$|E
