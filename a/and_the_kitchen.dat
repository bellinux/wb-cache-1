5|$|An oratory, {{originally}} {{fitted to}} the roof of the Well Tower but removed before 1891, was decorated with twenty stained glass windows. Ten of these windows are displayed at Cardiff Castle, while the other ten are displayed on site; two missing windows having been returned to the castle in 2011. Other rooms in the castle include Lady Margaret Bute's Bedroom, the servants' hall <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen.</b>|$|E
5|$|A fire {{swept through}} Westminster in 1834, {{destroying}} {{most of the}} old palace, but the Jewel Tower, which was separated from the main fire and was positioned away from the prevailing wind, survived, along with its store of records from the House of Lords. Westminster was rebuilt, and in 1864 substantial changes were made at the tower: the Parliamentary records in the tower were moved to a fire-proof storage facility at the new Victoria Tower; 6–7 Old Palace Yard ceased {{to be used by}} the clerk as a house, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> in the ground floor of the tower was closed. Around this time, the tower began to be called the Jewel Tower once again, partially in the incorrect belief that it had held the Crown Jewels during the medieval period.|$|E
5|$|A quadrangular castle, Wressle Castle {{was laid}} out with four ranges in a square around a courtyard. At each corner was a tower, and in {{the centre of the}} east side was a five-storey gatehouse. Clockwise from north east the corner towers were named the Constable Tower (where the constable who ran the castle on a daily basis lived), the Chapel Tower, the Lord’s Tower, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kitchen</b> Tower. Opposite the gatehouse, in the castle's west range, was the great hall and the Lord's Tower in the south west {{contained}} the owner's accommodation and private rooms.|$|E

5|$|In May 1648, a Royalist {{rebellion}} {{broke out}} in Kent. There were fresh Parliamentary concerns about Henry Hastings and fears grew that he might reoccupy Ashby de la Zouch Castle. Lord Grey - a rival of the Hastings family in Leicestershire - {{was put in charge}} of the castle in August, which was used to hold Royalist prisoners, including James Hamilton, the Duke of Hamilton. Parliamentary worries about the security of the castle persisted and, possibly because of Henry's involvement in the recent rebellion, William Bainbrigg was ordered in November to slight the castle to put it beyond military use. He carried out his orders immediately, demolishing one side of the Great Tower <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kitchen</b> Tower, undermining the foundations and deploying gunpowder charges.|$|E
5|$|The Salvation Army {{gave the}} castle to the Ministry of Works in 1948, {{and it is}} now owned by English Heritage, classed as a {{scheduled}} monument and a Grade I listed building. Subsidence and landslips have continued; the north-east tower largely collapsed in the 1950s, and further major slippages occurred in 1969, 1970, and 2002. One of the three-storey towers at the eastern side stands to nearly full height with narrow rectangular windows in the upper levels. The second tower has only about one-third of its original form. Some sections of the curtain wall have survived, as well as the foundations of the great hall, solars, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen.</b>|$|E
5|$|The castle is {{approached}} {{through the}} castle meadow, {{an area of}} open parkland, lined with Holm oaks planted in the 1860s, and is surrounded by the dry moat, now a garden dating from at least the 1850s and planted with trees and shrubs. Adjacent to the castle are the Queen Mother's Garden <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> garden and glasshouses. The Queen Mother's Garden was built by English Heritage as a 95th birthday gift for the then Lord Warden in 1997, the site having been originally part of the wider kitchen gardens, before being turned into a tennis court in the 1920s. Designed by Penelope Hobhouse, the garden incorporates classical and Islamic themes, with a 92-foot-long (28 m) pool, a viewing mound and a classical pavilion. The two glasshouses have been restored, functioning as cold greenhouses, while {{the remainder of the}} kitchen garden is planted with a mixture of vegetables, fruit trees and flowers.|$|E

25|$|Freed from {{smoke and}} dirt, {{the living room}} thus began {{to serve as an}} area for social {{functions}} and increasingly became a showcase for the owner's wealth. In the upper classes, cooking <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> were the domain of the servants, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> was set apart from the living rooms, sometimes even far from the dining room. Poorer homes often did not have a separate kitchen yet; they kept the one-room arrangement where all activities took place, or at the most had the kitchen in the entrance hall.|$|E

25|$|The grand duke's main {{residence}} was the splendid Palace of Strelna, {{where he lived}} a quiet and misanthropic life and was his {{main residence}} until the revolution.

25|$|The {{original}} layout {{lacked the}} present library and cafeteria, which were added later on. The original library was {{located near the}} entrance to the modern library.

In 1930, on her last voyage under the German flag, Oldenburg was almost lost when the cargo of phosphate shifted in heavy weather. After two weeks in a heavy storm, the longitudinal bulkhead gave way and the ship assumed a list of 55 degrees. Lifeboats, spare yards <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> stove were lost overboard.

The son's bedroom faced the north west <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> and service terrace were on the south west. At second floor level were a series of sculpted spaces that formed a solarium.|$|E

The entrance to this section is through the three doors in the portico of the Second Courtyard: the Imperial commissariat (lower kitchen) door, imperial kitchen door and the confectionery kitchen door.The palace kitchens consist of 10 domed buildings: Imperial kitchen, (palace school), Harem (women’s quarters), Birûn (outer service section of the palace), kitchens, beverages kitchen, confectionery kitchen, creamery, storerooms and rooms for the cooks. They were the largest kitchens in the Ottoman Empire. Food was prepared for about 4,000 people <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> staff consisted of more than 800 people.

25|$|The {{four sets}} allowed for daily {{services}} {{in both directions}} to Trondheim, but only one direction each day to Bergen.
