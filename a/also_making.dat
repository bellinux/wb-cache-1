5|$|Daniel Tack for Game Informer {{rated the}} game with an 8/10, {{comparing}} it to games such as Dwarf Fortress and Towns, but more accessible and with improved graphics. IGN 's Rowan Kaiser awarded an 8.3/10 score, noting that Banished suffered when the gameplay difficulty was lower, while <b>also</b> <b>making</b> the same comparison to Dwarf Fortress as Game Informer. Kaiser praised Banished for creating difficulty through {{the lack of a}} money resource, rather than using money as the primary source of difficulty.|$|E
5|$|In 1894 Biggs {{was invited}} {{to play for the}} Barbarians, and on 2 April, he faced Rockcliff, playing {{alongside}} his brother Selwyn, who was <b>also</b> <b>making</b> his Barbarian's debut.

5|$|The undefeated Buccaneers lost on {{the road}} to the winless New York Giants. Giants quarterback Phil Simms, in his first NFL start, went 6–12 for 37 yards. Billy Taylor, <b>also</b> <b>making</b> his first start, became the first Giant to rush for over 100 yards in a game this season, running for 148 yards and two {{touchdown}}s on 33 carries. Doug Williams threw touchdown passes to Larry Mucker and Jimmie Giles, but also threw three interceptions and numerous incompletions.|$|E
5|$|Armstrong studied whether {{replacing}} the 12-inch guns with seven 15-inch guns would be feasible, but Brazil was probably already attempting {{to sell the}} ship. In the tension building up to the First World War, many countries, including Russia, Italy, Greece, and the Ottoman Empire, were interested in purchasing the ship. While Russia quickly dropped out, Italy and the rival Greeks and Ottomans were all highly interested. The Italians seemed close to purchasing the ship until the French government decided to back the Greeks—rather than allow the Italians, who were the principal naval rivals of the French, to obtain the ship. The Grecian government made an offer for the original purchase price plus an additional £50,000, but as the Greeks worked to obtain an initial installment, the Ottoman government was <b>also</b> <b>making</b> offers.|$|E

On 31 October, his agent, Roger Wittman, {{confirmed}} that Rodríguez and Wolfsburg had opened contract talks to extend his current deal beyond 2016. Rodríguez scored twice in Wolfsburg's 3–0 win away to Lille on 11 December, a result which advanced his side into the Europa League knockout stage instead of their opponents. In January 2015, he signed a new contract up to June 2019. He scored the only goal of the game from the penalty spot on 7 April, as Wolfsburg defeated SC Freiburg to reach the semi-finals of the DFB-Pokal, <b>also</b> <b>making</b> a goalline clearance later on. In the final on 30 May, he played the full 90 minutes as Wolfsburg won their first cup, defeating Borussia Dortmund 3–1.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool were {{appearing}} in their third UEFA Cup final, both their previous {{appearances in the}} final in 1973 and 1976 had resulted in victory. They were <b>also</b> <b>making</b> their first appearance in a European final since their ban from European competition following the Heysel Stadium disaster. Alavés {{on the other hand}} were {{appearing in}} their first European final in their first season in European competition. Remarkably, the club had been in the Fourth Division of the Spanish league system 11 years ago. As it was their first season in Europe, Alavés had commissioned a special shirt that was pink and bore the names of all their 'socios' (members) as a memento of their qualification for Europe.|$|E
5|$|Many Democrats {{were anxious}} to return Senator J. C. S. Blackburn to his seat in Congress, but some were instead {{supporting}} ex-Governor John Y. Brown. Democratic state senator Albert Berry was <b>also</b> <b>making</b> overtures about being considered for the seat. Republican legislators nominated W. Godfrey Hunter for the seat, and ultimately, Blackburn and Hunter emerged as the leading candidates. The Gold Democrats refused to back Blackburn, a free silver supporter, instead opting for ex-Governor James B. McCreary. On ballot after ballot, no candidate received a majority, though Blackburn received 65 votes once, leaving him just two votes shy of election. Treasury Secretary John G. Carlisle was put forward as a compromise candidate, but never received more than 61 votes. Other proposed compromise candidates included Louisville Courier-Journal editor Henry Watterson, congressman Walter Evans, ex-Governor Buckner, Judge William H. Holt, and Augustus E. Willson.|$|E

5|$|Prakash Raj and Ashish Vidyarthi {{were cast}} as the film's primary antagonists. Raj played a mafia kingpin and Vidyarthi played a corrupt police officer, a villain's role he finds more fun to play {{than that of a}} hero. Sayaji Shinde and Nassar played the two other {{principal}} characters in the film. Jyothi Rana played the role of the mafia kingpin's moll, marking her debut in Telugu cinema. Isai and Subbaraju portrayed negative roles as well, with the former <b>also</b> <b>making</b> his debut in Telugu cinema. Ali played the role of a beggar and shared screen-space with Brahmanandam and Venu Madhav. Jagannadh added this trio to the film to provide situational humour. Master Bharath played the role of D'Cruz's brother. Mumaith Khan performed an item number in the film.|$|E
5|$|The new {{location}} of the court is also introduced: Scottish actress Kate Dickie was cast as the Lady of the Eyrie, Lysa Arryn, <b>also</b> <b>making</b> her first appearance in this episode. Although Dickie does not resemble the physical description of Lysa given in the books, Martin stated that her acting in the auditions was excellent. The role of her son (renamed Robin in the series to avoid confusion with King Robert) went to Lino Facioli, and the knight of the Vale Ser Vardis Egen was played by Brendan McCormack.|$|E
5|$|Wilhelm's first {{assignment}} in the Giants organization was in Class B with the 1948 Knoxville Smokies, {{for whom he}} registered 13 wins and 9 losses. He spent a few games that season with the Class A Jacksonville Tars of the South Atlantic League. Wilhelm returned to Jacksonville in 1949, earning a 17–12 win-loss record and a 2.66 earned run average (ERA). With the Class AAA Minneapolis Millers in 1950, Wilhelm was the starting pitcher in 25 of his 35 games pitched, registering a 15–11 record with a 4.95 ERA. His ERA came down to 3.94 in 1951 with Minneapolis, but his record finished at 11–14. Wilhelm {{had been used in}} a similar role that season, mostly starting games but <b>also</b> <b>making</b> eleven relief appearances.|$|E

5|$|Călinescu viewed such {{intellectual}} traits as {{shared by}} Creangă with his Wallachian counterpart Anton Pann, in turn linking both writers to the satirical component of Renaissance literature, and specifically to François Rabelais. Within local tradition, the literary historian saw a symbolic connection between Creangă {{and the early}} 18th century figure, Ion Neculce, one of Moldavia's leading chroniclers. While he made his own comparison between Creangă and Pann, Tudor Vianu concluded that the Moldavian writer was in fact superior, {{as well as being}} more relevant to literature than Petre Ispirescu, the prime collector of tales in 19th-century Wallachia. <b>Also</b> <b>making</b> use of the Rabelais analogy, literary chronicler Gabriela Ursachi found another analogy in local letters: Ion Budai-Deleanu, an early 19th-century representative of the Transylvanian School, whose style mixes erudite playfulness with popular tastes. These contextual traits, researchers assess, did not prevent Creangă's overall work from acquiring a universal aspect, particularly since various of his writings use narrative sequences common throughout world literature.|$|E
5|$|Eshiro {{said that}} they could have set the game in a {{courtroom}} {{similar to that of the}} main series and made a few additions, but that it would not have been very interesting; instead they moved the game to crime scenes, and added several new gameplay elements. Yamazaki was the one who came up with the idea of making a game about deductive reasoning and crime scene investigation. Because of this theme, it made sense to them to include the Ace Attorney character Ema Skye in the game, as she is portrayed as wanting to be a forensic scientist. Yamazaki originally suggested that Ema should be the main character, but based on fan feedback, they decided to use the more popular character Miles Edgeworth instead. Figuring out how to move the game from the courtroom to the crime scene was a challenge for the development team. The team also thought that it was difficult to make the game feel new while <b>also</b> <b>making</b> sure it felt similar to the game series. Because of the new gameplay systems that all had to be created from scratch, Ace Attorney Investigations took longer to develop than previous Ace Attorney games had.|$|E
5|$|Feillu was the team's {{leader for}} the Tour, leading a {{youthful}} team into the race, with three riders – De Gendt, Poels and Ruijgh – eligible for the young rider classification. Westra made the first breakaway of the Tour along with two other riders, while the team finished 20th of the 22 teams in the team time trial. It was not until stage 3 that the team finished highly; Feillu finished second behind 's Tyler Farrar, with Božič <b>also</b> <b>making</b> it into the top ten, in eighth position. Hoogerland and Westra made breakaway manoeuvres on stages 4 and 6 respectively, but again could not muster a big enough advantage for a stage victory. Hoogerland did however take {{the lead of the}} mountains classification {{at the conclusion of the}} sixth stage, where Feillu had finished fourth and Marcato ninth. Feillu took another fourth place the following day on the seventh stage into Châteauroux.|$|E
