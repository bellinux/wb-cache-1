40|$|Fault {{management}} {{is one of}} the key parts of the network operation process, especially for rural Distribution System Operators. Efficient fault {{management is}} highly dependent on the Network Control Center and the operators that are responsible for the network. One of the most important tools used in fault management is the Distribution Management System and therefore it is vital that it offers adequate features to manage the different fault situations. Developing these tools and ensuring that they are compliant with the requirements and needs of the customers requires interaction with the DSOs. The main objectives of this thesis were to gather the most recent development ideas and requirements from Finnish DSOs, regarding ABB MicroSCADA Pro DMS 600 and to provide implementation specifications for the most important ones. One of the objectives was also to describe the fault management processes and analyse the current fault management features of the system by simulating actual faults. The fault simulations were carried out in a replicated environment of a certain DMS 600 customer and they focused mainly on testing the <b>automatic</b> <b>fault</b> isolation and restoration feature and the fault location function that is closely related to it. According to the simulations, fault locations are rarely available and therefore the current <b>automatic</b> <b>fault</b> isolation and restoration feature is not feasible, although the switching sequences generated were mostly correct. Thus, no significant monetary benefits can currently be expected from the use of the feature but, according to the simulation results, a new <b>automatic</b> <b>fault</b> isolation and restoration feature with a redesigned logic could provide considerable reductions in the annual KAH-value. The main part of this thesis, the customer interviews, were carried out by interviewing three largest DMS 600 customers. A semi-structured interview method was used and a basic structure for the interviews was provided but mostly the interviews consisted of open discussion. Numerous development ideas and requirements were presented in the interviews. The most important ones were the new <b>automatic</b> <b>fault</b> isolation and restoration feature and the new fault prioritization tool. This thesis also describes the fault management processes of the interviewed DSOs. The final part of this thesis provides specifications for the new fault prioritization tool and an <b>automatic</b> <b>fault</b> <b>reporting</b> feature that were chosen for implementation analysis. Future developments, regarding e. g. the new <b>automatic</b> <b>fault</b> isolation and restoration feature and some other minor, but viable additions and changes were also introduced in the final part of this thesis...|$|R

40|$|Bearing fault {{diagnosis}} has {{a pivotal role}} in condition-based maintenance. Vibration spectra analysis has been proven to be the most efficient method for rotating machinery {{fault diagnosis}}. Vibration spectra can be analyzed by various signal processing tools (e. g. wavelet analysis, empirical mode decomposition, Hilbert-Huang transform). However, they involve human expertise in ensuring its maximum success. Machine learning tools (e. g. artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machines (SVM)) can be an alternative for an <b>automatic</b> <b>fault</b> diagnosis. Researchers have studied the feasibility of ANN for <b>automatic</b> <b>fault</b> diagnosis since last decades. Most of the researchers reported positive finding in adapting ANN for <b>automatic</b> <b>fault</b> diagnosis. However, its accuracy is highly dependent on the neural networks structure such as number of nodes, hidden layers, and sigmoid function. This study proposed a hybrid algorithm used for automated bearing fault diagnosis based on ANN and Dempster-Shafer (DS) theory. The hybrid algorithm employed DS theory to improve the fault diagnosis results from ANN by eliminating conflicting results generated by ANN. Four conditions of bearing namely healthy condition and three types of faults included ball, inner race, and outer race faults classify by the proposed hybrid algorithm and artificial neural networks. The superiority of the hybrid algorithm was shown by comparing its result with the performance of ANN alone...|$|R

INTRODUCTION (Elstein et al. 1975, Wickens 1984, Reason 1990) is that hypotheses act as central memory organisers of the problem solving process. Hypotheses transform an indefinite problem (Which failure is it?) into a definite one (Is it failure-A, B or C?).

40|$|Abstract—Locating faults in {{embedded}} software, {{especially in}} microcontrollers, is still difficult. Quite recently, it became possible to recover execution traces from microcontrollers using specific hardware probes. However, the collected traces contain a huge volume of low-level data. Consequently, manual analysis {{is difficult and}} our industrial partners call for automatic and more effective fault-localization methods for embedded software. This paper presents {{a new approach to}} automatically locate faults in embedded programs given a single faulty execution trace. Our approach exploits the cyclic nature of embedded programs and uses several adapted spectrum-based methods in order to find faults on a single execution, rather than a set of multiple failing and passing executions. Our approach is implemented in the tool CoMET and evaluated on several faulty programs. The evaluation shows that our single-trace fault-localization method using Ochiai [1] allows engineers to find a fault by inspecting less than 5 % of the program in most cases, and it confirms the interest of <b>automatic</b> <b>fault</b> localization for microcontrollers.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} study of four time-frequency {{transforms}} applied to vibration signals and presents a new metric for comparing them for fault detection. The four methods to be described and compared are the Short Time Frequency Transform (STFT), the Choi-Williams Distribution (WV-CW), the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) and the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). Vibration data of bevel gear tooth fatigue cracks, {{under a variety of}} operating load levels, are analyzed using these methods. The new metric for <b>automatic</b> <b>fault</b> detection is developed and can be produced from any systematic numerical representation of the vibration signals. This new metric reveals indications of gear damage with all of the methods on this data set. Analysis with the CWT detects mechanical problems with the test rig not found with the other transforms. The WV-CW and CWT use considerably more resources than the STFT and the DWT. More testing of the new metric is needed to determine its value for <b>automatic</b> <b>fault</b> detection and to develop methods of setting the threshold for the metric...|$|R

In this thesis, two methods are developed that extract interesting regions from infrared images of electrical installations for use in a system for <b>automatic</b> <b>fault</b> detection. The two approaches to the identification of interesting regions are based on two different ideas: finding repeated patterns and finding smooth but steep image gradients.
