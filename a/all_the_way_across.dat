Artifacts found on the Greenland coast had been identified as coming from the lost US Arctic exploration vessel Jeannette, which had been crushed and sunk in June 1881 {{on the opposite side of}} the Arctic Ocean, off the Siberian coast. Mohn surmised that the location of the artefacts indicated the existence of an ocean current, flowing from east to west <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>across</b> the polar sea, possibly over the pole itself. A strong enough ship might therefore enter the frozen Siberian sea, and drift to the Greenland coast via the pole.|$|E

When Page was blocked by collusion of the bigger railroads, who refused to grant reasonable rates to interchange the coal traffic, he did not quit. As he continued building the original project, to provide their own link, using Rogers' resources and attorneys they quietly incorporated another intrastate railroad in Virginia, the Tidewater Railway.

40|$|PEMDAS- This acronym {{stands for}} the order of {{operation}} in which math calculations must be solved (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, and then Subtraction) If not performed in this order, the answer will be wrong. • Fractions can be converted into a whole number (with or without decimals) by dividing the numerator (top #) by the denominator (bottom #). • To multiply fractions, first multiply <b>all</b> <b>the</b> numerators, then multiply <b>all</b> <b>the</b> denominators. The final step {{is to reduce the}} final fraction down the lowest number which is done by dividing the numerator by the denominator. (Keep in mind you are staying on the top of <b>the</b> line <b>all</b> of <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>across</b> and on <b>the</b> bottom of <b>the</b> line <b>all</b> of <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>across)</b> • Percentages refer to parts per 100. For example, 3 % is equal to 3 parts out of 100. It can be written as a fraction which in turn can be converted into a decimal or whole number by dividing by 100. For example: 3 % = 3 parts out of 100 = 3 = 0. 03 100 • Ratios are proportions or fractions just written in a different format. In a ratio, the first number is the numerator, and the second number is the denominator. Instead of using a line with the numerator on the top and the denominator on the bottom, the numerator and the denominator are separated by a colon (:). For example, 1 : 2 = 1 part per 2 parts = 1 2 which can then be turned into a fraction by dividing 1 by 2 = 0. 5 and then into a percentage by moving the decimal point two places to the right = 50 %. • A decimal can be converted to a fraction by dividing by 1...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} closed-form {{expression}} for the the input impedance of a microstrip probe in a rectangular waveguide. The probe extends only part <b>way</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> waveguide {{and is therefore}} compatible with RF components that require an open circuit at low frequencies. Our analysis {{is based on the}} spectral-domain method and is able {{to take into account the}} orientation of the antenna with respect to the direction of propagation. We have examined the validity of our model by carrying out extensive impedance measurements at 5 GHz. In those cases where the probe did not extend more than half <b>way</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> waveguide, excellent agreement was obtained. We show that the bandwidth of a probe that stretches only part <b>way</b> cross <b>the</b> waveguide is very much greater than the bandwidth of a probe that stretches <b>all</b> of <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> waveguide and that is earthed at both ends. Moreover, the input resistance is lower and more suited to submillimetre-wave detectors such as SIS tunnel junctions. Our expression suggests that it should be possible to develop low-impedance, wideband probes for nearly double-height waveguide, and this implies that the upper frequency limit to which probes and waveguides can be manufactured can be extended well into the THz frequency range. A related, and often neglected consideration, is that the ohmic loss associated with an oversized waveguide is very much smaller than the ohmic loss associated with a reduced-height waveguide. © 1996 Plenum Publishing Corporation...|$|R

In early December Howe came to Trenton, New Jersey to arrange the disposition of his troops for the winter.

When Washington attacked the Hessian quarters at Trenton on 26 December 1776, Howe sent Cornwallis to reform the army in New Jersey and chase after Washington.
