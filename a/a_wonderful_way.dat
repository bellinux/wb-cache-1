Later moving back to London, Brosnan was educated at Elliott School, a state {{comprehensive}} school in Putney, southwest London, now known as Ark Putney Academy. Brosnan has spoken about the transition from Ireland to England and his education in London; [...] "When you go to a very large city, a metropolis like London, as an Irish boy of 10, life suddenly moves pretty fast. From a little school of, say, seven classrooms in Ireland, to this very large comprehensive school, with over 2,000 children. And you're Irish. And they make you feel it; the British have <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>way</b> of doing that, and I had a certain deep sense of being an outsider." [...] When he attended school, his nickname was [...] "Irish".|$|E

Finn Jones, who was cast concurrently in the leading role for the upcoming television series Marvel's Iron Fist, spoke about his departure saying, [...] "I had been on Thrones for six years. It was yearly employment. Now I was at a crossroads and I had {{to think of what}} the future is. I was very blessed that something like this has come along at the right moment," [...] referring to Iron Fist. Eugene Simon also spoke about his learning of his departure, saying that the showrunners promised a [...] "huge scene" [...] for his character in the season finale, with Simon responding, [...] "for everything that you've done for the last six years, thank you.

2500|$|Former {{graduate}} student Richard Terrile remembers that Westphal [...] "not only taught me about astronomy and science, {{but also about}} more down-to-earth topics like self-reliance, dealing with people, and how to keep focused when things go bad. Jim had <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>way</b> of reducing a problem to its most basic form.

There was certainly <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> winning <b>way</b> about her-— there was a simplicity of manner almost like that of Babie herself, and yet the cleverness of a highly-educated woman. Mary Ogilvie did not wonder at what Mr. and Mrs. Acton had said of the charm of that unpretending household, now broken up.|$|R
60|$|Archie did thank him, and Doodles was {{not without}} his triumph. Of the {{frequent}} references to Warwickshire {{which he had been}} forced to endure, he said nothing, nor yet of the reference to Michaelmas dinners; and, gradually, as he came to talk frequently to Archie of the Russian spy, and perhaps also to one or two others of his more intimate friends, he began to convince himself that he really had wormed the truth out of Madam Gordeloup, and got altogether the better of that lady, in <b>a</b> very <b>wonderful</b> <b>way.</b>|$|R

"Please, sir," [...] he said, {{touching}} his sun hat, which was stuck {{on to the}} back of his head in a somewhat ludicrous fashion, [...] "as we have got all those guns and things in the whale-boat astern, to say nothing of the provisions in the lockers, I think it would be best if I got down and slept in her.

The old devil is no way stingy about food, and as we had often eat at his hearth, we thought we would just house him comfortably, afore we went to Albany with our skins.

Then he declared to himself that there was no longer any possibility of retractation for him. Of course he did not wish to retract. The one great longing of his life was to call Lily Dale his own. But he felt afraid of the squire,--that the squire would despise him and snub him, and that the earl would perceive that he had made a mistake when he saw how his client was scorned and snubbed. It was arranged that the earl was to take the squire into his own room for a few minutes before dinner, and Johnny felt that he would be hardly able to stand his ground in the drawing-room when the two old men should make their appearance together.|$|R
60|$|One great {{difficulty}} about the borough vanished in <b>a</b> very <b>wonderful</b> <b>way</b> {{at the first}} touch. Dr. Finn, who was a man stout at heart, and by no means afraid of his great friends, drove himself over to Castlemorris to tell his news to the Earl, {{as soon as he}} got a second letter from his son declaring his intention of proceeding with the business, let the results be what they might. Lord Tulla was a passionate old man, and the doctor expected that there would be a quarrel;--but he was prepared to face that. He was under no special debt of gratitude to the lord, having given as much as he had taken in the long intercourse which had existed between them;--and he agreed with his son in thinking that if there was to be a Liberal candidate at Loughshane, no consideration of old pill-boxes and gallipots should deter his son Phineas from standing. Other considerations might very probably deter him, but not that. The Earl probably would be of a different opinion, and the doctor felt it to be incumbent on him to break the news to Lord Tulla.|$|R

5000|$|Throughout his naval career, Grigory Butakov {{extensively}} enjoyed boat racing, {{and adopted}} the sport as his chief pastime while {{on leave from}} the navy. Butakov enjoyed races involving both steamboats and sailboats. He believed that boat racing {{was not only a}} good pastime for sailors, it was also good for their training and military skill. He said: [...] "I believe racing is by far one of the best and most appropriate means available for our young sailors to try their wings, start strengthening their will, nerves and stamina, train their faultless eye and prepare themselves to face any unforeseen circumstances which are so frequent throughout our service…Besides, the boat race is <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> and effective <b>way</b> to find out what metal each of us is made of".|$|R

They enable this land of England to support four times as many human beings as it did two hundred years ago; they make many of the necessaries of life cheaper, so that in many cases a poor man may now have comforts which his grandfather never heard of.|$|R
60|$|Let me {{give you}} another instance. You all have seen {{lightning}} conductors, which prevent tall chimneys and steeples from being struck by storms, so that the lightning runs harmless downward. Now we can all see how this is conquering the force of lightning in <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> and beautiful <b>way.</b> But before you can conquer the lightning by a conductor, you must obey the lightning and its laws most carefully. If you make the conductor out of your own head and fancy, it will be of no use. You must observe and follow humbly the laws which God has given to the lightning. You must make the conductor of metal wire, or it will be useless. You must make it run through glazed rings, or it will be only more dangerous than no conductor at all; for God who made the lightning chose {{that it should be}} so, and you must obey if you wish to conquer.|$|R

The climate {{was superior to}} that of California, and, with abundant water, trees and plants and gardens flourished and bloomed in <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>wonderful</b> to behold. It was with ever-increasing pleasure that Madeline walked through acres of ground once bare, now green and bright and fragrant. There were poultry-yards and pig-pens and marshy quarters for ducks and geese. Here in the farming section of the ranch Madeline found employment for the little colony of Mexicans. Their lives had been as hard and barren as the dry valley where they had lived. But as the valley had been transformed by the soft, rich touch of water, so their lives had been transformed by help and sympathy and work. The children were wretched no more, and many that had been blind could now see, and Madeline had become to them a new and blessed virgin.|$|R
