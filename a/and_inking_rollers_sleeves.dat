50|$|The ink {{fountain}} stores {{a quantity of}} ink in a reservoir and feeds small quantities of ink to the distribution <b>rollers</b> from the <b>ink</b> fountain <b>roller</b> <b>and</b> the <b>ink</b> ductor <b>roller.</b> The <b>ink</b> ductor <b>roller</b> is a movable roller that moves {{back and forth between}} the <b>ink</b> fountain <b>roller</b> <b>and</b> an <b>ink</b> distribution <b>roller.</b> As the ductor contacts the <b>ink</b> fountain <b>roller,</b> both turn and the ductor is inked. The ductor then swings forward to contact an <b>ink</b> distribution <b>roller</b> <b>and</b> transfers <b>ink</b> to it.

40|$|The {{extensive}} use of multiple organic solvents in offset lithographic printing causing high emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) indeed poses a serious risk to printing workers' health. In this study, indoor air quality (IAQ) assessments were carried out in seven printing plants and the main objectives were to understand the effect of VOC emissions on IAQ and develop effective mitigation measures to protect workers. The thorough gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) measurements showed that although a variety of VOCs were presented in the indoor air, {{none of them was}} found close to individual 8 -h time-weighted average (TWA) of the occupational exposure limit (OEL). The additive effect was also found below the critical value of unity. However, short-term personal exposure to total volatile organic compounds (TVOCs) was exceedingly high when a print worker carried out blanket <b>and</b> <b>ink</b> <b>roller</b> cleaning procedures. Therefore, the occupational health risk was mainly due to repeated short-term exposures during intermittent VOC-emitting procedures rather than long-term exposure to background VOCs. Push-pull local exhaust ventilation (LEV) was identified as an effective mitigation measure. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis was conducted to study the push-pull LEV operation. It was found that there existed a threshold LEV air flow rate for an abrupt reduction in the worker's exposure to VOCs. The reduction was less sensitive when the LEV airflow was further increased beyond the threshold. These phenomena, consistent with experimental results reported by other investigators, were explained by detailed CFD analysis showing the competition between the general ventilation and the push-pull LEV to become the dominating driving force for the resultant local flow pattern. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
50|$|The ink {{fountain}} holds {{a pool of}} <b>ink</b> <b>and</b> controls the amount of ink that enters the inking system. The {{most common type of}} fountain consists of a metal blade that is held in place near the fountain roller. The gap between the blade <b>and</b> the <b>ink</b> fountain <b>roller</b> can be controlled by adjusting screw keys to vary the amount of ink on the fountain roller. The printer adjusts the keys in or out as the <b>ink</b> fountain <b>roller</b> turns to obtain the desired quantity of ink. In simple presses, the printer must turn these screws by hand. In modern presses, the adjusting screws are moved by servomotors which are controlled by the printer at a press console. Thus the printer can make ink adjustments electronically. If the printer needs to increase or decrease ink in an area of the plate (print), he need only adjust the needed keys to allow more or less ink flow through the blade. The ink flow can also be controlled by the rotation velocity of the <b>ink</b> fountain <b>roller.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The hard roller {{and soft}} roller are {{alternately}} arranged in the inking system of offset press. The ink vibrator {{is a hard}} roller which transmits the motion to the <b>ink</b> distributing <b>roller.</b> In order to analyze the motion mechanism of the <b>ink</b> <b>roller,</b> a model of an <b>ink</b> distributing <b>roller</b> <b>and</b> an <b>ink</b> vibrator is built up by using the software ANSYS. After the simulation of the motion, the force on the contact area of the <b>ink</b> distributing <b>roller</b> <b>and</b> the rotation speed of both rollers are analyzed. The {{result is that the}} <b>ink</b> distributing <b>roller</b> rotates with tangential force on the contact area and this force increases together with the rotation speed. When the two rollers rotate, the tangential elastic deformation is caused by the tangential force on contact area, and the radial deformation of the <b>ink</b> distributing <b>roller</b> is caused by the pressure. It leads to a relative sliding of the two rollers, which is mainly influenced by the rotation speed of <b>ink</b> vibrator <b>and</b> the radial deformation of <b>ink</b> distributing <b>roller.</b> Meanwhile, to verify the accuracy of the analysis, the rotation speed of the two rollers and the deformation of the <b>ink</b> distributing <b>roller</b> have been measured on a printability tester and then compared with the results of simulation. The analysis of the motion mechanism is very important to the study of printing color quality control...|$|R

5000|$|A second {{method of}} {{creating}} imagery on the vitreograph plate is waterless lithography (sometimes called “siligraphy”). The process was originally developed by 3M Company for commercial printing {{in the late}} 1960s; it was purchased and subsequently refined by Toray Industries of Japan. The commercial process {{is a type of}} offset printing that uses photo-sensitized silicone rubber plates. The waterless lithography process employed in fine art printmaking has been credited to Nik Semenoff, who developed it for use on metal plates.Donald Furst demonstrated his adaptation of the silicone method to glass plate printmaking in June, 1995, and the Littleton Studios adopted his process for their work with glass plate lithography. The image is drawn onto a ground glass matrix with water-soluble art materials, over which is applied a film of common caulking silicone thinned with synthetic turpentine. Master printer Mark Mahaffey has found that frosted Mylar {{can be used as a}} printing matrix as well as 3/8” float glass to create a vitreograph using waterless lithography. [...] After the silicone layer cures, the original drawing is gently washed from the plate with water, dried, <b>and</b> <b>inked</b> with a <b>roller.</b> The silicone layer protects the non-printing areas of the image while allowing open areas (those free of silicone) to accept ink. Like intaglio vitreographs, waterless lithographs on glass plates are transferred to paper in an etching press.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2008. Rolling {{contact is}} {{experienced}} {{by a large}} number of components in mechanical designs. Examples include <b>roller</b> bearings <b>and</b> <b>ink</b> distribution <b>rollers</b> in the printing industry. Rolling contact results in surface wear. It is however possible to reduce rolling contact wear rates and surface fatigue by performing a surface modification such as powdered metal coating [35]. Powder coating methods such as Laser cladding and Plasma coating are two application processes that are completely different in method and therefore create different coating microstructures and bonding mechanisms between the coating and substrate. The aim of the research was to investigate the comparative rolling contact performance of two coating processes and two separate metal powder compositions. The coatings were applied to British standard En 9 steel test specimens. En 9 was selected due to its popular use in the manufacture of shafts, cylinders and rollers. Under rolling contact, material is removed from the surface as a result of wear and surface fatigue. Through testing and evaluation, the performance of the coating application processes were evaluated relative to one another and relative to the uncoated steel under rolling contact. The performance of the coating compositions were also evaluated against one another for a given coating application process. Results used to determine the performance of the coatings and coating processes were, the number of cycles to failure and the wear rates of the coated surface. Microstructure pictures of the coated surface were taken prior to testing and following testing. The pictures were used to qualitatively determine the effects of the rolling contact on the surfaces. Through the study of rolling contact, an explanation of the stresses induced in the contact area and the position of the maximum values were determined. The boundaries for the deformation regimes were identified through the understanding of the position of first yield and the shakedown limit under rolling contact. The theories of rolling contact fatigue are covered briefly as part of {{a better understanding of the}} failure mechanism however the experimentation is largely comparative based...|$|R
