For nearly three hours the other carriages remained suspended. Sanjay Chander, Superintendent of Police, Darjeeling, said the accident took place due to negligence. Although Army help was sought for bringing down the cars, ropeway authorities were able to do it themselves. The West Bengal Government ordered an inquiry into the accident.|$|E

In <b>AM</b> (<b>S),</b> we construct functions which are flat at the vertex of S with a sharp rate of vanishing. This allows us to obtain a Borel-Ritt type theorem for <b>AM</b> (<b>S)</b> extending previous results by Schmets and Valdivia.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Additive Manufacturing (AM) refers {{to the use of}} a group of technologies capable of combining material layer-by-layer to manufacture geometrically complex products in a single digitally controlled process step, entirely without moulds, dies or other tooling. AM is a parallel manufacturing approach, allowing the contemporaneous production of multiple, potentially unrelated, components or products. This thesis contributes {{to the understanding of the}} economic aspects of additive technology usage through an analysis of the effect of <b>AM</b> <b>s</b> parallel nature on economic and environmental performance measurement. Further, this work assesses <b>AM</b> <b>s</b> ability to efficiently create complex components or products. To do so, this thesis applies a methodology for the quantitative analysis of the shape complexity of AM output. Moreover, this thesis develops and applies a methodology for the combined estimation of build time, process energy flows and financial costs. A key challenge met by this estimation technique is that results are derived on the basis of technically efficient AM operation. Results indicate that, at least for the technology variant Electron Beam Melting, shape complexity may be realised at zero marginal energy consumption and cost. Further, the combined estimator of build time, energy consumption and cost suggests that AM process efficiency is independent of production volume. Rather, this thesis argues that the key to efficient AM operation lies in the user s ability to exhaust the available build space...|$|E

The problem is explored in terms of Weighted Round Robin (WRR) service discipline in input queued packet switches. Application of the problem may arise in packet switching networks and Satellite-Switched Time Division Multiple Access (SS/TDMA) systems. A new formulation {{of the problem is}} presented. The main contribution of the thesis is a ’’backward extraction” technique to schedule packet forwarding through the switch fabric. A number of heuristic algorithms, each based on backward extraction, are proposed, and their performances are studied via simulation. Numerical results show that the algorithms perform significantly better than earlier proposed algorithms. The experimental results strongly assert Philp and Liu conjecture.

40|$|We {{investigated}} sample dilution as {{a technique}} for accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon analysis of very small samples (down to 30 mu g). By diluting such samples up {{to a total}} weight of 200 mu g, we can still perform reliable <b>AM</b> <b>S</b> measurements and improve the success rate significantly for targets {{that are difficult to}} measure. A disadvantage of this dilution technique is a loss of measurement precision. In addition, calculations of the C- 14 /C- 12 isotope ratios and the uncertainties therein are not straight forward because of peculiarities in isotope fractionation processes in the AMS system. Therefore, to make sample dilution a routine method in our laboratory, we did extensive theoretical and experimental research to find the optimum conditions for all relevant parameters. Here, we report on the first detailed study dealing with all aspects of sample dilution. Our results can be applied in general. As an illustrative test case, we analyze C- 14 data for CO 2 extracted from an ice core, from which samples of 35 mu g C or less are available...|$|E
40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. Though with {{different}} strategies and responses, yet all continue {{to share the}} same difficult task of development in this given conditions of globalizing world. My thesis compares and contrasts the reform history of China and Turkey under the overarching system of globalization {{as an attempt to}} find out better ways to achieve development. Although their socio-economic and political systems differ, China and Turkey have entered the world of globalization by launching the reform policies almost at the same time period and both faced the same elements of risks and opportunities generated by this system. My thesis utilizes the methodology of compare and contrast to examine China’s dualistic strategy of state regulation within an open economy and Turkey’s primary economic strategies based on the private enterprises to deduce that too much liberalization, especially in the field of financial market, could cause a slow-down to, if not harm, the economy. The thesis concludes with the speculation on how such success of Chinese economy could come to a halt if further liberalization especially in the form of capital account liberalization continues in the future.

This system has been implemented on top of an existing database system that manipulates relations with set-valued attributes. The temporal relational model together with the tem]) oral algebra are descril) ed. The basic set of opercitions of the extended relational algebra have been modified to handle temporal attributes. New operations have been added to help in the extraction of information from historical relations. These operations convcirt one attrilnite type to another and do selection over the time'dimension. Moreover, a statistical interface has been added to the system. This interface includes aggregate functions and a new operation, enumeration^ which derives a table of uniform data for a set of time points or intervals, from a three dimensional historical relation. A performance evaluation of the system is carried out by executing sample queries against different types of databases: snapshot, snapshot/nested and historical.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare and {{evaluate}} three online pretest item calibration/scaling methods in terms of item parameter recovery when the item responses to the pretest items in the pool would be sparse. The three methods considered were the marginal maximum likelihood estimate with one EM cycle (OEM) method, the marginal maximum likelihood estimate with multiple EM cycles (MEM) method, and Stocking's Method B. The three methods were evaluated using simulations of data from computerized adaptive tests (CAT). The MEM method produced the smallest average total error in recovering the 240 pretest item characteristic curves. Stocking's Method B yielded the second smallest average total error in parameter estimation. In terms of scale maintenance, the MEM method and Stocking's Method B performed well in keeping with the scale of the pretest items on the same scale as that of the true parameters. With the OEM method, the scale of the pretest item parameter estimates deviated from that of the true parameters. (Contains 1 figure, 4 tables, and 14 references.)
