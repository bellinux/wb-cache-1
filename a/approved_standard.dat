60|$|There is one {{characteristic}} of the present direction of public opinion, peculiarly calculated to make it intolerant of any marked demonstration of individuality. The general average of mankind are not only moderate in intellect, but also moderate in inclinations: they have no tastes or wishes strong enough to incline them to do anything unusual, and they consequently do not understand those who have, and class all such with the wild and intemperate whom they are accustomed to look down upon. Now, {{in addition to this}} fact which is general, we have only to suppose that a strong movement has set in towards the improvement of morals, and it is evident what we have to expect. In these days such a movement has set in; much has actually been effected in the way of increased regularity of conduct, and discouragement of excesses; and there is a philanthropic spirit abroad, for the exercise of which there is no more inviting field than the moral and prudential improvement of our fellow-creatures. These tendencies of the times cause the public to be more disposed than at most former periods to prescribe general rules of conduct, and endeavour to make every one conform to the <b>approved</b> <b>standard.</b> And that standard, express or tacit, is to desire nothing strongly. Its ideal of character is to be without any marked character; to maim by compression, like a Chinese lady's foot, every part of human nature which stands out prominently, and tends to make the person markedly dissimilar in outline to commonplace humanity.|$|E

The resulting recommendation was that ISO/IEC JTC1/SC34 should assume full control of the maintenance work on ISO/IEC 29500. This decision was duly ratified at SC 34's September 2008 meeting on Jeju Island, Korea. Ecma were invited as a liaison to provide individual experts to contribute to the maintenance activity. This decision superseded an earlier proposal from Ecma, in which Ecma itself proposed it was responsible for maintenance.|$|E

50|$|This system, {{known as}} V-CPM for Variable Angle Compatible Phase Multiplex, was {{developed}} by Harris Corporation, a major manufacturer of radio/TV transmitters. It incorporated a left minus right component which was frequency modulated by about 1 kHz. Harris is the successor to the pioneer Gates radio line, which has changed its name in 2014 to Gates-Air. The Harris system eventually changed their pilot tone to be compatible with C-QUAM, after C-QUAM became the more popular and eventually, the FCC <b>approved</b> <b>standard.</b> CKLW in Windsor, Ontario, Canada (also serving nearby Detroit, Michigan) {{was among the first}} stations to broadcast in Harris AM stereo.

5000|$|The Interlocking contour of knuckle {{couplers}} was {{the first}} aspect to be standardized. In the MCB years, prior to about 1910, and {{as early as the}} first Janney in 1873, there were many proprietary [...] "head" [...] designs, and many MCB standard contours, which were constantly evolving and changing (as the <b>approved</b> <b>standard</b> contour for new couplers) every few years. In about 1910 the producers were all using the then standardized MCB-10 contour, soon to become the AAR-10. In the 1930s the AAR Type [...] "D" [...] was improved and became the Type [...] "E"; the contour, however, stayed the same. A few years later the 10 contour was modified into a then optional standard called the 10A contour.|$|E
50|$|FNL is jointly (50/50) {{owned and}} {{operated}} by the two cities of Loveland and Fort Collins. This means that it is publicly owned by the cities and follows a municipal structure. The Northern Colorado Regional Airport Commission provides direction for airport staff and is made up of two mayors and two city managers (one from each city) and three at large citizen members. There is no airport authority, which means funding and decisions are made on behalf of the two cities. However, to ensure proper balance in the decision-making process, the Commission is required to communicate with both city councils and involve them in financial and development activities that occur outside of the councils' <b>approved</b> <b>standard</b> form. This was changed under the amended and restated Intergovermental Agreement dated June 7, 2016. The airport manager at FNL is Jason Licon, who previously served 10 years as airport manager for the Kankakee Valley Airport Authority in Kankakee, Illinois.|$|E
