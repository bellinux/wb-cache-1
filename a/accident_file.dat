3000|$|In {{the current}} study, for each {{treatment}} type, {{the estimation of}} safety effects was conducted using three accident types: (a) injury accidents, (b) severe (i.e. serious+ fatal) accidents and (c) total accidents which are the sum of injury accidents and [...] "general with casualties" [...] accidents. It should be noted here that in Israel two types of accident files are collected {{by the police and}} produced by the Central Bureau of statistics (CBS): (a) injury <b>accident</b> <b>file,</b> with cases investigated by the police examiners, and (b) [...] "general with casualties" [...] <b>accident</b> <b>file,</b> with cases reported to the police but not investigated. The first file includes all injury severity levels: fatal, serious and slight, where slight injury accidents satisfy certain selection criteria concerning the time passed since the occurrence and accident participants. The second file includes cases with slight injuries only (not hospitalized), which did not satisfy the selection criteria of the [...] "injury" [...] file. The first file serves as a basis for the official accident and injury figures in the country. However, as the amount of records in the second file versus the first file presents a 78  % to 22  % relation [3], it is a common demand today to conduct accident analyses involving both files.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{provides}} some results demonstrating {{the impact of}} rain on road safety for France. The risk of injury accident and the added risk in case of rain are estimated for several types of injury accidents which occurred in France for the period 1995 - 2008. Estimations cover the whole of France, in average and according the category of network and element of the road. These results are relevant as they will contribute to implement specific road safety measures. The risk of injury accident in case of rain {{is defined as the}} number of injury accidents per vehicle-kilometre by rainy conditions. The added risk in case of rain is defined as the ratio of the risk of injury accident by rainy conditions divided by the risk of injury accident by no rain. As the number of vehicle kilometres is partly unknown, the rain duration is used in this paper in the place of the number of vehicle-kilometres by rainy conditions. An approximation of the added risk is thus derived. For computing these estimations, two data sources related to injury accidents and rain duration were used: the BAAC (the French Injury <b>Accident</b> <b>File)</b> and Météo-France. In addition, the changes in the added risk in case of rain over the period 1995 - 2008 are described with the help of time series analysis techniques. The results are commented in relation with more detailed results obtained for the Haute-Normandie region in France, and recommendations for improving the computation method are given...|$|E
40|$|International audienceBackground The road crash peak among {{children}} is around 11 – 12 years-old in France, {{as in many}} industrialised countries, {{at the time of}} entry in secondary school. The reasons why this vulnerability increases while the skills involved should have improved are not clear. By linking two fields of analysis of road safety (fine spatial analysis of crashes and depth analysis of behaviours and psychosocial factors), our project aimed to finely identify the mobility and pedestrian accident involvement of the 10 – 15 years old and specify geographical, psychological and sociological determinants of both variables. Methods and results A study of accident processes among pedestrians aged 10 – 15 years over France for the period 2002 – 2011 was conducted, based on the national <b>accident</b> <b>file</b> and on a sample of accident police reports. It was completed in the field of study of the Lille region (France) by the spatial analysis of local accident data (including the identification of accident scenarios) and the mobility of 10 – 15 years, using data from the 2006 household travel survey. Two field surveys were then conducted. A first survey among 2500 junior high school students has identified the fine mobility practices and their socio-spatial determinants. It also explored the demographic and psychological variables (age, gender roles, perceptions of social norms, risks, rules, level of supervision) explaining the reported pedestrian risky behaviours. A second survey among 300 junior high school students focused on their perceptions of known and unknown walking environments. It enabled to draw up a sensible mapping of their actual walking environment and a qualitative analysis of the elements using to judge the pleasantness and safety and characterise their representations of positive or negative actual and virtual travels as pedestrian. Conclusions The results allow {{a better understanding of the}} phenomena and processes involved in the accident of pedestrian adolescents and to identify measures needed to overcome this problem...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{recent years}} {{a change of}} {{paradigm}} in road operations development has emerged. Increasing congestion on the urban motorway networks has led stakeholders to test innovative practices of road infrastructure use, since strict budgetary constraints and the environmental requirements for sustainable mobility have raised the need not only to limit the building of new infrastructures but also to look for solutions to optimize the existing network. Therefore, on French motorways for instance, new road management schemes are being tested, such as allowing traffic on the hard shoulder during peak periods. Furthermore, recent directives in France on road safety, sustainable development and {{the preservation of the}} natural environment have driven local authorities to reduce speed limits on urban highways. Whatever the reasons for change, an exhaustive assessment of new schemes is essential, in order to know what the impact is in terms of traffic and road safety. This paper aims to give methods and results in ex-ante and ex-post safety assessment studies by combining data from various sources (traffic databases, police reports, <b>accident</b> <b>files,</b> weather stations and maps) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this accident review is to check what proportion of accidents recorded in the past could in principle have been prevented by using an incident warning system (IWS). The accident review was carried out for all three IWS test sites {{that are part of}} the HOPES evaluation study. These include: (1) the EUROTRIANGLE system; (2) the PORTICO system; and (3) the MELYSSA system. An additional aim of the before study is to detect particular safety problems at the IWS test sites. It is assumed that the IWS prevents only those accident types that are related to the warning messages given. Traffic safety is expressed in both the total number of accidents, and in relation to risk exposure.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to identify the issues that contribute most to commercial motor vehicle crashes, fatalities, and injuries in Michigan through analysis of available data, and to identify strategies to help reduce these crashes and their consequences. Data from 2001 - 2005 were used, and included the Michigan vehicle crash files, Trucks Involved in Fatal <b>Accidents</b> <b>file,</b> and Motor Carrier Management Information System Inspection and Carrier files. The Michigan FACT file was also used. Harm was measured by overall CMV crash costs. Angle, rear-end, and head-on crashes were found to contribute most to overall CMV crash costs. Analysis of vehicle condition and crash risk found brake defects to be associated with fatal CMV rear-end, head-on, and angle collisions, and lighting defects to be associated with fatal rear-end crashes where the CMV was struck. Analysis of CMV inspection records shows that brake and lighting system violations are the most frequent violations. The average number of violations is highest for small fleets. The inability to stop in assured distance, (i. e., following too closely) is the CMV driver hazardous action that contributes most to overall CMV costs. Strategies proposed to address these issues include enforcement, preventive maintenance programs, training, consultation, and other help to fleet safety managers, incentives for deployment of advanced in-vehicle technology, and public information and education programs to “share the road. ...|$|R
