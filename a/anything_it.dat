5|$|The episode {{features}} the first {{appearance of the}} bowling alley Barney's Bowlarama. The original backstory for Barney's Bowlarama {{was that it was}} owned by Barney Gumble. Over time it changed to Barney just being an employee, as the writers could not imagine Barney owning <b>anything.</b> <b>It</b> was later revealed that Barney's uncle was the owner. The exterior of the Bowlarama was designed by No Doubt member Eric Stefani. The episode also marks the first appearances of Lenny Leonard and Helen Lovejoy.|$|E
5|$|The {{setting and}} events of Strange Journey are {{unrelated}} {{to any other}} entry in the Shin Megami Tensei series. The game {{is set in the}} early 21st century on the continent of Antarctica. During the game's opening, a massive atomic collapse occurs at the South Pole, causing the creation of the , a black void which swallows <b>anything</b> <b>it</b> touches and threatens to engulf the Earth. The space within the Schwarzwelt is occupied by spaces representing the many vices of humanity, acting as a critique of them. The main bases are special amphibious vehicles: Red Sprite No. 1, the protagonist's vehicle, Blue Jet No. 2, Elves No. 3, and Gigantic No. 4.|$|E

25|$|The Rolling Stones {{were aware}} of the skirmish, but not the {{stabbing}} ("You couldn't see <b>anything,</b> <b>it</b> was just another scuffle", Jagger tells David Maysles during film editing), and felt that had they abandoned the show, the crowd may have become even more unruly, leading to riots or other forms of violence.|$|E

Any Web page can seize control of your computer; then it can do <b>anything</b> <b>it</b> likes. That's about as serious as a security flaw can get.|$|E
25|$|Also in July, Collins {{set aside}} his title as Chairman of the Provisional Government to become Commander-in-Chief of the National Army. There is {{controversy}} about this change, especially {{in view of}} subsequent events: what, if <b>anything,</b> <b>it</b> said {{about his relationship with}} the Cabinet; what role, if any, others in the government may have played in it; what connection it had, if any, with the tragedy which followed.|$|E

25|$|In 1982, Pittsburgh National Corporation and Provident National Corporation {{merged into}} a new entity named PNC Financial Corporation, so the acronym {{technically}} doesn't stand for <b>anything.</b> <b>It</b> was the largest bank merger in American history {{at the time and}} created a company with $10.3 billion in assets. Between 1991 and 1996, PNC purchased more than ten smaller banks and financial institutions that broadened its market base from Kentucky to the Greater New York metropolitan area.|$|E
25|$|Finally, Dawkins {{searches}} {{for an explanation}} of morality based upon evolutionary biology, which he considers more hopeful than ancient texts. Together with the evolutionary psychologist , he discusses the primordial morality to be found among chimpanzees. Curry explains his view that we don't need religion to explain morality and if <b>anything</b> <b>it</b> simply gets in the way. Instead, he claims, a more convincing explanation {{is to be found}} in the concepts of reciprocal altruism and kin selection.|$|E
25|$|There is {{no actual}} {{evidence}} that piano legs were considered scandalous. Pianos and tables were often draped with shawls or cloths—but if the shawls hid <b>anything,</b> <b>it</b> was the cheapness of the furniture. There are references to lower-middle-class families covering up their pine tables rather than {{show that they}} couldn't afford mahogany. The piano leg story seems to have originated in the 1839 book, A Diary in America written by Captain Frederick Marryat, as a satirical comment on American prissiness.|$|E

25|$|There are variances {{about the}} Momotarō's process of growth; {{one is that}} he grew up to meet the {{expectation}} of the old couple to be a fine boy. Another is that he {{grew up to be}} a strong but lazy person who just sleeps all day and does not do <b>anything.</b> <b>It</b> is possible that the Momotarō being a fine boy version is more famous to give lessons to children. Nowadays, Momotarō {{is one of the most}} famous characters in Japan, as an ideal model for young kids for his kind-heartedness, bravery, power, and care for his parents.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{guns were}} of large calibers, and were initially of wrought iron, which made them weak compared to cast bronze guns {{that would become}} standard in the 16th century. They were at first fixed directly on timbers in the bow, aiming directly forwards. This placement would remain largely unchanged until the galley disappeared from active service in the 19th century. The introduction of heavy guns and small arms did not change tactics considerably. If <b>anything,</b> <b>it</b> accentuated the bow as the offensive weapon, being both a staging area for boarders and the given position for small arms and cannons. The galley was capable of outperforming sailing vessel in early battles. It retained a distinct tactical advantage even after the initial introduction of naval artillery because of {{the ease with which}} it could be brought to bear upon an opposing vessel.|$|E
25|$|After the 22nd session, in April 1903, the Meetings of {{the group}} (by this time known as Bogoiskateli, or God-seekers) were {{cancelled}} by the procurator of the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church Konstantin Pobedonostsev's decree, the main reason being Merezhkovsky's frequent visits to places of mass sectarian settlements where God-seekers' radical ideas of Church 'renovation' were becoming popular. In Novy Put things changed too: {{with the arrival of}} strong personalities like Nikolai Berdyayev, Sergey Bulgakov and Semyon Frank the magazine solidified its position, yet drifted away from its originally declared mission. In the late 1904 Merezhkovsky and Gippius quit Novy Put, remaining on friendly terms with its new leaders and their now highly influential 'philosophy section'. In 1907 the Meetings revived under the new moniker of The Religious-Philosophical Society, Merezhkovsky once again promoting his 'Holy Ghost's Kingdom Come' ideas. This time it looked more like a literary circle than <b>anything</b> <b>it</b> had ever purported to be.|$|E

25|$|In , a {{different}} {{version of the}} Batmobile retains its classic-shape and designs; but is heavily influenced by The Dark Knight Trilogy Tumbler. The car is heavier than a tank, its ability to absorb impact makes it nearly indestructible, and affected <b>anything</b> <b>it</b> collided with in similar fashion. It can be called to Batman instantly with the press of a button and can eject Batman hundreds of {{feet in the air}} to instantly begin gliding. Batman can also control the Batmobile remotely using his Batmobile Remote gadget and it can even support Batman while he is fighting free flow combat via a Batmobile assisted Special Takedown. Like the Batsuit and gadgets, the Batmobile can be upgraded and even has its own alternate skins (such as one based on the Batmobile from 1960 TV series). The game also features Batmobiles from the 1960 TV Series and the films appear as DLC and are used in special Racing AR Challenges.|$|E
25|$|It is such {{a curious}} position, hollow and rotten to the heart’s core, to have made all over the State large uncomfortable {{communities}} of people whom you call refugees and say you are protecting, but who call themselves prisoners of war, compulsorily detained, and detesting your protection. They are tired of being told by officers that they are refugees under “the kind and beneficient protection of the British”. In most cases there is no pretence that there was treachery, or ammunition concealed, or food given or <b>anything.</b> <b>It</b> was just that an order was given to empty the country. Though the camps are called refugee, there are in reality a very few of these–perhaps only half-a-dozen in some camps. It is easy to tell them, because they are put in the best marquees, and have had time given to them to bring furniture and clothes, and are mostly self-satisfied and vastly superior people. Very few, if any of them, are in want.|$|E
25|$|Prey {{is often}} flushed out of tall grass by the birds stomping on the {{surrounding}} vegetation. It also waits near fires, eating <b>anything</b> <b>it</b> can {{that is trying}} to escape. They can either catch prey by chasing it and striking with the bill and swallowing (usually with small prey), or stamping on prey until it is rendered stunned or unconscious enough to swallow. Larger or dangerous prey, such as venomous snakes, are instead stunned or killed by the bird jumping onto their backs, at which point they will try to snap their necks or backs. There are some reports that, when capturing snakes, the secretary birds will take flight with their prey and then drop them to their death, although this has not been verified. Even with larger prey, food is generally swallowed whole through the birds' considerable gape. Occasionally, like other raptors, they will tear apart prey with their feet before consuming it.|$|E

25|$|The {{high rate}} of {{mortality}} among the clergy naturally led to a shortage of priests {{in many parts of}} the country. The clergy were seen to have an elevated status among ordinary people and this was partly due to their closeness with God, being his envoys on earth. However, as the church itself had given the cause of the Black Death to be the impropriety of the behaviour of men, the higher death rate among the clergy led the people to lose faith in the Church as an institution − it had proved as ineffectual against the horror of Y. Pestis as every other medieval institution. The corruption within the Catholic priesthood also angered the English people. Many priests abandoned the terrified people. Others sought benefits from the rich families who needed burials. The dissatisfaction led to anti-clericalism and the rise of John Wycliffe, an English priest. His ideas paved a path for the Christian reformation in England. Some people didn't lose their Christian faith, if <b>anything</b> <b>it</b> was renewed; they began to long for a more personal relationship with God − around the time after the Black Death many chantries (private chapels) began to spread in use from not just the nobility, but to among the well to do. This change in the power of the papacy in England is demonstrated by the statutes of Praemunire.|$|E
