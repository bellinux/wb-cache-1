5|$|On Friday, 6 July, President General Musharraf {{left for}} the flood-affected areas of Balochistan. As the president's {{aircraft}} took off from the Islamabad airport, militants fired anti-aircraft weapons <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> {{the roof of a}} house in the Asghar Mall area of Rawalpindi. The militants' relationship with Lal Masjid remains unknown. Security forces recovered two anti-aircraft guns and a machine gun on the rooftop of a Rawalpindi high-rise, one mile (1.6km) from the airport. The government asserted that shots were heard minutes after the president's aircraft took off. Analysts suggest that it may have been retaliation for ongoing operations against Lal Masjid and the government's continued efforts to combat terrorism and Talibanization in northern Waziristan.|$|E
5|$|No. There’s {{always going}} to be two sides to {{everything}}. For me, everything that I did with the Harajuku Girls was just a pure compliment and being a fan. You can’t be a fan of somebody else? Or another culture? Of course you can. Of course you can celebrate other cultures. That’s what Japanese culture and American culture have done. It’s like I say in the song: it’s a ping-pong match. We do something American, they take it and they flip it and make it so Japanese and so cool. And we take it back and go, “Whoa, that’s so cool!” That’s so beautiful. It’s a beautiful thing in the world, how our cultures come together. I don’t feel like I did anything but share that love. You can look <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> a negative point of view if you want to, but get off my cloud. Because, seriously, that was all meant out of love.|$|E

25|$|The gospels {{can be seen}} {{as having}} three {{separate}} lines: A literary line which looks <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> a textual perspective, secondly a historical line which observes how Christianity started as a renewal movement within Judaism and eventually separated from it, and finally a theological line which analyzes Christian teachings. Within the historical perspective, the gospels are not simply used to establish the existence of Jesus as sources in their own right alone, but their content is compared and contrasted to non-Christian sources, and the historical context, to draw conclusions about the historicity of Jesus.|$|E

25|$|American house spiders usually feed {{on small}} insects and {{household}} pests such as flies, mosquitoes, ants and wasps. They can randomly attack grasshoppers, butterflies, cockroaches or other spiders {{depending on their}} size. If the prey is too agile, the spider will try shooting web <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> a distance before pulling the thread toward itself. Bigger females can also attract baby skinks inside their web by leaving fly remains hanging in it. Once its food dries out, the spider usually drops {{it to the floor}} in order to free space in its web, instead of destroying and rebuilding it or changing its location.|$|E

25|$|Because of bad {{information}} {{and lack of}} reconnaissance, two of the Union divisions in the infantry attack did not hit the Confederate left flank, but their movement by chance helped them to roll up the Confederate line by coming <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> the end and rear. The first division in the attack under Brigadier General Romeyn B. Ayres alone overran the short right angled line {{on the left side}} of the Confederate main line. Sheridan's personal leadership helped encourage the men and focus them on their objective. Brigadier General Charles Griffin's division recovered from overshooting the Confederate left and helped roll up additional improvised Confederate defense lines. Brigadier General (Brevet Major General) Samuel W. Crawford's division swept across north of the main battle but then closed off Ford's Church Road, swept down to Five Forks and helped disperse the last line of Confederate infantry resistance. The Union cavalry was somewhat less successful. Although they pushed the Confederate cavalry back, most escaped while most of the Confederate infantry became casualties or prisoners.|$|E

25|$|The {{reason for}} the sad state of public transit is a very basic one - the transit systems just do not offer a service which will attract people away from their automobiles. Consequently, their {{patronage}} comes very largely from those who cannot drive, either because they are too young, too old, or because they are too poor to own and operate an automobile. Look <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> the standpoint of a commuter {{who lives in a}} suburb and is trying to get to work in the central business district (CBD). If he is going to go by transit, a typical scenario might be the following: he must first walk to the closest bus stop, let us say a five or ten minute walk, and then he may have to wait up to another ten minutes, possibly in inclement weather, for the bus to arrive. When it arrives, he may have to stand unless he is lucky enough to find a seat. The bus will be caught up in street congestion and move slowly, and it will make many stops completely unrelated to his trip objective. The bus may then let him off at a terminal to a suburban train. Again he must wait, and, after boarding the train, again experience a number of stops {{on the way to the}} CBD, and possibly again he may have to stand in the aisle. He will get off at the station most convenient to his destination and possibly have to transfer again onto a distribution system. It is no wonder that in those cities where ample inexpensive parking is available, most of those who can drive do drive.|$|E

500|$|Since {{the sides}} of the pit consist of loose sand at its angle of repose, they afford an {{insecure}} foothold to any small insects that inadvertently venture over the edge, such as ants.

By throwing up loose sand {{from the bottom of the}} pit, the larva also undermines {{the sides of}} the pit, causing them to collapse and bring the prey with them.
