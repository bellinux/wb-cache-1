6000|$|Miss Jenny got his Persian gown upon him, {{extinguished}} {{his eyes}} crookedly with his Persian cap, {{and helped him}} to his bed: upon which he climbed groaning. 'Business {{between you and me}} being out of the question to-day, young man, and my time being precious,' said Miss Jenny then, 'I'll make myself scarce. <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>comfortable</b> now?' ...|$|E

If you can sit your horse, we shall ride on through Anicull. If not, we must wait till it gets dark again, {{and then go on}} as we are now. <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>comfortable,</b> child?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's funny; I {{never feel}} that way. I slept like a log after I knew <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>comfortable.</b> <b>You</b> {{must have a}} better bed and more blankets. It's always cold up here." ...|$|R

She dexterously takes the {{photograph}} from the pocket and throws it on the table before Bluntschli, who covers it with a sheet of paper under the very nose of Sergius, who looks on amazed, with his suspicions roused in the highest degree.

A rug for your knees? You're quite sure now? Well, wait {{just one moment}} till the waiter brings up a syphon, and you shall have a whiskey and soda. Precious--oh, yes, very {{precious}} these days--like drinking gold. Thirty-five lire a bottle, my boy!" [...] Argyle pulled a long face, and made a noise with his lips. [...] "But I had this bottle given me, and luckily you've come while there's a drop left. Very glad you have! Very glad you have." ...|$|E
6000|$|As {{they walked}} to the shooting-point, Jerry showed the lad how to hold the rifle, {{instructed}} him as to the backsight, and showed him how to get the foresight exactly on the nick of the backsight. [...] "You must just see the bead as if it were resting in the nick, and the object you aim at must just show above the top point of the bead." [...] He showed him how to load, and then told him to lie down, as he had done, on his chest, and to steady the rifle with the left arm, the elbow being on the ground. [...] "You must be quite comfortable," [...] he said; [...] "it is of no use trying to shoot {{if you are in a}} cramped position. Now, take a steady aim, and the moment you have got the two sights in a line on the rock, press the trigger steadily. Press pretty hard; it is only a pull of about two pounds, but it is wonderful how stiff a trigger feels the first time you pull at it. You need not be at all afraid of the kick. If you press the butt tightly against your shoulder you will hardly feel it, for there is plenty of weight in the barr'l, and it carries but a small charge of powder. You won't want to shoot at anything much beyond this range, but sometimes you may have to try at four or five hundred yards when you are in want of a dinner. In that case you can put in a charge and a half of powder. Now, <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>comfortable?</b> You need not grip so hard with your left hand, the gun only wants to rest between your thumb and fingers. That is better. Now take a steady aim, and the moment you have got it press the trigger. Well done! that is a good shot for a first. You hit the dust an inch or two to the right of the stone. If it had been a red-skin you would have hit him in the shoulder. You will do, lad, and by the time we get to Fort Bridger I guess you will bring down a stag as clean as nine out of ten hunters." ...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) North-West University, Mafikeng Campus, 2003 The {{research}} {{attempts to}} find the relationship between self-concept, academic achievement and peer counselling among students of the University of North West in South Africa. The study covered the following: Undergraduate, Postgraduate and Diplomas. The following questions {{are the focus of}} the research: Do you accept criticism objectively?; Do you reward yourself when YSU study?; and <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>comfortable</b> working in a group?. Data for the research were collected by means of questionnaires. Facts, opinions and information were obtained from 100 respondents. An analysis of data revealed some interesting results.

If you answer yes {{to any of}} these {{questions}} and you are a (wealthy) American, the chances are, according to the author of this well written book, you will be going to see your doctor about it. Carl Elliott qualified as a physician in South Carolina but soon switched to bioethics and philosophy. He is very concerned about the way his fellow citizens are constantly medicalizing their low self-esteem. What are the major causes of discontent with the self? Well, it could be your voice, your gender (trapped in the wrong body) or your inability to speak in public without blush-ing, sweating and making an idiot of yourself. According to a survey which Carl read somewhere, having to spea...|$|E
