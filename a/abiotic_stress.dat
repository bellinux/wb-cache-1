5|$|Overexpression of systemin and HypSys {{has been}} found to improve plants' {{tolerance}} to <b>abiotic</b> <b>stress,</b> including salt stress and UV radiation. When prosystemin was over-expressed in tomato, transgenic plants had lower stomatal conductance than normal plants. When grown in salt solutions, transgenic plants had higher stomatal conductances, lower leaf concentrations of abscisic acid and proline and a higher biomass. These findings suggest that systemin either allowed the plants to adapt to salt stress more efficiently or that they perceived a less stressful environment. Similarly, wounded tomato plants were less susceptible to salt stress than unwounded plants. This may be because wounding decreases the growth of the plant and therefore slows the uptake of toxic ions into the roots. An analysis of salt-induced changes in gene expression found that the differences measured between the transgenic and normal plants could not be accounted for by changes in conventional salt stress-induced pathways. Instead Orsini et al. suggested that the activation of the jasmonic acid pathway determines a physiological state that not only directs resources towards the production of compounds active against pests, but also pre-adapts plants to minimize water loss. These effects are achieved by negatively regulating the production of hormones and metabolites that will force plants to invest additional resources to counteract water loss, a secondary effect of herbivores.|$|E

25|$|In plants, {{glutathione}} {{is crucial}} for biotic and <b>abiotic</b> <b>stress</b> management. It is a pivotal component of the glutathione-ascorbate cycle, a system that reduces poisonous hydrogen peroxide. It is the precursor of phytochelatins, glutathione oligomers that chelate heavy metals such as cadmium. Glutathione is required for efficient defence against plant pathogens such as Pseudomonas syringae and Phytophthora brassicae. Adenylyl-sulfate reductase, an enzyme of the sulfur assimilation pathway, uses glutathione as an electron donor. Other enzymes using glutathione as a substrate are glutaredoxins. These small oxidoreductases are involved in flower development, salicylic acid, and plant defence signalling.|$|E

25|$|The ant faces many {{respiratory}} challenges due to {{its highly}} variable environment, which can cause increased desiccation, hypoxia, and hypercapnia. Hot, humid climates cause an increase in heart rate and respiration which increases energy and water loss. Hypoxia and hypercapnia can result from red imported fire ant colonies living in poorly ventilated thermoregulatory mounds and underground nests. Discontinuous gas exchange (DGE) may allow ants to survive the hypercapnic and hypoxic conditions frequently found in their burrows; it is ideal for adapting to these conditions because it allows the ants to increase the period of O2 intake and CO2 expulsion independently through spiracle manipulation. The invasion success of the red imported fire ant may possibly be related to its physiological tolerance to <b>abiotic</b> <b>stress,</b> being more heat tolerant and more adaptable to desiccation stress than S. richteri. This means that the ant is less vulnerable to heat and desiccation stress. Although S. richteri has higher water body content than the red imported fire ant, S. richteri was more vulnerable to desiccation stress. The lower sensitivity to desiccation {{is due to a}} lower water loss rate. Colonies living in unshaded and warmer sites tend to have a higher heat tolerance than those living in shaded and cooler sites.|$|E
25|$|Another {{mechanism}} of facilitation is a reduced {{risk of being}} eaten. Nurse plants, for example, not only reduce <b>abiotic</b> <b>stress,</b> but may also physically impede herbivory of seedlings growing under them. In both terrestrial and marine environments, herbivory of palatable species is reduced when they occur with unpalatable species. These “associational refuges” may occur when unpalatable species physically shield the palatable species, or when herbivores are “confused” by the inhibitory cues of the unpalatable species. Herbivory can also reduce predation of the herbivore, {{as in the case}} of the red-ridged clinging crab (Mithrax forceps) along the North Carolina, USA, coastline. This crab species takes refuge in the branches of the compact Ivory Bush Coral (Oculina arbuscula) and feeds on seaweed in the vicinity of the coral. The reduced competition with seaweed enhances coral growth, which in turn provides more refuge for the crab. A similar case is that of the interaction between swollen-thorn acacia trees (Acacia spp.) and certain ants (Pseudomyrmex spp.) in Central America. The acacia provides nourishment and protection (inside hollow thorns) to the ant in return for defense against herbivores. In contrast, a different type of facilitation between ants and sap-feeding insects may increase plant predation. By consuming sap, plant pests such as aphids produce a sugar-rich waste product called honeydew, which is consumed by ants in exchange for protection of the sap-feeders against predation.|$|E
25|$|The {{plant hormone}} {{ethylene}} is a combatant for salinity in most plants. Ethylene {{is known for}} regulating plant growth and development and adapted to stress conditions. Central membrane proteins in plants, such as ETO2, ERS1 and EIN2, are used for ethylene signaling in many plant growth processes. ETO2, Ethylene overproducer 2, is a protein that when mutated it will gain a function to continually produce ethylene even {{when there is no}} stress condition, causing the plant to grow short and stumpy. ERS1, Ethylene response sensor 1, is activated when ethylene is present in the signaling pathway and when mutated, it loses a function and cannot bind to ethylene. This means a response is never activated and the plant {{will not be able to}} cope with the <b>abiotic</b> <b>stress.</b> EIN2, Ethylene insensitive 2, is a protein that activates the pathway and when there is a mutation here the EIN2 will block ethylene stimulation and an ethylene response gene will not be activated. Mutations in these proteins can lead to heightened salt sensitivity and limit plant growth. The effects of salinity have been studied on Arabidopsis plants that have mutated ERS1 and EIN4 proteins. These proteins are used for ethylene signaling again certain stress conditions, such as salt and the ethylene precursor ACC is allowing suppress of any sensitivity to the salt stress. Mutations in these pathways can cause lack of ethylene signaling, causing stunt in plant growth and development.|$|E
40|$|Being sessile in nature, {{plants have}} to {{withstand}} various adverse environmental stress conditions including both biotic and <b>abiotic</b> <b>stresses.</b> Comparatively, <b>abiotic</b> <b>stresses</b> such as drought, salinity, high temperature, and cold pose {{major threat to}} agriculture by negatively impacting plant growth and yield worldwide. Rice {{is one of the}} most widely consumed staple cereals across the globe, the production and productivity of which is also severely affected by different <b>abiotic</b> <b>stresses.</b> Therefore, several crop improvement programs are directed toward developing stress tolerant rice cultivars either through marker assisted breeding or transgenic technology. Alternatively, some known rhizospheric competent bacteria are also known to improve plant growth during <b>abiotic</b> <b>stresses.</b> A plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR), Bacillus amyloliquefaciens NBRI-SN 13 (SN 13) was previously reported by our lab to confer salt stress tolerance to rice seedlings. However, the present study investigates the role of SN 13 in ameliorating various <b>abiotic</b> <b>stresses</b> such as salt, drought, desiccation, heat, cold, and freezing on a popular rice cv. Saryu- 52 under hydroponic growth conditions. Apart from this, seedlings were also exogenously supplied with abscisic acid (ABA), salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA) and ethephon (ET) to study the role of SN 13 in phytohormone-induced stress tolerance as well as its role in <b>abiotic</b> and biotic <b>stress</b> cross-talk. All <b>abiotic</b> <b>stresses</b> and phytohormone treatments significantly affected various physiological and biochemical parameters like membrane integrity and osmolyte accumulation. SN 13 also positively modulated stress-responsive gene expressions under various <b>abiotic</b> <b>stresses</b> and phytohormone treatments suggesting its multifaceted role in cross-talk among stresses and phytohormones in response to PGPR. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on detailed analysis of plant growth promotion and stress alleviation by a PGPR in rice seedlings subjected to various <b>abiotic</b> <b>stresses</b> and phytohormone treatments for 0, 1, 3, 10, and 24 h...|$|R
