5000|$|English Heritage {{originally}} {{welcomed the}} proposals, believing {{that it would}} provide [...] "new facilities and opportunities for the Southbank Centre to cement its position as the leading arts complex in Britain". However, their concerns about {{the scale of the}} development plans led Simon Hickman, English Heritage's Inspector of Historic Buildings and Areas, to submit a letter to Lambeth council on 5 July. He advised that English Heritage was aware of the [...] "volume of representations from the skateboard community in regards to this application, who value the Undercroft and feel it is part of their cultural identity". He added that, [...] "as it is their primary role to assess the physical effects of proposed development on a historic environment, further analysis was needed to find out the communal value of the Undercroft is necessary to ascertain the impact on recent cultural heritage". In September 2013 English Heritage published the following statement on its website. [...] "In 2012 the Department for Culture, Media and Sport granted the Southbank <b>Centre</b> a <b>Certificate</b> of Immunity from listing. This Certificate is valid for five years and during this period the building cannot be considered for listing. The decision cannot be challenged until this time has elapsed which, in this case, means June 2017. We appreciate the community value of the skate park and welcome the Southbank Centre’s commitment to providing a new one not far from the present location." ...|$|R
50|$|For a start, {{the faculty}} {{consisted}} of only Intermediate of Arts (I.A.; modern equivalent of higher secondary) with five {{subjects such as}} English, Civics, Geography, History and Logic. The courses were affiliated to Gauhati University in 1961. New courses on basic science were instituted in 1973. In 1974 the affiliation {{was transferred to the}} newly established North Eastern Hill University. The faculty of commerce was introduced in 1984, and with this, the college was, and remains, the only institute in Mizoram to offer the three different disciplines. Department of Public Administration was initiated in 2005. From 2012 two new departments, viz. Biotechnology and Environmental Science, were started.Presently, there are 11 departments in arts (English, Economics, Education, Geography, History, Mizo, Philosophy, Political Science, Psychology, Public Administration and sociology), 9 in science (Biotechnology, Botany, Chemistry, Environmental Science, Geology, Mathematics, Physics, Statistics and Zoology), and 1 in commerce. All these departments offer core/honour subject for Bachelor's degree. IGNOU Study <b>Centre</b> 1923 offers <b>certificate</b> courses such as in Environmental Studies, Laboratory Techniques, Higher Education, and HIV and Family Education, along with bachelor's degrees in arts and science.|$|R
30|$|The policy also {{included}} {{the development of}} an age-appropriate early learning curriculum, a substantial improvement in wages and benefits, investments in training and the requirement that 2 / 3 of the staff in <b>centres</b> have postsecondary <b>certificates</b> in early childhood education. The increase in required staff qualifications was accompanied by an innovative in-service program. While family childcare providers continue to provide the majority of spaces, quality improvement and other supports were to be provided by the non-profit “centres de la petite enfance” (CEPs), the cornerstone of the new system. The original plan was also to phase out for-profit providers, but a change in government — from the social democratic Parti Québecois to the Liberals — in 2003 enabled the for-profit sector to expand. In addition, the Liberal government weakened the position of the CEP’s in the system by removing them as the primary supports for family childcare. Instead, it created 165 new regional planning centres, although, the majority of these are run by CEPS (Beach, Friendly, Ferns, Prabhu, & Forer, 2009, p. 58). Finally, despite Quebec’s impressive efforts to expand regulated childcare spaces, the majority of families have still to rely on other forms of care. In response to the resultant equity concerns, the Liberal government added a generous tax credit for those having to rely on (receipted) for-profit childcare outside the system.|$|R
