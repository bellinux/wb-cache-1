40|$|There are {{two main}} {{approaches}} for defining social welfare relations for an economy with infinite horizon. The first one is to consider the set of intertemporal utility streams generated by a general set of bounded consumptions and define a preference relation between them. This relation is ideally required to satisfy two main axioms, the Pareto axiom, which guarantees efficiency and the Anonymity axiom, which guarantees equity. Basu and Mitra (2003) show {{that it is impossible}} to represent by a function a preference relation embodying both requirements, and Basu and Mitra (2007) propose and characterize a new welfare criterion called utilitarian social welfare relation. In the same framework, Chichilnisky (1996) proposes two axioms that capture the idea of sustainable growth : non-dictatorship of the present and non-dictatorship of the future, and exhibits a mixed criterion, adding a discounted utilitarian part, which gives a dictatorial role to the present, and a long term part, which gives a dictatorial role to the future. The drawback of Chichilnisky's approach is that it often does not allow to explicity characterize optimal growth paths with optimal control techniques. Our aim is less general than Chichilnisky's and Basu and Mitra's : we want to have a non-dictatorial criterion for optimal growth models. We restrict ourselves to the set of utilities of consumptions which are generated by a specific technology. We show that the undiscounted utilitarian criterion pioneered by Ramsey (1928) is not only convenient if one wants to solve an optimal growth problem but also sustainable, efficient and equitable. <b>Anonimity,</b> intergenerational equity, natural resources, non-dictatorship of the future, non-dictatorship of the present, optimal growth models, Pareto, social welfare function, social welfare relation, sustainability, utilitarian undiscounted criterion. ...|$|E

The work of theorists and scholars such as Henry Jenkins, Jean Baudrillard, Lev Manovich, Albert-Laszlo Barabasi, Erving Goffman, Sherry Turkle, George Landow, Marie-Laure Ryan and Espen Aarseth, among many others, are applied {{to the study of}} how key sociological and narratological concepts acquire new meanings when implemented in an electronic environment. More specifically, this research provides evidence of how emerging media culture challenges the traditional concepts of authorship, textuality, fictionality, sequential structure, and readership, with tendencies toward <b>anonimity,</b> pseudonymity, collaborative authorship, hypertextual narrative structures, and the reader's involvement in the creative process. Chapter One lays out the methodology used for the study of blog-fictions. This chapter proposes an interdisciplinary approach to blogging which combines the contributions made in several fields of study within digital humanities: computer-mediated communication theory, hypertext theory, Internet ethnography, social network theory, narratology of hypertext, research on blogging and Web 2. 0, ludology and performance studies. The purpose of this chapter is to conceptualize the study of blog-fictions both as an expression of information society in its current state, and as a new fictional genre that challenges traditional narrative concepts. In Chapter Two ("Blogosphere: a network of social convergences"), the center of analysis concerns the study of the blogger as a social type who reproduces its social life on the Internet. This chapter studies the peculiar and new ways in which bloggers communicate with each other and create social networks through the production and distribution of texts, hyperlinks, and multimedia artifacts. Chapter Three presents a theory of the blog-text focussing on its structure and defining features. Finally, Chapter Four analyzes how the socio-aesthetic and narrative concepts studied in previous chapters are reflected in blog-novels written in Spanish by Argentinean author Hernan Casciari. This research contributes to literary studies in general by acknowledging that electronic fictions and blog-fictions constitute an emerging literary genre with its own identifiable features, and are molded by the culture of the information society...|$|E

En los dos casos el problema se presenta ante el reconocimiento y tutela de un derecho del hijo a conocer la identidad de sus progenitores, y las pretensiones de limitar ese derecho para garantizar el anonimato de ciertos progenitores, como la madre soltera que pretende así evitar las cargas de la maternidad sin atentar contra la vida y salud del hijo y el tercero aportante de esperma que desea que su intervención en la técnica de reproducción asistida no le ocasione responsabilidades ni situaciones incómodas frente a los hijos que se han concebido {{gracias a}} sus gametos.

40|$|Background of Study: In {{the later}} period of modernization, rural-urban {{separation}} has disappeared and urban life {{has come into}} a situation such as that it has enclosed all dimensions of social relations. Today, to speak on society means, in a sense, to speak on the urban life. This fact has formed the new focus of sociological interest toward urban issue. Purpose of Study: In the article, with the references to the sociological literature {{of the twentieth century}} on the urban issue, the transformation of social relations, life-style, and the forms of sociality is examined. The condition of morality and the changing functions of communities in urban life constitute the main point of the study. Sources of Data: The observations and claims posited in their analysis on the urban life by some sociologists such as Wirth, Simmel, Sennett, and Bauman shapes the framework of the study. The studies of those scholars on the issue form the primary sources for the article. In addition, the critical and commentary texts on the thoughts of those scholars are used as secondary sources in the article. Main Discussion and Conclusions: At {{the beginning of the twentieth}} century, many sociologists had observed that traditional social relations in the urban space started to be solved under pressure of the new social formations. They had generally commented this circumstance as a quick direction toward “the loss of community” and “the emergence of a strict anonymity”. But, by the mid-twentieth century, it is observed that new primary social relations and new types of community have emerged. As a result of the urbanization of the society entirely “society” and “community” which were conceptualised in classical sociology as different types of sociality existing in different times and different places has come together with other in a same period and space. Thus, it clearly seems that the conceptualization of anonymity and the loss of community by Simmel and Wirth had Yirminci included extreme anticipations about the nature of the modern society. At the same time, The Yüzyıl emergence of new communities in the urban scene resulted in some anxieties such as “fall of public man” (Sennett). At the late-twentieth century, <b>anonimity</b> and communality are assessed as social structures giving response to different needs of urbanism and it is seen possible that they may co-exist together (Bauman). Contemporary cities can be seen “moral” space giving response to the needs of the people, who keep away from those, in their search for community as well as they are “ethic” space of anonymous relations and strangers. Today, to rescue the concepts such as urban-rural, society-community, etc. from their dualist meanings which were loaded on them by Classical Sociology has become an important problem for urban sociology...|$|E
40|$|These paper intents {{to develop}} an {{approach}} to Graffiti as kind of urban art. Graffiti {{can be seen as}} an operation, either individual or of a group, which enables to transform places, to establish communication, to improve city aesthetic quality. It allows people to participate in the transformation of urban spaces, it refines the dynamicity of forms, and puts color on grey walls, but is still considered illegal. Graffiti artists interfere in public spaces through informal appropriation. This action started around the end of the 60 s in the ghettos of New York and represented an innovative and revolutionary way to mark a territory where Hip-hop, Rap and Skate culture were growing and demanding visibility (Poato, 2006). Later grafitters started covering city walls with subtle and creative demonstrations of art, ethics claims and they established a kind of clandestine communication. Nowadays, graffiti is considered and legitimated as an artistic trend, but rises continuously polemical questions. Between the boundaries of vandalism and art, <b>anonimity</b> and identity, it acquires acknowledgement, while it develops aesthetically. The performance itself {{is more important than the}} aesthetic results, because it qualifies the language of graffiti as a practice and as a process created in urban spaces. Graffiti’s art can be described as “deprived art”, in the sense that the artist is conscious he will loose any kind of possession of his work, in the moment when he leaves the physical space, where his artistic creation took place. Once accomplished, the work of art is liable to any kind of interference, possibly erased or overlapped by another work. Therefore can be said that Grafitti is subjected to the informal laws of the city, on the other hand, is the city itself being transformed. There are different technics in the making of graffiti, but two streams are predominating: Graffiti rises on unused walls of constructions or demolitions. It avoids public patrimony and private spaces, uses paintings and strong colors and can take months to be finished. Writer (scribbler, tagger, trow-up) is an intervention of illegible nicknames. The writers consider the risk to mark prohibited places such as high, invigilated, inaccessible public spaces, private walls, edifices, bridges, train stations and sculptures, but they affirm: “When we have some place in our mind there are no limits, no barriers” (intervewee in Poato, 2006, p. 35) ”. Among these streams, lots of interventions are accomplished: stencils, writing painters (piece), stickers, etc. With some exceptions, all of them are prohibited. Two reasons why they are prohibited can be suggested: the first one is that it is not clear defined where vandalism finishes and art begins, the second can be recognized in the fact that “workers” arrogate themselves the right to interfere in public space, without asking for previous approval. In a generic sense the city is complex and mutable. In a subjective sense the city is everyday’s life experience. Both aspects are considerated by analysing the practice of graffiti. If we understand urban art as an aehstetic dimension of the city and the city not only as language, but also as a growing practice, graffiti increases the variety of aesthetic communication and works against an inactive and passive social behaviour. Do grafitti language and method only keep their original meaning and coherence if they are illegal? What is the right posture of public politics? Shoudn’t be stimulated as a policy open to citizen participation and free comunication? To begin, we will see the city like an integrator element, context and suport of this practice. We will then approach many kinds of contemporary arts related to graffiti. To end, some paradoxes of this art will be brought up to discussion...|$|E
40|$|The {{welfare state}} is {{transforming}} into a participatory society, in which citizens {{are expected to}} fill in the gaps left by the retreating government. At the same time, the government is trying to decentralize, putting increasing emphasis on cities, districts and neighborhoods. How can we, as urban planners and designers, facilitate participation in this changing political paradigm? A lof of concepts come into play when linking these ideas about society - thus social issues - to spatial solutions. The aim of this graduation project is to facilitate collective efficacy - the social cohesion among residents and their willingness to intervene on behalf of the common good. In order to do this, the urban planner/designer intervenes in the physical environment. The environment must be designed such, that it facilitates public familiarity on the one hand (people knowing one another) and territoriality on the other (individually or collectively feeling responsible for a space). These two concepts in turn can facilitate collective efficacy. In Beverwaard, a cauliflower neighborhood in the utter southeast of Rotterdam, the subjective scores of participation and social cohesion are far below average. and <b>anonimity</b> is high. Yet, the municipality of Rotterdam promotes Beverwaard as a district where people know one another, with a village-like vibe. These observations make Beverwaard a testcase very well suited for this graduation project. Beverwaard as a whole is mainly residential, except for one shopping center. However, the shopping center is located far away for a lot of residents, which means they often take the car to shopping centers outside of Beverwaard. Also, the district is experienced as a whole district instead of a district with spatially articulated smaller entities in terms of scale. The housing quality in Beverwaard is often appreciated, although they often house lower income groups. Hence, the residents of Beverwaard often feel at home in their own private houses and sometimes in the district as a whole; the institution of a neighborhood for instance, is hardly mentioned. The infrastructural system is characterized by a cauliflower structure; main roads branch out into secondary roads, which in turn branch out into third order streets that are often designed as “woonerven” or parking spaces (“hofjes” for parking). The public spaces for staying in Beverwaard, like the streets, are also differentiated in terms of scale of use. While most of the streets function relatively well with the exception of some of the hofjes for parking, the public spaces do not always work as well as perhaps intended. Often, the spaces that do not function well, are not used a lot or where conflict is likely to arise, {{there is a problem with}} the readability of the space. The territorial boundaries are often unclear. From a literature review and the spatial analysis of Beverwaard and Overschie as a case study, a pattern language has been developed. These design patterns each provide a hypothesis, often concerning a spatial solution for a socio-spatial problem. The patterns are a convenient way of translating research into design elements, while the design can likewise influence the patterns as well; developing a pattern language is a dialectic process. The basic layout of a design pattern makes it an ideal tool to communicate with laymen, but also with professionals. The patterns are ordered in a pattern language, in which the semantic relationships between the patterns play an important role. By visualizing these relationships, design choices can be made more explicit, and are therefore easier to communicate. Returning to Beverwaard, the main problems, as described, result from a lack of spatial articulation of certain spatial entities, as well as a lack of places to interact with others. The long-term vision for Beverwaard aims to take a few important measures: the boundaries of neighborhoods are spatially articulated, each neighborhood starts to develop an own identity overtime and the facilities located in the center now are spread out over the district at strategic locations as places to meet others. The vision ideally is established in a workshop with “local leaders”, actors who know what goes on in the district and have the capacity to act on it. Furthermore, two scenarios have been established to guide the transformation on the smaller scales: the readability scenario and the enclosure scenario. The readability scenario is aimed at spatially articulating territories on various scales; it is relatively cheap, flexible and “open”, as it outsiders are still allowed to go anywhere. The enclosure scenario in contrast, is characterized by an enclosure of spaces for outsiders or at least limiting the number of outsiders at specific locations. This scenario is relatively expensive, inflexible and “closed”. Ideally, the choice of scenario for a specific location is done in a workshop with local leaders as well. In this workshop, the more abstract, large scale patterns are employed. The choice of scenario provides the framework for the further infill of the actual interventions. The infill is ideally decided upon in a workshop by local residents; their local knowledge is essential in redesigning a public space, for instance. In this workshop, the more concrete and small scale patterns are used, as they can be more easily understood by the laymen and are most relevant for the concrete infill of the framework. The vision as well as the specific interventions are all targeted at making territories readable and facilitating public familiarity on various scales. Each of the interventions is shown in flowcharts, making the choices of patterns and thus the design choices explicit. Together, all the small scale interventions fit into the long-term vision and they will generate a district with a gradual transition from private to public. Hence, the original idea behind the cauliflower district has been updated, to form an environment that will facilitate collective efficacy. Beverwaard thereby might become the district it aims to be; a district ready for the participatory society. Urban FabricsUrbanismArchitecture and The Built Environmen...|$|E
