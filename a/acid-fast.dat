5|$|Diagnosing active {{tuberculosis}} {{based only on}} signs and symptoms is difficult, as is diagnosing the disease in those who are immunosuppressed. A diagnosis of TB should, however, be considered in those with signs of lung disease or constitutional symptoms lasting longer than two weeks. A chest X-ray and multiple sputum cultures for <b>acid-fast</b> bacilli are typically part of the initial evaluation. Interferon-γ release assays and tuberculin skin tests are of little use in the developing world. Interferon gamma release assays (IGRA) have similar limitations in those with HIV.|$|E
25|$|Other {{mycobacteria}} {{are also}} <b>acid-fast.</b> If the smear is positive, PCR or gene probe tests can distinguish M. tuberculosis from other mycobacteria. Even if sputum smear is negative, tuberculosis {{must be considered}} and is only excluded after negative cultures.|$|E
25|$|Leprosy {{is spread}} between people. This {{is thought to}} occur through a cough or contact with fluid from the nose of an {{infected}} person. Leprosy occurs more commonly among those living in poverty. Contrary to popular belief, it is not highly contagious. The two main types of disease {{are based on the}} number of bacteria present: paucibacillary and multibacillary. The two types are differentiated by the number of poorly pigmented, numb skin patches present, with paucibacillary having five or fewer and multibacillary having more than five. The diagnosis is confirmed by finding <b>acid-fast</b> bacilli in a biopsy of the skin or by detecting the DNA using polymerase chain reaction.|$|E
25|$|Legionella jordanis strain BL-540 {{was first}} {{isolated}} from water samples {{taken at the}} Jordan River in Bloomington, Indiana by Cherry et al. in 1978. Another strain characterized as ABB-9 was discovered in 1980 from sewage collected in DeKalb County, Georgia. The specific epithet jordanis {{was derived from the}} name of the river in which was discovered. The two strains were both Gram-stained. They Sudan black B fat stain for lipids and the Wirtz-Conklin method were used to demonstrate spore formation. <b>Acid-fast</b> staining was used, as well. The cultures were streaked onto trypticase soy agar (TSA) and charcoal yeast extract (CYE) agar slants, and were left to incubate around 36°C in candle extinction jars that remove oxygen from the jar by burning a candle with the lid tightly sealed. The cultures failed to grow on the TSA plates, but did show growth on CYE slants which Cherry et al. expected. They were removed at 24- and 48-hour periods and tested for oxidase and catalase production.|$|E
500|$|<b>Acid-fast</b> bacteria, such as Mycobacteria, are {{resistant}} to decolorisation by acids during staining procedures. The high mycolic acid content of Mycobacteria {{is responsible for the}} staining pattern of poor absorption followed by high retention. The most common staining technique used to identify <b>acid-fast</b> bacteria is the Ziehl-Neelsen stain or <b>acid-fast</b> stain, in which the <b>acid-fast</b> bacilli are stained bright-red and stand out clearly against a blue background.|$|E
500|$|Using {{histological}} {{stains on}} expectorated samples from phlegm (also called [...] "sputum"), scientists can identify MTB under a [...] microscope. Since MTB retains certain stains even after being treated with acidic solution, it {{is classified as}} an <b>acid-fast</b> bacillus. The most common <b>acid-fast</b> staining techniques are the Ziehl–Neelsen stain and the Kinyoun stain, which dye <b>acid-fast</b> bacilli a bright red that stands out against a blue background. Auramine-rhodamine staining and fluorescence microscopy are also used.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{staining}} techniques include <b>acid-fast</b> staining, {{which will}} stain the oocysts red. [...] One type of <b>acid-fast</b> stain is the Kinyoun stain. [...] Giemsa staining {{can also be}} performed. [...] Part of the small intestine can be stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H & E), which will show oocysts attached to the epithelial cells.|$|E
2500|$|The disease, {{discovered}} by Heinrich A. Johne, a German bacteriologist and veterinarian, in 1905, {{is caused by}} a bacterium named Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis, an <b>acid-fast</b> bacillus, often abbreviated MAP. MAP is akin to, but distinct from, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the main cause of tuberculosis in humans, and Mycobacterium bovis, the main cause of tuberculosis in cattle and occasionally also in humans. [...] MAP is 99% genetically related to Mycobacterium avium, but has different phenotypic characteristics, such as: ...|$|E
2500|$|Sputum smears and {{cultures}} {{should be done}} for <b>acid-fast</b> bacilli if the patient is producing sputum. [...] The preferred method for this is fluorescence microscopy (auramine-rhodamine staining), which is more sensitive than conventional Ziehl-Neelsen staining. In cases {{where there is no}} spontaneous sputum production, a sample can be induced, usually by inhalation of a nebulized saline or saline with bronchodilator solution. A comparative study found that inducing three sputum samples is more sensitive than three gastric washings.|$|E

L-form bacteria are strains of bacteria that lack cell walls. The main pathogenic bacteria in this class is Mycoplasma (not to be confused with Mycobacteria).|$|E
50|$|The auramine-rhodamine stain (AR), {{also known}} as the Truant auramine-rhodamine stain, is a {{histological}} technique used to visualize <b>acid-fast</b> bacilli using fluorescence microscopy, notably species in the Mycobacterium genus. <b>Acid-fast</b> organisms display a reddish-yellow fluorescence. Although the auramine-rhodamine stain is not as specific for <b>acid-fast</b> organisms (i.e. Mycobacterium tuberculosis or Nocardia) as the Ziehl-Neelsen stain, it is more affordable and more sensitive, therefore it is often utilized as a screening tool.|$|E
50|$|Franz Ziehl {{introduced}} the carbol fuchsin stain for the tubercle bacillus in 1882. With pathologist Friedrich Neelsen (1854-1898), {{he developed the}} Ziehl-Neelsen stain, {{also known as the}} <b>acid-fast</b> stain, which is used to identify <b>acid-fast</b> bacteria.|$|E

50|$|The high mycolic acid {{content of}} certain Protozoa cell walls, {{and those of}} Mycobacteria, is {{responsible}} for the staining pattern of poor absorption followed by high retention.

Another method is the Kinyoun method, in which the bacteria are stained bright red and stand out clearly against a green background. <b>Acid-fast</b> Mycobateria can also be visualized by fluorescence microscopy using specific fluorescent dyes (auramine-rhodamine stain, for example). Some bacteria may also be partially <b>acid-fast.</b> The eggs of the parasitic lung fluke Paragonimus westermani are actually destroyed by the stain, which can hinder diagnosis in patients who present with TB-like symptoms.|$|E
