A number of pandemics, notably <b>African</b> <b>sleeping</b> <b>sickness,</b> smallpox, swine influenza and amoebic dysentery, ravaged indigenous populations.

5|$|In 1903, Hector Duff {{wrote of}} how spotted hyenas in the Mzimba {{district}} of Angoniland would wait at dawn outside people's huts and attack {{them when they}} opened their doors. In 1908–09 in Uganda, spotted hyenas regularly killed sufferers of <b>African</b> <b>sleeping</b> <b>sickness</b> as they slept outside in camps. Spotted hyenas are widely feared in Malawi, {{where they have been}} known to occasionally attack people at night, particularly during the hot season when people sleep outside. Hyena attacks were widely reported in Malawi's Phalombe plain, to the north of Michesi Mountain. Five deaths were recorded in 1956, five in 1957 and six in 1958. This pattern continued until 1961 when eight people were killed. During the 1960s, Flying Doctors received over two dozen cases of hyena attacks on humans in Kenya. An anecdotal 2004 news report from the World Wide Fund for Nature indicates that 35 people were killed by spotted hyenas during a 12-month period in Mozambique along a 20km stretch of road near the Tanzanian border.|$|E
25|$|For current funding statistics, human African trypanosomiasis is grouped with kinetoplastid infections. Kinetoplastids {{refer to}} a group of {{flagellate}} protozoa. Kinetoplastid infections include <b>African</b> <b>sleeping</b> <b>sickness,</b> Chagas' disease, and Leishmaniasis. All together, these three diseases accounted for 4.4 million disability adjusted life years (DALYs) and an additional 70,075 recorded deaths yearly. For kinetoplastid infections, the total global research and development funding was approximately $136.3 million in 2012. Each of the three diseases, <b>African</b> <b>sleeping</b> <b>sickness,</b> Chagas' disease, and Leishmaniasis each received approximately a third of the funding, which was about $36.8 million US dollars, $38.7 million US dollars, and $31.7 million US dollars, respectively.|$|E

25|$|Much of the {{progress}} {{that has been made}} in <b>African</b> <b>sleeping</b> <b>sickness</b> and neglected disease research as a whole {{is a result of the}} other non-public funders. One of these major sources of funding has come from foundations, which have increasingly become more committed to neglected disease drug discovery in the 21st century. In 2012, philanthropic sources provided 15.9% of the total funding. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has been a leader in providing funding for neglected disease drug development.

25|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, aniline {{emerged as an}} {{analgesic}} drug, its cardiac-suppressive side effects countered with caffeine.

Salvarsan's targeted microorganism, not yet recognized as a bacterium, was still thought to be a parasite, and medical bacteriologists, believing that bacteria were not susceptible to the chemotherapeutic approach, overlooked Alexander Fleming's report in 1928 on the effects of penicillin.|$|E
25|$|Regular active surveillance, {{involving}} {{detection and}} prompt treatment of new infections, and tsetse fly control is {{the backbone of}} the strategy used to control sleeping sickness. Systematic screening of at-risk communities is the best approach, because case-by-case screening is not practical in endemic regions. Systematic screening may be in the form of mobile clinics or fixed screening centres where teams travel daily to areas of high infection rates. Such screening efforts are important because early symptoms are not evident or serious enough to warrant patients with gambiense disease to seek medical attention, particularly in very remote areas. Also, diagnosis of the disease is difficult and health workers may not associate such general symptoms with trypanosomiasis. Systematic screening allows early-stage disease to be detected and treated before the disease progresses, and removes the potential human reservoir. A single case of sexual transmission of West <b>African</b> <b>sleeping</b> <b>sickness</b> has been reported.|$|E
25|$|Vectors may be {{mechanical}} or biological. A mechanical vector {{picks up}} an infectious agent {{on the outside}} of its body and transmits it in a passive manner. An example of a mechanical vector is a housefly, which lands on cow dung, contaminating its appendages with bacteria from the feces, and then lands on food prior to consumption. The pathogen never enters the body of the fly. In contrast, biological vectors harbor pathogens within their bodies and deliver pathogens to new hosts in an active manner, usually a bite. Biological vectors are often responsible for serious blood-borne diseases, such as malaria, viral encephalitis, Chagas disease, Lyme disease and <b>African</b> <b>sleeping</b> <b>sickness.</b> Biological vectors are usually, though not exclusively, arthropods, such as mosquitoes, ticks, fleas and lice. Vectors are often required in the life cycle of a pathogen. A common strategy used to control vector borne infectious diseases is to interrupt the life cycle of a pathogen by killing the vector.|$|E

25|$|Although spotted hyenas do prey {{on humans}} in modern times, such {{incidents}} are rare.

According to hyena expert Dr. Hans Kruuk, man-eating spotted hyenas tend to be very large specimens: A pair of man-eating hyenas, responsible for killing 27 people in Mulanje (Mlanje), Malawi in 1962, were weighed at 72kg (159lb) and 77kg (170lb) after being shot. In 1903, Hector Duff wrote of how spotted hyenas in the Mzimba district of Angoniland would wait at dawn outside people's huts and attack them when they opened their doors. Victims of spotted hyenas tend to be women, children and sick or infirm men: Theodore Roosevelt wrote on how in 1908–1909 in Uganda, spotted hyenas regularly killed sufferers of <b>African</b> <b>sleeping</b> <b>sickness</b> as they slept outside in camps.

40|$|Abstract In human <b>African</b> trypanosomiasis (<b>sleeping</b> <b>sickness),</b> {{sleep and}} wake episodes are {{sporadically}} {{distributed throughout the}} day and the night.

Polysomnographic recordings were continu-ous, and blood was taken every 10 min throughout the 24 -h period. Plasma was analyzed for cortisol, prolactin, and plasma renin activity (PRA). The 24 -h rhythm of cortisol, considered to be an endogenous circadian rhythm, was attenuated in all of the patients except one. However, as in normal subjects, slow wave sleep (SWS) remained associated with the declining phases of the cortisol secretory episodes.
