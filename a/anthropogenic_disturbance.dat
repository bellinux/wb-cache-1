25|$|The primary {{threats to}} this species are {{anthropogenic}} habitat disturbance and hunting for food. A common human disturbance occurs through habitat destruction via land reclamation from marshes for agriculture, which has occurred especially in southeast Brazil and may therefore evoke conservation {{concern for the}} species in this area. Claiming land for agriculture by digging canals, together with land filling and sewage discharges may also threaten dry-season foraging environments for maguari storks especially on the northern Rio de Janeiro coast. The maguari stork is vulnerable to nesting habitat destruction because it shows nest-site fidelity, {{and will continue to}} nest in the same place even after onset of recent <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>disturbance.</b> Use of pesticides may also adversely affect the health and breeding success of this species. The capture of individuals for food presents another survival threat and occurs particularly in the Southern Amazon and Venezuela.|$|E

40|$|Fire-prone Mediterranean heathlands are {{biodiversity}} hotspots {{and home}} to a multitude of fire-dependent species. Fire-suppression policies worldwide have increased the risk of extinction of such species or have delegated relative prominence to other disturbances. This study explores how such a substitution of disturbances can alter the realized niche and population structure of a post-fire specialist. Using multi-model inference, we evaluate the relative magnitude and directionality (positive or negative) in the effect of large-scale (entire range) and local-scale (southern Spain) <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>disturbances</b> on the occurrence and abundance of Drosophyllum lusitanicum. This rare carnivorous plant is endemic to heathlands in the Southwestern Iberian Peninsula and northwestern Morocco managed under strict fire suppression policies. An increase in regional-scale <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>disturbances</b> did not affect regional-scale occurrence but significantly decreased abundance of Drosophyllum. On the other hand, local-scale <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>disturbances</b> positively affected both population occurrence and abundance. We demonstrate that non-fire <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>disturbances</b> can drive the population structure and distribution of an endemic post-fire specialist in Mediterranean heathlands, but their impacts change with their spatial scale. Although large-scale disturbances may threaten populations, small-scale disturbances may be more significant for species occurrence, and positively affect the distribution and abundances of pyrophytic species. In heathlands where fire suppression is a common practice, applying such disturbance regimes can be crucial {{for the preservation of}} fire-adapted species...|$|R

40|$|Background and Aims: Natural and <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>disturbances</b> {{can act as}} {{stresses}} on tree vigour. According to Manion's {{conceptual model}} of tree disease, the initial vigour of trees decreases {{as a result of}} predisposing factors that render these trees more vulnerable to severe inciting stresses, stresses that can then cause final vigour decline and subsequent tree death. This tree disease model was tested in sugar maple (Acer saccharum) by assessing the roles of natural and <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>disturbances</b> in tree decline and death. • Methods: Radial growth data from 377 sugar maple trees that had undergone both defoliations by insects and partial harvest were used to estimate longitudinal survival probabilities as a proxy for tree vigour. Radial growth rates and survival probabilities were compared among trees subjected to different levels of above- and below-ground disturbances, between periods of defoliation and harvest, and between live and dead trees. • Key Results: Manion's tree disease model correctly accounts for vigour decline and tree death in sugar maple; tree growth and vigour were negatively affected by a first defoliation, predisposing these trees to death later during the study period due to a second insect outbreak that initiated a final vigour decline. This decline was accelerated by the partial harvest disturbance in 1993. Even the most severe <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>disturbances</b> from partial harvest did not cause, unlike insect defoliation, any growth or vigour declines in live sugar maple. • Conclusions: Natural disturbances acted as predisposing and inciting stresses in tree sugar maple decline and death. <b>Anthropogenic</b> <b>disturbances</b> from a partial harvest at worst accelerated a decline in trees that were already weakened by predisposing and inciting stresses (i. e. repeated insect defoliations). Favourable climatic conditions just before and after the partial harvest may have alleviated possible negative effects on growth resulting from harvesting...|$|R
