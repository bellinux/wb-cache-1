International Fight Week {{is expected to be}} an annual July occurrence, coinciding with a Las Vegas UFC event. UFC President Dana White stated, [...] "The first annual International Fight Week will be awesome, the fans <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> fight week experience better than anything they've ever had before, and each year we are going to build this thing to the point where every fan on the planet knows they have to come to Vegas for this July fight week at least once in their lives." [...] The UFC Fan Expo (two days of fighter meet-and-greets, training seminars, a Grapplers Quest tournament, autograph sessions and other events) also occurred on July 6 and 7.|$|E
500|$|On a Martin Luther King, Jr. Day (January 16, 1989) {{episode of}} ABC's late-night news program Nightline, Julian Bond, a social activist and {{leader in the}} Civil Rights Movement, nicknamed the film [...] "Rambo Meets the Klan" [...] and criticized its {{depiction}} of the FBI: [...] "People <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> mistaken idea about that time... It's just wrong. These guys were tapping our telephones, not looking into the murders of [...]" [...] Filmmaker Spike Lee criticized the film for its lack of central African-American characters; {{he felt it was}} among several other films that used a white savior narrative to exploit blacks in favor of depicting whites as heroes. When asked about the film at the 1989 Cannes Film Festival, Lee responded, [...] "Hated it. They should have had the guts to have at least one central black character." ...|$|E

5000|$|The main {{character}} team are The Mates. While there are parallels with The Beatles and each {{character is a}} pastiche of a superhero, Tischman insisted the concept was much broader than that: [...] "The persona of the Mates is an iconic one for both superhero teams and rock bands. You <b>are</b> always <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the really cute one. You <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the quiet one. You <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the spiritual one and you <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the goofy one.

500|$|The fair {{organizers}} did not await {{congressional approval}} to begin planning the coin. [...] According to Swiatek and Breen, the fair's director general Frank B. Davison {{came up with}} the concept for the designs. On December7, 1922, Commission of Fine Arts chairman Charles Moore wrote to Buffalo nickel designer and sculptor member of the commission James Earle Fraser, [...] "The Los Angeles people are planning to celebrate the Monroe Doctrine Centennial. [...] They <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> 50-cent piece and have decided that on the obverse shall be the heads of President Monroe and John Quincy Adams... On the reverse will be the western continents from Hudson Bay to Cape Horn with some dots for the West Indies and some indication of the Panama Canal... It strikes me that the designs having been settled upon, the [...] models could be worked out quite readily and that a pretty swell thing could be made." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jackson {{was also}} {{reportedly}} seeking coalition with whites {{in order to}} approach what were considered racial problems as economic and class problems, [...] "When we change the race problem into a class fight {{between the haves and}} the have-nots, then we <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> new ball game", he said. In the 21st century, some public school systems are working on an approach for affirmative action that deals with family income rather than race, recognizing that some minority members have been very successful. The Times also indicated that Jackson was being criticized as too involved with middle-class blacks, and for having an unattainable goal of racial unity.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2012, Marshall led a {{successful}} effort {{to defeat the}} nomination of openly gay prosecutor Tracy Thorne-Begland to a district court judgeship, who was supported by both the governor and a bipartisan judicial committee. Marshall {{explained that he was}} worried about possible bias {{in the case of a}} bar-room fight between a homosexual and a heterosexual. In a subsequent interview with CNN, he declared that [...] "sodomy is not a civil right." [...] In January 2013, the House of Delegates held a new vote and confirmed the nomination of Thorne-Begland for judgeship. The vote again received bipartisan support. In response to the confirmation, Marshall said, [...] "The members who switched <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> hard time explaining this to the Republican base...The conservatives are not going to be very pleased about this." ...|$|E

2500|$|It {{is unclear}} {{what has been}} spent so far on {{planning}} and preparing for each pilot cull and who exactly is paying for what, i.e. what taxpayers are paying for and what the farming industry is paying for. Costings of the culls have not factored in socio-economic costs, such as tourism and any potential boycotts of dairy products from the cull zones. Others opposed to the cull argue that for economic reasons the government have chosen the most inhumane approach to disease eradication. Tony Dean, Chairperson of the Gloucestershire Badger Group, warns that some badgers will not be killed outright: [...] "You {{have got to be}} a good marksman to kill a badger outright, with one shot... Many of the badgers will be badly injured. They will go back underground after being shot, probably badly maimed. They will die a long lingering death underground from lead poisoning etc. We <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> lot of cubs left underground where their mothers have been shot above ground." [...] He also suggests that domestic pets will be at risk in the cull areas, as some farmers will mistake black and white cats and dogs for badgers.|$|E
2500|$|When Justice Stephen Breyer {{asked if}} [...] "Congress passes a law {{and it says}} it's a very nice thing to commemorate the Pilgrims by {{building}} a Government church at Plymouth Rock, where {{we will have the}} regular worship in the Puritan religion. Now can a taxpayer from California in your view challenge that?" [...] Clement responded [...] "I say no. I would say no, no." [...] Because in his reading of Flast, [...] "You need a congressional statute that is an exercise of the taxing and spending authority; but then you need the money to go outside the Government." [...] Breyer than asked if [...] "All over America, they build churches dedicated to one religion; and Congress passes a statute and says in every city, town, and hamlet, we <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> minister, a Government minister, a Government church, and dedicated to the proposition that this particular sect is the true sect; and they pass a statute like that, nobody could challenge it?" [...] Clement answered [...] "I think {{the bottom line is that}} there would not be taxpayer standing. Plenty of people could probably challenge that [...]" ...|$|E
2500|$|Balachander {{wanted the}} same artistes to reprise their roles on television. Unfortunately, Sivakumar was {{committed}} to a daily soap. Suhasini was willing to play Sindhu but Balachander {{decided to have a}} different face—he felt if Suhasini played Sindhu, viewers would expect Sivakumar to play JKB. [...] "You cannot separate JKB and Sindhu. Sir (Balachander) felt if we <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> different JKB, let's have a different Sindhu too," [...] says Subha. This is when Y. Gee. Mahendra, a well-known theater and film personality was selected to play JKB. [...] "It is a challenge for a comedy artist like me to do a character role like JKB. I am enjoying both the challenge and the role," [...] he said. He, who has acted in more than 300 films, said {{it is a kind of}} homecoming for him. [...] "I acted in a Balachander film 26 years ago!". He was not worried about the fact that JKB was once successfully portrayed by Sivakumar. [...] "Had it been done by Sivaji (Sivaji Ganesan), I would not have accepted the role. Only two people inspire me, and they are K. Balachander and Sivaji [...] When I have KB on the sets to guide me, why should I worry? I also have my other guru Sivaji in mind".|$|E
