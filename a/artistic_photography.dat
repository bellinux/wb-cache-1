5|$|Apart {{from the}} 20 rather amateurish <b>artistic</b> <b>photography</b> events {{arranged}} by Aage Remfeldt between 1946 and 1976 at Charlottenborg, Denmark had few photographic exhibitions until the 1960s. The situation improved in 1963 when Jesper Høm arranged an {{exhibition at the}} Danish Museum of Art & Design with photographers from New York City, Moscow and Paris. Another positive influence was Keld Helmer-Petersen's book Fragments of a City with photographs of fire escapes and artistically silhouetted cranes taken {{while he was a}} student at Chicago's Institute of Design, some of which were published in the magazine Perspectiv.|$|E
25|$|Photography: To produce his silkscreens, Warhol made {{photographs}} or {{had them}} made by {{his friends and}} assistants.

25|$|Later in the year, {{after his}} return, Stieglitz was {{unanimously}} elected {{as one of}} the first two American members of The Linked Ring.

At the time there were two photographic clubs in New York, the Society of Amateur Photographers and the New York Camera Club. Stieglitz resigned from his position at the Photochrome Company and as editor of American Amateur Photographer and spent most of 1895 negotiating a merger of the two clubs.|$|E

25|$|Thomas Dodd´s {{father was}} an {{advanced}} amateur photographer of Irish ancestry, who taught his son the essentials of photography: composition, depth, lighting, {{and how to make}} quality portraits. Dodd in turn, learnt the basic techniques of a dark-room laboratory (such as negative development, enlarging, printing etc.) as part of his extra-curricular activity while attending Winter Park High School in Orange County, Florida. Dodd became interested in <b>artistic</b> <b>photography</b> through admiring Ansel Adam´s prints at a gallery in Florida. Inspired by punk rock groups like the Sex Pistols and Ramones, Dodd learnt to play the guitar and spent the 1980s playing in punk rock bands in Florida and Atlanta. Soon after, Dodd became interested in Irish music and learnt to play the Celtic harp. In 1992 Dodd founded an ambient Celtic ensemble called Trio Nocturna, which had several sponsored appearances in New Orleans, Chicago and Atlanta. Trio Nocturna gained attention in the Gothic scene, recording three commercial albums named Morphia, Tears of Light and Songs of the Celtic Night.|$|E

Its first issue was published in July 1897. It was soon considered the finest photographic magazine in the world.
