5|$|The rise of totalitarian {{regimes in}} Germany, Russia, and other {{countries}} who rejected {{freedom of speech and}} association had a large impact on the civil liberties movement in the U.S.; anti-communist sentiment rose <b>and</b> <b>civil</b> <b>liberties</b> were curtailed.|$|E
40|$|The current {{literature}} {{has failed to}} differentiate between the collapse of democratic and authoritarian rules or whether democratic regimes collapse {{for the same reasons}} as do authoritarian regimes. Therefore, the {{current literature}} is silent on whether democracies are more fragile or less susceptible to economic and political breakdowns. Using a multitude of political instability variables, this paper explores empirically, whether political freedom <b>and</b> <b>civil</b> <b>liberty</b> (a proxy for democracy) has any effect on the stability of the political order. The empirical results of the paper confirm the hypothesis that democracy is conducive to political stability; the higher the level of political freedom <b>and</b> <b>civil</b> <b>liberty,</b> the more stable countries are. The paper also presented a Granger-causality test of political instability and the level of political freedom <b>and</b> <b>civil</b> <b>liberty.</b> The test results indicate that the level of political freedom <b>and</b> <b>civil</b> <b>liberty</b> Granger-cause the level of political instability, while the level of political instability does not Granger-cause the level of political freedom <b>and</b> <b>civil</b> <b>liberty.</b> The test results indicate that Granger-causality runs one-way from political freedom <b>and</b> <b>civil</b> <b>liberty</b> to political instability and not the other way. A further comprehensive research is needed on the multi-layered and the complex relationship among democracy and the resilience of the political order.

5|$|Hentoff {{was known}} as a civil libertarian, free speech activist, anti-death penalty advocate, and anti-abortion advocate. He {{supported}} the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and the State of Israel. Hentoff espoused generally liberal views on domestic policy <b>and</b> <b>civil</b> <b>liberties,</b> but in the 1980s, he began articulating more socially conservative positions—opposition to abortion, voluntary euthanasia, and the selective medical treatment of severely disabled infants. Hentoff argued that a consistent life ethic should be the viewpoint of a genuine civil libertarian, arguing that all human rights are at risk when the rights of any one group of people are diminished, that human rights are interconnected, and people deny others' human rights at their peril.|$|E

5|$|By 1964, {{membership}} {{had risen}} to 80,000, and the ACLU participated in efforts to expand civil liberties. In the 1960s, the ACLU continued its decades-long effort to enforce {{separation of church and}} state. It defended several anti-war activists during the Vietnam War. The ACLU was involved in the Miranda case, which addressed conduct by police during interrogations, and in the New York Times case, which established new protections for newspapers reporting on government activities. In the 1970s and 1980s, the ACLU ventured into new legal areas, involving the rights of homosexuals, students, prisoners, and the poor. In the twenty-first century, the ACLU has fought the teaching of creationism in public schools and challenged some provisions of anti-terrorism legislation as infringing on privacy <b>and</b> <b>civil</b> <b>liberties.</b> Fundraising and membership spiked after the 2016 election; the ACLU's current membership is more than 1.2 million.|$|E
5|$|Coke {{undertook}} {{the central}} role in framing and writing the Petition of Right. The ongoing struggles over martial law <b>and</b> <b>civil</b> <b>liberties,</b> along with {{the rejection of the}} Resolutions seriously concerned the Commons. Accordingly, Coke convinced the Lords to meet with the Commons in April 1628 in order to discuss a petition to the King confirming the rights and liberties of royal subjects. The Commons immediately accepted this, and after a struggle, the Lords agreed to allow a committee chaired by Coke to draft the eventual document. Hearing of this, the King sent a message to Parliament forbidding the Commons from discussing matters of state. The resulting debate led to some MPs being unable to speak due to their fear that the King was threatening them with the destruction of Parliament. Coke, despite the fear in Parliament, stood and spoke, citing historical precedents supporting the principle that members of the Commons could, within Parliament, say whatever they wished – something now codified as Parliamentary privilege.|$|E
5|$|World War II {{broke out}} shortly after Minton joined the court, {{creating}} {{a flood of}} cases in which legal precedent provided little guidance, including challenges to wartime measures, selective service laws, price controls, rationing <b>and</b> <b>civil</b> <b>liberties.</b> In {{the majority of these}} cases, the court affirmed the decisions of the district courts, but in several the court was required to establish a precedent. Minton stated on several occasions his personal preference to affirm the decisions of the lower courts. He believed that the court that heard the case and pronounced judgment was generally able to make a decision that was superior to appellate courts' decisions. He believed the appellate process should be reserved for the more serious cases and cases where the lower court had clearly made a mistake.|$|E
