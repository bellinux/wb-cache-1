2500|$|Horses from {{different}} regions of Mongolia are considered to have different traits. [...] Desert horses {{are said to have}} larger feet than average ("like camel's feet"). [...] Mountain horses are short and particularly strong. [...] Steppe horses are the tallest, fastest variety of Mongol horses. [...] Specifically, the eastern Khentii Province and Sükhbaatar Province steppe provinces are widely considered to produce the fastest horses in the country. [...] Darkhad horses are known for their strength. A Darkhad horse weighing only 250kg can carry a load of 300kg—the equivalent of carrying another horse on its back. [...] On <b>a</b> <b>broader</b> <b>level,</b> some Mongolian provinces are considered to be more suitable for horse rearing than others.

One such account, @EveryoneIsDril, shares screenshots of tweets by other people that sound like dril's voice. Another, [...] "wint MP" [...] or @parliawint, attaches dril tweets styled like teletext closed captions to images from BBC News of British politicians and journalists speaking. Although seemingly niche, the wint MP account garnered 14,000 followers by May 2017. Tom Dissonance, the creator of wint MP, attributed the account's success to its functioning as a joke on multiple levels, and for multiple audiences: [...] "there are people who get the in-jokey references; there's <b>a</b> <b>broader</b> <b>level</b> of people who get politics and dril, and understand the significance of one commenting on another; and beyond {{that there are people}} who just appreciate an official figure in a suit saying something ridiculous. It's an onion of silliness." [...] Koshy commented that wint MP [...] "stands out from traditional forms of satire because it has no normative force. It recommends nothing about the way things should be. The political field it presents is slack-jawed, demented, putrid and amoral – there is no value beyond the scope of its image." [...] According to Shaw, the absurd political atmosphere of the mid to late 2010s made it [...] "the Age of Dril": ...|$|E
