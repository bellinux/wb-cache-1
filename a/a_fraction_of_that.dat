5|$|Helium must be {{extracted}} from natural gas {{because it is}} present in air at only <b>a</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> of neon, yet the demand for it is far higher. It is estimated that if all neon production were retooled to save helium, that 0.1% of the world's helium demands would be satisfied. Similarly, only 1% of the world's helium demands could be satisfied by re-tooling all air distillation plants. Helium can be synthesized by bombardment of lithium or boron with high-velocity protons, or by bombardment of lithium with deuterons, but these processes are a completely uneconomical method of production.|$|E

With few natural resources, Japan was dependent on raw materials, particularly oil, imported from Manchuria {{and other parts of}} the East Asian mainland, and from the conquered territory in the Dutch East Indies. The destruction of the Japanese merchant fleet, combined with the strategic bombing of Japanese industry, had wrecked Japan's war economy.

According to urban designer and futurist Michael E. Arth, driverless electric vehicles—in conjunction with the increased use of virtual reality for work, travel, and pleasure—could reduce the world's 800 million vehicles to <b>a</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> number within a few decades. This would be possible if almost all private cars requiring drivers, which are not in use and parked 90% of the time, would be traded for public self-driving taxis that would be in near constant use. This would also allow for getting the appropriate vehicle for the particular need—a bus could come for a group of people, a limousine could come for a special night out, and a Segway could come for a short trip down the street for one person. Children could be chauffeured in supervised safety, DUIs would no longer exist, and 41,000 lives could be saved each year in the US alone.|$|E

On November21, 2012, NYSDOT announced plans to close the parkway between Lakeside Beach State Park and NY98 during the winter months, citing the low wintertime traffic volumes along the road. The move will save roughly $70,000 in costs related to plowing and salting. The stretch was closed on November28 and will be reopened {{at the end of the}} winter weather season. A detour is posted along NY18, which parallels the parkway for most of its length. Many believe this section of the roadway has low traffic volume due to the serious deterioration and lack of state funding for upkeep.|$|E

2500|$|Water in Earth's {{atmosphere}} {{is not merely}} below its boiling point (100°C), but at altitude it goes below its freezing point (0°C), due to water's highly polar attraction. When combined with its quantity, water vapor then has a relevant dew point and frost point, unlike e. g., carbon dioxide and methane. Water vapor thus has a scale height <b>a</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> of the bulk atmosphere, as the water condenses and exits, primarily in the troposphere, the lowest layer of the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide (...) and methane, being non-polar, rise above water vapor. The absorption and emission of both compounds contribute to Earth's emission to space, and thus the planetary greenhouse effect. This greenhouse forcing is directly observable, via distinct spectral features versus water vapor, and observed to be rising with rising [...] levels. Conversely, adding water vapor at high altitudes has a disproportionate impact, which is why methane (rising, then oxidizing to [...] and two water molecules) and jet traffic have disproportionately high warming effects.|$|E
2500|$|The {{methods of}} matter {{assimilation}} and nutrient transport used by insects make insect cultivation {{a more efficient}} method of converting plant material into biomass than rearing traditional livestock. More than 10 times more plant material is needed to produce one kilogram of meat than one kilogram of insect biomass. The spatial usage and water requirements are only <b>a</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> required to produce the same mass of food with cattle farming. Production of 150g of grasshopper meat requires very little water, while cattle requires 3290 liters to produce {{the same amount of}} beef. This indicates that lower natural resource use and ecosystem strain could be expected from insects {{at all levels of the}} supply chain. Edible insects also display exponentially faster growth and breeding cycles than traditional livestock. An analysis of the carbon intensity of five edible insect species conducted at the University of Wageningen, Netherlands found that [...] "the average daily gain (ADG) of the five insect species studied was 4.0-19.6 percent, the minimum value of this range being close to the 3.2% reported for pigs, whereas the maximum value was 6 times higher. Compared to cattle (0.3%), insect ADG values were much higher." [...] Additionally, all insect species studied produced much lower amounts of ammonia than conventional livestock, though further research is needed to determine the long-term impact. The authors conclude that insects could serve as a more environmentally friendly source of dietary protein.|$|E
