5|$|After some refitting, President, {{still under}} Rodgers' command, sailed on 8October with Congress, United States, and Argus. On 12October, United States and Argus parted from the {{squadron}} {{for their own}} patrols. On 10October, President chased , but failed to overtake her. On 17October President captured the British packet ship Swallow, which carried {{a large amount of}} currency on board. On 31October, President <b>and</b> <b>Congress</b> began pursuit of , which was escorting two merchant ships. The chase lasted about three hours, and in that time Congress captured the merchant ship Argo. Meanwhile, President kept after Galatea and drew very close, but lost sight of her in the night. Congress and President remained together, but did not find any ships to capture during November. Returning to the United States, they passed north of Bermuda and proceeded toward the Virginia capes; they arrived in Boston on 31December, having taken nine prizes. President <b>and</b> <b>Congress</b> found themselves blockaded there by the Royal Navy until April 1813.|$|E
5|$|Congress overrode a Johnson veto to {{pass the}} Civil Rights Act of 1866 (also {{introduced}} by Trumbull), granting African-Americans citizenship and equality before the law, and forbidding any action by a state to the contrary. Johnson made the gap between him <b>and</b> <b>Congress</b> wider when he accused Stevens, Sumner, and Wendell Phillips of trying to destroy the government.|$|E

The population {{did not meet}} the 60,000 threshold the Northwest Ordinance required for a new state, but both Illinoisans <b>and</b> <b>Congress</b> expected continued growth.|$|E

5|$|On June 26, 2009, the House of Representatives {{approved}} the American Clean Energy and Security Act 219 to 212, mandating EPA to exclude ILUC for a 5-year period, {{vis a vis}} RFS2. During this period, more research is to be conducted to develop more reliable models and methodologies for estimating ILUC, <b>and</b> <b>Congress</b> will review this issue before allowing EPA to rule on this matter.

5|$|President James Monroe <b>and</b> <b>Congress</b> invited Lafayette {{to visit}} the United States in 1824, in part to {{celebrate}} the nation's upcoming 50thanniversary. Monroe intended to have Lafayette travel on an American warship, but the general felt having such a vessel as transport was undemocratic, and booked passage on a merchantman. LouisXVIII did not approve of the trip, and his officers had troops disperse the crowd that gathered at Le Havre to see Lafayette off.|$|E
5|$|Virginia headed {{directly}} for the Union squadron. The battle opened when Union tug Zouave fired on the advancing enemy, and Beaufort replied. This preliminary skirmishing had no effect. Virginia did not open fire {{until she was}} within easy range of Cumberland.

5|$|Washington's {{victories}} wrecked the British carrot-and-stick {{strategy of}} showing overwhelming force then offering generous terms. The Americans would not negotiate for {{anything short of}} independence. These victories alone were not enough to ensure ultimate Patriot victory, however, since many soldiers did not reenlist or deserted during the harsh winter. Washington <b>and</b> <b>Congress</b> reorganized the army with increased rewards for staying and punishment for desertion, which raised troop numbers effectively for subsequent battles.|$|E

5|$|As the 11th New York Regiment had {{experienced}} first hand, the First Battle of Bull Run in July 1861 {{had taken a}} heavy toll on Union forces, including those from New York City. As the war dragged on, a military manpower shortage occurred in the Union <b>and</b> <b>Congress</b> passed the first conscription act in United States history on March 3, 1863, authorizing the President to draft male citizens {{between the ages of}} 18 and 35 for a three-year term of military service.|$|E
5|$|By 1907 President Theodore Roosevelt {{more than}} doubled the forest reserve acreage, <b>and</b> <b>Congress</b> responded by {{limiting}} the President’s ability to proclaim new reserves. The National Forest System underwent a major reorganization in 1908, and in 1911 Congress authorized new additions to the system {{under the authority of}} the Weeks Act. The management goals provided by the Organic Act were expanded upon by the Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960 to include “outdoor recreation, range, timber, watershed, and wildlife and fish purposes” {{as well as for the}} establishment of wilderness areas.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to files}} {{recovered}} by Fisher in London (and made public by the president), the American public <b>and</b> <b>Congress</b> both believe that Iran is funding the Blacklist, and The United States and Iran are headed towards war. Looking for more solid proof of Iran's involvement, Fisher infiltrates Quds Force headquarters in Tehran(previously a U.S embassy). Inside, he discovers that Iran {{has nothing to}} do with the Blacklist, and that the files he recovered were planted by The Engineers in order to lure The United States into a war. Fisher narrowly escapes Tehran by using a Predator Drone to blow up the Iranian vehicles chasing him, causing an international incident.|$|E

5|$|Duhalde {{resigned}} {{as vice president}} and was elected Governor of Buenos Aires Province in 1991, and re-elected in 1995. He ran for president in 1999, being defeated by Fernando de la Rúa. De la Rúa resigned during the December 2001 riots, <b>and</b> <b>Congress</b> appointed the governor of San Luis Province Adolfo Rodríguez Saá as president. When Rodríguez Saá also resigned, Congress appointed Duhalde. During Duhalde's term in office, a huge currency devaluation and an increase of the exchange rate led to a gradual recovery. He successfully supported the obscure candidate Néstor Kirchner against Menem, who sought a new presidential term. Duhalde had political disputes with Kirchner in later years, and is largely retired from politics since his defeat in the 2011 presidential elections.|$|E
5|$|Frank E. Holman, {{president}} of the American Bar Association (ABA), called attention to Federal court decisions, notably Missouri v. Holland, which he claimed could give international treaties and agreements precedence over the United States Constitution and {{could be used by}} foreigners to threaten American liberties. Senator Bricker was influenced by the ABA's work and first introduced a constitutional amendment in 1951. With substantial popular support and the election of a Republican president <b>and</b> <b>Congress</b> in the elections of 1952, together with support from many Southern Democrats, Bricker's plan seemed destined to be sent to the individual states for ratification.|$|E
5|$|Grant's Civil Service Commission {{had limited}} success. Some cabinet members {{implemented}} a merit system that {{increased the number}} of qualified candidates and relied less on Congressional patronage. Delano, however, exempted his department from competitive examinations, <b>and</b> <b>Congress</b> refused to enact permanent Civil Service reform. Zachariah Chandler, who succeeded Delano in 1875, reformed the Interior Department and fired corrupt clerks in the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The same year, Grant fired Attorney General George Henry Williams after his wife was discovered to be involved in a bribery scandal, and appointed reformer Edwards Pierrepont in his place. Grant suggested other reforms as well, including a proposal that states should offer free public schooling to all children; he also endorsed the Blaine Amendment, which would have forbidden government aid to schools with religious affiliations.|$|E
