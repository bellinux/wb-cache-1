40|$|It {{is known}} that during sex differentiation, fetal androgens are {{critical}} determinants of the male phenotype. Although testosterone is necessary for normal development of male sexual behavior, perinatal androgen treatment can result in disruption of normal male sexual reproduction. Pregnant Wistar rats were administered either corn oil (vehicle) or testosterone propionate at 0. 2 mg/kg from gestational day 12 {{until the end of}} lactation and the reproductive function of male off spring was evaluated at 90 (adulthood) and 270 (middle <b>age)</b> <b>days</b> of age. Perinatal androgenization in the rat provoked a reduction in sperm production and reserves in adulthood that did not affect fertility and did not persist at more advanced ages, as shown by the results at post-natal day 270.

40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} {{the differences between}} acoustic trauma (AT) {{and other types of}} acute noise-induced hearing loss (ANIHL), we performed a literature search and case reviews. Methods: The literature search based on online databases was completed in September 2016. Articles on ANIHL and steroid treatment for human subjects were reviewed. The source sounds and treatment sequelae of our accumulated cases were also reviewed. Hearing loss caused by gun-shots and explosions was categorized into the AT group, while hearing loss caused by concerts and other noises was categorized into the ANIHL group. Results: Systemic steroid treatment {{did not appear to be}} effective, at least in the AT group, based on both the literature and our case reviews. However, effective recovery after treatment including steroids was observed in the ANIHL group. The difference in hearing recovery between the AT and ANIHL groups was statistically significant (p[*]=[*]. 030), although differences in <b>age,</b> <b>days</b> from the onset to treatment and pretreatment hearing levels were not significant. Conclusions: Hearing recovery from AT is very poor, whereas, ANIHL is recoverable to some extent.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Previously, we {{have shown}} that adult {{offspring}} from hypertensive rabbits develop hypertension. METHOD: We aimed {{to determine the effects}} of mild (+ 15 mmHg) and moderate (+ 25 mmHg) increases in maternal blood pressure and plasma renin activity on placental differentiation and expression of components of the renin-angiotensin system and 11 [beta]-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 mRNA in rabbits. Placentas were collected from normotensive (sham), mild (2 -kidney- 1 -cellophane wrapped; 2 K- 1 W) and moderate (2 -kidney- 2 -cellophane wrapped; 2 K- 2 W) hypertensive groups at gestational age of 14, 21 and 28 days. Placental gene expression was quantified by reverse transcriptase-PCR, and morphometry was assessed by videoimage analyses of placental sections. RESULTS: Fetal weight was similar between groups across gestation. In the 2 K- 1 W group at gestational <b>age</b> <b>day</b> 14, fetal-to-placental weight ratio was increased (approximately 34 %) as were volumes of fetal capillaries ([up arrow] 56 %) and maternal blood space at gestational <b>age</b> <b>day</b> 21 ([up arrow] 55 %) compared with sham (all P < 0. 05). In the 2 K- 2 W group, fetal-to-placental weight ratio was increased at gestational <b>age</b> <b>day</b> 21 (approximately 25 %; P < 0. 01) with an accompanying reduction in placental weight, and at gestational <b>age</b> <b>day</b> 28, volume density of fetal capillaries was increased (approximately 22 %; P < 0. 05). Placental renin mRNA was lower in both the 2 K- 1 W (approximately 88 %) and 2 K- 2 W (approximately 98 %) groups at gestational <b>age</b> <b>day</b> 28 (all P < 0. 01). Placental 11 [beta]-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 mRNA was lower in the 2 K- 1 W (approximately 36 %) and 2 K- 2 W (approximately 31 %) groups at gestational <b>age</b> <b>day</b> 14 and greater (approximately 36 %) in the 2 K- 2 W group at gestational <b>age</b> <b>day</b> 21 (all P < 0. 01). Associations between placental AT 1 R and AT 2 R mRNA and placental differentiation were disturbed by hypertension. CONCLUSION: Mild and moderate maternal hypertension differentially alters placental structure and gene expression that may affect placental functional capacity and contribute to programming of hypertension in offspring.

40|$|Mammalian {{germ cell}} {{apoptosis}} {{plays a key}} role in controlling the correct number of germ cells supported by Sertoli cells during the first wave of spermatogenesis in mammalian puberty. However, little is known about hormonal factors that could influence the rate of germ cell apoptosis during puberty or adulthood. In this work we evaluate germ cell apoptosis under hypothyroidism induced by goitrogen propylthiouracil (PTU) during the first wave of spermatogenesis. Neonatally administered PTU promoted a delay in the differentiation of Sertoli cells as evaluated by the expression of clusterin using immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR. Clusterin had different expression levels in control and PTU-treated animals, but under both conditions the highest levels were found in 35 -day-old rats. In addition, clusterin displayed a cytoplasmic localization in control testes, but appeared located in the nucleus in PTU-treated animals. The wave of apoptosis (determined by caspase activity and quantification of apoptotic cells) characteristic of the first round of spermatogenesis was delayed by at least 10 days in these animals. The expression levels of proapoptotic genes like BAX or BAD were different between control and PTU-treated rats; although in both groups the highest level was found at the same <b>age</b> (<b>days).</b> Thus our results indicate that the characteristic pubertal apoptotic wave during rat spermatogenesis is delayed in neonatal hypothyroid rats...|$|E

The tests include the diamond bit coring with DPM in cement grout blocks and the conventional uniaxial compression tests on the cylindrical grout cores at the aging time from 3 to 25 days. The preliminary test results clearly demonstrate that the grout coring penetration rates decrease and the grout uniaxial compressive strengths increase with the <b>aging</b> <b>days</b> of the cement grout specimens and that {{the values of the}} grout coring penetration rates at any <b>aging</b> <b>days</b> have less variations than those of the grout uniaxial compressive strength. These initial findings may indicate that the coring with DPM has the potential to become a tool for in-situ measurement of the mechanical properties and strength of geomaterials including rock and concrete. Finally, the specific energy during grout drilling is studied to correlate with the grout uniaxial compressive strength. An alternative way to measure the specific energy is proposed and will be further studied. © 2008 Taylor & Francis Group. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
