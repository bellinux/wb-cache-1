5|$|The corona is {{the next}} layer of the Sun. The low corona, near {{the surface of the}} Sun, has a {{particle}} density around 1015m−3 to 1016m−3. The <b>average</b> <b>temperature</b> of the corona and solar wind is about 1,000,000–2,000,000 K; however, in the hottest regions it is 8,000,000–20,000,000 K. Although no complete theory yet exists to account for the temperature of the corona, at least some of its heat is known to be from magnetic reconnection.|$|E

5|$|A new viticultural area {{along the}} Snake River was {{established}} on April 9, 2007. Principally located in Idaho, the area also encompasses two large counties in Eastern Oregon, Baker County and Malheur County. The region's climate is unique among AVAs in Oregon; the <b>average</b> <b>temperature</b> is relatively cool and rainfall is low, creating a shorter growing season. Current production {{is led by}} hardy grapes such as Riesling, Gewürztraminer, and Chardonnay. The climate also lends itself extremely well {{to the production of}} ice wine. However, the AVA is quite large and warmer microclimates within the area can also support different types of grapes such as Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot.|$|E
5|$|Climate models use {{quantitative}} methods {{to simulate the}} interactions of the atmosphere, oceans, land surface and ice. They are used {{for a variety of}} purposes; from the study of the dynamics of the weather and climate system, to projections of future climate. All climate models balance, or very nearly balance, incoming energy as short wave (including visible) electromagnetic radiation to the earth with outgoing energy as long wave (infrared) electromagnetic radiation from the earth. Any imbalance results in a change in the <b>average</b> <b>temperature</b> of the earth.|$|E
5|$|Devised by the American {{climatologist}} and geographer C. W. Thornthwaite, {{this climate}} classification method monitors the soil water budget using evapotranspiration. It monitors {{the portion of}} total precipitation used to nourish vegetation over a certain area. It uses indices such as a humidity index and an aridity index to determine an area's moisture regime based upon its <b>average</b> <b>temperature,</b> average rainfall, and average vegetation type. The lower {{the value of the}} index in any given area, the drier the area is.|$|E

5|$|El Hatillo, at {{a higher}} {{altitude}} than the neighboring municipalities of Caracas, has slightly cooler weather than nearby downtown Caracas. The <b>average</b> <b>temperature</b> is between 21 and 24 degrees Celsius (70–75°F). At the highest elevations, the temperature can decrease to 18°C (64°F) and the atmosphere may have constant fog. The mean precipitation is 997.3millimeters a year (39inches); annual values can range from 800 to 1,500millimeters (32in to 59in). The average humidity index is 75%; similar {{to the rest of}} Venezuela, the rainy season is May through November, while all other months are considered the dry season. The winds are north alizé trade winds.|$|E
5|$|Inside a cold cyclone, 500hPa {{temperatures}} {{can fall}} {{as low as}} , which can initiate convection even in the driest atmospheres. This also explains why moisture in the mid-levels of the troposphere, roughly at the 500hPa level, is normally a requirement for development. However, when dry air is found at the same height, temperatures at 500hPa need to be even colder as dry atmospheres require a greater lapse rate for instability than moist atmospheres. At heights near the tropopause, the 30-year <b>average</b> <b>temperature</b> (as measured in the period encompassing 1961 through 1990) was −77°C (−132°F). A recent example of a tropical cyclone that maintained itself over cooler waters was Epsilon of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season.|$|E
5|$|The {{climate of}} Strandzha is {{influenced}} by the proximity of the Black, Marmara and Aegean seas which clearly distinguishes the local climate from that of the rest of Bulgaria. The region is among the warmest in the country with temperatures rarely falling below 0°C in winter and rising above 24°C in summer due to the cooling effect of the Black Sea. The <b>average</b> <b>temperature</b> drops with the rising elevation in the interior which creates conditions for more frequent and longer-lasting mists, heavier snowfall and earlier frosts. In winter frequent fogs lead to hard rime and the icing of the forests at altitudes above 50.|$|E

5|$|The {{continuous}} {{shadows in}} the south polar craters cause the floors of these formations to maintain a temperature that never exceeds about 100K. For Shackleton, the <b>average</b> <b>temperature</b> {{was determined to be}} about 90K, reaching 88K at the crater floor. Under these conditions, the estimated rate of loss from any ice in the interior would be 10−26 to 10−27m/s. Any water vapor that arrives here following a cometary impact on the Moon would lie permanently frozen on or below the surface. However, the surface albedo of the crater floor matches the lunar far-side, suggesting that there is no exposed surface ice.|$|E
5|$|Under a cold cyclone, 500hPa {{temperatures}} {{can fall}} {{as low as}} −30°C, which can initiate convection even in the driest atmospheres.

5|$|Alternatively, if {{the density}} in the {{universe}} were equal to or below the critical density, the expansion would slow down but never stop. Star formation would cease with the consumption of interstellar gas in each galaxy; stars would burn out, leaving white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. Very gradually, collisions between these would result in mass accumulating into larger and larger black holes. The <b>average</b> <b>temperature</b> of the universe would asymptotically approach absolute zero—a Big Freeze. Moreover, if the proton were unstable, then baryonic matter would disappear, leaving only radiation and black holes. Eventually, black holes would evaporate by emitting Hawking radiation. The entropy of the universe would increase {{to the point where}} no organized form of energy could be extracted from it, a scenario known as heat death.|$|E

5|$|In cool {{temperate}} regions, conifers often predominate; {{a widely}} distributed climax {{community in the}} far north of the northern hemisphere is moist taiga or northern coniferous forest (also called boreal forest). Taiga is the world's largest land biome, forming 29% of the world's forest cover. The long cold winter of the far north is unsuitable for plant growth and trees must grow rapidly in the short summer season when the temperature rises and the days are long. Light is very limited under their dense cover {{and there may be}} little plant life on the forest floor, although fungi may abound. Similar woodland is found on mountains where the altitude causes the <b>average</b> <b>temperature</b> to be lower thus reducing the length of the growing season.|$|E
5|$|Prior to kickoff of the 2005game, {{the stadium}} {{announcer}} made an appeal for donations {{to help those}} suffering {{in the aftermath of}} Hurricane Katrina, which devastated parts of Louisiana fivedays previously. Donations were not accepted at the game because of a policy against official fund-raising. As the Longhorns entered the field, special teams player Karim Meijer carried a United States flag that was given to the team on Thursday by former Longhorn Nathan Kaspar who flew the flag during missions in southeastern Iraq. For this game only, the Longhorns wore throwback uniforms furnished by Nike as a way of honoring the past. The throwback jerseys were similar to jerseys worn during their 1963National Championship season under Coach Darrell K. Royal. Football's origins in the Northeastern United States have created an expectation that it is a cold-weather sport, but the temperature at kickoff was 90°F (32°C) which is also the <b>average</b> <b>temperature</b> in Austin for the month of September.|$|E
5|$|Solar {{radiation}} is {{absorbed by the}} Earth's land surface, oceans – which cover about 71% of the globe – and atmosphere. Warm air containing evaporated water from the oceans rises, causing atmospheric circulation or convection. When the air reaches a high altitude, where the temperature is low, water vapor condenses into clouds, which rain onto the Earth's surface, completing the water cycle. The latent heat of water condensation amplifies convection, producing atmospheric phenomena such as wind, cyclones and anti-cyclones. Sunlight absorbed by the oceans and land masses keeps the surface at an <b>average</b> <b>temperature</b> of 14°C. By photosynthesis, green plants convert solar energy into chemically stored energy, which produces food, wood and the biomass from which fossil fuels are derived.|$|E
