Our {{objective was to}} quantify the contribution of individual management practices to reduce wheat yield gaps (YG) economically. An incomplete factorial treatment structure established in a randomized complete block design with six replications {{was used to evaluate}} 14 treatments during two years in Manhattan, Belleville, and Hutchinson Kansas. Sites were combined based on tillage practice, growing region in Kansas, and <b>disease</b> <b>pressure.</b> Thus, Manhattan had low <b>disease</b> <b>pressure,</b> was no-tilled, and in eastern Kansas for 2015 - 16 and 2016 - 17 (two site years). Meanwhile, Belleville and Hutchinson had high <b>disease</b> <b>pressure,</b> were conventionally tilled, and in central Kansas for 2015 - 16 and 2016 - 17 (four site years). We individually added six treatments to a farmer’s practice control (FP) or removed from a water-limited yield control (Yw), which received all treatments. Practices were additional split-nitrogen (N), sulfur (S), chloride (Cl), increased plant population, foliar fungicide, and plant growth regulator (PGR). Percent YG was calculated by block and site-year using the Yw as reference for potential yield. Orthogonal contrasts indicated yield under no-till which had low <b>disease</b> <b>pressure</b> increased from the FP by the full Yw (+ 0. 37 Mg ha- 1), but also by the individual practices split-N (+ 0. 28 Mg ha- 1), S (+ 0. 26 Mg ha- 1), increased plant population (+ 0. 36 Mg ha- 1), and fungicide (+ 0. 18 Mg ha- 1). In the conventional till which had high <b>disease</b> <b>pressure,</b> wheat yield was increased by 1. 18 Mg ha- 1 from the Yw and by 1. 44 Mg ha- 1 from the fungicide. The Yw and split-N increased grain protein concentration in no-till and conventional-till on average by 9 g kg- 1 and 12 g kg- 1, respectively. Across all inputs, orthogonal contrasts indicated that the FP yield gap was 8 % in no-till which had low <b>disease</b> <b>pressure.</b> Likewise, the orthogonal contrasts indicated that across individual treatments the YG was reduced by split-N (6 %), S (5 %), Cl (3 %), increased plant population (8 %), and fungicide (4 %).

In field experiments, under low (40 sclerotia/kg of soil) and high (600 sclerotia/kg of soil) inoculum density, the standard fungicide programme (garlic cloves dipped in tebuconazole plus foliar spray) gave statistically significant disease control compared with the untreated control. Under low <b>disease</b> <b>pressure,</b> significant control, equal to the fungicide treatment, was achieved with the combination of the three Trichoderma spp. biocontrol agents.

With expanded adoption of site-specific management and other precision agriculture approaches, cotton producers are increasingly interested in predicting seedling <b>disease</b> <b>pressure,</b> particularly in spatially variable fields. The cotton seedling disease pathogens include the soilborne pathogens Thielaviopsis basicola, Rhizoctonia solani, Pythium spp., and Fusarium spp. These pathogens can survive in soil for long periods and, and when the environment is conducive, these pathogens can act individually or in combination to cause a range of symptoms on seed, roots and hypocotyls, which can affect germination, emergence, and early-season growth and development of plants.

50|$|Cultural Controls Raising the mowing {{height is}} {{an easy way to}} reduce stress on a turfgrass plant and make the plant less {{susceptible}} to attack by disease, but there is a fine line. Turf mowed, less than 2.5 inches and above 3 inches makes the plant more susceptible to disease. Managing the moisture available to the plant is another way to help reduce the incidence of disease. The pathogen that causes Microdochium Patch requires and thrives in moist, cool conditions, therefore making sure that you aren't overwatering the turf when conditions are right for infection is very important. Giving the plant only enough water for normal plant function {{is the best way to}} ensure <b>disease</b> <b>pressure</b> is reduced as much as possible. Also, starving the turf of moisture can be damaging as this increases susceptibility to infection. Managing the amount of nitrogen available to the plant is another key to decreasing incidence of this disease. Avoiding excess fall nitrogen application will greatly reduce <b>disease</b> <b>pressure</b> of Microdochium nivale. On top of that excess nitrogen available to plant produces rapid growth of above ground tissue. This tissue often has thin cell walls and is prone to attack by disease. Managing thatch and soil drainage are two other important ways of controlling this disease as both of these affect the amount of moisture that is available to create a favorable environment to the disease, giving the plant only enough water for normal plant function is the best way to ensure <b>disease</b> <b>pressure</b> is reduced as much as possible. Despite the fact that the above cultural controls cannot completely control Microdochium Patch, when they are all used to reduce <b>disease</b> <b>pressure,</b> they can have a noticeable impact and will help to reduce the amount of chemical control that is required.|$|R
40|$|Variation in {{immune defence}} in birds is often {{explained}} either by external {{factors such as}} food availability and <b>disease</b> <b>pressure</b> or by internal factors such as moult and reproductive effort. We explored these factors together in one sampling design by measuring immune activity over the time frame of the moulting period of Arctic breeding barnacle geese (Branta leucopsis). We assessed baseline innate immunity by measuring levels of complement-mediated lysis and natural antibodymediated agglutination together with total and differential leukocyte counts. Variation in immune activity during moult was strongly associated with calendar date and to a smaller degree with the growth stage of wing feathers. We suggest that the association with calendar date reflected temporal changes in the external environment. This environmental factor was further explored by comparing the immune activity of geese in the Arctic population with conspecifics in the temperate climate zone at comparable moult stages. In the Arctic environment, which has a lower expected disease load, geese exhibited significantly lower values of complement-mediated lysis, their blood contained fewer leukocytes, and levels of phagocytic cells and reactive leukocytes were relatively low. This suggests that lower baseline immune activity could be associated with lower <b>disease</b> <b>pressure.</b> We conclude that in our study species, external factors such as food availability and <b>disease</b> <b>pressure</b> have a greater effect on temporal variation of baseline immune activity than internal factors such as moult stage...|$|R

B. Ash Abstract: Entomosporium leaf and berry spot, which {{is caused by the}} fungal pathogen Entomosporium mespili, can cause up to 100 % yield loss in Amelanchier alnifolia (saskatoon) in years when weather conditions are conducive to disease development. In an effort to optimize the effectiveness and minimize the use of fungicides, a dynamic diseaseforecasting model was developed. The model uses a <b>disease</b> <b>pressure</b> index equation, which integrates information regarding the phenological {{development of}} saskatoon, the relationship of disease to inoculum potential and production, leaf-wetness duration and temperature, inoculum release, and host susceptibility, to provide an estimate of <b>disease</b> <b>pressure.</b> When the model was evaluated, a strong correlation was found between predicted <b>disease</b> <b>pressure</b> and observed <b>disease</b> symptom development. After the field data were combined, the model could account for 82 % of the variation in the increase of mean lesion number per leaf observed during the preharvest period.

In addition, {{we were able to}} detect consistent and significant resistance differences among the common varieties both under high <b>disease</b> <b>pressure</b> (2007) and low <b>disease</b> <b>pressure</b> (2008). The accumulation of DON was not related to the {{presence of}} F. graminearum but showed a clear correlation with rainfall during and after the period of anthesis.

This study was conducted to in-vestigate the effect of blast disease (Pyricularia oryzae Cav.) on nitrogen accumulation and remobilization to grain of rice plants (Oryza sativa L.), and to assess the possible nitrogen losses occurring between anthesis and maturity in response to disease stress in the field. Four rice cultivars with various levels of susceptibility to blast disease were grown in 2003 and 2004 under high and low <b>disease</b> <b>pressure,</b> achieved by early inoculation with the blast fungus and by natural infection, respectively. Inocu-lation affected the overall nitrogen metabolism of rice plants and in most cases the effect was proportional to <b>disease</b> <b>pressure.</b> High <b>disease</b> <b>pressure</b> increased the tis-sue nitrogen concentration and the total nitrogen con-tent, but decreased the proportion of aboveground nitro-gen that was partitioned to the grain. Post anthesis nitro-gen accumulation was lower in inoculated plants, and therefore, their grain filling depended more on the exist-ing nitrogen reserves stored in vegetative parts compared to the non-inoculated plants. Nitrogen translocation was higher in inoculated than non-inoculated plants, mainly due to the greater amount of translocation available ni-trogen rather than to the higher efficiency of nitrogen translocation. The great amount of nitrogen accumulated until anthesis by the inoculated plants, in combination with the low grain demands for nitrogen, due to their lower grain yield, resulted in higher nitrogen losses be-tween anthesis and maturity...|$|R
