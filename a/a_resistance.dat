On 22 June 1941, the 1st Sisak Partisan Detachment {{was formed}} near Sisak, {{as the first}} military unit formed by <b>a</b> <b>resistance</b> movement in occupied Europe. This sparked {{the beginning of the}} Yugoslav Partisan movement, a communist multi-ethnic anti-fascist resistance group led by Josip Broz Tito. The movement grew rapidly and at the Tehran Conference in December 1943 the Partisans gained recognition from the Allies.|$|E

40|$|Adiponectin (Ad) is an insulin-sensitizing adipokine, {{attributable}} {{in part to}} {{its ability}} to stimulate skeletal muscle fatty acid (FA) oxidation and prevent intramuscular lipid accumulation and associated lipotoxicity. In established cases of obesity and insulin resistance (IR), resistance to this insulin-sensitizing adipokine has been shown. However, whether a high fat diet, a known contributor to obesity and IR can induce <b>Ad</b> <b>resistance</b> is unknown. Furthermore, whether the type of fat in the diet influences the development of <b>Ad</b> <b>resistance</b> and whether this resistance precedes and contributes {{to the development of}} IR is unknown. Finally, the cause of <b>Ad</b> <b>resistance</b> is unknown. It was hypothesized that a high fat diet would induce skeletal muscle <b>Ad</b> <b>resistance</b> by triggering inflammation and this would occur prior to the onset and development of IR. It was also hypothesized that a diet high in saturated fat (SAT) would cause faster changes than a diet high in polyunsaturated fat (PUFA). From the work presented herein, several novel findings have been made. Importantly, skeletal muscle <b>Ad</b> <b>resistance</b> can be induced by high fat feeding in rats. This resistance is defined as an inability of globular adiponectin (gAd) to acutel...|$|R

Around 300 separate resistance networks existed which often included both male and female members.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} part of the crew's schedule was regular exercise. They had three pieces of equipment for this: a stationary bicycle, a treadmill (TVIS), and <b>a</b> <b>resistance</b> device (IRED) for weight-lifting. The bicycle malfunctioned in mid-December 2000, and wasn't fixed until March. The treadmill, which used bungee cords to keep the crew member in place, was designed to reduce the vibrations caused by running. A normal treadmill would have produced enough vibrations to shake the station, and potentially affect the sensitive science experiments on board. The treadmill malfunctioned near the end of February, but some in-flight maintenance fixed the problem within a week.|$|E

In this paper, we present and analyse two approaches to operationalizing textiles in architecture. In our analysis, we focus on how differences in operational design expose different kinds of resistance in textiles. Anna Vallgårda and Cecilie Bendixen define <b>a</b> material’s <b>resistance</b> as what gives us access to knowledge about it (2009). We {{argue that it is}} fruitful to compare these two approaches in order to shed light on how to produce sufficient and suitable resistance when operationalizing textiles.

50|$|These {{processes}} produce entropy (see entropy production) at {{a certain}} rate. The entropy production rate times ambient temperature gives the dissipated power.

50|$|This is in {{contrast}} to an ordinary resistor in which an increase of applied voltage causes a proportional increase in current due to Ohm's law, resulting in <b>a</b> positive <b>resistance.</b> While <b>a</b> positive <b>resistance</b> consumes power from current passing through it, <b>a</b> negative <b>resistance</b> produces power.

40|$|Pantoea sp. IMH is {{the only}} {{bacterium}} found in genus Pantoea with <b>a</b> high <b>As</b> <b>resistance</b> capacity, but its molecular mechanism is unknown. Herein, the organization, function, and evolution of ars genes in IMH are studied starting with analysis of the whole genome. Two ars systems - ars 1 (arsR 1 B 1 C 1 H 1) and ars 2 (arsR 2 B 2 C 2 H 2) -with low sequence homology and two arsC-like genes, {{were found in the}} IMH genome. Both ars 1 and ars 2 are involved in the <b>As</b> <b>resistance,</b> where ars 1 is the major contributor at 15 degrees C and ars 2 at 30 degrees C. The difference in the behavior of these two ars systems is attributed to the disparate activities of their arsR promoters at different temperatures. Sequence analysis based on concatenated ArsRBC indicates that ars 1 and ars 2 clusters may be acquired from Franconibacter helveticus LMG 23732 and Serratia marcescens (plasmid R 478), respectively, by horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Nevertheless, two arsC-like genes, probably arising from the duplication of arsC, do not contribute to the <b>As</b> <b>resistance.</b> Our results indicate that Pantoea sp. IMH acquired two different <b>As</b> <b>resistance</b> genetic systems by HGT, allowing the colonization of changing ecosystems, and highlighting the flexible adaptation of microorganisms to resist As...|$|R

5|$|Different tammar {{populations have}} {{varying levels of}} {{resistance}} to sodium fluoroacetate. Mainland Western tammars {{appear to be the}} most resistant, while those on Kangaroo Island are much more vulnerable. Tammars from New Zealand are also vulnerable, as the poison has been successfully used to control their populations. Tammars from East and West Wallabi Islands and Garden Island, which do not have plants containing sodium fluoroacetate, are less resistant than mainland Western tammars but are more resistant than those from Kangaroo Island. This suggests that tammars originated in South Australia and developed <b>a</b> <b>resistance</b> to sodium fluoroacetate when they reached Western Australia, where the poison is found in plants.|$|E
