Standard approaches use a distance criterion based on the EDF, an aggregation of di¤erences in observed and theoretical cumulative frequencies. However, an economic approach to the problem should involve a measure of the information loss from using a badly-tting model. This would involve an aggregation of, for example, individual income discrepancies between model and data.

30|$|It {{should be}} {{highlighted}} that, unlike the shared self-driving cars, AGVs usually {{move on the}} visual track-based networks with specially required path topologies and two AGVs may conflict on the interactions of their paths [32] where the paths of AGVs are planned in advance to avoid all kinds of obstacles [33, 34].

40|$|Behavioral ecologists have {{recently}} begun using multilevel modeling {{for the analysis}} of social behavior. We present a multilevel modeling formulation of the Social Relations Model that is well suited {{for the analysis of}} dyadic network data. This model, which we adapt for count data and small datasets, can be fitted using standard multilevel modeling software packages. We illustrate this model with an analysis of meal sharing among Ye’kwana horticulturalists in Venezuela. In this setting, meal sharing among households is predicted by an association index, which reflects {{the amount of time that}} members of the households are interacting. This result replicates recent findings that interhousehold food sharing is especially prevalent among households that interact and cooperate in multiple ways. We discuss opportunities for human behavioral ecologists to expand their focus to the multiple currencies and cooperative behaviors that characterize interpersonal relationships in preindustrial societies.

40|$|This {{article is}} {{concerned}} with the approximation of the critical buckling factor for thin composite plates. A new method to improve the approximation of this critical factor is applied based on its behavior with respect to lamination parameters and loading conditions. This method allows accurate approximation of the critical buckling factor for non-orthotropic laminates under complex combined loadings (including shear loading). The influence of the stacking sequence and loading conditions is extensively studied as well as properties of the critical buckling factor behavior (e. g concavity over tensor D or out-of-plane lamination parameters). Moreover, the critical buckling factor is numerically shown to be piecewise linear for orthotropic laminates under combined loading whenever shear remains low and it is also shown to be piecewise continuous in the general case. Based on the numerically observed behavior, a new scheme for the approximation is applied that separates each buckling mode and builds linear, polynomial or rational regressions for each mode. Results of this <b>approach</b> <b>and</b> <b>applications</b> to structural optimization are presented. ...|$|E

40|$|Living labs are an {{increasingly}} popular methodology to enhance innovation. Living labs aim to span boundaries between different organizations, among others Triple helix actors, by {{acting as a}} network organization typically in a real-life environment to foster co-creation by user-groups. This paper presents critical factors of Living labs in boundary-spanning between Triple Helix actors. Derived from a mixed-method <b>approach</b> <b>and</b> <b>applications</b> in the healthcare sector, the three main critical factors {{turn out to be}} 1) an adequate user-group selection and involvement, specifically a rich interaction and absorption of its results, 2) a balanced involvement of all relevant actors, and 3) a sufficient (early) attention for values, both values of user-groups and values of the management. People-oriented Living labs tend to differ from institution-oriented Living labs regarding these critical factors. Further, universities tend to take on diverse roles and strength of involvement, while the business sector tends to be actively involved only if this has been set as an explicit aim at start.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This article {{presents}} analysis <b>approach</b> <b>and</b> <b>applications</b> of symmetrical three-conductor coupled microstriplines with aperture {{in the ground}} plane {{for the design of}} microwave filters. Analysis is based on splitting the entire symmetrical three-conductor coupled line struc-ture into simple two-conductor coupled lines. Various possible termina-tions have been shown in three-conductor coupled lines to derive a class of structures for the construction of filters. These coupled line structures are analyzed based on even- and odd-mode propagation characteristics to design filters in this article. An experimental cascaded three-conductor coupled line band stop filter with defected ground has been designed using the method of circuit model analysis. Defected ground has been used under the coupled lines to widen the filter’s bandwidth. Measured results of the designed band stop filter have been compared against the circuit model analysis for the purpose of validation. Results are in good agreement between them.

40|$|Painting {{process is}} {{critical}} in the manufacturing process of commercial vehicle to provide both protection and decorative elements. Good quality coating is important to reduce cost and concurrently achieve customer satisfaction. A systematic <b>approach</b> <b>and</b> <b>applications</b> of the basics and advanced management tools and techniques are used {{to improve the quality}} of the coated body. One of the proposed approach is to utilise the PDCA-cycle to reduce the defects on the electrodeposited body. In this study, the bits defect on the electrodeposited automobile bodies is investigated. Within the multilayer coating on bodies, the iron filing leads to the bits defect that appears on the electrodeposited coating surface. The iron filings arised from the metal assembly process carried out in the bodyshop, remained on the body during the painting process in paint shop. The defected surface can be removed through the process of sanding which is high in cost and requires extensive production time. Therefore, the best method to prevent the bits defects is by removing or reducing the iron filing through filtration, magnetic separation and surface adjustment process. The implementation of filtration system, magnetic separation and surface adjustment process improved 36 % of bits and reduced 42 % of sanding man hour with a total saving of RM 40. 00 per unit...|$|E

By combining PC with VR technology and telecommunications, {{the stage is set}} {{for the creation of a}} new type of ready-to-wear PC. Although wearable computers are merely concepts, it is now time to begin integrating ergonomics into wearable computer design. The key to design such new products is the inclusion of ergonomics at various stages throughout the design process, beginning at a very early stage. Therefore, this paper describes a wearable computer design through an ergonomic approach to ensure an appropriate interface relationship between the computer and the user. The methodology by which design problems were analyzed and solutions were developed will be described in this paper, as well as some of the engineering features that made the final design possible.
