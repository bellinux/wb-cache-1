5|$|The crests and frills of some dinosaurs, {{like the}} marginocephalians, theropods and lambeosaurines, {{may have been}} too fragile to be used for active defense, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> likely used for sexual or {{aggressive}} displays, though little is known about dinosaur mating and territorialism. Head wounds from bites suggest that theropods, at least, engaged in active aggressive confrontations.|$|E
5|$|Richard de Rulos, who was Lord of Deeping Fen {{during the}} reign of William the Conqueror erected a strong {{embankment}} to prevent flooding of the meadows adjoining the river, which then became fertile fields and a pleasure garden. During the reign of Henry III (1207–1272), complaints were made that of the two channels below Crowland, the one to Spalding was more favourable to the passage of barges, but the Abbot of Crowland had obstructed and narrowed its course by planting willow trees. In the fourteenth century, Spalding was charged with failing to scour and repair the river, causing damage to the king's liege people, but argued that because it was tidal at this point, it was an arm of the sea, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> not responsible.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with those}} trivial messages, gandingans {{were also used}} in more seriously matters when {{signaling}} to others of imminent danger. During martial law, gandingans were used to warn villagers of incoming Marcos’ soldiers. Every time the villagers received the signal, they would disappear leaving the soldiers aloof until the soldiers themselves brought in a translator who told them, the gandingan {{was responsible for the}} scurry. So they arrested the gandingan player. A similar story talks about a brother of a man who stole someone’s carabao. In order to keep his brother from getting arrested, the brother set up a gandingan up in a tree and would clang it every time the police arrived to warn his brother to leave their house. But like Marcos’ soldiers, the police bought a translator <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> finally able to arrest the theft for stealing and the brother on the gandingan for obstruction of justice.|$|E

5|$|Hastings {{left the}} failed mining {{operation}} in 1899, and travelled to London. Just after he arrived, the Second Boer War broke out, and the British government called for volunteers to join an expeditionary force. The only qualifications required {{were that the}} recruit could ride and shoot, and Hastings immediately applied to join the Suffolk Imperial Yeomanry. He was accepted, and {{after two weeks of}} training the regiment were given horses and boarded the S.S. Goth Castle to South Africa. The ship reached Cape Town after three weeks, and the regiment disembarked. Their horses were considered too weak to be ridden, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> instead discharged and either put down or given to other soldiers. Hastings did not enjoy his time in the army; the weather was poor, the orders given were confusing and they were provided with minimal equipment.|$|E
5|$|In June 1912, the Greek Navy {{selected}} tenders from Germany's AG Vulcan for two destroyers and six torpedo boats, to {{be completed}} in just three to four months. This exceptionally short timeframe was accomplished through the help of the German Navy, which allowed the Greeks to take over German ships then being constructed. The contract price was evidently low, as one British firm complained that they could not understand how Vulcan would make a profit. Then, one month later, the Greeks selected Vulcan again for the construction of their battlecruiser, with its armor and armament coming from Bethlehem Steel in the United States. British firms were furious, again alleging that it would be impossible for Vulcan to make a profit on the contract, and surmising that the German government was subsidizing the purchase to get a foothold in the shipbuilding market. The Greeks, for their part, countered that the British manufacturers were colluding to keep armor plate prices high, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> able to significantly decrease their costs by ordering the ship's armor in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The 1922 Washington Naval Treaty cut the {{battleship}} {{strength of the}} Royal Navy from forty ships to fifteen. The remaining active battleships were divided between the Atlantic and Mediterranean Fleets and conducted joint operations annually. Royal Sovereign remained with the Atlantic Fleet through 1926. On 4 October 1927, the ship was placed in reserve to effect a major refit. Four new rangefinders and eight searchlights were installed. On 15 May 1929, the refit was finished, and the ship {{was assigned to the}} 1st Battle Squadron of the Mediterranean Fleet. The squadron consisted of Royal Sovereign, her sisters Resolution and , and , and based in Malta. By the 1930s, the five ships of the Queen Elizabeth class were rotated through extensive modernisation. Royal Sovereign and her sisters, however, were smaller and slower than the Queen Elizabeth class, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> not extensively modernised in the inter-war period. The only changes made were augmentations to their anti-aircraft batteries.|$|E

5|$|To prevent South Korea's {{collapse}} the United Nations Security Council {{voted to}} send military forces. The United States' Seventh Fleet dispatched Task Force 77, {{led by the}} fleet carrier , and the British Far East Fleet dispatched several ships, including , to provide air and naval support. Although the navies blockaded North Korea and launched aircraft to delay the North Korean forces these efforts alone did not stop the North Korean Army juggernaut on its southern advance. U.S. President Harry S. Truman later ordered ground troops into the country to supplement the air support. All U.S. Navy units and ships including Leyte were placed on alert. The ship was in the Mediterranean Sea, and Hudner {{did not expect to}} be deployed to Korea, but on 8 August a relief carrier arrived in the area and Leyte was ordered to Korea. Naval commanders felt the pilots on Leyte were better trained and prepared than those of other available carriers, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> among the first dispatched to the theater. Leyte sailed from the Strait of Gibraltar across the Atlantic Ocean and to Quonset, then through the Panama Canal and San Diego, California, Hawaii, and Japan before arriving in the waters off Korea around 8 October.|$|E

25|$|Hayashida {{expressed}} {{his belief that}} NES Remix should be completely authentic to its vintage roots. To this end, the compilation is based entirely on accurate emulation of the NES's hardware and on the original game software. This includes hardware glitches such as frame rate slowdown when too many characters are on the screen, and software bugs. Hayashida stated that these were intricate parts of the original and directly affect the difficulty <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> not changed. Hayashida also spoke similarly about the controls; {{even if they were}} not considered ideal, he understood that they had been conceived that way for a reason <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> unaltered for NES Remix.|$|E

25|$|Historian Vicente Carcel Orti {{asserts that}} anticlerical Freemasons played {{a large part}} in the anti-Catholic acts of the {{government}} since they held key government positions, including at least 183 deputies in the Cortes (the Spanish parliament) <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> instrumental {{in the making of}} anti-Catholic laws. As early as March 1933, Abilia Arroyo de Roman had declared at a rally in the Salamancan pueblo of Macotera that Spain was governed by Masonic lodges, intent on 'decatholicizing' Spain, and the Gaceta Regional blamed the Law of Congregations on 'an occult power' that had taken refuge in Spain 'to carry out its experiments'.|$|E
25|$|After {{the death}} of his mother, Gregory was placed in the care of his father's friend, Margaret Vernon, Prioress of Little Marlow, in Buckinghamshire. At that time it was not unusual for gentlemen to place their young {{children}} in the care of nuns. As a rule the boys in nunneries were very young as it was not considered appropriate for them to stay with the nuns later than their ninth or tenth year. The nuns were permitted to educate only the girls. It was acceptable for young boys, up to the age of nine or ten, to be supervised by nuns, but not taught by them, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> usually accompanied by a male tutor.|$|E

25|$|However it was {{essential}} that servants were close at hand, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> given their own specific floors, usually the lowest and the highest. These floors were often, as at Belton, distinguished by a different fenestration from the rooms of the employers in between. Hence at Belton can be seen the small windows of the semi-basement containing the kitchens, pantries and servants' dining halls. Above are the large windows lighting the principal rooms, while {{right at the top}} of the house are again the small windows of the servants’ bedrooms. These rooms which were entirely in main block of the house, and constituted distinct servants' quarters, were to be the forerunner of the service wing.|$|E
25|$|The new {{technologies}} introduced by Renault and Lotus became {{entangled in the}} FISA-FOCA war of the early 1980s. Turbo engines were complex machines whose layout limited the ground effect 'tunnels' under the car. They were an emerging technology <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> difficult and expensive to develop and build and make reliable. It was mostly manufacturer-supported teams, such as Renault, Ferrari and Alfa Romeo which took that route. In contrast, the cheap, reliable and narrow Ford-Cosworth DFV engine, still used by most teams {{more than a decade}} after its introduction, lent itself well to highly efficient ground effect aerodynamics. These two groups were represented by two political bodies – the sport's governing body FISA, headed by Jean-Marie Balestre; and FOCA, headed up by Bernie Ecclestone. The first group supported a strict limitation of ground effect to gain full advantage from their powerful turbos while the other relied on unrestricted ground effect to balance their horsepower deficit. There were also financial considerations. Faced with large constructors with unrestricted budgets, the smaller constructors wanted a larger share of Formula One's income to remain competitive.|$|E
25|$|Students {{from each}} house enter into annual {{competitions}} in sport, music and drama versus the other houses, where pupils represent their house. Examples {{of these are}} the house netball, house football, house rugby, house lacrosse, house hockey, house tennis, house rounders, house dance, house choir, house instrumental, and many others. There are also house plays which are written by year 12 students (aged 16 and 17) and performed by year 10 students (aged 14 and 15). The winning house in each competition is awarded {{a certain number of}} points, which are accrued during the academic year. The house with the most points {{at the end of the}} year will win the House Championship. Junior/Senior House Colour Awards, in the form of ties, are awarded at the end of Years 10 and/or 12 to students who excel in a certain field, either academic or extracurricular. The ties are distinct from the normal school tie, consisting solely of the colour of the wearer's house. Girls were once given sashes instead of ties but this practice fell out of favour with the students <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> awarded ties just as their peers were.|$|E
