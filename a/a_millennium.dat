5|$|Harris {{cites the}} success of the {{adaptation}} of The X-Files for providing the impetus for <b>a</b> <b>Millennium</b> comic, noting that IDW editor-in-chief Chris Ryall approached him to write the latter series having seen the reception the former had been receiving. Harris himself had been a fan of the series during its initial broadcast, personally favouring its second season. He also expressed interest in possibly adapting another of Carter's creations, Harsh Realm.|$|E

5|$|Since Raja Sahil Varman, the dynasty ruled without {{successful}} invasion {{for around}} <b>a</b> <b>millennium,</b> until the British gained power.

Later, Mughal emperors Akbar and Aurangzeb did attempt to annex Chamba but were unsuccessful in subjugating this territory into their kingdoms. Raja Prithvi Singh (1641-1664 AD), who was on amiable terms with Emperor Shahjahan was instrumental in introducing the court lifestyles of the Mughals.|$|E

5|$|The great Orcadian Neolithic monuments were {{constructed}} almost <b>a</b> <b>millennium</b> before the sarsen stones of Stonehenge were erected. At one {{time it was}} believed that this flowering of culture was essentially peripheral and that its origins were to be found to the south on mainland Great Britain. However, recently discovered evidence shows that Orkney was the starting place for much of the megalithic culture, including styles of architecture and pottery, that developed much later in the southern British Isles.|$|E
5|$|This civilization flourished at the {{confluence}} of three rivers, the Fortaleza, the Pativilca, and the Supe. These river valleys each have large clusters of sites. Further south, there are several associated sites along the Huaura River. The alternative name, Caral-Supe, {{is derived from the}} city of Caral in the Supe Valley, a large and well-studied Norte Chico site. Complex society in Norte Chico arose <b>a</b> <b>millennium</b> after Sumer in Mesopotamia, was contemporaneous with the Egyptian pyramids, and predated the Mesoamerican Olmec by nearly two millennia.|$|E
5|$|Delta drifted {{slowly and}} erratically southwards {{for several days}} before {{accelerating}} north-eastwards then eastwards towards the Canary Islands and north Africa. During this period, it twice approached hurricane strength, although it never achieved hurricane intensity. On November 28 it merged with a frontal system northwest of the Canaries and became a vigorous extratropical storm. It caused severe damage in the Canary Islands and claimed at least seven lives, including six who drowned while attempting to reach the Canary Islands by boat from Africa. El Dedo de Dios, or God's Finger, a geological feature which had been pointing towards the sky for over <b>a</b> <b>millennium</b> and an important landmark for the Canary Islands, was toppled during the storm. Delta also caused power outages, leaving some 200,000people without power and forcing airports to close down.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the lack}} of written sources on this period, much of Nerva's life has {{remained}} obscure. The most substantial surviving account of the reign of Nerva was written by the 3rd-century historian Cassius Dio. His Roman History, which spans nearly <b>a</b> <b>millennium,</b> from the arrival of Aeneas in Italy until the year 229, was composed more than one hundred years after Nerva had died. Further details are added by an abridged biography from the Epitome de Caesaribus, a work alleged to have been authored by the 4th-century historian Aurelius Victor.|$|E
5|$|In November 2006, Jolie {{expanded}} {{the scope of}} the project—renamed the Maddox Jolie-Pitt Foundation (MJP)—to create Asia's first Millennium Village, in accordance with UN development goals. She was inspired by a meeting with the founder of Millennium Promise, noted economist Jeffrey Sachs, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, where she was an invited speaker in 2005 and 2006. Together they filmed a 2005 MTV special, The Diary of Angelina Jolie & Dr. Jeffrey Sachs in Africa, which followed them on a trip to <b>a</b> <b>Millennium</b> Village in western Kenya. By mid-2007, some 6,000 villagers and 72 employees—some of them former poachers employed as rangers—lived and worked at MJP, in ten villages previously isolated from one another. The compound includes schools, roads, and a soy milk factory, all funded by Jolie. Her home functions as the MJP field headquarters.|$|E

For over 24hours roads were closed on the islands of El Hierro, Tenerife and La Palma: the first two due to landslides and the third {{by the collapse of}} an old house and a massive tree. One of the most famous geological features of the island of Gran Canaria, El Dedo de Dios (or God's finger), which had been pointing towards the sky for over <b>a</b> <b>millennium,</b> was destroyed by Delta's wind and wave action along Gran Canaria's shore. Upon hearing of the destruction of the natural monument one man, later found to be clinically insane, unsuccessfully tried to kill himself and then stabbed three members of his own family.|$|E

5|$|The Roman Empire conquered Dacia in AD 101 and 106, {{during the}} rule of Trajan, and the Roman {{settlement}} Napoca, established thereafter, is first recorded on a milestone discovered in 1758 {{in the vicinity of}} the city. Trajan's successor Hadrian granted Napoca the status of municipium as municipium Aelium Hadrianum Napocenses. Later, in the 2nd century AD, the city gained the status of a colonia as Colonia Aurelia Napoca. Napoca became a provincial capital of Dacia Porolissensis and thus the seat of a procurator. The colonia was evacuated in 274 by the Romans. There are no references to urban settlement on the site for the better part of <b>a</b> <b>millennium</b> thereafter.|$|E
5|$|The {{structure}} {{has been the}} subject of folklore in the surrounding area for several hundred years and possibly more than <b>a</b> <b>millennium.</b> Its construction was commonly attributed to a giant known as Wade, a figure from Germanic or Norse mythology. In the 1720s the causeway was mentioned in a published text and became known outside the local area. Within a few years it became of interest to antiquarians who visited the site and exchanged commentary on its probable historicity. They interpreted the structure as a causeway across marshy ground, attributing its construction to the Roman military, an explanation largely unchallenged throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.|$|E

5|$|Today {{the site}} of the church, {{including}} {{the upper part of the}} sea defences there, is managed by English Heritage, and the village has all but disappeared. The present appearance of the cliff below the church, a grassy slope above a large stone apron, was the work of central government and was in place by April 1867. In 2000 the surviving fragments of an early medieval cross that once stood inside the old church were used to design <b>a</b> <b>Millennium</b> Cross to commemorate two thousand years of Christianity.

5|$|Wind {{turbines}} are {{devices that}} convert the wind's kinetic energy into electrical power. The result of over <b>a</b> <b>millennium</b> of windmill development and modern engineering, today's wind turbines are manufactured {{in a wide}} range of horizontal axis and vertical axis types. The smallest turbines are used for applications such as battery charging for auxiliary power. Slightly larger turbines can be used for making small contributions to a domestic power supply while selling unused power back to the utility supplier via the electrical grid. Arrays of large turbines, known as wind farms, have become an increasingly important source of renewable energy and are used in many countries as part of a strategy to reduce their reliance on fossil fuels.|$|E
5|$|He entrenched his {{position}} in northern England by marrying Ælfflæd, the daughter of Ealdred, Earl of Bamburgh. After killing Ealdred's successor Eadulf in 1041, Siward gained control of all Northumbria. He exerted his power in support of Cnut's successors, kings Harthacnut and Edward, assisting them with vital military aid and counsel. He probably gained control of the middle shires of Northampton and Huntingdon by the 1050s, {{and there is some}} evidence that he spread Northumbrian control into Cumberland. In the early 1050s Earl Siward turned against the Scottish ruler Mac Bethad mac Findlaích ("Macbeth"). Despite the death of his son Osbjorn, Siward defeated Mac Bethad in battle in 1054. More than half <b>a</b> <b>millennium</b> later the Scotland adventure earned him a place in William Shakespeare's Macbeth. Siward died in 1055, leaving one son, Waltheof, who would eventually succeed to Northumbria. St Olave's church in York and nearby Heslington Hill are associated with Siward.|$|E
