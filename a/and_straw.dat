5|$|Many {{members of}} the {{garrison}} tried to sneak aboard Leake's ships to escape the siege. The situation was precarious and was only worsened when a storm damaged many of Leake's ships on 4–5 December. By this time, the garrison was critically short of medicines and supplies. Many were sick or injured and too few remained to carry out repairs to the shell-damaged fortifications. Only 1,300 were healthy enough to man the defences. Their living conditions were increasingly grim; their shoes had worn out and many men wore makeshift sandals made from hay <b>and</b> <b>straw.</b>|$|E

40|$|Background: We {{designed}} {{this study to}} detect the cryoinjury rate on human sperm after serial freezing and thawing, taking into consideration the effects of using cryovials <b>and</b> <b>straws.</b> Materials <b>and</b> Methods: In this experimental study, semen specimens obtained from 15 subjects were divided into normozoospermic and oligozoospermic groups. Each of the normozoospermic and oligozoo spermic semen specimens were additionally divided into two groups: i. washed and ii. unwashed. Specimens were repeatedly freeze-thawed by using cryovials <b>and</b> <b>straws</b> with the fast liquid nitrogen vapor method, until no motile sperm remained. Sperm motility, recovery, and morphology rate were then determined after thawing, and compared between the groups while taking into consideration the effects of using cryovials <b>and</b> <b>straws.</b> Results: Motile spermatozoa were observed in all normozoospermic samples up to thaw 6 with both cryovials <b>and</b> <b>straws</b> while in oligozoospermic specimens up to thaw 4 (<b>straw)</b> <b>and</b> thaw 3 (cryovial) in the freeze-thawing cycle. Normozoospermic sample analysis showed {{no significant difference in}} morphology rate.

The half times(t 1 / 2) of rice <b>straw</b> <b>and</b> corn <b>straw</b> mass lost under aerobic condition were 59. 2 d and 52. 9 d, which were short than those(72. 6 d and 79. 9 d) under the anaerobic condition, respectively. Carbon release constants from rice <b>straw</b> <b>and</b> corn <b>straw</b> under aerobic condition were 0. 61 and 0. 60 per month, which were higher than those (0. 55 and 0. 57 per month) under anaerobic condition. The nitrogen release from crop straw followed the same rule as the carbon release from straw. The constants of nitrogen released from rice <b>straw</b> <b>and</b> corn <b>straw</b> under aerobic condition were 0. 25 and 2. 36 per month, which were higher than those(0. 16 and 2. 32 per month) under anaerobic condition.

5|$|Authentic bird's nest soup is {{made from}} the nests of the edible-nest swiftlet (or white-nest swiftlet), Aerodramus fuciphagus, and the black-nest swiftlet, Aerodramus maximus. Instead of {{incorporating}} twigs, feathers <b>and</b> <b>straw</b> like others in the genus, these two swiftlets make their nest only from strands of their gummy saliva, which harden when exposed to air. Once the nests are harvested, they are cleaned and sold to restaurants. Over the past twenty years, the high demand for the nests of these Aerodramus species has had an adverse effect on their populations. The Niah caves population of black-nest swiftlets plunged from around 1.5 million pairs in 1959 to 150,000–298,000 pairs in the early 1990s through over-harvesting.|$|E
5|$|Medieval vernacular {{architecture}} in rural environments {{made use of}} local materials and styles. As in England, cruck construction was used, employing pairs of curved timbers to support the roof; however they were usually hidden from view. In rural areas there was extensive use of turf {{to fill in the}} walls, sometimes on a stone base, but they were not long lasting and had to be rebuilt frequently, perhaps as often as every two or three years. In some regions, including the south-west and around Dundee, solid clay walls were used, or combinations of clay, turf <b>and</b> <b>straw,</b> rendered with clay or lime to make them weatherproof. With a lack of long span structural timber, the most common building material was stone, employed in both mortared and dry stone construction. Different regions used broom, heather, straw, turfs or reeds for roofing.|$|E

5|$|Some {{commercial}} {{traffic on the}} waterways continued despite the railway competition, with 44,034 tons generating £733 of tolls in 1888, which enabled the Commissioners to show a profit of £216. Traffic had fallen slightly to 42,640 tons in 1898, but by 1905 was down to 12,770 tons, and the Commissioners showed a loss of £702 that year. An Alderman giving evidence to the Royal Commission on Canals and Waterways in 1905 pointed out {{that one of the}} railway companies had been paying to collect traffic in hay <b>and</b> <b>straw,</b> although this practice ceased when it became public knowledge. The condition of the Nene and the Wisbech Canal declined, which discouraged navigation, but some trade in agricultural produce, coal, bricks and road building materials continued. Coal was delivered by barge from Outwell Depot to around 40 pumping stations.|$|E
5|$|The storm's effects also {{resulted}} {{in the deaths of}} over 33,000cattleheads and inflicted a heavy blow to the country's November–December rice harvest. Crop damage occurred across 174,000hectares (430,000acres) of land in Bagerhat, Bhola, Khulna, and Satkhira districts as well as Cox's Bazar. The total gross weight of crop losses was estimated at 200,000tonnes (220,000tons), accounting for 70%of Bangladeshi crops that were ready for harvest. Extensive damage to infrastructure was reported across the nation. Most mud <b>and</b> <b>straw</b> houses and tin shed offices and schools were destroyed due to the storm. Telecommunications and electrical supplies were disrupted by the storm in at least sixteen towns and four coastal districts. In the capital city of Dhaka, debris and fallen trees caused by winds of up to 120km/h (75mph) {{resulted in}} both power outages and paralyzed traffic. The power outages also disrupted the city's distribution of water. In Shyamnagar Upazila, all mud and straw-constructed homes were destroyed. Overall, an official estimates suggested 50,000homes were destroyed across the country. However, independent investigations were more aggressive in their estimates, suggesting that over a million homes accounting for 60–80% of homes in coastal Bangladesh were destroyed, displacing as many as seven million people.|$|E
5|$|The vernacular {{architecture}} of Scotland, as elsewhere, {{made use of}} local materials and methods. The homes of the poor were usually of very simple construction, and were built by groups of family and friends. Stone is plentiful throughout Scotland and was a common building material, employed in both mortared and dry stone construction. As in English {{vernacular architecture}}, where wood was available, crucks (pairs of curved timbers) were often used to support the roof. With a lack of long span structural timber, the crucks were sometimes raised and supported on the walls. Walls were often built of stone, and could have gaps filled with turf, or plastered with clay. In some regions wattled walls filled in with turf were employed, sometimes on a stone base. Turf-filled walls were not long-lasting, {{and had to be}} rebuilt perhaps as often as every two or three years. In some regions, including the south-west and around Dundee, solid clay walls were used, or combinations of clay, turf <b>and</b> <b>straw,</b> rendered with clay or lime to make them weatherproof. Different regions used turfs, or thatch of broom, heather, straw or reeds for roofing.|$|E

5|$|Trade on {{the lower}} river was carried in barges and keels. During the early 1800s as trade was increasing, so the river was {{simultaneously}} silting up. Around 1800, vessels carrying 60 tons could reach the port facilities at Spalding; however, by the 1820s, ships could only be loaded with 40 tons each as the river silting had worsened. Trade records indicate that in 1829, vessels carried just under 20,000 tons to and from Spalding, and by 1835 this had increased to over 34,000 tons. There was pressure from merchants to cater for larger vessels, and with later improvements, carried out under an act of parliament obtained in 1837, barges and sloops of up to 120 tons could use the port. Because the river was maintained for drainage, some commercial traffic continued despite the railways, and tolls of £478 were collected on 11,690 tons in 1888. Coal for Spalding gasworks arrived by boat until the early 1900s, and the last regular trade was the carriage of corn, hay <b>and</b> <b>straw</b> from Spalding to Fosdyke, where the cargo was transferred to larger ships. All commercial carrying had ceased {{by the end of}} the Second World War.|$|E

The {{differences of}} passage rate particles is considerably influenced by different feed consumption relating {{to the nature of}} feed, types of animals, and physiological status of animals. The purpose of this experiments was to measure differences of passage rate feed particles at various crude fiber feed in cows’ rumen. This experiment used two cows of fistulated crossed breed Frisian Holland (PFH), non-productive with the age of 4 - 5 years. Feed observed in this experiments were peanut <b>straw,</b> corn <b>straw</b> <b>and</b> sugar cane <b>straw</b> <b>and</b> fed as single feed. Method applied to measure passage rate was chrome mordanse/chrome and NDF as marker introduced through fistulated rumen. All data were analyzed by using regression. The value of passage rate (Kp) was about 3, 7 % per hour for peanut <b>straw,</b> <b>and</b> 2, 5 % per hour for corn <b>straw</b> <b>and</b> sugar cane <b>straw.</b> Kp value of peanut straw was higher than that of corn <b>straw</b> <b>and</b> sugar cane <b>straw.</b> The highest value of Kp for peanut srtaw was due to better quality of peanut straw compared to corn <b>straw</b> <b>and</b> sugar cane <b>straw</b> in which peanut straw contained high level of protein and low level of Neutral Detergent Fiber (NDF). The differences of chemical composition of crude fiber feed from peanut straw with high level of protein and low level of NDF compared to corn <b>straw</b> <b>and</b> sugar cane <b>straw</b> resulted in degradation of feed by microbial rumen was higher, low rumination.
