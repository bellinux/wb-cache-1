50|$|US Air Force Flight Dynamics Laboratory {{developed}} the FDL-23, a 2nd generation Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA)In the early 1970s, two Ryan Model 147G reconnaissance drones were requisitioned from the Air Force Museum by the Air Force Flight Dynamics Laboratory at WPAFB to investigate high maneuverability flight and discover whether a high performance {{remotely piloted aircraft}} could perform {{some of the same}} missions as manned aircraft. The 147G was particularly suited for this since it had an extended nose section for equipment, a more powerful engine, and a larger wing than previous FireBee variants. The aircraft was fitted with a reinforced wing box, an <b>active</b> <b>rudder,</b> a nose video camera, a Vega digital control/data link, speed brakes, and a Lear Sieglar digital proportional autopilot. The modified drone was originally designated the FDL-23 and later the XQM-103. Six captive and six free flight test flights were performed, with the machine able to perform 10G turns in its final configuration. On its fifth mission, the engine shaft bent at 10 G's and impacted the compressor housing, damaging its engine. On its sixth mission, the aircraft refused to accept ground commands and self-recovered in the mountains north of Los Angeles with minor damage. The Program was completed successfully, and met all of its development objectives. Several major system including the autopilot and the command/control system were adopted by production drone programs. The major limitation to using the RPA for fighter missions was the lack of a video tracking system, which made tracking maneuvering targets extremely difficult.At the conclusion of the program, the aircraft was donated to the Dugway Proving Ground in Utah, and became a static display at the entrance to Eagle Range. This aircraft reappeared at Edwards AFB without the engine as a captive test platform for optics testing.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} an advanced buffet load alleviation (BLA) system that utilizes distributed piezoelectric actuators in conjunction with an <b>active</b> <b>rudder</b> to reduce the structural dynamic response of the F/A- 18 aircraft vertical tails to buffet loads. The BLA system was defined analytically with a detailed finite-element-model of the tail structure and piezoelectric actuators. Oscillatory aerodynamics were included along with a buffet forcing function to complete the aeroservoelastic model of the tail with rudder control surface. Two single-input-single-output (SISO) controllers were designed, one for the <b>active</b> <b>rudder</b> and one for the active piezoelectric actuators. The results from the analytical open and closed loop simulations were used to predict the system performance. The objective of this BLA system is to extend the life of vertical tail structures and decrease their life-cycle costs. This system can be applied to other aircraft designs to address suppression of structural vibrations on military and commercial aircraft.

40|$|Model {{experiments}} {{to investigate the}} surface performance of the Canadian Victoria Class submarine, under various environmental and operational conditions, were carried out at the Institute for Ocean Technology of the National Research Council, Canada. The task was initiated by the Canadian Navy {{in the wake of}} the HMCS Chicoutimi fi re-at-sea on the recommendation of a Naval Board of Inquiry. The program included systematic {{experiments to}} evaluate the seakeeping behaviour of the submarine in environmental and operational conditions selected to support development of guidelines for submarine operators. This included experiments in irregular waves and regular waves, along with roll decay tests. Environmental and operational variables covered of range of speeds, sea states and vessel headings. A free running, self-propelled, autopilot-driven, radio controlled model was designed and built to a scale of 1 : 14. 96. The model, suitable for surface operations only, was outfi tted with <b>active</b> <b>rudders,</b> fi xed forward and after planes, main sail and keel. The model was designed so that the space between the outer body and the pressure hull was subjected to fl ooding and limited free fl ow. The external geometry of the model did not include acoustic tiles present on the fullscale boat. The model was instrumented to measure model motions, speed and propeller revolutions, and to monitor presence of water on deck in selected locations. Measurements of the roll responses were the principal targets of the project investigation. This paper presents a description of the model, its particulars, including the evolution of the design process. Experimental results including roll, pitch and heave responses in regular and irregular waves, and roll decay results are presented.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} contains new {{results on}} the design of dynamic positioning (DP) systems for marine surface vessels. A positioned ship is continuously exposed to environmental disturbances, and the objective of the DP system is to maintain the desired position and heading by applying adequate propeller thrust. The disturbances can be categorized into three classes. First, there are stationary forces mainly due to wind, ocean currents, and static wave drift. Secondly, there are slowly-varying forces mainly due to wave drift, a phenomenon experienced in irregular seas. Finally there are rapid, zero mean linear wave loads causing oscillatory motion with the same frequency as the incoming wave train. The main contribution of this dissertation is a method for better compensation of the second type of disturbances, slowly-varying forces, by introducing feedback from measured acceleration. It is shown theoretically and through model experiments that positioning performance can be improved without compromising on thruster usage. The specific contributions are: • Observer design: Two observers with wave filtering capabilities was developed, analyzed, and tested experimentally. Both of them incorporate position and, if available, velocity and acceleration measurements. Filtering out the rapid, zero mean motion induced by linear wave loads is particularly important whenever measured acceleration is to be used by the DP controller, because in an acceleration signal, the high frequency contributions from the linear wave loads dominate. • Controller design: A low speed tracking controller has been developed. The proposed control law can be regarded as an extension of any conventional PID-like design, and stability was guaranteed for bounded yaw rate. A method for numerically calculating this upper bound was proposed, and for most ships the resulting bound will be higher than the physical limitation. For completeness, the missing nonlinear term that, if included in the controller, would ensure global exponential stability was identified. The second contribution of this dissertation is a new method for mapping controller action into thruster forces. A low speed control allocation method for overactuated ships equipped with propellers and <b>rudders</b> was derived. <b>Active</b> use of <b>rudders,</b> together with propeller action, is advantageous in a DP operation, because the overall fuel consumption can be reduced. A new model ship, Cybership II, together with a low-cost position reference system was developed with the aim of testing the proposed concepts. The acceleration experiments were carried out at the recently developed Marine Cybernetics Laboratory, while the control allocation experiment was carried out at the Guidance, Navigation and Control Laboratory. The main results of this dissertation have been published or are still under review for publication in international journals and at international conferences.

40|$|High {{performance}} twin-tail aircraft, {{like the}} F- 15 and F/A- 18, encounter a condition known as tail buffet. At high angles of attack, vortices are generated at the wing fuselage interface (shoulder) or other leading edge extensions. These vortices are {{directed toward the}} twin vertical tails. When the flow interacts with the vertical tail it creates pressure variations that can oscillate the vertical tail assembly. This results in fatigue cracks in the vertical tail assembly that can decrease the fatigue life and increase maintenance costs. For many years, {{research has been conducted}} to understand this phenomenon of buffet and to reduce its adverse effects on the fatigue life of aerospace structures. Many proposed solutions to this tail buffet problem have had limited success. These include strengthening the tail, modifying the vortex flow, using an <b>active</b> <b>rudder</b> control, and leading edge extensions. Some of the proposed active controls include piezoelectric actuators. Recently, an offset piezoceramic stack actuator was used on an F- 15 wind tunnel model to control buffet induced vibrations at high angles of attack. The controller was based on acceleration feedback control methods. In this thesis a procedure for designing the offset piezoceramic stack actuators is developed. This design procedure includes determining the quantity and type of piezoceramic stacks used in these actuators. The changes of stresses, in the vertical tail caused by these actuators during an active control, are investigated. In many cases, linear controllers are very effective in reducing vibrations. However, during flight, the natural frequencies of the vertical tail structural system changes as the airspeed increases. This in turn, reduces the effectiveness of a linear controller. Other causes such as the unmodeled dynamics and nonlinear effects due to debonds also reduce the effectiveness of linear controllers. In this thesis, an adaptive neural network is used to augment the linear controller to correct these effects. Ph. D.

40|$|Roll {{stabilization}} for monohulls is {{an important}} issue in naval architecture. Several methods including roll stabilization tanks, <b>active</b> control fins, <b>rudder</b> roll stabilization systems, and bilge keels are commonly used for roll stabilization purposes and each one of them has its own advantages and disadvantages. In this thesis roll stabilization is studied by using passive and active roll stabilization configurations with hydrofoils. The main objective of this research is to identify an effective roll stabilization system for use on high- speed monohull vessels. The analysis of the performance of a passive hydrofoil configuration is used {{as a starting point for}} the development of active control mechanisms. A generic fast monohull was created for study purposes and the SWAN- 2 code (ShipWaveANalysis), a state-of-the-art time domain simulation program, was used for the analysis of the linear free-surface flow around the vessel. Simulations were carried out in regular waves incident at angles ranging from 90 ⁰, 105 ⁰, 120 ⁰, 135 ⁰ and 150 ⁰ degrees relative to the ship axis, 900 being beam waves and 180 ⁰ degree being head waves. The ship was equipped with a hydrofoil fixed amidships, quarter to aft and aft to determine the sensitivity of roll motion on the longitudinal position of the lifting appendage. (cont.) It was found that the most efficient location for the hydrofoil is amidships leading to a 20 % to 60 % roll motion reduction (depending on the wave angle and ship speed) of the RMS value of roll motion in an ISSC spectrum. Also studies were performed to determine the planform area of the hydrofoil for optimal roll motion reduction. In addition, four different Froude numbers are used, ranging from 0. 3 to 0. 9, to evaluate the effect of the speed on the effectiveness of the lifting appendage. As expected, higher speeds lead to better seakeeping performance, namely better roll reduction compared to lower speeds. Passive hydrofoils were found to be very effective in reducing the rolling motion. Active roll control mechanisms were also investigated by seeking the optimal time-dependent variation of the modulus and phase of the hydrofoil angle of attack and found to be very effective leading to increased roll reduction. The development of such optimal control algorithms is expected to lead to an enhanced roll seakeeping performance over a broader range of sea state conditions and ship speeds. by Talha Ulusoy.
