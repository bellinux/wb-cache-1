25|$|Spoon bits are the {{traditional}} boring tools {{used with a}} brace. They should never be used with a power drill of any kind. Their key advantage over regular brace bits and power drill bits is that {{the angle of the}} hole can be adjusted. This is very important in chairmaking, because all the angles are usually eyeballed. Another advantage is {{that they do not have}} <b>a</b> <b>lead</b> <b>screw,</b> so they can be drilled successfully in a chair leg without having the lead screw peek out the other side.|$|E
2500|$|Another problem arises {{because of}} the {{geometry}} of the tonearm. Master recordings are cut on a recording lathe where a sapphire stylus [...] moves radially across the blank, suspended on a straight track and driven by <b>a</b> <b>lead</b> <b>screw.</b> Most turntables use a pivoting tonearm, introducing side forces and pitch and azimuth errors, and thus distortion in the playback signal. Various mechanisms were devised in attempts to compensate, {{with varying degrees of}} success. See more at phonograph.|$|E
5000|$|A traveling-screw linear {{actuator}} has <b>a</b> <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> that passes entirely through the motor.In a traveling-screw {{linear actuator}}, the motor [...] "crawls" [...] {{up and down}} <b>a</b> <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> that is restrained from spinning. The only spinning parts are inside the motor, {{and may not be}} visible from the outside.|$|E
50|$|Example: A CNC {{vertical}} mill has <b>a</b> vertical <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> on the Z-axis. <b>A</b> low <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> pitch (i.e. 5 turns {{per inch}} or fewer) means when the driving motor power is removed such as by turning the machine off, {{the weight of the}} spindle will cause the <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> to rotate as the spindle motor falls down. Obviously this is a bad thing. The solution to prevent back-driving is to use <b>a</b> finer (higher) <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> pitch (i.e. 10tpi or greater) or have a locking mechanism.|$|R
50|$|A {{second drive}} type, the squiggle motor, uses {{piezoelectric}} elements bonded orthogonally to a nut. Their ultrasonic vibrations rotate <b>a</b> central <b>lead</b> <b>screw.</b> This is <b>a</b> direct drive mechanism.|$|R
50|$|For the X and Y-axis {{drive systems}} most PCB milling {{machines}} use stepper motors that drive <b>a</b> precision <b>lead</b> <b>screw.</b> The <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> is in turn {{linked to the}} gantry or milling head by a special precision machined connection assembly. To maintain correct alignment during milling, the gantry or milling head's direction of travel is guided along using linear or dovetailed bearing(s). Most X/Y drive systems provide user control, via software, of the milling speed, which determines how fast the stepper motors drive their respective axes.|$|R
50|$|The {{position}} of the moving platform relative to the fixed base is typically controlled by a linear actuator of some form, whether manual, motorized, or hydraulic/pneumatic. The most common method is to incorporate <b>a</b> <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> passing through a lead nut in the platform. The rotation of such <b>a</b> <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> may be controlled either manually or by a motor.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Animation {{showing the}} {{operation}} of a screw. As the screw shaft rotates, the nut moves linearly along the shaft. This is a type called <b>a</b> <b>lead</b> <b>screw.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> is {{sometimes}} {{used with a}} split nut also called half nut which allows the nut to be disengaged from the threads and moved axially, independently of the screw's rotation, when needed (such as in single-point threading on a manual lathe).|$|E
5000|$|Allowable play varies greatly {{depending}} on the use. As example, a wheelbarrow wheel supports radial and axial loads. Axial loads may be hundreds of newtons force left or right, and it is typically acceptable for the wheel to wobble {{by as much as}} 10 mm under the varying load. In contrast, a lathe may position a cutting tool to ±0.02 mm using <b>a</b> ball <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> held by rotating bearings. The bearings support axial loads of thousands of newtons in either direction, and must hold the ball <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> to ±0.002 mm across that range of loads ...|$|R
50|$|Low {{friction}} in ball screws yields high {{mechanical efficiency}} compared to alternatives. A typical ball screw may be 90 percent efficient, versus 20 to 25 percent efficiency of <b>an</b> Acme <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> of equal size. Lack of sliding {{friction between the}} nut and screw lends itself to extended lifespan of the screw assembly (especially in no-backlash systems), reducing downtime for maintenance and parts replacement, while also decreasing demand for lubrication. This, combined with their overall performance benefits and reduced power requirements, may offset the initial costs of using ball screws.|$|R
5000|$|The {{amount of}} {{rotation}} of an accurately made screw {{can be directly}} and precisely correlated to {{a certain amount of}} axial movement (and vice versa), through the constant known as the <b>screw's</b> <b>lead</b> (...) [...] <b>A</b> <b>screw's</b> <b>lead</b> is the distance it moves forward axially with one complete turn (360°). (In most threads is, in all single-start threads, lead and pitch refer to essentially the same concept.) ...|$|R
50|$|A {{special case}} of this cam is {{constant}} lead, where {{the position of the}} follower is linear with rotation, as in <b>a</b> <b>lead</b> <b>screw.</b> The purpose and detail of implementation influence whether this application is called a cam or a screw thread, but in some cases, the nomenclature may be ambiguous.|$|E
50|$|In the {{majority}} of linear actuator designs, the basic principle of operation is that of an inclined plane. The threads of <b>a</b> <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> act as a continuous ramp that allows a small rotational force to be used over a long distance to accomplish movement of a large load over a short distance.|$|E
5000|$|Motors {{are mostly}} used when {{circular}} motions are needed, {{but can also}} be used for linear applications by transforming circular to linear motion with <b>a</b> <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> or similar mechanism. On the other hand, some actuators are intrinsically linear, such as piezoelectric actuators. Conversion between circular and linear motion is commonly made via a few simple types of mechanism including: ...|$|E
40|$|A {{velocity}} servo {{for continuous}} scan Fourier interference spectrometer {{of the double}} pass retroreflector type having two cat's eye retroreflectors is described. The servo uses <b>an</b> open loop, <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> drive system for one retroreflector with compensation for any variations in speed of drive of the <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> provided by sensing any variation {{in the rate of}} reference laser fringes, and producing an error signal from such variation used to compensate by energizing a moving coil actuator for the other retroreflector optical path, and energizing (through a highpass filter) piezoelectric actuators for the secondary mirrors of the retroreflectors...|$|R
40|$|Linear {{magnetic}} gearboxes (LMG) {{and magnetic}} <b>lead</b> <b>screws</b> (MLS) {{have been shown}} to be capable of operating at significantly higher volumetric force densities than traditional electromagnetic linear actuators (ELA). However in both such devices the linear translator must be made of magnet material and therefore if the stroke length of the translator is long the cost of the MLS and LMG will become prohibitively high. In this paper <b>a</b> magnetically geared <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> (MGLS) is investigated and its performance capability is compared with the LMG and MLS. The advantage of the MGLS is that the translator does not contain magnets...|$|R
40|$|In a Fourier {{interference}} spectrometer of the doublepass retroreflector type, {{a single}} mirror is {{employed in the}} path of both split beams of an incoming ray to cause them to double back through separate retroreflectors. Changes in optical path length are achieved by linear displacement of both retroreflectors using <b>a</b> motor driven <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> on one for large, low frequency changes, a moving-coil actuator on the other for smaller, mid-frequency changes and a piezoelectric actuator on one of these two for small, high frequency changes...|$|R
50|$|Typically, an {{electric}} motor is mechanically connected to rotate <b>a</b> <b>lead</b> <b>screw.</b> <b>A</b> <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> has a continuous helical thread machined on its circumference running along the length (similar to the thread on a bolt). Threaded onto the lead screw is a lead nut or ball nut with corresponding helical threads. The nut is prevented from rotating with the lead screw (typically the nut interlocks with a non-rotating part of the actuator body). Therefore, when the lead screw is rotated, the nut will be driven along the threads. The direction of motion of the nut depends on the direction of rotation of the lead screw. By connecting linkages to the nut, the motion {{can be converted to}} usable linear displacement. Most current actuators are built for high speed, high force, or a compromise between the two. When considering an actuator for a particular application, the most important specifications are typically travel, speed, force, accuracy, and lifetime. Most varieties are mounted on dampers or butterfly valves.|$|E

50|$|Maudslay did not {{invent the}} slide-rest (as others such as James Nasmyth have claimed), {{and may not}} have been the first to combine <b>a</b> <b>lead</b> <b>screw,</b> slide-rest, and set of change gears all on one lathe (Jesse Ramsden may have done that in 1775; {{evidence}} is scant), but he did introduce the three-part combination of lead screw, slide rest, and change gears, sparking a great advance in machine tools and in the engineering use of screw threads.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> {{leadscrew}} (or <b>lead</b> <b>screw),</b> {{also known}} as a power screw or translation screw, is a screw used as a linkage in a machine, to translate turning motion into linear motion. Because of the large area of sliding contact between their male and female members, screw threads have larger frictional energy losses compared to other linkages. They are not typically used to carry high power, but more for intermittent use in low power actuator and positioner mechanisms. Common applications are linear actuators, machine slides (such as in machine tools), vises, presses, and jacks.|$|R
40|$|POWER SCREW is an {{important}} machine tool for the following three reasons :It provides high mechanical advantage {{in order to move}} large loads with minimum effort(e. g. Screw Jack),.

5000|$|Sensors {{developed}} for Web Guiding {{applications in the}} Converting Industry may be pneumatic, photoelectric, ultrasonic, or infrared. The system’s controls must process the output signals from the sensors in to a form that can drive an actuator. Many controls today are electronic, typically using an amplifier to convert signals from the sensor, then commanding a special servo motor incorporating <b>a</b> <b>lead</b> or ball <b>screw</b> for guiding actuation. Some electromechanical guiding systems also utilize computers.|$|R
50|$|This was the {{temperature}} machine. It {{consisted of a}} long rotating drum (perhaps 18 inches long). Recorded on the drum were a series of temperatures (minus 40 °F to 120 °F, or &minus;40 °C to 50 °C). A single soundhead was attached to <b>a</b> <b>lead</b> <b>screw.</b> A thermometer was placed {{on top of the}} telephone company central office and connected to the Audichron temperature machine. This would cause the leadscrew to rotate and position the soundhead on top of the correct temperature recording.|$|E
50|$|Both radios used {{vacuum tubes}} and {{employed}} Collins innovations including mechanical filters and permeability tuned oscillators. The latter alters the resonant frequency of a circuit by moving a sintered powder core {{in and out}} of the tuning coil using <b>a</b> <b>lead</b> <b>screw.</b> The KWS-1 final amplifier use a pair of 4X150 power tubes and operated at a power input of one kilowatt, the maximum allowed under Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations at the time. The transmitter appearance matched the receiver, but its high voltage power supply was packaged in a separate pedestal.|$|E

5000|$|A {{syringe pump}} {{consists}} {{of one or}} more syringes which have been pre-filled and loaded into a mechanized device containing <b>a</b> motor-driven <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> which will push the reciprocating plunger of the syringe(s) for specified distances at specified intervals. These devices are capable of extremely high accuracy and are pulse-free (i.e., the fluid is dispensed in a continuous stream rather than with the pulsations of the peristaltic or inductive pumps) but are limited in volume to the total volume of the attached syringe(s), and, once the emptied, the syringe(s) will require refilling before being used again making them of even more limited use than the bottle top dispensers. They are also among the most expensive types of media dispensers currently on the market. Common syringe pump media are acids, chemicals, coolants, combustible fluids, corrosive agents, gasoline or diesel fuel, non-liquid gas or air, ground water, hazardous materials, high viscosity fluids, liquid metal, oils, potable water, salt water, adhesives, and high temperature media.|$|R
50|$|A {{differential}} screw is {{a mechanism}} used for making small, precise {{adjustments to the}} spacing between two objects (such as in focusing a microscope, moving the anvils of a micrometer, or positioning optics). A differential screw uses a spindle with two screw threads of differing leads (aka thread pitch), and possibly opposite handedness, on which two nuts move. As the spindle rotates, {{the space between the}} nuts changes based on the difference between the threads. These mechanisms allow extremely small adjustments using commonly available screws. A differential screw mechanism using two nuts incurs higher friction and therefore requires more torque to turn than <b>a</b> simple, single <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> with <b>an</b> equivalent pitch.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Dynamic {{characteristics}} of the system have been given more and more attention so as to improve the retention and reliability of machining accuracy. Research has shown that dynamic performance of the feed drive mechanism has {{significant impact on the}} processing quality and efficiency of CNC. This paper mainly focuses on the DCG which realizes its motion on the basis of <b>a</b> pair of <b>lead</b> <b>screw.</b> The dynamic performance of the DCG was analyzed by the method of finite element analysis. DCG structure and the key design parameters of the rail joint surface have been studied to find out the influence on its dynamic characteristics. These researches provided a basis for the realization of the CNC feed motion of high-speed and high-precision. Besides, it is also possible to improve the overall performance of CNC machine tools...|$|R
50|$|In manual linear stages, {{a control}} knob {{attached}} to <b>a</b> <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> is typically used. The knob may be indexed to indicate its angular position. The linear {{displacement of the}} stage {{is related to the}} angular displacement of the knob by the lead screw pitch. For example if the lead screw pitch is 0.5 mm then one full revolution of the knob will move the stage platform 0.5 mm relative to the stage base. If the knob has 50 index marks around its circumference, then each index division is equivalent to 0.01 mm of linear motion of the stage platform.|$|E
50|$|Most {{electro-mechanical}} designs incorporate <b>a</b> <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> {{and lead}} nut. Some use a ball screw and ball nut. In either case the screw may {{be connected to}} a motor or manual control knob either directly or {{through a series of}} gears. Gears are typically used to allow a smaller (and weaker) motor spinning at a higher rpm to be geared down to provide the torque necessary to spin the screw under a heavier load than the motor would otherwise be capable of driving directly. Effectively this sacrifices actuator speed in favor of increased actuator thrust. In some applications the use of worm gear is common as this allow a smaller built in dimension still allowing great travel length.|$|E
50|$|Precision stages such {{as those}} used for optics do not use <b>a</b> <b>lead</b> <b>screw,</b> but instead use a fine-pitch screw or a {{micrometer}} which presses on a hardened metal pad on the stage platform. Rotating the screw or micrometer pushes the platform forward. A spring provides restoring force to keep the platform {{in contact with the}} actuator. This provides more precise motion of the stage. Stages designed to be mounted vertically use a slightly different arrangement, where the actuator is attached to the movable platform and its tip rests on a metal pad on the fixed base. This allows the weight of the platform and its load to be supported by the actuator rather than the spring.|$|E
50|$|A traveling-nut linear {{actuator}} has a motor that stays attached to {{one end of}} the <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> (perhaps indirectly through a gear box), the motor spins the <b>lead</b> <b>screw,</b> and the <b>lead</b> nut is restrained from spinning so it travels up and down the <b>lead</b> <b>screw.</b>|$|R

40|$|A sliding mode {{vibration}} controller for <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> drives Orang Vahid-Araghi 1 and Farid Golnaraghi 2 The conversion of rotary to translational motion in <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> drives {{occurs at the}} meshing <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> and nut threads. A decreasing coefficient of friction with sliding velocity, may lead to instabilities in these drives. In this paper, a sliding mode controller is designed for a {{two degrees of freedom}} <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> drive model. This controller has two objectives: to regulate the <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> angular velocity to a preset value and to attenuate friction-induced vibrations. Only upper and/or lower bounds of system parameters are assumed to be known. In addition, {{in the development of the}} controller no specific model is assumed for the dependence of the coefficient of friction on the relative sliding velocity. Two modifications are applied to the basic discontinuous sliding mode controller to eliminate the inherent chattering problem and to limit the controlled input torque levels. Numerical simulation results are presented that show the applicability and the per-formance of the proposed controller...|$|R
