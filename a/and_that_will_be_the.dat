500|$|The result marked Manchester United's first Shield {{defeat in}} 13 years, {{and was the}} ninth time Arsenal had won the Charity Shield. Arsenal became the first {{southern}} club since Tottenham Hotspur in 1962 to win the Shield outright.

Bergkamp felt the result showed that Arsenal had what it took to retain the Premier League title: [...] "We've still got the same mentality <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> basis for this year's challenge. This is a good start. It is harder to retain the trophy." ...|$|E

In this role, he assumed stewardship of Singapore's economy.

He initiated the setting up of the Economic Development Board which was established in August 1961 to attract foreign multinational corporations to invest in Singapore. The next year, he started the development of the Jurong industrial estate on the western end of the island which was then a swamp, offering incentives to local and foreign business to locate there.
