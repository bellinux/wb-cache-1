5|$|Rubidium is {{approximately}} as abundant as zinc and more abundant than copper. It occurs naturally in the minerals leucite, pollucite, carnallite, zinnwaldite, and lepidolite, <b>although</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> these contain only rubidium {{and no other}} alkali metals. Caesium is more abundant than some commonly known elements, such as antimony, cadmium, tin, and tungsten, but is much less abundant than rubidium.|$|E
5|$|Gene {{expression}} in prokaryotes {{is influenced by}} an RNA-based system similar in some respects to RNAi. Here, RNA-encoding genes control mRNA abundance or translation by producing a complementary RNA that anneals to an mRNA. However these regulatory RNAs are not {{generally considered to be}} analogous to miRNAs because the dicer enzyme is not involved. It has been suggested that CRISPR interference systems in prokaryotes are analogous to eukaryotic RNA interference systems, <b>although</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> the protein components are orthologous.|$|E
5|$|Nintendo has {{released}} few technical details regarding the Wii system, but some key facts have leaked through the press. <b>Although</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> these reports has been officially confirmed, they generally {{indicate that the}} console is an extension (or advancement) of the Nintendo GameCube architecture. Specifically, the analyses report that the Wii is roughly 1.5 to 2times as powerful as its predecessor. Based on specifications, the Wii {{has been called the}} least powerful of the major home consoles of its generation.|$|E

5|$|Senufo {{languages}} have {{a typical}} Niger–Congo noun class (or gender) system. Suffixes on nouns mark membership {{of one of}} the five noun genders. Pronouns, adjectives and copulas reflect the noun gender of the nominal they refer to. <b>Although</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> the sources on Nafaanra provides any details, it can be inferred from a brief word list given by Jordan that the Nafaanra noun class system resembles that of other Senufo languages.|$|E
5|$|Under {{fire and}} with the wind too calm for sailing, Barlow ran out oars to try and pull his brig away from the French batteries. The {{diminutive}} size of his vessel made it a difficult target and he was soon {{able to take advantage}} of a fresh breeze to withdraw from the crossfire. A single shot struck the brig, smashing into one of the 4-pounder cannon on deck and breaking it into three pieces, <b>although</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> the crew were wounded by the strike.|$|E
5|$|Various filmmakers have {{expressed}} interest in doing new adaptations of The Fountainhead, <b>although</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> these potential films has begun production. In the 1970s, writer-director Michael Cimino wanted to film his own script for United Artists. In 1992, producer James Hill optioned the rights and selected Phil Joanou to direct. In the 2000s, Oliver Stone was interested in directing a new adaptation; Brad Pitt was reportedly under consideration to play Roark. In a March 2016 interview, director Zack Snyder also {{expressed interest in}} doing a new film adaptation of The Fountainhead.|$|E

5|$|While the N-terminal nucleotide-binding {{pocket of}} Hsp90 is most widely studied and thus targeted, {{recent studies have}} {{suggested}} that a second ATP-binding site is located in the Hsp90 C-terminus. Targeting of this region has resulted in specific reduced Hsp90-hormone interactions and has been shown to influence Hsp90 nucleotide binding. <b>Although</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> the C-terminal Hsp90 inhibitors have yet to enter the clinic, the use of both N- and C-terminal Hsp90 inhibitors in combination represents an exciting new strategy for chemotherapy.|$|E

5|$|Many other {{applications}} were envisaged for the Gemini spacecraft {{at various stages}} before, during, and after the two years {{in which it was}} used by NASA for manned spaceflight. <b>Although</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> these proposals ever made it into operation, many were considered seriously, and in some cases flight hardware was constructed prior to cancellation. In the case of the Manned Orbital Laboratory, a Gemini spacecraft was launched on a suborbital demonstration flight in support of the program. In some cases technology developed in the Advanced Gemini program has been reintegrated into other programs, such as components from the Titan IIIM, which was to have launched MOL, being used to upgrade other Titan rockets.|$|E
5|$|More recently, several legal {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} by French jurists. These generally consider it likely that Le Gris was the real culprit based on Marguerite's evidence, <b>although</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> course could prove so conclusively. A major exception to this trend was a book written in 1890 by a descendant of Le Gris named F. White Le Grix, who makes a determined effort to defend his ancestor.Jager, p.206 Most recently, the story was studied in Eric Jager's work The Last Duel, which also considers Le Gris the likely rapist and has attracted the interest of Martin Scorsese, who is reportedly planning to make a feature film based on the book.|$|E
5|$|No. 77 Squadron {{returned}} to Williamtown in early 1969 to re-equip with Dassault MirageIII supersonic fighters, undertaking its initial flights on 7July. The Mirages {{were charged with}} interception, high- and low-angle bombing, close air support, and photo reconnaissance; their armament included 30mm cannon, Sidewinder missiles and conventional bombs. No.77 Squadron's prime role was ground attack, <b>although</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> the RAAF's Mirages ever saw combat. No.481 Squadron was responsible for day-to-day servicing, {{as well as most}} heavy maintenance. No.77 Squadron suffered its first fatal Mirage accident on 3April 1973, when an aircraft crashed during a training flight at low altitude. Another pilot was killed when his Mirage hit the water during formation flying at night on 24June 1976.|$|E

5|$|Several {{stars with}} {{planetary}} systems lie within {{the borders of}} Circinus, <b>although</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> the host stars are particularly prominent. HD 134060 is a sun-like yellow dwarf star of spectral type G0VFe+0.4 and magnitude 6.29, around 79light-years away. Its two planets were discovered in 2011 through the radial velocity method: the smaller, HD 134060 b, has a mass of 0.0351MJ (Jupiter masses) and orbits its star every 3.27days, at 0.0444 AU; the larger, HD 134060 c (0.15MJ), orbits farther out at 2.226AU, with a period of approximately 1161 days. Even fainter, at magnitude 8.8, HD 129445 is 220light-years away and has 99% of the Sun's mass and a similar spectral type of G8V. HD 129445 b, a Jupiter-like planet (1.6 MJ) discovered in 2010 via the radial velocity method, orbits this star {{at a distance of}} 2.9 AU, approximately every 1840days.|$|E
5|$|The {{attack on}} Sydney and Newcastle marked {{the start of}} a {{sustained}} Japanese submarine campaign against Australia. During 1942, Japanese submarines sank 17 ships in Australian waters, <b>although</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> these ships were sailing as part of a convoy. 16 ships were sunk in Australian waters during 1943, before the Japanese ended the campaign in July. Five of these ships were sunk while sailing in escorted convoys. The Australian naval authorities gradually dismantled the coastal convoy system between December 1943 and March 1944. By the end of the war, the RAAF and RAN had escorted over 1,100 convoys along the Australian coastline.|$|E
5|$|The {{length of}} time that Detox had been record for, {{as well as the}} limited amount of {{material}} that had been officially released or leaked from the recording sessions, had given it considerable notoriety within the music industry. Numerous release dates (including the ones mentioned above) had been given for the album over the years since it was first announced, <b>although</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> them transpired to be genuine. Several musicians closely affiliated with Dr. Dre, including Snoop Dogg, fellow rappers 50 Cent and Game and producer DJ Quik, had speculated in interviews that the album will never be released, due to Dr. Dre's business and entrepreneurial ventures having interfered with recording work, as well as causing him to lose motivation to record new material.|$|E
50|$|Happy Holidays was a British {{television}} mini-series {{aired on}} the BBC during 1954.

5|$|The walls never proved very {{successful}} as defensive structures, and were easily breached {{on more than}} one occasion. They served more as a means of controlling trade and taxing goods, and as a deterrent to smugglers. Throughout their history, the town walls of Edinburgh have served better in their role as a trade barrier than as a defensive one. By the mid 18th century, the walls had outlived both their defensive and trade purposes, and demolition of sections of the wall began. The Netherbow Port was pulled down in 1764, and demolition continued into the 19th century. Today, a number of sections of the three successive walls survive, <b>although</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> the ports remain.|$|E
5|$|A {{text from}} Tikal {{mentions}} K'uk' Mo' {{and has been}} dated to AD406, 20 years before K'uk' Mo' Ajaw founded the new dynasty at Copán. Both names are likely {{to refer to the}} same individual originally from Tikal. <b>Although</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> the hieroglyphic texts that mention the founding of the new Copán dynasty describe how K'uk' Mo' arrived at the city, indirect evidence suggests that he conquered the city by military means. On AltarQ he is depicted as a Teotihuacano warrior with goggle eyes and a war serpent shield. When he arrived at Copán he initiated the construction of various structures, including one temple in the talud-tablero style typical of Teotihuacan and another with inset corners and apron moldings that are characteristic of Tikal. These strong links with both the Maya and Central Mexican cultures suggest that he was at least a Mexicanized Maya or possibly even from Teotihuacan. The dynasty founded by king K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' ruled the city for four centuries and included sixteen kings plus a probable pretender who would have been seventeenth in line. Several monuments have survived that were dedicated by K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' and by his heir.|$|E
5|$|Augustine built {{a church}} at his {{foundation}} of Sts Peter and Paul Abbey at Canterbury, later renamed St Augustine's Abbey. This church was destroyed after the Norman Conquest {{to make way}} for a new abbey church. The mission also established Augustine's cathedral at Canterbury, which became Christ Church Priory. This church has not survived, and it is unclear if the church that was destroyed in 1067 and described by the medieval writer Eadmer as Augustine's church, was built by Augustine. Another medieval chronicler, Florence of Worcester, claimed that the priory was destroyed in 1011, and Eadmer himself had contradictory stories about the events of 1011, in one place claiming that the church was destroyed by fire and in another claiming only that it was looted. A cathedral was also established in Rochester; although the building was destroyed in 676, the bishopric continued in existence. Other church buildings were erected by the missionaries in London, York, and possibly Lincoln, <b>although</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> them survive.|$|E
