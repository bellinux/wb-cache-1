Given the breadth of the description of the 11 categories of documents called for by the subpoena, the collection and production [...] of the materials demanded was tantamount to answering a series of interrogatories asking a witness [...] to disclose the existence and location of particular documents fitting certain broad descriptions. The assembly of literally hundreds of pages of material in response to a request for [...] "any and all documents reflecting, referring, or relating to any direct or indirect sources of money or other things of value received by or provided to" [...] an individual or members of his family during a 3-year period ... is the functional equivalent of the preparation of an answer to either a detailed written interrogatory or a series of oral questions at a discovery deposition. Entirely apart from the contents of the 13,120 pages of materials that respondent produced in this case, it is undeniable that providing a catalog of existing documents fitting within any of the 11 broadly worded subpoena categories could provide a prosecutor with a [...] "lead to incriminating evidence," [...] or [...] "a link in the chain of evidence needed to prosecute." ...|$|R

The survey was conducted in late 1998 using {{a random sample of}} families that were on welfare in August 1997, the month before Wisconsin implemented its welfare replacement program, Wisconsin Works (W– 2). The survey was conducted to examine the conversion process from welfare to W– 2. In the analy-sis presented here, the survey’s seven housing questions were used as a lens through which to view family circumstances. The results show that roughly a quarter of the respondents had worst-case housing needs.

40|$|Not much {{attention}} has been paid to the ways in which interpreters are currently being used in the conduct of federal household surveys. Many of these surveys entail personal interviews and are conducted largely by monolingual, Englishspeaking field interviewers. When a monolingual English-speaking field interviewer encounters a household in which the adult members speak little or no English, he or she must rely on someone (an interpreter) who speaks the target language of the <b>respondent</b> for <b>assistance</b> in conducting the interview. Given the increase in the size of the non-English-speaking population in the United States, the ways in which interpreters are used, their training, and their qualifications for playing this role should be of key interest to federal statistical agencies that take pride in the quality of the survey data they collect. This paper discusses the role of interpreters in federal survey interviews, and shows the need to develop guidelines for selecting, training, and evaluating interpreters to ensure the quality of data collected from non-English-speaking households. This study is based on results from a web search of best practices in using interpreters by survey organizations around the world and on observations of Census Bureau field staff conducting interviews with non-English-speaking respondents. 1...|$|R
40|$|Data from 32 {{in-depth}} interviews with abused women in outreach groups demonstrated that <b>respondents</b> first sought <b>assistance</b> from informal helpers {{by telling the}} stories of their violent experiences. Telling was a significant social act since it made public their “fictions of intimacy” (Tifft 1993), affected {{their perceptions of their}} relationships, and altered others' definitions of the couple. In part because help providers often reduced the complexity of intimate relationships to incidents of violence, well-intentioned help provision frequently had unintended negative consequences. It was not necessarily the help women wanted and the assistance was often based on a definitional contingency, or acceptance of others' definitions of the situations and others' prescriptions for action. This contingency placed the women in the same relation to the supporters as they were to the abusers, that is, others controlled the definitions of their experiences and their identities...|$|R

As a result, many of these business support programmes are not fully understood therefore not utilised. The study also shows majority of <b>respondents</b> perceived financial <b>assistance</b> is the only type of business support available. Thus, majority of the respondents used financial services (loan) from the government agencies without taking much heed of the other support programmes.

The aim {{of the study was to}} obtain a clear understanding of processes and participant frameworks of decision-making with regard to language support within these institutions. Consequently, a qualitative survey was set up focusing on three selected geographic regions and, within these regions, on four domains of public service (health, education, public administration and employment <b>assistance).</b> <b>Respondents</b> were both institutional end users and immigrants. The results reveal a lack of national and local organizational policy and explicit procedures in the allocation of language support resources. This lack contributes to inequality in foreign language users’ access to the services of public institutions. It is recommended that a self-reflective framework be introduced for regulating access to a more systematic use of community interpreting alongside other instruments or strategies for bridging language barriers. Such a framework should be tailored to the needs of the institution’s clients and to domain-specific and local needs of the institution. It should also include the relative availability of other adequate instruments for bridging language barriers...|$|R
40|$|The {{overriding}} aim of {{this investigation}} was to develop implications for providing a number of personal support services to people living in small remote service towns {{on the basis of a}} descriptive analysis of their anticipated support sources for a variety of needs. 186 children and childrearers living in 45 non-Aboriginal and partly Aboriginal families in three similar small service towns in remote Far North and North-west Queensland, Australia, were interviewed about their anticipated supports for 26 different needs. Respondents were also asked about the anticipated contribution of these supports to resolving their problems and their reasons for choosing them. A cross-sectional census design was used, with most data being collected through partly structured individual interviews. Needs investigated concerned: representation for five shared community concerns (deficiencies in health, education, child care and essential services, and the local unemployment problem); personal unemployment; legal, health and education problems: child development emotional, psychological, social integration and childrearer relationship problems; temporary and prolonged, occasional and constant child care assistance; and temporary and prolonged assistance with household chores, destitution, accommodation, and in the event of the incapacity of one's partner. Results were similar for the three towns, for different kinds of residents and for both the Dry and Wet seasons. Respondents chose formal service organisations for needs requiring political representation, needs which are generally regarded in Australian society as requiring expert professional intervention, and those for which widely recognised and accepted formal services exist. Among natural supports, respondents strongly preferred to seek help from intimate associates, usually close relatives or friends, especially for needs which were personally embarrassing, socially stigmatised, highly demanding of supports, and/or highly dependency creating. Respondents chose both local and non-local supports, whether these were formal organisations or natural sources. Distance from supports neither left <b>respondents</b> without <b>assistance</b> nor reduced its effectiveness. They used locally available formal services. Distance did not affect support-seeking from natural supports for highly embarrassing, stigmatised, demanding and/or dependency creating needs. However, local natural sources were preferred for other needs where local availability was an important consideration. There were no local key helpers for these sub-populations. Twelve principles for resourcing the provision of personal support to residents of these towns are presented and implications for a number of human services are developed. It is suggested that for Australian remote areas the concept of 'linking' formal services with natural and informal supports should be replaced with a more detailed, complex and extensive 'interweaving' model; and that a 'community oriented' model of service provision should not be entirely locality-based but should include relationships between residents and non-local people and organisations...|$|R

They tend to be young, single, sexually active and highly mobile and may stay away from their home. This study assessed HIV/AIDS knowledge and attitude among recruits at Nigerian Army Depot in Zaria Nigeria. It was a cross sectional descriptive study carried out February 2011 using 300 structured, self-administered questionnaires. Majority of the respondents (80. 3 %) were within the age bracket of 20 - 24 years with mean age of 21. 8 ± 2. 0 years, 93 % single and 53. 3 % secondary school graduate. Majority of the respondents (91. 0 %) have heard of HIV/AIDS, while {{a lot of them}} (72. 6 %) knew those that are victims of the disease. Majority of the respondents (74. 3 %) also knew that HIV/AIDS was caused by virus. On the overall, only 48. 7 % of the respondents had good knowledge of the disease.

Yet agricultural cooperative create the ability for the supply of required agricultural inputs so that production of commodities is done timely to enhance productivity. They also provide an assured market for commodities produced by isolated small farmers in the rural areas. This paper was determined to evaluate the effects of cooperative societies on members output. The researchers administered a total of one hundred and twenty-six 126 questionnaires to the <b>respondents</b> with the <b>assistance</b> of the divisional cooperative officers. The hypotheses were analyzed through the use of t-test statistic and regression analysis. Results showed that the various Services rendered by farmers cooperative to their members include agric credit improved seedlings fertilizer and market access.

They disagree that they have Access to emerging markets and Access to Extension services. Hence the need to adopt cooperative as a platform for improving farmers productivity and output in Awka South L. G. A of Anambra state. As such the researchers therefore recommends that the Anambra State government should encourage research development and provision of adequate extension services to cooperative farmers through the Ministry in charge of cooperative in the state.

40|$|This {{research}} set out {{to examine}} in detail how eight first-time entrepreneurs went about finding out what they felt they needed to know during {{the first months of}} their business's operation, and in particular how they constructed their problems or questions in discourse and how they went about addressing them. Based on Brenda Dervin's Sense-Making methodology and work by Pamela McKenzie, the research involved semi-structured interviews in which participants were invited to recount specific instances of problems or questions they had experienced in their business. Data analysis involved close reading of both the interview transcripts and the researcher's notes and observations in order to draw out key themes and enable analysis of the discursive practices respondents used, particularly in privileging some information sources over others. The research found that the respondents experienced questions and problems largely relating to a small number of business issues, principally around the mechanics of setting up a company, deciding what kinds of services to provide and learning about the market environment in which they were operating. Like other studies of the information behaviour of small business owners, the research found that all of the respondents reported acting on information obtained from friends, colleagues or family. Most had consulted professional advisors, and all but one talked of using the Internet as a source of information. Only one <b>respondent</b> had sought <b>assistance</b> from an enterprise agency. The objectives of this research were twofold; to gather information about the actual behaviour of new entrepreneurs, and to test the potential usefulness of the sense-making methodology to an understanding of new business owners' information needs.

In Tanzania the Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR) is presently 578 per 100, 000 live births in Tanzania mainland and 377 per 100000 live births in Zanzibar. The single most critical intervention for safe motherhood is to ensure that women receive care during delivery by skilled health personnel. However only 47 % of women in Tanzania deliver at a health facility. In Tanzania and especially Zanzibar we see a dearth of research on maternal health and especially choices made by the users or potential users of maternal health services. This study therefore aimed to find out the factors influencing choice of delivery place among mothers in Zanzibar north region. It also addressed the levels of patient satisfaction with services either in the health facility or at home compared to the birth experiences of those who changed birth place in the last five years. The methodology used was a cross sectional survey using a questionnaire with closed and open ended questions which was administered to 300 <b>respondents</b> with the <b>assistance</b> of four research assistants. Analysis was done by entering the data in spss program and generating appropriate outputs for reporting and discussion. 56. 7 % of the respondents delivered the last born child at home. The factors affecting this choice were found to be spouse's education, parity, ward of residence and cost of delivery. Also significant were employment status, mothers' education, ANC attendance and marital status. The most common reason found for health facility delivery was that the health facility is a safer place to deliver while the most commonly stated reason for home deliveries were the cost of health facility delivery being too high and the distance to the health facility being too far. Satisfaction with birth experience was high both for those who delivered in the health facility and at home. For those who delivered at home there were high satisfaction levels with the services provided by the TBA if present. It is recommended that the government should provide sufficient delivery supplies to the public health facilities so that delivery services can in reality be free. There should also be continuing research on women's perspectives regarding their needs...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. P. P. A., Public Policy and Administration) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2010. The Republican and Democratic Party {{engage the}} most active {{courtship}} in American politics, namely the repeated attempts to woo Latino voters. While the Latino population exhibits high levels of religiosity, presents itself as displaying more concern for family values, and evinces more conservative political attitudes around the issues of abortion, gay marriage and divorce, the majority of registered Latino voters affiliate with the Democratic Party. This paradox leaves the Republican Party having to court a population that espouses attitudes generally more reflective of its own platform. Population projections show that the Latino population will significantly grow over the coming years, increasing the Latino influence on American political institutions. This study examines the factors causing conservative Latinos to affiliate or lean toward the Democratic Party. Using data obtained from the Pew Hispanic Center, affiliation with the Democratic Party is modeled using crosstabulation and regression analysis with various broad casual inputs (affluence, familial status, attachment to the United States, demographics, culture and political attitudes). The statistical analysis is used to test several hypotheses from social identity theory regarding whether conservative Latinos see themselves {{as part of an}} ???in-group??? associated with the larger Latino population who are mostly Democrats, or if they see themselves part of an ???in-group??? based on religious identity. The results of the study demonstrate that eleven explanatory variables serve as predictors of partisanship (age, respondents with a Cuban and Mexican family heritage, income, respondents opposing the death penalty, respondents downplaying Latino discrimination, respondents opposing gay marriage, respondents with exposure to a place of worship speaking out on the issue of immigration, respondents believing the poor have it easy because of government <b>assistance,</b> <b>respondents</b> asserting religion is unimportant in influencing their political thinking and respondents considering themselves to be ???Hispanic/Latino??? before identifying themselves in terms of their country, religion or being an American. Both the regression and crosstabulation results support the hypothesis that conservative Latinos affiliate with the Democratic Party because the Latino population as a whole does. There was no evidence suggesting that conservative Latinos form partisanship based on religious identity. 	 If party affiliation is based on social identity, Republican efforts to educate conservative Latinos about the Party???s platform are unlikely to succeed at recruiting more Latinos to the Republican Party.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{generally}} accepted within the {{developed and developing}} {{countries of the world}} that SMES contributes significantly to employment creation as the world population increases and that it also contributes to the economic growth of the areas they are situated in. Finance is the blood (life) of any business, for a business to be successful it needs steady successful access to funds and post financial support which leads to actualization of ideas, leads to investment and expansion, improves access to market amongst others. This is why the impact of development finance can never be over emphasized. The aims of the study are: To understand the extent to which small and medium businesses are supported through the availability of financial assistance in Matjabeng Municipality. To establish the survival rates of businesses that has been funded and or supported and whether they are or not sustainable. In achieving the aims and objectives of the research, the researcher looked at development funds both from the supply side and the demand side. The supply side which involved semi structured interviews with consultants of government parastatals (the FDC and DETEA) who are involved in financing Small Medium Enterprises in Matjhabeng municipality. The demand side involved administering of questionnaires to Entrepreneurs in the municipality who are registered with the Local Economic Department (LED), which led to the acceptance of the hypothesis of the research that development finance actually helps in the growth of small medium enterprises but in conjunction with post financial support such as bookkeeping, accounting, monitoring and evaluation. The researcher also discovered some findings amongst others which includes: The most effective ways entrepreneurs heard about funding in the municipality are through the media and word of mouth. Most of the entrepreneurs that received some type of funding are startups. More entrepreneurs that had access to funds also got some post financial business support. Financial assistance to entrepreneurs yielded improvements after <b>respondents</b> received financial <b>assistance,</b> the range of goods offered was improved and more jobs were created, entrepreneurs were able to obtain better business premises either by renting or buying and entrepreneurs had access to better equipment. Some of the recommendations of this study includes; The municipal government should help small and medium enterprises in the municipality by linking them to new markets. Effective monitoring and evaluation systems should be put in place by development funders and non-financial support services. Entrepreneurial skills development should be provided by the public and private agencies by organizing workshops for aspiring entrepreneurs in order to expose them to business opportunities that are sustainable and viable...|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{bachelor}} work is to stroke, its impact on individuals and families. This topic is relevant. CMP {{is one of the}} most common causes of death and disability in the Czech Republic and worldwide. CMP is not a matter only of the individual but also his entire family. The theoretical part of the thesis is divided into nine basic categories. The first circuit characterizes and divides the typology, describes the symptoms and examination methods CMP. In the second circuit we learn how to recognize stroke and first aid in the development of stroke. Third circuit includes the risk factors that may be controllable and uncontrollable. The following ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke (here are described the types CMP). Other circuits are CMP impacts (impacts are fundamentally different, so it is important to their description), family and CMP (important is family involvement in care and the impacts associated with the position of careers), rehabilitation after stroke (focusing more resources on social rehabilitation) and forms social assistance (which are the most common forms of assistance). The aim of this thesis is to determine as stroke affected social interaction in the family. A partial goal is to find out what are the possibilities of social assistance. Depending on the objectives set by the two research questions. The main research question is: How have social interaction within the family changed after a stroke? Partial research task asks how welfare assistance was realized in the family. Qualitative research was chosen in the thesis. When data collection method was used interviews and semi-structured interview technique. The sample consisted of 5 respondents who had stroke and his family was willing to cooperate in collecting data. Respondents were selected target (intentional) choice. When evaluating the quality of the data was carried out by cluster. The results are organized into two blocks. The first section concerns subjective opinion of an individual to experience a stroke. Results are for greater clarity divided into circuits. The first circuit includes demographic data of respondents and their lifestyle before going through the CMP. The following circuit shows the risk factors that influence the emergence of a stroke. Other circuits have dealt with CMP and its impacts, the use of components of comprehensive rehabilitation, assistance from family, communications, public relations, social impacts and the situation at present. The second part deals with the subjective opinions of family members on the situation of the family after suffering stroke. Circuits with family members are divided on adoption diseases affected; the financial decline in the family, careers isolation from society and family, whether they were given the necessary information about the CMP. The research implies that the respondents' lack of awareness of the consequences of risk factors that may be the cause of stroke. None of the clients did not know about the causes (risk factors) CMP. Only in case of two clients there was a consensus that they knew about the mortality associated with going through the CMP. Other respondents did not know that their lifestyle and some diseases lead to stroke. The research showed that 4 clients do not know about the use of social services for the issue, but also showed that 3 family members and some respondents were given the necessary information from the staff of many medical and social institutions. All respondents used at least two components of comprehensive rehabilitation. In addition, <b>respondents</b> agreed that <b>assistance</b> from family was very good. Intended use of the acquired knowledge of the thesis will be to utilize as resource for individuals and families after stroke and also for professional and the general public...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{bachelor}} thesis called "Expectations of Female Clients of the Professional Social Counselling In Their Difficult Life Situation" is to cover what kind or form of help these clients expect. The thesis is devided into two large parts. The theoretical part comprises of four main chapters. The first chapter ís called "Counselling in Social Services", and specifies professional social counselling and connected topics, such as counselling relationship, professionality and personality of the counsellor, counselling dialogue and working with orders. The second chapter defines the term "Difficult Life Situation". The third chapter lists situations which {{can be seen as}} difficult {{in the life of a}} woman. Possible support and help within social work is outlined for each target group, too. The last chapter covers work of Counselling Center Eva, Diocesan Charity in České Budějovice. The research part is based on findings from this counselling center, where the respondents of the research are registered as clients. The practical part is based on realised qualitative research. Six respondents were questioned in semistructured interview in the qualitative research. The interviews were recorded, under the consent of the respondents, and transcriptions into written form were carried out subsequently. The written form was processed by open coding. Four categories connected to the research question were identified by the method of analysis. The categories are: Expected form of help, Expectations in relationship to the center, Expectations in relationship to the social workers, and Emotions connected to the process of counselling. Results of the research showed that within the professional social counselling, the respondents are interested in covering the topics of benefits, doles, financies and debt counselling, as well as employment. It was further proved that it is important for the <b>respondents</b> to have <b>assistance</b> of the social workers when making phone calls and dealing with documents. Apart from social counselling, the respondents also expect material help. Very important aid, which is higly appreciated and expected for the future, appears to be the services of Voluntary Center of Diocesan Charity in České Budějovice. The second identified category Expectations in relationship to the center showed that the respondents see the center as a Lighthouse and Sanctuary. For them, the counselling center is a place where they hope to find assurance, stability, confidence and unconditional acceptance. What came out as interesting is that four respondents reflected the change of social workers within the center. This change caused confusion to two of the respondents. The third important identified category, which also brings evidence about expectations of female clients, is Expectations in relationship to the social workers. Different roles and forms of help are expected from the social workers. Among the roles defined belong Professional advisor, Mediator, Investigator, Initiator, Close person, Filter of emotions, Human being, and also social worker as a Strange person, which has not always been percieved as positive, as this is connected to declaration of the client as fit to work and her own responsibility. The last additional category is Emotions connected to the counselling process. All the respondents expressed satisfaction, gratitude and appreciation of the work of the center. This category therefore shows that the respondents are satisfied with the help, the social workers, and the work of the center in all cases, and that the work of the social workers is evaluated positively. The results can serve not only as feedback for the head office and all the workers of the Counselling Center Eva, Diocesan Charity in České Budějovice, but for other organisations with similar scope of activities. The results also bring recommendations which could be used by the social workers in their future counselling relationships...|$|R
40|$|EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The {{efficient}} use of new {{information and communication technologies}} can be of crucial importance in emergency response and crisis communications. New media applications are able to perform a range of functions such as facilitating two-way communication, enabling citizens and first <b>respondents</b> to request/offer <b>assistance,</b> enhance campaigning activities for fund raising purposes, and enable individuals/groups to efficiently organize for action. Likewise, social networking, crowdsourcing, and data mining technologies offer new means through which different stakeholders, such as officials, responders, citizens, can gather and disseminate information so as to optimize emergency response. Yet, new media technologies, and particularly social media, may often be misused, either intentionally or unintentionally in ways that can impede efficient communication during emergencies and crises. The present “Report on the adverse use and reliability of new media” (D 2. 3) aims to provide an overview the adverse use of new media by scammers, hackers, terrorist groups, ordinary citizens, as well as, at times, government authorities and companies. The report also aims to provide an in-depth discussion of an issue that users of new media technologies face in the utilization of such technologies during crises and emergencies: reliability of information. Following a brief introduction (Chapter 1), the report will comprise three chapters. In Chapter 2, the report will focus on types of misuse of new media and their management. The first two sections of Chapter 2 will consider misuse of new media technologies along two axes: types of misuse and players in misuse. In the first section of the chapter, the report will focus on are misrepresentation, rumor spreading, propaganda, surveillance and censorship, and lateral surveillance. After discussing these misuse types, the section to follow will proceed with an analysis of key “players” in misuse of new media technologies. Using examples from case studies of emergencies and crises conducted by the COSMIC team in Deliverable 2. 2., as well as examples form other recent emergencies and crises (such as the Arab Spring and Hurricane Katrina) the chapter will describe the role that scammers, hackers, government authorities, and private corporations may play both as misusers and responders, depending on the circumstances. In the final section of Chapter 2, the report will discuss how different stakeholders try to manage misuse of new media. In terms of management of misuse, the report distinguished between external threats as those that come from the outside a given system or organization and internal threats that come from within an organization. In this section, particular {{attention has been paid to}} the concept of sousveillance, which can be defined as surveillance from below (performed by the public on institutions) as an approach that can increase the accountability of powerful players and prevent abuse of power. Also, the report discussed new countersurveillance techniques that can protect citizens’ right to privacy and free speech at times of crises (specifically political crises). Finally, discussion of management of internal threats underlined how datamining techniques can be used for early detection and prevention of misuse during times of crises. An important lesson learned from the discussion on Chapter 2 is that in many cases, while trying to respond to potential misuses of information, various stakeholders, including government authorities, may themselves hinder effective utilization of new media technologies for crises communication. Hence, a proper approach to management of misuse of new media technologies should definitely involve multitude of stakeholders, and particularly supranational organizations, that can provide a system of checks and balances. The focus of Chapter 3 was dissemination of misinformation via new media technologies at times of crises and techniques that can be used by various stakeholders (including citizens and mainstream journalists) to verify information. In this chapter, specific attention was paid to primary data collected from Internet users about reliability of information during the Gezi Protests that took place in Turkey in 2013. The findings from these data suggest that while Internet users are aware of the potential pitfalls of relying on the Internet for information about crises and emergencies, they often see the Internet as a more viable choice for up to date information when compared to mainstream media. Moreover, the data suggests that a considerable proportion of users engage in techniques to actively verify the information they receive. However, some of these techniques may end up amplifying the problem of dissemination of misinformation. As such, development and widespread adoption of technologies that can assist stakeholders in information verification is needed. Given this need, Chapter 3 concludes with an overview of some of the technologies (e. g., Semantically Interlinked Online Communities-SIOC), applications (e. g., Hoodcast) and techniques (crowdsourcing) that can be viable options to assist not only citizens but all stakeholders who utilize new media for getting information during times of emergencies and crises. Based on these analyses, the last chapter (Conclusion) provides a summary of key insights regarding misuse of new media technologies during crisis, management of misuse and information verification. Also, the last chapter proposes a set of principles that can guide future efforts to alleviate the adverse uses of new media described in the report...|$|R

On the 9 -items the Mean was found 4. 29, 4. 35, 4. 50, 4. 17, 4. 44, 4. 23, 4. 31, 4. 28 and 3. 86 {{respectively}} which were not consistence with either the original Dutch or later validated Spanish, Turkish, Nigerian or Bangla version [15, 17, 18, 22] but the German Validation study showed means of the 9 -items which were almost similar to this study[16]. It was seemed to be found that the respondents chose to answer “mostly appropriate” in this particular study. However, as observed by Arafat SMY et al, {{most of the people}} in Bangladesh has the perception that the role of the physicians here are motivated by financial gain only and thus not fully justified which often leads to violence against doctor as well as the health services providers which do not completely fit with the result of this particular study [9]. Also, the doctor lives a hectic life in the country and the overwhelming number of patients per physician also make it difficult to provide quality and patient-centered care [1]. The overall result of the study might not reflect the picture on basis of the currently available literature in this context. Limitations of the Study The majority of the data was collected from private chamber setting which might have been the cause of a result not in line with the other articles. Moreover, in some <b>respondents</b> <b>assistance</b> was provided to fill out the questionnaire. Conclusion The result from the analysis indicated a better level of satisfaction among the patients which was not quite in line with the premeditated concept of the authors as it did not fall in line with the available data. Despite this fact, the Bangla validated the version of PDRQ- 9 was found as a very helpful as an instrument for assessing the relationship between patient and doctor in a very short time and both in public and private health care facility. As the scale bears only patients perspective it was very proficient for measuring patient satisfaction. In a developing country like Bangladesh, future large-scale studies to substantiate the findings of this particular study and further evaluate the patient satisfaction on the basis of patient-doctor relationship may provide a clearer picture.
