25|$|The {{spirits of}} the air above are {{believed}} to be the most powerful of the lesser spirits, while there are also spirits associated with clan-spears names such as WiW, a spirit of war, associated with thunder.

The flesh is committed to the earth, while the breath or life goes back to God (Kuoth).

25|$|Gampopa (12th century), one of {{the main}} early masters of the Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism, {{followed}} the Indian Buddhist tradition, starting with the 3rd-century Hinayana texts of Vasubandhu, that oral and anal sex, whether with <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman,</b> are violations of the third precept regarding inappropriate sexual behavior. Longchenpa, the 13th-century founder of the Nyingma school, citing the 3rd-century Mahayana texts of the Indian master Asanga, elaborated that inappropriate sexual behavior also include the hands among inappropriate parts of the body for sexual activity. In the same way, Gelug predecessor Je Tsongkhapa also adheres to such rules in his studies.|$|E
25|$|During reincarnation {{consciousness}} {{tries to}} liberate {{itself from the}} burden of collected impressions. Yet, since it tries to achieve this by associating itself with impressions opposite from the previously accumulated ones, it gets further entangled in accumulating fresh impressions. Thus the soul experiences itself in a seemingly endless succession of human lives, as <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman,</b> as rich or poor, strong or weak, beautiful or ugly, black or white, in various places, religions, castes etc. It is only after numerous apparent births and deaths, that the range of human experience starts to get exhausted. In this way the soul starts dissociating itself from the gross world, enabling its consciousness {{to become aware of}} the subtle sphere.|$|E

25|$|For lay Buddhists, marital {{fidelity}} {{is traditionally}} {{considered to be}} part of Right Action, part of the Eightfold Path. Specifically, it is considered part of the avoidance of sexual misconduct (kamesu miccha-cara veramani in Pali), which defines who is an illicit or inappropriate sexual partner for <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman,</b> depending on their marital status, age, etc. Different Buddhist-influenced cultures have interpreted the specifics of this prohibition differently with respect to practices like multiple marriage and concubinage; in 2015, for example, a Japanese court ruled that paying for prostitution did not constitute adultery, though traditional rules of sexual misconduct forbid a man from having sex with a woman who might be obliged to him for financial reasons.|$|E

500|$|Screen Rant {{wrote of}} the character: [...] "Rather than {{beginning}} the series {{in a state of}} potential heroism, Alex begins the series as a potential villain. And yet, Alex is still a hero. Everything that follows is a desperate attempt at survival and at remaining one step ahead of those who are trying to harm her. In fact, Alex's narrative is one in which she is nearly immediately immersed in adventure and thrown headfirst into chaos." [...] The character is also opinionated and outspoken. Chopra said [...] "Alex is someone with a point of a view and she's a woman with an opinion {{and at the same time}} she's not afraid of being who she is.

500|$|Before Crisis is a {{real-time}} action role-playing game featuring 2D graphics as {{the player}} moves {{along in a}} side-scrolling manner.

[...] "Episode Mode" [...] involves the player playing through the game's main storyline, completing various objectives {{in order to continue}} on in the game.

Players can choose to manually attack an enemy during combat or press the action key to automatically attack the nearest enemy.|$|E
500|$|The initialisms LGBT or GLBT are not {{agreed to}} by {{everyone}} that they encompass. For example, some argue that transgender and transsexual causes {{are not the same}} as that of lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) people. This argument centers on the idea that transgenderism and transsexuality have to do with gender identity, or a person's understanding of being or not being <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> irrespective of their sexual orientation. LGB issues can be seen as a matter of sexual orientation or attraction. These distinctions have been made in the context of political action in which LGB goals, such as same-sex marriage legislation and human rights work (which may not include transgender and intersex people), may be perceived to differ from transgender and transsexual goals. Another problem associated is that people may not always identify with the given labels. One study conducted in Australia discovered that all the participants had experienced microaggressions, bullying and anti-social behaviours. However, not all of the participants believed their victimisation to be motivated by anti-LGBTIQ beliefs. What it did establish is that many of these microaggressions occurred due to misconceptions and conflicting opinions on what these labels entailed (in particular, transsexual and bisexual). Evidently, by placing blanket labels on many people, who all experience difference narratives, there are inconsistencies.|$|E

[...] I did not imagine life could be this amazing many years ago after being released from a horrid Nigerian prison for being different. Then all I could think was I could die in this prison and no one will know or care. [...] Being imprisoned felt justifiable, considering I was being punished for being 'gay' as they assumed due to my feminine features and mannerisms. [...] I wasn't gay, I am a woman born differently due to natural defects. What I felt did not match my outward appearance. Being assigned male at birth doesn't make me <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman,</b> nobody was born <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman,</b> you are born male or female, then you develop into your preferred gender as you grow up thus making you <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman.</b> For me that gender was female. I was born male but my brain, gestures, features and carriage functioned as that of a female. Growing up and not knowing what was happening to my body made me confused and lost. I couldn't discuss it with my family because my femininity was frowned upon due to religion and I could not talk to my friends because they would not understand what I was going through.
