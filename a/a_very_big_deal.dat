500|$|Tickets for European shows {{first went}} on sale in mid-March, with high demand. Shows in Gothenburg, Amsterdam and Milan sold out {{reasonably}} fast, with second dates being added in each city; those also sold out quickly. In The Netherlands, demand rendered all of KPN's 0900 paid service numbers unreachable. The nearly 90,000 tickets for the opening concert in Barcelona were sold in 54 minutes, establishing a new record for concerts in Spain. The tour set a record by selling 650,000 tickets in seven hours. Regarding the quick sellout of two Croke Park shows in Dublin, Bono said: [...] "It's overwhelming, really. It's <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>big</b> <b>deal</b> for us to sell-out our hometown at such speed, it's unbelievable. ... We don't take anything for granted."

The Croke Park shows later won Top Boxscore at the 2009 Billboard Touring Awards.|$|E

40|$|This short {{paper on}} <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>big</b> subject <b>deals</b> with <b>a</b> worry - a {{worry that the}} present {{economic}} crisis is likely {{to contribute to the}} already-existing temptations of governmental and private actors alike to behave in a time-inconsistent fashion when responding to the challenge of climate change. The specific concern here is that science and technology research commitments be launched soon enough on the scale that is likely to be needed, and that timely steps be taken toward the supportive adaptations in long-standing institutional and regulatory readjustments that can render those investments in knowledge more effective. Institutional changes, new incentive mechanisms and a rethinking of national policies with regard to exploitation of the international regime of intellectual property protections - are needed to successfully address the looming crisis of global climate change.

However, when he rushes to the hospital to learn how he is doing, Oliver is not allowed to know any details about Christian's condition as he's not a relative. When Christian goes to Sebastian von Lahnstein to file documents to fix any future health concerns for them hospital-wise as a couple, Miriam suggests marriage to Oliver as an easy fix who responds with excitement to propose to Christian and begins making plans for a romantic proposal. Oliver decorates No Limits in Valentine's Day decorations and proposes to Christian later on during the night, leaving Christian clearly shocked. He then says yes to Oliver's proposal. The two go on to start making plans for their wedding and despite having different views on a wedding - Christian wanting a small and private wedding whereas Oliver wants it to be <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>big</b> public <b>deal,</b> the two learn to compromise for each other.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{conduct the}} {{flexibility}} study in a utility plant for the largescale chemical production site. It {{is known that}} utility plant is usually designed based on its nominal operating condition with attractive economic return. However, because of the fluctuating supply / demand on raw material / product (uncertainty) for the site, {{it is difficult to}} design the high efficiency and flexible utility plant. Principally, a good plant design should not only show an optimal balance between capital and operating costs, it must also show an feasibility characteristics which allows economic performance to be applicable in a general operating environment. Hence, the ultimate goal is let plant professionals plan, monitor and manage the plant flexibility in which the future supplies and demands are under uncertainties. For that reason, we would like to introduce an uncertainty study to stabilize the “Utility Plant Flexibility”. In fact, by ignoring the historical data of variations, the plant professionals of course can build <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>big</b> plant to <b>deal</b> with all the uncertain situations; however this kind of movement is definitely impractical and inefficient. Thus, the first step we have to define “Flexibility does not imply oversize design of utility plant”. This paper will introduce a new concept to measure the utility plant flexibility based upon the uncertain parameters. Basically the concept is foundation on the Grossmann's idea on flexibility measurement. It is believed that with proper flexible operation in the utility plant, the overall energy usage will be rationalized that generates merit to the company. © 2007 Elsevier B. V.

To {{children and young people}} that are questioning their sexuality or know for their sexuality, if they can look at someone and see themselves in Jamal, that's incredible. I embrace that fully." [...] Jussie Smollett, Television Critics Association Winter Preview (2015) Jamal's sexuality is a point of contention very early on for him and his father, while his mother sees the signs and loves him anyway. Lee Daniels made a conscious effort to remove the [...] "stereotype" [...] from Jamal's sexuality. [...] "Look... there are all different types of gay people" [...] Daniels remarked. Smollett said the show is [...] "not shoving anything down your throat. It's not preaching, it's not telling you the way you should feel about a certain issue, but it is giving you options. Lee Daniels holds up the mirror to us as human beings." [...] Thanks to his own experience as a gay man, Daniels is able to construct the world of Empire around Jamal who is written as a [...] "down-the-middle, well-mannered, even-keeled, guy-next-door type." [...] Daniels wanted to [...] "normalize" [...] gay romances, specifically between men of color. Show runner Ilene Chaiken said [...] "We're going to go places with Jamal that are unexpected and that you've never seen a television show go -- certainly not on a broadcast television show -- with a gay black character... Maybe not with any gay character, frankly." [...] Daniels said [...] "Homophobia is rampant in the African-American community" [...] and using the character of Jamal, [...] "I wanted to blow the lid off it." [...] "We are behind closed doors in a family situation and trying to tell it as honestly as possible. The things my father said to me because of homophobia frightened the devil out of me." [...] said Terrence Howard. He continued, [...] "What we're really trying to do... is give people an opportunity to see what they're doing is painful. It's crushing someone that could be beautiful." [...] The scene in which Lucious throws a 4-year-old Jamal into a trash can after Jamal dresses up in Cookie's heels comes from actual events from Daniels own childhood. While Jamal's sexuality is known in his personal life, Ilene Chaiken explained that Jamal is [...] "coming out to the world which not everybody gets." [...] However, {{it would be very difficult}} for Jamal not only as an artist, but also as the son of someone with such fame. In addition, Jamal is black and he is a part of the hip-hop community. This is <b>a</b> [...] "very, <b>very</b> <b>big</b> <b>deal</b> and it's <b>a</b> huge story to tell" [...] Chaiken said. However, Jamal wants to come out on his own terms, and that causes some trouble for him. According to Smollett, Jamal changes his mind about coming out in episode 102, [...] "The Outspoken King" [...] because [...] "It just wasn't the right time for him, especially to do it in such a grand way -- with the press conference and the performance. That was a show! That's not Jamal." ...|$|R

50|$|After some futile {{attempts}} to thrive as an actor, a comedian or a playwright he started writing pulp fiction. Those were {{the times when}} a gret deal of Germans read pulp fiction {{on a regular basis}} because there was only one TV programme. Höber gained the attention of Gustav Lübbe when he was looking for somebody who could deliver new adventures of Jerry Cotton. The first author of Jerry Cotton had grown tired of his creation and of writing pulp fiction in general. Höber became his successor and led Jerry Cotton to new heights. He worked diligently on the new stories and driven by his ambitions to walk in the footsteps of Karl May he did not only <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>big</b> <b>deal</b> of research on the FBI and on New York, but also invented an American Indian sidekick called Zeerokah for Jerry Cotton. But in opposite to Karl May he didn't reach any fame because allegedly the G-man Jerry Cotton wrote all his tales himself. Also Höber received only an all-inclusive fee for each novel, not considering the amplitude of the publisher's profit. So Heinz Werner Höber followed his cherished idol Karl May another time by meeting his own publisher at court. He demanded recognition as the main author of Jerry Cotton and {{a significant part of the}} profit. Since he was neither the actual creator of Jerry Cotton nor at any time the only author of this series (although he was considered the probably most productive and certainly most committed of the altogether about 100 writers) and because he had never been promised to get named or to obtain royalties, the trial did not make him rich but ruined him. Still he had eventually reached a high profile, could publish books under his real name and won the highly accredited Glauser Award.|$|E
