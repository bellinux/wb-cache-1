No wonder if, {{in such a state}} of things, the minds of men were stirred by a passion akin to despair, which ended in a new and grand form of suicide. It would have ended often, but for Christianity, in such an actual despair as that which had led in past ages more than one noble Roman to slay himself, when he lost all hope for the Republic. Christianity taught those who despaired of society, of the world--in one word, of the Roman Empire, and all that it had done for men--to hope at least for a kingdom of God after death. It taught those who, had they been heathens and brave enough, would have slain themselves to escape out of a world which was no place for honest men, that the body must be kept alive, if for no other reason, at least {{for the sake of the}} immortal soul, doomed, according to its works, to endless bliss or endless torment.|$|E

25|$|Another {{effect of}} Julian's {{political}} philosophy {{was that the}} authority of the cities was expanded {{at the expense of the}} imperial bureaucracy as Julian sought to reduce direct imperial involvement in urban affairs. For example, city land owned by the imperial government was returned to the cities, city council members were compelled to resume civic authority, often against their will, and the tribute in gold by the cities called the aurum coronarium was made voluntary rather than a compulsory <b>tax.</b> Additionally, <b>arrears</b> <b>of</b> land <b>taxes</b> were cancelled. This was a key reform reducing the power of corrupt imperial officials, as the unpaid taxes on land were often hard to calculate or higher than the value of the land itself.

5000|$|Sa'ad al-Dawla ibn Hibbat Allah ibn Muhasib Ebheri (سعد الدولة بن هبة الله بن محاسب ابهري) (c. 1240 [...] - [...] March 5, 1291) was a Jewish {{physician}} and statesman in thirteenth-century Persia. He was grand vizier from 1289 to 1291 under the Mongolian Ilkhan in Persia, Arghun Khan. According to Abu al-Faraj, Sa'ad was father-in-law of the prefect of Baghdad. Sa'ad held {{a position in}} the treasury department, where he so distinguished himself that the Mongolian governor was jealous and recommended him to court as a physician. Here Sa'ad made a friend of Ordu Kia, a powerful general, and through his influence was sent to collect the <b>arrears</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxes</b> in Baghdad. He was so successful in raising money that Arghun appointed him assistant (musharrif) in the department of finances at Baghdad, Ordu Kia being appointed military governor, or emir, of that province. The historian Wassaf says that Sa'ad cured Arghun of an illness, and, having thus gained his confidence, informed the Ilkhan of the corruption among the officials at Baghdad. At the same time he impressed Arghun with his own ability by his knowledge of the Mongolian and Turkish languages, and by his intimate acquaintance with the conditions existing in the province. He was soon made general controller of the finances of Baghdad, and then of the whole empire, becoming grand vizier. [...] "Thus," [...] remarks Abu al-Faraj, [...] "were the Muslims reduced to having a Jew in the place of honor," [...] a situation which they greatly resented. Arghun, as a Lamaist Buddhist, had no such compunctions.|$|E

5000|$|He was {{contemporary}} with Gungunum, c. 1868 - 1841 BC (short), and {{his successor}} Abī-sarē, c. 1841 - 1830 BC (short), the resurgent kings of Larsa. His reign {{marks the beginning of}} a decline in Isin's fortunes coinciding with a rise in those of Larsa. Gungunum had wrestled Ur from Isin’s control by his 10th year and it is possible this was the cause of Lipit-Ištar’s overthrow. Indeed Ur-Ninurta made a dedicatory gift to the temple of Ningal in Ur during the 9th year of Gungunum. However, Ur-Ninurta continued to mention Ur in his titles ("herdsman of Ur") as did his successors in Isin. Gungunum went on to expand his kingdom, perhaps taking Nippur late in his reign. His death allowed Ur-Ninurta to launch a temporary counter-offensive, recapturing Nippur and several other cities on the Kishkattum canal. His year-name “year (Ur-Ninurta) set for Enlil free (of forced labor) for ever the citizens of Nippur and released (the <b>arrears</b> <b>of)</b> the <b>taxes</b> which they were bearing on their necks” may mark this point. His offensive was stopped at Adab, modern Bismaya, where Abī-sarē “defeated the army of Isin with his weapon,” in the 9th year-name of his reign. It may be that this battle was where he was killed, as a year A of Halium of the kingdom of Mananâ, reads “the year Ur-Ninurta was slain” and Manabalte’el of Kisurra’s year G, “the year Ur-Ninurta was killed.” ...|$|R
40|$|Fifteen {{years into}} its {{economic}} transformation, Poland {{has emerged as}} the European Union member state with the lowest level of fiscalism (in terms of GNP percentage accounting for taxes and social security contributions). At the same time, Poland is among countries with the highest social security premiums and indirect taxes (VAT and excise tax). If this tax structure in Poland were to be retained, or, worse still, if the tax burden were to be further increased, this could have adverse social and economic consequences. The nature <b>of</b> indirect <b>taxes</b> is such that the less affluent the household, the greater the tax burden on the household’s income. The ever increasing level of indirect taxation results in the least affluent households in Poland having to bear the greatest tax burdens, a fact fully confirmed by studies of household expenditures in the years 1994 - 1999. Contrary to the popular perception of the role <b>of</b> indirect <b>taxes</b> in economy (and of VAT in particular), this role is not neutral. Accordingly, it is being proposed to gradually lower the basic VAT rate during the next, say, 10 years, from the current 22 % to 17 %. One result of this move will be improved corporate liquidity, thanks to the “liberation” of part <b>of</b> the <b>taxes</b> due. These “liberated” sums could be used to finance company development or investments. Lowering the basic VAT rate will also boost consumer demand by lowering prices. In turn, the stimulation of consumer demand will improve the fiscal efficiency of VAT, ensuring a stead flow of receipts into the state budget. An urgent problem that requires resolving is the growing volume <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> <b>arrears,</b> especially <b>arrears</b> <b>of</b> indirect <b>taxes.</b> It appears that {{the development and implementation of}} a suitable remedial program is called for, considering that tax arrears in 2004 (close to 20 billion PLN) were almost 12 times the figure in 1995. It is also advisable to discover why excise tax on fuels is accounting for a constantly decreasing percentage <b>of</b> total excise <b>tax</b> income in Poland. While income from excise tax on fuels was constantly rising (nominally) in the period from 1994 to 2004, its share in the total income is constantly dwindling, and this despite the healthy GNP growth rate experienced by this country.

40|$|Russia {{dramatically}} {{reduced its}} higher rates <b>of</b> personal income <b>tax</b> (PIT) in 2001 establishing a single marginal rate {{at the low}} level of 13 percent. In the following year, real revenue from the PIT actually increased by about 26 percent.

But it has been little studied. This paper asks whether the strong revenue performance of the PIT was itself a consequence of this reform, using both macro evidence and, in particular, micro-level data on the experiences of individuals and households affected by the reform to varying degrees. It concludes that {{there is no evidence of}} a strong supply side effect of the reform. Compliance, however, did improve quite substantially-by about one third according to our estimates-though it remains unclear whether this was due to the parametric reforms or to accompanying changes in enforcement.
