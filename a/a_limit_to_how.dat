5|$|In late December, the {{government}} began restoring services gradually. The websites for Xinhua and the People's Daily, two state-controlled media outlets, were made accessible on 28 December, the web portals Sina.com and Sohu.com on 10 January 2010, and 27 more websites on 6 February. But access to websites was only partial: for instance, users could browse forums and blogs but not post on them. China Daily reported that limited e-mail services were also restored in Ürümqi on 8 February, although a BBC reporter writing at approximately the same time said e-mail was not accessible yet. Text messaging on cell phones was restored on 17 January, although there was <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> <b>to</b> <b>how</b> many messages a user could send daily. Internet access was fully restored in May 2010.|$|E
25|$|In {{low-rise}} structures, {{the support}} rooms (chillers, transformers, boilers, pumps and air handling units) {{can be put}} in basements or roof space—areas which have low rental value. There is, however, <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> <b>to</b> <b>how</b> far this plant can be located from the area it serves. The farther away it is the larger the risers for ducts and pipes from this plant to the floors they serve and the more floor area these risers take. In practice this means that in highrise buildings this plant is located on 'plant levels' at intervals up the building.|$|E
25|$|Cho and Garcia-Molina {{proved the}} {{surprising}} result that, {{in terms of}} average freshness, the uniform policy outperforms the proportional policy in both a simulated Web and a real Web crawl. Intuitively, the reasoning is that, as web crawlers have <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> <b>to</b> <b>how</b> many pages they can crawl in a given time frame, (1) they will allocate too many new crawls to rapidly changing pages {{at the expense of}} less frequently updating pages, and (2) the freshness of rapidly changing pages lasts for shorter period than that of less frequently changing pages. In other words, a proportional policy allocates more resources to crawling frequently updating pages, but experiences less overall freshness time from them.|$|E
50|$|Quantum {{indeterminacy}} {{can also}} be illustrated {{in terms of a}} particle with a definitely measured momentum for which there must be <b>a</b> fundamental <b>limit</b> <b>to</b> <b>how</b> precisely its location can be specified. This quantum uncertainty principle can be expressed in terms of other variables, for example, a particle with a definitely measured energy has <b>a</b> fundamental <b>limit</b> <b>to</b> <b>how</b> precisely one can specify how long it will have that energy.The units involved in quantum uncertainty are on the order of Planck's constant (found experimentally to be 6.6 x 10−34 J·s).|$|R
50|$|The {{other problem}} is due <b>to</b> the <b>limits</b> of {{magnetic}} media itself: {{it is only}} possible to write so many polarity changes in {{a certain amount of}} space, so there's <b>an</b> upper <b>limit</b> <b>to</b> <b>how</b> many 1's can also be written sequentially.|$|R
50|$|Capped T&M {{contracts}} work in {{the sense}} of traditional T&M contracts. However, there is <b>an</b> upper <b>limit</b> <b>to</b> <b>how</b> much customers will have to pay. In this way, suppliers benefit with early time-frame changes while customers only have to pay up until the capped cost limit is reached.|$|R
25|$|Lynn and Harvey {{have argued}} that the causes of the above are {{difficult}} to interpret since these countries have had significant recent immigration from countries with lower average national IQs. Nevertheless, they expect that similar patterns will occur, or have occurred, first in other developed nations and then in the developing world as there is <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> <b>to</b> <b>how</b> much environmental factors can improve intelligence. Furthermore, during the last century there is a negative correlation between fertility and intelligence although there is not yet any conclusive evidence of the association between the two. They estimate {{that there has been a}} dysgenic decline in the world's genotypic IQ (masked by the Flynn effect for the phenotype) of 0.86 IQ points per decade for the years 1950–2000.|$|E
25|$|Chemical {{forms of}} {{nitrogen}} {{are most often}} of concern with regard to eutrophication, because plants have high nitrogen requirements so that additions of nitrogen compounds will stimulate plant growth. Nitrogen is not readily available in soil because N2, a gaseous form of nitrogen, is very stable and unavailable directly to higher plants. Terrestrial ecosystems rely on microbial nitrogen fixation to convert N2 into other forms such as nitrates. However, there is <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> <b>to</b> <b>how</b> much nitrogen can be utilized. Ecosystems receiving more nitrogen than the plants require are called nitrogen-saturated. Saturated terrestrial ecosystems then can contribute both inorganic and organic nitrogen to freshwater, coastal, and marine eutrophication, where nitrogen is also typically a limiting nutrient. This {{is also the case}} with increased levels of phosphorus. However, because phosphorus is generally much less soluble than nitrogen, it is leached from the soil at a much slower rate than nitrogen. Consequently, phosphorus is much more important as a limiting nutrient in aquatic systems.|$|E
500|$|General {{inpatient}} care is an intensive {{level of care}} which may be provided in a nursing home, a specially contracted hospice bed or unit in a hospital, or in a free-standing hospice unit. General inpatient criteria is for patients who are experiencing severe symptoms which require daily interventions from the hospice team to manage. Often, patients on this level of care have begun the [...] "active phase" [...] of dying, when their prognosis is measured in days as opposed to weeks or months. Although there is <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> <b>to</b> <b>how</b> long Medicare will cover this level of care, it is usually provided for brief periods of time, with five to seven days being the average.|$|E

2500|$|There is, however, <b>an</b> upper <b>limit</b> <b>to</b> <b>how</b> large {{supermassive black}} holes can grow. [...] So-called ultramassive black holes (UMBHs), which {{are at least}} ten {{times the size of}} supermassive black holes, appear to have <b>a</b> {{theoretical}} upper <b>limit</b> of around 50 billion solar masses, as anything above this slows growth down to a crawl (the slowdown tends to start around 10 billion solar masses) and causes the unstable accretion disk surrounding the black hole to coalesce into stars that orbit it.|$|R
500|$|According to Oborne, Vorster was {{a pragmatic}} {{politician}} {{who wanted to}} maintain apartheid {{and to make it}} appear acceptable to the outside world. To this end, attempting to broaden South Africa's international connections, he accepted black foreign diplomats in the country and began to plan a policy to allow mixed-race sport to prevent South Africa's international isolation. However, such policies were unpopular with his domestic supporters and he was careful not to go too far. Oborne writes: [...] "Vorster knew that there was <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> <b>to</b> <b>how</b> far he could go without imperilling his own position. That limit was Basil D'Oliveira." [...] According to Oborne, Vorster never intended to allow D'Oliveira to play with the MCC team; his supporters would not have accepted a non-white South African benefiting from this change of policy and demonstrating his ability at a high level. Vorster therefore worked to give the impression overseas that D'Oliveira would be welcome, {{while at the same time}} doing his utmost to stop him from playing. He courted the British ambassador, Sir John Nicholls, and told him that a tour party including D'Oliveira would be acceptable. Nicholls passed this on to the UK government. Vorster meanwhile monitored D'Oliveira's progress closely; from his debut in 1966, South Africa kept a security file on him.|$|E

2500|$|There is <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> <b>to</b> <b>how</b> deep a [...] "deep stop" [...] can be.

The [...] "deepest possible decompression stop" [...] {{for a given}} profile {{can be defined as}} the depth where the gas loading for the leading compartment crosses the ambient pressure line. This is not a useful stop depth - some excess in tissue gas concentration is necessary to drive the outgassing diffusion, however this depth is a useful indicator of the beginning of the decompression zone, in which ascent rate is part of the planned decompression.|$|E

50|$|It seems, however, {{that this}} ratio changes as one {{approaches}} {{the center of}} the Negative Zone. Since there have been several instances of pan-dimensional conversations between the two planes, it appears the time ratio is much closer to 1:1 when one is at the nexus of the Negative Zone. It is currently unclear at what rate the time difference increases as one moves away from the vortex or if there is <b>an</b> upper <b>limit</b> <b>to</b> <b>how</b> great {{the difference between the two}} universes can become.|$|R
50|$|Latency in live {{performance}} occurs naturally {{from the time}} it takes sound to transmit through air. It takes sound about 3 milliseconds to travel 1 meter. Small amounts of latency occur between performers depending on how they are spaced from each other and from stage monitors if these are used. This creates <b>a</b> practical <b>limit</b> <b>to</b> <b>how</b> far apart the artists in a group can be from one another. Stage monitoring extends that limit, as sound travels close to the speed of light through the cables that connect stage monitors.|$|R
2500|$|The Beach Boys {{struggled}} with their audiences {{for a number}} of reasons pertaining to their early hits. Because the songs celebrated a politically unconscious youth culture, the group's legitimacy in rock music became an oft-repeated criticism toward the band. Critic Kenneth Partridge blamed the lack of [...] "edginess" [...] on the group's early records for why they're [...] "rarely talked about in the same breath as the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, and when they are, it’s really only because of two albums". Musicologist Charlie Gillett explains, [...] "By 1965, the Beach Boys had become an American pop institution, but although they continued to cultivate a visual image in line with their name and early repertoire, there was <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> <b>to</b> <b>how</b> many different ways Wilson could celebrate the wonders of living in Southern California … Originally, many serious pop fans dismissed the group as trashy pop for kids." ...|$|E
2500|$|After he {{had already}} {{explored}} all {{that had previously been}} discovered, Bishop began to grow bored with the cave. He knew there was more out there, but there was <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> <b>to</b> <b>how</b> far the more experienced guides would go. The farthest anyone had been in the cave was to the bottomless pit: a massive hole of darkness. None would dare venture near the pit for fear of being lost forever in its depths. Bishop was brave and his curiosity was greater than his fear. Along with a guest who was equally as curious and daring as Bishop, the two men journeyed to the pit. With the help of an old ladder found nearby, they laid it across the gaping mouth of the pit and slowly ventured across the ladder. What the two men discovered opened up a whole new part of the cave. A short way further from the pit Bishop discovered a river. This was the first body of water that had ever been encountered in the cave. [...] As he explored the river he found eyeless fish: something that no one had ever heard about at this time. This brought scientists to the cave to study the new creature. Some of the most popular areas of the cave were both discovered and named by Bishop after crossing the bottomless pit.|$|E

Using a dynamic general equilibrium model, we show that the credible expectation of such <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> would lead <b>to</b> <b>a</b> balance of payments anti-crisis, which is characterized by an economic boom, real appreciation, growing demand for domestic currency, and domestic inflation, in the period prior <b>to</b> the <b>limit</b> being reached. ...|$|R

40|$|It is {{interesting}} to note that as practical limita-tions were removed, several fundamental or principal limitations were established. For instance, Carnot showed that there was <b>a</b> fun-damental <b>limit</b> <b>to</b> <b>how</b> much energy could be extracted from a heat engine. Later this result was generalized to the second law of thermo-dynamics. As a result of Einstein’s special rela-tivity theory, the existence of <b>an</b> upper velocity <b>limit</b> was found.

Then, over the next two decades, leverage proceeded to more than double, reaching an all-time high of 133 % in 2007. That dramatic rise in debt was accompanied by a steady decline in the personal saving rate.
