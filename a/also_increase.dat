5|$|Schizophrenia {{has great}} human and {{economic}} costs. It {{results in a}} decreased life expectancy by 10–25years. This is primarily because of its association with obesity, poor diet, sedentary lifestyles, and smoking, with an increased rate of suicide playing a lesser role. Antipsychotic medications may <b>also</b> <b>increase</b> the risk. These differences in life expectancy increased between the 1970s and 1990s.|$|E
5|$|There is a three-stage {{process in}} which the area, time period, and details of a severe weather {{forecast}} are refined from a broad-scale forecast of potential hazards to a more specific and detailed forecast of what hazards are expected, and where and in what time frame they are expected to occur. If warranted, forecasts will <b>also</b> <b>increase</b> in severity through this three-stage process.|$|E

5|$|Antioxidant {{vitamins}} {{are found}} in vegetables, fruits, eggs, legumes and nuts. Vitamins A, C, and E can be destroyed by long-term storage or prolonged cooking. The effects of cooking and food processing are complex, as these processes can <b>also</b> <b>increase</b> the bioavailability of antioxidants, such as some carotenoids in vegetables. Processed food contains fewer antioxidant vitamins than fresh and uncooked foods, as preparation exposes food to heat and oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Cocaine, {{substituted}} amphetamines (including methamphetamine), Adderall, methylphenidate (marketed as Ritalin or Concerta), MDMA (ecstasy) {{and other}} psychostimulants exert their effects primarily or partly by increasing dopamine {{levels in the}} brain {{by a variety of}} mechanisms. Cocaine and methylphenidate are dopamine transporter blockers or reuptake inhibitors; they non-competitively inhibit dopamine reuptake, resulting in increased dopamine concentrations in the synaptic cleft. Like cocaine, substituted amphetamines and amphetamine <b>also</b> <b>increase</b> the concentration of dopamine in the synaptic cleft, but by different mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|Doxorubicin {{interacts with}} DNA by {{intercalation}} and inhibition of macromolecular biosynthesis. This inhibits {{the progression of}} topoisomerase II, an enzyme which relaxes supercoils in DNA for transcription. Doxorubicin stabilizes the topoisomerase II complex after it has broken the DNA chain for replication, preventing the DNA double helix from being resealed and thereby stopping the process of replication. It may <b>also</b> <b>increase</b> quinone type free radical production, hence contributing to its cytotoxicity.|$|E

50|$|In {{this process}} fresh saline water is {{continuously}} {{added to the}} walls {{from the top of}} the tower. After evaporation, the remaining saline water falls down and drains out continuously. The movement of water <b>also</b> <b>increases</b> the energy of molecules and increases the evaporation process. The increase in the tower’s height <b>also</b> <b>increases</b> the production.|$|R

5|$|Exposure to lead {{also can}} be {{evaluated}} by measuring erythrocyte protoporphyrin (EP) in blood samples. EP {{is a part of}} red blood cells known to increase when the amount of lead in the blood is high, with a delay of a few weeks. Thus EP levels in conjunction with blood lead levels can suggest the time period of exposure; if blood lead levels are high but EP is still normal, this finding suggests exposure was recent. However, the EP level alone is not sensitive enough to identify elevated blood lead levels below about 35μg/dL. Due to this higher threshold for detection and the fact that EP levels <b>also</b> <b>increase</b> in iron deficiency, use of this method for detecting lead exposure has decreased.|$|E
5|$|In the brain, AVMs {{occasionally}} exert pressure, {{leading to}} headaches. They may <b>also</b> <b>increase</b> {{the risk of}} seizures, as would any abnormal tissue in the brain. Finally, hemorrhage from an AVM may lead to intracerebral hemorrhage (bleeding into the brain), which causes any of the symptoms of stroke such as weakness in {{part of the body}} or difficulty speaking. If the bleeding occurs into the subarachnoid space (subarachnoid hemorrhage), there is usually a severe, sudden headache and decreased level of consciousness and often weakness in part of the body.|$|E
5|$|Most fish move by {{alternately}} contracting paired sets {{of muscles}} {{on either side}} of the backbone. These contractions form S-shaped curves that move down the body. As each curve reaches the back fin, backward force is applied to the water, and in conjunction with the fins, moves the fish forward. The fish's fins function like an airplane's flaps. Fins <b>also</b> <b>increase</b> the tail's surface area, increasing speed. The streamlined body of the fish decreases the amount of friction from the water. Since body tissue is denser than water, fish must compensate for the difference or they will sink. Many bony fish have an internal organ called a swim bladder that adjusts their buoyancy through manipulation of gases.|$|E

5|$|People with TBI are {{provided}} with supplemental oxygen and may need mechanical ventilation. Employment of certain measures such as Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and ventilation at higher-than-normal pressures may be helpful in maintaining adequate oxygenation. However, such measures can <b>also</b> <b>increase</b> leakage of air through a tear, and can stress the sutures in a tear that has been surgically repaired; therefore the lowest possible airway pressures that still maintain oxygenation are typically used. Mechanical ventilation can also cause pulmonary barotrauma when high pressure is required to ventilate the lungs. Techniques such as pulmonary toilet (removal of secretions), fluid management, and treatment of pneumonia are employed to improve pulmonary compliance (the elasticity of the lungs).|$|E
5|$|Soluble ionic {{compounds}} like salt {{can easily}} be dissolved to provide electrolyte solutions. This is {{a simple way to}} control the concentration and ionic strength. The concentration of solutes affects many colligative properties, including increasing the osmotic pressure, and causing freezing-point depression and boiling-point elevation. Because the solutes are charged ions they <b>also</b> <b>increase</b> the electrical conductivity of the solution. The increased ionic strength reduces the thickness of the electrical double layer around colloidal particles, and therefore the stability of emulsions and suspensions.|$|E
5|$|Some changes {{introduced}} into Devil May Cry 4 are {{the presence of}} two playable characters, Dante and Nero, and a slight modification to the shop system. A new currency, Proud Souls, is used to buy new abilities while Red Orbs are used to buy items. Proud Souls are rewarded {{at the end of}} missions and the amount varies depending on how well the player performed. Cost of abilities <b>also</b> <b>increase</b> with the purchase of other abilities, though all abilities can be sold back for the original price.|$|E

25|$|Diethylstilbestrol (DES) is a {{synthetic}} form of estrogen. It {{has been used}} between the early 1940s and 1971. Pregnant women took DES to prevent certain pregnancy complications.

5|$|The H2-receptor {{antagonist}} cimetidine causes {{an increase}} in the plasma concentration of metformin, by reducing clearance of metformin by the kidneys; both metformin and cimetidine are cleared from the body by tubular secretion, and both, particularly the cationic (positively charged) form of cimetidine, may compete for the same transport mechanism. A small double-blind, randomized study found the antibiotic cephalexin to <b>also</b> <b>increase</b> metformin concentrations by a similar mechanism; theoretically, other cationic medications may produce the same effect.|$|E

From April 2008, the National Assembly for Wales have given a grant to the Wales Millennium Centre with £3.5million per annum for 3 years. This would only repay the capital debt and not any ongoing operating loss as the Centre remains profitable. The money used to pay the debt came from unallocated funds from the Assembly's previous budget and it was said by the Minister for Heritage, Rhodri Glyn Thomas, that the new money allocation would not {{come at the expense of}} other art projects from other parts of Wales.|$|E
5|$|While all the {{reaction}} mechanisms {{of these species}} within the body are not yet fully understood, {{one of the most}} reactive products of oxidative stress is the hydroxyl radical (·OH), which can initiate a damaging chain reaction of lipid peroxidation in the unsaturated lipids within cell membranes. High concentrations of oxygen <b>also</b> <b>increase</b> the formation of other free radicals, such as nitric oxide, peroxynitrite, and trioxidane, which harm DNA and other biomolecules. Although the body has many antioxidant systems such as glutathione that guard against oxidative stress, these systems are eventually overwhelmed at very high concentrations of free oxygen, and the rate of cell damage exceeds the capacity of the systems that prevent or repair it. Cell damage and cell death then result.|$|E
