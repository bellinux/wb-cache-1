Then. 198 : 596 - 608, 1976. The level {{of the two major}} norepinephnine metabolites, 3 -methoxy- 4 -hydnoxyphenyl-glycol (MOPEG) and 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenylglycol (DOPEG), was estimated {{in the central}} nervous system of rats to study receptor-mediated regulation of release in vivo as reflected in biochemical changes. The norepinephnine receptor stimulating drug clonidine (0. 02 - 0. 5 mg/kg) decreased the level of endogenous total MOPEG. The accumulation of 3 H-MOPEG and 3 H-DOPEG was decreased by clonidine (0. 5 mg/kg) regardless of whether 3 H-tyrosine or 3 H-dopamine was used as precursor of 3 H-norepinephnine. In contrast to clonidine, the two alpha adrenocepton blocking drugs, phenoxybenzamine (20 mg/kg) and <b>aceperone</b> (20 mg/kg), induced an increase in endogenous total MOPEG and also an increase in 3 H-MOPEG and 3 H-DOPEG regardless of the precursor used. These results indicate that clonidine decreases th...|$|E
40|$|Dopamine receptors were {{examined}} by Scatchard {{analysis in the}} striatal and olfactory tubercle regions of 11 inbred mouse strains. Simultaneous determinations of the binding characteristics of 3 H-labeled 2 -amino- 6, 7 -dihydroxy- 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydronaphthalene (ADTN), a dopaminergic agonist, and [3 H]spiroperidol, a dopaminergic antagonist, {{were examined}}. Among the 11 strains, the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) for agonist binding did not vary in either the striatum or the olfactory tubercle. Similarly, no strain differences were observed in the Kd for spiroperidol in either region, although the Kd for spiroperidol in the olfactory tubercle was uniformly higher than that in the striatum. Measurement of receptor concentrations revealed strain differences of up to 2 -fold for both [3 H]ADTN and [3 H]spiroperidol binding sites. Within each brain region, the densities of agonist and antagonist binding sites correlated significantly. However, between brain regions there was no correlation in the density of agonist or antagonist binding sites, which suggests that mesolimbic and nigrostriatal dopamine neurons may be under independent genetic control. Analysis of [3 H]spiroperidol displacement by clofluperol, <b>aceperone,</b> cinanserin, and mianserin in four inbred mouse strains revealed that 88 - 90 % of the striatal spiroperidol sites are dopaminergic, with the remainder being serotonergic. In contrast, 53 - 66 % of the olfactory tubercle [3 H]spiroperidol binding sites are dopaminergic and 34 - 47 % are serotonergic. These data suggest that genetic differences in serotonin receptors and dopamine receptors may exist among inbred mouse strains...|$|E
40|$|Separate {{groups of}} rats {{were trained to}} {{discriminate}} the narcotic agonist-antagonist, cyclazocine (1. 25 mg/kg), from saline or the pure narcotic agonist, morphine (10 mg/kg), from saline. In the cyclazocine discriminating animals, the interoceptive stimuli produced by cyclazocine {{were found to be}} dose related and largely based on central opiate systems in that these effects were reversed by the narcotic antagonist, naloxone. The discriminative stimulus produced by cyclazocine was found to be completely generalized to nalorphine, ethylketocyclazocine, pentazocine and morphine while a lesser degree of generalization was seen to the experimental compounds, U- 49, 274 A and U- 50, 788 E. The cyclazocine discriminative stimulus did not generalize to apomorphine, d-amphetamine, haloperidol, d-butaclamol, 1 -butaclamol, clonidine, desipramine, amitriptyline, <b>aceperone</b> and butorphanol. Cyclazocine generalization to morphine was completely antagonized by naloxone at a dose one-twentieth that required to antagonize the cyclazocine discriminative stimulus itself. At no dose tested did naloxone completely antagonize cyclazocine generalization to nalorphine. A possible dopaminergic component of the cyclazocine discriminative stimulus was demonstrated by attenuation of stimulus strength with the neuroleptics haloperidol, benperidol and d-butaclamol. The discriminative stimulus produced by morphine was also found to be a dose related effect based upon central opiate mechanisms as demonstrated by naloxone reversibility. The discriminative stimulus produced by morphine only partially generalized to cyclazocine and ethylketocyclazocine. Naloxone antagonized the generalization of morphine to cyclazocine but at a dose four times that required to antagonize the morphine discriminative stimulus itself. A possible dopaminergic component of the morphine discriminative stimulus was demonstrated by haloperidol attenuation of stimulus strength. Cyclazocine analgesia, demonstrated using the mouse tail flick procedure, was found to be maximal approximately five minutes following cyclazocine administration. Some analgesic potency was also ~easurable 35 minutes post cyclazocine. The analgesic effects of cyclazocine were found to be reversed by naloxone. Pretreatment with the neuroleptics oxiperomide, clozapine and dexclamol before cyclazocine was found to enhance the analgesic potency of cyclazocine...|$|E
40|$|Intravenous {{self-administration}} {{of drugs}} by experimental animals has importance as a laboratory {{model for the}} study of drug abuse and for the investigation of the neurochemical mechanisms underlying the reinforcing properties of drugs. Utilizing the drug self-administration technique, pharmacological investigations of the neurochemical basis of drug reinforcement suggest that opiate reinforcement is mediated through activation of central noradrenergic systems, whereas the reinforcing effects of psychomotor stimulants are mediated via activation of dopaminergic systems. The major {{purpose of the present study}} was to determine if the alpha noradrenergic receptor agonist, clonidine, would be self-administered by rats and furthermore to determine if clonidine is self-administered for its positive reinforcing effects. The latter was investigated by increasing the response requirement to obtain each clonidine injection. In view of the opiate-like effects of clonidine, the ability of clonidine to maintain self-administration behavior in rats self-administering the synthetic narcotic fentanyl was investigated. Also, the effect of response-contingent naloxone injections on clonidine-reinforced responding were compared with; their effect on fentanyl-reinforced responding. Since stimulation of the noradrenergic system is suggested to be involved in mediating the reinforcing effects of opiates, preliminary experiments compared the characteristics of clonidine-reinforced responding with the characteristics of fentanyl-reinforced responding by independently adding selected butyrophenones to the clonidine and fentanyl solutions. Under pentobarbital anesthesia male hooded rats of the Long-Evans strain were implanted with chronic indwelling jugular catheters and allowed to self-administer either clonidine (15 ug/Kg/injection), fentanyl (O. l and 1. 0 ug/Kg/injection) or saline on a continuous reinforcement schedule. The drug solutions were delivered, in a constant volume of 100 ul/Kg, into the vein in less than one second. Subjects readily acquired the self-administration of clonidine and fentanyl (1 ug/Kg/injection) but not fentanyl (0. 1 ug/Kg/injection) nor saline. Stable rates of clonidine and fentanyl-reinforced responding were attained after 3 or 5 days, respectively. When the fixed ratio (FR) requirement to obtain each clonidine injection was increased from 1 to 3, a significant increase in lever pressing was observed; however, total daily clonidine intake decreased significantly. When the FR requirement was further increased from 3 to 10, response rate increased so that total daily clonidine intake at the FR- 3 and FR- 10 schedules of clonidine reinforcement remained the same. Substitution of clonidine (15 ug/Kg/ injection but not clonidine (1 ug/Kg/injection) nor saline maintained self-administration behavior in rats previously self-administering fentanyl. Extinction of self-administration behavior was observed following the substitution of both clonidine (1 ug/Kg/injection) and saline for the fentanyl solution. Addition of naloxone (64 ug/Kg/injection) to the clonidine and fentanyl solutions significantly decreased fentanyl-reinforced responding but appeared to have no effect on clonidine-reinforced responding. Fentanyl reinforced responding returned to pre-naloxone rates following the removal of naloxone from the fentanyl solution. Addition of either haloperidol or azaperone to the clonidine and fentanyl solutions iso that the subjects received 64 ug/Kg/ injection, tended to decrease the rates of self-administration of rats previously self-administering either clonidine or fentanyl alone. Removal of haloperidol and azaperone from the clonidine and fentanyl solutions tended to result in a return to pre-haloperidol and pre-azaperone response rates. Addition of <b>aceperone</b> (64 ug/Kg/injection) produced no significant change in the rate of clonidine-reinforced responding but resulted in a significant increase in the rate of fentanyl-reinforced responding. Self-administration of clonidine by rats suggests that stimulation of central alpha-noradrenergic receptors results in positive reinforcement. Clonidine 2 ̆ 7 s self-administration by rats and its ability to maintain self-administration behavior in rats previously self-administering fentanyl suggests this drug may have abuse potential. Preliminary experiments suggest some similarities between clonidine- and fentanyl-reinforced responding; however, the exact nature of these similarities remain to be determined. The reinforcing effects of clonidine, unlike the reinforcing effects of fentanyl, seem to be mediated by opioid independent mechanisms...|$|E
