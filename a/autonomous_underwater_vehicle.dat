25|$|Studies done {{primarily}} by the University of Miami (UM) in the 1970s surveyed the Miami Terrace geological formation. Biologists also retrieved samples of reef fauna. John Reed, with Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution, observed dense aggregations of 50 to 100 wreckfish there in May 2004 during a submersible dive. A UM team with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations Ocean Exploration program discovered new reef sites there in December 2005 using an <b>autonomous</b> <b>underwater</b> <b>vehicle.</b>|$|E

25|$|The MVFugroSupporter and MVHavila Harmony were {{equipped}} with a Kongsberg HUGIN4500 <b>autonomous</b> <b>underwater</b> <b>vehicle</b> (AUV), which carried the same instruments as the towfish deployed by the other vessels. Unlike the towfish, the AUVs were self-propelled and could manoeuvre themselves to maintain a constant altitude above the seafloor. When launched, the torpedo-shaped AUV dived to the proper altitude, then followed a pre-programmed search pattern for up to 24 hours, collecting sonar data for up to 24hours; when the mission was complete, the AUV surfaced and was recovered by the vessel, where the data was downloaded and the batteries were swapped for the next mission. The AUVs were used to scan areas {{which could not be}} effectively searched by the towfish on the other three vessels. Because of the difficultly in operating the AUV during the austral winter months due to sea conditions, the AUV operations were suspended during the austral winter months.|$|E
25|$|An {{underwater}} glider—an <b>autonomous</b> <b>underwater</b> <b>vehicle</b> (AUV), {{designed by}} the Scripps Institute of Oceanography, was named after Slocum's ship Spray. It became the first AUV to cross the Gulf Stream, while operated by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. Another AUV has been named after Slocum himself: the Slocum Electric Glider, designed by Douglas Webb of Webb Research (since 2008, Teledyne Webb Research). In 2009, a Slocum glider, modified by Rutgers University, crossed the Atlantic in 221 days. The RU27 traveled from Tuckerton, New Jersey, to Baiona, Spain — the port where Christopher Columbus landed on his return from his first voyage to the New World. Like Slocum himself, the Slocum glider is capable of traveling over thousands of kilometers. These gliders continue {{to be used by}} various research institutions, including Texas A University's Department of Oceanography and Geochemical and Environmental Research Group (GERG), to explore the Gulf of Mexico and other bodies of water.|$|E

One {{of the methods}} is brute force approach in which messages are broadcasted to all the communication nodes, which in turn will broadcast the acknowledgement. Issues relating to this brute force approach are time delay, number of hops, power consumption, message collision and other practical issues. These issues are discussed and solved by proposing a new method to improve efficiency of this proposed approach and its effectiveness in communication among <b>autonomous</b> <b>underwater</b> <b>vehicles.</b> I...|$|R
500|$|Another {{proposal}} {{put forward}} in 2001 {{calls for a}} large nuclear-powered [...] "melt probe" [...] (cryobot) that would melt through the ice until it reached an ocean below. Once it reached the water, it would deploy an <b>autonomous</b> <b>underwater</b> <b>vehicle</b> (hydrobot) that would gather information and {{send it back to}} Earth. Both the cryobot and the hydrobot would have to undergo some form of extreme sterilization to prevent detection of Earth organisms instead of native life and to prevent contamination of the subsurface ocean. This suggested approach has not yet reached a formal conceptual planning stage.|$|E
500|$|The {{location}} of the wreck was undetermined until mid-December 2002, when the wreck was discovered by an underwater survey company, C & C Technologies, Inc, using a sonar-equipped <b>autonomous</b> <b>underwater</b> <b>vehicle,</b> [...] from Gibraltar, at about 1000 metres depth. The company had been contracted by the BBC {{as part of a}} documentary on maritime archaeology related to major battles of the Royal Navy. The Ark Royal wreck lies scattered across the seafloor [...] of the bow lay separated {{from the rest of the}} ship's hull. A large debris field, which includes the remains of the funnel and bridge island, parts of the ship that came loose as the carrier sank, and aircraft from the hangars, lay between the two hull sections. Analysis revealed that the port side of the ship hit the seabed first.|$|E

This was organized by AUVSI Board member, Jerry Lane who worked at the U.S. Army Tank Automotive Command at the time. In 1998, the underwater community was represented when AUVSI and the U.S. Office of Naval Research teamed up to offer the first International <b>Autonomous</b> <b>Underwater</b> <b>Vehicle</b> Competition which is held annually in the U.S. All of these competitions, land, sea, and air, have at their core, [...] "full autonomy" [...] as a distinctive characteristic.

40|$|Abstract: Based on CFD technique, {{this paper}} {{discusses}} {{the applicability of}} different turbulence models and mesh partition method which are used to predict the hydrodynamic performance of AUV. Firstly, the hydrodynamic performance prediction method was gotten and was validated, and three different shapes <b>autonomous</b> <b>underwater</b> <b>vehicles</b> were designed. The hydrodynamic performances of the three <b>autonomous</b> <b>underwater</b> <b>vehicles</b> were predicted. Then, the advantage and disadvantage of the four <b>autonomous</b> <b>underwater</b> <b>vehicles</b> were obtained by comparing the resistance and pressure distribution. Based on these, two other AUV hulls were designed which combined the advantages of them, and the hydrodynamic performance was predicted. The calculation {{results showed that the}} resistance and hull pressure distribution were improved remarkably comparing with the parent model. The resistance coefficient of optimized hull is reduced by 20 % compared to the parent hull...|$|R
500|$|The {{governments of}} Malaysia, China, and Australia agreed to {{thoroughly}} search [...] of seafloor. [...] This {{phase of the}} search, which began on 6 October 2014, used three vessels equipped with towed deep-water vehicles that use side-scan sonar, multi-beam echo sounders, and video cameras to locate and identify aircraft debris. A fourth vessel participated in the search between January–May 2015; it had an <b>autonomous</b> <b>underwater</b> <b>vehicle</b> (AUV) to search areas which cannot be effectively searched by equipment on the other vessels. Following {{the discovery of the}} flaperon on Réunion, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) reviewed its drift calculations for debris from the aircraft and, according to the JACC, was satisfied that the search area was still the most likely crash site. Reverse drift modelling of the debris, to determine its origin after 16 months, also supported the underwater search area, although reverse drift modelling is very imprecise over long periods. However, on 17 January 2017 Malaysia, China, and Australia jointly announced the suspension of the search for Flight 370.|$|E
2500|$|On 14 April, {{due to the}} {{likelihood}} of the ULBs' acoustic pulses having ceased because their batteries would have run down, the Towed Pinger Locator search gave way to a seabed search using side-scan sonar installed in a Bluefin-21 <b>Autonomous</b> <b>Underwater</b> <b>Vehicle.</b> The first day's search was aborted because the sea bed was considerably deeper than the maximum operating depth of Bluefin. Scanning subsequently resumed and after covering 42 square miles in its first four dives, the submersible was reprogrammed to allow it to dive 604 feet lower than its operational limit of 14,800 feet, when the risk of damage was assessed as [...] "acceptable".|$|E
