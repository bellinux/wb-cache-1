40|$|The rabbit is customarily {{used for}} the prepara-tion of <b>anti-human</b> <b>globulin</b> <b>serum,</b> but there are several {{objections}} to the choice of this animal. These are: (1) The volume of serum obtained is small. To maintain supplies it is necessary either to have several animals producing the reagent, or to hyperimmunize and bleed the rabbits used too frequently, which in turn results in a less specific reagent. (2) The rabbit is prone to myxomatosis. This note reports {{the preparation of the}} reagent in the goat. The procedure has the following advantages over preparation in rabbits: (1) It yields larger volumes of serum. (2) The goat is not prone to infection with myxomatosis. (3) The immunizing and bleeding operations are simple...|$|E
40|$|Tyler [1] {{showed that}} {{photo-oxidation}} could cause antisera to become nonprecipitating and nonagglutinating without destroying {{the ability of}} the antibodies to combine with the specific antigen. This was shown by the fact that treated antiserum could inhibit specifically agglutination or precipitation by corresponding untreated serum. On the basis of the mutual multivalence theory of Marrack, [2] Heidelberger, [3] and Pauling [4] it was considered that multivalent antibody had been made functionally univalent by the treatment, the term "univalent antibody" being used to designate an antibody that is incapable of causing precipitation or agglutination but which is still able to combine with the antigen. A method more sensitive and direct than that of specific inhibition for demonstrating the presence of specifically combining but nonagglutinating antibody is the antiglobulin sensitization test of Coombs, Mourant, and Race. [5] However, this method was not available when Tyler's original experiments were performed. The present experiments show that it can be used with photo-oxidized antisera, and thus one can measure more directly the sensitizing capacity of sera rendered nonagglutinating by this method. There was also a more urgent reason for undertaking the present experiments on the photo-oxidation of rabbit anti-sheep red cell sera. Coombs, Howard, and Mynors [6] reported a serological procedure theoretically capable of detecting incomplete or nonprecipitating antibodies to soluble protein antigens. The method using ox red cells, although simple in theory, is rather lengthy to perform. A much shorter method, employing sheep red cells, was envisaged if a nonagglutinating rabbit sheep cell antibody were available. [7] Tyler's work showed the possibility of producing this type of antibody by photooxidation. Chemically linked to such an antibody, a soluble protein antigen, such as egg albumin, could be fixed to the surface of sheep cells, which would nevertheless remain stable in suspension. This cell system could then be used for the specific absorption of incomplete antibody, in human serum, to the conjugated protein-the absorption being detected finally by an agglutination reaction using a rabbit <b>anti-human</b> <b>globulin</b> <b>serum.</b> Preliminary studies in this direction have been promising, and a shortened serological procedure for detecting incomplete antibodies to soluble protein antigens has been developed by Coombs and Fiset. [8] In the present paper various sheep cell antisera have been examined, before and after varying degrees of photo-oxidation, for their direct agglutinating action and for their combining capacity, as demonstrated by the indirect antiglobulin sensitization test...|$|E

40|$|A double-staining {{procedure}} for the fluorescent treponemal antibody-absorption test, using fluorescein isothiocyanate as a label for the class-specific <b>anti-human</b> <b>globulin</b> and tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate as a label for a counterstain reagent, has been described. This method requires {{the addition of}} a KP 560 barrier filter, with a microscope equipped with vertical illumination, to exclude the rhodamine emission in reading the fluorescein fluorescence. The present study evaluated reversing the dye label for each conjugate in the double-staining procedure, thus eliminating the need for the KP 560 filter. It also considered the possibility of shortening the counterstaining time and compared various methods for preparing antigen slides in an attempt to establish a method that increases the number of treponemes per microscopic field. The results indicate that a rhodamine-labeled class-specific <b>anti-human</b> <b>globulin</b> as a primary stain, and a fluorescein-labeled anti-treponemal globulin as a counterstain, provide an acceptable method for performing the fluorescent treponemal antibody-absorption double-staining procedure. Nonfixed antigen slides were held for 16 days in a desiccator or stored in plastic bags with silica gel for 3 weeks; then, with methanol fixation, they were used satisfactorily in the double-staining procedure.

The present study tried {{not only to}} produce anti-human IgG, but also to assess different antigen injection techniques leading to optimal production of <b>anti-human</b> <b>globulin.</b> Methods: The antibody was separated from human serum using precipitation method with sodium sulfate. It was then purified through diethylaminoethyl Sepharose CL- 6 B  ion exchange chromatography. The purified IgG was mixed with Freund’s complete adjuvant and injected to two trios of rabbits either intramuscularly or subcutaneously. After the first injection, the animals received weekly injections of antigen with Freund’s incomplete adjuvant. The dose of antigen in each injection was 1. 2 ml of purified IgG with a concentration of 115 µg/ml. Venous blood samples were taken from all rabbits and the produced <b>anti-human</b> <b>globulin</b> was evaluated by single radial immunodiffusion (SRID). Results: According {{to the results of}} SRID, the diameter of the halo created by the antigen-antibody complex was significantly higher in the plate containing anti-human IgG produced after the intramuscular injections than after subcutaneous injections. The concentrations of anti IgG antibody were 83. 40 and 72. 28 µg/ml in intramuscular and subcutaneous methods, respectively.

METHODS: 30 hyperinsulinaemic women with PCOS and 15 controls were evaluated. Patients were randomized, using a computer-generated randomization list, into two groups of 15 each and treated with placebo or 300 mg/day of acarbose for three months. Hirsutism and acne/seborrhoea scores, hormonal and sex hormone binding <b>globulin</b> <b>serum</b> concentrations, glycaemia and insulin responses to a standard oral glucose load (75 g) were measured in all patients before and after three months of treatment. RESULTS: A significant reduction of the acne/seborrhoea score was observed in patients treated with acarbose and eight of them resumed a regular menstrual rhythm. These clinical improvements were associated with a significant reduction of the insulin response to glucose load, a significant decrease of LH, total testosterone and androstenedione and with a significant increase of sex hormone binding <b>globulin</b> <b>serum</b> concentrations. The serum concentrations of FSH, dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate, prolactin and 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone did not change significantly.

Antibody binding to the virus was demonstrated by gradient centrifugation experiments. The use of immune serum alone or in com-bination with anti-rabbit gamma <b>globulin</b> <b>serum</b> resulted in aggregation of radio-active virus. Aggregation was also observed when anti-rabbit gamma <b>globulin</b> <b>serum</b> was added under neutralization test conditions. Addition of non-inactivated guinea-pig serum to mixtures of pike fry rhabdovirus and rabbit antiserum to spring viraemia of carp virus resulted in strong neutralization, whereas this antiserum alone or {{in the presence of}} inactivated guinea-pig serum gave an increase in plaque numbers. The increase in plaque number and the complement-dependent neutralization phenomena were weak or absent in the homologous spring viraemia of carp virus system. Immunization of pike with pike fry rhabdovirus resulted in an increase in virus neutralizing activity which could be attributed to the macroglobulin fraction of the serum. After immunizations over a period of 6 months with virus antigens, no further increase in neutralizing activity was observed. Pike sera showed 50 % plaque reduction at concentrations between o'o 17 and 0 " 3 %.
