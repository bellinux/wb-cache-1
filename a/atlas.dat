5|$|Atlas– A four-armed Titan who {{was imprisoned}} in Tartarus after the Great War. In Chains of Olympus, <b>Atlas</b> was freed by the goddess Persephone and {{captured}} the god Helios on her behalf. Persephone directed <b>Atlas</b> to use Helios' power {{to destroy the}} Pillar of the World. <b>Atlas,</b> however, was chained to the weakened pillar by Kratos, and was doomed to carry {{the weight of the}} world on his shoulders forever. After Kratos defeated Persephone, <b>Atlas</b> mocked Kratos and his choice to defend the gods. In God of War II, <b>Atlas</b> and Kratos met again, and although he was initially bitter towards Kratos, <b>Atlas</b> decided to help him reach the Sisters of Fate, providing him with the magic, <b>Atlas</b> Quake, and stated that they would meet again. This would be Atlas' final appearance, however, leaving his fate unknown. The character was voiced by Michael Clarke Duncan in God of War II, and Fred Tatasciore in Chains of Olympus.|$|E
5|$|Central <b>Atlas</b> Tamazight {{is among}} the four most-spoken Berber {{languages}} (the other three being Kabyle, Shilha, and Riff), and rivals Shilha as the most-spoken Berber language in Morocco. Central <b>Atlas</b> Tamazight is mostly spoken in the entire Middle <b>Atlas</b> and its outcroppings, reaching east to Taza and west to the region near Rabat. It is also spoken in the central and eastern High <b>Atlas</b> mountains in Morocco. It is thus spoken across areas with widely varying ecological conditions — from the mountainous and forested regions of the Middle <b>Atlas</b> mountains to the oases of the northwestern Sahara (Tafilalt). Berber in Morocco is spread into three areas: Riff in the north, Central <b>Atlas</b> in the center, and Shilha in the south/southwest. Central <b>Atlas</b> is not mutually intelligible with the Riff language but is with the Shilha dialect; Shilha- and Riff-speakers also cannot understand each other, That said, the Riffian language is of course related to both Shilha and <b>Atlas</b> Tamazight, and even though Riffian {{and the other two}} are not mutually intelligible, they share a high degree of the same vocabulary and grammar.|$|E

50|$|Each of the <b>atlases</b> was put {{together}} {{from a list of}} many different available maps, chosen to satisfy the needs or request of the individual customer; so few if any <b>atlases</b> are identical. About sixty or seventy of these <b>atlases</b> survive today, most held in institutions. The <b>atlases</b> are very important in the history of cartography, for many sixteenth-century Italian maps survive only in these <b>atlases.</b>|$|R
50|$|Climatic {{maps are}} often {{incorporated}} into climatic <b>atlases</b> of varying geographic range (globe, hemispheres, continents, countries, oceans) or included in comprehensive <b>atlases.</b> Besides general climatic maps, applied climatic maps and <b>atlases</b> have great practical value. Aeroclimatic maps, aeroclimatic <b>atlases,</b> and agroclimatic maps {{are the most}} numerous.|$|R
30|$|As {{discussed}} above, different <b>atlases</b> can {{be applied}} for different neuroimaging data to find some similar network properties, but discrepancies in the properties exist, which means that <b>atlases</b> are {{an important factor in}} the reliability of brain network analysis. Although the AAL and Brodmann <b>atlases</b> were popular, they might perform more poorly than other <b>atlases,</b> such as the LPBA 40 [22]. Ota et al. showed that the LPBA 40 performed better than the Brodmann and AAL <b>atlases</b> in predicting mild cognitive impairment [62]. Details of the Brodmann, AAL and LPBA 40 <b>atlases</b> are shown in Fig.  2.|$|R
5|$|The sale {{catalogue}} doesn't mention any maps but it {{is known}} that the family sold the copper plates to Jodocus Hondius in 1604. He transformed the <b>atlas.</b> Almost 40 extra maps were added (including Spain and Portugal) and in 1606 a new edition appeared under his name but with full acknowledgement that most maps were created by Mercator. The title page now included a picture of Hondius and Mercator together although they had never met. Hondius was an accomplished business man and under his guidance the <b>Atlas</b> was an enormous success; he (followed by his son Henricus, and son-in-law Johannes Janssonius) produced 29 editions between 1609 and 1641, including one in English. In addition they published the <b>atlas</b> in a compact form, the <b>Atlas</b> Minor, which meant that it was readily available to a wide market. As the editions progressed, Mercator's theological comments and his map commentaries disappeared from the <b>atlas</b> and images of King <b>Atlas</b> were replaced by the Titan <b>Atlas.</b> By the final edition the number of his maps in the <b>atlas</b> declined to less than 50 as updated new maps were added. Eventually the <b>atlas</b> became out-of-date and {{by the middle of the}} seventeenth century the publications of map-makers such as Joan Blaeu and Frederik de Wit took over.|$|E
5|$|A second {{collection}} of 23 modern maps: 16 of Italy (including Corsica), 3 of Styria {{and the other}} Balkan countries, 4 of Greece. (Once again Mercator did not term this {{collection of}} maps as an <b>atlas</b> but in the preface he introduces <b>Atlas</b> as a mythical King of Mauretania—a learned philosopher, mathematician and astronomer, credited with {{the making of the}} first globe.) This collection has a dedication to Prince Ferdinando de' Medici to whom Mercator attributes ancestry from King <b>Atlas.</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractAn {{analysis}} of soil maps, base and soil-related ones, {{in the national}} and special soil <b>atlases</b> published in the last 25 – 30 years was performed. These were <b>atlases</b> of thirty countries, few ecological <b>atlases</b> and soil <b>atlases</b> of Europe, Africa, Latin America, Azerbaijan, and Russia. All <b>atlases</b> contain base maps, complementary maps of soil properties and regimes, as well as maps compiled for agricultural and ecological purposes. Maps in the national <b>atlases</b> are more diverse than {{in the other two}} groups of <b>atlases,</b> and their sets reflect the nature of the country. The integrity of all these maps is a valuable argument in favor of the importance of soil science and provides a comprehensive insight into the ecological functions and properties of soils...|$|R

30|$|Brain {{networks}} can {{be divided}} into two categories: structural and functional networks. Many studies of neuroscience have reported that the complex brain networks are characterized by small-world or scale-free properties. The identification of nodes is the key factor in studying the properties of networks on the macro-, micro- or mesoscale in both structural and functional networks. In the study of brain networks, nodes are always determined by <b>atlases.</b> Therefore, the selection of <b>atlases</b> is critical, and appropriate <b>atlases</b> are helpful to combine the analyses of structural and functional networks. Currently, some problems still exist in the establishment or usage of <b>atlases,</b> which are often caused by the segmentation or the parcellation of the brain. We suggest that quantification of brain networks might be affected by the selection of <b>atlases</b> to a large extent. In the process of building <b>atlases,</b> the influences of single subjects and groups should be balanced. In this article, we focused on the effects of <b>atlases</b> on the analysis of brain networks and the improved divisions based on the tractography or connectivity in the parcellation of <b>atlases.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{academic}} libraries, map collections {{usually have}} a stock of old maps and <b>atlases.</b> Often such libraries also acquire new copies of various official topographic map series, individual thematic maps, national <b>atlases</b> and thematic regional <b>atlases.</b> Academic library map collections usually also have cartographic literature.|$|R
40|$|Brain <b>atlases</b> and {{associated}} databases have great potential as gateways for navigating, accessing, and visualizing {{a wide range}} of neuroscientific data. Recent progress towards realizing this potential includes the establishment of probabilistic <b>atlases,</b> surface-based <b>atlases</b> {{and associated}} databases, combined with improvements in visualization capabilities and internet access...|$|R
5|$|Less {{than half}} the pages in the <b>atlas</b> are maps. The title page shows King <b>Atlas</b> holding a globe, not {{supporting}} it, then the portrait of Mercator, a dedication to the Dukes of Cleves (father and son), a eulogy on the portrait, two epitaphs, the biography by Ghim, another epitaph by his grandson, two 'testimonial' letters, an ode on King <b>Atlas</b> by a grandson and Mercators own genealogy of <b>Atlas</b> in which he outlines his intended plans {{for the rest of}} the atlas: a description of the creation events, then a description of all that was created in the heavens (astronomy and astrology) and finally a description of the Earth, its geography. Of this grandiose plan all that was completed were the first and last objectives. The first part of the <b>atlas,</b> De mundi creatione ac fabrica liber (The creation of the world and the structure of the book), consists of 27 pages of text on the theology of creation, the events of creation, the elements created (such as animals, plants, sun, moon, stars, man), the Fall of Man and finally the salvation of creation through Christ.|$|E

30|$|Although clustering-based parcellations {{could improve}} the {{divisions}} of some heterogeneous regions to some extent, some disadvantages still needed more study, {{such as the}} reproducibility and hierarchy. The <b>atlases</b> used could be divided into single-subject topological and population-based probabilistic <b>atlases</b> [75], single-subject <b>atlases</b> revealing more interindividual differences and population-based probabilistic <b>atlases</b> revealing more intergroup differences. The parcellation should be balanced between interindividual and intergroup differences, revealing more disease-related differences and the individual effects on them.|$|R

30|$|Most of the <b>atlases</b> {{used were}} derived from {{anatomical}} landmarks or cytoarchitectonic boundaries. These <b>atlases</b> contained little information about connectivity, so their capacity for accurately representing connectomes was limited [21]. Using clustering theory, <b>atlases</b> could be improved based on connectivity, such as the CC 200 /CC 400 proposed by Craddock et al. [74]. In their papers, they summarize some criteria for evaluating the suitability {{of a set of}} regions of interest for whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity analyses. Of course, many other factors should be taken into account to improve the <b>atlases,</b> such as most of the cortex being buried in the sulcal folds [87], gene expression and dynamic functional connectivity. Optimized <b>atlases</b> can be developed by meta-analyses, such as the Dosenbach 160 -region and Power 264 -region <b>atlases.</b>|$|R

5|$|Unlike {{other great}} {{scholars}} {{of the age}} he travelled little and his knowledge of geography came from his library of over one thousand books and maps, from his visitors and from his vast correspondence (in six languages) with other scholars, statesmen, travellers, merchants and seamen. Mercator's early maps were in large formats suitable for wall mounting but {{in the second half}} of his life he produced over 100 new regional maps in a smaller format suitable for binding into his <b>Atlas</b> of 1595. This was the first appearance of the word <b>Atlas</b> in a geographical context but Mercator used it as a neologism for a treatise (Cosmologia) on the creation, history and description of the universe, not simply a collection of maps. He chose the word as a commemoration of a King <b>Atlas</b> of Mauretania whom he considered to be the first great geographer. This King <b>Atlas</b> was a son of the Titan <b>Atlas</b> but the two myths very quickly coalesced.|$|E
40|$|Advances in {{neuroanatomy}} and computational {{power are}} {{leading to the}} construction of new digital brain <b>atlases.</b> <b>Atlases</b> are rising as indispensable tools for comparing anatomical data as well as being stimulators of new hypotheses and experimental designs. Brain <b>atlases</b> describe nervous systems which are inherently plastic and variable. Thus, the levels of brain plasticity and stereotypy would be important to evaluate as limiting factors in the context of static brain <b>atlases.</b> In this review, we discuss the extent of structural changes which neurons undergo over time, and how these changes would impact the static nature of <b>atlases.</b> We describe the anatomical stereotypy between neurons of the same type, highlighting the differences between invertebrates and vertebrates. We review some recent experimental advances in our understanding of anatomical dynamics in adult neural circuits, and how these are modulated by the organism’s experience. In this respect, we discuss some analogies between brain <b>atlases</b> and the sequenced genome and the emerging epigenome. We argue that variability and plasticity of neurons are substantially high, and should thus be considered as integral features of high-resolution digital brain <b>atlases...</b>|$|R
