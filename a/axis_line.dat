5|$|Kesselring {{strove to}} organise and protect supply convoys {{in order to}} get the German-Italian Panzer Army the {{resources}} it needed. He succeeded in establishing local air superiority and neutralising Malta, which provided a base from which British aircraft and submarines could interdict Axis convoys headed for North Africa. Without the vital supplies they carried, particularly fuel, the Axis forces in North Africa could not conduct operations. Through various expedients, Kesselring managed to deliver an increased flow of supplies to Generaloberst Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps in Libya. With his forces thus strengthened, Rommel prepared an attack on the British positions around Gazala, while Kesselring planned Operation Herkules, an airborne and seaborne attack on Malta with the 185 Airborne Division Folgore and Ramcke Parachute Brigade. Kesselring hoped to thereby secure the <b>Axis</b> <b>line</b> of communication with North Africa.|$|E
5|$|The {{regiment}} {{fought in}} the Battle of Alam el Halfa, during an attempted German thrust towards the Nile Delta. On 31 August, the regiment was alerted to the coming attack. B Squadron blocked a German advance through the box minefield, retreating after it was flanked, and two troops from A Squadron drove off eight Italian Fiat M13/40 tanks. Later in the morning ten Axis tanks with two 88 mm guns attacked from the Deir el Muhafid and were repulsed by the 26th Battery artillery. The regiment patrolled the northern flank on 3 September and became the mobile reserve during the New Zealand Division attack on the retreating <b>Axis</b> <b>line.</b> It was to follow the 132nd Infantry Brigade and advance to Deir Alinda, to destroy Axis motorized transport, but the brigade was stopped and the regiment withdrew to the box.|$|E

25|$|In late October, {{elements}} of the newly renamed 4th Ukrainian Front reached the three traditional entrances to the Crimea: the Perekop Isthmus, the Chongar Narrows and the Arabat Spit. The German and Romanian forces of German 17th Army scrambled to cover these gateways, {{and were able to}} block further Soviet advances. However, in doing so they left the south shore of the Sivash unprotected. Lt. Col. P.E. Kuznetsov, chief of intelligence of 10th Rifle Corps, was tasked by his superiors to find usable fords across the shallow sea. Kuznetsov took a scouting party of 30 men, and {{had the good fortune to}} find a local fisherman who identified a crossing site from the mainland to Cape Dzhangar. Three of the scouts crossed the 2km-wide stretch of water, which was only ankle-deep. The next morning, November 1, the entire party made its way over, and then signaled to the Corps to begin crossing. Major P.F. Kaymakova led his battalion of the 1168th Rifle Regiment over first, with the rest of the 346th crossing soon after, followed by the 216th and 257th Rifle Divisions. A few heavy weapons, including some 45mm antitank guns, were brought over on shallow-draft pontoons, but mostly the men were limited to what they could carry. There were no Axis troops within 5km of the crossing site, and although it was mostly carried out in broad daylight, it was hours before the enemy was aware of the crossing. Before they could react the bridgehead was expanded to a size they could only hope to contain, but without tanks or heavy weapons 10th Corps could not break through the screening forces rushed in by 17th Army. A pontoon bridge was not completed until December 9, by which time the <b>Axis</b> <b>line</b> had been reinforced by the German 336th Infantry Division. The position remained in a stalemate until April, 1944.|$|E

2500|$|To {{keep the}} volcano quiet and {{to appease the}} spirits of the mountain, the Javanese {{regularly}} bring offerings on the anniversary of the sultan of Yogyakarta's coronation. For Yogyakarta Sultanate, Merapi holds significant cosmological symbolism, because it is forming a sacred north-south <b>axis</b> <b>line</b> between Merapi peak and Southern Ocean (Indian Ocean). The sacred axis is signified by Merapi peak in the north, the [...] monument near Yogyakarta main train station, the axis runs along Malioboro street to Northern Alun-alun (square) across Keraton Yogyakarta (sultan palace), Southern Alun-alun, all the way to Bantul and finally reach Samas and Parangkusumo beach on the estuary of Opak river and Southern Ocean. This sacred axis connected the hyangs or spirits of mountain revered since ancient times—often identified as [...] "Mbah Petruk" [...] by Javanese people—The Sultan of Yogyakarta {{as the leader of the}} Javanese kingdom, and Nyi Roro Kidul as the queen of the Southern Ocean, the female ocean deity revered by Javanese people and also mythical consort of Javanese kings.|$|E
2500|$|Walton {{also played}} a {{significant}} role in choosing the location for Kennedy's burial. While many in the media, Kennedy's family, and the Kennedy administration believed that Kennedy would be buried in the family plot in Brookline, Massachusetts, Jacqueline Kennedy and Robert McNamara believed he should be buried at Arlington National Cemetery. In a driving rain, McNamara visited the site early in the morning on Saturday, November 24. After reviewing three sites (one of which was the lawn below Arlington House) with cemetery superintendent John C. Metzler, Sr., McNamara returned around mid-morning with Robert Kennedy, Kennedy's sisters Jean Smith and Pat Lawford, and Walton. After reviewing all three sites, the group agreed on the Arlington House lawn. Walton was one of the first to speak in favor of the lawn site, and pointed to a site higher up the hill where he thought the grave should be. During a third trip that afternoon, McNamara and Walton accompanied Jacqueline Kennedy to the site. Walton again pointed to where the president should be buried, and others noted that Walton had instinctively chosen a plot along the axis between Arlington House and the Lincoln Memorial. Walton's reckoning was so good, his preferred site was only [...] off the <b>axis</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
