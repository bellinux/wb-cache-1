5|$|The book {{opens with}} a Kentucky farmer named Arthur Shelby facing {{the loss of his}} farm because of debts. Even though he and his wife Emily Shelby believe that they have a benevolent {{relationship}} with their slaves, Shelby decides to raise the needed funds by selling two of them—Uncle Tom, <b>a</b> <b>middle-aged</b> <b>man</b> with a wife and children, and Harry, the son of Emily Shelby's maid Eliza—to a slave trader. Emily Shelby is averse to this idea because she had promised her maid that her child would never be sold; Emily's son, George Shelby, hates to see Tom go because he sees the man as his friend and mentor.|$|E

5|$|Eastwood next {{turned his}} {{attention}} towards Breezy (1973), a film about love blossoming between <b>a</b> <b>middle-aged</b> <b>man</b> and a teenage girl. During casting for the film Eastwood met Sondra Locke for the first time, an actress who would play major roles in six of his films {{over the next ten}} years and would become an important figure in his life. Kay Lenz got the part of Breezy because Locke, at age 29, was considered too old. The film, shot very quickly and efficiently by Eastwood and Frank Stanley, came in $1million under budget and was finished three days ahead of schedule. Breezy was not a major critical or commercial success and it was only made available on video in 1998.|$|E

25|$|In {{response}} to extensive police appeals, two eyewitnesses came forward on 6 January {{to say they}} had seen the girl at a bus station {{in the company of}} <b>a</b> <b>middle-aged</b> <b>man.</b> One of these individuals was able to identify this man as a former lodger of the Tinsleys. A neighbor of the Tinsley family also informed the police that she had seen this former lodger of the theirs standing alone, loitering on a street corner close to Mona's school, staring {{in the direction of the}} entrance to the premises on the afternoon of her abduction. Later that day, a bus conductor named Charles Reville confirmed to police that the previous day, a young girl matching Mona's description had indeed boarded his 4:45 p.m. bus from Newark to Retford in the company of <b>a</b> <b>middle-aged</b> <b>man,</b> and the pair had alighted his bus at Grove Street, Retford. Reville ominously added that this man had purchased a return ticket for himself, but only a single ticket for the girl. Reville's claims were independently substantiated by a passenger on the bus named Stanley Betts, who also claimed to have seen <b>a</b> <b>middle-aged</b> <b>man</b> travelling between Newark and Retford with a girl matching Mona's description.|$|E

25|$|The video {{begins by}} showing Yamaguchi fishing at dawn on a bridge in a {{suburban}} area, while he lip-synchs to the song. He is met by <b>a</b> <b>middle-aged</b> <b>man</b> (played by actor Yuya Matsuura), who tries to offer him an orange and talk to him. A fish then bites on Yamaguchi's line, and the pair are excited. During the second sequence, the footage of the first scene is shown sped-up and reversed. Mori intended for the reversed scenes of Yamaguchi singing the song to create a feeling of uneasiness. The video continues to reverse, showing footage of Yamaguchi walking towards the bridge to fish, ending in a scene where his mouth synchs up with the song's lyrics, despite the footage being in reverse. The third sequence shows Yamaguchi capturing the fish, and ends with him triumphantly holding up the Asian carp he had just caught.|$|E
25|$|Installed on {{all four}} walls of the gallery to form a {{continuous}} horizon line, the 45 color images of Horn's installation Pi (1998) create a band of syncopated glimpses of another world. Identical in height, slightly varying in width (square, vertical rectangle, horizontal rectangle), evenly spaced and united by a certain blueness of tone, the photographs are portraits of <b>a</b> <b>middle-aged</b> <b>man</b> and woman; close-ups of stuffed animals and feather-strewn birds' nests; stills from Iceland's favorite television soap opera, The Guiding Light; and the beam of a lighthouse cutting through the night. There are also images of {{the interior of a}} plain house near the Arctic Circle; expanses of tundra, and of ground scattered with feathers in some instances and with stuffed dead birds in others. Finally, there are immense expanses of open edgeless sea, shown in different weather and at various times of day.|$|E

25|$|When he {{was still}} in college, Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane created a cartoon short called The Life of Larry. The short {{centered}} around <b>a</b> <b>middle-aged</b> <b>man</b> named Larry and his anthropomorphic dog Steve. He made a sequel called Larry & Steve, which Cartoon Network broadcast in 1997. In 1999, MacFarlane was working for Hanna-Barbara Studios, writing for shows such as Johnny Bravo, Dexter's Laboratory, and Cow and Chicken. The short caught the eye of 20th Century Fox representatives, who asked him to create a TV series revolving around the characters. MacFarlane received a US$50,000 budget to develop a pilot for the show, which was about one twentieth of what most pilots cost. MacFarlane claims to have drawn inspiration from several sitcoms, namely The Simpsons and All in the Family. Several premises were also carried over from several 1980s Saturday morning cartoons he watched as a child, namely The Fonz and the Happy Days Gang, and Rubik, the Amazing Cube.|$|E
25|$|The Magician's Nephew {{is written}} in a lighter tone than other Chronicles of Narnia books, in {{particular}} The Last Battle, which was published after. It frequently makes use of humour; this perhaps reflects the sense of looking back at an earlier {{part of the century}} with affection, and Lewis as <b>a</b> <b>middle-aged</b> <b>man</b> recalling his childhood during those years. There are a number of humorous references to life in the old days, in particular school life. Humorous exchanges also take place between Narnian animals. Jadis' attempt to conquer London is portrayed as more comical than threatening, and further humour derives from the contrast between the evil empress and Edwardian London and its social mores, and her mistaking bumbling Andrew Ketterley for a powerful sorcerer. This recalls the style of Edith Nesbit's children's books. Lewis was fond of these books, which he read in childhood, a number were set in the same period and The Magician's Nephew has some apparent references or homages to them.|$|E
25|$|In Luthor's {{earliest}} appearances, he {{is shown}} as <b>a</b> <b>middle-aged</b> <b>man</b> {{with a full}} head of red hair. Less than a year later, however, an artistic mistake resulted in Luthor being depicted as completely bald in a newspaper strip. The original error is attributed to Leo Nowak, a studio artist who illustrated for the Superman dailies during this period. One hypothesis is that Nowak mistook Luthor for the Ultra-Humanite, a frequent foe of Superman who, in his Golden Age incarnation, resembled a balding, elderly man. Other evidence suggests Luthor's design was confused with that of a stockier, bald henchman in Superman #4 (Spring 1940); Luthor's next appearance occurs in Superman #10 (May 1941), in which Nowak depicted him as significantly heavier, with visible jowls. The character's abrupt hair loss has been made reference to several times {{over the course of his}} history. When the concept of the DC multiverse began to take hold, Luthor's red-haired incarnation was rewritten as Alexei Luthor, Lex's counterpart from the Earth-Two parallel universe. In 1960, writer Jerry Siegel altered Luthor's backstory to incorporate his hair loss into his origin.|$|E
