40|$|Abstract—Availability of {{production}} equipments is one major issue for manufacturers. Predictive maintenance is an <b>answer</b> to prevent <b>equipment</b> from risk of breakdowns while minimizing the maintenance costs. Nevertheless, conflicts could occur between maintenance and production if a maintenance operation is programmed when equipment {{is used for}} production. The case studied here is a flow-shop typology where machines could be maintained once during the planning horizon. Machines are able to switch between two production modes. A nominal one and a degraded one where machine run slowly but increase its remaining useful life. We propose a mixed integer programming model for this problem with the makespan and maintenance delays objective. It allows {{to find the best}} schedule {{of production}} operation. It also produces, for each machine, the control mode and if necessary the preventive maintenance plan. I...|$|R
40|$|Since its {{introduction}} the Rotating Packed Bed (RPB) technology {{has become part}} of the area of interest of process intensification (PI). The process intensification deals with all the technologic innovations that permit an improvement in terms of efficiency, sustainability and environmental management [1]. The innovations are meant in terms of new equipment and processing methods which can bring benefits in the process industry. Industries are always looking for technologies that permit them to reduce the investment and operational cost and at simultaneously maintaining the same level of productivity and product quality or even improve them. The operational costs are not only those related to energetic consumes but also include the cost of the raw material and the cost of the treatment of disposal. For the industries to remain competitive, all the costs have to be minimized and at the same time the highest possible return has to be achieved. For long time the capability of the RPB technology have not been understood and still now there is a lot of skepticism. The reasons for this skepticism are probably due to the not yet good knowledge of the physical phenomena that occurs during the operation. Moreover, the RPBs use the centrifugal acceleration to promote the mass transfer but, to do that, electricity is required. Therefore, the consumption of electricity is necessary to put the device in rotation but it results in another cost item. Anyway, the device has all the potentiality to become a relevant unit operation for the chemical industry in the future. In fact the RPBs with their high gravity technology (HiGee) permit to reduce the size of the equipment intensifying the mass transfer exchange because of the centrifugal acceleration. Compared with the conventional trays or packings columns for distillation and absorption the RPBs are also more flexible because the rotational speed can be adjusted to respond in very short time to changing of the feed composition or new product specification. To respond at the demand of a developed process industry definite <b>answers</b> on the <b>equipment</b> performances in the application fields are therefore required. The aim of this thesis is to investigate the hydrodynamic and the mass transfer of Rotating Packed Bed devices (RPB) in particular trying to improve the latter acting on the design of its individual parts. Because of what said above, this investigation is a screening of all the process parameters looking for the more relevant factors that can influence a good or bad operating performance. Therefore, a good operating area is looked for...|$|R
40|$|In {{many parts}} of North America {{residential}} HVAC systems are installed outside conditioned space. This leads to significant energy losses and poor occupant comfort due to conduction and air leakage losses from the air distribution ducts. In addition, cooling equipment performance is sensitive to air flow and refrigerant charge {{that have been found}} to be far from manufacturers specifications in most systems. The simulation techniques discussed in this report were developed in an effort to provide guidance on the savings potentials and comfort gains that can be achieved by improving ducts (sealing air leaks) and equipment (correct air-flow and refrigerant charge). The simulations include the complex air flow and thermal interactions between duct systems, their surroundings and the conditioned space. They also include cooling equipment response to air flow and refrigerant charge effects. Another key aspect of the simulations is that they are dynamic to account for cyclic losses from the HVAC system and the effect of cycle length on energy and comfort performance. To field test the effect of changes to residential HVAC systems requires extensive measurements to be made for several months for each condition tested. This level of testing is often impractical due to cost and time limitations. Therefore the Energy Performance of Buildings Group at LBNL developed a computer simulation tool that models residential HVAC system performance. This simulation tool has been used to <b>answer</b> questions about <b>equipment</b> downsizing, duct improvements, control strategies and climate variation so that recommendations can be made for changes in residential construction and HVAC installation techniques that would save energy, reduce peak demand and result in more comfortable homes. Although this study focuses on California climates, the simulation tool could easily be applied to other climates. This report summarizes the simulation tool and discusses the significant developments that allow the use of this tool to perform detailed residential HVAC system simulations. The simulations have been verified by comparison to measured results in several houses over a wide range of weather conditions and HVAC system performance. After the verification was completed, more than 350 cooling and 450 heating simulations were performed. These simulations covered a range of HVAC system performance parameters and California climate conditions (that range from hot dry deserts to cold mountain regions). The results of the simulations were used to show the large increases in HVAC system performance that can be attained by improving the HVAC duct distribution systems and by better sizing of residential HVAC equipment. The simulations demonstrated that improved systems can deliver improved heating or cooling to the conditioned space, maintain equal or better comfort while reducing peak demand and the installed equipment capacity (and therefore capital costs) ...|$|R

M??todo: estudo descritivo {{transversal}} realizado atrav??s de question??rio. Participaram das entrevistas 148 m??dicos e enfermeiros atuantes nestas unidades. Destes, os 116 profissionais que atuam exclusivamente na unidade intensiva responderam sobre quesitos espec??ficos das pr??ticas assistenciais sobre a perspectiva da AHRNBP-MC. Resultados: em rela????o ??s estrat??gias apontadas para minimizar ru??do e luminosidade, 39 % dos profissionais referiram atender rapidamente aos alarmes/cuidados no uso dos equipamentos e 88 % apontaram a diminui????o da luminosidade em pelo menos 1 per??odo em 24 h. Como estrat??gias para dor/desconforto, 34 % referiram usar a suc????o n??onutritiva e 9 % citaram utilizar glicose. Oitenta e tr??s porcento relataram serem as informa????es do quadro cl??nico as principais informa????es aos pais na 1 ?? visita. O exame f??sico ?? o procedimento em que ?? permitida a presen??a da m??e para 73 % dos entrevistados. Cinquenta e nove porcento usavam a estabilidade cl??nica como crit??rio para a ida do beb?? ao colo materno pela primeira vez. Conclus??o: apesar do conhecimento te??rico sobre a Aten????o Humanizada, os profissionais ainda n??o o utilizam plenamente em sua pr??tica cl??nica, sugerindo que ainda n??o est?? completamente assimilada a abrang??ncia dessa forma de cuidado neonatal. Objective: {{to identify}} knowledge and practices related to Low Weight Newborn Humane Care - the Kangaroo Method {{by the medical}} and nursing staff in public maternity hospitals located {{in the city of}} Rio de Janeiro. Method: a cross cutting descriptive method performed by questionnaire application aiming at the management of eleven public maternity hospitals in the city of Rio de Janeiro, selected for the study, related to humane medical care for low weight newborns - the Kangaroo Method. One hundred and forty eight doctors and nurses working at these hospitals were interviewed. Of these, 116 professionals exclusively working in ICU answered specific questions related to care under the perspective of the Kangaroo Method. Results: as for the strategies noted to minimize noise and luminosity, 39 % of the professionals related prompt <b>answer</b> to alarms/careful <b>equipment</b> use and 88 % referred to luminosity reduction in at least one period out of 24 hour. As for strategies to reduce pain/discomfort, 34 % reported the use of non-feeding suction and 9 % reported on the use of glucose. Eighty three percent reported clinical data as the main information relayed to parents during the first visit. Physical exam is a procedure where the mother's presence is allowed by 73 % of the respondents. Fifty nine percent reported that clinical stability was the reason of allowing the mothers to hold the baby for the first time, but 30 % will permit that only if the new born is stable with breathing support. Conclusion: notwithstanding theoretical knowledge on Humane Care, professionals still do not apply it fully in their clinical practice, which is suggestive that the scope of this type of neonatal care is still not totally accepted...|$|R
