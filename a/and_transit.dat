5|$|After a lack {{of records}} from the first millennium, Zaprešić again became known in the late 11thcentury. In 1094, {{following}} {{the formation of the}} Zagreb Diocese, Ača, an advisor of the Croato–Hungarian King Ladislav I, was granted land west and east of the Medvednica Mountain to protect the newly formed diocese. Zaprešić became part of the Susedgrad–Stubica manor, the second-biggest estate in the Croato-Hungarian Zagreb County. In 1334, the parish church of St. Peter was founded in Zaprešić, marking the first evidence of the modern settlement of Zaprešić. The settlement developed rapidly, which is attributed to its position on important trade <b>and</b> <b>transit</b> routes. This was corroborated by the route of the first railway in Croatia, which passes through Zaprešić.|$|E

5|$|Community Transit's Strategic Planning Group {{published}} a recommendation in 2004, calling for {{bus rapid transit}} service on the State Route 99 corridor between Everett Station and Aurora Village Transit Center, featuring off-board fare collection, limited stops, <b>and</b> <b>transit</b> signal priority. The route alternatives proposed included express service from Aurora Village to Downtown Seattle via Aurora Avenue North or Interstate 5, as well as express service on Interstate 5 in Everett, if a partnership to share costs with Everett Transit for the Evergreen Way segment was not viable. In December 2005, the CT Board of Directors approved an accelerated planning schedule for a bus rapid transit project, to cost an estimated $15–20 million, and to begin service as the first such system in the Puget Sound region in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Community Transit's {{planning}} for limited-stop bus service, which later evolved into bus rapid transit, {{began in the}} 1990s, with proposals to build bus lanes on State Route 99 between 145th Street NE in Shoreline and Casino Road (near State Route 526) in Everett. Sound Transit was established in 1996 as a regional transit authority, and selected the State Route 99 corridor as a route for its express bus system, but later replaced it, before service began, with an express route on Interstate 5 from Everett to Northgate, while leaving SR 99 to Community Transit. Sound Transit funded the construction of business access <b>and</b> <b>transit</b> lanes on State Route 99 through Lynnwood from 244th Street to 148th Street in 2002, converting former parking lanes, and widening the highway in some areas, improving existing bus service, and laying the ground for a future bus rapid transit line.|$|E
