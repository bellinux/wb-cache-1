40|$|Objectives: <b>Ambulance</b> <b>workers</b> are {{regularly}} exposed to call-outs, which are potentially psychologically traumatic. The ability to remain objective and make adaptive appraisals during call-outs {{may be beneficial}} to this at-risk population. This pilot study investigated the links between cognitive appraisals, objectivity and coping in <b>ambulance</b> <b>workers.</b> Methods: Forty-five <b>ambulance</b> <b>workers</b> from the London Ambulance Service, UK, were studied. Trauma exposure, post-traumatic stress disorder and depression symptoms were assessed using self-report measures. Positive and negative appraisals were measured in relation to two previous call-outs: one during which they coped well and one during which they did not. Results: Enhanced coping was associated with making more positive appraisals during the call-out. Better coping was also related to greater levels of objectivity during these call-outs. Coping less well {{was associated with the}} use of more negative appraisals during the call-out. Conclusions: <b>Ambulance</b> <b>workers</b> may benefit from psychological interventions, which focus on cognitive reappraisal and enhancing objectivity to improve coping and resilience.

For many years he worked in London in the 1970s as a bus driver while playing {{an active role in the}} socialist and radical movements of the day. He joined the International Socialists as a teenager and always remained a committed member of the Socialist Workers Party. His first significant piece of writing was on the rank and file movement of London bus workers in 1975. In the 1980s he became an <b>ambulance</b> <b>worker</b> until an injury forced him to rethink his situation. By this stage he had already begun to develop a fascination with the Soviet Union. In 1985, on the 80th anniversary of the 1905 Revolution in Russia, he published a small pamphlet which remains one of the best short introductions to that tumultuous year, 1905: the great dress rehearsal, 1985.|$|E
50|$|Alfred {{was also}} fond of making and {{throwing}} snowballs. At {{the age of}} three years he can be seen doing just that in the company of two young children in a photo from January 1931. His expertise at throwing however, was not limited to snowballs. Alfred, one visitor recalled, 'used to express his opinion of the human race by picking up large lumps of his droppings and hurling them accurately at the spectators in front of his cage. It was a delight for small schoolboys to be able to act as cheerleaders to this somewhat one-sided contest’. Alfred also had a habit of urinating on visitors after climbing the bars of his cage. One child was beckoned over by the gorilla and when she approached he urinated on her head, the story is still remembered by her grandchildren today who often ask to see the gorilla who ‘did a wee on great grandma’ when they visit the museum. Another writer described how Alfred was her favourite animal at the zoo and she has many memories but her favourite is of her aunt eating plums in front of Alfred. He kept asking her for some and when she simply laughed at him he went {{to the back of his}} cage and threw his dung at her. She continued to laugh and not feed him so he climbed the bars of his cage and urinated on her. The writer got in trouble for telling her aunt that the incident was her fault and she should have given Alfred the plums. Alfred was also fond of playing hide and seek with visitors. One visitor recalled how she once got her head stuck in the bars of Alfred’s cage when she was ten. She was later rescued by a St. Johns <b>ambulance</b> <b>worker.</b> ‘How did Alfred react to my dilemma’, she recounted, ‘he just sat in the corner of his cage clapping his hands loudly and laughing’. She now tells the story to her grandchildren when they visit the zoo.|$|E

This study is to analyze the factors that effect the survival rate of Out of hospital Cardiac arrest patients {{by comparing the results}} of before and after the quality control enforcement. Cardiac arrest patients can be assorted into pre-decision group and decision group. The study analyzed the survival factors which was based on the adequate use of 119 BLS and ACLS usage rates, response time of 119 EMS, qualification of <b>ambulance</b> <b>worker,</b> number of EMS team members, and adequate use of AED according to ECG diagnosis. The analyzation was done over total 1, 233 of Cardiac arrest patients from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2011 After the enforcement of the quality control, the usage of Vital sign check and BLS showed a big difference. Especially, as the usage of ECG showed a significant difference, Shockable rhythm, which is the most important to Cardiac arrest patients, also showed a significant difference. After the enforcement of quality control, the performance of ACLS showed a significant difference in IV.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate whether there was evidence for the proposed mechanisms within the Ehlers and Clark (2000) cognitive model of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder(PTSD). Two principal relationships were to be investigated: firstly, whether behavioural and cognitive strategies prevented change in the nature of the trauma memory and appraisals of the trauma and its sequelae over time; secondly, whether aspects of trauma memory and subsequent appraisals of the trauma and its sequelae mediated the relationship between peritraumatic cognitive processing and PTSD symptoms. The second research objective involved further validation of the Ehlers and Clark (2000) model. The study was conducted on a population of health service employees exposed to aggression and/or violence at work, using a prospective, longitudinal design. A low response rate meant that there was not sufficient power to test these relationships. The findings from Study I were a low response rate, low reporting of incidents of violenced rid aggression and low PTSD symptoms,particularly amongst <b>ambulance</b> <b>workers.</b> Findings from Study I led to a qualitative study being carried out to investigate: the possible reasons for the low response and reporting rate; the lack of PTSD symptoms; and to explore responses of <b>ambulance</b> <b>workers</b> to workplace violence and aggression. Twenty-four interviews were carried out with <b>ambulance</b> <b>workers,</b> and the data was analyzed using Thematic Analysis. PTSD symptoms were described by interviewees in themselves and their colleagues following incidents of violence and aggression Low response rates were discussed in the context of a general reluctance to report incidents and to show that they had not been affected by violence and aggression. The responses to violence and aggression took two forms, a macho or tough response and a reflective, sensitive approach. Colleague relationships were an important source of support for many of the <b>ambulance</b> <b>workers</b> and management were portrayed as uncaring. These findings were considered in the context of the literature and the Ehlers and Clark (2000) model. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Transportation {{incidents}} {{are the leading}} cause of work-related deaths in the United States; between 2003 and 2009, an average of almost 1, 300 U. S. workers died from roadway crashes each year. The risk is even greater for emergency medical services (EMS) personnel. In 2002 field investigators estimated that the fatality rate for EMS workers was more than 2 times the national average for all workers. As part of the National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA), researchers at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) set out to reduce ambulance crash - related injuries and deaths among EMS workers. Research addressed the layout and structural integrity of ambulance compartments, design of hardware, and occupant restraints. NIOSH research revealed a number of important factors involved in <b>ambulance</b> <b>worker</b> injuries and deaths. For example, field investigators observed that EMS workers often ride on the squad bench without wearing a restraint. This allows them to lean forward, stand up, or change positions as needed to reach the patient or equipment, but places them at higher risk of striking bulkheads, cabinets, shelves, or other occupants during a crash. NIOSH crash tests also revealed the possibility of head injury if a worker's head strikes the cabinets immediately above or behind them, and noted that vehicle structural failures can be a contributing factor in adverse outcomes of EMS crashes.

40|$|The {{issue of}} this bachelor's thesis is pre-medical first aid for {{children}} with intoxication. The aim of this bachelor's thesis was to chart the level of knowledge among ambulance employees in the South Bohemia and Vysočina regions of the pre-medical first aid for intoxicated children and to detect the way these health employees are educated in problems of peadiatrics outside {{the frame of the}} credit system. The theoretical part describes the obligation of education for first responders and their competence in connection with first aid. At the same time I describe the separation ofchildren's ages and the physiology of individual age groups, basic first aid, extended first aid, technical and personal. Later chapters contein the frequency of intoxication of children, it's symptoms, treatment and specifics. The research part was made by a guantitative method. The anonymous questionnaires were given out to paramedics and nurses in the South Bohemia region and Vysočina region. At the start of the bachelors thesis two hypothesis were determinated. The first hypothesis says that <b>ambulance</b> <b>workers</b> in the South Bohemia region have the same knowledge of pre-medical first aid for children with intoxication as <b>ambulance</b> <b>workers</b> in the Vysočina region. The second hypothesis claims: <b>Ambulance</b> <b>workers</b> in the South Bohemia region and in the Vysočina region have no education in the field of paediatrics outside the frame of the credit system. The first hypothesis was refuted. Knowledge of the respondents was evaluated in the field of intoxication in pediatrics by the test questions. Success of the respondents from South Bohemia region corresponds in 87 % and success in Vysočina region corresponds in 85 % in the test questions. Second hypothesis was confirmed. The 20 % of respondents argue that they are educated over the framework of the credit system in pediatrics and 80 % of respondents answered that they don't educate themselves. Bachelor thesis could contribute for students in medical specialization and also for health professionals, especially to complete the information about child intoxication field.
