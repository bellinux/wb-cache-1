500|$|Miller later {{noted that}} unlike other episode scenes {{such as in}} [...] "Grey Matters", Walter's {{breakdown}} at the supermarket [...] "came largely out of nowhere. It was a thought experiment that took {{on a life of}} its own." [...] Miller continued that at the time, he and Stentz thought they were writing Olivia-focused episodes, but [...] "In retrospect, we really wrote a four-part story about Walter, his relationship to children, and the struggle between Walter-who-was and Walter-who-is. If you look <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> way, his decision at the end of 'Northwest Passage' becomes the moment where he reconciles those things. He doesn't resolve them, but he comes to grips with them. Once again in retrospect, I think that's what the supermarket breakdown was really about. This happens — you think a scene is about one thing when you're in the middle of it, and realize it's something else entirely when you look back. Characters can be sneaky motherfuckers that way." ...|$|E
500|$|Eight years {{previous}} to the Once Upon a Time pilot (the two {{had just}} completed their work on Felicity, in 2002), Kitsis and Horowitz became inspired to write fairytales out of a love of [...] "mystery and excitement of exploring lots of different worlds." [...] They presented the premise to networks, but were refused because of its fantastical nature. The two learned from their time on Lost {{to look at the}} story in a different way, that [...] "character has to trump mythology"; they expanded, [...] "as people, you've got to see what the void in their heart or in their lives is to care about them... For us, this was as much about the character journeys and seeing what was ripped from them in coming to Storybrooke– going <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> way as opposed to making it the 'break-the-curse show.'" [...] Despite the comparisons and similarities to Lost, the writers intend them to be very different shows. To them, Lost concerned itself with redemption, while Once Upon a Time is about [...] "hope". Lost co-creator Damon Lindelof aided {{in the development of the}} series as a consultant, but had no official credit for the pilot.|$|E

Bush being reelected, {{and the birth of}} Vedder's daughter - [...] "Now that I see it as my daughter's planet, I'm even more (angry)." [...] McCready said, [...] "We all feel that we're living in tumultuous, frightening times, and that ranges from the Iraq war to Hurricane Katrina to wiretapping to anything that smacks of totalitarianism. And just bad political decisions being made. We feel that as Americans, and we're frustrated. So a lot of those feelings have come out in these songs." [...] Vedder also added that among all the dark themes [...] "the hope {{was going to be in}} the guitar solos. It was the guitars and drums going <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> was going to lift you out of the dark abyss that I had painted." [...] The Iraq War is addressed in the songs [...] "World Wide Suicide", [...] "Marker in the Sand", and [...] "Army Reserve". The lyrics of [...] "World Wide Suicide" [...] depict anger against the war. Other themes addressed on the album include alcohol use ("Severed Hand"), religion ("Marker in the Sand"), poverty ("Unemployable"), leaving everything behind to seek a fresh start ("Gone"), and loneliness ("Come Back").|$|E

500|$|For {{the next}} two years, Cooney and Morrisett {{researched}} and developed the new show, acquiring $8 million funding for Sesame Street, and establishing the CTW. Due to her professional experience, Cooney always assumed the show's natural network would be PBS. Morrisett was amenable to broadcast it by commercial stations, but all three major networks rejected the idea. [...] Davis, considering Sesame Streets licensing income years later, termed their decision [...] "a billion-dollar blunder". Morrisett was responsible for fund acquisition, and was so successful <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> writer Lee D. Mitgang later said that it [...] "defied conventional media wisdom". [...] Cooney {{was responsible for the}} show's creative development, and for hiring the production and research staff for the CTW. [...] The Carnegie Corporation provided their initial $1 million grant, and Morrisett, using his contacts, procured additional multimillion-dollar grants from the U.S. federal government, the Arthur Vining Davis Foundations, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and the Ford Foundation. [...] Morrisett's friend Harold Howe, who was the commissioner for the U.S. Department of Education, promised $4 million, half of the new organization's budget. [...] The Carnegie Corporation donated an additional $1 million. [...] Mitgang stated, [...] "Had Morrisett been any less effective in lining up financial support, Cooney's report likely would have become just another long-forgotten foundation idea". [...] Funds gained from a combination of government agencies and private foundations protected them from the economic problems experienced by commercial networks, but caused difficulty for procuring future funding.|$|E

2500|$|In {{a journal}} entry {{written in the}} 1970s, Oates sarcastically {{addressed}} her critics, writing, [...] "So many books! so many!

[...] but I work hard, and long, and as the hours roll by I seem to create more than I anticipate; more, certainly, than the literary world allows for a 'serious' writer. Yet I have more stories to tell, and more novels [...] ". In The New York Review of Books in 2007, Michael Dirda suggested that disparaging criticism of Oates [...] "derives from reviewer's angst: How does one judge {{a new book by}} Oates when one is not familiar with most of the backlist? Where does one start?" ...|$|E

2500|$|In April 2008, NFL draft expert Mel Kiper Jr. named Ringer as {{the best}} back {{in the class of}} 2009. However, when Mel Kiper revised his 2009 draft choices in February 2009, Ringer was not listed among Kiper's top five running backs. It was {{revealed}} Ringer has been playing on a torn lateral meniscus, which he had surgery on six days after the season ended. Ringer has said he has worked out at the combine with his knee at [...] "80%". Ringer skipped the 2009 Senior Bowl because of his injury. Despite the injury, Ringer chose to participate in the 40-yard dash at the NFL combine. He clocked in at 4.59. Ringer was quoted as saying [...] "I personally was disappointed because I know I'm a lot faster than that. But I was able to do that just coming off knee surgery, so if I look <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> way, I'm happy." [...] He finished third among running backs in the 20-yard shuttle (4.11 seconds) and fifth in the three-cone drill (6.87 seconds). During the combine, Ringer said he interviewed with 12 teams. ESPN.com ranked him as the 8th best running back in the draft. When Scouts Inc. graded Ringer, they gave him a 1 (Exceptional) in Character. They said of Ringer, [...] "No off-the-field issues we are aware of. Coaches and teammates have only positive things to say about him. Outstanding intangibles." [...] Ringer was a projected 3rd Round pick. Another site lists him as a mid-second round draft choice. Ringer has drawn comparisons to NFL players Mike Hart and Chester Taylor. His strengths are listed as build, toughness, and patience, while his weaknesses are listed as height, breakaway speed, open field elusiveness, and injuries. A Dayton Daily News article states that Ringer is [...] "Still projected as a 2nd-rounder", despite the injury. The same article states that Ringer interviewed with the Cleveland Browns and Cincinnati Bengals at the NFL combine.|$|E
