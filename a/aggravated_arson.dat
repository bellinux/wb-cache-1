5|$|Proof of {{specific}} intent to endanger life is unnecessary {{on a charge}} of attempting this offence. In Attorney General's Reference No. 3 of 1992 (1994), {{on a charge of}} attempted <b>aggravated</b> <b>arson,</b> it was held to be sufficient for the prosecution to establish a specific intent to cause damage by fire and that the defendant was reckless as to whether life would thereby be endangered.|$|E
5|$|Upon her {{arrest on}} November 22, 1995, Green {{was charged with}} two counts of first-degree murder, two counts of {{attempted}} first-degree murder, and one count of <b>aggravated</b> <b>arson.</b> She was held on $3,000,000 bail—the highest ever required {{at that point in}} time by Johnson County, Kansas—and maintained her innocence throughout pre-trial motions and a show cause hearing. However, when the defense's own investigators verified the strength of forensic evidence against Green, she agreed to an Alford plea to all charges. On May 30, 1996, she was sentenced to two concurrent forty-year prison sentences. Green has petitioned for a new trial twice since her conviction. Her first request, which she eventually withdrew, was based on a claim of having been rendered incompetent for plea bargaining by the psychiatric medications she was taking at the time of her hearings; her second, which was denied by a judge, claimed that the evidence used to convict her of arson had been rendered obsolete by scientific advances.|$|E
500|$|Green {{was arrested}} on November 22 in Kansas City, Missouri, shortly after {{dropping}} off her daughter for ballet practice. Though Green's attorneys had requested that if arrested, Green be allowed to turn herself in voluntarily, the police and district attorney felt that her behavior was too unpredictable, and chose to arrest her without warning. [...] Green was charged with two counts of first-degree murder, two counts of attempted first-degree murder, and one count of <b>aggravated</b> <b>arson.</b> In a subsequent press conference, District Attorney Paul J. Morrison cited a [...] "domestic situation" [...] as the motive for Green's alleged crimes. Green was initially held in a Missouri jail, then extradited to Johnson County Adult Detention Center in Kansas, on $3,000,000 bond, the highest bail ever asked for in Johnson County.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the early}} morning of January 1, 2012, a fire broke out at the Westclox {{compound}} in Peru, IL. The fire destroyed about 50% of the structure. Two teens were charged with aggravated arson; Steven M. Gallacher (then 17) of LaSalle, IL, and an unidentified minor (then 16). The fire required firefighters and police from 20 surrounding municipalities to extinguish. One firefighter, LaSalle fireman Steve Smith, sustained a career-ending injury when a firehose attached to a hydrant popped loose and the metal coupling on the end {{hit him in the}} leg. Gallacher was convicted of <b>aggravated</b> <b>arson</b> on October 11, 2012, with a sentence of 6-30 years without the possibility of parole. Gallacher's sentence of <b>aggravated</b> <b>arson</b> was the direct result of the fire plus Smith's injury.|$|E
50|$|Men are disproportionally the offenders, {{and women}} disproportionally the victims. Those that commit violent crimes are {{overwhelmingly}} male—rape (98%), armed robbery (92%), drunk driving (90%), murder (88%), <b>aggravated</b> assault (87%), <b>arson</b> (86%), and family violence (83%). According to Michael Kimmel, hegemonic masculinity creates {{a culture of}} entitlement, silence, and protection, which effectively normalizes violence against women and silences victims of violence.|$|R
25|$|The decline {{was led by}} a 31 {{percent drop}} {{in the number of}} homicides from 13 to 9. Motor vehicle theft fell 11.4 percent. Burglary was down 6.1 percent. Reported robberies, rapes and {{property}} crimes also fell. There were slight increases in the number of <b>aggravated</b> assaults and <b>arsons.</b> The number of violent crimes in the city has fallen more than 30 percent since 2006.|$|R
50|$|The case {{received}} {{national media}} attention, providing Court TV {{with some of}} its highest ratings ever in its film coverage of the trial. Some of the interest centered on whether she was the submissive victim or the jealous {{driving force behind the}} murder. Under Texas law, murder is the intentional killing of another human being, while capital murder includes murder with an underlying felony of kidnapping, robbery, <b>aggravated</b> sexual assault, <b>arson,</b> or obstruction. In this case, the prosecutor believed that Jones was deceptively lured from her home by Graham asking her for a bogus date, or she would not have been in the car. Moreover, the couple committed obstruction when Zamora allegedly ordered Graham to stalk Jones into the field and to shoot her so that she could not tell the authorities.|$|R
50|$|Recklessness will {{sometimes}} suffice for 'circumstances' of the crime. To {{be liable for}} attempted rape a defendant need not actually intend to have non-consensual intercourse, mere recklessness towards the lack of consent is enough (R v Khan). Likewise with attempted <b>aggravated</b> <b>arson,</b> recklessness towards loss of life will suffice (A-G's Reference #3 1992).|$|E

5000|$|By {{the time}} of Cosell's 1977 commentary, dozens of {{buildings}} were being burnt in the South Bronx every day, sometimes whole blocks {{at a time and}} usually far more than the fire department could keep up with, leaving the area perpetually blanketed in a pall of smoke. Firefighters from the period reported responding to as many as 7 fully involved structure fires in a single shift, too many to even bother returning to the station house between calls. The local police precincts—already struggling and failing to contain the massive wave of drug and gang crime invading the Bronx—had long since stopped bothering to investigate the fires, as there were simply too many to track. During this period, the NYPD's 41st Precinct Station House at 1086 Simpson Street became famously known as [...] "Fort Apache, The Bronx" [...] as it struggled to deal with the overwhelming surge of violent crime, which for the entirety of the 1970s (and part of the early 1980s) made South Bronx the murder, rape, robbery, <b>aggravated</b> assault and <b>arson</b> capital of America.|$|R

50|$|Two unnamed juveniles were {{initially}} charged with <b>aggravated</b> <b>arson</b> in {{connection to the}} fires; however, charges were later dropped due to language in an agreement between the State of Tennessee and the Department of the Interior which excluded state jurisdiction from prosecuting criminal activities that occurred entirely within the park.

Two others, Housein Arsani and Mohammad Mohammadamini, were sentenced to six years in prison, while the fourth, Meysam Mohammadyeh, who was a minor at the time of the offence, received three years in a juvenile care facility. Both the defendants and the prosection appealed the sentences. The court of appeals upheld two of the verdicts, but the two verdicts of six years' imprisonment were raised to seven years.|$|E

5000|$|In 2009, Rickie Lee Fowler {{was charged}} with igniting the Old Fire.
