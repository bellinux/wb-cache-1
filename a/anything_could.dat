25|$|This growth led the California {{legislature}} to divide Los Angeles County and create Orange County {{as a separate}} political entity on March 11, 1889.

It may be that the EKLR laid its sidings at Richborough Port in isolation before <b>anything</b> <b>could</b> cross the bridge, in order to establish its presence. The mystery remains as to when the first actual train ran to Richborough Port.|$|E
25|$|As a day boat, a {{substantial}} proportion of Chauncey Vibbards passengers were sightseers rather than travellers. To cater for this clientele, Chauncey Vibbards main saloon was located forward, offering {{the best possible}} views of the picturesque scenery of the Hudson. A promenade deck was also installed. Considered of no less importance, perhaps, was the boat's extensive larderfrom which it is said almost <b>anything</b> <b>could</b> be ordered. Chauncey Vibbards captain was Dave Hitchcock, a partner of Van Santvoord.|$|E
25|$|Triple H {{suffered}} an injury during the 2002 Survivor Series match with swelling {{on the inside}} of his throat which put pressure on his esophagus and trachea. This was caused after Rob Van Dam performed the Five Star Frog Splash off the top of one of the chambers. Triple H also expressed concern that he might have broken his wrist and noted <b>anything</b> <b>could</b> have caused it.

25|$|Charybdis {{could have}} inflicted {{considerable}} damage but the Germans {{had only been}} confirmed on radar but no visual contact had been made. A total of 24 torpedoes were launched by the Germans. Lookouts suddenly saw the white straight foaming tracks of torpedoes and before <b>anything</b> <b>could</b> be done Charybdis was hit {{on the port side}} by T-23 (Friedrich-Karl Paul), flooding No 2 dynamo room and B boiler room. The port electrical ring main failed and she listed twenty degrees to port and stopped. Torpedoes narrowly missed Wensleydale and Grenville and then a second torpedo from T-27 struck Charybdis. This time the aft engine room was hit which flooded and cut all electrical power increased the list to fifty degrees.|$|E
25|$|James Lyons {{was born}} in Manhattan's old Ninth Ward. His {{father was in the}} Produce {{business}} and the family decided to move to the Bronx when Lyons was 3. He once reminisced {{in an interview that he}} used to drive a pony and a cart under High Bridge and sell fruit to the locals. When he graduated from Public School 11 at age 13, he went to go work as an office boy in the office of the Surpass Leather Company. He would later regret not staying in school and graduating from High School. He eventually moved his way up in the ranks of the company and became a Salesman. Lyons told his men that with the right approach, <b>anything</b> <b>could</b> be sold to anyone. To drive his point home, in his career he sold enough leather to cover four million pairs of women's feet.|$|E

500|$|Tessa {{was born}} on August 28, 1958 in Lille, France. When she was seven years old, {{she fell in love}} {{for the first time with}} then-nineteen-year-old Alan Rothwood (Anthony Head). Tessa recalls in [...] "" [...] that she was [...] "heartbroken" [...] when he {{completed}} his studies and left the country. [...] She remembered that at her first Christmas party in the ballroom of Alan's house, she [...] "couldn't believe <b>anything</b> <b>could</b> be so beautiful." [...] Tessa mentions in [...] "" [...] that she was educated at the Sorbonne in Paris, France.|$|E
500|$|At that time, {{it seemed}} a place in which <b>anything</b> <b>could</b> happen—new {{industrial}} processes, new ways of thinking (the Manchester School, promoting free trade and laissez-faire), new classes or groups in society, new religious sects, and new forms of labour organisation. It attracted educated visitors {{from all parts of}} Britain and Europe. A saying capturing this sense of innovation survives today: [...] "What Manchester does today, {{the rest of the world}} does tomorrow."•• Manchester's golden age was perhaps the last quarter of the 19th century. Many of the great public buildings (including Manchester Town Hall) date from then. The city's cosmopolitan atmosphere contributed to a vibrant culture, which included the Hallé Orchestra. In 1889, when county councils were created in England, the municipal borough became a county borough with even greater autonomy.|$|E

500|$|Poptimism (also called popism) is {{a mode of}} {{discourse}} which holds that pop music deserves the same respect as rock music and is as authentic and as worthy of professional critique and interest. It positions itself {{as an antidote to}} rockism and developed following Carl Wilson's book about Céline Dion's album Let's Talk About Love and Sanneh's 2004 essay against rockism in The New York Times. In the article, Sanneh asks music listeners to [...] "stop pretending that serious rock songs will last forever, as if <b>anything</b> <b>could,</b> and that shiny pop songs are inherently disposable, as if that were necessarily a bad thing.

500|$|Series creator Chris Carter {{noted that}} the episode's {{creation}} [...] "was {{the culmination of a}} lot of ideas. Generally, when we pitch stories to the staff everyone comments on them, and Darin Morgan called this the kitchen sink episode, because it had so much in it, he didn't know how we would pull it off. But I'm very proud of the script. David Duchovny and I worked quite closely on the story and {{he had a lot of}} input, and then I sat down and wrote the script". He felt that the episode ended the season in the best manner possible, asking more questions than it answered. The episode tried to make similar cliffhangers as the previous season finale, with revelations such as Mulder's father being part of the conspiracy and later killed to [...] "prove <b>anything</b> <b>could</b> happen in [...] The X-Files".|$|E
500|$|If Hurcomb {{persisted in}} {{adhering}} to his {{terms of reference}} and approved the power station, but Durham Rural District Council then withheld planning consent {{on the grounds of}} the objections, NESCo would be entitled to compensation for their losses due to the delay and building on a new site. [...] The District Council would be liable for this but it was out of the question that they would be able to afford the large amount involved and the Government wished to avoid stepping in to pay themselves. [...] If the inquiry could be persuaded to find against NESCo then no compensation would be payable and Hurcomb came under pressure from Ministers to do just that. [...] Hurcomb argued that this would be denying compensation to those entitled to it and by April 1945 the decision on the station was still being delayed. The chairman of NESCo at the time voiced his anger in The Times, and Frank Tribe, secretary of the Ministry of Fuel and Power, wrote to Hurcomb asking if <b>anything</b> <b>could</b> be done to bring the inquiry to a decision.|$|E

500|$|Digital Spy's Morgan Jeffery also awarded it five stars, {{though he}} felt Amy and Rory's breakup was [...] "a little {{difficult}} to buy" [...] {{as it was}} resolved quickly, even if the situation was [...] "sensitively handled" [...] and [...] "deftly performed". Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club graded [...] "Asylum of the Daleks" [...] as a [...] "B+", also writing {{that he had a}} [...] "quibble" [...] with the Ponds' marriage issue as it had not been foreshadowed, but ultimately felt that the episode [...] "gets the season off to a great start while creating a sense that <b>anything</b> <b>could</b> happen". IGN's Matt Risley rated the episode as 8.5 out of 10, finding that the [...] "only downside" [...] was that [...] "it felt less a tale about the Daleks than an adventure that just happened to have them in it". Maureen Ryan, writing for The Huffington Post, felt it was a [...] "ripping start to the season" [...] that redeemed the Daleks from [...] "Victory of the Daleks". While she commended Gillan and Darvill's acting during Amy and Rory's emotional confrontation, she noted that they were not a couple that would break up because of infertility.|$|E
500|$|As {{soon as the}} map of Britain was {{published}} Mercator was invited to undertake the surveying and mapping of Lorraine (Lotharingia). This was a new venture {{for him in the}} sense that never before had he collected the raw data for a new regional map. He was then 52, already an old man by the norms of that century, and he may well have had reservations about the undertaking. Accompanied by his son Bartholemew, Mercator meticulously triangulated his way around the forests, hills and steep sided valleys of Lorraine, difficult terrain as different from the Low Countries as <b>anything</b> <b>could</b> be. He never committed anything to paper but he may have confided in his friend Ghim who would later write: [...] "The journey through Lorraine gravely imperiled his life and so weakened him that he came very near to a serious breakdown and mental derangement {{as a result of his}} terrifying experiences." [...] Mercator returned home to convalesce, leaving Bartholemew to complete the survey. No map {{was published}} at the time but Mercator did provide a single drawn copy for the Duke and later he would incorporate this map into his atlas.|$|E
500|$|Michael {{blockaded}} Thomas's {{cities of}} refuge but organized no assaults, instead aiming to capture them peacefully by wearing out their defenders. His strategy {{was motivated by}} the political and propaganda expedient of appearing merciful—"in order to spare Christian blood", as Michael himself {{put it in his}} letter to Louis the Pious—but also, according to the chroniclers, by fear of demonstrating to the Bulgarians that the Byzantine cities' fortifications could fall to attack. In Asia Minor, Thomas's partisans hoped to lure Michael away by allowing the Arabs free passage to raid the provinces of Opsikion and Optimaton, which were loyal to the emperor. Michael was unmoved and continued the blockade. His troops barred access to Arcadiopolis [...] with a ditch. To conserve supplies, the blockaded troops sent away women and children, followed by those too old, wounded, or otherwise incapable of bearing arms. After five months of blockade, Thomas's loyalists were eventually forced to eat starved horses and their hides. Some began deserting by lowering themselves with ropes over the city walls or jumping from them. Thomas sent messengers to Bizye, where the blockade was less close, to arrange a relief attempt by Anastasius. Before <b>anything</b> <b>could</b> be done, however, the exhausted troops at Arcadiopolis surrendered their leader in exchange for an imperial pardon. Thomas was delivered to Michael seated on a donkey and bound in chains. He was prostrated before the emperor, who placed his foot on his defeated rival's neck and ordered his hands and feet cut off and his corpse impaled. Thomas pleaded for clemency with the words [...] "Have mercy on me, oh True Emperor!" [...] Michael only asked his captive to reveal whether any of his own senior officials had had dealings with Thomas. Before Thomas could respond, the Logothete of the Course, John Hexaboulios, advised against hearing whatever claims a defeated rebel might make. Michael agreed, and Thomas's sentence was carried out immediately.|$|E
