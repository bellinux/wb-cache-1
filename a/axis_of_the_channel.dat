The P region functions as a channel gate since it prevents ion permeation in the closed state. The pore may be hindered by small conformational changes in this region. The P region acts as an ion selectivity filter that changes structure in the open conformation. In the open state, four identical subunits contribute a single P-loop region, which forms a selectivity filter.|$|E
40|$|We study a {{collection}} of polar self-propelled particles confined to a long two-dimensional channel. We write the coupled hydrodynamic equations of motion for density and polarisation order parameter. At two confined boundaries, density is fixed to the mean and orientation is anti-parallel with fixed magnitude of polarisation. Such boundary conditions make our system similar to a sheared suspension of self-propelled particles, which has many practical applications. Antiparallel alignment at the two confined boundaries and alignment inside the channel create rolls of orientation along the long <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>channel.</b> For zero self-propulsion speed, density and orientation fields are decoupled and density remains homogeneous inside the channel. For finite self-propelled speed, density inhomogeneities develop and these rolls move along the long <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>channel.</b> Density inhomogeneity increases sharply with increasing the self propulsion speed and then reaches a maximum and again decreases for very large speeds.

Neglecting the entrance and exit regions we obtain the steady-state solution that is independent of position along the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>channel,</b> so that the flow, which comprises a primary flow {{in the direction of}} the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>channel</b> and a secondary flow in the cross-sectional plane, depends only on position in the two-dimensional cross-section of the channel. A thin-film approximation yields explicit expressions for the fluid velocity and pressure in terms of the free-surface shape, the latter satisfying a nonlinear ordinary differential equation that has a simple exact solution in the special case of a channel of rectangular cross-section. The predictions of the thin-film model are shown to be in good agreement with much more computationally intensive solutions of the small-helix-torsion Navier–Stokes equations. The present work has particular relevance to spiral particle separators used in the mineral-processing industry. The validity of an assumption commonly used in modelling flow in spiral separators, namely, that the flow in the outer region of the separator cross-section is described by a free vortex, is shown to depend on the problem parameters.

In this paper the feasibility of ultrasonic manipulation of particles and cells along a microfluidic channel with an array is investigated. An array integrated into a multilayer resonator structure drives particles towards the pressure nodal plane along the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>channel,</b> then towards the acoustic velocity maximum centered above the driven elements. Switching the active elements along the array moves trapped particles along the microfluidic channel. A 1 -D array coupled to a rectangular capillary has been simulated and fabricated for experimental testing. The device has a 300 μm thick channel for a half wavelength resonance near 2. 5 MHz, and 500 μm element pitch. Simulation and experiment confirm the expected trapping of particles at {{the centre of the}} channel and above the set of driven elements. Experiments demonstrated the feasibility of controlling the position of particles {{along the length of the}} channel by switching the driven array elements...|$|E

Its real symmetry is P 6 (3) /mmc, {{the same as the}} topological one, where a = 18. 215 Angstrom, c = 7. 634 Angstrom. TMA molecules are located inside the gmelinite cage, with two possible orientations, which are symmetric with respect to the plane passing through the center and orthogonal to <b>the</b> threefold <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cage. Sodium cations are distributed over two sites: one, at <b>the</b> center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 8 -ring <b>channel,</b> hosts most of Na and is 8 -fold coordinated to six framework oxygens and two water molecules, while the other, located along <b>the</b> <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 12 -ring <b>channel,</b> coordinates nine H 2...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe origin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> loess {{deposited}} in northern Brittany can be only understood if its original extension is carefully delineated. Marine sedimentological {{data show that}} there are no loess deposits under <b>the</b> English <b>Channel,</b> because they have been removed during the various Pleistocene and Holocene transgressive episodes. However, indirect evidence, and particularly study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> submerged Pleistocene conglomerate which resulted from <b>the</b> cementing <b>of</b> beach deposits overlain by loessic silts when the sea was at a lower level, supports the idea that loess did not extend north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> English <b>Channel.</b> <b>The</b> northern limit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> loess deposits corresponds with the Hurd Deep. Their southern boundary is located onshore and coincides with the north Armorican coastal loess belt. Comparison between the modern garnet-rich sands sampled in <b>the</b> centre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> western and eastern English Channel with loess of Normandy and Brittany show that <b>the</b> main part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> onshore loess originated in the fluvial sediments accumulated in <b>the</b> <b>Channel</b> River. Transportation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dust from <b>the</b> valley <b>of</b> this river to Normandy and Brittany indicates southward oriented paleo-winds. <b>The</b> contributions <b>of</b> frost shattering <b>of</b> <b>the</b> offshore chalky formations, the in situ detrital particles produced in northern Brittany, and <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> glacial grinding which occurred in southern England seem to be rather limited.

40|$|The {{high-pressure}} behaviour and the P-induced structural {{evolution of}} a synthetic zeolite Rb 7 NaGa 8 Si 12 O 40 · 3 H 2 O (with edingtonite-type structure) were investigated both by in situ synchrotron powder diffraction (with a diamond anvil cell and the methanol:ethanol:water =  16 : 3 : 1 mixture as pressure-transmitting fluid) up to 3. 27 GPa and by ab initio first-principles computational modelling. No evidence of phase transition or penetration of P-fluid molecules was observed within the P-range investigated. <b>The</b> isothermal equation <b>of</b> state was determined; V 0 and KT 0 refined with a second-order Birch–Murnaghan equation of state are V 0  =  1311. 3 (2) Å 3 and KT 0  =  29. 8 (7) GPa. The main deformation mechanism (at the atomic scale) {{in response to the}} applied pressure is represented by <b>the</b> cooperative rotation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> secondary building units (SBU) about their chain axis (i. e. [001]). <b>The</b> direct consequence <b>of</b> SBU anti-rotation on <b>the</b> zeolitic <b>channels</b> parallel to [001] is the increase in pore ellipticity with pressure, in response to <b>the</b> extension <b>of</b> <b>the</b> major <b>axis</b> and to <b>the</b> contraction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> minor <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> elliptical <b>channel</b> parallel to [001]. <b>The</b> effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> applied pressure on <b>the</b> bonding configuration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> extra-framework content is only secondary.
