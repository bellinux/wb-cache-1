2500|$|... "I {{have always}} {{believed}} {{myself to be}} possessed of two souls, one that lives {{on the surface of}} life, pleasing and pleased; the other as deep and as unfathomable as the ocean; <b>a</b> <b>mystery</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and all who know me." ...|$|E
2500|$|How [...] {{could have}} made a daily {{observation}} of my balcony is still <b>a</b> <b>mystery</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> At the time, the back of my building was not enclosed so anyone could have driven in the back alley to observe my balcony. In addition, my balcony and the back of the apartment complex faced onto a courtyard or back area that was shared with a number of other apartment or office buildings in the area. My balcony could have been seen from dozens of apartments or offices.|$|E
2500|$|... "We {{are heavily}} {{influenced}} by Hell and don't mind admitting it" [...] Andy says with obvious admiration. [...] "The singer even {{taught me how to}} play guitar! We're not a deliberate copycat of Hell in any way though. They were a great band and it's <b>a</b> <b>mystery</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> why they never got anywhere. To be compared to them we don't mind in the least, we would take it more as an honour than anything. We've just done a charity show at Trent Poly dedicated to Hell's guitarist Dave Halliday who committed suicide in January. All the money went to his favourite charity, Cancer Research." ...|$|E
60|$|We were {{completely}} at cross-purposes. She had taken something for granted which was <b>an</b> unfathomable <b>mystery</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
60|$|The first {{necessity}} was to {{know something}} of the man. Thus far, {{the true story of}} his life was <b>an</b> impenetrable <b>mystery</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am glad to}} see you," [...] Mr. Sabin said. [...] "This {{affair of}} Duson's remains <b>a</b> {{complete}} <b>mystery</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I am looking to you <b>to</b> help <b>me</b> solve it." ...|$|R
60|$|I was {{astonished}} to hear him, but his last words were <b>a</b> <b>mystery</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
60|$|What {{he meant}} {{was at the}} time <b>a</b> <b>mystery</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I have since come to understand.|$|E
60|$|Jeeves came {{in looking}} {{as fresh as}} a dewy violet. It's <b>a</b> <b>mystery</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> how he does it.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, sir," [...] was the prompt answer. [...] "It's <b>a</b> {{complete}} <b>mystery</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> All I {{know about}} it is, that I left the watch and chain on the stand {{at the head of}} my bed when I went to sleep and this morning they were gone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am {{completely}} puzzled,' he replied; 'what Dorothy {{means by}} asking <b>me</b> <b>to</b> come with you, and to answer questions, is <b>a</b> complete <b>mystery</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> Please don't ask me any questions now. I have evidently put my foot into it somehow, though I have {{not the least}} idea how.' ...|$|R
500|$|Another interpretation, that avoids duality, is the De Broglie–Bohm theory: known also as the pilot-wave model. In that theory, the photon is both, {{wave and}} particle. [...] "This idea seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> so natural and simple, {{to resolve the}} wave-particle dilemma in such a clear and {{ordinary}} way, that it is <b>a</b> great <b>mystery</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{that it was so}} generally ignored", J.S.Bell.|$|R
6000|$|... "Your {{point of}} view," [...] he remarked, [...] "is <b>a</b> <b>mystery</b> <b>to</b> <b>me!</b> I cannot {{see how the}} future of an unfledged brat like that can {{possibly}} concern you!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{is as much}} <b>a</b> <b>mystery</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> as to you," [...] Gavin answered, [...] "but {{she will}} give me the money, {{and that is all}} I ask of her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Wery {{glad to see}} you, Sammy,' {{said the}} elder Mr. Weller, 'though how you've managed to get over your mother-in-law, is <b>a</b> <b>mystery</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I only vish you'd write me out the receipt, that's all.' ...|$|E
60|$|A stupid young woman, in my place, {{would have}} {{discovered}} {{that this was not}} natural, and that Miss Jillgall was presenting herself <b>to</b> <b>me</b> in disguise, <b>to</b> reach some secret end of her own. I am not a stupid young woman; I ought to have had at my service penetration enough to see through and through Cousin Selina. Well! Cousin Selina was <b>an</b> impenetrable <b>mystery</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... "Fireball" [...] {{is a song}} by the English {{rock band}} Deep Purple, from the album of the same name. It was Deep Purple's second single release in 1971, and peaked at number 15 on the UK Singles chart. [...] It {{is one of several}} songs based on Ian Gillan's real life experiences: [...] "She was <b>a</b> {{complete}} <b>mystery</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> This is another tale of unrequited love", he explained.|$|R
2500|$|In the {{resulting}} representation, {{also called the}} de Broglie–Bohm theory or Bohmian mechanics, the wave-particle duality vanishes, and explains the wave behaviour as a scattering with wave appearance, because the particle's motion is subject to a guiding equation or quantum potential. [...] "This idea seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> so natural and simple, to resolve the wave-particle dilemma in such a clear and ordinary way, that it is <b>a</b> great <b>mystery</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{that it was so}} generally ignored", J.S.Bell.|$|R
60|$|Who {{they were}} {{or where they}} came from was <b>a</b> <b>mystery</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> That they were the outpost of some {{powerful}} black nation seemed likely, yet where the seat of that nation lay I could not guess.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dr. McCarthy," [...] said I, [...] "this is all <b>a</b> <b>mystery</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I {{should be}} glad {{if you could}} explain to me who this man is, and why you have tolerated him so long in your house." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{want to get}} to {{the bottom}} of what has all along been <b>a</b> <b>mystery</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and that is how my father came to take those shares, just at the moment when the bank was so shaky." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear madam," [...] he replied, [...] "you are {{blaming the}} wrong person. I confess I {{do not know}} my mind, and what little I do know of it I do not like. I did not make it, I did not select it. I am more {{dissatisfied}} with it than you can possibly be. It is <b>a</b> greater <b>mystery</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{than it is to}} you, and I have to live with it. You should pity not blame me." ...|$|R
60|$|Putting {{together}} what I had just heard, and what I {{had seen in}} the cell, I drew the right conclusion at last. The woman, whose position in life had been thus far <b>an</b> impenetrable <b>mystery</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> now stood revealed as one, among other objects of the Prisoner's jealousy, during her disastrous married life. A serious doubt occurred <b>to</b> <b>me</b> as <b>to</b> the authority under which the husband's mistress might be acting, after the husband's death. I instantly put it to the test.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Mystery</b> <b>to</b> <b>Me</b> {{contained}} the Welch song [...] "Hypnotized", which {{got a lot}} of airplay on the radio in the United States. However, due <b>to</b> <b>an</b> aborted tour, <b>Mystery</b> <b>to</b> <b>Me</b> only reached #67 in the States, as that market was becoming increasingly important to the band, which was shipping albums in the respectable range of 250,000 units at the time.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{not equal}} to it, lad--the forest {{is almost as}} much of <b>a</b> <b>mystery</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> as the day I landed here. Do come, {{and then we can}} all go back to your home with all {{possible}} speed." ...|$|E
60|$|To {{say that}} this strange letter was <b>a</b> <b>mystery</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> seems an {{inadequate}} way of stating the matter. I was completely bewildered, nor could I even guess who the writer might be, think and ponder as I might.|$|E
6000|$|... 'You haven't the power. You {{have only}} the ideas--the {{ideas and the}} little cheap impulses. How you could have kept at your work for ten years {{steadily}} is <b>a</b> <b>mystery</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> So you are really going,--a month before you need?' ...|$|E
60|$|My first impulse, on glancing through Mr. Marx's brief note, {{was to show}} it to Mr. Ravenor; but, after a second's consideration, I {{changed my}} mind. Mr. Marx was <b>a</b> {{complete}} <b>mystery</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> At times it seemed possible that the interest which he undoubtedly showed in me was genuine and kindly, and I struggled against my dislike of the man. Then I remembered his brutal conduct to the lunatic and the other inexplicable parts of his behaviour, and the darkest suspicions and doubts began to take shape in my imagination.|$|R
6000|$|... "No. It is desirable, else God {{would not}} have left it there. `Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?' There is a need be, I doubt not, for mystery, {{and there is no}} need for our being distressed by it, for what we know not now we shall know hereafter. But there is much cause for anxiety lest we, either through wilful ignorance, or carelessness, or stupidity, should allow that to remain {{involved}} in mystery which is made plain by revelation. The way of salvation was <b>an</b> insurmountable <b>mystery</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> once, but since you gave me that poor man's Testament, Aileen, it has become very plain and very dear <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> through Jesus Christ." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No {{letters for}} me!" [...] cried Miss Peppy, {{with a slight}} look of disappointment; [...] "but, to be sure, I'm not at home, though, after all, letters might come <b>to</b> <b>me</b> when I'm away if they were only rightly addressed, but letters are never legible on the back; it is <b>a</b> perfect <b>mystery</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> how the postmen ever find out where to go to with letters, and they are such {{illiterate}} men too! But what can one expect {{in a world of}} inconsistencies, where things are all topsy-turvy, so to speak, though I don't like slang, and never use it except when there is a want of a proper what-d'ye-call-it to express one's thingumy-jigs. Don't you think so, Captain Bowels?" ...|$|R
60|$|We knelt close {{together}} at her feet. I could feel Mary's heart throbbing, as she pressed nearer and nearer to my side. I {{could feel my}} own heart quickening its beat, with a fear that was <b>a</b> <b>mystery</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
6000|$|The mate {{looked at}} the skipper and pushed his cap back. [...] "We {{had no reason to}} think otherwise," [...] he said shortly. [...] "It’s <b>a</b> <b>mystery</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> altogether. He can’t have gone home by train because he had no money." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For {{eighteen}} {{years it was}} as much <b>a</b> <b>mystery</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> as to you, Charles. But now at last the guilt is manifest. Stand forward, Ambrose, and tell your story as frankly and as fully as you have told it to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am sorry," [...] Wrayson answered, [...] "but I cannot {{very well}} be more explicit. The matter {{is one in which}} a good many other people are concerned, and I might add that it is <b>a</b> hopeless <b>mystery</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> All I know is that a crime was committed; that this young lady was present under {{suspicious}} circumstances; that I, in certain evidence I had to give, concealed the fact of her presence; and that now a third person turns up, who also knew of the young lady's presence, but who was not called upon to give evidence, who is working on his own account to clear up the whole affair. He happens to be a friend of mine, and he warned <b>me</b> frankly <b>to</b> clear out." ...|$|R
5000|$|Lacordaire {{supported}} the Revolutions of 1848 in the Italian {{states and the}} later French invasion of the Papal States: [...] "We must not at all be too alarmed by the possible fall of Pius IX," [...] he wrote to Montalembert. He found the Falloux Laws a disappointment despite their attempt to establish a degree of freedom for Catholic secondary education. Opposed to the election of Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte, Lacordaire condemned his coup d’état of 2 December 1851. He retired from public life, and later explained: [...] "My hour had come to disappear with the others. Many Catholics followed another line, and separating themselves from all they had said and done, threw themselves with ardor before absolute power. This schism that I do not want at all to call here an apostasy, has always been <b>a</b> great <b>mystery</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and <b>a</b> great sadness." ...|$|R
60|$|Although the {{religious}} {{theories of the}} islands were <b>a</b> complete <b>mystery</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> their practical every-day operation could not be concealed. I frequently passed the little temples reposing {{in the shadows of}} the Taboo Groves, and beheld the offerings—mouldy fruit spread out upon a rude altar, or hanging in half-decayed baskets around some uncouth, jolly-looking images. I was present during the continuance of the festival. I daily beheld the grinning idols marshalled rank and file in the Hoolah Hoolah ground, and was often in the habit of meeting those whom I supposed to be the priests. But the temples seemed to be abandoned to solitude; the festival had been nothing more than a jovial mingling of the tribe; the idols were quite as harmless as any other logs of wood; and the priests were the merriest dogs in the valley.|$|R
