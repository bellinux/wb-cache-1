500|$|The {{fragrance}} called [...] "L" [...] {{was launched}} in September, 2007 at Soho House in New York City. Stefani worked with perfumer Harry Fremont to develop the scent. Stefani described the fragrance as [...] "it's another thing you can wear and <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> {{can be part of}} creatively. I created it for myself -- it's like me shrunk into a box." [...] The perfume is a blend of the aromas of hyacinth, white freesia, fresh pear, violet, jasmine, rose, lily, sweet pea, orange blossom, peach, frangipani, heliotrope and musk. The perfume was available in 50ml and 100ml bottles.|$|E

This song has been interpreted as a personal renunciation of armed conflict, and ends with the hope his song will serve a listener as [...] "a shield against the enemy". He would later remark, Lover, Lover, Lover' was born over there; the whole world has its eyes riveted on this tragic and complex conflict. Then again, I am faithful to certain ideas, inevitably. I hope that those of which I am in favour will gain." [...] Asked which side he supported in the Arab-Israeli conflict, Cohen responded, [...] "I don't want to speak of wars or sides … Personal process is one thing, it's blood, it's the identification one feels with their roots and their origins. The militarism I practice {{as a person and}} a writer is <b>another</b> <b>thing....</b> <b>I</b> don't wish to speak about war." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't say that, Frank. This is an {{important}} business, and let us go through it steadily. I would certainly like to have him again at my feet. Whether I would deign to lift him up again is <b>another</b> <b>thing.</b> <b>Is</b> not that natural, after {{what he has done}} to me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘There’s <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> yet,’ said Francie, {{stopping}} his father. ‘There’s <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> that <b>I</b> am {{not sure}} that I am very caring for. She—she sends me errands.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There's <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> yet," [...] said Francie, {{stopping}} his father. [...] "There's <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> that <b>I</b> am {{not sure}} that I am very caring for. She--she sends me errands." ...|$|R
6000|$|His {{companion}} faltered but an instant. [...] "Ah that's <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> know. But it's also exactly why. Why I want Nanda away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And there's <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> {{must tell}} you, too, Mr. Trewillian. I {{come back to}} town in the same {{carriage}} with the Colonel. I thought it better." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{generally}} believed Porteous was {{tampering with}} the mails, {{and that brings}} up <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> want to mention. I'm puzzled about {{it as well as}} pleased." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And there's <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> afore <b>I</b> go," [...] ses Silas. [...] "I've left a widder, {{and if she}} don't get 'elp {{from some}} one she'll starve." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just what I think," [...] {{returned}} his brother. [...] "And <b>another</b> <b>thing,</b> Dick; <b>I</b> think that {{man with the}} pointed chin is in with the brokers, too." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] I told him, [...] "I {{will send}} my man at once. There is just <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> which <b>I</b> {{should like to}} ask you. Have you any {{objection}} to seeing my doctor?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I thank ye for ut, and 'tis done like gentlemen," [...] said Mac. [...] "But there's <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> have upon my mind. I hope we're all Prodestans here?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know, and if {{you wish}} I will tell you; but there is <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> must say first. Come a little way down the lane with me, Mr. Brattle." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you!" [...] she said. [...] "There is <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> want to ask, Mr. Jordan. If you get {{any news}} of the Shasta, will you come and tell me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I did {{not stop}} the horse. I tried, but that's <b>another</b> <b>thing.</b> If <b>I</b> had not meddled, I expect Miss Jardine would have conquered the nervous brute and I would not have got a nasty kick." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, not entirely, sir," [...] {{answered}} Peters, unabashed; [...] "there's <b>another</b> little <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> {{wished to}} speak to you about, and that's this"--saying which, he laid the Bishop's bag before the Canon and told his story.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Possibly,' said Helen languidly; 'but {{then there}} is <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> which <b>I</b> dislike--I cannot bear to hear the most {{beautiful}} chapters in the Bible stammered over as if the children had not the least perception of their meaning.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of such oaths I think little," [...] {{answered}} Quilla. [...] "Yet of <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> think much. Tell me, my father, if the Inca declares war {{and attacks}} us, can we withstand his armies?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Swanhild laughed. [...] "A day shall dawn, Eric, when thou who dost hate me shalt hold me dear, {{and this}} I promise thee. <b>Another</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> promise thee also: that Gudruda shall never call thee husband." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "As to life, that's <b>another</b> <b>thing.</b> And <b>I</b> don't {{know that}} one ought to blame you very much--though it seemed rather an {{excessive}} step. I wonder now if it isn't the ugliness rather than {{the pain of the}} struggle which..." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Take me away now," [...] said Isabel, {{when her}} eyes had feasted upon all this, [...] "and don't let me see <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> till <b>I</b> get to Niagara. Nothing less sublime is worthy the eyes that have beheld such beauty." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, and I hear no thunder. There is <b>another</b> <b>thing,</b> Gavin. <b>I</b> am one {{of those}} that like to sit at home, {{but if you had}} a wife she would visit the congregation. A truly {{religious}} wife would be a great help to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Be careful," [...] {{said the}} farmer. [...] "If you're on a {{prospecting}} trip, keep your secret close. There's <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> might mention." [...] He turned to Blake. [...] "If you're {{a friend of}} Benson's, take him along with you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you," [...] said Jefferson. [...] "Well, I allow we {{want you}} to stop. There's <b>another</b> <b>thing.</b> <b>I</b> {{understand}} my partner kind of promised a boat would go. Sometimes he's rash, but I feel I've got to see him out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, at anyrate," [...] Harry said, [...] "Jeanne has no {{time for}} any thought of marrying just at present. But there is <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> {{want to tell you}} about. I have first a {{confession}} to make. I have deceived you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{provided}} against that," [...] said he. [...] "I have laid a floor over {{the hole with}} only a small opening in it, {{so there is no}} danger. And <b>another</b> curious <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> must tell you-our line is not wet: we have struck no water!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{think you}} owe them very much," [...] said Austin. [...] "In fact, I'm {{not sure that}} if I'd been you I'd have saved that coal for them; but we'll get on. I want to congratulate you on <b>another</b> <b>thing,</b> and <b>I</b> really think you are a lucky man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{am saying}} now in <b>another</b> way the <b>things</b> <b>I</b> wrote. I hope, Miss Dutcher, you will burn that packet without reading. I would not write {{it at all}} now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I hope not, Mr. Slope. But I have {{considered}} it {{my duty to}} give you this caution. And now there is <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> feel myself called on to speak about: it is your conduct to the bishop, Mr. Slope." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, if {{it would}} clear your head, that's quite <b>another</b> <b>thing!</b> <b>I</b> must clear your head, of course, at any sacrifice. Only one, mind," [...] she whispered, coquettishly; [...] "and pray be careful of Blackstone, or you'll lose the place." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Forgiveness is <b>another</b> <b>thing.</b> <b>I</b> {{leave that}} to your sanctimonious beggars. But, hunt a woman! Hang it, sir, I'm not a cad!" [...] and {{bringing}} his hand down with a rattle, he added: [...] "This is a subject that don't bear talking of." ...|$|E
60|$|I am {{not what}} I am {{supposed}} to be. <b>I</b> am quite <b>another</b> <b>thing.</b> Perhaps before <b>I</b> go further, I had better glance at what I AM supposed to be.|$|R
60|$|Here is <b>another</b> little <b>thing</b> that <b>I</b> {{have worked}} out, which is {{superior}} to parlour games in that it combines their intense excitement with sound out-of-door exercise.|$|R
6000|$|But O'Moy went headlong on. [...] "And <b>another</b> <b>thing.</b> Where will <b>I</b> {{be finding}} {{a friend to}} meet your friends? Who will dare to act for me in view of that enactment?" ...|$|R
