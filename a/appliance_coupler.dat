50|$|In European {{countries}} the C15/C16 coupler has replaced and made obsolete the formerly common types of national <b>appliance</b> <b>coupler</b> in many applications.|$|E
50|$|Instead, a {{country-specific}} {{power supply}} cord can {{be included in}} the product packaging, so that model variations are minimized and factory testing is simplified. A cord which is fitted with non-rewireable (usually moulded) connectors at both ends is termed a cord set. Appliance manufacturing may be simplified by mounting an <b>appliance</b> <b>coupler</b> directly on the printed circuit board. Assembly and handling of an appliance is easier if the power cord can be removed without much effort.|$|E
50|$|A {{power cord}} or <b>appliance</b> <b>coupler</b> {{may have a}} {{retaining}} clamp, a mechanical device that prevents it from inadvertently being pulled or shaken loose. Typical application areas with stricter safety requirements include medical technology, stage and lighting technology, and computing equipment. For specialty equipment such as construction machinery, sound and lighting equipment, emergency medical defibrillators and electrical power tools, used in locations without a convenient power source, extension cords are used to carry the electric current up to hundreds of feet away from an outlet.|$|E
25|$|IEC 60320 <b>appliance</b> <b>couplers,</b> the {{connections}} {{at the other}} end of power cords.|$|R
50|$|<b>Appliance</b> <b>couplers</b> {{enable the}} use of {{standard}} inlets and country-specific cord sets which allow manufacturers to produce the same appliance for many markets, where only the cord set has to be changed for a particular market. Interconnection couplers allow a power supply from {{a piece of equipment}} or an appliance to be made available to other equipment or <b>appliances.</b> <b>Couplers</b> described under these standards have standardized current and temperature ratings.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the connections within the standards, as mentioned, there are possible combinations between <b>appliance</b> <b>couplers</b> and IEC interconnection couplers. Fitted with a flexible cord, the components become interconnection cords {{to be used for}} connecting appliances or for extending other interconnection cords or power supply cords.|$|R
50|$|A {{cord set}} {{includes}} connectors molded to the cord {{at each end}} (see <b>Appliance</b> <b>coupler).</b> Cord sets are detachable from both the power supply and the electrical equipment, and consist of a flexible cord with electrical connectors at either end, one male, and one female. One end of the cord set {{is attached to a}} molded electrical plug; the other is typically a molded electrical receptacle to prevent the possibility of having an exposed live prong or pin which would cause electric shock. The female connector attaches to the piece of equipment or appliance while the male plug connects to the electrical receptacle or outlet.|$|E
5000|$|IEC 60320-3: Standard {{sheets and}} gauges. [...] This part {{includes}} the standard sheets for both <b>appliance</b> <b>couplers</b> and interconnection <b>couplers.</b> For <b>appliance</b> <b>couplers</b> the various coupler outlines are designated {{using a combination}} of letters and numbers, e.g., [...] "C14". The female part connector supplies power to the male appliance inlet. The male part is designated by the even number one greater than the number assigned to the female part, so a C1 connector mates with a C2 inlet, and a C15A mates with a C16A. Interconnection couplers have single letter designators, e.g., [...] "F". They consist of two parts: a plug connector, which is the part integral with, or intended to be attached to, the cord, and an appliance outlet, which is the part integrated or incorporated in the appliance or equipment or intended to be fixed to it, and from which the supply is obtained.|$|R
50|$|IEC 60320 <b>Appliance</b> <b>couplers</b> for {{household}} and similar general purposes {{is a set}} of standards from the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) specifying non-locking <b>appliance</b> and interconnection <b>couplers</b> for connecting power supply cords to electrical appliances of voltage not exceeding 250 V (a.c.) and rated current not exceeding 16 A. Different types of connector (distinguished by shape and size) are specified for different combinations of current, temperature and earthing requirements. Unlike IEC 60309 connectors, they are not coded for voltage; users must ensure that the voltage rating of the equipment is compatible with the mains supply.|$|R
50|$|The {{standards}} {{define the}} mechanical, electrical and thermal requirements and safety goals of power couplers. The standard scope {{is limited to}} <b>appliance</b> <b>couplers</b> with a rated voltage not exceeding 250 V (a.c.) at 50 Hz or 60 Hz, and a rated current not exceeding 16 A. Further sub-parts of IEC 60320 focus on special topics such as protection ratings and appliance specific requirements.|$|R
50|$|Interconnection {{couplers}} {{are similar}} to <b>appliance</b> <b>couplers,</b> but the female part is a power outlet that is built into a piece of equipment, while the male part {{is attached to a}} cord. They are identified by letters, not numbers, with one letter identifying the cord plug, and the alphabetical next letter identifying the mating appliance outlet. For example, an E plug fits into an F outlet.|$|R
50|$|Detachable <b>appliance</b> <b>couplers</b> {{are used}} in office equipment, {{measuring}} instruments, IT environments, and medical devices, among many types of equipment for worldwide distribution. Each appliance's power system must be adapted to the different plugs used in different regions. An appliance with a permanently-attached plug for use in one country cannot be readily sold in another which uses an incompatible wall socket; this requires keeping track of variations throughout the product's life cycle from assembly and testing to shipping and repairs.|$|R
5000|$|Each type of coupler is {{identified}} by a standard sheet number. For <b>appliance</b> <b>couplers</b> {{this consists of}} the letter [...] "C" [...] followed by a number, where the standard sheet for the male appliance inlet is 1 higher than the sheet for the corresponding female cable connector. Many types of coupler also have common names. The most common ones are IEC connector for the common C13 and C14, the figure-8 connector for C7 and C8, and cloverleaf connector or Mickey Mouse connector for the C5/C6. Kettle plug is a colloquial term used for the high-temperature C16 appliance inlet (and sometimes, wrongly, for the mating C15 female connector). [...] "Kettle plug" [...] is sometimes mistakenly {{used to refer to}} regular temperature-rated C13 and C14 connectors, which should not be used with heating appliances.|$|R
