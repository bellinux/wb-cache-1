25|$|Besides those {{dedicated}} to missions, Congregationalists created voluntary societies for encouraging education, Bible reading and moral reform.

25|$|In the 1960s, Rousas John Rushdoony {{began to}} {{advocate}} homeschooling, which {{he saw as}} a way to combat the secular nature of the public school system in the United States. He vigorously attacked progressive school reformers such as Horace Mann and John Dewey, and argued for the dismantling of the state's influence in education in three works: Intellectual Schizophrenia, The Messianic Character of <b>American</b> <b>Education,</b> and The Philosophy of the Christian Curriculum. Rushdoony was frequently called as an expert witness by the Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA) in court cases. He frequently advocated the use of private schools.|$|E
25|$|Harel's {{research}} at the Harvard Graduate School of Education and the MIT Media Lab in the 1980s led to the 1991 publication of Children Designers, which won the 1991 Outstanding Book Award from the <b>American</b> <b>Education</b> Research Association, with an introduction by Harel's research collaborator, constructivist researcher Seymour Papert. Children Designers {{presents the results of}} Harel's research in which she introduced disadvantaged fourth-grade children from the Boston area to the Logo programming language, and facilitated their creation of mathematical software applications that would help third-grade peers learn fractions. Children Designers suggested implementations within schools that emphasize this project-based and student-centered approach.|$|E
25|$|Delany {{worked for}} a brief period as {{principal}} of a colored school before going into practice as a physician. During another cholera outbreak in 1854, most doctors abandoned the city, as did many residents who could leave, as no one knew how the disease was caused nor how to control the epidemic. With a small group of nurses, Delany remained and cared for the victims. Delany is rarely acknowledged in the historiography of African <b>American</b> <b>education</b> (Anderson, 1988; Bullock, 1967; Butchart, 1980). He is not counted among African American educators, perhaps because he neither featured prominently in the establishment of schools nor philosophized at length on Black education.|$|E

25|$|His work led Congress to {{commission}} {{a study in}} 1926–1927 of the overall condition of Native Americans in the United States. The results were called the Meriam Report. Published in 1928 as The Problem of Indian Administration, the Meriam Report revealed the failures of federal Indian policies and how they had contributed to severe problems with Native <b>American</b> <b>education,</b> health, and poverty. Collier's efforts, including {{the publication of the}} report, raised the visibility of Native American issues within the federal government. The Great Depression brought a harsher economic environment for most Native Americans. The administration of President Herbert Hoover reorganized the BIA and provided it with major funding increases.|$|E
25|$|Lowell {{immediately}} embarked upon {{a series}} of reforms that were both academic and social in nature. Under his predecessor, Charles W. Eliot, Harvard had replaced the single standardized undergraduate course with a system that allowed students free choice of electives. That was a logical extension of the trend in U.S. education that had modeled the university on the German system, including the German principle of student freedom in choosing courses. So dominant was Harvard's role in <b>American</b> <b>education</b> that all large American colleges and universities had adopted the elective system by 1904. It appealed to all student types, those intellectually curious and energetic {{as well as the}} lazy without intellectual ambition.|$|E
25|$|The church's {{policy toward}} Native Americans also {{came under fire}} during the 1970s. In {{particular}} the Indian Placement Program was criticized as neocolonial. In 1977, the U.S. government commissioned a study to investigate accusations that the church was using its influence to push children into joining the program. However, the commission rejected these accusations {{and found that the}} program was beneficial in many cases, and provided well-balanced <b>American</b> <b>education</b> for thousands, allowing the children to return to their cultures and customs. One issue was that the time away from family caused the assimilation of Native American students into American culture, rather than allowing the children to learn within, and preserve, their own culture. By the late 1980s, the program had been in decline, and in 1996, it was discontinued.|$|E
