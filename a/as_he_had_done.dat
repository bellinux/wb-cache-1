5|$|His ruse revealed, Redheffer {{immediately}} {{departed for}} New York City {{where he was}} still unknown. He changed his machine somewhat {{so that it could}} not be detected as easily, and he exhibited it <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> in Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|Frank Stilwell {{had just}} arrived in Bisbee with his livery stable partner, Pete Spence, when the two were arrested by Deputy U.S. Marshal Virgil Earp for the holdup. Both were friends of Ike Clanton and the McLaurys. At the {{preliminary}} hearing, Stilwell and Spence were able to provide several witnesses who supported their alibis. Judge Spicer dropped the charges for insufficient evidence just <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> for Doc Holliday earlier in the year.|$|E
5|$|Van Dyke {{intended}} {{the picture to}} depict the corrupting influence white culture had on the Eskimos, much <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> in White Shadows in the South Seas. The script originally ended with Mala and Iva escaping onto the ice, only to drown. But producer Hunt Stromberg felt this ending was too downbeat, and changed it in April 1932 to the ending now seen on film.|$|E

5|$|Veloso {{designed}} the album's cover himself, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> before for three other albums. He {{went through a}} long design {{process in which the}} cover's colors, fonts, and text positioning were changed frequently. Veloso chose the color purple for the cover's background because it is mentioned multiple times in the album itself.|$|E
5|$|Đính was put {{in charge}} of the fake coup and was allowed the {{additional}} control of the 7th Division based in Mỹ Tho, which was previously assigned to Diệm loyalist Cao, who commanded the IV Corps in the Mekong Delta. The reassignment of the 7th Division gave Đính and his III Corps complete encirclement of Saigon, and would prevent Cao from storming the capital to save Diệm <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> during the coup attempt in 1960.|$|E
5|$|Another major {{component}} of Bo's Chongqing model concerned the city's economic policies. Just <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> in Liaoning, Bo ambitiously pursued foreign investment in the city, lowering corporate income tax rates (15% compared to the 25% national average), and sought to stimulate rapid urbanization and industrialization. He also carried on with policies initiated by his predecessors which focused on domestic consumption, rather than export-led growth. During his tenure, Chongqing reported annual GDP growth far exceeding the national average. In 2008, for instance, nationwide GDP growth was reported at 8%, while Chongqing reported 14.3%; the same year, foreign trade rose by 28%, and bank loans were up 29%.|$|E

5|$|<b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> {{for other}} Adventures of Tintin which {{featured}} sea travel, Hergé {{was careful to}} obtain as much data about ships as possible {{in order to make}} his portrayals more realistic. The design of the Aurora was based on the RRS William Scoresby, while that of the Peary was most likely based upon another Antarctic ship, the RRS Discovery. The seaplane on which the expedition travels was based on the German Arado 196-A. Hergé nevertheless later criticised his own efforts in this area, saying that if Aurora had been a real ship, it would probably be unseaworthy.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{composed}} Meine Seel erhebt den Herren for the Feast of the Visitation (2July), which commemorates Mary's {{visit to}} Elizabeth as narrated in the Gospel of Luke, 1st chapter, verses 39 to 56. In that narrative {{the words of}} the Magnificat, , are spoken by Mary. Traditionally, Luther's translation of the biblical text is sung to a German variant of the tonus peregrinus or ninth psalm tone, concluding with a doxology, translated from the Gloria Patri, on the same tune. Bach based his BWV10 cantata on Luther's German Magnificat and its traditional setting, working text and melody into the composition <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> with Lutheran hymns in other chorale cantatas.|$|E
5|$|Bernard Lee died in January 1981, after filming {{had started}} on For Your Eyes Only, {{but before he}} could film his scenes as M, the head of MI6, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> in the {{previous}} eleven films of the series. Out of respect, no new actor was hired to assume the role and, instead, the script was re-written so that the character is said to be on leave, letting Chief of Staff Bill Tanner take over the role as acting head of MI6 and briefing Bond alongside the Minister of Defence.|$|E

5|$|Bobby tells {{a fellow}} student, Lisa Baiocchi, {{that she must}} stand up to her {{overbearing}} father just <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> with Phil. When Lisa returns home, a window explodes and a shadowy, arm-like appendage grabs her father by the throat after he demands she stop seeing Bobby. His lifeless body is discovered {{lying on the ground}} outside the house. Though Scully concludes that Mr. Baiocchi died as the result of being pushed out of the window, Mulder discovers evidence suggesting he was pulled out by an outside force. Later, the agents learn that Lisa is another one of Karin Matthews' patients.|$|E
5|$|Cochrane, by now a Vice Admiral, assumed his {{position}} as Commander-in-Chief of British forces on the North Atlantic station in April 1814 and ordered the recruitment of a body of Colonial Marines <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> six years earlier on Marie Galante. Rear Admiral George Cockburn, Cochrane's second-in-command on the Atlantic coast, implemented Cochrane's order recruiting the second Corps of Colonial Marines. It served {{as part of the}} British forces on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States during the War of 1812.|$|E
5|$|Finnegans Wake {{comprises}} seventeen chapters, {{divided into}} four Parts or Books. Part I contains eight chapters, Parts II and III each contain four, and Part IV consists of only one short chapter. The chapters appear without titles, and while Joyce never provided possible chapter titles <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> for Ulysses, he did title various sections published separately (see Publication history below). The standard critical practice is to indicate part number in Roman numerals, and chapter title in Arabic, so that III.2, for example, indicates the second chapter of the third part.|$|E

5|$|In January 1985, {{production}} of Ran was halted as Kurosawa's 64-year-old wife Yōko fell ill. She died on February 1. Kurosawa returned {{to finish his}} film and Ran premiered at the Tokyo Film Festival on 31 May, with a wide release the next day. The film was a moderate financial success in Japan, but a larger one abroad and, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> with Kagemusha, Kurosawa embarked {{on a trip to}} Europe and America, where he attended the film's premieres in September and October.|$|E
5|$|Kourkouas assailed Edessa {{every year}} from 942 onward and devastated its countryside, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> at Melitene. Finally, its emir agreed to a peace, {{swearing}} not to raise arms against Byzantium and {{to hand over the}} Mandylion in exchange for the return of 200 prisoners. The Mandylion was conveyed to Constantinople, where it arrived on August 15, 944, on the feast of the Dormition of the Theotokos. A triumphal entry was staged for the venerated relic, which was then deposited in the Theotokos of the Pharos church, the palatine chapel of the Great Palace. As for Kourkouas, he concluded his campaign by sacking Bithra (modern Birecik) and Germanikeia (modern Kahramanmaraş).|$|E
5|$|Pellerin was {{originally}} scheduled {{to fly in}} this mission, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> on the 17 June flight. Pellerin was unavailable for the flight on 24 June and Wolff {{was selected as the}} replacement aircrew member. Due to the short notice of his assignment to the mission, Wolff did not participate in the pre-flight briefing and boarded the aircraft after the engines were started. Thus, Wolff was not aware of the planned mission profile and did not have an opportunity to raise any objections before take-off.|$|E

5|$|The {{insurers}} {{applied to}} the Earl of Mansfield to have the previous verdict set aside and for the case to be tried again. A hearing {{was held at the}} Court of King's Bench in Westminster Hall from 21–22 May 1783, before Mansfield and two other King's Bench judges, Mr Justice Buller and Mr Justice Willes. The Solicitor General, John Lee, appeared on behalf of the Zong owners, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> previously in the Guildhall trial. Granville Sharp was also in attendance, together with a secretary he had hired to take a written record of the proceedings.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> in 1984 when Bill Parcells {{restored}} him to {{the starting}} quarterback's job, Phil Simms responded with a solid season in 1993. Playing in all 16 games, he completed almost 62% of his passes, threw for over 3,000yards, 15 touchdowns, and 9 interceptions. The season {{marked the first time}} in seven years that Simms started every game for the Giants. Simms, Hampton, offensive linemen Jumbo Elliot and center Bart Oates all made the Pro Bowl. In addition, Reeves was named Coach of the Year by the Associated Press. Following the season Lawrence Taylor retired and Phil Simms was released by the team, leading to his eventual retirement. Simms and Taylor had been the faces of the franchise since 1979 and 1981 respectively.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> {{with the}} prior two Adventures, Wallez {{organised}} {{a publicity stunt}} to mark the culmination of Tintin in America, in which an actor portraying Tintin arrived in Brussels. It proved the most popular yet. In 1932, the series was collected and published in a single volume by Les Éditions de Petit Vingtième, coinciding with their publication of the first collected volume of Quick and Flupke. A second edition was produced in France by Éditions Ogéo-Cœurs-Vaillants in 1934, while that same year Casterman published an edition, the first of The Adventures of Tintin that they released. In 1936, Casterman asked Hergé to add several new colour plates to a reprint of Tintin in America, which he agreed to. They also asked him to replace the cover with one depicting a car chase, but he refused.|$|E
