25|$|Operation Phou Phiang II {{had ended}} with the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) within {{striking}} distance of the Royalist guerrilla headquarters at Long Tieng on the Plain of Jars. With peace negotiations in progress, any ceasefire would fix the contending forces in place. <b>As</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> not worrisome enough to the Royal Lao Government, on 12 December, infiltrating PAVN troops again struck the vital guerrilla base at Long Tieng. U.S. Air Force AC-130 Spectre gunships, F-4 Phantom IIs, and A-7 Corsairs struck targets of opportunity in the Communist advance. The Royal Lao Air Force (RLAF) T-28 Trojans flew about twice as many missions as the American air forces, but with a smaller ordnance load. When the flying weather turned bad, air operations reverted to the Sentinel Lock radar bombing system by B-52 Stratofortresses and F-111 Aardvarks that had been pioneered in Operation Phou Phiang II.|$|E
500|$|Poptimism (also called popism) is {{a mode of}} {{discourse}} which holds that pop music deserves the same respect as rock music and is as authentic and as worthy of professional critique and interest. It positions itself {{as an antidote to}} rockism and developed following Carl Wilson's book about Céline Dion's album Let's Talk About Love and Sanneh's 2004 essay against rockism in The New York Times. In the article, Sanneh asks music listeners to [...] "stop pretending that serious rock songs will last forever, as if anything could, and that shiny pop songs are inherently disposable, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> necessarily a bad thing.

500|$|During the interregnum the szlachta {{prepared}} {{a set of}} rules and limitations for the future monarch to obey as a safeguard to ensure that the new king, {{who was going to be}} a foreigner, complied with the peculiarities of the Commonwealth's political system and respected the privileges of the nobility. As Henry of Valois was the first one to sign the rules, they became known as the Henrician Articles. The articles also specified the wolna elekcja (free election) as the only way for any monarch's successor to assume the office, thus precluding any possibility of hereditary monarchy in the future. The Henrician Articles summarized the accumulated rights of Polish nobility, including religious freedom guarantees, and introduced further restrictions on the elective king; <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> not enough, Henry also signed the so-called pacta conventa, through which he accepted additional specific obligations. Newly crowned Henry soon embarked on a course of action intended to free him from all the encumbrances imposed, but the outcome of this power struggle was never to be determined. One year after the election, in June 1574, upon learning of his brother's death, [...] Henry secretly left for France.|$|E

500|$|The {{first season}} of Dexter {{followed}} the same storyline of Jeff Lindsay's novel Darkly Dreaming Dexter, {{the first in the}} series of novels on which the television show is based, albeit with many additional elements and altered characters. When writing the second season, Daniel Cerone said that the writers [...] "didn't see the opportunity in the second book" [...] to continue on the path that they hoped to go down and chose to depart from Lindsay's second Dexter novel, Dearly Devoted Dexter. Instead, they chose [...] "to turn our biggest card up - [...] "What if Dexter's bodies were discovered?" [...] - and just chart that course throughout the season." [...] According to executive producer Clyde Phillips, they decided to resume the second season storyline five weeks after season one's finale [...] "so all of the emotional resonance of what each [...] went through [...] will continue <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> the actual passage of time, so they're still dented and rocked by what has happened." [...] Cerone added that [...] "The nice thing with Dexter is it's actually the lack of emotional resonance." [...] Speaking about Dexter's situation {{at the beginning of the}} second season, Hall said, [...] "I think his world is pretty rocked. He encountered , a person he never anticipated encountering, someone who sees him for who he is, accepts him as such, and he really has no choice but to do him in ... he's still reeling from that, and any footing he's able to establish for himself is pretty much immediately pulled out from under him." ...|$|E
