5|$|Dinwiddie sent Washington {{back to the}} Ohio Country to {{safeguard}} an Ohio Company's construction of a fort at present-day Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Before he reached the area, a French force drove out colonial traders and began construction of Fort Duquesne. A small detachment of French troops led by Joseph Coulon de Jumonville was discovered by Tanacharison and a few warriors east of present-day Uniontown, Pennsylvania. On May 28, 1754, Washington {{and some of his}} militia unit, aided by their Mingo allies, ambushed the French in {{what has come to be}} called the Battle of Jumonville Glen. Exactly what happened during and after the battle is a matter of contention, but several primary accounts agree that the battle lasted about 15 minutes, that Jumonville was killed, and that most of his party were either killed or taken prisoner. It is not completely clear whether Jumonville died at the hands of Tanacharison in cold blood, or was somehow shot by an onlooker with a musket <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> with Washington, or by another means. Following the battle, Washington was given the epithet Town Destroyer by Tanacharison.|$|E
5|$|Rancho Grande {{was located}} at a {{mountain}} pass in {{a branch of}} the Andes known as the Venezuelan Coastal Range, which was an important migration route for butterflies, and the station proved very lucrative in the study of insects. During his work at Rancho Grande, Beebe broke his leg in a fall from a ladder, and the forced immobility which resulted from having his leg in a cast presented him with a new opportunity for observing the area's wildlife. At his request, he and his chair were transported into the nearby jungle, and <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> motionless the wild animals around him soon began to go about their business without noticing his presence. His immobility also presented him with the opportunity to spend hours at a time observing a pair of bat falcons through binoculars, documenting the behavior of their two chicks and every prey item fed to them by their parents. His observations documented several behaviors which were new to science, including the first documented example of play in birds.|$|E
5|$|The {{island is}} ruled {{over by a}} king. His name is Epatiana. He is a large, ignorant-looking boy of about 18 summers, {{and is one of}} the worst rowdies on the island, and there is no power to touch him. The first time we met him he was just landing from an {{excursion}} trip to the island of Rimatara, near by. And you need not be told that I was surprised when told that he was the king of the island; for instead of being dressed in a garb of rich apparel of some kind, with a crown about his head, as I had expected, he had nothing whatever on to indicate his supreme power. His costume was composed of a red breech-clout, a red woolen shirt and upon his bare head an old dried up wreath of faded flowers, such as is worn by all rowdies. When we spoke to him about his island, he dropped his head, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> upon the sand, and blushingly answered us. We told him who we were and where we were from, saluted him and left him with very different ideas formed about the king of Rurutu, than we had before meeting him. This was the first monarch of the kind I ever saw, and the first time we were ever under the reign of a king. The island is under the French protection, still it regulates and governs its own affairs, and the French have nothing to say in that respect. The king has judges under him, who make the laws and enforce them while he is in his childhood days.|$|E

25|$|September: Graham Allen, 27. Allen was a 27-year-old father-of-one, {{originally}} from Motherwell, whom Nilsen encountered in Shaftesbury Avenue as Allen attempted to hail a taxi in September 1982. Allen was strangled with a ligature <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> eating an omelette Nilsen had cooked for him. His body was identified from dental records and healed fractures to his jawbone. Dissected portions {{of flesh and}} small bones {{from the body of}} Allen subsequently blocked the drains at Cranley Gardens.|$|E
25|$|Hoy {{arrived in}} Athens {{in the form}} of his life. His main event was the Kilo Time Trial. He was ranked No 1 and was last man off. The sea level World Record was broken four times <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> in the track centre waiting for his start. He had been {{involved}} in an accident in the athlete's village just a few days prior to competition where he came off his bike in front of a village bus, narrowly avoiding serious injury. As {{he came out of the}} starting gate, his scarred arms and legs showed how close he was to not competing.|$|E

60|$|With {{his back}} against the box which served <b>as</b> cupboard, <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> {{watching}} the little maid with a strong determination not to indulge in sleep, and even <b>as</b> <b>he</b> repeated for the twentieth time that it was necessary he remain awake, his eyes closed in slumber.|$|R
25|$|On 12 April 2006, Rajkumar {{returned}} to his Sadashivanagar residence after his regular 20-minute walk and had a general medical check-up by 11:30a.m. (IST). At 1:50 pm (IST), <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> on a sofa, he asked {{a member of his}} family to slow the fan down and immediately collapsed. His personal physician Ramana Rao was called for, who rushed within three minutes, and performed external cardiac massage and mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Rajkumar was then taken to MS Ramaiah Memorial Hospital and was administered intracardiac injections. Efforts to revive him failed and was pronounced dead at 2:05 pm (IST).|$|E
25|$|Lindros {{never again}} wore a Flyers uniform, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> out the season {{awaiting}} a trade. Craig Ramsay retained the head coaching position as Neilson was {{not asked to}} return, which became {{a matter of some}} controversy. Ramsay lasted only until December when he was replaced by former Flyer great Bill Barber. Brian Boucher, who as a rookie backstopped the Flyers' playoff run the previous season, could not duplicate his performance in 2000–01 and lost the starting goaltending job to Roman Cechmanek, a former star in the Czech Republic. The performance of Cechmanek, worthy of a Vezina nomination, helped the Flyers stay afloat, but they lost in the first round to Buffalo in six games.|$|E
25|$|In {{his great}} career Walter Payton rushed for an all-time career record 16,726 yards. The Bears earned a Divisional Playoff rematch with Redskins at Soldier Field. The Bears jumped {{out to a}} 14–0 lead early on only to see the Redskins storm {{back and take a}} 21–17 lead late in the game. As time was winding down on the season and Payton's career, the Bears need to score a {{touchdown}} late. The ball was in the hands of Payton who tried to extend his career, but on fourth down he was shoved out of bounds one yard short of the first down marker allowing the Redskins to run the clock out. Payton watched the rest of the game <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> alone on the bench.|$|E

25|$|After an {{indifferent}} reception to his {{solo show}} in London, featuring mostly his nocturnes, Whistler abruptly decided {{he had had}} enough of London. He and Trixie moved to Paris in 1892 and resided at n° 110 Rue du Bac, Paris, with his studio at the top of 86 Rue Notre Dame des Champs in Montparnasse. He felt welcomed by Monet, Auguste Rodin, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, and by Stéphane Mallarmé, and he set himself up a large studio. He {{was at the top of}} his career when it was discovered that Trixie had cancer. They returned to London in February 1896, taking rooms at the Savoy Hotel while they sought medical treatment. He made drawings on lithographic transfer paper of the view of the River Thames, from the hotel window or balcony, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> with her. She died a few months later.|$|E
25|$|They {{ended up}} {{challenging}} The New Age Outlaws for the championships on the October 14, 1999 episode of SmackDown!. That night, the Rock 'N' Sock Connection won the tag team titles {{for the third}} and final time, meaning they would have to continue teaming together to defend the titles. Four days later on Raw is War, before their title defense against The Holly Cousins, Mick Foley gave the Rock an autographed copy of his book, , but later found it in the trash. Mick confronted The Rock and cursed him out for throwing away his life's work. Later that night, during their match, a crushed Mankind refused to participate <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> despondently on the steel steps, facing away from the ring, as Hardcore and Crash Holly (with outside interference once again by Triple H) beat The Rock for the tag team titles.|$|E
25|$|Three {{months after}} Nilsen's June 1982 {{promotion}} {{to the position}} of executive officer in his employment, he encountered a 27-year-old named Graham Allen attempting to hail a taxi in Shaftesbury Avenue. Allen accepted Nilsen's offer to accompany him to Cranley Gardens for a meal. As had been the case with several previous victims, Nilsen stated he could not recall the precise moment he had strangled Allen, but recalled approaching him <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> eating an omelette with the full intention of murdering him. Allen's body was retained in the bathtub for a total of three days before Nilsen began the task of dissecting his body upon the kitchen floor. Nilsen is again known to have informed his employers he was ill and unable to attend work on 9 October 1982 — likely in order that he could complete the dissection of Allen's body.|$|E
6000|$|... "Tell it, Mamma. It is {{time for}} our story, {{and that would be}} a nice one, I guess," [...] said Jack, who was as fond of stories <b>as</b> when <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> in his mother's lap and chuckled over the hero of the beanstalk.|$|R

25|$|Despite {{the rather}} interim {{nature of its}} engine and chassis configuration, on its World Championship debut at the 1964 Monaco Grand Prix the BRM P261 had the best of starts. Although Hill and team-mate Richie Ginther only managed to qualify in third and eighth places, respectively, in the race Hill set fastest lap, and the two P261s {{finished}} first and second. It {{was the first of}} Hill's five victories on the Côte d'Azure. Hill continued to perform well throughout {{the first half of the}} season, and took a string of three back-to-back second places in France, Britain and Germany. Ironically, it was with the introduction of the proper, high-exhaust version of the engine in Italy that the car's reliability began to falter. At Monza Hill qualified on the front row of the grid, but <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> waiting for the flag to drop his clutch seized open, and his car sat stationary as the rest of the field streamed past him. Hill bounced back to win in the United States, but finished out of the points at the season finale in Mexico following a collision with Bandini. With reasonable results from Ginther, BRM finished the season second in the Constructors' Championship, with Hill also second in the Drivers' Championship.|$|E
25|$|On June 25, 2009, Hansbrough was {{selected}} by the Indiana Pacers with the 13th overall pick in the 2009 NBA draft. After missing all of training camp, the preseason and the first four games {{of the regular season}} with an injury to his shin, he made his NBA debut against the Washington Wizards on November 6, 2009. He tallied 13 points against Washington, including 7-of-10 from the foul line. At the time, he was just the second Indiana player to have attempted 10 or more free throws in a game. After averaging 3.8 rebounds per game in his first 14 appearances, he led the Pacers with 11 rebounds against the Portland Trail Blazers on December 9. In that game, he gathered a season-high seven offensive rebounds, tying Roy Hibbert for second most by any Indiana player in 2009–10. On December 11, he scored a season-high 21 points against the New Jersey Nets. On December 27, he made and attempted 10 free throws against the Miami Heat, becoming the first player in Pacers' history to record a double-double (10 points, 10 rebounds) without making a field goal. His final game of the season came on January 16, 2010, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> out 49 of the season's final 53 games with an inner ear infection.|$|E
25|$|On April 11, 2013, the Knicks' 13-game {{winning streak}} {{ended with a}} loss to the Chicago Bulls, 118-111. Despite the loss, Anthony scored 36 points {{on top of a}} season-high 19 rebounds, and he set a {{franchise}} record with six straight games with at least 35 points. The following day, the Knicks bounced back with an easy 101-91 victory over the struggling Cleveland Cavaliers. Anthony again led the way with another double-double game of 31 points and 14 rebounds in just under 30 minutes <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> out the entire fourth quarter {{for the second time in}} 3 games. On April 15, 2013, Anthony won his 2nd straight Eastern Conference Player of the Week award for games played from April 8 to April 15, 2013, when he led the team to a 3-1 record. For the week, he averaged a conference-best 32.0 ppg and a seventh-best 11.5 rpg. He became the 2013 NBA scoring champion with 28.7 ppg after second place scorer and three-time reigning scoring champion Kevin Durant decided to sit out his last regular season game against the Milwaukee Bucks, ending his season with an average of 28.1 ppg. At the close of the regular season, Anthony was named as the Eastern Conference Player of the Month for April, with Stephen Curry earning the Western Conference award. Anthony broke LeBron James' stranglehold on the monthly award, after James had received such honors five times that season.|$|E

500|$|On May 5, 1961, Shepard piloted the Mercury-Redstone 3 {{mission and}} became the second person, and the first American, to travel into space.

[...] According to Gene Kranz in his book Failure Is Not an Option, [...] "When reporters asked Shepard {{what he thought about}} <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> atop the Redstone rocket, waiting for liftoff, he had replied, 'The fact that every part of this ship was built by the lowest bidder.'".|$|E
500|$|Duquesne {{found itself}} in {{overtime}} once again as they dropped another game against the St. Louis Billikens in double overtime, 75–79. Melquan Bolding suffered another setback <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> {{out most of the}} game, playing only five minutes due to strep throat. The team then went back out on the road to face the Rhode Island Rams, where they again lost with a final score of 67–75, dropping their conference record to 0–4. Bill Clark missed a game {{for the first time in}} his college career due to a suspension on suspicion of a [...] "secondary NCAA rules violation." [...] Melquan Bolding started the game for the first time since his injury, but only scored 6 points.|$|E
