50|$|The European Agreement on <b>Au</b> <b>Pair</b> <b>Placement</b> is an {{international}} agreement within the Council of Europe, originally signed in Strasbourg, France on 24 November 1969. It came into force on 30 May 1971, and regulates au pair placements. It states that the placed person shall neither {{be seen as a}} traditional employed domestic worker nor as a traditional student.|$|E
50|$|Arrangements differ between Europe, {{where the}} concept originated, and North America. In Europe, au pairs are only {{supposed}} to work part-time, and they often also study part-time, generally focusing on {{the language of the}} host country. In the United States, they may provide full-time childcare. In 1969, the European Agreement on <b>Au</b> <b>Pair</b> <b>Placement</b> was signed, and it came into force in 1971.|$|E

5000|$|Many {{different}} practices use {{the term}} [...] "placement" [...] as a denominator for their activities, and some form of definition is necessary to distinguish between these, and to mark it off from ordinary employment abroad {{as well as other}} forms of transnational mobility. Placements may be set up by an organiser who has made the necessary arrangements for a placement, defined the intended learning outcome, and thought out the pedagogic implications. Placements may also be self-organised by the participant. When a student organises a work stay in another country during holidays or a study break, this may or may not qualify as a placement according to the criterion of intent. If the purpose is to acquire vocational skills and/or improve language and intercultural skills in general, it should be seen as a placement, and count it as such, rather than a holiday job. It may be inscribed in an educational context through accreditation of prior experiential learning (APEL), if the organisation can be convinced that the person in question has sought out learning situations during the stay rather than just focused on having a good time or earning as much money as possible. Other activities in this borderline category are <b>au</b> <b>pair</b> <b>placements</b> and voluntary work in charitable institutions and organisations, e.g. as financed under the European Voluntary Service.The practice of some companies to send employees abroad in foreign subsidiaries {{for a period of time}} in order to acquire specific competences may also be considered under this label. It should be distinguished from employment abroad in general, which is another matter. The line is blurred, and different definitions may collide here. Any labour market activity where the participant draws some kind of wages or salary is juridically considered as employment. But payment is not necessarily a way of distinguishing between placements and proper jobs; placements may be paid or unpaid, even though the learning role of participants is often signified by the fact that they receive no - or a considerably reduced - payment.|$|R

50|$|Helene Lange {{came from}} a middle class family in Oldenburg. Her parents were the {{merchant}} Carl Theodor Lange and his wife Johanne (born tom Dieck). When she was six years old, her mother died from tuberculosis in 1855, and in 1864 her father died from a stroke, where for one year she came under the legal guardianship of a South-German clergy house. In 1866, when Lange's wish to pursue teacher training was narrowed by her legal guardian's, she took an <b>au</b> <b>pair</b> <b>placement</b> at a boarding school in Petit Château, Alsace, where she gave lessons in German literature and grammar and thus was {{able to participate in}} teaching courses.

40|$|The {{increasing}} demand for domestic work in affluent European countries is {{reflected by the}} influx of mostly young women au pairs from non-EU/EEA countries, particularly from the Philippines. Au pairs under the 1969 European Agreement on <b>Au</b> <b>Pair</b> <b>Placement</b> are not regular workers despite the domestic work they render. This controversy regarding the legal concept of au pairs created a status of precariousness, marginalization and high risk for labor exploitations to non-EU/EEA au pairs. This thesis argued and established the following: 1) The intersections on transnational migration, gender work and globalization as the main causes of work rights non-protection. 2) Non-EU/EEA au pairs at present are migrant domestic workers. 3) Application of a rights-based approach is an effective theoretical framework in formulating and reforming au pair policies in both sending and receiving states and by invoking the ICESCR s right to equal remuneration in claiming work rights for non-EU/EEA au pairs...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{looks at}} <b>au</b> <b>pairing</b> in {{contemporary}} Norway. Norway {{has gone from}} being a sending country to a receiving country of <b>au</b> <b>pairs</b> over the past 20 - 25 years. Public understanding of the scheme has changed accordingly, from an <b>au</b> <b>pair</b> to a host perspective. The notion of <b>au</b> <b>pairing</b> as ‘cultural exchange’ rather than work migration has persisted through this shift, {{and serves as a}} cultural and legal legitimisation for the current practice of hiring affordable live-in domestic workers in Norway. Consequently, the domestic work and carework <b>au</b> <b>pairs</b> do is not acknowledged as work, with the lack of rights that entails. The thesis critically investigates the domestic labour and affective boundary work <b>au</b> <b>pairing</b> entails, possibilities of migration and citizenship through <b>au</b> <b>pairing,</b> and the cultural representations and cultural conditions of <b>au</b> <b>pairing</b> in Norway. Through interviews with <b>au</b> <b>pairs</b> and participant observation in the homes where they work, as well as analysis of documentary films, the following questions are investigated: How do <b>au</b> <b>pairs</b> understand <b>au</b> <b>pairing?</b> How does the figure of the <b>au</b> <b>pair</b> get produced in Norwegian media representations? How is <b>au</b> <b>pairing</b> constituted simultaneously as work and non-work? What forms does agency take for <b>au</b> <b>pairs?</b> Which processes of marginalisation, inclusion and exclusion become active in producing <b>au</b> <b>pairing</b> and the figure of the <b>au</b> <b>pair?</b> The dissertation includes three academic articles and a synthesising chapter. The first article, ‘’It’s not much’. Affective (boundary) work in the <b>au</b> <b>pair</b> scheme’, argues that affective labour and boundary work are part of the domestic and carework <b>au</b> <b>pairs</b> do in their host families’ home. Drawing on interviews with current and former <b>au</b> <b>pairs,</b> the article investigates the statement ‘it’s not much’ as a way of affectively negating the extent or the drudgery of live-in domestic work. The second article, ‘From intimate relations to citizenship? <b>Au</b> <b>pairing</b> and the potential for (straight) citizenship in Norway’ looks at the possibilities for formal and informal citizenship through intimate relations in the <b>au</b> <b>pair</b> scheme. Through <b>au</b> pairs’ narratives of dating, the article argues that while citizenship can be performed culturally and relationally as well as gained formally, {{there is a sense of}} cruel optimism to the prospect of <b>au</b> <b>pairing</b> as a migration route where <b>au</b> <b>pairs</b> have individual agency, as migration is always governed from above. The third article, ‘Framing the <b>au</b> <b>pair.</b> Problems of sex, work and motherhood in Norwegian <b>au</b> <b>pair</b> documentaries’ analyses two television documentaries about <b>au</b> <b>pairs</b> in Norway. It argues that <b>au</b> <b>pairs</b> are naturalised as vulnerable, yet sexually available Filipina women, who are also poor enough to do the labour under the present conditions. In doing this, the films also carve out a space to argue that <b>au</b> <b>pairs</b> from the global south should be outlawed for their own good. Read together, the three articles shed light on the ways in which various power structures intersect. By performing undervalued labour, traditionally done, unpaid, by women, <b>au</b> <b>pairs</b> get produced as a particular kind of migrant worker. The articles show how <b>au</b> <b>pairs</b> get marginalised when gender, class, race, ethnicity, sexuality, visa status, age, and religion intersect in the activity of paid domestic labour...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the way that rules about use of rooms, guests and eating practices operated within <b>au</b> <b>pair</b> employing households in London, England, and how these worked to structure relations between <b>au</b> <b>pairs</b> and their employers. <b>Au</b> <b>pair</b> employment has been growing in Britain {{in recent years and}} the <b>au</b> <b>pair</b> scheme provides a particularly interesting situation in which to examine quasi-familial relations because it requires host families to treat <b>au</b> <b>pairs</b> ‘as a member of the family’. Using findings from a questionnaire survey of 144 <b>au</b> <b>pairs</b> and in-depth discussions with 50 <b>au</b> <b>pairs,</b> seven <b>au</b> <b>pair</b> employers and seven agencies that place <b>au</b> <b>pairs,</b> it is argued that house rules {{are an important part of}} the <b>au</b> <b>pair’s</b> relationship to her employer’s family. Employers could take a strict ‘positional’ parenting approach, a more negotiated ‘personalising’ approach, or a mixture of the two. Those employers who most literally treated <b>au</b> <b>pairs</b> like members of the family, i. e. like children, did not encourage close relations by doing so. It is suggested that whereas studies of other forms of paid domestic employment have found that employers encourage the development of false kin relations in order to place additional demands on domestic workers, in <b>au</b> <b>pair</b> employment, employers may seek to create distance from rather than intimacy with their <b>au</b> <b>pair</b> and so counter some of the demands of the <b>au</b> <b>pair</b> scheme...|$|R
