25|$|Citalopram has {{the second}} most {{selectivity}} for SERT, no effects on NE or DA re-uptake and nor does it have affinity to other neuroreceptors. Citalopram is composed of two enantiomers, (R)- and (S)-, which are mirror images of each other (figure 7). Researches has shown that nearly all the activity resides in the (S)-enantiomer and that (R)-citalopram actually counteracts {{the action of the}} (S)-enantiomer. The combination of the two enantiomers is known as racemic citalopram and has weak <b>antihistaminic</b> properties that reside in the (R)-enantiomer. Solution to improve the properties of racemic citalopram is to remove the unwanted (R)-enantiomer. The resulting drug is better known as escitalopram, but it is composed of only the pure active (S)-(+)-isomer. This change appears to remove the <b>antihistaminic</b> properties of the drug. By removing the (R)-enantiomer, the lowest dose of escitalopram becomes more efficacious and faster onset than comparable dose of citalopram, where escitalopram has twice the activity of citalopram and is at least 27 times more potent than the (R)-enantiomer. Escitalopram is therefore the only SSRI drug for which pure SERT inhibition is responsible for almost all of its pharmacological action. Escitalopram is the newest and most selective inhibitor of the SSRIs and is today considered the best tolerated SSRI.|$|E

Hence, this paper investigates the antimicrobial activities of 10 <b>antihistaminics</b> belonging to both old and new generations using multiresistant Gram-positive and Gram-negative clinical isolates. The bacteriostatic activity of <b>antihistaminics</b> was investigated by determining their MIC both by broth and agar dilution techniques against 29 bacterial strains. Azelastine, cyproheptadine, mequitazine and promethazine were the most active among the tested drugs. Diphenhydramine and cetirizine possessed weaker activity whereas doxylamine, fexofenadine and loratadine were inactive even at the highest tested concentration (1 mg/ml). The MIC of meclozine could not be determined as it precipitated with the used culture media. The MBC values of <b>antihistaminics</b> were almost identical to the corresponding MIC values.

40|$|Attention {{was drawn}} {{previously}} {{to the fact}} that several synthetic drugs pos-sessing antihistamine properties w-ere also capable of diminishing or blocking some excitatory effects of epinephrine (Loew 1947; 1950). The most striking example was the discovery that a-naphthylmethylethyl-fl-bromoethylamine HBr (SY- 28) is a potent adrenergic blocking drug of the 2 -haloalkylamine type and, in addition, this drug exerts a strong antihistamine action. Thus a single com-pound pharmacologically antagonizes effects of epinephrine and histamine, substances which are in themselves physiological antagonists in many respects. Nevertheless, the majority of <b>antihistaminics</b> are fairly specific with respect to histamine blockade, although many of them are known to increase the pressor responses to epinephrine in anesthetized dogs (Loew, 1950).

[...] In 1947, it synthesized promethazine, a phenothiazine derivative, which {{was found to have}} more pronounced sedative and <b>antihistaminic</b> effects than earlier drugs. A year later, the French surgeon Pierre Huguenard used promethazine together with pethidine as part of a cocktail to induce relaxation and indifference in surgical patients. Another surgeon, Henri Laborit, believed the compound stabilized the central nervous system by causing [...] "artificial hibernation", and described this state as [...] "sedation without narcosis". He suggested to Rhône-Poulenc that they develop a compound with better stabilizing properties. In December 1950, the chemist Paul Charpentier produced a series of compounds that included RP4560 or chlorpromazine. Simone Courvoisier conducted behavioural tests and found chlorpromazine produced indifference to aversive stimuli in rats. Chlorpromazine was distributed for testing to physicians between April and August 1951. Laborit trialled the medicine on at the Val-de-Grâce military hospital in Paris, using it as an anaesthetic booster in intravenous doses of 50 to 100mg on surgery patients and confirming it as the best drug to date in calming and reducing shock, with patients reporting improved well being afterwards. He also noted its hypothermic effect and suggested it may induce artificial hibernation. Laborit thought this would allow the body to better tolerate major surgery by reducing shock, a novel idea at the time.

2500|$|As a {{synthetic}} drug, synephrine {{first appeared in}} Europe in the late 1920s, {{under the name of}} Sympatol. One of the earliest papers describing its pharmacological and toxicological properties was written by Lasch, who obtained it from the Viennese company Syngala. By 1930, Sympatol was referred to as a Boehringer product, while one of the first US Patents describing its preparation and use was assigned to Frederick Stearns & Co. in 1933. Despite the date of this patent, clinical and pharmacological research on synephrine obtained from Frederick Stearns & Co was being carried out in the US by 1930. Writing in 1931, Hartung reported that in 1930 the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry of the American Medical Association had accepted synephrine for inclusion in its list of “New and Non-Official Remedies” as an agent for the treatment, by either oral or parenteral administration, [...] "of attacks of hay fever, asthma, coughing, spasms of asthma and pertussis (whooping cough)." [...] However, synephrine was dropped from the Council's list in 1934, and its apparent re-advertising as a new drug by the Stearns company ten years later elicited a scathing comment from the Editors of the Journal of the American Medical Association. The third edition (1965) of Drill's Pharmacology in Medicine stated, with reservations, that synephrine was [...] "advertised as an <b>antihistaminic</b> {{to be used in the}} treatment of the common cold...", under the trade name of [...] "Synephrin Tartrate", and indicated that the dose was 100mg, given intramuscularly, or subcutaneously. Published in 1966, the Textbook of Organic Medicinal and Pharmaceutical Chemistry described synephrine (in the form of its racemic tartrate) as a sympathomimetic agent that was [...] "less effective than epinephrine", and which had been used [...] for the treatment of chronic hypotension, collapse due to shock, and other conditions leading to hypotension. In a later (1972) textbook, synephrine was described as a drug, sold in Europe, that was administered in situations involving shock, such as surgical or bacteremic shock, and spinal anesthesia-related shock. The recommended dose was given here as 25–50mg, by intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous administration.|$|E

40|$|The author {{performed}} investigations on {{the relation}} between the 2 ̆ 7 concentration and the time needed to produce an action, namely the latent period, with acetylcholine, histamine,. barium and some other drugs. using the isolated ileum and uterus of the guinea pig and the mouse. The experiments were carried out in the belief that the analysis of time-concentration relation would contribute to the clarification of the mode of actions of these drugs and that the determination of the influence of the pretreatment with, or combined use of, adrenaline, atropine, magnesium and the <b>antihistaminics,</b> which were assumed to antagonize the actions of acetylcholine, histamine and barium, on the contraction of the isolated ileum and uterus would be helpful in measuring the antagonizing activities of these drugs. The results are summarized as follows: (1) When the inverse logarithms of time (x) was plotted against the logarithm of molar concentration (Y), the following relation held: Y=a×bX, where a and b were the constants specific to drugs. (2) Acetylcholine and adrenaline manifested the shortest latent period. While the latent period of histamine was a little longer, BaCl_ 2 and MgCl_ 2 showed the longest latent priods of all. (3) In the form of curve expressing time-concentration relation, the curves obtained with acetylcholine and adrenaline showed the sharpest slope. The slopes of curves obtained with vagostigmine, atropine and DAI were similar to those obtained with acetylcholine and adrenaline. The slope of curve obtained with histamine was less sharp, and the slopes of curves obtained with <b>antihistaminics</b> and quinine approximated to it. The slopes of curves obtained with BaCl_ 2 and MgCl_ 2 was the least sharp. (4) When the isolated ileum and uterus of the guinea pig were pre-treated with adrenaline, atropine or MgCl_ 2, the latent periods of the actions of acetylcholine, histamine or BaCl_ 2 were lengthened. Atropine, adrenaline and atropine were most effective on acetylcholine, atropine and barium, respectively, in lengthening the time needed to Produce effect. (5) Studies on the actions of the mixtures of acetylcholine, histamine or BaCl_ 2 with adrenaline, atropine and MgCl_ 2 on the isolated uterus of the mouse showed that the latent periods of the actions of acetylcholine, histamine and BaCl_ 2 were lengthened. Atropine was most effective in lengthening the latent period of acetylcholine, while adrenaline was most effective on both histamine and BaCl_ 2. (6) The pre-treatment of the isolated ileum and uterus of the guinea pig with various <b>antihistaminics</b> resulted in lengthening the latent periods of acetylcholine, histamine and BaCl_ 2.
