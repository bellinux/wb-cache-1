500|$|Isidore of Seville {{was born}} around 560 in Spain, under the {{unstable}} {{rule of the}} Visigoths {{after the collapse of}} the Roman empire. [...] His older brother, Leander, the abbot of a Seville monastery, supervised Isidore's education, probably in the school attached to his monastery. Leander was a powerful priest, a friend of Pope Gregory, and eventually he became bishop of Seville. Leander also made friends with the Visigothic king's sons, Hermenigild and Reccared. In 586, Reccared became king, and in 587 under Leander's religious direction he became a Catholic, controlling the choice of bishops. Reccared died in 601, not long after appointing Isidore as bishop of Seville. Isidore helped to unify the kingdom through Christianity and education, eradicating the Arian heresy which had been widespread, and led National Councils at Toledo and Seville. Isidore had a close friendship with king Sisebut, who came to the throne in 612, and with another Seville churchman, Braulio, who later became bishop of Saragossa. Isidore was widely read, mainly in Latin with a little Greek and Hebrew. He was familiar with the works of both the church fathers and pagan writers such as Martial, Tertullian and Pliny the Elder, this last the author of the major encyclopaedia then in existence, the Natural History. The classical encyclopedists had already introduced <b>alphabetic</b> <b>ordering</b> of topics, and a literary rather than observational approach to knowledge: Isidore followed those traditions. Isidore became well known in his lifetime as a scholar. He started to put together a collection of his knowledge, the Etymologies, in about 600, and continued to write until about 625.|$|E

This circumvents the <b>alphabetic</b> <b>ordering</b> limitations of a classic dictionary.

5000|$|In {{the first}} issue of Sino-Platonic papers (1986), he {{suggested}} the publication of a Chinese dictionary arranged in the same familiar way as English, French, or Korean dictionaries: [...] "single-sort alphabetical arrangement" [...] purely based on the alphabetic spelling of a word, regardless of its morphological structure. Most Chinese words are multisyllabic compounds, where each syllable or morpheme is written with a single Chinese character. Following a two-millennia tradition, Chinese dictionaries - even modern pinyin-based ones like the Xinhua Zidian - are regularly ordered in [...] "sorted-morpheme arrangement" [...] based on the first morpheme (character) in a word. For instance, a Chinese dictionary user who wanted to look up the word Bābāduōsī 巴巴多斯 [...] "" [...] could find it under ba [...] in traditional sorted- morpheme ordering (which is easier if one knows the character's appearance or radical but not its pronunciation) or under baba in single-sort <b>alphabetic</b> <b>ordering</b> (which is easier if one knows the pronunciation). The following example is adapted from DeFrancis (2000:10).|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} {{scholars}} have recently argued that ballot order effects give certain candidates {{an unfair advantage}} in elections and have urged states to randomize or rotate the order of candidate names to make elections more rational and fair. This article suggests that advocates of reform have been too quick to concede that static order-ing methods are nondiscriminatory. One common method of ballot ordering, arranging candidates in alphabet-ical order by their last names, disadvantages specific minority populations by pushing their candidates down the ballot. To substantiate this argument, I engineer two computer simulation experiments which show a sig-nificant link between ballot position and racial/ethnic status under <b>alphabetic</b> <b>ordering</b> laws. Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are particularly burdened by these laws. Because courts apply {{a higher level of}} scrutiny to election laws that infringe fundamental voting rights than laws that merely regulate elections, the discrimina-tory impact of <b>alphabetic</b> <b>ordering</b> rules significantly bolsters the case to rotate or randomize ballot order.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{what drives}} author ordering in scientific research. We first discussa theoretical {{framework for the}} choice between alphabetical ordering and relative-contribution-based ordering and develop hypotheses, focusing {{on the nature of}} research, in particular, the importance of collaboration in the context of incomplete contract, the measurement cost of contribution-based ordering and the role of a principal investigator (PI). Our empirical examinations, based on the new large scale original scientists' surveys in the US and Japan, show the supporting results. In particular, an alphabetical ordering {{is more likely to be}} used when the research is theoretical and has less empirical component and when the team size is large and not co-located. The variation of research method goes a long way in explaining the variation of the use of <b>alphabetic</b> <b>ordering</b> across fields (mathematics and economics vs. the others) as well as its variation within a field. We also find that PI or Co-PIs are more likely to exist when the project uses more resources as well as when the team is more heterogeneous. Finally, we confirm that author ordering sends two signals in contribution based ordering, the first author for the largest research contribution and the last author for the PI (or Co-PI) ...|$|E

40|$|Many fields face an {{increasing}} prevalence of multi-authorship, and this poses challenges in assessing citation metrics. Here, we explore multiple citation indicators that address total impact (number of citations, Hirsch H index [H]), co-authorship adjustment (Schreiber Hm index [Hm]), and author order (total citations to papers as single; single or first; or single, first, or last author). We demonstrate the correlation patterns between these indicators across 84, 116 scientists (those {{among the top}} 30, 000 for impact {{in a single year}} [2013] in {{at least one of these}} indicators) and separately across 12 scientific fields. Correlation patterns vary across these 12 fields. In physics, total citations are highly negatively correlated with indicators of co-authorship adjustment and of author order, while in other sciences the negative correlation is seen only for total citation impact and citations to papers as single author. We propose a composite score that sums standardized values of these six log-transformed indicators. Of the 1, 000 top-ranked scientists with the composite score, only 322 are in the top 1, 000 based on total citations. Many Nobel laureates and other extremely influential scientists rank among the top- 1, 000 with the composite indicator, but would rank much lower based on total citations. Conversely, many of the top 1, 000 authors on total citations have had no single/first/last-authored cited paper. More Nobel laureates of 2011 - 2015 are among the top authors when authors are ranked by the composite score than by total citations, H index, or Hm index; 40 / 47 of these laureates are among the top 30, 000 by at least one of the six indicators. We also explore the sensitivity of indicators to self-citation and <b>alphabetic</b> <b>ordering</b> of authors in papers across different scientific fields. Multiple indicators and their composite may give a more comprehensive picture of impact, although no citation indicator, single or composite, can be expected to select all the best scientists...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{study examined the}} design of a virtual keyboard {{that can be used for}} text entry with a rotary controller, particularly when users may differ in age and experience with a particular system. I specifically examined the shape and letter arrangement on the virtual keyboard to help determine the best features to use in a design. Two keyboard shapes, an Oval and a Plus, were selected to represent different aspects of the shape. Two keyboard arrangements, Alphabetic and a Standard QWERTY-based ordering, were selected to represent a well-known and less familiar arrangement. In the experiment, older and younger adults entered words over two consecutive days. Most of the time, they used either the Oval or the Plus, but they also used the alternate shape at specific points during their practice session to allow assessment of their ability to transfer what they had learned. At the end of the second day, they also used a variation of the practiced arrangement to examine how well they had learned the letter arrangement. Text entry performance on both shapes improved as a function of practice, demonstrating that participants could learn even unfamiliar devices and virtual keyboards to complete a word entry task. No overall shape effects were found for any level of performance, but shape did affect how participants learned and performed the word entry task. In particular, unique visual features on a shape may facilitate memorization of letter/visual cue mappings. These shape features are particularly important for older adults, as younger adults seem to develop a mental model that helps them memorize letter locations on either shape. With practice, older adults could achieve optimal performance levels with an Alphabetic keyboard on the Plus shape that has the more visually unique corners. In general, <b>alphabetic</b> <b>ordering</b> is best not only because it helped visual search, but also because it facilitated better movement planning. Overall, designers should consider creating unique visual features on a virtual keyboard that will blend with the compatibility and allowed movements for the selected device to create an effective virtual keyboard.
