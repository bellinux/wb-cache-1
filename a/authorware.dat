25|$|On December 12, 2005, Adobe {{acquired}} {{its main}} rival, Macromedia, {{in a stock}} swap valued at about $3.4 billion, adding ColdFusion, Contribute, Captivate, Acrobat Connect (formerly Macromedia Breeze), Director, Dreamweaver, Fireworks, Flash, FlashPaper, Flex, FreeHand, HomeSite, JRun, Presenter, and <b>Authorware</b> to Adobe's product line.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea for}} AIMIA {{came from a}} {{conversation}} between Richard and Michael Gale {{who at the time}} was the CEO of the <b>Authorware</b> distributorship in Australia. Michael's commercial network afforded the opportunity to invite interested parties to an initial meeting in Sydney. At this meeting Richard Heale brought a Perth lawyer, Martin Haas of Murie Edward, to draft an initial constitution and AIMIA was born.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{new revenue}} stream, Claris {{did little to}} market HyperCard. Development {{continued}} with minor upgrades, and the first failed {{attempt to create a}} third generation of HyperCard. During this period, HyperCard began losing market share. Without several important, basic features, HyperCard authors began moving to systems such as SuperCard and Macromedia <b>Authorware.</b> Nonetheless, HyperCard continued to be popular and used for a widening range of applications, from the game The Manhole, an earlier effort by the creators of Myst, to corporate information services, and many thousands in between.|$|E
50|$|Moving {{beyond the}} templates, however, {{requires}} either the importing of interactive Flash or Director movies, or scripting, {{which can be}} done in <b>Authorware's</b> native scripting language or in JavaScript.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Authorware's</b> {{distinctive}} style {{revolves around}} a central icon: the Interaction Icon. The {{structure of the}} authoring environment encourages rich interaction; complex user feed-back is not only possible but somewhat suggested by the software, rather than suggesting the usual media diffusion. This Interaction Icon allows various forms of user feedback (move object to, along a line, click an object or hot-spot; plus the usual text-entry, keypress, etc.) ...|$|R
25|$|In addition, many of {{the basic}} {{concepts}} of the original system were later re-used in other forms. Apple built their system-wide scripting engine AppleScript on a language similar to HyperTalk; it is often used for desktop publishing (DTP) workflow automation needs. In the 1990s FaceSpan provided a third-party graphical interface, and continues to do so today. AppleScript also has a native graphical programming front-end called Automator, released with Mac OS X Tiger in April 2005. One of HyperCard's strengths was its handling of multimedia, and many multimedia systems like Macromedia <b>Authorware</b> and Macromedia Director are based on concepts originating in HyperCard.|$|E
50|$|Adobe <b>Authorware</b> (previously Macromedia <b>Authorware)</b> was an interpreted, flowchart-based, {{graphical}} programming language. <b>Authorware</b> is {{used for}} creating interactive programs that can integrate a range of multimedia content, particularly electronic educational technology (also called e-learning) applications. The flowchart model differentiates <b>Authorware</b> from other authoring tools, such as Adobe Flash and Adobe Director, which rely on a visual stage, time-line and script structure.|$|E
50|$|Macromedia {{originated}} in the 1992 equal merger of <b>Authorware</b> Inc. (makers of <b>Authorware)</b> and MacroMind-Paracomp (makers of Macromind Director).|$|E
50|$|<b>Authorware</b> {{programs}} can be distributed as stand-alone executable files, or over the web which requires a proprietary <b>Authorware</b> Web Player.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Authorware</b> {{became a}} rapid {{success in the}} marketplace, obtaining more than 80% {{of the market in}} about three years. <b>Authorware</b> Inc. merged with MacroMind/Paracomp in 1992 to form Macromedia. In December 2005, Adobe and Macromedia merged, under the Adobe Systems name. The most recent version of <b>Authorware</b> is 7.02; version 7 was {{released}} in 2003. The <b>Authorware</b> player has some issues with Internet Explorer 7 and later under Windows Vista due to Protected mode as well as runtime errors due to a bug in Authorware's implementation of ReadURL (...) Javascript function.|$|E
50|$|<b>Authorware</b> {{programs}} {{start by}} creating a flowline, which is a flowchart showing {{the structure of the}} developer's program. The developer can add and manage text, graphics, animation, sound and video; develop interactivity and add navigational elements such as links, buttons, and menus. Macromedia Flash and Macromedia Director movies can also be integrated into an <b>Authorware</b> project. Xtras, or add-ins, {{can also be used to}} extend the functionality of <b>Authorware,</b> which is similar to HyperCard's XCMDs. Authorware's power can be even better utilized with the use of variables, functions and expressions. <b>Authorware</b> can interpret both its built-in proprietary scripting language and JavaScript version 1.5.|$|E
50|$|Over time, <b>Authorware</b> {{has lost}} its specificity. More power was gained as more {{scripting}} added graphical design, interaction and integration features, but Authorware's special interaction-centred, clean, simple design was lost along the way. However, {{there are still many}} Fortune 500 companies that use <b>Authorware</b> as their main platform.|$|E
50|$|<b>Authorware</b> {{started as}} a system aimed at {{addressing}} the problems in TUTOR. Originally titled Course of Action (CoA), it was a Macintosh-only program, but produced runtime programs for both the Mac and DOS. <b>Authorware</b> came later and produced DOS runtime versions until {{the release of the}} first Microsoft Windows version.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Authorware</b> Inc. {{is formed}} in Minneapolis/St. Paul. From initial prototypes {{developed}} on both mainframe and very early personal computers, a Macintosh-based authoring system called [...] "Course of Action" [...] is introduced; later a PC version is developed. Shortly after its introduction, {{the title of}} the authoring system is changed to match the name of the company. <b>Authorware</b> {{went on to become the}} first and most widely used industry-standard development tool.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} {{strength in}} education of <b>Authorware</b> could {{be linked to}} its roots in pedagogical models based on constructivist views.|$|E
5000|$|Allen {{received}} a BA in psychology from Cornell College, and MA and Ph.D. from the Ohio State University in educational psychology. From 1971 to 1984 Allen worked for Control Data Corporation on its PLATO computer-based education system [...] He rose to be director of advanced educational systems R&D.Allen founded <b>Authorware</b> in 1984, incorporating it in 1985. <b>Authorware</b> merged with MacroMind-Paracomp in 1992 to form Macromedia, which was later bought by Adobe Systems.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Authorware</b> was {{originally}} produced by <b>Authorware</b> Inc., founded in 1987 by Dr Michael Allen. Allen {{had contributed to}} the development of the PLATO computer-assisted instruction system during the 1970s that was developed jointly by the University of Illinois and Control Data Corporation. CDC, where Allen was Director of Advanced Instructional Systems R&D, invested heavily in the development of an expansive library of interactive [...] "courseware" [...] to run on the PLATO system.|$|E
50|$|Allen {{formed a}} spinoff of the {{professional}} services division of <b>Authorware</b> called MediaPros, which was acquired by Lifetouch, Inc. a year later.|$|E
50|$|In 1988 {{the company}} moved to San Francisco, and in 1991 MacroMind merged with Paracomp to become MacroMind-Paracomp, then in 1992 merged with <b>Authorware,</b> Inc forming Macromedia.|$|E
50|$|Macromedia was {{acquired}} by Adobe Systems in 2005, and the entire Macromedia product line including Flash, Dreamweaver, Director/Shockwave, Fireworks (discontinued) and <b>Authorware</b> is now handled by Adobe.|$|E
50|$|Michael W. Allen (born 1946) is an American {{software}} developer, educator, and author.He {{is known}} for his work on e-learning, and led the development of the <b>Authorware</b> software.|$|E
50|$|Prior to its {{acquisition}} by Adobe Systems, Macromedia had {{a product}} bundle known as eLearning Suite 2004, which included Flash MX 2004, Dreamweaver MX 2004, and <b>Authorware</b> 7.|$|E
50|$|<b>Authorware</b> is {{particularly}} {{well suited to}} creating electronic educational technology (also called e-learning) content, as it includes highly customizable templates for CBT and WBT, including student assessment tools. Working with these templates, businesses and schools can rapidly assemble multimedia training materials without needing to hire a full-fledged programmer. Intuitively-named dialog boxes take care of input and output. The flow chart model makes the re-use of lesson elements extremely straightforward. Being both AICC- and SCORM-compliant, <b>Authorware</b> {{can be used to}} deliver content via any AICC or SCORM Learning Management System.|$|E
50|$|The {{extension}} uses XBL and CSS {{to prevent}} elements of Silverlight, Macromedia <b>Authorware,</b> Adobe Director and Adobe Flash from being displayed. Flashblock {{does not prevent}} the elements from being downloaded.|$|E
5000|$|Firefox (Firefox 3.5.3 and Safari 4, {{or above}} {{will not allow}} the <b>Authorware</b> plug-in to be recognized. Users will need to install Firefox version 3.5.2 for {{plug-ins}} {{to work on a}} Mac) ...|$|E
50|$|Students need a computer, Internet access, and {{an email}} address to {{complete}} courses through MDLP. The coursework {{is composed of}} lessons, typed worksheets, and timed online tests that run on the Macromedia <b>Authorware</b> software.|$|E
5000|$|As {{an early}} expert in {{education}} technology, in 1989, Colligan was recruited {{to be the}} CEO of <b>Authorware,</b> a computer-based learning software provider. In 1992, he co-founded Macromedia, resulting from the merger of <b>Authorware</b> and MacroMind-Paracomp. He served as CEO of Macromedia from 1992 to 1997 and took the company public on NASDAQ in December, 1993. In 1996, Ernst and Young recognized Colligan as the “Software Entrepreneur of the Year.” He served as Chairman of the Board of Macromedia until July, 1998. During Colligan’s tenure, Macromedia’s annual revenues grew to more than $100 million. [...] In 2005, Adobe Systems acquired Macromedia for $3.4 billion.|$|E
50|$|Macromedia was {{acquired}} by Adobe Systems in 2005, and the entire Macromedia product line including Flash, Dreamweaver, Director/Shockwave and <b>Authorware</b> was now handled by Adobe. Director and Shockwave Player is currently developed and distributed by Adobe Systems.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Authorware</b> Inc. {{merges with}} MacroMind/ParaComp to create Macromedia. MacroMind {{specialized}} in animation software (Director) and ParaComp specialized in 3D imagery (Swivel 3D). Macromedia goes public only {{months after the}} merger and remains the leading purveyor of multimedia tools.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the major}} drivers for SoundEdit was Apple's HyperCard. With MacRecorder Sound System, stack makers could finally create {{alternatives}} to HyperCard's two built-in sounds. The other multimedia programs of the time, (Director and <b>Authorware)</b> also adopted it right away.|$|E
50|$|It was {{generally}} {{known in the}} <b>Authorware</b> development community that version 8.0 was in production prior to the merger between the two companies, with 4 beta versions released to external testing shortly before the merger was completed. Among several other features intended for the new version, the ability to publish to Flash's SWF (ShockWave Flash) {{was at the top}} of the list. Once production shifted to Adobe's off-shore development facility in Bangalore, India, the free-flow of information that had been enjoyed between Macromedia's engineering team and its beta testers was curtailed. On Friday, August 3, 2007, after several years of keeping the development community in limbo, Adobe finally announced its plans to discontinue development of <b>Authorware.</b>|$|E
50|$|Xtras are {{plug-ins}} for the Lingo scripting language, {{that enable}} additional functionality into a Shockwave project. Xtras are typically used to add file system I/O, hardware integration, and advanced multimedia functions. Xtras are supported and available for Adobe Director, Adobe <b>Authorware</b> and Adobe Freehand.|$|E
5000|$|May 1986: Artist Mike Saenz leaves {{after three}} issues. He creates ComicWorks for {{software}} company Macromind {{as the first}} personal digital publishing software system for comic creation. After combining with Paracomp in 1991, MacroMind-Paracomp merges with <b>Authorware,</b> Inc to form Macromedia in 1992, which was acquired in 2005 by Adobe Systems.|$|E
50|$|In {{an attempt}} to raise its brand profile, all Macromedia players prefixed Shockwave to their names in the late 1990s. Although this {{campaign}} was successful and helped establish Shockwave Flash as a multimedia plugin, Shockwave and Flash became more difficult to maintain as separate products. In 2005, Macromedia marketed three distinct browser player plugins under the brand names Macromedia <b>Authorware,</b> Macromedia Shockwave, and Macromedia Flash.|$|E
50|$|The {{idea for}} AIMIA {{came from a}} {{conversation}} between Richard and Michael Gale {{who at the time}} was the CEO of the <b>Authorware</b> distributorship in Australia. Michael's commercial network afforded the opportunity to invite interested parties to an initial meeting in Sydney. At this meeting Richard Heale brought a Perth lawyer, Martin Haas of Murie Edward, to draft an initial constitution and AIMIA was born.|$|E
50|$|Hypermedia may be {{developed}} {{in a number of}} ways. Any programming tool can be used to write programs that link data from internal variables and nodes for external data files. Multimedia development software such as Adobe Flash, Adobe Director, Macromedia <b>Authorware,</b> and MatchWare Mediator may be used to create stand-alone hypermedia applications, with emphasis on entertainment content. Some database software, such as Visual FoxPro and FileMaker Developer, may be used to develop stand-alone hypermedia applications, with emphasis on educational and business content management.|$|E
