5|$|Caragiale's legal {{representative}} was the fellow writer Barbu Ștefănescu Delavrancea, who systematically disproved Caion's allegations, {{and noted that}} the absentee defendant was guilty of numerous forgeries. He also convinced the judge that the similarities between Năpasta and The Power of Darkness were superficial. The court found Ionescu-Caion guilty of slander. He was sentenced to a three-month jail term, a 500 lei fine and 10,000 lei in court costs. However, he appealed the tribunal's decision. The jury selection was a laborious process: Caion's lawyer Danielopol recused writers Nicolae Iorga and Ovid Densusianu, alleging that all Romanian literati had <b>a</b> <b>vested</b> interest to defend plagiarism. Iorga took offense, and reportedly challenged Danielopol to a duel. During the proceedings, Caion backed up on the original accusations, explaining that he had only invented a reason to bring Caragiale in for a trial. The court eventually acquitted Caion.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1880s, Wallace was {{drawn into the}} debate over {{mandatory}} smallpox vaccination. Wallace originally saw the issue {{as a matter of}} personal liberty; but, after studying some of the statistics provided by anti-vaccination activists, he began to question the efficacy of vaccination. At the time, the germ theory of disease was very new and far from universally accepted. Moreover, no one knew enough about the human immune system to understand why vaccination worked. When Wallace did some research, he discovered instances where supporters of vaccination had used questionable, in a few cases completely phony, statistics to support their arguments. Always suspicious of authority, Wallace suspected that physicians had <b>a</b> <b>vested</b> interest in promoting vaccination, and became convinced that reductions in the incidence of smallpox that had been attributed to vaccination were, in fact, due to better hygiene and improvements in public sanitation.|$|E
25|$|Probation {{is an act}} {{of grace}} and the {{defendant}} does not gain <b>a</b> <b>vested</b> right in probationary status once a probationary sentence is imposed. It has been ruled that the probation power does not unconstitutionally encroach on the pardon power of the President.|$|E
50|$|The added moving {{capability}} {{provided by}} <b>a</b> plundered <b>vest</b> {{may be used}} one time only on any future move: i.e., the plundered vest may be used on its very next move or carried around and used later in the game. After <b>a</b> <b>vest</b> is used to move a chess piece on the board, it must {{be returned to the}} stand out of play. No more than one plundered vest is allowed on any one piece at a time. If a chess piece with <b>a</b> plundered <b>vest</b> makes another capture, it may upgrade to <b>a</b> stronger <b>vest.</b> If <b>a</b> player captures a piece with <b>a</b> <b>vest,</b> that player may take the vest it wears or <b>a</b> <b>vest</b> that represents the captured piece.|$|R

In the short run, investment spending directly supports aggregate demand and growth.

25|$|As The Lightning Kid, Waltman had his WWF tryout {{match in}} Phoenix, Arizona, {{the day after}} WrestleMania IX, against fellow hopeful Louie Spicolli (soon known as Rad Radford in the WWF). He reminisced that he was lucky to have an {{opponent}} with <b>a</b> <b>vested</b> interest in an impressive match, rather than (as was then typical) a disinterested WWF veteran jobber like Virgil or Jim Powers.|$|E
25|$|A {{statement}} from the British Cabinet Mission in India in 1946 confirmed that Jammu and Kashmir, a princely state {{at the time of}} partition, was a sovereign territory, and Article 7 of the Indian Independence Act of 1947 dealing with lapse of suzerainty of the British Crown over the Indian states reaffirmed this fact, so the Kashmiri people had <b>a</b> <b>vested</b> right of self-determination from the time of independence.|$|E

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 19th century, research on this family was thus more advanced than Indo-European research. But the rise of Indo-European comparative linguistics absorbed so much attention and enthusiasm that Uralic linguistics was all but eclipsed in Europe; in Hungary, the only European country that would have had <b>a</b> <b>vested</b> interest in the family (Finland and Estonia being under Russian rule), the political climate was too hostile for the development of Uralic comparative linguistics.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of Hammarskjöld's death, {{intelligence}} agencies of the U.S. and its allies were {{actively involved in the}} political situation in the Congo, which culminated in Belgian and United States support for the secession of Katanga and the assassination of former prime minister Patrice Lumumba. Belgium and the United Kingdom had <b>a</b> <b>vested</b> interest in maintaining their control over much of the country's copper industry during the Congolese transition from colonialism to independence. Concerns about the nationalisation of the copper industry could have provided a financial incentive to remove either Lumumba or Hammarskjöld.|$|E
25|$|Immediately {{after the}} election, in December 2005, the council voted to ban cardrooms. At that time, the 11th Frame {{filed a lawsuit}} against the city in federal court. In August 2006, the lawsuit was {{dismissed}} on the grounds that gambling was not <b>a</b> <b>vested</b> right. An appeal was filed in the Ninth Circuit Court. That case was decided May 28, 2008 with the judges affirming the city’s ban on card rooms. Under an agreement between Frank Evans, city attorneys, and the state gambling commission, the cardroom attached to Kenmore Lanes closed on June 30, 2009.|$|E

This is not <b>a</b> <b>vested</b> right but a benefit, contingent on good behavior, with prison authorities paying their university tuition. The courses are in the fields of: humanities, sociology, economics, management, psychology and political-science. The intention {{is to give the}} prisoners the tools to deal with life outside, so that upon release from prison they will have the appropriate education to help them obtain jobs, and prevent them from returning to a life of crime.|$|E
25|$|A {{public debate}} about {{the cause of the}} {{accident}} arose after the report, in part because of sightings of fighter jets. Such reports had been appearing in the media since shortly after the accident. Fremover reported in January 1987 that radar had observed an unidentified aircraft which was {{on a collision course with}} the Twin Otter. The issue escalated with the captain's brother, Widerøe's chief pilot John Hovring, stating that the crash must have occurred as a result of a collision with a fighter or missile. He further stated that General Mohr as an air force officer had <b>a</b> <b>vested</b> interest in covering up the real cause.|$|E
25|$|Andrew Lih and Andrew Brown both {{maintain}} editing Wikipedia with smart phones {{is difficult}} and this discourages new potential contributors. Several years running the number of Wikipedia editors has been falling and Tom Simonite of MIT Technology Review claims the bureaucratic structure and rules are a factor in this. Simonite alleges some Wikipedians use the labyrinthine rules and guidelines to dominate others and those editors have <b>a</b> <b>vested</b> interest in keeping the status quo. Lih alleges there is serious disagreement among existing contributors how to resolve this. Lih fears for Wikipedia's long term future while Brown fears problems with Wikipedia will remain and rival encyclopedias will not replace it.|$|E

40|$|Solar heat {{radiation}} can impose significant heat stress on employees performing outdoor tasks. A prototype infrared reflecting vest {{was developed to}} offer protection to agricultural workers and constructions workers who are exposed {{to high levels of}} outdoor solar radiation. The prototype vest was tested using a laboratory based thermal manikin exposed to controlled {{heat radiation}} intensity levels. The tests showed that <b>a</b> <b>vest</b> including 3. 2 cm spacers was able to reduce heat gain by 30 % without imposing a significant corresponding insulation heat gain. The thermal cross-over point for such <b>a</b> <b>vest</b> was lowest in comparison to others configurations tested.

Throughout the years, many prominent members have kept <b>a</b> <b>vested</b> interest in the events and operations of Phi Delta Theta. President Harrison, for example, participated in three Phi Delt banquets during his presidency while Medal of Honor recipient General Frederick Funston was the guest speaker at certain chapter installations.|$|E
25|$|Salleh was {{represented}} by Anthony Lester, QC, who objected to the tribunal's composition. It was argued Abdul Hamid had <b>a</b> <b>vested</b> interest in the case's outcome, since if Salleh was impeached, he would remain Lord President. It was also claimed that the tribunal was improperly constituted because two of the judges were relatively junior, and that the two foreign judges were from countries not noted for judicial independence. Salleh demanded to be tried by peers of equal standing – retired Lord presidents, if need be. He also demanded that the tribunal make its hearings public. All of these claims were rejected by the tribunal, and Salleh withdrew from the proceedings.|$|E
25|$|When Ronald Reagan {{was elected}} in 1982, he {{significantly}} reduced the size and cost of many portions of government, thereby greatly limiting the Civil Service Reform Act. Satisfying {{the need for new}} legislation, the Performance Management and Recognition System (PMRS) was enacted on November 8, 1984. Most notably, the PMRS provided a greater level of evaluation accuracy and imposed minimum and maximum levels of pay increase to limit disparity among merit pay employees. PMRS also created Performance Standard Review Boards for each department and required that {{at least half of the}} board be members who were under the merit pay system. This requirement ensured that at least some board members had <b>a</b> <b>vested</b> interest in dealing with potential problems and concerns.|$|E
