40|$|Sustainable {{development}} {{and quality of}} life are today very important paradigms in the world. Each of them has its own structure, hierarchy, methodology for management, monitoring and study. Because both of them had its own development courses there are many differences related with different purposes. Sustainable development is connected with regional and macro level. It covers many aspects of development strate gy directed to sustainable state. Quality of life has to a certain extent the same direction - an objective measure of achieved performances of life as GDP per capita, school system etc. The second part of Quality of life is expressed by many indicators about <b>achieved</b> <b>wishes,</b> values attitudes etc. Although there are many similarities between both paradigms, differences are on level of concept, structure, measurement, monitoring and analysis. Authors in the paper try to override the skeletons of both paradigms. The paper considers in this perspective three important stages in the building of QOL and SD indicators: the identification of the various dimensions underlying mentioned concepts, the process of aggregating lower dimension indicators in higher level composite indices and the attribution of weights at various levels of the indicators hierarchy...|$|R

His experiences there were to form the basis for his first and most successful novel, Simon Called Peter. Appointed an army chaplain on 26 May 1917, Keable travelled to the Rouen sector with a Native Labour Contingent of 21,000 men. These men were paid £3 per month to unload supply ships and provide infrastructure support for military operations in Europe. As a chaplain, with the rank of captain, Keable was expected to be at the disposal of the army at large, and ministered to those seeing active infantry service as well as to labourers. Padres were formally required to remain behind the lines, but it is apparent that Keable nonetheless saw something of the realities of the frontline.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to explore the {{potential}} of networking strategy {{as a source of}} competitive advantage by integrating market-based and resource-based logics. According to the former logic a firm identifies operations performance objectives as drivers for <b>achieving</b> its <b>wished</b> competitive position and advantage. According to the latter logic the firm achieves a competitive advantage through the obtainment and/or the creation of valuable, rare, imperfectly imitable, and not substitutable resources. Both operations performance objectives and strategic resource needs should, thus, directly affect networking strategy decisions. The question is whether they effectively do and how. In this paper a literature review and analysis approach with theory building purpose was chosen to explore such issues. Both networking decisions, operations objectives, and resource endowment needs constructs have been operationalised through elements of specificity and two major propositions have been formulated. The integration of these two different perspectives on networking strategy suggests several research questions to be further investigated by adopting empirical research...|$|R

Moreover, beliefs deeply embedded in the minds of economists about economics, about the virtues of capitalism and free market began to falter. Sooner or later the current crisis will end. The problem that arises and to which the economic science must answer is whether anything should be changed in the current world economic order and especially what exactly. It is quite vital to ask ourselves today in what kind of society we want to live and whether the current economic model, a model mainly based on monetarist ideas, is helping us to <b>achieve</b> those <b>wishes.</b> In addition to analyzing the root causes that led to the current economic crisis, this article aims to analyze whether the current economic model must change and to outline the features of a possible new model. economic crisis; economic model; globalization; economic theory; economic cycle. ...|$|R
