5|$|From the few Greeks of Mani and {{the rest}} of Greeks who live there to Ibrahim Pasha. We {{received}} your letter in which you try to frighten us saying that if we don't surrender, you'll kill the Maniots and plunder Mani. That's why we are waiting for you and your army. We, the inhabitants of Mani, sign <b>and</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> you.|$|E
5|$|The robot {{has several}} {{possible}} responses to any obstacles. These {{will depend on}} its environment (navigation corridor, tarmac area without many obstacles, cluttered indoor environment etc.) {{at the time of}} the encounter with an obstacle. It can stop <b>and</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> a gap in traffic, or avoid an obstacle by using a technique based on a spiral, or perform path planning trajectories.|$|E
5|$|Delayed gratification, or {{deferred}} gratification, is {{the ability}} to resist the temptation for an immediate reward <b>and</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> a later reward. Generally, delayed gratification is associated with resisting a smaller but more immediate reward in order to receive a larger or more enduring reward later. A growing body of literature has linked the ability to delay gratification to a host of other positive outcomes, including academic success, physical health, psychological health, and social competence.|$|E

5|$|Like all arthropods, chelicerates' {{bodies and}} {{appendages}} {{are covered with}} a tough cuticle made mainly of chitin and chemically hardened proteins. Since this cannot stretch, the animals must molt to grow. In other words, they grow new but still soft cuticles, then cast off the old one <b>and</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> the new one to harden. Until the new cuticle hardens the animals are defenseless and almost immobilized.|$|E
5|$|On Monday morning, {{the storm}} had moved {{northeast}} of London, Ontario, dragging lake effect blizzards in its wake. An additional 17inches (43cm) of snow were dumped on Cleveland, Ohio that day, filling the streets with snowdrifts 6feet (2m) high. Streetcar operators stayed with their stranded, powerless vehicles for two nights, eating whatever food was provided by local residents. Travelers were forced to take shelter <b>and</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> things to clear.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} {{positions}} to develop within the code {{was referred to as}} the kick through. The position was unique to the Sheffield game and developed {{because of the lack of}} an offside rule. The job of the man playing in the kick through position was to remain near to the opposition's goal <b>and</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> a through ball, a tactic today called cherry picking or goal hanging. By 1871 this position had become modern-day forwards. Cover goals developed in opposition of kick throughs. Despite their name their job was to man mark the kick through.|$|E

5|$|The {{essential}} {{feature of}} defence-in-depth, according to Luttwak, was an acceptance that the Roman frontier provinces themselves {{would become the}} main combat-zone in operations against barbarian threats, rather than the barbarian lands across the border. Under this strategy, border-forces (limitanei) would not attempt to repel a large incursion. Instead, they would retreat into fortified strongholds <b>and</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> mobile forces (comitatenses) to arrive and intercept the invaders. Border-forces would be substantially weaker than under forward defence, but their reduction in numbers (and quality) would be compensated by the establishment of much stronger fortifications to protect themselves.|$|E
5|$|The {{increase}} {{in the rate of}} the state sales tax from 6% to 7% took effect on July 15, 2006, and also increased the sales tax rate in the state's Urban Enterprise Zones (UEZs) from 3% to 3.5%. A significant change was made in the payment of sales taxes by businesses operating in the UEZs in that they would be required to pay the entire amount of the full tax rate to the state on all appropriate purchases, <b>and</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> the state to rebate them the difference.|$|E
5|$|The killings {{exacerbated}} {{tensions between}} the Partisans and Chetniks. They also convinced Mihailović that active resistance was futile {{for as long as}} the Germans held an unassailable military advantage in the Balkans, and that killing German troops would only result in the unnecessary deaths of tens of thousands of Serbs. He therefore decided to scale back Chetnik guerrilla attacks <b>and</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> an Allied landing in the Balkans.|$|E

5|$|Two weeks {{pass and}} Pearl is still inside her gem, healing. Steven decides to use Holo-Pearl as a {{replacement}} for the real Pearl. However, Holo-Pearl only knows how to sword fight, seeing everything as a potential opponent. Garnet and Amethyst urge Steven to stop using it <b>and</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> the real Pearl to come back. After Holo-Pearl cuts down the real Pearl's favorite tree, Steven becomes infuriated and tries to drive Holo-Pearl away.|$|E
5|$|After her commissioning, München was {{employed}} as a torpedo test ship and to conduct experiments with wireless telegraphy. After the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, the ship {{was assigned to the}} High Seas Fleet. She was moored in Brunsbüttel with her sister-ship , en route to Kiel via the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal on the morning of 28 August 1914. That morning, the British attacked the German patrol line in the Heligoland Bight. During the ensuing Battle of Heligoland Bight, München and Danzig were recalled and ordered to steam to the mouth of the Elbe <b>and</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> further orders. At 12:25, the two cruisers were ordered to move into the Bight and support the cruiser , but at 14:06, München was instead ordered to conduct reconnaissance out to the north-east of Heligoland.|$|E
5|$|Back in Oslo, {{his colleagues}} throw him a {{farewell}} party, but Odda timid manis {{uncomfortable with the}} attention. As the party moves to a co-worker's apartment, he ends up getting accidentally locked out. He climbs up a scaffold, {{trying to reach the}} apartment window, and ends up in a young boy's room. The boy asks him to stay <b>and</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> him to fall asleep, but Odd falls asleep first. He oversleeps in the unfamiliar room and arrives too late for the train he was to drive on his final working day. He is left standing on the platform without any fixed points in his life, with nothing but a life of emptiness stretching out before him.|$|E

5|$|Facing continual {{threats from}} the Acrocanthosaurus, Red, {{her sister and}} the chicks are forced up into the mountains. They {{encounter}} ice and snow for the first time, and kill a segnosaur in a cave, turning the den into their nest. The older chick accompanies the two adults on hunting expeditions. One day the raptors encounter a strange creature they have never seen—a whip-tailed diplodocid who inflicts wounds on Red and her sister; the older chick is forced to set off alone and find the pack's food. This calamity coincides {{with the arrival of}} a large pack of smaller raptors known as Deinonychus. Sensing the weakness of the Utahraptor pack, they surround the nest <b>and</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> the wounded raptors to become weak enough to attack.|$|E
5|$|Following Beauchamp's failed attempt, Cooke {{decided to}} lure Sharp {{to her house}} and kill him herself. Beauchamp wanted {{to take action to}} defend her honor, but she was {{determined}} to act for herself. He began teaching her to shoot a gun. Learning that Sharp was in Bowling Green, Cooke sent him a letter condemning Beauchamp's attempt on his life and asking to see him again. Sharp suspected a trap, but replied that he would meet her at the planned time. Hoping to kill Sharp before the meeting, Beauchamp traveled to Bowling Green, but found his target had already left for Frankfort. He had eluded the trap. Beauchamp decided to finish his legal studies in Bowling Green <b>and</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> Sharp to return there.|$|E
5|$|His {{rule over}} Wallachia {{began in the}} autumn of 1593. Two years later, war with the Ottomans began, a {{conflict}} in which the Prince fought the Battle of Călugăreni, {{considered one of the most}} important battles of his reign. Although the Wallachians emerged victorious from the battle, Michael was forced to retreat with his troops <b>and</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> aid from his allies, Prince Sigismund Báthory of Transylvania and Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II. The war continued until a peace finally emerged in January 1597, but this lasted for only a year and a half. Peace was again reached in late 1599, when Michael was unable to continue the war due to lack of support from his allies.|$|E

5|$|Off California, sharks {{immobilize}} northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) {{with a large}} bite to the hindquarters (which is {{the main}} source of the seal's mobility) <b>and</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> the seal to bleed to death. This technique is especially used on adult male elephant seals, which are typically larger than the shark, ranging between , and are potentially dangerous adversaries. Most commonly though, juvenile elephant seals are the most frequently eaten at elephant seal colonies. Prey is normally attacked sub-surface. Harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) are taken from the surface and dragged down until they stop struggling. They are then eaten near the bottom. California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) are ambushed from below and struck mid-body before being dragged and eaten.|$|E
5|$|One famous {{demonstration}} of Dunstan's charismatic style and media savvy came in January 1976. A psychic predicted that, due to Dunstan and the state's social liberalisation—which {{he saw as}} sinful—God would destroy Adelaide with a tsunami caused by an earthquake. This was publicised by the media, prompting a not insignificant number of residents to sell their property and leave; some businesses had clearance sales while many who decided to stay indulged in doomsday parties. Dunstan promised {{to stand on the}} seashore at Glenelg <b>and</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> the imminent destruction. He did so on 20 January, the day of the predicted storm, and nothing happened, although he made newspaper headlines in the United Kingdom for his defiance.|$|E
5|$|Sarah disguises {{herself as}} Katja and gains {{entrance}} to her {{hotel room in}} order to find Katja's briefcase. The room has been ransacked by the time she arrives but a hotel employee gives her the briefcase, which had been left with security. Inside the briefcase Sarah finds medical images, vials of blood, and evidence of more lookalikes, including a woman named Alison Hendrix, whose address is written on a note. Believing Alison to be the woman on the phone, Sarah drives to her address and follows her van to a soccer field, where she discovers that Alison is another of her lookalikes. Alison confronts Sarah, assuming that she is Beth, and refuses to believe Sarah when she explains that Beth killed herself, telling her to leave <b>and</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> another call.|$|E
