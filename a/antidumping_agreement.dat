This paper examines the practice and recent changes regarding the PMS provision in the US by critically examining relevant antidumping investigations in the US in light of GATT/WTO jurisprudence. Such US practice {{has not yet been}} extensively subjected to scholarly examination. The paper finds that the recent legal change in the US widens the scope and applicability of the PMS provision to cover input subsidies, allowing the use of not only surrogate prices but also surrogate costs. Further, the required standard of evidence to find PMS seems to have been diminished in the recent application. A widespread use of the PMS provision in such a deviant way calls for a fundamental review of the current trade remedy rules of the WTO...|$|E

Central to the entire process of identifying if dumping has occurred or not, and therefore if antidumping measures should be enforced is the calculation of the export price because based on this element, normal value determination closely follows. This paper will point out some elements regarding the process of determining the export price and what implications can be identified for normal value calculations...|$|E
40|$|I {{show that}} there is a {{trade-off}} in the design of international agreements between depth and rigidity. Increasing the depth of required cooperation both lowers the likelihood of compliance with the treaty and decreases the stability of the regime. In contrast, as the rigidity of an agreement increases (and there is less opportunity for tolerated defection from treaty obligations), the likelihood of compliance with the treaty increases while the stability of the regime decreases. Treaty designers must balance short-term compliance against the long-run stability of a cooperative regime. I argue that this implies a negative relationship between depth and rigidity in observed treaties. In international trade, agreements that mandate deep tariff reductions {{will be more likely to}} include flexibility mechanisms—such as formal dispute settlement mechanisms, escape clauses, and <b>antidumping</b> procedures—while <b>agreements</b> that require shallow cooperation will be more rigid. I find strong support for this argument by conducting empirical tests on a dataset of 57 Asian trade agreements...|$|R
40|$|This brief {{article is}} a report of an {{international}} decision of the World Trade Organization Appellate Body on January 16, 2003, concerning the United States’ Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act of 2000 (WT/DS 217 2 ̆ 6 234 /AB/R). Eleven WTO members—Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, the European Communities, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Mexico, and Thailand—filed {{a challenge to the}} Byrd Amendment in the summer of 2001. A WTO dispute settlement panel, agreeing with the complaining parties, made two major findings. First, the panel concluded that the Byrd Amendment constitutes an impermissible specific action against dumping and subsidization under the <b>Antidumping</b> and SCM <b>Agreements.</b> 9 Second, the panel concluded that the Byrd Amendment is inconsistent with the Agreements 2 ̆ 7 requirement that investigations of dumping and subsidization have the support of a domestic industry. The panel reasoned that many firms might file or support applications for relief from dumping and subsidization, even if they were not really affected by import competition, simply in order to qualify for Byrd Amendment distributions. The United States might thus initiate an investigation even though actual support in domestic industry was lacking. On appeal, the Appellate Body upheld the panel 2 ̆ 7 s holding that the Byrd Amendment constitutes an impermissible action against dumping or subsidization, but reversed the panel 2 ̆ 7 s holding on the industry-support question. With respect to the first issue, the Appellate Body noted that the <b>Antidumping</b> and SCM <b>Agreements</b> provide that 2 ̆ 2 [n]o specific action against 2 ̆ 2 dumping or subsidization may be taken by a member except as authorized by WTO rules. The Appellate Body easily concluded that the Byrd Amendment constitutes a 2 ̆ 2 specific action 2 ̆ 2 for these purposes. Payments under the Byrd Amendment, it explained, 2 ̆ 2 are inextricably linked to, and strongly correlated with, 2 ̆ 2 a determination of dumping or subsidization. Without a determination of dumping or subsidization, there would be no antidumping or countervailing duties to distribute...|$|R
40|$|This study {{covers the}} history of Sino-US trade {{relations}} with a particular focus on the past decade, during which time each {{has been a member}} of the World Trade Organization (WTO). Providing a brief history of 19 th and 20 th century economic relations, this paper examines in detail the trade disputes that have arisen between China and the United States over the past decade, giving dollar estimates for the trade flows at issue. Each country has partaken in their share of protectionist measures, however, US measures have been characteristically defensive, protecting declining industries, while Chinese measures have been characteristically offensive, promoting nascent industries. We also cover administrative and legislation actions within each country that have yet to be the subject of formal complaint at the WTO. This includes an original and comprehensive quantitative summary of US Section 337 intellectual property rights cases. While we view the frictions in Sino-US trade a logical consequence of the rapid increase in flows between the two countries, we caution that each country work within the WTO framework and respect any adverse decisions it delivers so that a protracted protectionist conflict does not emerge. We see the current currency battle as one potential catalyst for such conflict if US and Chinese policymakers fail to manage it judiciously. <b>Agreement,</b> Anti Dumping, <b>Antidumping,</b> Commodity <b>Agreements,</b> Dumping, Duty, Export Promoting, Export Restrictions, Exports, Free Trade, GATT, GATT WTO, General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, Import, Import Restricted, Import Subsidies, Import Subsidy, Intellectual Property Rights, International Agreement, International Trade Agreements, International Trade Organizations, Liberalization, MFN, Multilateralism, Non Tariff, Nontariff Barrier, Openness, Optimal Trade Policy, Protectionism, Protectionist, Quotas, Sanctions, Services, Smoot Hawley, Subsidies, Tariff, Trade, Trade Agreements, International Trade. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{essay is}} about the {{application}} of procedural approaches in the US-Zeroing case that serve to highlight potential problems with Appellate Body decision-making. Those problems go to central issues of judicial restraint, including concerns surrounding standards of review, appellate fact-finding, and notions of justiciability and ripeness. This essay will begin with an analysis of US-Zeroing 2 ̆ 7 s approach in applying the specialized standard of review under the <b>Antidumping</b> <b>Agreement,</b> arguing that it fails {{to adhere to the}} obligation of deference to permissible Member State interpretations of WTO antidumping obligations.

Finally, it concludes with a discussion of the Appellate Body 2 ̆ 7 s rejection of the mandatory/discretionary doctrine, a key tool that restricts the jurisdictional authority of the WTO. The essay concludes that the Appellate Body in US-Zeroing circumvented the particularized standard of review required under the <b>Antidumping</b> <b>Agreement,</b> took upon itself the unacceptable task of appellate fact-finding, and inappropriately expanded the authority of WTO panels to hear facial challenges of agency measures.

The conventional view that few antidumping cases existed prior to 1980 is not correct, although most {{did not result in}} the imposition of duties. The increased number of cases in recent decades largely reflects petitions that target multiple source countries; the number of imported products involved has actually fallen since the mid 1980 s. The annual number of antidumping cases is influenced by the unemployment rate, the exchange rate, import penetration (closely related to the decline in average tariffs), and changes in the antidumping law and enforcement in the early 1980 s.

40|$|On December 10, 2001 the U. S. Department of Commerce (DOC) imposed steep {{antidumping}} duties against honey {{imports from}} Argentina and China ranging from 32. 6 percent to 183. 8 percent, and a countervailing duty against Argentina of 5. 9 percent. A previous antidumping investigation in 1995 {{ended with a}} suspension"agreement"that curtailed U. S. imports from China by around 30 percent. Millions of beekeepers around the world, most of them poor, make a living from honey production, and a free and competitive world market would help raise their standards of living. Nevertheless, the sequential pattern of increasing and widening protectionism followed by the United States, the world's top importer, to include successful exporters under the effects of its contingent protection measures sends a clear message that other countries should think twice before investing in expanding honey exports to the United States. In addition to looking into the trade effects of these contingent protection measures, the author concludes that under the regulatory arrangements of the DOC, Argentina's beekeepers {{never had a chance}} of defending themselves. For example, responding to the DOC's lengthy and sophisticated questionnaires that sought to determine cost of production went beyond the capacities of poor beekeepers. In the absence of information, the DOC resorted to evidence presented by the petitioners which was riddled with errors. The available evidence suggests that had beekeepers been capable of responding to the questionnaires, the margin of dumping would had been lower, if at all existent. This and other evidence discussed by the author suggest the urgent need to introduce reforms into the World Trade Organization <b>antidumping</b> and subsidy <b>agreements.</b> At the minimum what is required is a consensus that all respondents be given the same opportunity by the international trade rules.

40|$|Abstract: In {{the context}} of an {{antidumping}} investigation, the dumping margin {{is one of the key}} elements that need to be considered by the authorities. Without a sufficiently significant dumping margin, the investigation cannot conclude with the imposition of sanctions. Given the special interests that often influence the antidumping investigation, the need to identify dumping even if there is no such practice involved often makes the authorities use innovative methods of calculating key elements like the dumping margin. One of the most used such methods is the zeroing procedure. Key words: antidumping, dumping margin, zeroing The <b>Antidumping</b> <b>Agreement</b> allows two ways if calculating the dumping margin (which represents the difference between the export price of a good and the price considered normal for it, considering factors like production costs, transportation and normal profit margin).

It is essential to be wary of this trend as unlike the other two types of injury, the WTO lacks specific guidelines for the use of this standard.

40|$|More than {{a century}} has passed since Canada adopted the first {{antidumping}} law in 1904. Similar legislation {{in most of the}} major trading nations followed the Canadian legislation prior to and after the World War II. Antidumping provisions were later integrated into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) after the said war. Today, nearly all developed and developing countries have this type of legislation in place within their municipal legal framework. The subject of antidumping has received growing attention in international trade policy and has become a source of tension between trading nations. This is evident in the substantial increase of antidumping actions since the establishment of the WTO. Antidumping policy has emerged as a significant trade barrier because of its misuse by both developed and developing countries. The primary instruments governing antidumping actions are GATT Article VI and the <b>Antidumping</b> <b>Agreement</b> (ADA). The ADA contains both the substantive and procedural rules governing the interpretation and application of the instrument. Its purpose is to ensure that the instrument is used only as a contingency measure judged upon merit and not as a disguised protectionist device. Given the growing number of countries participating more actively in the world trading system and the notorious misuse of antidumping provisions, there is a vital need to critically analyse the key provisions of the said instruments. This study is an attempt at that academic enterprise. It concludes by giving proposals for future reform of both real and potential future reform of the current WTO antidumping regime.

40|$|The {{alarming}} {{increase in}} the number of antidumping actions pursued by both industrial and developing countries has caused considerable concern among economists, lawyers, and trade reformers. These concerns have led to suggestions to substitute antitrust principles for antidumping laws and regulations or to use safeguard measures under Article XIX of GATT 1994 and the Uruguay Round Agreement on Safeguards. The author contends that, under current international trade law, neither proposal appears feasible. Moreover, antidumping actions have become a fact of life and the international community recognizes them as the only legitimate tool to combat dumping as defined by and determined in accordance with law. Despite urgings in some quarters, neither national legal systems nor international agreements have mandated an economy-wide cost-benefit analysis of proposed antidumping actions. Because of political, technical, and other implications, such a methodology is unlikely to be accepted soon. Although the most recent Uruguay Round <b>antidumping</b> <b>agreement</b> (URAA) has enhanced the discipline and made a number of improvements, it cannot claim to have plugged all loopholes for the misuse of antidumping. In those matters on which the agreement is silent or ambiguous or allows room for flexibility in adopting a less restrictive rule or practice. A case in point is the U. S. practice on voting in the International Trade Commission. A 3 - 3 vote in antidumping and countervailing duty investigation constitutes an affirmative decision. It would be preferable to require a clear majority rather than treat an evenly divided vote as sufficient to establish a finding of injury.

40|$|Dumping is {{generally}} considered an unfair practice and through the <b>Antidumping</b> <b>Agreement</b> of the GATT many governments offer protection to domestic producers against dumped goods. In 1992 and 1998 large amounts of steel entered the U. S. at low prices, and large amounts of antidumping investigations were initiated in order to curb the surge of imports flooding the country. The increase in steel imports in 1992 {{was related to the}} laps of the voluntary export restraints, while the increase in 1998 was a result of the collapse of the Asian markets in 1997. “The 1998 U. S. Steel Crisis” that followed the significant increase in steel imports caused domestic turmoil in the U. S., but there is reason to question if there really was a major crisis. Further, the U. S. steel sector has been receiving considerable amounts of protection during the last three decades and the difficulties it has been facing may well be due to inefficiency in the U. S. sector rather unfair trade practices in foreign markets. Japanese iron and steel exports have traditionally been a major target of U. S. antidumping investigations. Significant amounts of antidumping investigations were initiated in both 1992 and 1999, in an attempt to hinder iron and steel imports from Japan and provide protection to the domestic producers. The success was however recognized as limited, mainly due to the specific nature of the antidumping measure.

40|$|The {{founding}} of the World Trade Organization in 1995, was hailed as {{a new era in}} resolving global trade disputes, with many academicians espousing a constitutionalised vision of world trade law. The constitutional evolution of WTO law is founded, not only on the text of the WTO Covered Agreements, but is also buttressed exceedingly by precedence and norms that are generated through adjudication by the panels and the standing WTO Appellate Body. Today, as is with most mature legal systems, international lawyers and academics avidly critique WTO jurisprudence and the interpretive methodology of its adjudicators. However, there is a dearth of scholarship on the implications of WTO law interpretation on developing nations. This thesis fills this void in research by constructing a framework for analysing the jurisprudence of the WTO from the perspective of developing nations. Subsequently, it proceeds to evaluate three agreements which are important for developing nations, i. e., the DSU and due process rights, the TRIPS Agreement, and the <b>Antidumping</b> <b>Agreement.</b> To this end, the framework for analysis is termed "the development approach" to fair adjudication, which is grounded on established legal concepts of legitimacy, justice and ultimately fairness. The thesis demonstrates that a fair trading regime entails more than seemingly balanced treaty texts, but rather that adjudication of the treaties must include an approach, which recognises and accounts for the effects of interpretation on development. To this end, the adjudicators have to go beyond merely finding the literal meaning of the treaty text, but embrace an approach, which is guided by the context and purpose of WTO provisions. The analysis reveals that the adjudicators of the WTO have failed to recognise the nexus between interpretation and development and as such, have created a body of case law that harms the development ambitions of third world countries...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a horizontal comparison among various arrangements for regional economic integration, {{focusing on the}} types of disciplines on application of antidumping measures, and thereby attempts to identify prerequisites that must be satisfied for the introduction of such disciplines. Regional economic integration arrangements under survey can be classified into three groups, depending on how they deal with antidumping measures. First, there are those that prohibit the application of antidumping measures, such as the European Community (EC), the European Economic Area (EEA), the Australia-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement (ANZCERTA), the Canada-Chile Free Trade Agreement, and the Agreement between the EFTA States and Singapore. Second, there are those that impose "WTO-plus" substantive disciplines on antidumping measures stricter than provided for under the WTO <b>Antidumping</b> <b>Agreement.</b> Included in this group are the Agreement between New Zealand and Singapore on a Closer Economic Partnership, and the Agreement between Jordan and Singapore on the Establishment of a Free Trade Area. The third group of arrangements provides for virtually no WTO-plus discipline on antidumping measures, as seen {{in a series of}} free trade agreements (FTAs) recently concluded by the United States. This paper analyzes experiences with these different types of regional arrangements in light of various theories on conditions for the occurrence of dumping {{as well as on the}} raison d'etre of antidumping measures, thereby identifying prerequisites for abolishing antidumping measures. First, it is necessary to remove "government-imposed market separation" by achieving free trade. Second, "private-sector-caused market separation" must be removed by harmonizing competition laws. Third, if substitute disciplines and enforcement cooperation, which could prevent and/or counteract dumping, are introduced in competition law, it would ease the way for the abolition of antidumping measures. In this sense, whether or not abolish antidumping measures may be regarded as an "indicator of the degree of market integration. " Meanwhile, to enable the introduction of WTO-plus disciplines on antidumping measures, countries concerned must share interests in setting precedents, for instance, for WTO negotiations on antidumping rules. They must also not be in a state of unbalance with antidumping measures being applied by one country to the other but not vice versa. These findings would have policy implications for the development of the WTO antidumping negotiations as well as for Japan's negotiations for future FTAs and economic partnership agreements (EPAs). ...|$|E
40|$|Excerpt] Congress has {{comprehensively}} {{dealt with}} the legal effect of World Trade Organization (WTO) agreements and dispute settlement results in the United States in the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (URAA), P. L. 103 - 465. The act provides that domestic law prevails over conflicting provisions of WTO agreements and prohibits private remedies based on alleged violations of these agreements. As a result, provisions of WTO agreements and WTO panel and Appellate Body reports adopted by the WTO Members that are in conflict with federal law do not have domestic legal effect unless and until Congress or the executive branch, {{as the case may}} be, takes action to modify or remove the conflicting statute, regulation, or regulatory action. Violative state laws may be withdrawn by the state or, in rare circumstances, invalidated through legal action by the federal government. The URAA also contains requirements for agencies to follow where a change in a regulation or the issuance of a new agency determination in a trade remedy proceeding is needed to comply with a WTO decision and existing law may be sufficient to carry out the action. While the URAA prohibits private rights of action based on Uruguay Round agreements, plaintiffs, in cases brought under other statutes, have argued that the agency actions they are challenging in court are inconsistent with a WTO agreement or a WTO decision and should conform with U. S. WTO obligations. Although courts have deemed WTO decisions to be persuasive, they have also held that they are not binding on the United States, U. S. agencies, or the judiciary, leaving the issue of whether and how the United States complies in a particular WTO proceeding to the executive branch. Legislation introduced in recent Congresses generally reflected congressional concerns that the WTO Appellate Body had interpreted WTO agreements in an overly broad manner {{to the detriment of the}} United States and that the executive branch had in some cases too readily used existing statutory authorities to comply with these decisions, particularly where U. S. trade remedies were involved. Legislation particularly focused on WTO decisions finding the U. S. use of “zeroing” in antidumping proceedings to be in violation of the WTO <b>Antidumping</b> <b>Agreement</b> and an administrative modification instituted by the Department of Commerce in original anti-dumping investigations in response to one of the earliest of these decisions. Under the practice, the department calculates dumping margins by taking into account only sales below fair market value—generally the price in the exporting country—and assigns a zero value to sales at or above this price. While it is argued that zeroing improperly creates or inflates dumping margins, U. S. courts have consistently upheld the department’s use of the practice as valid under U. S. antidumping law...|$|E
40|$|As medidas {{antidumping}} são uma exceção ao livre comércio e como tal deveriam ser usadas com restrição. No entanto, desde o GATT 1947 há preocupação com o uso abusivo de tais medidas, podendo ser o mecanismo utilizado não apenas para possibilitar a recuperação da indústria doméstica prejudicada pelas importações objeto de dumping, objetivo do Acordo Antidumping (AAD), mas com o fim de proteger a indústria nacional da concorrência estrangeira. Desta forma, o objetivo do presente trabalho é apresentar as principais características do AAD firmado ao final da Rodada Uruguai que culminou na constituição da Organização Mundial do Comércio (OMC), incluindo seus antecedentes históricos e a possibilidade de aplicação discricionária, demonstrando como uma norma surgida no plano internacional em decorrência de um acordo multilateral vem sendo utilizada pelo Brasil, com a finalidade de se demonstrar a possibilidade de uso das medidas antidumping como barreira à entrada no mercado brasileiro. Confirmada a possibilidade de uso abusivo desse instrumento de defesa comercial, ainda que no plano teórico, uma vez que não é possível analisar os efeitos reais das medidas aplicadas, serão apresentadas as formas de contrabalanço ao protecionismo atualmente existentes no próprio AAD e sua incorporação e utilização pelo Brasil bem como a possibilidade de questionamento de tais medidas como práticas anticompetitivas com fundamento na legislação antitruste perante as autoridades de defesa da concorrência. Serão ainda analisadas outras possibilidades de contrabalanço ao uso exacerbado das medidas antidumping em debate e viabilidade das mesmas no cenário atual em que se verifica, de um lado, o aumento de uso de tais medidas pelos países Membros da OMC, destacando-se o Brasil e, de outro lado, impasse nas negociações multilaterais, cabendo aos Membros tomarem decisões unilaterais sobre a aplicação de tais medidas, seu grau de intensidade e forma de aplicação a depender da proteção que se pretende garantir à indústria nacional. Antidumping {{measures are}} {{an exception to}} the free trade and as such they should be used with restrictions. However, since GATT 1947 there is a concern regarding the abuse in the use of such measures, being possible the use of the instrument not only to make possible the recovery of the domestic industry that was injured by the dumped imports, purpose of the <b>Antidumping</b> <b>Agreement</b> (ADA), but also with the purpose of protecting the domestic industry of the foreign competition. Thus, the purpose of this Masters Thesis is to present the main aspects of the ADA signed {{as a result of the}} Uruguay Round, that led to the establishment of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including its historical background and the possibility of discretionary application, being demonstrated how a rule emerged in an international level as part of a multilateral agreement has been used by Brazil. The purpose is to demonstrate the possibility of the use of the antidumping measures as a barrier to entry in the Brazilian market. Being confirmed the possibility of the abusive use of this trade defense instrument, even if only in theory, since it is not possible to analyze the actual impacts of the applied measures, it will be present the possibilities to counterbalance the protectionism that are established in the ADA, namely the public interest clause and the lesser duty rule, and their adoption and use by Brazil and possibility of challenging such measures as anticompetitive practices based on the antitrust law before the Brazilian Antitrust Authority. Additional possibilities under debate and their feasibility to counterbalance the abuse in the use of the antidumping measures will also be analyzed in the actual scenario where, on one hand, there is the increase of such measures by WTO Members in general and mainly Brazil and, on the other hand, there is an impasse in the multilateral negotiations. The Members will have to unilaterally decide on the implementation of such measures, the level of its intensity and form of application depending on the intended protection to ensure the domestic industry...|$|E
40|$|Excerpt] Dispute {{settlement}} in the World Trade Organization (WTO) is carried out under the WTO Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes (DSU). In effect since January 1995, the DSU provides for consultations between disputing parties, panels and appeals, and possible retaliation if a defending party fails {{to comply with a}} WTO decision by an established deadline. Automatic establishment of panels, adoption of panel and appellate reports, and authorization of requests to retaliate, along with deadlines and improved multilateral oversight of compliance, are aimed at producing a more expeditious and effective system than had existed under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). To date, 398 complaints have been filed, approximately half involving the United States as complainant or defendant. Expressing dissatisfaction with WTO dispute settlement results in the trade remedy area, Congress, in the Trade Act of 2002, directed the executive branch to address dispute {{settlement in}} WTO negotiations. WTO Members have been negotiating DSU revisions in the currently stalled Doha Development Round of trade negotiations but no final agreement on the DSU has been reached. Use of the DSU has revealed procedural gaps, particularly affecting the compliance phase of a dispute. These include a failure to coordinate procedures for requesting retaliation with procedures for tasking a WTO panel with determining whether a defending Member has complied in a case and the absence of a procedure for withdrawing trade sanctions imposed by a complaining Member where the defending Member believes it has fulfilled its WTO obligations. As a result, disputing Members have entered into bilateral agreements permitting retaliation and compliance panel processes to progress on an agreed schedule and have initiated new dispute proceedings aimed at removing retaliatory measures. Where a U. S. law or regulation is at issue in a WTO case, the adoption by the WTO of a panel or Appellate Body report finding that the measure violates a WTO agreement does not give the report direct legal effect in this country; thus federal law is not affected until Congress or the executive branch, as the case may be, takes action to remove the offending measure. Where a restrictive foreign trade practice is at issue, Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 provides a mechanism by which the United States Trade Representative (USTR) may challenge the measure in a WTO dispute settlement proceeding and authorizes the USTR to take retaliatory action if the defending Member has not complied with the resulting WTO decision. Although Section 301 was challenged in the WTO on the ground that it requires the USTR to act unilaterally in WTO-related trade disputes in violation of DSU provisions requiring resort to multilateral WTO dispute settlement, the United States was ultimately found not to be in violation of its DSU obligations. H. R. 496 (Rangel) would create an Office of the Congressional Trade Enforcer (CTE) that would, inter alia, investigate restrictive foreign trade practices in light of WTO obligations and call on the USTR to initiate WTO dispute proceedings where the CTE finds that WTO violations have occurred; express congressional dissatisfaction with WTO dispute settlement decisions finding that the U. S. practice of “zeroing” (i. e., disregarding non-dumped sales in the calculation of dumping margins) violates the WTO <b>Antidumping</b> <b>Agreement</b> and with decisions of the WTO Appellate Body generally; and place restrictions on the Department of Commerce in implementing the revised antidumping methodology that it adopted in 2007 in response to the WTO “zeroing” decisions. S. 363 (Snowe), would give the U. S. Court of International Trade exclusive jurisdiction to review de novo certain USTR determinations under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, which may in some cases involve the initiation and conduct of WTO disputes; the bill would also amend various Section 301 authorities themselves...|$|E
