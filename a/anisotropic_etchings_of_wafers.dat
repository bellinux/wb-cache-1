40|$|An ultrasensitive {{displacement}} {{sensing device}} {{for use in}} accelerometers, pressure gauges, temperature transducers, and the like, comprises a sputter deposited, multilayer, magnetoresistive field sensor with a variable electrical resistance based on an imposed magnetic field. The device detects displacement by sensing changes in the local magnetic field about the magnetoresistive field sensor caused by the displacement of a hard magnetic film on a movable microstructure. The microstructure, which may be a cantilever, membrane, bridge, or other microelement, moves {{under the influence of}} an acceleration a known displacement predicted by the configuration and materials selected, and the resulting change in the electrical resistance of the MR sensor can be used to calculate the displacement. Using a micromachining approach, very thin silicon and silicon nitride membranes are fabricated in one preferred embodiment by means <b>of</b> <b>anisotropic</b> <b>etching</b> <b>of</b> silicon <b>wafers.</b> Other approaches include reactive ion <b>etching</b> <b>of</b> silicon on insulator (SOI), or Low Pressure Chemical Vapor Deposition of silicon nitride films over silicon substrates.

40|$|Design and Implementation of a Silicon-Beam Angular Rate Sensor is studied. The {{sensing device}} is {{designed}} {{based on a}} micromachined single crystal silicon beam. Electromagnetic actuation supplies the reference vibration, and the Coriolis-induced vibration is sensed by a capacitor plate {{in close proximity to}} the vibrating beam. Beams with precise dimensions, and vertical side walls are fabricated using wet <b>anisotropic</b> <b>etching</b> <b>of</b> Si 100 <b>wafers</b> in TMAH 25 %. Several issues essential for a successful design are discussed. The required circuitry for actuation of the beam and detection of the Coriolis induced vibrations are discussed. A complete model for the mechanical and electrical components of the sensor is built in HSPICE and used to simulate the basic operation of the sensor. To improve the mismatch between beam resonant frequencies, a scheme of novel Concave Corner Compensation Patterns is devised to substantially reduce the size of the residual 111 flanges {{at both ends of the}} beams. The design principles are explained in detail and a numerical simulation program is developed to track the etch progress of the corner compensation patterns. The etch progress in patterns is simulated using a graphical simulation tool and tested experimentally. Experimental results are matched with simulation results. Several test beam structures have been fabricated and tested. Some critical mechanical characteristics of the beam structures are measured and satisfactorily compared with the results from theory and Finite Element Model simulation.

Variations of under-etched surfaces near enough to o planes are well-matched by the model. Planes near n and d cannot be matched by this simple formulation.
