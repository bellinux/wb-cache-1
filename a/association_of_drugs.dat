Additionally, HSA is widely used in clinical settings as a drug delivery system due to its potential for improving targeting while decreasing {{the side effects of}} drugs. It is thus of great importance from the viewpoint of pharmaceutical sciences to clarify the structure, function, and properties of HSA–drug complexes. This review will succinctly outline the properties of binding site of drugs in IIA subdomain within the structure of HSA. We will also give an overview on the binding characterization of interactive <b>association</b> <b>of</b> <b>drugs</b> to human serum albumin that may potentially lead to significant clinical applications...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The use {{of drugs}} in fixed-dose {{combination}} (FDC) is now recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) due {{to the emergence of}} multidrug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. FDC uses different drugs against tuberculosis (TB) in a single tablet for phase-intensive therapeutic intervention. This therapy aims to optimize treatment, to prevent inappropriate {{use of drugs}}, and to prevent the emergence of new resistant strains. This study aims to evaluate the susceptibility of clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis against rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide. The antimicrobials were tested separately and in associations according to FDC. This was used for broth microdilution method, which was compared to the proportions method previously considered as the gold standard. In antimicrobials testing alone, several strains were resistant to one, two, or three drugs. However, when applied to <b>association</b> <b>of</b> <b>drugs</b> in FDC, there was no antimicrobial resistance. The results strengthen the FDC's concept, which aims to unite the four anti-TB drugs to combat bacterial resistance...|$|E
40|$|Effective {{treatment}} of {{high blood pressure}} represents a key strategy for reducing the burden of hypertension-related cardiovascular diseases. In spite of these well-established concepts, hypertension remains poorly controlled worldwide. In addition, treated hypertensive patients often remain at higher risk compared with the normotensive population, even when a satisfactory blood pressure control is achieved, owing to a high or very high added cardiovascular risk profile. An emerging strategy to improve blood pressure control in hypertensive patients is a more extensive use of combination therapy than monotherapy in the daily clinical practice. Within the possible antihypertensive drug combinations currently available for the clinical management of hypertension, those based on the <b>association</b> <b>of</b> <b>drugs</b> inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system and thiazide diuretics or calcium channel-blockers have demonstrated to be effective and safe in lowering both systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels with a good tolerability profile.

40|$|Infectious {{diseases}} (ID) {{represent an}} immense global threat, {{being responsible for}} 15 million of deaths per year worldwide. The ID caused by intracellular microorganisms, such as M. tuberculosis, Leishmania, M. avium and Plasmodium sp, {{are very difficult to}} eradicate by the conventional therapies due to the low access of drugs to the sites of infection resulting in sub-therapeutic local drug concentration. Besides, severe side effects and poor compliance have been reported, being in the origin of pathogen resistant strains and treatment failure. Therefore non conventional strategies able to modify drugs behaviour and to improve their therapeutic index are needed. One of these strategies is the <b>association</b> <b>of</b> <b>drugs</b> to systems able to direct them to the sites of infection, namely macrophages, instead of using “naked” (free) drugs.

A quantitative knowledge of <b>association</b> <b>of</b> <b>drugs</b> with transport vehicles is lacking when the latter are in the category of self assembled structures. The work reported in this manuscript addresses the mechanism of partitioning of naproxen, diclofenac sodium, neomycin and lincomycin in the micelles of hexadecytrimethylammonium bromide and that is quantitatively based on the measurement of thermodynamic parameters of interactions by using isothermal titration calorimetry. The addressed mechanism of partitioning is based on the identification of the type of interactions of these drugs with the surfactant micelles and monomers, along with the effect of the former on the micellization properties of the surfactant. The conclusions are based on the interpretation of the values of partitioning constant, standard molar enthalpy change, standard molar entropy change and the stoichiometry of the interaction. The results of this study have implications for deriving guidelines for the target oriented synthesis of new drugs that are to be used for effective delivery via micellar media. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.

Forma de estudo: Prospectivo clínico não randomizado. Método: o fluxo salivar foi avaliado em 11 pacientes (n= 11) em três fases: 1 ª.) durante sete semanas, quando foram submetidos à telecobaltoterapia na dose total de 7. 000 cGy, sem utilização de medicamento para estimular a salivação; 2 ª.) em seguida, durante oito semanas após o tratamento radioterápico, quando os pacientes utilizaram a associação medicamentosa como estimulante da salivação; 3 ª.) finalmente, durante oito semanas após ter sido interrompido o tratamento com a associação de drogas. Resultados: os valores obtidos foram analisados com vistas a avaliação da eficácia da medicação utilizada para evitar a hipofunção salivar no período pós-radioterapia. Dos 11 pacientes, 10 apresentaram melhora significante dos índices de fluxo salivar com o uso da associação de drogas, em relação aos valores do período final do tratamento radioterápico, e mantiveram esses índices mesmo com a suspensão do medicamento. Conclusões: a associação de drogas foi eficaz no tratamento da hipofunção salivar, e proporcionou aumento do índice salivar total não estimulado em 10 dos 11 pacientes, sendo esse aumento mantido por dois meses após a interrupção do uso do medicamento.

40|$|Introduction: Effective {{treatment}} of hypertension {{is a key}} strategy for preventing and reducing the burden of hypertension-related cardiovascular diseases. In spite of these well-established concepts, hypertension remains poorly controlled, worldwide. Among the different pharmacological strategies required to improve blood pressure (BP) control, a more extensive use of combination therapy is progressively emerging as a cornerstone of a more effective {{treatment of}} hypertension. Among different drug combinations currently available for the clinical management of hypertension, those based on the <b>association</b> <b>of</b> <b>drugs</b> inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system, thiazide diuretics and calcium channel blockers have demonstrated to be very effective in lowering both systolic and diastolic, clinic and 24 -h ambulatory BP levels with a good tolerability and safety profile. Areas covered: In the present manuscript the authors {{provide an overview of}} the evidence supporting the use of triple combination therapy with different classes of antihypertensive drugs, with a particular focus on those based on olmesartan medoxomil, a thiazide diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide) and a calcium channel blocker (amlodipine besylate).

Ethidium {{was chosen for}} a simple DNA binding compound because it binds to right-handed DNA and hybrid B-Z forms containing a B-Z junction in a highly cooperative manner. The binding isotherms were analyzed by an allosteric model in order to describe the cooperativity of associ-ation. Binding of ethidium to the DNA that are initially in the hybrid B-Z forms showed over {{an order of magnitude}} higher affinity than other DNA which were entirely in the B-form. The conformational transitions of deoxyoligo-nucleotides containing a B-Z junction as a result of ethidium binding were monitored by CD and the influence of NaCl on the complex formation was also determined by the CD spectra. The singular value decomposition (SVD) analysis was used to characterize a family of CD spectra of the species in binding equilibria. The results of SVD analysis showed a strikingly complex thermodynamic equilibria of cooperative binding of drugs to the allosteri-cally converted DNA forms. The results also showed that these DNA forms in low- and high-salt were different in the absence or presence of drug.

40|$|Despite {{extensive}} {{debate about}} the first choice for treating essential hypertension, monotherapy effectively normalizes blood pressure (BP) values in {{only a limited number}} of hypertensive patients. Thus, the aim of combination therapy should always be to both improve BP control and to reduce cardiovascular events. Antihypertensive drugs can be effectively combined if they have different and complementary mechanisms of action. This is crucial to obtain additive BP-lowering effects without impacting on tolerability. One typical combination is the <b>association</b> <b>of</b> <b>drugs</b> blocking and stimulating the renin–angiotensin system (RAS) (angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker and calcium antagonist or diuretic, respectively). In contrast, some combinations (e. g., calcium antagonists plus diuretics or beta-blockers plus RAS blockers) have no additive BP-lowering effects, while other combinations (e. g., clonidine plus alpha- 1 receptor blockers) can have a negative interaction. Regardless, BP reduction is not the only mechanism that reduces cardiovascular risk. Scientific evidence indicates that some drug classes are better than others in this respect, and therefore some drug combinations are also better than others. The results of the ASCOT-BPLA and ACCOMPLISH trials suggested that an ACE inhibitor/calcium antagonist combination had better cardioprotective effects than beta-blocker/diuretic or ACE inhibitor/diuretic combinations. It is worth noting that no controlled clinical trials have used hard endpoints when investigating the effects of an angiotensin receptor blocker/calcium antagonist combination. In conclusion, combination therapy is needed for optimal antihypertensive management, with the first choice being an ACE inhibitor plus a calcium antagonist. This approach should improve BP control and provide better cardiovascular protection...|$|E

FTY 720 is a new synthetic compound which presents immunomodulatory properties which are not fully understood. It has been reported that the main mechanism of action of FTY 720 is to reduce the peripheral lymphocyte count by redirecting these cells toward secondary lymphoid organs. Skin allograft transplantation in a fully mismatched strain combination was used to investigate the potential of FTY 720 alone or in combination with a calcineurin inhibitor - FK 506 - in preventing rejection. The number and phenotype of immune system cells was also evaluated. FTY 720 alone or in combination with FK 506 provided significant skin allograft survival. FTY 720 +FK 506 therapy was associated with decreases of total lymphocyte numbers in spleen and blood, and increases in apoptosis levels in splenocytes. In FTY 720 isolated treatment, a significant decrease in the CD 4 expression and significantly lower expressions of MHC II and ICAM- 1 molecules were observed in spleen lymphocytes. Despite of allograft survival being the same in both FTY 720 and FTY 720 +FK 506 treated groups, the <b>association</b> <b>of</b> <b>drugs</b> was associated with the absence of macroscopic skin necrosis for a longer period than the other treatments (FTY 720, FK 506) and histology showed less cell infiltration.

40|$|Repeated <b>association</b> <b>of</b> <b>drugs</b> {{of abuse}} with context leads to {{long-lasting}} behavioral responses that reflect reward-controlled learning {{and participate in}} the establishment of addiction. Reactivation of consolidated memories is known to produce a reconsolidation process during which memories undergo a labile state. We investigated whether reexposure to drugs had similar effects. Cocaine administration activates extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in the striatum, and ERK activation is required for the acquisition of cocaine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP). When mice previously conditioned for cocaine-place preference were reexposed to cocaine in the drug-paired compartment after systemic administration of SL 327, an inhibitor of ERK activation, CPP response was abolished 24 h later. This procedure also abolished the phosphorylation of ERK and glutamate receptor- 1 observed in the ventral and dorsal striatum, 24 h later, during CPP test. Erasure of CPP by SL 327 required the combination of cocaine administration and drug-paired context and did not result from enhanced extinction. Similarly, reexposure to morphine in the presence of SL 327 long-lastingly abolished response of previously learned morphine-CPP. The effects of SL 327 on cocaine- or morphine-CPP were reproduced by protein synthesis inhibition. In contrast, protein synthesis inhibition did not alter previously acquired locomotor sensitization to cocaine. Our findings show that an established CPP can be disrupted when reactivation associates both the conditioned context and drug administration. This process involves ERK, and systemic treatment preventing ERK activation during reexposure erases the previously learned behavioral response. These results suggest potential therapeutic strategies to explore in the context of addiction...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the feasibility of}} the combined use of bevacizumab (Avastin®) and combined with infliximab (Remicade®) {{in the treatment of}} naive choroidal neovascularization due to age-related macular degeneration eyes. METHODS: Intravitreal injections of bevacizumab combined with infliximab in 6 neovascular age-related macular degeneration eyes. All patients underwent complete ophthalmologic examination on the initial visit and at days 1, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 following the first injection. Optical coherence tomography and fluorescein angiography were performed during at initial visit and monthly during the 6 months follow-up period. Electroretinography was performed before and 30 days after initial injection, in order to evaluate retinal toxicity induced by such treatment. RESULTS: Thirty days after the first injection, 5 eyes (83 %) shown decrease in macular thickness. No change was seen in electroretinogram in any eyes compared to initially performed electroretinogram. All phakic eyes developed cataract. One patient developed vitritis and was submitted to medical treatment successfully. At the end of the 6 months follow-up period, 4 patients showed significant improvement in the exudative process of choroidal neovascularization. One eye had mild persistent submacular fluid without active choroidal neovascularization, and another eye had persistent amount of intraretinal fluid due to active choroidal neovascularization. CONCLUSION: The combined use of bevacizumab with infliximab in eyes with neovascular age-related macular degeneration was effective in reducing leakage and improving the macular thickness.

40|$|Background: Isothermal {{titration}} calorimetry (ITC) {{has emerged}} as an excellent method to characterize drug protein interactions. 5 -Fluorouracil and cyclophosphamide {{have been used in}} combination for the treatment of breast carcinoma, though individually these drugs have also been useful in treating other types of cancer. A quantitative understanding of binding of these drugs with the transport protein under different conditions is essential for optimizing recognition by the protein and delivery at the target. Methods: The values of binding constant, enthalpy, and entropy of binding have been determined by using ITC. Fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopies have been used to obtain further support to calorimetric observations, monitor conformational changes in the protein and establishing stoichiometry of association. Results: The thermodynamic parameters have enabled a quantitative understanding of the affinity of 5 -fluorouracil and cyclophosphamide with bovine serum albumin. The nature of binding has been unraveled based on effect of ionic strength, tetrabutyl-ammonium bromide, and sucrose which interfere in ionic, hydrophobic, and hydrogen bonding interactions. The binding site has been identified by using site marker warfarin in combination with 5 -fluorouracil and cyclophosphamide. Further, the experiments have been done to establish whether both the drugs share the same binding site, and the effect of antibiotic drug carbenecillin and anti-inflammatory drug naproxen on their association. General significance: Tuning optimum <b>association</b> <b>of</b> <b>drugs</b> with the transport vehicles for effective drug delivery requires identification of the nature of interacting groups in terms of energetics of interactions. Such studies employing ITC have direct significance in rational drug design.

40|$|Abstract Background Side {{effects are}} {{unwanted}} responses to drug treatment and are important resources for human phenotype information. The recent {{development of a}} database on side effects, the side effect resource (SIDER), {{is a first step}} in documenting the relationship between drugs and their side effects. It is, however, insufficient to simply find the <b>association</b> <b>of</b> <b>drugs</b> with biological processes; that relationship is crucial because drugs that influence biological processes can have an impact on phenotype. Therefore, knowing which processes respond to drugs that influence the phenotype will enable more effective and systematic study of the effect of drugs on phenotype. To the best of our knowledge, the relationship between biological processes and side effects of drugs has not yet been systematically researched. Methods We propose 3 steps for systematically searching relationships between drugs and biological processes: enrichment scores (ES) calculations, t-score calculation, and threshold-based filtering. Subsequently, the side effect-related biological processes are found by merging the drug-biological process network and the drug-side effect network. Evaluation is conducted in 2 ways: first, by discerning the number of biological processes discovered by our method that co-occur with Gene Ontology (GO) terms in relation to effects extracted from PubMed records using a text-mining technique and second, determining whether there is improvement in performance by limiting response processes by drugs sharing the same side effect to frequent ones alone. Results The multi-level network (the process-drug-side effect network) was built by merging the drug-biological process network and the drug-side effect network. We generated a network of 74 drugs- 168 side effects- 2209 biological process relation resources. The preliminary results showed that the process-drug-side effect network was able to find meaningful relationships between biological processes and side effects in an efficient manner. Conclusions We propose a novel process-drug-side effect network for discovering the relationship between biological processes and side effects. By exploring the relationship between drugs and phenotypes through a multi-level network, the mechanisms underlying the effect of specific drugs on the human body may be understood. </p...|$|E
