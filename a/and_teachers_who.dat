25|$|There {{was some}} minor return {{migration}} of Soviet Koreans to Korea {{in the first}} half of the 20th century.

Though it was common in most of the newly socialist countries of the Eastern Bloc to receive Soviet-educated personnel who were from the country or had ancestral ethnic connections there, in North Korea such returned members of national diaspora played a more important role than in other countries.|$|E

25|$|While the University vanished, new {{military}} {{science and engineering}} teaching schools flourished during the Revolution, as the revolutionary government sought to create a highly centralized and secular education system, centered in Paris. Some of the schools had been founded before the Revolution; the School of bridges and highways, France's first engineering school, was founded in 1747. The École Militaire was founded in 1750 to give an academic education to the sons of poor nobles; its most famous graduate was Napoleon Bonaparte in 1785; he completed the two-year course in just one year. The Ecole Polytechnique was founded in 1794, and became a military academy under Napoleon in 1804. The École Normale Supérieure was founded in 1794 to train teachers; it had some of France's best scientists on its faculty. These so-called Grandes écoles trained engineers <b>and</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>who</b> launched the French industrial revolution in the 19th century.|$|E
25|$|Chavous {{formally}} {{announced his}} campaign for mayor on February 10, 1998, and raised $117,000 {{in the first month}} of his campaign. Chavous trailed the other leading candidate in the race, Jack Evans, who raised more than $307,000 since early December 1997, as well as restaurateur Jeffrey Gildenhorn, who doanted $400,000 of his own money to his own campaign. More {{than a third of the}} campaign contributions to the Chavous campaign came from individuals living outside the District of Columbia. Chavous said in April 1998 that, if elected, he would focus heavily on education reform. He rejected school vouchers, but promised to fire principals <b>and</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>who</b> did not meet performance standards and create a boarding school for troubled youth. He also said he would disband the police oversight group established by the Financial Control Board, and work to revive commercial areas throughout the city. He later said he would cut a number of taxes levied by the city, including the corporate income tax, and seek passage of a federal law that would replace the current progressive federal income tax on city residents with a flat federal income tax of 15 percent. He also proposed universal early childhood education, and significantly improved city services for Latino residents. By mid-May, a Post poll showed 29 percent of voters favoring a sixth Barry term. Harold Brazil had 16 percent, Kevin Chavous had 15 percent, and Jack Evans had 10 percent. On May 21, Barry said he would not seek reelection. The announcement was a boost for Chavous, as polling showed that Barry's supporters were most likely to support him over other mayoral candidates.|$|E

[...] Most forms of TB are currently treatable with antibiotics, but drug-resistant strains are becoming more common. As a follow-up procedure, the school tested these students and teachers once again on February 13, 2008.|$|E

2500|$|While the Monroe County Intermediate School District works through {{numerous}} other schools, their main campus {{is located in}} Monroe Charter Township on South Raisinville Road just south of M-50 {{and down the street}} from Monroe County Community College. [...] The campus provides numerous educational services, though the only students who regularly attend school on the main campus are those with severe impairments who require specialized assistance. [...] The ISD also employs numerous staff <b>and</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>who</b> work in other schools. [...] These employees include special education teachers, special education aides, paraprofessional educators (such as speech and language pathologists and social workers), and substitute teachers. [...] While employed through the ISD, these workers may work in any of the schools in which the ISD provides services. [...] Many teachers and other employees throughout the county often meet at the ISD's main campus for conferencing and professional development. [...] The Monroe County Intermediate School District runs independently of other districts in the county, and the ISD itself receives its funding through the government. [...] The ISD consists of its own Board of Directors, led by superintendent Donald Spencer and assistant superintendents Nancy Swanson, Stephen McNew, Elizabeth Taylor, and Michelle Brahaney.|$|E

60|$|And {{he strode}} on {{with such a}} {{determined}} and deliberate gait, and was, besides, so well seconded by his scholars <b>and</b> <b>teachers,</b> <b>who</b> did exactly as he told them, neither running nor faltering, but marching with cool, solid impetus--the curates, too, being compelled to do the same, as they were between two fires, Helstone and Miss Keeldar, both of whom watched any deviation with lynx-eyed vigilance, and were ready, the one with his cane, the other with her parasol, to rebuke the slightest breach of orders, the least independent or irregular demonstration--that the body of Dissenters were first amazed, then alarmed, then borne down and pressed back, and at last forced to turn tail and leave the outlet from Royd Lane free. Boultby suffered in the onslaught, but Helstone and Malone, between them, held him up, and brought him through the business, whole in limb, though sorely tried in wind.|$|E
6000|$|Not only is {{the churchyard}} full, but the rectory garden is also thronged. Pairs and parties of ladies and gentlemen are seen walking amongst the waving lilacs and laburnums. The house also is occupied: at the wide-open parlour windows gay groups are standing. These are the patrons <b>and</b> <b>teachers,</b> <b>who</b> are to swell the procession. In the parson's croft, behind the rectory, are the musicians of the three parish bands, with their instruments. Fanny and Eliza, in the smartest of caps and gowns, and the whitest of aprons, move amongst them, serving out quarts of ale, whereof a stock was brewed very sound and strong some weeks since by the rector's orders, and under his special superintendence. Whatever he {{had a hand in}} must be managed handsomely. [...] "Shabby doings" [...] of any {{description}} were not endured under his sanction. From the erection of a public building, a church, school, or court-house, to the cooking of a dinner, he still advocated the lordly, liberal, and effective.

60|$|In {{the same}} manner, where a child {{three or four}} years old was in the habit, when allowed to go out by himself in the yard to play, of running off into the street, a very {{appropriate}} punishment would be to require him, {{for the remainder of the}} day, to stay in the house and keep in sight of his mother, on the ground that it was not safe to trust him by himself in the yard. This would be much better than sending him to bed an hour earlier, or subjecting him to any other inconvenience or privation having no obvious connection with the fault. For it is of the greatest importance to avoid, by every means, the exciting of feelings of irritation and resentment in the mind of the child, so far as it is possible to do this without impairing the efficiency of the punishment. It is not always possible to do this. The efficiency of the punishment is, of course, the essential thing; but parents <b>and</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>who</b> turn their attention to the point will find that it is much less difficult than one would suppose to secure this end completely without producing the too frequent accompaniments of punishment--anger, ill-temper, and ill-will.|$|E
