50|$|Rear-Admiral Sir Edward Fitzmaurice Inglefield, KBE (1861 - 1945) was a Victorian Royal Navy {{officer and}} later {{secretary}} of Lloyd's of London. He gave {{his name to}} the Inglefield clip, a device he patented in 1890 for quickly <b>attaching</b> signal <b>flags.</b>|$|R
25|$|Rural {{and some}} {{suburban}} areas of North America may utilize curbside mailboxes, {{also known as}} rural mailboxes. These receptacles generally consist of a large metal box mounted on a support designed primarily to receive large quantities of incoming mail, often with an <b>attached</b> <b>flag</b> to signal the presence of outgoing mail to the mail carrier. In the US and Canada, rural curbside mailboxes may be found grouped together at property boundaries or road/driveway intersections, depending upon conditions. Although the United States Postal Service (USPS) has general regulations stating the distance a letter box may be from the road surface, these requirements may be changed by the local postmaster according to local environment and road conditions.|$|R

50|$|Melita was {{commissioned}} into the Royal Navy on 27 October 1892, nearly {{ten years after}} she was laid down. During the 1890s she served in the Mediterranean, recommissioning in October 1895, and again in October 1898. While serving in Melita during this period Lieutenant (later Rear Admiral) Edward Inglefield invented the Inglefield clip for quickly <b>attaching</b> <b>flags</b> to each other - they are still in use in the Royal Navy today. In 1896 she served off the Sudanese coast, {{as part of the}} preparations for the reconquest of the Sudan. While under Commander Ian M. Fraser she was as special service vessel at Constantinople when in November 1901 she was ordered to Devonport, where she arrived in late December to be paid off 17 January 1902.|$|R

25|$|The general {{parts of}} a flag are: canton—the upper inner section of the flag; field or ground—the entire flag except the canton, and the field and hoist ends; fly end—the furthest edge from the hoist end; and hoist end—the edge used to <b>attach</b> the <b>flag</b> to the hoist.|$|R
50|$|There {{were also}} base blocks, step blocks and rails which {{were used in}} the {{foundations}} of the structures being constructed. The step blocks were also used {{in other parts of the}} structures. The pieces all tend to be fairly durable except for the columns, which tend to have sides broken off with many years of use. The roofing and floor bases were basic thin plastic sheets with a checker board motif in white and brown to one side and blank white on the other. The column segments interlocked to form stacks. Each such stack would present four tracks running the length of the stack. The vertical panel pieces had edges that could slide into the tracks. Panels slid into adjacent tracks in the same column would be at right-angles to each other. The floor/roof panels had corners cut in such a way that each corner could be held in place between two column segments. Also included were <b>flag</b> poles to <b>attach</b> <b>flags</b> to, flags were found (printed) on the back page of the instruction booklet to the sets. Attachment was cutting them and folding them then simply pasting them to the poles.|$|R

50|$|However, {{according}} to Khaldei himself, {{when he arrived}} at the Reichstag, he simply asked the soldiers who happened to be passing by to help with the staging of the photoshoot; there were only four of them, including Khaldei, on the roof: the one who was <b>attaching</b> the <b>flag</b> was 18-year-old Private Alexei Kovalyov from Kiev, the two others were Abdulkhakim Ismailov from Dagestan and Leonid Gorychev (also mentioned as Aleksei Goryachev) from Minsk.|$|R

60|$|This {{was an easy}} matter, for {{directly}} in front of the camp, on the lake front, grew a tall and slender sapling. From this they cut the extreme top and the branches, and then ran up a thin rope, to which they <b>attached</b> the <b>flag.</b> Floating in the breeze it looked very pretty, and taking off their caps, the members of the Gun Club saluted the national emblem. Then Whopper and Shep began to whistle the Star Spangled Banner and the others joined in.|$|R
40|$|Using an Al-foil of {{thickness}} ≈ 18 μm {{as a substrate}} and electrode, a piezoelectric nanogenerator (NG) that is super-flexible {{in responding}} to the wavy motion of a very light wind is fabricated using ZnO nanowire arrays. The NG is used to harvest the energy from a waving flag, demonstrating its high flexibility and excellent conformability to be integrated into fabric. The NG is applied to detect the wrinkling of a human face, showing its capability to serve as an active deformation sensor that needs no extra power supply. This strategy may provide a highly promising platform as energy harvesting devices and self-powered sensors for practical use wherever movement is available. A super-flexible and conformable piezoelectric nanogenerator (NG) based on cost-effective Al foil is invented. The super-flexible NG can generate output power in light air and serve as an energy harvesting device under the waving motion of an <b>attached</b> <b>flag</b> due to its excellent conformability. The NGs show potential applications as active sensors that are capable of detecting slight skin movement due to their extremely low resistance to motion. This is a highly promising platform to produce energy harvesting devices and self-powered sensors. Copyright © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH and Co. KGaA, Weinheim...|$|R

5000|$|The weapon is, basically, a spear with a <b>flag</b> <b>attached</b> to the pole. The gichang is {{also called}} danchang (단창), which means 'short spear'. It would {{typically}} be around 2.75 metres long. The blade measured about 23 centimetres in length. These spears were generally used for ceremonial or escort purposes.|$|R
40|$|High {{temperature}} stress reduces grain growth in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) by altering source activity and sink capacity. The impact of stress on source and sink interactions in two wheat cultivars of differing source thermotolerance was monitored by analysis of chlorophyll fluorescence transients, Fv (variable fluorescence) and PSM (peak, stationary, maximum), of <b>attached</b> <b>flag</b> leaves on intact and decapitated tillers grown at optimum (20 °C) and stress (35 °C) temperatures after anthesis. The thermotolerant cultivar Waverly had reduced Fv and PS quenching {{and a large}} increase of SM during heat stress. The less thermotolerant cultivar, Len, exhibited increased Fv and PS quenching and a small increase of SM. Fluorescence induction was similar in intact and decapitated tillers of Len, indicating diminished sinksource interaction during heat stress. The present results and previous observations of photosynthetic activities indicate that cyclic electron transport and photophosphorylation in flag leaves of the thermotolerant cultivar were stimulated by sink demand (increased SM in intact plants). Reduced grain development in the thermolabile cultivar resulted from limited capacity to support cyclic electron transport and photophosphorylation (slight increase in SM of intact plants and large reduction of Cytochrome f/b 6 -mediated electron transport capacity). It was concluded that heat stress injures the photosynthetic apparatus during reproductive growth of wheat and that diminished source activity and sink capacity may be equally important in reducing productivity...|$|R

50|$|Once on top, Strank ordered Hayes and Sousley {{to find a}} {{steel pipe}} to <b>attach</b> the {{replacement}} <b>flag</b> unto. After a Japanese iron pipe was found and the <b>flag</b> <b>attached</b> to it, Strank, Block (Block was misidentified as Sgt. Hansen, until January 1947), Hayes, and Sousley assisted by Gagnon and Pfc. Harold Schultz (on June 23, 2016, the Marine Corps announced that Navy Corpsman John Bradley was not in Rosenthal's photo and Schultz was) raised the replacement flag at approximately 1 PM as the first flagstaff was lowered under Lt. Schrier's orders. Strank had called to Gagnon and Schultz to help raise the heavy flagstaff. Once raised, the flagstaff was secured by rocks, and rope tied to it in three places (Bradley assisted some Marines in this) and staked into the ground due to the very high winds on Mount Suribachi.|$|R
