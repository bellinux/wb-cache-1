30|$|The laser {{detector}} head (Fig.  1 a) was attached on an <b>adjustable</b> <b>support,</b> fixed on a stable tripod, and placed ~ 465  mm behind the CW limit switch of the SRM system. The laser beam reflector (Fig.  1 b) was {{mounted on a}} small <b>adjustable</b> <b>support</b> and firmly attached to the sample tray using double-sided tape. Laser beam generated from the laser encoder unit is transmitted through a laser fiber to the {{laser detector}} unit. It was then emitted from the laser detector passing through SRM and reflected with the laser beam reflector attached to the sample tray. The reflected laser beam was received with the detector head, which {{was used for the}} interference measurements together with the source laser beam. Approximate distance between the laser detector head and the laser beam reflector when the tray is at the home position was measured as ~ 3895  mm.|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} backward <b>adjustable</b> thoracic <b>support</b> on spinal curvature and back muscle activation during wheelchair sitting. Methods: Twenty elderly people were recruited for this study. The backward <b>adjustable</b> thoracic <b>support</b> sitting posture was compared with the slumped, normal, and lumbar support sitting postures. Spinal curvatures (pelvic, lumbar, and thoracic angles) and muscle activations of 4 back muscles on both sides (maximal voluntary isometric contraction of the lumbar multifidus, lumbar erector spinae, iliocostalis lumborum pars thoracis, and thoracic erector spinae at T 9) were measured and compared between the different sitting postures using {{one-way analysis of variance}} with repeated measures. Results: The backward <b>adjustable</b> thoracic <b>support</b> sitting posture showed a relatively neutral pelvic tilt (20. 32 ¡ 4. 80) ̊ when compared with the slumped (22. 84 ¡ 5. 27) ̊ and lumbar support (28. 97 ¡ 3. 31) ̊ sitting postures (P, 0. 001), and showed relatively higher lumbar lordosis (223. 38 ¡ 6. 50) ̊ when compared with th...|$|R

A computer model can then verify and improve against both the reaction forces and the measured deformation and the support of the ship can be continuously adjusted and optimised according {{to the needs of the}} ship.

The backward <b>adjustable</b> thoracic <b>support</b> sitting posture showed a relatively neutral pelvic tilt (- 0. 32 ± 4. 80 °) when compared with the slumped (22. 84 ± 5. 27 °) and lumbar support (- 8. 97 ± 3. 31 °) sitting postures (P< 0. 001), and showed relatively higher lumbar lordosis (- 23. 38 ± 6. 50 °) when compared with the slumped (14. 77 ± 7. 83 °), normal (0. 44 ± 7. 47 °), and lumbar support (- 16. 76 ± 4. 77 °) sitting postures (P< 0. 05). It also showed relatively lower back muscle activity when compared with the normal and lumbar support sitting postures (P< 0. 05). The backward <b>adjustable</b> thoracic <b>support</b> sitting concept was suggested because it maintains a more neutral pelvic tilt, higher lumbar lordosis, and lower back muscle activation, which may help maintain a better sitting posture and reduce the risk of back pain...|$|R

50|$|All {{support systems}} {{have to be}} height {{adjustable}} to allow the formwork to be placed at the correct height and to be removed after the concrete is cured. Normally adjustable metal props similar to (or the same as) those used by beam slab formwork are used to support these systems. Some systems combine stringers and supports into steel or aluminum trusses. Yet other systems use metal frame shoring towers, which the decks are attached to. Another common method is to attach the formwork decks to previously cast walls or columns,thus eradicating the use of vertical props altogether. In this method, <b>adjustable</b> <b>support</b> shoes are bolted through holes (sometimes tie holes) or attached to cast anchors.|$|R

The final adjustments were made with the software by maximizing output signal of the interferometry.

Environmental corrections were conducted for all measurements with temperature of 23.5  °C, humidity of 40  %, and atmospheric pressure of 101.45  kPa. Static measurements without motion of the tray show {{a standard deviation of}} 0.7  µm, possibly due to background mechanical vibrations and variability of environmental parameters.|$|R

40|$|As an {{alternative}} to the classical waveguides, such as the H-waveguide and the rectangular waveguide, the groove waveguide has been used at millimetre wavelengths {{for the last couple of}} decades. Most of these properties are attributed to the open sides of the guide, which reduce the wall losses. This article describes a semisymmetrical groove guide resonator that is designed and analyzed analytically, numerically, and experimentally. The numerical simulations are performed via a powerful time-domain simulator based on the finite-difference, time-domain (FDTD) method. Both Cartesian- and cylindrical-coordinate FDTD packages are developed and used for the simulations. The purpose in using cylindrical-coordinate FDTD is to calibrate Cartesian-coordinate FDTD and to see the error introduced due to discretization.

40|$|Embodiments of {{the present}} {{invention}} are directed to a simple apparatus and a convenient and accurate method of mounting the components to form an off-axis reflective optical apparatus such as a collimator. In one embodiment, an off-axis reflective optical apparatus comprises a mounting block having a ferrule <b>holder</b> <b>support</b> surface and an off-axis reflector support surface which is generally perpendicular to the ferrule <b>holder</b> <b>support</b> surface. An optical reflector is mounted on the off-axis reflector support surface and has a reflected beam centerline. The optical reflector has a conic reflective surface and a conic center. A ferrule holder is mounted on the ferrule <b>holder</b> <b>support</b> surface. The ferrule holder provides a ferrule for coupling to an optical fiber and orienting a fiber tip of the optical fiber along a fiber axis toward the optical reflector. The fiber axis is nonparallel to the reflected beam centerline. Prior to mounting the optical reflector to the off-axis reflector support surface and prior to mounting the ferrule holder to the ferrule <b>holder</b> <b>support</b> surface, the optical reflector is movable on the off-axis reflector surface and the ferrule holder is movable on the ferrule <b>holder</b> <b>support</b> surface to align the conic center of the optical reflector {{with respect to the}} fiber tip of the optical fiber, and the apparatus has {{at least one of the}} following features: (1) the optical reflector is movable on the off-axis reflector support surface to adjust a focus of the fiber tip with respect to the optical reflector, and (2) the ferrule holder is movable on the ferrule <b>holder</b> <b>support</b> surface to adjust the focus of the fiber tip with respect to the optical reflector...|$|R

Here, a novel symmetry-breaking closed-loop control is employed during the iterative damage identification process to enrich the data set by removing the Eigen degeneracy of the symmetric shaft structure. This approach enables full damage identification from a single sensor and hence without requiring measured modeshape information. The dynamical model of system is built based on the Lagrange principle and the assumed mode method while the crack model is based on fracture mechanics.

40|$|Abstract. Tracked mobile robots with <b>adjustable</b> <b>support</b> tracks or {{flippers}} {{are popular}} promising solutions for negotiating rough terrain and 3 D obstacles. Though many according robot bases are in principle physically capable of climbing stairs, it is a non-trivial control-task for a remote tele-operator, {{especially when the}} user can not directly see the robot like in search and rescue scenarios. To limit training requirements and to ease the cognitive load on operators, respectively to enable fully autonomous rescue robots, we developed a fuzzy controller for this task, which adjusts the drive forces and the posture of the flipper. The design of the controller is guided by observing the strategies of a trained user when tele-operating a robot with unlimited visual information. In doing so, an Open Dynamics Engine (ODE) simulation of our robot is used where the full set of all physical parameters is accessible for analysis. Based on this data, it is shown in several experiments that the controller is not only capable of climbing stairs but that it does so in a more efficient manner than the human user who served as training model. ...|$|R
