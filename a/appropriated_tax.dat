40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{external}} effects {{that arise in}} the decisions of firms on polluting emissions and in the decisions of parents {{on the number of}} births in an optimal control model with three stock variables representing population, economic capital, and pollution. We distinguish two different types of households, which represent opposite ends of a spectrum of potential familial structures: ‘dynastic households’, in which the family sticks together forever and ‘micro-households’, in which children leave their parent's household immediately after birth. We show that the decision of parents on the number of births involves an externality that is qualitatively different for both types of familial structure. Hence, population policy should be different, according to the type of household. A first best result may be obtained in the case of dynastic households if an <b>appropriate</b> <b>tax</b> on the household size is applied, or, in the case of micro-households, if an <b>appropriate</b> <b>tax</b> on children is applied. ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{argues that}} {{multinational}} banks have characteristics which are unique and distinguishable from traditional multinational entities. The first distinguishing {{feature is the}} unique nature of the services and consequent products supplied by multinational banks, which are aimed at meeting client global demand. The second distinguishing feature is the non-traditional organisational structure that is adopted. This structure, also designed to meet client global demand, introduces issues previously not recognised in the traditional taxation system, which is designed for the structure of traditional multinational entities. The unique differences between traditional multinational entities and multinational banks means there may be {{the need for a}} distinct international tax regime. It is argued that there are “outmoded economic assumptions” upon which the present tax laws relating to multinational banks are based. An examination of the unique nature of multinational banks leads {{to the conclusion that the}} <b>appropriate</b> <b>tax</b> treatment of these banks is different from the <b>appropriate</b> <b>tax</b> treatment of multinational entities generally...|$|R

40|$|Strengthening the {{protection}} measures of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) {{in compliance with}} the TRIPS agreement creates a need for an <b>appropriate</b> <b>tax</b> treatment of IPR by developing countries. This need is important to stimulate locally developed IPR and protect the tax revenue arising from IPR transactions. This book examines the tax treatment of IPR in Egypt and India with refernce to pharmaceutical industry. The book employs a mixed research approach consisting of legal reasoning and economic analysis. The book identifies the role of withholding tax and transfer pricing measures in protecting the tax base related to IPR. These work as integrity measures which reinforce the role of tax incentives to stimulate locally developed IPR. The book draws the attention of academics, policymakers, and professioanls towards the important areas for developing <b>appropriate</b> <b>tax</b> treatment of IPR transactions. These areas include (1) tax incentives are necessary to encourage locally developed IPR, (2) a broad definition of royalty and stable international tax policy, (3) proper transfer pricing measures for IPR, and (4) adequate administrative measures to enhance procedural simplicity...|$|R
50|$|There is {{no federal}} sales or use tax in the United States. All but five states impose sales and use taxes on retail sale, lease and rental of many goods, {{as well as}} some services. Many cities, counties, transit {{authorities}} and special purpose districts impose an additional local sales or use tax. Sales and use tax is calculated as the purchase price times the <b>appropriate</b> <b>tax</b> rate. Tax rates vary widely by jurisdiction from less than 1% to over 10%. Sales tax is collected by the seller at the time of sale. Use tax is self assessed by a buyer who has not paid sales tax on a taxable purchase.|$|R

40|$|The {{theory of}} optimal {{taxation}} has, for the pas two decades, been the reigning normative approach of taxation. This paper argues that, {{in its current}} state, optimal tax theory is incomplete {{as a guide to}} action concerning many critical issues in tax policy. It is incomplete because it has not yet come to terms with taxation as a system of coercively collecting revenues from individuals who will tend to resist. The coercive nature of collection taxes implies that the resource cost of implementing a tax system have been {{and will continue to be}} a critical determinant of <b>appropriate</b> <b>tax</b> policy. The paper first presents the three cornerstone propositions of optimal tax theory, and then it discusses the influence of these propositions on recent tax policy developments. It concludes by sketching an alternative to optimal taxation, called the theory of optimal tax systems, which embraces the insights of optimal taxation but also considers the technology of raising taxes and the constraints placed upon tax policy by that technology. The optimal tax systems perspective is shown to shed light on the choice of tax instruments, the problem of tax evasion, and the <b>appropriate</b> <b>tax</b> treatment of capital income. ...|$|R
