I think I was controlling the fight with my distance. Sometimes I need {{to put a little}} flavor into the ring. My promoter always says that I make the fights very difficult, but they're not difficult, they're fun for the public. I decided to stop myself in front of him in the twelfth round because I wanted to give the public what they deserve. It was a great round. I'm very happy about it." ...|$|E

30|$|Analogous to {{scattered}} islands that form a single archipelago, {{the network of}} distributed hedonic hotspots forms a functional integrated circuit, which obeys control rules that are largely hierarchical and organized into brain levels (Aldridge et al. 1993; Berridge and Fentress 1986; Grill and Norgren 1978; Peciña et al. 2006). At the highest levels, the hotspot network may function as a more democratic heterarchy, in which unanimity of positive votes across hotspots is {{required in order to}} generate <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>pleasure.</b> For example, any successful enhancement that starts in one hotspot involves recruiting neuronal activation across other hotspots simultaneously, to create a network of several that all vote 'yes' together for more pleasure (Smith et al. 2011). Conversely, a pleasure enhancement initiated by opioid activation of one hotspot can be vetoed by an opposite vote of 'no' from another hotspot where opioid signals are suppressed. Such findings reveal the need for unanimity across hotspots in order for <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>pleasure</b> to be produced, and the potential fragility of hedonic enhancement if any hotspot defects (Smith and Berridge 2007; Smith et al. 2010).|$|R

40|$|Research and anecdotal {{evidence}} suggests that shopping is an important experience for tourists. In this context, the experience activities themselves may {{become part of the}} tourist's experience influencing impulse buying behaviors. Based on a sample of 323 Chinese domestic tourists, this research investigates how experience activities influence tourist impulse buying. The results indicate that customer participation can lead to <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>pleasure</b> experience that produces the strongest impact on impulse buying. Meanwhile, to a lesser extent, customer learning and customer entertainment can also lead to <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> domination response, which can exert <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> influence on impulse buying.
