40|$|Confianza {{is a small}} {{regulated}} microfinance {{institution in}} central Peru that today provides agricultural loans alongside a range of rural, urban, small business, housing, and consumer loans to low-income clients. From its beginnings as an Inter-American Development Bank-funded NGO program in 1993 until becoming a regulated microfinance provider in 1999, Confianza’s loan portfolio was almost exclusively devoted to solidarity group loans for agricultural purposes. When a combination of factors, including plunging commodity prices, led to an <b>arrears</b> <b>rate</b> of over 50 percent in 1999, Confianza was forced to make a set of swift, substantial changes in order to survive: The MFI altered its lending methodology, instituted stricter lending requirements and monitoring, and added urban and individual loans to diversify its portfolio. Its non-agricultural port-folio flourished, and Confianza also maintained a focus on agricultural lending (about {{a quarter of its}} total portfolio), with lending to agriculture almost quadrupling in volume over the next few years. By year-end 2002, Confianza had become financially sustainable, lending more than $ 4 million annually, with a respectable <b>arrears</b> <b>rate</b> (portfolio at risk> 30 days) of less than 4 percent and a 19 percent adjusted return on equity. Notably, its agricultural <b>arrears</b> <b>rate</b> has remained consistently lower than that of the portfolio as a whole...|$|E

40|$|This report {{examines}} {{home loan}} lending practices and the processes used {{to deal with}} people in financial difficulty. The committee’s key recommendation is that the federal government takes over the regulation of credit from the states and territories. This includes the regulation of mortgage brokers and non-bank lenders. The committee also examined the evolution of the Australian lending market, including the change to lending standards and the proliferation of non-bank lenders. Generally speaking, credit has become more readily available, reflecting the ongoing strength of the domestic and international economies. Mortgage <b>arrears</b> <b>rates</b> have increased in recent times, but remain very low by historical and international standards, suggesting that the majority of housing credit is being provided responsibly. The committee also recommends that the Australian Bureau of Statistics begin collecting data on housing repossessions; and that the Banking and Financial Services Ombudsman increase its scheme limit to $ 500, 000...|$|R
50|$|Any rates {{not paid}} by the due date {{may be subject to}} a {{surcharge}} of 5%. If rates are still unpaid after 6 months from the date when they were deemed to be in default, a further surcharge of 10% on the total amount outstanding may be added. Before taking any legal action to recover <b>arrears</b> of <b>rates,</b> a warning letter will be issued to the defaulter to demand immediate payment. Legal action for recovery of rates is taken in the Small Claims Tribunal if the amount of <b>rates</b> <b>arrears</b> does not exceed $50,000 or in the District Court if the arrears exceed $50,000. If the outstanding rates remain unsettled after the court’s judgment, the Commissioner may, as a last resort, enter a charge against the property to prohibit it from changing hands until the charge is released.|$|R
40|$|How {{complete}} and how comparable are data on non-financial corporates, household sector balance sheets, and housing markets across countries? Notes for a presentation to IMF-FSB Users Conference on Data Gaps, 8 – 9 July 2009 Luci Ellis, Head of Financial Stability Department, Reserve Bank of Australia The current crisis provides {{the context for}} new {{thinking about how to}} measure vulnerabilities in the non-financial sectors that might feed back onto the financial system. Unlike previous banking crises in industrialised countries, this one was triggered by a household sector and its home mortgage obligations. Normally, imbalances build up in the business sector, for example in commercial property markets or leveraged buyouts. The household sector reacts much later: mortgage <b>arrears</b> <b>rates</b> typically only start to rise (and housing prices fall) significantly once a recession is underway and unemployment is rising rapidly. That is the reverse of the pattern seen in the current US housing crash. The rise in US mortgage arrears has also been unusually severe relative to labour market developments and to past US experience. These contrasts raise the questions of why the United States was different this time, and whether any data existed that would have signalled this unusual vulnerability...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{valuation of}} derivatives with payoff {{defined as a}} nonlinear though close to linear function of tradable underlying assets. Interest rate derivatives involving Libor or swap <b>rates</b> in <b>arrears,</b> i. e. <b>rates</b> paid at wrong time, are a typical example. It is generally tempting to replace the future unknown interest rates with the forward rates. We show rigorously that indeed this is not possible {{in the case of}} Libor or swap <b>rates</b> in <b>arrears.</b> We introduce formally the notion of linear plain vanilla derivatives as those that can be replicated by a finite set of elementary operations and show that derivatives involving the <b>rates</b> in <b>arrears</b> are not (linear) plain vanilla. We also study the issue of valuation of such derivatives. Beside the popular convexity adjustment formula, we develop an improved two or more variable adjustment formula applicable in particular on swap <b>rates</b> in <b>arrears.</b> Finally, we get a precise fully analytical formula based on the usual assumption of log-normality of the relevant tradable underlying assets applicable to a wide class of convexity related derivatives.

His body was brought to England with the ceremony due to his rank, and buried in the chapel of Dover Castle. His widow petitioned the king for a pension, and for the payment of about £1,400 due to her husband {{at the time of his}} death, representing herself as destitute.

50|$|Shortly {{after his}} appointment, a ruling by Bland displeased {{a party to}} the suit, who persuaded the Maryland House of Delegates to attempt to abolish the office of Chancellor, and failing that, to {{eliminate}} the salary for the position. The Maryland Senate rejected initial efforts to reduce the Chancellor's salary from $3,400 to $2,200 or $2,500, but eventually passed a House bill that made no provision for the salary, in order to avoid a fiscal crisis. In the next session of the legislature, Bland presented a memorandum arguing that the actions of the legislature threatened the independence of the judiciary. This appeal succeeded, and the legislature thereafter passed a bill to permanently fix the salary of the Chancellor at the sum of $3,400, and to pay Bland in <b>arrears</b> at that <b>rate.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{housing market}} has {{experienced}} persistent 'boom and bust' cycles {{for the past}} 40 years. These cycles distort housing choices and increase risk. They drive mortgage <b>arrears</b> and repossession <b>rates,</b> curtail housebuilding capacity and increase intergenerational inequality. Yet policy-makers {{have done little to}} tackle the problem. This report contains the conclusions of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation's Housing Market Taskforce. It argues that urgent action is needed now before another boom and bust cycle takes hold. The report examines: * how improving housing supply can limit volatility in the long run; * how using credit controls and reforming taxation could limit volatility in the short run; * how promoting financial capability among borrowers and responsible lending could be combined with an improved safety net to limit mortgage arrears and repossessions; * the possibilities for developing alternatives to home-ownership. </p...|$|R
30|$|France is {{the most}} {{prominent}} case of state-guided coordination (Crouch 1993; Culpepper 2006). The Salaire Minimum Interprofessionelle Garantie (SMIC) {{was and still is}} a central instrument in shoring up France’s entire wage structure. Setting its level became highly politicized, playing big in presidential elections. State guidance through setting the minimum wage or awards is primordial in France, Australia, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Turkey, Israel and, since 2010, in Greece and Portugal. During the recession government control over minimum wage setting has increased through the removal of the social partners from decision making over minimum wage levels (Greece, Hungary, Spain, Latvia), or by freezing (Ireland, Portugal, Latvia, Lithuania, Czech Republic), (partially) de-indexing (Belgium, Luxembourg) or lowering (Greece) the statutory minimum wage. Minimum wage setting by the government may have a big knock-on effect on private sector wage bargaining, especially where there is a large low wage sector and where wage bargaining institutions are weak or have weakened, as indicated by low and declining coverage <b>rates,</b> <b>arrears</b> in the renewal of agreements, and arrears in pay.|$|R
40|$|Using {{data from}} several sources, {{we show that}} {{households}} nearing retirement have lower rates of housing distress than younger households, as measured by <b>arrears</b> and foreclosure <b>rates.</b> However, {{almost all of the}} housing wealth gains observed for cohorts aged 51 - 56 between 1992 and 2004 were erased by 2010, while their mortgages have grown throughout. As a consequence, their loan-to-value ratios are considerably higher, though the percentage paying more than 30 percent of their household income toward their mortgage remains flat. Worrisomely, their financial wealth also declined between 2004 and 2010. Declines in house prices will adversely affect households that need to liquidate housing wealth, and rising mortgage obligations will increase pressure on retirement resources. We develop an econometric model to show factors associated with housing distress and then use the results to forecast housing distress among older households through 2012. We project that the risk of arrears will increase to 3. 4 percent in 2010 and 4. 4 percent by 2012. We also find that 6. 7 percent of HRS households have children or other relatives who are facing housing distress, potentially putting further pressure on their retirement preparedness. ...|$|R

40|$|Russia {{dramatically}} {{reduced its}} {{higher rates of}} personal income tax (PIT) in 2001 establishing a single marginal rate at {{the low level of}} 13 percent. In the following year, real revenue from the PIT actually increased by about 26 percent. This ''flat tax'' experience has attracted much attention (and emulation) among policymakers, making it perhaps the most important tax reform of recent years. But it has been little studied. This paper asks whether the strong revenue performance of the PIT was itself a consequence of this reform, using both macro evidence and, in particular, micro-level data on the experiences of individuals and households affected by the reform to varying degrees. It concludes that {{there is no evidence of}} a strong supply side effect of the reform. Compliance, however, did improve quite substantially-by about one third according to our estimates-though it remains unclear whether this was due to the parametric reforms or to accompanying changes in enforcement.
