40|$|Five solid {{membrane}} sensors {{responsive to}} memantine hydrochloride (MEM) and pramipexole dihydrochloride monohydrate (PXL) are described for simple and fast determination {{of these drugs}} in pharmaceutical preparation and human plasma. The first and the second sensors {{are based on the}} formation of an ion association complex between MEM as a cationic drug with Na tetra phenyl borate and <b>ammonium</b> <b>reineckate</b> (as anionic exchanger), respectively. The third sensor is based on the formation of an ion association complex between PXL with <b>ammonium</b> <b>reineckate.</b> The produced electroactive material is dispersed in PVC matrix. While the other fourth and fifth sensors are based on using functionalized lipophilic cyclodextrin derivative (2 -hydroxypropyl-&# 946;-cyclodextrin) as sensor ionophore for the determination of MEM and PXL. The performance characteristics of these sensors-evaluated according to IUPAC recommendations-reveal fast, stable and near Nernstian response for 1 D 7 10 - 4 - 1 D 7 10 - 1 M and 1 D 7 10 - 6 - 1 D 7 10 - 2 M for (MEM) and (PXL), respectively. Many inorganic and organic substances such as drug excipients and diluents normally used in drug formulations do not interfere with drugs response. Statistical comparison between the results obtained by applying the proposed potentiometric method for the determination of the (MEM) and (PXL) in their pure powder forms and those obtained by applying the reported methods was done and no significant difference was found at p = 0. 05.

40|$|The present paper {{describes}} {{elementary analysis}} for biological materials {{by using a}} wave dispersive type X. M. A. (X-ray microanalyzer). The wave dispersive analysis has been considered to be unadequate for analyzing the elements of biological materials because analytical specimens generally lack any specialized elements incorporated in the materials, and {{also tend to be}} damaged and charged at higher accelerating voltage. To overcome these defficulties, the specimens were treated with a reagent which reacted with the materials to be analyzed and then coated with carbon by means of vacuum evaporation. Thus, berberine could be analyzed accurately with the wave dispersive X. M. A. after reacting with <b>ammonium</b> <b>reineckate</b> to give a berberine -Cr- complex, followed by coating with carbon.

40|$|Human urine is osmoprotective for enteric bacteria, {{permitting}} E. coli to {{grow with}} {{high concentrations of}} NaCl and other salts and even higher concentrations of sucrose and mannitol but not urea. The active material in urine is soluble in methanol and is precipitated by <b>ammonium</b> <b>reineckate</b> at acid pH. Using gel filtration and high-pressure liquid chromatography, we have identified two major osmoprotective compounds in urine.

Proline betaine has not been described previously to our knowledge in vertebrate tissues. It {{is known to be}} a cell volume-regulating agent for marine red algae and the euryhaline mollusk Elysia chloritica.

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityOver {{the past}} ten to fifteen years much {{work has been done}} on {{oxidation}} and reduction reactions of coordination complexes in aqueous solution. Relatively little attention has been devoted, however, to the study of reactions in which ligands of these complexes are oxidized or reduced. In the present work an investigation was carried out on the bromine oxidation of the isothiocyanatopentamiminechromium(III) ion and of tetraisothiocyanatodiamminechromate(III) ion. 		Werner (16) studied the bromine oxidation of <b>ammonium</b> <b>reineckate,</b> and after extensive treatment of the reaction solution isolated the green salt [Cr(NH 3) 2 (Br) 2 (H 2 O) 2]Br. In the present study, an attempt was made to establish the stoichiometry of the bromine oxidations of the Reineckate ion and the [Cr(NH 3) 5 NCS]+ 2 ion. Work was done on the identification of the oxidation products and on correlation of these products with the observed stoichiometry. The oxidation of the Reineckate ion was carried out in both buffered solution, at a pH of 4. 5 - 5, and acidic solution, with a pH of 1 - 2, in order to note any difference in the measured stoichiometries with the change in acidity. Measurements were also made to determine if dissociation of the complex preceded the initial oxidation step. 		[Cr(NH 3) 5 NCS](ClO 4) 2 was prepared from [Cr(NH 3) 5 Cl] by a procedure based on the method of Adamson and Wilkins (3). The [Cr(NH 3) 5 Cl]Cl 2 was prepared by the reduction of chromic ion to chromous ion by zinc in the presence of acid. The chromous ion by zinc in the presence of acid. The chromous ion was then oxidized by air in the presence of ammonium chloride in aqueous ammonia. This solution was treated with hot hydrochloric acid to obtain the internediate [Cr(NH 3) 5 Cl]Cl 2. 		The following procedure was used to determine the rate of consumption of bromine and extablish the stoichiometry of the reactant species. Definite volumes of solution containing complex ion and hydrochloric acid or acetate buffer were placed in one flask, and the same volumes of blank solution containing hydrochloric acid or buffer, but no complex, wwere placed in another flask. A certain volume of aqueous bromine was added to each flask, and after a certain selected time, the remaining bromine was quenched with protassium iodide. The liberated iodine was titrated with standard sodium thiosulfate solution using starch as an indicator. The stoichiometries (the moles of bromine consumed per mole of complex ion) were determined using this same method. The chromium content of each solution of complex was determined by destroying the complex in hot alkali, oxidizing the chromite ion solution to chromate ion by hot hydrogen peroxide, and measuring the absorbance of the resulting chromate solution at a wave length of 372 millimicrons. 		From the measurements made on the bromine oxidation of Reineckate ion, it appears that there is an initial rapid reaction followed by a slower consumption of bromine. 		From the available data concerning the oxidation of [Cr(NH 3) 5 NCS]+ 2, there also appears to be an initial rapid consumption of bromine. Measurements did not indicate a slower consumption of bromine. 		Allowing the buffered oxidation of Reineckate ion by bromine to take place for 10 minutes, at a pH of 4. 5 - 5, the observed stoichiometry was 14. 2 moles of bromine per mole of Reineckate ion. In acidic solution, at a pH of 1 - 2, the apparent stoichiometry of the Reineckate ion oxidation was 14. 0 moles of bromine per mole of Reineckate ion. 		The stoichiometry of the [Cr(NH 3) 5 NCS]+ 2 ion oxidation, allowing the reaction to take place for 15 minutes, was 3. 2 moles of bromine consumed per mole of complex ion. 		Sulfate ion and nitrate ion were both identified as products of the Reineckate ion oxidation. The cyanide ion and the ammonium ion were not detected and are thus ruled out as possible oxidation products. No suitable test was devised for the identification of carbon dioxide. 		More work should be done on the study of the slower secondary oxidation by bromine of Reineckate ion. The bromine oxidation of [Cr(NH 3) 5 NCS]+ 2 should be investigated in more detail and perhaps a comparison of the oxidation rates of it and the Reineckate ion could be made where possible. A reaction apparatus should be designed which would trap any gaseous oxidation products formed and a correlation could be made between the reaction products formed during each reaction interval and the observed stoichiometries...|$|E
