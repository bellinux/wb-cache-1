5|$|Nabulsi soap or sabon nabulsi {{is a type}} of castile soap {{produced}} only in Nablus <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> three primary ingredients: virgin olive oil, water, and a sodium compound. Since the 10th century, Nabulsi soap has enjoyed a reputation for being a fine product, and has been exported across the Arab world and to Europe. Though the number of soap factories decreased from a peak of thirty in the 19th century to only two today, efforts to preserve this important part of Palestinian and Nabulsi cultural heritage continue.|$|E
5|$|Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow) and Monica (Courteney Cox) {{organize}} a surprise party for Rachel one month {{ahead of her}} birthday, but Monica's insistence to take responsibility over everything leaves Phoebe with cup and ice duties. However Phoebe vows {{to get back at}} Monica. At the party, the apartment is overflowing with decorations <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> cups, and everyone is enjoying the snow cones Phoebe has made with the ice, meaning all of Monica's food is ignored. Rachel arrives home and is very surprised to find the party, given that Chandler's (Matthew Perry) birthday is before hers.|$|E
5|$|Rodmarton Manor is {{a country}} house built between 1909 and 1929, built from local materials, worked by local craftsmen. It was built as three wings, viewed in plan as three sides of an octagon, around a large {{circular}} courtyard, covered in grass {{which is designed to}} be reminiscent of a village green. The majority of the building is two storeys high <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> coursed cut stone, the plinth is offset and the quoins are flush. The roof is made of stone slate, with grouped chimneystacks.|$|E

5|$|Skis are lighter, {{narrower}} {{and designed}} to be faster than those used in recreational cross-country skiing <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> composite materials. For classic events, typical ski lengths are between 195 and 210 centimetres, while ski lengths for skating are 170 to 200cm. Skis for skating are also more rigid than skis for classical. Skis are waxed for speed and, {{in the case of}} classic skis, traction when striding forward. Racing ski boots are also lighter than recreational ones and are attached at the toe only to bindings that are specialized for classic or skate skiing.|$|E
5|$|The Cat's Eye was {{the first}} {{planetary}} nebula to be observed with a spectroscope by William Huggins on August 29, 1864. Huggins' observations revealed that the nebula's spectrum was non-continuous <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> a few bright emission lines, first indication that planetary nebulae consist of tenuous ionised gas. Spectroscopic observations at these wavelengths are used in abundance determinations, while images at these wavelengths {{have been used to}} reveal the intricate structure of the nebula.|$|E
5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} L.incarnatum are tiny, oval to roughly spherical, and measure 35–1250 by 200–450μm. The {{floating}} balls are sometimes enclosed {{in a loose}} subiculum, with a whitish surface that is byssoid (consisting of fine threads). The peridium (the outer protective tissue layer) is 18–30μm thick, byssoid, <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> clamped hyphae typically 2.5–4μm in diameter intertwined with dendrophyses (irregularly branched cystidia) 1μm in diameter. The surface of the peridium is hydrophobic, a feature that helps keep water off the growing hymenium during its development, and gives the fruit body buoyancy.|$|E

5|$|Exipulum is a {{term used}} to refer to the tissue or tissues {{containing}} the hymenium of an ascomycete fruit body. The ectal excipulum (outer tissue layer) is thin (20–30µm thickness), made of a tissue type known as texura porrecta, consisting of more or less parallel hyphae all in one direction, with wide lumina and non-thickened walls. The medullary exipulum (middle tissue layer) is thick (200–600µm) <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> textura intricata, a tissue layer made of irregularly interwoven hyphae with distinct spaces between the hyphae. The asci (filamentous structures in which the ascospores develop) are cylindrical with gradually tapering bases, eight-spored, and measure 240–280 by 12–15µm. The ascospores have ellipsoidal to roughly cylindrical shapes, usually with blunt ends, and measure 19–22 by 10–12µm. They have smooth surfaces and usually contain two large oil drops. The paraphyses (sterile, filamentous hyphae present in the hymenium) are cylindrical, 2–3µm thick, barely enlarged at their apices, straight, and mostly unbranched above. They may sometimes anastomose, but do not form a conspicuous network. The paraphyses contain numerous red granules.|$|E
5|$|Rocket bombs, {{aerodynamic}} {{wings and}} explosive payloads: The first known rockets fitted with aerodynamic wings {{are described as}} the 'flying crows with magic fire' in the oldest strata of the Huolongjing (early-to-mid 14th century), compiled by Jiao Yu and Liu Bowen during the early Ming Dynasty (1368–1644). The body of the rocket was shaped like a bird (specifically a crow), packed with gunpowder, <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> bamboo laths forming a long basketwork frame that was reinforced with glued paper. A decorative head and tail were attached {{to the front and}} back ends, while the wings were nailed to the sides. Under each wing were two slanting rockets to propel the weapon; a main fuse was lit that ignited a fourfold fuse connected to each rocket and running through a drilled hole {{in the back of the}} bird. The book then claims that the rocket, after being launched high into the air and aimed at encampments or enemy boats, automatically produced an explosion upon impact that could be seen from considerably long distances.|$|E
5|$|Temples, {{where the}} state rituals were carried out, were filled with images of the gods. The most {{important}} temple image was the cult statue in the inner sanctuary. These statues were usually less than life-size, <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> the same precious materials that were said to form the gods' bodies. Many temples had several sanctuaries, each with a cult statue representing one of the gods in a group such as a family triad. The city's primary god was envisioned as its lord, employing many of the residents as servants in the divine household that the temple represented. The gods residing in the temples of Egypt collectively represented the entire pantheon. But many deities—including some important gods {{as well as those}} that were minor or hostile—were never given temples of their own, although some were represented in the temples of other gods.|$|E

5|$|The Alsos Mission {{set out on}} 20 April and rendezvoused {{with the}} 1269th Engineer Combat Battalion at Freudenstadt. The intact bridge over the Neckar River at Horb was crossed and Haigerloch was {{occupied}} without opposition on 22 April. The main body of Task Force A arrived on 23 April. In a laboratory in a cellar they found a German experimental nuclear reactor shaped like a cylinder <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> graphite blocks, but the uranium and heavy water were missing. The scientists immediately began dismantling it. Pash left Hambro in charge, while he led troops of Task Force A to Bisingen, {{and then on to}} Hechingen, where 25 scientists were captured, including von Weizsäcker, von Laue, Karl Wirtz, Horst Korsching and Erich Bagge. At Tailfingen they took Otto Hahn and nine members of his staff into custody. At Haigerloch, a sealed drum of documents was retrieved from a cesspool, and three drums of heavy water and 1.5 tons of uranium ingots were found buried in a field. The uranium and heavy water were loaded onto trucks. The apertures in the cellar were blown up with minor explosions to prevent their capture by the French.|$|E
5|$|The coif was {{the main}} symbol of the Order of Serjeants-at-Law, and is where their most {{recognisable}} name (the Order of the Coif) comes from. The coif was white <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> either silk or lawn. A Serjeant was never obliged to take off or cover his coif, {{not even in the}} presence of the King, except as a judge when passing a death sentence. In that situation he would wear a black cap intended to cover the Coif, although it is often confused with the coif itself. When wigs were first introduced for barristers and judges it caused some difficulty for Serjeants, who were not allowed to cover the coif. Wigmakers got around this by adding a small white cloth to the top of the wig, representing the coif.|$|E
5|$|The main armour {{used was}} chainmail hauberks, usually knee-length, with slits to allow riding, some with sleeves to the elbows. Some hauberks {{may have been}} made of scales {{attached}} to a tunic, with the scales made of metal, horn or hardened leather. Headgear was usually a conical metal helmet with a band of metal extending down to protect the nose. Horsemen and infantry carried shields. The infantryman's shield was usually round <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> wood, with reinforcement of metal. Horsemen had changed to a kite-shaped shield and were usually armed with a lance. The couched lance, carried tucked against the body under the right arm, was a relatively new refinement and was probably not used at Hastings; the terrain was unfavourable for long cavalry charges. Both the infantry and cavalry usually fought with a straight sword, long and double-edged. The infantry could also use javelins and long spears. Some of the cavalry may have used a mace instead of a sword. Archers would have used a self bow or a crossbow, and most {{would not have had}} armour.|$|E

5|$|The {{station is}} located in the {{residential}} area of Mortensrud, in Søndre Nordstrand. Mortensrud is an open station without any barriers and free access from the bus stops. The station area is one storey below from the surrounding area. It has step-free access, and at the same level as the buses. Only the western portion of the two side platforms is in use, where direct connection can be made with buses. The station is located adjacent to the shopping center at Mortensrud. The station is designed by Arkitektskap. It is built in concrete, covered in red brick, steel, natural rock and wood, that will allow lianas to grow on them. The roofover the western platform is curved, <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> wood and glass. There is an underground parking lot in two levels.|$|E
5|$|This {{series of}} {{successful}} British infantry and mounted operations {{resulted in the}} complete defeat of the 16,000 to 18,000 strong German, Austrian and Ottoman force, about half of whom were killed or wounded, and nearly 4,000 taken prisoner. Also captured were a mountain gun battery of four heavy guns, nine machine guns, a complete camel-pack machine gun company, 2,300 rifles and a million rounds of ammunition, two complete field hospitals with all instruments, fittings and drugs, while a great quantity of stores in the supply depot at Bir el Abd was destroyed. All the captured arms and equipment were made in Germany, and the camel-pack machine gun company's equipment had been especially designed for desert warfare. Many of the rifles were of the latest pattern <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> rustless steel. Murray estimated the total German and Ottoman casualties at about 9,000, while a German estimate put the loss at {{one third of the}} force (5,500 to 6,000), which seems low considering the number of prisoners.|$|E
