Indeed, when Bradbury wrote the novel during the McCarthy era, {{he was concerned about}} censorship in the United States. During a radio interview in 1956, Bradbury said:I wrote this book at a time when I was worried <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>things</b> were going in this country four years ago. Too many people were afraid of their shadows; there was a threat of book burning. Many of the books were being taken off the shelves at that time. And of course, things have changed a lot in four years. Things are going back in a very healthy direction. But at the time I wanted to do some sort of story where I could comment on what would happen to a country if we let ourselves go too far in this direction, where then all thinking stops, and the dragon swallows his tail, and we sort of vanish into a limbo and we destroy ourselves by this sort of action.|$|E

40|$|No capítulo IV do The Significance of Philosophical Scepticism, Stroud, depois de expor seu entendimento do “idealismo transcendental” e do “realismo empírico” de Kant, apresenta várias dificuldades presentes no projeto kantiano. A {{principal}} delas consiste em afirmar que o idealismo transcendental seria compatível com o ceticismo acerca do conhecimento objetivo, o conhecimento do modo como as coisas são por si mesmas. Esse artigo apresenta uma crítica, exposta na forma de argumento condicional, a essa dificuldade do idealismo transcendental kantiano apontada por Stroud. O argumento consiste em sustentar que, se a interpretação que Allison faz da distinção transcendental entre “fenômeno” e “coisa em si” (como uma distinção de dois modos distintos de conceber um mesmo objeto) for correta, então a acusação de um compromisso do idealismo transcendental com o ceticismo não se sustenta.

The argument consists of sustaining that, if the interpretation that Allison makes of the transcendental distinction between "phenomenon" and "thing in itself" (as a distinction of two different manners of conceiving a same object) is correct, then the accusation of a commitment of the transcendental idealism with the scepticism is not sustained. </div...|$|R

40|$|Academic research, in its purest form, {{is about}} {{changing}} how {{we understand the}} world. Sometimes this involves an entirely new philosophical, logical, or aesthetic principle. On other occasions, it sheds light on how different types of existing knowledge can combine. Or it may be characterised by new observations emerging entirely by accident, and that we as yet cannot explain. In general, we understand innovation differently. We might say that innovation is <b>about</b> changing <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>things</b> are. <b>The</b> concept of innovation brings with it {{the notion of a}} new way to do something - not just a new way to understand it. In this sense, innovation implicitly requires practical outcomes and impact. This impact can be in any area, even the nature of research itself. It is clear that academic institutions should be active in both research and innovation. The 2015 Dowling Review of Business-University Research Collaborations states that ‘use-inspired research’ drives new insights in fundamental research, and that greater funding of collaborative research and development, supported by ‘pump-prime’ funding, is required in order to deliver improved economic impact and more valuable research in general. It also states that the current strategy is not well coordinated. However, there have been some attempts to explore how collaborative R&D might work better. In the past few years, projects such as Creativeworks London, and other similar, related enterprises including London Creative and Digital Fusion, and the NESTA, AHRC, ACE Digital R&D fund, have provided excellent opportunities to explore and better understand how institutions can more effectively collaborate with non-academic partners.
