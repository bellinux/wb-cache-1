50|$|Greenough is {{credited}} {{for the design}} of the modern surf fin as well as with influencing modern surfing’s radical ‘progressive’ turning in the pocket and deep barrel approach. The newer shortboards were built to specifically copy the same style of banking turns, fast burning down the line attitude that Greenough was known for. Greenough started to shape his first boards out of balsa wood in his high school wood shop. He started out as a stand-up surfer in the 50’s but swapped out for switching between kneeboarding and an <b>air</b> <b>inflated</b> mattress in 1961; according to Greenough, these gave him a heightened sense of speed that came from a lowered body position. The famous ‘spoon’ board was created in 1961-“a blunt-nosed balsa kneeboard, 5 feet long and 23 inches wide, with a dished-out midsection and tail that slimmed down to a mere half-inch thickness.” He switched out the normal fin at the time, a massive 10 inch protrusion, with a smaller (almost by a third) flexible swept-back model he had traced directly from a dorsal fin of a dolphin. This design had an effect of reducing the amount of drag and increased the handling of the board by a considerable margin. the new fin was {{considered one of the most}} elegant and functional piece of equipment to come out of this generation of surfing, the next generation of surfboard fin, which Greenough called a “high aspect ratio fin”, took around three years to actually become popular.|$|E

40|$|Objective: There {{is still}} little {{evidence}} regarding {{the type of}} mattress {{that is the best}} for preventing pressure ulcers (PUs). In a Dutch nursing home, a new type of overlay mattress (<b>air</b> <b>inflated</b> visco-elastic foam) was tested to analyze the opportunity for replacement of the normally used static air overlay mattress in its three-step PU prevention protocol In this small pilot the outcome measures were: healing of a category one pressure ulcer, new development or deterioration of a category one PU and need for repositioning. Methods: We included 20 nursing home residents with a new category one pressure ulcer, existing for no longer than 48 h following a consecutive sampling technic. All residents were staying for more than 30 days in the nursing home and were lying on a visco-elastic foam mattress without repositioning (step one of the 3 -step protocol) {{at the start of the}} pilot study. They had not suffered from a PU in the month before. The intervention involved use of an <b>air</b> <b>inflated</b> foam overlay instead of a static air overlay (normally step 2 of the 3 -step protocol). At the start; the following data were registered: age; gender; main diagnosis and presence of incontinence. Thereafter; all participating residents were checked weekly for PU healing tendency; deterioration of PUs; new PUs and need of repositioning. Only when residents showed still a category one PU after 48 h or deterioration of an existing pressure ulcer or if there was development of a new pressure ulcer, repositioning was put into practice (step 3 of the PU protocol). All residents participated during 8 weeks. Results: Seven residents developed a new pressure ulcer category one and still had a category one pressure ulcer at the end of the study period. One resident developed a pressure ulcer category 2. Fifteen residents needed repositioning from one week after start of the study until the end of the study. Conclusions: Overall 40 % of the residents developed a pressure ulcer. Seventy five percent of the residents started with repositioning because there was no healing tendency of their category one PU diagnosed at the start of the pilot. Because this new type of overlay mattress resulted in an increased PU incidence, and almost standard need of repositioning with accompanied high costs, this type of overlay mattress gives no benefit above the traditional visco-elastic foam mattresses in combination with the originally used static air overlay...|$|E
40|$|Tensairity is a {{lightweight}} structural concept, a synergistic combination of an air-beam, cables and struts, which is categorized as a pneumatic structure. The central idea of Tensairity {{is to use}} a low pressure of the internal air to stabilize compression elements against buckling. The basic element consists of a simple air-beam (a low pressure inflated tube), a compression element tightly connected to the air-beam and two tension cables having a spiral shape around the tube. Both the cables and the struts play the role of transferring the applied forces over the <b>air</b> <b>inflated</b> beam; the latter stabilizes then the compression element against buckling. This solution increases the load-carrying capacity compared to a traditional simple air-beam. At the same time, the pressure inside the air-tube can be lowered. Tensairity is, due to its characteristics, especially interesting for temporary and architectural applications, like roof structures, (temporary) bridges and tent structures. The applicability of the concept is not restricted to beams. It is also valid for columns or arches. The simplest Tensairity beam has a cylindrical geometry, but many other shapes are possible, too. Cigar-shaped or spindle-shaped beams still have a circular cross section, but are stiffer than the cylindrical structure.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Air</b> <b>inflated</b> cushion using {{pre-sealed}} two-layer plastic films forms air filled structural cushion when {{compressed air}} is charged to pre-sealed airtight chambers during packaging operation. The plastic films {{are made by}} co-extrusion of polyethylene/polyamide/polyethylene (PE/PA/PE) to keep required strength, permeability of the cushioning materials and easy production of the cushion. The air filled cushion structure is designed into column chambers with five different selective widths which form five different–cushion thick-ness when regulated compressed air is charged into the chambers using controlled pressure gauge during packaging performance. Uniquely designed charge port to each chamber provides individual chamber {{with the ability to}} work independently, hence ensures the protective function of packaging and allows the air cush-ions to be easily manipulated to a given product to be packaged. Static cushioning performance tests to air filled cushion materials at desirable air pressures showed that minimum cushion factor was about 4, and ap-peared at compressive strain of the materials from 55 - 80 %. Dynamic impact to the samples with dimension of 180 by 180 cm at drop height of 76 cm demonstrates relationship between impact mass and acceleration levels, indicating the suitability of the materials {{for a wide range of}} packaging application to electronic products and devices.

However, non-destructive microstructural 3 D imaging of formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissues would facilitate retrospective analysis of extensive tissue archives of lung FFPE lung samples with linked clinical data. Methods: FFPE human lung tissue samples (n = 4) were scanned using a Nikon metrology mu CT scanner. Semi-automatic techniques were used to segment the 3 D structure of airways and blood vessels. Airspace size (mean linear intercept, Lm) was measured on mu CT images and on matched histological sections from the same FFPE samples imaged by light microscopy to validate mu CT imaging. Results: the mu CT imaging protocol provided contrast between tissue and paraffin in FFPE samples (15 mm x 7 mm). Resolution (voxel size 6. 7 mu m) in the reconstructed images was sufficient for semi-automatic image segmentation of airways and blood vessels as well as quantitative airspace analysis.

40|$|A solar chimney {{power plant}} has three major {{components:}} A circular solar collector (Greenhouse) A tall cylinder {{in the center}} of the solar collector (Solar Chimney) A set of air turbines geared to electric generators around the bottom of the solar chimney The air warms up inside the greenhouse by the solar irradiation and, due to its buoyancy, tends to escape through the Solar Chimney. This warm stream of air is leaving part of its thermodynamic energy to the air turbines placed in the path of the airflow. The solar chimney power stations were named Solar Aero-Electric Power Plants (SAEPPs) due to their similarity to Hydro Electric Power Plants. The efficiency of the SAEPPs is roughly proportional to the height of their solar chimneys. Solar Chimneys can be made as reinforced concrete structures (Concrete Solar Chimneys, CFCs), or as lighter than <b>air</b> <b>inflated</b> structures (Floating Solar Chimneys FSCs). These floating solar chimneys are made by successive balloon tubes, filled with a lighter than air gas. This permits to the FSCs to float in the air and thus to have heights 1. 5 ÷ 3 Km giving to their SAEPPs higher efficiencies than Concrete Solar Chimney SAEPPs. Using ground thermal storage, or artificial thermal storage in the form of water in closed plastic tubes, it can be proved that the SAEPPs can operate 24 hours per day 365 days per year with a minimum guaranteed power production. This means that the SAEPPs, although renewable by nature, can have a similar operation to conventional power stations and thus can replace them. In the present paper a comparison for construction cost of SAEPPs with Floating Solar Chimneys and Concrete Solar Chimneys is given. It is shown that FSC Technology Power Plants is 5 to 6 times cheaper than CFC Technology Power Plants. © 2007 IEEE...|$|E
