But I felt he was a greenhorn, {{and it turned out}} he didn't have {{experience}} in decision-making." [...] As for McCain, Eastwood reflected, [...] "I voted for McCain, not because he was a Republican, but because he had been through war (in Vietnam) and I thought he might understand the war in Iraq better than somebody who hadn't. I didn't agree with him on a lot of stuff." [...] On August 3, 2012, he attended a fundraiser for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, suggesting that Romney would boost the country and [...] "restore a decent tax system... so that there's a fairness and people are not pitted against one another as [...] who's paying taxes and who isn't." [...] During a speech at the 2012 Republican National Convention, Eastwood talked to an empty chair as if President Barack Obama were sitting in it. The speech was met with a huge response by the media with both praise and criticism. Eastwood, who said he came up with the speech 5 seconds before he gave it, said that if he could do it again he would say something different. [...] "My only message was [...] I wanted people to take the idolizing factor out of every contestant out there. Just look at the work, look at the background, and then make a judgment on that. I was just trying to say that, and did it in kind of a roundabout way which took a lot more time, I suppose, than they would have liked. I'd probably say something else but I'd try to get the same message across so that people don't have to kiss up to politicians. No matter what party they're in, you should evaluate their work <b>and</b> <b>make</b> <b>your</b> judgments accordingly. That's {{the way to do it}} in life and every other subject, but sometimes in America we get gaga, we look at the wrong values." ...|$|E
2500|$|He then {{transferred}} and majored in history at Michigan State University. He said that, during this period, {{he was a}} particular fan of Ernest Hemingway's writing and {{came to believe that}} [...] "the hardest thing to do is write clearly and simply, <b>and</b> <b>make</b> <b>your</b> point in an elegant way". Upon graduation, Hill was called up for the army in 1964 but childhood asthma saw him ruled ineligible. This forced him to think about {{what he wanted to do}} for a career. [...] "When you are that age, you think you are going to be in the army two years, it's a huge amount of time. You don't bother worrying about what you are doing. Suddenly, this whole thing was upon me." ...|$|E

I can’t believe we won at Talladega. This race is the scariest of the three in the bracket. To be able to win here is really a privilege, it really is.” Kyle Busch, Dale Earnhardt, Jr., Kasey Kahne and Jimmie Johnson were the four drivers who were eliminated. [...] "We had a real good car most of the day," [...] Earnhardt said. [...] "Got real loose, kind of shuffled out. ... It's just hard racing. That's the way it goes at the end of these races. We weren't in good position." ...|$|E

2500|$|During the Summer of 1875, both Bristow and Pierrepont {{obtained}} President Grant's {{order to}} [...] "let know guilty man escape". During the Fall of 1875, evidence {{was discovered that}} Grant's private secretary, Orville Babcock {{had been involved in}} the Ring. Bristow and Pierrepont, stayed behind after a cabinet meeting with President Grant and showed him correspondence between Babcock and William Joyce in St. Louis, indicted in the Ring, cryptic telegram messages as evidence of Babcock's involvement in the Ring. Babcock was summoned to the Oval Office for an explanation and was told to send a telegram to bring Wilson to Washington, D.C. After Babcock did not return to the Oval Office, Pierrepont discovered Babcock {{was in the process of}} writing a letter warning Wilson to be on his guard. This angered Attorney General Pierrepont, who spilled ink over Babcock's letter and shouted, [...] "You don't want to send your argument; send the fact, and go there <b>and</b> <b>make</b> <b>your</b> explanation. I do not understand it." [...] Babcock was indicted and later acquitted in a trial in St. Louis, after an oral deposition from President Grant defending Babcock was given to the jury. The Justice Department obtained 110 convictions of persons involved in the Whiskey Ring.|$|E
2500|$|The obscure {{nature of}} the Organization's {{activities}} throughout Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories and Kingdom Hearts II led reviewers to describe them as an [...] "ominous" [...] group that [...] "seems to be intent on guiding Sora and his friends to accomplish some dark purpose". Similarly, Rice Burner of GamePro emphasizes this plot when reviewing the group's debut, noting how the [...] "strange inhabitants of the castle trap our heroes" [...] and [...] "force Sora on a ponderous journey into his own memories to face his subconscious thoughts and fears". This mysterious perception is furthered {{by the fact that}} some members of Organization XIII present themselves as dark silhouettes with their faces covered, acting as an [...] "enigmatic robed and cowled figure speaking in riddles". The questions surrounding the groups motivation and purpose have created great curiosity among players; Andrew Reiner of Game Informer included [...] "What secret lies behind Organization XIII?" [...] as one of the main questions that are answered and that serve as plot devices in Kingdom Hearts II, creating situations that [...] "certainly give you shivers <b>and</b> <b>make</b> <b>your</b> heart leap". Visually, the artwork of Organization XIII's members is based more on the styles of Final Fantasy rather than those of Disney. Bethany Massimilla of GameSpot referred to their models as [...] "very much cut from the Final Fantasy spiky-haired cloth".|$|E
2500|$|On 4 August 1795 in Sheffield a newly raised {{regiment}} {{complained that}} their bounties were being withheld from them. A crowd assembled in their support {{and refused to}} disperse. The Riot Act was read and the local Volunteers fired on the crowd, killing two and injuring others. Fitzwilliam wrote to Burke on 9 August: [...] "...the Volunteer corps have shewn their readiness to act in support of Law and Order, {{in a manner that}} must give great satisfaction to all those, who wish to see them maintain'd ... in the manner, in which it has ended, I trust it will be productive of good, and tend much to the future quiet of the place". Fitzwilliam wrote on 6 October to George Ponsonby that the Foxites were supporting [...] "the most desperate system of universal subversion" [...] and could not be trusted: [...] "With my disinclination to the Ministry,with the affections I shall ever bear to the most conspicuous part of Opposition, I must...agree with my neighbours in thinking that before Opposition can be Ministers they must give to the public, security...for the maintenance of things as they are". On 8 December Pitt announced that the government was considering peace with the newly established Directory of France. The next day Burke wrote to Fitzwilliam: [...] "You are to judge, whether you ought to come down <b>and</b> <b>make</b> <b>your</b> Protest against this shameful and ruinous Business. You will certainly stand alone. But this is not always to stand disgraceful". Fitzwilliam gave his speech on 14 December, and said the war was [...] "of a nature different from all common wars" [...] and had commenced: ...|$|E
