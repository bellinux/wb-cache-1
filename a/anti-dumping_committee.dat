It describes the mechanism which led to the adoption of anti-dumping rules on an international level and the consequences it had for the UE legal system. 2. 	Chapter II provides an analysis of the economic basis for the anti-dumping regulations. Two opposite options are confronted.

50|$|Note {{that the}} Commission {{could make a}} {{proposal}} {{in a way that}} removed the requirement for a qualified majority. For example, the <b>Anti-Dumping</b> Advisory <b>Committee</b> (ADAC) could approve a proposal to impose tariffs based on a simple, unweighted majority, but overturning it would have required a qualified majority because this meant voting against a Commission proposal. This greatly increased the power of small member states in such circumstances.|$|R
50|$|The bureaucratic entity {{responsible}} for advising member states on anti-dumping actions is the Directorate General Trade (DG Trade) in Brussels. Community industry {{can apply to}} have an anti-dumping investigation begin. DG Trade first investigates the standing of the complainants. If they are found to represent at least 25% of community industry, the investigation will probably begin. The process is guided by quite specific guidance in the regulations. The DG Trade will {{make a recommendation to}} a committee known as the <b>Anti-Dumping</b> Advisory <b>Committee,</b> on which each member state has one vote. Member states abstaining will be treated as if they voted in favour of industrial protection, a voting system which has come under considerable criticism.|$|R

In December 2009, the EU decided to extend duties on the imports of leather shoes from China and Vietnam for another 15 months. This affirmative decision was taken despite heavy protests from consumers, importers and outsourcing firms, and it overruled the negative advice that had been formulated earlier by the EU <b>Anti-Dumping</b> Advisory <b>Committee.</b> The review procedure was launched {{just a few days}} after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, which marked the outbreak of the Great Recession and fuelled the fear that the EU would engage in a ‘protectionist spiral’. In such a spiral, some countries would raise protection in order to counter the negative spillovers from the financial sector on the real economy. Other countries would become adversely affected by this protection and then start to retaliate. The question is whether this review marked the beginning of a more protectionist attitude in the EU in the face of the global recession...|$|R
