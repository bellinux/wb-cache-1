40|$|Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars {{generally}} have spherically symmetric envelopes, whereas most post-AGB stars and Planetary Nebulae (PNe) show axisymmetric circumstellar envelopes. While various mechanisms for axisymmetric circumstellar structures {{may explain the}} shapes of PNe, they do not address how {{the shape of the}} circumstellar shell evolves. Here we address the temporal changes in the <b>axisymmetry</b> of AGB star envelopes, and in particular the development of the torus required in the Generalized Interacting Stellar Winds (GISW) model. Assuming (1) an AGB star rotates with sufficient angular speed {{at the start of the}} AGB phase; and (2) that the rotational angular momentum of the AGB star is conserved, we demonstrate that some very important observational features of AGB star <b>axisymmetry</b> evolution can be reproduced. We find that, compared to the star’s increasing luminosity and decreasing effective temperature, the decreasing mass of the star primarily affects the <b>axisymmetry</b> of the envelope. When a representative mass loss history is adopted, where most of the mass is lost near the end of the AGB phase, the envelope’s <b>axisymmetry</b> increases over time, with the strongest increase occurring near the end of the AGB phase. This may naturally explain why most AGB stars have spherically symmetric envelopes, while <b>axisymmetry</b> seems common-place in the post-AGB/PNe phase. The degree of <b>axisymmetry</b> at the end of the AGB phase is found to increase with increasing main sequence mass, and the onset of <b>axisymmetry</b> occurs only after the onset of the superwind (SW) phase, in good agreement with the observations...|$|E

The observed inertial range non- <b>axisymmetry</b> is reproduced by a 'fly through' sampling of a Direct Numerical Simulation of MHD turbulence. Furthermore, 'fly through' sampling of a linear superposition of transverse waves with axisymmetric fluctuations generates the trend in non- <b>axisymmetry</b> with power spectral exponent.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this experimental study is to characterise the small-scale turbulence in the intermediate wake of a circular cylinder using measured mean-squared velocity gradients. Seven of the twelve terms which feature in ε, the mean dissipation rate of the turbulent kinetic energy, were measured throughout the intermediate wake at a Reynolds number of Red ≈ 3000 based on the cylinder diameter (d). Earlier measurements of the nine major terms of ε by Browne et al. (J Fluid Mech 179 : 307 – 326 1987) at a downstream distance (x) of x = 420 d and Red ≈ 1170 are also used. Whilst departures from local isotropy are significant at all locations in the wake, local <b>axisymmetry</b> of the small-scale turbulence {{with respect to the}} mean flow direction is first satisfied approximately at x = 40 d. The approach towards local <b>axisymmetry</b> is discussed in some detail {{in the context of the}} relative values of the mean-squared velocity gradients. The data also indicate that <b>axisymmetry</b> is approximately satisfied by the large scales at xld ≥ 40, suggesting that the characteristics of the small scales reflect to a major extent those of the large scales.

40|$|Disc-winds {{originating}} {{from the inner}} parts of accretion discs are considered as the basic component of magnetically collimated outflows. The only available analytical MHD solutions to describe disc-driven jets are those characterized by the symmetry of radial self-similarity. However, radially self-similar MHD jet models, in general, have three geometrical shortcomings, (i) a singularity at the jet axis, (ii) the necessary assumption of <b>axisymmetry,</b> and (iii) the non-existence of an intrinsic radial scale, i. e. the jets formally extend to radial infinity. Hence, numerical simulations are necessary to extend the analytical solutions towards the axis, by solving the full three-dimensional equations of MHD and impose a termination radius at finite radial distance. We focus here on studying the effects of relaxing the (ii) assumption of <b>axisymmetry,</b> i. e. of performing full 3 D numerical simulations of a disc-wind crossing all magnetohydrodynamic critical surfaces. We compare {{the results of these}} runs with previous axisymmetric 2. 5 D simulations. The structure of the flow in all simulations shows strong similarities. The 3 D runs reach a steady state and stay close to <b>axisymmetry</b> for most of the physical quantities, except for the poloidal magnetic field and the toroidal velocity which slightly deviate from <b>axisymmetry.</b> The latter quantities show signs of instabilities, which, however, are confined to the region inside the fast magnetosonic separatrix surface. The forces present in the flow, both of collimating and accelerating nature, are in good agreement in both the 2. 5 D and the 3 D runs. We conclude that the analytical solution behaves well also after relaxing the basic assumption of <b>axisymmetry.</b> Comment: 8 pages, 6 figures, accepted for publication in MNRA...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} scheme to {{classify}} planetary nebulae (PNe) according to their departure from axisymmetric structure. We consider only departure along and near the equatorial plane, i. e., {{between the two sides}} perpendicular to the symmetry axis of the nebula. We consider 6 types of departure from axisymmetry: (1) PNe whose central star is not {{at the center of the}} nebula; (2) PNe having one side brighter than the other; (3) PNe having unequal size or shape of the two sides; (4) PNe whose symmetry axis is bent, e. g., the two lobes in bipolar PNe are bent toward the same side; (5) PNe whose main departure from <b>axisymmetry</b> is in the outer regions, e. g., an outer arc; (6) PNe which show no departure from <b>axisymmetry,</b> i. e., any departure, if it exists, is on scales smaller than the scale of blobs, filaments, and other irregularities in the nebula. PNe which possess more than one type of departure are classified by the most prominant type. We discuss the connection between departure types and the physical mechanisms that may cause them, mainly due to the influence by a stellar binary companion. We find that ∼ 50 % of all PNe possess large-scale departure from <b>axisymmetry.</b> This number is larger than that expected from the influence of binary companions, namely ∼ 25 − 30 %. We argue that this discrepancy comes from many PNe whose departure from <b>axisymmetry,</b> mainly unequal size, shape, or intensity, results from the presence of long-lived and large, hot or cool, spots on the surface of their AGB progenitors. Such spots locally enhance mass loss rate, leading to a deparure from <b>axisymmetry,</b> mainly near the equator, in the descendant PN...|$|E

40|$|Many {{planetary}} nebulae (PNe) exhibit symmetries {{which range from}} unremarkable spherical and elliptical shapes, to quite exotic bipolar and point-symmetric shapes. However, there are many which exhibit distinctly non-axisymmetric structure in either (i) {{the shape of the}} nebula, or (ii) in the off-centered position of the illuminating star. By examining a large number of well resolved images of PNe we estimate that ∼ 30 − 50 % of all PNe exhibit distinctly non- axisymmetric structure. In this paper, we discuss how such departures from <b>axisymmetry</b> can arise from the binary nature of the progenitors of the PNe. The scenarios include (a) relatively close binaries with eccentric orbits, and (b) longer orbital period systems with either circular or eccentric orbits. In the first mechanism (a), the departure from <b>axisymmetry</b> is caused by the variation of mass loss and/or mass transfer with the changing distance between the companions in their eccentric orbit. In the second mechanism (b), the departure from <b>axisymmetry</b> {{is the result of the}} time varying vector direction of the mass-losing star, or that of a possible pair of jets from the companion, as the stars move around their orbit. In order to assess the fraction of PNe whose non-axisymmetric morphologies are expected to arise in binary systems, we have carried out a detailed population synthesis study. In this study, a large number of primordial binaries are evolved through the lifetimes of both stars, including wind mass loss. We then assess whether the primary or the secondary (or both) produces a PN. The expected deviations from <b>axisymmetry</b> are then classified for each binary and the results tabulated. We find that ∼ 25 % of elliptical and ∼ 30 − 50 % of bipolar PNe are expected to acquire non-axisymmetric structure from binary interactions...|$|E

Emphasis is on the magnetometer and particle energy analyzer traces that might be characteristic of such flux ropes. It is shown that even a fractionally small helical distortion may considerably alter the traces in minimum-variance coordinates. In short, what may be fairly common MHD processes can render a flux rope almost unrecognizable under standard diagnostics, even if the departures from <b>axisymmetry</b> are not great...|$|E

Transmitral vortex ring is a flow feature that is observed to be non-axisymmetric in a healthy heart and its inherent asymmetry in the LV assists in efficient ejection of the blood during systole. This study is a first step towards understanding the effects of the mitral valve’s anterior leaflet on transmitral flow. We experimentally study a single-leaflet model of the mitral valve to investigate the effect of the anterior leaflet on the <b>axisymmetry</b> of the generated vortex ring based on the three-dimensional data acquired using defocusing digital particle image velocimetry. Vortex rings form downstream of a D-shaped orifice in presence or absence of the anterior leaflet in various physiological stroke ratios.
