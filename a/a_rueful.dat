500|$|... "Mutt Romney Blues" [...] is a three-chord, {{acoustic}} Delta blues song. Drawing {{parallels between}} the Mitt Romney dog incident and his political [...] "plans and schemes", the song criticizes Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and is sung {{from the perspective of}} the Romney family's dog. Cooder was inspired by Al Sharpton's quote [...] "how he treated his dog tells you a lot about him", and found the dog to be [...] "a useful character... when you view it in the light of the blues. Like a servant, a yardman, someone very low in the social order. He's just begging to be let down [...]" [...] Bud Scoppa of Uncut characterizes the song as [...] "the musical equivalent of a political cartoon". [...] "Brother Is Gone" [...] is poignantly styled as a sad folktale and features a haunting mandolin riff, <b>a</b> <b>rueful</b> tone, and wounded vocals. Its lyrics attribute the conservative Koch Brothers to the Deal with the Devil myth, which Cooder adapted from Robert Johnson's [...] "Cross Road Blues". The lyrics cite their [...] "crossroads" [...] as [...] "the prairie town of Wichita", where Koch Industries is headquartered. He said in an interview that [...] "the only logical explanation for the Brothers I could come up with is, they made their deal at the crossroads with Satan." [...] AllMusic's Thom Jurek cites it as [...] "among the finest songs 's written." ...|$|E
2500|$|Even {{though the}} water around weirs can often appear {{relatively}} calm, {{they can be}} extremely dangerous places to boat, swim, or wade, as the circulation patterns on the downstream side—typically called a hydraulic jump— can submerge a person indefinitely. This phenomenon is so well known to canoeists, kayakers, and others who spend time on rivers that they even have <b>a</b> <b>rueful</b> name for weirs: [...] "drowning machines". [...] If caught in this situation, the Ohio DNR recommends that a victim should [...] "tuck the chin down, draw the knees up to the chest with arms wrapped around them. Hopefully, conditions will be such that the current will push the victim along {{the bed of the}} river until swept beyond the boil line and released by the hydraulic." [...] The Pennsylvania State Police also recommends to [...] "curl up, dive to the bottom, and swim or crawl downstream". [...] As the hydraulic entrains air, the buoyancy of the water between the dam and boil line will be reduced by upwards of 30%, and if a victim is unable to float, escape {{at the base of the}} dam may be the only option for survival.|$|E
