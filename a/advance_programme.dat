Advance is a flexible school-based programme {{for young people to}} volunteer or implement a project of benefit to their communities in the state of Victoria, in Australia. It is a partnership between the Office for Youth, Victorian government secondary schools, and community organizations. Through participation in Advance, young people identify issues of concern or interest in their communities, and then work in partnership with community organizations to develop and deliver a community-based project or series of volunteering activities. Young people are encouraged to plan projects that build skills and make a difference in their community. This research collected data from nearly 1, 000 young people. The paper reports on their perspectives of a programme that provided them with the opportunities to lead a programme and to engage in a curriculum that was underpinned by a strong pedagogy of experiential learning...|$|E
40|$|Ten {{years after}} the year 2000 target was set by the World Health Assembly, the global {{poliomyelitis}} eradication effort has made significant progress towards that goal. The success of the initiative is built on political commitment within the endemic countries. A partnership of international organizations and donor countries works to support {{the work of the}} countries. Interagency coordinating committees are used to ensure that all country needs are met and to avoid duplication of donor effort. Private sector support has greatly expanded the resources available at both the national and international level. At the programmatic level, rapid implementation of surveillance is the key to success, but the difficulty of building effective surveillance programmes is often underestimated. Mass immunization campaigns must be carefully planned with resources mobilized well in <b>advance.</b> <b>Programme</b> strategies should be simple, clear and concise. While improvements in strategy and technology should be continuously sought, changes should be introduced only after careful consideration. Careful consideration should be given in the planning phases of a disease control initiative on how the initiative can be used to support other health initiatives...|$|E

40|$|Background: In {{order to}} improve the quality of care for cancer patients, The Norwegian Radium Hospital {{established}} in 1982 an <b>advanced</b> <b>programme</b> in cancer nursing. During the period 1982 – 2000, 366 cancer nurses were graduated. Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate how the cancer nurses implement their competence into clinical practice after graduating from the programme. The Research questions answered were: 1) Do the cancer nurses utilise their competence in clinical practice, 2) Is there conformity between the cancer nurses own evaluation of their competence and the skills needed for managing their duties in clinical practice and 3) Did the <b>advanced</b> <b>programme</b> in cancer nursing become of importance for their skills development? Methods: This study is a part of a larger study with a survey design and the study sample consists of 188 cancer nurses out of 366 (response rate 53 %). Data was collected through a semi-structured questionnaire; this study is based on the quantitative data. A Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) was used to collect data from six areas of competence. Data analysis includes frequency-, correlation-, and cross table analysis. Chronbach’s alpha coefficient was used for measuring internal consistency. Results: The majority of the cancer nurses are working in bedside nursing, still 20 years after graduation. They evaluate their own competence as highly favourable regarding issues in care, medicine, education, collaboration, professional development and prevention. They considered the <b>advanced</b> <b>programme</b> as being very important for the development of their competence. The programme contributed to its main objective: to prepare cancer nurses for clinical practice. The <b>advanced</b> <b>programme</b> recruits nurses from the clinical practice and the cancer nurses go back to bed side nursing after completing the programme...|$|R
