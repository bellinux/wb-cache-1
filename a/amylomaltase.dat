40|$|Starch {{is a major}} {{carbon and}} energy source {{throughout}} all kingdoms of life. It consists of two carbohydrate polymers, branched amylopectin and linear amylose, which are sparingly soluble in water. Hence, the enzymatic breakdown by glycoside hydrolases (GHs) is of great biological and societal importance. <b>Amylomaltases</b> (AMs) are GHs specialized in the hydrolysis of Î±- 1, 4 textendashlinked sugar chains such as amylose. They are able to catalyze an intramolecular transglycosylation of a bound sugar chain yielding polymeric sugar rings, the cycloamyloses (CAs), consisting of 20 to 100 glucose units.

In total, 15 glucose residues interact with the protein in an extended crevice with a length of more than 40 r A. A modified succinimide, derived from aspartate, mediates protein-sugar interactions, suggesting a biological role for this nonstandard amino acid.

The deduced amino acid sequence of the <b>amylomaltase</b> exhibited {{a high level of}} homology with the amino acid sequence of potato disproportionating enzyme (D-enzyme) (41 %) but a low level of homology with the amino acid sequence of the Escherichia coli <b>amylomaltase</b> (19 %). The <b>amylomaltase</b> gene was overexpressed in E. coli, and the enzyme was purified. This enzyme exhibited maximum activity at 75 °C in a 10 -min reaction with maltotriose and was stable at temperatures up to 85 °C. When the enzyme acted on amylose, it catalyzed an intramolecular transglycosylation (cyclization) reaction which produced cyclic α- 1, 4 -glucan (cycloamylose), like potato D-enzyme. The yield of cycloamylose produced from synthetic amylose with an average molecular mass of 110 kDa was 84 %. However, the minimum degree of polymerization (DP) of the cycloamylose produced by T. aquaticus enzyme was 22, whereas the minimum DP of the cycloamylose produced by potato D-enzyme was 17.

40|$|Carbohydrates are {{essential}} components of all living organisms and form {{the most abundant}} class of biological molecules. Polysaccharides such as starch are an important food reserve in plants and a major nutrient for animals. Whereas higher plants synthesize starch, bacteria, lower eukaryotes and animals accumulate glycogen. Due to the important biological role of these poly-saccharides for energy storage and uptake, selective hydrolysis and formation of glycosidic bonds are critical steps for all organisms. Thus, various enzymes have been identified to act on starch. Amylo-maltase catalyses the transglycosylation reaction of a- 1, 4 -glucans {{and is a member}} of the a-amylase family of enzymes. The crystal structure of <b>amylomaltase</b> from Thermus aquaticus was determined by multiple iso-morphous replacement to 2. 0 Å resolution and in complex with acarbose, a maltotetraose derivative, to 1. 9 Å resolution. As a member of the a-amylase family the core structure of amylo-maltase consists of a (b, a) 8 barrel. In <b>amylomaltase,</b> the eight-fold symmetry of this barrel is disrupted by several insertions between the barrel strands. The largest insertions are between the third and fifth barrel strands, where two insertions form subdomain B 1, as well as between the second and third barrel strands, forming the a-helical subdomain B 2. Whereas part of subdomain B 1 is also present in other enzyme structures of the a-amylase family, subdomain B 2 is unique to amylo-maltase. Remarkably, the C-terminal domain C, which is present in all related enzymes of the a-amylase family and essential for their catalytic activity, is missing in amylo-maltase. The catalytic side chains (two Asp and one Glu) of <b>amylomaltase</b> show a similar arrange-ment as in previously characterized members of the a-amylase family, indicating similar mechanisms of the glycosyl transfer reaction. A unique feature of <b>amylomaltase</b> is its ability to catalyse the formation of cyclic amylose. In contrast to the well studied cyclodextrin glucano-transferases (CGTases), which synthesize cycloamylose with a ring size of 6 - 8, the <b>amylomaltase</b> from Thermus aquaticus produces cycloamyloses with a size of 22 glucose residues and higher. In the inhibitor bound structure of <b>amylomaltase,</b> two binding sites for acarbose were located. The analysis of these binding sites, the molecular surface and a comparison to related <b>amylomaltase</b> sequences revealed a possible binding mode for large amylose substrates and suggested candidates for amino acids, Tyr- 54 and amino acids within the 250 s and 460 s loop, which might be varied by muta-genesis in order to influence the cyclization yield and the product ring size...|$|E

In order to obtain <b>amylomaltase</b> with less hydrolytic activity, random mutagenesis was perfromed for the enzyme gene. Tyr 54 (Y 54) was identified as the amino acid involved in the hydrolytic activity of the enzyme. When Y 54 was replaced with all other amino acids by site-directed mutagenesis, the hydrolytic activities of the mutated enzymes were drastically altered. The hydrolytic activities of the Y 54 G, Y 54 P, Y 54 T, and Y 54 W mutated enzymes were remarkably reduced compared with that of the wild-type enzyme, while those of the Y 54 F and Y 54 K mutated enzymes were {{similar to that of the}} wild-type enzyme. Introducing an amino acid replacement at Y 54 also significantly affected the cyclization activity of the <b>amylomaltase.</b> The Y 54 A, Y 54 L, Y 54 R, and Y 54 S mutated enzymes exhibited cyclization activity that was approximately twofold higher than that of the wild-type enzyme.

We report here a novel aspect of mal gene regulation: the effect of cytoplasmic glucose and glucokinase (Glk) on the activity and the expression of MalT. <b>Amylomaltase</b> (MalQ) is essential for the metabolism of maltose. It forms maltodextrins and glucose from maltose or maltodextrins. We found that glucose above a concentration of 0. 1 mM blocked the activity of the enzyme. malQ mutants when grown in the absence of maltodextrins are endogenously induced by maltotriose that is derived from the degradation of glycogen. Therefore, the fact that glk malQ+ mutants showed elevated mal gene expression finds its explanation in the reduced ability to remove glucose from MalQ-catalyzed maltodextrin formation and is caused by a metabolically induced MalQ− phenotype. However, even in mutants lacking glycogen, Glk controls endogenous induction. We found that overexpressed Glk due to its structural similarity with Mlc, the repressor of malT, binds to the glucose transporter (PtsG), releasing Mlc and thus increasing malT repression. In addition, even in mutants lacking Mlc (and glycogen), the overexpression of glk leads to a reduction in mal gene expression.

In both constitutive and inducible strains, the synthesis of both maltose transport activity (malB operon) and <b>amylomaltase</b> activity (malA operon) was inhibited. Coordinate inhibition of soluble and membrane products was not observed with the lac operon. beta-Galactosidase synthesis proceeded normally during growth on procaine, whereas, the appearance of new transport activity was reduced. Regardless of carbon source, procaine specifically inhibited the appearance of ompF protein in the membrane fraction...|$|E
40|$|In Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, the {{presence}} of a defective STA 11 locus results in significantly reduced granular starch deposition displaying major modifications in shape and structure. This defect simultaneously leads to the accumulation of linear malto-oligosaccharides (MOS). The mutants of STA 11 were showed to lack D-enzyme, a plant alpha- 1, 4 glucanotransferase analogous to the Escherichia coli <b>amylomaltase.</b> We have cloned and characterized both the cDNA and gDNA corresponding to the C. reinhardtii D-enzyme. We now report allele-specific modifications of the D-enzyme gene in the mutants of STA 11. These allele-specific modifications cosegregate with the corresponding sta 11 mutations, thereby demonstrating that STA 11 encodes D-enzyme. MOS production and starch accumulation were investigated during day and night cycles in wild-type and mutant C. reinhardtii cells. We demonstrate that in the algae MOS are produced during starch biosynthesis and degraded during the phases of net polysaccharide catabolism...|$|E
40|$|Cyclic {{adenosine}} 3 ′, 5 ′-monophosphate (AMP) stimulates maltodextrin phosphorylase synthesis in Escherichia coli cells induced with maltose. A maximal effect {{occurs at}} 2 to 3 mM cyclic AMP. The action of cyclic AMP is specific, inasmuch as adenosine triphosphate, 3 ′-AMP, 5 ′-AMP, adenosine, and dibutyryl cyclic AMP are inactive. Glucose, α-methyl glucoside, 2 -deoxyglucose, and pyridoxal 5 ′-phosphate repress maltodextrin phosphorylase synthesis. This repression is reversed by cyclic AMP. The action of cyclic AMP {{appears to be}} at the transcriptional level, since cyclic AMP fails to stimulate phosphorylase production in induced cells in which messenger ribonucleic acid synthesis has been arrested by rifampin or by inducer removal. The two other enzymes involved in the metabolism of maltose, <b>amylomaltase</b> and maltose permease, are also induced in this strain of E. coli and affected by glucose and cyclic AMP {{in a manner similar to}} phosphorylase...|$|E
40|$|Using the mini-Mu-duction technique, we cloned the malA regions from Escherichia coli K- 12 and Klebsiella pneumoniae. A {{comparison}} of the structures of the cloned DNAs indicated that the malT, malP, and malQ genes, encoding the transcriptional activator of the maltose regulon, maltodextrin phosphorylase, and <b>amylomaltase,</b> respectively, are similarly organized in both species; malP and malQ constitute an operon divergent from the malT gene. We sequenced 1, 200 nucleotides encompassing {{the beginnings of the}} malT and malP genes, their promoters, and the intergenic region. The DNA sequences from the two species were very different; the levels of homology ranged from 28 to 80 %, depending on the region. The sequences of the coding regions and of elements known to be important for the functions of these two promoters in E. coli were well conserved between the two bacteria, whereas the sequence of the malT-malP intergenic region had totally diverged...|$|E
40|$|In Salmonella typhimurium the two enzymes of proline catabolism, proline oxidase and Δ 1 -pyrroline- 5 -carboxylic acid dehydrogenase, {{are subject}} to catabolite {{repression}} when the cells are grown {{in the presence of}} glucose. Mutants partially relieved of catabolite repression (PutR) for the proline catabolic enzymes have been isolated by selection on agar plates containing glucose and proline. The specificity of the catabolite repression-insensitive character for the enzymes of proline utilization has been confirmed by an analysis of other unrelated catabolic enzymes. Histidase and <b>amylomaltase</b> of the mutant strains are equally as sensitive to glucose repression as are the enzymes from the wild type. All four PutR mutants exhibit higher induced and higher basal levels of proline oxidase as compared with the corresponding wild-type levels. The mutations of three strains tested are cotransducible with constitutive, pleiotrophic-negative and structural gene mutations of the put region. Three-factor crosses indicate that two putR mutations are located {{at one end of the}} cluster of put mutations...|$|E
40|$|We have cloned {{at least}} 12 {{different}} Escherichia coli genes which enable strain MK 2001 to use maltose. The genes were designated sfs 1 through sfs 12 (sugar fermentation stimulation). Previously, one (sfs 7) {{of them was}} mapped at 65 min on the E. coli chromosome and identified as nlp, which has high homology to repressor protein (Ner) of Mu phage, which contains a putative DNA binding region (Y. -L. Choi, T. Nishida, M. Kawamukai, R. Utsumi, H. Sakai, and T. Komano, J. Bacteriol. 171 : 5222 - 5225, 1989). In this study, another gene (sfs 1) located at 3. 5 min was newly found and analyzed. The nucleotide sequence of sfs 1 encoded a protein of 234 amino acids (molecular mass, 26, 227 Da) which also has a putative DNA binding domain. Overexpression of the sfs 1 gene in MK 2001 resulted in a 10 -fold increase of <b>amylomaltase,</b> which was still dependent on MalT. These results suggest that Sfs 1 could be a new regulatory factor involved in maltose metabolism...|$|E
40|$|The {{expression}} of the maltose regulon in Escherichia coli is induced when maltose or maltodextrins {{are present in the}} growth medium. Mutations in malK, which codes for a component of the transport system, result in the elevated {{expression of}} the remaining mal genes. Uninduced expression in the wild type, as well as elevated expression in malK mutants, is strongly repressed at high osmolarity. In the absence of malQ-encoded <b>amylomaltase,</b> expression remains high at high osmolarity. We found that uninduced expression in the wild type and elevated expression in malK mutants were paralleled by the appearance of two types of endogenous carbohydrates. One, produced primarily at high osmolarity, was identified as comprising maltodextrins that are derived from glycogen or glycogen-synthesizing enzymes. The other, produced primarily at low osmolarity, consisted of an oligosaccharide that was not derived from glycogen. We isolated a mutant that no longer synthesized this oligosaccharide. The gene carrying this mutation, termed malI, was mapped at min 36 on the E. coli linkage map. A Tn 10 insertion in malI also resulted in the loss of constitutivity at low osmolarity and delayed the induction of the maltose regulon by exogenous inducers...|$|E
40|$|The {{cellular}} localization of enzymes in Diplococcus pneumoniae {{was examined}} by fractionation of spheroplasts. A deoxyribonuclease {{implicated in the}} entry of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) into the cell during genetic transformation was located in the cell membrane. This enzyme, the major endonuclease of the cell (endonuclease I), which {{is necessary for the}} conversion of donor DNA to single strands inside the cell and oligonucleotides outside, thus could act at the cell surface. Another enzyme, the cell wall lysin (autolysin), was also found in the membrane fraction. Other enzymes, including <b>amylomaltase,</b> two exonucleases, and adenosine triphosphate-dependent deoxyribonuclease, and a restriction type endonuclease, were located in the cytosol within the cell. None of the enzymes examined were predominantly periplasmic in location. Spheroplasts were obtained spontaneously on incubation of pneumococcal cells in concentrated sugar solutions. The autolytic enzyme appears to be involved in this process. Cells that were physiologically competent to take up DNA formed osmotically sensitive spheroplasts two to three times faster than cells that were not in the competent state. Although some genetically incompetent mutants also formed spheroplasts more slowly, other such mutants formed them at the faster rate...|$|E
40|$|The pseudooligosaccharide {{acarbose}} is {{a potent}} inhibitor of amylases, glucosidases, and cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase and is clinically used {{for the treatment of}} so-called type II or insulin-independent diabetes. The compound consists of an unsaturated aminocyclitol, a deoxyhexose, and a maltose. The unsaturated aminocyclitol moiety (also called valienamine) is primarily responsible for the inhibition of glucosidases. Due to its structural similarity to maltotetraose, we have investigated whether acarbose is recognized as a substrate by the maltose/maltodextrin system of Escherichia coli. Acarbose at millimolar concentrations specifically affected the growth of E. coli K- 12 on maltose as the sole source of carbon and energy. Uptake of radiolabeled maltose was competitively inhibited by acarbose, with a Ki of 1. 1 μM. Maltose-grown cells transported radiolabeled acarbose, indicating that the compound is recognized as a substrate. Studying the interaction of acarbose with purified maltoporin in black lipid membranes revealed that the kinetics of acarbose binding to LamB is asymmetric. The on-rate of acarbose is approximately 30 times lower when the molecule enters the pore from the extracellular side than when it enters from the periplasmic side. Acarbose could not be utilized as a carbon source since the compound alone was not a substrate of <b>amylomaltase</b> (MalQ) and was only poorly attacked by maltodextrin glucosidase (MalZ) ...|$|E
40|$|The maltose regulon {{consists}} of four operons that direct the synthesis of proteins required for the transport and metabolism of maltose and maltodextrins. Expression of the mal genes is induced by maltose and maltodextrins and is dependent on a specific positive regulator, the MalT protein, {{as well as on}} the cyclic AMP-catabolite gene activator protein complex. In the absence of an exogenous inducer, expression of the mal regulon was greatly reduced when the osmolarity of the growth medium was high; maltose-induced expression was not affected, and malTc-dependent expression was only weakly affected. Mutants lacking MalK, a cytoplasmic membrane protein required for maltose transport, expressed the remaining mal genes at a high level, presumably because an internal inducer of the mal system accumulated; this expression was also strongly repressed at high osmolarity. The repression of mal regulon expression at high osmolarity was not caused by reduced expression of the malT, envZ, or crp gene or by changes in cellular cyclic AMP levels. In strains carrying mutations in genes encoding <b>amylomaltase</b> (malQ), maltodextrin phosphorylase (malP), amylase (malS), or glycogen (glg), malK mutations still led to elevated expression at low osmolarity. The repression at high osmolarity no longer occurred in malQ mutants, however, provided that glycogen was present...|$|E
40|$|Strains of Escherichia coli lacking MalQ (maltodextrin glucanotransferase or <b>amylomaltase)</b> are endog-enously induced for the maltose regulon by {{maltotriose}} that {{is derived}} from the degradation of glycogen (glycogen-dependent endogenous induction). A high level of induction was dependent on the presence of MalP, maltodextrin phosphorylase, while expression was counteracted by MalZ, maltodextrin glucosidase. Glycogen-derived endogenous induction was sensitive to high osmolarity. This osmodependence was caused by MalZ. malZ, the gene encoding this enzyme, was found to be induced by high osmolarity {{even in the absence of}} MalT, the central regulator of all mal genes. The osmodependent expression of malZ was neither RpoS nor OmpR dependent. In contrast, the malPQ operon, whose expression was also increased at a high osmolarity, was partially dependent on RpoS. In the absence of glycogen, residual endogenous induction of the mal genes that is sensitive to increasing osmolarity can still be observed. This glycogen-independent endogenous induction is not understood, and it is not affected by altering the expression of MalP, MalQ, and MalZ. In particular, its independence from MalZ suggests that the responsible inducer is not maltotriose. The Escherichia coli maltodextrin system has become a par-adigm for the understanding of a complex sugar-utilizing sys-tem in bacteria (3, 33). The regulon, controlled by MalT, th...|$|E
40|$|Maltose is {{the major}} form of carbon {{exported}} from the chloroplast at night {{as a result of}} transitory starch breakdown. Maltose exists as an α- or β-anomer. We developed an enzymatic technique for distinguishing between the two anomers of maltose and tested the accuracy and specificity of this technique using β-maltose liberated from maltoheptose by β-amylase. This technique was used to investigate which form of maltose is present during transitory starch degradation in bean (Phaseolus vulgaris), wild-type Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), two starch deficient Arabidopsis lines, and one starch-excess mutant of Arabidopsis. In Phaseolus and wild-type Arabidopsis, β-maltose levels were low during the day but were much higher at night. In Arabidopsis plants unable to metabolize maltose due to a T-DNA insertion in the gene for the cytosolic <b>amylomaltase,</b> (Y. Lu, T. D. Sharkey [2004] Planta 218 : 466 – 473) levels of α- and β-maltose were high during both the day and night. In starchless mutants of Arabidopsis, total maltose levels were low and almost completely in the α-form. We also found that the subcellular concentration of β-maltose at night was greater in the chloroplast than in the cytosol by 278 μm. We conclude that β-maltose is the metabolically active anomer of maltose and that a sufficient gradient of β-maltose exists between the chloroplast and cytosol to allow for passive transport of maltose out of chloroplasts at night...|$|E
