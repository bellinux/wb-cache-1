25|$|Most Duployan letters cursively {{connect to}} any {{adjacent}} letters. Circle vowels will sometimes reduce to <b>as</b> <b>small</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> semi-circle {{in order to}} accommodate the incoming and outgoing strokes of adjacent letters, and orienting vowels will rotate to meet the preceding letter at a straight angle, while mirroring to present themselves to the following letter.|$|E
25|$|At the time, {{the use of}} radial {{engines in}} {{land-based}} fighters was relatively rare in Europe, as {{it was believed that}} their large frontal area would cause too much drag on something <b>as</b> <b>small</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> fighter. Tank was not convinced of this, having witnessed the successful use of radial engines by the U.S. Navy, and felt a properly streamlined installation would eliminate this problem.|$|E

25|$|A mild {{form of a}} {{cleft lip}} is a {{microform}} cleft. A microform cleft can appear <b>as</b> <b>small</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> little dent in the red part of the lip or look like a scar from the lip up to the nostril. In some cases muscle tissue in the lip underneath the scar is affected and might require reconstructive surgery. It is advised to have newborn infants with a microform cleft checked with a craniofacial team {{as soon as possible}} to determine the severity of the cleft.|$|E
25|$|Aliens are eusocial life-forms with a {{caste system}} ruled {{over by a}} queen. Their life cycle {{comprises}} several distinct stages: they begin their lives as an egg, which hatches a parasitoid larval form known as a facehugger, which then attaches itself to a living host by, as its name suggests, latching onto its face. In the Alien 3 novelization, Ripley commented that this parasitoid would likely {{be able to use}} a host <b>as</b> <b>small</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> cat, or as large as an elephant.|$|E
25|$|Transmission {{electron}} microscopes {{are capable}} of imaging at a significantly higher resolution than light microscopes, owing to the smaller de Broglie wavelength of electrons. This enables the instrument to capture fine detail—even <b>as</b> <b>small</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> single column of atoms, which is thousands of times smaller than a resolvable object seen in a light microscope. Transmission electron microscopy is a major analytical method in the physical, chemical and biological sciences. TEMs find application in cancer research, virology, and materials science as well as pollution, nanotechnology and semiconductor research.|$|E
50|$|Detecting emitted {{gravitational}} waves {{is a difficult}} endeavor. It involves ultra stable high quality lasers and detectors calibrated with a sensitivity of at least 2·10−22 Hz−1/2 as shown at the ground-based detector, GEO600. It has also been proposed that even from large astronomical events, such as supernova explosions, these waves are likely to degrade to vibrations <b>as</b> <b>small</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> atomic diameter.|$|R
50|$|In Tantric Buddhism, siddhi {{specifically}} {{refers to}} the acquisition of supernatural powers by psychic or magical means or the supposed faculty so acquired. These powers include items such as clairvoyance, levitation, bilocation, becoming <b>as</b> <b>small</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> atom, materialization, having access to memories from past lives. The term is also used in this sense in the Sarva-darśana-saṃgraha of Madhvacharya (1238-1317).|$|R
5000|$|Aces Up (also {{known as}} Idiots Delight, Once in a Lifetime, Ace of the Pile, Rocket to the Top, Firing Squad, Loser Solitaire, Aces High, Drivel and [...] "Leggen") is a {{solitaire}} card game using {{a deck of}} 52 playing cards. One advantage of this game is its minimal use of space: one can even play it on <b>an</b> area <b>as</b> <b>small</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> encyclopedia volume cover.|$|R
25|$|Garrincha {{was born}} in Pau Grande, a {{district}} of Magé, {{in the state of}} Rio de Janeiro, in 1933. His father was an alcoholic, drinking cachaça heavily, a problem which Garrincha would inherit. A boy with a carefree attitude, he was smaller than other kids his age, with his sister Rosa noticing he was <b>as</b> <b>small</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> little bird she started calling him Garrincha, the north-eastern name for the wren, a little brown bird. The name stuck and by the age of four years he was known as Garrincha to his family and friends.|$|E
25|$|Caudal: The {{upper and}} lower jaws are covered with sensory pits, visible as small, black {{speckles}} on the skin, the crocodilian version of the lateral line organs seen in fish and many amphibians, though arising from a completely different origin. These pigmented nodules encase bundles of nerve fibers innervated beneath by branches of the trigeminal nerve. They respond to the slightest disturbance in surface water, detecting vibrations and small pressure changes <b>as</b> <b>small</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> single drop. This {{makes it possible for}} crocodiles to detect prey, danger and intruders, even in total darkness. These sense organs are known as domed pressure receptors (DPRs).|$|E
25|$|Aside {{from the}} above common forms, body casts could come in nearly any size and configuration. For example, from the 1910s to the 1970s, use of a {{turnbuckle}} cast, which used metal turnbuckles to twist two halves of the cast so as to forcibly straighten the spine before surgery, was common. The turnbuckle cast had no single configuration, and could be <b>as</b> <b>small</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> body jacket split in half, or could include the head, one or both legs to the knees or feet, and/or one arm to the elbow or wrist depending on {{the choice of the}} doctor.|$|E
50|$|Mosaics have {{developed}} into a popular craft and art, and {{are not limited to}} professionals. Today's artisans and crafters work with stone, ceramics, shells, art glass, mirror, beads, and even odd items like doll parts, pearls, or photographs. While ancient mosaics tended to be architectural, modern mosaics are found covering everything from park benches and flowerpots to guitars and bicycles. Items can be <b>as</b> <b>small</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> earring or <b>as</b> large <b>as</b> <b>a</b> house.|$|R
50|$|The volumes {{devoted to}} {{operations}} are grouped by theater and campaign. (See {{the list of}} titles below.) Battles are described at a unit level appropriate {{to the size of}} the engagement. In some cases authors detail the actions of units <b>as</b> <b>small</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> infantry company, though most battles are presented at the battalion or regimental level. Many accounts of individual heroism are included, especially actions which resulted in the award of the Medal of Honor.|$|R
50|$|The Colonial Revival style {{structure}} is characteristically voluminous with such classical motifs as Palladian and oculus windows, {{but it also}} retains a Queen Anne playfulness. <b>Small,</b> unexpected features <b>as</b> large as the cross-gambrel pavilions and <b>as</b> <b>small</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> oriel window in an exterior chimney give a cheerful picturesqueness to the imposing mass. The original, Colonial Revival carriage house at the rear is similarly large in scale, with wood shingles and a large gambrel roof that complements the main house.|$|R
25|$|In nature, radium {{is found}} in uranium and (to a lesser extent) thorium ores in trace amounts <b>as</b> <b>small</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> seventh of a gram per ton of uraninite. Radium is not {{necessary}} for living organisms, and adverse health effects are likely when it is incorporated into biochemical processes because of its radioactivity and chemical reactivity. Currently, other than its use in nuclear medicine, radium has no commercial applications; formerly, it {{was used as a}} radioactive source for radioluminescent devices and also in radioactive quackery for its supposed curative powers. Today, these former applications are no longer in vogue because radium's toxicity has since become known, and less dangerous isotopes are used instead in radioluminescent devices.|$|E
25|$|A {{workshop}} on {{the limitations of}} size of microbes in 1999 found that though modern nanobacteria can't be smaller in volume than {{the interior of a}} sphere of diameter 250 ± 50nm, primitive microorganisms based on a single-polymer system could be. They cite the example of RNA based life, with ribozymes (catalytic RNA) taking the place of the much larger ribosomes as enzymes for cell replication. The cells also wouldn't have proteins and would have no need to translate DNA to mRNA. The result could be cells <b>as</b> <b>small</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> sphere 50nm in diameter. These RNA World cells are one of the suggestions made {{to bridge the gap between}} abiotic chemistry and modern cells.|$|E
25|$|Although {{photolithographic}} {{technology is}} the most commercially advanced form of nanolithography, other techniques are also used. Some, for example electron beam lithography, are capable of much greater patterning resolution (sometimes <b>as</b> <b>small</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> few nanometers). Electron beam lithography is also important commercially, primarily for its use {{in the manufacture of}} photomasks. Electron beam lithography as it is usually practiced is a form of maskless lithography, in that a mask is not required to generate the final pattern. Instead, the final pattern is created directly from a digital representation on a computer, by controlling an electron beam as it scans across a resist-coated substrate. Electron beam lithography has the disadvantage of being much slower than photolithography.|$|E
5000|$|Mister Big only {{appeared}} in two storylines, [...] "Upsidaisium" [...] and [...] "Metal-Munching Mice," [...] and {{was referred to}} by name twice in the [...] "Jet Fuel Formula" [...] story and once in [...] "Missouri Mish Mash." [...] His schtick consisted of having a short stature (despite his name, he's <b>as</b> <b>small</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> insect); however, he would cast a long, tall, and menacing shadow against whatever wall was handy, projecting a sense of fear into whomever he was speaking to (usually Boris and Natasha).|$|R
50|$|A case {{definition}} {{defines a}} case by placing limits on time, person and place. Time criteria may include all cases {{of a disease}} identified from, for example, January 1, 2008 to March 1, 2008. Person criteria may include age, gender, ethnicity, and clinical characteristics such as symptoms (e.g. cough and fever) {{and the results of}} clinical tests (e.g. pneumonia on chest X-ray). Place criteria will usually specify a geographical entity such <b>as</b> <b>a</b> town, state, or country, but may be <b>as</b> <b>small</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> institution, a school class, or a restaurant meal session.|$|R
50|$|Plating is {{a surface}} {{covering}} {{in which a}} metal is deposited on a conductive surface. Plating has been done for hundreds of years; it is also critical for modern technology. Plating is used to decorate objects, for corrosion inhibition, to improve solderability, to harden, to improve wearability, to reduce friction, to improve paint adhesion, to alter conductivity, to improve IR reflectivity, for radiation shielding, and for other purposes. Jewelry typically uses plating to give a silver or gold finish. Thin-film deposition has plated objects <b>as</b> <b>small</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> atom, therefore plating finds uses in nanotechnology.|$|R
25|$|Small wind {{turbines}} {{may be used}} for a variety of applications including on- or off-grid residences, telecom towers, offshore platforms, rural schools and clinics, remote monitoring and other purposes that require energy where there is no electric grid, or where the grid is unstable. Small {{wind turbines}} may be <b>as</b> <b>small</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> fifty-watt generator for boat or caravan use. Hybrid solar and wind powered units are increasingly being used for traffic signage, particularly in rural locations, as they avoid the need to lay long cables from the nearest mains connection point. The U.S. Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) defines small wind turbines as those smaller than or equal to 100 kilowatts. Small units often have direct drive generators, direct current output, aeroelastic blades, lifetime bearings and use a vane to point into the wind.|$|E
25|$|When completed, it was {{the only}} {{fortification}} on the Potomac River. Perpendicular earthen walls stood 14 feet above the bottom of the ditch that surrounded the river side of the fort. A tower facing the river contained six cannon. Although it mounted twelve or fifteen guns (later increased) which commanded the river below its position, the American Brigadier General William H. Winder, commanding the military district around Washington, feared that a determined naval force could nevertheless blast its way past the fort. It would then have Washington at its mercy. A survey the previous year also noted that the fort blockhouse was only able to resist musket fire, and could be destroyed by a cannon <b>as</b> <b>small</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> twelve-pounder. Its garrison consisted of 49 men under Captain Samuel T. Dyson, of the United States Army's Corps of Artillery, and elements of the U.S. 9th and 12th Infantry Regiments.|$|E
25|$|Aside {{from the}} common {{morphology}} shared by radiolarians such as the axopodia, nucleus and metabolic organelles in internal endoplasm and the separation of external and internal endoplasm by the central capsule, most species of Collodaria form colonies in nature. Anderson et al. (1999) observed that the colony shapes are not species-specific. Colonial Collodarian cells can agglutinate in a gelatinous matrix that can be <b>as</b> <b>small</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> few mm to as large as 3 m in length. There have been observations of large solitary species (up to a few mm). Three types of skeleton are observed in Collodaria: some species create shell-like skeleton around the central capsule, others form silica spicules or have no mineral structures. The shape of central capsules and density of cytoplasmic vacuoles can vary among species and {{may serve as a}} distinguishing taxonomic character such as the separation of the genera Collophidium and Collozoum within the family of Sphaerozoidae.|$|E

50|$|Head cut in stream {{geomorphology}} is an erosional {{feature of}} some intermittent and perennial streams where an abrupt vertical drop, also known <b>as</b> <b>a</b> knickpoint {{in the stream}} bed occurs. The knickpoint, where a head cut begins, can be <b>as</b> <b>small</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> overly-steep riffle zone or <b>as</b> <b>a</b> large <b>as</b> <b>a</b> waterfall. When not flowing, the head cut will resemble a very short cliff or bluff. A small plunge pool may be present {{at the base of}} the head cut due to the high energy of falling water. As erosion of the knickpoint and the streambed continues, the head cut will migrate upstream.|$|R
25|$|Relevant is {{the fact}} that {{certainty}} is never absolute in practice (and not just because of David Hume's problem of induction). The equations of Newtonian mechanics can exhibit sensitive dependence on initial conditions. This {{is an example of the}} butterfly effect, which is one of the subjects of chaos theory. The idea is that something even <b>as</b> <b>small</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> butterfly could cause a chain reaction leading to a hurricane years later. Consequently, even a very small error in knowledge of initial conditions can result in arbitrarily large deviations from predicted behavior. Chaos theory thus explains why it may be practically impossible to predict real life, whether determinism is true or false. On the other hand, the issue may not be so much about human abilities to predict or attain certainty as much as it is the nature of reality itself. For that, a closer, scientific look at nature is necessary.|$|E
25|$|Centimetric radar, made {{possible}} by the cavity magnetron, allowed for the detection of much smaller objects and the use of much smaller antennas. The combination of small-cavity magnetrons, small antennas, and high resolution allowed small, high quality radars to be installed in aircraft. They could be used by maritime patrol aircraft to detect objects <b>as</b> <b>small</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> submarine periscope, which allowed aircraft to attack and destroy submerged submarines which had previously been undetectable from the air. Centimetric contour mapping radars like H2S improved the accuracy of Allied bombers used in the strategic bombing campaign, despite the existence of the German FuG 350 Naxos device to specifically detect it. Centimetric gun-laying radars were likewise far more accurate than the older technology. They made the big-gunned Allied battleships more deadly and, along with the newly developed proximity fuze, made anti-aircraft guns much more dangerous to attacking aircraft. The two coupled together and used by anti-aircraft batteries, placed along the flight path of German V-1 flying bombs on their way to London, are credited with destroying many of the flying bombs before they reached their target.|$|E
500|$|The Virgin Islands dwarf sphaero has a {{deep brown}} colour on its upper side, often with a speckling of darker scales.
