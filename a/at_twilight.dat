5|$|Bats can be {{a tourist}} attraction. The Congress Avenue Bridge in Austin, Texas is the summer home to North America's largest urban bat colony, an {{estimated}} 1,500,000 Mexican free-tailed bats. An estimated 100,000 tourists per year visit the bridge <b>at</b> <b>twilight</b> to watch the bats leave the roost.|$|E
5|$|Fork-marked lemurs are {{sensitive}} to light intensity, and emerge <b>at</b> <b>twilight,</b> calling numerous times and answering their neighbors' calls before going off to forage. Just before dawn, they also communicate again {{on their way to}} their sleep site. Cold temperatures can also cause individuals to retire to their sleeping site as early as two hours before dawn. Their eye shine creates a unique pattern among lemurs because they tend to bob their heads up and down and from side to side.|$|E
5|$|From {{an early}} age, Reines {{exhibited}} {{an interest in}} science, and liked creating and building things. He later recalled that: The first stirrings of interest in science that I remember occurred during a moment of boredom at religious school, when, looking {{out of the window}} <b>at</b> <b>twilight</b> through a hand curled to simulate a telescope, I noticed something peculiar about the light; it was the phenomenon of diffraction. That began for me a fascination with light.|$|E

5|$|In the wilderness, males seldom {{live longer}} than 10 to 14 years, as {{injuries}} sustained from continual fighting with rival males greatly reduce their life span. In captivity they can live more than 20 years. They typically inhabit savanna and grassland, although they may take to bush and forest. Lions are unusually social compared to other cats. A pride of lions consists of related females and offspring and {{a small number of}} adult males. Groups of female lions typically hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. Lions are apex and keystone predators, although they are also expert scavengers obtaining over 50 percent of their food by scavenging as opportunity allows. While lions do not typically hunt humans, some have. Sleeping mainly during the day, lions are active primarily at night (nocturnal), although sometimes <b>at</b> <b>twilight</b> (crepuscular).|$|E
5|$|The sultan besieged him and {{discovered}} {{him in a}} certain mountain where the Wallachian {{was supported by the}} natural strength of the place. There Vlad had hidden himself along with 24,000 of his men who had willingly followed him. When Vlad realized that he would either perish from hunger or {{fall into the hands of}} the very cruel enemy, and considering both eventualities unworthy of brave men, he dared commit an act worthy of being remembered: calling his men together and explaining the situation to them, he easily persuaded them to enter the enemy camp. He divided the men so that either they should die bravely in battle with glory and honor or else, should destiny prove favorable to them, they should avenge themselves against the enemy in an exceptional matter. So, making use of some Turkish prisoners, who had been caught <b>at</b> <b>twilight</b> when they were wandering about imprudently, at nightfall Vlad penetrated into the Turkish camp with part of his troops, all the way up the fortifications. And during the entire night he sped like lightning in every direction and caused great slaughter, so much so that, had the other commander to whom he had entrusted his remaining forces been equally brave, or had the Turks not fully obeyed the repeated orders from the sultan not to abandon their garrisons, the Wallachian undoubtedly would have gained the greatest and most brilliant victory. But the other commander (a boyar named Galeş) did not dare attack the camp from the other side as had been agreed upon....Vlad carried out an incredible massacre without losing many men in such a major encounter, though many were wounded. He abandoned the enemy camp before daybreak and returned to the same mountain from which he had come. No one dared pursue him, since he had caused such terror and turmoil. I learned by questioning those who had participated in this battle that the sultan lost all confidence in the situation. During that night the sultan abandoned the camp and fled in a shameful manner. And he would have continued to this way, had he not been reprimanded by his friends and brought back, almost against his will.|$|E

25|$|Independently {{of whether}} they are or not copulating, females do not move {{more than a few}} centimeters from their {{eclosion}} site until they are able to fly away, usually <b>at</b> <b>twilight.</b> Females start preparing for flight by fanning their wings. Frequently, fanning begins during mating and is often the first sign of its end as females fly away soon after.|$|E
25|$|The large eyes of Protoceratops {{has been}} {{suggested}} as evidence for a nocturnal lifestyle. However, subsequent comparisons between the scleral rings of Protoceratops and modern birds and reptiles have indicated a more cathemeral lifestyle, being active throughout the day during short intervals. This suggests that the fight between Protoceratops and the primarily nocturnal Velociraptor indicated by the fighting specimens may have occurred <b>at</b> <b>twilight</b> or under low-light conditions.|$|E

25|$|These {{aggressive}} and typically solitary sea creatures {{spend most of}} their time hiding in rock formations or burrowing intricate passageways in the sea bed. They rarely exit their homes except to feed and relocate, and can be active during the day, nocturnal, or active primarily <b>at</b> <b>twilight,</b> depending on the species. Unlike most crustaceans, they sometimes hunt, chase, and kill prey. Although some live in temperate seas, most species live in tropical and subtropical waters in the Indian and Pacific Oceans between eastern Africa and Hawaii.|$|E

An enemy plane, a harbinger of the coming kamikaze campaign, crashed on Franklins deck abaft the aircraft carrier's island, sliding across the deck and into the water on her starboard beam.|$|E
25|$|During the Arameans' {{siege of}} Samaria, four leprous {{men at the}} gate asked each other why they should die there of starvation, when they might go to the Arameans, who would either save them or leave them no worse than they were. When <b>at</b> <b>twilight,</b> {{they went to the}} Arameans' camp, there was no one there, for God had made the Arameans hear chariots, horses, and a great army, and fearing the Hittites and the Egyptians, they fled, leaving their tents, their horses, their donkeys, and their camp. The lepers went into a tent, ate and drank, and carried away silver, gold, and {{clothing}} from the tents and hid it.|$|E

She collected {{a few of her}} many adult tales into volumes, Miss Eyre of Boston and Some Women's Hearts. It is in Boston that she did the greater part of her work, including her books of travel, Random Rambles and Lazy Tours, published her four volumes of poetry, and edited and prefaced biographies, A Last Harvest and Garden Secrets, and the Collected Poems of Philip Bourke Marston, as well as a selection from Arthur O'Shaughnessy's verses.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to Orion, {{it is in}} the period November–January (summer in the Southern Hemisphere, winter in the Northern Hemisphere) when Ophiuchus is in the daytime sky and thus not visible at most latitudes. However, for much of the Arctic Circle in the Northern Hemisphere's winter months, the Sun is below the horizon even at midday. Stars (and thus parts of Ophiuchus, especially Rasalhague) are then visible <b>at</b> <b>twilight</b> for a few hours around local noon, low in the South. In the Northern Hemisphere's spring and summer months, when Ophiuchus is normally visible in the night sky, the constellation is actually not visible, at those times and places in the Arctic when midnight sun obscures the stars. In countries close to the equator Ophiuchus appears overhead in June around midnight and in the October evening sky.|$|E
25|$|We {{assume the}} world {{was created in the}} Hebrew month of Nissan, not Tishrei. So hour 1 (sunset) on Wednesday on this chart {{represents}} the beginning of Tekufat Nissan (Spring) {{in the first year of}} creation, the Hebrew year 1. For the purpose of Birkat Hachama, the calculation of Samuel of Nehardea for the length of a tropical year is used not the more accurate calculation of Adda bar Ahavah. Therefore, a year is assumed to be 52 weeks and 1 day and 6 hours (365.25 days). This means that a year after creation Tekufat Nissan will occur 1 day and 6 hours later on this chart, or on Thursday at the 6th hour, Jupiter. Each year this will shift another day and 6 hours. It will take 28 years for Tekufat Nissan to return to being on Wednesday <b>at</b> <b>twilight.</b> It is worth noting that the true spring equinox occurs on March 21 yet Birkat Hachama is said 18 days later. This inaccuracy accrued over thousands of years as a result of using the inexact calculation of Samuel for the length of the year.|$|E

500|$|Coward's {{final stage}} success came with Suite in Three Keys (1966), a trilogy {{set in a}} hotel {{penthouse}} suite.

[...] The trilogy gained glowing reviews and did good box office business in the UK. In {{one of the three}} plays, A Song <b>at</b> <b>Twilight,</b> Coward abandoned his customary reticence on the subject and played an explicitly homosexual character. The daring piece earned Coward new critical praise. He intended to star in the trilogy on Broadway but was too ill to travel. Only two of the Suite in Three Keys plays were performed in New York, with the title changed to Noël Coward in Two Keys, starring Hume Cronyn.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Observational data {{collected}} {{in the field and}} in enclosures show that diurnal, burrow-dwelling European ground squirrels (Spermophilus citellus) never were above ground during <b>twilight</b> <b>at</b> dawn or at dusk. The animals emerged on average 4. 02 h (SD = 0. 45) after civil <b>twilight</b> <b>at</b> dawn and retreated in their burrows on average 2. 87 h (SD = 0. 47) before civil <b>twilight</b> <b>at</b> dusk. Daily patterns of light perceived by these burrowing mammals were measured with light-sensitive radio collar transmitters in an enclosure (the Netherlands) and in the field (Hungary). The observational data are corroborated by the telemetry data, which show clear daily patterns of timing of light perception including light perceived from the burrow entrances. The first light was observed by the animals on average 3. 54 h (enclosure, SD = 0. 45) and 3. 60 h (field, SD = 0. 31) after civil <b>twilight</b> <b>at</b> dawn, whereas the final observed light was on average 3. 04 h (enclosure, SD = 0. 64) and 2. 02 h (field, SD = 0. 72) before civil <b>twilight</b> <b>at</b> dusk.
