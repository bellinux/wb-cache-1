5|$|In the Spanish {{armament}} of 1790, Seymour {{was called}} to service {{in command of the}} ship of the line HMS Canada, opening his commission with a cruise off the Isle of Wight. Passing through shallow water, Seymour ordered the use of a lead line to measure the depth ahead, but was accidentally struck in the head by the lead weight while soundings were being taken. Although little immediate damage seemed to have been caused, during the firing of a salute several days later Seymour suddenly suffered a severely <b>adverse</b> <b>reaction</b> and had to be taken ashore for emergency medical treatment. The head injury rendered him unable to endure any loud noises or bright lights and {{for the next three years}} he lived as an invalid at his country estate in Hambleton. By 1793 he was sufficiently recovered to return to service, and escorted Lord Hood to the Mediterranean in HMS Leviathan. There Hood led the occupation, defence and ultimate withdrawal from Toulon during the Republican siege of the city. Following the collapse of the city's defences, Seymour was sent back to England with dispatches but returned shortly afterward to convoy Leviathan back to Britain.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Injectable fillers and botulinumtoxin {{dominate}} the aesthetic dermatology. {{they are supposed}} to be safe; however, <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> occur that have severe impact on the patient's quality of life. Mechanisms leading to <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> are unknown so far. Here we present data to frequency and type of <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> in a high-risk area such as the glabella, <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> due to the consecutive injection of more than one filler in one facial region, and the current knowledge of treatment. Methods:	The IFS - study is a partially population-based registry for <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> to injectable fillers. Most data was analysed descriptively. Results: Type and frequency of <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> in the glabella do not differ significantly from those in other facial regions. Vascular complication are rare. The consecutive injection of more than one filler in the same facial region does not seem to increase the risk of advers reactions. In all patients - with and without treatment - <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> improved with time. Reactions to permanent fillers were more severe and long-lasting. Discussion: Our data show that <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> in the glabella are similar to those in other facial regions, that the combination of different fillers in one facial region does not seem to increase the risk of <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions,</b> and that the type of filler used influences severity and, therefore, treatment of <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions...</b>|$|R

MethodsBased on various qualitative data collected from five districts of Orissa, India, where MDA had been implemented during 2002 and 2004. The qualitative surveys included focus group discussions with community members and health workers, and semi-structured interviews with key informants in the community, medical officers at primary health centres, district level health officers and private practitioners. ResultsIt showed that many people suffered from <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions,</b> though the reactions were not serious. The paper reported different ways of management of <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> at the community level. The impact of <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> on MDA compliance was serious, as many people did not consume the drug due to fear of <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions.</b> The rumours of <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> and news in media deterred people from consuming the tablets.

40|$|Kenji Inoue Inouye Eye Hospital, Tokyo, Japan Abstract: Glaucoma is a chronic, {{progressive}} disease in which retinal ganglion cells ­disappear and subsequent, gradual {{reductions in the}} visual field ensues. Glaucoma eye drops have hypotensive effects and like all other medications are associated with <b>adverse</b> effects. <b>Adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> may either result from the main agent or from preservatives used in the drug vehicle. The preservative benzalkonium chloride, is one such compound that causes frequent <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> such as superficial punctate keratitis, corneal erosion, conjunctival allergy, and conjunctival injection. <b>Adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> related to main hypotensive agents have been divided into those affecting the eye and those affecting the entire body. In particular, β-blockers frequently cause systematic <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions,</b> including bradycardia, decrease in blood pressure, irregular pulse and asthma attacks. Prostaglandin analogs have distinctive local <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions,</b> including eyelash bristling/lengthening, eyelid pigmentation, iris pigmentation, and upper eyelid deepening. No systemic <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> {{have been linked to}} prostaglandin analog eye drop usage. These <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> may be minimized when they are detected early and prevented by reducing the number of different eye drops used (via fixed combination eye drops), reducing the number of times eye drops are administered, using benzalkonium chloride-free eye drops, using lower concentration eye drops, and providing proper drop instillation training. Additionally, a one-time topical medication can be given to patients to allow observation of any <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions,</b> thereafter the preparation of a topical medication with the fewest known <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> can be prescribed. This does require precise patient monitoring and inquiries about patient symptoms following medication use.

30|$|Contrast {{media are}} {{currently}} used for imaging {{at least one}} to 70 million times {{per year in the}} United States (Christiansen 2005). Computed tomography (CT) examination with administration of contrast media causes a risk of developing <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> to the contrast media. Compared with the use of ionic contrast media, nonionic low osmolality contrast media (LOCMs) have been associated with a reduced overall prevalence of <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> (Grant and Camamo 1997; Jacobs et al. 1998). However, <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> due to nonionic LOCMs remain an important cause of admissions to the emergency room (ER). Furthermore, the lower incidence of <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> resulted in fewer opportunities to develop and maintain these necessary skills (Segal and Bush 2011). In the present study, we evaluated the characteristics of patients transferred from the CT room to the ER with moderate or severe <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> due to nonionic LOCMs and evaluated the risk factors for severe <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions.</b>|$|R

The median time to progression to AIDS was 14. 9 months in subjects with <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> to TMP-SMZ and 32. 5 months in those without <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions.</b> After exclusion of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) and toxoplasmosis from the case definition of AIDS, the differences in the rate of progression to AIDS between subjects with and without <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> to TMP-SMZ were still highly significant (P =. 004). A low CD 4 + cell count at baseline and the use of antiretroviral agents before the start of prophylaxis were predictors of <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> to TMP-SMZ but did not account for the difference in progression to AIDS between subjects with and without <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> to TMP-SMZ. In a univariate analysis, the relative hazard of <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> to TMP-SMZ for progression to AIDS was 2. 54 (95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 50 - 4. 28); in a multivariate analysis, it was 2. 21 (95 % CI, 1. 29 - 3. 81).

Results: <b>Adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> with a causal relationship classified as definite/probable/possible were 202 (56 %) : 62 % (80 / 129) were due to acute treatments and 53 % (122 / 231) to prophylactic treatments (chi(2) test, P= 0. 115 ns). More than 90 % of the <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> were of limited intensity [mild (58 %) or moderate (36 %) ]. Only 5 % were severe, and two reactions (1 %) were serious. The most affected apparatus was the nervous system (41 %). Of these <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions,</b> 43 % caused the discontinuance of the treatment, especially of prophylaxis (54 %). Patients evaluated 70 % of the medications as effective, but, at the same time, they considered most of the <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> (69 %) unacceptable. Conclusion: <b>Adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> related to headache medications have a strong impact on patients' management, even if their real intensity and severity are usually very limited.

40|$|Background: <b>Adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> to {{intravenous}} iodinated {{contrast media}} may {{be classified as}} general and organ-specific, such as contrast-induced nephrotoxicity.
