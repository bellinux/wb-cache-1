5000|$|Ivo Peters BEM (29 July 1915 - 7 June 1989) was an English railway photographer. Peters {{spent his}} life in Bath, Somerset and {{is best known for}} his <b>amateur</b> {{photographs}} and <b>cine</b> <b>films</b> of steam railways in the British Isles, particularly of the Somerset and Dorset Railway.|$|R
30|$|Manual {{digitisation}} was {{the most}} widespread motion measurement technique for many decades, and prior to digital technologies, <b>cine</b> <b>film</b> <b>cameras</b> were traditionally used [32, 34 – 36]. These were well-suited {{to the field of}} movement analysis due to their high image quality and high-speed frame rates (100  Hz in the aforementioned studies). However, the practicality of this method was limited by long processing times. With the advent of video cameras (initially tape-based before the transition to digital), cine cameras have become essentially redundant in the field of biomechanics. Digital video cameras are now relatively inexpensive, have increasingly high resolutions and fast frame rates (consumer cameras are generally capable of high-definition video at greater than 120  Hz, whereas industrial cameras are significantly faster), and are associated with shorter processing times.|$|R
5000|$|Pete Boone (Peter Warner) first {{appeared}} in [...] "The Rick Ford Files" [...] series in 1980. In 1988, Boone was spun off into a short film that won the Australian <b>Amateur</b> <b>Cine</b> Society International <b>Film</b> Festival award for Best Video. In 1990, Boone was played by Peter Book in a short film which was later remade for TV.|$|R
50|$|The Pines Express {{became known}} as the top express to use the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway (S&DJR); a steeply-graded railway line through {{photogenic}} hilly countryside between Bath Green Park and Bournemouth West station, much loved and sorely missed by enthusiasts. On this line, trains often had to be double-headed due to gradients, producing spectacular photographs and film footage. Ivo Peters, in particular, took many <b>amateur</b> photographs and <b>cine</b> <b>films</b> of the S&DJR.|$|R
50|$|Oskar Barnack, who was {{in charge}} of {{research}} and development at Leitz, decided to investigate using 35 mm <b>cine</b> <b>film</b> for still <b>cameras</b> while attempting to build a compact camera capable of making high-quality enlargements. He built his prototype 35 mm camera (Ur-Leica) around 1913, though further development was delayed for several years by World War I. It wasn't until after World War I that Leica commercialized their first 35mm Cameras. Leitz test-marketed the design between 1923 and 1924, receiving enough positive feedback that the camera was put into production as the Leica I (for Leitz camera) in 1925. The Leica's immediate popularity spawned a number of competitors, most notably the Contax (introduced in 1932), and cemented the position of 35 mm as the format of choice for high-end compact cameras.|$|R

During these two flights of the Space Shuttle Columbia, the astronaut teams of J. Engle and R. Truly, and K. Mattingly II and H. Hartsfield took motion pictures of thunderstorms with a 16 mm <b>cine</b> <b>camera.</b> <b>Film</b> taken during daylight showed interesting thunderstorm cloud formations, where individual frames taken tens of seconds apart, when viewed as stereo pairs, provided information on the three-dimensional structure of the cloud systems. Film taken at night showed clouds illuminated by lightning with discharges that propagated horizontally at speeds of up to 10 to the 5 th m/sec and extended for distances {{on the order of}} 60 km or more...|$|R
5000|$|For <b>cine</b> <b>cameras,</b> <b>film</b> 35 mm {{wide and}} {{perforated}} with sprocket holes was established {{as the standard}} format in the 1890s. It was used for nearly all film-based professional motion picture production. For amateur use, several smaller and therefore less expensive formats were introduced. 17.5 mm film, created by splitting 35 mm film, was one early amateur format, but 9.5 mm film, introduced in Europe in 1922, and 16 mm film, introduced in the US in 1923, soon became the standards for [...] "home movies" [...] in their respective hemispheres. In 1932, the even more economical 8 mm format was created by doubling the number of perforations in 16 mm film, then splitting it, usually after exposure and processing. The Super 8 format, still 8 mm wide but with smaller perforations {{to make room for}} substantially larger film frames, was introduced in 1965.|$|R
