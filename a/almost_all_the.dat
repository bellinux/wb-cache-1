In December 1904 Pope Pius X issued an apostolic constitution consolidating <b>almost</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> previous rules, making some changes, Vacante sede apostolica.

They have been left as originally constructed and there are not any plans to improve upon them, because people are reluctant to tamper with the original shrine complex.|$|E
