40|$|Impact-loaded conical and {{cylindrical}} friction joints are studied theoretically and experimentally. The system considered {{consists of}} a long, straight, cylindrical and linearly elastic rod which is impacted axially at one end, and which has a body attached {{by means of a}} friction joint at the opposite end. The conditions are such that the wave propagation is 1 -D in the rod and can be neglected in the attached body. Slip and energy dissipation due to an impact load are determined. The theoretical results of the impact-loaded conical friction joints exhibit phenomena which sometimes have spectacular appearance. The agreement between theoretical and experimental results is fair. The influence of blow frequency and thrust on the performance of a percussive rock drill is studied theoretically. The drill considered consists of hammer, <b>adapter,</b> <b>rod</b> and bit. Two different rock drills are studied. The first is a simple drill with constant characteristic impedance throughout the drill. The second is a prototype of a high frequency percussive rock drill. The efficiency and the maximum (maximum tensile) and minimum (maximum compressive) stresses are determined. For the simple drill the average efficiency in the range from soft to hard rock is only weakly dependent on the blow frequency up to relatively high blow frequencies but strongly dependent for extremely high blow frequencies. It is also found that the maximum and minimum stresses in the drill in the range from soft to hard rock are only weakly dependent on the blow frequency up to high frequencies but strongly dependent for extremely high frequencies. The maximum stress increases and the minimum stress decreases with thrust. Godkänd; 1986; 20070108 (mlk...|$|E
40|$|The thesis was {{performed}} at Forsmarks Kraftgrupp AB {{in the department}} of mechanical engineering, FTCM.   Forsmark nuclear power plant has had problems with cracks in some of the control rods which are placed in the reactor at Forsmark 3. To investigate the cause of this, material samples were taken from five of the damaged control rods. This sampling of the rods resulted too short rods to be transported in the shipping container to the interim storage facility for used nuclear fuel in Oskarshamn.   Control rods are crucial components in a nuclear reactor, regulating the reactor effect by blocking or unblocking fuel rods. Control rods which have been in the reactor are always handled under water in order to protect against the radiation they emit.   The task was to design a control <b>rod</b> <b>adapter</b> that extends the control rod so transport can be performed from Forsmark. The goal of the work was a complete set of blueprints so the control <b>rod</b> <b>adapter</b> can be manufactured and mounted on the short control rods and then be transported to the interim storage facility.   The work began with mapping of how control rods normally being handled from the reactor to the interim storage facility. With the mapping as a basis, a requirement specification was made. From the specification and the information from the mapping different concepts were sketched. The concepts were evaluated and improved to a final concept, which was then drawn up with the CAD-program Inventor. Materials for the various features were selected and calculations were performed in calculation-program ANSYS 13. 0. Finally, blueprints were produced of the control <b>rod</b> <b>adapter.</b>   The control <b>rod</b> <b>adapter</b> meets the requirement specification. It is easy to mount and has a robust design. A prototype should be manufactured to enable practical testing to verify that the control <b>rod</b> <b>adapter</b> works as planned...|$|R
2500|$|Split-spoon / SPT Sampler. Utilized in the 'Standard Test Method for Standard Penetration Test (SPT) and Split-Barrel Sampling of Soils' (ASTM D 1586). This sampler is {{typically}} an 18"-30" [...] long, 2.0" [...] outside diameter (OD) hollow tube split in half lengthwise. A hardened metal drive shoe with a 1.375" [...] opening {{is attached to}} the bottom end, and a one-way valve and drill <b>rod</b> <b>adapter</b> at the sampler head. It is driven into the ground with a [...] hammer falling 30". [...] The blow counts (hammer strikes) required to advance the sampler a total of 18" [...] are counted and reported. Generally used for non-cohesive soils, samples taken this way are considered disturbed.|$|R
