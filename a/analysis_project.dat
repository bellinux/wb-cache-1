2500|$|In a 1999 {{meeting of}} the Redlands, California city council, Councilman Kasey Haws urged that the Copeland Lowery be hired because [...] "it is {{expected}} that (the cost) will be returned many times over in federal funds received." [...] The initial contract in January 2000 was for $30,000. One year later, the city reported that more than $6 million in federal funding had been dedicated to local interests, including San Timoteo Creek, the Redlands Trolley, a regional crime mapping and <b>analysis</b> <b>project</b> hosted by the police department, and the Redlands Community Center. [...] The city has continued to pay the firm $30,000 per year. (The Center for Public Integrity's database shows [...] "less than $10,000" [...] in fees paid for both 2003 and 2004; the difference was presumably part of the underreporting that was identified in June 2006.) [...] In all, the city estimated that Copeland Lowery helped Redlands secure at least $36.7 million in federal money in six years.|$|E

40|$|An {{analysis}} of the grid generation process {{from the point of}} view of an applied CFD engineer is given. Issues addressed include geometric modeling, structured grid generation, unstructured grid generation, hybrid grid generation and use of virtual parts libraries in large parametric <b>analysis</b> <b>projects.</b> The <b>analysis</b> is geared towards comparing the effective turn around time for specific grid generation and CFD projects. The conclusion was made that a single grid generation methodology is not universally suited for all CFD applications due to both limitations in grid generation and flow solver technology. A new geometric modeling and grid generation tool, CFD-GEOM, is introduced to effectively integrate the geometric modeling process to the various grid generation methodologies including structured, unstructured, and hybrid procedures. The full integration of the geometric modeling and grid generation allows implementation of extremely efficient updating procedures, a necessary requirement for large parametric <b>analysis</b> <b>projects.</b> The concept of using virtual parts libraries in conjunction with hybrid grids for large parametric <b>analysis</b> <b>projects</b> is also introduced to improve the efficiency of the applied CFD engineer...|$|R
