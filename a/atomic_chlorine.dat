Chlorine is found to adsorb on the clean CVD surface with a sticking probability of ~ 0. 001 at 300 K, although this can be enhanced by prehydrogenation of the surface and by raising the substrate temperature. Adsorbed chlorine desorbs from the surface over a wide temperature range below 500 °C, and is also very efficiently etched away by <b>atomic</b> hydrogen. <b>Chlorine</b> has therefore little tendency to poison the growth surface, and thus is capable of acting as a catalyst for low temperature growth.

While there are natural sources {{for all of}} these species, the concentrations of chlorine and bromine increased markedly in recent decades because of the release of large quantities of man-made organohalogen compounds, especially chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and bromofluorocarbons. These highly stable compounds are capable of surviving the rise to the stratosphere, where Cl and Br radicals are liberated by the action of ultraviolet light. Each radical is then free to initiate and catalyze a chain reaction capable of breaking down over 100,000 ozone molecules.

40|$|A novel {{method of}} {{producing}} atomic hydrogen and the active carbon species necessary for d iamond {{chemical vapor deposition}} (CVD) has been demonstrated. This method starts with the generation of <b>atomic</b> <b>chlorine</b> f rom the thermal dissociatidn of molecular chlorine in a resistively heated graphite furnace at temperatures f rom 1300 - 1500 ~ Atomic hydrogen and the carbon precursors are subsequently p roduced through rapid hydrogen abstraction reactions of <b>atomic</b> <b>chlorine</b> with molecular hydrogen and hydrocarbons {{at the point where}} they mix. It was found that the quality of the d iamond deposits depends on both substrate temperatures and H 2 /C 12 mole ratios. Substrate temperatures are found to be- 150 lower than for a hydrogen/hydrocarbon hot fi lament system for similar g rowth rates. Numerous CVD methods have been developed and em-ployed in the synthesis of polycrystalline diamond. 1 - 7 It is generally accepted that the CVD of diamond requires high energy to activate carbon species and to generate atomic hydrogen. Currently, there are five major CVD diamond processes, namely, hot filament, combustion, microwave plasma, RF plasma, and plasma arc deposition. All of these processes involve gas temperatures greater than 2000 ~ In hot filament CVD one has to consider the possible incorpo-ration of the filament metal into diamond. Also, in the hot filament, and especially the plasma activation methods, one is likely to create active nitrogen species which are then responsible for nitrogen incorporation in diamond. Nitro-gen impurities are known to affect electrical, thermal, and optical properties of diamond. 8 In this paper, we present a novel method which allows generation of atomic hydrogen and thus CVD diamond at lower gas process temperatures. This is accomplished by first generating <b>atomic</b> <b>chlorine</b> by thermally dissociating molecular chlorine and subse-quently mixing the <b>atomic</b> <b>chlorine</b> with molecular hydro-gen downstream. <b>Atomic</b> <b>chlorine</b> is known to rapidly react with molecular hydrogen 9 so that the ratio of atomic hydro-gen to <b>atomic</b> <b>chlorine</b> is quickly established by the ratio of H 2 to HC 1 through the following steady-state equilibrium...|$|E

Homoepitaxial diamond growth on diamond substrates has been studied over the substrate temperature range of 100 - 950 C.

This is unique because the traditional diamond deposition using H 2 /CH 4 systems usually disappears at substrate temperatures below approx. 500 deg. C.

5000|$|The {{standard}} {{atomic weight}} (commonly called [...] "atomic weight") of an element {{is the average}} of the atomic masses of all the chemical element's isotopes as found in a particular environment, weighted by isotopic abundance, relative to the atomic mass unit (u).

50|$|The {{quantity}} of wastewater and the unpreparedness of sewage plants to treat wastewater, {{is an issue}} in Pennsylvania. The Associated Press has reported that starting in 2011, the DEP strongly resisted providing the AP and other news organizations with information about complaints related to drilling. When waste brine is discharged to surface waters through conventional wastewater treatment plants, the bromide in the brine usually is not captured. Although not a health hazard by itself, in western Pennsylvania some downstream drinking water treatment plants using the surface water experienced increases in brominated trihalomethanes in 2009 and 2010. Trihalomethanes, undesirable byproducts of the chlorination process, form when the chlorine combines with dissolved organic matter in the source water, to form the trihalomethane chloroform. Bromine can substitute for some chlorine, forming brominated trihalomethanes. Because bromine has a higher <b>atomic</b> weight than <b>chlorine,</b> the partial conversion to brominated trihalomethanes increases the concentration by weight of total trihalomethanes.|$|R
30|$|In {{governing}} the mechanisms responsible for diverse ligand–protein complex {{systems such as}} the one mentioned above, non-covalent intermolecular forces play a pivotal role. Elucidation and quantification of non-covalent forces are central to pharmaceutical drug-design and lead optimization. Important non-covalent interactions include hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions, stacking interactions (cation–pi, anion–pi or pi–pi), van der Walls forces, and hydrophobic interactions (Meyer et al. 2003; Cerný and Hobza 2007; Dougherty 2007; Wheeler and Bloom 2014; Wheeler 2011; Varma et al. 2010). Recent years have witnessed the importance of non-covalent interactions involving halogen atoms, otherwise termed as halogen bonding, due to their intriguing chemical features. Halogen bonds have been identified in many of biological low-mass compounds and in complexes of biomolecules with halogenated ligands. Halogen atoms can either function as electrophilic species or as nucleophilic Lewis bases and display anisotropic charge distribution along the region of a C–X bond with an equatorial distribution of negative and positive charges—thereby creating what is called a σ-hole. A σ-hole maintains a diminished electron density site and entices an electronegative site of another molecule to interact. Such cases occur, especially those with larger <b>atomic</b> radii (<b>chlorine,</b> bromine and iodine) (Lu et al. 2009, 2012; Sirimulla et al. 2013). On the other hand, drug candidates containing fluorine show increased metabolic stability and membrane permeation, hence use of them has become commonplace. The small-size and very high electronegativity of fluorine attribute to its eccentric behaviors, which in turn contribute to its versatile interactions in biomolecular receptor-ligand moieties (Hagmann 2008; Smart 2001; Zhou et al. 2009).|$|R
