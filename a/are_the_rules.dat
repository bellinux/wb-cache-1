500|$|In Part I, Varner offers {{considerable}} {{endorsement of}} Harean philosophy. Varner interprets Hare as understanding that utilitarianism derives from prescriptivism, and affirms Hare's argument on this point. He {{goes on to}} discuss the utility of Intuitive-Level System (ILS) rules; these <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> that one lives by in day-to-day life, which, though ultimately justified by it, do not derive their content from utilitarian calculation. There are, for Varner, four key kinds of ILSs: [...] "common morality, personal morality, professional ethics, and laws". Though these are deontological in [...] "flavor", following the precepts of these ILSs is generally justified under two-level utilitarianism. Further arguments—these are original, rather than being derived from Hare's own—are then offered for Hare's prescriptivism.|$|E

The FBI ended up treating Mihdhar as an intelligence case, which meant that the FBI's criminal investigators could not work on the case, due to the barrier separating intelligence and criminal case operations. [...] An agent in the New York office sent an e-mail to FBI headquarters saying, [...] "Whatever has happened to this, someday someone will die, and the public will not understand why we were not more effective and throwing every resource we had at certain 'problems.'"

2500|$|Since it is {{not written}} in terms of reactions, {{but in terms of}} more general [...] "reaction rules" [...] {{encompassing}} sets of reactions, this kind of specification is often called [...] "rule-based". This description of the system in terms of modular rules relies on the assumption that only a subset of features or attributes are relevant for a particular reaction rule. Where this assumption holds, a set of reactions can be coarse-grained into one reaction rule. This coarse-graining preserves the important properties of the underlying reactions. For instance, if the reactions are based on chemical kinetics, so <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> derived from them.|$|E

The Job Shop Scheduling Problem <b>is</b> one of <b>the</b> NP hard optimization problems, {{and it is}} difficult to obtain the exact optimal solution. Scheduling methods based on <b>the</b> dispatch <b>rule</b> <b>are</b> a set of efficient approximate methods. In this paper, by combining several dispatch rules, we have proposed three new <b>rules.</b> <b>The</b> first <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> that combines two simple dispatch rules which are often adopted in actual production systems. <b>The</b> proposed <b>rule</b> gives better result than that of any single dispatch <b>rule.</b> <b>The</b> second <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> that keeps balance of remaining load of all machines. In this <b>rule,</b> <b>the</b> weight <b>is</b> decided in early stage of the schedule. It gives good solutions with high probability. <b>The</b> third <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> that predetermines <b>the</b> mixing ratio, which accompanies a sequence of operations. This rule often gives better results than any other dispatch rules...|$|R
