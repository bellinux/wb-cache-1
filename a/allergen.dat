5|$|Mup {{genes from}} other mammals also encode {{allergenic}} proteins, for example Feld4 is primarily {{produced in the}} submandibular salivary gland and is deposited onto dander as the cat grooms itself. A study found that 63% of cat allergic people have antibodies against the protein. Most had higher titres of antibodies against Feld4 than against Feld1, another prominent cat <b>allergen.</b> Likewise, Equc1 (Equus caballus <b>allergen</b> 1) is the protein product of a horse Mup gene that {{is found in the}} liver, sublingual and submaxillary salivary glands. It is responsible for about 80% of the antibody response in patients who are chronically exposed to horse allergens.|$|E
5|$|One form {{of apple}} allergy, {{often found in}} {{northern}} Europe, is called birch-apple syndrome, and is found in people who are also allergic to birch pollen. Allergic reactions are triggered by a protein in apples {{that is similar to}} birch pollen, and people affected by this protein can also develop allergies to other fruits, nuts, and vegetables. Reactions, which entail oral allergy syndrome (OAS), generally involve itching and inflammation of the mouth and throat, but in rare cases can also include life-threatening anaphylaxis. This reaction only occurs when raw fruit is consumed—the <b>allergen</b> is neutralized in the cooking process. The variety of apple, maturity and storage conditions can change the amount of <b>allergen</b> present in individual fruits. Long storage times can increase the amount of proteins that cause birch-apple syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with other}} members of the lipocalin protein family, major urinary {{proteins}} can be potent allergens to humans. The reason for this is not known, however molecular mimicry between Mups and structurally similar human lipocalins has been proposed as a possible explanation. The protein product of the mouse Mup17 gene, known as Musm1, Ag1 or MA1, accounts for much of the allergenic properties of mouse urine. The protein is extremely stable in the environment; studies have found 95% of inner city homes, and 82% of all types of homes in the United States have detectable levels in at least one room. Similarly, Ratn1 is a known human <b>allergen.</b> A US study found its presence in 33% of inner city homes, and 21% of occupants were sensitized to the <b>allergen.</b> Exposure and sensitization to rodent Mup proteins is considered a risk factor for childhood asthma, and is a leading cause of laboratory animal allergy (LAA)—an occupational disease of laboratory animal technicians and scientists. One study found that two-thirds of laboratory workers who had developed asthmatic reactions to animals had antibodies to Ratn1.|$|E

However, food may play a minor role in respiratory allergy, and allergy to food may contribute to respiratory symptoms by increasing bronchial hyperresponsiveness. In this study, we examined serum levels of specific IgE antibodies to food <b>allergens</b> and inhalant <b>allergens</b> in bronchial asthma patients. Rice, wheat, soybean, corn and potato were selected as food <b>allergens</b> in this study. The positive ratio of IgE RAST (radioallergosorbent test) to potato was highest and that to rice was lowest among the five food <b>allergens</b> tested. High positivities of specific IgE antibodies to food <b>allergens</b> did not correlate to patient age or age at onset, and were found in patients {{with high levels of}} serum IgE.

Their allergenicities were assayed by en-zyme-linked immunosorbent assay inhibition tests, immu-noblots, basophil activation test, and skin prick tests. Eight of them are the first report as D. farinae <b>allergens.</b> The procedure of using a proteomic approach combined with a purely discovery approach using sera of patients with broad IgE reactivity profiles to mite <b>allergens</b> was an effective method to investigate a more complete reper-toire of D. farinae <b>allergens.</b> The identification of eight new D. farinae <b>allergens</b> will be helpful for HDM allergy diagnosis and therapy, especially for patients without re-sponse for HDM major <b>allergens.</b> In addition, the current work significantly extendedthe repertoire of D. farinae <b>allergens.</b> Molecular & Cellular Proteomics 12 : 10. 1074...|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to serving as social cues {{between members of}} the same species, Mups can act as kairomones—chemical signals that transmit information between species. Mice are instinctively afraid of the smell of their natural predators, including cats and rats. This occurs even in laboratory mice that have been isolated from predators for hundreds of generations. When the chemical cues responsible for the fear response were purified from cat saliva and rat urine, two homologous protein signals were identified: Feld4 (Felis domesticus <b>allergen</b> 4), the product of the cat Mup gene, and Ratn1 (Rattus norvegicus <b>allergen</b> 1), the product of the rat Mup13 gene. Mice are fearful of these Mups even when they are made in bacteria, but mutant animals that are unable to detect the Mups showed no fear of rats, demonstrating their importance in initiating fearful behaviour. It is not known exactly how Mups from different species initiate disparate behaviours, but mouse Mups and predator Mups have been shown to activate unique patterns of sensory neurons in the nose of recipient mice. This implies the mouse perceives them differently, via distinct neural circuits. The pheromone receptors responsible for Mup detection are also unknown, though they are thought be members of the V2R receptor class.|$|E

5|$|The {{greens are}} edible as a leaf vegetable, but are rarely eaten by humans; some sources {{suggest that the}} greens contain toxic alkaloids.

Some people are allergic to carrots. In a 2010 study on the prevalence of food allergies in Europe, 3.6 percent of young adults showed some degree of sensitivity to carrots. Because the major carrot <b>allergen,</b> the protein Dauc c 1.0104, is cross-reactive with homologues in birch pollen (Bet v 1) and mugwort pollen (Art v 1), most carrot allergy sufferers are also allergic to pollen from these plants.|$|E
5|$|Their sting {{generally}} only {{causes a}} mild local reaction in humans; however, {{it is one}} of the few ant species that can be dangerous to humans, along with other ants in the genus Myrmecia. The ant venom is particularly immunogenic for an insect venom; the venom causes about 90% of Australian ant allergies. In endemic areas, up to 3% of the human population has developed an allergy to the venom and about half of these allergic people can suffer from anaphylactic reactions (increased heart rate, falling blood pressure, and other symptoms), which can lead to death on rare occasions. Between 1980 and 2000, there were four deaths due to anaphylaxis from jack jumper stings, all of them in Tasmania. Individuals prone to severe allergic reactions caused by the ant's sting can be treated with <b>allergen</b> immunotherapy (desensitisation).|$|E

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Early-onset atopic {{dermatitis}} (AD) {{is a particular}} phenotype that may convey a risk of developing multiple sensitizations to <b>allergens</b> but {{little is known about}} the pathway of sensitization. The aims of this study were to describe the natural history of sensitization to <b>allergens</b> for this phenotype and to identify the most predictive marker associated with the risk of developing sensitization to inhaled <b>allergens</b> in a well-selected cohort of infants with AD. METHODS: Infants with active AD were enrolled and prospectively explored for biological markers of atopy every year until the age of 6 yr. Allergic sensitization was defined as the presence of positive specific IgEs to <b>allergens</b> and multiple sensitizations as being sensitized to ≥ 2 <b>allergens.</b> Elevated blood eosinophilia was defined as an eosinophil blood count ≥ 470 eosinophils/mm 3 and elevated total IgE as a serum IgE level ≥ 45 kU/l. RESULTS: Two hundred and twenty-nine infants were included. Elevated blood eosinophilia was observed at baseline in 60 children (26. 2 %) and elevated total IgE in 85 (37. 1 %). When elevated at baseline, eosinophilia and IgE levels remained significantly higher during the follow-up period. Sensitization to food <b>allergens</b> decreased from 58 % to 34 %, whereas sensitization to inhaled <b>allergens</b> increased over time from 17 % to 67 %. Initial multiple sensitizations to food <b>allergens</b> were the most predictive factor for the risk of developing sensitization to inhaled <b>allergens</b> at 6 yr (OR 3. 72 [1. 68 - 8. 30] p < 0. 001).
