40|$|Research objective: Much of {{the work}} on {{estimating}} health care costs attributable to smoking has failed to capture the effects and related costs of smoking during pregnancy. The goal {{of this study is}} to use data on smoking behavior, birth outcomes and resource utilization to estimate neonatal costs attributable to maternal smoking during pregnancy. Study design: We use 1995 data from the Center for Disease Control's (CDC) Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) database. The PRAMS collects representative samples of births from 13 states (Alabama, Alaska, California, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Maine, Michigan, New York (excluding New York City), Oklahoma, South Carolina, Washington, and West Virginia), and the District of Columbia. The 1995 PRAMS sample is approximately 25 000. Multivariate analysis is used to estimate the relationship of smoking to probability of admission to an NICU and, separately, the length of stay for those admitted or not admitted to an NICU. Neonatal costs are predicted for infants 'as is' and 'as if' their mother did not smoke. The difference between these constitutes smoking attributable neonatal costs; this divided by total neonatal costs constitutes the smoking attributable fraction (SAF). We use data from the MarketScan™ database of the MedStat™ Corporation to attach average dollar amounts to NICU and non-NICU nursery nights and data from the 1997 birth certificates to extrapolate the SAFs and <b>attributable</b> <b>expenses</b> to all states. Principal findings: The analysis showed that maternal smoking increased the relative risk of admission to an NICU by almost 20 %. For infants admitted to the NICU, maternal smoking increased length of stay while for non- NICU infants it appeared to lower it. Over all births, however, smoking increased infant length of stay by 1. 1 %. NICU infants cost $ 2496 per night while in the NICU and $ 1796 while in a regular nursery compared to only $ 748 for non-NICU infants. The combination of the increased NICU use, longer stays and higher costs result in a positive smoking attributable fraction (SAF) for neonatal costs. The SAF across all states is 2. 2 %. Across the states, the SAF varied from a low of 1. 3 % in Texas to a high of 4. 6 % in Indiana. Conclusions: These results further confirm the adverse effects of smoking. Among mothers who smoke, smoking adds over $ 700 in neonatal costs. The smoking attributable neonatal costs in the US represent almost $ 367 million in 1996 dollars; these costs vary from less than a million in smaller states to over $ 35 million in California. These costs are highly preventable since the adverse effects of maternal smoking occur in the short-run and can be avoided by even a temporary cessation of maternal smoking. These cost estimates can be used by managed care plans, state and local public health officials and others to evaluate alternative smoking cessation programs.

The paper shows that, for any system of taxing foreign income, the consistent and efficient treatment is to permit domestic expense deductions for all expenses incurred domestically.

This paper analyzes mortality of children < 2 years of age affiliated with this program and out-of-pocket <b>expenses</b> <b>attributable</b> to this event. MethodsAn in-home survey addressed to determine the health conditions of children affiliated with MISXXI {{was carried out in}} all Mexican states. If the infant had died, information was collected with emphasis on diagnosis (death certificate), medical attention and out-of-pocket expenses. Diagnoses were classified in agreement with ICD- 10. ResultsOf 9181 children, 74 died by the time during which the survey was gathered; 51 % of children died before 28 days. Deaths were attributable to short gestation, low birth weight, asphyxia, or sepsis. In newborns who died before 7 days of age, 95. 7 % received medical care; however, among those who died between 7 and 28 days, only 58 % received medical care. During the neonatal period, medical care was predominantly given in the Ministry of Health facilities. During the post-neonatal period, almost all children received medical care, predominantly in private facilities, a reason for households incurring in out-of-pocket expenditures. ConclusionsMortality of infants who are beneficiaries of MISXXI mainly occurs during the neonatal period; however, households incurred in out-of-pocket expenditures, especially in the post-neonatal period. It seems convenient to boost the access of users to benefits provided by this medical insurance...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Hand hygiene {{noncompliance}} is a {{major cause}} of nosocomial infection. Nosocomial infection cost data exist, but the effect of hand hygiene noncompliance is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To estimate methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) -related cost of an incident of hand hygiene noncompliance by a healthcare worker during patient care. DESIGN: Two models were created to simulate sequential patient contacts by a hand hygiene-noncompliant healthcare worker. Model 1 involved encounters with patients of unknown MRSA status. Model 2 involved an encounter with an MRSA-colonized patient followed by an encounter with a patient of unknown MRSA status. The probability of new MRSA infection for the second patient was calculated using published data. A simulation of 1 million noncompliant events was performed. Total costs of resulting infections were aggregated and amortized over all events. SETTING: Duke University Medical Center, a 750 -bed tertiary medical center in Durham, North Carolina. RESULTS: Model 1 was associated with 42 MRSA infections (infection rate, 0. 0042 %). Mean infection cost was $ 47, 092 (95 % confidence interval [CI], $ 26, 040 -$ 68, 146); mean cost per noncompliant event was $ 1. 98 (95 % CI, $ 0. 91 -$ 3. 04). Model 2 was associated with 980 MRSA infections (0. 098 %). Mean infection cost was $ 53, 598 (95 % CI, $ 50, 098 -$ 57, 097); mean cost per noncompliant event was $ 52. 53 (95 % CI, $ 47. 73 -$ 57. 32). A 200 -bed hospital incurs $ 1, 779, 283 in annual MRSA infection-related <b>expenses</b> <b>attributable</b> to hand hygiene noncompliance. A 1. 0 % increase in hand hygiene compliance resulted in annual savings of $ 39, 650 to a 200 -bed hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Hand hygiene noncompliance is associated with significant attributable hospital costs. Minimal improvements in compliance lead to substantial savings...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1998 This report {{frames the}} debate over studded tires in terms of {{economic}} principles of marginal cost pricing and efficient resource allocation. In the absence of a user tax, the pavement damage caused by studded tires results in inefficient pricing because social costs associated with the damage are excluded from the price paid by consumers. This leads to over use of studded tires. No attempt was made to quantify the safety effects of studded tire use. A review of research literature was provided to qualitatively support the premise that there is no social benefit from studded tires in Oregon. Quantitative cost analysis was limited to pavement rutting on the state highway system that is sufficient to reduce the useful life of the pavement. The cost estimation was conducted in two stages: first, the wear rates for asphalt and Portland cement concrete (PCC) pavement surfaces were estimated, expressed as inches of rut depth per 100, 000 studded tire passes. Linear regression analysis was conducted using rut depth, traffic, and studded tire data from a sample of Oregon highways. A range of wear rates was estimated, reflecting the numerous factors that influence rutting susceptibility of pavements. The mid-points of wear rates for asphalt and PCC were 0. 0386 " and 0. 0093 ", respectively. Second, the wear rate estimates were used to approximate rutting for the state highway system and to predict resurfacing <b>expenses</b> <b>attributable</b> to studded tire traffic. The results indicate that the cost of studded tire damage on Oregon state highways in 1995 was approximately 10 million. This averages to 8 per tire per year. The implications of the cost are then discussed in terms of the allocation effects of underpricing due to an untaxed externality. The external costs pavement damage caused by studded tires result in inefficient pricing because external costs associated with the damage are excluded from the price paid by consumers. This leads to excess use of studded tires. A studded tires tax sufficient to cover attributable maintenance costs would be in the neighborhood of 30...|$|R
