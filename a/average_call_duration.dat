50|$|Quality {{is usually}} {{measured}} by the Answer-Seizure Ratio (ASR = call attempts answered / call attempts), Post-Dial Delay (PDD) and the <b>Average</b> <b>Call</b> <b>Duration</b> (ACD). If the <b>average</b> <b>call</b> <b>duration</b> is very low, it is taken to mean that the call quality is so poor that people cannot have a conversation and hang up. This matters to calling card operators because people do not re-purchase card services that give a low ACD. In case of significant discrepancies in ACD values across available routes, the carrier shall prioritize the routes offering higher ACD. A low ASR is taken to mean that callers cannot get through {{to the other end}} and hence that the route is congested or is of low quality. The low ASR is not as bad as low ACD, because it suggests at least a proper answer supervision (i.e. correct signaling), and therefore the handover mechanism can reroute calls via other available routes. An on-line monitoring system of a quality based routing is publicly available for a demo traffic. Post-dial delay is the time from dialing the last digit to the time a caller hears ringing.|$|E

30|$|The average {{personal}} network {{sizes for}} students of each chronotype are shown in Fig.  2 (B). It is evident that owls have personal networks that are much larger than those of larks, with the intermediate chronotype positioned in between (owls: network size k= 70.7 ± 4.1, larks: k= 51.0 ± 2.7, intermediate k= 55.4 ± 1.9). When the <b>average</b> <b>call</b> <b>durations</b> and total frequencies of calls and texts per social contact are considered, an opposite trend becomes visible (Fig.  2 (C) and (D)): owls make the shortest <b>calls</b> on <b>average</b> and their communication frequency per social tie is the lowest {{as compared to the}} intermediate chronotype and in particular to larks. More detailed analysis indicates that owls’ <b>calls</b> are on <b>average</b> shorter than those of other chronotypes at all times of day except at night where the differences are within standard errors (mornings owls/larks: 83 / 100; afternoons owls/larks 86 / 103; evenings owls/larks 106 / 141; nights owls/larks 68 / 64; all numbers in seconds). This reflects the known sub-linear scaling between node degree and strength in social networks (see, e.g., [33]); the larger the number of relationships, the less time is available for each of them. There are also differences in the numbers of screen-on events for the different chronotypes: the mean of number of screen-on events in weeks 2 – 51 is 19, 829 for larks, 23, 509 for members of the intermediate chronotype, and 25, 140 for owls.|$|R

Both traditional and state of the art methods for non-intrusive speech transmission quality measurements and also for call duration monitoring are briefly described and two basic ways of the dependency analysis are shown. The relations for result uncertainty estimation are derived. A numerical example is given based on a limited training database that is constructed on the basis of real network data.

30|$|We first {{construct}} the personal networks of all participants based on both call and text data. For this we use each (hashed and anonymized) phone number that the participant communicates with (through calls and text messages) {{as a proxy}} of a social relationship. In this network, each individual is a node and communication events (calls and text messages) between people are the links. The degree of a node (the personal network size) is {{the total number of}} people in contact with that node, while the strength of a link is the number of times that it is activated (i.e., the total number of interactions between two nodes). When constructing the personal network of each individual, we consider communication with any phone number, not only those associated with other study participants (see Methods). In addition to personal network membership, we count the total number of calls and texts with each contact, as well as the <b>average</b> outgoing <b>call</b> <b>duration.</b> We then study the properties of the personal networks of individuals of each chronotype separately for which we use outgoing calls and text messages.|$|R

30|$|In the {{advertisement}} call of D. melanostictus, the pulse rate and dominant frequency {{appear to have}} high potential for conveying information about an individual male's status in a sexual selection context. In the Nusa Dua population, the dominant frequency appeared to have a relatively high between-individual variation, while two call characteristics (dominant frequency and pulse rate) had coefficients of variation of < 10 % (Márquez and Eekhout 2006), indicating some potential for species recognition. However, calls emitted in a dense chorus may also have additional potential for sexual selection, although the sample size was too limited (n = 5) to confirm this point. In addition, {{the advertisement}} call of D. melanostictus from Coorg, India was previously described by Hampson and Bennet (2002). They reported that the <b>average</b> <b>duration</b> <b>call</b> of the specimens of India was 40 s, and the average dominant frequency was 1.6 kHz.

30|$|The {{advertisement}} call of D. melanostictus was {{a series}} of groups of 56 to 244 pulses (mean ± SD = 145 ± 54 pulses) (Figure  7 A) with an <b>average</b> <b>call</b> <b>duration</b> of 26, 722 ms, an average dominant frequency of around 1, 293 Hz (Table  1; Figure  7 B), and an average pulse rate of 11.69 pulses/s. Conversely, at Nusa Dua (Bali, Indonesia), the advertisement call of D. melanostictus {{was a series}} of groups of 2 ~ 14 pulses with an <b>average</b> <b>call</b> <b>duration</b> of 456 ms, an average dominant frequency of around 1, 059 Hz, and an average pulse rate of 11.9 pulses/s (Márquez and Eekhout 2006). These data were obtained at temperatures of 28 ~ 29 °C, from males with an average SVL of 64.2 mm. Does call data indicate that this widespread species has geographic variations in its call features, or that it may be more than one species? We also support the hypothesis that geographic variations and body sizes of adult males are related to calling parameters. The results of multiple regressions between the covariates (SVL, temperature, and humidity) and six acoustic parameters showed that the call duration, dominant frequency, rise time, and pulse rate were positively significant. In particular, dominant frequencies were highly variable among populations studied (1.0 to 1.7 kHz in Bangkok, Thailand; 3.0 kHz in Burma, Myanmar; 1.6 kHz in Coorg, India; and 1.35 to 1.51 kHz in Lishui, China; Márquez and Eekhout 2006; Wei et al. 2012); whereas in this study, the dominant frequency of toads was approximately 1.24 to 1.32 kHz.|$|E

We find a high elasticity of demand for each service option with respect to its fixed monthly fee. This indicates high substitutability among service options. The shift among service options induces new calling patterns, which we find to be a small but not negligible indirect effect. ...|$|R

40|$|As {{the number}} of mobile users in {{cellular}} systems increases, the user mobility becomes the dominating factor for guaranteeing quality of services (QoS). In order to support QoS for mobiles in cellular systems, the concept of accumulated user mobility is combined with the handoff algorithm {{to reduce the amount}} of reserving channels (codes) for handoff calls and increase the total carried traffic load. There are many factors that affect the QoS for a handoff algorithm and the mobile velocity, <b>average</b> <b>call</b> <b>duration</b> time, average cell dwell time, and handoff probabilities for each adjacent cell are most frequently mentioned. Thus, the mobile velocity is considered and formulated by the relational function of extenics that is similar to a fussy theory and first applied in wireless networks by this paper. With the cell approaches, the call duration time, etc. can be obtained from user profile and be applied to calculate the handoff attempts of each adjacent cell in current cell. By the accumulated handoff attempts of the six adjacent cells, the appropriate amount of channels (codes) can be reserved for handoff beforehand, and the required QoS is preserved during handoffs occurring. Since both QoS and {{the number of}} reserved channels (codes) are the considered issues in the proposed scheme, better system utilization can be achieved.

Generally speaking, 1 to 5  % loss rate is acceptable for certain codecs. In this paper, the tolerable packet loss rate is increased by involving the DST in the voice frames. Consequently, the capacity of the covert channel is increased since more packets are allowed to be replaced by the stegnogram. Another concern of LACK performance is the <b>call</b> <b>duration</b> distribution. When LACK is applied in a normal VoIP <b>call,</b> the <b>call</b> <b>duration</b> is affected by additional lost packets caused by LACK.

So DST can make the LACKed VoIP voice stream perceptually equivalent to the non-LACK voice stream without adding more <b>call</b> <b>duration.</b> In other words, the space compressed by the DST offsets the additional space consumed by the LACK covert channel.

The first 5 features were closely related to ours with the exception that instead of average route distance between consecutive calls, we use radius of gyration as defined in [60] as a measure of mobility. Furthermore, we do not include any information on expense patterns which, if included, will increase our prediction performance for gender, but more importantly for socio-economic status and age as observed in [59]. Similar to our findings, Martinez et al. reported statistically significant differences among males and females in the distribution of all features with the exception of average route distance. In contrast, we find that mobility indicators such as radius of gyration and percent at home, are among the most discriminating features between males and females, especially in SA. Their SVM and RF models on the full data achieved an accuracy of 56 % in predicting gender. The authors achieved higher accuracy by sacrificing coverage and restricting the prediction to individuals who belong to predominantly male-only or female-only k-means clusters and reported an accuracy of 80 % with 3 % coverage and 70 % with 12 % coverage. In comparison, we obtain an accuracy of 80 % when the coverages are 65 % (SA) and 75 % (EU), and an accuracy of at least 74 % when coverage is 100 % (both SA and EU). It should be noted that our 5 most powerful features achieve an accuracy of 65.5 % in SA and 63.7 % in EU with 100 % coverage (see Figure  7). We attribute these improvements to our a richer set of discriminating indicators and effective feature selection among our large feature-set for any particular prediction task.|$|E
40|$|M. Tech. (Electrical Engineering) Abstract: Wireless {{communications}} {{have experienced}} massive development remarkably {{in the past}} decade. Networks such as global system for mobile communications (GSM) and universal mobile telecommunication service (UMTS) has enjoyed enormous patronization, hence leading to massive mobile network congestion. The problem of network congestion is a network managerial issue that affects the Quality of Service (QoS) rendered by a network. Hence for the sustainability of the system, {{there is a need}} to fully manage the radio resources during peak and off peak periods. Call Admission Control (CAC) schemes are constantly being used extensively in managing mobile network congestion. CAC is an approach that can provide credible QoS by regulating the number of connections into the cellular network thereby allowing good use of the radio resources, reducing network congestions, interference and other QoS problems. Network resources cannot be available for all users at all times especially during busy hour traffic. Hence, these resources require effective and efficient allocation so that more subscribers are being allowed to use the network irrespective of the network traffic at a particular reference time. Mobile network congestion can be controlled by suppressing the mobile network traffic demand. The traffic demand varies proportionally with average rate of call arrival and the average duration of the calls. Hence marginalizing the <b>average</b> <b>call</b> <b>duration</b> will minimize traffic load, thereby reducing network congestion. Some network users due to their lifestyle of being affluent or business demands, holds on to a particular channel during long duration of calls at the detriment of other network users. CAC scheme cannot solve congestion problems due to the selfishness of these particular sets of users. Here, the combination of a channel reservation CAC scheme with Call Duration Control (CDC) scheme was proposed, in which users that have stayed over a predetermined period in the network will be served a termination notice so as to make the channel available for new users. The motive is to provide the available channels to accommodate more users. A simulation-based approach was used to model the combination of the two schemes and the combination produces good results in reducing the congestion menace. The network type deployed in the research is GSM. The result of the CAC/CDC combination schemes were compared to the result of the ordinary CAC schemes in order to verify the impact of the [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Next Generation Wireless Networks (NGWNs) are envisaged to be heterogeneous. They will {{integrate}} multiple Radio Access Technologies (RATs) on {{the same}} platform where the RAT s are expected {{to work together in}} a coordinated fashion. Radio resources will therefore be jointly managed. Joint Call Admission Control (JCAC) approach has been adopted to jointly allocate or handle the radio resources amongst the different RATs in an NGWN. A number of JCAC algorithms have been proposed in the literature with the objective of enabling efficient utilisation of the radio resources and ensuring that required QoS requirements are met. However, studies in JCAC have not typically considered the revenue obtained by network operators in NGWNs. With the implementation of NGWNs, user demand for network services is expected to significantly increase. Consequently, one of the challenges envisaged in the NGWNs for network operators is a large decoupling between users' traffic and the revenue obtained. Therefore, it is important to analyse the network operators' revenue in NGWN s and devise means to ensure that sufficient revenue is obtained. This research analyses network operators' revenue in a heterogeneous network environment while maintaining QoS by incorporating pricing in JCAC. An analytical model based on a multi-dimensional Markov decision process is used to model JCAC algorithm in an NGWN. The JCAC algorithm used is load-based whereby calls arriving in the network are admitted to the least loaded RATs. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated using MATLAB. The analysed NGWN consists of two RATs and two service classes. QoS performance is measured with connection-level QoS metrics namely call blocking probability and call dropping probability. Other investigated performance metrics are average number of calls in the systems, user utility and revenue obtained. Performance of the NGWN is carried out with a dynamic pricing scheme incorporated in JCAC. A discount approach is applied to determine new price under the dynamic pricing scheme. User behaviour with price variation is impacted by change of call arrival rate and <b>average</b> <b>call</b> <b>duration.</b> Simulations are also carried out with flat pricing for comparison purposes. The results obtained show that better system performance and high revenue for network operators are obtained with the dynamic pricing scheme. Furthermore, a hybrid pricing model is proposed whereby flat and dynamic pricing schemes are integrated, giving users flexibility of choosing an appropriate pricing scheme. The analysis is conducted with different percentages of users opting for either dynamic or flat pricing schemes. Simulation results show that higher user utility and improved QoS performance are obtained with the hybrid pricing model. Additionally, reasonable operators' revenue is guaranteed with the hybrid pricing model...|$|E

40|$|Given a {{communication}} network {{and a set of}} call requests, the goal is to find a minimum makespan schedule for the calls such that the sum of the bandwidth requirements of simultaneously active calls using the same link does not exceed the capacity of that link. In this paper the call-scheduling problem is studied for star and tree networks. Lower and upper bounds on the worst-case performance of List-Scheduling (LS) and variants of it are obtained for call-scheduling with arbitrary bandwidth requirements and either unit <b>call</b> <b>durations</b> or arbitrary <b>call</b> <b>durations.</b> LS does not require advance knowledge of <b>call</b> <b>durations</b> and, hence, is an on-line algorithm. It has performance ratio (competitive ratio) at most 5 in star networks. A variant of LS for <b>calls</b> with unit <b>durations</b> is shown to have performance ratio at most 2 2 3. In tree networks with n nodes, a variant of LS for <b>calls</b> with unit <b>durations</b> has performance ratio at most 6, and a variant for calls with arbitrary d [...] ...|$|R
