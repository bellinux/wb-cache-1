In Mumbai, Yogesh's family consults an astrologer to learn if their eldest son, Jitu (Dilip Joshi), a debtor, will go to jail, and also give him Yogesh's birthdate to learn his future. They are astonished to hear that Yogesh will inherit a fortune if he is married on the 20th of that month; the phone rings, and the family is overjoyed to hear that Yogesh's grandfather has made him his sole heir.|$|E
5|$|One of Irving's most lasting {{contributions}} to American culture {{is in the}} way Americans perceive and celebrate Christmas. In his 1812 revisions to A History of New York, Irving inserted a dream sequence featuring St. Nicholas soaring over treetops in a flying wagon—a creation others would later dress up as Santa Claus. In his five Christmas stories in The Sketch Book, Irving portrayed an idealized celebration of old-fashioned Christmas customs at <b>a</b> <b>quaint</b> English manor, that depicted harmonious warm-hearted English Christmas festivities he experienced while staying in Aston Hall, Birmingham, England, that had largely been abandoned. He used text from The Vindication of Christmas (London 1652) of old English Christmas traditions, he had transcribed into his journal as a format for his stories. The book contributed to the revival and reinterpretation of the Christmas holiday in the United States.|$|E

25|$|By 1830, the {{population}} of Hobart Town was over 20,000, with 18,108 men, and 6,171 women. However, Hobart Town had grown to become <b>a</b> <b>quaint,</b> picturesque and thriving southern ocean port town. The whaling, sealing, wool and wattle oil industries were booming, as were agricultural crops such as wheat and apple growing. The economy was thriving, and life was quite comfortable for the merchants and free residents of the colony's capital.|$|E

25|$|After the {{economic}} doldrums of the 1960s and early 1970s, the city's economy began to recover in the 1980s. An early sign of that change {{was in the}} neighborhood of Ocean Park. Main Street, <b>a</b> <b>quaint</b> mile of sawdust bars and dilapidated stores selling old furniture, was upgraded by the concerted efforts {{of a new generation of}} owners. Soon it was attracting increasingly expensive boutiques and restaurants. At the northern end of Main Street adjacent to the still-declining Santa Monica Mall, a city block was levelled in 1980 to build a new mall, Santa Monica Place, designed by architect Frank Gehry. Further south on Main Street, the mixed-use museum, retail, and restaurant complex, Edgemar – also designed by Frank Gehry – opened in 1988.|$|E

[...] "He is the first of the American humorists, as he is almost the first of the American writers", wrote critic H.R.

The old man recovers a bit and has the children help him in putting together a portable planetarium projector. This story offers an ultimate conclusion to the story in the kinetic novel.|$|E

500|$|In {{contrast}} to this positive reception, Entertainment Weekly {{felt that the}} anthropomorphising of the dinosaurs veered close to [...] "a Disney cartoon." [...] Other criticisms from the press included a lack of character needed for truly engrossing fiction. Reviewers described Bakker's work as [...] "thoroughly heartfelt," [...] despite flaws such as inconsistent writing; Men's News Daily, a site which focuses on social values, suggested that Bakker's raptors [...] "possess <b>a</b> <b>quaint,</b> special appeal in today's social climate". Megan Gallagher's narration of the audiobook, combined with continuous sound effects and [...] dramatic music to create an [...] "aural picture," [...] was also praised. Entertainment Weekly gave Raptor Red its [...] "Best of Breed Award" [...] for a [...] "captivating novel about animal life".|$|E

Similar to the studies suggested in Poe's short story [...] "Ligeia", this lore may be about the occult or black magic. This is also emphasized in the author's choice to set the poem in December, a month which is traditionally associated with the forces of darkness. The use of the raven—the [...] "devil bird"—also suggests this. This devil image is emphasized by the narrator's belief that the raven is [...] "from the Night's Plutonian shore", or a messenger from the afterlife, referring to Pluto, the Roman god of the underworld (also known as Dis Pater in Roman mythology). A direct allusion to Satan also appears: [...] "Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore..." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1972, Lennon and Ono {{released}} an 81-minute film {{to accompany the}} Imagine album which featured footage of the couple in their home, garden and the recording studio of their Berkshire property at Tittenhurst Park {{as well as in}} New York City.

Above the front door to their house is a sign that reads: [...] "This Is Not Here", the title of Ono's then New York art show. The next scene shows Lennon sitting at a white grand piano in a dimly lit, all-white room.

At the song's conclusion, Ono sits beside Lennon at the piano, and they share <b>a</b> <b>quaint</b> gaze, then a brief kiss.|$|E

The Portland Mercury Katie Shimer called the bar [...] "one million percent fun" [...] and said, [...] "Whatever your fetish, the strippers deliver ...

[...] Similarly, the Seattle alternative weekly The Stranger said the venue was [...] "perhaps the funnest place {{in all the world}} ... especially when the fellers trot on stage in a vast array of hilarious costumes". The paper's Wm. Steven Humphrey wrote, [...] "These nudie cuties were born to entertain, and prove it by leaping from stage to tabletop, hanging naked upside down (by the tops of their FEET!!), and if you're extremely lucky, gingerly lifting a dollar bill off your forehead with their ass cheeks. Now that's talent!" [...] Byron Beck of Willamette Week said the dancers at Three Sisters [...] " [...] <b>a</b> <b>quaint</b> queer tavern into the most mouthwatering of watering holes in P-town".

There were few buildings then, north of the Oxford-road, and forest-trees flourished, and wild flowers grew, and the hawthorn blossomed, in the now vanished fields. As a consequence, country airs circulated in Soho with vigorous freedom, instead of languishing into the parish like stray paupers without a settlement; and there was many a good south wall, not far off, on which the peaches ripened in their season.|$|R
