OBJECTIVE: to verify the topical effect of ascorbic acid for the healing of rats' skin wounds through the number of macrophages, new vessels and fibroblast verifications in the experimental period; and analyse the thickness and the collagen fibre organization in the injured tissue. METHODS: Male Rattus norvegicus weighing 270 ± 30 g were used. After thionembutal anesthesia, 15 mm transversal incisions were made in the animals' cervical backs. They were divided into two groups: Control Group (CG, n = 12) - skin wound cleaned with water and soap daily; Treated Group (TG, n = 12) - skin wound cleaned daily and treated with ascorbic acid cream (10 %). Samples of skin were collected on the 3 rd, 7 th and 14 th days. The sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin and picrosirius red for morphologic analysis.

To undertake the study we enrolled 322 pregnancies in Teplice and 220 in Prachatice. Venous and cord blood were analysed using the original alkaline Comet assay procedure with lysis for 60 min, unwinding for 40 min and electrophoresis for 24 min.

After semen collection, seminal plasma was separated by centrifugation and stored frozen until use. Sperm pellets were diluted in two steps with an egg yolk-Tris extender to a final concentration of 5 % glycerol and 0. 5 % Equex STM Paste. After thawing, semen was diluted 1 : 2 either with Tris buffer or with the autologous prostatic fluid. Motility was evaluated using a phase contrast microscope and <b>a</b> computer-assisted motility <b>analyser</b> <b>system</b> immediately after thawing and at hourly intervals up for 4 It at 38 degrees C. The status of acrosomes was assessed with Spermac((R)) stain at thawing and after 2 It of incubation. Motility and straight line velocity were initially higher in prostatic fluid-diluted samples (0 h and 0 and I h, respectively), but decreased to values similar to those of Tris-diluted samples in a time-dependent manner. In contrast, both the curvilinear velocity and amplitude of lateral head displacement were lower in prostatic fluid-diluted samples (I and 3 h and 0, 1 and 3 h, respectively). The dilution did not have any significant effect on the percentage of acrosome-intact spermatozoa at either thawing or after 2 h. The pattern of motility of prostatic fluid-diluted samples suggests a reduction in hyperactivated motility with time, even though prostatic fluid neither prolonged spermatozoa longevity nor had any effect on the status of spermatozoa acrosomes.

CO 2 /S molar ratios observed at DYK ranged from 3 - 17, similar ratios were observed using a Multi-GAS sensor box of 8 - 16. SO 2 at GZP was low, higher concentrations were observed at DYK where SO 2 /H 2 S ratios were close to 1 for both methods. A lower CO 2 /H 2 S ratio was measured via Giggenbach flask sampling (7. 2) than was found in the plume using the gas sensor at GZP (9. 2). This may reflect rapid oxidation of H 2 S as it mixes with background air. Gaseous elemental mercury (GEM) levels were observed in the fumarole gases using a portable mercury spectrometer. These are the first such measurements of mercury at Tatun. Mean GEM concentrations in the fumarole plumes were ∼ 20  ng m- 3, with much higher concentrations observed close to the ground (mean [GEM] 130 and 290  ng m- 3 at DYK and GZP, respectively). The GEM in the fumarole plume was elevated above concentrations in industrial/urban air in northern Taiwan and the increase in GEM observed when the instrument was lowered suggests high levels of mercury are present in the surrounding ground surface. The GEM/CO 2 (10 - 8) and GEM/S (10 - 6) ratios observed in the fumarole gases were comparable to those observed at other low-temperature fumaroles. Combining the Hg/CO 2 ratio with a previous CO 2 flux value for the area, the annual GEM flux from the Tatun field is estimated as 5 - 50  kg/year. © 2008 Elsevier B. V...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{inference}} of modes for which a logic program is guaranteed to terminate. This generalises traditional termination analysis where <b>an</b> <b>analyser</b> tries to verify termination for a specified mode. Our contribution is a methodology in which components of traditional termination analysis are combined with backwards analysis to obtain <b>an</b> <b>analyser</b> for termination inference. We identify a condition on {{the components of the}} analyser which guarantees that termination inference will infer all modes which can be checked to terminate. The application of this methodology to enhance <b>a</b> traditional termination <b>analyser</b> to perform also termination inference is demonstrated. ...|$|R
