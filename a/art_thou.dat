25|$|Carter Burwell {{has scored}} {{all of the}} Coens' films, aside from Crimewave (1985), {{although}} T-Bone Burnett produced much of the traditional music in O Brother, Where <b>Art</b> <b>Thou?</b> and The Ladykillers, and {{was in charge of}} archive music for The Big Lebowski. Skip Lievsay handles the sound editing for all of the Coens' films.|$|E
25|$|Set in 1937 rural Mississippi {{during the}} Great Depression, the film's {{story is a}} modern satire loosely based on Homer's epic poem, Odyssey.

25|$|Jimmie Rodgers and the Carter Family {{are widely}} {{considered}} to be important early country musicians. Their songs were first captured at a historic recording session in Bristol, Tennessee, on August 1, 1927, where Ralph Peer was the talent scout and sound recordist.

In 2001, he teamed up with Soderbergh again for the heist comedy Ocean's Eleven, a remake of the 1960s Rat Pack film of the same name, with Clooney playing Danny Ocean, originally portrayed by Frank Sinatra.|$|E
25|$|O Brother, Where <b>Art</b> <b>Thou?</b> was {{the first}} time a digital {{intermediate}} was used on the entirety of a first-run Hollywood film that otherwise had very few visual effects. The work was done in Los Angeles by Cinesite using a Spirit DataCine for scanning at 2K resolution, a Pandora MegaDef to adjust the color, and a Kodak Lightning II recorder to put out to film.|$|E
25|$|In {{recent decades}} {{bluegrass}} music {{has reached a}} broader audience. Major mainstream country music performers have recorded bluegrass albums, including Dolly Parton and Patty Loveless, who each released several bluegrass albums. Since the late 1990s, Ricky Skaggs, who began as a bluegrass musician and crossed over to mainstream country in the 1980s, returned to bluegrass with his band Kentucky Thunder. The Coen Brothers' film O Brother, Where <b>Art</b> <b>Thou?</b> (2000) has a country and bluegrass soundtrack which won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 2002. The documentary and concert film Down from the Mountain (2000) featured a live performance by the music artists {{who participated in the}} recording of the soundtrack recording.|$|E

25|$|In the United States, Full Moon debuted {{on top of}} the U.S. Billboard Top R/Hip-Hop Albums {{chart and}} at number two on the Billboard 200 on the issue dated March 13, 2002, marking her highest debut on both charts yet. Selling {{approximately}} 155,000 copies in its first week of release, the album fell short of the O Brother, Where <b>Art</b> <b>Thou?</b> soundtrack (2000) by less than 4,000 copies. Spending thirty weeks on the latter chart, the album shifted about 700,000 copies within {{the first three months of}} its release in the United States, and was eventually certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for more than 1.1 million sold units. In addition, the album peaked at number eleven on the Billboard Top Internet Albums chart.|$|E
25|$|Much of {{the music}} used in the film is period folk music, {{including}} that of Virginia bluegrass singer Ralph Stanley. The movie {{was one of the}} first to extensively use digital color correction, to give the film an autumnal, sepia-tinted look. The film received positive reviews, and the soundtrack, O Brother, Where <b>Art</b> <b>Thou?,</b> using American folk music, won a Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 2001. The original band soon became popular after the film release and the country and folk musicians who were dubbed into the film, such as John Hartford, Alison Krauss, Emmylou Harris, Gillian Welch, Chris Sharp, and others, joined together to perform the music from the film in a Down from the Mountain concert tour which was filmed for TV and DVD.|$|E
25|$|The Coen brothers' next film, O Brother, Where <b>Art</b> <b>Thou?</b> (2000), {{was another}} {{critical}} and commercial success. The title was {{borrowed from the}} Preston Sturges film Sullivan's Travels (1941), whose lead character, movie director John Sullivan, had planned {{to make a film}} with that title. Based loosely on Homer's Odyssey (complete with a cyclops, sirens, et al.), the story is set in Mississippi in the 1930s and follows a trio of escaped convicts who, after absconding from a chain gang, journey home to recover bank-heist loot the leader has buried—but they have no clear perception of where they are going. The film highlighted the comic abilities of George Clooney as the oddball lead character Ulysses Everett McGill, and of Tim Blake Nelson and John Turturro, his sidekicks. The film's bluegrass and old-time soundtrack, offbeat humor and digitally desaturated cinematography made it a critical and commercial hit. It was the first feature film to use all-digital color grading. The film's soundtrack CD was also successful, spawning a concert and concert/documentary DVD, Down from the Mountain, that coincided with a resurgence in interest in American folk music.|$|E
