5|$|Following No Mercy, the storyline between JBL and The Undertaker ended. JBL {{was then}} {{placed in a}} new angle against Booker T. On an episode of SmackDown!, a six-man tag team match {{involving}} Booker T, Rob Van Dam, and Rey Mysterio taking on JBL, Kenzo Suzuki, and René Duprée was scheduled. At the time, Booker T being a villain, congratulated JBL with the success that he has accomplished within the company in a segment backstage. The tag team match got underway, and JBL was {{led to believe that}} Booker was going to betray his tag partners, as Booker warned both Van Dam and Mysterio not to interfere with him during the match. The match concluded with Booker pinning JBL for the win, thus turning Booker into <b>a</b> <b>crowd</b> <b>favorite.</b> The following week on SmackDown!, Booker defeated Orlando Jordan, JBL's associate, to earn the right to face JBL for the WWE Championship at Survivor Series. At Survivor Series, JBL defeated Booker to retain the WWE title.|$|E

25|$|Genba, {{also known}} as the actual site, is the place and space for {{established}} and future underground hip-hop artists to gain and maintain recognition. It is here in these venues and night clubs that the artist performs and networks with people from the music industry, the audience, and the media. If the artist is <b>a</b> <b>crowd</b> <b>favorite,</b> the audience cheers or dances and this in a way decides the fate.|$|E

500|$|... "Live Forever" [...] is <b>a</b> <b>crowd</b> <b>favorite</b> {{to play at}} concerts.

500|$|Punk adopted his real-life {{following}} of {{the straight}} edge {{movement as a}} major attribute of his professional wrestling character. The character utilizes different elements of Punk's personality and beliefs of the straight edge movement dependent on his alignment. While portraying <b>a</b> <b>crowd</b> <b>favorite,</b> Punk's character tends {{to be that of}} Punk's normal personality, largely indifferent to others who drink alcohol, smoke tobacco, partake in recreational drug use or have promiscuous sexual behavior, but emphasizing the social discipline involved with personally abstaining from these behaviors. Conversely, his villainous personality tends to be that of one who is hardline or militant straight edge, exemplifying the elitist attitudes and superiority complexes—defined by Punk's common mantra during villainous-themed promos that, because he is straight edge, he is [...] "better than you". Punk performs the straight edge symbol of crossing his arms in an X formation while having the letter X written {{on the back of his}} hands, usually drawn on his wrist tape. During his WWE career, Punk also incorporated a belligerently anti-establishment and anti-corporate attitude into his persona.|$|E
500|$|In early 2000, Crash Holly {{joined the}} {{hardcore}} division. On the February 24 episode of SmackDown!, he defeated Test {{to begin his}} first of 22 Hardcore Championship reigns. He decreed that he must defend the championship twenty four hours a day, seven days a week, which later {{became known as the}} [...] "24/7 Rule". This meant that the title was permanently contested, not just in sanctioned matches, and could change hands anywhere, anytime anyone pinned the champion, so long as a WWF referee counted the fall. Holly was frequently attacked by other wrestlers in unlikely locations, including an airport, a funhouse, a circus, and his hotel room. Though he was often pinned, he usually immediately regained the title. His most common tactic was to sneak a pin, often after the champion had been beaten down by someone else, and quickly run backstage, away from possible challengers. This turned him into <b>a</b> <b>crowd</b> <b>favorite</b> and earned him the nickname [...] "The Houdini of Hardcore". He frequently defended the championship against non-wrestlers, including referees and road agents, like Gerald Brisco and Pat Patterson. He had a long feud with The Mean Street Posse (Pete Gas, Rodney and Joey Abs) over the title. He even lost, and quickly regained, the title against one of the Godfather's hos.|$|E

5000|$|... "Black Fender" [...] is an English {{language}} single by Swedish singer Hans Edler done as {{a tribute}} to Ricky Nelson. He performed the song during his live tour [...] "Hans Edler meets Ricky Nelson" [...] in December 2006.

5000|$|His fierce tenacity, {{desire to}} win, and plays like [...] "The Dunk", made Starks into <b>a</b> great <b>crowd</b> <b>favorite</b> in New York. [...] Starks's fiery {{intensity}} often led to emotional displays on the court.

500|$|The McMahons, {{along with}} The Spirit Squad, {{continued}} their feud with Shawn Michaels. In {{the weeks that}} followed, Michaels would get revenge on both the McMahons and the Spirit Squad. On the May 22 episode of Raw, however, Michaels was in a 5-on-1 handicap match, and the Spirit Squad members, in storyline, injured Michaels' left knee. Triple H, who was included during the rivalry, was ordered by Vince McMahon to [...] "break Michaels' skull", with his signature sledgehammer. Triple H failed to do what Mr. McMahon ordered, turned into <b>a</b> <b>crowd</b> <b>favorite</b> and attacked the Spirit Squad. Weeks followed in which Triple H was supposed {{to become a member}} of Mr. McMahon's [...] "Kiss My Ass Club". Triple H, however, backfired when trying to become a member, when he gave a Pedigree to McMahon and laid him and Shane out in the ring. On the June 12 episode of Raw, McMahon booked Triple H in a Handicap Gauntlet match against the Spirit Squad. The match saw Michaels return from his storyline injury, which led to Triple H and Michaels reforming their previous wrestling stable D-Generation X. At Vengeance, DX met the Spirit Squad in a 5-on-2 handicap match, which DX won.|$|E
500|$|As Christmas approaches, Akeelah {{goes out}} to buy Dr. Larabee a present, but when she meets him, he reveals that he is quitting being her coach because she reminds him of his {{deceased}} daughter Denise. Instead, he gives Akeelah 5,000 flashcards to study. Without her coach, rejected by her best friend Georgia, and feeling the pressure from her neighborhood residents to make them proud, Akeelah loses her motivation. However, Tanya tells {{her that if she}} looked around her, she would realize that she has [...] "50,000 coaches". Akeelah recruits her family members, classmates, teachers, friends, and neighbor Derrick T to prepare in earnest. After reuniting with Dr. Larabee, Akeelah goes to Washington, D.C. with him, along with Tanya, Georgia, Mr. Welch, and Devon, unaware that her coach has paid for four of their tickets. Georgia rekindles her friendship with Akeelah after she invites her. During the competition, Akeelah becomes <b>a</b> <b>crowd</b> <b>favorite.</b> After all the other competitors are eliminated, only Dylan and Akeelah remain. The two finalists are allowed a break, during which Akeelah overhears Dylan's father harshly pressuring him to win. Akeelah attempts to intentionally lose by deliberately misspelling [...] "xanthosis". Dylan, knowing that Akeelah knows this word, intentionally misspells it as well. Dylan tells Akeelah that he wants a fair competition, rejecting his father's obsession to win. The two then proceed to spell every word listed by the judges in the hopes of winning the championship together, with Dylan earning a share of it by correctly spelling [...] "logorrhea", much to his father's delight. Akeelah spells the last word on the list, [...] "pulchritude", and the two are declared co-champions amidst a cheering crowd.|$|E
2500|$|In the meantime, Albano {{had become}} {{involved}} in several charities. His brother's brother-in-law had recently died of multiple sclerosis, and the experience led Albano to lend his time to raising awareness and funds to combat the disease, occasionally alongside Lauper. His increasingly public benevolence clashed with his in-ring persona, which violated the principles of kayfabe—maintaining the appearance of reality within professional wrestling—which were still strictly adhered to at the time. In 1984, Albano decided it was time, after 32 years as a heel, to turn face. He therefore arranged for Lauper to receive an in-ring award for her contributions to both wrestling and the fight against MS, for which he also came out and congratulated her. In {{the course of the}} ceremony, Roddy Piper and [...] "Cowboy" [...] Bob Orton came into the ring to sarcastically praise Albano before breaking Lauper's award, a gold record plaque, over his head. Lauper and her boyfriend-manager David Wolff were also attacked by Piper and Orton. The melee was broken up by Hulk Hogan, but the altercation allowed Albano to now wrestle and manage as <b>a</b> <b>crowd</b> <b>favorite.</b>|$|E

Ice sledge hockey, which became <b>an</b> immediate <b>crowd</b> <b>favorite,</b> was added to the program.|$|R
500|$|Upon its October 2012 Chicago opening, Chicago Tribune critic Chris Jones {{described}} {{the show as}} a [...] "warm, likable, brassy, sentimental, big-hearted and modestly scaled" [...] production. [...] Another reviewer praised the score, book, direction and, particularly, Porter, before suggesting that, before opening on Broadway, it could use a more effective opening number, better pacing in Act 2 and [...] "the budding romance between Charlie and coworker Lauren ... needs more lead-in. In other words, give Ashford, <b>a</b> clear <b>crowd</b> <b>favorite,</b> more to do".|$|R
2500|$|While Volador Jr. {{enjoyed the}} backing of the fans La Sombra, who up until that point had been <b>a</b> <b>crowd</b> <b>favorite,</b> {{suffered}} a backlash from CMLL's decision to tease the Atlantis/Último Guerrero but never deliver it. La Sombra began teaming with Rush, another tecnico that was often disliked by the fans, especially after his own Lucha de Apuestas victory at the CMLL 79th Anniversary Show over El Terrible. La Sombra, Rush and La Máscara became a regular team, which were booked as tecnicos but would often be booed more than their rudo opponents. Though the three effectively became rudos, with CMLL dubbing Rush and La Sombra in particular as the two most hated men in the promotion's recent history, they refused to acknowledge themselves as such, instead calling themselves [...] "técnicos diferentes". The trio was originally dubbed Los Indeseables ("The Undesirables"), before being renamed Los Ingobernables ("The Ungovernables"). On June 6, Volador Jr. lost the NWA World Historic Light Heavyweight Championship to La Sombra in a match where La Sombra's NWA World Historic Middleweight Championship was also at stake. The loss came as a result of outside interference from La Máscara and Rush. Volador Jr. regained the title from La Sombra on August 1, 2014 at El Juicio Final. By July 2015 the La Sombra/Volador Jr. storyline was still going strong, often featuring Volador Jr. and various partners facing off against La Sombra and other Ingobernables, including new member Marco Corleone. At the 2015 Sin Salida ("No Escape") show La Sombra, Rush and Corleone defeated Volador Jr., Diamante Azul and Atlantis, after which Volador Jr. challenged La Sombra to another Luchas de Apuestas match, an offer that was flatly refused. Diamante Azul then added to the challenge, suggesting Volador Jr. and Azul face Rush and La Sombra, with each team betting their hair and mask on the outcome of the match. The challenge was not immediately accepted by Los Ingorbenables.|$|E

Juanito showed {{an enormous amount of}} poise and continued singing, proving that he was actually singing and not lip-synching {{like the rest of the}} participants.
