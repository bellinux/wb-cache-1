5|$|A Washington Post {{editorial}} {{asked why}} <b>an</b> <b>apparently</b> unstable Army private {{had been able}} to access and transfer sensitive material in the first place. According to her biographer, Manning's sexuality came into play by illustrating for the far right that gay people were unfit for military service, while the American mainstream thought of Manning as a gay soldier driven mad by bullying.|$|E
5|$|Neither {{the year}} nor {{the date of}} Stigand's birth is known. He was born in East Anglia, {{possibly}} in Norwich, to <b>an</b> <b>apparently</b> prosperous family of mixed English and Scandinavian ancestry, as is shown {{by the fact that}} Stigand's name was Norse but his brother's was English. His brother Æthelmær, also a cleric, later succeeded Stigand as bishop of Elmham. His sister held land in Norwich, but her given name is unrecorded.|$|E

5|$|Since 1 January 1941, {{the date}} of the {{foundation}} of the LROS, 290 bird species have been recorded in the counties in <b>an</b> <b>apparently</b> natural wild state at least once. A further nine were documented prior to that date, but have not been recorded subsequently. There are nine introduced species that maintain themselves without necessary recourse to further introduction. The total list for the LROS recording area is therefore 308 species.|$|E
5|$|After {{over three}} decades of inactivity, the Nice {{reformed}} in 2002 {{for a series of}} concerts. A three-CD set Vivacitas was released, with the third CD being an interview with Emerson, Jackson and Davison. Dave Kilminster guested on guitar at the concerts. Davison died on 15 April 2008 aged 65 in Horns Cross, Devon, from a brain tumour. Emerson died on 11 March 2016 in Santa Monica, California, of <b>an</b> <b>apparently</b> self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.|$|E
5|$|After the Mariner and Viking {{spacecraft}} {{had returned}} pictures of Mars as it really is, <b>an</b> <b>apparently</b> lifeless and canal-less world, these ideas about Mars {{had to be}} abandoned, and a vogue for accurate, realist depictions of human colonies on Mars developed, {{the best known of}} which may be Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars trilogy. Pseudo-scientific speculations about the Face on Mars and other enigmatic landmarks spotted by space probes have meant that ancient civilizations continue to be a popular theme in science fiction, especially in film.|$|E

5|$|Among animals, {{there exists}} a single known example of <b>an</b> <b>apparently</b> freely-rotating structure, though it is used for {{digestion}} rather than propulsion: the crystalline style of certain bivalves and gastropods. The style consists of a transparent glycoprotein rod which is continuously formed in a cilia-lined sac and extends into the stomach. The cilia rotate the rod, so that it becomes wrapped in strands of mucus. As the rod slowly dissolves in the stomach, it releases digestive enzymes. Estimates {{of the speed of}} rotation of the style in vivo vary significantly, and it is unclear if the style is rotated continuously or intermittently.|$|E
5|$|In 821, {{the year}} of Coenwulf's death, a council was held in London at which Coenwulf {{threatened}} to exile Wulfred if the archbishop did not surrender an estate of 300 hides and make a payment of 120 pounds to the king. Wulfred is recorded to have agreed to these terms, but the conflict continued well past Coenwulf's death, with <b>an</b> <b>apparently</b> final agreement between Wulfred and Coenwulf's daughter Cwoenthryth reached in 826 or 827. However, Wulfred officiated at the consecration of Coenwulf's brother and heir, Ceolwulf, on 17 September 822, so {{it is evident that}} some accommodation had been reached by that time. Wulfred had probably resumed his archiepiscopal duties earlier that year.|$|E
5|$|In Spoke City, Thomas Prescott accepts <b>an</b> <b>apparently</b> {{innocent}} hitch-hiker {{into his}} car. The stranger's true intentions are revealed when he attaches a metal bracelet to Prescott's wrist, warning {{him that it}} contains a powerful explosive charge that is due to detonate in 30 minutes; the key to unlock it will be found {{in his office at}} the Hudson Building. Speeding to his workplace with the police in pursuit, Prescott removes the bracelet and leaves it in a filing cabinet. The device explodes as he is returning to the ground floor in a lift: the top levels of the Hudson Building are incinerated, and Prescott is plunged {{to the bottom of the}} lift shaft, ten storeys underground.|$|E

5|$|In his {{documentary}} The Pervert's Guide to Cinema, Slavoj Žižek {{remarks that}} Norman Bates' mansion has three floors, paralleling the {{three levels of}} the human mind that are postulated by Freudian psychoanalysis: the top floor would be the superego, where Bates' mother lives; the ground floor is then Bates' ego, where he functions as <b>an</b> <b>apparently</b> normal human being; and finally, the basement would be Bates' id. Žižek interprets Bates' moving his mother's corpse from top floor to basement as a symbol for the deep connection that psychoanalysis posits between superego and id.|$|E

Without explanation, the aliens leave the area as Mulder arrives. While Doggett and Reyes report to the FBI Headquarters, Doggett initiates an investigation into Kersh after previously witnessing a late night meeting between him, Rohrer and Crane (& their consequent disappearance). Mulder takes Scully and their newborn baby back to her apartment. After marveling over the baby and discussing recent events, the two agents share a long, passionate kiss.|$|E
5|$|The popular {{painting}} shows a {{group of}} 125 wedding guests wearing clothing from the times, presented in the canvas in <b>an</b> <b>apparently</b> chaotic way in an outdoor party surrounded by trees.

Voyeurism (spying on people engaged in intimate behaviours) is shown throughout the entire work amongst almost all of the people.|$|E

5|$|There are {{variants}} {{within this}} tradition. Some versions give {{the credit for}} finding the child to Queen Kirupanci of Chandragiri. Others omit mention of the king of Chandragiri altogether, and omit reference to the Koovagam temple. Instead they focus on the demon Kuttacuran and <b>an</b> <b>apparently</b> impossible boon granted {{to him that he}} will be killed by a person having only a head and who was born from water. Vishnu, incarnated as Krishna, informs the gods that Aravan will kill this demon. With this in mind, the head of Aravan is consigned to the river and is transformed into a child called Kuttan ("born from water"), who kills the demon.|$|E
5|$|This is <b>an</b> <b>apparently</b> rare {{example of}} Western Australian swan {{symbolism}} being transferred eastward, then transformed to symbolise something else, retaining only {{an echo of}} its formerly symbolic values. None of the current AFL teams have taken a black swan emblem in allusion to any natural qualities of the bird, and its sole representation in the symbology of the league refers to the largely unresearched phenomenon of late 19th-mid 20th century migration between Western Australia and Victoria - now borne by a club that has emigrated to New South Wales. It is an ironic transformation in the symbolism of a bird that that was for so long thought to be non-migratory.|$|E
5|$|Wolves may {{encounter}} striped hyenas in Israel, Central Asia and India, usually in disputes over carcasses. Striped hyenas feed extensively on wolf-killed carcasses {{in areas where}} the two species interact. One-to-one, hyenas dominate wolves, and may prey on them, but wolf packs can drive off single or outnumbered hyenas. However, there was a case of a female striped hyena dominating 12 Arabian wolves. Two cases are known however from southern Israel, where wolves and striped hyenas associated closely with each other in <b>an</b> <b>apparently</b> amicable way.|$|E

5|$|Commentators {{generally}} agree that, {{to precipitate}} {{such a course}} of action as abandonment of <b>an</b> <b>apparently</b> sound and seaworthy ship, with ample provisions, some extraordinary and alarming circumstance must have arisen. In his evidence to the enquiry, Deveau ventured an explanation based on the sounding rod found on the derelict's deck. He suggested that Briggs abandoned ship after a sounding that, because of a malfunction of the pumps or other mishap, had given a false impression that the vessel was taking on water rapidly. A severe waterspout strike before the abandonment could explain the amount of water in the ship, and the ragged state of her rigging and sails. The low barometric pressure generated by the spout could have driven water from the bilges up into the pumps, leading the crew to assume the ship had taken on more water than she had, and was in danger of sinking.|$|E
5|$|During extreme conditions, some frogs enter a {{state of}} torpor and remain {{inactive}} for months. In colder regions, many species of frog hibernate in winter. Those that live on land such as the American toad (Bufo americanus) dig a burrow and make a hibernaculum in which to lie dormant. Others, less proficient at digging, find a crevice or bury themselves in dead leaves. Aquatic species such as the American bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) normally sink {{to the bottom of}} the pond where they lie, semi-immersed in mud but still able to access the oxygen dissolved in the water. Their metabolism slows down and they live on their energy reserves. Some frogs can even survive being frozen. Ice crystals form under the skin and in the body cavity but the essential organs are protected from freezing by a high concentration of glucose. <b>An</b> <b>apparently</b> lifeless, frozen frog can resume respiration and the heart beat can restart when conditions warm up.|$|E
5|$|During the turmoil, Harald {{was arrested}} and imprisoned, but the sources {{disagree}} on the grounds. The sagas state that Harald was arrested for defrauding the emperor of his treasure, {{as well as for}} requesting marriage with <b>an</b> <b>apparently</b> fictional niece or granddaughter of Zoe, called Maria (his suit supposedly being turned down by the empress because she wanted to marry Harald herself). William of Malmesbury states that Harald was arrested for defiling a noble woman, while according to Saxo Grammaticus he was imprisoned for murder. DeVries suggests that the new emperor may have feared Harald because of his loyalty to the previous emperor. The sources also disagree on how Harald got out of prison, but he may have been helped by someone outside to escape {{in the midst of the}} revolt that had begun against the new emperor. While some of the Varangians helped guard the emperor, Harald became the leader of the Varangians who supported the revolt. The emperor was in the end dragged out of his sanctuary, blinded and exiled to a monastery, and the sagas claim that it was Harald himself who blinded Michael V (or at least claimed to have done so).|$|E
