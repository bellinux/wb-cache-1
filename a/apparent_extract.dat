Literature review focuses on the theory of malt production and the posibility of special malts production from cereals such as wheat, oat, rye or corn, that can be subsequently used for beer production. Several kinds of cereals were chosen for the experimental part of the thesis and malts were made from these cereals. The malts {{were used for the}} laboratory preparation of beer in a ratio of 50 % of special malt and 50 % of barley malt. Basic analysis were performed for the cereals and also for prepared malts (TGW, density, glassiness and extract). The brewed beer was analyzed using the FermentoFlash (alcohol content, real and <b>apparent</b> <b>extract,</b> original wort, relative density and osmotic pressure) and pH values were measured too. Finally, sensory analysis were performed. The best evaluated samples were corn and oat beer. Wheat beer got the worst evaluation...|$|E

The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the ingestive behavior and in vivo digestibility of goats fed increasing levels (0 %, 2 %, 4 %, and 7 %) of copra extracted from green coconuts. Twenty male goats of undefined breed were allocated in a completely randomized design. The addition of increasing levels of coconut copra had a quadratic effect on dry matter intake and daily rumination time. An increasing linear effect was observed for rumination time of dry matter and neutral detergent fiber.

40|$|The study {{consists}} {{in the production}} of a traditional beer from maize in the Congo. The traditional method of brewing corn malt has three main stages: malting corn, brewing corn malt and fermentation. During the brewing corn malt, endogenous amylase activity is destroyed during the stiffening of the starch to about 80 °C. A pre-cooking of the mash is necessitated to promote amylolyse at 50 °C with an exogenous enzyme. The use of a preparation of α-amylase can liquefy the mash and produce a sweet wort (average density = 12. 5 ° Balling) rich in dextrin corresponding to an <b>apparent</b> <b>extract</b> of 4 ° Balling in beer. The rising profile of the pH of the corn malt mash, from mashing to extract the wort does not affect the pH of the beer produced.

Effective methods are required to reduce other process variables which elevate the operational costs {{in the production of}} beer. The aim {{of this study was to}} design and investigate the optimal control philosophy for beer fermentation using the proportional integral derivative (PID) control algorithm in the Micro-Brewery at the University of the Witwatersrand. This will be achieved by controlling the cooling regimes of the fermenter jacket in order to compute the gain constant (K 1) that would minimise the dead time (Td) and process reaction time (Ti) and produce a beer which will have desirable palatability attributes. All investigations were performed using a Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast strain and wort of 14. 30 P <b>apparent</b> <b>extract.</b> The controller constant, the dead time and rise time were found to be 9. 6 second, 2 seconds and 1 second, respectively.

This study showed that beer colour (EBD) was found to improve with fermentation temperature for the first 2 days then remain unchanged and showed that temperature is a possible process variable in the optimisation of colour.

In this work, a brewer yeast strain was submitted to high gravity fermentations to evaluate the influence and the limits of the environmental parameters on the fermentation performance and final product profile. The variables included in this study were the primary fermentation temperature, wort concentration (extract) and yeast pitching rate. Static fermentations were carried out anaerobically in 2 L tall tubes (EBC recommendation for small scale brewing fermentations) with 15, 18 and 22 ºP wort, at constant temperature of 12, 15 and 18 ºC. The yeast was grown aerobically at 27 ºC in 15 ºP wort (saturated with air) and collect by filtration to inoculate by mass at different pitching rates of 12, 18 and 22 million cells/ml. Fermentations were monitored daily measuring the ethanol, extract, pH, temperature, biomass in suspension and viability. At the end of the primary fermentation, the green beer was analysed concerning diacetil, esters and high alcohols by gas chromatography. Fermentation data were statistically treated in order to obtain an optimum approach for the studied parameters. For statistical proposes, the fermentation performance was measured by ethanol produced, <b>apparent</b> <b>extract</b> and the fermentation time. Although the temperature has a positive effect on the indicators of the fermentation performance, the wort concentration has not a positive effect for all indicators. When the wort has higher concentration {{at the beginning of the}} fermentation, as expected, the fermentation takes longer to be finished with more ethanol produced. Considering that the produced ethanol, the fermentation time and the residual extract have the same level of interest for the brewing process, the statistical analysis showed that the optimal point for the wort concentration, fermentation temperature and pitching rate is 20 ºP, 18 ºC and 20 x 106 cell/ml, respectively.

The malts {{were used to}} brew samples of beer with alcoholic strength ranging between 8 - 12 % EPM. The above range of original wort content was chosen due to its suitability for sensory evaluation and properties; in stronger types of beer, (more than 12 % EPM), nature of the beverage can be drown by mashy flavour. In the experimental samples, the actual residual extract oscillated between 4. 0 - 6. 5 %. The content of ethanol corresponded {{to the degree of}} fermentation and thereby also to the residual actual extract in balance equilibrium specifying that higher residual extract corresponds to lower content of alcohol by volume. It ranged between 2. 5 - 5. 0 %. The sample 1 contained the highest amount of ethanol by mass (3. 9 %) and the sample 13 showed the lowest one (1. 9 %); alike trend of ethanol content by volume was revealed (5 and 2. 44 %, respectively). The highest content of actual and <b>apparent</b> <b>extract</b> was found in the sample 2 (6. 6 and 5. 2 %, respectively); the sample 13 showed the lowest levels (4. 0 and 3. 1 %, respectively).

The highest relative density was revealed in the sample 2 (1. 02 %) and the lowest one in the sample 13 (1. 01 %). Considering differences in osmotic pressure, the sample 1 exhibited the highest value (1045 mOs) and the sample 13 the lowest one (551 mOs). The highest level of fermentation was found in the sample 19 (61. 7 %), the lowest one was proved in the sample 19 (44. 0 %).

Coherent fields that are visually <b>apparent</b> were <b>extracted</b> with relatively limited apparent errors of omission or commission {{compared to the}} CDL classifications.

In total, five thermophilic starter cultures and two products (yoghurt and Greek-style yoghurt) were investigated. Results show that the influence of hydrolysis of lactose on {{the properties of the}} fermented dairy products strongly depends on starter culture and substrate. For starters C and D, <b>apparent</b> viscosity (<b>extracted</b> from flow curves at a shear rate of 75  s− 1) of fermented milks was only marginally affected by lactose hydrolysis, ranging between approx. 0. 34 – 0. 31 and 0. 37 – 0. 31  Pa. s, respectively. Hydrolysed products from starters A and E exhibited significant lower apparent viscosity (0. 16 and 0. 24  Pa. s) compared with their respective references (0. 29 and 0. 35  Pa. s). Fermentation of both substrates (regular yoghurt, Greek-style yoghurt) with starter B resulted in a decrease of yield stress and apparent viscosity because of lactose hydrolysis only for Greek-style yoghurt. Furthermore, a trend towards higher EPS synthesis was found when using hydrolysed milk. The results clearly show that products made from lactose-hydrolysed milk with similar rheological properties as the reference product can be obtained but that {{there is a lack of}} information concerning the complex interactions between starter culture and milk substrate...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effect of zinc (Zn) and vitamin E supplementations on apparent nutrient digestibility, carcass traits, and mineral availability of broiler in tropical environment. The experiment was arranged in a 3 x 3 factorial design with 4 replications in each treatment (10 birds each). The dietary treatments were the combination of doses of zinc (A 1 : 0 ppm, A 2 : 40 ppm, A 3 : 80 ppm) and vitamin E (B 1 : 0 ppm, B 2 : 125 ppm, B 3 : 250 ppm) supplementations. The variables observed were apparent nutrient digestibilities (apparent crude protein digestibility and <b>apparent</b> ether <b>extract</b> digestibility), carcass traits (final weight, the percentage of carcass weight, breast weight, thigh weight, wings weight, and back weight), meat bone ratio and mineral availability in the tibia (calcium [Ca], phosphorus [P], and zinc [Zn]). The results showed that apparent nutrient digestibility, carcass traits (the percentages of carcass, breast, thighs, wings, and back), meat bone ratio were not significantly influenced by the supplementation of zinc or vitamin E. The supplementation of 80 ppm of Zn and 0 ppm of vitamin E significantly (P< 0. 05) increased final weight of broiler. Supplementation of zinc alone and vitamin E alone in the diet significantly (P< 0. 05) increased calcium content of the tibia. In conclusion, supplementation of 80 ppm of Zn increased calcium content compared to control, but did not affect final weight and ether-extract digestibility. Supplementation of vitamin E at a dose of 125 ppm could increase calcium content of the tibia compared to control...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} static and dynamic {{properties}} of the water-density fluctuations in the interface of large nonpolar solutes. With the help of extensive molecular dynamics simulations of TIP 4 P water near smooth spherical solutes, we show that for large solutes, the interfacial density profile is broadened by capillary waves. For purely repulsive solutes, the squared width of the interface increases linearly with the logarithm of the solute size, as predicted by capillary-wave theory. The <b>apparent</b> interfacial tension <b>extracted</b> from the slope agrees {{with that of a}} free liquid–vapor interface. The characteristic length of local density fluctuations is ≈ 0. 5 nm, measured along the arc, again consistent with that of a free liquid–vapor interface. Probed locally, the interfacial density fluctuations exhibit large variances that exceed those expected for an ideal gas. Qualitatively consistent with theories of the free liquid–vapor interface, we find that the water interface near large and strongly nonpolar solutes is flickering, broadened by capillary-wave fluctuations. These fluctuations result in transitions between locally wet and dry regions that are slow on a molecular time scale...|$|R
40|$|International audiencePump-probe time-domain thermoreflectance is {{commonly}} used for thermal characterisation of thin films. Lock-in detection at the pump modulation frequency provides in-phase and out-of-phase components of the temperature oscillations. The thermal conductivity is then obtained by fitting this signal to a diffuse heat spreading model. In 2007, Koh and Cahill reported a significant reduction of thermal conductivity with modulation frequency in semiconductor alloys. They attributed this effect to the assumption that phonons with mean free path longer than the thermal penetration length do {{not contribute to the}} measured conductivity. The effect has been successfully reproduced but remained poorly understood. We propose a model that incorporates ballistic transport as internal heat source for the diffusive channel. The results show frequency dependent behaviour similar to the experimental data, even for a given mean free path (MFP). Moreover, the ballistic single pulse response shows accelerated decays compared to the the diffuse one but yet the <b>extracted</b> <b>apparent</b> conductivity is reduced at high modulation frequencies. This strongly suggests that the reduction of apparent conductivity can be mostly attributed to pulse accumulation effects and the fitting procedure...|$|R
