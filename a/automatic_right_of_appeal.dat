2500|$|An ASBO {{was very}} similar to a civil {{injunction}} even though the differences are important. First, the injunction was supposed to protect the world at large, in a given geographical area, rather than an individual. Second, breach of an ASBO was a criminal offence to be tried in a criminal court applying the criminal standard of beyond all reasonable doubt. A power of committal to prison was available for breach of a civil injunction but a court was unlikely to exercise that power.

40|$|Chapter 19 of the NAFTA {{transfers}} {{judicial review}} of U. S., Canadian, and Mexican government investigations under the controversial anti-dumping and countervailing duty (AD/CVD) laws from national courts to binational panels of private international law experts. The system stands as a unique surrender of judicial sovereignty to an international body, a hybrid of national courts and international dispute settlement with as yet no parallel {{in the world of}} international trade or other international law regimes. Binational panel decisions have been controversial because agencies chafe at their intimate examination of agency findings and supporting evidence. Panels also are viewed as substantially more likely to overturn agency conclusions than national courts. Given the record of chapter 19 NA ETA panels, the author examines whether the system created to fill a unique need among the NAFTA parties may have broader utility, albeit one perhaps less true to its original purpose. We will recall that U. S. recalcitrance on proposed changes to its AD/CVD laws (and its agricultural subsidies) were the principal reasons that Brazil forced Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) talks onto the back burner to await the Doha Round results on these issues. The United States is unlikely to condone major changes to the WTO Anti-Dumping and Subsidies Agreements, which will become the final sticking point for reaching agreement after members resolve the agriculture issues now blocking conclusion of the Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations. Thus, trade remedies will again surface as major issues once FTAA talks resume. Studies indicate that binational panels reverse agency decisions at a greater rate than national courts and that existence of the system has reduced the rate of filing of industry requests for AD/CVD investigations. Rather than finding an elusive set of substantive revisions to these laws, might changing the method of review of agency determinations furnish a missing piece in the puzzle of FTAA negotiations? Although Brazil 2 ̆ 7 s (and other FTAA countries 2 ̆ 7) officials may at first glance see nothing in a Chapter 19 process that fails to address their substantive AD/CVD conflicts with the United States as to orange juice, steel, and other Brazilian exports, further reflection may reveal that Chapter 19 has demonstrated yet again what good lawyers have always known, that procedure can become substance in the twinkle of an eye. In short, more than one way exists to reduce the effect of U. S. AD/CVD investigations. Improvements would have to be made, including introduction of an <b>automatic</b> and effective <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>appeal</b> whose absence arguably undercuts the credibility of the process by awarding enormous power to panels. Adoption of a system such as NAFTA 2 ̆ 7 s chapter 19 on a 34 -nation basis not only may ameliorate long-intractable conflicts over trade remedy laws, implementation of such a system will have substantial positive effects for civil society in general. Dispute settlement systems promote timeliness, inclusive record keeping, and impartiality in the administrative decisional process. They improve governmental accountability on several levels. By improving participation of all levels of society in their governance, international trade dispute settlement systems strongly promote the rule of law...|$|R

5000|$|CPIL {{advocacy}} {{resulted in}} some legislation demarking medical regulation from most other trades and professions. Instead of a generic group of “consumer investigators” within the Department of Consumer Affairs, the Medical Board has specialized investigators. Similarly, the Office of Attorney General {{now has a}} dedicated medical quality unit that prosecutes these cases. And the Office of Administrative Hearings, providing the Administrative Law Judges (ALJs) that try the cases, also now has a distinct group that conducts the trials, allowing a smaller group of judges to experience many cases in this subject area, rather than spreading the cases across ALJs that handle alcohol, financial, real estate and many other areas of regulation. CPIL sponsored legislation creating those changes (SB 2375 (Presley) in 1990 and SB 916 (Presley) in 1993). The Medical Board cases may now be brought within three steps instead of four to five. Traditionally and as to most agencies, after the ALJ hearing, the proposed decision is still reviewed ‘’de novo’’ by the Medical Board (which has no judicial expertise and did not view the testimony - a step CPIL opposes) and then moves to independent judgment review by a superior court, <b>automatic</b> <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>appeal</b> {{to the court of}} appeal, and discretionary Supreme Court review. In the case of the Medical Board, CPIL won a change that makes the appellate court review by petition (and therefor discretionary). CPIL argued that the difference here is that a third level of appeal “of right” means even spurious appeals can delay final decision for years. So the Medical Board system has somewhat fewer proceedings and with some enhanced expertise by the officials involved.In addition to general process, CPIL has directed substantial advocacy to the problem of alcohol and drug abuse among professionals, including doctors, nurses and other health professionals, and attorneys. As Medical Board Enforcement Monitor, Professor D'Angelo Fellmeth audited the [...] "diversion" [...] program of the Medical Board—allowing those accused of incompetence or other dangerous practice to delay or mitigate their discipline through substance abuse programs. She also found a great deal of [...] "gaming" [...] of the system. [...] Her conclusions repeated similar findings of two prior audits by the Office of the State Auditor. Another audit after her report again repeated the same critique. Accordingly, the diversion program of the Medical Board was terminated by unanimous vote of the Board effective in 2011. CPIL's stated position is not to oppose drug/alcohol rehabilitation, but to avoid using rigged treatment that is not policed nor achieves compliance, as a means to continue practice without adequate disciplinary protection and with resulting patient jeopardy.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{determine}} {{why most}} patients do not exercise their {{right of appeal}} against detention under section 2 of the Mental Health Act 1983. DESIGN [...] Part one [...] retrospective analysis of the clinical notes of patients detained under section 2 of the Mental Health Act. Part two-interviews with patients on the penultimate day before the deadline for lodging an appeal. SETTING [...] In part one, five districts in the Oxfordshire Regional Health Authority. In part two, six hospitals from three districts in the region. SUBJECTS [...] In part one all patients detained under section 2 in the five districts in 1993 (n = 418). In part two interviews with 40 patients detained under section 2 in the six hospitals. RESULTS [...] Patients {{were more likely to}} appeal if they were educated to A level standard (odds = 2. 26; P = 0. 0014) or had had a previous admission (2. 19, P = 0. 0029). Patients with a diagnosis of depression (0. 31; P = 0. 0. 15) or dementia (0. 0003, P = 0. 0001) were less likely to appeal. Compared with those who appealed (n = 12) those who did not (n = 28) showed less understanding of their rights (P = 0. 034) and poorer comprehension of sentences from the booklet describing patients' rights (P = 0. 057). The main reasons given for not appealing were not being aware of the appeals process and being deterred by having to appeal in writing. After they received a full explanation of their rights 12 of those who did not appeal said that they wished to appeal and four did so within the time remaining before the deadline.

40|$|Legislation {{regulating}} minimum {{sentences in}} South Africa was re-introduced by sections 51 to 53 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 105 of 1997 which came into operation on 1 May 1998. These provisions {{were regarded as}} a temporary measure to be effective for two years, where after they were extended from time to time. After they had been extended for several times, section 51 was rendered permanent on 31 December 2007 by the Criminal Law (Sentencing) Amendment Act 38 of 2007. At the same time sections 52 and 53 were repealed by the same Act. Minimum sentence legislation {{was the result of}} a call by the community for heavier penalties and for the offenders to serve more realistic terms of imprisonment. There was also a general dissatisfaction about the perceived leniency of sentences imposed by the courts for serious crimes. During 1996 and in the wake of these concerns the Minister of Justice requested the South African Law Reform Commission to investigate all aspects of sentencing in South Africa. A Project Committee chaired by a judge of the High Court was appointed and it operated from the late 1996 to March 1998. Minimum sentences for certain serious crimes were one of the options to be investigated by the Project Committee. Consequent to this the Criminal Law Amendment Act 105 of 1997 was promulgated with effect from 1 May 1998. The legislature intended this Act to defer criminal activity, to avoid disparities in sentencing and to deal harshly with perpetrators of serious offences. The subsequent amendments to the Act included the granting of jurisdiction to the Regional court to pass life imprisonment, an <b>automatic</b> <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>appeal</b> against life imprisonment in respect of a juvenile accused and identification of circumstances that do not constitute substantial and compelling circumstances. Judicial discretion and departure from prescribed minimum sentences had initially presented a problem regarding its interpretation in a variety of cases in our courts. Eventually our courts came up with a clear interpretation of the meaning of the phrase substantial and compelling circumstances. This research project will analyze the provisions of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 105 of 1997 with regard to minimum sentences for certain serious offences. In the process case law and other literature will be discussed regarding the interpretation of minimum sentence provisions in the Act.

40|$|Chickens {{launched}} by former immigration minister Philip Ruddock are {{coming home to}} roost in the portfolio of Senator Amanda Vanstone. Peter Mares argues {{that it is time}} to clean up the mess In October 1999, Philip Ruddock created the three-year temporary protection visa (TPV) for refugees who arrived on our shores without authorisation. Prior to this everyone recognised as a refugee in Australia was granted permanent residence, regardless of how they got here. Ruddock’s aim was to deter Middle Eastern asylum seekers who were arriving in increasing numbers by boat from Indonesia by granting them a second-class refugee status, which prevented them from applying for family reunion. The policy not only failed, it had the unintended effect of encouraging more women and children to make the voyage on dangerous boats, since that was the only way to reunite families in Australia. The bulk of the 8912 TPVs issued since temporary visas were introduced have been given to refugees from Afghanistan (3661 visas) and Iraq (4269). Those visas have now expired or will soon expire, which means that the refugees must either return home or prove to the Department of Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA) that they need on-going protection in Australia. TPV holders generally attempt the latter approach and the department generally turns them down. As of 14 May 2004, DIMIA had made 1192 primary decisions made on TPV holders applying for further protection; in 991 cases the application had been refused. Most of these decisions involved refugees from Afghanistan. The government’s argument - the same argument used when it offered Afghans cash incentives called ‘reintegration packages’ to be repatriated - is that since the fall of the Taliban the refugees are no longer at risk of persecution in their homeland. The refugees have an <b>automatic</b> <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>appeal</b> to the Refugee Review Tribunal, however, and the tribunal is proving to be much more sympathetic to the Afghans’ plight. Since the beginning of this financial year, the tribunal has considered the appeals of 271 Afghans who had been told by DIMIA that they were no longer refugees. In 244 of those cases, the tribunal ‘set aside’ the department’s decision, arguing that the applicants in question should be allowed to stay in Australia. In short, the tribunal says immigration department officers got it wrong 90 per cent of the time, when they refused to grant further protection to refugees from Afghanistan whose temporary visas had expired. This is an extraordinary figure, given that on average the tribunal overturns less than 10 percent of all cases. So why are the immigration department and the refugee review tribunal reaching opposite conclusions in TPV cases from Afghanistan? When the question was raised late last month in Senate Estimates, the explanation was that circumstances in Afghanistan had changed between the time decisions were made by DIMIA officers and the time those cases came before the tribunal. In other words, the tribunal was acting on newer, more negative country information than departmental decision makers. But refugee lawyers say this is only part of the picture. Another factor is the interpretation put on that country information. DIMIA has consistently put a positive spin on the situation in Afghanistan (in marked contrast to the dire travel warnings issued by the Department of Foreign Affairs). Most Afghan applicants are from the Hazara ethnic minority and most Hazara are Shia Muslims. In Sunni-majority Afghanistan they have experienced discrimination over generations. The Hazara were a special target for abuse under the former Taliban regime and, in the view of the tribunal, they are still at risk. A summary judgement, printed in the tribunal’s May monthly report, describes the situation in the following terms. The Tribunal noted that progress had been made in eradicating the Taliban and the ethnic and religious persecution of the Hazaras. However it found that the trend to improvement had been influenced by recent deteriorations involving attacks by the Taliban, worsening security, and uncertainty around international support and involvement. In other decisions, the tribunal has found that Taliban supporters are still ‘active and dangerous’ in particular provinces and questioned whether government authorities could provide ‘adequate protection’ for returning refugees. One tribunal member found that ‘there was a discriminatory failure on the part of the Afghan government’ to provide residents of the Hazara area of Kabul with ‘access to law enforcement’. The fact that departmental officers appear to wear rose coloured glasses when viewing country information from Afghanistan goes some way to explaining the discrepancy in decision making between DIMIA and the tribunal. But according to refugee lawyer David Manne, there is another more important factor. Manne is the coordinator of Melbourne’s Refugee and Immigration Legal Centre and sits on the board of the Refugee Council of Australia. He says that when a refugee on a temporary visa seeks further protection in Australia, DIMIA and the tribunal apply completely different legal tests. DIMIA requires applicants to prove their case for refugee status all over again, as if they had just arrived in Australia, whereas the tribunal puts the onus of proof on the authorities to show why the applicant is no longer a refugee. DIMIA’s approach is based the definition of a refugee contained in Article 1 A of the 1951 Refugee Convention - that is, it requires applicants to demonstrate a well founded fear of persecution on the basis of their race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership of a particular social group. The tribunal’s approach is based Article 1. C (5), known as the cessation clause, which applies when the circumstances under which a person was granted refugee status ‘have ceased to exist’. In applying this test, the tribunal must be convinced that change in the homeland is so fundamental and so durable that the returning refugees are no longer at risk - a difficult case to make in relation to Afghanistan. The courts will eventually decide which approach is correct. In the meantime, the department is setting the bar much higher than its review body. Refugees stumble at the first hurdle but frequently clear the second. This is a waste of public money (this year the Finance Department costed tribunal cases at $ 3500 each) and causes unnecessary suffering to vulnerable people, who may wait months for their cases to be decided. The potential for further waste and further delay is great. There are another 400 Afghan cases awaiting decisions at the tribunal and DIMIA has only just started processing applications from Iraqi refugees whose TPVs have expired and who are seeking further protection. (Processing of Iraqi applicants was frozen for more than a year because of the uncertain political situation in post-war Iraq.) THERE are indications that the immigration minister, Amanda Vanstone, is looking to clean up the TPV mess and come up with a more pragmatic solution. It is understood that she has requested an options paper from her department on how to deal with Iraqi refugees on temporary protection visas. It is to be hoped that this process may produce a sensible outcome, such as a mechanism to convert all temporary protection visas to permanent visas (unless there is strong evidence to indicate that the initial visa was obtained under false pretences). This would also address one of the other iniquities of the convoluted TPV system, which means that some TPV holders may never be eligible for permanent residence in Australia (and so never be able to apply for family reunion or travel outside Australia without giving up all right of return). But refugee advocates and lawyers are not holding their breath. Even if Senator Vanstone comes up with a workable solution, chances are that she will fail to win backing for it in cabinet. After all, this is what happened to her predecessor, Philip Ruddock, when he tried to argue for a special humanitarian visa for asylum seekers from East Timor. The East Timorese cases were frozen for years pending the outcome of protracted legal proceedings. By the time DIMIA began considering the East Timorese cases, Indonesia was no longer occupying East Timor and their chances of being recognised as refugees were slim. When Ruddock failed to secure cabinet approval for a special visa for the East Timorese, what emerged instead was a cumbersome ‘work around’ solution. East Timorese asylum seekers are forced to go through the motions of applying for refugee status with DIMIA, then appealing to the tribunal, even though there is almost no chance of a successful outcome in either case. It is only after jumping through those hoops that the East Timorese can make an individual request to the minister to use her non-compellable discretion to grant a visa on humanitarian grounds. While the minister generally takes a sympathetic view of the East Timorese cases, this is hardly good public policy. Unfortunately, a similar messy outcome is foreseeable in the case of TPV-refugees seeking further protection. But even in Senator Vanstone is unable or unwilling to push for a comprehensive solution, she could at least improve the current TPV shambles by instructing DIMIA officers to apply the same legal test and use the same country information assessment as their colleagues at the Refugee Review Tribunal.
