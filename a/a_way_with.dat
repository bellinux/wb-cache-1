It {{was a little}} bit {{frustrating}} at first but eventually we found a way to communicate. You figure out <b>a</b> <b>way.</b> <b>With</b> music it's so much about the vibe and the energy and you know when things are working and when they’re not. When you're working with someone for the first time, there's a kind of shyness that everybody has, so with Benny it was more challenging because of that but we figured it out and by the end I felt like I knew him very well.|$|E

Short, who felt {{he had a good}} ear for dialogue and had encouraged him to write plays. His first instinct was to create a crisis between his leading lady and her college professor, but he decided her passion needed to be politics, not writing. What evolved was a male character who had <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>with</b> words but no strong inclination to apply himself to a career using them.|$|E
25|$|The Constitution of the Irish Free State {{was adopted}} in October 1922 {{and came in}} force on 6 December 1922. It {{originally}} provided for a process of amendment {{by means of a}} referendum. However the constitution could initially be amended by the Oireachtas for eight years. The Oireachtas chose to extend that period, meaning that for the duration of its existence, the Free State constitution could be amended at will by parliament. By virtue of the 1922 Constitution Act, the constitution could not be amended in <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>with</b> conflicted with the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921 ratified by both the United Kingdom and the Irish Republic. However the Statute of Westminster removed that restriction in 1931 as far as British (but not Irish) law was concerned. It was amended 24 times between 1925 and 1936.|$|E

[...] Fritz had a [...] "glib, smooth and self-assured" [...] personality, characteristics Crumb {{felt he was}} lacking in. According to Pahls, [...] "To a great extent, Fritz was his wish-fulfillment... do great deeds, have wild adventures, and undergo a variety of sex experiences, which he himself felt he couldn't.

Previously equipped with Hudsons, the unit had just begun converting to the more advanced Douglas Boston when Newton arrived. A comrade described him as a [...] "big brash, likeable man who could drink most of us under the table, was a good pilot, good at sports, and had <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>with</b> girls". No.22 Squadron was engaged in convoy escort and anti-submarine patrols off Sydney from July to September, before moving north to Townsville, Queensland.

500|$|In the episode's {{original}} plot, Dupre was to {{have jumped}} into Mulder's body. There was, however, a belief {{at the time that}} neither Scully nor Mulder should directly experience such phenomena; Fox and the studio argued against the idea of using Mulder in such <b>a</b> <b>way.</b> <b>With</b> more than a little reluctance, the producers agreed to make the change. As writer Howard Gordon later recalled, [...] "We'd wanted Mulder to experience the soul switch". Eventually, however, Fox's stance was changed; most notably, in the two-part sixth season episode, [...] "Dreamland", when Mulder's consciousness is exchanged with government agent Morris Fletcher. Gordon ultimately came to believe that the final decision was almost certainly for the best and saw the benefit of introducing Scully's former boyfriend as it provided a welcome opportunity to delve into her history.|$|E
500|$|Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly {{described}} Scar as [...] "a {{figure of}} both pity and evil, and of treacherous comedy" [...] with [...] "Irons... filling this devious coward with elegantly witty self-loathing." [...] As an animator, Deja believes that [...] "If {{you have a}} great voice to work with, your work is half done." [...] Enjoying the way in which Irons [...] "has <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>with</b> words and phrasing," [...] Deja deliberately based much of Scar's appearance on the actor himself, specifically the shape of his mouth and facial expressions. Several of the actor's physical attributes were incorporated into Scar's design, with Irons admitting to recognizing his own baggy eyes in his character. Additionally, Deja studied Irons' performances in the films Reversal of Fortune (1990) and Damage (1992) for inspiration, while refusing to watch Disney's The Jungle Book while working on The Lion King in order to avoid being influenced by the film's villain Shere Khan, a tiger.|$|E

People magazine named Usher the [...] "Sexiest R Star" [...] in 1998, with singer Monica who said on stage sexiness was manifest in [...] "his movements, his gestures, the way he expresses his lyrics." [...] Actress Adrienne Frantz who played with Usher in The Bold and the Beautiful also said [...] "Usher definitely has <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>with</b> women. His smile is sweet and sexy at the same time", and added [...] "he's a great kisser." [...] He was included on it's [...] "Sexiest Men Alive" [...] list in 2004, as he was 4 years later again in 2008. Usher was ranked number-one on BET’s [...] "All Shades of Fine: 25 Hottest Men of the Past 25 Years" [...] in 2005. Madame Tussauds New York also unveiled a wax figure of Usher during a competition to launch The Usher Interactive Experience.
