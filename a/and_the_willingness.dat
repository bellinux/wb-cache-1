500|$|Bismarck {{expressed}} {{the essence of}} Realpolitik in his subsequently famous [...] "Blood and Iron" [...] speech to the Budget Committee of the Prussian Chamber of Deputies on 30 September 1862, shortly after he became Minister President: [...] "The great questions of the time will not be resolved by speeches and majority decisions—that was the great mistake of 1848 and 1849—but by iron and blood." [...] Bismarck's words, [...] "iron and blood" [...] (or [...] "blood and iron", as often attributed), have often been misappropriated as evidence of a German lust for blood and power. First, the phrase from his speech [...] "the great questions of time will not be resolved by speeches and majority decisions" [...] is often interpreted as a repudiation of the political process—a repudiation Bismarck did not himself advocate. Second, his emphasis on blood and iron did not imply simply the unrivaled military might of the Prussian army but rather two important aspects: {{the ability of the}} assorted German states to produce iron and other related war materials <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>willingness</b> to use those war materials if necessary.|$|E

500|$|Hunter College {{became the}} main recruit-training center for enlisted WAVES: chosen {{because of its}} space; location; ease of transportation, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>willingness</b> of the college to make its {{facilities}} available. Captain William F. Amsden, also a recipient of the Navy Cross in World War I, was named the commanding officer. On 8 February 1943 the college was commissioned the U.S. Naval Training Center, the Bronx, and became known as U.S.S. Hunter. Nine days later, approximately 2,000 recruits began their six-weeks of indoctrination. The training objectives {{were meant to be}} {{similar to those of the}} boot camp for men. In Lady in the Navy, Joy Hancock described the indoctrination of the recruits in this way: [...] "Each recruit went through a balanced training program. She was instructed in Navy ranks and ratings; ships and aircraft of the fleet; naval traditions and customs; and of course, naval history. Physical training and fitness were stressed. As the women marched in platoons to classes, medical examinations, and drills, their approach was signaled by singing, their voices providing the cadence for marching feet." [...] Between 17 February 1943 and 10 October 1945, some 80,936 WAVES, 1,844 SPARS, and 3,190 women Marines completed the training course. [...] The SPARS and Marine reservists used the Navy's training center until the summer of 1943, at which time they established their own training centers.|$|E
