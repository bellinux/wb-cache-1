In 14games with Pittsburgh, he scored two goals and four points, while recording seven points in seven games with Cleveland.

Instead, he was assigned to Cleveland for their playoff season, in which he recorded four points in four games. Frustrated by his ongoing demotions to the IHL, at one point during the season he requested to be traded from Pittsburgh.|$|E

5|$|In the Wild Card {{game against}} Denver, Manning passed for 458yards and fourtouchdowns. However, the Colts' 2004 season ended in Foxborough for <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>straight</b> {{season with a}} 20–3 loss against New England, when Manning {{recorded}} a season-low passer rating of 69.3. It was Manning's seventh consecutive loss to the Patriots in Foxborough and the Colts' three points were their lowest single game point total since their opening game of the 2003 season. Manning was named a Pro Bowl starter; in the Pro Bowl, he threw three touchdowns in a 38–27 victory and was named the game's MVP. Manning was also a unanimous first-team All-Pro selection.|$|E
5|$|The Browns {{ended with}} an 11–3 record the {{following}} year and comfortably won the East {{for the second year}} in a row. That set up <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>straight</b> appearance in the NFL Championship game in Green Bay against the Packers. The teams battled it out on a slippery, mucky Lambeau Field on January 2, 1966. While score was close early on, Vince Lombardi's team held the Browns scoreless in the second half, winning 23–12 in an upset on a Paul Hornung touchdown. Despite Jim Brown's retirement after the 1965 season, the Browns had another four consecutive winning seasons and advanced to the NFL championship game in 1968 and 1969 under Collier, but lost both times.|$|E
5|$|The Champs Sports Bowl {{was thus}} forced to select Boston College. Boston College players and fans, {{owing to the}} {{decreased}} status of the Champs Sports Bowl {{when compared with the}} Orange, Chick-fil-A, and Gator Bowls, were disappointed with the selection and match against Michigan State. Had Boston College won the ACC Championship Game, it would have earned the automatic bid to the Orange Bowl, and Virginia Tech would have been selected by the Chick-fil-A Bowl, which had earlier expressed an interest in inviting the Hokies to the game for <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>straight</b> year. Clemson would have been bumped down to the Gator Bowl, and Virginia would have been forced into the Champs Sports Bowl.|$|E
5000|$|After Audium/Koch {{closed its}} country division, Singletary signed to Shanachie Records.

5|$|The {{following}} {{year was a}} strong one as Jim Brown gritted out another league-leading rushing season. The Browns ended with an 11–3 record and comfortably won the eastern division. That set up <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>straight</b> appearance in the NFL Championship game against the Packers on a slippery, mucky Lambeau Field on January 2, 1966. While the score was close early on, Vince Lombardi's team held the Browns scoreless in the second half, winning 23–12 in an upset on a Paul Hornung touchdown. After the season, the NFL and the competing American Football League agreed to merge starting in 1970, but would play an inter-league championship from the 1966 season onward. The 1965 championship thus became the NFL's last before the Super Bowl era, which ushered in a new age of popularity and prosperity for professional football.|$|E

During a game against the Detroit Tigers on July 1, Wilson blew a save for <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>straight</b> game and was taken out of the game by Bruce Bochy. Upon entering the dugout, Wilson took out his frustrations by throwing a Gatorade cooler and smashing it with a bat. The Giants still won the game 4–3 as Jeremy Affeldt got the save. Wilson was elected to his third All-Star Game; he earned the save in a 5–1 victory over the AL.|$|E
5|$|At Denver, Manning again led three scoring {{drives in}} the fourth quarter in a 34–31 shootout win. He {{completed}} 32-of-39 passes for 345 yards and three touchdowns. Following <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>straight</b> season with a win at New England, then a home win against Buffalo, the Colts were the NFL's last unbeaten team at 9–0. Their first loss would come in Dallas. Plagued by a run defense that would allow over 100 yards in every game, the Colts were 11–4 heading into their final game. Against Miami, Manning threw for 282 yards, two touchdowns and rushed for another touchdown. The Colts won 27–22, were AFC South division champions, and clinched the third seed in the AFC playoffs. Manning was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week. He ended the regular season with 4,397 passing yards and a league-leading 31 touchdown passes. His passer rating (101.0) was the highest in the league for the third year in a row. Manning helped the offense set an NFL record for third down conversion rate in a season (56.1%).|$|E

5|$|Hershey lost 2–1 in {{overtime}} against Binghamton on October 21.

The Bears were held to a single goal in <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>straight</b> game in a 3–1 loss to Connecticut Whale on October 26, but the next day saw their first home win and first shutout victory of the season.

Orlov would miss the next four games due to an upper body injury, not returning until November 11.|$|E
5|$|The Steelers {{entered the}} season as {{defending}} champions of the AFC North Division, coming off a 10–6 record in 2007. Based on the previous season's results, the team faced the most difficult schedule in over 30 years; however, they were called Super Bowl contenders by ESPN. The Steelers opened their regular season on September 7, with a win over the Houston Texans {{en route to a}} 12–4 record, and <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>straight</b> AFC North Division title. In his second season as head coach Mike Tomlin was selected in fan balloting as the Motorola Coach of the Year. Linebacker James Harrison was named the NFL's Defensive Player of the Year after leading a defense which set the standard for the league in nearly every defensive category, including total yardage allowed, points allowed, passing yardage allowed, first downs allowed, yards per play, and yards per pass, among others. The playoffs began on January 11, 2009, with a win over the San Diego Chargers.

5|$|A 2–1 away defeat to Barrow saw {{the team}} {{knocked out of}} the FA Trophy in the quarter-final, Pacquette scoring for York. York {{suffered}} <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>straight</b> league defeat after being beaten 2–1 away by Forest Green Rovers, in which Mackin scored after his shot hit {{the back of an}} opposition player. Chester's expulsion from the Football Conference resulted in York having the three points gained against them from a 3–2 victory expunged, meaning the team moved down to sixth in the table. York were defeated 2–1 at home by Salisbury, after Sangaré had put the team in the lead. Chesterfield midfielder Paul Harsley joined on loan {{until the end of the}} season, and made his debut in a 0–0 draw away to Altrincham, a result that ended a run of three consecutive defeats. York's first victory in six league matches was a 1–0 away win over Mansfield, Pitt scoring his first goal for the club. McWilliams was loaned out to Northern Premier League Premier Division club Whitby Town for one month. A second successive victory came after Barrett scored the only goal in a 1–0 away victory over Kidderminster.

A 4–0 victory away to Grays saw Brodie score for the first time since January 2010 with two goals; Harsley and Barrett also scored.|$|E

5|$|The {{emergence}} of countryman Stanislas Wawrinka as a Grand Slam singles champion in 2014 renewed hope for Federer in his Davis Cup quest, and the pair both committed to playing each tie that year. Their commitment would pay off as wins over Serbia, Kazakhstan and Italy allowed the Swiss team {{to advance to}} the 2014 Davis Cup Final. Leading into the final, Federer was suffering from a back injury that threw serious doubt over Switzerland's chance to claim the title, and <b>a</b> <b>second</b> rubber <b>straight</b> sets loss to Gaël Monfils seemingly spelled the worst for Switzerland. However, a rejuvenated Federer returned the next day to help claim the doubles rubber, which set up a fourth rubber singles tie between Federer and Richard Gasquet.
