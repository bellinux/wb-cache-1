5|$|A radical {{strategy}} for avoiding predators which may otherwise kill {{a large majority}} of the emerging young of a population is to emerge very rarely, at irregular intervals. This strategy is seen in dramatic form in the periodical cicadas, which emerge at intervals of 13 or 17 years. Predators with a life-cycle of one or a few years <b>are</b> <b>unable</b> to reproduce rapidly enough in response to such an emergence, so predator satiation is a likely evolutionary explanation for the cicadas' unusual life-cycle, though not the only one. Predators may still feast on the emerging cicadas, but <b>are</b> <b>unable</b> to consume more than a fraction of the brief surfeit of prey.|$|E
5|$|On land, their {{movements}} become very erratic. They crawl awkwardly {{in these situations}} and can become quite aggressive, striking wildly at anything that moves, although they <b>are</b> <b>unable</b> to coil and strike {{in the manner of}} terrestrial snakes.|$|E

5|$|Attack by the ant Crematogaster laeviuscula is {{different}} from attacks by birds. Rather than knocking down the nest, the ants swarm all over the nest and remove the brood from it. The ants destroy the entire brood but they <b>are</b> <b>unable</b> to kill the adults.|$|E

Following a lead, Dana learns that Em's murderer has bribed a guard at the facility to abduct Em to prevent a formal investigation into her death. Dana arrives in time to save Em and escape.

5|$|Furthermore, while patriarchal {{marriages are}} one of the great wrongs perpetrated upon women, Wollstonecraft argues that a greater wrong is women's lack of independence. Because they <b>are</b> <b>unable</b> to find respectable, well-paid work, they are reliant upon men. Women such as Jemima are reduced to hard {{physical}} labor, stealing, begging, or prostituting themselves in order to survive; they are demeaned by this work and think meanly of themselves because of it.|$|E

That night, they hear Josh's agonized screams in the {{darkness}} but <b>are</b> <b>unable</b> to locate him. Mike and Heather theorize that Josh's screams are a fabrication by the witch in order to draw them out of their tent.|$|E
5|$|In Singapore, {{attempted}} suicide, abetment of suicide, and abetment {{of attempted}} suicide are criminal acts. This applies to physicians who aid patients in ending their lives. Such physicians <b>are</b> <b>unable</b> {{to claim a}} defence under section 88 of the Penal Code since they intended to cause the patients' deaths. However, physicians are absolved of liability if patients refuse treatment for terminal illnesses by issuing advance medical directives.|$|E

5|$|Kidney {{dysfunction}} typically develops 1–2days {{after the}} initial muscle damage. If supportive treatment is inadequate to manage this, renal replacement therapy (RRT) may be required. RRT removes excess potassium, acid and phosphate that accumulate when the kidneys <b>are</b> <b>unable</b> to function normally and is required until kidney function is regained.|$|E
5|$|Lactose is the {{naturally}} occurring sugar found in milk. A molecule of lactose is {{formed by the}} combination of a molecule of galactose with a molecule of glucose.

5|$|Many birds {{actively}} {{defend a}} territory from {{others of the}} same species during the breeding season; maintenance of territories protects the food source for their chicks. Species that <b>are</b> <b>unable</b> to defend feeding territories, such as seabirds and swifts, often breed in colonies instead; this is thought to offer protection from predators. Colonial breeders defend small nesting sites, and competition between and within species for nesting sites can be intense.|$|E
5|$|Marine {{researchers}} {{note that}} mammals and birds {{get the most}} attention but smaller creatures {{at the base of}} the ocean food chain are also harmed by the oil. Life on the sea floor and near the shore such as mussels, barnacles, and other shellfish <b>are</b> <b>unable</b> to move out of the way. When exposed to oil, these organisms suffer 90%-plus mortality and recovery of the population can take decades.|$|E

5|$|Several {{species of}} storm petrel are {{threatened}} by human activities. One species, the Guadalupe storm petrel, {{is thought to have}} gone extinct. The principal threats to storm petrels are introduced species, particularly mammals, in their breeding colonies; many storm petrels habitually nest on isolated mammal-free islands and <b>are</b> <b>unable</b> to cope with predators like rats and feral cats.|$|E
5|$|The Enterprise {{receives}} a distress signal from a shuttlecraft returning Deanna Troi from a conference. They {{find that the}} shuttle has crashed on a desolate planet, Vagra II, and while they can find the life signs of Troi and the pilot, they <b>are</b> <b>unable</b> to beam the two to the ship. An away team beams down and discovers an animated pool of a tar-like substance, a malevolent life form that calls itself Armus. When Lt. Yar attempts to approach the shuttle, Armus hurls her back with a psychokinetic blast, killing her instantly. The away team is {{brought back to the}} Enterprise but the damage to Yar is too great for Dr. Crusher (Gates McFadden) to repair, and they <b>are</b> <b>unable</b> to resuscitate her. A second away team is sent to the planet. Armus taunts the crew members and maintains his grasp of the shuttle. During this time, Troi has communicated with Armus and learned that it is a physical manifestation of evil from the bodies of an ancient race, abandoned on Vagra II.|$|E
