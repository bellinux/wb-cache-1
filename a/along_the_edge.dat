5|$|Bats also {{possess a}} system of {{sphincter}} valves on the arterial side of the vascular network that runs <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of their wings. In the fully open state, these allow oxygenated blood to flow through the capillary network across the wing membrane, but when contracted, they shunt flow directly to the veins, bypassing the wing capillaries. This allows bats to control the amount of heat exchanged through the thin flight membrane, allowing them to release heat during flight. Many other mammals use the capillary network in oversized ears for the same purpose.|$|E
5|$|From {{the end of}} the Heian {{and into}} the Kamakura period, hyōgo-gusari were fashionable {{mountings}} for tachi. <b>Along</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of both the scabbard and the hilt they were decorated with a long ornamental border. They were originally designed for use in battle and worn by high-ranking generals together with armour; but in the Kamakura period they were made due to their gorgeous appearance exclusively for the dedication at temples and Shinto shrines. The corresponding blades from that time are unusable.|$|E

5|$|Gorgosaurus {{lived in}} a lush {{floodplain}} environment <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of an inland sea. It was an apex predator, preying upon abundant ceratopsids and hadrosaurs. In some areas, Gorgosaurus coexisted with another tyrannosaurid, Daspletosaurus. Although these animals were roughly the same size, {{there is some evidence}} of niche differentiation between the two. Gorgosaurus is the best-represented tyrannosaurid in the fossil record, known from dozens of specimens. These plentiful remains have allowed scientists to investigate its ontogeny, life history and other aspects of its biology.|$|E
5|$|MFP Baseball, which {{purchased}} the Sounds in early 2009, invested over $2million to make repairs and upgrades to the aging stadium's playing field, restrooms, concession stands, scoreboard, sound system, and seating. The infield was re-sodded and leveled, protective railing was installed <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of the field, and the backstop netting was replaced. The entire concourse and guitar scoreboard were repainted, broken seats were replaced, and Sluggers Sports Bar & Grill was remodeled. A permanent concert stage {{and a family}} fun zone were constructed by the concourse entrance.|$|E
5|$|On July 21, 1989, OTA {{approved}} {{a contract to}} transplant approximately 290 live trees {{in the path of}} the turnpike to locations <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of the right-of-way. There, the trees would serve as a barrier between the road and the surrounding properties, masking the road from view and muffling the sounds of traffic. A Norman landscaping firm performed the work, which included thirty months of maintenance, for a total cost of $288.50 per tree ($544.19 in 2013 dollars).|$|E

5|$|Platform A2 {{is built}} <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of the {{retaining}} wall behind Pyramid A1. It faces west towards the pyramid {{and has two}} access stairways. Three successive versions of the platform were built, each overlying the previous. The earliest version sat upon the early retaining wall, as did the second version. The final version was much larger and was built after the new retaining wall had extended the available area for Group A.|$|E
5|$|When {{exploiting}} distant {{food sources}} found in clearings, grey jays were observed temporarily concentrating their caches in an arboreal site <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> {{of a black}} spruce forest in interior Alaska. This allowed {{a high rate of}} caching in the short term and reduced the jay's risk of predation. A subsequent recaching stage occurred, and food items were transferred to widely scattered sites to reduce theft.|$|E
5|$|Early on September 21, {{the motion}} {{shifted to the}} north as it moved along the {{northwest}} periphery of the subtropical ridge. That general motion continued throughout the day, however, Helene began to turn more northeastward that evening <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of the subtropical ridge, east of Bermuda. A decrease in wind shear and relatively warm water around 81°F (27°C) kept the intensity mostly stationary, keeping Helene as a Category1 hurricane. The intensity held around 80mph (130km/h) before strengthening slightly late on September 22, despite losing some tropical characteristics (it was operationally downgraded to a tropical storm for a brief period) as it accelerated northeast in the north Atlantic. A QuikSCAT analysis early on September 23 confirmed a high-end Category1 hurricane with 90mph (145km/h) winds.|$|E

5|$|In early September1972, a {{tropical}} disturbance developed within a near-equatorial trough near the Northern Mariana Islands. On September11, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) began monitoring this system as {{a tropical}} depression shortly after moving through the island chain. Initially, the system tracked southwestward before turning northwestward <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of a ridge. On September13, a United States Air Force reconnaissance plane flew into the system {{and found that it}} had intensified into a tropical storm. At this time, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began monitoring the newly named Tropical Storm Helen. Additionally, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration began warning on the system, assigning it the local name Paring. The following day, Helen attained typhoon status as it turned northward. Subsequently, a deepening trough over the East China Sea caused the typhoon to turn north-northeastward and accelerate.|$|E
5|$|Midway between Fulton and the Minetto {{hamlet of}} the same name, NY48 serves Battle Island State Park, named for a small island in the Oswego River a short {{distance}} to the north. NY48 presses onward <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of the Oswego to the hamlet of Minetto, where it intersects CR24, formerly NY48A. North of the hamlet, NY48 passes by the Oswego Country Club as it enters the Oswego city limits. Once in the City of Oswego, NY48 becomes West First Street. At Utica Street, NY48 briefly turns west before turning back north at West Fifth Street and terminating at NY104 (Bridge Street). West First Street continues north for an additional six blocks to the Lake Ontario shoreline. NY48 is city-maintained within the cities of Fulton and Oswego; {{the rest of the}} highway is maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT).|$|E
5|$|NY268 {{began at}} an {{intersection}} with NY5 in the hamlet of Clarence {{in the town}} of the same name. It headed north, following Salt Road out of the hamlet and into a mostly rural area of northeastern Erie County. Here, the route intersected with several east–west highways of local importance and passed by Beeman Creek Park before meeting Tonawanda Creek Road at a junction on the southern bank of Tonawanda Creek. The highway turned west at this junction, following Tonawanda Creek Road <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of the creek to the Clarence–Amherst town line, where NY268 ended at a junction with NY78 in the hamlet of Millersport.|$|E

M-96 turns south on Helmer Road, separating from the other two trunklines, and then turns east crossing along Columbia Avenue. Here the highway runs <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of the city of Battle Creek through more residential areas and crosses the I-194/M-66 freeway next to the Riverside County Club. Near Brownlee Park, M-96 (Columbia Avenue) merges with BL I-94 (Michigan Avenue). Together BL I-94/M-96 continues along Michigan Avenue to I-94 where BL I-94 ends. M-96 passes the Firekeepers Casino, which is located just east of the ending of BL I-94, between 11 and 12 Mile Roads. M-96 continues along Michigan Avenue through farmland from Emmett to Marshall ending at an interchange with I-69/BL I-94.|$|E

5|$|Tessellation or tiling in two {{dimensions}} {{is a topic}} in geometry that studies how shapes, known as tiles, can be arranged to fill a plane without any gaps, according to a given set of rules. These rules can be varied. Common ones are {{that there must be}} no gaps between tiles, and that no corner of one tile can lie <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of another. The tessellations created by bonded brickwork do not obey this rule. Among those that do, a regular tessellation has both identical regular tiles and identical regular corners or vertices, having the same angle between adjacent edges for every tile. There are only three shapes that can form such regular tessellations: the equilateral triangle, square, and regular hexagon. Any one of these three shapes can be duplicated infinitely to fill a plane with no gaps.|$|E
