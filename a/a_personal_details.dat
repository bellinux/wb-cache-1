This dataset collected by Fintan Murphy contains the results of baseline testing and testing at yearly intervals following the introduction of a classroom-based string program. It also contains the results of testing which looked in particular at the influence juggling has on coordination in violin playing. 142 participants, who were Primary School Children aged 7 - 12, from five schools were assessed for musical skills. Each participant completed <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> <b>details</b> form to record age, gender, favourite leisure activities and informal and formal music training. There was a control group of 68 children (who had no violin or juggling tuition), a group of 82 children who received only violin tuition through the Intensive Strings program and a group that received juggling plus violin tuition. Each participant completed a baseline music skills assessment test before violin tuition started and 3 follow up assessment tests over a three year period.

40|$|By the end {{of their}} training, medical {{students}} should have demonstrated a proficiency in communication and acquired attitudes consistent with effective medical practice. Few studies have explored medical students ' attitude within a communication skills learning and teaching context. The current study aims to identify the attitudes of medical students towards communication skills learning and to consider their relationships with students, demographic and education-related characteristics. To achieve such aim, a total of 470 medical students from Alexandria Medical School (4 th and 5 th year) completed the 26 -item Communication Skills Attitude Scale and <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> <b>details</b> questionnaire satisfactorily. Univariate and multivariate analysis were used to find out The relationship between students ' attitude and, some demographic and education- related characteristics. The results showed that, the attitude of medical students towards communication skills learning was significantly more positive among 5 th year batch than their counterparts. In addition, students born to a father or a mother who was a doctor had a significantly lower score on the negative subscale compared to students born to parents in other occupations. Being a student in the 5 th year independently predict higher scores on the positive attitude subscale. As revealed by multivariate analysis, being a student in the 5 th year and having a father who is a doctor independently predict lower scores on the negative attitude subscale. It is then recommended to consider teaching communication skills in advanced years when students are exposed to clinical settings. Learning communication skills should go {{hand in hand with the}} practice in clinical setting as this will add more to its tangible value. Further longitudinal studies are recommended in this respect...|$|E
40|$|There {{is limited}} {{published}} {{research on the}} practices of strength and conditioning (S &C) coaches in Great Britain. Information about training program design would be useful in developing models of good practice and ecologically valid intervention studies. The aim {{of this research was}} to quantify the training practices of coaches responsible for the S&C of rowing athletes. A questionnaire was developed that consisted of 6 sections: (<b>a)</b> <b>personal</b> <b>details,</b> (b) physical testing, (c) strength and power development, (d) flexibility development, (e) unique aspects of the program, and (f) any further relevant comments regarding the athletes prescribed training program. Twenty-two rowing and 10 S&C coaches with an average of 10. 5 ± 7. 2 years' experience agreed to complete the questionnaire. Approximately, 34 % coached rowers of Olympic standard, 34 % coached national standard, 3 % coached regional standard, 19 % coached club standard, and 10 % coached university standard rowers. All coaches agreed that strength training enhanced rowing performance and the majority (74 %) indicated that athletes' strength trained 2 - 3 times a week. Almost all coaches (94 %) reported their rowers performed strength training, with 81 % using Olympic lifting, and 91 % employing a periodized training model. The clean (63 %) and squat (27 %) were rated the most important prescribed exercises. Approximately 50 % of coaches used plyometrics such as depth jumps, box drills, and standing jumps. Ninety-four percent indicated they conducted physical testing on their rowers, typically assessing cardiovascular endurance (80 %), muscular power (70 %), muscular strength (70 %), and anaerobic capacity (57 %). This research represents the only published survey to date on the S&C practices in rowing within Great Britain...|$|E

40|$|There {{is minimal}} {{research}} on the practices of strength and conditioning coaches in England. Information about training programme design could be useful in developing models of good practice and ecologically valid intervention studies. The {{aim of the research}} was to quantify the training practices of coaches responsible for the strength and conditioning of rowing athletes. A questionnaire was developed and consisted of six sections: (<b>a)</b> <b>personal</b> <b>details,</b> (b) physical testing, (c) strength/power development, (d) flexibility development (e) unique aspects of programme and (f) any further relevant comments regarding the athletes prescribed training programme. Twenty two rowing and ten strength and conditioning coaches with an average of 10. 5 + 7. 2 years experience agreed to complete the questionnaire. Approximately, 34 % coached Olympic standard rowers, 34 % national standard, 3 % regional, 19 % club, and 10 % university standard rowers. All coaches agreed that strength training enhanced rowing performance and the majority (74 %) indicated athletes strength trained 2 – 3 times a week. Most coaches (94 %) reported their rowers performed strength training, with 81 % using Olympic lifting, and 91 % employing a periodised training model. The clean (63 %) and squat (27 %) were rated the most important exercises prescribed within the training programme. Approximately 50 % of coaches used plyometrics such as depth jumps, box drills and standing jumps. Ninety four percent indicated they conducted physical testing on their rowers, typically assessing cardiovascular endurance (80 %), muscular power (70 %), muscular strength (70 %) and anaerobic capacity (57 %). On average, testing was conducted by coaches in pre-season (88 %) and inseason (91 %), while only 31 % preformed postseason testing. Coaches typically prescribed static stretching (97 %), dynamic stretching (69 %), PNF stretching (56 %). This research provides detailed information on the current strength and conditioning provision in rowing within Great Britain. Future studies could use this information to develop experimental protocols to examine the effect of current or new strength and conditioning interventions on rowing performance...|$|E
40|$|This thesis was {{designed}} to explore the experiences of psychologists in Australia who work as psychotherapists, and who {{have an interest in}} Buddhism. The core research question was: What are the professional and personal experiences and perspectives of psychologists in Australia who are informed by Buddhism in the way they conceptualise, approach, and conduct psychotherapy? Two related supporting questions were: How do Buddhist principles inform different aspects of psychotherapy (e. g., therapist self-care, client interventions) ? and In what ways do therapists incorporate Buddhist concepts (e. g., compassion) and techniques (e. g., mindfulness) into psychotherapy? In Study 1, the qualitative core of the research, I explored the experiences and impressions of psychologists interested in bringing a Buddhist perspective to psychotherapy. Initial and follow-up interviews were conducted with 14 participants. Buddhist understandings, including suffering, compassion, and mindfulness, were discussed in relation to psychotherapy. Participant psychologists revealed that certain Buddhist ideas and techniques contributed to their perceived efficacy and wellbeing as therapists, as well as to good therapeutic processes and outcomes for clients. Using an interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) approach, the two guiding principles of compassion and wisdom emerged from the interviews. Under the guiding principle of compassion, the two major themes that emerged were: the truth of suffering (sub- themes: an acknowledgement of suffering, causes of suffering, and suffering as a path), and compassionate engagement (sub-themes: empathy, openness, and hopefulness). The guiding principle of wisdom also incorporated two major themes: mindful presence (subthemes: a present orientation, the primacy of direct experience, and being with what is), and empowerment through understanding (sub-themes: responsibility, disclosure, and sustaining). The benefits participants perceived for themselves included being sustained by Buddhism, and having increased empathy and mindfulness during therapy. The Buddhist techniques and ideas that participants employed with clients were selected with discernment for their therapeutic benefits along with their compatibility with Western psychology. Participants also used their discretion to select those techniques and ideas that had wide applicability in that they were common to many philosophical and religious systems. Although some participants took an integrationist approach to drawing on Buddhism in psychotherapy, and others took an eclectic approach, all shared the concern of remaining client-centred. Attributing Buddhist sources and labels to concepts and techniques was considered unnecessary in most cases. Study 2 provided descriptive background information and gave support to the qualitative themes that emerged from Study 1. Members of the Buddhism and Psychology Interest Group, the Christianity and Psychology Interest Group, and the College of Counselling Psychologists of the Australian Psychological Society (APS) completed <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> <b>details</b> survey, the Spiritual Orientation Inventory (SOI; Elkins, Hedstrom, Hughes, Leaf, & Saunders, 1988), and the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale – Short Form C (W. M. Reynolds, 1982), indicating their spiritual paths and religious affiliations, and the relative importance of different dimensions of spirituality. The main dimension on which the Buddhism and Psychology Interest Group scored higher than the other two groups was the Awareness of the Tragic dimension. The results are interpreted with reference to Buddhist, Christian, and secular understandings. The thesis concludes with a chapter on my personal reflections as researcher in the research process. ...|$|E
