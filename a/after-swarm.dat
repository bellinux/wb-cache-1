2500|$|When a young virgin queen {{emerges from}} a queen cell, she will {{generally}} seek out virgin queen rivals and attempt to kill them. Virgin queens will quickly find and kill (by stinging) any other emerged virgin queen (or be dispatched themselves), {{as well as any}} unemerged queens. [...] Queen cells that are opened on the side indicate that a virgin queen was likely killed by a rival virgin queen. [...] When a colony remains in swarm mode after the prime swarm has left, the workers may prevent virgins from fighting and one or several virgins may go with after-swarms. [...] Other virgins may stay behind with the remnant of the hive. Some virgins have been seen to escape the hive to avoid being killed and seek out another without a queen, such as in the eusocial bee Melipona scutellaris. As many as 21 virgin queens have been counted in a single large swarm. When the <b>after-swarm</b> settles into a new home, the virgins will then resume normal behavior and fight to the death until only one remains.|$|E
50|$|A small <b>after-swarm</b> {{has less}} chance of {{survival}} and may threaten the original hive's survival {{if the number of}} individuals left is unsustainable. When a hive swarms despite the beekeeper's preventative efforts, a good management practice is to give the reduced hive a couple frames of open brood with eggs. This helps replenish the hive more quickly and gives a second opportunity to raise a queen if there is a mating failure.|$|E

If the prime swarm has a virgin queen and the old queen, the old queen will usually be allowed to live. The old queen continues laying. Within a couple of weeks she will die a natural death and the former virgin, now mated, will take her place.|$|E
40|$|Honeybee colonies {{reproduce}} by colony fission and swarming. The {{primary swarm}} leaves the nest with the mated mother queen. Further "after-swarms" {{can leave the}} nest. These are composed of virgin queens and sister workers. Since all workers in the primary swarm have the same relationship to the mother queen, kin recognition cannot have any e#ect on the worker distribution in the swarm. Because of polyandry of the mother queen, the <b>after-swarm</b> is composed of superand halfsister workers of the virgin queen. In this case kin recognition might a#ect swarm composition if workers increase their inclusive fitness by preferentially investing in a supersister queen. The distribution of workers in the mother colony, the primary and the afterswarm was analyzed using single-locus DNA fingerprinting in two colonies of the honeybee (Apis mellifera). The colonies were composed of 21 and 24 worker subfamilies because of multiple mating of the queen. The subfamily distribution in the mother colonies before swarming was significantly di#erent from the subfamily frequencies in the primary swarm. This indicates di#erent propensities for swarming in the various subfamilies. The subfamily distribution was also significantly di#erent between the mother colony and the <b>after-swarm.</b> There was however no significant di#erence between the subfamily composition of the primary and the afterswarm. The average e#ects of kin recognition {{on the distribution of}} the subfamilies in the two after-swarms were less than 2 %. We conclude that colony-level selection sets the evolutionary framework for swarming behaviour...|$|E
