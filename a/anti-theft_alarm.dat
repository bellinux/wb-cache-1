Underneath sat a box-section aluminum impact bar on two Omark-bolt slider brackets {{similar to the}} system used in the nose which allowed the Corvette to pass federal five-mph impact tests at the rear {{as well as the}} front. The new rear design was quite beautiful, and more up-to-date than the 60's shape that it replaced with the vast majority of enthusiasts embracing the new design. For the 1974 model only, casting limitations mandated left and right bumper covers with a vertical center seam.

Rare options: ZR1 special engine package (20), shoulder belts with convertibles (749), LT1 engine option (1,741).|$|E
2500|$|For 1968, {{both the}} Corvette body and {{interior}} were completely redesigned. As before, {{the car was}} available in either coupe or convertible models, but coupe was now a notchback fitted with a near-vertical removable rear window and removable roof panels (T-tops). A soft folding top was included with convertibles, while an auxiliary hardtop with a glass rear window was offered at additional cost. Included with coupes were hold down straps {{and a pair of}} vinyl bags to store the roof panels, and above the luggage area was a rear window stowage tray. The enduring new body's concealed headlights moved into position via a vacuum operated system rather than electrically as on the previous generation, and the new hide-away windshield wipers utilized a problematic vacuum door. The door handles were flush with the top of the doors with a separate release button. Front fenders had functional engine cooling vents. Side vent windows were eliminated from all models, replaced with [...] "Astro Ventilation", a fresh air circulation system. In the cabin, a large round speedometer and matching tachometer were positioned in front of the driver. Auxiliary gauges were clustered above the forward end of the console and included oil pressure, water temperature, ammeter, fuel gauge, and an analog clock. A fiber-optic system appeared on the console that monitored exterior lights and there was no glove box. The battery was relocated from the engine area to one of three compartments behind the seats to improve weight distribution. New options included a rear window defroster, <b>anti-theft</b> <b>alarm</b> system, bright metal wheel covers, and an AM-FM Stereo radio.

2500|$|... 1979 saw the crossed-flag emblems on {{the nose}} and fuel door revert to those seen on the '77 model. Three popular {{features}} introduced on the '78 pace car replicas made it into this year’s production: the new bucket seats, {{the front and rear}} spoiler package, and the glass roof panels. The new lightweight “high back” seats were made standard equipment. The new seats had better side bolster, provided easier access to the rear storage area, and the seat pair resulted in a weight reduction of about 24pounds. The bolt-on front and rear spoilers were offered as an option and nearly 7,000 cars were ordered so equipped. Functionally, the spoilers decreased drag by about 15% and increased fuel economy by about a half-mile per gallon. A bigger hit were the glass mirror-tint roof panels, now a regular option, with nearly 15,000 cars so fitted despite their costing $365. All T-tops were now wired into the standard <b>anti-theft</b> <b>alarm</b> system.

An auxiliary electric engine cooling fan was first installed, but only on L-82 equipped cars with air conditioning. Rocker panels and rear window trim were painted black.

This was also the last year for the M21 close-ratio 4-speed, a gearbox that, as in previous years, required the optional L-82 engine. A wide-ratio 4-speed was available for all cars. Noteworthy is that about 82% of the cars were ordered with manual transmissions in 1968. In '79, less than 20% of the cars were delivered with manual gearboxes. This year reached an all-time high in Corvette popularity. Production hit its peak in 1979 at 53,807, a record that stands to this day.|$|E

5000|$|The base Leganza {{was offered}} with a 2.0L 4-cylinder engine, 5-speed manual, hubcaps, cloth trim {{and all the}} {{standard}} power options. It had an optional 4-speed, hydraulically operated transmission that {{was said to be}} rough operating, tended to hunt between gears, and do unnecessary downshifts to second gear. Ride quality was poor, as was cabin noise intrusion. In 1999, Daewoo made revisions to the model. The rough-operating hydraulic auto was replaced by an electronically controlled automatic transmission, which stopped the hunting between gears and random downshifts. The engine was upgraded to the 2.2 l, which boosted power from [...] to , giving better performance, but increasing fuel consumption. The Leganza also gained standard 15-inch alloy wheels, <b>anti-theft</b> <b>alarm,</b> and remote central locking. The suspension was fixed and improved, but sacrificed the smooth ride from the before model and the ability to soak up the bumps. In 2001 the Leganza gained leather upholstery, woodgrain trim, and an electric driver's seat. This was called the [...] "Limited Edition". In 2002 the Nubira gained a leather interior, woodgrain, <b>anti-theft</b> <b>alarm,</b> alloy wheels and remote locking; this too was considered the [...] "Limited Edition".|$|E

Starting in 1995, the Mexican Beetle included front disc brakes, an alternator instead of a generator, and front automatic seat belts. During the 1995 model year, the chrome moldings disappeared leaving body colored bumpers and black moldings instead on some models. By the start of the 1996 model year, exterior chrome or matt moldings were dropped altogether and Volkswagen de Mexico (VWdM) dropped the Sedan's flow-through ventilation system with all its fittings, notably the exterior crescent-shaped vents behind the rear side windows the same year.|$|E

A new experimental WSN ad-hoc has been designed to be an <b>anti-theft</b> <b>alarm</b> system. Each node of the network is directly installed under each PV string and it is equipped with an accelerometer sensor capable to detect a minimum displacement of the panel from its steady position. The WSN presents a star topology: a master node cyclically interrogates the slave nodes through RF link. It collects all the nodes responses and communicates though a RS- 232 interface with a control PC checking the network status. When a slave node detects an alarm, continuous messages are sent to the control PC which turns on all the alarm signaling systems. The control PC is equipped with an open source operative system and software and provides for SMS, e-mail and sound-light signaling in case of alarm. It also communicates with a remote server where all the WSN information is stored. A first low cost experimental WSN has been already installed and it is working properl...|$|E
40|$|There {{exists a}} {{dichotomy}} {{in the design}} of modem electronic systems: the simultaneous need to be low power and high performance. This arises largely from their usage in battery-operated portable (wearable) platforms. Accordingly, the goal of low-power design for battery-powered electronics is to extend the battery service life while meeting performance requirements. Designers of portable embedded systems therefore focus on power management methods to increased system performance while reducing operating power consumption. Static and dynamic power management policies, memory management schemes, bus encoding techniques, and hardware design tools are needed to meet these often-conflicting design requirements. The present work was motivated by the need for a low-power device that can be used as an <b>anti-theft</b> <b>alarm</b> system for high-end bikes. The implemented system is a highly low-power object tracking system using GPS and GPRS technologies. The system calculates the position coordinates using GPS technology and sends them to a server through GSM technology. The system can also intelligently detect any motion on the bike and report suspicious activities on the bike. The system operates on very low power and is capable of remaining functional for weeks on a regular battery. The system can switch to an ultra-low power mode in order to extend the battery life for months. This thesis discusses hardware and software techniques for power management system to design a low-power portable embedded system. Also, the designed power management system for this application is described. In the final chapter, development of the proposed device and implementation of the designed power management methods are defined...|$|E
