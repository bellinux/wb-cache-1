It first reviews non-wage labour costs, both for workers with permanent contracts and those with only temporary contracts, or with no contracts at all, {{in order to show}} the differences that exist in non-wage labour costs according to the type of contract of the workers or their unregistered status, and the impact of these differences on the labour costs for each type of worker and the <b>average</b> <b>labour</b> <b>costs.</b> It then goes on to consider the evolution of labour costs in industry and the different levels they assume according to the deflator used, because of the changes in relative prices which accompanied {{the early years of the}} economic and trade openness process which has taken place in the region. It then analyses the evolution of labour costs in industry by type of contract and the changes in the <b>average</b> <b>labour</b> <b>costs</b> in the sector brought about by the dual strategy of reducing non-wage labour costs and changing the contract structure of industrial employment; describes the effect of exchange-rate lag on <b>average</b> <b>labour</b> <b>costs</b> and competitiveness, and calculates how the latter would have evolved if there had not been such a lag. Finally, some proposals are made for raising the competitiveness of labour in the countries of the region...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper uses a linked employer-employee dataset {{to analyse}} {{the impact of}} {{institutional}} wage bargaining regimes on levels of <b>average</b> <b>labour</b> <b>costs</b> and within firm wage dispersion in private sector companies in Ireland. The results show that while centralised bargaining reduced labour costs within both the indigenous and foreign-owned sectors, the relative advantage was greater among foreign-owned firms. The analysis {{suggests that there are}} potentially large competitiveness gains to multinational companies that choose to locate in countries implementing a centralised bargaining system. Furthermore, the results provide additional support to the view that collective bargaining reduces within firm wage inequality...|$|E
40|$|EMU is {{accompanied}} by increased market integration and factor mobility - especially of the production factor capital. Up to date, {{there is no clear}} indication concerning the specialisation tendencies to be expected due to these impacts. This paper thus investigates the driving forces of sectoral investment specialisation of EU regions. Regional investment patterns are compared to average EU patterns in order to identify the relative sectoral investment specialisation of EU regions. The econometric analyses aim at identifying the regional determinants of high relative sectoral investments, i. e. the regional investment specialisation in different sectors. The importance of a number of determinants from different theoretical approaches is tested controlling for heteroscedasticity, potential endogeneity and spatial autocorrelation. Regional factor cost or productivity differentials are supposed to matter according to traditional trade theory. Sectoral productivity differentials between regions generally contribute to the explanation of relative investment shares in the manufacturing sectors analysed. We also find evidence for the relevance of regional labour cost differentials. Relative investment specialisation in some traditional, labour intensive sectors is higher in those regions profiting from low <b>average</b> <b>labour</b> <b>costs.</b> Relative investment shares in a number of capital intensive or skill intensive sectors, instead, are higher in regions marked by higher <b>average</b> <b>labour</b> <b>costs.</b> Since investments in most manufacturing sectors are attracted by those regions in central parts of each country and not by regions far away from the core, we might be confronted with backwash effects predicted by the polarisation theory for peripheral regions. In addition, the location close to large markets seems to matter for many manufacturing sectors. Market integration, which according to the New Economic Geography (NEG) is supposed to enforce agglomerative forces, however, does not play a particular role in the different kinds of sectors. In earlier studies, we found evidence for the stronger relative regional specialisation of core as well as of peripheral regions. The results of this econometric analysis now demonstrate that the determinants of the high relative specialisation of peripheral regions differ from those of economic centres. The driving forces of investment specialisation are favourable for core regions with respect to growth-oriented market services. In addition, stronger relative investment shares of peripheral regions in non-market services as well as building & construction point to their high dependence on non-market economic activities and to their poor economic performance. Important manufacturing sectors are rather attracted by regions with higher <b>average</b> <b>labour</b> <b>costs</b> - probably reflecting the need for high-skilled labour. Lowering the regional level of labour costs thus {{does not seem to be}} an adequate measure of attracting manufacturing production of growth industries...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{theoretical}} model is developed {{to identify the}} main determinants of the proportion of temporary workers at firms. The outcomes show {{that the proportion of}} temporary workers has a counter-cyclical behaviour: it grows during the slump period up to 1995 and falls during the subsequent recovery. However, given the effect of the general economic cycle, firms that raise their sales or improve their market dynamism index tend to increase their proportion of temporary workers. This proportion also rises when the <b>average</b> <b>labour</b> <b>cost</b> decreases, firm size increases, and the knowledge capital stock diminishes. ...|$|R
30|$|At this point, it {{is crucial}} to {{understand}} the nature of this increased turnover. In particular, it is interesting to explore whether it is mainly driven by separations or accessions and which may be the channel behind it. One possible mechanism acts through the increased turnover of temporary workers (see Bulligan and Viviano, 2016). Firms that are constrained by wage rigidities may exploit the turnover of temporary workers either to renegotiate their wage or to hire a different worker, whose wage will reflect the new cyclical conditions. In this way, firms can exploit flexibility on the employment margin in order to adjust their <b>average</b> <b>labour</b> <b>cost.</b>|$|R

One of the main constraints faced is the uncompetitiveness of the non-extractive tradable sector. In 1990 - 2003, competitiveness improved in this sector essentially {{as a result of}} lower labour costs, a socially unjust and economically ineffective route to follow. To raise competitiveness, it is essential for the macroeconomic regime to include a competitive real exchange rate (to which there are obstacles); and higher productivity at the microeconomic level.

30|$|We also {{conduct an}} {{analysis}} {{at the firm}} level and we identify firms that were historically characterized by different levels of wage rigidities in order to study their behaviour during the crisis. We find {{that there is a}} wage employment trade-off also as far as their adjustment is concerned: firms structurally characterized by higher wage rigidity adjusted more often along the employment margin by increasing their turnover in the period 2009 – 2013. These larger employment adjustments were mostly driven by rigid firms with a high enough share of temporary workers, easier to fire. Moreover, we find that the average wage per employee of rigid firms adjusted less during the crisis but that those firms endowed with a larger portion of temporary workers managed to partly compress their <b>average</b> <b>labour</b> <b>cost</b> in any case. Our conjecture is that these firms managed to deal with the challenges of the recessionary conditions not by directly reducing wages of job stayers but by indirectly containing the <b>labour</b> <b>cost</b> through firing of temporary workers and hiring of new ones with lower salaries. This source of flexibility through temporary workers allowed firms to survive in a rigid institutional setting. Reforms of the latter may reduce the need of using temporary workers as a flexibility margin during downturns.|$|R

This paper seeks to fill this gap by empirically investigating business and financial characteristics, stakeholder pressures and public policies to distinguish companies that have implemented the European Eco-Management and Audit System (EMAS) from a unique firm-level dataset of European publicly quoted companies. We find that the EMAS participation decision is positively influenced by the solvency ratio, the share of non-current liabilities, the <b>average</b> <b>labour</b> <b>cost</b> and the absolute company size as well as the relative size of a company compared to its sector average. The profit margin exerts a negative influence. We further find that companies whose headquarters is located in a country that actively encourages EMAS have a higher probability of participation.

We consider a dynamic structural model in which, in each period, firms face a choice of whether to vary the labour input or to postpone the adjustment to the future. By exploiting the first order condition for optimality, we derive a semi-reduced form in which firms' intertemporal employment are defined by a standard static marginal productivity condition augmented by a forward-looking term. In this way we obtain a marginal productivity equilibrium relation which {{takes into account the}} future alternatives of adjustment or non-adjustment that firms face {{as the result of the}} presence of fixed and linear adjustment costs.

Quelle est l'extension de cette sécurité sociale dans les conventions collectives ? Quelles en sont les limitations ? Est-ce que la sécurité sociale organisée par l'État fera disparaître la forme contractuelle ? Voilà quelques-unes des questions auxquelles répond l'auteur. NATURE AND EVOLUTION OF COLLECTIVE BARGAININGThe practice of collective bargaining performed {{on a private}} and contractual basis surely constitutes {{one of the main}} characteristics of our present industrial relations system. This is true both for Canada and the United States according {{to the fact that the}} same «pattern », to a large extent, applies in both countries. This « contractual » or « private » character of our collective bargaining system is not determined solely by the « capitalistic » régime of our economy, nor is it exclusively a consequence of the pragmatic philosophy of our labour movement coupled with the viguor of our private law. Instead, it merely reflects, in our opinion, die traditionnally dynamic nature of the North American economy of which we are part. Our economy can still afford tolerating a certain amount of freedom in private economic decisions and competition on the labour market may take place in a measure sufficient to enable a « private » system of collective bargaining to work successfully. In spite of repeated criticisms, collective bargaining has assumed new dimensions unthought of some thirty years ago; so much so, that we may now pretend without risk of being refuted, that it really constitutes the core of the whole industrial relations system of ours. What originally was a mere compromise concerning a few items of negotiations has now become the device « par excellence » through which the labour force, not only secures the promotion of its economic interests, but also acquires a new and unproved status in our economic society. This new role of collective bargaining has been assumed progressively from the moment when trade-unionism, taking advantage of new texts of law emanating from public authorities short before the last World War, has revised its structural, functionnal and ideological positions. Union demands were no longer limited to wages and conditions of work, but covered a host of subjects heretofore considered as the exclusive prerogatives of management. Accordingly, the scope of collective bargaining was enlarged so as to include most of the workers' work-life phases, including social security in and out of the negotiations unit. In a country where social security systems emanating from the State have taken so long to develop, collective bargaining has assumed a pioneer role that is not going to vanish soon. What trade-unions have gained from governments, in other countries, they have in part secured in North America through collective bargaining. No matter the conception one has of the trade-union movement in our country, the facts clearly establish that it is through collective bargaining that workers have secured enlarged social security benefits. Long term collective agreement were relatively new twenty years ago; they are now a current practice. Attempts to solve problems of employment and income security, retirement, illness and hospitalization were not common fifteen years ago as they are today. We assist presently to a proliferation of formulae aiming at the coverage of such risks through collective bargaining. THE IMPACT OF THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING PROCESSConsidering that more than one million and a half workers throughout Canada are covered by collective agreements, it is easy to measure the impact of such a device on the standard of living and on the status of wage earning people among the Canadian population. According to a survey conducted by the Department of Labour of Canada in 1960, over 66 % of the labour force in manufacturing industries were covered by collective agreements. In the mining industry (« metal » section) the proportion attained 82 % and was up to 89 % in the « coal » section of the same industry. In Quebec, more particularly, there are presently over two thousand collective agreements in force covering more than three hundred thousand people. Moreover, owing to the strategic concentration of the trade-union membership in the most vital sectors of the economy; and due to the direct impact of the negotiations in large concerns over satellite firms, collective bargaining derives a much larger influence than official statistics show. COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AND SOCIAL SECURITY FOR WORKERSCollective bargaining in itself has already contributed largely to the social and economic security of the wage-earners. Now, through what we call « fringe benefits » collective bargaining reaches the heart of the problem of economic and social security' for union members. Twenty years ago, such benefits were largely ignored by the parties to collective bargaining. Presently, they represent something like about 20 % of the <b>average</b> <b>labour</b> <b>costs</b> in industry. Though the expression « fringe benefits » is very inclusive, there is a distinction to be made between benefits representing a mere addition to the labour income and those aiming above all at securing a better security and an improved welfare for workers and their families, without being too closely related to the remuneration of the work done. The latter are mainly to be considered when reference is made to the potentialities of collective bargaining as regards economic security and social welfare. Negotiated systems of retirement benefits, schemes for group life-insurance, accident and illness insurance, hospitalization benefits, guaranteed annual wage systems, supplementary unemployment benefits and like devices are to be counted in the latter group of benefits. They cover the main sources of insecurity for workers on the economic and familial grounds. In 1956, in Canada, according to a survey of the Department of Labour, a little more than 10 % of the existing labour agreements in the manufacturing industry provided for unemployment supplementary benefits or guaranteed employment to a different extent. For the same year (1956) about half the number of existing collective agreements studied by the survey contained clauses concerning life and accident insurance as well as indemnities for hospitalization, medical and chirurgical cares for workers and their families. Near 25 % of these agreements provided for a pension plan with the contribution, in whole or in part, of the employer. THE LIMITATIONS OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING TOWARD SOCIAL WELFAREIn spite of the fact that collective bargaining has already done much toward the social welfare of those covered by it, and irrespective of its spectacular development in this respect since one decade or two, it is unquestionably true that, by its very nature and due to the limited degree of its future expansion, such a device presents built-in limitations that one never must lose sight of. Structural and technical difficulties impose certain limits to the development of collectively bargained social security programs through «private» collective agreements. There must be, for the non-unionized labour force, and to a lesser degree, even for those covered by collective agreements, a specific and decisive intervention of the State in social welfare matters. So long as our industrial relations system remains what it is presently; so long as more than half the labour force stays outside the scope of our «private» collective bargaining institutions; so long as the means of cooperation between organized workers and managements are not improved and enlarged in some institutionalized fashion, it would be pure fancy to pretend that collective bargaining could be the global solution to welfare problems. Larger and more inclusive schemes of a private or public nature have to be deviced, toward which collective bargaining should normally assume a subsidiary function...|$|E

Concerning the volume index of GDP (Gross Domestic Product) per capita in PPS (Purchasing Parity Standards) we find Greece’s GDP per capita dropped from 4 % lower than the EU- 28 average in 2004 to 29 % lower in 2015. However, GDP is a measure of a country’s economic activity, and therefore it should not be considered a measure of a country’s well-being. If we take the AIC (Actual Individual Consumption) per capita in PPS (Purchasing Power Standard) as a better indicator to describe the material welfare of households, Greece showed an AIC index per capitalower by some 19 % than the EU- 28 <b>average</b> in 2015. <b>Labour</b> productivity per hour worked expressed in US $ (which means GDP per hour worked expressed in US $) was estimated among the lowest in the EU- 28, at $ 32 in 2015.

The results are drawn from a survey of firms conducted within the third wave of the ESCB Wage Dynamics Network (WDN 3). Overall, while changes in demand were both positive and negative over the period, aggregate wage growth remained low, although more firms experienced an increase in <b>average</b> productivity over <b>labour</b> <b>costs</b> than a decline. <b>Labour</b> <b>cost</b> reduction was achieved mainly by reduction of new hires and by individual layoffs. The main obstacles to hiring workers were uncertainty about economic conditions, high payroll taxes and a shortage of labour with the required skills. The frequency of wage changes was lower in 2010 – 2013 than before and was attributed by firms inter alia to stronger competition. Wage freezes and wage cuts were still in use, while wage growth was more likely to be observed in very small and large firms and firms with a foreign owner. The frequency of price changes in 2010 – 2013 compared to 2008 – 2009 remained unchanged for more than 80 % of firms. More frequent price changes were due to stronger competition and volatility in demand, while exchange rate changes contributed to higher frequency of price changes on foreign markets...|$|R
