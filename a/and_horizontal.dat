Clear-air turbulence can cause aircraft to plunge and so present a passenger safety hazard that has caused fatal accidents, such as {{the death of one}} passenger on United Airlines Flight 826.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{acceptance}} of heliocentrism and equal hours, as well as advances in trigonometry, sundials appeared in their present form during the Renaissance, when they were built in large numbers. In 1524, the French astronomer Oronce Finé constructed an ivory sundial, which still exists; later, in 1570, the Italian astronomer Giovanni Padovani published a treatise including instructions for the manufacture and laying out of mural (vertical) <b>and</b> <b>horizontal</b> sundials. Similarly, Giuseppe Biancani's Constructio instrumenti ad horologia solaria (c.1620) discusses how to construct sundials.|$|E

5|$|Lissitzky, {{aware of}} severe {{mismatch}} between his {{ideas and the}} existing urban landscape, experimented with different configurations of the horizontal surface and height-to-width ratios so that the structure appeared balanced visually ("spatial balance is in the contrast of vertical <b>and</b> <b>horizontal</b> tensions"). The raised platform was shaped {{in a way that}} each of its four facets looked distinctly different. Each tower faced the Kremlin with the same facet, providing a pointing arrow to pedestrians on the streets. All eight buildings were planned identically, so Lissitzky proposed color-coding them for easier orientation.|$|E

Our FPGA implementation results included in 52 MCM examples show that three different (<b>horizontal,</b> <b>horizontal</b> <b>and</b> vertical, <b>and</b> efcient <b>horizontal</b> <b>and</b> vertical) CSEs have a good area-time product performance, in the MCM matrix range of 800 and over.

5|$|The bridge's Whipple truss {{technology}} {{was developed by}} civil engineer Squire Whipple in 1847. J. W. Murphy further modified Whipple's truss design in 1859 by designing the first truss bridge with pinned eyebar connections. The design of the Capon Lake Whipple Truss Bridge incorporates Murphy's later modifications with double-intersections <b>and</b> <b>horizontal</b> chords, and is therefore considered a Whipple–Murphy truss bridge. The Capon Lake Whipple Truss Bridge is West Virginia's oldest remaining example of a Whipple truss bridge and its oldest extant metal truss bridge.|$|E

5|$|Wind shear, {{sometimes}} referred to as windshear or wind gradient, is a difference in wind speed and direction over a relatively short distance in the Earth's atmosphere. Wind shear can be broken down into vertical <b>and</b> <b>horizontal</b> components, with horizontal wind shear seen across weather fronts and near the coast, and vertical shear typically near the surface, though also at higher levels in the atmosphere near upper level jets and frontal zones aloft.|$|E
5|$|A kilim is an Islamic flatwoven carpet (without a pile), {{whether for}} {{household}} use or a prayer mat. The pattern {{is made by}} winding the weft threads back over the warp threads when a colour boundary is reached. This technique leaves a gap or vertical slit, so kilims are sometimes called slit-woven textiles. Kilims are often decorated with geometric patterns with 2- or 4-fold mirror or rotational symmetries. Because weaving uses vertical <b>and</b> <b>horizontal</b> threads, curves are difficult to generate, and patterns are accordingly formed mainly with straight edges. Kilim patterns are often characteristic of specific regions. Kilim motifs are often symbolic as well as decorative. For example, the wolf's mouth or wolf's foot motif (Turkish: Kurt Aǧzi, Kurt İzi) expresses the tribal weavers' desires for protection of their families' flocks from wolves.|$|E
5|$|All of the spaceships in {{the film}} were miniatures, as visual effects {{supervisors}} believed CGI was not effective enough to create realistic spaceships. The USM Auriga was originally designed by artist Nigel Phelps and resembled a medical instrument. This design proved to be too vertical for the film's opening shot, in which the camera pans out to show the ship, and did not appear satisfactory {{in the film}}'s 2.35:1 aspect ratio. Three days before the design had to be finalized, Jeunet rejected it. Phelps, production illustrator Jim Martin, and concept artist Sylvain Despretz were tasked to redesign the ship. Jeunet felt Martin's design was too much like a space station, while he accepted Despretz's design due to its streamlined <b>and</b> <b>horizontal</b> appearance.|$|E

5|$|Directional {{stability}} {{was achieved}} by four fixed vanes, two vertical and two horizontal, attached {{at the rear of}} the gas-bag, and by a long vertical vane running along the main axis of the gas-bag from the centre of the elliptical frame to its rear. Horizontal motion was controlled by the movement of a balanced rudder at the rear of an empennage on a long boom, mounted below the gas-bag and aft of the gondola (see lead image). The empennage consisted of vertical <b>and</b> <b>horizontal</b> vanes arranged like the fletching of an arrow, behind which the vertical rudder was mounted. During a refit in 1907 the vertical vanes of the empennage were modified, as is shown in the accompanying illustration.|$|E
5|$|Following the event, a {{field survey}} was {{conducted}} along the fault zone {{with the goal of}} estimating the peak ground acceleration of the shock based on visually evaluating precarious rock formations and other indicators. Ground disturbances that were created by the earthquakes were also surveyed, both in the valley and in the foothills, with both vertical <b>and</b> <b>horizontal</b> displacements present in the epicentral area. The strong motion records that were acquired from the event were significant, and a reconnaissance report was recognized for its coverage of the event, and how it set a standard for those types of engineering or scientific papers. Repercussions of the sequence of earthquakes were still being felt in the heavily damaged downtown area of Bakersfield well into the 1990s as city leaders attempted to improve safety of the surviving unreinforced masonry buildings.|$|E

Nevertheless, if a small region of the retina is exposed to the induction stimuli, and the test contours run through this region, the effect spreads along those test contours. Of course, if the induced area is in the fovea (central vision) and the eyes are allowed to move, then the effect will appear everywhere in the visual scene visited by the fovea.|$|R
