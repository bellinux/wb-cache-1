Patients received 5 million U/m 2 interferon three times a week for 6 mo, or no treatment.

Blinded histological assessment revealed improvement in 50 % of treated patients compared with 33 % of controls. Pretreatment hepatitis B virus DNA and aminotransferase levels and histological appearance were not predictive of response.

40|$|Hepatitis B {{e antigen}} (HBeAg) is {{detected}} in the serum of some persons infected with hepatitis B virus. Owing to a close correlation of HBeAg and hepatitis B virus in the serum, {{it has been used}} as a practical indicator of infectivity. Two entities of HBeAg activity physicochemically different from each other were demonstrated in the serum of persons infected with hepatitis B virus. One was associated with a molecule that precipitated in 1. 33 M ammonium sulfate solution, was larger than IgG, and had an electrophoretic mobility in the beta- to gamma-globulin regions and an isoelectric point of approximately pH 5. 7. In contrast, the other HBeAg activity was associated with a molecule that was soluble in 1. 33 M ammonium sulfate solution, was smaller than IgG, and had an electrophoretic mobility in the alpha-globulin region and an isoelectric point at pH 4. 8.

40|$|Four Chinese {{patients}} with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and asymptomatic chronic hepatitis B infection developed fulminant hepatitis {{three to four}} weeks after two to five courses of chemotherapy. One was initially positive for hepatitis B e antigen and three were positive for <b>antibody</b> <b>to</b> <b>HBeAg.</b> They had normal initial serum aminotransferase levels. In all four patients, the hepatic illness appeared to be caused by reactivation of hepatitis B virus replication as evidenced by the appearance of HBV DNA in serum at the onset of hepatitis, seroreversion from anti-HBe to HBeAg positivity, and the absence of other incriminating drugs or viral markers. All died within three weeks after the onset of jaundice. Serum HBV DNA level dropped to undetectable level as the hepatitis progessed. We postulate that potent cytotoxic therapy reactivated HBV replication and permitted widespread infection of hepatocytes. Upon withdrawal of chemotherapy, the immunologic rebound resulted in rapid destruction of infected hepatocytes and massive liver necrosis.

40|$|Hepatitis B virus (HBV) mutants have {{recently}} been identified in patients with acute or fulminant as well as chronic infections. Naturally occurring mutations {{have been identified in}} all viral genes and regulatory elements, most notably in the genes coding for the structural envelope and nucleocapsid proteins. Mutations in the gene coding for the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) may result in infection or viral persistence despite the presence of antibodies against HBsAg (anti-HBs) ("vaccine escape" or "immune escape"). Mutations in the gene encoding the pre-core/ core protein (pre-core stop codon mutant) result in a loss of hepatitis B e antigen (<b>HBeAg)</b> and seroconversion <b>to</b> <b>antibodies</b> <b>to</b> <b>HBeAg</b> (anti-HBe) with persistence of HBV replication (HBeAg minus mutant). Mutations in the core gene may lead among others to an "immune escape" due to a T cell receptor antagonism. Mutations in the gene coding for the polymerase/reverse transcriptase can be associated with viral persistence or resistance to nucleoside analogues. Thus, HBV mutations may affect the natural course of infection, viral clearance and response to antiviral therapy.

40|$|Infants born to {{hepatitis}} B virus carrier mothers, who {{express a}} secreted {{form of the}} nucleocapsid antigen designated HBeAg, invariably become persistently infected. To investigate the role of immunologic tolerance mechanisms in chronic infection of the newborn, we have generated HBeAg-expressing transgenic mice. HBeAg-expressing transgenic mice were tolerant to both HBeAg and the nonsecreted nucleocapsid (hepatitis B cor antigen/HBcAg) at the T-cell level. Transgenic mice did not produce <b>antibody</b> <b>to</b> <b>HBeAg</b> but did produce anti-HBc antibody in vivo and in vitro. The coexistence of tolerance to HBc/HBe T-cell determinants and anti-HBc antibody production in vivo parallels the immunologic status of neonates born to carrier mothers. It was also demonstrated that the maintenance of T-cell tolerance to HBcAg/HBeAg required the continued presence of the tolerogen and in its absence persisted for less than 16 weeks. The reversibility of T-cell tolerance to HBcAg/HBeAg may explain the inverse correlation between age of infection and rates of viral persistence.

Of the 58 samples sequenced, 24 were wild type and 34 carried mutants. The precore stop mutation (TAG) at the 28 th codon was found in 32 cases, other mutations were found in 7, and double mutations were found in 5. The absence of HBeAgshowed a substantial agreement {{with the presence of}} mutants (K value, 0. 74). Of the acute hepatitis patients, HDV replication and clinical manifestations were not significantly different between those with mutant and wild type virus, except that those with mutant virus were older (mean age, 48 vs. 28 years; P <. 002). The absence of HBeAg in these patients is mainly due to HDV superinfection in older HBV carriers who already had precore mutant.

40|$|BACKGROUND, AIM, AND METHODS: Alpha {{interferon}} is {{the generally}} approved therapy for HBe antigen positive {{patients with chronic}} hepatitis B, but its efficacy is limited. Lamivudine is a new oral nucleoside analogue which potently inhibits hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA replication. To investigate {{the possibility of an}} additive effect of interferon-lamivudine combination therapy compared with interferon or lamivudine monotherapy, we conducted a randomised controlled trial in 230 predominantly Caucasian patients with hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) and HBV DNA positive chronic hepatitis B. Previously untreated patients were randomised to receive: combination therapy of lamivudine 100 mg daily with alpha interferon 10 million units three times weekly for 16 weeks after pretreatment with lamivudine for eight weeks (n= 75); alpha interferon 10 million units three times weekly for 16 weeks (n= 69); or lamivudine 100 mg daily for 52 weeks (n= 82). The primary efficacy end point was the HBeAg seroconversion rate at week 52 (loss of <b>HBeAg,</b> development of <b>antibodies</b> <b>to</b> <b>HBeAg</b> and undetectable HBV DNA). RESULTS: The HBeAg seroconversion rate at week 52 was 29 % for the combination therapy, 19 % for interferon monotherapy, and 18 % for lamivudine monotherapy (p= 0. 12 and p= 0. 10, respectively, for comparison of the combination therapy with interferon or lamivudine monotherapy). The HBeAg seroconversion rates at week 52 for the combination therapy and lamivudine monotherapy were significantly different in the per protocol analysis (36 % (20 / 56) v 19 % (13 / 70), respectively; p= 0. 02). The effect of combining lamivudine and interferon appeared to be most useful in patients with moderately elevated alanine aminotransferase levels at baseline. Adverse events with the combination therapy were similar to interferon monotherapy; patients receiving lamivudine monotherapy had significantly fewer adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: HBeAg seroconversion rates at one year were similar for lamivudine monotherapy (52 weeks) and standard alpha interferon therapy (16 weeks). The combination of lamivudine and interferon appeared <b>to</b> increase the <b>HBeAg</b> seroconversion rate, particularly in patients with moderately elevated baseline aminotransferase levels.

40|$|IgG subclasses of <b>antibodies</b> <b>to</b> {{hepatitis}} B {{e antigen}} (anti-HBe) complexed <b>to</b> <b>HBeAg</b> were determined in 126 HBsAg-positive sera. In the assay HBeAg complexes {{were bound to}} microtitre plates by monoclonal anti-HBe and indicated by biotinylated monoclonals {{to each of the}} four human IgG subclasses. To evaluate the specificity of the complexed IgG, serum dilutions were also tested for HBeAg and for subclasses of anti-HBe IgG. Two groups of sera were investigated: (i) 64 sera from 64 HBsAg carriers; and (ii) 62 sera from 13 HBeAg-positive patients, of whom five seroconverted to anti-HBe. At least four sera were available from each of these patients. Complexed anti-HBe IgG was detected in 22 of 30 HBeAg-positive, and in three of HBeAg-negative carrier sera. There was no significant association between presence of complexed anti-HBe and levels of HBeAg in these sera. Complexes with multiple subclass composition were found in 13 of the 25 sera with complexed anti-HBe. The most common IgG subclasses found complexed <b>to</b> <b>HBeAg</b> were IgG 1 (75 %) and IgG 4 (67 %). A significant association (P less than 0. 05) was found between the presence of free and complexed anti-HBe IgG 1 in the carrier sera, indicating that the IgG 1 <b>antibodies,</b> complexed <b>to</b> <b>HBeAg,</b> were specific for HBeAg. In the five patients who seroconverted to anti-HBe, anti-HBe IgG 1 was detected in the HBeAg-positive phase before seroconversion. In the eight patients with persistent HBeAg antigenemia, free anti-HBe IgG 1 was detected in only two sera from two different patients. In one patient, complexed anti-HBe IgG 1 /IgG 4 was detected in all serum samples drawn during a period of 111 months. In conclusion, complexed anti-HBe might be detected several years before apparent seroconversion to anti-HBe in conventional anti-HBe assays.

Hepatomegaly was the only abnormal finding on examination, being present in five children initially and four at follow-up. Serum ALT levels were normal in 80 % of the children at presentation and remained within the normal range during the study in 60 %. Fluctuations in ALT levels were mild.

Results: The QA was less complex in HBeAg+ than in HBeAg- or fluctuating HBeAg. High complexity in preCore was associated with decreased viral replication (preCore MfAA negatively correlated with HBV-DNA, p = 0. 005). QA complexity in the treatment-free period negatively correlated with values seen during treatment. Specific variants were mainly selected in the Core region in HBeAg- and fluctuating HBeAg patients, suggesting higher immune pressure than in HBeAg+.

40|$|Hepatitis B virus (HBV) {{infection}} {{can cause}} acute, fulminant or chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Perinatally or childhood acquired HBV infection usually causes subclinical or anicteric acute hepatitis and {{is associated with}} a high risk of chronicity (30 to 90 % of cases), whereas adult acquired infection may cause acute symptomatic hepatitis (approximately 30 % of patients) and {{is associated with a}} low risk of chronicity (less than 5 %). Fulminant hepatic failure is unusual (0. 1 to 0. 5 % of patients), but acute coinfection with other hepatitis viruses increases the risk of fulminant hepatitis. Chronic HBV infection is a dynamic process with an early replicative phase and active liver disease and a late low or non replicative phase with remission of liver disease. Perinatally acquired HBV infection is characterized by a prolonged “immunotolerant ” phase with hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) positivity, high levels of serum HBV-DNA, normal levels of aminotransferases, minimal liver damage and very low rates of spontaneous HBeAg clearance. Patients with childhood or adult acquired infection and chronic hepatitis B usually present in the “immunoactive ” phase with elevated aminotransferases and liver necroinflammation at histology (HBeAg positive chronic hepatitis) and approximately 50 % will clear HBeAg within 5 years. The rate of spontaneous HBeAg seroconversion may vary in relation to the degree of the elevation of aminotransferases.

40|$|To {{assess the}} role of {{hepatitis}} B e antigen (HBeAg) and its interaction with hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) {{on the development of}} hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), this case-control study included 361 age- and sex-matched pairs of patients with histologically proven HCC and healthy control subjects. HBsAg, HBeAg and <b>antibody</b> <b>to</b> <b>HBeAg</b> (anti-HBe) were detected by radioimmunoassay. Antibodies to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) were detected by second-generation enzyme immunoassay. The prevalences of HBeAg (20. 2 %), HBsAg (80. 3 %) and anti-HCV (29. 5 %) in cases were higher than in controls (1. 9 %, 20. 7 %, and 2. 7 % respectively; each P < 0. 0001). Using patients negative for HBsAg, HBeAg and anti-HBe as a referent group, univariate analysis indicated that HBsAg alone or HBsAg and HBeAg were risk factors for HCC (P for trend < 0. 0001). Calculation of incremental odds ratio indicated that there was additive interaction between HBsAg and HBeAg. Multivariate analysis indicated that HCC development was strongly associated with the presence of HBeAg (odds ratio, 8. 1; 95 % confidence interval, 2. 4 - 27. 1), HBsAg (odds ratio, 68. 4; 95 % confidence interval, 20. 5 - 227. 8) and anti-HCV (odds ratio, 59. 3; 95 % confidence interval, 13. 6 - 258. 4). In conclusion, HBsAg, HBeAg and anti-HCV are independent risk factors for HCC. There is additive and independent effect modification between HBsAg and HBeAg on the development of HCC...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY Infection {{with the}} delta agent can only {{occur in the}} context of coexistent {{hepatitis}} B virus infection. We describe a patient in whom the clinical features of acute delta hepatitis developed when seroconversion from hepatitis B surface antigen to antibody had already occurred and diagnosis of recent acute hepatitis B was based on high titre IgM antibody to hepatitis B core antigen. We discuss the significance of such a serological profile, not previously described. Rizzetto and colleagues ' first recognised the existence of the delta agent in 1977 while staining liver tissue by immunofluorescence for hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg). An early observation was that delta antigen was only present in the livers of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) carriers. Infectivity studies in chimpanzees showed that delta infection could occur with both acute and chronic hepatitis B (HBV) virus infection. 2 In contrast, delta hepatitis could not be induced in HBsAg negative animals with circulating antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs). Seroepidemiological investiga-tions confirmed that the delta antigen-antibody system was only detectable in HBsAg carriers, except in rare individuals recently recovered from acute HBV and delta infection. 3 We describe a patient with acute delta hepatitis who at presentation had serological evidence of recent HBV infection but was HBsAg negative. The implications of such a serological profile, not previously described, are discussed. Methods HBsAg, hepatitis Be antigen (HBeAg), anti-HBs and <b>antibody</b> <b>to</b> <b>HBeAg</b> (anti-HBe) were tested for using commercially available radioimmunoassay kit...|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{investigate}} {{the risk factors}} for recurrence after drug withdrawal in HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients completing the treatment with nucleos(t) ide analogues (NAs). MethodsA total of 60 HBeAg-positive CHB patients who visited and were treated in The First Hospital Affiliated to Guangxi Medical University from May 2004 to December 2014 were enrolled. The drugs were withdrawn after the patients reached the criteria for drug withdrawal in related guidelines. The univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model analyses were performed for 15 factors which might influence recurrence, i. e., sex, age, {{a family history of}} HBV infection, baseline HBV DNA load, baseline total bilirubin (TBil) level, baseline alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level, baseline aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level, duration of virologic response, time <b>to</b> disappearance of <b>HBeAg,</b> time from the start of medication to the development of HBeAg seroconversion, duration of consolidation therapy after HBeAg seroconversion, total course of the treatment, prolonged course of the treatment, HBsAg level at drug withdrawal, and drug type. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for calculating the cumulative recurrence rate. ResultsThe mean course of the treatment was 37. 36 ± 12. 67 months, the prolonged course of the treatment was 7  0 (2  0 ~ 13  0) months, and 56. 7 % of all patients experienced recurrence. Sex, age, baseline HBV DNA load, baseline TBil level, baseline ALT level, baseline AST level, duration of virologic response, duration of consolidation therapy, total course of the treatment, prolonged course of the treatment, and drug type were not significantly associated with recurrence after drug withdrawal in patients who met the criteria for drug withdrawal (all P＞ 0. 05). A family history of HBV infection (RR= 1. 583, P= 0. 047), time <b>to</b> <b>HBeAg</b> seroconversion (RR= 1  205, P= 0. 015), and HBsAg level at drug withdrawal were independent risk factors for recurrence after drug withdrawal. The patients with time <b>to</b> <b>HBeAg</b> seroconversion ＞ 12 months had a significantly higher recurrence rate than those with time <b>to</b> <b>HBeAg</b> seroconversion ＜ 12 months (80  0 % vs 48. 9 %, P＜ 0. 001). ConclusionA family history of HBV infection, delayed HBeAg seroconversion, and high HBsAg level at drug withdrawal are major risk factors for recurrence after drug withdrawal in HBeAg-positive CHB patients who have met the criteria for drug withdrawal in the treatment with NAs. If HBeAg-positive CHB patients can acquire immune control, recurrence after withdrawal of NAs will be reduced...|$|R

40|$|Assessment of {{intrahepatic}} hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA {{levels in}} patients with chronic hepatitis B is important in understanding {{the natural history of}} the disease and designing antiviral therapy regimens. However, there is no standardized method for the measurement of intrahepatic HBV DNA levels. We describe a convenient novel method for the measurement of intrahepatic HBV DNA levels based on a modified COBAS Amplicor HBV Monitor test for HBV DNA measurement and real-time PCR β-actin gene detection for human genomic DNA (hgDNA) quantitation. Fifteen hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) -positive patients, 26 patients positive for <b>antibody</b> <b>to</b> <b>HBeAg</b> (anti-HBe), and 8 control patients were recruited. The mean between-run coefficient of variation for the β-actin real-time PCR assay was 15. 4 %. All eight control patients had undetectable intrahepatic and serum HBV DNA levels. All chronic hepatitis B patients had detectable intrahepatic HBV DNA levels, and all but one anti-HBe-positive patient had detectable serum HBV DNA levels. HBeAg-positive patients had higher median intrahepatic and serum HBV DNA levels than anti-HBe-positive patients (6, 950 versus 676 HBV DNA copies/ng of hgDNA, respectively [P < 0. 001] and 184 × 106 versus 6. 65 × 106 copies/ml, respectively [P < 0. 001]). The intrahepatic HBV DNA levels correlated strongly with the serum HBV DNA levels (r = 0. 842; P < 0. 001) and with the degree of fibrosis (P = 0. 014). We conclude that the method that we describe is reliable and convenient for the measurement of intrahepatic HBV DNA levels and has potential clinical significance. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The 2010 {{targets of}} the China Hepatitis B Prevention Programme were a {{prevalence}} of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) less than 1. 0 % for children {{less than five years}} old and less than 6. 0 % for the total population. This survey assessed the prevalence of Hepatitis B infection in Lianyungang, Jiangsu province, China in 2009 – 2010. Methods: Multistage sampling was used with 2372 subjects among 17 selected villages. Blood specimen collection and testing by enzyme-linked immunosorbnet assay (ELISA) were completed using the following markers for hepatitis infection: HBsAg and antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs); hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) and <b>antibody</b> <b>to</b> <b>HBeAg</b> (anti-HBe); and hepatitis B core antibody (total anti-HBc). The data were analyzed with Epi Info, version 3. 3. 2. Results: The prevalence of HBsAg was 2. 4 % (95 % Confidence Interval [CI]: 1. 8 – 3. 0; Adjusted Prevalence [AP] 2. 9 %); anti-HBs prevalence was 51. 1 % (95 % CI: 49. 1 – 53. 1; AP 49. 2 %) and total anti-HBc prevalence was 41. 7 % (95 % CI: 39. 8 – 43. 7; AP 45. 5 %). The prevalence of HBsAg and total anti-HBc positivity increased from young to older age groups, yet the prevalence of anti-HBs positivity decreased from young to older age groups (P < 0. 001 for all). There was no difference in the prevalences of HBsAg and anti-HBs among females and males (P = 0. 108 and 0. 089), but females had a higher prevalence than males for total anti-HBc positivity (P < 0. 001). Discussion: This survey showed that in 2010 the prevalence of HBsAg among children aged less than five years was lower than the national target of 1. 0 % and that the prevalence of HBsAg for the total population was lower than the national target of 6. 0 %...|$|E
40|$|Background and Aims: This study {{assessed}} the efficacy {{and safety of}} up to 4 years of lamivudine treatment and the clinical relevance {{of the emergence of}} YMDD-variant hepatitis B virus (HBV). Methods: Fifty-eight Chinese adult patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) were randomized to lamivudine 100 mg/day for up to 5 years and were monitored for YMDD-variant HBV, hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) seroconversion (loss of HBeAg and detectable <b>antibody</b> <b>to</b> <b>HBeAg)</b> and serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) concentrations. Four-year data are reported here. Results: The rate of HBeAg seroconversion increased with extended therapy and also with higher baseline ALT concentrations. YMDD-variant HBV was detected in 67 % (39 / 58) of patients at some point during treatment. After 4 years, a total of 47 % (27 / 58) of patients achieved HBeAg seroconversion. Thirty-three per cent (13 / 39) of patients with YMDD-variant HBV achieved HBeAg seroconversion; this increased to 57 % (8 / 14) in patients with moderately elevated (> 2 - 5 × upper limit of normal) pre-treatment ALT concentrations. The proportion of patients that achieved normal serum ALT increased from 29 % (17 / 58) at baseline to 69 % (31 / 45) following 4 years of treatment. That included 68 % (23 / 34) of patients with YMDD-variant HBV and 73 % (8 / 11) of those without the variant. All patients receiving lamivudine had reduced serum concentrations of HBV-DNA compared with baseline, despite the emergence of YMDD-variant HBV in 39 patients. Lamivudine was generally well tolerated; there was little change in the number or type of drug-related adverse events in the fourth year of the study. Conclusions: Despite the emergence of YMDD-variant HBV, Chinese patients showed increased HBeAg seroconversion and improvement in ALT levels with an increased duration of treatment with lamivudine. © 2004 Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
