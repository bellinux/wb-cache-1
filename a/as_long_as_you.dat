25|$|In the Dialogi de Vita Martini I, 26 by Sulpicius Seuerus (AD 363–425), {{one of the}} {{partners}} in the dialogue utters the rhetorical commonplace that his deficient Latin might insult the ears of his partners.

25|$|Attacking with monster cards is {{the main}} means by which a player reduces the opponent's Life Points to zero. These cards are also used defensively, since the opponent's monsters cannot attack your Life Points {{directly}} <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> have monsters in play (unless specified otherwise by card effects). Furthermore, most monsters cards have their own effects (just like Spell and Trap cards), and can be manipulated by other cards. Before discussing their many functions and varieties, we will outline the common components of all monster cards.|$|E

25|$|Hand loading or {{reloading}} {{is allowed}} in South Africa <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> are {{in possession of}} a competency certificate to possess a firearm as well as a license to possess such a firearm. Sport shooters load to make the shooting sports more affordable and hunters load to obtain greater accuracy. Powder and primers are strictly controlled by law and can not exceed for 2kg for powder and 2400 primers. The amount of ammunition you may have in your possession is also limited to 200 rounds per chambering. If you are a registered dedicated sportsman, the quantities are unlimited. Although the powder's quantity is unlimited if you are a dedicated sportsman, storage of excess amounts of powder is dangerous due to the potential of fire occurring from accidental ignition. A manual from a South African powder manufacturer Rheinmetall Denel Munition (previously Somchem) is available for reloaders with adequate information and guidelines.|$|E

25|$|There {{followed}} {{in quick succession}} two musicals which have secured Kelly's reputation as a major figure in the American musical film, An American in Paris (1951) and – probably {{the most popular and}} admired of all film musicals – Singin' in the Rain (1952). As co-director, lead star and choreographer, Kelly was the central driving force. Johnny Green, head of music at MGM at the time, said of him:Gene is easygoing <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> know exactly what you are doing when you're working with him. He's a hard taskmaster and he loves hard work. If you want to play on his team you'd better like hard work, too. He isn't cruel but he is tough, and if Gene believed in something he didn't care who he was talking to, whether it was Louis B. Mayer or the gatekeeper. He wasn't awed by anybody, and he had a good record of getting what he wanted.|$|E
25|$|You speak truly, O Achilli, and {{we cannot}} answer you a word. You are a Priest; {{you have been}} a Friar; you are, it is undeniable, the scandal of Catholicism, and the palmary {{argument}} of Protestants, by your extraordinary depravity. You have been, it is true, a profligate, an unbeliever, and a hypocrite. Not many years passed of your conventional life, and you were never in the choir, always in private houses, so that the laity observed you. You were deprived of your professorship, we own it; you were prohibited from preaching and hearing confessions; you were obliged to give hush-money to the father of one of your victims, as we learned from an official document of the Neapolitan Police to be 'known for habitual incontinency;' your name came before the civil tribunal at Corfu for your crime of adultery. You have put the crown on your offences, by <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> could, denying them all; you have professed to seek after truth, when you were ravening after sin.|$|E
25|$|In a 1995 Washington Post article, Jim Marks cited Bawer's {{observation}} that (in Marks's paraphrase) “it gets harder {{to claim that}} {{gay men and lesbians}} are outside mainstream culture, when so much of mainstream culture—the Mona Lisa and Moby-Dick, to use Bawer's examples—is seen as the product of gay and lesbian minds.” In a 1996 piece on gay marriage, New York Times columnist Frank Rich cited Bawer's view that there existed “a gentlemen's agreement” among Washington conservatives. He quoted Bawer as saying: “They say 'We'll socialize with you and your significant other and we'll all be charming, <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> don't mention it in public, and we get to say anything we want in public.'” A 1997 Washington Post article about an upcoming episode of Ellen DeGeneres's sitcom, “Ellen,” on which her character would come out of the closet, mimicking DeGeneres's own recent coming out, ended with a quote from Bawer. “People used to do courageous things without having a publicist around to tell the world,” he said.|$|E

25|$|Sir, I {{have the}} honor of informing you that I have arrived in this port with a {{commission}} from the Supreme Government of the United Provinces of the Rio de la Plata to take possession of these islands {{on behalf of the}} country to which they belong by Natural Law. While carrying out this mission I want to do so with all the courtesy and respect all friendly nations; one of the objectives of my mission is to prevent the destruction of resources necessary for all ships passing by and forced to cast anchor here, as well as to help them to obtain the necessary supplies, with minimum expenses and inconvenience.

500|$|Reviews of Lansbury's {{performance}} were overwhelmingly positive.

Lansbury's later biographer Margaret Bonanno claimed that Mame made Lansbury a [...] "superstar", with the actress herself commenting on her success by stating that [...] "Everyone loves you, everyone loves the success, and enjoys {{it as much as}} you do.

40|$|I had the {{privilege}} to know most {{of the founders of}} cybernetics, and three in particular I honor as mentors: Norbert Wiener, Ross Ashby, and Warren McCulloch. This year there is special reason to celebrate Warren Sturgis McCulloch, for it is his centenary year. He was born on the 16 th of November 1898, in Orange, New Jersey. Warren was a philosopher and scientist. As a freshman at Haverford College he told the Quaker philosopher Rufus Jones that all he wanted to know was: "What is a number that a man may know it; and a man, that he may know a number?" To this the Quaker famously replied: "Friend, <b>thee</b> will be busy <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>thee</b> lives. " Warren acknowledged in his last days that the prophecy had been fulfilled, and had helped him to invent cybernetics on the way. Warren was a physician and psychiatrist. He graduated fro...|$|R
