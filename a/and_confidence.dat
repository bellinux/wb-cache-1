40|$|This {{study is}} set up to assess the dynamic effects of {{business}} <b>confidence</b> <b>and</b> consumer <b>confidence</b> on stock market risk premiums and to determine {{the relative importance of}} business <b>confidence</b> <b>and</b> consumer <b>confidence</b> in forecasting the variability of stock market risk premiums though a variance decomposition. The results show that the response of stock market risk premiums becomes positive immediately following the shocks to business <b>confidence</b> <b>and</b> consumer <b>confidence.</b> Based on the variance decomposition analysis, the variability of stock market risk premiums is 95 % due to its own shock and the rest is due to the shocks to business <b>confidence</b> (1 %) <b>and</b> consumer <b>confidence</b> (4 %) for the 3 -month horizon. For the 6 -month horizon, the variability of stock market risk premiums is 93 % due to its own shock, 2 % due to business <b>confidence</b> shock <b>and</b> 5 % due to consumer confidence shock. The forecast error of stock market risk premiums is 90 % due to its own shock and the rest is due to the shocks to business <b>confidence</b> (4 %) <b>and</b> consumer <b>confidence</b> (6 %) for the 12 -month horizon. The results from the OLS time-series regression show that business <b>confidence</b> <b>and</b> consumer <b>confidence</b> jointly explain around 7. 42 % of the variation of stock market risk premiums. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{importance}} of understanding how confidence varies across {{time has been}} encouraged by sport confidence researchers (Vealey 2 ̆ 6 Chase, 2008). The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the relationship between <b>confidence</b> <b>and</b> performance throughout an entire competitive season. Two levels of confidence consistent to team sports were analyzed. Team <b>and</b> coach <b>confidence</b> were collected through the Collective Efficacy Questionnaire for Sport (CEQS) and Coaching Efficacy Scale (CES) respectively. Two teams, women’s soccer and volleyball (n= 48) from a college in the western United States, completed their specific questionnaires five times throughout the season. The CEQS measured collective efficacy (team <b>confidence)</b> <b>and</b> the CES measured coaching efficacy (coach confidence) for each team. Simple linear regressions were used to determine the relationship team <b>confidence</b> <b>and</b> coaching <b>confidence</b> had on the success of each team. Pearson’s correlation coefficients were taken to determine if team <b>and</b> coach <b>confidence</b> were connected throughout the season. Volleyball was statistically significant for both team <b>and</b> coach <b>confidence</b> at p = 0. 033 and p = 0. 040 respectively, with a. 68 correlation coefficient. Conversely, the soccer team was not statistically significant for both team <b>and</b> coach <b>confidence</b> at p = 0. 53 and p = 0. 93 for each. There was, however, a strong correlation coefficient at. 89 for the two levels. The findings suggest that team <b>and</b> coach <b>confidence</b> may be related and associated with the success of the team. The results also hint, through the correlation coefficients, that team <b>and</b> coach <b>confidence</b> may be connected...|$|R

For individual Viet Cong soldiers, the battle demonstrated they could defeat nominally superior ARVN forces, well equipped as they were with up-to-date military hardware and significant support and funding from the United States. Militarily, the morale <b>and</b> <b>confidence</b> of Viet Cong commanders and soldiers, who had experienced serious setbacks in the previous year, were greatly boosted. Politically, the Viet Cong 261st and 514th Battalions were able to exploit the prestige gained from having inflicted disproportionate losses on the ARVN forces to exercise greater influence in their areas of operations.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to examine the sport <b>confidence</b> <b>and</b> self-efficacy beliefs in {{football}} players participating in either super league (N = 48) or second league (N = 53). Athletes completed the Trait Sport Confidence Inventory (TSCI), State Sport <b>Confidence</b> Invetory (SSCI), <b>and</b> Self-Efficacy Scale (SES). Pearson Moment Correlation results indicated a positive significant relationship between State Sport <b>Confidence</b> <b>and</b> Self-Efficacy levels (r =. 492), Trait Sport <b>Confidence</b> <b>and</b> Self-Efficacty levels (r =. 493) <b>and</b> State Sport <b>Confidence</b> <b>and</b> Trait Sport <b>Confidence</b> levels (r =. 766) of the Super League players. Results also revealed a non-significant relationship between State Sport <b>Confidence</b> <b>and</b> Self-Efficacy levels (r =. 227) and a postive significant relationship was found between Trait Sport <b>Confidence</b> <b>and</b> Self-Efficacty levels (r =. 271) <b>and</b> State Sport <b>Confidence</b> <b>and</b> Trait Sport <b>Confidence</b> levels (r =. 787) of the Second League players. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) analyses revealed significant differences between the Super League and Second League players’ self-efficacy beliefs (F(1, 99) = 7. 188, p =. 009). The linear regression results revealed that for both the Super League and Second League players, trait sport-confidence predicted state sport-confidence and self-efficacy. Finally, it was revealed that the super league and second league football players were similar with regard to sport confidence, whereas, they had different self-efficacy beliefs. ...|$|R
5|$|Architecture of Scotland in the Industrial Revolution {{includes}} all building in Scotland between the mid-eighteenth {{century and the}} end of the nineteenth century. During this period, the country underwent an economic and social transformation as a result of industrialisation, which was reflected in new architectural forms, techniques and scale of building. In the second half of the eighteenth century, Edinburgh was the focus of a classically inspired building boom that reflected the growing wealth <b>and</b> <b>confidence</b> of the capital. Housing often took the form of horizontally divided tenement flats. Some of the leading European architects during this period were Scottish, including Robert Adam and William Chambers.|$|E
5|$|Attitudes toward race in America {{began to}} change after the war, which had caused social and {{political}} upheaval and prompted {{people to think about}} the future with more ambition <b>and</b> <b>confidence.</b> Although progress was slow and racially motivated hostility continued for many years, the color barrier was broken in all major sports by 1950. Many of Motley and Willis's teammates on the Browns were used to playing with black players in college, where teams were integrated across most of the country. The presence of Motley and Willis, meanwhile, contributed to strong attendance at many of the Browns' early games as large black audiences came to watch them. By one estimate, 10,000 black fans saw the Browns play their first game.|$|E
5|$|Because of Southern Rhodesia's {{small size}} {{and lack of}} major controversies, its unicameral {{parliament}} then sat only twice a year, for about three months in total, holding discussions in the afternoons {{either side of a}} half-hour break for tea on the lawn. Smith's early parliamentary commitments in Salisbury therefore did not detract greatly from his ranching. His maiden speech to the Legislative Assembly, in November 1948, concerned the Union of South Africa Trade Agreement Bill, then at its second reading. He was slow to make an impact in parliament—most of his early contributions related to farming and mining—but his exertions within the party won him Stockil's respect <b>and</b> <b>confidence.</b> Janet ran Gwenoro during Smith's absences, and gave birth to his only biological child, Alec, in Gwelo on 20 May 1949.|$|E

5|$|By {{launching}} such a spoiling {{attack against}} PAVN's long-established logistical system, the American and South Vietnamese high commands hoped to resolve several pressing issues. A quick victory in Laos would bolster the morale <b>and</b> <b>confidence</b> of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN), {{which was already}} high {{in the wake of}} the successful Cambodian Campaign of 1970. It would also serve as proof positive that South Vietnamese forces could defend their nation in the face of the continuing withdrawal of U.S. ground combat forces from the theater. The operation would be, therefore, a test of that policy and ARVN's capability to operate effectively by itself.|$|E

At the Canucks' 2008 SuperSkills event, he beat the team's reigning hardest shooter, Sami Salo, with a 99.3 mile-per-hour shot and has gone on to win the competition in 2009 and 2010, as well. He is also known for his poise <b>and</b> <b>confidence</b> with the puck, allowing him to make strong first passes out of the defensive zone to forwards. Many within the Canucks organization, such as Assistant Coach Rick Bowness, have asserted this as a reflection of his calm off-ice demeanor.|$|E

Although destroying the enemy navy {{would result in a}} clear strategic advantage for both sides, attempting this risked the loss of their own navy. The actions of the two sides thus reflect more upon their morale <b>and</b> <b>confidence</b> than on any strategic considerations. The Persians, seeing little to gain in battle, demoralised and riven with dissent, thus sought to avoid a naval battle. Conversely, the Allies, who had initially been as nervous of a battle as the Persians, sought to press home their morale advantage once they were informed {{of the state of the}} Persian fleet.|$|E
