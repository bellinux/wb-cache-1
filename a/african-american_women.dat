5|$|Although the USCG officially {{opened its}} doors to <b>African-American</b> <b>women</b> in October 1944, {{it was not until}} March 1945 that the first five women were {{accepted}}; they were the only <b>African-American</b> <b>women</b> to serve in the SPARS. Although the Women's Army Corps (WAC) accepted <b>African-American</b> <b>women</b> from its inception, the U.S. Navy's Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service (WAVES) only began accepting <b>African-American</b> <b>women</b> in October 1944, with fewer than 100 of them serving in the WAVES, and the U.S. Marine Corps Women's Reserve never opened its ranks to <b>African-American</b> <b>women.</b> The five <b>African-American</b> <b>women</b> who served in the SPARS were: Olivia Hooker, D. Winifred Byrd, Julia Mosley, Yvonne Cumberbatch, and Aileen Cooke.|$|E

5|$|The {{sorority}} {{was founded}} on January 15, 1908, at the historically black Howard University in Washington, D.C., {{by a group of}} sixteen students led by Ethel Hedgeman Lyle. Forming a sorority broke barriers for <b>African-American</b> <b>women</b> in areas where they had little power or authority, {{due to a lack of}} opportunities for minorities and women in the early 20th century. Alpha Kappa Alpha was incorporated on January 29, 1913.|$|E

5|$|Women's music (or womyn's {{music or}} wimmin's music) {{is the music}} by women, for women, and about women.

5|$|In 1940, Thurman {{founded the}} Aframerican Women’s Journal, the first {{publishing}} vehicle of the National Council of Negro Women (NCNW), which she edited from 1940 until 1944. In 1941, an archive committee {{was formed to}} design a plan for collecting works about the achievements of <b>African-American</b> <b>women.</b> Though their plans focused primarily on written records and professional accomplishment and would thus reflect middle-class life, the committee initiated work on collecting historical records of black women. In 1944, Thurman became the committee's chair and her mother donated $1,000 toward creating the National Council of Negro Women's National Library, Archives, and Museum. On June 30, 1946, they held an archive drive, printing notices in newsletters and asking ministers, organizations, librarians and others to help them acquire photographs, books and mementos.

5|$|Thurman {{played an}} active role in {{establishing}} international student organizations to help prevent foreign students feeling isolated while studying abroad.

She wrote books and newspaper articles to preserve black heritage, and initiated the publishing efforts of the National Council of Negro Women (NCNW) by founding the Aframerican Women’s Journal. In addition to writing the second ever history of black Californians, in 1958 Thurman published a cookbook laced with historical information about black professional women at a time when African Americans had few civil rights. Recognizing that there was little academic interest in black women's history at the time, Thurman used the marketing ploy of food to report on the lives of black women who were not domestics. She participated in international peace and feminist conferences, and in 1945 attended the San Francisco Conference for the founding of the United Nations as part of an unofficial delegation. Thurman also established museums such as the Museum of Afro-American History in Boston in 1963.|$|E
