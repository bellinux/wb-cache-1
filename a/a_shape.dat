5|$|An {{ordinary}} sphere in three-dimensional space — the surface, not {{the solid}} ball — {{is just one}} example of what a sphere means in topology. Geometry defines a sphere rigidly, as <b>a</b> <b>shape.</b> Here are some alternatives.|$|E
5|$|Any {{curve of}} {{constant}} width can form a rotor within a square, <b>a</b> <b>shape</b> that can perform a complete rotation while staying within the square and {{at all times}} touching all four sides of the square. However, the Reuleaux triangle is the rotor with the minimum possible area. As it rotates, its axis does not stay fixed at a single point, but instead follows a curve formed by the pieces of four ellipses. Because of its 120° angles, the rotating Reuleaux triangle cannot reach some points near the sharper angles at the square's vertices, but rather covers <b>a</b> <b>shape</b> with slightly rounded corners, also formed by elliptical arcs.|$|E

5|$|Characters can equip weapons, armor, rings, and amulets, {{which provide}} attack or defense points, or give bonuses {{to some other}} statistic. There are also usable items such as potions to restore a character's health or mana. Weapons, armor, and other items are found by killing enemies, {{breaking}} containers, or by purchase from vendors. Each character has an inventory, represented as a fixed grid, with each item depicted by <b>a</b> <b>shape</b> taking up spaces on the grid. One character type, the mule, cannot use weapons or magic, but has a much larger inventory.|$|E
5|$|Copper {{is one of}} the few metals {{that occur}} in nature in {{directly}} usable metallic form (native metals) as opposed to needing extraction from an ore. This led to very early human use, from c. 8000 BC. It was the first metal to be smelted from its ore, c. 5000 BC, the first metal to be cast into <b>a</b> <b>shape</b> in a mold, c. 4000 BC and the first metal to be purposefully alloyed with another metal, tin, to create bronze, c. 3500 BC.|$|E
5|$|During {{their time}} in Africa, Krapf and Rebmann worked {{their way into the}} {{interior}} of the continent. They traveled to several areas in the regions of Central and Eastern Africa, including to what is now known as the African Great Lakes. The finding of one especially large lake (Uniamési) is depicted in a map known as the 'Slug' map. It was known by this name because the layout of the water body suggested <b>a</b> <b>shape</b> similar to that of a slug.|$|E

5|$|Findings {{from the}} Dawn {{spacecraft}} have {{found evidence that}} the troughs that wrap around Vesta could be graben formed by impact-induced faulting (see Troughs section above), meaning that Vesta has more complex geology than other asteroids. Vesta could have been classified as a dwarf planet if it had retained a spherical shape, and it has other qualities {{that lead to the}} thought it could be a protoplanet. The only thing that knocked it out of the category of a dwarf planet was the formation of two large impact basins at its southern pole. At the time of these impacts Vesta was not warm and plastic enough to return to <b>a</b> <b>shape</b> in hydrostatic equilibrium.|$|E
5|$|Gimsa et al. (2015) {{suggest that}} the dorsal sail of Spinosaurus was {{homologous}} to the dorsal fins of sailfish and served a hydrodynamic purpose. Gimsa and others point out that more basal, long-legged spinosaurids have otherwise round or crescent-shaped dorsal sails, whereas in Spinosaurus, the dorsal neural spines form <b>a</b> <b>shape</b> that is roughly rectangular and similar in shape to the dorsal fins of sailfish. They therefore argue that Spinosaurus used its dorsal neural sail {{in the same manner}} as sailfish, and that it also employed its long narrow tail to stun prey like a modern thresher shark.|$|E
5|$|Hummingbirds are {{significant}} pollinators of cacti. Species showing the typical hummingbird-pollination syndrome have flowers with colors towards the red {{end of the}} spectrum, anthers and stamens that protrude from the flower, and <b>a</b> <b>shape</b> that is not radially symmetrical, with a lower lip that bends downwards; they produce large amounts of nectar with a relatively low sugar content. Schlumbergera species, such as S. truncata, have flowers that correspond closely to this syndrome. Other hummingbird-pollinated genera include Cleistocactus and Disocactus.|$|E

50|$|Shaped charge, bazooka: For <b>a</b> <b>shaped</b> charge (anti-tank) {{to pierce}} through steel plates, it is {{essential}} that the explosion generates a long heavy metal jet (in <b>a</b> <b>shaped</b> charge for anti-tank use, the explosion generates a high speed metal jet from the cone shaped metal lining). This jet may then be viewed as the impactor of Newton's approximation.|$|R
5|$|In 16th century England, Henry VIII began {{building}} Device Forts between 1539 and 1540 as artillery fortresses {{to counter the}} threat of invasion from France and Spain. They were built by the state at strategic points for the first powerful cannon batteries, such as Deal Castle, which was perfectly symmetrical, with a low, circular keep at its centre. Over 200 cannon and gun ports were set within the walls, and the fort was essentially a firing platform, with <b>a</b> <b>shape</b> that allowed many lines of fire; its low curved bastions were designed to deflect cannonballs.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these universal functions, the plasma membrane has a more specific role in multicellular organisms. Glycoproteins on the membrane assist the cell in recognizing other cells, in order to exchange metabolites and form tissues. Other proteins on the plasma membrane allow attachment to the cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix; a function that maintains cell shape and fixes the location of membrane proteins. Enzymes that catalyze reactions are also found on the plasma membrane. Receptor proteins on the membrane have <b>a</b> <b>shape</b> that matches with a chemical messenger, resulting in various cellular responses.|$|E
5|$|Mathematicians {{use some}} {{technical}} terms when discussing tilings. An edge is the intersection between two bordering tiles; {{it is often}} a straight line. A vertex {{is the point of}} intersection of three or more bordering tiles. Using these terms, an isogonal or vertex-transitive tiling is a tiling where every vertex point is identical; that is, the arrangement of polygons about each vertex is the same. The fundamental region is <b>a</b> <b>shape</b> such as a rectangle that is repeated to form the tessellation. For example, a regular tessellation of the plane with squares has a meeting of four squares at every vertex.|$|E
50|$|The RPG has {{a design}} {{comparable}} to <b>a</b> <b>shaped</b> charge explosive. <b>A</b> <b>shaped</b> charge is <b>an</b> explosive charge <b>shaped</b> {{to focus the}} effect of the explosive's energy. Various types are used to penetrate tank armour. A typical modern lined shaped charge can penetrate steel armor to a depth of seven or more times the diameter of the charge (charge diameters, CD), though greater depths of 10 CD and above have been achieved.|$|R
30|$|<b>A</b> <b>shaped</b> {{reflector}} antenna {{is designed}} to change the original antenna phase distribution and compensate the phase distortion caused by dielectric radomes [11]. <b>A</b> <b>shaped</b> radome (nonuniform thickness) can also get a minimal phase difference and reduce the pattern distortion [12]. The degradation caused by glass fiber material error can be compensated [13] by grinding the geometrical thickness based on phase equivalent [14].|$|R

5|$|Muskrats {{are covered}} with short, thick fur, which is medium to dark brown or black in color, with the belly a bit lighter (countershaded); as the age increases, it turns a partly gray in color. The fur has two layers, which helps {{protect them from the}} cold water. They have long tails covered with scales rather than hair, and to aid them in swimming, are {{slightly}} flattened vertically, which is <b>a</b> <b>shape</b> that is unique to them. When they walk on land, their tails drag on the ground, which makes their tracks easy to recognize.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the moons}} {{discovered}} by the Voyager2 imaging team, only Puck was discovered early enough that the probe could be programmed to image it in some detail. Images showed that Puck has <b>a</b> <b>shape</b> of a slightly prolate spheroid (ratio between axes is 0.97±0.04). Its surface is heavily cratered and is grey in color. There are three named craters {{on the surface of}} Puck, the largest being about 45km in diameter. Observations with the Hubble Space Telescope and large terrestrial telescopes found water-ice absorption features in the spectrum of Puck.|$|E
5|$|The basidia (spore-bearing cells) measure 24–33 by 6.6–8.8μm, {{and may be}} {{attached}} to anywhere from one to four spores, although four-spored basidia are most common. They are hyaline to sometimes somewhat yellowish, club-shaped or roughly cylindrical, and some have a slight constriction around the middle. The cheilocystidia (cystidia {{on the edge of}} a gill) are abundant, forming a sterile band on the gill edge. They are hyaline, fusoid-ampullaceous (with <b>a</b> <b>shape</b> ranging from a spindle to a swollen bottle), with dimensions of 20–45 by 5–8.2μm, and have a filamentous neck measuring 6–11 by 1.6–2.5μm. The pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) are scattered, similar to the cheilocystidia in form and size, hyaline, and some have bifurcated or branched necks.|$|E

5|$|The {{dogs have}} blue, liver or sandy colouration, {{all three of}} which may have tan points. Bedlingtons carry {{what is known as}} the greying gene, a {{dominant}} trait carried on the G locus. This gene causes puppies born with black or dark brown fur to lighten to grey or liver with age. The fur of the Bedlington creates <b>a</b> <b>shape</b> on the top of the dog's head known as a topknot. Although most modern breed standards call for the dog's topknot to be lighter than its body, when the breed was first being formed there was at least one prominent breeder, Mr. Pickett, who believed that the topknot should be darker, not lighter.|$|E
5|$|The {{fruit body}} of the North American species Chalciporus piperatoides are similar, but can be {{distinguished}} by its flesh and pores staining blue after cutting or bruising. It has a less peppery taste. Another mild-tasting relative, C.rubinellus, has brighter colours than C.piperatus, including completely red tubes. One European species, C.rubinus, has <b>a</b> <b>shape</b> similar to C.piperatus, but has red pores and a stem covered in red dots.|$|E
5|$|The maximum spacing {{estimator}} is {{a consistent}} estimator {{in that it}} converges in probability to the true value of the parameter, θ0, as the sample size increases to infinity. The consistency of maximum spacing estimation holds under much more general conditions than for maximum likelihood estimators. In particular, {{in cases where the}} underlying distribution is J-shaped, maximum likelihood will fail where MSE succeeds. An example of a J-shaped density is the Weibull distribution, specifically a shifted Weibull, with <b>a</b> <b>shape</b> parameter less than 1. The density will tend to infinity as x approaches the location parameter rendering estimates of the other parameters inconsistent.|$|E

40|$|Eliminating the {{corporate}} feed network in shaped contour beam antennas {{will reduce the}} expense, weight, and RF loss of the antenna system. One way of producing <b>a</b> <b>shaped</b> contour beam without using a feed network is to use <b>a</b> single <b>shaped</b> reflector with <b>a</b> single feed element. For a prescribed contour beam and feed, an optimization method for designing the reflector <b>shape</b> is given. <b>As</b> a design example, <b>a</b> <b>shaped</b> reflector is designed to produce a continental U. S. coverage (CONUS) beam. The RF performance of the shaped reflector is then verified by physical optics...|$|R
