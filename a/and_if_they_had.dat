5|$|Throughout its 66 {{years of}} operating, the orphanage took in {{approximately}} 2,500 individuals. Approximately four per cent of all boys who stayed there were orphans, whereas the remainder had living parents; {{most of them}} either came from poor or troubled families who were unable to afford to look after them. The orphanage also took in child migrants. Only boys from the ages of 5 to 16 were taken care there. However, the Sisters of Mercy sometimes took in families in need or individuals who were 3 years old or younger. One of the Sisters of Mercy's aims was to keep brothers together if possible, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> sisters, they would be housed at the St. Joseph's Orphanage. Although the building could only house up to 100 boys, the capacity rose to between 140 and 250 boys during the Second World War, far above the suitable capacity of the building.|$|E

25|$|Eugene Nagel {{became aware}} of Pantridge's work in 1967. He {{believed}} that the physician-staffed model of prehospital care {{was not going to}} work for the United States in general or for Miami in particular. Physicians were too expensive to sit around fire stations waiting for calls, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> to be picked up in hospitals, it would take too long to arrive at the scene. When Nagel or his colleague James Hirschman, rode on the ambulance themselves they could, of course, defibrillate and provide medications, but they could not be present on all shifts. Nagel became convinced {{it was time to move}} away from a program using physicians to one staffed by paramedics.|$|E

25|$|Most labyrinthodonts {{had special}} sense organs in the skin, forming a lateral line organ for {{perception}} of water flow and pressure, like {{those found in}} fish {{and a number of}} modern amphibians. This would enable them to pick up the vibration of their prey and other waterborne sounds while hunting in murky, weed filled waters. Early labyrinthodont groups had massive stapes, likely primarily anchoring the brain case to the skull roof. It is a question of some doubt whether early terrestrial labyrinthodonts had the stapes connected to a tympanum covering their otic notch, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> an aerial sense of hearing at all. The tympanum in anurans and amniotes appear to have evolved separately, indicating most, if not all, Labyrinthodonts were unable to pick up airborne sound.|$|E

They also said that treatment depended on their skin colour, ethnicity <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> a Muslim-sounding name. One activist said they were not allowed to contact lawyers and were videotaped throughout. According to Henning Mankell, Israeli authorities confiscated their money, credit cards, mobile phones, laptops, cameras, and personal belongings including clothes. They were only allowed to keep papers. Several passengers had charges made to their confiscated debit cards and cell phones. Israel pledged to investigate the issue. An IDF officer and three soldiers were subsequently arrested by Israeli military police and charged with stealing laptops and mobile phones from passengers. Turkish journalist Adem Özköse, who was aboard the Marmara, said Israel's prison was like a 5-star hotel compared to Syria's jails.|$|E

500|$|On March 16, 2017, Bevin signed SB 17 into law, {{intended}} to [...] "protect religious expression in public schools" [...] by barring school districts from regulating student organizations in ways such as {{requiring them to}} accept LGBT people as members. Other bills Bevin signed into law included a [...] "Blue Lives Matter" [...] bill making it a hate crime to attack a police officer, placing Planned Parenthood at the least priority for funding, and removing restrictions on local governments on authorizing allowing local government to authorize charter schools. On March 27, 2017, Bevin vetoed {{a bill that would}} have allowed a judge to order mentally disabled people to [...] undergo outpatient treatment if they could not recognize their condition <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> a history of hospitalization, due to his concerns over its effects of individual liberty.

500|$|On March 3, {{the jurors}} {{listened to the}} voice {{recordings}} having been provided with a transcript. The transcript had [...] "inaudible" [...] written {{on some of the}} excerpts because the conversations during Garza's meeting with Martínez, and during Martínez' meeting with Cisneros, were unclear. On the first recording, Garza met with Martínez under the pretext that the gunmen were requesting more money, and that the police instructed Garza to tell Martínez that Cisneros needed to pay an extra US$500. On the recordings, Martínez told Garza that she had no money and that Cisneros was out of town. Garza then told Martínez that the assassins were difficult to contact and he worried that if the payments were not made, they could get angry. Martínez then asked Garza what the assassins did with the car they used, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> worn gloves when they shot Fischer. After two more recordings between the pair, the Brownsville police arrested Martínez and had her meet with Cisneros. Early in the recording made with Cisneros, though unclear in some parts, she was recorded handing over something to Martínez and saying [...] "five," [...] referring to the US$500 the police confiscated from her during the arrest. She was also recorded asking Martínez if there was any proof that she had been involved in the murder.|$|E

2500|$|At {{first the}} New Deal created {{programs}} primarily for men. It {{was assumed that}} the husband was the [...] "breadwinner" [...] (the provider) <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> jobs, whole families would benefit. It was the social norm for women to give up jobs when they married; in many states there were laws that prevented both husband and wife holding regular jobs with the government. So too in the relief world, it was rare for both husband and wife to have a relief job on FERA or the WPA. This prevailing social norm of the breadwinner failed {{to take into account}} the numerous households headed by women, but it soon became clear that the government needed to help women as well.|$|E
2500|$|Ahead of the 2005 general election, {{there was}} {{speculation}} {{that a single}} unionist candidate could retake the seat. The UUP and DUP, however, ran opposing candidates and in the event Gildernew held her seat. She kept the seat at the 2010 general election by four votes over the Unionist candidate, Rodney Connor. Following the election, Connor lodged an election petition challenging the result, based on a dispute about differences {{in the number of}} ballot papers recorded at polling stations and those subsequently recorded at the count centre. The petition was rejected after it was found that only three extra votes remained unnaccounted for. The judge ruled that [...] "even if those votes were introduced in breach of the rules <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> all been counted in favour of the first respondent their exclusion would still have given the first respondent (Ms Gildernew) a majority of one vote and the result would not have been affected." ...|$|E
2500|$|We {{believe them}} deluded fanatics, or weak and {{designing}} knaves, {{and that they}} and their pretensions would soon pass away; but in this we were deceived. The arts of a few designing leaders amongst them have less far succeeded in holding to them together as a society; and since {{the arrival of the}} first of them, they have been daily increasing numbers; <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> been respectable citizens in society and thus deluded it would have been entitled to our pity rather than to our contempt and hatred; but from their parents, from their manners, and from their conduct since their coming among us, we have every reason to fear that, with but very few exceptions, they were of the very drags of that society from which they came, lazy, idle, and vicious. This we can see it is not idle assertion, they fact susceptible of proof, or with these few exceptions above-named, they brought into our country little or no property with them and left less behind them, and we infer that those only yoked themselves to the [...] "Mormon" [...] car who had nothing earthly or heavenly to lose by the change; and we fear that of some of the leaders amongst them, had paid to forfeit due to crime, instead of being chosen ambassadors of the Most High, they would have been inmates of solitary cells. But their conduct here stands their characters in their true colors. More than a year since, it was ascertained that they had been tampering with our slaves, and endeavoring to sow dissensions and raise seditions amongst them. Of this their [...] "Mormon" [...] leaders were informed, and they said they would deal with any of their members who should again in like case offend. But how spacious are appearances. In a late number of the Star, published in Independence by the leaders of the sect, there is an article inviting free Negroes and mulattoes from other states to become [...] "Mormons," [...] and remove and settle among us. This exhibits them in still more odious colors. It manifests a desire on the part of their society, to inflict on our society an injury that they know would be to us entirely insupportable, and one of the surest means of driving us from the country; for it would require none of the supernatural gifts that they pretend to, to see that the introduction of such a caste among us would corrupt our blacks, and instigate them to bloodshed.|$|E
