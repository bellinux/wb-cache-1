5|$|A {{number of}} saints and {{historical}} figures have followed and presented specific approaches to Christian meditation. Both Eastern and Western Christian teachings {{have emphasized the}} use of meditation as <b>an</b> <b>element</b> <b>in</b> increasing one's knowledge of Christ. The Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola use meditative mental imagery, {{with the goal of}} knowing Christ more intimately and loving him more ardently. In The Way of Perfection, St. Theresa of Avila taught her nuns how to try to get to know Christ by using meditation and mental prayer. Hesychastic prayer and meditation continues {{to be used in the}} Eastern Orthodox tradition as a spiritual practice that facilitates the knowing of Christ.|$|E
5|$|Christian {{meditation}} aims {{to heighten}} the personal relationship {{based on the}} love of God that marks Christian communion. Both in Eastern and Western Christianity meditation is the middle level in a broad three-stage characterization of prayer: it involves more reflection than first level vocal prayer, but is more structured than the multiple layers of contemplative prayer. Teachings in both the Eastern and Western Christian churches have emphasized the use of Christian meditation as <b>an</b> <b>element</b> <b>in</b> increasing one's knowledge of Christ.|$|E
5|$|Special {{consideration}} {{was given}} during filming {{to allow for}} integration of the planned special effects. Television monitors standing in for computer displays were specially calibrated so that their refresh rate {{did not result in}} banding on film. Due to a loss of resolution and quality resulting from rephotographing <b>an</b> <b>element</b> <b>in</b> an optical printer, live action sequences for effects were shot in 65mm or VistaVision formats to compensate. When the larger prints were reduced through an anamorphic lens on the printer, the result was a Panavision composite.|$|E

5|$|Sulfur {{and carbon}} were known in antiquity. The {{earliest}} known use of charcoal dates to around 3750 BCE. The Egyptians and Sumerians employed {{it for the}} reduction of copper, zinc, and tin ores {{in the manufacture of}} bronze. Diamonds were probably known from as early as 2500 BCE. The first true chemical analyses were made in the 18th century; Lavoisier recognized carbon as <b>an</b> <b>element</b> <b>in</b> 1789. Sulfur usage dates from before 2500 BCE; it was recognized as an element by Antoine Lavoisier in 1777.|$|E
5|$|A {{stochastic}} or {{random process}} {{can be defined as}} a collection of random variables that is indexed by some mathematical set, meaning that each random variable of the stochastic process is uniquely associated with <b>an</b> <b>element</b> <b>in</b> the set. The set used to index the random variables is called the index set. Historically, the index set was some subset of the real line, such as the natural numbers, giving the index set the interpretation of time. Each random variable in the collection takes values from the same mathematical space known as the state space. This state space can be, for example, the integers, the real line or -dimensional Euclidean space. An increment is the amount that a stochastic process changes between two index values, often interpreted as two points in time. A stochastic process can have many outcomes, due to its randomness, and a single outcome of a stochastic process is called, among other names, a sample function or realization.|$|E
5|$|Boron was not {{recognized}} as an element until it was isolated by Sir Humphry Davy and by Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac and Louis Jacques Thénard. In 1808 Davy observed that electric current sent through a solution of borates produced a brown precipitate {{on one of the}} electrodes. In his subsequent experiments, he used potassium to reduce boric acid instead of electrolysis. He produced enough boron to confirm a new element and named the element boracium. Gay-Lussac and Thénard used iron to reduce boric acid at high temperatures. By oxidizing boron with air, they showed that boric acid is an oxidation product of boron. Jöns Jakob Berzelius identified boron as <b>an</b> <b>element</b> <b>in</b> 1824. Pure boron was arguably first produced by the American chemist Ezekiel Weintraub in 1909.|$|E
50|$|A {{function}} γ {{is called}} a concretization function if it maps <b>an</b> <b>element</b> x&prime; <b>in</b> the abstract set L&prime; to <b>an</b> <b>element</b> γ(x&prime;) <b>in</b> the concrete set L. That is, <b>element</b> γ(x&prime;) <b>in</b> L is a concretization of x&prime; in L&prime;.|$|R

5|$|It {{was between}} these two groups that, after Elizabeth's death in 1603, a new, more savage episode of the Reformation {{was in the process}} of gestation. During the reigns of the Stuart kings, James I and Charles I, the battle lines were to become more defined, leading {{ultimately}} to the English Civil War, the first on English soil to engulf parts of the civilian population. The war was only partly about religion, but the abolition of prayer book and episcopacy by a Puritan Parliament was <b>an</b> <b>element</b> <b>in</b> the causes of the conflict. As historian MacCulloch has noted, the legacy of these tumultuous events can be recognised, throughout the Commonwealth (1649–60) and the Restoration that followed it, and beyond. This third party was to become the core of the restored Church of England, but at the price for further division.|$|E
5|$|Plutonium is <b>an</b> <b>element</b> <b>in</b> {{which the}} 5f {{electrons}} are the transition border between delocalized and localized; {{it is therefore}} {{considered one of the}} most complex elements. The anomalous behavior of plutonium is caused by its electronic structure. The energy difference between the 6d and 5f subshells is very low. The size of the 5f shell is just enough to allow the electrons to form bonds within the lattice, on the very boundary between localized and bonding behavior. The proximity of energy levels leads to multiple low-energy electron configurations with near equal energy levels. This leads to competing 5fn7s2 and 5fn−16d17s2 configurations, which causes the complexity of its chemical behavior. The highly directional nature of 5f orbitals is responsible for directional covalent bonds in molecules and complexes of plutonium.|$|E
5|$|The first {{evidence}} of helium was observed on August 18, 1868, as {{a bright yellow}} line with a wavelength of 587.49 nanometers in the spectrum of the chromosphere of the Sun. The line was detected by French astronomer Jules Janssen during a total solar eclipse in Guntur, India. This line was initially assumed to be sodium. On October 20 of the same year, English astronomer Norman Lockyer observed a yellow line in the solar spectrum, which he named the D3 Fraunhofer line because it was near the known D1 and D2 lines of sodium. He concluded that it was caused by <b>an</b> <b>element</b> <b>in</b> the Sun unknown on Earth. Lockyer and English chemist Edward Frankland named the element with the Greek word for the Sun, ἥλιος (helios).|$|E
