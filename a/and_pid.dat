We assessed how trends in chlamydia positivity and gonorrhea incidence corresponded to trends in <b>PID</b> <b>and</b> ectopic pregnancy incidence in Washington State between 1988 and 2010 when large-scale screening programs for these infections were in place. We used various sources of surveillance data to capture trends in each condition over time. Without direct information on outpatient-treated cases of <b>PID</b> <b>and</b> ectopic pregnancy in Washington State, we estimated these cases based on outpatient data from surrogate or sentinel populations. Chlamydia positivity and gonorrhea incidence significantly declined from 1988 to 1997 before gradually increasing.
