40|$|SummaryBackgroundThis {{systematic}} review evaluated the incidence, etiology, {{and use of}} resources in bacterial, non-tuberculosis community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in immune-competent children aged < 5 years. MethodsSystematic searches (1980 – 2008) were performed using MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, LILACS, generic, and academic Internet searches. Regional health ministries, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), regional proceedings, doctoral theses, and the reference lists of included studies were also searched, and experts were consulted. <b>Arcsine</b> <b>transformations</b> and the DerSimonian–Laird random-effects model were used for proportion meta-analyses. ResultsThe search yielded 1220 references; 60 {{were included in the}} meta-analysis, giving a total 23 854 CAP episodes with an incidence of 919 / 100 000 child-years in children aged < 5 years. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most frequently isolated agent (11. 08 %; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 7. 63 − 15. 08), and pneumococcal serotype 14 was most prevalent (33. 00 %; 95 % CI 25. 95 − 40. 45). Other common agents were Haemophilus influenzae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Health economics data on CAP in the region were scarce. About one-fourth of CAP patients required hospitalization (median length of stay 11 days, range 5 − 13. 5 days). ConclusionsThe burden of CAP was substantial, with S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and M. pneumoniae being the most common pathogens identified. High quality primary studies on disease incidence, use of health resources, and standardized data collection on disease burden and circulating strains are essential to provide baseline data for the future evaluation of vaccine impact...|$|R

40|$|When {{binary data}} exhibit the greater {{variation}} than expected, the statistical methods have {{to account for}} extra-binomial variation. Possible explanations for extra-binomial variation include intra-cluster dependence or the variability of binomial probabilities. Both of these reasons lead to overdispersion of binomial counts and the resulting heterogeneity in their meta-analysis. Variance stabilizing or normalizing transformations are often applied to binomial counts to enable the use of standard methods based on normality. In meta-analysis, this is routinely done for the inference on overall effect measure. However, these transformations might result in biases {{in the presence of}} overdispersion. We study biases arising in the result of transformations of binary variables in the random or mixed effects models. We demonstrate considerable biases arising from standard log-odds and <b>arcsine</b> <b>transformations</b> both for single studies and in meta-analysis. We also explore possibilities of bias correction. In meta-analysis, the heterogeneity of the log odds ratios across the studies is usually incorporated by standard (additive) random effects model (REM). An alternative, multiplicative random effects model is based on the concept of an overdispersion. The multiplicative factor in this overdispersed random effects model can be interpreted as an intra-class correlation parameter. This model arises when one or both binomial distributions in the 2 by 2 tables are changed to betabinomial distributions. The Mantel-Haenzsel and inverse-variance approaches are extended to this setting. The estimation of the random effect parameter is based on profiling the modified Breslow-Day test and improving the approximation for distribution of Q statistic in Mandel-Paule method. The biases and coverages from new methods are compared to standard methods through simulation studies. The misspecification of the REM in respect to the mechanism of its generation is an important issue which is also discussed in this thesis...|$|R

40|$|ObjectivesThrombolysis is {{effective}} in improving clinical outcome {{in the treatment of}} acute ischaemic stroke. However, thrombolysis results in low recanalisation rates, particularly in the event of carotid occlusion. Carotid intervention is indicated in stroke resulting from significant carotid atherosclerosis, but intervention soon after thrombolysis may be associated with increased risks. This study aims to assess the safety of carotid intervention post-thrombolysis for acute ischaemic stroke. DesignSystematic review. Materials and methodsMEDLINE and EMBASE were searched on 29 May 2014. Inclusion criteria were (i) intra-arterial or intravenous thrombolysis for acute ischaemic stroke; (ii) carotid intervention within 14 days of thrombolysis; and (iii) derivable primary outcome. The primary outcome was 30 -day stroke or death. A meta-analysis of incidence was completed for the 30 -day stroke or death rates using Freeman–Tukey <b>arcsine</b> <b>transformations</b> and assuming random effects. Point estimates with confidence intervals (CIs) were generated and heterogeneity was assessed. The strength of recommendations and quality of underlying evidence were assessed using the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) grading system. ResultsNine included publications recorded 114 carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and four angioplasty interventions. The point estimate of 30 -day stroke or death for CEA was 4. 93 % (95 % CI 1. 83 – 9. 44), representing four of 114. The strength of recommendation and quality of underlying evidence for CEA as per the ACCP grading system was determined as 1 C. There were no cases of stroke or death in patients undergoing angioplasty post-thrombolysis (0 / 4). ConclusionsEarly CEA post-thrombolysis appears safe, with stroke or death rates {{similar to that of the}} operation without thrombolysis. However, the wide CI obtained highlights the uncertainty of this result. Further, we emphasise that this recommendation is supported by low-quality evidence.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to determine the effect of selection for improved residual feed intake on behavior, activity, and lesion scores in gilts in their home pen. A total of 192 gilts were used, 96 from a line that had been selected for decreased residual feed intake over 5 generations (LRFI) and 96 from a randomly bred control line. Gilts were housed in 12 pens (16 gilts/pen; 0. 82 m 2 /gilt) containing 8 gilts from each line in a conventional grow-finish unit. Twelve hours of video footage were collected on the day of placement and then every 4 wk for 3 more observational periods. Video was scored using a 10 -min instantaneous scan sampling technique for 4 postures (standing, lying, sitting, and locomotion) and 1 behavior (at drinker). Categories of active (standing, locomotion, and at drinker) and inactive (sitting and lying) were also created. Lesion scores were collected 24 h after behavior collection had begun. The body of a gilt was divided into 4 regions, with each region receiving a score of 0 (0 lesions) to 3 (5 + lesions). All statistical analyses used Proc Mixed of SAS. Data were analyzed separately for the day of placement and the subsequent 3 rounds. General activity was summarized on a percentage basis by each posture and behavior and subjected to an <b>arcsine</b> square root <b>transformation</b> to normalize data and stabilize variance. Analysis was performed on each behavior and posture. Lesion scores for each region of the body were analyzed as repeated measures. There were no differences (P 3 ̆e 0. 05) between genetic lines for all postures and the behavior at drinker on the day of placement. However, over subsequent rounds it was observed that LRFI gilts spent less (P = 0. 03) time standing, more time sitting (P = 0. 05), and were less active (P = 0. 03) overall. Gilts from the LRFI line had decreased (P 3 ̆c 0. 045) lesion scores on the day after placement. However, over subsequent rounds there were no (P 3 ̆e 0. 05) differences between the genetic lines. In conclusion, on the day of placement there were no postural, behavior, or general activity differences between genetic lines, but LRFI gilts had decreased lesion scores.

Our simulations confirm that these biases are linear in ρ, for small values of ρ, the intracluster correlation coefficient.
