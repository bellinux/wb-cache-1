In the silent film era, he was well {{received}} in such pictures as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1920), Sherlock Holmes (1922) <b>and</b> <b>The</b> <b>Sea</b> Beast (1926). During this period, he gained his nickname, the Great Profile.

5|$|All in all, the Soviet period saw a {{significant}} increase in population (799,000 in 1970 vs. 15,000 in 1913), although most of the population remained concentrated in the urban localities along the railroads <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> coast. Most of the sparsely populated territories outside the urbanized areas were used for deer herding. In 1920–1940, the town of Kirovsk and several work settlements were established on the peninsula.|$|E

5|$|Because {{its feet}} are located so far {{back on its}} body, the red-throated loon is quite clumsy walking on land, but it can use its feet to shove itself forward on its breast. Young use this method of {{covering}} ground when moving from their breeding pools to larger bodies of water, including rivers <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea.</b> It is the only species of loon able to take off directly from land. If frightened, it may submerge until only its head or bill shows above {{the surface of the}} water.|$|E

Very small increases in sightings have been confirmed off Shiretoko Peninsula, Abashiri, and Kushiro in Hokkaido, Tsushima, Sado Island, off Maiduru in the Sea of Japan since in late 2000s as whales in Sea of Okhotsk might have started recolonizing into former habitats (for coastal Sakhalin, as well). Whales possibly used to migrated into Seto Inland Sea.|$|E

5|$|The {{ecological}} footprint of Croatia's population and industry varies significantly between the country's regions since 50% {{of the population}} resides in 26.8% of the nation's territory, with a particularly high impact made {{by the city of}} Zagreb and Zagreb County areas—their combined area comprises 6.6% of Croatia's territory while encompassing 25% of the population. The {{ecological footprint}} is most notably from the increased development of settlements <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> coast leading to habitat fragmentation. Between 1998 and 2008, the greatest changes of land use pertained to artificially developed areas, but the scale of development is negligible compared to EU member states.|$|E
