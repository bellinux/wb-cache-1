Some of his characters are loosely referenced from the Bible, non-fiction books, and mythology, and he created a world with a war being waged between three major factions (angels, devils, and fallen angels) with Rias being a devil. In Volume 5 of the light novels, Ishibumi writes that he likes to pair the main characters: Rias and Akeno <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> sister duo, Asia and Xenovia are the church-related duo who become friends, Gasper and Koneko are the young first-years, and Issei and Yuto are the guys.|$|E

500|$|The caption to the {{published}} photograph {{referred to the}} group as solemn. It was true {{that many of the}} group had reservations at appearing in a mainstream media publication; Rothko especially. Yet none could have mistaken the consequences of Pollock's three-page spread in Life of August 8, 1949. Pollock's next show, opening November 21, 1949, at Betty Parsons Gallery, was an unmistakable triumph. Famously, Willem de Kooning was heard to say to Milton Resnick: [...] "Look around. These <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> shots. Jackson has finally broken the ice." [...] In the ensuing year, Betty Parsons sent Pollock checks totalling $6,508.23 on gross sales of over $10,000, at a time when more than two thirds of American families lived on less than $4,000 per year. Pollock seems to have been invited to sign the Studio 35 open letter, at least in part, because of his notoriety, almost entirely attributable to the Life article. In the end the sitting was an uncomfortable accommodation between the system of values under which the artists had laboured and their desire for career success.|$|E

At the end of this song, every bluesman gathered at the stage to perform medleys of blues standards. Jazz poet and directorate of Newport Langston Hughes spontaneously wrote a finishing song, the slow [...] "Goodbye Newport Blues", this time Spann with as singer, as Waters was too exhausted to perform.|$|E

2500|$|The English barn (also {{known as}} a three-bay barn, Connecticut barn, Yankee barn, thirty-by-forty and {{sometimes}} confusingly called a New England barn) was built from a very early date in the northeast United States. The defining characteristics <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>big,</b> swinging doors on the sidewall with strap hinges mounted on pintles and three or sometimes four bays. The doors being on the side walls creates the spatial arrangement of the bays being the main divisions of these barns. The English barns were built {{during the period of}} using scribe rule framing (the irregular timbers were laid out and scribed to fit together). The framing was raised in sidewall assemblies, made with hewn timbers, in northern New England frequently had common purlin roofs, and often framed with the English tying joint on flared (gunstock) posts although these are not defining characteristics.|$|E

2500|$|After Il pirata, Bellini {{remained}} in Milan {{with the hope}} of securing another commission. One came from Genoa via Bartolomeo Merelli on 13 January 1828 for a new opera for presentation on 7 April. However, without knowing which singers would be engaged, he was unwilling to commit at that time, but {{remained in}} hope of something definite from La Scala for the autumn. When no alternatives appeared, he accepted Genoa's offer in February, but it was then too late to write anything new. He immediately proposed a revival and re-working of Bianca e Gernando, this time with the original title Bianca e Fernando, there being no royal by the name of Fernando in the House of Savoy. Romani wrote to Florimo in Naples and told him that he had taken on the re-construction of the libretto, with the result that [...] "out of the whole of Bianca, the only pieces entirely unchanged <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> duet and the romanza; everything else is altered, and about half of it is new", Bellini then re-arranged the music to suit the singers' voices, now knowing that the Bianca was to be Adelaide Tosi and the Fernando to be Giovanni David.|$|E

[...] But he chose the remake [...] "I Was Made To Love Him" [...] as the best track of the album, complimenting the song highly, [...] "The rollicking, gender-flipping remake". [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic, who gave the album four out of five stars, called it [...] "easily ranks among her best" [...] and complimented the musical diversity [...] "Houston has never been quite so subtle before, nor has she ever shown this desire to branch out musically." [...] But he also wasn't positive for adult contemporary ballads of the album, stating [...] "In fact, the songs that feel the stiffest <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> production numbers; tellingly, they're the songs that are the most reminiscent of old-school Houston."

2500|$|San Francisco KPFA-FM host J.R. Valrey made a film {{entitled}} “Operation Small Axe,” {{which focused}} on the Grant shooting, {{as well as the}} Lovelle Mixon case, within the larger context of police brutality in the Bay Area. Valrey showed his movie around the country in 2010. The film was directed and produced by Adimu Madyun and won the 2010 Rise Up Award from The Patois International Rights Film Festival in New Orleans, but Valrey also stirred controversy. [...] "The headline for a cover story in the East Bay Express called Valrey an 'Agent Provocateur' – a term generally associated with police informants assigned to cause violence," [...] wrote Temple University associate professor Linn Washington, Jr. after a Philadelphia screening. [...] "That article referred to Valrey as an 'advocacy journalist' who did things 'no mainstream journalist would do,' like speaking at an anti-police brutality rally. 'They tried to get the community to turn against me but I have strong support in the community,' said Valrey, who [...] serves [...] an editor at the San Francisco Bay View, a black owned online newspaper," [...] Washington continued. While in Washington, DC for a screening, Valrey was accompanied by Malcolm Shabazz, grandson of Malcolm X. Shabazz spoke of [...] "his life since being released from prison for the arson of his grandmother’s house" [...] in a joint appearance. A blogpost which reported on the screening connected the title of the film to Bob Marley's lyric [...] "So if you <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> tree, then we are the small axe."

6000|$|The {{world as}} Coote {{presented}} {{it was in}} part an endorsement, in part an amplification and in part a rectification {{of the world of}} Kipps, the world that derived from the old couple in New Romney and had been developed in the Emporium; the world, in fact, of common British life.

Within the sphere of gentlemen there are distinctions of rank indeed, but none of class; there <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> People and the modest, refined, gentlemanly little people like Coote, who may even dabble in the professions and counterless trades; there are lords and magnificences, and there are gentle folk who have to manage, but they can all call on one another, they preserve a general equality of deportment throughout, they constitute that great state within the state, Society, or at any rate they make believe they do.|$|E
60|$|MRS. CHEVELEY. My dear Sir Robert, what then? You are ruined, that is all! Remember {{to what a}} {{point your}} Puritanism in England has brought you. In old days nobody pretended {{to be a bit}} better than his {{neighbour}}s. In fact, to be a bit better than one’s neighbour was considered excessively vulgar and middle-class. Nowadays, with our modern mania for morality, every one has to pose as a paragon of purity, incorruptibility, and all the other seven deadly virtues—and what is the result? You all go over like ninepins—one after the other. Not a year passes in England without somebody disappearing. Scandals used to lend charm, or at least interest, to a man—now they crush him. And yours is a very nasty scandal. You couldn’t survive it. If it were known that as a young man, secretary to a great and important minister, you sold a Cabinet secret for a large sum of money, and that that was the origin of your wealth and career, you would be hounded out of public life, you would disappear completely. And after all, Sir Robert, why should you sacrifice your entire future rather than deal diplomatically with your enemy? For the moment I am your enemy. I admit it! And I am much stronger than you <b>are.</b> <b>The</b> <b>big</b> battalions are on my side. You have a splendid position, but it is your splendid position that makes you so vulnerable. You can’t defend it! And I am in attack. Of course I have not talked morality to you. You must admit in fairness that I have spared you that. Years ago you did a clever, unscrupulous thing; it turned out a great success. You owe to it your fortune and position. And now you have got to pay for it. Sooner or later we have all to pay for what we do. You have to pay now. Before I leave you to-night, you have got to promise me to suppress your report, and to speak in the House in favour of this scheme.|$|E
