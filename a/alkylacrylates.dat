40|$|International audienceA {{new type}} of {{biobased}} acrylates has been synthesized by a Baylis–Hillman reaction of <b>alkylacrylates</b> with α-D-glucosyloxymethyl-furfural (α-GMF), available in one step from isomaltulose. The reaction, performed in aqueous medium, was extended to other α,β-unsaturated substrates. The use of dimethylisosorbide as co-solvent was investigated...|$|E
40|$|A {{methodology}} {{has been}} developed for an efficient and selective lipase-catalyzed aza-Michael reaction of various amines (primary and secondary) {{with a series of}} acrylates and <b>alkylacrylates.</b> Reaction parameters were tuned, and under the optimal conditions it was found that Pseudomonas stutzeri lipase and Chromobacterium viscosum lipase showed the highest selectivity for the aza-Michael addition to substituted alkyl acrylates. For the first time also, some CLEAs were examined that showed a comparable or higher selectivity and yield than the free enzymes and other formulations...|$|E
30|$|In {{the present}} work, novel nine terpolymers were {{prepared}} via free radical chain addition polymerization, using (1 : 1 : 1) molar ratio of (jojoba: alkylacrylate: α-olefins) terpolymers. The <b>alkylacrylates</b> used were dodecylacrylate, tetradecylacrylate and hexadecylacrylate while the α-olefins used were dodecene, tetradecene and hexadecane. The prepared terpolymers {{were determined by}} FTIR, 1 H-NMR and GPC for determination of molecular weight. The thermal analyses of the prepared terpolymers were measured using thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis. The prepared additives were evaluated as lube oil viscosity index improvers and pour point depressants.|$|E

Effective surface diffusivities and adsorption equilibrium constants were determined with nonlinear regression methods by matching the experimental curves with the theoretical curves according to Babcock et al. ’s solution...|$|R
40|$|The {{most common}} method for {{applying}} a drug {{in to the}} eye is to formulate the drug {{in the form of}} an eye drop, but this method is not considered ideal for ocular delivery of drug because of poor bioavailability arising from precorneal loss processes, this loss of drug from the precorneal area is a net effect of drainage, tear secretion and noncorneal absorption. Following the above lead we tried to improve the ocular bioavailability by increasing the corneal contact time and the feasible way was to formulate a drug with mucoadhesive/viscosity imparting agents. The adhesive strength of various polymers on corneal surface was studied with the help of self modified Franz diffusion cell and freshly excised goat/bovine cornea. The polymers hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose sodium, Eudragit type E/RL/RS, Carbopol ETD 2020 and Carbopol 934 National Formulary were formulated with drug, ketorolac tromethamine. The adhesive strength of polymers on corneal surface and permeation characteristics of drug through cornea were investigated by using above said formulations. Eudragit type E/RL/RS did not show any improvement in mucoadhesion, but the formulations containing Carbopol ETD 2020 and Carbopol 934 national formulary showed good mucoadhesion on corneal surface in the concentration as low as 0. 75 %. The mucoadhesive strength was also evaluated using the combination of Carbopol acrylates/C 10 - 30 <b>alkylacrylate</b> with allylpentaerithrital and preservative benzalkonium chloride, which also resulted in good mucoadhesion with improved corneal permeation. Observations made in this study indicate the potentiality of the ophthalmic formulations containing mucoadhesive/viscosity imparting agents...|$|R
30|$|In this article, {{with the}} aim of modifying the {{performance}} properties of engine oil, nine terpolymers consisting of (jojoba: alkylacrylate: α-olefins) backbone were synthesized via free radical chain addition polymerization. The <b>alkylacrylates</b> used were (dodecylacrylate, tetradecylacrylate and hexadecylacrylate), while α-olefins used were (dodecene, tetradecene and hexadecane. The monomers’ ratio used for polymerization was (1 : 1 : 1) and they were characterized using FTIR, 1 H-NMR and GPC, for determination of weight average molecular weight. It was found that the viscosity index increases with increasing the alkyl chain length, molecular weight and concentration of used terpolymer. At the same time, the pour point of lube oil decreases (more negative) with decreasing the alkyl chain length of both alkylacrylate and α-olefin used. The thermal stability of the synthesized terpolymers was determined using TGA and DSC. The prepared terpolymers proved its efficiency as lubricating oil additives under severe conditions.|$|E
