5|$|Another {{possible}} {{mechanism for}} the formation of planetesimals is the streaming instability in which the drag felt by particles orbiting through gas creates a feedback effect causing the growth of local concentrations. These local concentration push back on the gas creating <b>a</b> <b>region</b> <b>where</b> the headwind felt by the particles is smaller. The concentration is thus able to orbit faster and undergoes less radial drift. Isolated particles join these concentrations as they are overtaken or as they drift inward causing it to grow in mass. Eventually these concentrations form massive filaments which fragment and undergo gravitational collapse forming planetesimals the size of the larger asteroids.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Emily {{originated}} out of {{a tropical}} disturbance, associated with the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), that moved off {{the west coast of}} Africa on September13. Tracking westward at a low latitude, the system fluctuated in organization, with the development and weakening of deep convection and weak outflow for several days. By September18, the disturbance entered <b>a</b> <b>region</b> <b>where</b> there was sinking air, an inhibiting factor of tropical cyclone development. Two days later, the system separated from the ITCZ and quickly developed into a tropical depression, the twelfth of the season, while located about 605miles (975kilometers) southeast of Barbados.|$|E

30|$|To be {{eligible}} for the EITC, the taxpayer needs to meet two conditions: (i) positive earned income from employment or self-employment, and (ii) earned income, adjusted gross income and investment income below certain thresholds. Conditional on eligibility, the credit entitlement depends on family earned income according to separate schedules by filing status and number of eligible children. Each schedule includes <b>a</b> phase-in <b>region</b> <b>where</b> the credit is initially increased at a certain subsidy rate, <b>a</b> flat <b>region</b> <b>where</b> the credit is kept constant at the maximum amount, and <b>a</b> phase-out <b>region</b> <b>where</b> the credit is tapered away to zero. Subsidy rate, maximum credit amount, and taper rate vary with the number of eligible children leading to a more generous welfare program in favor of large households 1.|$|R
30|$|Special {{treatments}} {{are needed to}} make the k–ε models more suitable for near-wall flows since they are basically valid for turbulent core flows, thus, flow regions sufficiently far from the walls. Generally, the near-wall flows comprise three <b>regions,</b> namely, (1) <b>a</b> viscous sublayer <b>region</b> <b>where</b> the effect of molecular viscosity is very critical in the flow transport phenomena, (2) <b>a</b> buffer <b>region</b> <b>where</b> the effect of both turbulent and molecular viscosity is important, and (3) <b>a</b> turbulent core <b>region</b> <b>where</b> the effect of molecular viscosity can be ignored. The viscous sublayer is an extremely thin layer physically.|$|R
5|$|Skopje, as the Republic of Macedonia as a whole, is characterised {{by a large}} ethnic diversity. The city {{is located}} in <b>a</b> <b>region</b> <b>where</b> Ethnic Albanians and Macedonians meet, and it welcomed Romani, Turks, Jews and Serbs {{throughout}} its history. Skopje was mainly a Muslim city until the 19th century, when large number of Christians started to settle there. According to the 2002 census, Macedonians were the largest ethnic group in Skopje, with 338,358 inhabitants, or 66.75% of the population. Then came Albanians with 103,891 inhabitants (20.49%), Roma people with 23,475 (4.63%), Serbs (14,298 inhabitants), Turks (8,595), Bosniaks (7,585) and Vlachs (2,557). 8,167 people {{did not belong to}} any of these groups.|$|E
5|$|Slavonia is a {{distinct}} region of Croatia in terms of ethnological factors in traditional music. It is <b>a</b> <b>region</b> <b>where</b> traditional culture is preserved through folklore festivals. Typical traditional music instruments belong to the tamburica and bagpipe family. The tamburica is the most representative musical instrument associated with Slavonia's traditional culture. It developed from music instruments brought by the Ottomans during their rule of Slavonia, becoming {{an integral part of}} the traditional music, its use surpassing or even replacing the use of bagpipes and gusle. A distinct form of traditional song, originating in Slavonia, the bećarac, is recognized as an intangible cultural heritage by UNESCO.|$|E
5|$|The {{radiative}} {{zone and}} the convective zone {{are separated by}} a transition layer, the tachocline. This is <b>a</b> <b>region</b> <b>where</b> the sharp regime change between the uniform rotation of the radiative zone and the differential rotation of the convection zone results in a large shear between the two—a condition where successive horizontal layers slide past one another. Presently, it is hypothesized (see Solar dynamo) that a magnetic dynamo within this layer generates the Sun's magnetic field.|$|E

The basidia (spore-bearing cells in the hymenium) are four-spored, hyaline (translucent), and measure 32–44 by 8–12μm. The cap cuticle is made of a layer 130–150μm thick, with hyaline, thin-walled gelatinized hyphae measuring 1.5–4μm broad. The hypodermium (the tissue layer directly under the pileipellis) is made of thin-walled, hyaline hyphae, 2.5–8μm broad, with a brownish incrusting pigment.
