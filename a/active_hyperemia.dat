40|$|This study {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that chronically elevated oxidant stress contributes to impaired <b>active</b> <b>hyperemia</b> in skeletal muscle of obese Zucker rats (OZR) versus lean Zucker rats (LZR) through progressive deteriorations in microvascular structure. 12 -week old LZR and OZR were given 4 -hydroxy- 2, 2, 6, 6 -tetramethylpiperidine 1 -oxyl (TEMPOL) in the drinking water for ~ 4 weeks. Subsequently, perfusion of in situ gastrocnemius muscle was determined during incremental elevations in metabolic demand, while a contralateral skeletal muscle arteriole and the gastrocnemius muscle was removed to determine dilator reactivity, vessel wall mechanics, and microvessel density. Under control conditions, <b>active</b> <b>hyperemia</b> was impaired {{at all levels of}} metabolic demand in OZR, and this was correlated with a reduced microvessel density, increased arteriolar stiffness and impaired dilator reactivity. Chronic TEMPOL ingestion improved perfusion during moderate to high metabolic demand only, and was associated with improved arteriolar reactivity and microvessel density; passive vessel mechanics were unaltered. Combined antioxidant therapy and nitric oxide synthase inhibition in OZR prevented much of the restored perfusion and microvessel density. In LZR, treatment with Nω-Nitro-L-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (L-NAME) and hydralazine (to prevent hypertension) impaire...|$|E
40|$|The {{mounting}} gradient of permeability {{along the}} small vessels of the corium is essentially unaltered by <b>active</b> <b>hyperemia</b> produced by heat, cold, or light. Only when the vascular walls are so damaged that rapid leakage ensues, {{as shown by}} the development of edema, does the permeability of the capillary web as a whole approximate that of the venules. It is plain that the normal gradient of vascular permeability depends upon the integrity of the vessel wall. The method of experiment described can be utilized for a study of the functional changes which result in the lesions due to burning and freezing...|$|E
40|$|Point: The muscle pump raises muscle {{blood flow}} during {{locomotion}} A long-standing gap {{in our understanding}} of muscle perfusion during muscular activity has been the huge (2) discrepancy between the levels of blood flow achieved by “maximal” chemical vasodilation or electrically evoked contractions and those achieved during locomotory-type exercise. The classical prevailing thought has been that there must be some unidenti-fied or “missing ” vasodilator substance. In 1987, Laughlin (5) proposed that for locomotory-type exercise the muscle pump, via a number of potential mechanisms, could in fact be the missing factor. Perplexingly, studies continue to emerge using electrically evoked contractions to allegedly probe muscle pump function, often providing predictable evidence that the muscle pump does not contribute to <b>active</b> <b>hyperemia</b> in a setting where the pump is proposed not to exist...|$|E
40|$|When the {{circulation}} reenters a part {{that has been}} briefly deprived of blood there ordinarily develops in it an <b>active</b> <b>hyperemia,</b> as every student of vascular physiology knows. But if the deprivation has endured for a somewhat longer time the happening is diametrically different. As the present paper will show, an obdurate local vasoconstriction has in some way been invoked, one so effective that the tissue involved remains closed off from {{the circulation}} for a greater or less period even though the flow through neighboring regions of the same sort is unusually good and the systemic blood pressure above the original level. Persisting ischemia of the sort here described can readily be demonstrated {{with the aid of}} highly diffusible vital dyes, in animals with blood bulk reduced by bleeding or by solutions inducing anhydremia. Under such circumstances a patchy ischemia of the superficial tissues develops after some minutes, one so complete that the patches becom...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{development}} and functional significance of exercise-induced peripheral adaptations were evaluated in aged animals with peripheral arterial insufficiency. Fisher 344 male rats (21 months old) {{were subjected to}} bilateral stenosis of the femoral arteries sufficient to limit <b>active</b> <b>hyperemia</b> but not to impair resting blood flow. Beginning the third day after stenosis, animals were (1) exercised by walking (n= 12) on a treadmill at 20 m/min at 15 % inclination, twice a day, 5 days per week, or (2) limited to cage activity (n= 10). Exercise tolerance improved from z 5 to 5 ' 35 minutes (P<. 001) over the 8 weeks of the training program but increased only marginally to = 8 minutes for the sedentary group. An isolated hind limb preparation perfused at equivalent blood flows (~: 1 ml * min-l g ` with an arterial blood oxygen content of ~"- 20 vol%) {{was used to assess}} the functional and metabolic impact of muscle-specific adaptations during sequential contractio...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of preliminary exercise (warm-up) on glycogen degradation and energy metabolism during intense cycle ergometer exercise. After determination of VO 2 max, six male subjects {{were randomly assigned to}} perform warm-up (WU) and no warm-up (NWU) trials incorporating a 2 min standardized sprint ride (SR) at 120 of the power output attained at VO 2 max (POmax). Muscle biopsies and temperature (Tm) recordings were obtained from the vastus lateralis muscle. Tm was elevated above the resting level prior to the SR during the WU trial (37. 7 Â± 0. 1 vs 35. 4 Â± 0. 4 Â°C; P < 0. 05) and remained higher than the NWU trial after the SR (38. 6 Â± 0. 2 vs 37. 1 Â± 0. 4 Â°C; P < 0. 05). Similar trends existed for rectal temperature (Tr). The increases in Tm and Tr during the SR were both greater in the NWU trial (P < 0. 05). Muscle glycogen degradation was similar for the WU and NWU trials (30. 8 Â± 3. 7 vs 25. 6 Â± 3. 7 mmol-kg- 1, respectively). When blood and muscle lactate concentrations after the SR were expressed relative to values before the SR, the WU trial resulted in a lower accumulation of blood lactate (6. 5 Â± 0. 9 vs 10. 7 Â± 0. 8 mEq 1 - 1; P < 0. 01) and muscle lactate (20. 1 Â± 0. 1 vs 23. 4 Â± 2. 2 mEq. kg- 1 wet wt.; P < 0. 05). Furthermore, oxygen consumption during the 1 st min of the SR was higher in the WU trial (2. 3 Â± 0. 2 vs 1. 9 Â± 0. 21 -min- 1; P < 0. 05). The changes in Tm indicated a potential for a maintained <b>active</b> <b>hyperemia</b> in the vastus lateralis following the warm-up. These results suggest that a maintained <b>active</b> <b>hyperemia</b> following warm-up may improve blood flow at the onset of high intensity exercise and transiently increase the aerobic contribution to muscle energy metabolism. Nevertheless, warm-up did not spare muscle glycogen during intense exercise...|$|E
40|$|The rising {{incidence}} of diabetes {{and the associated}} metabolic diseases including obesity, cardiovascular disease and hypertension have led to investigation {{of a number of}} drugs to treat these diseases. However, lifestyle interventions including diet and exercise remain the first line of defense. The benefits of exercise are typically presented in terms of weight loss, improved body composition and reduced fat mass, but exercise can have many other beneficial effects. Acute effects of exercise include major changes in blood flow through active muscle, an <b>active</b> <b>hyperemia</b> that increases the delivery of oxygen to the working muscle fibers. Longer term exercise training can affect the vasculature, improving endothelial health and possibly basal metabolic rates. Further, insulin sensitivity is improved both acutely after a single bout of exercise and shows chronic effects with exercise training, effectively reducing diabetes risk. Exercise-mediated improvements in endothelial function may also reduce complications associated with both diabetes and other metabolic disease. Thus, while drugs to improve microvascular function in diabetes continue to be investigated, exercise can also provide many similar benefits on endothelial function and should remain the first prescription when treating insulin resistance and diabetes. This review will investigate the effects of exercise on the blood vessel and the potential benefits of exercise on cardiovascular disease and diabetes...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY The {{radioactive}} microaphere {{technique was}} u«ed to trace regional blood flow and total cardiac output diatribution in rate in heart failure Becondary to biventricular volume overload during acute intravenous infusion of nitroglycerin. Data from rats with heart failure (chronic arteriovenous shunt) {{were compared to}} data obtained from rats subjected to sham surgical procedures. In both groups, data were obtained at rest and during treadmill exercise during alternate infusions of nitro-glycerin and normal saline (control). In heart failure, nitroglycerin slightly increased cardiac output at rest and during exercise, increased stroke volume, and reduced systemic vascular resistance at rest but not during exercise. In the heart failure group, exercise reduced flow to the renal, gastrointestinal, and cutaneous circulations but {{had little or no}} effect in the sham group. Nitroglycerin dramatically increased renal, gastrointestinal, and cutaneous blood flow during exercise in the heart failure group but had minimal effects on <b>active</b> <b>hyperemia</b> in the skeletal muscle bed. In the sham group, nitroglycerin decreased blood flow in the renal, gastrointestinal, and cutaneous beds and had no effect on skeletal muscle blood flow. Thus, in the renal, gastrointestinal, and cutaneous circulations during exercise, nitroglycerin increased flow in the heart failure group and decreased flow in the sham group {{to the extent that the}} respective values in the two groups were equal.

40|$|The {{object of}} the work here {{reported}} has been {{to determine whether the}} gradient of vascular permeability demonstrable in the skin of mammals (1) undergoes alteration during <b>active</b> <b>hyperemia,</b> and to learn the consequences to it of vascular injury by heat and cold. The ear of the mouse has been utilized because any alterations of the gradient of permeability during the distribution of vital dyes from the blood is almost diagrammatically visible in an altered color pattern. General Method Young mice of 18 to 20 gin. under luminal anesthesia have been employed throughout. Mter exposure of one of the ears to heat, cold, or light, a dye was injected into a tail vein, and soon thereafter both ears were lopped off with scissors to check the progress of the staining in them. They were at once arranged symmetrically in paraffin oil under the same large cover glass and studied over white porcelain in a combination of transmitted and reflected light. The exposed ear was always cut off first, since it tended to stain the more promptly. In the amputated organ the vascular network was not as sharply outlined as in the living animal, because of the loss of some of the contents of the vessels, but it could still be seen plainly enough for the relations of the staining to arterioles, capillaries, and venules, respectively, to be readily made out. Pontamine sky blue, a dye that escapes but slowly, was employed as routine because it serves better than more rapidly escaping materials to disclose slight local differences in vascular permeability. For corroboratory tests Chicago blue 6 B was injected. A study of photographs taken at once, after the amputation of ears into which pontamine blue had emerged, and 5 minutes later, disclosed no significant extravascular redistribution of the dye. Nevertheless, the comparison of the experimental and control ears was always carried out very rapidly. The technic of the lighting has been described in a previous paper (1) ...|$|E
40|$|Means {{have been}} {{described}} {{for the study of}} pressure conditions in normal and pathological skin of living human beings and mice. The true pressure in normal skin cannot be measured directly by any of the means hitherto described, because there is insufficient free fluid to make manometric determinations. However, for practical purposes, the intracutaneous pressure has been approximately estimated by introducing into skin exceedingly small amounts of a relatively unabsorbable fluid, a mixture of Locke's solution and a vital dye, and then finding the least pressure required to overcome the resistance of the skin to the passage of this fluid through it at the lowest rate measurable with accuracy by the apparatus at hand. In the present paper measurements of this pressure have been termed the interstitial resistance. In normal skin the interstitial pressure, as estimated by measurements of the interstitial resistance, is low, slightly less, on the average, than 1. 7 cm. of water in the skin of the mouse, and less than 3. 1 cm. of water in human skin. It remains unchanged in states of <b>active</b> <b>hyperemia.</b> In edematous skin the interstitial pressure can be directly measured by determination of the edema fluid pressure. It has been compared with determinations of the interstitial resistance and found to be only 0. 5 cm. of water lower in both the mouse and man. Under the conditions of our experiments, in skin rendered slowly edematous by the introduction of irritant chemicals or their topical application, little rise in pressure took place. On the other hand, in rapidly forming edema of the skin the edema fluid pressure and the intradermal interstitial resistance rose and became great enough to hinder materially the further escape of fluid from the blood vessels. The edema fluid pressure rose in proportion to the rapidity with which the edema formed. When a rapidly formed edema subsided, the edema fluid pressure and interstitial resistance fell, but if inflammation and induration followed later, the interstitial resistance became high again. As these conditions subsided the interstitial resistance fell, at times to normal levels, even in the presence of edema. In mouse skin injured by squeezing according to a standard procedure, with result in pronounced edema, the intradermal interstitial resistance rose within a few hours to levels of 10 to 15 cm. of water. In those instances in which the injury progressed to induration, the interstitial resistance rose to such high levels that it seemed impossible that fluid could continue to escape from the capillaries. Such a state of affairs may be of great importance in determining whether necrosis follows trauma...|$|E
