Greater Brooklyn was reviewed in the New York Times and served to help a number of artists begin their careers.|$|E
50|$|<b>Art</b> <b>handlers</b> and preparators {{are first}} and {{foremost}} responsible for ensuring the safety of artifacts and works of art. For works traveling out of a gallery or museum, <b>art</b> <b>handlers</b> must carefully pack objects in crates with appropriate materials {{to protect them from}} damage while in transit. Some objects may require custom boxes or custom crates that <b>art</b> <b>handlers</b> and preparators might construct on site. Similarly, when objects come into a gallery or museum, <b>art</b> <b>handlers</b> must carefully unpack the objects, paying close attention to how they were originally packed and arranged in their container. <b>Art</b> <b>handlers</b> and preparators also load and unload crates from trucks. When loading crates and packages inside an art transportation truck, <b>art</b> <b>handlers</b> and preparators must be sure to secure the crates and packages to the walls and floor of the truck storage area to prevent any type of movement during transit. <b>Art</b> <b>handlers</b> may also act as a courier, accompanying the object during its transport and being present during its unpacking at the destination. Sometimes <b>art</b> <b>handlers</b> and preparators are responsible for preparing packing and shipping paperwork.|$|R
50|$|A {{topic of}} {{controversy}} in the art handling field is the fair treatment of <b>art</b> <b>handlers.</b> Some <b>art</b> <b>handlers</b> wish to be represented by unions in order to negotiate terms and advocate for better wages and better working conditions. From August 2011 to June 2012, Sotheby's locked out 42 unionized <b>art</b> <b>handlers</b> whose contracts had expired and wished to negotiate new contracts. The Sotheby's <b>art</b> <b>handlers</b> were represented by Teamsters Local 814. Following the lockout, the unionized <b>art</b> <b>handlers</b> were given a one percent raise per year, a higher starting hourly salary, and the same worker's benefits they had previously.|$|R
50|$|<b>Art</b> <b>handlers</b> {{approach}} their careers from diverse backgrounds, including studio arts, art history, design, or production. Many <b>art</b> <b>handlers</b> are artists themselves. A high school degree and an undergraduate degree are generally required for <b>art</b> <b>handlers.</b> Some <b>art</b> <b>handlers</b> {{may also have}} academic studies in studio art, art history, humanities, or museum studies. Specialized knowledge of chemistry can be helpful to understanding potential chemical interactions between objects and packing or storage materials.|$|R

In 2010 he co-founded Native Artists For HOPE, a grass roots organization that provides mentoring, workshops and artistic empowerment to young Native American youth. Singer currently {{lives and works in}} Albuquerque, New Mexico, with his girlfriend, Nathania, who runs his website and online sales. His work is represented by a number of private galleries.|$|E
50|$|Hodges, born in Spokane, Washington, {{received}} his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from Fort Wright College in 1980. He {{received his}} Master of Fine Arts degree from Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, NY in 1986. That same year, {{he met a}} collector named Elaine Dannheisser, who gave Hodges a studio {{in the basement of}} her foundation on Duane Street in exchange for working as a part-time <b>art</b> <b>handler.</b> He had also abandoned his original medium painting and started exploring materiality. This moment became his first major artistic crisis because he had realized that his concepts weren't connecting with his paintings.|$|E
50|$|An <b>art</b> <b>handler,</b> also {{sometimes}} called an art preparator, is a trained individual who works directly with objects in museums, art galleries {{and various other}} venues including private collectors, corporate art collections, public art collections and various other institutions. Art handlers work in coordination with registrars, collection managers, conservator-restorers, exhibition designers, and curators, among others, to ensure that objects are safely handled and cared for. Often {{they are responsible for}} packing and unpacking art, installing and deinstalling art in exhibitions, and moving art around the museum and storage spaces. They {{are an integral part of}} a museum and collections care.|$|E
50|$|Responsibilities of <b>art</b> <b>handlers</b> and preparators {{differ from}} {{institution}} to institution. <b>Art</b> <b>handlers</b> {{can be employed}} by museums, art galleries, private collectors, art storage facilities, or art shipping companies. Some work full-time while others work part-time or contract for one or more museums. Depending on the {{size and scope of}} an institution, some museums will have a team of <b>art</b> <b>handlers</b> for the entire museum, whereas other museums may have permanent teams of <b>art</b> <b>handlers</b> dedicated to specific museum departments.|$|R
50|$|<b>Art</b> <b>handlers</b> {{must have}} a solid {{knowledge}} of how to handle objects safely and efficiently. They must understand the materials that make up the objects they are working with and how these materials may react with installation or packing materials. It is useful for <b>art</b> <b>handlers</b> to be spatially oriented, good at math, and possess problem solving skills. <b>Art</b> <b>handlers</b> must plan out and communicate their plan of action {{with the rest of the}} team before beginning an action.|$|R
50|$|As {{with any}} other object {{oriented}} position, <b>art</b> <b>handlers</b> and preparators must abide by codes of ethics. Similar to the American Institute of Conservation's code of ethics, <b>art</b> <b>handlers</b> as custodians of historical and art objects must have respect for all cultural property and must prioritize {{the safety of the}} object.|$|R
5000|$|At ACDC Lane, {{teams had}} to find a {{painting}} of The Scream hidden amongst the graffiti. They were instructed to trade it with an <b>art</b> <b>handler,</b> but were immediately [...] "arrested". They were taken to court where they were [...] "charged" [...] for [...] "stealing the painting" [...] and were then locked up in the Old Melbourne Gaol. In their jail cell, they found a roll of paper with a riddle on it ("The prison guard would shout out twelve, the prisoner responded with 6 and was set free.

If they managed to solve the riddle (3), teams were set free and received their next clue. If they could not solve it, teams had to wait an hour before being set free.|$|E
50|$|As a {{functioning}} {{part of the}} collection management and exhibitions team, <b>art</b> <b>handlers</b> and preparators can sometimes be responsible for photographing objects and writing condition reports. General collections care, such as monitoring environmental conditions and practicing preventative conservation in art storage spaces, are also priorities for <b>art</b> <b>handlers</b> and preparators.|$|R

50|$|Another {{key role}} of <b>art</b> <b>handlers</b> and preparators is {{preparing}} objects for display in galleries. This may include sending objects out for conservation, framing and mounting objects, and labeling objects. <b>Art</b> <b>handlers</b> and preparators {{may also be}} responsible for working with the exhibition team to prepare the gallery spaces for the objects. They are also the individuals who physically install and deinstall the art work and artifacts in the galleries.|$|R

50|$|Collection {{managers}} work {{in cooperation}} with curators, registrars, conservators, <b>art</b> <b>handlers,</b> exhibit fabricators, mount makers, facilities managers, security, and housekeeping. They are responsible for establishing and maintaining high standards of collections care, from acquisition to conservation to display. Depending on the institution, collection managers may by tasked with drawing up a departmental budget, providing expenditure projections, and if necessary, raising funds {{in the form of}} grant writing.|$|R
50|$|Most {{mid-size}} {{and large}} museums employ exhibit design staff for graphic and environmental design projects, including exhibitions. In addition to traditional 2-D and 3-D designers and architects, these staff departments may include audio-visual specialists, software designers, audience research and evaluation specialists, writers, editors, and preparators or <b>art</b> <b>handlers.</b> These staff specialists {{may also be}} charged with supervising contract design or production services. The exhibit design process builds on the interpretive plan for an exhibit, determining the most effective, engaging and appropriate methods of communicating a message or telling a story. The process will often mirror the architectural process or schedule, moving from conceptual plan, through schematic design, design development, contract document, fabrication, and installation. Museums of all sizes may also contract the outside services of exhibit fabrication businesses.|$|R
50|$|To {{determine}} {{the level of}} damage, the staff teams are prepared to systematically assess collections and exhibitions damage and provide remedies that will reduce recovery time.Small museum personnel teams consist of various combinations of registrar (museum), curators, conservators, and exhibition designers and <b>art</b> <b>handlers.</b> The teams are sorted by their involvement in either the type of collections on display or due to their participation on the initial exhibition team. If this is not known at the moment, off-site back-up information might need to be consulted. Each team has a leader that reports to the emergency response ‘project manager’ who is most likely a conservator, collections manager, or head curator. If applicable, an objects and/or textile conservator(s) can start with the exhibition with the most either loaned or vulnerable objects.|$|R
50|$|The {{amount of}} money allotted for art in each {{building}} is calculated with a formula based on the gross square footage. AIEP's curatorial team develops thematic exhibitions in collaboration with each ambassador, {{taking into account the}} host country's artistic traditions and cultural mores. They recommend artists and works of art, negotiate all loans, and propose placement of the art within the embassy residences. After all loans are secured and the art insured, AIE's registrars coordinate with professional <b>art</b> <b>handlers</b> for the assembly, packing, crating and safe shipment of each exhibition to post. Since 1963, approximately 10,000 pieces of art have been placed in ambassador residences, embassies, and consulates throughout the world, including work by Maya Lin, Jeff Koons, Ellsworth Kelly, Martin Puryear, Louise Bourgeois, Joel Shapiro, Benjamin Abramowitz and other prestigious artists. The total value of art on loan to the embassy program is estimated at $200 million.|$|R

40|$|I {{have been}} honored with an {{invitation}} to exhibit my new project 2 ̆ 2 Mining Industries 2 ̆ 2 at Heller Gallery, New York, NY, March 6 -April 12. Heller Gallery is covering all publicity for the project including a full-page advertisement in Glass Magazine and American Craft. Mining Industries (supported by a CSCE Summer Research Grant-in Aid, March 2012) explores land use through time with the incorporation of LiDar 3 D scan data {{of the earth and}} 3 d printed output. The project focuses on sites in Detroit. Houston, and Seattle with architectural and cultural significance at the peak of each cities industry. These cities and sites witnessed significant change over the 20 th century {{and in the case of}} Detroit are abandoned remnants of a manufacturing center. Sandwiched between layers of glass are obscured aerial photographs giving reference to a time of peak industrial power. The glass is a fragile reminder of the balance between time, efficiency, and the inability of manufacturing to change and meet future needs. The project aims to reconcile the potential of Detroits future while creating a comparison to its past. I am requesting 500 from CSCE to help defray the cost of a cargo van rental to transport my project and myself to New York. To ship the project with professional <b>art</b> <b>handlers</b> is estimated at over 2500 and round trip airfare is estimated at 360 (Kalamazoo to New York). Renting a cargo van will allow me to transport the project and attend the opening at a significantly reduced cost. I will be in attendance at the opening reception on March 6 th and plan to give a free and public gallery talk on Saturday, March 8 th. I also plan to use 200 from my Department Faculty Development funds to cover additional expenses while in New York and an estimated 312 in personal funds to cover my food while traveling March 2 - 9, 2014. In addition, I will also submit a Mini Grant application to help defray the costs associated transport of the work.

40|$|Children, LiteratureLife Lessons Ellen Handler Spitz What Charlie Heard || by Mordicai Gerstein Gertrude is Gertrude is Gertrude is Gertrude || by Jonah Winter Biographies for {{children}} tend to err by romanticizing their subjects, setting them up as paragons, and perpetuating stereotypes, {{in the spirit of}} Longfellow’s stirring and bombastic lines: “Lives of great men all remind us/ We can make our lives sublime,/ And, departing, leave behind us/ Footprints on the sands of time. ” But two recently published picture books, remarkable examples of the genre, eschew embarrassments of this sort. These books depict the American modernists Charles Ives and Gertrude Stein, not exactly conventional heroes {{for children}}, and expertly recount experiences drawn from their lives. Stein and Ives were born two years apart, in 1872 and 1874, in Allegheny, Pennsylvania and Danbury, Connecticut, respectively. They shared decades of neglect by an indifferent, uncomprehending public until, belatedly, their achievements were recognized. In 1933, with the publication of The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas, Stein effectively became, in France and in the United States, Gertrude Stein, while much later, in 1947, a dispirited Ives received the Pulitzer Prize for his Third Symphony (“The Camp Meeting”) after a New York performance conducted by Lou Harrison. Gerstein and Winter, inspired by modernism’s spirit of formal experimentation, offer smart and frolicsome entrées into Stein’s and Ives’s worlds. With great brio, they demonstrate what it felt like, sounded like, and looked like to have been their unusual protagonists. Neither book pretends to tell the whole story. Sparked by bold color and cunning designs, they introduce today’s children to their quirky protagonist-artists from the inside out. Gerstein and Winter welcome children into creative contact with Ives and Stein. They elicit identification, laughter, and moments of genuine pathos. On the jacket of What Charlie Heard, a young Ives, drawn true to his photographs as a boy of about ten, stands before us in suspenders and knee britches. Casually, he holds the emblems of his two great loves, music and sports: a baseball bat in his left hand and several sheets of music in his right. The first instruments he learned to play, the drum and the trumpet, rest nearby within easy reach. His eyes have a faraway look. Clearly, he is listening. All around him, we can tell exactly what he is hearing: TA TA TA TA, BONG BONG, KABLAM, POW! CRACK! CLANG! SQUEAK, CRACK! SPLASH! CLOP CLOP, WHOOOOOOOSH… Painted letters in varied fonts and sizes, colored blue, red, yellow, white, some bordered, others not, spaced idiosyncratically and traveling every which way, crowd the space. Thronging and overlapping, they form a veritable dictionary of onomatopoeia. Charlie, we grasp, is a child who dwells in a universe of pulsating sound, to which he pays pleasurable attention. Throughout the book a perpetual medley of sound fills the air. On page after page, painted sound-words march, dance, fall, spring up, cavort, and canter before our eyes. By means of Gerstein’s graphics, we are made to see what Ives hears. With minimal coaching, children listening to this picture book will soon chime in and make the noises themselves. In this way, What Charlie Heard becomes an experience that takes children inside the composer’s world and, also—by foregrounding previously ignored ambient sound—stimulates aesthetic experience. Children begin—like Ives—to imitate and improvise: to “compose. ” Focusing on Ives’s intimate relationship with his oddball bandmaster father George, a gifted cornet player and dedicated music teacher, who, as a boy himself, played for Union troops during the Civil War, Gerstein shows us just how George Ives becomes his son’s first mentor and lifelong inspiration. One day during a thunderstorm, as church bells ring, George dashes outdoors to listen. Dripping wet, he returns to the house and, sitting down at the piano, tries to replicate what he has just heard. The chords seem not quite right so he rushes back into the rain to repeat his experiment. Little Charlie watches, listens; then he too goes to the keyboard and tries to do the same. On another occasion, George Ives arranges for two bands to march through the streets of Danbury in opposite directions each playing a different tune. Charlie never forgets this: the experience finds its way years later into the second movement of his orchestral work, Three Places in New England. On a double page spread, George takes Charlie to a camp meeting at night under a tent, where ordinary people with untrained voices join together to sing hymns and create soaring impromptu music. Bursting forth on these pages are the apparently insignificant beginnings of what eventually become the hallmark of Ives’s musical composition—an enthralling mix of radical experimentation with an affectionate love for tradition. The birth of this style occurs importantly {{in the context of an}} intensely felt father-son collaboration. When, during Charles Ives’s freshman year at Yale, George Ives dies, a double page spread empties out before our eyes, and the bereft boy stands perfectly still in his pajamas next to an unhooked wall telephone, his hair unkempt from sleep, his arms hanging limp at his sides, painted in pale shadow. Slowly we read: “Charlie heard a great silence. ” In the lexicon Gerstein has so luminously developed for us throughout the preceding pages, we understand that empty space means the absence of sound. Any child reaching this page cannot help but be sobered and moved, even to the verge of tears. The loss is as real as can be achieved in a representational medium. And when we see Ives many years hence, bearded and aged, still listening, fantasizing now in his dreamy abortive way about the Universal Symphony he will never write, we and the children both know beyond words that the loss of his father remains with him and will never be assuaged. Unlike Mordicai Gerstein, Jonah Winter does not attempt to recount the story of Gertrude Stein’s life. His mood is different. He makes an ingenious choice: he invites children to a tea party at 27 rue de Fleurus, Stein’s legendary art-filled apartment in the sixth arrondissement in Paris, just off the Jardin du Luxembourg. There, alongside her guests—including Picasso, Matisse, and Hemingway—children meet Gertrude and Alice B. Toklas, who are both sitting in chairs, staring. (“Not the chairs. Chairs never stare. ”) Gently parodic prose spiced with homonym, clang association, irony, nonsense rhyme, digression, and zany rhetoric pull the child into this curious cosmos. Enchanted by Calef Brown’s paintings, with their muted hues reminiscent of Gris’s and Picasso’s cubism, the child even meets Basket, Gertrude’s snooty clipped poodle. Romping from page to page, the text forces the eyes as well as the mind to bounce like rubber balls. Reading this book aloud to a four-and-a-half year old and to several other children, I made the obvious discovery that children are high modernists. They revel in repetition. They delight in Winter’s quasi-parental autocratic admonitions: “But but but but wait a minute… heavens no…no no no no no… More talk. Laugh. Okay. Enough. ” At the end of the party, a great disconnected arm (Alice’s, no doubt) reaches out with a long pink index finger and extends, pointing, across the entire page: “Okay time for you to leave… Leave. Go. Out, out, out. ” You must leave because Miss Gertrude writes at night while Alice sleeps. Her hand-written words tumble magically across the page into Alice’s typewriter when, the next morning, while Gertrude is sleeping, Alice diligently transcribes them. Earlier, Picasso enters the party, his iconic straight hair falling over his left eye. He looks angry, says the text: “He just invented Modern art which is not the same as being angry but then again maybe it is. Maybe it is and maybe it isn’t. Then again maybe it is. It’s so hard to invent Modern art. ” The four-year-old boy I know laughs uproariously at these lines—and his father now asks him routinely whether he is really angry or whether he has just invented Modern art! Ample Gertrude and slender Alice relate to one another in a complementary way; comfortable and unexceptional, their lesbianism simply a fact, unremarkable and unaccented. What matters supremely in both of these outstanding children’s books is that they enable children to grow aesthetically. And both books teach that significant human relationships have been indispensable to certain great artists and deeply implicated in their path-breaking works of <b>art.</b> Ellen <b>Handler</b> Spitz is Honors College Professor at the University of Maryland (UMBC). Her forthcoming book, Illuminating Childhood, will be published in early 2011. She writes regularly about children’s literature for The Book...|$|R
40|$|MoMA and Child: The Century of the Child at the Museum of Modern <b>Art</b> by Ellen <b>Handler</b> Spitz The Century of the Child:: Growing by Design 1900 - 2000 at the Museum of Modern Art July 29 to November 5, 2012 11 West 53 rd Street, between Fifth and Sixth avenues New York City, www. moma. org Arriving expectantly at {{the sixth}} floor atrium of MOMA, prodded by a mad crush of child-loving {{visitors}} {{of all ages and}} nationalities, you are met by the blow-up of an original gelatin silver print (Boy on Wall, Hammarkullen by Jens S. Jensen, 1973). From a massive face of concrete blocks a child dangles, eerily hanging by his right arm, more than a body’s height above the ground. Is it a boy or a girl? The figure wears a leather jacket, or possibly that’s a quilted fabric, hard to tell, and the frowzy blond Christopher Robin haircut might signal either gender. What about the smile? Not an exhibitionistic grin, as in “Hey, everybody! Look what I can do!” Just a glance, acknowledging your arrival: “Oh, it’s you,” as if being suspended by one hand high above the earth were the most natural way in the world to greet someone. No bravado, no fear of falling. The perplexities of this uncanny image epitomize the show. As you stare at it, you experience dysphoria, weightlessness, a fleeting sense of levitation, and you may even recoup your own childhood wish to float above the ground. For the boy (it is, we read, a boy, named Michael, aged nine) actually seems to be suspended in front of the wall, not securely attached to it. Is this an illusion, or not? What, this image makes you wonder, will this exhibit on The Century of the Child have to do with flesh and blood children, pace its title? Who or what is the child? What does it mean to design for the child? What are the ethics of such an enterprise? Presuming overall a rather bland and benign notion of childhood (think of Locke’s tabula rasa), the show withdraws for the most part from messy engagements with actual children. Children float suspended and detached from what is presented: like the figure in the Swedish photograph, the work on view in these MOMA galleries bypasses emotion (with some notable exceptions, including film footage related to the 1940 s work of Bauhaus-trained designer Friedl Dicker-Brandeis with children in the Terezín concentration camp near Prague, and Polish director Andrzej Wolski’s 2011 film, Toys, that features Warsaw children scrounging in the rubble after World War II). Much of the intense passion, however—the felt crises, anxieties, puzzlements, riotous humor, and delirious joys— that characterize living children both mentally and behaviorally has gone missing. The distance off the ground, so to speak, can be disconcerting. Indeed, what this ample, richly crowded, and perhaps unintentionally provocative seven-room exhibition reveals—in spite of itself— is a thoroughgoing exposé, decade after decade, of nearly unbroken top-down efforts to use, exploit, and control as well as engage children, sometimes by imitating them, occasionally by mocking them, all the while subsuming them under whatever artistic style, political agenda, or commercial opportunity happens to be ascendant. No major effort has been taken by the otherwise remarkably diligent curators to do more than show this. How have the successive waves of stylized objects on display—toys, furniture, books, clothing, as well as imagery, shifting educational practices, and spatial arrangements actually impacted the children exposed to them? A visitor seeks in vain for critique and evaluation—for any report on the later effects of all this adult-perpetrated design on youth. Few questions are aired. A typical text panel reads: “In such rooms, it was felt, children’s spontaneity and pleasure in learning would flourish. ” But why was that felt? And by whom? And was this feeling ever put to a test? Walking from room to room, you are struck by the way the putative child, objectified despite protestations to the contrary, has been incorporated into period style, the vector being culture > child, not the reverse: the Arts & Crafts Movement, Art Nouveau, Expressionism, Futurism, De Stijl, Pop Art, digital art. Despite claims that artists’ approaches were rooted in desires to understand children, you may come away feeling that, if the twentieth century is indeed The Century of the Child, surely that child is as much a projection of adult fantasy and social ideology as the pale coy innocents of the pre-Raphaelites or the bedizened seventeenth century infantas of Velázquez. A Gargantuan wooden table with a climbable oversized chair and step stool offer adults who try them out a bodily take on children’s experience. Mugging visitors pose on them for photo ops, while uniformed security personnel control access by ordering people brusquely to form a queue. For one split second, I clamber up on the chair and, when the tabletop reaches barely to my nose, my bygone helplessness and marginalization as a child rush back in a flood: I am Gulliver in Brobdingnag until an officious guard whisks me away: “You can’t spend any time here,” he admonishes sternly; now, I truly am a child. Visitors chuckle and guffaw at wall-mounted black and white 1927 footage of a three or four-year-old who steers his kiddie-motor wheel of fanciful circular design along an empty road. His father, in fedora, tie, and three-piece suit, chases him dutifully, unable to keep up as the child and his mini-vehicle careen along a wide unpopulated avenue in zigzag swaths, as if illustrating the line from Isaiah 11 (“the little child shall lead them”) or Wordsworth’s similar sentiment from the Rainbow poem of 1802. Throughout the exhibit, which is thronged morning and afternoon, spectators seem euphoric, entranced by images such as this. They appear bemused and nostalgic, while their children respond especially to movement for, as Fénelon wisely wrote, children are happiest when their bodies are in motion, when they can change position. Late in the show, you come upon a striking work that chimes with the Jensen photograph you met at the start: Paul Rand, in 1996, shortly before his death, composes a flat black child, upside down, arms akimbo, balancing precariously on a slanting tightrope made of words. The great designer fills in the body with saucy details from Breughel’s Children’s Games (1560) to create an indelible poster in support of a village devoted to orphaned and abandoned children. Aesthetically, top prize belongs to The Adventures of Prince Achmed, an exquisite dreamlike shadow film by Berlin artist Lotte Reiniger (1923 - 25) that plays silently in a gallery labeled “Avant Garde Play Time. ” Possibly the earliest surviving animated film, this gossamer confection was painstakingly made by hand, its style inspired by finger puppets, embroidery, and lace making. Reiniger, who invented her own techniques, created this masterpiece by scissor work, intricately cutting out characters of astonishingly delicate beauty, which, in an evanescent world, sway, prance, bow, and embrace while enacting stories of intrigue, romance, and suspense drawn from the Arabian Nights. Reiniger’s villain, a wicked enchanter known as the African Magician, appears maleficently in Aladdin and the Magic Lamp. To stand spellbound watching as these silhouetted tales unfurl their sinister plots and metamorphoses in ever-swirling motion until Prince Achmed is at last reunited with his slender fairy Peri Banou, is to recapture a childhood in which magic is real and flying demons are more true than anything attached to solid earth. This thought returns us to the elevated image with which we began — the photographed child in the air— and leads me to conclude that, if real children {{are to be found in}} this show, they must be summoned, like genii, from encounters with whatever designed objects move us most, for there is, after all, no such thing as the child but rather millions of uniquely responsive children, and adults, for whom childhood, despite varying degrees of distance, can still be occasionally invoked. Perhaps that is as close as we will ever come to the angel with the flaming sword who guards the way back, as Ernst Gombrich wrote famously once in his essay on the hobby horse...|$|R
