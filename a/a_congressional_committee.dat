5|$|Ten {{days after}} Washington's death, <b>a</b> <b>Congressional</b> <b>committee</b> {{recommended}} {{a different type}} of monument. John Marshall, a Representative from Virginia (who later became Chief Justice of the United States) proposed that a tomb be erected within the Capitol. However, a lack of funds, disagreement over what type of memorial would best honor the country's first president, and the Washington family's reluctance to move his body prevented progress on any project.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, {{he became}} {{involved}} in a controversy known as the Business Plot, when he told <b>a</b> <b>congressional</b> <b>committee</b> {{that a group of}} wealthy industrialists were planning a military coup to overthrow Franklin D. Roosevelt, with Butler selected to lead a march of veterans to become dictator, similar to other Fascist regimes at that time. The individuals involved all denied the existence of a plot and the media ridiculed the allegations. A final report by a special House of Representatives Committee confirmed some of Butler's testimony.|$|E
5|$|Also {{during the}} first session of the Tenth Congress, Rowan {{proposed}} that <b>a</b> <b>congressional</b> <b>committee</b> be formed to investigate accusations against General James Wilkinson that, in 1788, he took money from the government of Spain in exchange for efforts to separate Kentucky from Virginia and unite it with Spain rather than the United States. Aaron Burr {{had been accused of}} working with Wilkinson in the so-called Spanish Conspiracy, and when Burr had approached Rowan in 1806 to solicit his services in defending Burr against the charges, Rowan had declined because he believed Burr to be guilty. Rowan's proposal to form an investigative committee against Wilkinson failed, but he succeeded in gaining approval for a committee to investigate federal judge Harry Innes' purported role in the Conspiracy. Rowan was appointed to the committee and delivered its report April 19, 1808; the report stated that the committee could find no evidence of wrongdoing by Innes.|$|E

5|$|Arroway falls {{unconscious}} as {{she begins}} traveling back through a wormhole. She awakens {{to find herself}} {{on the floor of}} the pod, the mission control team repeatedly hailing her. She learns that, from outside the machine, it appears the pod merely dropped through the machine's rings and landed in a safety net. Arroway insists that she was gone for approximately 18 hours, but her recording devices show only static. <b>A</b> <b>Congressional</b> <b>Committee</b> is formed and speculates that the Vega signal and machine were a hoax designed by the now-deceased Hadden. Although she cannot prove it happened, Arroway asks the committee to accept the truth of her testimony on faith. In a private conversation, Kitz and White House official Rachel Constantine reflect on confidential information that, although Arroway's recording device only recorded static, it recorded 18 hours of it. Arroway and Joss reunite, and Arroway receives ongoing financial support to expand the SETI program.|$|E

25|$|Although George Washington {{had been}} a member of the Continental Congress, he had assumed the {{position}} of commander-in-chief of the Continental Army in 1775, so it would be unlikely that he would have headed <b>a</b> <b>congressional</b> <b>committee</b> in 1776. However he did serve on a committee with John Ross' uncle George Read in 1776 (see below).|$|E

25|$|Wilder {{established}} the Gilda Radner Hereditary Cancer Program at Cedars-Sinai to screen high-risk candidates (such as women of Ashkenazi Jewish descent) and to run basic diagnostic tests. He testified before <b>a</b> <b>Congressional</b> <b>committee</b> that Radner's condition had been misdiagnosed {{and that if}} doctors had inquired more deeply into her family background they would have learned that her grandmother, aunt, and cousin all died of ovarian cancer, and therefore they might have attacked the disease earlier.|$|E
25|$|The {{accident}} was particularly alarming in that {{public confidence in}} air travel had increased during the 1950s {{with the introduction of}} new airliners like the Super Constellation, Douglas DC-7, and Boeing Stratocruiser. Travel by air had become routine for large corporations, and vacationers often considered flying instead of traveling by train. At the time, <b>a</b> <b>congressional</b> <b>committee</b> was reviewing domestic air travel, as there was growing concern over the number of accidents. However, little progress was being made and the state of ATC {{at the time of the}} Grand Canyon accident reflected the methods of the 1930s.|$|E

25|$|After the war, he {{returned}} to Washington D.C. {{for a series of}} staff assignments and promotion to rear admiral. He served successively as assistant chief of naval personnel; as assistant chief of naval operations; as budget director of the Navy from 1946 to 1950, in which role he played a minor part in the Revolt of the Admirals when his testimony before <b>a</b> <b>Congressional</b> <b>committee</b> suggested that Secretary of Defense Louis Johnson had usurped the powers of Congress by unilaterally refusing to spend appropriated funds; and as deputy comptroller of the Navy Department from 1950 to 1952.|$|E
25|$|He {{also served}} {{as the leader of}} the Free D.C. Movement, {{strongly}} supporting increased home rule, as <b>a</b> <b>Congressional</b> <b>committee</b> exercised administrative rule over the district. Barry quit SNCC in 1967, when H. Rap Brown became chairman of the group. In 1967, Barry and Mary Treadwell co-founded Pride, Inc., a Department of Labor-funded program to provide job training to unemployed black men. The group employed hundreds of teenagers to clean littered streets and alleys in the district. Barry and Treadwell had met while students at Fisk University, and they later met again while picketing in front of the Washington Gas Light Company.|$|E
25|$|In 1984 MacFarlane warned <b>a</b> <b>congressional</b> <b>committee</b> of scatological {{behavior}} and animals being slaughtered in bizarre rituals that children {{were forced to}} watch. Shortly after, the United States Congress doubled its budget for child-protection programs. Psychiatrist Roland Summit delivered conferences {{in the wake of}} the McMartin trial and depicted the phenomenon as a conspiracy that involved anyone skeptical of the phenomenon. By 1986, social worker Carol Darling argued to a grand jury that the conspiracy reached the government. Her husband Brad Darling gave conference presentations about a Satanic conspiracy of great antiquity which he believed now permeated American communities.|$|E

25|$|In January 1871, Pennsylvania Republican Senator John Scott convened <b>a</b> <b>Congressional</b> <b>committee</b> {{which took}} {{testimony}} from 52 witnesses about Klan atrocities, accumulating 12 volumes. In February, former Union General and Congressman Benjamin Franklin Butler of Massachusetts introduced the Civil Rights Act of 1871 (Ku Klux Klan Act). This {{added to the}} enmity that southern white Democrats bore toward him. While the bill was being considered, further violence in the South swung support for its passage. The Governor of South Carolina appealed for federal troops to assist his efforts in keeping control of the state. A riot and massacre occurred in a Meridian, Mississippi courthouse, from which a black state representative escaped by fleeing to the woods. The 1871 Civil Rights Act allowed President Ulysses S. Grant to suspend habeas corpus.|$|E
25|$|A {{special report}} by the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism (PCIJ) showed how the {{projects}} relating to the Expo site not only revealed the extravagance and inefficiency of the administration, but also served as convenient vehicle to effect election fund-raising for the LAKAS political party of Ramos {{at the expense of}} the tax-paying Filipinos and in violation of the Election Code. The Centennial Expo Pilipino project, intended to be the centerpiece for the celebrations for the 100th anniversary of the country's independence from Spain, also earned extensive criticisms for being an expensive white elephant project that disadvantaged the government at the cost of P9 billion, or 1.7 percent of the country's 1998 national budget. Six ranking Ramos cabinet members and officials, headed by Salvador Laurel (former Vice-President), chairman of the Centennial Commission, were cleared by the Ombudsman and Sandigan Bayan (People's Court). Ramos appeared before <b>a</b> <b>Congressional</b> <b>Committee</b> in October 1998 to help exonerate said officials of any wrongdoing.|$|E
25|$|On June 30, 2006, Rosie Malek-Yonan, {{was invited}} to testify on Capitol Hill before <b>a</b> <b>Congressional</b> <b>Committee</b> of the 109th Congress on {{religious}} freedom regarding the genocide, massacres and persecution of Assyrians in Iraq {{since the beginning of}} the 2003 Iraq War. Reading from her book, she compared the Assyrian Genocide of 1914-1918, as depicted in The Crimson Field, to the current plight of the indigenous Assyrian Christians in Iraq. Her 30-minute testimony and plea to the U.S. government, ultimately prompted Congressman Chris Smith (R-NJ) to travel to war-torn Iraq to witness matters for himself. While in Iraq, after meeting with local Assyrians, he turned in Malek-Yonan's in depth report to U.S. Officials in Iraq. One year later, a Congressional appropriations subcommittee voted to send $10 million to aid the Assyrians in Iraq. The complete archived transcript and webcast of the actual Congressional Testimony is available at the website of the U.S. House of Representatives.|$|E

25|$|In September 1993, General Powell asked Aspin {{to approve}} {{the request of the}} U.S. {{commander}} in Somalia for tanks, armored vehicles and AC-130 Spectre gunships for his forces. Aspin turned down the request. Shortly thereafter Aidid's forces in Mogadishu killed 18 U.S. soldiers and wounded more than 75 in attacks that also resulted in the shooting down of two U.S. helicopters and the capture of one pilot (see the Battle of Mogadishu). In the face of severe congressional criticism, Aspin admitted that in view of what had happened he had made a mistake, but stated that the request for armored equipment had been made within the context of delivering humanitarian aid to Somalia rather than protecting troops. In an appearance before <b>a</b> <b>congressional</b> <b>committee</b> to answer questions about the Somalia disaster, Aspin made an unfavorable impression and appeared weak in response to the detailed probing and criticism of his performance. The president publicly defended Aspin but made clear that the White House was not involved in the decision not to send armor reinforcements to Somalia. Several members of Congress called on Clinton to ask for Aspin's resignation.|$|E
