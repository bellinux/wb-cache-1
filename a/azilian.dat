25|$|According to some theories, Basques may be {{the least}} assimilated remnant of the Paleolithic {{inhabitants}} of Western Europe (specifically those of the Franco-Cantabrian region known as <b>Azilian)</b> to the Indo-European migrations. Basque tribes were mentioned by Greek writer Strabo and Roman writer Pliny, including the Vascones, the Aquitani, and others. There is considerable evidence to show their Basque ethnicity in Roman times {{in the form of}} place-names, Caesar's reference to their customs and physical make-up, the so-called Aquitanian inscriptions recording names of people and gods (approx. 1st century, see Aquitanian language), etc.|$|E
25|$|Around 12,500BC, the Würm {{glaciation}} ended. Slowly, {{through the}} following millennia, temperatures and sea levels rose, changing {{the environment of}} prehistoric people. Nevertheless, Magdalenian culture persisted until c. 10,000BC, when it quickly evolved into two microlithist cultures: <b>Azilian</b> (Federmesser), in Spain and southern France, and then Sauveterrian, in northern France and Central Europe, while in Northern Europe the Lyngby complex succeeded the Hamburg culture with {{the influence of the}} Federmesser group as well. Evidence of permanent settlement dates from the 8th millennium BC in the Balkans. The Neolithic reached Central Europe in the 6th millennium BC and parts of Northern Europe in the 5th and 4th millenniums BC.|$|E
2500|$|But in {{my opinion}} this term is not justified, {{as it would be}} if these phases {{presented}} a natural evolutionary development – a progressive transformation from Paleolithic to Neolithic. In reality, the final phase of the Capsian, the Tardenoisian, the <b>Azilian</b> and the northern Maglemose industries are the posthumous descendants of the Palaeolithic ...|$|E
60|$|They were {{entering}} upon {{a new phase}} in human culture, the Neolithic phase (New Stone Age) as distinguished from the Palæolithic (Old Stone) phase of the Cro-Magnards, the Grimaldi people, the <b>Azilians</b> and their like. [1] Slowly these Neolithic people spread over the warmer parts of the world; and the arts they had mastered, the plants and animals they had learnt to use, spread by imitation and acquisition even more widely than they did. By 10,000 B.C., most of mankind was at the Neolithic level.|$|R
60|$|Almost {{fifteen or}} twelve {{thousand}} years ago a fresh people drifted into the south of Spain, and left very remarkable drawings of themselves upon exposed rock faces there. These were the <b>Azilians</b> (named from the Mas d'Azil cave). They had the bow; {{they seem to have}} worn feather headdresses; they drew vividly; but also they had reduced their drawings to a sort of symbolism--a man for instance would be represented by a vertical dab with two or three horizontal dabs--that suggest the dawn of the writing idea. Against hunting sketches there are often marks like tallies. One drawing shows two men smoking out a bees' nest.|$|R
2500|$|He had {{excavated}} {{the type}} {{site of the}} <b>Azilian</b> Culture, the basis of today's Mesolithic. He found it sandwiched between the Magdalenian and the Neolithic. The tools were {{like those of the}} Danish kitchen-middens, termed the Surface Period by Evans, which were the basis of Westropp's Mesolithic. They were Mode 5 stone tools, or microliths. He mentions neither Westropp nor the Mesolithic, however. For him this was a [...] "solution of continuity (solution de continuité)" [...] To it he assigns the semi-domestication of dog, horse, cow, etc., which [...] "greatly facilitated the work of neolithic man (a beaucoup facilité la tàche de l'homme néolithique)." [...] Brown in 1892 does not mention Mas-d'Azil. He refers to the [...] "transition or 'Mesolithic' forms" [...] but to him these are [...] "rough hewn axes chipped over the entire surface" [...] mentioned by Evans as the earliest of the Neolithic. Where Piette believed he had discovered something new, Brown wanted to break out known tools considered Neolithic.|$|E
60|$|At first {{writing was}} merely an {{abbreviated}} method of pictorial record. Even before Neolithic times men {{were beginning to}} write. The <b>Azilian</b> rock pictures to which we have already referred show {{the beginning of the}} process. Many of them record hunts and expeditions, and in most of these the human figures are plainly drawn. But in some the painter would not bother with head and limbs; he just indicated men by a vertical and one or two transverse strokes. From this to a conventional condensed picture writing was an easy transition. In Sumeria, where the writing was done on clay with a stick, the dabs of the characters soon became unrecognizably unlike the things they stood for, but in Egypt where men painted on walls and on strips of the papyrus reed (the first paper) the likeness to the thing imitated remained. From the fact that the wooden styles used in Sumeria made wedge-shaped marks, the Sumerian writing is called cuneiform (= wedge-shaped).|$|E
60|$|We {{are still}} very ignorant about the {{beginnings}} of cultivation and settlement in the world although {{a vast amount of}} research and speculation has been given to these matters in the last fifty years. All that we can say with any confidence at present is that somewhen about 15,000 and 12,000 B.C. while the <b>Azilian</b> people were in the south of Spain and while the remnants of the earlier hunters were drifting northward and eastward, somewhere in North Africa or Western Asia or in that great Mediterranean valley that is now submerged under the waters of the Mediterranean sea, there were people who, age by age, were working out two vitally important things; they were beginning cultivation and they were domesticating animals. They were also beginning to make, in addition to the chipped implements of their hunter forebears, implements of polished stone. They had discovered the possibility of basketwork and roughly woven textiles of plant fibre, and they were beginning to make a rudely modelled pottery.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Azilian</b> {{is a name}} {{given by}} archaeologists to an {{industry}} of the Epipaleolithic in northern Spain and southern France.|$|E
50|$|From the Paleolithic to the Mesolithic, the Magdalenian culture evolved. In South-West France and Spain, {{one finds}} the <b>Azilian</b> {{culture of the}} Late Glacial Maximum which co-existed with similar early Mesolithic European {{cultures}} such as the Tjongerian of North-Western, the Ahrensburgian of Northern and the Swiderian of North-Eastern Europe, all succeeding the Federmesser complex. The <b>Azilian</b> culture {{was followed by the}} Sauveterrian in Southern France and Switzerland, the Tardenoisian in Northern France, the Maglemosian in Northern Europe.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Azilian</b> point {{links the}} Magdalenian microlith points {{with those from}} the western Epipaleolithic. They can be {{identified}} by a rough and invasive retouching.|$|E
5000|$|Belgian Limburg {{in the ice}} ages is assumed, like {{neighbouring}} {{areas of}} Europe, to have been home to dispersed populations of nomadic hunter gatherers including Neanderthals and later waves of [...] "Anatomically modern humans". Upper and middle paleolithic finds in Limburg are not common compared to findings to {{the south in the}} Wallonian province of Liège. In the upper paleolithic archaeological finds also become more common in Limburg. In general terms, the area was part of the broadly defined cultural group known as the Magdalenian (17,000 BP to 9,000 BP), and then the <b>Azilian.</b> The particular type of <b>Azilian</b> was known as the Tjongerian, which is in turn part of the Federmesser group of <b>Azilian</b> cultures. Tjongerian finds have been made in Lommel, Zolder, and Zonhoven, on the southern edge of the sandy Campine lowlands in the north of the province.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Azilian</b> finds {{are almost}} as rich as the Magdalenian ones. They stand out with their typical spearheads and flat {{harpoons}} made from deer antlers.|$|E
50|$|It {{probably}} {{dates to}} {{the period of the}} Allerød Oscillation around 12,000 years ago (uncalibrated) and followed the Magdalenian culture. Archaeologists think the <b>Azilian</b> represents {{the tail end of the}} Magdalenian as the warming climate brought about changes in human behaviour in the area. The effects of melting ice sheets would have diminished the food supply and probably impoverished the previously well-fed Magdalenian manufacturers. As a result, <b>Azilian</b> tools and art were cruder and less expansive than their Ice Age predecessors - or simply different.|$|E
50|$|Consequently, few if {{any people}} could survive in Brittany prior {{to the end of}} the last glaciation, and only a few Palaeolithic sites are known from Brittany, like the rock shelter of Perros-Guirec near Rochworn. The only cave site known so far is Roc'h Toul in a {{sandstone}} promontory near Guiclan (Finistère). The cave contained about 200 artifacts and was dated to the late Magdalenian by de Mortillet. Because of the presence of points with curved backs, it is now connected with the epipalaeolithic <b>Azilian.</b> Other <b>Azilian</b> sites include Parc-an-Plenen and Enez Guennoc.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Azilian</b> coexisted {{with similar}} early Mesolithic European {{cultures}} {{such as the}} Tjongerian and the Ahrensburg culture of Northern Europe, the Swiderian of North-Eastern Europe, and the Creswellian in Britain.|$|E
50|$|The main abri was {{inhabited}} in {{the middle}} and upper Magdalenian {{as well as in the}} <b>Azilian,</b> which roughly corresponds to the time segment from 14,000 until 10,000 years BP.|$|E
50|$|The {{deposits}} of Rochereil cave {{can be divided}} into two archeological levels further subdivided into single strata. The older succession dates back to the Magdalenian VI and the younger one to the <b>Azilian.</b>|$|E
5000|$|While in the Franco-Cantabrian region {{it has a}} minor impact, not {{altering}} the <b>Azilian</b> culture substantially, in Mediterranean Iberia and Portugal its arrival is more noticeable. The Mediterranean geometrical microlithism has two facies: ...|$|E
50|$|The Rochereil cave has {{not been}} dated absolutely, but the {{unearthed}} artefacts are characteristic for the Magdalenian VI and for the <b>Azilian.</b> This corresponds to the age period of 12.500 to 10.500 years BP.|$|E
50|$|Haplogroup I2a {{may be the}} haplogroup of {{the first}} anatomically modern humans to inhabit Europe, Cro-Magnon. A 2015 study found haplogroup I2a in 13,000 year old remains from the <b>Azilian</b> culture (at modern Bichon, Switzerland).|$|E
50|$|Raymonden-North is a {{much older}} prehistoric site already {{inhabited}} during the Mousterian. The main cave spans the entire Magdalenian which corresponds roughly to the interval 17.000 to 11.000 years BP. It possibly was also inhabited during the <b>Azilian.</b>|$|E
50|$|Painted pebbles are a {{class of}} Pictish {{artifact}} found in northern Scotland dating from the first millennium AD. They are comparable to those that characterize the <b>Azilian</b> period in the Art of the Upper Paleolithic on the continent.|$|E
50|$|A culture {{very similar}} to the <b>Azilian</b> spread as well into Mediterranean Spain and {{southern}} Portugal. Because it lacked bone industry it is named distinctively as Iberian microlaminar microlithism. It was replaced by the so-called geometrical microlithism related to Tardenoisian culture.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} the Ice Age, Magdalenian culture {{gave way}} to <b>Azilian</b> culture. Hunters turned from large animals to smaller prey, and fishing and seafood {{gathering}} became important economic activities. The southern part of the Basque Country was first settled in this period.|$|E
50|$|As {{in other}} post-Magdalenian areas, the {{disappearance}} of realistic cave art is quite noticeable. Instead the typical <b>Azilian</b> decorated pebbles have been found, {{as well as some}} geometrically decorated bones and plates. Additionally personal ornaments, made up of teeth or shells, are common as well.|$|E
