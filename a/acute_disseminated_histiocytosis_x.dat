40|$|The {{magnetic}} resonance imaging features of two cases of <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> in the hypothalamus {{and one in the}} cerebral hemispheres are described. The lesions were best seen with spin-echo technique using a long repetition time (TR = 1580 msec) and long echo time (TE = 80 msec). Sagittal images provided the best anatomicotopographic evaluation of the lesions. Comparison with computed tomography with and without contrast enhancement showed an advantage with {{magnetic resonance}} imaging. <b>Disseminated</b> <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> is a reticuloendothelial disorder of unknown etiology that often involves the central nervous system. Direct radiologic demonstration of <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> lesions in the central nervous system was made possible by the introduction of computed tomography (CT) [1, 2]. We demonstrate the use of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in the evaluation of <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> lesions in the common hypothalamic location as well as the less common hemispheric site. The MR findings were compared with those of CT. Materials and Methods Three patients with histologically confirmed evidence of <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> were examined with MR imaging. MR imaging was performed with a Picker prototype superconducting magnet operating at 0. 15 T (6. 5 MHz). Inversion-recovery and spin-echo (SE) pulse sequences were used as described previously [3].

40|$|Proliferating {{cells in}} <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> (<b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> cells) share many {{structural}} and immunophenotypic features with Langerhans cells, {{leading to the}} assumption that histiocytosis represents a proliferative disorder or Langerhans cells. Because, depending on their state of activation and/or differentiation, Langerhans cells exhibit a varying immunophenotype, we investigated whether <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> cells display a similar phenotypic heterogeneity and, if so, whether the heterogenous biological behavior of <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> is reflected by differences in the immunophenotype of the proliferating Cells. In 21 patients suffering from different clinical manifestations of <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X,</b> proliferating cells uniformly expressed class I and II alloantigens, T 200, CD 1, CD 4, and S 100 protein. In 12 of 21 cases, <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> cells additionally exhibited immunocytochemically detectable amounts of C 3 b and C 3 bi receptors and certain monocyte/macrophage antigens (CDw 14, Ki-Mi, Ki-M 6). This immunophenotypic heterogeneity of <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> cells could not be correlated with clinical course, prognosis, and final outcome of the disease in a given patient.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the secretory function of cell suspensions from bone eosinophilic granulomas surgically collected in two patients with <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X.</b> Unseparated cell preparations spontaneously produced interleukin 1 (IL- 1) and prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2).

Such highly purified cell preparations were found to secrete IL- 1 and PGE 2 spontaneously in culture. Stimulation with endotoxins and treatment with interferon gamma (IFN gamma) revealed an intense IL- 1 secretory function of <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> cells. Since both IL- 1 and PGE 2 are able to induce bone resorption in vitro, our findings are compatible with the hypothesis that <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> cells are responsible for the typical osteolytic lesion observed in <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> through the local secretion of these two mediators...|$|R

40|$|There {{exists a}} rarely {{observed}} association between pulmonary <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> and bronchopulmonary cancer. However, {{the frequency of}} bronchopulmonary cancer in these patients is {{higher than in the}} general population. A 28 -year-old patient who currently smokes ten packs of cigarettes a year came to our department of pneumology with complains of cough and hemoptysis. An x-ray of the thorax revealed bilateral cysts and a shadow in {{the upper part of the}} right pulmonary field. In addition, a chest tomography showed multiple cysts dispersed throughout the two pulmonary fields and an irregular mass with a diameter of four centimetres in the upper right lobe. Bronchopulmonary adenocarcinoma was diagnosed during a cytologic exam of the bronchial washing. We decided to perform a thoracotomy on the patient, since there was no far metastasis. An upper lobectomy and wedge resection of the upper segment of the lower right lobe, which had been invaded by the tumour, were performed. Histology confirmed the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma. A pulmonary biopsy was carried out on the tumour-free site and showed the presence of <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X.</b> There is a hypothesis that a neoplasm developed on the pulmonary fibrosis could be an epiphenomenon of bronchopulmonary cancer in patients who smoke and have pulmonary <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X.</b> It is interesting to note that <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> and bronchopulmonary cancer were diagnosed at the same time, since the bronchopulmonary cancer may have occurred within a few years following the diagnosis of <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X,</b> even if she was a smoker. Hemoptysis, which is found in 5 % of patients with <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X,</b> may suggest cancer. This young patient, a smoker, who complained of hemoptysis, is a particularly rare case of the association between pulmonary <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> and bronchopulmonary cancer whose pathogenesis is not clear cut. It is thus important to note that smoking can have major consequences, even in young people...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Pulmonary <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> is a {{disorder}} characterised {{by the presence}} of destructive granulomas preferentially involving distal bronchioles, that contain numerous activated Langerhans' cells. Recent studies have shown that granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), which is produced by normal bronchiolar epithelium, may play an important part in the distribution and differentiation of Langerhans' cells. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the role of this factor in the pathogenesis of pulmonary <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X.</b> METHODS: Four patients with pulmonary <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> were examined by immunohistochemical techniques for GM-CSF and CD 1 a surface molecules. RESULTS: In early lesions the epithelium of bronchioles affected by the disease was strongly positive for GM-CSF and infiltrated by numerous CD 1 a+ Langerhans' cells organised into granulomas. In contrast, the expression of GM-CSF was substantially lower in bronchioles not affected by the disease, and these bronchioles contained few Langerhans' cells. When destruction by <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> lesions was more advanced, only remnants of bronchiolar epithelium could occasionally be identified; these remained strongly reactive for GM-CSF. Langerhans' cells within granulomas also moderately expressed this cytokine. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the hypothesis that GM-CSF could be one of the factors responsible for the local accumulation of lymphostimulatory Langerhans' cells in early lesions of pulmonary <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X...</b>|$|R

40|$|Based on {{the finding}} that Langerhans cells and <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> cells react with the {{monoclonal}} antibody OKT 6, raised against a subset of thymocytes, we used this antibody to study the cells collected by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) from 131 patients, including 18 with pulmonary <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X,</b> 43 with pulmonary sarcoidosis, 67 with miscellaneous pulmonary disorders, and 3 controls. Immunofluorescence studies demonstrated the presence of OKT 6 -reactive cells in all patients with pulmonary <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> (mean +/- SEM, 5. 29 % +/- 1. 14 % of all cells in BAL fluid). Immunoelectron microscopic studies revealed that the cells labeled in these patients (n = 13) contained Langerhans granules. The number of fluorescent cells in the other 113 patients was significantly smaller (mean +/- SEM, 0. 20 % +/- 0. 04 % of all cells; P less than 0. 001). In the 3 control patients, in the 43 patients with sarcoidosis, and in 61 of the 67 patients with miscellaneous disorders unrelated to <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X,</b> no cells or less than 1 % of the total were labeled; however, in the 6 remaining patients in this miscellaneous group, 1. 3 to 2. 8 % of all cells in BAL were labeled.

40|$|Distinction between <b>acute</b> <b>disseminated</b> {{encephalomyelitis}} and <b>acute</b> {{multiple sclerosis}} is often clinically difficult. Perivenous demyelination is the pathological hallmark of <b>acute</b> <b>disseminated</b> encephalomyelitis, whereas confluent demyelination is {{the hallmark of}} acute multiple sclerosis. We investigated whether perivenous demyelination versus confluent demyelination distinguishes <b>acute</b> <b>disseminated</b> encephalomyelitis from multiple sclerosis. Patients with perivenous demyelination (n = 13; median age 43 years, range 5 – 67) on brain biopsy and/or autopsy, ascertained retrospectively, were compared with a cohort with confluent demyelination only (n = 91; 84 % multiple sclerosis, 16 % isolated syndrome at follow-up; median age 39 years, range 10 – 69). Clinical presentation, course and the International Paediatric Multiple Sclerosis Study Group clinical criteria for <b>acute</b> <b>disseminated</b> encephalomyelitis were assessed in both cohorts. Among the perivenous demyelination cohort, 10 patients had only perivenous demyelination and three also had confluent demyelination. All but one patient with perivenous demyelination only had a monophasic course, whereas two of three with both types had a relapsing course. The perivenous demyelination cohort was more likely than the confluent demyelination cohort to present with encephalopathy (P < 0. 001), depressed level of consciousness (P < 0. 001), headache (P < 0. 001), meningismus (P = 0. 04), cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis (P = 0. 04) or multifocal enhancing magnetic resonance imaging lesions (P < 0. 001). A distinct pattern of cortical microglial activation and aggregation without associated cortical demyelination was found among six perivenous demyelination patients, all of whom had encephalopathy and four of whom had depressed level of consciousness. This pattern of cortical pathology was not observed in the confluent demyelination cohort, even in one patient with depressed level of consciousness. Clinical criteria were 80 % sensitive and 91 % specific for pathologically defined <b>acute</b> <b>disseminated</b> encephalomyelitis (perivenous demyelination), but misdiagnosed <b>acute</b> <b>disseminated</b> encephalomyelitis among 9 % of patients with confluent demyelination and multiple sclerosis diagnosis at last follow-up.
