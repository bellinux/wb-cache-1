In 898, John IX (898—900) also nullified the Cadaver Synod, convening two synods (one in Rome, one in Ravenna) which confirmed the findings of Theodore II's synod, ordered the acta of the Cadaver Synod destroyed, excommunicated seven cardinals {{who were involved in}} the Cadaver Synod, and prohibited any future trial of <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> <b>person.</b>|$|E

25|$|Following Diana's death, the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund {{was granted}} {{intellectual}} property rights over her image. In 1998, the fund sued the Franklin Mint, accusing it of illegally selling Diana dolls, plates, and jewellery after having been refused a license to do so. In California, where the initial case was tried, a suit to preserve the right of publicity may be filed on behalf of <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> <b>person,</b> but only if that person is a Californian. The Memorial Fund therefore filed the lawsuit {{on behalf of the}} estate and, upon losing the case, was required to pay the Franklin Mint's legal costs of £3million which, combined with other fees, caused the Memorial Fund to freeze its grants to charities. In 2003, the Franklin Mint counter-sued. In November 2004, the case was settled out of court with the Memorial Fund agreeing to pay £13.5 million (US$21.5 million) to charitable causes on which both sides agreed. In addition to this, the Memorial Fund had spent a total of close to £4 million (US$6.5 million) in costs and fees relating to this litigation, and as a result froze grants allocated to a number of charities.|$|E

500|$|According to his {{original}} introduction, Kwee {{was inspired to}} write the novel after hearing his daughter singing Charles Ridgewell and Will Godwin's [...] "If Those Lips Could Only Speak" [...] (identified by Kwee as [...] "Mimi d'Amour"). He {{was struck by the}} melancholic lyrics and decided to write a [...] "sad story or stage play" [...] based on it. However, he did not begin the writing process until February 1927, when the Union Dalia Opera requested permission to perform his earlier work Allah jang Palsoe (A False God; 1919). As he considered the work too difficult for the native troupe, he began writing an original outline for their performance, based on his musings. Union Dalia performed Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang on 5 March 1927, using an outline Kwee had written; the novel was not completed until 20 April. During a conversation with fellow writer Khouw Sin Eng, Kwee said that part of the story had been based on William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, particularly the appearance of <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> <b>person</b> coming back to life.|$|E

[...] Depp said of the character, [...] "He makes Sid Vicious look like the innocent paper boy. He's beyond dark. He's already dead. He's been dead for years." [...] Depp also commented on the streak of white in Todd's hair, saying, [...] "The idea was that he'd had this hideous trauma, from being sent away, locked away. That streak of white hair became the shock of that rage. It represented his rage over what had happened. It's certainly {{not the first time}} anyone's used it. But it's effective. It tells a story all by itself. My brother had a white spot growing up, and his son has this kind of shock of white in his hair." ...|$|E
500|$|A special {{interview}} with Ohkawa and Kiichiro Sugawara, Clamp's editor from the Weekly Shōnen Magazines Editorial Department, took {{place after the}} story of Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle had progressed past the arc from Ōto Country. Ohkawa has stated that the group is very conscious {{of the fact that}} Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle is the title in Shōnen Magazine with the youngest readership and that it is their very first foray into the shōnen demographic. Thus, the members of Clamp ensure that they employ a drawing style and dialogue appropriate for young male audiences; the manga incorporates furigana that makes reading Japanese easier. To aid in this effort, the group holds conferences with Sugawara where they discuss the plot. Ohkawa stated during the interview that the only time the story significantly changed was during Country of Jade arc; It went from a [...] "horror story with vampires" [...] to a [...] "detective mystery". Following the story in the Piffle Country, Clamp aimed to make the series darker and more complex, resulting in it receiving elements previously seen in other of their series. The Shura Country's story was written to introduce the idea that <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> <b>person</b> cannot be revived even if somebody travels back to the past and changes history. This theme would be further explored later in the story.|$|E

500|$|Andrew Hanson {{from the}} Los Angeles Times thought the [...] "premise {{was a little}} thinly {{stretched}} over the hour" [...] and believed {{it would have been}} overshadowed by stronger episodes in season one, but was glad to have another hour of Fringe regardless. SFScope contributor Sarah Stegall disliked that the network failed to issue a [...] "disclaimer" [...] about the episode's production date, stating [...] "...maybe the producers assume that all their audiences are brand new to the franchise. Or perhaps, unhappily, it is a sign that Fox has given up on this show, and no longer cares whether its lingering audience is confused." [...] She concluded, [...] "As a standalone episode, this one was of middling interest, and I can see why Fox would have dropped it from the Season One lineup. Fans looking eagerly for more 'mythology' episodes, where the links between the Fringe team, Massive Dynamics, Nina Sharpe, William Bell and, for all I know, the Illuminati are explored, may be disappointed." [...] Jane Boursaw of AOL TV was also critical of Fox for giving no warning about the episode and thought it should actually have been titled 'Walter vs. The Priest.'" [...] She continued, [...] "The whole episode was an interesting intersect between science and faith, not to mention the whole 'being possessed by <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> <b>person</b> because your brain waves crossed during life and death' thing. You can tell it was vintage Fringe -- if indeed it was -- because the storylines are more complex than that these days, what with the alternate universe and Leonard Nimoy and all." [...] Various critics noted guest actress Alice Kremelberg's performance, particularly when she had to give the impression she was possessed by a male ghost; most reviews were negative, though Boursaw praised it, giving Kremelberg [...] "high fives".|$|E
500|$|Initially, {{the game}} was more free-form, {{allowing}} players to purchase new powers at any point during the game, but the developers {{found it difficult to}} create a challenging game on that basis, particularly as they could not design missions calling for specific powers that the player may not have at that time. This evolved into the scheme of presenting new powers to the player {{over the course of the}} game, with the developers created guiding rules for which powers were ultimately included in the game and when: the power had to be useful and add something unique to the game, the player would need a chance to use that power immediately after they got it, and the power would need to be enjoyable to use. The team employed frequent reviews of when these powers were introduced to the player as other gameplay elements were added to the game. Not all powers were necessarily offensive; the [...] "postcognition" [...] power, allowing the player to see the psychic echo of <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> <b>person</b> of where they were before their death, was added as the team found there was an element of fun in tracking the echo through the crowded city. Some powers were cut from the game. One power, gained through the Evil karma path, was called [...] "Minionize", and would have allowed Cole to control the minds of civilians and force them to join him in battle. Although the power was [...] "decidedly evil and very fun to watch", the team felt it wasn't useful to the game, though they managed to retain a hint of it in one of the Evil side missions. Though the team had tested each of the core missions individually with the powers that the player would have based on the game's storyboard, they found that play-testers, who played the missions back-to-back, found the game lacked a variety of combat situations. The developers revisited all the combat scenarios from this feedback to alter the combat layouts as well as adding new enemies, a step that Bridges believes the game [...] "benefited greatly" [...] from. The ability to use Cole's electrical powers to ride along Empire City's elevated train rails was a last-minute addition during the last month of development based on a play-tester's suggestion.|$|E
