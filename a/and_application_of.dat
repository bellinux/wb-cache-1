5|$|The Court of Justice was {{to ensure}} the {{observation}} of ECSC law along with the interpretation <b>and</b> <b>application</b> <b>of</b> the Treaty. The Court was composed of seven judges, appointed by common accord of the national governments for six years. There were no requirements that the judges had to be of a certain nationality, simply that they be qualified and that their independence be beyond doubt. The Court was assisted by two Advocates General.|$|E

The American Academy of Industrial Hygiene Council awarded her the Henry F. Smyth Jr. Award in 1984 for identifying and fulfilling research needs within the industrial hygiene profession. In 1986 she received the Inhalation Section of the Career Achievement Award from the Society of Toxicology. She received the Herbert E. Stockinger Award from the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists in 1989 In 1988 she gained, the Mid-Atlantic Section, Society of Toxicology Ambassador Award. Then in 1997, she was awarded the Merit Award from the same society, in celebration of her achievements throughout her life and her contributions to Toxicology.|$|E
5|$|Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB) is {{an annual}} {{academic}} {{conference on the}} subjects of bioinformatics and computational biology organised by the International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB). The principal focus of the conference is on the development <b>and</b> <b>application</b> <b>of</b> advanced computational methods for biological problems. The conference has been held every year since 1993 and has grown {{to become one of}} the largest and most prestigious meetings in these fields, hosting over 2,000 delegates in 2004. From the first meeting, ISMB has been held in locations worldwide; since 2007, meetings have been located in Europe and North America in alternating years. Since 2004, European meetings have been held jointly with the European Conference on Computational Biology (ECCB).|$|E

40|$|Physics <b>and</b> <b>applications</b> <b>of</b> {{atmospheric}} {{nonlinear optics}} and filamentation KASPARIAN, Jérôme, WOLF, Jean-Pierre We review the properties <b>and</b> <b>applications</b> <b>of</b> ultrashort laser pulses in the atmosphere, {{with a particular}} focus on filamentation. Filamentation is a non-linear propagation regime specific of ultrashort and ultraintense laser pulses in the atmosphere. Typical applications include remote sensing of atmospheric gases and aerosols, lightning control, laser-induced spectroscopy, coherent anti-stokes Raman scattering, and the generation of sub-THz radiation.

5|$|References to interpreters {{indicate}} the continuing use of local languages other than Greek and Latin, particularly in Egypt, where Coptic predominated, and in military settings along the Rhine and Danube. Roman jurists also show {{a concern for}} local languages such as Punic, Gaulish, and Aramaic in assuring the correct understanding <b>and</b> <b>application</b> <b>of</b> laws and oaths. In the province of Africa, Libyco-Berber and Punic were used in inscriptions and for legends on coins {{during the time of}} Tiberius (1st century AD). Libyco-Berber and Punic inscriptions appear on public buildings into the 2nd century, some bilingual with Latin. In Syria, Palmyrene soldiers even used their dialect of Aramaic for inscriptions, in a striking exception to the rule that Latin was the language of the military.|$|E
5|$|Richard E. Smalley, {{a chemist}} at Rice University, {{was best known}} as a co-discoverer of the C60 form of carbon known as buckminsterfullerine in 1985, along with Harry Kroto, Robert Curl, James Heath, and Sean O'Brien. Buckminsterfullerene was the first to be {{discovered}} of the class of molecules known as fullerenes, which also includes carbon nanotubes. The study <b>and</b> <b>application</b> <b>of</b> fullerenes forms {{a significant part of the}} fields of nanomaterials and nanoelectronics, and Smalley, Kroto, and Curl were awarded the 1996 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their discovery.|$|E
5|$|Silicon nitride {{remained}} {{merely a}} chemical curiosity for decades {{before it was}} used in commercial applications. From 1948 to 1952, the Carborundum Company, Niagara Falls, New York, applied for several patents on the manufacture <b>and</b> <b>application</b> <b>of</b> silicon nitride. By 1958 Haynes (Union Carbide) silicon nitride was in commercial production for thermocouple tubes, rocket nozzles, and boats and crucibles for melting metals. British work on silicon nitride, started in 1953, was aimed at high-temperature parts of gas turbines and resulted {{in the development of}} reaction-bonded silicon nitride and hot-pressed silicon nitride. In 1971, the Advanced Research Project Agency of the US Department of Defense placed a US$17million contract with Ford and Westinghouse for two ceramic gas turbines.|$|E

5|$|This {{approach}} {{coupled with}} the new Linnaean system of binomial nomenclature resulted in plant encyclopaedias without medicinal information called Floras that meticulously described and illustrated the plants growing in particular regions. The 17th century also {{marked the beginning of}} experimental botany <b>and</b> <b>application</b> <b>of</b> a rigorous scientific method, while improvements in the microscope launched the new discipline of plant anatomy whose foundations, laid by the careful observations of Englishman Nehemiah Grew and Italian Marcello Malpighi, would last for 150 years.|$|E
5|$|TransÉnergie uses series {{compensation}} {{to alter the}} way electricity behaves in power transmission lines, which improves the electricity transmission efficiency. This reduces the need to construct new power lines and increases the amount of electric power sent to population centres. Series compensation is based on capacitor technology. To maintain its transmission system performance, TransÉnergie sets aside funds for research <b>and</b> <b>application</b> <b>of</b> new technologies. In addition to power transmission technology, Hydro-Québec plans to offer high-speed internet over its transmission lines within a few years; the utility started testing internet over its lines in January 2004.|$|E
