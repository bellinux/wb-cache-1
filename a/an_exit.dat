5|$|Historically, {{especially}} aggressive rams {{were sometimes}} blindfolded or hobbled. Today, those who keep rams typically prefer softer preventative measures, such as moving within a clear line to <b>an</b> <b>exit,</b> never turning their {{back on a}} ram, and possibly dousing with water or a diluted solution of bleach or vinegar to dissuade charges.|$|E

5|$|Past Route 3, {{the highway}} narrows to four lanes, {{continuing}} east-northeast as a limited-access divided highway with some RIRO-accessed businesses still on it, though many roads are accessed through over and underpasses. US 46 has <b>an</b> <b>exit</b> for Van Houten Avenue/Grove Street {{before coming to}} a large interchange with Route 19/CR 509 and the Garden State Parkway. After this, the road passes over the New Jersey Transit Main Line and has <b>an</b> <b>exit</b> for Hazel Street/Paulison Avenue. After the exit, US 46 begins a brief concurrence with Piaget Avenue in Clifton {{with a series of}} connector streets and three intersections controlled by stoplights. After the third, at Day Street near Christopher Columbus Middle School, the two roads split at a fork, marked as <b>an</b> <b>exit,</b> with US 46 continuing eastbound to the left and Piaget Avenue continuing to the right. Vehicles traveling west on Piaget Avenue have access to US 46 West through use of a one way underpass that carries US 46 East over it, and also have access to US 46 East by a right-turn only lane near the intersection of Piaget Avenue and Fourth Street.|$|E

5|$|Actual {{planning}} for I-359 commenced in 1961, and by 1971, the Alabama Department of Transportation (ALDOT) announced that federal funding would be sought for its construction. Planning for the corridor continued throughout the 1970s, only to stall briefly due to complications with the required {{environmental impact assessment}} associated with the project. By 1976, it was announced I-359 would have <b>an</b> <b>exit</b> both at 35th Street and 15th Street to improve access to both the University of Alabama and Stillman College.|$|E

5|$|After {{one block}} of Main Street, NY32 and NY212 turn onto Market Street, then east onto Ulster Avenue after another block. As it crosses the {{railroad}} tracks and leaves the village, the road widens and becomes a commercial highway just before reaching a Thruway exit. This, the fourth time NY32 has crossed the Thruway, {{is the first time}} it does so at <b>an</b> <b>exit.</b> Beyond the overpass, the concurrency ends when NY32 turns and heads north once again. A tight nearby on-ramp provides access to the southbound Thruway. NY32 does not enter the Catskills but provides access to them along this stretch.|$|E
5|$|By 1966, Reynolds {{had grown}} weary of touring and Stewart wanted {{to strike out}} on his own as a singer-songwriter, so the three musicians and Werber {{developed}} <b>an</b> <b>exit</b> strategy of playing as many dates as possible for a year with an endpoint determined to be a final two-week engagement at the Hungry i in June 1967. The group followed this strategy successfully, and on June 17, 1967, the Kingston Trio ceased to be an actively performing band.|$|E
5|$|During the Lebanese Civil War and the Israeli {{occupation}} of South Lebanon (1985–2000), the temple site was neglected and was invaded by vegetation overgrowth; it was cleared and recovered its former condition after the Israeli withdrawal.

5|$|In 1997, Governor Christine Todd Whitman {{approved}} the project, and construction began on November 4, 1998. After {{construction on the}} freeway began, Wynn's interests were purchased by MGM Grand Inc., thus creating the MGM Mirage company, and plans for Le Jardin were canceled. Despite the fact that Le Jardin was canceled and MGM Mirage's new casino, Borgata, was not scheduled to open until 2003, Trump still fought against the project's plans to build the exit directly to the new casino. Eventually, in January 2000, Trump dropped his case after <b>an</b> <b>exit</b> ramp leading to the Trump Marina {{was added to the}} project.|$|E
5|$|In this county, {{the road}} {{continues}} southeast to Somerset and an interchange with PA601 accessing US219 and Johnstown. East of Somerset the highway reaches Allegheny Mountain, going under {{it in the}} Allegheny Mountain Tunnel. Exiting the tunnel, the turnpike winds down the mountain at a three-percent grade, which is the steepest grade on the turnpike, and heads into Bedford County, passing through a valley. At Bedford, <b>an</b> <b>exit</b> for US220Business (US220Bus.) provides access to US220 and the southern terminus of I-99; this exit also serves Altoona to the north.|$|E
5|$|London Underground's Charing Cross tube {{station on}} the Northern and Bakerloo lines has <b>an</b> <b>exit</b> in the square.

5|$|On {{the other}} side of the bridge in the town of Webster, NY104 has exits leading to Bay Road, Five Mile Line Road, Hard Road, and Holt Road prior to {{entering}} the village of Webster. Within the village, NY104 meets NY250 (North Avenue) and Phillips Road by way of interchanges before exiting the village. The expressway loosely parallels the southern edge of the primary Xerox campus to <b>an</b> <b>exit</b> with Salt Road, where it downgrades to a divided highway as it continues east to Basket Road and the Monroe–Wayne county line, partially delimited by NY404.|$|E
5|$|Portal is a single-player first-person action/puzzle {{game that}} was first {{available}} {{as part of}} The Orange Box.

The portal system and the unusual physics it creates are the emphasis of this game. Portal was a surprise favorite of The Orange Box, receiving widespread praise and several Game of the Year awards.|$|E

50|$|By November 2012, a {{complete}} {{reconstruction of the}} Mitchell Interchange was completed. Several former movements changed after completion. Northbound I-94 to westbound I-894/I-43 changed from <b>a</b> left-hand <b>exit</b> bridge to <b>a</b> right-hand <b>exit</b> tunnel under I-94. Collector-distributor lanes were added along both sides of I-94 from College Avenue to South 13th Street.

5|$|Route 3 {{crosses the}} Passaic River {{on a fixed}} bridge, which {{replaced}} a double-leaf trunnion bascule bridge in 2013, into Rutherford, Bergen County. Just after crossing the river, the route interchanges with County Route 507 (Riverside Avenue). The freeway continues through a residential area and comes to <b>an</b> <b>exit</b> that provides access to southbound Route 17. Past this interchange, Route 3 is closely paralleled by Route 17 to the south until Route 3 interchanges again with Route 17, which continues {{to the north of}} Route 3.|$|E
5|$|SR56 meets Carmel Valley Road and curves northward, passing Canyon Crest Academy {{before turning}} southeastward.
