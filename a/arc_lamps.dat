5|$|Thorium was {{discovered}} in 1828; its first application came in 1885, when Austrian chemist Carl Auer von Welsbach invented the gas mantle, a portable source of light which produces light from the incandescence of thorium oxide when heated by burning gaseous fuels. After that, many applications were found for thorium and its compounds, including ceramics, carbon <b>arc</b> <b>lamps,</b> heat-resistant crucibles, and as catalysts for industrial chemical reactions such as the oxidation of ammonia to nitric acid.|$|E

5|$|Apart from Bank, {{which was}} {{completely}} below ground, all stations had buildings designed by Harry Bell Measures. They were single-storey structures {{to allow for}} future commercial development above and had elevations faced in beige terracotta. Each station had lifts manufactured by the Sprague Electric Company in New York. The lifts were provided {{in a variety of}} sizes and configurations to suit the passenger flow at each station. Generally they operated in sets of two or three in a shared shaft. Station tunnel walls were finished in plain white ceramic tiles and lit by electric <b>arc</b> <b>lamps.</b> The electricity to run the trains and the stations was supplied from the power station at Wood Lane at 5,000V AC which was converted at sub-stations along the route to 550V DC to power the trains via a third rail system.|$|E
5|$|The mission {{plan called}} for a landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, at 121:28 mission elapsed time. On the {{original}} plan, {{this would have been}} at 7:44 UTC on September 4, 1983, before accounting for the last-minute launch delay; in the event, this was put back by one day to allow for further communications testing, and Challenger touched down at 07:40:33 UTC (00:40:33 PDT), September 5, 1983, on Runway 22 at Edwards AFB, {{on the morning of the}} seventh day of the mission. As with the launch, this was the first night landing of the program. The Shuttle orbiters had no on-board lights, due to the difficulty of designing landing lights to survive re-entry, and so the runway was lit by high-intensity xenon <b>arc</b> <b>lamps</b> to guide the orbiter in. There was no pressing operational requirement for a night landing, but there was a desire to prove it was possible. Footage of the landing was shown in the 1986 film SpaceCamp.|$|E

25|$|A {{variation}} of the incandescent lamp did not use a hot wire filament, but instead used an arc struck on a spherical bead electrode to produce heat. The electrode then became incandescent, with the arc contributing little to the light produced. Such lamps were used for projection or illumination for scientific instruments such as microscopes. These <b>arc</b> <b>lamps</b> ran on relatively low voltages and incorporated tungsten filaments to start ionization within the envelope. They provided the intense concentrated light of an arc lamp but were easier to operate. Developed around 1915, these lamps were displaced by mercury and xenon <b>arc</b> <b>lamps.</b>|$|E

25|$|Fluorescent {{tubes are}} long, low-luminance sources {{compared}} with high pressure <b>arc</b> <b>lamps,</b> incandescent lamps and LEDs.

25|$|Carbon <b>arc</b> <b>lamps</b> {{were started}} by making contact between two carbon electrodes, {{which were then}} {{separated}} to within a narrow gap. Because the carbon burned away, the gap had to be constantly readjusted. Several mechanisms were developed to regulate the arc.

5000|$|In popular use, {{the term}} <b>arc</b> <b>lamp</b> means carbon <b>arc</b> <b>lamp</b> only. In a carbon <b>arc</b> <b>lamp,</b> the {{electrodes}} are carbon rods in free air. To ignite the lamp, the rods are touched together, thus allowing {{a relatively low}} voltage to strike the arc. [...] The rods are then slowly drawn apart, and electric current heats and maintains an arc across the gap. The tips of the carbon rods are heated and the carbon vaporizes. The carbon vapor in the arc is highly luminous, which is what produces the bright light. [...] The rods are slowly burnt away in use, and {{the distance between them}} needs to be regularly adjusted {{in order to maintain the}} arc.|$|R
