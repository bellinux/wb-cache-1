5|$|In {{the major}} MRT {{disruption}} of 15 December 2011, one C151 train (trainset 067/068, T139 in the COI) was stalled {{in the tunnel}} and its backup battery failed. The passenger compartments in T139 experienced a blackout and loss of ventilation, leading to one passenger smashing a train door window to avoid suffocation. The battery failure led to criticism by the COI {{on the condition of}} the aging emergency batteries installed on all C151 trains. SMRT has since proposed an upgrading plan to <b>address</b> <b>this</b> <b>issue.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Sea Dart {{began as}} Convair's entry in a 1948 U.S. Navy contest for a {{supersonic}} interceptor aircraft. During the time, {{there was much}} skepticism about operating supersonic aircraft from carrier decks. So in order to <b>address</b> <b>this</b> <b>issue,</b> U.S. Navy ordered many subsonic fighters. The worry had some foundation, since many supersonic designs of the time required long takeoff rolls, had high approach speeds, and were not very stable or easy to controlâ€”all factors that were troublesome on a carrier.|$|E

5|$|Some {{challenges}} faced in international emergency medicine include immature or non-existent training programs, {{a lack of}} adequate emergency transport, a shortage of resources to fund emergency medicine development, and an absence of research that could inform developing countries how to best spend the resources they devote to emergency medicine. Additionally, the standards and methods used in countries with mature EMSs are not always suited for use in developing countries {{due to a lack}} of infrastructure, shortage of funds, or local demographics. Ambulances, the developed country standard, are costly and not practical for the road conditions present in many countries; instead, a variety of modes of transportation are used. Furthermore, in place of expensive medication and equipment, developing countries often opt for cheaper if slightly less effective alternatives. Although it may seem that increasing availability to emergency medicine must improve health, there is little empirical evidence to directly support that claim or to point out which methods are most effective in improving patient health. Evidence-based medicine seeks to <b>address</b> <b>this</b> <b>issue</b> by rigorously studying the effects of different interventions instead of relying on logic or tradition.|$|E

25|$|Magnet reliability: Superconducting magnets are {{generally}} {{used to generate}} the powerful magnetic fields to levitate and propel the trains.

25|$|The {{multidisciplinary}} {{nature of}} the branch can result in technical challenges, since tools and solutions {{from each of the}} individual disciplines involved may behave slightly differently, be optimized for different hard- and software platforms and use different data formats.

Kingsgate survived the bombings of World War II, although it was slightly damaged in April 1942, when the bridge leading to the gate was hit by aerial bombardment.

40|$|Anecdotes {{suggest that}} tourism {{may play a}} role in the {{decision}} of retirees to migrate. This paper reviews the literature to determining if research supports the anecdotal evidence. Much of the literature on retiree migration only superficially <b>addresses</b> <b>this</b> <b>issue,</b> and thus cannot be viewed as definitive. This literature does not suggest a strong link between tourism and later migration decisions. There is a small body of research that directly specifically <b>addresses</b> <b>this</b> <b>issue.</b> <b>This</b> research is carefully designed, based on a migration decision-making framework. It does show that tourism experiences have an impact at several stages in the decision process. Tourism experiences are used both to identify and eliminate potential locations. ...|$|R

25|$|When a {{large number}} of local semi-independent {{computing}} nodes are used (e.g. in a cluster architecture) the speed and flexibility of the interconnect becomes very important. Modern supercomputers have taken different approaches to <b>address</b> <b>this</b> <b>issue,</b> e.g. Tianhe-1 uses a proprietary high-speed network based on the Infiniband QDR, enhanced with FeiTeng-1000 CPUs. On the other hand, the Blue Gene/L system uses a three-dimensional torus interconnect with auxiliary networks for global communications. In this approach each node is connected to its six nearest neighbors. A similar torus was used by the Cray T3E.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes, the {{structure}} of sentiments and topics is fairly complex. Also, the problem of sentiment analysis is non-monotonic in respect to sentence extension and stop-word substitution (compare THEY would not let my dog stay in this hotel vs I would not let my dog stay in this hotel). To <b>address</b> <b>this</b> <b>issue</b> a number of rule-based and reasoning-based approaches have been applied to sentiment analysis, including defeasible logic programming. Also, there is a number of tree traversal rules applied to syntactic parse tree to extract the topicality of sentiment in open domain setting.|$|E

The reliability of the C-5 fleet has been a continued issue throughout its lifetime, however the C-5M upgrade program seeks in part to <b>address</b> <b>this</b> <b>issue.</b> Their strategic airlift capacity has been a key logistical component of U.S. military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. Following an incident during Operation Iraqi Freedom where one C-5 was damaged by a projectile, the installation of defensive systems has become a stated priority.|$|E
25|$|One major {{drawback}} of the Levins {{model is}} that it is deterministic, whereas the fundamental metapopulation processes are stochastic. Metapopulations are particularly useful when discussing species in disturbed habitats, and the viability of their populations, i.e., how likely they are to become extinct in a given time interval. The Levins model cannot <b>address</b> <b>this</b> <b>issue.</b> A simple way to extend the Levins' model to incorporate space and stochastic considerations is by using the contact process. Simple modifications to this model can also incorporate for patch dynamics. At a given percolation threshold, habitat fragmentation effects take place in these configurations predicting more drastic extinction thresholds.|$|E
25|$|One {{can also}} study {{sufficiently}} simplified models for which computers {{can be used}} to carry out calculations and see if a procedure suggested by perturbation theory may work beyond it. The second concept allows one {{to address the issue of}} defining a relativistic theory ab initio without limiting the definition to perturbative expansions. This option is particularly relevant to the issue of describing bound states in QCD. However, to <b>address</b> <b>this</b> <b>issue</b> one needs to overcome certain difficulties that the renormalization group procedures based on the idea of reduction of cutoffs are not capable of easily resolving. To avoid the difficulties, one can employ the similarity renormalization group procedure. Both the difficulties and similarity are explained in the next section.|$|E
