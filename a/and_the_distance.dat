5|$|Electronegativity is the {{tendency}} of an atom to attract electrons. An atom's electronegativity is affected by both its atomic number <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> between the valence electrons and the nucleus. The higher its electronegativity, the more an element attracts electrons. It was first proposed by Linus Pauling in 1932. In general, electronegativity increases on passing {{from left to right}} along a period, and decreases on descending a group. Hence, fluorine is the most electronegative of the elements, while caesium is the least, at least of those elements for which substantial data is available.|$|E

This book {{mentions}} the heliocentric theory {{of the solar system}} proposed by Aristarchus of Samos, as well as contemporary ideas {{about the size of the}} Earth <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> between various celestial bodies. By using a system of numbers based on powers of the myriad, Archimedes concludes that {{the number of}} grains of sand required to fill the universe is 8 in modern notation. The introductory letter states that Archimedes' father was an astronomer named Phidias. The Sand Reckoner or Psammites is the only surviving work in which Archimedes discusses his views on astronomy.|$|E

5|$|The {{method of}} Foucault replaces the {{cogwheel}} by a rotating mirror.

Von Neumann oversaw computations related to the expected size of the bomb blasts, estimated death tolls, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> above the ground at which the bombs should be detonated for optimum shock wave propagation and thus maximum effect. The cultural capital Kyoto, which had been spared the bombing inflicted upon militarily significant cities, was von Neumann's first choice, a selection seconded by Manhattan Project leader General Leslie Groves. However, this target was dismissed by Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson.|$|E
5|$|During {{the debate}} on the bill, New York's Francis B. Cutting demanded that Breckinridge retract or explain a {{statement}} he had made, which Breckinridge understood as a challenge to duel. Under the code duello, the challenged party selected the weapons <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> between combatants; Breckinridge chose rifles at 60 paces and suggested the duel be held in Silver Spring, Maryland, on his friend, Francis Preston Blair's estate. Cutting had not meant his remark as a challenge, but insisted that he was now challenged and selected pistols at 10 paces. While their representatives tried to clarify matters, Breckinridge and Cutting made amends, averting the duel. Had it taken place, Breckinridge could have been removed from the House; the 1850 Kentucky Constitution prevented duelists from holding office.|$|E

5|$|Electrostatic forces between {{particles}} are strongest when {{the charges are}} high, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> between the nuclei of the ions is small. In such cases, the compounds generally have very high melting and boiling points and a low vapour pressure. Trends in melting points can be even better explained when the structure and ionic size ratio is taken into account. Above their melting point ionic solids melt and become molten salts (although some ionic compounds such as aluminium chloride and iron(III) chloride show molecule-like structures in the liquid phase). Inorganic compounds with simple ions typically have small ions, and thus have high melting points, so are solids at room temperature. Some substances with larger ions, however, have a melting point below or near room temperature (often defined as up to 100°C), and are termed ionic liquids. Ions in ionic liquids often have uneven charge distributions, or bulky substituents like hydrocarbon chains, which {{also play a role}} in determining the strength of the interactions and propensity to melt.|$|E
5|$|For otariids {{and some}} phocids like the harbor seal, mothers fast and nurse their pups {{for a few}} days at a time. In between nursing bouts, the females leave their young onshore to forage at sea. These {{foraging}} trips may last anywhere between a day and two weeks, depending on the abundance of food <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> of foraging sites. While their mothers are away, the pups will fast. Lactation in otariids may last 6–11 months; in the Galápagos fur seal it can last as long as 3 years. Pups of these species are weaned at lower weights than their phocid counterparts. Walruses are unique in that mothers nurse their young at sea. The female rests at the surface with its head held up, and the young suckle upside down. Young pinnipeds typically learn to swim on their own and some species can even swim at birth. Other species may wait days or weeks before entering the water. Elephant seals do not swim until weeks after they are weaned.|$|E
5|$|In 1848–49, Hippolyte Fizeau {{determined}} {{the speed of}} light between an intense light source and a mirror about 8km distant. The light source was interrupted by a rotating cogwheel with 720 notches that could be rotated at a variable speed of up to hundreds of times a second. (Figure1) Fizeau adjusted the rotation speed of the cogwheel until light passing through one notch of the cogwheel would be completely eclipsed by the adjacent tooth. Spinning the cogwheel at 3, 5 and 7 times this basic rotation rate also resulted in eclipsing of the reflected light by the cogwheel teeth next in line. Given the rotational speed of the wheel <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> between the wheel and the mirror, Fizeau was able to calculate a value of 315000km/s for {{the speed of light}}. It was difficult for Fizeau to visually estimate the intensity minimum of the light being blocked by the adjacent teeth, and his value for light's speed was about 5% too high. Fizeau's paper appeared in Comptes Rendus: Hebdomadaires de scéances de l’Academie de Sciences (Paris, Vol. 29 , pp.90–92).|$|E

5|$|It is {{a popular}} myth that {{so-called}} murder-holes– openings in {{the ceiling of the}} gateway passage– were used to pour boiling oil or molten lead on attackers; the price of oil and lead <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> of the gatehouse from fires meant that this was impractical. This method was, however, a common practice in the MENA region and the Mediterranean castles and fortifications where such resources were abundant. They were most likely used to drop objects on attackers, or to allow water to be poured on fires to extinguish them. Provision was made in the upper storey of the gatehouse for accommodation so the gate was never left undefended, although this arrangement later evolved to become more comfortable at the expense of defence.|$|E
5|$|The Saratoga {{was ordered}} to depart for home for a refit by 19 May and Somerville wanted to mount one more attack as she was leaving the Indian Ocean. He chose the naval base and oil {{refinery}} at Surabaya, Java (Operation Transom), <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> from the newly renamed East Indies Fleet's base at Ceylon required refuelling at Exmouth Gulf on the western coast of Australia before the attack. The necessity to attack from the south, across the full width of Java, meant that the target was outside the Barracuda's range and 810 and 847 Squadrons were replaced by the 18 Grumman TBF Avengers of 832 and 845 Squadrons for the mission. Early {{on the morning of}} 17 May, the ship launched all 18 Avengers, escorted by 16 Corsairs. One Avenger crashed on take-off and an American Avenger was shot down over the target; only one small ship was sunk, and little damage was done to the refinery. The Saratoga and her escorts separated after refuelling again in Exmouth Gulf and the East Indies Fleet was back in Trincomalee on 27 May where No. 21 Wing reembarked.|$|E
5|$|The {{congested}} streets <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> to the City {{from the}} stations {{to the north}} and west prompted many attempts to get parliamentary approval to build new railway lines into the City. None were successful, and the 1846 Royal Commission investigation into Metropolitan Railway Termini banned construction of new lines or stations in the built-up central area. The concept of an underground railway linking the City with the mainline termini was first proposed in the 1830s. Charles Pearson, Solicitor to the City, was a leading promoter of several schemes and in 1846 proposed a central railway station to be used by multiple railway companies. The scheme was rejected by the 1846 commission, but Pearson returned to the idea in 1852 when he helped set up the City Terminus Company to build a railway from Farringdon to King's Cross. Although the plan was supported by the City, the railway companies were not interested and the company struggled to proceed.|$|E

5|$|The {{location}} {{was not an}} easy place to defend without artillery, as the plains made surprise attacks difficult. Except for the convent itself, the terrain did not offer any natural barriers that the patriots could exploit. Nevertheless, the flat terrain was ideal for cavalry manoeuvres, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> between the church and the west gully gave enough room for a cavalry charge. The royalists, on the other hand, could support their troops with their ships from the river. Without a supporting navy, or local batteries, San Martín had no means to attack the ships. Although the small path allowed them passage to the ships, it could force the royalist forces to bottleneck during a retreat while the long range guns of the ships protected them. San Martín studied the battlefield and readied the plan for the operation during the night, when the grenadiers were hidden inside the convent.|$|E

If they fail to advance ten yards, possession of the football is turned over to the defense. In most situations, if the offense reaches their fourth down they will punt the ball to the other team, which forces them to begin their drive from further down the field; if they are in field goal range, they might also attempt to score a field goal. A group of officials, the chain crew, keeps track of both the downs <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> measurements.

5|$|An ally of Illinois' Stephen A. Douglas, Breckinridge {{supported}} {{the doctrine of}} popular sovereignty as expressed in Douglas's Kansas–Nebraska Act. He believed passage of the act would remove the issue of slavery from national politics – although it ultimately had the opposite effect – and acted as a liaison between Douglas and Pierce to secure its passage. During {{the debate on the}} House floor, New York's Francis B. Cutting, incensed by a statement that Breckinridge had made, demanded that he explain or retract it. Breckinridge interpreted Cutting's demand as a challenge to duel. Under code duello, the individual being challenged retained the right to name the weapons used <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> between the combatants; Breckinridge chose rifles at 60 paces. He also specified that the duel should be held at Silver Spring, Maryland, the home of his friend Francis Preston Blair. Cutting, who had not intended his initial remark as a challenge, believed that Breckinridge's naming of terms constituted a challenge; he chose to use pistols at a distance of 10 paces. While the two men attempted to clarify who had issued the challenge and who reserved the right to choose the terms, mutual friends resolved the issue, preventing the duel. The recently adopted Kentucky Constitution prevented anyone who participated in a duel from holding elected office, and the peaceful resolution of the issue may have saved Breckinridge's political career.|$|E
