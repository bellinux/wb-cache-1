5|$|Players {{create a}} {{character}} and travel around Sucia Island, a location Barred {{to the members}} of the player character's sect. Whilst searching for a way off the island, the game's ultimate goal, players can form alliances with the island's inhabitants and complete quests through combat or other means. Geneforge is played in 45° axonometric perspective, movement through the game's environs is real-time but switches to turn-based combat in the game's playing field. The game world is divided up into 77 areas accessible through a world map. The first two areas serve as the game's tutorial; introducing players to navigation, controls and shaping creations. Clearing areas by defeating guardians or successfully traversing the terrain allows players to bypass those areas via the world map, reducing travelling time. The game has an always-visible auto-map, which begins each area completely darkened, and is revealed as the player explores. As the player's party performs tasks or defeats enemies they receive experience, leading to increased levels and <b>additional</b> <b>skill</b> points. The player character's skill points can be used to increase their statistics or to improve their aptitude in one of the fifteen available skills. Canisters which increase skills or add new abilities are scattered throughout the game.|$|E

500|$|Heroes Never Die, an Overwatch-specific news site, {{wrote that}} Doomfist's style was wholly {{unlike that of}} the other characters, and created a [...] "feast or famine" [...] {{scenario}} in which the character is only helpful when engaged in risky, aggressive play. The site expected Doomfist's release to affect team character selections to maximize Doomfist's strengths, weaknesses, and synergies. PC Gamer praised Doomfist's balance against the other characters just prior to his launch. Professional players complimented the addition of a strong, counterable character to disrupt the common, uncounterable characters normally played in the professional circuit. Another commended the idea of fighting game-style combos in a first-person shooter for adding an <b>additional</b> <b>skill</b> ceiling for players to pursue. Kotaku, however, considered Doomfist a better fit for a Marvel vs. Capcom fighting game than Overwatch, and bemoaned the character's vulnerability to snipers, low health, and lack of escape options, which made him less threatening or even unrewarding. Even as Doomfist's design was neat, Waypoint critic thought, the character was not exciting or enough of an extrinsic motivator to reclaim players who had dropped out from its player base. Other reviewers, however, found simple joy in pulling off punches and combos.|$|E
500|$|The game {{is played}} in 45° axonometric perspective, {{movement}} through the game's environs is real-time, combat is turn-based. The game world is divided into 84 areas accessible through a world map. Clearing areas by defeating leaders or successfully traversing the terrain allows players to bypass those areas via the world map, reducing travelling time. The game uses an auto-map, each area is completely darkened and is revealed as the player explores, similar to the fog of war used in real-time strategy games. As the player completes tasks and defeats enemies they receive experience, leading to increased levels and <b>additional</b> <b>skill</b> points. The player character's skill points {{can be used to}} increase their statistics. Canisters which increase skills or add new abilities are scattered throughout the game. Geneforge 2 offers a number of changes and additions over its predecessor. Three new creations are available to players: massive Drakons; telepathic Gazers; and acidic, decaying Rotghroths. Several new spells are available, such as Kill and Aura of Flames. The skill [...] "Anatomy", which allowed the player to cause extra damage in melee combat, is replaced with [...] "Parry", which has a chance of blocking incoming attacks. Also the spell [...] "Dominate" [...] which allows the player to take control of one of the enemies is replaced with [...] "Wrack". The game engine itself, however, is essentially unchanged from the original Geneforge.|$|E

2500|$|The slide guitar, {{according}} to music educator Keith Wyatt, {{can be thought}} of as a [...] "one-finger fretless guitar". [...] The slide functions as a finger, and is a hollow tube usually fitted over the ring or little finger. The slide is pressed lightly against the strings to avoid hitting against the frets, [...] and is kept parallel with them. The frets are used only as a visual reference, and playing in tune without them requires <b>additional</b> <b>skill.</b> In this playing technique the player's remaining fingers and thumb still have access to the frets, and may be used for playing rhythmic accompaniment or reaching additional notes. [...] The guitar itself may be tuned in the traditional tuning or an open tuning. Most early blues players used open tunings, but most modern slide players use both. The major limitation of slide playing is that only one chord shape is easily available and that is dictated by how the guitar is originally tuned. Two-note intervals can be played by slanting the slide on certain notes (see photo).|$|E

For though a holy bishop thinks that agriculture will derive great advantages from the [...] "enlightened" [...] usurers who are to purchase the Church confiscations, I, who am not a good, but an old farmer, with great humility beg leave to tell his late Lordship that usury is not a tutor of agriculture; and if the word [...] "enlightened" [...] be understood {{according to the new}} dictionary, as it always is in your new schools, I cannot conceive how a man's not believing in God can teach him to cultivate the earth with the least of any <b>additional</b> <b>skill</b> or encouragement.

I have got more information upon a curious and interesting branch of husbandry, in one short conversation with an old Carthusian monk, than I have derived from all the bank directors that I have ever conversed with. However, there is no cause for apprehension from the meddling of money-dealers with rural economy. These gentlemen are too wise in their generation. At first, perhaps, their tender and susceptible imaginations may be captivated with the innocent and unprofitable delights of a pastoral life; but in a little time they will find that agriculture is a trade much more laborious and much less lucrative than that which they had left. After making its panegyric, they will turn their backs on it, like their great precursor and prototype. They may, like him, begin by singing, [...] "Beatus ille"--but what will be the end? ...|$|E
