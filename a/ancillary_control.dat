Since the late 1970 s, the government has taken positive steps to establish administrative structures and statutes to arrest environmental decline.

The erratic developments in the 1980 s nevertheless allowed the enactment of four dedicated environmental laws and a complement of <b>ancillary</b> <b>control</b> measures. The 1989 White Paper provided a clear package of official policies and programmes to correct past ills in a ten-year comprehensive plan.

40|$|Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) {{have been}} {{recognised}} {{as the ideal}} solution for lowering the CO 2 emissions in the transport sector and helping to achieve a sustainable future. When BEV technology is leveraged with a solar energy source such as a Photovoltaic Charging Station (PV-CS), the CO 2 saving potential is extended to both generation and consumption points. Due to the intermittent nature of our solar resource, once the PV-CS is combined with a storage unit, energy production is achieved without risking the disruption to power supply reliability and quality. Dublin Institute of Technology (DIT) has recognised the viability of this dual design solution, with its recent deployment of a 10. 5 kWp PV-CS. The charging point {{has the potential to}} accommodate the existing charge of two campus Light weight Electric Vehicles (LEVs). Depending on the vehicles charge time, the demand can be accommodated through an individual or combination of the following options: direct solar, PV stored energy of BESS unit and the grid, while the surplus generation is used to charge the BESS or spilled into the grid. This paper presents the AC coupling configuration of grid tied (GT) and Battery Based (BB) inverters in the campus charging point. In order to prioritise the optimal energy flow of the PV-CS, an Energy Manager (EM) device along with Battery Energy Manager (BEM) has been incorporated. The EM controller is set with an objective to maximise self-consumption and further reduce the energy dependency on the grid. The preliminary results obtained from the online portal illustrates the relationship between the captured outputs of: PV generation, BESS charge / discharge, direct / total consumption, grid feed in and external grid supply, and further speculates the incorporated control strategy of EM and <b>ancillary</b> <b>control</b> components...|$|E
40|$|Between August 2000 and 14 May 2001 (defined as the 2000 - 2001 epidemic) {{bluetongue}} (BT) wasreported {{in three}} regions of Italy: Sardinia, Sicily and Calabria. During the 2001 - 2002 epidemic(between 15 May and 14 April 2002), the disease spread to five additional regions (Puglia, Basilicata,Campania, Latium and Tuscany). In May 2001 the Italian Ministry of Health decided to restrictanimal movements and to vaccinate all susceptible domestic ruminant populations in infected andin neighbouring regions. This {{action was taken}} to reduce virus circulation with the aim ofdecreasing direct losses in sheep and goats due to the disease, and indirect losses in cattlepopulations due to movement restrictions. Furthermore, the Italian authorities implemented anepidemiological surveillance system to monitor {{the spread of the}} virus and to provide moreeffective movement controls. In 2002, the vaccination campaign reached the set goal of vaccinatingmore than 80 % of susceptible domestic ruminants in Abruzzo, Sardinia and Tuscany. Thevaccination campaign successfully reduced clinical disease in Sardinia and Tuscany. Before theadvent of BT, cattle had always been moved from Sardinia, Sicily and the southern regions forfattening and slaughter in northern Italy. During the tracing of animals that had left infected areasin 2000 it was found that 10 957 cattle had been exported from Sardinia between June and August 2000 and were scattered throughout continental Italy. In addition, most cows selected for cullingfrom the southern regions and the islands were sent to northern Italy for slaughter. However, sinceAugust 2000 the animal trade between infected and free areas has come to a complete standstill. Sardinia, in particular, due to the climatic and epidemiological conditions (vectors survive almostthroughout the year), was no longer able to export any ruminants to the mainland. Long-termstandstill therefore led to heavy economic losses and had even greater social consequences. Asfarmers are not compensated, it is impossible to enforce these restrictions indefinitely. The Italianauthorities and the European Commission thus decided to adopt a policy of risk managementallowing some animal movement. This paper presents an analysis that assesses the risk associatedwith animal movement from restricted areas, according to the level of immunity of susceptibleanimal populations due to vaccination in the same areas. Results of the analysis indicate that whenmore than 80 % of the susceptible population in the territory of origin is vaccinated, the riskassociated with the movement of vaccinated animals to free areas appears acceptable and can bemitigated further by adopting <b>ancillary</b> <b>control</b> measures.

The latter target can be achieved maintaining an adequate voltage profile in normal operating condition and assuring that generators exhibit enough reactive margins that guarantee that the system voltages will remain under acceptable values in case of contingencies. The service has been designed in Spain to be partially mandatory and partially subject to payment based on market-driven rules and performance evaluation.

We evaluated <b>ancillary</b> <b>controls</b> on these fl uxes by measuring soil temperature, moisture, and soil:atmosphere fl uxes of carbon dioxide on these plots and by sampling a larger group of forest, grass, and agricultural sites once to evaluate soil organic matter, microbial biomass, and potential net N mineralization and nitrifi cation.

Carbon dioxide fl ux, organic matter, and microbial biomass were as high or higher in urban grasslands than in forests, suggesting that active carbon cycling creates sinks for N in vegetation and soil in these ecosystems.

40|$|Abstract — Recent {{studies on}} control of {{aggregate}} power of an ensemble of thermostatically-controlled-loads (TCLs) have been concentrated on shifting the temperature set points of each TCL in the population. A sudden {{shift in the}} set point, however, {{is known to be}} associated with undesirable power oscillations which require closed-loop control strategies to regulate the aggregate power consumption of the population. In this article, we propose a new approach which we term as a “safe protocol” to implement the shift in temperature set point. It is shown analytically and verified numerically that by shifting the set point “safely ” the aggregate power consumption can be changed to a different value within a time frame of the order of a TCL’s cycle duration and avoid the undesired oscillations seen otherwise in a “sudden ” shift. We discuss how the excess aggregate energy transferred under a safe shift in the set point could potentially mitigate the burden due to abnormal energy generation within a short time span.

40|$|Results {{from the}} {{development}} of a novel type of anode for electrowinning Mg are reported. A tailored alloy system based on the binary Cu-Al can be made to form a thin alumina layer on its surface that is relatively impervious to attack by the molten chloride melt at high temperature. This barrier is thin enough (5 [...] 50 nm) to conduct electrical current without significant IR loss. As the layer slowly dissolves, the chemical potential developed at the surface drives the diffusion of aluminum from the bulk alloy to reform (heal) the protective alumina layer. In this way, an anode that generates Cl{sub 2 } (melt electrolysis) and O{sub 2 } (wet feed hydrolysis) and no chlorocarbons can be realized. Further, the authors expect the rate of loss of the anode to be dramatically less than the coke-derived carbon anodes typically in use for this technology, leading to substantial cost savings and <b>ancillary</b> pollution <b>control</b> by eliminating coke plant emissions, as well as eliminating chlorinated hydrocarbon emissions from Mg electrowinning cells...|$|R
