5|$|Sarmiento was an educator, {{a civilized}} {{man who was}} a militant <b>adherent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Unitarist movement. During the Argentine civil war he fought against Facundo several times, and while in Spain he {{became a member of}} the Literary Society of Professors. Exiled to Chile by Rosas when he started to write Facundo, Sarmiento would later return as a politician. He was a member of the Senate after Rosas's fall and {{president}} of Argentina for six years (18681874). During his presidency, Sarmiento concentrated on migration, sciences, and culture. His ideas were based on European civilization; for him, the development of a country was rooted in education. To this end, he founded Argentina's military and naval colleges.|$|E
5|$|On October 13, 1590, the German {{astronomer}} Michael Maestlin observed an occultation of Mars by Venus. One of his students, Johannes Kepler, {{quickly became}} an <b>adherent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Copernican system. After {{the completion of}} his education, Kepler became an assistant to the Danish nobleman and astronomer, Tycho Brahe. With access granted to Tycho's detailed observations of Mars, Kepler was set to work mathematically assembling a replacement to the Prutenic Tables. After repeatedly failing to fit the motion of Mars into a circular orbit as required under Copernicanism, he succeeded in matching Tycho's observations by assuming the orbit was an ellipse and the Sun was located {{at one of the}} foci. His model became the basis for Kepler's laws of planetary motion, which were published in his multi-volume work Epitome Astronomiae Copernicanae (Epitome of Copernican Astronomy) between 1615 and 1621.|$|E

25|$|R. Joseph Hoffmann, who {{had created}} the Jesus Project, which {{included}} both mythicists and historicists to investigate the historicity of Jesus, wrote that an <b>adherent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Christ myth theory asked {{to set up a}} separate section of the project for those committed to the theory. Hoffmann felt that to be committed to mythicism signaled a lack of necessary skepticism and he noted that most members of the project did not reach the mythicist conclusion.|$|E
25|$|The copper patinas {{are very}} thin: just 0.05080–0.07620millimeters in thickness. Yet, {{they are highly}} <b>adherent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{underlying}} copper metal. The initial and intermediate oxide and sulfide patina films are not particularly corrosion resistant. The final sulfate patina is a particularly durable layer that is highly resistant to all forms of atmospheric corrosion and protects the underlying metal against further weathering. As patination progresses and the durable sulfate layer forms, the rate of corrosion decreases, averaging between 0.0001–0.0003millimeters per year. For a 0.6millimeter-thick sheet, this equates to less than 5% corrosion {{over a period of}} 100 years. Further information is available on copper patination.|$|E
25|$|Kardar {{had been}} a strong {{supporter}} of Mohammad Ali Jinnah and an <b>adherent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> idea of Muslim glory in India. Abdul Hafeez Kardar went into politics and served {{as the president of the}} Pakistan Cricket Board in the 1970s. His tenure was notable for increasing representation of Asian and African cricketing nations with the International Cricket Council. Kardar was forced to resign after an embarrassing pay dispute with the players in 1977. He also worked with many charitable and social development causes, and in the last years of his life was assigned as Pakistan's ambassador to Switzerland, prior to his death in his hometown, Lahore in 1996. Kardar is today credited with popularising the game with common Pakistani people and youth, for his tutelage of some of Pakistan's greatest cricketers, young talent and prodigies, and his stewardship of the Pakistan team and the board in its early years, developing a culture of pride and professionalism. He was also elected to the provincial assembly of Punjab in 1970 on a ticket of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), and was also inducted in the provincial cabinet as a minister.|$|E

500|$|Educated by American Protestant missionaries {{from a young}} age, Liliʻuokalani {{became a}} devout Christian and <b>adherent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{principles}} of Christianity. These missionaries were largely of Congregationalist and Presbyterian extractions, ascribing to Calvinist theology, and Liliʻuokalani considered herself a [...] "regular attendant on the Presbyterian worship". She was {{the first member of}} the royal family to consistently and regularly attend service at Kawaiahaʻo Church since King Kamehameha IV converted to Anglicanism. On Sundays, she played the organ and led the choir at Kawaiahaʻo. She also regularly attended service at Kaumakapili Church and held a special interest in the Liliʻuokalani Protestant Church, to which she donated the Queen Liliʻuokalani Clock in 1892.|$|E
500|$|Mitică and Lache and Mache {{have often}} been seen as three manifestations of a main type in Caragiale's work—the petty clerk who spends his time off in lively company.

Ibrăileanu, who criticized Caragiale for his satirical overview of the social process, believed that the clerks in his work are unnecessarily cynical, and stressed that Inspecţiune was the only one of his works were [...] "one sees at least one glitter of kindness in the souls of the mitici".|$|E

500|$|Although {{the shape}} of the Chrysler Building aims to comply with the Zoning Law, there was also a {{utilitarian}} purpose to the five setbacks. The first sixteen floors were made as large as possible to optimize the area of rental space near ground level, which was seen as valuable. The U-shaped cut above the fourth floor served as a shaft for air flow and illumination. Whereas the lowermost three shafts were strictly <b>adherent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> regulation, the area between floors 28 and 31 was a multipurpose architectural inclusion. According to Robinson, [...] "they add visual interest {{to the middle of the}} building, preventing it from being dominated by the heavy detail of the lower floors and the eye-catching design of the finial. They provide a base to the column of the tower, effecting a transition between the blocky lower stories and the lofty shaft." ...|$|E
500|$|Both of Helmut's older brothers, Joachim and Werner, {{as members}} of the Confessing Church (German: Bekennende Kirche), {{encountered}} trouble with the Nazi party. The Confessing Church, led by Pastor Martin Niemöller, was a schismatic Protestant church which opposed the Reich's efforts to [...] "Nazify" [...] Germany's Protestant churches. It stood in outspoken opposition to National Socialist principles, particularly those embodied in the Aryan Paragraph. Through the Barmen Declaration, the church condemned the national German Evangelical Church as heretical. Werner Lent, an <b>adherent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Confessing church, was arrested {{for the first time in}} 1937 after preaching an anti-Nazi sermon. In June 1942, his brother Joachim was arrested by the Gestapo after reading the so-called Mölders letter from the pulpit. The Mölders letter was a propaganda piece conceived by Sefton Delmer, the chief of the British black propaganda in the Political Warfare Executive (PWE) to capitalize on the death of Germany's fighter ace Werner Mölders; this letter, ostensibly written by Mölders, attested to the supreme importance of his Catholic faith in his life—by implication, placing faith above his allegiance to the National Socialist Party.|$|E
