Traditionally, men who were graduated first in the class were awarded Julius Rosenwald Fellowships for graduate work at Harvard University, but that university did not accept women. Murray was rejected despite a letter of support from President Roosevelt. She wrote in response, [...] "I would gladly change my sex to meet your requirements, but since the way to such change has not been revealed to me, I have no recourse but to appeal to you to change your minds. <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> tell me that one is as difficult as the other?" ...|$|E
500|$|On April 17, 2011, {{an extra}} named Nicole Crowther {{revealed}} the prom {{king and queen}} result on the social networking Twitter. Co-creator Brad Falchuk replied to her, [...] "hope you're qualified to do something besides work in entertainment. Who <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> spoil something talented people have spent months to create?" [...] As a result, Crowther was reportedly fired from the show, however, Crowther later claimed {{that she had not}} been a Glee extra since October 2010, and that she learned the spoiler from a dinner party and not on set. Following the scandal, speculation arose that the ending might be reshot when Monteith tweeted a photograph of himself standing next to Agron, who was wearing a tiara. The show did not comment on this, though Crowther stated that Glee would not be reshooting.|$|E

2500|$|Another Western Turkic general, Ashina Chuna (阿史那處那), {{made one}} of his subordinates, a tudun, the {{protector}} general over Yanqi. [...] The protector general, in the stead of the king of Yanqi, thereafter submitted tributes to Tang. But when his emissary arrived in Chang'an, Emperor Taizong rebuked him and stated, [...] "I attacked Yanqi. [...] Who <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> occupy it?" [...] In fear, the Western Turkic protector general abandoned Yanqi, and the Yanqi nobles supported Long Lipozhun's cousin Long Xuepoanazhi (龍薛婆阿那支) {{to be the new}} king, but continued to be submissive to Ashina Chuna. [...] Meanwhile, Long Tuqizhi and his family were delivered to Chang'an, where Emperor Taizong released them.|$|E
2500|$|In spring 1822 Lord Milton gave to Fitzwilliam {{a list of}} English boroughs {{and their}} Members' {{political}} party. It showed that boroughs with smaller populations had more government supporters than those with larger populations, which had more Whig MPs. Milton therefore asked Fitzwilliam to support reform which would strengthen the Whig aristocracy. Fitzwilliam conceded that such a scheme would improve the system, as he wrote to Lord Grey on 22 March, [...] "but ninety other plans would do as much, and with me the question is, is it for {{the advantage of the}} country, and {{for the good of the}} public to moot the subject at all—where <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> limit alterations, at what point are they to stop?"

2500|$|When {{he arrived}} back in Sydney in 1805 Macarthur further antagonised local {{authorities}} by claiming his 5,000 acres (20km²) in the Cowpastures. This was prime grazing land, well supplied by {{water from the}} Nepean river, and reserved by the Governor exclusively for the colony's cattle herds. Both Governors King and Bligh strongly objected to this and wanted the grant moved, but the Colonial Office wrote back affirming Macarthur's right to the land. Macarthur named it Camden Park after his patron. Bligh also turned down Macarthur's request for the remaining 5000 acres (20km²) after he had begun exporting wool to England. Bligh was firmly opposed to Macarthur's venture, according to Evatt, not because he objected to the fine wool industry, but because he believed that 'first preference {{should be given to}} agriculture'. As reported much later by Macarthur, Bligh said to him in a conversation at Government House; [...] "What have I to do with your sheep, sir? What have I to do with your cattle. <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> have such flocks of sheep and such herds of cattle as no man ever heard of before? No, sir!".|$|E
