5000|$|The {{addition}} of surfactants {{does not always}} {{have a positive effect}} on all properties. The water resistance of the coating can be decreased with surfactant addition since surfactants can be very water-soluble and will easily wash out of a coating. This problem of moisture resistance is particularly prevalent problem for art conservation, as well as problems with adhesion, loss of optical clarity, and dirt pickup caused by polyether surfactants in contemporary <b>acrylic</b> <b>emulsion</b> used in artworks bearing acrylic coats. [...] While the type and amount of surfactant determine what properties will be affected, other chemicals in a paint can alter the overall effect the surfactants may have on the paint. Elasticity has been found to either increase or decrease in latex paints depending on the amount of TiO2 present.|$|E

40|$|The {{preparation}} and characterization of new nanocomposite films {{based on two}} <b>acrylic</b> <b>emulsions,</b> composed of random copolymers of butyl acrylate and methyl methacrylate, and bacterial cellulose is reported. The new composite materials were obtained through a simple and green approach by casting water-based suspensions of the <b>acrylic</b> <b>emulsions</b> and bacterial cellulose nanofibrils. The excellent compatibility between these matrices and the natural reinforcing fibers, observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), {{was reflected in the}} enhanced thermal and mechanical properties of the ensuing composites. Thus, an increase of around 30 degrees C in the maximum degradation temperature was observed for a 10 % content of bacterial cellulose. The new composites showed glass-rubber transition temperature profiles comparable to those of the pristine matrices, as shown by DMA, and increasing elastic moduli with increasing the bacterial cellulose content. The tensile tests revealed a substantial increase in Young's modulus and tensile strength and a corresponding decrease in elongation at break with increasing bacterial cellulose load.

30|$|The {{historical}} development, {{properties and}} conservation-related {{concerns about the}} use of <b>acrylic</b> <b>emulsion</b> paints by artists have been published in detail elsewhere [1]-[4]. Briefly, the polymeric composition of artists’ <b>acrylic</b> <b>emulsion</b> paints has evolved since their introduction to the market. The early formulations were based on a poly ethyl acrylate/methyl methactylate (pEA/MMA) copolymer and some Talens acrylic paints remain based on this [5]. In the 1980 s, poly n-butyl methacrylate/methyl methacylate (pnBA/MMA) was widely substituted for pEA/MMA. In the late 2000 s, a further change the base emulsion formulation took place with the incorporation of terpolymers and copolymers of 2 -EHA by some artists’ paint manufacturers [6].|$|E

The results indicated the high alkalinity of filler (cement) in coating can obviously improve the anticorrosion performance of coated steel electrodes. And the inhibitive ability of cement-based coating with fluoride <b>acrylic</b> <b>emulsion</b> is superior to that of the coating with epoxy emulsion.

40|$|Polymer {{modified}} cement-based {{materials and}} fiber reinforced cementitious composites are both {{widely used in}} civil engineering applications. Both show great advantages, especially in repair and rehabilitation. The work reported here, however, deals with polymer modified fiber reinforced cement based composites (PM-FRC) that is, combined used of fibers and polymers in the same system. This paper reports the quantitative study of all the three additives each taken with three settings, namely, steel fiber (1. 0 %, 1. 5 % and 2. 0 %), <b>acrylic</b> <b>emulsion</b> polymer (1. 0 %, 2. 5 % and 4. 0 %) and silica fume (5. 0 %, 6. 0 % and 8. 0 %). The other two control variables were chosen as water-cement ratio (0. 42, 0. 50 and 0. 60) and aging (3, 7 and 28 days). In this study, steel fiber reinforced polymer modified concrete (SFRPMC) was produced {{with the addition of}} <b>acrylic</b> <b>emulsion</b> polymer (< 4 %) into steel fiber reinforced concrete which enhance the workability, strength and thermal properties. The unique properties of steel fiber qualify it to be the best option as reinforcement in acrylic polymer cement composite. However, uniform dispersion is the biggest challenge in generating a composite with an optimum performance. Hence, <b>acrylic</b> <b>emulsion</b> polymer and silica fume with different percentages was used {{to improve the quality of}} steel fiber reinforced concrete. In this study, we have used a comprehensive approach known as Design of Experimental (DoE) which had been applied efficiently from the material formulation and processing stage until the material characterization. Through verification experiment, the compressive strength had increased by as much as 59 % compared to control concrete specimen. To optimize other mechanical properties such as flexural strength, splitting tensile strength and modulus of elasticity, the L 9 array method was used. Variant analysis and average analysis were then used to get the optimum formulation and through the X-ray diffraction analysis, the dispersion of acrylic polymer is slightly improved when combined with steel fiber reinforced concrete. From morphology observation, the dispersion of steel fiber with acrylic polymer addition showed a better uniformed dispersion in SFRPMC. Through thermal analysis, optimum specimen was proven to own good thermal stability than the other specimens. Steel fiber reinforced <b>acrylic</b> <b>emulsion</b> polymer modified concrete (SFRPMC) were produced based on the significant parameters suggested by Taguchi Analysis that was performed earlier. SFRPMC had improved the dispersion of steel fiber and acrylic polymer in matrix composite due to the presence of a few functional groups of elements from different materials, as observed through the morphology examination through SEMEDX analysis. Synergistic effect between the fibers and the polymer were observed in most of the composites as long as suitable polymer dosages were used. It is concluded that a high performance composites with 2. 5 % <b>acrylic</b> <b>emulsion</b> polymer, 8 % silica fume, 1. 5 % steel fiber and water-cement ratio 0. 50 at 28 days curing could be a promising material for both structural and repair purpose...|$|E

50|$|Another {{difference}} between oil and acrylic paints is the versatility offered by acrylic paints.

Mixing artist or student grade acrylic paint with household <b>acrylic</b> <b>emulsions</b> is possible, allowing the use of premixed tints straight from the tube or tin, and thereby presenting the painter with a vast color range at their disposal. This versatility is also illustrated by the variety of additional artistic uses for acrylics. Specialized acrylics have been manufactured and used for linoblock printing (acrylic block printing ink has been produced by Derivan since the early 1980s), face painting, airbrushing, watercolor-like techniques, and fabric screen printing.|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} we study {{thixotropic}} and time-dependent rheological behavior of commercial <b>acrylic</b> <b>emulsion</b> paint using a framework of soft glassy rheology. We observe that <b>acrylic</b> <b>emulsion</b> paint, which shows thix-otropic rheological behavior, demonstrates various characteristic features of a soft glassy materials such as weak but certain increase in elastic modulus {{as a function of}} aging time, maximum in viscous modulus as a function of strain at the onset of yielding, and slow increase in elastic modulus as a function of fre-quency. Stress relaxation measurements, subsequent to step strain, carried out at different aging times dem-onstrate slowing down of the relaxation dynamics. This behavior is similar to that observed in polymeric glasses and other soft glassy materials undergoing aging dynamics. Relaxation modulus when plotted against appropriately rescaled time yields a superposi-tion irrespective of the aging time. The rescaled time also known as effective time, which adjusts the mate-rial clock by accounting for increasing relaxation time, enables estimation of the rate of change of relaxation time with the aging time. We conclude by relating thix-otropy in an emulsion paint sample to an interplay between physical aging and shear melting in th...|$|E

Although <b>acrylic</b> <b>emulsion</b> paints have {{been the focus of}} museum-led research over the past decade, the impact of artists’ technique and conservation treatment on the upper-most surface of these paints remains essentially unexplored; This paper summarises previous studies using vibrational (FTIR) spectroscopy and presents initial assessments of paint surfaces using X-ray spectroscopies (XPS and NEXAFS) aimed at characterising artists’ acrylic paint film surfaces after natural ageing and wet surface cleaning treatment. Both techniques were found to be well suited for surface-sensitive investigations of the organic materials associated with artists’ acrylic paints, including explorations into: (A) cleaning system residues, (B) surfactant extraction from paint surfaces, (C) the identification of migrated surfactant, and (D) monitoring pigment changes at the paint/air interface of paint films; It has been shown is that these X-ray spectroscopic techniques can be used for the analysis of almost purely organic materials in a way that complements mass spectroscopic techniques, FTIR and XRF.

Golden OPEN Acrylics and Winsor and Newton (W&N) Artists’ Acrylic (replacement for the discontinued Finity range) paints contain formulation modifications aimed at increasing drying/working time (both paints) and decreasing wet to dry colour shift (W&N). The paints were characterised for their polymeric composition, pigment content, surface chemistry, water extractable components and surface gloss. Analytical results indicate that a 2 -ethylhexyl acrylate monomer (2 -EHA) has been either added or substituted into the acrylic polymer, and that the PEO-type surfactants often present in established formulations have either been reduced/not used. Simulated surface cleaning tests were also performed to explore pigment transfer and solubility issues. Pigment transfer was found to be both brand and pigment dependent, with the Golden OPEN colours proving less vulnerable than the range of W&N paints tested. Of the cleaning systems tested, the range of aqueous systems, soot sponge and the first generation Dow microemulsions resulted in some pigment transfer from these relatively young paint films.
