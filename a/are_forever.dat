5|$|Diamonds <b>Are</b> <b>Forever</b> {{was adapted}} as a daily comic strip for the Daily Express newspaper, and {{syndicated}} around the world. The original adaptation ran from 10 August 1959 to 30 January 1960. The strip {{was written by}} Henry Gammidge and illustrated by John McLusky.|$|E
5|$|Diamonds <b>Are</b> <b>Forever</b> was {{published}} on 26 March 1956 by Jonathan Cape {{with a cover}} designed by Pat Marriott. As with the three previous Bond books, {{the first edition of}} 12,500 copies sold out quickly; the US edition {{was published}} in October 1956 by Macmillan. The novel was serialised in The Daily Express newspaper from 12 April 1956 onwards—the first of Fleming's novels he had sold to the newspaper—which led to an overall rise in the sales of the novels. From November 1956 sales of Diamonds <b>Are</b> <b>Forever,</b> and Fleming's other novels, all rose following the visit of the Prime Minister, Sir Anthony Eden, to Fleming's Goldeneye estate to recuperate following the Suez Crisis; Eden's stay was much reported in the British press. The book received boosts in sales in 1962 when Eon Productions adapted Dr. No for the cinema, and in 1971 when Diamonds <b>Are</b> <b>Forever</b> was produced for the big screen. In February 1958 Pan Books published a paperback version of the novel in the UK, which sold 68,000 copies {{before the end of the}} year. Since its initial publication the book has been issued in numerous hardback and paperback editions, translated into several languages and has never been out of print.|$|E

5|$|Goldfinger—notably {{featuring}} 007 {{being threatened}} with the novel's circular saw, {{rather than the}} film's laser beam—and Diamonds <b>Are</b> <b>Forever.</b> In 1991 a TV cartoon series James Bond Jr. was produced with Corey Burton {{in the role of}} Bond's nephew, also called James Bond.|$|E
5|$|The 1973 BBC {{documentary}} Omnibus: The British Hero featured Christopher Cazenove {{playing a}} number of such title characters (e.g. Richard Hannay and Bulldog Drummond), including James Bond in dramatised scenes from Goldfinger – notably featuring the hero being threatened with the novel's circular saw, rather than the film's laser beam – and Diamonds <b>Are</b> <b>Forever.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{novel was}} loosely adapted in a 1971 film {{starring}} Sean Connery {{and directed by}} Guy Hamilton. Diamonds <b>Are</b> <b>Forever</b> was the final Bond film undertaken by Sean Connery with Eon Productions, although {{he returned to the}} role of Bond twelve years later with Kevin McClory's Taliafilm company for Never Say Never Again.|$|E

5|$|Although Fleming {{provides}} no dates within his novels, John Griswold and Henry Chancellor—both {{of whom have}} written books on behalf of Ian Fleming Publications—have identified different timelines based on events and situations within the novel series as a whole. Chancellor put the events of Diamonds <b>Are</b> <b>Forever</b> in 1954; Griswold is more precise, and considers the story {{to have taken place}} in July and August 1953.|$|E
5|$|As with Fleming's {{previous}} novels, Diamonds <b>Are</b> <b>Forever</b> received broadly positive reviews at {{the time}} of publication. The story was serialised in the Daily Express newspaper, first in an abridged, multi-part form and then as a comic strip. In 1971 it was adapted into the seventh Bond film in the series and was the last Eon Productions film to star Sean Connery as Bond.|$|E
5|$|As {{with his}} {{previous}} novels, Fleming used events {{from his past}} as elements in his novel. Whilst at Kitzbühel in the 1930s, Fleming's car, a Standard Tourer, had been struck by a train at a level crossing {{and he had been}} dragged fifty yards down the track. From that time on he had associated trains with death, which led to their use as a plot device not just in The Man with the Golden Gun, but also in Diamonds <b>Are</b> <b>Forever</b> and From Russia, with Love.|$|E

5|$|Diamonds <b>Are</b> <b>Forever</b> is a 1971 British spy {{film and}} the {{seventh in the}} James Bond series to be {{produced}} by Eon Productions. It is the sixth and final Eon film to star Sean Connery, who returned to the role as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond, {{for the first time}} since You Only Live Twice (1967), having declined to reprise the role in On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969).|$|E
5|$|Diamonds <b>Are</b> <b>Forever</b> is {{the fourth}} novel by the English author Ian Fleming to feature his fictional British Secret Service agent James Bond. Fleming wrote the story at his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, {{inspired}} by a Sunday Times article on diamond smuggling. The book was first published by Jonathan Cape in the United Kingdom on 26 March 1956.|$|E
5|$|Dr. No also {{establishes}} the oft-repeated association (in this case, Project Mercury) between the Bond series and the US manned space programme—which would be repeated with Project Gemini in You Only Live Twice, Project Apollo in Diamonds <b>Are</b> <b>Forever,</b> {{and the space}} shuttle in Moonraker (not to mention several outer space sequences involving fictional satellite programmes in GoldenEye, Tomorrow Never Dies, and Die Another Day).|$|E

5|$|During {{the filming}} in Japan, it was {{announced}} that Sean Connery would retire from the role of Bond, but after a hiatus, he returned in 1971's Diamonds <b>Are</b> <b>Forever</b> and later 1983's non-Eon Bond film Never Say Never Again. You Only Live Twice is the first Bond film to be directed by Lewis Gilbert, who later directed the 1977 film The Spy Who Loved Me and the 1979 film Moonraker, both starring Roger Moore.|$|E
5|$|Fleming's first work of non-fiction, The Diamond Smugglers, was {{published}} in 1957 and was partly based on background research for his fourth Bond novel, Diamonds <b>Are</b> <b>Forever.</b> Much of the material had appeared in The Sunday Times and was based on Fleming's interviews with John Collard, {{a member of the}} International Diamond Security Organisation who had previously worked in MI5. The book received mixed reviews in the UK and US.|$|E
5|$|Fleming's {{original}} {{novel was}} adapted as a daily comic strip {{which was published}} in the Daily Express newspaper and syndicated around the world. The adaptation ran from 3 October 1960 to 1 April 1961. The adaptation was written by Henry Gammidge and illustrated by John McLusky. Goldfinger was reprinted in 2005 by Titan Books as part of the Dr. No anthology, which in addition to Dr. No, also included Diamonds <b>Are</b> <b>Forever</b> and From Russia, with Love.|$|E
