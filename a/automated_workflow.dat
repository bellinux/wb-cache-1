5000|$|Due to {{the highly}} time {{consuming}} and work intensive standard procedure {{the method of}} in-gel digestion was limited to {{a relatively small number}} of protein spots to be processed at a time. Therefore it has been found to be the ideal object for automation ambitions to overcome these limitations for industrial and service laboratories. Today, in laboratories where in-gel digestion is performed with a high-throughput the procedure is usually automated. The degree of automation varies from simple pipetting robots to highly sophisticated all-in-one solutions, offering an <b>automated</b> <b>workflow</b> from gel to mass spectrometry. The systems usually consist of a spot picker, a digestion robot, and a spotter.|$|E
50|$|The authors {{note that}} {{introducing}} program analysis and verification into the workflow world requires detailed understanding of execution semantics of workflow language, including execution properties of nodes and arcs in the workflow graph, understanding functional equivalencies between workflow patterns, {{and many other}} issues. Doing such analysis is difficult, and addressing these issues requires building on formal methods used in computer science research (e.g. Petri nets) and building on these formal methods to develop user-level tools to reason about the properties of both workflows and workflow systems. The lack of such tools in the past stopped <b>automated</b> <b>workflow</b> management solutions from maturing from nice-to-have academic toys to production-level tools used outside the narrow circle of early adopters and workflow enthusiasts.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The {{application}} of business process execution and guidance to environments with highly dynamic situations and workflow diversity is hindered by rigid predefined workflow models. Software engineering environments constitute an acute example where developers {{could benefit from}} <b>automated</b> <b>workflow</b> guidance if the workflows were made sufficiently concrete and conformant to actual situations. A context-aware software engineering environment was developed utilizing semantic processing and situational method engineering to automatically adapt workflows utilizing an adaptive processaware information system. Workflows are constructed via context knowledge congruent to the current situation. Preliminary results suggest this technique can be beneficial in addressing high workflow diversity while providing useable guidance and reducing workflow modeling effort.

30|$|Big data {{pipelines}} {{build on}} <b>automated</b> <b>workflows</b> which are executed in massively parallel applications. In {{order to improve}} the performance of <b>automated</b> <b>workflows</b> the respective systems and workflows have to be monitored [1, 2]. In general {{it has to be}} distinguished between the monitoring of continuously changing states of a distributed system, e.g. server load and bandwidth [3 – 5] and the monitoring of events [6, 7] indicating the progress of a specific workflow or even a group of concurrent workflows. In this context the classical monitoring approaches are combined with elements from complex event processing [8 – 10] in which the progress of a workflow is captured as an ordered set of events, the so-called trace or lifeline [11 – 13]. Applications comprise the identification of wait states in large scale simulations [14], the analysis of for-loops [15], or the visualization of execution and wait times in distributed systems [16].|$|R
