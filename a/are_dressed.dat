5|$|The two upper {{register}} wings {{on either}} side of Jesus show a pair of angels holding the instruments of the Passion. These include a lance, crown of thorns and a stick with a sponge soaked in vinegar. The angels <b>are</b> <b>dressed</b> in white liturgical vestments.|$|E
5|$|Headed by Saint Peter, the Apostles <b>are</b> <b>dressed</b> {{in white}} robes {{and sit on}} two facing benches set below Christ {{and to the right}} and left of the choir of virgins. Two angels attend to the groups {{gathered}} at each side of the benches. A further two angels are positioned immediately above Christ.

The angel on the left holds a lance and crown of thorns, the angel on the right a sponge and nails.|$|E
5|$|Robert Fletcher {{served as}} costume {{designer}} for the film. During the Earth-based scenes, Kirk {{and his crew}} continue to wear their 23rd-century clothing. Nimoy debated whether the crew should change costumes, but after seeing how people in San Francisco <b>are</b> <b>dressed,</b> he decided they would still fit in.|$|E
500|$|Due to the {{presence}} of Halloween, many of the employees costumes reflect movie and literary characters. Kelly <b>is</b> <b>dressed</b> as Dorothy Gale, but Michael makes an insensitive remark about Bend It Like Beckham. Dwight <b>is</b> <b>dressed</b> as a Sith, one of the characters in the Star Wars universe capable of using the [...] "dark side" [...] of the Force. Phyllis, however, confuses him for [...] "some sort of monk". Kevin <b>is</b> <b>dressed</b> as a Dunder Mifflin super hero, with a costume design similar to Mr. Incredible. Creed <b>is</b> <b>dressed</b> like a vampire and Devon <b>is</b> <b>dressed</b> like a hobo. Pam, Phyllis, and Angela <b>are</b> all <b>dressed</b> up as cats. Oscar <b>is</b> <b>dressed</b> as a woman, and Michael asks him if he is [...] "flying his true colors", to which Oscar reacts defensively.|$|R
50|$|Her husband's sister, Electress Sophia of Hanover, commented, when Charlotte, {{after her}} death, <b>was</b> <b>dressed</b> for burial {{that it was}} the first time that she <b>was</b> <b>dressed</b> without attacking or hitting someone.|$|R

5|$|The 1430s dating is {{supported}} by the style of the underdrawing, which is consistent with known signed works by van Eyck from that time. In addition, the figures <b>are</b> <b>dressed</b> in clothes fashionable in the 1420s {{with the exception of one}} of the possible donors, tentatively identified as Margaret of Bavaria, who is depicted as the sybil standing in the right foreground of the crucifixion panel and wears clothes in style in the early 1430s.|$|E
5|$|During {{development}} {{there was}} a concern that the game might initially seem too complicated. At {{the end of the}} videotape there is a special fifteen-minute presentation called the rules presentation in which a voice-over along with the Gatekeeper explains the game, the characters and how to play. The rules presentation was created to help explain the game to new players. The videotape can be forwarded {{to the start of the}} instructions. During the rules presentation a game is played by actors who <b>are</b> <b>dressed</b> as three Harbingers – Baron Samedi, Anne de Chantraine and Elizabeth Bathory – and three Soul Rangers. The demonstration game is used throughout the rules presentation to help explain how to play the game.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, the {{province}} of Trento, Italy provided sculpted wooden figures and animals as well as utensils to create depictions of daily life. The scene featured seventeen figures with nine depicting the Holy Family, the Magi, and the shepherds. The nine figures were originally donated by Saint Vincent Pallotti for the nativity at Rome's Church of Sant'Andrea della Valle in 1842 and eventually {{found their way to}} the Vatican. They <b>are</b> <b>dressed</b> anew each year for the scene. The 2008 scene was set in Bethlehem with a fountain and a hearth representing regeneration and light. The same year, the Paul VI Audience Hall exhibited a nativity designed by Mexican artists.|$|E
5|$|In December 1993, Moore {{was again}} {{on the cover of}} Vanity Fair, but this time she <b>was</b> <b>dressed</b> in two straps and a large red bow and was sitting on David Letterman's lap while he <b>was</b> <b>dressed</b> up as Santa Claus.|$|R
50|$|The Inspector and his Dog {{chase the}} characters. While {{they are always}} the same character, his uniform changes {{according}} to the location. During the New Orleans edition, the Inspector was replaced by Frankenstein with a skeleton dog. During the second London, North Pole and Winter Holiday editions, he <b>was</b> <b>dressed</b> as Santa Claus. During the second Rome edition and third Paris edition, he <b>was</b> <b>dressed</b> as the Easter Bunny. During the Prague edition, he <b>was</b> <b>dressed</b> as the Knight.|$|R

5|$|The video {{opens on}} a stately room, with plum colored walls and antique furniture. Bunton opens a large, black door and is {{followed}} by Halliwell, Beckham, Mel B and Chisholm. The girls <b>are</b> <b>dressed</b> in beautiful gowns throughout the video, presumably designed by Roberto Cavalli, who designed the costumes for their then-upcoming tour. Vignettes of the girls singing together and separately are sewn {{together to create a}} collage. Fading in and out, the music video ends with the girls combined together although they are at different places.|$|E
5|$|The {{story was}} redrawn and colourised in 1947. For this edition, Hergé was {{assisted}} by Edgar Pierre Jacobs, {{an artist who}} worked as part of Studios Hergé. Jacobs oversaw changes to the costumes and background of the story; in the 1938 version, the Syldavian Royal Guards <b>are</b> <b>dressed</b> like British Beefeaters, while the 1947 version has them dressed in a Balkanised uniform. Jacobs also inserted a cameo of himself and {{his wife in the}} Syldavian royal court, while in that same scene is a cameo of Hergé, his then-wife Germaine, his brother Paul, and three of his friend's - Édouard Cnaepelinckx, Jacques Van Melkebeke, and Marcel Stobbaerts. Hergé and Jacobs also inserted further cameos of themselves at the bottom of page 38, where they appear as uniformed officers. While the character of Professor Alembick had been given the forename of Nestor in the original version, this was changed to Hector for the second; this had been done so as to avoid confusion with the character of Nestor, the butler of Marlinspike Hall, whom Hergé had introduced in The Secret of the Unicorn.|$|E
5|$|The {{walls of}} the college were built using rubble from Oxfordshire dressed with local stone. The {{remaining}} parts of the 17th-century walls <b>are</b> <b>dressed</b> with Headington stone, which was a common building material in Oxford at that time: the geologist W. J. Arkell wrote that it was used for every building in Oxford constructed during this century for which records exist. Areas of Headington stone {{can be seen in}} the first quadrangle on the wall of the hall. It was only discovered towards the end of the 18th century that it did not weather well: the surface of the stone develops a hard crust, which blisters, bursts and comes off. Much of it has subsequently been replaced with other materials as a result.|$|E

25|$|A 15th-century {{restored}} Tree of Jesse {{window in}} the chapel of {{the east end of}} the church. Thirteen of the figures are original, seventeen are partly restored and thirty-one are modern. The kings <b>are</b> <b>dressed</b> in short doublets which are compared with similar figures in the manuscript of 1640 representing the victories of Edward IV which is in the British Library Harleian MS. 7353.|$|E
25|$|Unlike his {{predecessors}} Jan van Eyck and Rogier van der Weyden, who typical painted exterior wings in grisaille, Memling shows the saints in a realistic manner. Although the donors in van Eyck's Ghent Altarpiece and van der Weyden's Beaune Altarpiece are also painted realistically, they are placed within architectural niches {{separate from the}} adjacent statue-like grisaille saints. Memling breaks with that tradition in these exterior panels, but the subdued palette he uses retains some sense of grisaille. The donors <b>are</b> <b>dressed</b> in their Augustinian habits; {{the two men in}} stark black and the two women in white on black. The saints <b>are</b> <b>dressed</b> in monochromatic clothing. St James wears a light blue cloak and St Anthony's is grey. St Agnes is dressed in drab green and St Clare is also in a dark habit. Although the figures seem to be in two niches, they are enclosed in a single shallow space, with stone walls behind, trefoil arches above, and two columns adorning the outermost edges. Where the wings open is a single column which has the appearance of two separate columns.|$|E
50|$|The {{music video}} {{features}} Tommy heavenly6 and her band {{in a setting}} that resembles a cooking show.

At some points in the video the setting is a birthday party, where Kawase <b>is</b> <b>dressed</b> accordingly.|$|R
2500|$|Boys {{take part}} in the procession, playing {{different}} roles associated with Christmas. Some may <b>be</b> <b>dressed</b> {{in the same kind of}} white robe, but with a cone-shaped hat decorated with golden stars, called stjärngossar (star boys); some may <b>be</b> <b>dressed</b> up as [...] "tomtenissar" [...] (Santa's elves), carrying lanterns; and some may <b>be</b> <b>dressed</b> up as gingerbread men. They participate in the singing and also have a song or two of their own, usually Staffan Stalledräng, which tells the story about Saint Stephen, the first Christian martyr, caring for his five horses.|$|R
60|$|Charlie himself <b>was</b> <b>dressed</b> gaily, in the garb of a {{military}} officer {{in the service of}} an Indian rajah. He was to ride, and a horse, saddle, and gay housings were procured.

25|$|The second storey is {{supported}} on six pillars {{and the space}} {{is divided into two}} arched spaces. To the right and facing right in prayer is Sir George Shirley with his two sons behind him. All three figures <b>are</b> <b>dressed</b> in brightly painted period dress and the clothes include details in gold. In the left arch is his wife (d. 1595), daughter, and two babies. According to the Latin inscription, Shirley's wife died aged 29 whilst giving birth.|$|E
25|$|Yup'ik dolls (yugaq, irniaruaq, sugaq, sugaruaq, suguaq in Yup'ik, cugaq, cugaruaq in Cup'ik, cuucunguar in Cup'ig) <b>are</b> <b>dressed</b> in {{traditional}} Eskimo style clothing, {{intended to protect}} the wearer from cold weather, and are often made from traditional materials obtained through food gathering. Play dolls from the Yup'ik area were made of driftwood, bone, or walrus ivory and measured from one to twelve inches in height or more. Some human figurines were used by shamans. Dolls also mediated the transition between childhood and adulthood in the Yup'ik shamanism.|$|E
25|$|In the Philippines, many {{families}} keep {{a tradition in}} which an old man, a young lady, and a small boy are chosen from among the poor and <b>are</b> <b>dressed</b> up as Saint Joseph, the Virgin Mary, and the child Jesus, respectively. They are then seated around a table set with the family's best silverware and china, and served a variety of courses, sometimes being literally spoon-fed by the {{senior members of the}} family, while the Novena to Saint Joseph is recited at a nearby temporary altar.|$|E
500|$|Aboard the ship, Yates {{gave the}} {{characters}} their own distinct looks. Theron <b>is</b> <b>dressed</b> in an ice-silver, silk mohair suit. Yates said, [...] " [...] is the ice queen. It was always our vision {{to make her}} look as sculptural as possible". Fassbender's David <b>is</b> <b>dressed</b> similarly to other crew members, but his outfit was given finer lines to produce a more linear appearance. To create a casual, relaxed appearance, Marshall-Green's Holloway <b>was</b> <b>dressed</b> in hoodies, fisherman pants, and flip-flops, while Elba wore a canvas-greased jacket to represent his long career {{at the helm of}} a ship.|$|R
