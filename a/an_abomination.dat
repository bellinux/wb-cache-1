5|$|For many centuries, {{the people}} within the Nri hegemony were {{committed}} to peace. This religious pacifism was rooted in a belief that violence was <b>an</b> <b>abomination</b> which polluted the earth. Instead, the eze Nri could declare a form of excommunication from the odinani Nri against those who violated specific taboos. Members of the Ikénga could isolate entire communities via this form of ritual siege.|$|E
5|$|In Vagrant Story, the Iocus priesthood of {{the kingdom}} of Valendia is shown to use the Kildean rood as a symbol, {{although}} they follow the teachings of a saint named Iocus instead of the original Kildean teachings of the Kiltia religion of Leá Monde. Müllenkamp, founder of the city of Leá Monde featured in the story, used to be a priestess of Kiltia, and bore the rood on her back. The followers of St. Iocus are outwardly intolerant of magic, seeing it as <b>an</b> <b>abomination,</b> and yet its higher members continue to use it behind the scenes. This hypocrisy is revealed {{over the course of the}} story, though it goes unresolved.|$|E

Radiaro and Calafia issue a challenge to two Christian warriors to engage them in single combat for the purpose of deciding the battle. King Amadis and his son Esplandián accept the challenge. The black-skinned warrior woman chosen as messenger tells Calafia that Esplandián is the most handsome and elegant man that has ever existed. Calafia determines that she must see the man herself before engaging him in combat. She stays awake all night wondering whether to wear royal robes or warrior's armor. Deciding in favor of a thick golden toga embroidered with jewels, topped by a golden hood, she rode to meet her enemies, escorted by 2,000 women warriors. After being seated among the Christian kings, she immediately recognized Esplandián from his great beauty, {{and fell in love with}} him. She tells him she will meet him on the field of battle and, if they should live, that she wishes to speak further with him. Esplandián considers Calafia an infidel, <b>an</b> <b>abomination</b> of the rightfully subservient position of woman in relation to man, and he makes no response.|$|E

25|$|Other Protestant groups took a {{different}} attitude, with most Anabaptists, Quakers, Congregationalists and Presbyterian Puritans regarding such festivals as <b>an</b> <b>abomination.</b> The Puritan rejection of Easter traditions was (and is) based partly upon their interpretation of 2 Corinthians 6:14–16 and partly upon a more general belief that, if a religious practice or celebration is not actually written in the Christian Bible, then that practice/celebration must be a later development and cannot be considered an authentic part of Christian practice or belief—so at best simply unnecessary, at worst actually sinful.|$|E

Realizing Taras is still in Cannon's body, Vana tries to undo the experiment, hopefully getting things right this time. As this is going on, Lara sneaks in and frees Aspen and Sara.

25|$|This {{area was}} {{primarily}} a bazaar, with vendors selling souvenirs, sacrificial animals, food, as well as currency changers, exchanging Roman for Tyrian money because the Jews {{were not allowed to}} coin their own money and they viewed Roman currency as <b>an</b> <b>abomination</b> to the Lord, as also mentioned in the New Testament account of Jesus and the Money Changers when Jerusalem was packed with Jews who had come for Passover, perhaps numbering 300,000 to 400,000 pilgrims.

25|$|The Child of Thorns, Chise's {{master and}} fiancé, once apprenticed to Master Lindenbaum. A being with both fae and human elements, his origins are a mystery. Known as the Thorn Sorcerer, the other faeries {{see him as}} <b>an</b> <b>abomination,</b> {{something}} he does not mind. Besides using glamour to hide his appearance, he can control and also turn himself into shadows, and when angry enough, he takes on a more monstrous form. He can even change his head to a human’s using magic. Despite claiming to lack human emotions, after some time caring for Chise he has slowly developed a true fondness for her. However, his innate lack of understanding certain human emotions makes Lindenbaum call him a child. He dislikes children. He says {{they do not have}} magic powers, but they are talented in being able to see the true nature of things, so sometimes he is found out. He is called “Pilum Murialis” by the wizards.|$|E
25|$|While often formal, Seymour hides {{a twisted}} desire to save Spira by {{becoming}} Sin and destroying the world. This resulted from his father's treatment {{who had his}} wife and son exiled to the island of Baaj since Seymour was considered <b>an</b> <b>abomination</b> by the Guados. Afterwards, Seymour's mother gave her life in the Baaj Temple to become the fayth of the aeon Anima, believing that by sacrificing herself for Spira's temporary peace against Sin, her son will be accepted by Spira's people. At eighteen years of age, Seymour's exile was revoked and he soon killed Jyscal and took his position. He asks summoner Yuna to marry him, seemingly to further unite Spira, as they both have mixed parentage, being the offspring of a human and another race. When Yuna's guardians learn of Seymour's motives, they stand against him and kill him. Seymour's spirit is able to remain in the living world and become an unsent. Seymour later reveals his plans for Yuna – to have her turn him into the next Sin. His pyreflies are later absorbed by Sin. There, Seymour begins seeking a means to control the creature from within. During this process, he is confronted a final time by Yuna and her guardians, who manage to break their way inside the creature's body. However, he is defeated and is sent to the Farplane by Yuna.|$|E

[...] The Numismatist, in March and May 1913 editorials, gave the new coin a lukewarm review, suggesting that the Indian's head be reduced in size and the bison be eliminated from the reverse.|$|E

Marlo soon uses her connection to Death to bring Doc Samson, Jarella, Hiroim, and Rebecca Banner back from the dead to help the Hulks in their fight against <b>a</b> resurrected <b>Abomination,</b> <b>a</b> Zom-possessed Doctor Strange, and the forces of Amatsu-Mikaboshi.

I believe one may be satisfied". One dissident voice was that of Friedrich Nietzsche, once a devoted friend of Wagner's but latterly a harsh critic. Nietzsche considered Parsifal <b>an</b> <b>abomination</b> for which Cosima was responsible; she had corrupted Wagner, and as a non-German she had no business meddling in matters of German culture.|$|E
