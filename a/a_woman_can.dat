5|$|Men have a {{unilateral}} right to divorce their wives (talaq) without needing any legal justification. The divorce is effective immediately. The husband's obligation is then to provide {{financial support for}} the divorced wife {{for a period of}} four months and ten days. <b>A</b> <b>woman</b> <b>can</b> only obtain a divorce with the consent of her husband or judicially if her husband has harmed her. In practice, it is very difficult for a Saudi woman to obtain a judicial divorce. The divorce rate is high, with 50% of marriages being dissolved. In the event of divorce, fathers have automatic custody of sons from the age of 7 and daughters from the age of 9. The right for men to marry up to four wives, combined with their ability to divorce a wife at any time without cause, can translate to unlimited polygamy. King Abdul Aziz, the founder of the country, reportedly admitted to marrying over two hundred women. However, his polygamy was considered extraordinary even by Saudi Arabian standards.|$|E
25|$|Within cultures, {{honor is}} an {{important}} and highly esteemed theme. It can be maintained through living up to one's word and promises, providing for the family, and keeping a certain social status. Honor can be affected by {{both men and women}} through ways in which a man heightens his family's honorable status, and <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>can</b> shame her family through disapproved actions. Ensuing constant pressure to uphold her family's honor, <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>can</b> suffer psychological and social damage.|$|E
25|$|As {{followers}} of Torah exclusively, the Karaite Jews say that <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>can</b> claim a divorce. If a man refuses to give divorce to his wife, the beit din (Jewish legal court) may exercise its legal power to grant a divorce instead. Consequently, {{there are no}} agunot in Karaite Judaism.|$|E

25|$|The Tennessee Marriage Protection Amendment, {{also known}} as Tennessee Amendment 1 of 2006, is a state {{constitutional}} amendment banning same-sex unions. The referendum was approved by 81% of voters. It specifies that only a marriage {{between a man and}} <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>can</b> be legally recognized in the state of Tennessee. This effectively prohibits same-sex marriages within the state, reinforcing previously existing statutes to the same effect. The amendment was overturned by the Obergefell v. Hodges ruling in June 2015.|$|E
25|$|Barr took a lead in {{legislative}} debate concerning same-sex marriage.

At the 2008 Libertarian National Convention, he apologized for the part of the Defense of Marriage Act which prevents the federal government from recognizing same-sex marriages.|$|E

The amendment was approved by 81% of Tennesseans participating in the vote, which was 30.91% of eligible voters that year.

25|$|A man {{may only}} take a second wife if a judge authorizes it, and only {{if there is an}} {{exceptional}} and objective justification for it, the first wife consents, and the man has sufficient resources to support the two families and guarantee all maintenance rights, accommodation and equality in all aspects of life. Moreover, <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>can</b> stipulate in her marriage contract that her husband may not take a second wife, and a first wife must consent to the second. The first wife may also petition for divorce if the husband takes another wife.|$|E
25|$|A {{receiving}} woman's {{legs and}} arms are generally free to move about, though her position and movement may be constrained by the penetrating partner's weight and in some other way. <b>A</b> <b>woman</b> <b>can</b> adjust the position of her legs for comfort, variety and to control the angle and depth of penetration. Generally, the higher a woman's legs, the deeper is the penetration. When the legs are raised in any way, the woman has less control of the rhythm of thrusts. Also, raising the legs raises the woman's pelvis, reduces the angle of penetration, and lowers the level of clitoral stimulation.|$|E

25|$|Although authors give many {{examples}} of male witchery {{in the second part}} of the handbook, those witchcraft trials that are independently confirmed and that were led by Kramer himself are related to persecution of women almost exclusively. They took place in Ravensburg near Constance (1484) and Innsbruck (since 1485). According to Brauner, trial records confirm that Kramer believed that women are by nature corrupt and evil. His position was in harmony with the scholastic theory at the time. In contrast, Sprenger never conducted a witch trial though he was consulted in a few cases. Kramer and Sprenger use a metaphor of a world turned upside down by women of which concubines are the most wicked, followed by midwives and then by wives who dominate their husbands. Authors warn of imminent arrival of the apocalypse foretold in the Bible and that men risk bewitchment that leads to impotence and sensation of castration. Brauner explains authors' prescription on how <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>can</b> avoid becoming a witch: According to the Malleus, the only way <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>can</b> avoid succumbing to her passions – and becoming a witch – is to embrace a life of devout chastity in a religious retreat. But the monastic life is reserved to the spiritually gifted few. Therefore, most women are doomed to become witches, who cannot be redeemed; and the only recourse open to the authorities is to ferret out and exterminate all witches.|$|E
25|$|Women face {{discrimination}} in the courts, where the testimony of one man equals that of two women in family and inheritance law. Polygamy is permitted for men, and men have a unilateral right to divorce their wives (talaq) without needing any legal justification. <b>A</b> <b>woman</b> <b>can</b> only obtain a divorce {{with the consent of}} her husband or judicially if her husband has harmed her. In practice, it is very difficult for a Saudi woman to obtain a judicial divorce. With regard to the law of inheritance, the Quran specifies that fixed portions of the deceased's estate must be left to the Qur'anic heirs and generally, female heirs receive half the portion of male heirs.|$|E
25|$|Most {{babies are}} born head first; however about 4% are born feet or buttock first, known as breech. During labour <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>can</b> {{generally}} eat and move around as she likes, but pushing is not recommended during the first stage or during delivery of the head, and enemas are not recommended. While making a cut {{to the opening of}} the vagina, known as an episiotomy is common, it is generally not needed. In 2012, about 23 million deliveries occurred by a surgical procedure known as Caesarean section. Caesarean sections may be recommended for twins, signs of distress in the baby, or breech position. This method of delivery can take longer to heal from.|$|E

25|$|Pro-choice campaigners {{highlighted}} at {{the time}} that the lack of legislation clarifying the limited circumstances in which abortion is legal in Ireland contributed to Halapanavar's death. Several rallies and vigils were organised nationwide, calling for the Irish government to legislate in relation to abortion on the basis of the X Case Attorney General v. X. Campaigners argued that legislation remained outstanding {{at the time}} of Halappanavar's death despite the European Court of Human Rights having instructed the state to clarify its laws on abortion after finding in A, B and C v Ireland (2010) that the Republic of Ireland had violated the Convention by failing to provide an accessible and effective procedure by which <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>can</b> have established whether she qualifies for a legal abortion under current Irish law.|$|E
25|$|The {{appearance}} of cervical mucus and vulvar sensation are generally described together as {{two ways of}} observing the same sign. Cervical mucus is produced by the cervix, which connects the uterus to the vaginal canal. Fertile cervical mucus promotes sperm life by decreasing the acidity of the vagina, and also it helps guide sperm through the cervix and into the uterus. The production of fertile cervical mucus is caused by estrogen, the same hormone that prepares a woman's body for ovulation. By observing her cervical mucus and {{paying attention to the}} sensation as it passes the vulva, <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>can</b> detect when her body is gearing up for ovulation, and also when ovulation has passed. When ovulation occurs, estrogen production drops slightly and progesterone starts to rise. The rise in progesterone causes a distinct change in {{the quantity and quality of}} mucus observed at the vulva.|$|E
25|$|During sexual intercourse, {{most women}} {{experience}} involuntary vaginal contractions. The contraction causes the pelvic muscles to tighten around the penis, {{which in turn}} increases the level of her partner's arousal and sexual frenzy and results in the man increasing the pace and force of thrusts as he approaches orgasm; which in turn further increases the woman's vaginal contraction. After a man has achieved orgasm, he will normally collapse onto the woman and will normally not be capable of further thrusting. Some men try to control their orgasm until their female partner also orgasms, {{but this is not}} always achieved. At times, <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>can</b> achieve orgasm after the man has ceased thrusting by contracting her vaginal muscles and with pelvic movements, or the couple may change to another position that enables the woman to continue thrusting until she has reached orgasm, such as a woman on top position.|$|E
