5|$|In post-Second World War London, an {{unexploded bomb}} detonates in Miramont Gardens, Pimlico. The {{explosion}} reveals a buried cellar containing artwork, coins, jewellery and an ancient manuscript. The document is <b>authenticated</b> by the historian Professor Hatton-Jones as a royal charter of Edward IV that ceded {{a house and}} its estates to Charles VII, the last Duke of Burgundy, when he sought refuge there after being presumed dead at the 1477 Battle of Nancy. As the charter had never been revoked, an area of Pimlico is declared to still be a legal part of Burgundy.|$|E
5|$|Red foxes may prey on {{domestic}} rabbits and guinea pigs {{if they are}} kept in open runs or are allowed to range freely in gardens. This problem is usually averted by housing them in robust hutches and runs. Urban foxes frequently encounter cats and may feed alongside them. In physical confrontations, the cats usually have the upper hand. <b>Authenticated</b> cases of foxes killing cats usually involve kittens. Although most foxes do not prey on cats, some may do so, and may treat them more as competitors rather than food.|$|E

5|$|Connoisseurship in {{the late}} Ming period {{centered}} on these items of refined artistic taste, which provided work for art dealers and even underground scammers who themselves made imitations and false attributions. The Jesuit Matteo Ricci while staying in Nanjing wrote that Chinese scam artists were ingenious at making forgeries and huge profits. However, there were guides to help the wary new connoisseur; Liu Tong (died 1637) wrote a book printed in 1635 that told his readers how to spot fake and authentic pieces of art. He revealed that a Xuande era (1426–1435) bronzework could be <b>authenticated</b> by judging its sheen; porcelain wares from the Yongle era (1402–1424) could be judged authentic by their thickness.|$|E
5|$|FootTown's {{third and}} fourth floors house several tourist attractions. The third floor {{is home to the}} Guinness World Records Museum Tokyo, a museum that houses life-size figures, photo panels and memorabilia {{depicting}} interesting records that have been <b>authenticated</b> by the Guinness Book. The Tokyo Tower Wax Museum, opened in 1970, displays wax figures imported from London where they were made. The figures on display range from pop culture icons such as The Beatles to religious figures such as Jesus Christ. A hologram gallery named the Gallery DeLux, a lounge and a few specialty stores are also located on this floor. Tokyo Tower's Trick Art Gallery is located on the building's fourth and final floor. This gallery displays optical illusions, including paintings and objects that visitors can interact with.|$|E

Intuitively, a terrorist fraud attack is successful if the adversary is successful in <b>authenticating</b> with the prover's help, but not without it.|$|R
30|$|During {{the above}} process, since Sn does not <b>authenticate</b> the user, Sn {{directly}} generates <b>authenticating</b> request message for GW to <b>authenticate</b> the user. When GW receives this request message, GW can finish the process from Step 1 to Step 4 of authentication phase (GW <b>authenticates</b> Sn and U). This {{is because there}} is no mechanism for Sn to be assured that U is real user of WSNs. Thus, the Wenbo’s protocol does not provide mutual authentication between U and Sn. There is no full mutual authentication between Sn and U. This protocol cannot reject DoS attack to Sn and GW.|$|R

5|$|From South Asia in general, {{there is}} secure {{evidence}} of such early settlement. Although not regarded as an anatomically modern Homo sapiens, a skull from the Central Narmada Valley in Madhya Pradesh, India, referred to as Narmada Man, is the first <b>authenticated</b> discovery of a late Middle Pleistocene (around 200,000 BP) hominid from South Asia. The discovery has sparked much debate regarding where it belongs in the taxonomic organisation of Pleicestone hominids. Its morphometric traits do not easily match those of Homo erectus, but they correlate with hominid specimens called archaic Homo sapiens, which include pre-Neanderthals from Europe and West Asia. Other classifications of the skull include Homo heidelbergensis and evolved Homo erectus, but the latter has been disputed by some as having no taxonomic meaning.|$|E
5|$|In February 1828, Martin Harris {{arrived to}} assist Smith by transcribing his dictation. Harris {{also took a}} sample of the {{characters}} to a few prominent scholars, including Charles Anthon. Harris said Anthon initially <b>authenticated</b> the characters and their translation, but then retracted his opinion after learning that Smith claimed to have received the plates from an angel. Anthon denied Harris's account of the meeting, claiming instead that he had tried to convince Harris that he was the victim of a fraud. In any event, Harris returned to Harmony in April 1828, and continued as Smith's scribe.|$|E
5|$|In United States v. Amedy (1826), the Court {{held that}} the federal {{criminal}} insurance fraud statute was no subjected to the same formalities as civil insurance fraud claims. First, the Court {{held that the}} state statute of incorporation of the insurance company required {{no more than the}} state's seal to be <b>authenticated.</b> Second, {{there was no need to}} prove the existence of the insurance company (i.e., that its stock had actually been subscribed) because it was not a party. Nor was it necessary to prove that the policy would have been binding against the insurance company. Nor did it matter whether the policy would have paid out under the circumstances of the fraud. Finally, it was held that an insurance corporation was a person within the meaning of the statute.|$|E
50|$|Mutual {{authentication}} or {{two-way authentication}} (sometimes written as 2WAY authentication) refers to two parties <b>authenticating</b> each other suitably. In technology terms, {{it refers to}} a client or user <b>authenticating</b> themselves to a server and that server <b>authenticating</b> itself to the user {{in such a way}} that both parties are assured of the others' identity.

5|$|Indigenous peoples {{living in}} northeastern North America {{were the first}} groups known to have {{produced}} maple syrup and maple sugar. According to aboriginal oral traditions, as well as archaeological evidence, maple tree sap was being processed into syrup long before Europeans arrived in the region. There are no <b>authenticated</b> accounts of how maple syrup production and consumption began, but various legends exist; {{one of the most}} popular involves maple sap being used in place of water to cook venison served to a chief. Other stories credit the development of maple syrup production to Nanabozho, Glooskap, or the squirrel. Aboriginal tribes developed rituals around sugar-making, celebrating the Sugar Moon (the first full moon of spring) with a Maple Dance. Many aboriginal dishes replaced the salt traditional in European cuisine with maple sugar or syrup.|$|E
5|$|On July 29, 2014, C-SPAN {{announced}} that it would begin restricting access to the live feeds of the main channel, C-SPAN2 and C-SPAN3 to subscribers of cable or satellite providers later that summer, citing concerns with the slow shift in viewing habits from cable television to the internet due to its reliance on carriage fees from cable and satellite providers. However, it will continue to allow all government meetings, hearings and conferences to be streamed live online and via archived on the C-SPAN Video Library without requiring an <b>authenticated</b> login by a provider. The decision drew some criticism from public interest and government transparency advocates, citing the fact that C-SPAN was designed as a public service.|$|E

Usually, no user credentials {{are required to}} <b>authenticate</b> the UAC prompt in administrator accounts but <b>authenticating</b> the UAC prompt requires entering the username and password of an administrator in standard user accounts. In Windows XP (and earlier systems) administrator accounts, authentication {{is not required to}} run a process with elevated privileges and this poses another security risk that {{led to the development of}} UAC. Users can set a process to run with elevated privileges from standard accounts by setting the process to [...] "run as administrator" [...] or using the [...] "runas" [...] command and <b>authenticating</b> the prompt with credentials (username and password) of an administrator account.
