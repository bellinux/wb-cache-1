40|$|Abstract. Typical {{tasks of}} multi agent systems are {{effective}} coordination of single agents and their cooperation. Especially in dynamic environments, like the RoboCup soccer domain, {{the uncertainty of}} an opponent’s team behavior complicates coordinated team action. This paper presents a novel approach for intuitive multi agent <b>plan</b> construction and <b>adaptive</b> <b>plan</b> selection to attempt these tasks. We introduce a tool designed to represent plans like in tactical playbooks in human soccer which allows easy plan construction, editing and managing. Further we introduce a technique that provides <b>adaptive</b> <b>plan</b> selection in offensive situations by evaluating effectiveness of plans and their actions with statistically interpreted results to improve a team’s style of play. Using experts as a concept for abstracting information about a team’s interaction with another, makes fast accommodated plan selection possible.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} a model-based statistical methodology to design <b>adaptive</b> inspection <b>plans</b> for the geometric control of mechanical parts with Coordinate Measuring Machines (CMM). The inspection is adaptive because {{the design and}} measurement phases are not separate in time, as they usually are. Rather, they are carried out in a combined way: first designing the next measurement location, then measuring at that location and so on. This strategy is most informative as it allows for the exploitation {{of all of the}} currently available measurements. The next measurement point is selected by using predictions and prediction uncertainty of geometric deviations provided by non-parametric statistical models, known as kriging models. Based on stationary Gaussian stochastic processes, their merit is the ability to vary flexibly at each added point. The methodology is demonstrated in an illustrative case study, then its performance is compared to that of two statistical non <b>adaptive</b> <b>plans,</b> and two deterministic <b>adaptive</b> <b>plans</b> proposed in the literature. In each comparison kriging-based plans have proved to be superior in terms of the accuracy of the predicted geometric error and the inspection cost. The method is sufficiently general to enable technology transfer to different metrological sectors. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

This project has assembled an <b>adaptive</b> management <b>plan</b> for the Natural Lands Section of Morris Arboretum. The framework for an <b>adaptive</b> management <b>plan</b> includes the following steps: (1) assessment of the current status of the site; (2) determination of future desired conditions with measurable objectives; (3) design and implementation of ways to accomplish desired objectives; and (4) monitoring and evaluation.

40|$|Efficient {{methods have}} been {{proposed}} in the literature {{for the management of}} a set of railway maintenance operations. However, these methods consider maintenance operations as deterministic and known a priori. In the stochastic tactical railway maintenance problem (STRMP), maintenance operations are not known in advance. In fact, since future track conditions can only be predicted, maintenance operations become stochastic. STRMP is based on a rolling horizon. For each month of the rolling horizon, an <b>adaptive</b> <b>plan</b> must be addressed. Each <b>adaptive</b> <b>plan</b> becomes deterministic, since it consists of a particular subproblem of the whole STRMP. Nevertheless, an exact resolution of each plan along the rolling horizon would be too time-consuming. Therefore, a heuristic approach that can provide efficient solutions within a reasonable computational time is required. Although STRMP has already been introduced in the literature, little work has been done in terms of solution methods and computational results. The main contributions of this paper include new methodology developments, a linear model for the deterministic subproblem, three efficient heuristics for the fast and effective resolution of each deterministic subproblem, and extensive computational results...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} {{the potential for}} reduction in normal tissue irradiation by creating a patient specific planning target volume (PTV) using cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) imaging acquired {{in the first week}} of radiotherapy for patients receiving radical radiotherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients receiving radical RT for carcinoma of the esophagus were investigated. The PTV is defined as CTV(tumor, nodes) plus esophagus outlined 3 to 5 cm cranio-caudally and a 1. 5 -cm circumferential margin is added (clinical plan). Prefraction CBCT are acquired on Days 1 to 4, then weekly. No correction for setup error made. The images are imported into the planning system. The tumor and esophagus for the length of the PTV are contoured on each CBCT and 5 mm margin is added. A composite volume (PTV 1) is created using Week 1 composite CBCT volumes. The same process is repeated using CBCT Week 2 to 6 (PTV 2). A new plan is created using PTV 1 (<b>adaptive</b> <b>plan).</b> The coverage of the 95 % isodose of PTV 1 is evaluated on PTV 2. Dose-volume histograms (DVH) for lungs, heart, and cord for two plans are compared. RESULTS: A total of 139 CBCT for 14 cases were analyzed. For the <b>adaptive</b> <b>plan</b> the coverage of the 95 % prescription isodose for PTV 1 = 95. 6 % +/- 4 % and the PTV 2 = 96. 8 % +/- 4. 1 % (t test, 0. 19). Lungs V 20 (15. 6 Gy vs. 10. 2 Gy) and heart mean dose (26. 9 Gy vs. 20. 7 Gy) were significantly smaller for the <b>adaptive</b> <b>plan.</b> CONCLUSIONS: A reduced planning volume can be constructed with{{in the first week of}} treatment using CBCT.

50|$|In {{the period}} between 1965 and 1969 were formed two of the leading project {{management}} associations: the International Project Management Association (IPMA) in Europe, and the Project Management Institute (PMI) which trains project management professionals and issues certificates. With business shifting towards technology-based and paperless methods, the first project management systems started to emerge. Oracle and Artemis launched their project managers in 1977, while Scitor Corporation did the same in 1979. Many improvements followed in the upcoming decades: In 1986, Carnegie Mellon University’s Software Engineering Institute introduced Capability Maturity Software, a five-level project management method for rapidly maturing processes, while in 1988 users met Earned Value Management which added processes’ scope and cost to the schedule. The trend continued with PRINCE2 (1996) which {{increased the number of}} processes to seven, because of which developers considered designing products for managing complex projects.

With Agile the requirements and design phases overlap with development, thus reducing the development cycles for faster delivery. It promotes <b>adaptive</b> <b>planning,</b> evolutionary development and delivery, a time-boxed iterative approach, and encourages rapid and flexible response to change. Agile BI encourages business users and IT professionals to think about their data differently and it characterized by low Total Cost of Change (TCC).

First of all, COW systems {{are all about}} communicating relevant information (such as hazards and controls, roles, and responsibilities) to all personnel involved. Using a digital solution allows users to more easily access and share this information with necessary stakeholders, {{as well as to}} continually be aware of changes. Secondly, possible conflicts between permits are now flagged and managed automatically, reducing or even mitigating the possibility of conflicting work occurring. Thirdly, digital COW providers offer functionality to visually represent permits on a graphical overview in the control room, greatly increasing situational awareness and knowledge of what is being done where. [...] However, what makes these solutions even more powerful, is integration with existent critical IT systems. For example, the COW software can pull maintenance information (such as equipment trees and work orders) from leading Maintenance Management and Enterprise Resource Planning systems to streamline PTW processes and ensure the correct equipment and location information is included in permits, risk assessments and isolation plans. Also, live plant data can be integrated into the PTW process through connections with Plant Information systems, giving the user real-time insight into various critical data points. Furthermore, integration with planning solutions such as Oracle Primavera allow for smart and <b>adaptive</b> <b>planning</b> of shutdowns and turnarounds. [...] Using an integrated and connected COW solution enables companies to leverage various data into their most important maintenance processes, enabling major increases in Hands on Tool Time, improving the quality of work, reducing risk, bolstering situational awareness and streamlining procedures.|$|E
40|$|There is {{increasing}} interest in long-term plans that can adapt to changing situations {{under conditions of}} deep uncertainty. We argue that a sustainable plan should not only achieve economic, environmental, and social objectives, but should be robust and able to be adapted over time to (unforeseen) future conditions. Large numbers of papers dealing with robustness and <b>adaptive</b> <b>plans</b> have begun to appear, but the literature is fragmented. The papers appear in disparate journals, and deal {{with a wide variety}} of policy domains. This paper (1) describes and compares a family of related conceptual approaches to designing a sustainable plan, and (2) describes several computational tools supporting these approaches. The conceptual approaches all have their roots in an approach to longterm planning called Assumption-Based Planning. Guiding principles for the design of a sustainable <b>adaptive</b> <b>plan</b> are: explore a wide variety of relevant uncertainties, connect short-term targets to long-term goals over time, commit to short-term actions while keeping options open, and continuously monitor the world and take actions if necessary.

40|$|To {{reduce the}} {{high risk of}} {{radiation}} toxicity and {{enhance the quality of}} life of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), we quantified the metabolic tumor volumes (MTVs) from baseline to the late-course of radiotherapy (RT) by fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography computerized tomography (FDG PET-CT) and discussed the potential benefit of late-course <b>adaptive</b> <b>plans</b> rather than original plans by dose volume histogram (DVH) comparisons. Seventeen patients with stage II-III NSCLC who were treated with definitive conventionally fractionated RT were eligible for this prospective study. FDG PET-CT scans were acquired within 1 week before RT (pre-RT) and at approximately two-thirds of the total dose during-RT (approximately 40 Gy). MTVs were taken as gross tumor volumes (GTVs) that included the primary tumor and any involved hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes. An original plan based on the baseline MTVs and <b>adaptive</b> <b>plans</b> based on observations during-RT MTVs were generated for each patient. The DVHs for lung, heart, esophagus and spinal cord were compared between the original plans and composite plans at 66 Gy. At the time of approximately 40 Gy during-RT, MTVs were significantly reduced in patients with NSCLC (pre-RT 136. 2 ± 82. 3 ml vs. during-RT 64. 7 ± 68. 0 ml, p = 0. 001). The composite plan of the original plan at 40 Gy plus the <b>adaptive</b> <b>plan</b> at 26 Gy resulted in better DVHs for all the organs at risk that were evaluated compared to the original plan at 66 Gy (p< 0. 05), including V 5, V 10, V 15, V 20, V 25, V 30 and the mean dose of total lung, V 10, V 20, V 30, V 40, V 50, V 60 and the mean dose of heart, V 35, V 40, V 50, V 55, V 60, the maximum dose and mean dose of the esophagus, and the maximum dose of the spinal-cord. PET-MTVs were reduced significantly at the time of approximately 40 Gy during-RT.
