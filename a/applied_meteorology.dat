5|$|In the UK {{there were}} 124 {{separate}} occasions from 2008 to 2010 when the nation's wind output fell {{to less than}} 2% of installed capacity. A report on Denmark's wind power noted that their wind power network provided less than 1% of average demand on 54 days during the year 2002. Wind power advocates argue that these periods of low wind {{can be dealt with}} by simply restarting existing power stations that have been held in readiness, or interlinking with HVDC. Electrical grids with slow-responding thermal power plants and without ties to networks with hydroelectric generation may have to limit the use of wind power. According to a 2007 Stanford University study published in the Journal of <b>Applied</b> <b>Meteorology</b> and Climatology, interconnecting ten or more wind farms can allow an average of 33% of the total energy produced (i.e. about 8% of total nameplate capacity) to be used as reliable, baseload electric power which can be relied on to handle peak loads, as long as minimum criteria are met for wind speed and turbine height.|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} calculating the global entropy {{production}} of the climate system is revisited. In the first place, means to set forth the entropy production due to absorption and emission of electromagnetic radiation are recalled. Some recent formulae to estimate the global entropy production are exposed as ill-founded, in spite of correct earlier treatments based on Planck's classic theory. A conceptual model of climate is used to ease the discussion of some pertinent rates that have been proposed. Formal simplicity may be achieved {{by the introduction of}} radiation temperatures put forward in recent years, so as to express the density of the entropy production rates in energy exchanges between matter and radiation as simple bilinear forms. It is argued that the Clausius-Duhem inequality of continuum mechanics, widely <b>applied</b> in <b>meteorology,</b> insufficiently represents the planetary thermodynamics when radiation fields play a role.
