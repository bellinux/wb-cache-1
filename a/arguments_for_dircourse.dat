25|$|Oral {{arguments}} {{in this case}} (as well as its companion case) occurred on November 7, 2006. U.S. Solicitor General Paul Clement, presented <b>arguments</b> <b>for</b> the United States, and Priscilla Smith presented <b>arguments</b> <b>for</b> Dr. Carhart et al. Solicitor General Clement also presented <b>arguments</b> <b>for</b> the United States in the companion case of Gonzales v. Planned Parenthood. Eve Gartner presented <b>arguments</b> <b>for</b> Planned Parenthood. The Supreme Court has made available audio of the oral arguments, in both Carhart and Planned Parenthood.|$|R
50|$|McLeod’s {{writings}} {{center on}} <b>arguments</b> <b>for</b> {{the existence of}} God, the legitimacy of Christianity as the only path to God, and {{the authenticity of the}} Bible. In A Well Reasoned Faith: A Rational Defense of God, Jesus and the Bible (2011), <b>arguments</b> <b>for</b> the existence of God are made on the cosmological, teleological and moral <b>arguments.</b> <b>Arguments</b> <b>for</b> Christianity are made using logical reasoning, historical evidence, eyewitness testimony, and archaeology. <b>Arguments</b> <b>for</b> the authenticity of the bible come from applying the bibliographical, internal and external tests.|$|R
40|$|In two {{excellent}} recent papers, Jacob Ross {{has argued}} that the standard <b>arguments</b> <b>for</b> the ‘thirder’ answer to the Sleeping Beauty puzzle lead to violations of countable additivity. The problem is that most <b>arguments</b> <b>for</b> that answer generalise in awkward ways when he looks at the whole class of what he calls Sleeping Beauty problems. In this note I develop a new <b>argument</b> <b>for</b> the thirder answer that doesn't generalise in this way...|$|R
40|$|The {{message of}} this paper is that the global {{financial}} crisis that started in August 2007 provides another powerful and sufficient <b>argument</b> <b>for</b> the United Kingdom to join the EMU and adopt the euro as soon as technically possible. This new financial stability <b>argument</b> <b>for</b> UK membership in the EMU is separate from and in addition to the conventional optimal currency <b>arguments</b> <b>for</b> joining, which have also become more persuasive in the past few years...|$|R

Forcehimes {{argues that}} {{the way we think}} about {{copyrights}} is inconsistent, because every <b>argument</b> <b>for</b> (physical) public libraries is also an <b>argument</b> <b>for</b> stealing ebooks and every argument against stealing ebooks would also be an argument against libraries.|$|R
5000|$|The {{principle}} of alternate possibilities (acronym PAP) forms {{part of an}} influential <b>argument</b> <b>for</b> the incompatibility of responsibility and causal determinism, often called the core <b>argument</b> <b>for</b> incompatibilism.

40|$|This chapter {{presents}} {{a response to}} Chapter 25 ’s account of self-determination and the human right to democracy. It suggests that the chapter’s <b>argument</b> <b>for</b> the human right to democracy fails {{because it does not}} sufficiently address the justificatory challenge that human rights face. It contrasts the justice-based <b>argument</b> <b>for</b> a human right to democracy with a legitimacy-based <b>argument</b> <b>for</b> a human right to political participation. It discusses the implications of this right to political participation for self-determination in the final section...|$|R

50|$|The major <b>argument</b> <b>for</b> using {{synthetic}} filesystems {{might be}} the flexibility and easy access to service-oriented architectures.

Many general <b>arguments</b> <b>for</b> SOAs also apply here.|$|R

40|$|This paper reviews briefly the <b>arguments</b> <b>for</b> {{capital market}} liberalization, and {{identifies}} their {{theoretical and empirical}} weaknesses. This provides the foundations <b>for</b> the <b>argument</b> <b>for</b> intervention in short-term capital flows.

50|$|Putnam {{presented}} {{a variety of}} <b>arguments</b> <b>for</b> the externalist position, the most famous being those that concerned Twin Earth. Subsequent philosophers have produced other, related thought experiments, most notably Donald Davidson's swamp man experiment. However, {{there have been numerous}} <b>arguments</b> <b>for</b> externalism that do not involve science-fiction scenarios.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} I present {{a new way}} of {{understanding}} Dutch Book Arguments: the idea is that an agent is shown to be incoherent iff (s) he would accept as fair a set of bets that would result in a loss under any interpretation of the claims involved. This draws on a standard definition of logical inconsistency. On this new understanding, the Dutch Book <b>Arguments</b> <b>for</b> the probability axioms go through, but the Dutch Book <b>Argument</b> <b>for</b> Reflection fails. The question of whether we have a Dutch Book <b>Argument</b> <b>for</b> Conditionalization is left open...|$|R
40|$|I {{present an}} <b>argument</b> <b>for</b> the {{existence}} of nonconceptual representational content. The argument is compatible with McDowell's defence of conceptualism against those <b>arguments</b> <b>for</b> nonconceptual content that draw upon claims about the fine-grainedness of experience. I present a case for nonconceptual content that concentrates {{on the idea that}} experience can possess representational content that cannot perform the function of conceptual content, namely figure in the subject's reasons for belief and action. This sort of <b>argument</b> <b>for</b> nonconceptual content is best achieved with examples from auditory perception, especially our perception of music...|$|R
40|$|The no-miracles {{argument}} and the pessimistic induction are currently {{regarded as the}} strongest <b>arguments</b> <b>for</b> and against scientific realism, respectively, in philosophy of science. In this paper, I construct a new <b>argument</b> <b>for</b> scientific realism that I call the anti-induction for scientific realism. It holds that since past theories were unwarranted, present theories are warranted. I provide an example {{from the history of}} science to show that anti-inductions sometimes work in science. The anti-induction for scientific realism has several advantages over the no-miracles argument as a positive <b>argument</b> <b>for</b> scientific realism...|$|R
40|$|The {{question}} 'Is cognition linguistic?' divides recent cognitive theories {{into two}} antagonistic groups. Sententialists claim {{that we think}} in some language, while advocates of non-linguistic views of cognition deny this claim. The Introspective <b>Argument</b> <b>for</b> Sententialism {{is one of the}} most appealing <b>arguments</b> <b>for</b> sententialism. In substance, it claims that the introspective fact of inner speech provides strong evidence that our thoughts are linguistic. This article challenges this argument. I claim that the Introspective <b>Argument</b> <b>for</b> Sententialism confuses the content of our thoughts with their vehicles: while sententialism is a thesis about the vehicles of our thoughts, inner speech sentences are the content of auditory or articulatory images. The rebuttal of the introspective <b>argument</b> <b>for</b> sententialism is shown to have a general significance in cognitive science: introspection does not tell us how we think...|$|R
