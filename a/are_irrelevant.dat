25|$|If {{the best}} hand {{is shared by}} more than one player, then the pot is split equally among them, with any extra chips going to the first players after the button in {{clockwise}} order. It is common for players to have closely valued, but not identically ranked hands. Nevertheless, one must be careful in determining the best hand; if the hand involves fewer than five cards, (such as two pair or three of a kind), then kickers are used to settle ties (see the second example below). The card's numerical rank is of sole importance; suit values <b>are</b> <b>irrelevant</b> in hold 'em.|$|E
25|$|The Numerical Stroop effect {{demonstrates}} the {{close relationship between}} numerical values and physical sizes. Digits symbolize numerical values {{but they also have}} physical sizes. A digit can be presented as big or small (e.g., 5 vs. 5), irrespective of its numerical value. Comparing digits in incongruent trials (e.g., 3 5) is slower than comparing digits in congruent trials (e.g., 5 3) and the difference in reaction time is termed the numerical Stroop effect. The effect of irrelevant numerical values on physical comparisons (similar to the effect of irrelevant color words on responding to colors) suggests that numerical values are processed automatically (i.e., even when they <b>are</b> <b>irrelevant</b> to the task).|$|E

25|$|Team: A United States team of 12 elite players competes in the Ryder Cup and the Presidents Cup in {{alternate}} years. The Ryder Cup, pitting {{a team of}} U.S. golfers {{against a}} European team, is arguably the highest profile event in golf, outranking the majors. The Presidents Cup, which matches a team of U.S. golfers against an international team of golfers not eligible for the Ryder Cup, is less well established, but is still the main event of the week when it is played. There is no prize money in these events, so they <b>are</b> <b>irrelevant</b> to the money list, but an immense amount of pride rides on the results.|$|E
25|$|In the United Kingdom, it {{has been}} {{suggested}} that if the court interprets a statute to impose a duty on a public authority, the resources available to the authority <b>are</b> <b>irrelevant</b> to deciding how the duty should be carried out. Conversely, if the court interprets a statute to confer a discretionary power on a public authority, then resources are a relevant consideration. Also, public authorities are not required to take into account people's fundamental rights arising under the Human Rights Act 1998 as relevant considerations before arriving at decisions. Their only responsibility is to ensure that the decision itself complies with the European Convention on Human Rights. At present, there are no Singapore cases on these issues.|$|E
25|$|In an {{interview}} with Marc Maron that summer, Andy Richter noted the contradiction between Ebersol's comments and {{the actions of the}} network. The demonstrable impact of The Jay Leno Show on the ratings of local news across the country was the direct cause of the cancellation of The Jay Leno Show, and gave lie to Ebersol's implication that lead-ins <b>are</b> <b>irrelevant.</b> Leno's Tonight Show, in contrast, had always enjoyed healthy lead-ins courtesy of a strong NBC primetime line-up. Furthermore, the network would have reportedly faced a US$150 million penalty in order to release Leno from his contract, making O'Brien the far less expensive host to get rid of and running counter to the assertion that his ratings were the cardinal factor in being pushed out of the traditional Tonight Show time slot.|$|E

25|$|Western Pennsylvania {{leaders and}} {{most notably the}} {{designer}} of the 1992 modernization of Pittsburgh International, Tasso Katselas, {{pointed out that the}} reason fees and payments were higher than average is expressly because US Airways requested the most modern and advanced airport in the world in return for basing its hub there. Katselas has also been vocal that the issue of negotiable fees and payments <b>are</b> <b>irrelevant</b> when compared to the three biggest costs of any airline: fuel, time and labor, all of which his redesign of PIT from 1987–1992 helped to reduce. In fact, those changes created the most efficient, least costly and least financially wasteful airfield in the world. Although conceding that those updates cost more, he argued they were more than offset by Pittsburgh's vast built-in nonnegotiable fuel and time, and to a lesser degree, labor savings.|$|E
25|$|As part of {{the project}} to limit the powers of government, various liberal theorists such as James Madison and the Baron de Montesquieu {{conceived}} the notion of separation of powers, a system designed to equally distribute governmental authority among the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. Governments had to realise, liberals maintained, that poor and improper governance gave the people authority to overthrow the ruling order through any and all possible means, even through outright violence and revolution, if needed. Contemporary liberals, heavily influenced by social liberalism, have continued to support limited constitutional government while also advocating for state services and provisions to ensure equal rights. Modern liberals claim that formal or official guarantees of individual rights <b>are</b> <b>irrelevant</b> when individuals lack the material means to benefit from those rights and call for a greater role for government in the administration of economic affairs.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} emergence—that the {{properties}} and functions {{found at a}} hierarchical level are not present and <b>are</b> <b>irrelevant</b> at the lower levels–is often a basic principle behind self-organizing systems. An example of self-organization in biology leading to emergence {{in the natural world}} occurs in ant colonies. The queen does not give direct orders and does not tell the ants what to do. Instead, each ant reacts to stimuli in the form of chemical scent from larvae, other ants, intruders, food and buildup of waste, and leaves behind a chemical trail, which, in turn, provides a stimulus to other ants. Here each ant is an autonomous unit that reacts depending only on its local environment and the genetically encoded rules for its variety of ant. Despite the lack of centralized decision making, ant colonies exhibit complex behaviour and have even been able to demonstrate the ability to solve geometric problems. For example, colonies routinely find the maximum distance from all colony entrances to dispose of dead bodies.|$|E
