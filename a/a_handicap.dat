40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the {{attachment}} process of mothers with and without <b>a</b> <b>handicapped</b> infant and to examine the effects of stress and the social support network on this process. The research was a prospective, longitudinal study comparing two different mother-infant groups on the dependent variable, maternal attachment. The independent variables handicap-nonhandicap, maternal characteristics, perinatal events, and other stressors were analyzed for their effect on maternal attachment. The social support network was examined to determine its direct and indirect effect on the attachment process. The sample was composed of 36 mother-infant dyads. Data were gathered in the home at one, six, and twelve months postpartum using interviews, questionnaires and observation. Upon completion of data collection, comparisons were made between those mothers having <b>a</b> <b>handicapped</b> infant (n = 15) and those having a nonhandicapped infant (n = 21). Quantitative and qualitative techniques were employed to answer the study questions. The results indicate that there were significant differences in maternal attachment at one month postpartum with the mothers having <b>a</b> <b>handicapped</b> infant exhibiting fewer attachment behaviors. When the effects of prenatal support were partialled out, the handicap-nonhandicap variable no longer correlated significantly with maternal attachment suggesting that support was buffering the effects of having <b>a</b> <b>handicapped</b> infant. The results of the qualitative analysis also indicated that mothers having <b>a</b> <b>handicapped</b> infant were having problems with attachment. The support variables, affect and affirmation, were positively associated with maternal attachment for those mothers having <b>a</b> <b>handicapped</b> infant, while aid support was negatively correlated with maternal attachment. The qualitative analysis found that the mothers having <b>a</b> <b>handicapped</b> infant gained new support members and that more professionals became part of their support systems. In spite of gaining new support members, these mothers felt that they had less aid. At one year postpartum, mothers with <b>a</b> <b>handicapped</b> infant were experiencing more stressors than mothers with a nonhandicapped infant. Furthermore, stressors were negatively correlated with maternal attachment...|$|R

5|$|Early games {{involved}} varying {{numbers of}} players. Games {{could also be}} played with uneven numbers on each side either because some failed to show or one side offered <b>a</b> <b>handicap.</b> The first match between Sheffield and Hallam involved 16 players versus 20. Games predominantly involved larger numbers than used in the modern games. In October 1863, Sheffield declared that it would only play 11 a side matches.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} health on working conditions and outcomes. METHODS: Data were collected in the longitudinal Study on Health at Work (n = 1597 employees), using multiple regression analyses and focusing on three groups of employees: 1) healthy, 2) chronic health complaints without <b>a</b> work <b>handicap,</b> and 3) chronic health complaints with <b>a</b> work <b>handicap.</b> RESULTS: 1) Employees with <b>a</b> work <b>handicap</b> experienced less favorable working conditions and outcomes than other employees. 2) Employees with <b>a</b> work <b>handicap</b> experienced less favorable working conditions and outcomes over time. 3) Employees with chronic health complaints were more vulnerable to the influence of working conditions on outcomes, whereas employees with <b>a</b> work <b>handicap,</b> unexpectedly, benefited from high work pressure and low autonomy. CONCLUSION: 1) Employees with <b>a</b> work <b>handicap</b> differ considerably from employees with chronic health complaints. 2) Employees with <b>a</b> work <b>handicap</b> drift into less favorable working conditions and outcomes. 3) Healthy employees, employees with chronic health complaints, and employees with <b>a</b> work <b>handicap,</b> all are vulnerable to different working conditions. © 2009 The American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine...|$|R

5|$|After Sunday Night Heat, the {{pay-per-view}} {{began with}} <b>a</b> <b>handicap</b> match- a tag team match {{in which a}} team of two wrestlers face a team of three. WWE Tag Team Champions Rikishi and Scotty 2 Hotty defended their titles against The Basham Brothers (Doug and Danny Basham) and Shaniqua. During the match Hotty attempted a worm on Shaniqua, but Shaniqua countered by clotheslining Hotty. The challengers had the advantage until Hotty clotheslined the Bashams, causing them to flip over the top ring rope and into ringside. Afterwards, Rikishi delivered a Samoan drop. Rikishi then covered Shaniqua to retain the championships. Next was a Singles match, in which Jamie Noble was blindfolded as he faced his storyline girlfriend Nidia. Nidia would take advantage of Noble's inability to see by performing antics that caused him to fall. Eventually, Noble was able to apply the guillotine choke on Nidia. Noble won the match after he forced her to submit with this move.|$|E
5|$|Also {{during the}} 1970s, Bill Morris was {{studying}} giant lambeosaurine remains from Baja California. He named them ?L. laticaudus in 1981 (type specimen LACM 17715). Morris used {{a question mark}} in his work because no complete crest had been found for his species, and without it a definitive assignment could not be made. From what was known of the skull, he considered it to be most like Lambeosaurus. He interpreted this species as water-bound, due to features like its size, its tall and narrow tail (interpreted as a swimming adaptation), and weak hip articulations, {{as well as a}} healed broken thigh bone that he thought would have been too much of <b>a</b> <b>handicap</b> for a terrestrial animal to have survived long enough to heal. This species was later (2012) assigned to the new genus Magnapaulia.|$|E
