5|$|Berkelium(III) and berkelium(IV) {{hydroxides}} {{are both}} stable in 1 M sodium hydroxide solutions. Berkelium(III) phosphate (BkPO4) has been prepared as a solid, which shows strong fluorescence under <b>argon</b> <b>laser</b> (514.5nm line) excitation. Berkelium hydrides {{are produced by}} reacting metal with hydrogen gas at temperatures about 250 °C. They are non-stoichiometric with the nominal formula BkH2+x (0 < x < 1). Whereas the trihydride has a hexagonal symmetry, the dihydride crystallizes in an fcc structure with the lattice constant a = 523 pm. Several other salts of berkelium are known, including Bk2O2S, (BkNO3)3·4H2O, BkCl3·6H2O, Bk2(SO4)3·12H2O and Bk2(C2O4)3·4H2O. Thermal decomposition at about 600 °C in an argon atmosphere (to avoid oxidation to Bk2O) of Bk2(SO4)3·12H2O yields the body-centered orthorhombic crystals of berkelium(IV) oxysulfate (Bk2O2SO4). This compound is thermally stable to at least 1000 °C in an inert atmosphere.|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{compare the}} {{efficacy}} of subthreshold micropulse diode(SDM) <b>laser</b> treatment and <b>argon</b> ion <b>laser</b> treatment for diabetic macular edema(DME). METHODS: A prospective, randomized controlled trial {{was carried out in}} 84 patients(99 eyes), in which, 49 eyes received <b>argon</b> ion <b>laser</b> treatment and 50 eyes received SDM laser treatment. The changes in best corrected visual acuity(BCVA), baseline fluorescein angiography and optic coherence tomography measurements were evaluated in both groups. Follow-up visit was over 6 months from baseline. RESULTS: Ninety-nine eyes(84 patients) complete the study. Six months after treatment, the BCVA improved 22. 4 % and 20. 0 % eyes in <b>argon</b> ion <b>laser</b> group and SDM laser group respectively. 55. 1 % and 58. 0 % eyes received steady BCVA. Edema partial regression was accounted for 49 % in <b>argon</b> ion <b>laser</b> group, while that was 56 % in SDM laser group. No statistically significant changes were found in each group. CONCLUSION: No matter <b>argon</b> ion <b>laser</b> or SDM laser is effective to keep or improve the VA in DME.

At 5 145 Å we have measured the frequency differences between the main resonances of the 43 - 0 P(13) and R(15) hyperfine manifolds with a 200 Hz standard deviation and obtained a theoretical fit {{with a standard deviation}} of the order of 1. 5 kHz. The two sets of hyperfine constants for P(13), and R(15) are consistent. The results of Foth and Spieweck are confirmed for the 58 - 1 R(98) line at 5 145 Å and we make a first determination of the constants d' and δ' of the 62 - 0 R(26) line at 5 017 Å.

50|$|A trabeculoplasty is a {{modification}} of the trabecular meshwork. Laser trabeculoplasty (LTP) is {{the application of a}} laser beam to burn areas of the trabecular meshwork, located near the base of the iris, to increase fluid outflow. LTP is used in the treatment of various open-angle glaucomas. The two types of laser trabeculoplasty are <b>argon</b> <b>laser</b> trabeculoplasty (ALT) and selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT). As its name suggests, <b>argon</b> <b>laser</b> trabeculoplasty uses an <b>argon</b> <b>laser</b> to create tiny burns on the trabecular meshwork. Selective laser trabeculoplasty is newer technology that uses a Nd:YAG laser to target specific cells within the trabecular meshwork and create less thermal damage than ALT. SLT shows promise as a long term treatment. In SLT a laser is used to selectively target the melanocytes in the trabecular meshwork. Though the mechanism by which SLT functions is not well understood, it has been shown in trials to be as effective as the older <b>Argon</b> <b>Laser</b> Trabeculoplasty. However, because SLT is performed using a much lower power laser, it does not appear to affect the structure of the trabecular meshwork (based on electron microscopy) to the same extent, so retreatment may be possible if the effects from the original treatment should begin wear off, although this has not been proven in clinical studies. ALT is repeatable to some extent with measurable results possible.|$|E
