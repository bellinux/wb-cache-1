5|$|The meeting {{resulted}} {{in the creation of}} a steering committee and short-, intermediate- and long-range committees. The short-range committee was given to September (three months) to produce specifications for an interim language, which would then be improved upon by the other committees. Their official mission, however, was to identify the strengths and weaknesses of existing programming languages and did not explicitly direct them to create <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>language.</b>|$|E
5|$|Another {{topic is}} the {{relationship}} between brain structures and language acquisition. Research in first language acquisition has already established that infants from all linguistic environments go through similar and predictable stages (such as babbling), and some neurolinguistics research attempts to find correlations between stages of language development and stages of brain development, while other research investigates the physical changes (known as neuroplasticity) that the brain undergoes during second language acquisition, when adults learn <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>language.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{largest group}} of {{students}} during the first seven decades of the school were from Martha's Vineyard, and they brought MVSL with them. There were also 44 students from around Henniker, New Hampshire, and 27 from the Sandy River valley in Maine, each of which had their own village sign language. Other students brought knowledge of their own home signs. Laurent Clerc, the first teacher at ASD, taught using French Sign Language (LSF), which itself had developed in the Parisian school for the deaf established in 1755. From this situation of language contact, <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>language</b> emerged, now known as ASL.|$|E

5|$|The Saturn's {{hardware}} {{was new to}} the team, and it {{was their}} first attempt at creating an original environment. It was also Futatsugi's first year working as a full developer at Sega, so he was only able to do simple things while having a clear vision of what he wanted, which helped him to keep the overall style pure, with stark and minimalist cutscenes. Similarly, Iwade kept the enemies easy to understand visually, with simple shapes, and this overall simple style ended up fitting well with the Saturn's hardware. Then, Team Andromeda set to work on elaborating an extensive back story, and Futatsugi, to be original and to avoid using Japanese or English, {{went so far as}} to create <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>language</b> for the game: a mix of Ancient Greek, Latin and Russian. This was apparently inspired by the anime The Wings of Honneamise, of which team members were fans and which also features an invented language.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>new</b> <b>language</b> {{standardization}} process {{began at}} the 2003 Scheme workshop, {{with the goal of}} producing an R6RS standard in 2006. This process broke with the earlier RnRS approach of unanimity.|$|E

25|$|During {{the period}} of 1982 to 2008 the {{university}} transformed into a bilingual, multiracial and inclusive institution. The comparatively smooth introduction of students from all races formed the initial impetus for transformation and in 1989 the University was declared officially desegregated and opened for all races. In 1993 a policy document was introduced, aiming to position the university in a newly democratic South Africa. In 1994 the university regained {{its status as a}} bilingual university when <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>language</b> policy was adopted.|$|E
25|$|Originally, the {{association}} had not {{set out to}} create its own language. Its goal was to identify which auxiliary language already available was best suited for international communication, and how to promote it most effectively. However, after ten years of research, more and more members of IALA concluded {{that none of the}} existing interlanguages were up to the task. By 1937, the members had made the decision to create <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>language,</b> to the surprise of the world's interlanguage community.|$|E
25|$|Australasian Signed English {{was created}} in the late 1970s to {{represent}} English words and grammar, using mostly Auslan signs together with some additional contrived signs, as well as borrowings from American Sign Language (ASL). It was, and still is, used largely in education for teaching English to Deaf children or for discussing English in academic contexts. It was thought to be much easier for hearing teachers and parents to learn another mode of English than to learn <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>language</b> with a complex spatial grammar such as Auslan.|$|E

25|$|It is {{possible}} that the kinds of language experience and knowledge gained through the statistical learning of the first language influences one's acquisition of a second language. Some research points to the possibility that the difficulty of learning a second language may be derived from the structural patterns and language cues that one has already picked up from his or her acquisition of first language. In that sense, the knowledge of and skills to process the first language from statistical acquisition may act as a complicating factor when one tries to learn <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>language</b> with different sentence structures, grammatical rules, and speech patterns.|$|E
25|$|Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 {{introduces}} <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>Language</b> Control Panel {{where both}} the interface and input languages can be simultaneously changed, and language packs, regardless of type, {{can be downloaded}} from a central location. The PC Settings app in Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2 also includes a counterpart settings page for this. Changing the interface language also changes the language of preinstalled Windows Store apps (such as Mail, Maps and News) and certain other Microsoft-developed apps (such as Remote Desktop). The above limitations for language packs are however still in effect, except that full language packs can be installed for any edition except Single Language, which caters to emerging markets.|$|E
25|$|The Scheme {{community}} actively maintains {{over twenty}} implementations. Several significant new implementations (Chicken, Gambit, Gauche, Ikarus, Larceny, Ypsilon) {{have been developed}} {{in the last few}} years. The Revised5 Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme standard of Scheme was widely accepted in the Scheme community. The Scheme Requests for Implementation process has created a lot of quasi standard libraries and extensions for Scheme. User communities of individual Scheme implementations continue to grow. <b>A</b> <b>new</b> <b>language</b> standardization process was started in 2003 and led to the R6RS Scheme standard in 2007. Academic use of Scheme for teaching computer science seems to have declined somewhat. Some universities, such as MIT, are no longer using Scheme in their computer science introductory courses.|$|E
