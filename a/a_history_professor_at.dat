5|$|In June 1872, G.M. Shoop, a {{businessman}} from Danville bought 28 {{acres of land}} on the site that would become the Mountain Grove Campground. He reported this purchase in a meeting held on June 20, 1872 in Columbia County {{with a group of}} Methodists, including several ministers. In this meeting, an executive committee was appointed to arrange the camp meeting. The executive committee included Reverend S. Creighton, Reverend S. Barnes (the chairman), H.E. Sutherland (the secretary), Reverend B.P. King, Reverend E.T. Schwartz, M. Hartman, J.W. Cleaver, J.W. Eyer, and G.M. Shoop himself. Shoop intended to give the land to a local camp meeting organization once one existed. This idea was well received by the district superintendent of the Methodist Church. A committee consisting of four pastors and five lay leaders was subsequently created for the camp meeting site. Craig Newton, <b>a</b> <b>history</b> <b>professor</b> <b>at</b> what would become the Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania, stated that the site purchased by Shoop would be an ideal location for a camp meeting site.|$|E

25|$|Grandson of Carlton J. H.

500|$|Modern-day {{historians have}} {{continued}} to characterize the battle as a wholesale massacre. Mark Grimsley, <b>a</b> <b>history</b> <b>professor</b> <b>at</b> Ohio State University, concluded in 2005, based on other modern accounts, that the Battle of Bad Axe would be better termed a massacre. Kerry A. Trask's 2007 work, Black Hawk: The Battle for the Heart of America, points to the writings of Wakefield as evidence that delusional beliefs about doing brave deeds and magnifying manliness spurred the U.S. forces to revel in and pursue massacring and exterminating the Sauk and Fox. Trask concluded that Wakefield's statement [...] "I must confess, that it filled my heart with gratitude and joy, to think that I had been instrumental, with many others, in delivering my country of those merciless savages, and restoring those people again to their peaceful homes and firesides," [...] was a viewpoint held by nearly all militia members.|$|E
500|$|Roger Wilkins, <b>a</b> <b>history</b> <b>professor</b> <b>at</b> George Mason University {{who studies}} {{race in the}} United States, said [...] "Blood Ties" [...] {{provided}} [...] "insightful, wonderful explorations on the complexities of many levels of race." [...] He also said the show [...] "really does understand how we're all caught in this culture, and we're all struggling with it. And we all bring to this jagged enterprise the limited understanding of {{where we came from}} and who we are. Being fully alive requires us to struggle with these realities. That's what the show does." [...] In his journal article about the portrayal of African American men in Homicide: Life on the Street, documentary historian Thomas A. Mascaro said the presentation of light-skinned black villains like Luther Mahoney and dark-skinned actors like the one played by James Earl Jones in [...] "Blood Ties", [...] "dispels the notion that black skin color is uniform or determinative with regard to character". Some media outlets described the Watson subplot as a racial spin on the 1996 murder of six-year-old child beauty pageant queen JonBenét Ramsey, although Tom Fontana said any similarities were not intended.|$|E
500|$|The {{question}} of whether the Citizenship Clause applied to persons born in the United States to Chinese immigrants first came before the courts in an 1884 case, In re Look Tin Sing. [...] Look Tin Sing was born in Mendocino, California in 1870, but after returning from a trip to China in 1884, he was barred from reentering the United States by officials who objected to his not having met the documentation requirements imposed at the time on Chinese immigrants. [...] Look's case was heard in the federal circuit court for California by U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice Stephen J. Field and two other federal judges. [...] Lucy Salyer, <b>a</b> <b>history</b> <b>professor</b> <b>at</b> the University of New Hampshire, writes that Justice Field [...] "issued an open invitation to all lawyers in the area to give their opinions on the constitutional questions involved" [...] in the case. [...] Field focused on the meaning of the subject to the jurisdiction thereof phrase of the Citizenship Clause, held that Look was indeed subject to U.S. jurisdiction {{at the time of his}} birth despite the alien status of his parents, and on this basis ordered U.S. officials to recognize Look as a citizen and allow him to enter the United States. [...] The Look Tin Sing ruling was not appealed and was never reviewed by the Supreme Court. A similar conclusion was reached by the federal circuit court for Oregon in the 1888 cases of Ex parte Chin King and Ex parte Chan San Hee.|$|E

500|$|William Grimes, {{writing in}} the New York Times, {{described}} The Utility of Force as [...] "a closely argued, searching textbook on strategy and the efficient use of military power in the post-Cold War era". Grimes also {{described it as a}} [...] "difficult, challenging book", saying [...] "you can almost hear the pointer hit the blackboard as he works his way rigorously through each argument and sub-arguments A, B and C, before proceeding to the next step. At times the history lecture becomes a forced march over very familiar terrain, but patient readers will discover that there is indeed a final destination". In a second review for the New York Times in 2007, Niall Ferguson, <b>a</b> <b>history</b> <b>professor</b> <b>at</b> Harvard University, described The Utility of Force as an update of Clausewitz's On War [...] "for our times". Ferguson went on to criticise Smith for drawing too clear a distinction between [...] "war amongst the people" [...] and [...] "war between peoples", pointing out that in several conflicts there was no single, homogeneous [...] "people" [...] and that wars amongst the people can easily transform into wars between people, citing Bosnia as an example. Ferguson was underwhelmed by Smith's recommendations for the future—Smith believes that new equipment and strategies are required in order for armies to be effective in the new paradigm, but does not offer any suggestions. Ferguson's final criticism was what he described as the book's [...] "limited historical perspective"; Smith argues that [...] "war amongst the people" [...] emerged {{in the second half of}} the 20th century during the proxy wars and de-colonisation campaigns of the Cold War era, but Ferguson gave examples of similar campaigns which pre-dated the Cold War, including the First Boer War (1880–81) and campaigns fought in Eastern Europe during the Second World War. Nonetheless, Ferguson concludes that The Utility of Force is [...] "an impressive and absorbing work", and described Smith as [...] "the Clausewitz of low-intensity conflict and peacekeeping operations".|$|E

2500|$|Generations of {{scholars}} have debated whether Buddhist missionaries first reached Han China via the maritime or overland routes of the Silk Road. The maritime route hypothesis, favored by Liang Qichao and Paul Pelliot, proposed that Buddhism was originally practiced in southern China, the Yangtze River and Huai River region, where prince Ying of Chu (present day Jiangsu) was jointly worshipping the Yellow Emperor, Laozi, and Buddha in 65 CE. [...] The overland route hypothesis, favored by Tang Yongtong, proposed that Buddhism disseminated eastward through Yuezhi and was originally practiced in western China, at the Han capital Luoyang (present day Henan), where Emperor Ming of Han established the White Horse Temple in 68 CE.

2500|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century when Europe began to expand across the globe and {{establish}} colonies, ancient Greece and Rome were used {{as a source of}} empowerment and justification to Western civilizing mission. At this period, many French and British imperial ideologues identified strongly with the ancient empires and invoked ancient Greece and Rome to justify the colonial civilizing project. They urged European colonizers to emulate these “ideal” classical conquerors, whom they regarded as “universal instructors”. For Alexis de Tocqueville (1805-1859), an ardent and influential advocate of la “Grande France,” the classical empires were model conquerors to imitate. He advised the French colonists in Algeria to follow the ancient imperial example. In 1841, he stated: ‘what matters most when we want to set up and develop a colony {{is to make sure that}} those who arrive in it are as less estranged as possible, that these newcomers meet a perfect image of their homeland….the thousand colonies that the Greeks founded on the Mediterranean coasts were all exact copies of the Greek cities on which they had been modelled. The Romans established in almost all parts of the globe known to them municipalities which were no more than miniature Romes. Among modern colonizers, the English did the same. Who can prevent us from emulating these European peoples?’. The Greeks and Romans were deemed exemplary conquerors and “heuristic teachers”, whose lessons were invaluable for modern colonists ideologues. John-Robert Seeley (1834-1895), <b>a</b> <b>history</b> <b>professor</b> <b>at</b> Cambridge and proponent of imperialism stated in a rhetoric which echoed that of Renan that the role of the British Empire was ‘similar to that of Rome, in which we hold the position of not merely of ruling but of an educating and civilizing race.” ...|$|E
