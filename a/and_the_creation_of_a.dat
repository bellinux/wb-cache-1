5|$|Around the mid-1980s, German and Japanese representatives {{decided to}} rebuild the old Japanese embassy in Berlin from 1938. Its remains had {{remained}} unused after the building was largely destroyed during World War II. In addition to the original complex, several changes and additions were made until 2000, like moving the main entrance to the Hiroshima Street, which was named in honour of the Japanese city, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> traditional Japanese Garden.|$|E
5|$|Central to feminist {{economics}} {{is an effort}} to alter the theoretical modeling of the economy, to reduce gender bias and inequity. Feminist macroeconomic inquiries focus on international capital flows, fiscal austerity, deregulation and privatization, monetary policy, international trade and more. In general, these modifications take three main forms: gender disaggregation, the addition of gender-based macroeconomic variables, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> two-sector system.|$|E

Perhaps most significantly, Brittain is attributed with providing the vision and securing the finances to move Georgia Tech away from its roots as a teaching-oriented trade school and towards a new focus on science and technology research.|$|E

5|$|The Pennsylvania Mutiny of 1783 (also {{known as}} the Philadelphia Mutiny) was an anti-government protest by nearly 400 {{soldiers}} of the Continental Army in June 1783. The mutiny, and the refusal of the Executive Council of Pennsylvania to stop it, ultimately resulted in Congress vacating Philadelphia <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> federal district {{to serve as the}} national capital.|$|E
5|$|The Western Allies {{were divided}} in {{their vision of}} the new post-war world. Roosevelt's goals – {{military}} victory in both Europe and Asia, the achievement of global American economic supremacy over the British Empire, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> world peace organization – were more global than Churchill's, which were mainly centered on securing control over the Mediterranean, ensuring {{the survival of the}} British Empire, and the independence of Central and Eastern European countries as a buffer between the Soviets and the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there were}} several short spells when a third {{division}} was created, the two-division structure remained largely in place until 1975, when a major re-organisation of the league led to a new three-tier set-up <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new Premier Division at the highest level. In 1998, the teams then in the Premier Division broke away to form the SPL, which supplanted the Premier Division as {{the highest level of}} football in Scotland. The SPL and SFL merged in 2013 to form the Scottish Professional Football League (SPFL), which branded its top division as the Scottish Premiership.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} meeting, the {{governors}} also discussed {{the possibility of}} new tax incentives to motivate industry to reduce pollution <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new interstate compact to set industry standards, which would require adoption by all member states and approval by Congress. Those four states were already members of the Delaware River Basin Commission (DRBC), an interstate agency that controls water pollution in the Delaware River. The proposed air-pollution compact was modeled after the DRBC and would function similarly, setting minimum air standards across states and enabling enforcement actions against polluters. New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut adopted the proposed Mid-Atlantic States Air Pollution Control Compact with the possibility for Delaware and Pennsylvania {{to join in the}} future. Its approval by Congress became a policy goal of Rockefeller's failed primary bid for the 1968 Republican presidential nomination. The compact was never approved by Congress and thus never took effect.|$|E
5|$|Both {{chambers}} {{worked to}} reconcile differences between their respective {{versions of the}} bill, and on April 1, 1994, the last regular day of the legislative session, the Senate passed a compromise bill, but the House killed it on a procedural motion. On April 15, {{the last day of}} the session, which legislators had set aside to override any gubernatorial vetos, the health care bill was reintroduced and passed both houses of the General Assembly. Jones then reversed course and signed it. Among the reforms included in the bill were a mechanism making the policies of all companies uniform <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Health Policy Board to regulate rate increases. It ensured that insurance companies could not deny coverage because of a pre-existing condition and allowed workers to retain their insurance after changing jobs.|$|E
5|$|Jaco Van Dormael hired {{visual effects}} {{supervisor}} Louis Morin, {{known for his}} work in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004), to create visual effects for Mr. Nobody. All five hundred visual effects shots were produced in Quebec by Quebec companies. Modus FX announced having delivered 121 digital visual effects shots for the film. The company was entrusted with complex sequences which could not be captured on film, involving the digital reproduction of entire cities, villages and other-worldly settings. Modus FX also worked on several complex transitions between the different worlds and multiple lives of Nemo Nobody. Modus FX's post-production contributions involved 37 digital artists and technicians across a six-month period. A long list of software, including Autodesk's Softimage and Maya, Side Effects' Houdini and The Foundry's Nuke, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> multitude of in-house tools, programs and techniques was required for the shots delivered.|$|E

5|$|Republicans {{nominated}} Judge Edward C. O'Rear {{to oppose}} McCreary. There were few {{differences between the}} two men's stands on the issues. Both supported progressive reforms such as the direct election of senators, a non-partisan judiciary, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> public utilities commission. McCreary also changed his stance on the liquor question, now agreeing with Beckham's prohibitionist position; this also matched the Republican position. O'Rear claimed that Democrats should have already enacted the reforms their party platform advocated, but his only ready line of attack against McCreary himself was that he would be a pawn of Beckham and his allies.|$|E
5|$|Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana was {{the first}} to {{systematically}} establish a network of defenses around the royal residence on the hilltop of Ambohimanga. He built the site's defensive walls and its first set of seven gates. He also undertook three expansions of the settlement, beginning with the expansion of Bevato, which he surrounded by trenches, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> southern gateway called Ambavahadikely. This expansion was followed by the construction of trenches bordering a second adjoining space to the northeast with three access points. These he named Ambavahadikely, Ampanidinamporona, and Ambavahaditsiombiomby, the latter a natural gateway formed by two boulders. Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana then expanded toward the west to a series of natural defenses, including stony cliffs and steep forested slopes that obviated the need to dig defensive trenches; he instead constructed several additional gates which he named Ambavahadimahazaza, Andranomboahangy and Ambavahadiantandranomasina. In addition, the king sanctified a number of stones on the site. A stone he named Fidasiana became the site where all future sovereigns were to stand during their enthronement ceremony. He laid this stone at Ambohimanga with Andriamborona, the hill's first permanent occupant, in honor of Andriamborona's willingness to vacate the hill for the establishment of Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana's capital. The king buried white and red pearls and a piastre beneath the stone, sacrificed a zebu on it, and declared that it would thereafter ensure the protection and sanctity of Ambohimanga. He also assigned two other stones at Manganihany and Antsahamasina key roles in the royal circumcision ceremony.|$|E
5|$|Belgrano and Saavedra, {{representing}} {{the military and}} the intellectuals, got an interview with Cisneros to request an open cabildo, but without getting an answer. Cisneros called the military leaders and requested their support, but they refused, under the grounds that his viceroyalty lacked legitimacy. Castelli and other patriots insisted in their request, and Cisneros finally accepted. A massive demonstration the following day ensured that Cisneros would keep his word. The open cabildo was held on 22 May, with all political leaders present, and armed men filling the Plaza and ready to invade the cabildo in case the peninsulars attempted a disruption, which would be indicated by a signal from Belgrano. He supported the stance of his cousin Castelli, who made a speech explaining the concept of the retroversion of the sovereignty of the people, and that Spanish America was subject to the King of Spain but not to Spain itself. At the time of voting, Castelli's proposal was coupled with the one of Cornelio Saavedra, with Belgrano among its supporters. This joint proposal for the removal of Cisneros <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> government junta prevailed over the others. However, the cabildo attempted to keep Cisneros in power in spite of this result, by creating a junta with Cisneros as its president. This was rejected by the revolutionary leaders and the population. A great state of turmoil ended when the Junta was disbanded on 25 May and replaced by the Primera Junta. Belgrano was included in this junta, among many other local politicians.|$|E

5|$|During the 1830s and 1840s romantic {{nationalism}} {{appeared in}} Croatia, inspiring the Croatian National Revival (a {{political and cultural}} campaign advocating the unity of all South Slavs in the empire). Its primary focus was {{the establishment of a}} standard language as a counterweight to Hungarian and the promotion of Croatian literature and culture. During the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, Croatia sided with the Austrians; Ban Josip Jelačić helped defeat the Hungarian forces in 1849, ushering in a period of Germanization. By the 1860s the policy's failure became apparent, leading to the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> personal union between the crowns of the Austrian Empire and the Kingdom of Hungary. The treaty left the issue of Croatia's status to Hungary; this was resolved by the Croatian–Hungarian Settlement of 1868, when the kingdoms of Croatia and Slavonia were united. The Kingdom of Dalmatia remained under de facto Austrian control, while Rijeka retained its status of Corpus separatum introduced in 1779. After Austria-Hungary occupied Bosnia and Herzegovina following the 1878 Treaty of Berlin, the Croatian Military Frontier was abolished and the territory returned to Croatia in 1881. Renewed efforts to reform Austria-Hungary, entailing federalisation with Croatia as a federal unit, were halted by World War I. On 29 October 1918 the Croatian Sabor declared independence and decided to join the newly formed State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs, ending Habsburg rule and the personal union with Hungary after 816 years.|$|E
5|$|McCay {{became the}} sixth Minister for Defence in four years. His predecessor, Senator Anderson Dawson, had chaired a {{committee}} that had produced a detailed report recommending {{the abolition of}} the post of General Officer Commanding Australian Military Forces <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Council of Defence, a Naval Board and a Military Board. It fell to McCay to implement the report's recommendations and create a five-man Military Board consisting of himself, a finance member and three military officers. McCay preferred the senior member not be styled the Chief of the General Staff. This change would not be made until 1909. At the first meeting of the Council of Defence, McCay rejected the arguments of Captain William Rooke Creswell {{for the majority of the}} defence budget to be spent on supporting the British fleet. In 1905 the Reid government collapsed and McCay became a backbencher once more. Since the Federal parliament sat in Parliament House, Melbourne, McCay lived at the Stock Exchange Club in Collins Street, Melbourne while his family remained in Castlemaine. He maintained a liaison with a married woman, Ella Gavan Duffy.|$|E
5|$|Music {{in early}} modern Scotland {{includes}} {{all forms of}} musical production in Scotland between the early sixteenth century and the mid-eighteenth century. In this period the court followed the European trend for instrumental accompaniment and playing. Scottish monarchs {{of the sixteenth century}} were patrons of religious and secular music, and some were accomplished musicians. In the sixteenth century the playing of a musical instrument and singing became an expected accomplishment of noble men and women. The departure of James VI to rule in London at the Union of Crowns in 1603, meant that the Chapel Royal, Stirling Castle largely fell into disrepair and the major source of patronage was removed from the country. Important composers of the early sixteenth century included Robert Carver and David Peebles. The Lutheranism of the early Reformation was sympathetic to the incorporation of Catholic musical traditions and vernacular songs into worship, exemplified by The Gude and Godlie Ballatis (1567). However, the Calvinism that came to dominate Scottish Protestantism led to the closure of song schools, disbanding of choirs, removal of organs and the destruction of music books and manuscripts. An emphasis was placed on the Psalms, resulting in the production of a series of Psalters <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tradition of unaccompanied singing.|$|E
