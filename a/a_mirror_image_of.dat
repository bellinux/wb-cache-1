5|$|Doppelgänger is a 1969 British {{science fiction}} film {{directed}} by Robert Parrish and starring Roy Thinnes, Ian Hendry, Lynn Loring and Patrick Wymark. Outside Europe, {{it is known}} as Journey to the Far Side of the Sun, which is now the more popular title. In the film, a joint European-NASA mission to investigate a planet in a position parallel to Earth, behind the Sun, ends in disaster {{with the death of}} one of the astronauts (Hendry). His colleague (Thinnes) discovers that the planet is <b>a</b> <b>mirror</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> Earth.|$|E
5|$|Neuman and EUROSEC {{official}} Lise Hartman (Loni von Friedl) interrogate Ross, who {{denies that}} he aborted the mission. Shortly after, Kane dies from his injuries. Eventually, Ross concludes {{that he is}} not on Earth, but is on the unknown planet – a Counter-Earth that is <b>a</b> <b>mirror</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> his. Signs of this reversal include a clock whose hands move anticlockwise, a tape deck's reels that turn clockwise and an oscilloscope that scans from right to left.|$|E

5|$|In the Atlantic, the Allies waged a long {{battle with}} German {{submarines}} which was termed the Battle of the Atlantic. Navy aircraft flew from bases in Greenland and Iceland to hunt submarines, {{and hundreds of}} escort carriers and destroyer escorts were built which were specifically designed to protect merchant convoys. In the Pacific, in an ironic twist, the U.S. submarines fought against Japanese shipping in <b>a</b> <b>mirror</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> the Atlantic, with U.S. submarines hunting Japanese merchant ships. At {{the end of the}} war the U.S. had 260 submarines in commission. It had lost 52 submarines during the war, 36 in actions in the Pacific. Submarines effectively destroyed the Japanese merchant fleet by January 1945 and choked off Japan's oil supply.|$|E
5|$|Ceratopsians {{are easily}} {{recognized}} by {{features of the}} skull. On {{the tip of a}} ceratopsian upper jaw is the rostral bone, an edentulous (toothless) ossification, unique to ceratopsians. Othniel Charles Marsh recognized and named this bone, which acts as <b>a</b> <b>mirror</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> the predentary bone on the lower jaw. This ossification evolved to morphologically aid the mastication of plant matter. Along with the predentary bone, which forms the tip of the lower jaw in all ornithischians, the rostral forms a superficially parrot-like beak. Also, the jugal bones below the eye are very tall and flare out sideways, making the skull appear somewhat triangular when viewed from above. This triangular appearance is accentuated in later ceratopsians by the rearwards extension of the parietal and squamosal bones of the skull roof, to form the neck frill.|$|E
5|$|NEERC is {{expected}} to be capable of handling up to 190,000 tonnes of waste per year. This waste will be burned to generate electricity for the National Grid and cogenerate to provide heat for local industries in the form of steam. NEERC will have two processing lines, capable of generating 21MW of electricity, enough to provide for 37,500 homes. This means that over the two facilities, 640,000 tonnes of waste will be burned annually, and over 50MW of electricity generated. This would make Teesside the largest operational EfW centre in the UK outside London. The plant will be <b>a</b> <b>mirror</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> the current one, and will create 160 jobs; 25 in South Tyne and Wear, 100 {{in the construction of the}} plant, and the rest once the plant is operational.|$|E

25|$|Left-handed or southpaw fighters use <b>a</b> <b>mirror</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> the {{orthodox}} stance, which can create problems for orthodox fighters unaccustomed to receiving jabs, hooks, or crosses {{from the opposite}} side.

25|$|England won by 3 wickets and Ian Chappell and Dennis Amiss {{were made}} {{the two men}} of the match for their {{entertaining}} innings, {{even though they were}} not the top scorers.

30|$|Finally, an {{available}} texture in {{the input}} 2 D image is mapped onto the dense 3 D facial shape {{to complete the}} 3 D face reconstruction. However, some facial texture regions can be self-occluded in rotated view images. Thus, the bilateral symmetry of a face is used for texture mapping to recover the self-occluded texture. Specifically, we produce <b>a</b> <b>mirrored</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> the half-face contained in the visible region, and use the mirrored texture of the visible half-face for texture mapping in the occluded facial region.|$|R
40|$|This {{work is a}} {{participatory}} study among a {{group of}} seniors who live together and form a community. The relationship between individual and group interests have been studied together with how the motivation of individual members shape the collective goal of the community, despite personal differences. Because the group's goal is <b>a</b> <b>mirrored</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> the members’ personal motivation, the group and individual interest are very similar. This ensures that members are committed to the goal and are willing to put aside momentary differences of opinion...|$|R

25|$|The same (asymmetric) design may be {{duplicated}} on both sides.

50|$|Walnut Creek CDROM also {{produced}} two {{variations of the}} daemon for its CDROM covers. The FreeBSD 1.0 and 1.1 CDROM covers used the 1988 Lasseter drawing. The FreeBSD 2.0 CDROM used a variant with different colored (specifically green) tennis shoes. Other distributions used this image with different colored tennis shoes over the years. Starting with FreeBSD 2.0.5, Walnut Creek CDROM covers used the daemon walking out of a CDROM. Starting with FreeBSD 4.5, the FreeBSD Mall used <b>a</b> <b>mirrored</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> the Walnut Creek 2.0 image.

25|$|The image {{shows the}} {{location}} {{of most of the}} named fielding positions based on a right-handed batsman. The area to the left of a right-handed batsman (from the batsman's point of view – facing the bowler) is called the leg side or on side, while that to the right is the off side. If the batsman is left-handed, the leg and off sides are reversed and the fielding positions are <b>a</b> <b>mirror</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> those shown.|$|E
25|$|In anatomy, the scapula (plural scapulae or scapulas) a.k.a. {{shoulder}} blade or wing bone, is the bone {{that connects the}} humerus (upper arm bone) with the clavicle (collar bone). Like their connected bones the scapulae are paired, with the scapula {{on either side of}} the body being roughly <b>a</b> <b>mirror</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> the other. In early Roman times, people thought the bone resembled a trowel, a small shovel. The {{shoulder blade}} is also called omo in Latin medical terminology.|$|E

50|$|There {{are three}} {{versions}} of the video. The first version of the music video features Dolores O'Riordan donning her original hairstyle that is seen on the Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We? album cover. The video revolves around O'Riordan with the other band members flashing up throughout the video while she's sitting on in a chair with a cross as a back or a close up of her face and eyes. The video shows <b>a</b> <b>mirrored</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> O'Riordan to show she does the background vocals and towards the end the band members fade in and out constantly in front of O'Riordan.|$|R
5000|$|Hows the View: The {{players were}} asked to choose two players who {{consider}} themselves [...] "Young at Heart", (Paul and Craig) and then asked to split into two pairs, each having one Young at Heart member.

The cameraperson had to guide their teammate {{through a series of}} challenges designed for children. The teammates were always positioned opposite each other, so the goggles would display <b>a</b> <b>mirrored</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> the task at hand. The cameraperson also could not speak to their partner.|$|R
