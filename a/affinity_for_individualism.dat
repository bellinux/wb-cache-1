2500|$|John McWhorter {{has called}} Hurston [...] "America's {{favorite}} black conservative" [...] while David T. Beito and Linda Royster Beito {{have argued that}} she can better be characterized as a libertarian. She was a Republican who was generally sympathetic to the foreign policy non-interventionism of the Old Right and a fan of Booker T. Washington's self-help politics. She disagreed with the philosophies (including Communism and the New Deal) supported by many of her colleagues in the Harlem Renaissance, such as Langston Hughes, {{who was in the}} 1930s a supporter of the Soviet Union and praised it in several of his poems. Despite much common ground with the Old Right in domestic and foreign policy, Hurston was not a social conservative. Her writings show an <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> feminist <b>individualism.</b> In this respect, her views were similar to two libertarian novelists who were her contemporaries: Rose Wilder Lane and Isabel Paterson. Although her personal quotes show a disbelief of religion, Hurston did [...] not [...] negate spiritual matters as evidenced from her 1942 autobiography Dust Tracks on a Road.|$|R

40|$|This study {{sought to}} {{investigate}} solitude as a phenomenon. People?s <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> solitude and the antecedents of <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> solitude were of crucial interest to the study because <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> solitude has been considered a strong determinant of solitude behavior. Based on the review of existing solitude studies, major constructs believed to comprise an empirical model were theoretically and operationally defined: <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> solitude, general attitudes toward solitude, subjective norms, perceived control, extraversion, intended solitude behavior, and actual solitude behavior. The relationships among latent factors were hypothesized for empirical tests. A questionnaire was designed to measure the above constructs. Several items were based on previous studies although several items were developed by the investigator. A total of 395 college students, 162 male and 233 female students completed an online survey in exchange for extra credit. Preliminary analysis indicated {{the internal consistency of}} the battery of measurement scales used in this study were highly reliable; the measurement test also provided empirical evidence of the construct validity of the developed measures. A test of the hypothesized model of people?s <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> solitude revealed that there were well-defined path relationships between latent factors with a good fit between the measures and the sample data. Findings revealed that general attitudes toward solitude and subjective norms positively contributed to <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> solitude; while extraversion negatively influenced <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> solitude. <b>Affinity</b> <b>for</b> solitude effectively predicted intended solitude behavior and actual solitude behavior. Additionally, the study found that subjective norms and general attitudes toward solitude also significantly predicted intended solitude behavior. A model of people?s <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> solitude and solitude behavior allowed us to analytically view the latent social and cognitive factors that significantly inform people?s <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> solitude and their solitude behavior. This study is valuable in two ways. First, theoretical and empirical approaches derived from this current study suggest ways of conceptualizing solitude attitudes and behavior. Second, study findings account for the antecedents and consequences of <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> solitude. Theoretical relations and several implications associated with college students and recreation management were presented. Additionally, the limitations of the study followed by suggestions for improvements and possible directions for future research were discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{specificity}} of endothelial binding sites for heparin was investigated with heparin fractions and fragments differing in their Mr, charge density and <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> antithrombin III, {{as well as}} with heparinoids and other anionic polyelectrolytes (polystyrene sulphonates). The <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> endothelial cells was estimated by determining I 50 values in competition experiments with 125 I-heparin. We found that <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> endothelial cells increases as a function of Mr and charge density (degree of sulphation). Binding sites are not specific receptors for heparin. Other anionic polyelectrolytes, such as pentosan polysulphates and polystyrene sulphonates, competed with heparin for binding to endothelial cells. Fractions of standard heparin with high <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> antithrombin III also had greater <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> endothelium. However, these two properties of heparin (<b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> antithrombin III and <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> endothelial cells) could be dissociated.

Synthetic pentasaccharides, bearing the minimal sequence for binding to antithrombin III, did not bind to endothelial cells. Binding to endothelial cells involved partial neutralization of heparin. Bound heparin exhibited only 5 % and 7 % of antifactor IIa and antifactor Xa specific activity, respectively. In the presence of 200 nM-antithrombin III, {{and in the absence of}} free heparin, a limited fraction (approx. 30 %) of bound heparin was displaced from endothelial cells during a 1 h incubation period.
