40|$|AbstractEvolvability in its {{simplest}} form is {{the ability}} of a population to respond to directional selection. More interestingly it means that some lineages show open-ended evolution by accumulating novel adaptations, and that some lineages complexity can increase indefinitely. Unlimited heredity is a precondition for such rich open-endedness, another one seems to be (analogous to) chemical combinatorics. The richness of matter seems {{to be a source of}} challenges and opportunities not yet matched in <b>artificial</b> <b>algorithms.</b> However, some “artificial” systems can be more evolvable than natural ones because for the former the whole population is not under the constraint to survive in the wild. A form of artificial selection may happen even in the brain of replicable patterns that yield complex adaptations within the lifetime of the individual...|$|E

40|$|Duplication and {{divergence}} are {{two basic}} evolutionary mechanisms of bio-molecular networks. Real-world bio-molecular networks and their statistical characteristics can be well mimicked by <b>artificial</b> <b>algorithms</b> based on the two mechanisms. Bio-molecular networks consist of network motifs, which act as building blocks of large-scale networks. A fundamental question is how network motifs are evolved from long time evolution and natural selection. By considering the effect of various duplication and divergence strategies, {{we find that the}} underlying duplication scheme of the real-world undirected bio-molecular networks would rather follow the anti-preference strategy than the random one. The anti-preference duplication mechanism and the dimerization processes can lead to the formation of various motifs, and robustly conserve proper quantities of motifs in the artificial networks as that in the real-world ones. Furthermore, the anti-preference mechanism and edge deletion divergence can robustly preserve the sparsity of the networks. The investigations reveal the possible evolutionary mechanisms of network motifs in real-world bio-molecular networks, and have potential implications in the design, synthesis and reengineering of biological networks for biomedical purpose...|$|E

40|$|Identifying {{the labels}} of points of {{interest}} (POIs), aka POI labelling, provides significant benefits in location-based services. However, the quality of raw labels manually added by users or generated by <b>artificial</b> <b>algorithms</b> cannot be guaranteed. Such low-quality labels decrease the usability and result in bad user experiences. In this paper, by observing that crowdsourcing is a best-fit for computer-hard tasks, we leverage crowdsourcing {{to improve the quality}} of POI labelling. To our best knowledge, this is the first work on crowdsourced POI labelling tasks. In particular, there are two sub-problems: (1) how to infer the correct labels for each POI based on workers' answers, and (2) how to effectively assign proper tasks to workers in order to make more accurate inference for next available workers. To address these two problems, we propose a framework consisting of an inference model and an online task assigner. The inference model measures the quality of a worker on a POI by elaborately exploiting (i) worker's inherent quality, (ii) the spatial distance between the worker and the POI, and (iii) the POI influence, which can provide reliable inference results once a worker submits an answer. As workers are dynamically coming, the online task assigner judiciously assigns proper tasks to them so as to benefit the inference. The inference model and task assigner work alternately to continuously improve the overall quality. We conduct extensive experiments on a real crowdsourcing platform, and the results on two real datasets show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. © 2016 IEEE. postprin...|$|E
40|$|Smart grid {{has been}} {{advocated}} in both developing and developed countries {{in many years}} to deal with {{large amount of energy}} deficit and air pollutions. However, many literatures talked about some specific technologies and implementations, few of them could give a clear picture on the smart grid implementations in a macro scale like what is the main consideration for the smart grid implementations, how to examine the power system operation with communication network deployment, how to determine the optimal technology scheme with consideration of economic and political constraints, and so on. Governments and related institutions are keen to evaluate the cost and benefit of new technologies or mechanisms in a scientific way rather than making decision blindly. Decision Support System, which is an information system based on interactive computers to support decision making in planning, management, operations for evaluating technologies, is an essential tool to provide decision makers with powerful scientific evidence. The objective of the thesis is to identify the data and information processing technologies and mechanisms which will enable the further development of decision support systems {{that can be used to}} evaluate the indices for smart grid technology investment in the future. First of all, the thesis introduces the smart grid and its features and technologies in order to clarify the benefits can be obtained from smart grid deployment in many aspects such as economics, environment, reliability, efficiency, security and safety. Besides, it is necessary to understand power system business and operation scenarios which may affect the communication network model. This thesis, for the first time, will give detailed requirements for smart grid simulation according to the power system business and operation. In addition, state of art monitoring system and communication system involved in smart grid for better demand side management will be reviewed in order to find out their impacts reflecting to the power systems. The methods and algorithms applied to the smart grid monitoring, communication technologies for smart grid are summarized and the monitoring systems are compared with each other to see the merits and drawbacks in each type of the monitoring system. In smart grid environment, large number of data are need to be processed and useful information are required to be abstracted for further operation in power systems. Machine learning is a useful tool for data mining and prediction. One of the typical machine learning <b>artificial</b> <b>algorithms,</b> artificial neural network (ANN) for load forecasting in large power system is proposed in this thesis and different learning methods of back-propagation, Quasi-Newton and Levenberg-Marquardt, are compared with each other to seek the best result in load forecasting. Bad load forecasting may leads to demand and generation mismatch, which could cause blackout in power systems. Load shedding schemes are powerful defender for power system from collapsing and keep the grid in integral to a maximum extent. A lesson learned from India blackout in July 2012 is analyzed and recommendations on preventing grid from blackout are given in this work. Also, a new load shedding schemes for an isolated system is proposed in this thesis to take full advantage from information sharing and communication network deployment in smart grid. Lastly, the new trend of decision support system (DSS) for smart grid implementation is summarized and reliability index and stability scenarios for cost benefit analysis are under DSS consideration.

40|$|The Internet has {{fundamentally}} {{changed our}} society, {{the way we}} live, work and express ourselves. Improvements on information and in communication technology have created mobile devices that offer smart mobile services that keep us constantly connected and that deliver digital content. Millions of such mobile service are available today. While being inexpensive in terms of actual money, user data has become the actual currency, rewarding the company that knows the most about their users. This has created an eco-system which, invisible during normal usage, records virtually every action online. The recorded data fuels sophisticated <b>artificial</b> <b>algorithms</b> that learn our interests, desires and secrets for purposes such as behavioral advertisement and surveillance. We focus on location-based services (LBSs) to address the privacy concerns of the mobile-device eco-system. Currently deployed LBSs are designed in a privacy-invasive way, because the service provider and other third parties learn accurate location information on their users. This is a significant threat to the user’s privacy, because entities with access to accurate location data are able to infer sensitive information, such as users’ home/work address, religious beliefs, sexual orientation and income level. We understand LBSs as a new socio-technical practice and assess its implications on privacy from an interdisciplinary perspective, including the engineering, ethics, social and legal domain. We employ the concept of contextual integrity in order to evaluate how the changes of information flow, imposed by the new socio-technical practice, affect society. Furthermore, we propose a framework that allows to quantify threats towards an adversary that is able to observe app traffic. We show that this {{poses a threat to}} the user’s privacy in general, but may also pose a threat to the user’s location privacy. In order to address the privacy concerns of LBSs, we study technical solutions that allow users to keep their data confidential. Therefore, we study the design of private protocols for service providers that want to provide guarantees that they cannot learn user location information. Our design accounts for the current business model of most mobile services to monetize their investments with data that they learn about their users. Particularly, the overhead on the service provider’s infrastructure is minimal allowing for a low cost maintenance of the service. Furthermore, the service provider is able to learn, in a privacy-preserving way, statistics about the locations that the users share among each other. This may serve as a form of monetization. Since most service providers, due to their business model, are reluctant to implement privacy friendly protocols, we study the design and analysis of obfuscation-based protection mechanisms. These location-privacy preserving mechanisms (LPPMs) allow users to protect their whereabouts when engaging in privacy-invasive protocols. We propose a framework that allows the computation of the optimal LPPM for users that engage sporadically in LBSs and that is tailored to a user’s mobility profile and the user’s constraints. We furthermore propose a framework that allows for a first-order location privacy approximation for users that employ LPPMs. Finally, we conclude the research results of this thesis and outline paths of future work. Here we put particular emphasis on studying quantification frameworks that take a middle ground between complexity and simplicity. Furthermore, we suggest to study how our framework can be applied for the purpose of privacy visualization. This may serve as a practical tool for the visualization of both the user’s current location privacy as well as an assessment on how the privacy level changes for the next query to the LBS and thus contribute for users to better understand the privacy implications of their actions. Finally, possibilistic thinking should also be applied to the design of LPPMs. nrpages: 284 status: publishe...|$|E
