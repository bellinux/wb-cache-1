5|$|On May 17, 2004, Massachusetts {{became the}} first state in the U.S. to legalize {{same-sex}} marriage after <b>a</b> <b>Massachusetts</b> Supreme Judicial Court ruling in November 2003 determined that the exclusion of same-sex couples from {{the right to a}} civil marriage was unconstitutional.

5|$|Although {{a few of}} Harding's cabinet appointees were scandal-tarred, Coolidge {{initially}} retained all of them, out of {{an ardent}} conviction that as successor to a deceased elected president he was obligated to retain Harding's counselors and policies until the next election. He kept Harding's able speechwriter Judson T. Welliver; Stuart Crawford replaced Welliver in November 1925. Coolidge appointed C. Bascom Slemp, a Virginia Congressman and experienced federal politician, to work jointly with Edward T. Clark, <b>a</b> <b>Massachusetts</b> Republican organizer whom he retained from his vice-presidential staff, as Secretaries to the President (a position equivalent to the modern White House Chief of Staff).|$|E
5|$|Benjamin Franklin Butler {{was born}} in Deerfield, New Hampshire, and later moved to Massachusetts to pursue a legal career. He built a {{successful}} practice in the 1840s and 1850s, and became involved in local politics as a Democrat. A compelling public speaker, Butler was first elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1853. He successfully ran for <b>a</b> <b>Massachusetts</b> Senate seat in 1859. Despite his Protestant upbringing he gained a faithful following among Massachusetts Catholics, and also built support among laborers. In the 1860 presidential campaign, Butler sought compromise with the slave power, and believed Senator Jefferson Davis of Mississippi {{ought to be the}} Democratic Party's nominee for president.|$|E

In 1964, he was a volunteer in Mississippi during Freedom Summer. He taught undergraduates at Harvard while studying for a PhD in Government, but left in 1968 before having completed the degree, to become Boston mayor Kevin White’s Chief Assistant, a position he held for three years. He then served for a year as Administrative Assistant to Congressman Michael J. Harrington. In 1977, Frank graduated from Harvard Law School, where he was once a student of Henry Kissinger, while serving as <b>a</b> <b>Massachusetts</b> state representative.|$|E
5|$|In December 1862, Nathaniel P. Banks {{replaced}} Butler {{in command}} at New Orleans. Banks, <b>a</b> <b>Massachusetts</b> Republican with prohibitionist sympathies, had known Dow before the war, but he initially displeased Dow {{by refusing to}} repeal Butler's order against confiscation of rebel property. He did, however, allow Dow to return to New Orleans {{to take part in}} the planned spring offensive. As the Union armies looked to complete their control over the Mississippi River, only Vicksburg, Mississippi and Port Hudson, Louisiana held out against federal control. Major General Ulysses S. Grant moved on Vicksburg from the north while Banks advanced to Port Hudson from the south. By May 21, the town was surrounded.|$|E
5|$|The next year, Dow met {{his future}} wife, Maria Cornelia Maynard, the {{daughter}} of <b>a</b> <b>Massachusetts</b> merchant. They married on January 20, 1830. Over the next twenty years, they had nine children, five of whom (two sons and three daughters) survived infancy. Maria Cornelia was a Congregationalist, and Dow attended services with her at Second Parish Church regularly, although he never became a member. Their home, built at 714 Congress Street in Portland in 1829, still stands {{and is now a}} museum memorializing Dow's life and administered by the local chapter of the Women's Christian Temperance Union.|$|E

5|$|The {{swearing}} in of Romney as the 70th {{governor of}} Massachusetts {{took place on}} January 2, 2003. He faced <b>a</b> <b>Massachusetts</b> state legislature with large Democratic majorities in both houses, and had picked his cabinet and advisors based more on managerial abilities than partisan affiliation. He declined a governor's salary of $135,000 during his term. Upon entering office {{in the middle of}} a fiscal year, he faced an immediate $650million shortfall and a projected $3billion deficit for the next year. Unexpected revenue of $1.0–1.3billion from a previously enacted capital gains tax increase and $500million in new federal grants decreased the deficit to $1.2–1.5billion. Through a combination of spending cuts, increased fees, and removal of corporate tax loopholes, the state achieved surpluses of around $600–700million during Romney's last two full fiscal years in office, although it began running deficits again after that.|$|E
5|$|Although {{some historians}} have belittled Grant's cabinet as being mediocre, {{according}} to biographers Jean Edward Smith and Ron Chernow, it had distinguished members, including former congressmen, senators, governors, and judges. Without senatorial consultation, Grant's unconventional cabinet choices sparked both criticism and approval. In {{his effort to}} create national harmony, he purposely avoided choosing Republican Party leaders, selecting several non-politicians. Grant chose two close friends for important posts: Elihu B. Washburne for Secretary of State and John A. Rawlins as Secretary of War; Washburne was soon appointed minister to France and replaced by conservative New York statesman Hamilton Fish. Rawlins died in office after serving only a few months, replaced by William W. Belknap of Iowa. For Treasury, he appointed wealthy New York merchant Alexander T. Stewart, who was found ineligible and replaced by Representative George S. Boutwell, <b>a</b> <b>Massachusetts</b> Radical Republican. Grant appointed Philadelphia businessman Adolph E. Borie Secretary of Navy, who soon resigned, {{and was replaced by}} a relative unknown, George M. Robeson. Grant's nomination of James Longstreet, a former Confederate general, to the position of Surveyor of customs of the port of New Orleans, was met with general amazement, and was largely seen as a genuine effort to unite the North and South. Other cabinet appointments—Jacob D. Cox (Interior), John Creswell (Postmaster General), and Ebenezer Rockwood Hoar (Attorney General)—were well received.|$|E
5|$|By June 1863, Ohio {{had not yet}} fielded an African American combat unit, but Ohio {{blacks were}} being {{recruited}} for service in the regiments of other states. Beaty enlisted from Cincinnati on June 7, 1863 for a three-year term of service in the Union Army; he was {{among a group of}} men recruited for <b>a</b> <b>Massachusetts</b> regiment. He joined as a private but was promoted to sergeant only two days later. He was placed in charge of a squad of forty-seven other recruits and ordered to report to Columbus, Ohio, from where they would be sent to Boston. Upon arriving in Columbus on June 15, however, they learned that the Massachusetts regiments were full and unable to accept their service. The Governor of Ohio, David Tod, immediately requested permission from the Department of War to form an Ohio regiment of African Americans. Permission was granted, and on June 17, Beaty and his squad became the first members of the 127th Ohio Volunteer Infantry, later re-designated the 5th United States Colored Troops. After three months of recruitment and organization in Camp Delaware, on the Olentangy River outside of Delaware, Ohio, the unit set out for Virginia.|$|E

5|$|Roger Mowry's Tavern was {{reportedly}} {{the site of}} civil rally to free a man taken prisoner by <b>a</b> <b>Massachusetts</b> constable. The constable, whose intention was to extradite his prisoner back to Massachusetts for prosecution was staying at the nearby Roger Pray's tavern when concerned citizens gathered at Mowry's tavern. The citizens summoned the town council, and a messenger {{was sent to the}} Massachusetts constable to demand by what authority he held his prisoner. The end result was the release of the prisoner. Another story surrounding the tavern was the murder of John Clawson, a Dutch carpenter, who was found dying one December morning in 1661. A native Indian, Waumanitt, was charged with the crime and held at Mowry's tavern until the matter could be resolved, but it is unknown what fate befell Waumanitt. According to locals, Clawson was roused and accused his neighbor, Hearndon, for his murder. Clawson then cursed the family before dying. The house was also reported to have been used by the Town Council for meetings, with a record of payment in 1657 from the Town Treasurer.|$|E
