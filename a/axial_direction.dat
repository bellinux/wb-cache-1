25|$|In {{order to}} {{illuminate}} multiple rows of detector {{elements in a}} multi-slice scanner, the x-ray source must emit a beam which is divergent along the <b>axial</b> <b>direction</b> (i.e. a cone beam instead of a fan beam).|$|E
25|$|If the {{particle}} {{is located at}} the center of the beam, then individual rays of light are refracting through {{the particle}} symmetrically, resulting in no net lateral force. The net force in this case is along the <b>axial</b> <b>direction</b> of the trap, which cancels out the scattering force of the laser light. The cancellation of this axial gradient force with the scattering force is what causes the bead to be stably trapped slightly downstream of the beam waist.|$|E
25|$|Closure of the {{umbilical}} artery by vasoconstriction consists of multiple constrictions which increase {{in number and}} degree with time. There are segments of dilatations with trapped uncoagulated blood between the constrictions before complete occlusion. Both the partial constrictions and the ultimate closure are mainly produced by muscle cells of the outer circular layer. In contrast, the inner layer seems to serve mainly as a plastic tissue which can easily be shifted in an <b>axial</b> <b>direction</b> and then folded into the narrowing lumen to complete the closure. The vasoconstrictive occlusion appears to be mainly mediated by serotonin and thromboxane A2. The artery in cords of preterm infants contracts more to angiotensin II and arachidonic acid and is more sensitive to oxytocin than in term ones. In contrast to the contribution of Wharton's jelly, cooling causes only temporary vasoconstriction.|$|E

25|$|As {{the fluid}} enters and {{leaves in the}} <b>axial</b> <b>direction,</b> the {{centrifugal}} component in the energy equation does not come into play. Here the compression is fully based on diffusing action of the passages.The diffusing action in stator converts absolute kinetic head of the fluid into rise in pressure. The relative kinetic head in the energy equation is a term that exists {{only because of the}} rotation of the rotor. The rotor reduces the relative kinetic head of the fluid and adds it to the absolute kinetic head of the fluid i.e., the impact of the rotor on the fluid particles increases its velocity (absolute) and thereby reduces the relative velocity between the fluid and the rotor. In short, the rotor increases the absolute velocity of the fluid and the stator converts this into pressure rise. Designing the rotor passage with a diffusing capability can produce a pressure rise in addition to its normal functioning. This produces greater pressure rise per stage which constitutes a stator and a rotor together. This is the reaction principle in turbomachines. If 50% of the pressure rise in a stage is obtained at the rotor section, it is said to have a 50% reaction.|$|E

2500|$|The {{square of}} the {{magnitude}} of the electric field is equal to the intensity of the beam as a function of position. Therefore, the result indicates that the force on the dielectric particle, when treated as a point dipole, is proportional to the gradient along the intensity of the beam. In other words, the gradient force described here tends to attract the particle to the region of highest intensity. In reality, the scattering force of the light works against the gradient force in the <b>axial</b> <b>direction</b> of the trap, resulting in an equilibrium position that is displaced slightly downstream of the intensity maximum. Under the Rayleigh approximation, we can also write the scattering force as ...|$|E
2500|$|According to the {{newspaper}} Izvestia, the increased vibration of turbine2 was going on for some 10years and was well-known to the plant personnel. [...] According to {{the former director of}} Irkutskenergo, Viktor Bobrovski, the accident could have been caused by an incorrect start-up process of the turbine which resulted in a hydraulic pressure surge, or excess load of the turbine caused by peak consumption of electricity. According to Bobrovski, it is common practice in the region to compensate for a peak load by overloading hydroelectric power plants, and the energy system of the region is near collapse, as the main goal of its owners is to take out as much profit as possible, typically by cutting down on maintenance, investment, safety, and educational costs. [...] Since the load for other turbines ceased {{after the collapse of the}} turbine2, they probably started to spin without load at increasing speed until they failed. He said that the former director of Sayano–Shushenskaya hydroelectric power station, Valentin Bryzgalov, had alerted that it is dangerous to operate the plant at its maximum loads when the turbines are starting to vibrate in the <b>axial</b> <b>direction.</b> He said that the accident probably would not have had such catastrophic results if the safety systems had worked and the safety rules had been followed.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{experimentally}} {{verify the}} feasibility of focused heating in the neck region by an array of two rings of six electromagnetic antennas. We also measured the dynamic specific absorption rate (SAR) steering possibilities of this setup and compared these SAR patterns to simulations. Methods and Materials: Using a specially constructed laboratory prototype head-and-neck applicator, including a neck-mimicking cylindrical muscle phantom, we performed SAR measurements by electric field, Schottkydiode sheet measurements and, using the power-pulse technique, by fiberoptic thermometry and infrared thermography. Using phase steering, we also steered the SAR distribution in radial and <b>axial</b> <b>directions.</b> All measured distributions were compared with the predictions by a finite-difference time-domain–based electromagnetic simulator. Results: A central 50 % iso-SAR focus of 35 +/- 3 mm in diameter and about 100 +/- 15 mm in length was obtained for all investigated settings. Furthermore, this SAR focus could be steered toward the desired location in the radial and <b>axial</b> <b>directions</b> with an accuracy of ~ 5 mm. The SAR distributions as measured by all three experimental methods were well predicted by the simulations. Conclusion: The results of our study have shown that focused heating in the neck is feasible and that this focus can be effectively steered in the radial and <b>axial</b> <b>directions.</b> For quality assurance measurements, {{we believe that the}} Schottky-diode sheet provides the best compromise among effort, speed, and accuracy, although a more specific and improved design is warranted...|$|R
