40|$|Continued {{progress}} is {{reported in the}} development of two-photon absorption instrumentation. Noise considerations in second harmonic detection fluorometry are discussed and improvements in two-photon excited fluorescence detection are reported. The use of short focal length microscope objectives for excitation and collection optics allows spatial discrimination of the two-photon induced fluorescence from linear background interferences. Combined with second harmonic detection, this arrangement provides detection limits as low as 200 pM. Suggestions are made for a third generation instrument. ^ To test the analytical utility of this instrument, the feasibility of identifying and quantitating bacteria obtained from soil samples was examined. The inherent selectivity of two-photon absorption combined with the excellent detection limits offered by second harmonic detection result in the possibility of reducing <b>assay</b> <b>blank</b> limitations associated with one-photon techniques. The development and spectroscopic characterization of some mono- and di-substituted naphthalenes for monitoring bacteria has resulted in the discovery of a new class of fluorescent probes for enzymatic analyses. ...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveTo {{construct}} the lentiviral vector carrying miR- 122 (Lv-miR 122) and investigate {{the function of}} stably expressed miR- 122 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. MethodsPre-miR- 122 was cloned into lentiviral vector pLUNIG to obtain the Lv-miR 122 that had stable expression of miR- 122; Lv-miR 122 was packaged in 293 T cells along with other three vectors pRRE, pRSV-REV, and pCMV-VSVG, and virus supernatant was obtained by concentration; the virus supernatant was used to infect HCC cell line HepG 2. The expression of miR- 122 was measured by Q-RT-PCR. The proliferation of HepG 2 cells was analyzed by MTT assay and colony formation <b>assay.</b> <b>Blank</b> lentiviral vector (Lv-Ctrl) -infected HepG 2 cells and uninfected HepG 2 cells were used as controls. Results The expression of miR- 122 was significantly higher in Lv-miR 122 -infected HepG 2 cells than in Lv-Ctrl-infected HepG 2 cells (t= 10. 745, P＜ 0. 01). The Lv-miR 122 -infected HepG 2 cells (with stable expression of miR- 122) had significantly suppressed proliferation compared with Lv-Ctrl-infected and uninfected HepG 2 cells (P＜ 0. 05 for both comparisons); moreover, miR- 122 significantly inhibited the colony formation of HepG 2 cells (t＝ 5. 256, P＜ 0. 01). ConclusionThe Lv-miR 122 can be successfully constructed, and the carried miR- 122 can be stably expressed and can inhibit the proliferation of HepG 2 cells...|$|E
40|$|Anaerobic {{digestion}} is a multi-step {{process for}} conversion of organics wastes to methane (CH 4), for energy and biofuels production. The {{range of application}} is expanding, {{as well as the}} covered studies. The variety of equipment and methods used for access the biomethane potential in batch assays makes their comparison very difficult. This work aims to evaluate the influence of some parameters, like the type of inoculum (suspended sludge, granular sludge and manure), the pre-consumption of the residual substrate and the volume of the headspace in the <b>blank</b> <b>assay</b> (no addition of substrate), in determination of biochemical methane potential (BMP) and anaerobic biodegradability (B 0) of wastes. The <b>blank</b> <b>assays</b> used to discount the CH 4 produced are crucial to a correct determination of BMP and B 0. Moreover, higher amounts of CH 4 produced in smaller volumes of headspaces could minimize errors propagation. The degassing process appears to be unnecessary for the suspended and granular sludge...|$|R
40|$|Protein-bound steroids can be {{separated}} from free steroids using microcolumns of silica gel coated with an hydrophobic (octadecyl) solid phase. The bound fraction is eluted in the assay buffer, whereas the free fraction is retained quantitatively on the column in the first step and can be recovered in methanol. Both fractions can be quantitated directly (e. g. by liquid scintillation spectrometry when using radioactive ligands) or kept for further analysis (e. g. by TLC, HPLC etc.). Separation of the bound and free fractions is rapid, accurate and reproducible; intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation are lower than 5 and 10 %, respectively. Recovery of radioactive steroids is high (usually over 85 %) and can be estimated separately for each sample. Since <b>assay</b> <b>blanks</b> are very low (typically less than 0. 1 % of input), this new method, which could be termed "hydrophobic interaction chromatography" (HIC), should prove especially useful {{for the development of}} sensitive binding assays, particularly in the field of steroid receptors. The HIC method compared well with three methods currently used for steroid binding assays, namely adsorption of unbound steroids on dextran-coated charcoal, gel filtration on Sephadex LH- 20 and adsorption of steroid-protein complexes on DEAE-cellulose filters. Examples of application described here include studies on human plasma sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and SP 2 placental protein (saturation analysis, binding specificity etc.), the separation of antibody-bound steroids in a radioimmunoassay and the estimation of androgen binding to rat epididymal androgen binding protein (rABP). Receptor assays are illustrated by saturation analysis of the mouse uterine oestrogen receptor and of the androgen receptor in the human genital skin...|$|R
40|$|Long-chain {{fatty acids}} (LCFA) are {{energy-rich}} compounds, which are abundantly present in raw and waste materials. Thus, wastewaters that contain LCFA may yield {{high levels of}} methane in an anaerobic digestion process. Biogas formation from LCFAcontaining wastewater is a sustainable technology that warrants further investigation, specifically in terms of more fundamental microbiological aspects. The aim of this work is to get more insights into the syntrophic microbial communities that degrade LCFA anaerobically. Bacterial shifts of a mesophilic sludge incubated {{in the presence of}} palmitic, stearic or oleic acid was estimated by means of automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA). Slightly differences were observed between the communities incubated with saturated LCFA (palmitic and stearic acids) and the ones of the <b>blank</b> <b>assay.</b> On the other hand, evident changes were found between ARISA profiles of the communities that were incubated with oleic acid and the ones obtained for the <b>blank</b> <b>assay.</b> These results suggest that the microbial communities that degrade saturated fatty acids are very close to each other and different from the ones that degrade unsaturated fatty acids...|$|R
30|$|MTS and CellTiter-Blue are {{colorimetric}} and fluorescent assays (respectively) used {{to measure}} cell viability via non-specific redox enzyme activity. CellTiter-Glo is a luminescent assay {{used to measure}} cell viability by ATP level. Cells (100 μL, 1 × 105 cells/ml) were seeded into a 96 -well flat-bottomed plate (white for Titer-Glo) and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C with 5 % CO 2. The medium was replaced with increasing MNP concentrations (1.56 to 25 μg mL- 1) (in triplicates). The cells were incubated for 24, 72, 120 and 168 h (for 120 - and 168 -hr incubations, the medium was replaced at 72 h with fresh medium containing appropriate concentrations of MNPs). The cells were washed (with PBS, three times) and replaced with fresh medium (100 μL). MTS (20 μL) or CellTiter-Blue (20 μL) reagents {{were added to the}} wells, and the plate was incubated for 4 h protected from light. Absorbance (MTS) was recorded at 490 nm, and fluorescence intensity (CellTiter-Blue) was recorded (excitation 560 nm, emission 590 nm). To eliminate possible interference between MNPs and assay readings, cells treated with same concentrations of MNPs but without addition of assay reagents were used as <b>blank</b> wells. Both <b>assays</b> were measured on a Tecan M 200 multimode plate reader (Tecan Austria GmbH, Grödig, Austria). CellTiter-Glo reagent was added to the wells (50 μL and 50 -μL media) and incubated at room temperature for 10 min protected from light. The luminescence was recorded using the same multimode plate reader. As per MTS and Titer-Blue <b>assays,</b> <b>blank</b> wells (with no reagents) were measured for luminescence and deducted from the values in experimental wells. Values of viability of treated cells were expressed as a percentage of that from corresponding control cells. All experiments were repeated at least three times. All assay kits were purchased from Promega, Southampton, UK.|$|R
30|$|The {{need of a}} {{blocking}} {{agent was}} questioned as the present ELISA kit was pre-coated and the manufactures protocol does not suggest blocking of the primary antibody before application of samples. We chose three different settings to evaluate a potential need of this. We tested this in wells with <b>blank</b> <b>assay</b> diluent only and 2  h at RT with either PBS with 5  % skimmed milk or PBS with 1  % BSA or no blocking prior to adding assay diluent.|$|R

Both capture and detection antibodies were titrated at three different concentrations measuring <b>blank</b> <b>assay</b> diluent (noise) and assay diluent with 1000 pg/ml of recombinant human (rh) IL- 24 (signal). The optimal concentrations {{were found to}} be 2 μg/ml for the capture antibody and 0.8 μg/ml for the detection antibody (Figure  1 B). Furthermore, an amplification step with biotinyl-tyramide was tested. This increased the {{signal-to-noise ratio}} from 4.7 to 9.9 increasing the sensitivity of the assay (Figures  1 C and 1 D).|$|R
30|$|The {{activity}} of S-HMGSH dehydrogenase was assayed {{according to the}} method of [Kato (1990)] with a slight modification (see below). The activity was assayed at 35 °C by the time and reductant-dependent formation of NADH from NAD+. The composition of the reaction mixture was as follows: 1.0 [*]ml 50 [*]mM Tris–HCl buffer (pH 8.0), 0.25 [*]ml 120 [*]mM glutathione, 0.25 [*]ml 60 [*]mM NAD+, 0.25 [*]ml 60 [*]mM formaldehyde (5.4 [*]mM final concentration) and 1.0 [*]ml deionized water.

40|$|An LC-MS/MS assay {{based on}} a {{signature}} peptide was developed and fully validated for the quantitation of bovine lactoferrin in infant formulas. Three unreported signature peptides were derived and identified from the tryptic peptides of bovine lactoferrin. The peptide ETTVFENLPEK was used for quantification based on <b>assay</b> performance. The <b>blank</b> matrix camel milk powder and bovine lactoferrin protein standards were mixed and spiked with stable isotope-labeled internal standard to establish a calibration curve.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Microbial {{virulence}} {{factors are}} responsible for tissue damage in hosts. Candida albicans is an opportunistic pathogen that constitutes an increasing risk of infection, especially for immunosuppressed or immunocompromised patients. OBJECTIVE: The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the effect of a static non-uniform magnetic field on the phenotype expression of different strains of Candida albicans. METHODS: The strains of Candida albicans were grown on phospholipase-agar, according to Shimizu et al. (1996) and incubated at 37 ºC inside a magnetic field (except the <b>assays</b> used as <b>blank).</b> The magnetic field was generated by two magnetite plates (Figure 1) and standardized as a function of distance versus number of magnetic plates (Figure 2). The magnetic field was of 500 gauss in the central part between the two magnetic plates.

40|$|The mirids, Sahlbergella singularis Hagl and Distantiella theobroma (Dist) (Heteroptera: Miridae), {{are major}} insect pests of cocoa, a {{valuable}} crop in West Africa. Their control by {{the application of}} insecticides is problematic in terms of safety and cost. Therefore, this study was undertaken to determine the potential for use of mirid sex pheromone trapping as an alternative, environmentally-acceptable method of managing the mirids. Based on the behavioural responses of the mirids to pheromones in traps, parameters were standardised for efficient performance of the traps. A range of five blends of the synthetic pheromone, the diester, hexyl (R) - 3 - ((E) - 2 -butenoyl) -butyrate and the monoester, hexyl (R) - 3 -hydroxybutyrate, impregnated in polyethylene vials were <b>assayed</b> with a <b>blank</b> control. Blends of 1000 : 500 μg and 1000 : 1000 μg respectively attracted significantly higher numbers of male S. singularis than other blends and the lure attracted male mirids optimally for four weeks with minimal reduction in eight weeks. Field bioassays were conducted to determine the appropriate trap design for pheromone trapping from four models; 2. 5 litre and 4. 5 litre plastic water bottles, sticky plastic plates, cylinder and standard rectangular traps. All models were equally effective. A field experiment was conducted with sticky glue {{on the outside of}} the traps. Combined inside and outside surfaces caught more mirids than the inside surface alone which caught only about 23...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{essential}} requirements for enzyme assays are described and frequently occurring errors and pitfalls {{as well as}} their avoidance are discussed. The main factors, which must be considered for assaying enzymes, are temperature, pH, ionic strength and the proper concentrations of the essential components like substrates and enzymes. Standardization of these parameters would be desirable, but the diversity of the features of different enzymes prevents unification of assay conditions. Nevertheless, many enzymes, especially those from mammalian sources, possess a pH optimum near the physiological pH of 7. 5, and the body temperature of about 37 °C can serve as assay temperature, although because of experimental reasons frequently 25 °C is preferred. But in many cases the particular features of the individual enzyme dictate special assay conditions, which can deviate considerably from recommended conditions. In addition, exact values for the concentrations of assay components such as substrates and enzymes cannot be given, unless general rules depending on the relative degree of saturation can be stated. Rules for performing the enzyme assay, appropriate handling, methodical aspects, preparation of <b>assay</b> mixtures and <b>blanks,</b> choice of the assay time, are discussed and suggestions to avoid frequent and trivial errors are given. Particularities of more complex enzyme assays, including reversible reactions and coupled tests are considered. Finally the treatment of experimental data to estimate the enzyme activity is described. The procedure for determining the initial enzyme velocity and its transformation into defined enzyme units as well as suggestions for documentation of the results are presented...|$|R
40|$|The zone of {{inhibition}} {{method to}} test the release of biocides from paper and board food contact materials was evaluated. The method tests the paper by placing a small specimen directly onto culture plates of Bacillus subtilis and Aspergillus niger. The principle is that any extractable biocide will diffuse from the paper into the surrounding nutrient medium and so inhibit growth of the microorganism in the vicinity. The test {{was found to have}} insufficient sensitivity for assuring food safety, where detection limits for migration at or below the mgl - 1 (parts per million) level are needed. Also, the test does not mimic the actual or foreseeable conditions of use since most paper/board materials are not intended for direct contact with an aqueous medium for up to 3 days at 30 °C (B. subtilis) or 25 °C (A. niger), which are the incubation conditions used. The sensitivity of the test was increased approximately 100 -fold by preparing a concentrated extract of the paper to be tested and applying this extract to the <b>assay</b> via a <b>blank</b> paper carrier. This was done using methanol as a good solvent for most biocides, as a proof of principle. Other solvents or food simulants could be used to mimic the conditions of use intended for the particular paper/board samples under examination, e. g. contact with dry, fatty, aqueous or acidic foods, hot or cold. Twenty-four plain (unconverted) paper and board samples and 100 food packaging samples were evaluated using the modified procedure. The results revealed that the method has been developed to the stage where background cytotoxic action of normal paper constituents gives a weak response. Unlike the original method, therefore, the modified method with its improved sensitivity and the facility to link with the intended food contact conditions may be considered a suitable bioassay screening test to complement chemical analysis of paper/board for composition and migration. © 2012 Crown Copyright...|$|R
40|$|Risk {{assessment}} for air pollutants remains a complex task. In this project, we aimed to assess air pollutant risk through {{the combination of}} active air sampling, bioanalytical assessment and selective chemical analysis. To achieve this air samples were collected over several weeks from both indoor and outdoor sites and subjected {{to a range of}} bioanalytical assays. Both XAD (gas phase) and filter paper (particles) samples were tested for responses in genotoxicity, Ah-receptor response, estrogenicity and respiratory toxicity assays. The method of sampling, sample extraction and processing principally targeted semivolatile organic chemicals. Phase 1 of the study concerned the set-up of <b>assays,</b> evaluation of <b>blanks</b> and the validation of responses to known chemicals of concerns. Five endpoints were included in the evaluation including non-specific cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, Ah-receptor response, estrogenicity and respiratory immunotoxicity. Dose response assessments for test chemicals were carried out with all assays and standard operating procedures for the testing have been developed. Blank toxicity evaluation found that sampling matrices and the preparation of these requires some attention and it is important to use ultrapure solvent for the preparation of the sampling matrices. Phases 2 and 3 of the project focussed on the testing of actual samples collected at different sites in Queensland and Western Australia. During phase 2, the first evaluation of air samples showed that the assays could detect differences between different sites and in both the gas and particle phase. For example using extracts of filter papers collected from the indoor domestic site a genotoxic and estrogenic response was detectable whereas the extracts of the XAD fraction from the same site registered an effect in the respiratory assay. In the sample collected outdoors at the same location genotoxic and estrogenic responses in the XAD fraction were quantifiable. Phase 3 of the project tested samples collected at a wider range of sites in winter 2007. These sites included an indoor industrial location, two offices, two sites near major roadways, a residential area, light industry and a background site. Selected samples were also subjected to an aqueous extraction for examination of any ionic/water-soluble chemicals present. Results showed that overall, air samples produced a more genotoxic response in terms of direct acting chemicals (-S 9) at both indoor and outdoor sites. In most cases the gas phase fraction of these samples was more toxic than the particle phase. The gas and particles phases of the samples collected at the indoor industrial site and a high traffic site were the most toxic. Interestingly the gas phase from the two office sites and the samples collected at the polluted sites produced similar genotoxic responses. Air samples collected at most sites also produced genotoxic responses for chemicals that required metabolic activation to damage DNA (+S 9). However, in general, toxicity due to these chemicals was lower than that associated with direct acting chemicals. The genotoxic effect of chemicals requiring metabolic activation was detected in both the gas and particle phase of samples. The gas phase samples collected at the offices and at a high traffic site recorded the highest toxicity. However genotoxic effects were also detected in filter papers collected from three outdoor sites. These sites were all located near roadways. These results suggest that even though industrial and vehicular related National Research Centre for Environmental Toxicology Page 3 of 49 activities are associated with the release of genotoxic pollutants, there were also unidentified sources of such chemicals at the office sites. Air samples collected from all sites elicited an Ah receptor response in the CAFLUX bioassay. Results (expressed as TCDD equivalent air concentrations) showed that in contrast to genotoxicity assessed on the umu assay, the Ah-receptor activity was primarily associated with the particle phase of samples. Surprisingly, the sample collected at the high density residential site exceeded equivalent concentrations measured in samples collected at both high traffic sites. Further testing of two samples indicated that the response on CAFLUX was possibly due to chemicals other than dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs. All air samples showed a response in the E-screen bioassays for estrogenicity. Results were expressed as estradiol equivalency adjusted for air volume sampled. In all cases the gas phase of air samples was more estrogenic than the particle phase, usually by a factor 2 or more. The gas phase samples collected from indoors exhibited the highest estrogenicity of all samples. Both water and solvent extracts were tested on the respiratory toxicity assay. Water extracts of filter papers from both high traffic sites were significantly different from one of two field blanks. Solvent extracted samples were not significantly different from the corresponding field blanks. Further work is required to determine why certain samples, including the second field blank, tested as cytotoxic. This study demonstrates that we are exposed {{to a wide variety of}} chemical pollutants that have a range of potential health effects. This work has also identified that the gas phase is potentially an important pathway for exposure, particularly for genotoxic effects. Chemicals inhaled via the gas phase are more efficiently transported into the lung and adsorbed by tissue. Traditionally, investigations into the health risk associated with semivolatile organic pollutants in air have not separated the gas and particle phases. A comparison between the umu assay based benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) equivalencies and equivalences determined using chemical analysis showed that in the particle phase only 10 % of chemicals and in the gas phase, less than 1 % of chemicals responsible for the observed effect have been identified. Further work is required to identify the other chemicals that are contributing to the genotoxic response in samples. In contrast, CAFLUX results showed a significant correlation with the PAH analysis, suggesting the dominant component of the samples causing this response were PAHs. This area of research is rapidly producing useful techniques to expand the toolbox available for characterising air quality. Importantly this report shows that the results from such bioanalytical tests could be communicated in terms that were meaningful for air quality managers by using specific chemical equivalencies for comparison to guideline values. This approach has the added advantage of accounting for significantly more of the chemical constituents in a sample. As the comparison to PAH results showed, the traditional approach to air quality management which targets specific chemicals could underestimate the potential risk of exposure at certain sites including indoor locations where humans spend a significant amount of time...|$|R
