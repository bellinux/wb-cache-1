50|$|Three {{nutritional}} {{strategies are}} seen in dinoflagellates: phototrophy, mixotrophy, and heterotrophy. Phototrophs can be photoautotrophs or auxotrophs. Mixotrophic dinoflagellates are photosynthetically active, but are also heterotrophic. Facultative mixotrophs, in which <b>autotrophy</b> or heterotrophy is sufficient for nutrition, are classified as amphitrophic. If both forms are required, the organisms are mixotrophic sensu stricto. Some free-living dinoflagellates do not have chloroplasts, but host a phototrophic endosymbiont. A few dinoflagellates may use alien chloroplasts (cleptochloroplasts), obtained from food (kleptoplasty). Some dinoflagellates may feed on other organisms as predators or parasites.|$|E
50|$|Researcher Thomas Cavalier-Smith {{investigating}} {{the origins of}} apicomplexans and dinozoans, suggested a joint category Myzozoa encompassing both of these superphyla, plus related groups the colpodellids and perkinsids. By morphology and lifestyle,V. brassicaformis more closely resembles an ancestral Myzozoan than C. velia does. V. brassicaformis has a circular plastid genome as an ancestral Myzozoan would have had, and is also capable of hunting (myzocytosis) as they were. These two lifestyles, <b>autotrophy</b> and heterotrophy, found in one organism (V. brassicaformis) represent the store of potential that was able {{to lead to the}} Myzozoan radiation.|$|E
5000|$|Paracoccus pantotrophus is a {{bacterium}} that can live chemoorganoheterotrophically, whereby a large variety of organic compounds can be metabolized. Also a facultative chemolithoautotrophic metabolism is possible, {{as seen in}} colorless sulfur bacteria (some Thiobacillus), whereby sulfur compounds such as hydrogen sulfide, elemental sulfur, or thiosulfate are oxidized to sulfate. The sulfur compounds serve as electron donors and are consumed to produce ATP. The carbon source for these organisms can be carbon dioxide (<b>autotrophy)</b> or organic carbon (heterotrophy).Organoheterotrophy can occur under aerobic or under anaerobic conditions; lithoautotrophy takes place aerobically.|$|E
50|$|Ciliates are a model alveolate, {{having been}} genetically studied in great depth over the longest period of any alveolate lineage. They are unusual among eukaryotes in that {{reproduction}} involves a micronucleus and a macronucleus. Their reproduction is easily {{studied in the}} lab, and made them a model eukaryote historically. Being entirely predatory and lacking any remnant plastid, their development as a phylum illustrates how predation and <b>autotrophy</b> are in dynamic balance and that the balance can swing one way or other {{at the point of}} origin of a new phylum from mixotrophic ancestors, causing one ability to be lost.|$|E
5000|$|Somewhere between 3.5 and 2.3 {{billion years}} ago, the {{ancestors}} of cyanobacteria evolved oxygenic photosynthesis, enabling {{the use of the}} abundant yet relatively oxidized molecule H2O as an electron donor to the electron transport chain of light-catalyzed proton-pumping responsible for efficient ATP synthesis. [...] When this evolutionary breakthrough occurred, <b>autotrophy</b> (growth using inorganic carbon as the sole carbon source) is believed to have already been developed. However, the proliferation of cyanobacteria, due to their novel ability to exploit water as a source of electrons, radically altered the global environment by oxygenating the atmosphere and by achieving large fluxes of CO2 consumption.|$|E
5000|$|Most {{species of}} Euglena have photosynthesizing chloroplasts {{within the body}} of the cell, which enable them to feed by <b>autotrophy,</b> like plants. However, they can also take {{nourishment}} heterotrophically, like animals. Since Euglena have features of both animals and plants, early taxonomists, working within the Linnaean three-kingdom system of biological classification, found them difficult to classify. It was the question of where to put such [...] "unclassifiable" [...] creatures that prompted Ernst Haeckel to add a third living kingdom (a fourth kingdom in toto) to the Animale, Vegetabile (and Lapideum meaning Mineral) of Linnaeus: the Kingdom Protista.|$|E
5000|$|... "Auto" [...] and ‘trophicos" [...] {{are derived}} from Greek words, where [...] "auto" [...] means self and ‘trophicos" [...] refers to nursing, tending or feeding, which {{indicates}} it's <b>autotrophy.</b> The abundance and distribution of subgroups within the Epsilonproteobacteria and the genusSulfurimonas have been detected {{in the water column}} using a number of techniques including 16S rRNA cloning, catalyzed reporter deposition and fluorescence in situ hybridization (CARD-FISH), and quantitative PCR measurements. Water samples were collected at different depths and the concentrations of nutrients, oxygen, and sulfur measured immediately after sampling. The sample was measured for carbon fixation rate, and the DNA extracted and specific sequences amplified by PCR.|$|E
50|$|H. arenicola cannot divide without {{containing}} the endosymbiont. But, unlike a fully integrated organelle, the Nephroselmis alga does not divide {{along with the}} host cell. When the host cell divides, one of the daughter cells receives the Nephroselmis cell and the other daughter returns to a heterotrophic lifestyle. Hence, the mother protist gives rise to green-coloured and white-coloured daughter cells. The latter behaves like a predator until it ingests a Nephroselmis green alga. The alga then loses its flagella and cytoskeleton, while the Hatena, now a host, switches to photosynthetic nutrition, gains {{the ability to move}} towards light and loses its feeding apparatus. Thus, the protist exhibits an unusual life cycle of alternating <b>autotrophy</b> and heterotrophy.|$|E
50|$|Disturbances {{can affect}} trophic {{relationships}} {{in a variety}} of ways, such as simplifying foodwebs, causing trophic cascades, and shifting carbon sources and major pathways of energy flow (Power et al. 1985, Power et al. 2008). Part of understanding how disturbance will impact trophic dynamics lies in understanding disturbance impacts to stream metabolism (Holtgrieve et al. 2010). For example, in Alaska streams, disturbance of the benthos by spawning salmon caused distinct changes in stream metabolism; autotrophic streams became net heterotrophic during the spawning run, then reverted to <b>autotrophy</b> after the spawning season (Holtgrieve and Schindler 2011). There is evidence that this seasonal disturbance impacts trophic dynamics of benthic invertebrates and in turn their vertebrate predators (Holtgrieve and Schindler 2011, Moore and Schindler 2008). Wildfire disturbance may have similar metabolic and trophic impacts in streams.|$|E
5000|$|Peranema is a genus of {{free-living}} flagellate protists, {{with more}} than 20 accepted species, varying in size between 8 and 200 micrometers.

[...] Although they belong to the class Euglenoidea, and are morphologically similar to the green Euglena, Peranema have no chloroplasts, and cannot feed by <b>autotrophy.</b> Instead, they capture live prey, such as yeast, bacteria and other flagellates, consuming them {{with the help of a}} rigid feeding apparatus called a [...] "rod-organ." [...] Unlike the green Euglenids, they lack both an eyespot (stigma), and the paraflagellar body (photoreceptor) that is normally coupled with that organelle.

50|$|Marine dinoflagellate species undergo {{three major}} trophic modes: <b>autotrophy,</b> mixotrophy and heterotrophy. Many species of {{dinoflagellates}} were previously {{assumed to be}} exclusively autotrophic; however, recent research has revealed that many dinoflagellates that {{were thought to be}} exclusively phototrophic are actually mixotrophic. Mixotrophic dinoflagellates can undergo both photosynthesis and phagocytosis as methods of feeding. Mixotrophic dinoflagellates with individual plastids that depend mostly on photosynthesis can prey on other cells as their secondary source of nutrients. On the other hand, mixotrophic dinoflagellates with individual plastids that depend mainly on phagocytosis are also photosynthetic due to chloroplasts 'stolen' from their prey (kleptochloroplasts) or because of algal endosymbionts. It was discovered that the mixotrophic dinoflagellates Gonyaulax polygramma and Scrippsiella spp. can engulf small-size prey using their apical horn while larger prey are engulfed via their sulcus, showing that dinoflagellates can have more than one mouth for feeding. Moreover, mixotrophic dinoflagellates belonging to the species Karlodinium armiger, can capture small prey by direct engulfment or can use an extendable peduncle to capture larger prey.|$|E

30|$|At {{the end of}} the 16 -day cultivation, {{the main}} FA content for dry weight and its {{proportion}} in TFAs of the three culture modes are shown in Table  3. The FAs were divided into saturated FAs (SFAs), monounsaturated FAs (MUFAs), and polyunsaturated FAs (PUFAs). The proportions of these three kinds of FAs were shown in Fig.  4. The proportions of the three kinds of FAs were comparable in the mixotrophy and the <b>autotrophy.</b> The PUFAs had the highest proportion with 51.1 and 51.4 % for the <b>autotrophy</b> and the mixotrophy, respectively, followed by the SFAs with 30.5 and 30.6 % for the <b>autotrophy</b> and the mixotrophy, respectively and the MUFAs with 18.0 and 18.4 % in the mixotrophy and the <b>autotrophy,</b> respectively (Fig.  4).

In addition, the proportion of the PUFAs decreased markedly, the MUFAs increased, and the SFAs slightly increased in the heterotrophy.

40|$|Over {{the last}} few decades, sessile benthic organisms from the Mediterranean Sea have {{suffered}} from the global warming of the world’s oceans, and several mass mortality events were observed during warm summers.

40|$|Photosynthesis {{competent}} <b>autotrophy</b> {{should be}} established during the postgerminative stage of plant growth. Among the multiple factors, light plays a decisive role in the switch from heterotrophic to autotrophic growth. Under dark condition, the rapeseed hypocotyl extends quickly with an apical hook, and the cotyledon is yellow and folded, and maintains high level of the isocitrate lyase (ICL). By contrast, in the light, the hypocotyl extends slowly, the cotyledon unfolds and turns green, the ICL content changes in parallel with the cotyledon greening. To reveal metabolic adaptations during the establishment of postgerminative <b>autotrophy</b> in rapeseed, we conducted comparative proteomic and metabolomic analyses of the cotyledons of seedlings grown under light versus dark conditions. Under both conditions, the increase of the protease, fatty acids β-oxidation and glyoxylate-cycle related proteins was accompanied with rapid degradation of the stored proteins and lipids with an accumulation of the amino acids, while light condition partially retarded these conversions. Light significantly induced the expression of chlorophyll-binding and photorespiration related proteins, resulting in an increase of the reducing-sugar. However, the levels of some chlide conversion, Calvin-cycle and photorespiration related proteins also accumulated in dark grown cotyledons, implying that the transition from heterotrophy to <b>autotrophy</b> is programmed in the seed rather than induced by light. Various anti-stress systems, e. g., redox related proteins, salicylic acid, proline and chaperones, were employed to release the oxidative stress, which was mainly derived from lipid oxidation or photorespiration, under both conditions. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the differential molecular responses of rapeseed cotyledons to light and dark conditions, which will facilitate further study on the complex mechanism underlying the transition from heterotrophy to <b>autotrophy...</b>|$|E
40|$|Many regard {{metabolism}} {{as one of}} {{the central}} phenomena (or criteria) of life. Yet, the earliest infrabiological systems may have been devoid of metabolism: such systems would have been extreme heterotrophs. We do not know what level of complexity is attainable for chemical systems without enzymatic aid. Lack of template-instructed enzymatic catalysis may put a ceiling on complexity owing to inevitable spontaneous decay and wear and tear of chemodynamical machines. Views on the origin of metabolism critically depend on the assumptions concerning the sites of synthesis and consumption of organic compounds. If these sites are different, non-enzymatic origin of <b>autotrophy</b> is excluded. Whether <b>autotrophy</b> is secondary or not, it seems that protocell boundaries may have become more selective with time, concurrent with the enzymatization of the metabolic network. Primary heterotrophy and <b>autotrophy</b> imply pathway innovation and retention, respectively. The idea of metabolism–membrane coevolution leads to a scenario of progressive sequestration of the emerging living system from its exterior milieu. Comparative data on current protein enzymes may shed some light on such a primeval process by analogy, since two main ideas about enzymatization (the retroevolution and the patchwork scenarios) may not necessarily be mutually exclusive and the earliest enzymatic system may have used ribozymes rather than proteins...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that the disagreement traditionally reported between in vitro incubation and in situ estimates of oxygen net community production (NCP) could be explained, at least partially, by undersampling episodic pulses of net <b>autotrophy</b> associated with mesoscale dynamics.

40|$|We {{assess the}} use to which {{bioinformatics}} {{in the form}} of bacterial genome sequences, functional gene probes and the protein sequence databases can be applied to hypotheses about obligate <b>autotrophy</b> in eubacteria. Obligate methanotrophy and obligate <b>autotrophy</b> among the chemo- and photo-lithotrophic bacteria lack satisfactory explanation a century or more after their discovery. Various causes of these phenomena have been suggested, which we review {{in the light of the}} information currently available. Among these suggestions is the absence in vivo of a functional alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. The advent of complete and partial genome sequences of diverse autotrophs, methylotrophs and methanotrophs makes it possible to probe the reasons for the absence of activity of this enzyme. We review the role and evolutionary origins of the Krebs cycle in relation to autotrophic metabolism and describe the use of in silico methods to probe the partial and complete genome sequences of a variety of obligate genera for genes encoding the subunits of the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex. Nitrosomonas europaea and Methylococcus capsulatus, which lack the functional enzyme, were found to contain the coding sequences for the El and E 2 subunits of alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. Comparing the predicted physicochemical properties of the polypeptides coded by the genes confirmed the putative gene products were similar to the active alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase subunits of heterotrophs. These obligate species are thus genomically competent with respect to this enzyme but are apparently incapable of producing a functional enzyme. Probing of the full and incomplete genomes of some cyanobacterial and methanogenic genera and Aquifex confirms or suggests the absence of the genes for at least one of the three components of the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex in these obligate organisms. It is recognized that absence of a single functional enzyme may not explain obligate <b>autotrophy</b> in all cases and may indeed be only be one of a number of controls that impose obligate metabolism. Availability of more genome sequences from obligate genera will enable assessment of whether obligate <b>autotrophy</b> is due to the absence of genes for a few or many steps in organic compound metabolism. This problem needs the technologies and mindsets of the present generation of molecular microbiologists to resolve it. (C) 2003 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.
