25|$|<b>Automatic</b> <b>synchronization</b> can {{be turned}} off in favor of {{manually}} copying individual songs or complete playlists. iTunes supports copying music to an iPod; however, only music and videos purchased from the iTunes Store can be transferred from the iPod back to iTunes. This functionality was added after third-party software was written which allowed users to copy all content back to their computer. It is also possible to copy from the iPod using ordinary Unix command line tools, or by enabling hidden file viewing in Windows Explorer, then copying music from the iPod drive to a local disk for backup. Doing this can be confusing because the files are arranged {{in such a way}} that their folders and (depending on iPod and iTunes versions) file names are seemingly picked at random as they are put on the iPod. It is worth noting, however, that the files (along with their embedded title and artist information) remain unchanged. It is therefore less confusing to let iTunes reimport, reorganize, and rename all of the files after they are backed up.|$|E
2500|$|Recent {{advances}} in technology in both DJ hardware and software can provide assisted or automatic completion of some traditional DJ techniques and skills. Examples include phrasing and beatmatching, which can be partially or completely automated by utilizing DJ software that performs <b>automatic</b> <b>synchronization</b> of sound recordings, a feature commonly labelled [...] "sync". Most DJ mixers now include a beat-counter which analyzes the tempo of an incoming sound source and displays its tempo in beats per minute (BPM), which may assist with beatmatching analog sound sources.|$|E
2500|$|Spontaneous {{synchronization}} of weakly coupled pendulum clocks {{was noted}} by the Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens as early as 1673. [...] Around {{the turn of the}} 19th century, Lord Rayleigh observed synchronization of weakly coupled organ pipes and tuning forks. [...] In 1919, W. H. Eccles and J. H. Vincent found that two electronic oscillators that had been tuned to oscillate at slightly different frequencies but that were coupled to a resonant circuit would soon oscillate at the same frequency. [...] <b>Automatic</b> <b>synchronization</b> of electronic oscillators was described in 1923 by Edward Victor Appleton.|$|E

There are 350 brief animations, running two or three seconds each, showing 17 characters from the show in numerous poses. The CD-ROM delivery, unfortunately, falls flat." [...] He explained that [...] "Simpsons Cartoon Studio is awkward to operate and limited in what it can accomplish, producing animated sequences that are jerky and out of sync. The CD-ROM comes with 15 cartoons created by the developers, running from 10 seconds to 55 seconds. None flow smoothly or tell funny stories. There's no reason to expect {{the rest of us}} will do any better." [...] Similarly, Nancy Malitz of The Detroit News wrote that [...] "you move the characters around and invent the scenarios, but in the end you might feel your creativity wasn't heavily challenged. The whole deal is essentially a cut-and-paste operation. You can't create characters of your own, and the kind of <b>automatic</b> <b>synchronization</b> of sounds with movement that you see in a simple product like Video Jam isn't available, so things look sort of choppy no matter how hard you try." ...|$|E

40|$|<b>Automatic</b> lyrics <b>synchronization</b> for karaoke {{applications}} is a {{major challenge}} {{in the field of}} music information retrieval. An important pre-requisite in order to precisely synchronize the music and corresponding text is the detection of single phonemes in the vocal part of polyphonic music. This paper describes a system, which detects the phonemes based on a state-of-the-art audio information retrieval system with harmonics extraction and synthesizing as pre-processing method. The extraction algorithm is based on common speech recognition low-level features, such as MFCC and LPC. In order to distinguish phonemes, three different classification techniques (SVM, GMM and MLP) have been used and their results are depicted in the paper. ...|$|R
