I found out in old mythology they are supposed to represent the soul. I think that's very appropriate".|$|E
500|$|Black's {{voice has}} been {{described}} as raspy, death growls often appearing in her music. In an interview with The Advocate, Black revealed that she has <b>always</b> <b>had</b> <b>this</b> talent and that it is something she has never practiced. RedOne, the producer who signed her to his label, says that Black's voice and attitude reminded him of Joan Jett. He concluded that [...] "he can scream and do things with her voice that nobody can do. She is uncompromising in pursuing her own creative vision. She's taking everything that's old and making it futuristic and bringing rock and roll back in her own way." [...] Black styled her musical genre [...] "horror-pop". It {{has been described}} as the love child between Marilyn Manson and Britney Spears, a fusion of dance-pop and darker industrial themes. Black cites that Spears inspires her deep love for choreography, while Manson inspires the sound and attitude of her lyrics and performance style.|$|E

I sat down and played {{a little bit and}} they started laughing.

2500|$|The {{designers}} {{started working}} with the director before Star Wars was approved by 20th Century Fox. For four to five months, in a studio in Kensal Rise, England, they attempted to plan {{the creation of the}} props and sets with [...] "no money". Although Lucas initially provided funds using his earnings from American Graffiti, it was inadequate. As they could not afford to dress the sets, Christian was forced to use unconventional methods and materials to achieve the desired look. He suggested that Lucas use scrap in making the dressings, and the director agreed. Christian said, [...] "I've <b>always</b> <b>had</b> <b>this</b> idea. I used to do it with models when I was a kid. I'd stick things on them and we'd make things look old." [...] Barry, Christian, and their team began designing the props and sets at Elstree Studios.|$|E
2500|$|Paltrow {{was born}} in Los Angeles, the {{daughter}} of actress Blythe Danner and film producer-director Bruce Paltrow. She has a younger brother, Jake Paltrow, who is a director and screenwriter. Paltrow's father was Jewish, while her mother is from a Christian background. She was raised celebrating [...] "both Jewish and Christian holidays." [...] Her brother had a traditional Bar Mitzvah when he turned 13. Her father's Ashkenazi Jewish family emigrated from Belarus and Poland, while her mother has Pennsylvania Dutch (German), and some English, ancestry. Paltrow's paternal great-great-grandfather was a rabbi in Nowogród, Poland, and a descendant of the well known [...] "Paltrowicz" [...] family of rabbis from Kraków. Her half-cousin is actress Katherine Moennig (through her mother). She is a second cousin of former U.S. Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords (AZ-08) (through her father). Her uncle is opera singer and actor Harry Danner, whose daughter, actress Hillary Danner, is Paltrow's cousin and close friend. Paltrow recalls their family gatherings: [...] "Hillary and I <b>always</b> <b>had</b> <b>this</b> in common, and do to this day [...] cooking for people we love, eating, hanging out as a family. It's how we were raised. It's what we do." [...] Another cousin is Rebekah Paltrow Neumann, whose spouse is the Israeli-American billionaire Adam Neumann, founder of WeWork.|$|E

6000|$|It was {{beautiful}} to see Jerusalem rounding {{the angle of}} a wall, and turning his head about to observe how {{the remainder of the}} procession was coming on. He was once circumnavigating a small out-house, when, catching sight of his own hinder-quarters, he flew into a terrible rage. The sight of another dog <b>always</b> <b>had</b> <b>this</b> effect upon Jerusalem, and more especially when, as in this case, he thought he could grasp an unfair advantage. So Jerusalem took after that retreating foe as hard as ever he could hook it. Round and round he flew, but the faster he went, the more his centrifugal force widened his circle, until he presently lost sight of his enemy altogether. Then he slowed down, determined to accomplish his end by strategy. Sneaking closely up to the wall, he moved cautiously forward, and when he had made the full circuit, he came smack up against his own tail. Making a sudden spring, which must have stretched him like a bit of India-rubber, he fastened his teeth into his ham, hanging on like a country visitor. He felt sure he had nailed the other dog, but he was equally confident the other dog had nailed him; so the problem was simplified to a mere question of endurance--and Jerusalem was an animal of pluck. The grim conflict was maintained all one day--maintained with deathless perseverance, until Dad Petto discovered the belligerent and uncoupled him. Then Jerusalem looked up at his master with a shake of the head, as much as to say: [...] "It's a precious opportune arrival for the other pup; but who took him off me?" ...|$|E

"You know," [...] he continued, loudly {{summoning}} {{a waiter}} and {{pointing to the}} table before them, [...] "you know, Julien, I have <b>always</b> <b>had</b> <b>this</b> feeling about you. I think that life has been made a trifle too easy for you. You have slipped with so little effort into the polished places. You never had to take your coat and waistcoat off and try a rough-and-tumble struggle with life. No man is the worse for it. Prosperity and smooth-traveling along the easy ways, even though they come to one as the reward of brainwork, lead to a certain flabbiness in life, lead to many moments {{when you have to}} stop and ask whether things are worth while, lead sometimes, I think, to that curious neuroticism from which clever, successful people suffer as well as the butterflies of fashion. You are up against it now, Julien, real and hard. You don't feel that you've got a day to live that you care a snap of the fingers about. You look at what you think are the pieces of your life and you imagine yourself a gaunt spectator of what has been, gazing down at them, and you've quite made up your mind that it isn't a bit of good trying to collect the fragments. Such d----d nonsense, Julien! You may have made a jolly hash of things as a Cabinet Minister, but that isn't any reason why you shouldn't make a success of life as a man. Look here, Carlo," [...] he added, addressing the waiter, [...] "the table d'hôte dinner--everything, and serve it hot. Bring us fresh butter with our spaghetti, and a flask of chianti." ...|$|E
