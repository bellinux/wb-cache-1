40|$|This {{article is}} an {{economic}} analysis of reallocating River Murray Basin water from agriculture to the environment with and {{without the possibility of}} interregional water trade. Acquiring environmental flows as an equal percentage of water <b>allocations</b> <b>from</b> all irrigation <b>regions</b> in the Basin is estimated to reduce returns to irrigation. When the same volume of water is taken <b>from</b> selected low-value <b>regions</b> only, the net revenue reduction is less. In all scenarios considered, net revenue gains from freeing trade are estimated to outweigh the negative revenue effects of reallocating water for environmental flows. The model accounts for how stochastic weather affects market water demand, supply and requirements for environmental flows. Net irrigation revenue is estimated to be $ 75 million less than the baseline level for a scenario involving reallocating a constant volume of water for the environment in both wet and dry years. For a more realistic scenario involving more water for the environment in wet and less in dry years, estimated net revenue loss is reduced by 48 per cent to $ 39 million. Finally, the external salinity-related costs of water trading are estimated at around $ 1 million per annum, a quite modest amount compared to the direct irrigation benefits of trade.

5000|$|Previously {{protected}} land in {{the northeastern}} portion of Oak Ridges along Bloomington Road, directly {{to the east of}} Yonge St. has had its protected land status removed by the Richmond Hill Town Council. The land is currently owned by Baif Developments. It got a plan of subdivision approved about 10 years ago in an Ontario Municipal Board hearing. Construction was set to begin in 2010-2011, however on this property only 25% of the lots are able to be built. The site has seen fierce opposition and has been surrounded at entry points by road barriers spray painted with phrases such as, [...] "No Subdivision". The Town of Richmond Hill has declared these barriers, [...] "Holdings Symbols", and their removal order is pending. The barriers interfere with preparations regarding the shortage of sewer <b>allocation</b> <b>from</b> the York <b>Region</b> and the developers have been waiting to build. The application to remove the [...] "Holdings Symbols" [...] {{is due to the fact}} that the sewer allocation has become partially available. Once more sewer allocation is available they will be able to proceed fully. The land in question is still in its natural state, with the exception of some removal of trees. In the 2003 Ontario provincial election the Liberal party promised to halt development on the Oak Ridges Moraine, specifically in Richmond Hill.|$|R
