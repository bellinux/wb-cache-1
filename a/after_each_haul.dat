30|$|The {{duration}} of haul was fixed at 1  hour and <b>after</b> <b>each</b> <b>haul,</b> catches from different codends were sorted and kept separately in trays {{for length and}} weight measurements. When shrimp catches were very high, a sub-sample weighing not less than 25 % of total weight was used for measurements. The length and weight of each individual was measured to the nearest millimeter and gram respectively. Catches were normalized to CPUE (kg h- 1) and used for analytical comparisons. Consistency was maintained in deployment and retrieval procedures of the gear during experimental operations to minimize operational errors.|$|E
40|$|Increase in the {{commercial}} trawling {{in the last few}} decades has made direct impact on ecosystem and also on the biodiversity. Trawling kills a large quantity of ncn-targeted species and juvenile fishes. The fisherman <b>after</b> <b>each</b> <b>haul</b> discards a large quantity of unwanted fishes and shellfishes in to the sea. The discard rate varies in relation to the target species, season and area of operation. Trawl fisheries, are characterised by high discard rates of unwanted fish, and of juvenile or undersized commercial species. There is growing evidence that intensive fishing with trawls may alter the habitat, and affect biodiversity, community structure, species composition and abundance of both target and other species within the food web. The most recent FAO estimate sets global discards at about 25 % of reported annual production from capture fisheries. The types and quantities of discards in fishing operations will depend on the species and size selectivity characteristics of the gear used in relation to the target species...|$|E
40|$|To {{evaluate}} a possible {{introduction of a}} new dredge in the fishery of Callista chione (Linnaeus, 1758), IPIMAR has conducted a study {{with the objective of}} comparing the efficiency of two dredges (traditional dredge and the new dredge design) and evaluating their impact on the benthic community. The experiments were carried out during March 1999 on the Southwest coast of Portugal, from a site off Troia. Three different tow durations of 5, 10 and 20 min were investigated. A total of 24 hauls were accomplished, 4 for each tow duration and dredge. The experiments were conducted by attaching a cover bag with a 20 mm mesh to the gear. <b>After</b> <b>each</b> <b>haul,</b> the catches in the bag and in the cover were sorted separately. All individuals retained were attributed scores on a scale of 1 – 4 in which 1 equates to good and 4 equates to dead. The results obtained showed that catches from the traditional dredge (TD) are composed of a great fraction of juveniles of C. chione, while in the new dredge (NDD) catches are composed, almost entirely, by individuals with a superior size to the minimum legal length (50 mm). This result indicates that the mesh of the bag of the TD used in the exploitation of this resource is not adequate. For the 3 different tow durations, the mean fishing yield obtained for the NDD was always superior to the TD, due to its greater efficiency in capture. The proportion of by-catch is significantly higher when the TD is used. For all 3 tow duration, the TD caused mortalities on the target species and on the macrobenthic community in the same order of magnitude as the NDD. Since the fishery of C. chione is managed by daily quotas per boat, when using the NDD the impact on the macrobenthic community is reduced by about 50 % due to its greater efficiency of capture. Another advantage in the usage of the NDD relatively to the TD, is to allow the smallest individuals (independently of the species) to escape rapidly through the metallic bars on the grid, increasing their probability of survival...|$|E

40|$|Planning {{techniques}} for large scale earthworks {{have been considered}} in this article. To improve these activities a “block theoretic” approach was developed that provides an integrated solution consisting of an allocation of cuts to fills and a sequence of cuts and fills over time. It considers the constantly changing terrain by computing haulage routes dynamically. Consequently more realistic haulage costs {{are used in the}} decision making process. A digraph is utilised to describe the terrain surface which has been partitioned into uniform grids. It reflects the true state of the terrain, and is altered <b>after</b> <b>each</b> cut and fill. A shortest path algorithm is successively applied to calculate the cost of <b>each</b> <b>haul,</b> and these costs are summed over the entire sequence, to provide a total cost of haulage. To solve this integrated optimisation problem a variety of solution techniques were applied, including constructive algorithms, meta-heuristics and parallel programming.

40|$|A graph theoretic {{approach}} is developed for accurately computing haulage costs in earthwork projects. This is vital as haulage is a predominant factor in the real cost of earthworks. A variety of metrics {{can be used in}} our approach, but a fuel consumption proxy is recommended.

The approach is also capable of efficiently correcting the violation of top down cutting and bottom up filling conditions that can be found in existing earthwork assignments and sequences. This approach assumes that the project site is partitioned into uniform blocks. A directed graph is then utilised to describe the terrain surface. This digraph is altered <b>after</b> <b>each</b> cut and fill, in order to reflect the true state of the terrain.

40|$|There is some {{evidence}} that the presence of Tursiops truncatus in fishing areas represents a real economic threat to fishermen due the dolphin feeding on the entangled fish, damaging the nets and reducing the fish catch. We have carried out experiments to assess the efficiency of a pinger in decreasing the interaction between the dolphins and fishing nets, in a fishing area off the coast of southern Italy, where Tursiops truncatus is frequently observed to interact with bottom gill nets. Two identical monofilament bottom gill nets (900 m long), one equipped with pingers and the other without, were used to measure the effect of these pingers on the abundance of the catch and net damage. For <b>each</b> <b>haul</b> (58 in total), data on dolphin sightings near the nets, damage judged to have been done by dolphins, weight and species composition of the catch were collected.

40|$|The {{distribution}} {{patterns of}} bottom trawl faunal assemblages in Porcupine bank is addressed {{using data from}} two bottom trawl surveys performed in the area. Hierarchical cluster analyses and canonical ordination analyses are applied respectively to define the different assemblages and to evaluate the main structuring environmental factors using information on depth, latitude, longitude, bottom temperature and salinity. Analyses are performed with two different matrices one in numbers of individuals per species in <b>each</b> <b>haul</b> and another in biomass of main commercial species in <b>each</b> <b>haul.</b> Three large assemblages are discriminated by hierarchical cluster analyses: shelf, outer-shelf and shelf-break, with some subgroups within each of them consistent in the results of both data matrices.

Longitude has also an important effect on the bottom trawl assemblages distribution pattern, this effect {{is more likely to}} be related with relief structure and ground types differences in both sides of Porcupine bank.
