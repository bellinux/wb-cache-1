5|$|In the {{indirect}} or French process, metallic zinc is melted in a graphite crucible and vaporized at temperatures above 907°C (typically around 1000°C). Zinc vapor reacts with the {{oxygen in the}} air to give ZnO, accompanied by a drop in its temperature and bright luminescence. Zinc oxide particles are transported into a cooling duct and collected in a bag house. This indirect method was popularized by LeClaire (France) in 1844 and therefore is commonly known as the French process. Its product normally consists of <b>agglomerated</b> zinc oxide particles with an average size of 0.1 to a few micrometers. By weight, most of the world's zinc oxide is manufactured via French process.|$|E

When suitable land in nearby Oldham (then the largest and most productive mill town in the world) had become scarce in the 1860s, there was a mill building boom in Shaw and Crompton, giving rise to the area as major mill town. The local townscape became dominated by distinctive rectangular brick-built mills, and its former villages and hamlets <b>agglomerated</b> as a single town around these factories. Shaw and Crompton railway station and a goods yard was opened in 1863, allowing improved transportation of textile goods and raw materials to and from the township. Neighbouring Royton had begun to encroach upon the township's southern boundary, forming a continuous urban cotton-spinning district with Oldham, Lees and Chadderton—the Oldham parliamentary constituency—which was responsible for 13% of the world's cotton production.|$|E

40|$|Nanoparticles form {{multi-stage}} <b>agglomerates</b> {{when they}} are fluidized: simple <b>agglomerates</b> (a few dozens of micrometres), and complex <b>agglomerates</b> (a few hundreds of micrometres). This paper studies nanoparticle fluidization by using adhesive CFD-DEM (Discrete Element Model) simulation, which includes an adhesive contact model having the ability to model the contact and bounce/stick between elastic-plastic and cohesive particles. The discrete elements represent the simple <b>agglomerates</b> of nanoparticles. The effects of particle density, fluidizing gas velocity, and van der Waals force on gas-solid flow and <b>agglomerate</b> behaviors are investigated. It is shown that the particles, representing simple <b>agglomerates,</b> form large <b>agglomerates</b> during fluidized process. As the <b>agglomerates</b> move around in the bed, they continuously break and recombine. The solid movement is evaluated by a dispersion coefficient and it decreases with increase in cohesion. By monitoring the evolution of contacts, the <b>agglomerate</b> breakage is visualized and compared for the different conditions. Increasing fluidizing gas velocity and reducing particle adhesion both increase <b>agglomerate</b> breakage rate. The structure parameters of <b>agglomerates</b> are further analyzed: averaged coordination number of <b>agglomerates</b> around 3. 0, packing fraction around 0. 2 – 0. 3, and fractal dimension around 1. 9 – 2. 3, {{which can be used}} to indicate structures and formation mechanisms of <b>agglomerates...</b>|$|R

40|$|Wet {{agglomeration}} processes have predominantly {{been investigated}} by changing operation variables of process-scale experiments. So far, most fundamental work {{concentrated on the}} strength of the liquid bonds in the <b>agglomerate</b> and its relation to the process. Previous studies on the relationship between droplet size and <b>agglomerate</b> size in fluid bed agglomeration indicated that, besides <b>agglomerate</b> strength, liquid distribution determines the <b>agglomerate</b> properties to a large extent. This paper focuses on the mechanism of growth of a single <b>agglomerate</b> originating from one droplet of binder liquid. A model is introduced which describes <b>agglomerate</b> growth as a function of time. We discern two stages of growth of an <b>agglomerate.</b> Initially, fast growth takes I,lace by wetting of the powder particles by a droplet, which result in the formation of an initial <b>agglomerate.</b> This stage of fast growth is followed by a second stage of slower growth, which results from drainage of binder liquid from the initial <b>agglomerate</b> to the outer layers of the growing <b>agglomerate.</b> This model predicts <b>agglomerate</b> growth and the final <b>agglomerate</b> size by taking into account the particle sie distribution, the viscosity, the surface tension, the contact angle, the porosity, the wetting saturation and the residual saturation. Experimental results were in good agreement with the model. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science S. A. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Background: Wet {{agglomeration}} is {{a method}} wherein the crystals of dispersion are held together in aggregates by small amount of a liquid acting as an intercrystal binder. In present study, in order to study the possible modification of <b>agglomerate</b> structure, low concentrations of additives (0. 1 - 1 %) were added to binder liquid. Methods: Piroxicam <b>agglomerates</b> were produced by wet agglomeration method by three solvent systems including a good solvent (dimethylformamide or acetone), antisolvent (water) and a binder liquid (ethylacetate or isopropylacetate). Span 80, talc, ethylcellulose and Eudragit RS in different concentrations were used as additives. The <b>agglomerates</b> were evaluated for production yield of <b>agglomerates,</b> size, friability and drug release properties. Results: The results showed that formation of <b>agglomerates</b> was possible in presence of span and talc. However, no <b>agglomerates</b> could be obtained with polymers tested (ethylcellulose and Eudragit RS). Talc increased <b>agglomerate</b> size, whereas the obtained <b>agglomerates</b> were more susceptible to breakup. However, using span as opposed to talc resulted in <b>agglomerates</b> with higher strength but smaller particle size. The dissolution tests showed that both additives adversely affected the dissolution rate of piroxicam from the <b>agglomerates.</b> Conclusion: Result of this study suggested that additives even in small amounts {{played a major role}} in <b>agglomerate</b> properties...|$|R

A racetrack channel was devised to provide data for the validation of numerical models, which are intended to model the transport of fibre <b>agglomerates.</b> The racetrack channel provides near uniform and steady conditions that lead to either the sedimentation or suspension of the <b>agglomerates.</b> Various experimental techniques {{were used to determine}} the velocity conditions and the distribution of the fibre <b>agglomerates</b> in the channel.

25|$|There {{has also}} been some {{secondary}} migration of Somalis to the UK from the Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark. According to refugee expert Jill Rutter, in some locations, secondary migrants make {{up the majority of}} the Somali community. An academic article published in 2011 suggests that, since 2000, between 10,000 and 20,000 Somalis in the Netherlands have moved to the UK. The driving forces behind this secondary migration included: a desire to reunite with family and friends; a rise in Dutch opposition to Muslim immigration; Somali opposition to housing policies which forced them to live scattered in small groups all over various cities rather than in a larger <b>agglomerated</b> community; a restrictive socio-economic environment which, among other things, made it difficult for new arrivals to find work; and the comparative ease of starting a business and acquiring the means to get off social welfare in the UK. Research into this relocation also suggests that some Somali migrants in the Netherlands did not intend to end up there as a final destination. Their journeys may have been interrupted in the Netherlands, or they may have had little choice about their destination. As a result, some secondary migration {{can be seen in the}} context of the desire to complete an intended migration to the UK.|$|E
500|$|New {{markets in}} Europe and South America {{increased}} {{the demand for}} Britain's cheap cotton goods. Supplies of raw cotton were exported from plantations in the United States to Manchester. From the markets in Manchester, mill owners from Chadderton and neighbouring towns bought their cotton to be processed into yarn and cloth. Supplies were cut during the Lancashire Cotton Famine of 1861–65 {{as a result of}} the American Civil War, leading to the formation of the Chadderton Local Board of Health in 1873, whose purpose was to ensure social security and maintain hygiene and sanitation in the locality following the crisis. Despite a brief economic depression, the urban growth of Chadderton accelerated after the famine. The profitability of factory based cotton spinning meant that much of Chadderton's plentiful cheap open land, used for farming since antiquity, vanished under distinctive rectangular multi-storey brick-built factories—35 by 1891. Chadderton's former villages and hamlets <b>agglomerated</b> as a mill town around these factories and a network of newly created roads, canals and railways. The Chadderton landscape was [...] "dominated by mill chimneys, many with the mill name picked out in white brick". Neighbouring Oldham (which by the 1870s had emerged as the largest and most productive mill town in the world) encroached upon Chadderton's eastern boundary, urbanising the town and surrounds, and forming a continuous urban cotton-spinning district with Royton, Lees and Shaw and Crompton—the Oldham parliamentary constituency—which at its peak was responsible for 13percent of the world's cotton production. These Victorian era developments shifted the commercial focus away from Chadderton Fold to the major arterial Middleton Road, by Chadderton's eastern boundary with Oldham. Sixty cotton mills were constructed in Chadderton between 1778 and 1926, and 6,000 people, a quarter of Chadderton's population, worked in these factories by the beginning of the 20th century. Industries ancillary to cotton spinning, such as engineering, coal mining, bleaching and dyeing became established during this period, meaning the rest of Chadderton's population were otherwise involved in the sector. Philip Stott was a Chadderton-born architect, civil engineer and surveyor of cotton mills. Stott's mills in Chadderton were some of the largest to be built in the United Kingdom, multiplying the town's industrial capacity and in turn increasing its population and productivity.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBy {{accounting}} for realistic interparticle interaction energy of fine dry nanoparticles, an off-lattice Monte Carlo (MC) simulation approach {{is used to}} gain insight into such properties of <b>agglomerates</b> of nanoparticles with primary sizes ranging from 10 nm to 100 nm. This novel numerical approach allows for assessment of the mechanical properties and morphological features of the <b>agglomerates.</b> An interesting outcome is that the fractal dimension depends on the material properties represented via interaction energy. The <b>agglomerate</b> porosity increases with increasing <b>agglomerate</b> mass and may approach unity. With increasing Hamaker constant and fixed particle size, the <b>agglomerates</b> are characterized by a lower fractal dimension, higher packing porosity, higher mechanical strength, larger agglomeration size, and lower crystalline fraction. For a fixed Hamaker constant, <b>agglomerates</b> of the smaller primary particles exhibit a more compact packing structure, higher mechanical strength, smaller <b>agglomerate</b> size, and higher crystalline fraction. The local structure analysis indicates that for a fixed Hamaker constant, there are more particles in crystalline structure within the <b>agglomerates</b> constituted by the smaller primary particles. Likewise, for a fixed primary particle size, a lower Hamaker constant allows particles to configure into more stable <b>agglomerate</b> structures, thus providing useful insights into <b>agglomerate</b> morphology...|$|R

They became associated in the mind, according to their general and obvious resemblances; and the aggregates thus formed, having to be frequently spoken of as aggregates, came to be denoted by a common name. Any body of truths which had thus acquired a collective denomination, was called a science. It was long before this fortuitous classification was felt not to be sufficiently precise. It was in a more advanced stage of the progress of knowledge that mankind became sensible of the advantage of ascertaining whether the facts which they had thus grouped together were distinguished from all other facts by any common properties, and what these were. The first attempts to answer this question were commonly very unskilful, and the consequent definitions extremely imperfect.|$|E
60|$|On Monday we took an open {{carriage}} {{and drove to}} Rhyddlan; whence we sent back the carriage, meaning to walk home along the embankment of the river Clwyd, after inspecting the castle. The fortress is very ruinous, having been dismantled by the Parliamentarians. There are great gaps,--two, at least, in the walls that connect the round towers, of which there were six, {{one on each side}} of a gateway in front, and the same at a gateway towards the river, where there is a steep descent to a wall and square tower, at the water-side. Great pains {{and a great deal of}} gunpowder must have been used in converting this castle into a ruin. There were one or two fragments lying where they had fallen more than two hundred years ago, which, though merely a conglomeration of small stones and mortar, were just as hard as if they had been solid masses of granite. The substantial thickness of the walls is composed of these <b>agglomerated</b> small stones and mortar, the casing being hewn blocks of red freestone. This is much worn away by the weather, wherever it has been exposed to the air; but, under shelter, it looks as if it might have been hewn only a year or two ago. Each of the round towers had formerly a small staircase turret rising beside and ascending above it, in which a warder might be posted, but they have all been so battered and shattered that it is impossible for an uninstructed observer to make out a satisfactory plan of then. The interior of each tower was a small room, not more than twelve or fifteen feet across; and of these there seem to have been three stories, with loop-holes for archery and not much other light than what came through them. Then there are various passages and nooks and corners and square recesses in the stone, some of which must have been intended for dungeons, and the ugliest and gloomiest dungeons imaginable, for they could not have had any light or air. There is not, the least, splinter of wood-work remaining in any part of the castle,--nothing but bare stone, and a little plaster in one or two places, on the wall. In the front gateway we looked at the groove on each side, in which the portcullis used to rise and fall; and in each of the contiguous round towers there was a loop-hole, whence an enemy on the outer side of the portcullis might be shot through with an arrow.|$|E
40|$|A multi-scale {{modelling}} {{framework is}} {{developed for the}} PEFC cathode electrode. Unlike the conventional <b>agglomerate</b> model, {{the effects of the}} microstructure of the <b>agglomerate</b> are numerically coupled to the fuel cell-scale model in this framework. This is performed through solving the agglomerate-scale model first and subsequently extracting and using the data required to generate the performance curves in the fuel cell-scale model. This enables one to freely investigate the structure of the <b>agglomerate</b> without being limited to the only three <b>agglomerate</b> shapes that can be investigated using the conventional <b>agglomerate</b> model: spheres, long cylinders with sealed ends and long slabs with sealed ends. The numerical studies conducted in this work using the developed framework have revealed that the performance of the cathode electrode is highly sensitive to the specific surface area of the <b>agglomerate</b> if the size of the latter is relatively large, i. e. of the order of 1000 nm. Namely, the maximum reported current density has increased by about 60 % when changing from the ‘large’ spherical <b>agglomerate</b> to the ‘large’ cylindrical <b>agglomerate.</b> Also, {{it has been shown that}} a slight change in the structure of the <b>agglomerate</b> may significantly improve the fuel cell performance...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{identify}} the basic mechanisms of <b>agglomerate</b> breakage during powder blending. Presence of drug <b>agglomerates</b> in a blend poses a potential safety risk in e. g. pharmaceutical applications. Therefore, <b>agglomerates</b> {{need to be}} removed. DESIGN AND METHODS This study assessed the critical process parameters and rules that must be observed when scaling up a mixing process. RESULTS Experiments using so-called brittle calibrated test particles provided evidence that <b>agglomerates</b> reduce in size via an abrasion mechanism. The abrasion rate is not only influenced by the (mechanical) properties of <b>agglomerates</b> and process conditions, {{but also by the}} particle size distribution of the filler. A novel method to measure powder velocities enabled the development of a quantitative model that describes the relationships between powder motion during blending and <b>agglomerate</b> abrasion. A Stokes number (Stabr) defined as the ratio between the kinetic energy density of the bed and the work of fracture of <b>agglomerates</b> predicts the rate of <b>agglomerate</b> abrasion very well. CONCLUSION Particle velocity critically affects <b>agglomerate</b> abrasion and mixing time. Therefore mixing of a powder blend containing a cohesive material should be approached as a particle size reduction problem rather than a distribution issu...|$|R
40|$|Chemical, {{pharmaceutical}} {{and food}} industries amongst many others use <b>agglomerates</b> either as intermediate or manufactured products. The mechanical strength of <b>agglomerates</b> under impact or shear deformation during handling and processing {{is of great}} interest to these industries for optimising product specification and functionality. The effect of surface energy on <b>agglomerate</b> behaviour under impact has been investigated using Distinct Element Method (DEM). Four different <b>agglomerates</b> were formed and impacted against a target along the direction of gravity for three different values of the surface energy (0. 35, 3. 5 and 35. 0 J/m²). The <b>agglomerate</b> breakage pattern was influenced by the surface energy and a transition in the mode of failure of <b>agglomerates</b> was observed when the surface energy was varied. Based on the previous work, the surface energy is expressed in terms of Weber Number, We=(V-V 0 ²) ρD/γ. <b>Agglomerates</b> showed extensive deformation under impact at the lowest value of surface energy (0. 35 J/m²) and no evidence of fragmentation was found for any value of impact velocity. In this case the <b>agglomerates</b> behaved macroscopically in a ductile mode. At values of surface energy larger than 3. 5 J/m² the <b>agglomerates</b> fragmented {{at the same time as}} local damage around the impact site occurred. This type of behaviour is typical of semi-brittle material failure. Therefore, the breakage pattern of <b>agglomerates</b> is influenced by the surface energy...|$|R
