In fact, there are irregular arrangements that are denser than the cubic close packing arrangement over a small enough volume, but any attempt to extend these arrangements to fill a larger volume always reduces their density.|$|E

25|$|Siegel and Shuster {{also argued}} that the March 1938 {{contract}} lacked mutuality, saying {{that at the time}} Superman was an idea not fully developed and thus there was no clear concept on what was being sold. Judge Young disagreed, and concluded that the strips that appeared in Action Comics #1 were based on a fully developed concept that Siegel and Shuster submitted before March 1938, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> National had purchased in the contract.|$|E
25|$|Chivalry was {{dynamic and}} it {{transformed}} and adjusted {{in response to}} local situation <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> probably led to its demise. There were many chivalric groups in England as imagined by Sir Thomas Malory when he wrote Le Morte Darthur in the late 15th century, perhaps each group created each chivalric ideology. And Malory's perspective reflects the condition of 15th-century chivalry. When Le Morte Darthur was printed, William Caxton urged knights to read the romance with an expectation that reading about chivalry could unite a community of knights already divided by the Wars of the Roses.|$|E

Ironically (given Kant's intentions), the same tendency has worked itself out with a vengeance with regards to all judgments of value, including moral judgments.|$|E

Bourget, at that time a close friend of Huysmans as of Wilde, admired it greatly; Paul Valéry called it his 'Bible and his bedside book' <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> it became for Wilde.

25|$|Finding a modular {{multiplicative inverse}} has many {{applications}} in algorithms {{that rely on}} the theory of modular arithmetic. For instance, in cryptography the use of modular arithmetic permits some operations {{to be carried out}} more quickly and with less storage requirements, while other operations become more difficult. Both of these features can be used to advantage. In particular, in the RSA algorithm, encrypting and decrypting a message is done using a pair of numbers that are multiplicative inverses with respect to a carefully selected modulus. One of these numbers is made public and {{can be used in a}} rapid encryption procedure, while the other, used in the decryption procedure, is kept hidden. Determining the hidden number from the public number is considered to be computationally infeasible <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> makes the system work to ensure privacy.|$|E
25|$|In general The Mysterious Affair at Styles is a {{considerable}} achievement for a first-off author. The country-house-party murder is a stereotype in the detective-story genre, which Christie makes no great use of. Not her sort of occasion, at least later in life, and perhaps not really her class. The family party is much more in her line, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> we have here. This {{is one of the}} few Christies anchored in time and space: we are in Essex, during the First World War. The family is kept together under one roof by the exigencies of war and of a matriarch demanding rather than tyrannical – not one of her later splendid monsters, but a sympathetic and lightly shaded characterisation. If the lifestyle of the family still seems to us lavish, even wasteful, nevertheless we have the half sense that we are witnessing the beginning of the end of the Edwardian summer, that the era of country-house living has entered its final phase. Christie takes advantage of this end-of-an-era feeling in several ways: while she uses the full range of servants and their testimony, a sense of decline, of break-up is evident; feudal attitudes exist, but they crack easily. The marriage of the matriarch with a mysterious nobody is the central out-of-joint event in an intricate web of subtle changes. The family is lightly but effectively characterised, and on the outskirts of the story are the villagers, the small businessmen, and the surrounding farmers – the nucleus of Mayhem Parva. It is, too, a very clever story, with clues and red herrings falling thick and fast. We are entering the age when plans of the house were an indispensable aid to the aspirant solver of detective stories, and when cleverness was more important than suspense. But here we come to a problem that Agatha Christie has not yet solved, for cleverness over the long length easily becomes exhausting, and too many clues tend to cancel each other out, as far as reader interest is concerned. These were problems which Conan Doyle never satisfactorily overcame, but which Christie would.".|$|E

They had continued to trade after a crisis meeting, which should have made clear there was no reasonable prospect of coming out of insolvency. The liquidators also alleged misfeasance (section 212) through years of disorganised financial and accounting records <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> {{made it difficult to}} tell whether the company was insolvent.

500|$|The main {{theme of}} obZen is [...] "human evil", {{according}} to Haake. The title is {{a play on}} the words [...] "obscene" [...] and [...] "Zen"; in addition, [...] "ob" [...] means [...] "anti" [...] in Latin.

Revolver Magazine finds the lyrics of the title track from obZen representative of the entire album: [...] "Salvation found in vomit and blood/Where depravation, lies, corruption/War and pain is god." [...] However, Haake claims, [...] "We don't dwell on hate and bad feelings as people. But with these songs, I think {{we really wanted to}} paint a picture lyrically that might be seen as a cautionary tale. We're going, 'Heads up.
