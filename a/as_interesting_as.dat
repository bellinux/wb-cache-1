25|$|Servants' {{quarters}} {{are those}} parts of a building, traditionally in a private house, which contain the domestic offices and staff accommodation. From the late 17th century until the early 20th century, they were a common feature in many large houses. Sometimes they {{are an integral part}} of a smaller house—in the basements and attics, especially in a town house, while in larger houses they are often a purpose-built adjacent wing or block. In architectural descriptions and guidebooks of stately homes, the servants' quarters are frequently overlooked, yet they form an important piece of social history, often <b>as</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>as</b> the principal part of the house itself.|$|E

25|$|Yahya's {{poetry is}} {{described}} by E.J.W.Gibb to be <b>as</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>as</b> his life was. Gibb praised Dukagjini {{as the one who}} won a position of real eminence, out of all non-Turks, Asiatics, and well as Europeans, who have essayed to write Turkish poetry. According to Gibb, there is nothing in Dukagjini's language to spot him as a non-Constantinopolitan by birth and education. Gibb added that there is sustained simplicity, vigor, and originality in Dukagjini's writings. According to Gibb, the originality shows for instance in his poem Yusuf ve Züleyha. The subject of the poem is borrowed from Persian literature, which was so popular during that time, that it was considered a universal theme, nevertheless, he rejects being a translator or paraphraser, but tells the story on a manner of his own.|$|E
25|$|Suda was {{disappointed}} {{with the quality of}} Travis' wrestling techniques, and performed some of them on the animators to demonstrate. Certain other details of Travis are based on Suda, including the sound of a key ring jingling in his pocket and his love of cats. A Ubisoft contest was held to allow one winner's design to be used in Desperate Struggle for one of Travis' T-shirts. In an interview with Nintendo Power, Suda stated that he wanted Travis to become a huge star, stating that {{this was one of the}} reasons he wanted to make Desperate Struggle <b>as</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>as</b> possible. Nintendo Power editors told Joystiq that Suda considers Travis his favorite character. Suda states that No More Heroes 2 will be Travis' last appearance in the series, as his story will be completely finished. The Californian setting of No More Heroes is partially based on Travis, who Suda stated had a variety of frustrations and emotions that helped him fit in with that setting.|$|E

5000|$|Hill commented in 1986:I still recall {{with delight}} {{as a teen-ager}} making the earth-shaking {{discovery}} {{that many of the}} great [...] "serious novelists," [...] classical and modern, were <b>as</b> entertaining and <b>interesting</b> <b>as</b> the crime-writers I already loved. But it took another decade of maturation to reverse the equation and understand that many of the crime writers I had decided to grow out of were still <b>as</b> <b>interesting</b> and entertaining <b>as</b> the [...] "serious novelists" [...] I now revered.|$|R

Greenwald from AllMusic liked the singer's cover and {{wrote of the}} song's hook, [...] "Streisand's performance– particularly her phrasing of this line– is unforgettable". Stephen Holden from Rolling Stone compared her rendition to Wonder's version and wrote that it was [...] "almost <b>as</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>as</b> the original".|$|E

Taubman {{wanted to}} make Elvis [...] "as colourful, as edgy and <b>as</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>as</b> possible", {{with one of his}} {{suggestions}} being the bowl cut. Amalric and Taubman improvised a backstory for Elvis: he is Dominic's cousin and once lived on the streets before being inducted into Quantum. He called Elvis [...] "a bit of a goofball. He thinks he's all that but he's not really.... He's not a comic guy. He definitely takes himself very serious, but maybe by his taking himself too serious he may become friendly." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{a list of}} Lost episodes, the Los Angeles Times ranked [...] "A Tale of Two Cities" [...] number 66 out of 113 episodes, {{explaining}} it was [...] "Not bad. The introduction of Juliet is a killer, and Jack raging against the Others is fun. But many of the big revelations -- Ben's name, for example -- aren't very well handled." [...] On a similar list, IGN ranked the episode at number 38; they called the opening [...] "one of the show's characteristic fake-outs", and Jack's flashbacks [...] "not nearly <b>as</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>as</b> his first encounters with Juliet".|$|E

500|$|Norman Howe {{reviewed}} Adventure in The Space Gamer No. 31. Howe {{commented that}} [...] "Adventure {{is a good}} game, as video games are measured.

500|$|... "When Flanders Failed" [...] is {{the third}} episode of The Simpsons third season. It {{originally}} aired on the Fox network in the United States on October 3, 1991. In the episode, Homer makes a wish for Ned Flanders's new left-handed store {{to go out of}} business. The wish comes true and gets the Flanders family into financial troubles. Ned is forced to sell his possessions, and Homer gleefully buys many of his things. When finding out that Ned's house is to be repossessed, Homer feels guilty and decides to get the store back in business by telling all the left-handed citizens about it. Meanwhile, Bart takes karate lessons but quits after discovering that it is not <b>as</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>as</b> he had expected it to be.|$|E
500|$|The two-part finale [...] "All Hell Breaks Loose" [...] brought many storylines to a close. The psychic {{children}} were killed off because the writers felt the characters were not <b>as</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>as</b> demons and monsters. The Roadhouse was destroyed due to Kripke's disliking of the concept; {{he felt it}} gave a home to the road show. Fearing that he would disappoint fans by creating too much anticipation, Kripke also decided to answer many questions regarding Azazel's plans in [...] "Part One". The second part ended the brothers' quest to kill Azazel, but also opened more storylines for the third season, such as Dean's demonic pact to resurrect Sam {{and the question of}} whether what returned was [...] "one hundred percent pure Sam". Additionally, the [...] "war of demons against humanity"—hinted at throughout the first two seasons—finally started at the finale's end.|$|E
500|$|Cyril Connolly, {{reviewing}} You Only Live Twice in The Sunday Times {{wrote that}} Fleming's latest book was [...] "reactionary, sentimental, square, the Bond-image flails {{its way through}} the middle-brow masses, a relaxation to the great, a stimulus to the humble, the only common denominator between Kennedy and Oswald". The critic for The Times was largely unimpressed with You Only Live Twice, complaining that [...] "as a moderate to middling travelogue what follows will just about do... the plot with its concomitant sadism does not really get going until more than half way through". In contrast to the previous novels, The Times continued, [...] "though Mr. Fleming's macabre imagination is <b>as</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>as</b> ever, some of the old snap seems to have gone". Dealing with the cliffhanger ending to the story, the reviewer wrote that [...] "Mr. Fleming would keep us on tenterhooks, but at this rate of going even his most devoted admirers will free themselves before very long." ...|$|E

50|$|Though not <b>as</b> {{historically}} <b>interesting</b> <b>as</b> its predecessor, the Pawling location accommodated {{more people}} and offered expanded dining facilities. Decorated {{inside and out}} with a Southwestern motif, the club sported a stage set into a corner of an open, tiered room furnished with tables and chairs. The enclosed bar adjacent to this area was decorated with photos of the many artists who performed at the Towne Crier.|$|R
60|$|But {{it was a}} jolly, busy, happy swift-flying winter. Schoolwork was <b>as</b> <b>interesting,</b> class rivalry <b>as</b> absorbing, as of yore.

500|$|Critics {{applauded the}} growing {{relationship}} between Andrea and Shane, {{as well as}} Dale's confrontation with Shane. Despite describing them as an [...] "unlikely pairing", Meslow asserted that it was superior to the storyline between Andrea and Dale. [...] "There's {{something to be said}} for the occasional post-apocalyptic tryst, which allows two characters who've experienced almost nothing but misery to have, even for a moment, something that resembles joy," [...] he articulated. Meslow retorted that it was wise to underplay the tryst between Shane and Andrea, which he predicted would not lead to anything serious. Venable wrote: [...] " [...] Dale’s lack of personality traits, beyond being the wise sage who gets in everyone’s business, makes him an unpredictable foe in my book, and could be <b>as</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>as</b> Shane’s violent selfishness." [...] Morgan Jeffrey of Digital Spy avouched that Shane continued to be an interesting character; [...] "Just as we were beginning to like him again, he murdered Otis in cold blood. And it seems like his downward spiral is set to continue—he's threatening poor Dale and embarking on an ill-advised affair with Andrea." ...|$|E
500|$|Bancroft {{felt that}} the central {{character}} of Danny is not <b>as</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>as</b> those that surround him. He is often a passive observer rather than a participant; many of the important events happen [...] "offstage", only to be recalled later by Danny, resulting in a [...] "leaching of emotion and immediacy". Bancroft complained that [...] "digressions multiply and go nowhere", and that even the restaurant menus, though interesting, are historically dubious". Kakutani was also critical of the novel, saying that with some [...] "diligent editing" [...] it could have equaled some of Irving's more powerful works, in particular The World According to Garp (1978) and A Widow for One Year (1998). She said while it was at times a [...] "deeply felt and often moving story", it was tarnished by a [...] "gimmicky plot; cartoony characters; absurd contrivances; cheesy sentimentality; and a thoroughly preposterous ending". She complained about the same [...] "odd little leitmotifs" [...] that appear in many of Irving's works, and the inflated plot with its [...] "gothic tinsel" [...] and [...] "pointless digressions". She called it an [...] "entertaining" [...] but [...] "messy and long-winded, commentary on the fiction-making process itself".|$|E
500|$|Reviews from {{critics were}} mostly strong, with many {{saying that the}} {{extended}} length of gameplay and the new features were valued additions that kept the sequels <b>as</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>as</b> the original games. Craig Harris of IGN gave the games a [...] "masterful" [...] 10 out of 10 rating, stating that: [...] "As awesome as the original Pokémon edition was, Pokémon Gold and Silver blow it away in gameplay elements, features, and goodies. There are so many little additions to the design it's impossible to list them all". There was particular praise given to the innovative internal clock feature, with Frank Povo of GameSpot, noting: [...] "The first major addition to Pokémon GS {{is the presence of}} a time element... Although it may sound like a gimmick, the addition of a clock adds quite a bit of variety to the game". Povo went on to give the games a [...] "great" [...] 8.8 rating. Nintendo Power listed the Gold and Silver versions of it combined as the sixth best Game Boy/Game Boy Color video game, praising it for its new Pokémon, features, and full-color graphics.|$|E
50|$|Created in 1688, as {{a result}} of the Portuguese {{deciding}} to levy a tax for everything entering and leaving Amazonia. Despite resembling a large retailer, the mixture of colours, fragrances and objects is very <b>interesting</b> <b>as</b> well as folkloric.|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{efficient}} new {{method of obtaining}} a generator matrix G from certain types of parity check matrices with a defective cyclic block structure. This novel approach describes parity check and generator matrices in terms of polynomials. Moreover, by using this polynomial algebra we have found efficient ways to implement the scheme. In addition, this method is <b>as</b> such <b>interesting</b> <b>as</b> {{it allows us to}} convert H into G without a systematic encoder in between (i. e., there is no diagonal subpart in the output). This alone is <b>interesting</b> <b>as</b> normally G would be dense if we were to form it from the given H by Gaussian elimination. ...|$|R

500|$|However, some game editors {{have criticized}} Sephiroth's character. For example, IGN's Smith {{has stated that}} [...] "Sephiroth was {{certainly}} a good-looking fellow, but his motivations were about as clear as mud." [...] When comparing Sephiroth with the Final Fantasy VI villain, Kefka Palazzo, GamesRadar commented that he [...] "seems <b>as</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>as</b> a dead accountant painted brown." [...] 1UP.com took a humorous approach to Sephiroth's several appearances after apparent deaths and in other games, ranking him third in their [...] "They Is Risen" [...] feature, which covered the ten most notorious video game resurrections. The publication noted that if the character continued to be used, Square Enix would eventually [...] "run out of ways to remix One-Winged Angel." [...] GameSpy editor Ryan Scott called Sephiroth the [...] "King of Overrated Characters" [...] during GameSpy's villain feature for Dissidia Final Fantasy, arguing that gamers were impressed by him only because of his design and by how he killed Aerith during Final Fantasy VII. On the other hand, AnimeFringe called him [...] "the most notorious villain in the entire Final Fantasy series" [...] and [...] "quintessential bishōnen {{in the eyes of}} many fans -- male and female," [...] comparing him with Kefka and praising his complexity.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Stay (Faraway, So Close!)" [...] was {{directed}} by Wim Wenders, produced by Debbie Mason, and edited by Jerry Chater. The video was filmed in Berlin {{over the course of}} three days, primarily in black-and-white but with some sequences in colour. It contains cameos of some of the actors who appeared in Faraway, So Close!, including Otto Sander, as well as Wenders' nephew. Several scenes are taken directly from Faraway, So Close! and Wenders' 1987 film Wings of Desire, which also served as the principal inspiration for the video's premise. Wenders noted that [...] "making a video is really a very different ballgame. You have the script, so to speak, because you have the song, and everything you do is in order to help the song shine... You want to make that song look as good as possible and sound as good as possible and <b>as</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>as</b> possible." [...] Several shots depict the band members standing on the statue of Victoria, a monument {{at the top of the}} Berlin Victory Column; a model of the angel was created for those scenes. Leftover military equipment from the Cold War, including the Soviet MiG, were included in the background.|$|E
500|$|Nintendo Power named Kefka {{the best}} villain {{to appear on}} Nintendo {{consoles}} in 1994, ranking higher than Donkey Kong Countrys King K. Rool and Marvel Comics' Carnage. They again featured him in their January 2010 issue, ranking him as their third favorite Nintendo villain. He also was ranked 3rd place in the [...] "Our Favorite Villains," [...] section of their [...] "250 Reasons to Love Nintendo," [...] article. He was described as [...] "An insane, remorseless clown with godlike powers who wants to destroy everyone and everything (and comes frighteningly close to achieving his goal), Kefka is downright evil." [...] UGO.com named him third in their [...] "Top 25 Japanese RPG Characters" [...] article, stating [...] "Insane, nihilistic, and cruel, Kefka isn't a reserved mystery like other Final Fantasy villains – rather, he's in-your-face at all times, doing dirty deeds just to say he did them." [...] Digital Spy states that he caused {{some of the most}} surprising moments in the Final Fantasy series when he destroyed the world. IGN ranked him sixth on their list of the [...] "Top 25" [...] Final Fantasy characters of all time, noting that several factors, such as his dialogue and appearance, contributed to his memorability as a character; in a [...] "Reader's Choice" [...] edition of the article he placed eighth, with similar comments. He was also ranked 18th in IGN's [...] "Top 100 Videogame Villains" [...] list. GamePro ranked him 33rd on the top 47 most diabolical video game villains of all time, citing both his [...] "genocide" [...] and his enslavement of Terra. GamesRadar ranked him the most [...] "outrageous camp bad guys", stating that when compared to Kefka, Final Fantasy VII antagonist Sephiroth seems <b>as</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>as</b> a dead accountant painted brown. They also compared him to Batman antagonist the Joker, praising him for both his villainous ambition and his laugh. GameSpy declared that Kefka is quite possibly the greatest video game villain of all time.|$|E
