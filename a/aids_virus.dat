5|$|RNA-dependent DNA polymerases are a {{specialized}} class of polymerases that copy {{the sequence of}} an RNA strand into DNA. They include reverse transcriptase, which is a viral enzyme involved in the infection of cells by retroviruses, and telomerase, which {{is required for the}} replication of telomeres. For example, HIV reverse transcriptase is an enzyme for <b>AIDS</b> <b>virus</b> replication. Telomerase is an unusual polymerase because it contains its own RNA template as part of its structure. It synthesizes telomeres at the ends of chromosomes. Telomeres prevent fusion of the ends of neighboring chromosomes and protect chromosome ends from damage.|$|E

50|$|These {{proteins}} play a {{major role}} in assembly and budding of VSIV virions. Their main role is to <b>aid</b> <b>virus</b> assembly. They starts by shutting off host cell transcription by inhibiting mRNA nuclear export through direct interaction with the host RAE1-NUP98 complex. This inhibits interferon signaling and thus establishment of antiviral state in virus infected cells. In turn, this induces cell-rounding, cytoskeleton disorganization and apoptosis in infected cell. Enveloped viruses acquire their membrane by budding at a membrane of their host cell.|$|R

40|$|Potato aucuba mosaic {{virus and}} potato virus C were {{transmitted}} by the aphid Myzuspersicae, {{not only from}} plants also infected with a helper virus, but also from plants infected with em alone, provided the aphids fed first on plants infected with the helper virus. Several different viruses acted as helpers but all are in the potato virus Y group. Helper viruses differed in the efficiency with which they aided potato aucuba mosaic virus and potato virus C, and some potato aucuba mosaic virus isolates were transmitted more frequently than others. With potato virus Y as helper, up to 3 o % of the aphids transmitted potato aucuba mosaic virus. Aphids were usually fed for brief periods on plants infected with the helper virus but aphids fed for 2 days also transmitted potato aucuba mosaic virus readily. Starving the aphids for I to 2 hr between their acquisition feeds on plants infected with helper and <b>aided</b> <b>virus</b> decreased but did not eliminate transmission. The helper virus need not be infective; potato aucuba mosaic virus and potato virus C were transmitted as frequently when transmission of the helper virus was prevented by exposing the source leaf to u. v. radiation as when it was not. Virus was not transmitted by aphids fed through artificial membranes on extracts of leaves infected with potato virus Y, potato aucuba mosaic virus or a mixture of the two. However, potato aucuba mosaic virus was transmitted from extracts by aphids fed through membranes when the aphids had previously fed on a potato virus Y-infected leaf. Similarly, potato virus Y was transmitted from leaf extracts by aphids fed through membranes when the aphids had previously fed on a potato virus Y-infected leaf that had been irradiated with u. v. to prevent transmission of potato virus Y from this source.

Moreover, current animal models remain limited, because they do not recapitulate similar disease patterns and symptoms observed in humans. In this review the role of the host–viral interactions of EV 71 are discussed together with the various models available to examine: how EV 71 utilizes its proteins to cleave host factors and proteins, <b>aiding</b> <b>virus</b> replication; how EV 71 uses its own viral proteins to disrupt host immune responses and aid in its immune evasion.

40|$|Soluble receptors for gamma {{interferon}} (IFN-gamma) are secreted from cells infected by 17 orthopoxviruses, including vaccinia, cowpox, rabbitpox, buffalopox, elephantpox, and camelpox viruses, representing three species (vaccinia, cowpox, and campelpox viruses). The B 8 R {{open reading frame}} of vaccinia virus strain Western Reserve, which has sequence similarity to the extracellular binding domain of cellular IFN-gamma receptors (IFN-gamma Rs), is shown to encode an IFN-gamma binding activity by expression in recombinant baculovirus. The soluble virus IFN-gamma Rs bind IFN-gamma and, by preventing its interaction with the cellular receptor, interfere with the antiviral effects induced by this cytokine. Interestingly, in contrast to cellular IFN-gamma Rs, which are highly species specific, the vaccinia, cowpox, and camelpox virus IFN-gamma Rs bind and inhibit the biological activity of human, bovine, and rat IFN-gamma but not mouse IFN-gamma. This unique broad species specificity of the IFN-gamma R would <b>aid</b> <b>virus</b> replication in different species and suggests that vaccinia, cowpox, and camelpox viruses may have evolved in several species, possibly including humans but excluding mice.

40|$|During acute human viral infections, such as {{influenza}} A, specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) {{are generated}} which <b>aid</b> <b>virus</b> clearance. We {{have observed that}} in HLA-A* 0201 + subjects, CTL expressing Vβ 17 + TCR and recognizing a peptide from the influenza A matrix protein (M 158 – 66) dominate this response. In experimental models of infection such dominance can be due to inheritance of a restricted T cell repertoire or acquired consequent on expansion of CTL bearing an optimum TCR conformation against the MHC–peptide complex. To examine how influenza A infection might influence the development of TCR V 0 β 17 expansion, we studied influenza A-specific CTL in a cross-sectional study of 82 HLA-A* 0201 + individuals from birth (cord blood) to adulthood. Primary M 158 – 66 -specific CTL were detected in cord blood, but their TCR were diverse and depletion of Vβ 17 + cells did not abrogate specific cytotoxicity. In contrast following natural influenza A infection, TCR Vβ 17 + CTL dominated {{to the extent that}} only one of nine adult CTL lines retained any functional activity after in vitro depletion of Vβ 17 + CTL.

40|$|Vaccinia virus {{produces}} {{four different}} types of virion from each infected cell called intracellular mature virus (IMV), intracellular enveloped virus (IEV), cell-associated enveloped virus (CEV) and extracellular enveloped virus (EEV). These virions have different abundance, structure, location and roles in the virus life-cycle. Here, the formation and function of these virions are considered with emphasis on the EEV form and its precursors, IEV and CEV. IMV is the most abundant form of virus and is retained in cells until lysis; it is a robust, stable virion and is well suited to transmit infection between hosts. IEV is formed by wrapping of IMV with intracellular membranes, and is an intermediate between IMV and CEV/EEV that enables efficient virus dissemination to the cell surface on microtubules. CEV induces the formation of actin tails that drive CEV particles away from the cell and is important for cell-to-cell spread. Lastly, EEV mediates the long-range dissemination of virus in cell culture and, probably, in vivo. Seven virus-encoded proteins have been identified that are components of IEV, and five of them are present in CEV or EEV. The roles of these proteins in virus morphogenesis and dissemination, and as targets for neutralizing antibody are reviewed. The production of several different virus particles in the VV replication cycle represents a coordinated strategy to exploit cell biology to promote virus spread and to <b>aid</b> <b>virus</b> evasion of antibody and complement.

40|$|The human {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) type 16 E 1 ^E 4 (16 E 1 ^E 4) protein {{is expressed in}} the middle to upper layers of infected epithelium and has several roles within the virus life cycle. It is apparent that within the epithelium there are multiple species of 16 E 1 ^E 4 that differ in length and/or degree of phosphorylation and that {{some or all of}} these can associate with the cellular keratin networks, leading to network disruption. We show here that the cellular cysteine protease calpain cleaves the 16 E 1 ^E 4 protein after amino acid 17 to generate species that lack the N terminus. These C-terminal fragments are able to multimerize and form amyloid-like fibers. This can lead to accumulation of 16 E 1 ^E 4 and disruption of the normal dynamics of the keratin networks. The cleavage of E 1 ^E 4 proteins by calpain may be a common strategy used by α-group viruses, since we show that cleavage of type 18 E 1 ^E 4 in raft culture is also dependent on calpain. Interestingly, the cleavage of 16 E 1 ^E 4 by calpain appears to be highly regulated as differentiation of HPV genome-containing cells by methylcellulose is insufficient to induce cleavage. We hypothesize that this is important since it ensures that the formation of the amyloid fibers is not prematurely triggered in the lower layers and is restricted to the upper layers, where calpain is active and where disruption of the keratin networks may <b>aid</b> <b>virus</b> release...|$|R

One hundred fifty-eight term newborn babies in Brisbane, Australia, were recruited progressively into a longitudinal, community-based, birth cohort study conducted between September 2010 and October 2014. A daily tick-box diary captured predefined respiratory symptoms from birth until their second birthday. Weekly parent-collected nasal swabs were batch-tested for 17 respiratory viruses by PCR assays, allowing calculation of virus-specific attributable fractions in the exposed (AFE) to determine the proportion of virus-positive children whose ARI symptoms could be attributed to that particular virus. Of 8100 nasal swabs analysed, 2646 (32. 7 %) were virus-positive (275 virus codetections, 3. 4 %), with human rhinoviruses accounting for 2058 / 2646 (77. 8 %) positive swabs.

40|$|Abstract. Infection by an oncogenic human {{papillomavirus}} (HPV), in particular HPV 16 and 18, {{is a high}} risk factor for developing cervical cancer; however, viral infection alone is not sufficient for cancer progression. Autophagy is hypoth-esized {{to be an important}} process during carcinogenesis. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the association between autophagy and high-risk HPV (hrHPV) infection in human cervical squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), and to analyze the clinical significance of this association. Quantum dot (QD) ‑based immunofluorescence histochemistry was used to detect the expression of autophagy markers, Beclin- 1 and microtubule‑associated proteins 1 A/ 1 B light chain 3 B (LC 3 B) proteins, in 104 cases of cervical cancer (including 80 SCCs and 24 adenocarcinomas) and 20 normal cervical tissues. hrHPV (HPV 16 / 18) infection was detected by QDs based fluorescence in situ hybridization in cervical cancers. The results revealed that the expression levels of Beclin- 1 and LC 3 B were significantly lower in cervical cancer cells when compared with those of normal cervical squamous epithelial cells, and were found to negatively correlate with hrHPV infection. The expression levels of Beclin‑ 1 and LC 3 B were not associated with age, tumor grade, tumor stage, tumor node metastasis stage or lymph node metastasis. However, a positive correlation was identified between Beclin‑ 1 and LC 3 B protein expression. In addition, the absence of autophagy in combina-tion with hrHPV infection may accelerate the progression of cervical SCC. In conclusion, decreased expression of Beclin‑ 1 and LC 3 B may be important in cervical carcinogenesis.
