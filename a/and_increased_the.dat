5|$|American {{alligators}} {{are recorded}} as making 242 unprovoked attacks between 1948 and mid-2004, causing sixteen human fatalities. Ten {{of these were}} {{in the water and}} two were on land; the circumstances of the other four are not known. Most attacks were in the warmer months of the year, though in Florida, with its warmer climate, attacks can happen at any time of year. Alligators are considered to be less aggressive than either the Nile or saltwater crocodile, but the increase in density of the human population in the Everglades has brought people and alligators into closer proximity <b>and</b> <b>increased</b> <b>the</b> risk of alligator attacks. Conversely in Mauritania, where the crocodiles' growth is severely stunted by the arid conditions, the local people swim with them without being attacked.|$|E

40|$|Link-layer {{retransmission}} is {{a feature}} of IEEE 802. 11 protocol that aims to <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> reliability of data communications. However, when successive retransmissions fail, retransmissions add to the traffic congestion, raise <b>the</b> collision probability, <b>and</b> <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> end-to-end delay. Using our 4 -hop wireless mesh network testbed, we evaluate the impact of link-layer retransmissions {{on the performance of}} video streaming in wireless multi-hop environment. Our experimental results show that when the traffic load is near the network capacity, retransmissions cause erratic video quality <b>and</b> <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> end-to-end delay tremendously. When the best-effort traffic coexists, <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> number of retransmissions degrades the goodput of best-effort traffic <b>and</b> <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> end-to-end delay of video streaming. Retransmissions add reliability <b>and</b> <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> video streaming quality when the traffic volume is far below the network capacity limit...|$|R

He declared martial law in 1678 and 1680 – both during his periods as temporary governor of the island– because of the threat of invasion, re-built the fortifications surrounding the town, <b>and</b> <b>increased</b> <b>the</b> number of cannon from 60 to more than 100 in the five years up to 1680.|$|E
5|$|Finland {{had been}} {{the eastern part of}} the Swedish kingdom for centuries until 1809, during the Napoleonic Wars, when Imperial Russia conquered and {{converted}} it into an autonomous buffer state within the Russian Empire to protect Saint Petersburg, the imperial capital. Finland enjoyed wide autonomy and its own Senate until the turn of the century, when Russia began attempts to assimilate Finland as part of a general policy to strengthen central government and unify the Empire by Russification. These attempts ruined relations <b>and</b> <b>increased</b> <b>the</b> support of Finnish movements vying for self-government.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{grouping}} of railway companies in 1923, the LSWR {{became part of}} the Southern Railway (SR) and its publicity department gave the N15locomotives names associated with Arthurian legend; the class hence becoming known as King Arthurs. The Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) of the newly formed company, Richard Maunsell, modified the Urie locomotives in the light of operational experience <b>and</b> <b>increased</b> <b>the</b> class strength to 74 locomotives.

5|$|His {{policies}} and tactics highlighted <b>and</b> <b>increased</b> <b>the</b> {{separation between the}} king and his subjects. Andrianjaka transformed social divisions into spatial divisions by assigning each clan to a specific geographical region within his kingdom. He made a demonstration of royal power by appropriating the local tradition of sampy (talismans), previously created by village chiefs and others for personal or local spiritual ends, restricting their number to twelve and declaring their creation a strictly royal prerogative. The king also imposed an intimidating change to the traditional form of justice, the trial by ordeal: Andrianjaka ordered that rather than administering tangena poison to an accused person's rooster to determine their innocence by the creature's survival, the poison would instead be ingested by the accused himself.|$|E

5|$|Initially, {{the death}} of Kirchner caused a power vacuum, as Cristina Kirchner had ruled so far as a figurehead, while Néstor Kirchner still managed the {{government}}. She changed {{the style of the}} government making it more authoritarian, and more critical of the U.S.. She broke with allies of her husband, such as the union leader Hugo Moyano, <b>and</b> <b>increased</b> <b>the</b> political clout of the youth wing La Cámpora instead. She also relied on her public image more than her husband had. The popularity of the Kirchners had been in a decline at the time of Néstor's death, but after being widowed, Cristina Kirchner's popularity increased greatly. As a result, she won the reelection in the 2011 general elections by a landslide.|$|E

He also increasingly controlled the {{meetings of the}} Scottish General Assembly <b>and</b> <b>increased</b> <b>the</b> number and powers of the Scottish bishops. In 1618, he held a General Assembly and pushed through Five Articles, which included practices that had been retained in England but largely abolished in Scotland, most controversially kneeling for the reception of communion. Although ratified, they created widespread opposition and resentment and were {{seen by many as}} a step back to Catholic practice.|$|E
