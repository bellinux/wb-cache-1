5|$|Although the Larry O'Brien Trophy {{has been}} {{compared}} with the National Hockey League's (NHL) Stanley Cup, {{it has never been}} as prominent as the NHL trophy. To reduce this discrepancy, the NBA has been actively promoting the O'Brien Trophy in recent years to generate more recognition and an iconic status for the trophy. After the Detroit Pistons won the NBA Finals in 2004, the trophy was toured <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> of Michigan, marking the first time the trophy toured <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> of the winning team. In 2005, the NBA Legends Tour was launched in New York City. As part of the tour, the O’Brien Trophy was showcased in various cities—including those that were hosting the playoffs—for fans' autograph and photo sessions. It was escorted by many former players, including Julius Erving, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Bill Russell. In May 2007, the NBA unveiled the NBA Headquarters on Second Life, an Internet-based virtual reality environment. With this launch, fans could take pictures with the championship trophy in the virtual Toyota Larry O'Brien Trophy Room.

5|$|Beaumont almost {{instantly}} became a boomtown with investors from <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> {{and the nation}} participating in land speculation. Investment in Texas speculation in 1901 reached approximately $235 million US (approximately $ in present-day terms). The level of oil speculation in Pennsylvania and {{other areas of the}} United States was quickly surpassed by the speculation in Texas. The Lucas gusher itself was short-lived; production fell to 10,000 barrels per day by 1904. The strike, however, was only the beginning of a much larger trend.|$|E
5|$|Coolidge and Cox were renominated {{for their}} {{respective}} offices in 1919. By this time Coolidge's supporters (especially Stearns) had publicized his {{actions in the}} Police Strike <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> and the nation and some of Coolidge's speeches were published in book form. He faced the same opponent as in 1918, Richard Long, but this time Coolidge defeated him by 125,101 votes, more than seven times his margin of victory from a year earlier. His actions in the police strike, combined with the massive electoral victory, led to suggestions that Coolidge {{run for president in}} 1920.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the earlier}} {{negative}} associations with oil among many ranchers and farmers, demand for kerosene and other petroleum derivatives drove oil prospecting in Texas after the American Civil War at known oil-producing springs and accidental finds while drilling for water. One {{of the first}} significant wells in Texas was developed {{near the town of}} Oil Springs, near Nacogdoches. The site began production in 1866. The first oilfield in Texas with a substantial economic impact was developed in 1894 near Corsicana. In 1898, the field built the state's first modern refinery. The success of the Corsicana field and increasing demand for oil worldwide led to more exploration <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>state.</b>|$|E

5|$|Dow {{spent the}} early 1840s {{attending}} to his tanning business, but also {{found time to}} encourage individual drinkers to take up abstinence. In 1842, he and his allies succeeded in getting the city government in Portland to require licenses for liquor dealers and to prosecute unlicensed sellers; {{a referendum on the}} question was decided in the prohibitionists' favor later that year. The next year saw the Democrats win election to city government, replacing the more prohibition-friendly Whigs, and many liquor-sellers resumed their trade as prosecutions were deferred indefinitely. Dow kept up his speaking efforts <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>state,</b> despite once being assaulted by a man hired by a liquor dealer.|$|E
5|$|Elephants {{have been}} an {{integral}} part of the culture of the state. Kerala is home to the largest domesticated population of elephants in India—about 700 Indian elephants, owned by temples as well as individuals. These elephants are mainly employed for the processions and displays associated with festivals celebrated all <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>state.</b> More than 10,000 festivals are celebrated in the state annually and some animal lovers have sometimes raised concerns regarding the overwork of domesticated elephants during them. In Malayalam literature, elephants are referred to as the 'sons of the sahya. The elephant is the state animal of Kerala and is featured on the emblem of the Government of Kerala.|$|E
5|$|In 1912, the {{governor}} of Indiana instituted Riley Day on the poet's birthday. Schools were required to teach Riley's poems to their children, and banquet events were held in his honor <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>state.</b> In 1915 and 1916 the celebration was national after being proclaimed in most states. The annual celebration continued in Indiana until 1968. In early 1916 Riley was filmed {{as part of a}} movie to celebrate Indiana's centennial, the video is on display at the Indiana State Library.|$|E

In response to the announcement, farmers from <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> responded generously with donations of old machinery and equipment. Most of this machinery was restored by Department of Agriculture mechanics. In 1978 an invitation to visit and open Avondale's agricultural displays was sent to Prince Charles, this was accepted and on 16 March 1979 Avondale was officially opened with commemorative tree planting near the entrance to the farm.|$|E
5|$|South Dakota's culture {{reflects}} the state's American Indian, rural, Western, and European roots. A number of annual events celebrating the state's ethnic and historical heritage take place <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>state,</b> such as Days of '76 in Deadwood, Czech Days in Tabor, {{and the annual}} St. Patrick's Day and Cinco de Mayo festivities in Sioux Falls. The various tribes hold many annual pow wows at their reservations throughout the state, to which non-Native Americans are sometimes invited. Custer State Park holds an annual Buffalo Roundup, in which volunteers on horseback gather the park's herd of around 1,500 bison.|$|E
5|$|There {{are nine}} {{television}} stations broadcasting in South Dakota; South Dakota Public Television broadcasts {{from a number}} of locations <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>state,</b> while the other stations broadcast from Sioux Falls or Rapid City.

5|$|Tillman {{spoke at}} the opening of Clemson College on July 6, 1893. He {{fulfilled}} his campaign promise to start a women's college. In 1891, the legislature passed a bill creating the South Carolina Industrial and Winthrop Normal College (today Winthrop University). He took a personal interest in the bidding by various towns <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> for the new school, and supported the successful candidate, the progressive town of Rock Hill, on the state's northern border. Rock Hill officials had offered land, cash, and building materials. The school, then admitting only white women, opened in October 1895, after Tillman had become a senator.|$|E
5|$|Bart and Lisa {{go fishing}} {{downstream}} of the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, and Springfield Shopper reporter Dave Shutton pulls {{up just as}} Bart catches a three-eyed fish, much to both the kids' and Shutton's surprise. The fish, nicknamed Blinky by the media, makes headlines <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>state,</b> and incumbent governor Mary Bailey calls in a government inspection team to investigate nuclear waste coming from the plant that could have caused the fish to mutate. After the inspection, the plant's owner, Mr. Burns, is presented {{with a list of}} 342 violations, which would cost $56 million to rectify. Distraught, Mr. Burns talks to plant employee Homer, who half-heartedly suggests Mr. Burns run for governor against Bailey so that he could change the standards and prevent the plant from being shut down. Mr. Burns instantly pounces on the idea.|$|E
5|$|Colleagues urged Charlton {{to stand}} for the state electoral {{district}} of Waratah, and on 5 December 1903 Charlton became the second member for the district in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly. His representation of that district was short-lived, as the next year he transferred to Northumberland, replacing John Norton. Charlton became the unofficial spokesperson for the miners, speaking principally about mining matters in parliament. In 1909 a coal miners' strike struck New South Wales and Charlton was called upon by the Colliery Employees' Federation to represent {{it in front of}} a wage board. Charlton was unsuccessful in gaining better conditions for the miners but he did settle the dispute, talking to miners <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> and convincing them to return to work. He resigned from state politics and in 1910 Charlton wrested the federal Division of Hunter from the sitting Frank Liddell. Hunter has remained a safe Labor seat ever since.|$|E
