5|$|According to the {{theories}} prevailing at the time, light traveling through a moving medium would be dragged {{along by the}} medium, so that the measured speed of the light would be a simple sum of its speed through the medium plus {{the speed of the}} medium. Fizeau indeed detected a dragging effect, but the magnitude of the effect that he observed was far lower than expected. His results seemingly supported the partial aether-drag hypothesis of Fresnel, <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>that</b> was disconcerting to most physicists. Over half a century passed before a satisfactory explanation of Fizeau's unexpected measurement was developed with the advent of Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity. Einstein later pointed out the importance of the experiment for special relativity, in which it corresponds to the relativistic velocity-addition formula when restricted to small velocities.|$|E

5|$|Asad's {{resolution}} in confronting the khagan, and the wise strategic choice of making Balkh his residence, paid off, and {{allowed him to}} salvage <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>that,</b> {{in the wake of}} several defeats {{at the hands of the}} Turgesh, appeared seemingly hopeless—indeed, Caliph Hisham is said to have been incredulous at the first news of Asad's victory. The victory at Kharistan consolidated the Arab position in Khurasan, and particularly in Tokharistan, where the local rulers would certainly have gone over to the Turgesh if the latter had won or remained unopposed. Conversely the defeat diminished the prestige of Suluk, and may possibly have played a role in his assassination early in 738, although rivalries between the Turgesh, fanned by the Chinese court, were more directly responsible for it. The Turgesh khaganate then collapsed into infighting, and stopped being a serious threat to Arab interests in the area. As a result, the Battle of Kharistan is considered a turning point for the Arab fortunes in Central Asia.|$|E
5|$|Clydesdale (or Strathclyde) was {{the heartland}} of the old Kingdom of Strathclyde; by Donnchadh's day the Scots had settled many English and Continental Europeans (principally Flemings) in the region, and {{administered}} it through the sheriffdom of Lanark. Gaelic too had penetrated much of the old Northumbrian and Strathclyde territory, coming from the west, south-west and the north, <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>that</b> led historian Alex Woolf to compare the region to the Balkans. The British language of the area, {{as a result of}} such developments, was probably either dead or almost dead, perhaps surviving only in the uplands of Clydesdale, Tweeddale and Annandale.|$|E
5|$|Investigators {{confirmed}} that {{the site of the}} fire had been used as an illegal factory to manufacture leather bags.

The factory destroyed in the fire was found to be owned and operated by Tenex Exports, and all of the people who were killed or injured in the fire slept in the factory at night, <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>that</b> is not considered unusual in India. There was had just one emergency exit, and 40 workers were housed in the structure at the time of the fire, and the owner had locked the factory at night to prevent workers from running away with leather goods.

5|$|The 1890s were {{a period}} of {{remarkable}} creative output for Durkheim. In 1893, he published The Division of Labour in Society, his doctoral dissertation and fundamental statement {{of the nature of}} human society and its development. Durkheim's interest in social phenomena was spurred on by politics. France's defeat in the Franco-Prussian War led to the fall of the regime of Napoleon III, which was then replaced by the Third Republic. This in turn resulted in a backlash against the new secular and republican rule, as many people considered a vigorously nationalistic approach necessary to rejuvenate France's fading power. Durkheim, a Jew and a staunch supporter of the Third Republic with a sympathy towards socialism, was thus in the political minority, <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>that</b> galvanized him politically. The Dreyfus affair of 1894 only strengthened his activist stance.|$|E
5|$|The 1981 Entumbane uprising, {{also known}} as the Battle of Bulawayo or Entumbane II, {{occurred}} between 8 and 12 February 1981 in and around Bulawayo, Zimbabwe amid political tensions in the newly independent state. Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA) guerrillas, mainly in the city's western suburb of Entumbane, rebelled, creating <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>that</b> threatened to develop into a fresh civil war, barely a year {{after the end of the}} Bush War. The Rhodesian African Rifles (RAR) and other white-commanded elements of the former Rhodesian Security Forces, fighting for the Zimbabwean government as part of the new Zimbabwe National Army, put down the uprising. Groups of Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA) fighters attacked both ZIPRA and the government forces during the revolt, which followed a smaller outbreak of fighting between guerrillas in November 1980.|$|E
5|$|During {{a couple}} of the Svea flights, Andrée tested and tried out the drag-rope {{steering}} technique which he had developed and wanted to use on his projected North Pole expedition. Drag ropes, which hang from the balloon basket and drag part of their length on the ground, are designed to counteract the tendency of lighter-than-air craft to travel at the same speed as the wind, <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>that</b> makes steering by sails impossible. The friction of the ropes was intended to slow the balloon {{to the point where the}} sails would have an effect (beyond that of making the balloon rotate on its axis). Andrée reported, and presumably believed, that with drag rope/sails steering he had succeeded in deviating about ten degrees either way from the wind direction. This notion is rejected by modern balloonists; the Swedish Ballooning Association maintains that Andrée's belief that he had deviated from the wind was mistaken, being misled by inexpertise and a surfeit of enthusiasm in an environment of variable winds and poor visibility. Use of drag ropes (prone to snapping, falling off, or becoming entangled with each other or the ground, in addition to being ineffective) is not considered by any modern expert to be a useful steering technique.|$|E

5|$|In 1754, {{representatives of}} seven British North American colonies {{met in the}} Stadt Huys, Albany's city hall, for the Albany Congress; Benjamin Franklin of Pennsylvania {{presented}} the Albany Plan of Union there, {{which was the first}} formal proposal to unite the colonies. Although it was never adopted by Parliament, it was an important precursor to the United States Constitution. The same year, the French and Indian War, the fourth in a series of wars dating back to 1689, began; it ended in 1763 with French defeat, resolving <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>that</b> had been a constant threat to Albany and held back its growth. In 1775, with the colonies {{in the midst of the}} Revolutionary War, the Stadt Huys became home to the Albany Committee of Correspondence (the political arm of the local revolutionary movement), which took over operation of Albany's government and eventually expanded its power to control all of Albany County. Tories and prisoners of war were often jailed in the Stadt Huys alongside common criminals. In 1776, Albany native Philip Livingston signed the Declaration of Independence at Independence Hall in Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|The Privy Council's primary {{function}} was judicial, {{but it also}} acted as a body of advisers to the king {{and as a result}} its secondary function was as an executive in the absence or minority of the monarchy. Although the monarch might often attend the council, their presence was not necessary for the council to act with royal authority. Like parliament, it had the power to issue acts that could have the force of law. After James VI's departure to England in 1603, it functioned as a subservient executive carrying out his instructions from London. Although the theoretical membership of the council was relatively large, at around 30 persons, most of the business was carried out by an informal inner group, consisting mainly of the officers of state. Before 1610 the council was presided over by the Lord Chancellor, but in 1610 James VI decreed that the President of the College of Justice should preside in the Chancellor's absence, and by 1619 the additional title of President of the Privy Council had been added. The two presidencies were separated in 1626 as part of Charles I's reorganisation of the Privy Council and Court of Session. The Lord President of the Council was accorded precedence as one of the King's chief officers in 1661. After the Restoration, Charles II nominated his own privy councillors and set up a council in London through which he directed affairs in Edinburgh, <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>that</b> continued after the Glorious Revolution of 1688–9. The council was abolished after the Act of Union on 1 May 1708.|$|E
5|$|The San Diego Chargers got 16 first downs, {{compared}} to 5 for the Buccaneers. Chargers {{players and coaches}} praised the Buccaneers’ defense, who held them to 9 points until the final three minutes of the game, saying that they played the equivalent of five quarters. Three Tampa Bay quarterbacks completed a combined 3 of 8 passes for −4 yards. Buccaneers receiver Bob Moore said, “We’re at rock bottom now...but if we start pointing a finger, we’ll go 0–14”. The Chargers finished with 325 yards of offense to the Buccaneers’ 125. Inconsistent blocking was blamed for the offensive problems, <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>that</b> was not helped by the injury to tackle Dave Reavis. Mercury Morris, who had been picked up on waivers by the Chargers from the Miami Dolphins after the Buccaneers’ preseason game against the Dolphins, commented that the difference in Buccaneers’ offensive line protection between the two games was like watching two different teams. The Buccaneers’ lack of speed was also noticeable. The loss {{marked the first time}} since 1961 that a professional football team was shut out {{in the first two games}} of the season, when the Oakland Raiders were shut out by the same two teams in the same order.|$|E
