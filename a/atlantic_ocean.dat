5|$|All major {{forecasting}} agencies predicted an above-average season. All {{reduced their}} seasonal predictions in early August, {{but even the}} revised predictions were too high. The lack of activity was primarily caused by an unexpected significant weakening of the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean</b> thermohaline circulation between winter and spring. This resulted in continuation of the spring weather pattern over the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean,</b> with strong vertical wind shear, mid-level moisture, and atmospheric stability, which suppressed tropical cyclogenesis.|$|E
5|$|An Atlantic {{hurricane}} or {{tropical storm}} is a tropical cyclone that {{forms in the}} <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean,</b> usually in the summer or fall. A hurricane differs from a cyclone or typhoon only {{on the basis of}} location. A hurricane is a storm that occurs in the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean</b> and northeastern Pacific Ocean, a typhoon occurs in the northwestern Pacific Ocean, and a cyclone occurs in the south Pacific or Indian Ocean.|$|E

5|$|Buenos Aires {{is located}} in the humid {{subtropical}} climate zone (Köppen climate classification: Cfa).

5|$|The South <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean</b> is {{generally}} inhospitable {{to the formation}} of a tropical storm. Although rare, a growing number of subtropical cyclones have developed in the South <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean</b> near Brazil, such as the unofficially-named Hurricane Catarina of 2004 that made landfall as a Category 2 on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale. Since 2011, certain storms have official names, such as Subtropical Storm Arani. At least one storm has formed near the West Coast of Africa.|$|E

It then curves and flows southwest-ward to southward toward the Atlantic.|$|E
