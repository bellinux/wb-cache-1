The colour of a frog's skin is used for thermoregulation. In cool damp conditions, the colour will be darker than on a hot dry day. The grey foam-nest tree frog (Chiromantis xerampelina) is even able to turn white to minimize the chance of overheating.|$|E

5|$|Germanicus was a {{favorite}} of his great-uncle Augustus who for some time considered him heir to the Empire. In AD 4, persuaded by his wife Livia, Augustus decided in favor of Tiberius, his stepson from Livia's first marriage to Tiberius Claudius Nero. As a condition of Tiberius' own adoption by Augustus, Tiberius was to <b>adopt</b> Germanicus as a son and to name him as his heir. If Tiberius had not adopted Germanicus before his own adoption, and had Augustus adopted Tiberius first, then Tiberius would have lost sui iuris, which included the legal authority to <b>adopt.</b> It was a corollary to the adoption, probably the next year, that Germanicus married his maternal second cousin, Agrippina the Elder.|$|E

40|$|In the {{adoption}} process, adoptive parents and <b>adopted</b> {{children need to}} transform from strangers to each other into family members. The forming of a parent-child relationship that is trustworthy and safe is crucial for the adjustment of <b>adopted</b> children. Positive family relationships are important {{for the development of}} children’s’ personal identity and are protective factors in relation to problem behavior. This study examined the relationship between parental, child and family factors and the involvement of <b>adopted</b> children with their adoptive family. Informants were adoptive parents of 982 Chinese adoptees in The Netherlands, aged 3 to 16 years. The child-rearing context of adoptive families with and without biological children differed on family size, age at adoption, <b>adopted</b> children’s interest in adoption, parent’s close bond with their <b>adopted</b> children and the time adoptive parents spent with their <b>adopted</b> children. <b>Adopted</b> children without siblings in the adoptive family were less involved with their adoptive families compared to <b>adopted</b> children that have been raised together with other children in the family. In both all-adoptive families and families with <b>adopted</b> children and biological children, <b>adopted</b> children were more involved with their adoptive families if parents reported a closer bond with their <b>adopted</b> children. Another finding was that the more parents got along with their <b>adopted</b> children, the more involved their <b>adopted</b> children were with their adoptive family. In conclusion, a good preparation of future adoptive parents about their responsibility as a parent and educater is desirable, as well as a warm and accepting parenting style, to form strong family tie...|$|R

Therefore, the aims of this study were to compare the presence of ADHD symptoms in a sample of children <b>adopted</b> from Eastern Europe with a sample of children <b>adopted</b> from other regions and also to examine the influence of selected personal and family factors in the display of these symptoms. Ninety-three children <b>adopted</b> from Eastern Europe were assessed with the Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham‐IV (SNAP-IV) scale and their scores were compared with the scores of 115 children <b>adopted</b> from other regions. Children <b>adopted</b> from Eastern Europe showed more ADHD symptoms than children <b>adopted</b> from other regions. Being a girl was a protective factor for the Hyperactivity/impulsivity scale and older children were more likely to show inattention. However, the reasons why these symptoms are more frequent in children <b>adopted</b> from Eastern Europe are still uncertain: the interaction between the stories and characteristics of the <b>adopted</b> child and adoptive parents should be further explored in order to best help these children to adapt to their new family and societ...|$|R
