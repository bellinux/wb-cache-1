Typical <b>analytical</b> <b>results</b> are presented for a stiffener runout specimen that is being defined to simulate the TIBB failure mechanisms.

5000|$|A {{nonlinear}} theory explaining transition, {{has also}} been proposed. Although that theory does include linear transient growth, {{the focus is on}} 3D nonlinear processes that are strongly suspected to underlie transition to turbulence in shear flows. The theory has led to the construction of so-called complete 3D steady states, traveling waves and time-periodic solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations that capture many of the key features of transition and coherent structures observed in the near wall region of turbulent shear flows. Even though [...] "solution" [...] usually implies the existence of an <b>analytical</b> <b>result,</b> it is common practice in fluid mechanics to refer to numerical results as [...] "solutions" [...] - regardless of whether the approximated solutions satisfy the Navier-Stokes equations in a mathematically satisfactory way or not. It is postulated that transition to turbulence involves the dynamic state of the fluid evolving from one solution to the next. The theory is thus predicated upon the actual existence of such solutions (many of which have yet to be observed in a physical experimental setup). This relaxation on the requirement of exact solutions allows a great deal of flexibility, since exact solutions are extremely difficult to obtain (contrary to numerical [...] "solutions), at the expense of rigor and (possibly) correctness. Thus, even though not as rigorous as previous approaches to transition, it has gained immense popularity.|$|E
