5|$|Many sunscreens use {{nanoparticles}} of {{zinc oxide}} (along with nanoparticles of titanium dioxide) because such small particles do not scatter light and therefore {{do not appear}} white. There has been concern {{that they might be}} absorbed into the skin. A study published in 2010 found a 0.23% to 1.31% (mean 0.42%) of blood zinc levels in venous blood samples could be traced to zinc from ZnO nanoparticles applied to human skin for 5 days, and traces were also found in urine samples. In contrast, <b>a</b> <b>comprehensive</b> <b>review</b> <b>of</b> the medical literature from 2011 says that no evidence of systemic absorption {{can be found in the}} literature.|$|E
5|$|The order Rodentia may {{be divided}} into suborders, infraorders, superfamilies and families. There {{is a great deal}} of {{parallelism}} and convergence among rodents caused by the fact that they have tended to evolve to fill largely similar niches. This parallel evolution includes not only the structure of the teeth, but also the infraorbital region of the skull (below the eye socket) and makes classification difficult as similar traits may not be due to common ancestry. Brandt (1855) was the first to propose dividing Rodentia into three suborders, Sciuromorpha, Hystricomorpha and Myomorpha, based on the development of certain muscles in the jaw and this system was widely accepted. Schlosser (1884) performed <b>a</b> <b>comprehensive</b> <b>review</b> <b>of</b> rodent fossils, mainly using the cheek teeth, and found that they fitted into the classical system, but Tullborg (1899) proposed just two sub-orders, Sciurognathi and Hystricognathi. These were based on the degree of inflection of the lower jaw and were to be further subdivided into Sciuromorpha, Myomorpha, Hystricomorpha and Bathyergomorpha. Matthew (1910) created a phylogenetic tree of New World rodents but did not include the more problematic Old World species. Further attempts at classification continued without agreement, with some authors adopting the classical three suborder system and others Tullborg's two suborders.|$|E

25|$|A Danish documentary, Caught in Micro Debt, {{produced}} {{and directed by}} journalist Tom Heinemann, aired on Norwegian national television NRK in November 2010.

The documentary falsely accused Yunus and Grameen Bank of diverting 7billion taka (about 100 million US dollars) given by the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (NORAD) from Grameen Bank to another organisation called Grameen Kalyan in 1996. This allegation was widely spread in the Bangladeshi electronic media in December 2010.

25|$|Extinction {{was caused}} by {{persecution}} (mainly for specimens), land use changes, {{and the introduction of}} predators such as cats and stoats. It was generally accepted until the late 20th century that the species' disappearance was due to competition by introduced predators for the kiore, or Pacific rat, a favorite prey of the laughing owl (an idea originally advanced by Walter Buller). However, since the kiore is itself an introduced animal, the laughing owl originally preyed on small birds, reptiles and bats, and later probably utilized introduced mice as well. Direct predation on this unwary and gentle-natured bird seems much more likely to have caused the species' extinction. <b>A</b> <b>comprehensive</b> <b>review</b> <b>of</b> the species' decline and disappearance is presented by Williams & Harrison (1972).|$|E

25|$|Since its founding, the RIPB had {{comprised}} 5 departments - Communications, Discipline, Human Resource, Welfare and the Gryphon's Committee (the latter's mandate was {{to drum up}} school spirit).

This top-down change generated a fair amount of controversy as the objections of numerous alumni to the changes were overruled by the school management.|$|E
25|$|Season 2006 began promisingly, {{but ended}} with {{criticism}} by club {{members of the}} performance of the club. Geelong beat Adelaide to claim the pre-season NAB Cup. Big wins at home against the Brisbane Lions and Kangaroos in the first two rounds fuelled optimism. However, Geelong began to underperform, losing some close encounters and suffering some humiliating defeats, including a three-point loss to eventual premiers, West Coast in Round 10, despite leading by nine goals in the three quarter. In the final game of the year, the Cats were soundly beaten by Hawthorn for the second time. Geelong finished tenth on the ladder with ten wins and a draw. Responding to member anger, the Board ordered <b>a</b> <b>comprehensive</b> <b>review</b> <b>of</b> all aspects of the administration of the club and of the club's personnel. Coach Mark Thompson was widely perceived to be at risk. However, the review accepted that Thompson should continue as coach.
