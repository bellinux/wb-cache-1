40|$|The {{learning}} {{principles that}} guide the acquisition and extinction of avoidance {{are not fully}} understood. We developed a novel paradigm to study the temporal dynamics of relief, a putative reinforcer of avoidance, and the recovery of fear and avoidance following extinction. During conditioning, the <b>avoidance</b> <b>action</b> canceled the aversive unconditional stimulus (US), without terminating the predictive conditional stimulus (CS). Relief pleasantness was rated after fixed CS offsets, when US omission occured. Avoidance was effective to one CS, but not to another, to track stimulus-specific avoidance learning. Fear was extinguished under response prevention in a separate context. Recovery tests took place 24  h later, in both contexts and with a monetary cost added to the <b>avoidance</b> <b>action.</b> We found that avoidance gradually became stimulus-specific during conditioning, but hardly recovered during delayed testing. Across all phases, initial omissions of the aversive US triggered relief that gradually declined over consecutive omissions, in line with a theoretical prediction error signal. Participants that scored low on distress tolerance, however, displayed sustained levels of relief over continuous omissions. We propose that such forms of sustained relief may produce over-reinforcement of foregoing avoidance actions and promote the development of pathological avoidance. The current paradigm represents an efficacious tool to study the temporal dynamics of relief across avoidance learning and fear extinction and to characterize relief dysregulations in relation to psychopathology. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|RATIONALE: Experimental {{laboratory}} {{studies suggest that}} the approach bias (relatively fast approach responses) toward substance-related materials {{plays an important role in}} problematic substance use. How this bias is moderated by intention to use versus recent use remains unknown. Moreover, the relationship between approach bias and other motivational processes (satiation and craving) and executive functioning remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the cannabis approach bias before and after cannabis use in real-life setting (Amsterdam coffee shops) and to assess the relationship between approach bias, craving, satiation, cannabis use, and response inhibition. METHODS: Cannabis, tobacco, and neutral approach and <b>avoidance</b> <b>action</b> tendencies were measured with the Approach Avoidance Task and compared between 42 heavy cannabis users with the intention to use and 45 heavy cannabis users shortly after cannabis use. The classical Stroop was used to measure response inhibition. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to investigate relationships between approach bias, satiation, craving, cannabis use, and response inhibition. RESULTS: In contrast to the hypotheses, heavy cannabis users with the intention to use did not show a cannabis approach bias, whereas intoxicated cannabis users did show an approach bias regardless of image category. This could be attributed to a general slowing of <b>avoidance</b> <b>action</b> tendencies. Moreover, craving was negatively associated with the approach bias, and no relationships were observed between the cannabis approach bias, satiation, prior cannabis use, and response inhibition.

40|$|Abstract — Safety must be ensured in the {{deployment}} of multi-agent vehicle systems. This paper presents decentralized collision avoidance algorithms for systems with second order dynamics and acceleration constraints, using a switching control law. The technique augments existing multi-agent control laws with the capability to switch to provably safe collision avoidance maneuvers when required. Two algorithms with low computational cost are presented, one for two vehicles and one for more vehicles. In both methods, each vehicle computes avoid sets with respect to every other vehicle. When one or more vehicles are on the boundary of their avoid sets, collision <b>avoidance</b> <b>action</b> is taken. These algorithms are applied in simulation scenarios for which existing techniques either fail or are computationally expensive, and used for information theoretic control of a mobile sensor network to reduce the computational complexity. Finally, they are demonstrated in quadrotor helicopter flight experiments. I...|$|E

30|$|In {{the past}} few years the focus in {{automotive}} related ITS research has shifted towards automated driving and autonomous vehicles. The assumption is that by automating vehicles human errors, which are often the cause of accidents, can be eliminated and hence a future, in which no person dies in traffic accidents, could be realised. Autonomous driving is made possible through developments in Artificial Intelligence technology. This involves the collection of a wide amount of data, including all potential traffic environments and environmental conditions. A main issue with VRUs is their wide variety, e.g. pedestrians with strollers, cyclists. A huge effort will be needed to be able to detect reliably pedestrians in all potential traffic and environmental conditions. And the problem is even larger for identifying cyclists, as was reported by Fairley [11]. The issue was also painfully demonstrated in the first fatal accident with automated vehicles when an Uber vehicle in automated mode had problems to classify correctly a pedestrian walking with a bike and to make the correct collision <b>avoidance</b> <b>action</b> [12].|$|E
40|$|Due to grave {{potential}} human, {{environmental and}} economical consequences of collisions at sea, collision avoidance {{has become an}} important safety concern in navigation. To {{reduce the risk of}} collisions at sea, appropriate collision avoidance actions need to be taken in accordance with the regulations, i. e., International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea. However, the regulations only provide qualitative rules and guidelines, and therefore it requires navigators to decide on collision avoidance actions quantitatively by using their judgments which often leads to making errors in navigation. To better help navigators in collision avoidance, this paper develops a comprehensive collision avoidance decision making model for providing whether a collision <b>avoidance</b> <b>action</b> is required, when to take action and what action to be taken. The model is developed based on three types of collision avoidance actions, such as course change only, speed change only, and a combination of both.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to examine the contribution of anxiety and fundamental emotions to perceived emotion functionality and evaluate the informational value of anxiety measures used in sport versus measures of fundamental emotions in terms of appraisal. A battery of questionnaires comprising the somatic and cognitive subscale of the Competitive State Anxiety Inventory- 2 (CSAI- 2), the State Anxiety Inventory, the Differential Emotions Scale–IV, a perceived functionality of emotions single item, and two items assessing challenge and threat appraisals was administered to 202 athletes competing in individual sports in the United Kingdom. They were tested on recalled pre-competitive emotions experienced before their best and worst competition ever and momentary emotions experienced one hour before an actual competition. In general, measures of fundamental emotions with clear approach or <b>avoidance</b> <b>action</b> tendencies were better predictors of emotion functionality than anxiety measures. Results also suggested that the CSAI- 2 does not convey clear information about an athlete’s appraisal of a competition. Measures of negative and positive fundamental emotions with clear action tendencies were better indicators of athletes’ appraisal patterns. It was concluded that assessment of athletes’ emotional state should not be exclusively based on anxiety measures but should encompass or be replaced with measures of emotions conveying unambiguous information about the athlete-competition relationship...|$|E

The data strongly favor the latter hypothesis. It predicts that during learning of the 2 -way active avoidance CAR task, positive prediction errors generated when rats do not receive an anticipated foot-shock (which is better than expected) cause DA release that reinforces the instrumental <b>avoidance</b> <b>action.</b> In vivo microdialysis in the rat striatum showed that extracellular DA concentration increased during early CAR learning and decreased throughout training returning to baseline once the response was well learned.

In addition, rats with a partial lesion of substantia nigra DA neurons, which did not show increased DA levels during learning, failed to learn this task. These data represent clear and unambiguous evidence that it was the factor positive prediction error, and not hedonia or salience, which caused increase in the tonic level of striatal DA and which reinforced learning of the instrumental avoidance response.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{investigations}} {{have reported that}} emotional faces can be processed subliminally, and that they give rise to specific patterns of brain activation {{in the absence of}} awareness. Recent event-related potential (ERP) studies have suggested that electrophysiological differences occur early in time (< 200 ms) in response to backward masked emotional faces. These findings have been taken as evidence of a rapid non-conscious pathway, which would allow threatening stimuli to be processed rapidly and subsequently allow appropriate <b>avoidance</b> <b>action</b> to be taken. However, for this to be the case, subliminal processing should arise even if the threatening stimulus is not attended. This point has in fact not yet been clearly established. In this ERP study, we investigated whether subliminal processing of fearful faces occurs outside the focus of attention. Fourteen healthy participants performed a line judgement task while fearful and non-fearful (happy or neutral) faces were presented both subliminally and supraliminally. ERPs were compared across the 4 experimental conditions (i. e., subliminal and supraliminal; fearful and non-fearful). The earliest differences between fearful and non fearful faces appeared as an enhanced posterior negativity for the former at 170 ms (the N 170 component) over right temporo-occipital electrodes. This difference was observed for both subliminal (p<. 05) and supraliminal presentations (p<. 01). Our results confirm that subliminal processing of fearful faces occurs early in the course of visual processing, and more importantly, that this arises even when the subject’s attention is engaged in an incidental task...|$|E
40|$|A {{computer}} model was constructed that allowed two vessels {{involved in a}} possible collision situation to take collision <b>avoidance</b> <b>action</b> following the "International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea". The mariners’ actions were modelled by the concepts of the domain and the RDRR (Range to Domain/Range-rate).

Each vessel in the simulation had four domains corresponding to the type of encounter in which the vessel was involved. Values for the time at which a vessel manoeuvres and the domain radii were determined from an analysis of high quality cine films of the radar at H. M. Coastguard at St. Margaret's Bay, Dover. Information was also taken from simulator exercises set up on the Polytechnic radar simulator. The two ship encounter was then developed to become the multi-ship encounter and eventually was able to model over 400 vessels over a two day period through a computer representation of the Dover Strait.

40|$|Background: According to {{decades of}} {{research}} on affective motivation in the human brain, approach motivational states are supported primarily by the left hemisphere and avoidance states by the right hemisphere. The underlying cause of this specialization, however, has remained unknown. Here we conducted a first test of the Sword and Shield Hypothesis (SSH), according to which the hemispheric laterality of affective motivation depends on the laterality of motor control for the dominant hand (i. e., the "sword hand," used preferentially to perform approach actions) and the nondominant hand (i. e., the "shield hand," used preferentially to perform <b>avoidance</b> <b>actions).</b> Methodology/Principal Findings: To determine whether the laterality of approach motivation varies with handedness, we measured alpha-band power (an inverse index of neural activity) in right- and left-handers during resting-state electroencephalography and analyzed hemispheric alpha-power asymmetries {{as a function of}} the participants' trait approach motivational tendencies. Stronger approach motivation was associated with more left-hemisphere activity in right-handers, but with more right-hemisphere activity in left-handers.

Seventeen participants were assigned randomly to five sessions of an attentional retraining procedure or control training.

Moderate cannabis users did not show an attentional bias for cannabis-related cues (measured with the cannabis Stroop task), whereas heavy cannabis users did show an attentional bias for cannabis-related stimuli that cannot be attributed to cognitive control deficits on the classical Stroop task. Moreover, heavy cannabis users, but not moderate users, were significant faster to approach cannabis images compared to neutral images, using the SRC task. Conclusion Seen the observed difference in cognitive biases towards cannabis stimuli between moderate and heavy cannabis users, this study supports the allegation that cognitive biases towards cannabis stimuli may be an important marker of problematic cannabis use...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{gives some}} methods for {{evaluating}} statistical data via a model selection and shows some {{applications of the}} methods. Especially, plant ecological and worm ethological data with spatial information are treated. Characteristic problems arising in each data are shown through the data analysis of explanatory variables in base models. 　　Firstly, the problem of selecting topographical attribute as the explanatory variable is discussed through contingency table statistics. As an example, an analysis of observed data about relative altitudes and about distribution of moss is shown. In order to consider the relationship between topography and distribution of plants, data of altitude and mosses in study plots in continental Antarctica were collected by the present author {{when he had a}} chance to visit there. The altitude data was processed as an explanatory variable of model about the existence of moss. As one of the important topographical attributes that are calculated from altitude data, the relief from standard surface was adopted. Under the assumption that the probability of moss existence is proportional to the value of residuals from standard surface, the strength of relationship between topography and moss distribution was obtained by using 2 X 2 contingency table statistics. It suggested that a simpler standard surface had a better ability, than an adjusted standard surface, of determining topographical attribute which strongly related to the moss existence. Then, the standard surface estimated by robust methods presented in this paper had a little better ability than by a prevailing least-square method. Totally, the accurate regression methods were overfitting as a method of determining the standard surface. 　　Secondly, a modeling with spatial information is treated. The problem of selecting a model is discussed through linear models and linear mixed models. As examples, the analyses of the distribution of dwarf pine in mixed forest and of the moving track of nematode are shown. In the analysis of dwarf pine, data of forest study was collected in central Kamchatka by the research group in which the present author has participated. There, the size of stem diameter at the base of the lowest live branch of dwarf pine individuals and their distance from canopy trees were used for parameters of growth models. Consequently, as in many previous works of growth model about canopy trees, an adequateness of using the inverse of distance in competitive effect terms was shown. In the analysis of nematode, data collected by an automatic tracking system of the center of gravity about the individuals at an experiment of learning action to detestable odorant for nematode was used. The <b>avoidance</b> <b>action</b> of nematode from the odorant was explained by the factors involving time and coordinate. In the detestable odorant (2 -nonanone) exposed condition, the selected linear model retained the term of distance with positive coefficient and did not retain the term of time. On the other hand, the selected linear mixed models retained the terms of time with positive coefficient and the distance with negative coefficient in selected models about <b>avoidance</b> <b>action.</b> However, in the solvent (ethyl alcohol) exposed condition, different variable selection rules lead quite different results in linear mixed models and stable interpretation cannot be done. As a result of model selection, it is shown that the linear mixed models have substantially better reproduction ability of moving track than the other models. 　　　In summary, by applying statistical methods and models presented in this thesis, it is shown that many significant results in ecology and ethology are derived which are useful and suggestive in respective scientific fields...|$|E

40|$|Background: Prior {{cognitive}} {{research in}} PTSD {{has focused on}} automatic responses to negative affective stimuli, including attentional facilitation or disengagement and <b>avoidance</b> <b>action</b> tendencies. More recent research suggests PTSD may also relate to differences in reward processing, which has lead to theories of PTSD relating to approach-avoidance imbalances. The current pilot study assessed how combat-PTSD symptoms relate to automatic behavioral tendencies to {{both positive and negative}} affective stimuli. Method: Twenty male combat veterans completed the Approach-Avoidance Task (AAT), Clinician Administered PTSD Scale, Beck Depression Inventory-II, and State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory-II. During the AAT, subjects pulled (approach) or pushed (avoid) a joystick in response to neutral, happy, disgust, and angry faces based on border color. Bias scores were calculated for each emotion type (avoid-approach response latency differences). Main and interaction effects for psychological symptom severity and emotion type on bias score were assessed using linear mixed models. Results: There was a significant interaction between PTSD symptoms and emotion type, driven primarily by worse symptoms relating to a greater bias to avoid happy faces. Post-hoc tests revealed that veterans with worse PTSD symptoms were slower to approach as well as quicker to avoid happy faces. Neither depressive nor anger symptoms related to avoid or approach tendencies of emotional stimuli. Conclusion: PTSD severity was associated with a bias for avoiding positive affective stimuli. These results provide further evidence that PTSD may relate to aberrant processing of positively valenced, or rewarding stimuli. Implicit responses to rewarding stimuli could be an important factor in PTSD pathology and treatment. Specifically, these findings have implications for recent endeavors in using computer-based interventions to influence automatic approach-avoidance tendencies...|$|E
40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Research on robust Pre-Collision Systems (PCS) {{requires}} {{new techniques}} {{that will allow}} {{a better understanding of}} the vehicle-pedestrian dynamic relationship, and which can predict pedestrian future movements. Our research analyzed videos from the Transportation Active Safety Institute (TASI) 110 -Car naturalistic driving dataset to extract two dynamic pedestrian semantic features. The dataset consists of videos recorded with forward facing cameras from 110 cars over a year in all weather and illumination conditions. This research focuses on the potential-conflict situations where a collision may happen if no <b>avoidance</b> <b>action</b> is taken from driver or pedestrian. We have used 1000 such 15 seconds videos to find vehicle-pedestrian relative dynamic trajectories and pose of pedestrians. Adaptive structural local appearance model and particle filter methods have been implemented and modified to track the pedestrians more accurately. We have developed new algorithm to compute Focus of Expansion (FoE) automatically. Automatically detected FoE height data have a correlation of 0. 98 with the carefully clicked human data. We have obtained correct tractography results for over 82 % of the videos. For pose estimation, we have used flexible mixture model for capturing co-occurrence between pedestrian body segments. Based on existing single-frame human pose estimation model, we have introduced Kalman filtering and temporal movement reduction techniques to make stable stick-figure videos of the pedestrian dynamic motion. We were able to reduce frame to frame pixel offset by 86 % compared to the single frame method. These tractographs and pose estimation data were used as features to train a neural network for classifying ‘potential conflict’ and ‘no potential conflict’ situations. The training of the network achieved 91. 2 % true label accuracy, and 8. 8 % false level accuracy. Finally, the trained network was used to assess the probability of collision over time for the 15 seconds videos which generates a spike when there is a ‘potential conflict’ situation. We have also tested our method with TASI mannequin crash data. With the crash data we were able to get a danger spike for 70 % of the videos. The research enables new analysis on potential-conflict pedestrian cases with 2 D tractography data and stick-figure pose representation of pedestrians, which provides significant insight on the vehicle-pedestrian dynamics that are critical for safe autonomous driving and transportation safety innovations...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{is concerned with}} a real-time control system of trajectory tracking and obstacle avoidance using an avoidance manipulability measure for redundant manipulators. To perform predetermined end-effector trajectory-tracking task adaptively without path-planning for avoidance, information on the local environment is naturally restricted by limited recognition time. This means adaptive configuration control has to manage its shape in real-time and without adequate information on its surroundings. Therefore, when the manipulator executes atask adaptively in a dynamic environment, its avoidance manipulability should always be kept as high as possible to prepare for sudden <b>avoidance</b> <b>action.</b> As a measure to gauge the avoidance manipulability based on non-collision, we firstly propose a new index,"AMSIP". By combining a concept of "preview control" with real-time optimization of AMSIP distribution found by " 1 -step GA", we propose a new real-time configuration control method, with future information being referred locally but effectively. The proposed system {{has been shown that}} it is feasible and practical by simulations in terms of real-time configuration optimization. 	 Avoidance manipulability is a new important concept in this research, which is inspired from manipulability. The manipulability represents the ability to generate velocity at the tip of each link without any designated end-effector task. The avoidance manipulability represents the shape-changeability (avoidance ability) of intermediate links when a prior end-effector task is given. Here, the intermediate links denote the all links of the redundant manipulator except the top link with the end-effector since the top link is used to excute the prior task. The avoidance matrix, ^ 1 M_i(i= 1,・・・,n- 1), is used for analyzing avoidance manipulability of the i-th intermediate link, rank(^ 1 M_i) indicates the shape-changeable space expansion and the singular values of ^ 1 M_i indicate the avoidance ability in the typical direction in the shape-changeable space. As the most essential condition to devise the robot's configuration controller that can always keep the avoidance manipulability high and to build the framework discussing shape-changeability under the prior end-effector task, we analyze what assumption guarantees mathematically the sustainability of the shape-changeable space, that is rank(^ 1 M_i). Then we prove that "Non-Singular Configuration Assumptions" we presented can assure rank(^ 1 M_i) through detailed decomposition analysis of ^ 1 M_i. Non-Singular Configuration Assumptions have not been integrated into our current configuration control system, but they have an ability for presenting yardstick to maintain the sustainability of avoidance space expansion...|$|E
40|$|In five studies, we {{examined}} the effects on cognitive performance of coherence and incoherence between conceptual and experiential sources of affective information. The studies crossed the priming of happy and sad concepts with affective experiences. In different experiments, these included: approach or <b>avoidance</b> <b>actions,</b> happy or sad feelings, and happy or sad expressive behaviors. In all studies, coherence between affective concepts and affective experiences led to better recall of a story than affective incoherence. We suggested {{that the experience of}} such experiential affective cues serves as evidence of the appropriateness of affective concepts that come to mind. The results suggest that affective coherence has epistemic benefits, and that incoherence is costly, for cognitive performance...|$|R
40|$|The postal {{or group}} {{questionnaire}} {{survey was conducted}} to inquire into the cause of collision between fishing vessel and non-fishing vessel targeting fishing vessel personnel(FVP), non-NFVP and a person involved in a marine accident. As a result, we could verify {{the root cause of}} collision, a negligence of lookout which noted overwork for FVP and careless for non-FVP. The cause of collision by inappropriate avoid action was poor communications for FVP and non-FVP. To reduce collision, we need to be trained to take a sharp lookout, a radio communication by VHF and the collision <b>avoidance</b> <b>actions</b> by early and substantial action to keep well clear. The results are expected to contribute fo...|$|R
