5|$|I believe few plays {{have ever}} adventured {{into the world}} under greater {{disadvantage}} than this. First, as it succeeded a comedy which, for the continued space of twenty-eight nights, received as great (and as just) applauses, as ever were bestowed on the English Theatre. And secondly, as it is co-temporary with an entertainment which engrosses the whole talk <b>and</b> <b>admiration</b> of the town.|$|E
5|$|In the {{previous}} year, the Russian Public Opinion Research Center {{found out that}} 56% of Russians felt pride <b>and</b> <b>admiration</b> at the anthem, even though only 40% (up from 19% in 2004) knew the first words of the anthem. It was also noted in the survey that the younger generation was the most familiar with the words.|$|E

5|$|Dave Guard and Bob Shane {{had been}} friends since junior high school at the Punahou School in Honolulu, Hawaii where both had learned to play ukulele in {{required}} music classes. They had developed an interest in <b>and</b> <b>admiration</b> for native Hawaiian slack key guitarists like Gabby Pahinui. While in Punahou's secondary school, Shane taught first himself and then Guard the rudiments of the six-string guitar, and the two began performing at parties and in school shows doing {{an eclectic mix of}} Tahitian, Hawaiian, and calypso songs.|$|E

5|$|Inheriting an Empire on {{the verge}} of disintegration, PedroII turned Portuguese-speaking Brazil into an {{emerging}} power in the international arena. The nation grew to be distinguished from its Hispanic neighbors on account of its political stability, zealously guarded freedom of speech, respect for civil rights, vibrant economic growth and especially for its form of government: a functional, representative parliamentary monarchy. Brazil was also victorious in three international conflicts (the Platine War, the Uruguayan War and the Paraguayan War) under his rule, as well as prevailing in several other international disputes and domestic tensions. PedroII steadfastly pushed through the abolition of slavery despite opposition from powerful political and economic interests. A savant in his own right, the Emperor established a reputation as a vigorous sponsor of learning, culture and the sciences. He won the respect <b>and</b> <b>admiration</b> of scholars such as Charles Darwin, Victor Hugo and Friedrich Nietzsche, and was a friend to Richard Wagner, Louis Pasteur and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, among others.|$|E

Savina executed carvings from Corbusier's drawings.|$|R
30|$|<b>Admiration</b> <b>and</b> adoration further {{should be}} discriminable from other {{positive}} emotions by their distinct {{relations with other}} positive <b>and</b> negative emotions. <b>Admiration</b> <b>and</b> adoration were hypothesized to show no or even positive rather than negative associations with sadness, fear, shame, and envy (Hypothesis 4). Dispositional envy further was predicted to relate positively to admiration but not or negatively to adoration (Hypothesis 5).|$|R
5|$|The {{education}} of Pedro II began {{while he was}} still heir to throne, and he learned to read and write in Portuguese at age five. His first tutors were Mariana de Verna and Friar Antonio de Arrábida. When he became Emperor he already had several professors. Amongst these were Félix Taunay (father of Alfredo d'Escragnolle Taunay) and Luís Alves de Lima e Silva (son of the regent Francisco de Lima e Silva), who taught French and Fencing respectively, and towards both of whom he developed lifelong friendship <b>and</b> <b>admiration.</b> Pedro II passed the entire day studying with only two hours reserved for amusements. He would wake up at 6.30a.m. and begin studies at seven, continuing until 10p.m., after which he would go to bed. The disciplines were diverse, including everything from languages, history, philosophy, astronomy, physics, geography and music, to hunting, equestrianism and fencing.|$|E
5|$|Increasing {{economic}} success allowed Busch to visit Wiedensahl more frequently. Busch {{had decided to}} leave Munich, as only few relatives lived there, and the artists' association was temporarily disbanded. In June 1867 Busch met his brother Otto for the first time, in Frankfurt. Otto {{was working as a}} tutor to the family of a wealthy banker and industrialist, Kessler. Busch became friends with Kessler's wife, Johanna, a mother of seven and an influential art and music patron of Frankfurt. She regularly opened salons at her villa, frequented by artists, musicians and philosophers. She believed Busch to be a great painter, a view supported by Anton Burger, a leading painter of the Kronberger Malerkolonie, the Kronberg-based group of painters. While his humorous drawings did not appeal to her, she supported his painting career. At first she established an apartment and studio for Busch in her villa, later providing him with an apartment nearby. Motivated by Kessler's support <b>and</b> <b>admiration,</b> and introduction to the cultural life of Frankfurt, the 'Frankfurter Years' were the most artistically productive for Busch. At this time he and Otto discovered the philosophical works of Arthur Schopenhauer.|$|E
5|$|Nelson, the Hamiltons {{and several}} other British {{travellers}} left Leghorn for Florence on 13 July. They made stops at Trieste and Vienna, spending three weeks in the latter where they were entertained by the local nobility and heard the Missa in Angustiis by Haydn that now bears Nelson's name. By September they were in Prague, and later called at Dresden, Dessau and Hamburg, from where they caught a packet ship to Great Yarmouth, arriving on 6 November. Nelson was given a hero's welcome and after being sworn in as a freeman of the borough and received the massed crowd's applause. He subsequently {{made his way to}} London, arriving on 9 November. He attended court and was guest of honour at a number of banquets and balls. It was during this period that Fanny Nelson and Emma Hamilton met for the first time. During this period, Nelson was reported as being cold and distant to his wife and his attention to Emma became the subject of gossip. With the marriage breaking down, Nelson began to hate even being in the same room as Fanny. Events came to a head around Christmas, when according to Nelson's solicitor, Fanny issued an ultimatum on whether he was to choose her or Emma. Nelson replied: I love you sincerely but I cannot forget my obligations to Lady Hamilton or speak of her otherwise than with affection <b>and</b> <b>admiration.</b> The two never lived together again after this.|$|E
30|$|Wea {{conducted}} {{the present research}} to fill this gap in the literature. Specifically, we examined whether <b>and</b> how dispositional <b>admiration</b> <b>and</b> adoration were related to well-being. To accomplish this, we first needed to gain more insight into <b>admiration</b> <b>and</b> what has variously been labeled adoration, reverence, worship, or veneration (I will use the term adoration to denote the core meaning of this word cluster). There are rather few psychological publications considering these emotions (but see Algoe and Haidt [2009]; de Rivera [1977]; Haidt [2003 a], [b]; McDougall [1921]; Ortony, Clore, and Collins [1988]; Plutchik [1980]; Smith [2000]; van de Ven, Zeelenberg, and Pieters [2011], [2012]). Therefore, Schindler, Zink, Windrich, and Menninghaus ([2013]) have provided a theoretical account {{of the characteristics of}} <b>and</b> differences between <b>admiration</b> <b>and</b> adoration, which I will introduce in the next section. Based on Schindler et al. ([2013]), we developed a questionnaire assessing dispositional <b>admiration</b> <b>and</b> adoration to elucidate associations of the two emotions with well-being. As a prerequisite for addressing this link, I will first present evidence supporting {{the reliability and validity of}} the new measure. Subsequently, I will uncover how <b>admiration</b> <b>and</b> adoration are related to well-being indicators.|$|R

5|$|Through such episodes as the {{deception}} of Derby at Gloucester, Edward acquired {{a reputation as}} untrustworthy. During the summer campaign, though, he began to learn from his mistakes, and acted {{in a way that}} gained the respect <b>and</b> <b>admiration</b> of his contemporaries. The war did not end with Montfort's death, and Edward participated in the continued campaigning. At Christmas, he came to terms with the younger Simon de Montfort and his associates at the Isle of Axholme in Lincolnshire, and in March he led a successful assault on the Cinque Ports. A contingent of rebels held out in the virtually impregnable Kenilworth Castle and did not surrender until the drafting of the conciliatory Dictum of Kenilworth. In April it seemed as if Gloucester would take up the cause of the reform movement, and civil war would resume, but after a renegotiation of the terms of the Dictum of Kenilworth, the parties came to an agreement. Edward, however, was little involved in the settlement negotiations following the wars; at this point his main focus was on planning his forthcoming crusade.|$|E

30|$|However, if <b>admiration</b> <b>and</b> adoration {{also were}} related to {{negative}} affect, this may undermine positive associations with life satisfaction.
