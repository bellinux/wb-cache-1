50|$|Modification of {{the scheme}} {{that was done}} for ateviridine q.v. by {{performing}} the reductive alkylation with acetone gives 2 after removal of the protecting group. Acylation of this amine with the imidazolide from 5-Methylsulfonaminoindole-2-carboxylic acid (1) affords the amide, reverse transcriptase inhibitor, <b>atevirdine.</b>|$|E
50|$|Preparation of the pyridylpiperazine moiety starts by {{aromatic}} {{displacement of}} chlorine from 2-Chloro-3-nitropyridine by piperazine to give 3. The secondary amine is then protected as its BOC derivative by reaction with Di-tert-butyl dicarbonate (Boc anhydride) to give 4. The nitro group is then reduced by catalytic hydrogenation. Reductive alkylation with acetaldehyde {{in the presence}} of lithium cyanoborohydride gives the corresponding N-ethyl derivative. The protecting group is then removed by reaction with TFA. Reaaction of the resulting amine with the imidazolide derivative of 5-Methoxy-3-indoleacetic acid affords the amide reverse transcriptase inhibitor, <b>atevirdine.</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Atevirdine</b> is a nonnucleoside reverse {{transcriptase}} inhibitor with in vitro activity against {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 and is currently in phase II clinical trials. <b>Atevirdine</b> is most soluble at a pH of < 2, and therefore, normal gastric acidity is most likely necessary for optimal bioavailability. Because of the rapid development of resistance in vitro, <b>atevirdine</b> is being evaluated in combination with didanosine and/or zidovudine in both two- and three-drug combination regimens. To examine the influence of concurrent didanosine (buffered tablet formulation) on the disposition of <b>atevirdine,</b> 12 human immunodeficiency virus type 1 -infected subjects (mean CD 4 + cell count, 199 cells per mm 3; range, 13 to 447 cells/mm 3) participated in a three-way, partially randomized, crossover, single-dose study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of didanosine and <b>atevirdine</b> when each drug was given alone (treatments A and B, respectively) versus concurrently (treatment C). Concurrent administration of didanosine and <b>atevirdine</b> significantly reduced the maximum concentration of <b>atevirdine</b> in serum from 3. 45 +/- 2. 8 to 0. 854 +/- 0. 33 microM (P = 0. 004). Likewise, the mean <b>atevirdine</b> area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h after administration of the combination was reduced to 6. 47 +/- 2. 2 microM. h (P = 0. 004) relative to a value of 11. 3 +/- 4. 8 microM. h for <b>atevirdine</b> alone. <b>Atevirdine</b> had no statistically {{significant effect on the}} pharmacokinetic parameters of didanosine. Concurrent administration of single doses of <b>atevirdine</b> and didanosine resulted in a markedly lower maximum concentration of <b>atevirdine</b> in serum and area under the concentration-time curve, with a minimal effect on the disposition of didanosine. It is unknown whether an interaction of similar magnitude would occur under steady-state conditions; thus, combination regimens which include both <b>atevirdine</b> and didanosine should be designed so that their administration times are separated. Since the duration of the buffering effect of didanosine formulations is unknown, <b>atevirdine</b> should be given prior to didanosine...|$|E
40|$|<b>Atevirdine</b> is a nonnucleoside reverse {{transcriptase}} inhibitor of {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1). In this study we investigated the effect of <b>atevirdine</b> in asymptomatic antiretroviral naive HIV-infected patients with CD 4 (+) cell counts of between 200 and 750 cells per mm(3). Patients were randomized to receive 600 mg of <b>atevirdine</b> (n = 15) or a placebo (n = 15) {{three times a day}} for 12 weeks. There was no statistically significant effect of <b>atevirdine</b> on viral loads (HIV p 24 antigen and HIV- 1 RNA levels by PCR) or CD 4 (+) cell counts. The data do not support the use of <b>atevirdine</b> as a monotherapy in the treatment of HIV-infected patients...|$|E
40|$|The bisheteroarylpiperazine nonnucleoside reverse {{transcriptase}} (RT) inhibitor <b>atevirdine</b> ef-fectively inhibits {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV-I) in vitro. Clinical isolates {{with a wide range}} of 50 % inhibitory concentrations (ICsos) of zidovudine (ICso, 0. 003 to> 2. 0 #J,M) and didanosine (ICso, 0. 02 to> 10. 0 #J,M) were inhibited by <b>atevirdine</b> (median ICso, 0. 74 ""M; range, 0. 06 - 1. 60). Cross-resistance to <b>atevirdine</b> in zidovudine- or didanosine-resistant isolates was not observed. Combinations ofatevirdine and zidovudine were highly synergistic against zidovudine-resistant clinical isolates of HIV-I. By contrast, these combinations were mostly additive when tested against zidovudine-susceptible isolates. Combinations of <b>atevirdine</b> and didanosine were additive in their effects against both didanosine-susceptible and-resistant isolates. These data suggest that the interaction of <b>atevirdine</b> with HIV-I RT is different than that of other nonnu-cleoside RT inhibitors and that combinations of <b>atevirdine</b> and zidovudine may be useful in patients with AIDS who have initially received monotherapy with zidovudine. Effective therapy of human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-I) infection to date has relied on inhibition of{{reverse transcriptase}} (RT) by nucleoside analogues such as zidovu...|$|E
40|$|<b>Atevirdine</b> mesylate (U- 87201 E) {{is a new}} nonnucleoside (bisheteroarylpiperazine) {{inhibitor}} {{of human}} immunodeficiency virus type 1 reverse transcriptase. In a double-blind, escalating single-dose study the safety, tolerance, and pharmacokinetics of <b>atevirdine</b> mesylate were investigated in 24 asymptomatic human immunodeficiency virus-seropositive male patients. Each patient received one single oral dose of <b>atevirdine</b> mesylate and placebo separated by an interval of 1 to 3 weeks. For each dose level (400, 800, 1, 200, and 1, 600 mg) six patients received drug and placebo on separate occasions. Blood samples were collected before dosing and at intervals afterward for safety evaluation and estimation of <b>atevirdine</b> and metabolite levels. The concentrations of <b>atevirdine</b> and its principal metabolite (U- 89255) in serum were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. The {{results of the study}} showed that <b>atevirdine</b> mesylate is well tolerated at all dose levels. No clinically significant effects on vital signs, electrocardiograms, or laboratory tests were observed. Occasional headache and nausea were reported both in the drug group and in the placebo group. The times to peak values were relatively short (0. 5 to 1. 0 h), suggesting a rapid absorption. The maximum concentrations of drug in serum were 1. 4 microM (400 mg), 4. 2 microM (800 mg), 7. 3 microM (1, 200 mg), and 5. 8 microM (1, 600 mg). The values of the pharmacokinetic parameters for <b>atevirdine</b> were found to have relatively large intersubject variabilities, and consequently, the study had little power to detect dose-dependent changes in the values of the pharmacokinetic parameters. The oral clearance of <b>atevirdine</b> tended to increase by 90 % as the <b>atevirdine</b> mesylate doses increased from 400 to 1, 600 mg, but this change in oral clearance was not statistically significant. The values of the pharmacokinetic parameters determined in the study were similar to those found in a previous single-dose study in healthy volunteers...|$|E
