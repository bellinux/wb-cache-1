2500|$|There are no legally {{recognized}} inherited grazing rights, preemptive rights, special rights, or grandfathered public-domain land-use rights {{held by the}} Bundy {{family or}} Bundy's ancestors. Bundy lost his special-rights arguments in the United States v. Bundy cases. Bundy had only base property and normal AUM grazing-allotment permits, like the permits {{of thousands of other}} ranchers throughout the western United States. The court found that Bundy and his father actually first began grazing their cattle on the Bunkerville Allotment in 1954 and used it for several years. They paid for cattle grazing again from 1973 until 1993, when Bundy paid the last fees for his final grazing application for the period from December 1, 1992, through February 28, 1993. On January 24, 1994, the Bureau of Land Management delivered a Proposed Decision Order to Remove and Demand for Payment to Bundy by placing it on the dashboard of Bundy's vehicle {{while he was in the}} vehicle. BLM officials allege that Bundy became agitated, descended from his truck and accused the BLM of harassing him. He then returned to his truck, threw the proposed order out of the window and drove away. One of Bundy's sons then picked up the document, tore it to pieces and threw it on the ground. On February 17, 1994, the BLM issued a final decision canceling Bundy's range-grazing permit. Bundy subsequently informed the BLM in several <b>administrative</b> <b>notices</b> that he intended to graze cattle [...] "pursuant to my vested grazing rights". Bundy failed to demonstrate the existence of any such special rights when given an opportunity to do so in court.|$|E

40|$|The Social Security Administration’s (SSA’s) {{disability}} benefit programs {{utilize the}} largest adjudicative {{system in the}} western world. Yale Law Professor Jerry Mashaw’s two comprehensive studies of the SSA’s processes yielded a theory of bureaucratic rationality to advance accuracy, consistency, and baseline fairness through hierarchical adherence to centrally-formulated rules in “mass justice” SSA adjudication. SSA adopted its “grid” regulations in furtherance of Mashaw’s thesis to systematize the process of determining disability claimants’ abilities to adjust to other work. In 1983, the Supreme Court sustained SSA’s grid in Heckler v. Campbell, an opinion administrative law scholars identify {{as one of the}} most influential in administrative law. While elucidating the principles supporting agencies’ authority to resolve some factual issues in advance of case-by-case adjudication through rulemaking and rigid decisional rules, notwithstanding the statutory requirement of individualized decisionmaking, the Campbell Court relied in part on the presence of gaps in the grid—exceptions requiring more flexible and individualized adjudicative treatment. This includes a common exception for claimants with non-exertional limitations. However, SSA’s ad hoc, adjudicative methodology where grid exceptions are present has undermined the consistency and bureaucratic rationality the grid system was intended to ensure, sanctioned discriminatory and disadvantaged treatment of claimants with non-exertional impairments and limitations, and deeply divided the circuits. Courts and agency adjudicators differ within and among themselves on such fundamental questions as: (1) What is the proper methodology for using the grid’s administratively-noticed occupational and job bases as a framework or guide on work adjustment questions in grid exception cases and whether such methodology is applicable when additional vocational or labor market evidence is procured?; and (2) Under what circumstances may adjudicators deny a claim without additional vocational or labor market evidence by presuming or taking <b>administrative</b> <b>notice</b> of the lack of sufficient diminution or erosion of the grid’s job bases due to the presence of considerations not factored into the grid’s promulgation, such as non-exertional limitations? This Article develops approaches for resolving both of these major grid “gap” issues. First, it argues that courts should compel SSA to utilize interpretive guidance on the proper use of the grid’s adjudicative framework in work adjustment assessments. This entails interpreting that guidance to mandate use of the grid’s occupational and job base numbers—not ad hoc, adjudicative gestalt—as the proper measure of the “significant” quantum of performable jobs below which a claimant is deemed unable to make a sufficient work adjustment in grid exception cases. This would ensure greater fairness, consistency, and nondiscriminatory treatment of similarly situated claimants and give proper effect to statutory vocational factors. Second, this Article advocates that the Supreme Court compel compliance with settled <b>administrative</b> <b>notice</b> doctrine to ensure procedural fairness and prevent standardless intuitive decisionmaking. At a minimum, this would require constraining adjudicators from taking unrebuttable <b>administrative</b> <b>notice</b> that the grid’s job bases have not been significantly eroded by the presence of non-trivial, non-exertional limitations in making work adjustment assessments...|$|R

40|$|This article {{addresses}} the {{concern over the}} state of deportation proceedings in the United States. Professor Kidane argues {{that a lack of}} formal rules of procedure and evidence is the main factor contributing to the unpredictability, and inconsistency inherent in our system of immigration law. The argument is placed in context by reviewing the growth of the administrative agencies up through the adoption of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). Kidane notes that the APA embodies one approach as a compromise between those advocating strict formal rules of procedure and evidence and those supporting a more relaxed system for administrative proceedings. However, Professor Kidane continues by stating that the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) effectively made many of the evidentiary and procedural provisions of the APA inapplicable to immigration proceedings. Kidane argues that, by adopting more relaxed evidentiary standards and informal procedural rules, the INA violates basic principles of due process and fundamental fairness; resulting in a system that lacks uniformity and integrity. After reviewing the main problems inherent in the INA 2 ̆ 7 s lax evidentiary standards, such as free admission of hearsay and <b>administrative</b> <b>notice</b> of adjudicative facts, Professor Kidane argues that important lessons could be learned from the more formal system of evidentiary and procedural rules adopted by the Department of Labor (DOL). By noting the similarity between DOL proceedings and deportation proceedings, Kidane draws the conclusion that the DOL provisions would make a good substitute for the rules currently in place in the immigration arena. Professor Kidane concludes by arguing that these formal rules must be adopted for deportation proceedings in order to restore integrity and predictability to the system...|$|R

40|$|Job {{protection}} {{has often}} been blamed {{as a source of}} the poor employment performance of many European countries. Since the beginning of the 90 s, much attention has been devoted to the theoretical and the empirical analysis of the consequences of labor market regulation on labor market performance. In this paper, we summarize these results by considering three main indicators of job protection: <b>administrative</b> firing costs, <b>notice</b> periods and short-term contracts. We study the effects of job protection policies thanks to an equilibrium matching model calibrated on the French labor market. Our results suggest that administrative firing costs and notice periods have no significant effect on the unemployment rate. However these instruments profoundly modify the composition of unemployment as well as labor market dynamics. Ultimately, we consider the potential employment protection effect of an US based experience rated scheme on the French labor market.

30|$|The {{majority}} of the people interviewed suggest {{that there has been a}} shift from mass and adakar raids to smaller but more frequent raids. This perception is reflected in the data as the average number of raiders per raid in Turkana decreased from 48 raiders in 2006 to 28 raiders in 2009 (TUPADO 2011). The shift is likely to be the result of two developments: (1) improved communication infrastructure which reduces the attractiveness of mid- and larger-sized raids and (2) commercialisation which increases the attractiveness of smaller raids. The improved coverage of mobile phone networks, especially in Pokot, significantly increases the chances of the targeted community and <b>administrative</b> authorities to <b>notice</b> and prepare for the planned raid. This in turn decreases the motivation of raiders to participate in a raid as the risk of getting shot by the targeted community or arrested by the administrative authorities is increased. Additionally, the required capability of mid- and larger-sized raids is high. Not only does a community have to organise and coordinate a larger number of participants, it also has to know where and when a significant herd can be found and attacked. Smaller raids, in contrast, require a shorter organisation period and hence attract less attention. Here, the risk of getting arrested is smaller. The motivation of raiders to engage in smaller raids is further increased by the development of commercialisation. Krätli and Swift (2003) define commercialisation as ‘an aspect of the wider integration of pastoralists within a market economy’. This form of raiding is undertaken with the explicit intention of selling livestock for immediate profit instead of restocking own herds (Mkutu 2010). Commercialised raiding is facilitated by improved access to markets, rising demand for meat as part of strong growth of urban populations and improved road infrastructure reaching pastoral regions (Eaton 2010).|$|R

The matter was both important and controversial. HHS nonetheless announced its policy on essential health benefits by posting on its website a 13 -page bulletin stating that it would allow each state to define essential benefits for itself by choosing a “benchmark” plan modeled on existing plans in the state. On both substance and procedure, the move was surprising. The benchmark approach departed from the uniform, federal standard that the statute appears to anticipate and that many informed observers expected HHS to adopt.

Although HHS may have brushed up against the limits of its discretionary authority, we conclude that the approach likely will (and, in our view, should) be upheld in the event of a challenge. Second, did HHS’s announcement of the benchmark approach through an internet bulletin allow the agency to avoid the very administrative procedures that typically serve to constrain the exercise of agency discretion? The answer here is a flat no. The agency’s adroit use of guidance documents instead resulted in a process that was more open to public scrutiny and external oversight than conventional rulemaking would have been...|$|R
40|$|Looking at Swiss {{administrative}} law from a Quebec perspective, this paper outlines {{some aspects of}} the Swiss system that provide useful models or references for the discussion and resolution of current issues in Canadian and Quebec {{administrative law}}. These issues are identified as (1) the proliferation of independent administrative agencies, and the means to control or at least systematize the growth of such structures ; (2) the desirability and feasibility of enacting general standards of procedure for administrative action ; (3) the simplification of remedies in the field of judicial review of administrative action ; (4) the desirability and feasibility of allocating judicial review powers to a specialized court, either within or outside the Superior Court ; and (5) the desirability and form of a procedure allowing for political intervention in the decision-making process of independent agencies. In the light of these issues, the paper describes the allocation of review functions between administrative and judicial bodies in Swiss federal law. The structure and activity of the Swiss Federal Court (Tribunal fédéral), and especially of the division of the Court that deals with most administrative law cases, are outlined in some more detail. A short historical sketch leads to a discussion of the corresponding features of the law in some of the cantons, and to consideration of the special position given to social security matters in the general scheme of administrative law. The paper then focusses on administrative action itself, commenting on the most significant provisions in the Federal Administrative Procedure Act (Loi fédérale sur la procédure administrative) of 1968. Special attention is paid to the process of review within the administration, up {{to the level of the}} federal cabinet (Conseil fédéral). Corresponding provisions in the law of some of the cantons are also briefly discussed. The description of the federal review process is then completed by an outline of the procedure for judicial review of administrative action by the Federal Court (Recours de droit <b>administrative).</b> Finally, <b>notice</b> is again taken of the special position of social security as regards administrative procedure. The paper draws attention, in its concluding part, to the most interesting insights provided by Swiss law into the current problems of Canadian and Quebec administrative law. The growth of administrative tribunals has been brought under control by structural arrangements, especially in the field of social security. The introduction of general standards of procedure has brought greater uniformity and clarity, has emphasized the unity of administrative process including the review phase before administrative or judicial authorities, and has strenghtened the rule of law over government action. The existence of a single procedure to invoke judicial review eases access to the court. While in many cases review by the court is excluded, these exclusions have to be specific, and leave full opportunity for review within the administration, with adequate safeguards provided by the Administrative Procedure Act. Specialization occurs within the Federal Court, and does not involve a rigid separation between judges applying administrative law and judges applying other branches of the law, as in France or Germany. Finally, ultimate political control over certain types of decisions is admitted as a part of life in Swiss federal law, but is at the same time subjected to a quasi-judicial procedure which makes it an acknowledged source of administrative justice...|$|R
40|$|This article empirically {{examines}} democratic {{participation in}} three different regulatory proceedings, involving financial privacy, nuclear regulation, and campaign finance. It then uses that analysis to critique [...] and suggest alternatives to [...] existing mechanisms to achieve public participation in the regulatory state. The current mechanism for structuring public participation in regulatory decisions (or “regulatory democracy”) relies on demand-driven procedures like the <b>Administrative</b> Procedure Act’s <b>notice</b> and comment process. Organized interests and others who decide they have sufficient resources and interest to do so comment on regulations. While some observers consider this process close to ideal, others instead seem to accept the current approach only because {{it appears to be}} a reasonable compromise adequate for an imperfect world. Under this “compromise acceptance” view, current procedures seem easier to accept in light of certain empirical suppositions, such as that regulatory problems can be resolved through application of technical, scientific expertise, that individual members of the public tend to lack interest in participating in regulatory policymaking, and that even if they had such interest, they would add little to a process already informed by the views of organized interests. Drawing on an empirical analysis of thousands of public comments in these three regulations, as well as a rich empirical literature in political behavior, I show many of these suppositions to be questionable. (1) Comments from individual members of the public make up a substantial proportion of total comments about some regulations, showing at least some potential public demand for participation. (2) Dramatic differences exist in the sophistication of comments from organized interests and those of individual members of the public. (3) That deficit in sophistication independently affects the probability an agency will accept suggestions in public comments even when controlling for differences in commenter identity. (4) Interest groups do not always raise the range of concerns raised by comments from the lay public. (5) The larger public’s interest in a particular regulation and sophistication to take part in discussing it are both themselves shaped by the process used to consult that public. All this hints at a rich set of possibilities for alternative institutional designs to achieve regulatory democracy. I discuss two such approaches here. Both involve constituting a small group of people whose discussions can inform the regulatory process, and appointing a lawyer to serve as a “regulatory public defender” responsible for articulating their views to the agency. Participants can be either selected by lot from the entire population (a majoritarian deliberation approach), or chosen from among constituencies (such as outside experts) who may be especially impacted by the regulation but are essentially unrepresented (a corrective approach). Given that neither the public’s sophistication nor its interest in an issue are fixed, the new approaches can generate valuable information about what informed citizens think of regulatory proposals. These mechanisms can provide regulators with valuable information about what makes a new law acceptable to the public. Many of the technical challenges could be solved by creating a separate agency to implement reforms in regulatory democracy, though questions arise about sampling to select participants, framing the issue, and providing representation to the views of the group. Instead, the larger challenge to the reform of regulatory democracy is a political economy that strongly [...] though not inevitably [...] favors the status quo. I close by discussing three scenarios where reform would be easier to achieve...|$|R
