2500|$|This era {{also saw}} a great {{increase}} in bowling technology. Pins had previously been set by human pinsetters or [...] "pin boys", but with {{the invention of the}} semi-automatic pinspotter in 1936 (usually just the [...] "spotting table" [...] component), the process became much easier. In 1946 AMF Bowling launched the first commercial fully automatic pinspotter, the , followed closely by the more developed 82–30 model (still in common use in the 21st century) to replace the earlier Brunswick semi-automatic and fully manual bowling establishments. Brunswick itself introduced its own [...] "Model A" [...] automatic pinspotter design to bowling centers in 1955, and its successors (A2 and [...] "JetBack", both with quicker delivery of returned balls over the Model A) are still in widespread use. The television age of the 1950s also helped to increase the popularity of ten-pin bowling, as images of the sport began to enter the homes of millions across the United States. Nationally televised programs like Jackpot Bowling <b>and</b> <b>Make</b> <b>That</b> Spare became popular on Friday nights from the late 1950s into the early 1960s. Following many years of debate over what constituted a professional bowler versus an amateur, Eddie Elias founded the Professional Bowlers Association (PBA) in 1958. The PBA's Pro Bowlers Tour became a permanent part of ABC's sports lineup by the early 1960s, airing through 1997.|$|E
