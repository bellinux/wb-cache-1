The bill was eventually defeated in the Senate on June 28, 2007, when a cloture motion failed on a 46–53 vote. Bush expressed disappointment upon the defeat of one of his signature domestic initiatives. The Bush administration later proposed a series of immigration enforcement measures that do not require a change in law.|$|E

5|$|American {{inventor}} John Wesley Hyatt {{together with}} his brother Isaiah, Hyatt patented the first injection moulding machine in 1872. This machine was relatively simple compared to machines in use today: it worked like a large hypodermic needle, using a plunger to inject plastic through <b>a</b> <b>heated</b> cylinder into a mould. The industry progressed slowly over the years, producing products such as collar stays, buttons, and hair combs.|$|E
