5|$|Influences of Western Chalukya {{architecture}} can {{be discerned}} in the geographically distant schools of <b>architecture</b> <b>of</b> the Hoysala Empire in southern Karnataka, and the Kakatiya dynasty in present-day Andhra Pradesh. Sometimes called the Gadag style of architecture, Western Chalukya architecture {{is considered a}} precursor to the Hoysala <b>architecture</b> <b>of</b> southern Karnataka. This influence occurred because the early builders employed by the Hoysalas came from pronounced centres of medieval Chalukya art. Further monuments in this style were built {{not only by the}} Western Chalukya kings but, also by their feudal vassals.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{observed}} that the <b>architecture</b> <b>of</b> government columbaria reflects the outlook of the Singaporean nation. The early columbaria were simple, with few aesthetic ornaments, just like early Singaporean housing flats. The later columbaria have more modern designs, with well-designed landscaped environments, and looking similar to contemporary HDB (Housing and Development Board) flats. These columbaria include the Chua Chu Kang Columbarium and the Mandai Columbarium, which was renovated and expanded in 2004 to accommodate approximately another 60,000 niches. The designs are more elaborate, and are often reminiscent of other structures people often encounter in everyday life. Comparisons have been drawn between the <b>architecture</b> <b>of</b> these columbaria and that of schools and condominiums, and hypotheses have been made that such are deliberate efforts to eliminate the sense of fear and dread traditionally associated with landscapes of death.|$|E

5|$|The <b>architecture</b> <b>of</b> the Seljuk Turks {{combined}} the elements {{and characteristics of}} the Turkic <b>architecture</b> <b>of</b> Central Asia with those of Persian, Arab, Armenian and Byzantine architecture. The transition from Seljuk architecture to Ottoman architecture is most visible in Bursa, which was {{the capital of the}} Ottoman State between 1335 and 1413. Following the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople (Istanbul) in 1453, Ottoman architecture was significantly influenced by Byzantine architecture. Topkapı Palace in Istanbul {{is one of the most}} famous examples of classical Ottoman architecture and was the primary residence of the Ottoman Sultans for approximately 400 years. Mimar Sinan (c.1489–1588) was the most important architect of the classical period in Ottoman architecture. He was the chief architect of at least 374 buildings which were constructed in various provinces of the Ottoman Empire in the 16th century.|$|E
5|$|The <b>architecture</b> <b>of</b> the Song dynasty (960–1279) {{was noted}} for its towering Buddhist pagodas, {{enormous}} stone and wooden bridges, lavish tombs, and extravagant palaces. Although literary works on architecture existed beforehand, architectural writing blossomed during the Song dynasty, maturing into a more professional form that described dimensions and working materials in a concise, organized manner. In addition to the examples still standing, depictions in Song artwork, architectural drawings, and illustrations in published books all aid modern historians in understanding the <b>architecture</b> <b>of</b> the period.|$|E
5|$|The <b>architecture</b> <b>of</b> {{the layer}} pyramid {{allows it to}} be {{securely}} dated to the time span between the reigns of king Sekhemkhet and that of king Snofru, {{the founder of the}} 4th Dynasty. Rainer Stadelmann, Miroslav Verner and Jean-Philippe Lauer compare the <b>architecture</b> <b>of</b> the layer pyramid with that of the step pyramids of Djoser and Sekhemkhet, expecting the layer pyramid to have originally consisted of five steps, just as its near-contemporary predecessors. The layer pyramid exhibits at one site both complex developments concerning its substructures and simplifications concerning the building methods employed for the superstructure. According to these egyptologists, the layer pyramid is a clearly advanced version of the buried pyramid of Sekhemkhet.|$|E
