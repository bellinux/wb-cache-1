Only nine of the 96 possible univariant equilibria, and two ([B,C] and [L,T,Cl]) of the 15 invariant points are calculated to be stable in the P(HzO) -T plane. The P(HzO) -T coor-dinates of invariant point [B,C] {{are determined by the}} in-tersection of the reactions L = F + T + CI + W (1) and A = F + T + W (2).

Thus, invariant point [B,C], located at P(HzO) > 25 kbars for lizardite with high-AI content (> 9. 0 wt. % Alz 03), shifts to P(HzO) 5 kbars for lizardite with intermediate-AI content (- 3. 5 wt.

40|$|Background: The {{worldwide}} {{epidemic of}} obesity {{is a major}} public health concern and is persuasively linked to the rising prevalence of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Obesity {{is often associated with}} an abnormal lipoprotein profile, which may be partly negated by pioglitazone intervention, as this can influence the composition and oxidation characteristics of low-density lipoprotein (LDL). However, as pioglitazone’s impact on these parameters within high-density lipoprotein (HDL), specifically HDL 2 & 3, is absent from the literature, this study was performed to address this shortcoming. Methods: Twenty men were randomized to placebo or pioglitazone (30 mg/day) for 12 weeks. HDL 2 & 3 were isolated by rapid-ultracentrifugation. HDL 2 & 3 -cholesterol and phospholipid content were assessed by enzymatic assays and apolipoprotein <b>AI</b> (apoAI) <b>content</b> by single-radial immunodiffusion. HDL 2 & 3 oxidation characteristics were assessed by monitoring conjugated diene production and paraoxonase- 1 activity by spectrophotometric assays. Results: Compared with the placebo group, pioglitazone influenced the composition and oxidation potential of HDL 2 & 3. Specifically, total cholesterol (P, 0. 05), phospholipid (P, 0. 001) and apoAI (P, 0. 001) were enriched within HDL 2. Furthermore, the resistance of HDL 2 & 3 to oxidation (P, 0. 05) and the activity of paroxonase- 1 were also increased (P, 0. 001). Conclusions: Overall, these findings indicate that pioglitazone treatment induced antiatherogenic changes within HDL 2 & 3, which may help reduce the incidence of premature cardiovascular disease linked with obesity.

Famitsu Weekly gave it a score of 28/40, with the four reviewers each giving a score of 7. While it praised the battle system, which was stated to be more action-oriented than previous entries, multiple points came in for criticism, including poor companion <b>AI,</b> lack of <b>content,</b> and the limited online functionality. They also thought 2D graphics {{would have been better}} than the 3D models used due to quality issues. Famitsu DS + Wii gave the game a slightly higher score of 30/40, with the reviewers giving it respective scores of 8, 7, 7 and 8. The reviewers found the story [...] "appealing", and enjoyed the increased focus on action in the battle system. Points of criticism were the map layout and leveling system. Dengeki DS Style praised the game's opening, but was mixed about the battle display and other aspects of gameplay. SoftBank Creative's magazine Gemaga also gave a mixed review, praising the opening song and battle system, but found that the condensing or removal of standard Tales gameplay elements made the game [...] "unsatisfactory" [...] when compared to its predecessors. Japanese magazine GAME SIDE, in a retrospective on the Tales series, cited the love story between Caius and Rubia as [...] "pale", faulted the story's short length, and noted that the division of displays between screens during battle put undue pressure on the player.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{attempts}} {{to give a}} high-level overview {{of the field of}} artificial and computational intelligence (AI/CI) in games, with particular reference to how the different core research areas within this field inform and interact with each other, both actually and potentially. We identify ten main research areas within this field: NPC behavior learning, search and planning, player modeling, games as <b>AI</b> benchmarks, procedural <b>content</b> generation, computational narrative, believ-able agents, AI-assisted game design, general game artificial intelligence and AI in commercial games. We view and analyze the areas from three key perspectives: (1) the dominant AI method(s) used under each area; (2) the relation of each area with respect to the end (human) user; and (3) the placement of each area within a human-computer (player-game) interaction perspective. In addition, for each of these areas we consider how it could inform or interact with each of the other areas; in those cases where we find that meaningful interaction either exists or is possible, we describe the character of that interaction and provide references to published studies, if any. We believe that this paper improves understanding of the current nature of the game AI/CI research field and the interdependences between its core areas by providing a unifying overview. We also believe that the discussion of potential interactions between research areas provides a pointer to many interesting future research projects and unexplored subfields...|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] Use of a {{discriminant}} analysis has verified and grouped three suspected varieties of kaolinite found in kaolin-rich clay strata of late Paleocene to early Eocene age across north-central Mississippi. Initial identification {{of each type}} of kaolinite was based on clay-texture characteristics observed on scanning electron micrographs and the differences in pattern configurations of X-ray diffractograms. The discriminant function used for data treatment clearly segregated and grouped each variety. The discrim-ination variables {{were found to be}} the Hinckley index and, to a lesser extent, the Si 4 + content relative to the <b>AI</b> 3 + <b>content.</b> The oldest variety is the Blue Mountain clay, composed of preserved hexagonal plates usually clustered into booklets with a vermiform texture. The Ashland variety, stratigraphically younger than the Blue Mountain clay, appears to have been derived from the erosion of the Blue Mountain clay. The Ashland cannot be recognized by any type of diagnostic texture, as it is made up of individual plates that have been corroded and abraded to the point where a hexagonal outline can no longer be recognized. The Sardis variety is the stratigraphically youngest of the three varieties and is at least a second, or possibly a third generation detrital product. The Sardis clay can be recognized by a distinct "ribbon " or "swirl" texture commonly found in ball clays. Data from this study are not sufficient for complete petrogenetic interpretation. However, speculation on possible differences in depositional environments and modes of deposition can be based on the data at hand. The Blue Mountain variety is considered from previous tudies to be primary. The Ashland variety is probably afirst generation alluvial clay. The Sardis variety appears to be a multiple generation, detrital product hat accumulated aspart of overbank swamp deposits...|$|R
40|$|Cells within Candida albicans biofilms display {{decreased}} {{susceptibility to}} most clinically used antifungal agents. We recently demonstrated that extracellular DNA (eDNA) {{plays an important}} role in biofilm integrity, as a component of the biofilm matrix. This study aimed at gaining insights into the contributions of eDNA to C. albicans biofilms antifungal susceptibility by the investigation of the impact of the combined use of deoxyribonuclease I (DNase) and antifungals to treat biofilms. Candida albicans biofilms were formed using a simple and reproducible 96 -well plate-based method. The activity of the combined use of 0. 13  mg l(- 1) DNase and antifungals was estimated using the 2, 3 -bis(2 -methoxy- 4 -nitro- 5 -sulfophenyl) - 5 -[(phenylamino) carbonyl]- 2 H-tetrazolium hydroxide (XTT) reduction assay and total viable counts. Herein, we report the improved efficacy of amphotericin B when in combination with DNase against C. albicans biofilms, as assessed using XTT readings and viable counts. Furthermore, although DNase increased the efficacy of caspofungin in the reduction of mitochondrial activity, no changes were observed in terms of culturable cells. Deoxyribonuclease I did not affect biofilm cells susceptibility to fluconazole. This work suggests that agents that target processes affecting the biofilm structural integrity may have potential use as adjuvants of a catheter-lock therapy.

40|$|Staphylococcus {{epidermidis}} is {{the most}} commonly isolated etiological agent of nosocomial infections mainly due to its ability to establish biofilms on indwelling medical devices. Detachment of bacteria from S. epidermidis biofilms and subsequent growth in the planktonic form is a hallmark in the pathogenesis of these infections leading to dissemination. Here we showed that S. epidermidis cells collected from biofilms cultured in conditions that promote cell viability present marked changes in their physiological status upon initiating a planktonic mode of growth. When compared to cells growing in biofilms, they displayed an increased SYBR green I staining intensity, increased transcription of the rpiA gene, decreased transcription of icaA gene as well as higher susceptibility to vancomycin and penicillin antibiotics. When bacteria collected from biofilms with high proportions of dormant cells were subsequently cultured in the planktonic mode, {{a large proportion of}} cells maintained a low SYBR staining intensity and increased resistance to vancomycin and penicillin, a profile typical of dormant cells. This phenotype further associated with a decreased ability of these biofilm-derived cells to induce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by bone marrow-derived dendritic cells in vitro, as determined by pro-inflammatory cytokine quantification. These results demonstrated that cells detached from the biofilm maintain a dormant cell-like phenotype, having a low pro-inflammatory effect and decreased susceptibility to antibiotics suggesting these cells may contribute for the recalcitrant nature of biofilm infections.

40|$|The ATP sulphurylase enzyme catalyzes {{the first}} step of the {{sulphate}} assimilation process and its activity increase can be related to the production of soluble thiols, compounds supposedly connected with tolerance to several stress types. The aim of this experiment was to verify the possibility of this process in plants under AI toxicity and two sorghum cultivars, one Al - tolerant and the other AI - sensitive, were submitted to two S concentrations (0 and 0. 6 mM) and to two AI concentrations (0 and 0. 185 mM) for a period of tem days in a Clark nutrient solution at 4. 0 pH. The specific activity of ATP sulphurylase in the presence of AI increased only in the root system of both cultivars but showed no difference between them. In the absence of S, the total activity of ATP sulphurylase was extremely low, independently of AI presence. In the presence of S, its activity was highly increased but a great part of it was eliminated in the presence of AI, especially in the leaves of the sensitive cultivar where soluble thiol content was always higher than in the root system and increased in the absence of S. In the absence of S, <b>AI</b> increased thiol <b>content</b> in both cultivars, but in the presence of S it diad not affect or reduce in either sensitive or tolerant cultivar. Independent from the presence of S, the treatment with AI resulted in a thiol content increase in the root system. The tolerant cultivar showed an average thiol content respectively > 76 % and 81 % higher than the sensitive cultivar in {{the presence or absence of}} AI. A enzima sulfurilase do ATP catalisa a primeira etapa do processo de assimilação de sulfato, e um aumento na sua atividade pode estar relacionado com a produção de tióis solúveis, compostos supostamente relacionados com tolerância a diversos tipos de estresse. Neste experimento, procurou-se verificar a possibilidade de isto estar ocorrendo em plantas sob toxicidez de Al. Para isso, submeteram-se dois cultivares de sorgo, Al-tolerante e Al-sensível, a duas concentrações de S (0 e 0, 6 mM) e a duas de Al (0 e 0, 185 mM), durante 10 dias, em solução nutritiva de Clark, pH 4, 0. A atividade específica da sulfurilase do ATP aumentou, na presença de Al, apenas nas raízes dos dois cultivares, que não diferiram entre si. Na ausência de S, a atividade total da sulfurilase do ATP foi extremamente baixa, independentemente da presença de Al. Na presença de S, sua atividade aumentou enormemente, grande parte da qual foi eliminada pela presença de Al, especialmente nas folhas do cultivar sensível. Desta forma, o teor de tióis solúveis foi sempre maior que nas raízes e aumentou quando se omitiu o S. Na ausência de S, o Al aumentou o teor de tióis nos dois cultivares, mas, na presença, não afetou ou reduziu no cultivar sensível e tolerante, respectivamente. Nas raízes, independentemente da presença de S, o tratamento com Al resultou em aumento no teor de tióis. O cultivar tolerante apresentou teor médio de tióis 76 e 81 % superior ao cultivar sensível na presença e na ausência de Al, respectivamente...|$|R
