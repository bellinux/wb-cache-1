5|$|London Necropolis {{railway station}} was the Waterloo, London {{terminus}} of the London Necropolis Railway. The London Necropolis Railway was opened in 1854 {{as a reaction}} to severe overcrowding in London's existing graveyards and cemeteries. It aimed to use the recently developed technology of the railway to move as many burials as possible to the newly built Brookwood Cemetery in Brookwood, Surrey. This location was within easy travelling distance of London, but distant enough for the dead not to pose <b>any</b> <b>risk</b> to public hygiene. There were two locations for the station; the first was in operation from 1854 to 1902, the second from 1902 to 1941.|$|E
5|$|At 4:00 am on 25 August, {{the newly}} erected French gun battery {{opened fire on}} Sirius and Iphigenia, which {{returned}} fire as best they could. Accepting that Sirius was beyond repair, Pym removed all her personnel and military supplies, setting fire to the frigate at 9:00 am, shortly after Iphigenia had pulled beyond {{the range of the}} battery, using a cannon as an anchor after losing hers the previous day. French boats attempted to reach Sirius and capture her before she exploded, although they turned back when Pym launched his own boats to contest possession of the wreck. The frigate's remaining munitions exploded at 11:00 am. During the morning, Duperré sent an official boarding party aboard Nereide, who wet the decks to prevent <b>any</b> <b>risk</b> of fire from the ships burning in the harbour and removed 75 corpses from the frigate.|$|E
5|$|Despite these successes, Parsons, {{the project}} {{engineer}} of Aerojet's Solid Fuel Department, remained motivated {{to address the}} malfunctions observed during the Ercoupe tests. In June 1942, assisted by Mills and Miller, he focused his attention on developing an effective method of restricted burning when using solid rocket fuel, as the military demanded JATOs that could provide over 100 pounds of thrust without <b>any</b> <b>risk</b> of exploding. Although solid fuels such as GALCIT-27 were more storable than their liquid counterparts, they were disfavored for military JATO use as they provided less immediate thrust {{and did not have}} the versatility of being turned on and off mid-flight. Parsons tried to resolve GALCIT-27's stability issue with GALCIT-46, which replaced the former's ammonium nitrate with guanidine nitrate. To avoid the problems seen with ammonium nitrate, he had GALCIT-46 cooled and then heated prior to testing. When it failed the test, he realized that the fuel's binding black powders rather than the oxidizers had resulted in their instability, and in June that year had the idea of using liquid asphalt as an appropriate binding agent with potassium perchlorate as oxidizer.|$|E
50|$|Parties {{must also}} adopt {{measures}} for managing <b>any</b> <b>risks</b> {{identified by the}} risk assessment, and they must take necessary steps {{in the event of}} accidental release of LMOs.|$|R

25|$|The workers {{also took}} the {{plans of the}} factory, to avoid <b>any</b> <b>risk</b> of the {{competition}} obtaining these industrial secrets. The following day, the workers held a general assembly and decided to occupy the factory day and night.|$|E
25|$|Hydrodemolition {{offers a}} number of {{environmental}} benefits. Hydrodemolition creates no dust pollution, reduces noise pollution, and the water used during the process can be collected after use to minimise <b>any</b> <b>risk</b> of contamination. Recently an innovative technology is available, which allows to clean and reuse the process-water after hydrodemolition.|$|E

25|$|Usage {{during the}} first 12 weeks of {{pregnancy}} {{does not appear to}} increase the risk of any major birth defects. There may be a small increased risk for minor birth defects such as an inguinal hernia, but the number of reports is too small to be sure if there actually is <b>any</b> <b>risk.</b>|$|E
25|$|It {{was also}} {{primarily}} Field's {{work in the}} Committee of Imperial Defence, {{that led to the}} abandonment in 1932 of the 'ten year rule'. This had been an attempt by the treasury to control defence expenditure by requesting the Foreign Office to declare whether there was <b>any</b> <b>risk</b> of war during the next ten years.|$|E
25|$|After adding <b>any</b> <b>risk</b> factors together, a {{total of}} one point or less {{indicates}} no preventive action is needed. A total of two points indicates short-term prophylaxis, e.g. with LMWH, {{may be used in}} temporary risk factors, as well as administering prophylactic treatment seven days postpartum, starting a couple of hours after birth. A total of 3 points increases the necessary duration of post partum prophylaxis to six weeks.|$|E

25|$|Following its release, {{the song}} was met with strong opposition, with critics ranging from former President Bush to various law {{enforcement}} agencies, with strong demand for the song's withdrawal from commercial availability, citing concerns of promoting anti-police sentiment. Conversely, Ice-T defended the lyrical content of the song as did various other proponents who {{did not believe that}} the song posed <b>any</b> <b>risk</b> and remained in support of the song continuing to be released and sold.|$|E
25|$|A 56.6% of gravids {{presented}} total CESD-10 scores 10 or more indicating depressed mood. Despite this, total CESD-10 {{scores and}} depressed mood rate {{did not differ}} among studied groups. Adolescents did, however, display lower resilience reflected by lower total resilience scores and {{a higher rate of}} scores below the calculated median (P < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis could not establish <b>any</b> <b>risk</b> factor for depressed mood among studied subjects; however, having an adolescent partner and a preterm delivery related to a higher risk for lower resilience.|$|E
25|$|On 22 January 2009, the BBC {{declined}} {{a request}} from the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) to screen an aid appeal intended {{to raise money to}} aid the relief effort following then recent hostilities in the Gaza Strip. Explanations cited by Mark Thompson, the BBC's then Director General raised doubts about the possibility of delivering aid in a volatile situation and highlighted the need to avoid <b>any</b> <b>risk</b> of compromising public confidence in the BBC's impartiality {{in the context of an}} ongoing news story.|$|E

25|$|It {{has long}} been speculated, and was argued in court in one case, that these {{stations}} operate as a simple and foolproof method for government agencies to communicate with spies working undercover. According to this theory, the messages are encrypted with a one-time pad, to avoid <b>any</b> <b>risk</b> of decryption by the enemy. As evidence, numbers stations have changed details of their broadcasts or produced special, nonscheduled broadcasts coincident with extraordinary political events, such as the attempted coup of August 1991 in the Soviet Union.|$|E
25|$|Its use in {{pregnant}} and lactating women is advised against, although the available preclinical (based on animal studies) evidence suggests {{it is unlikely}} to cause any deleterious effects on fetal development. The lack of evidence from human studies, however, means it is currently impossible to rule out <b>any</b> <b>risk</b> to the fetus and it is known to cross the placenta. Doxepin is secreted in breast milk and neonatal cases of respiratory depression in association with maternal doxepin use have been reported.|$|E
25|$|The {{first steps}} taken to {{diagnose}} this condition are {{consideration of the}} signs and symptoms, and a medical history (the detailed medical review of past health state) to evaluate <b>any</b> <b>risk</b> factors. Based on the symptoms presented, a range of biochemical tests (using blood and/or urine samples) may also be considered {{as part of the}} screening process to provide sufficient quantitative analysis of any differences in electrolytes, renal and liver function, and blood clotting times. Upon physical examination, palpation of the abdomen may reveal the presence of a mass or an organ enlargement.|$|E

25|$|On December 12, 2006, {{the first}} 12 plaintiffs (of over 1000 total) were {{dismissed}} on summary judgment {{because there was}} no indication that the contaminant (benzene) caused the diseases involved and the concentrations were hundreds to thousands of times lower than levels associated with <b>any</b> <b>risk.</b> In Fall of 2007, the plaintiffs agreed to pay the School District and the City up to $450,000 for expenses from the lawsuits. This payment of expenses is without prejudice to any of the plaintiffs in the case, which is on appeal.|$|E
25|$|Usury {{was still}} {{banned by the}} Church in this period, with an {{interpretation}} concisely expressed as Quidquid sorti accedit, usura est ("Whatever exceeds the principal is usury"). So the Medici Bank could not openly adopt the modern formula of promising to pay interest on demand deposits and loaning out {{a fraction of the}} deposits at greater interest to pay for the interest on the deposit, since a depositor would gain revenue on the principal without <b>any</b> <b>risk</b> to the principal, which would have made both parties usurers and sinners; nor could they charge fees or other such devices.|$|E
25|$|On December 21, {{during the}} battle around Gleize, the men of Kampfgruppe Peiper {{captured}} an American officer, Major Harold D. McCown, who was leading one of the battalions of the 119th U.S. Infantry Regiment. Having heard about the Malmedy massacre, McCown personally asked Peiper about his fate {{and that of his}} men. McCown testified that Peiper told him neither he nor his men were at <b>any</b> <b>risk</b> and that he (Peiper) was not accustomed to killing his prisoners. McCown noted that neither he nor his men were threatened in any manner, and he testified in Peiper's defence during the 1946 trial in Dachau.|$|E
