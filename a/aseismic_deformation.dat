30|$|A key {{observation}} {{to interpret}} these non-volcanic, high-attenuation {{areas of the}} lower crust is that almost no seismicity occurs in regions characterized by high attenuation and low velocity (Figures  5 and 6). A plausible cause of the aseismic and high-attenuation lower crust is the localization of overpressured fluids with a fluid pressure to lithostatic pressure ratio of approximately 1. Such high pore pressures may no longer sustain significant regional shear stresses, which promotes <b>aseismic</b> <b>deformation</b> and enhances high attenuation. The enrichment of slab-derived silica in the lower crust (e.g., Breeding and Ague 2002) may also promote <b>aseismic</b> <b>deformation.</b> Abundant fluids, supplied from the subducting Philippine Sea slab over geological time scales due to slab metamorphism, are likely to play important roles in the promotion of a large-scale <b>aseismic</b> <b>deformation</b> in the lower crust.|$|E

However, the in situ mechanical response of faults to fluid pressure variations is still poorly known. To address this question, we performed a fluid injection experiment in a fault zone in shales while monitoring fault movements at the injection source and seismic velocity variations from a near-distance (< 10 [*]m) monitoring network. We measured and located the P and S wave velocity perturbations in and around the fault using repetitive active sources. We observed that seismic velocity perturbations dramatically increase above 1. 5 [*]MPa of injection pressure. This is consistent with an increase of fluid flow associated with an aseismic dilatant shearing of the fault as shown by numerical modeling. We find that seismic velocity changes are sensitive to both fault opening by fluid invasion and effective stress variations and can be an efficient measurement for monitoring fluid-driven <b>aseismic</b> <b>deformations</b> of faults...|$|R

The data consist of velocities measured with a GPS network of 28 benchmarks and of instrumental and historical earthquake catalogues. The axes of the seismic strain-rate tensor have similar orientations to those deduced from the GPS velocity field. This indicates that the seismicity can be used to improve GPS information on the style and the orientation of the deformation. Comparison of seismic and geodetic strain rates indicates that highly strained zones experience mainly <b>aseismic</b> <b>deformation</b> in southern Iran and seismic deformation in northern Iran. A large contrast is observed between the Zagros (less than 5 per cent seismic deformation) and the Alborz–Kopet-Dag regions (more than 30 – 100 per cent seismic deformation). The distribution of the seismic/geodetic ratio correlates with the distribution of large earthquakes: intensive, low-magnitude seismicity is observed in the Zagros whereas the largest earthquakes occur in northern Iran.

40|$|International audienceObservations of {{earthquake}} swarms {{and slow}} propagating ruptures on related faults suggest a close {{relation between the}} two phenomena. Earthquakes are the signature of fast unstable ruptures initiated on localized asperities while slow <b>aseismic</b> <b>deformations</b> are experienced on large stable segments of the fault plane. The spatial proximity and the temporal coincidence of both fault mechanical responses highlight the variability of fault rheology. However, the mechanism relating earthquakes and aseismic processes is still elusive due {{to the difficulty of}} imaging these phenomena of large spatiotemporal variability at depth. Here we present laboratory experiments that explore, in great detail, the deformation processes of heterogeneous interfaces in the brittle-creep regime. We track the evolution of an interfacial crack over 7 orders of magnitude in time and 5 orders of magnitude in space using optical and acoustic sensors. We explore the response of the system to slow transient loads and show that slow deformation episodes are systematically accompanied by acoustic emissions due to local fracture energy disorder. Features of acoustic emission activities and deformation rate distributions of our experimental system are similar to those in natural faults. On the basis of an activation energy model, we link our results to the Rate and State friction model and suggest an active role of local creep deformation in driving the seismic activity of earthquake swarms...|$|R

Significant ground deformation, mainly subsidence (18 cm yr − 1), and related ground fissures cause severe damage to local infrastructure. The technique of Differential Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (DInSAR) has been demonstrated to be a very effective remote sensing tool for accurately measuring the spatial and temporal evolution of ground displacements over broad areas. In present study ERS- 1 / 2 SAR and ENVISAT ASAR images acquired between 1993 and 2010 were used to perform a historical analysis of <b>aseismic</b> ground <b>deformation</b> in Mexicali Valley, in an attempt to evaluate its spatio-temporal evolution and improve the understanding of its dynamic.

40|$|The Zagros {{mountain}} belt has {{an unusually}} large discrepancy between seismic and geodetic strain rates, implying very large aseismic release of strain. However, the spatial and depth relationship between seismic and <b>aseismic</b> <b>deformation</b> is poorly understood and controversial, with important implications both for understanding the role of <b>aseismic</b> <b>deformation</b> in regions of continental convergence and for characterizing seismic hazard for large urban populations in this region. Two recent earthquake sequences in 2008 and 2012 provide us with an ideal opportunity to use geodetic and seismological data to address this topic, not only for thrust faulting but also for rarer strike‐slip faulting in the Zagros. These aftershock sequences occurred on the southeast border between Iran and Iraq. We use Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) to obtain a mechanism for the 2008 mainshock and observe significant aseismic slip accompanying the earthquake. This aseismic slip occurred along strike from the seismic asperity and approximately doubled the seismic moment release, demonstrating that aseismic slip {{plays an important role}} for strike slip as well as thrust faulting in the Zagros. Depths are calculated by inverting surface‐wave amplitude spectra and depth phase observations, demonstrating that all events occur at depths less than 12 km, supporting the view that seismicity predominately occurs in the sedimentary cover in the Zagros. Using both the calculated depths and InSAR location, we relocate the aftershocks to reveal two distinct clusters, with the 2012 cluster occurring {{in the vicinity of the}} Zagros foredeep fault, challenging the traditional view that this region is aseismic...|$|E

Five different models were tested against the data, with one model, featuring a nearly monotonic transition from creeping behavior on the northwest to locked behavior on the southeast, found to fit the data acceptably well.

30|$|The {{transient}} {{deformation field}} between the foreshock and the mainshock as estimated by running the NSF {{on the full}} 254 station dataset is shown in Fig. 1. For the majority of sites distant from the rupture area (185 out of 254), the estimated transient deformation is ≤ 4 mm, indicating {{that this is the}} effective noise level in the estimation process. These errors likely result from colored noise in the GPS time series that has sufficient spatial coherence to be mapped into the transient signal. However, for a small subset (23 of 254), the estimated spatially coherent transient deformation is ≥ 7 mm. These stations are the same ones that show significant coseismic offsets (1 – 2 cm) {{at the time of the}} foreshock (Fig. 1), so we interpret these motions as actual crustal deformation. The solid black lines in Fig. 1 denote the transient signal, which appears to indicate that the <b>aseismic</b> <b>deformation</b> began before the foreshock. This is likely a well-known consequence of temporal smoothing during the “backsmoothing” run of the Kalman filter. There is no direct indication of any aseismic slip actually starting before the MJMA 7.3 foreshock during the forward run of the filter. Thus, the primary result of the NSF analysis is that a spatially coherent, <b>aseismic</b> <b>deformation</b> transient resulted in 7 – 10 mm of eastward motion during the 50 hours between the foreshock and the mainshock at the GPS sites near the east coast of Honshu between about 38.5 °N and 39.5 °N. In contrast, the eastward motion observed along the Japan Sea Coast (Longitude ~ 140.0 E), with amplitude larger than the central Tohoku area (Longitude ~ 140.7 E) likely results from a combination of colored noise that is coherent between a few nearby stations and hence mapped into the smooth basis functions.|$|E
40|$|The Messina Straits, {{southern}} Italy, unfortunately {{became famous}} after {{the occurrence of}} the great earthquake of December 28, 1908, Ms= 7. 5, that caused thousands of deaths and severe destruction over a wide area along the Sicilian and Calabrian coasts. After that time many geophysical and geological studies were performed to evaluate the seismic characteristics of the 1908 eartquake, the seismic risk and the geological evolution of this region {{in the framework of}} Mediterranean geodynamics. In 1970, a geodetic network was set up across the Straits and was repeatedly measured with terrestrial techniques until 1980, showing a northward displacement of the Sicilian sites with respect to the Calabrian ones, between 1970 and 1971. In 1987, the old terrestrial network was surveyed again for the first time by the GPS technique, improving the accuracy of the coordinate determinations. Finally, in 1994, a wider network was established and surveyed again to collect additional GPS observations from a larger area across the Straits. In this paper, an analysis of the results obtained from the two GPS surveys with respect to those achieved by the terrestrial surveys (from 1970 to 1980) is given. This analysis shows there has not been significant crustal horizontal deformation across the Straits in the last 15 years. Although this crustal tectonic 'quiescence' corresponds to a low seismic activity level in the Straits area, terrestrial and GPS geodetic results would agree with Straits geophysical models excluding any <b>aseismic</b> <b>deformations</b> acting perpendicular to the Straits axis...|$|R

We simulated {{a case in}} which a horizontal injection well intersects a steeply dipping fault, with hydraulic fracturing channeled within the fault, during a 3 -h hydraulic fracturing stage. Consistent with field observations, the simulation results show that shale-gas hydraulic fracturing along faults does not likely induce seismic events that could be felt on the ground surface, but rather results in numerous small microseismic events, as well as <b>aseismic</b> <b>deformations</b> along with the fracture propagation. The calculated seismic moment magnitudes ranged from about − 2. 0 to 0. 5, except for one case assuming a very brittle fault with low residual shear strength, for which the magnitude was 2. 3, an event that would likely go unnoticed or might be barely felt by humans at its epicenter. The calculated moment magnitudes showed a dependency on injection depth and fault dip. We attribute such dependency to variation in shear stress on the fault plane and associated variation in stress drop upon reactivation. Our simulations showed {{that at the end of}} the 3 -h injection, the rupture zone associated with tensile and shear failure extended to a maximum radius of about 200 m from the injection well. The results of this modeling study for steeply dipping faults at 1000 to 2500 m depth is in agreement with earlier studies and field observations showing that it is very unlikely that activation of a fault by shale-gas hydraulic fracturing at great depth (thousands of meters) could cause felt seismicity or create a new flow path (through fault rupture) that could reach shallow groundwater resources...|$|R

Although the GNSS derived estimates of the Earth crust velocity {{are becoming more and}} more reliable, advanced data analysis techniques are needed to recognize geophysical features in the GNSS time-series, e. g., non linear behaviors, discontinuities in the signal and in its derivative, i. e., in the velocity. Unfortunately these phenomena are often hidden in the time-series noise and external information, as seismic events, are not always known. The main focus of this work is the detection of signal discontinuities in GNSS time-series through the use of advanced analysis techniques: the wavelets, the Bayesian and the variational methods. The Mumford and Shah (Commun Pure Appl Math 42 : 577 - 685, 1989) and the Blake and Zisserman (Visual reconstruction, 1987) variational models for signal segmentation can detect signal discontinuities in an explicitly way. The Blake and Zisserman (Visual reconstruction, 1987) model can also detect discontinuities of the signal first derivative, i. e., velocity abrupt changes can be detected. At first, to prove and assess the capability to detect discontinuities correctly, the methods have been applied to some Cascadia (North America) time-series, characterized by well known <b>aseismic</b> <b>deformations.</b> A second test area has been taken into account: the Calabrian Arc subduction zone, in southern Italy. The analyzed Italian GNSS time-series are characterized by very weak and noisy signals and the geodynamic of the area is mostly unknown. When present, discontinuities are expected to be very small and compatible with the signal noise. This motivates the use of advanced data analysis techniques to investigate the presence of discontinuities. At the moment, the analysis of the Italian time-series has revealed several discontinuities which nature cannot be labeled easily as geophysical or geodetic...|$|R

After that time many geophysical and geological studies were developed to evaluate the seismic characteristics of the 1908 earthquake, the seismic risk and the geological evolution of the region in the framework of the Mediterranean geodynamics, characterized by the collision between the African and Eurasian plates. With the aim to evaluate the present crustal motion of this area, that undergone a recent tectonic evolution that produced an important uplift during the last 125 Kyears, since 1970 was started a geodetic research. A geodetic network was set up across the Straits and repeatedly measured with terrestrial techniques till 1980.

40|$|The seismic cycle {{on a major}} fault {{involves}} {{long periods}} of elastic strain and stress accumulation, driven by <b>aseismic</b> ductile <b>deformation</b> at depth, ultimately released by sudden fault slip events. Coseismic slip distributions are generally heterogeneous {{with most of the}} energy being released in the rupture of asperities. Since, on the long term, the fault's walls generally do not accumulate any significant permanent deformation, interseismic deformation might be heterogeneous, revealing zones of focused stress buildup. The pattern of current deformation along the Himalayan arc, which is known to produce recurring devastating earthquakes, and where several seismic gaps have long been recognized, might accordingly show significant lateral variations, providing a possible explanation for the uneven microseismic activity along the Himalayan arc. By contrast, the geodetic measurements show a rather uniform pattern of interseismic strain, oriented consistently with long-term geological deformation, as indicated from stretching lineation. We show that the geodetic data and seismicity distribution are reconciled from a model in which microseismicity is interpreted as driven by stress buildup increase in the interseismic period. The uneven seismicity pattern is shown to reflect the impact of the topography on the stress field, indicating low deviatoric stresses (< 35 MPa) and a low friction (< 0. 3) on the Main Himalayan Thrust.

We document a geologic record of past co-seismic slip to the trench. The core passed through a less than 1. 9 -million-year-old megathrust frontal ramp that superimposes older Miocene biogenic oozes onto late Miocene–Pleistocene silty clays. This, together with our stratigraphic analyses and geophysical images, constrains the position of the basal decollement to lie within the biogenic oozes. Our friction experiments show that, when wet, silty clays and biogenic oozes are both slip-weakening at sub-seismic and seismic slip velocities. Oozes are stronger than silty clays at slip velocities of {{less than or equal to}} 0. 01 [*]m[*]s– 1, and wet oozes become as weak as silty clays only at a slip velocity of 1 [*]m[*]s– 1.

40|$|Faults {{can slip}} either aseismically or through episodic seismic ruptures, {{but we still}} do not {{understand}} the factors which determine the partitioning between these two modes of slip. This challenge can now be addressed thanks to the dense set of geodetic and seismological networks that have been deployed in various areas with active tectonics. The data from such networks, as well as modern remote sensing techniques, indeed allow documenting of the spatial and temporal variability of slip mode and give some insight. This is the approach taken in this study, which is focused on the Longitudinal Valley Fault (LVF) in Eastern Taiwan. This fault is particularly appropriate since the very fast slip rate (about 5 cm/yr) is accommodated by both seismic and <b>aseismic</b> slip. <b>Deformation</b> of anthropogenic features shows that aseismic creep accounts for a significant fraction of fault slip near the surface, but this fault also released energy seismically, since it has produced five M_w> 6. 8 earthquakes in 1951 and 2003. Moreover, owing to the thrust component of slip, the fault zone is exhumed which allows investigation of deformation mechanisms.

The long-term recurrence in- terval between earthquakes, the strong interplate coupling, and the <b>aseismic</b> creeping <b>deformation</b> acting along the main low-angle detachments i. e. the Woollard and the Mid-Crust detachments {{may account for the}} pervasive seismic gap at the GGTB area. Because the subduction channel exhibits no record of significant seismic activity, no evidence exists to establish a link between the GGTB sustained subsidence and a basin-centered asperity. Because the GGTB is a promis- ing site of hydrocarbon resources, to understand processes at the origin of this escape-induced forearc basin has a major economic interest...|$|R
40|$|Here I compare {{estimates}} of tectonic strain rates from dense Global Positioning System measurements with the seismicity {{released in the}} last ~ 500 years in the Apennines (Italy). The rates of seismic moment accumulation from geodesy and of historical seismic release by earthquakes agree within the uncertainties, ruling out significant <b>aseismic</b> <b>deformation.</b> Within the considered 400 km long section of the Apennines, this balance yields an average recurrence interval of 30 – 75 years for MW≥ 6. 5 events without requiring a future earthquake larger than those observed historically (MW~ 7). A minimum estimate of unreleased strain allows MW≥ 6. 5 and MW≥ 6. 9 events {{to be released in}} ~ 35 % and ~ 10 % of the central-southern Apennines, respectively. The definition of the seismic potential for smaller events is more uncertain, and their occurrence remains a significant threat throughout the Apennines...|$|E
40|$|Earthquakes {{arise from}} {{frictional}} ‘stick–slip’ instabilities as elastic strain is released by shear failure, almost always on a pre-existing fault. How the faulted rock responds to applied shear stress {{depends on its}} composition, environmental conditions (such as temperature and pressure), fluid presence and strain rate. These geological and physical variables determine the shear strength and frictional stability of a fault, and the dominant mineral deformation mechanism. To differing degrees, these effects ultimately control the partitioning between seismic and <b>aseismic</b> <b>deformation,</b> and are recorded by fault-rock textures. The scale-invariance of earthquake slip allows for extrapolation of geological and geophysical observations of earthquake-related deformation. Here we emphasize that the seismological character of a fault is highly dependent on fault geology, and that the high frequency of earthquakes observed by geophysical monitoring demands consideration of seismic slip as a major mechanism of finite fault displacement in the geological record...|$|E
40|$|We {{estimate}} the loading rate in southern California {{and the change}} in stress induced by a transient slip event across the San Andreas fault (SAF) system in central California, using a model of static fatigue. We analyze temporal properties of aftershocks {{in order to determine}} the time delay before the onset of the power law aftershock decay rate. In creep-slip and stick-slip zones, we show that the rate of change of this delay is related to seismic and <b>aseismic</b> <b>deformation</b> across the SAF system. Furthermore, we show that this rate of change is proportional to the deficit of slip rate along the SAF. This new relationship between geodetic and seismological data is in good agreement with predictions from a Limited Power Law model in which the evolution of the duration of a linear aftershock decay rate over short time results from variations in the load of the brittle upper crust...|$|E
40|$|The Longitudinal Valley Fault (LVF) {{in eastern}} Taiwan {{is a high}} slip rate fault (about 5 cm/yr), which {{exhibits}} both seismic and <b>aseismic</b> slip. <b>Deformation</b> of anthropogenic features shows that aseismic creep accounts for a significant fraction of fault slip near the surface, whereas {{a fraction of the}} slip is also seismic, since this fault has produced large earthquakes with five M_w> 6. 8 events in 1951 and 2003. In this study, we analyze a dense set of geodetic and seismological data around the LVF, including campaign mode Global Positioning System(GPS) measurements, time series of daily solutions for continuous GPS stations (cGPS), leveling data, and accelerometric records of the 2003 Chenkung earthquake. To enhance the spatial resolution provided by these data, we complement them with interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) measurements produced from a series of Advanced Land Observing Satellite images processed using a persistent scatterer technique. The combined data set covers the entire LVF and spans the period from 1992 to 2010. We invert this data to infer the temporal evolution of fault slip at depth using the Principal Component Analysis-based Inversion Method. This technique allows the joint inversion of diverse data, taking the advantage of the spatial resolution given by the InSAR measurements and the temporal resolution afforded by the cGPS data. We find that (1) seismic slip during the 2003 Chengkung earthquake occurred on a fault patch which had remained partially locked in the interseismic period, (2) the seismic rupture propagated partially into a zone of shallow aseismic interseismic creep but failed to reach the surface, and (3) that aseismic afterslip occurred around the area that ruptured seismically. We find consistency between geodetic and seismological constraints on the partitioning between seismic and aseismic creep. About 80 – 90 % of slip on the southern section of LVF in the 0 – 26 km, seismogenic depth range, is actually aseismic. We infer that the clay-rich Lichi Mélange is the key factor promoting aseismic creep at shallow depth...|$|R
30|$|Crustal {{deformation}} {{associated with}} the Mid Niigata prefecture Earthquake in 2004 (MJMA = 6.8) was detected using RADARSAT SAR interferometry. A displacement of − 40 cm in the line-of-sight to the satellite was observed {{to the west of}} the main shock epicenter, and a displacement of 20 cm was observed to the east of the epicenter. Fault parameters estimated from the obtained deformation were in good agreement with those of the Centroid Moment Tensor solution for the main shock provided by the Japan Meteorological Agency. In the postseismic period, a steep gradient of deformation was found around the Obiro and the Western Muikamachi Basin faults, indicating that a fault-slip occurred in the shallow part of the fault. Since the seismicity in the shallow part of the Western Muikamachi Basin fault was very low, we believe that it must have been an <b>aseismic</b> slip. Crustal <b>deformation</b> associated with an aftershock that occurred on October 27 (MJMA = 6.1) was detected, and it was ascertained that this aftershock had ruptured the conjugate plane with respect to the Obiro fault. Since locations and/or mechanisms of these faults differed significantly, it was determined that at least three faults were involved in this series of earthquakes.|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn an ophiolitic nappe of Alpine Corsica, a major {{fault zone}} superimposes metagabbro over serpentinite and peridotite. Ductile and brittle {{deformation}} structures are {{observed in the}} fault damage zones. In the metagabbro damage zone, early deformation culminates in blueschist or eclogite facies conditions and consists of west-verging mylonitization alternating with pseudotachylyte-forming faulting with undetermined vergence. This early deformation is likely coeval with west-verging seismic (pseudotachylyte-forming) reverse faulting in the footwall peridotite or with <b>aseismic</b> distributed cataclastic <b>deformation</b> of footwall serpentinite. These early events (aseismic mylonitization or distributed cataclasis and seismic faulting) are interpreted as reverse faulting/shear in an east-dipping subducting oceanic lithosphere in Cretaceous to Eocene times. Late deformation events consist of ductile shear and seismic faulting having occurred under retrograde greenschist conditions. Kinematics of the ductile shear is top-to-the-east. These events are interpreted {{as the result of}} syn-to post-collision extension of Alpine Corsica in Eocene to Miocene times. The heterogeneous distribution of pseudotachylyte veins along the fault zone (abundant at peridotite-metagabbro interfaces, rare or absent at serpentinite-metagabbro interfaces) is interpreted as the consequence of contrasted frictional properties of the rocks in contact. High-friction peridotite-metagabbro contacts could correspond to asperities whereas low-friction serpentinite-metagabbro contacts could correspond to creeping zones...|$|R
