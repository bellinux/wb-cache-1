During the African Synod, we, the pastors of the church, felt the duty to express our consternation and to launch an appeal for forgiveness and reconciliation. This {{is the only way}} to dissipate the threats of ethnocentrism that are hovering over Africa these days and that have so brutally touched Rwanda and Burundi.|$|E
25|$|A {{bright spot}} {{in the midst of}} the team's disappointing seasons came from <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> <b>tragedy.</b> In February 2011, former Stingrays goaltender Kirk Daubenspeckwho played for the team from 1999 to 2006 and was part of the Kelly Cup {{championship}} team in 2001was in a near-fatal car accident that resulted in a traumatic brain injury that left him in a coma for six days. Friends, family members and former teammates from the Stingrays, the Hershey Bears, Culver Military Academy and the University of Wisconsin (Daubenspeck's alma maters) banded together to raise money to help defray the extensive medical bills. The team sold T-shirts bearing Daubenspeck's name and number (29) at the season's remaining home games. In April 2011, current and former Stingrays donned their skates and took to the ice for the team's first ever alumni game, held to benefit the Daubenspeck family. The event (held at the Carolina Ice Palace) drew a capacity crowd of over 700 and raised over $20,000 in ticket sales and from a post-game jersey auction. Daubenspeck and his family were in attendance, and Daubenspeck dropped the game's ceremonial first puck.|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film four stars, calling it [...] "one {{of the best}} films of the year, an unflinching lament for the human condition." [...] Janet Maslin, writing for The New York Times, said [...] "this fusion of Mr. Banks's and Mr. Egoyan's {{sensibilities}} stands as a particularly inspired mix" [...] and that Sarah Polley and Bruce Greenwood are [...] "particularly good here." [...] Brendan Kelly of Variety praised The Sweet Hereafter as [...] "Egoyan's most ambitious work to date," [...] and [...] "a rich, complex meditation {{on the impact of}} <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> <b>tragedy</b> on a small town," [...] adding Polley and Tom McCamus are [...] "excellent." ...|$|E

As part of the settlement, the United States did not admit legal liability or formally apologize to Iran but agreed to pay on an ex gratia basis US$61.8 million, amounting to $213,103.45 per passenger, in compensation {{to the families of the}} Iranian victims.|$|R

Vera tells <b>a</b> story, the <b>terrible</b> <b>tragedy</b> of Mr Sappleton and his sons. He is told how they went out hunting in the marshes, and were lost in a fog three years earlier. Their bodies were never found but the mistress of the house insists that the French doors are left open every day until dusk, praying and hoping that one day they will return.|$|R

500|$|The Hustler is {{fundamentally}} {{a story of}} what it means to be a human being, couched within the context of winning and losing. Describing the film, Robert Rossen said: [...] "My protagonist, Fast Eddie, wants to become a great pool player, but the film is really about the obstacles he encounters in attempting to fulfill himself as a human being. He attains self-awareness only after <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> personal <b>tragedy</b> which he has caused— and then he wins his pool game." [...] Roger Ebert concurs with this assessment, citing The Hustler as [...] "one of the few American movies in which the hero wins by surrendering, by accepting reality instead of his dreams." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{death of}} a child, any child, under any circumstances, is <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> human <b>tragedy.</b> The death of these {{children}} under these circumstances is a tragedy almost too great to bear. It is nevertheless a tragedy that I must bear {{for the rest of}} my life, and one for which I also must bear responsibility. Nothing that I can do or that can be done to me can bring my children back. In accepting responsibility for this crime, I recognize that I must face and accept the punishment as judged by the court and must also face the sorrow of the loss of my children and the reality of my role in their deaths. —Excerpt from the sentencing statement of Debora Green, as quoted in Rule, p. 366 ...|$|R

[...] As {{she had told him}} nothing of her intercourse with Bangles,--with Bangles who had literally picked the poor wretch up,--he did not see how she herself had been concerned in the matter; but he said nothing about that, knowing the character of his Madalina. [...] "I shall see--that--body, floating before my eyes while I live," [...] she said, [...] "and the gory wound, and,--and--" [...] "Don't," [...] said Johnny, recoiling in truth from the picture, by which he was revolted. [...] "Never again," [...] she said; [...] "never again! But you forced it from me, and now I shall not close my eyes for a week." ...|$|R

Only four French sailors were {{saved by the}} Canadian destroyer HMCS Assiniboine. The death of so many young men was <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> <b>tragedy</b> for St. Pierre and Miquelon.|$|E
2500|$|Missouri Governor Jay Nixon made a {{statement}} on the shootings, saying, [...] "This is a horrific tragedy, and our hearts {{go out to the}} victims of these senseless acts and their families." [...] He added that crisis counseling will be made available to Tyrone citizens. Houston Mayor Don Tottingham also said, [...] "This is <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> <b>tragedy</b> in a community that's real close-knit. This is a great town, and this is why it's such a tragedy because it shows you're vulnerable to things." ...|$|E

Code was on a winter camping trip with few supplies, similar to summer trips he'd taken before in admiration of the adventures he had seen on Survivorman. Learning of Code's death, Stroud said, [...] "It's <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> <b>tragedy</b> and I feel absolutely terrible for the families involved"—but did not know Code or the situation he was in, and refused to comment further on his death.|$|E

60|$|I will, however, make but brief {{reference}} to this festive occasion, and proceed {{to tell of}} an event which created an unexpected sensation in our little community, and might have closed our New Year's Day amusements with <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> <b>tragedy.</b>|$|E
60|$|It was {{at eleven}} forty-five {{that the first}} alarm reached the small local police station, in charge of Sergeant Wilson of the Sussex Constabulary. Cecil Barker, much excited, had rushed {{up to the door}} and pealed furiously upon the bell. <b>A</b> <b>terrible</b> <b>tragedy</b> had {{occurred}} at the Manor House, and John Douglas had been murdered. That was the breathless burden of his message. He had hurried back to the house, followed within a few minutes by the police sergeant, who arrived {{at the scene of the}} crime a little after twelve o'clock, after taking prompt steps to warn the county authorities that something serious was afoot.|$|E

60|$|Little did he {{know that}} this was the ballet-like {{interlude}} in <b>a</b> great and <b>terrible</b> <b>tragedy,</b> whose first act was being played out on the stage where they schemed and sported, like their own little drama, which was all the world to them, and noting to the others. Berenger knew indeed that the Admiral was greatly rejoiced that the Nid de Merle estates should go into Protestant hands, and that the old gentleman lost no opportunity of impressing on him that they were a heavy trust, to be used for the benefit of 'the Religion,' and for the support of the King in his better mind. But it may be feared that he did not give a very attentive ear to all this. He did not like to think of those estates; he would gladly have left them all the Narcisse, so that he might have their lady, and though quite willing to win his spurs under Charles and Coligny against the Spaniard, his heart and head were far too full to take in the web of politics. Sooth to say, the elopement in prospect seemed to him infinitely more important than Pope or Spaniard, Guise or Huguenot, and Coligny observed with a sigh to Teligny that he was a good boy, but nothing but the merest boy, with eyes open only to himself.|$|R
60|$|There {{is before}} {{me so much}} to do, that I would regard it as <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> <b>tragedy</b> if I died before I was allowed to {{complete}} at any rate a little of it. I see new developments in art and life, each {{one of which is}} a fresh mode of perfection. I long to live so that I can explore what is no less than a new world to me. Do {{you want to know what}} this new world is? I think you can guess what it is. It is the world in which I have been living. Sorrow, then, and all that it teaches one, is my new world.|$|E
6000|$|Then {{there were}} the holes where the great beams of the beacon had been fixed, and the iron bats, most of which latter were still left in the rock, and {{some of which may}} be seen there at the present day. There was also the pool into which poor Selkirk had tumbled with the {{vegetables}} {{on the day of the}} first dinner on the rock, and that other pool into which Forsyth had plunged after the mermaids; and, not least interesting among the spots of note, there was the ledge, now named the [...] "Last Hope", on which Mr Stevenson and his men had stood on the day when the boat had been carried away, and they had expected, but were mercifully preserved from, <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> <b>tragedy.</b>|$|E

At such times she would not answer him; but she knew that he would press her for an answer. [...] "I blame him more than I do you," [...] continued Trevelyan,--"infinitely more. He was a serpent intending to sting me from the first,--not knowing perhaps how deep the sting would go." [...] There was no question in this, and the assertion was one which had been made so often that she could let it pass.

60|$|So Ned had no {{resource}} left him, and had {{to consent}} to dine at Liversedge. Once there he often repeated the visit. With the kind and hearty manufacturer he was perfectly at home, and although at first he was uncomfortable with his daughter he gradually became at his ease with her, especially after she had driven over with her father {{to make friends with}} Lucy, and, again, a short time afterward, to carry her away for a week's visit at Liversedge. For this Ned was really grateful. Lucy's life had been a very dull one. She had no friends of her own age in Marsden, for naturally at the time of Mr. Mulready's death all intimacy with the few acquaintances they had in the place had been broken off, for few cared that their children should associate with a family among whom such <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> <b>tragedy</b> had taken place.|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{say that}} Prince Charles Edward is meditating a mad scheme of {{crossing}} to Scotland, and raising his standard there. If so, {{do what you}} can to prevent your husband from joining him. We made but a poor hand of it, last time; and the chances of success are vastly smaller now. Then it was but a comparatively short time since the Stuarts had lost the throne of England, and there were great numbers who wished them back. Now the Hanoverian is very much more firmly seated on the throne. The present man has a considerable army, and the troops have had experience of war on the Continent, and have shown themselves rare soldiers. Were not my brother Lord Marischal of Scotland, and my name somewhat widely known, I should not hang back from the adventure, however desperate; but our example might lead many who might otherwise stand aloof to take up arms, which would bring, I think, sure destruction upon them. Therefore we shall restrain our own inclinations, and shall watch what I feel sure will be <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> <b>tragedy,</b> from a distance; striking perhaps somewhat heavier blows than usual upon the heads of Turks, Moors, Frenchmen, and others, to make up for our not being able to use our swords where our inclinations would lead us.|$|E
