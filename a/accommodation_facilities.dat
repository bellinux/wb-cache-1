500|$|As of 30June 1940, {{only one}} of the No.5 EFTS's four {{required}} hangars had been completed. <b>Accommodation</b> <b>facilities</b> were, according to the unit operations book, [...] "bleak and depressing" [...] and deficiencies in equipment were [...] "too numerous for itemising". The primitive conditions meant that personnel suffered adverse health effects from the cold in winter and hot, dusty conditions in the summer. Flying at Narromine was also hampered by bad weather, particularly heavy rain and wind. Accidents were frequent at all EFTSs, though fatalities were rare. An instructor and his passenger from No.5 EFTS were killed when a Tiger Moth crashed on 3August 1940, possibly caused by a stall while practising forced landings. By the end of August, the school was operating one of its two required Link Trainer simulators.|$|E

2500|$|Being a German {{institute}} in British India, the college suffered wide repercussions during the First World War (1914–1918). Following {{the outbreak of}} the war, the German Jesuit priests, mainly the older ones, were interned and detained in 1914 at the college villa in Khandala, where many died. However, the younger German Jesuits were repatriated in 1916. The departure of German Jesuits led to a dislocation in the administration of the college, but was mitigated by a few Swiss, Luxemburger, and English Jesuits. The number of lay professors increased following the withdrawal of the German Jesuits. In 1920, enrollment of students from outside Bombay, especially Calcutta, Yangon, Mangalore, and Sindh, started increasing. Subsequently, a third floor was added to the hostel to provide <b>accommodation</b> <b>facilities</b> for them. The college started offering six more languages: Marathi, Gujarati, Urdu, Arabic, Hebrew, and Portuguese. The Spanish Jesuits arrived in 1922. By the 1920s, the college had expanded its offerings to more than just liberal arts. Science departments such as Chemistry and Biology came to be established. The Spanish Jesuit Henry Heras founded the [...] "Indian Historical Research Institute" [...] in 1925. The extension of the East-West science wing was completed in 1925 and opened by Leslie Orme Wilson, Governor of Bombay (1923–1926), on 26 January 1926, at an outlay of Rs. 200,000.|$|E
