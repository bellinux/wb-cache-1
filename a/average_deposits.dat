30|$|To {{test the}} price-based {{discipline}} mechanism in the deposit market I use as dependent variable an implicit interest rate: {{the ratio of}} 12 -month interest payments on deposits {{to the amount of}} annual <b>average</b> <b>deposits</b> (IIRDE). It is important to notice that the implicit interest rates have been widely employed in the literature on market discipline due to data limitations; it is complicated to find data directly describing the interest rate on deposits. To evaluate the performance of IIRDE, I compare it with the 28  days CETES (Mexican Federal Treasury Certificates).|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate different nozzles and spray rates on drop deposition in corn (Zea mays), Euphorbia heterophylla and Brachiaria plantaginea, both weeds located at and between crop rows. The experimental design established was complete random blocks with treatments arranged at 2 x 2 factorial scheme (2 nozzles types: DG 11002 VS flat flan and medium droplets, TXVK 08 cone and very fine droplets; and 2 rates: 100 and 200 L ha(- 1)) with four replications. The spray applications occurred at 13 days after corn germination (3 - 5 expanded leaves), when E. heterophylla and B. plantaginea plants had 2 - 4 and 2 - 3 leaves, respectively. Solution of Brilliant Blue (FD&C- 1) dye at 3, 000 ppm was used as spray tracer. It was concluded that the greatest <b>average</b> <b>deposits</b> in corn plants was provided by TXVK 08, independently of the spray rates used. The most uniform deposits occurred when the spray rates of 200 L ha(- 1) was used. Spray deposits were most uniform in B. plantaginea compared to E. heterophylla when both weds were located at crop row, independently of nozzle or spray rates. However, the DG 11002 VS spray nozzle provided the most uniform drop deposition on B. plantaginea located between the rows, while the most efficient deposition over E. heterophylla located between rows was TXVK 08...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} apple tree {{spraying}} experiments {{was conducted to}} identify factors affecting agrichemical deposits from airblast sprayers and to relate deposit observations to biological responses in selected pest, disease and physiological systems. Factors addressed included tree canopy form, application volume, travel speed and sprayer type. Several tracers were evaluated and deposits quantified by wash-off removal from bulked leaf or fruit samples drawn from 10 - 15 spatially consistent 1. 5 m 3 zones per tree. Deposit data were expressed on a tissue area basis and/or {{as a proportion of}} the spray emitted (retention). Spray deposits were compared across 11 canopy forms to identify interactions with tree size, leaf area and canopy density and volume. A two-fold difference in deposits between canopies occurred when sprays were applied at a constant chemical rate per hectare. This variability was approximately halved when chemical rates per hectare were adjusted {{on the basis of the}} canopy Tree-Row-Volume (TRV). The best TRV measurement system identified used across-row canopy spread measurements at half metre height intervals, rather than just a single measurement of canopy spread. Deposits were better correlated with TRV data than with any of the other canopy descriptors used. Canopy density was identified as an important covariate, but light penetration proved an unsuitable indicator of canopy density as it was strongly correlated with TRV. Deposit variations between zones within trees were consistent between all but the smallest canopy sprayed. Increasing the distance from the sprayer and/or increasing canopy penetration requirements reduced spray deposits. Spray retention across these canopies in full leaf ranged from 25 - 90 %, but tended to increase with decreased application volume. There was a ca. 10 - 15 % increase in deposits when spray volumes were reduced 4 - 5 times below those used in typical dilute spray volumes (ca. 2, 000 1 ha- 1). At high volumes with significant run-off, retention could ca. 50 % of that at lower volumes. Run-off losses could be related to TRV, with significant run-off occurring once application volumes exceeded one litre per 7. 5 - 11 m 3 of TRV. Surprisingly, <b>average</b> <b>deposits</b> on 5 m tail slender pyramid trees increased with increased travel speed over the range 1. 9 - 8. 8 km h- 1. Within-tree spray deposit distributions were not markedly affected by the travel speeds tested with air assistance volumes of ca. 30, 000 or 44, 000 m 3 h- 1. High, but relatively consistent within-tree deposit variability was a feature of deposits from axial fan, airblast sprayers, especially when used in intensive 4 - 6 m tall, single leader tree plantings. Within-tree deposit variability decreased with increased application volumes. Tower sprayers provided a more even vertical distribution of spray emission points and achieved different, but not necessarily more even, within-tree deposit distributions than airblast machines. Experiments on chemical thinning, mealybug (Pseudococcus viburni) and black spot (Venturia inaequalis) control, showed the biological responses could not have been predicted from the spray deposit measurements. However, combined assessment of spray deposits and biological effects greatly facilitated interpretation of both sets of data. ...|$|E

Os alvos naturais utilizados foram: plantas de soja com 150 repetições; B. plantaginea no estádio de duas a oito folhas, coletadas na linha da cultura com 141 repetições; e B. plantaginea e C. benghalensis nas entrelinhas, com 150 e 50 repetições, respectivamente. Os alvos artificiais foram constituídos por lâminas distribuídas a 0, 12, 2 e 22, 5 cm da linha da cultura. Após a aplicação, os alvos foram coletados individualmente e lavados com 30, 20 e 15 mL de água deionizada, para soja, lâminas e plantas daninhas, respectivamente. Estas originaram as amostras analisadas em espectrofotômetro, estimando-se o depósito de calda em µL por planta e µL cm² de área foliar. Foram ajustadas curvas de regressão entre os depósitos unitários e as freqüências acumuladas, utilizando-se o modelo de Gompertz. As relações entre os depósitos máximos e mínimos foram de 7, 4, 10 e 6 para soja, C. benghalensis e B. plantaginea na linha e na entrelinha, respectivamente. As plantas de B. plantaginea da entrelinha receberam, em média, 34 % a mais de depósito do que as plantas da linha. The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to study the variability of individual tracer deposits (simulating herbicides applied in post-emergence) on Brachiaria plantaginea and Commelina benghalensis infesting soybeans crop. The tracer deposits were evaluated also on the crop. A boom sprayer was used, equipped with 110 -SF- 03 nozzles and 250 L ha- 1 of a solution was applied containing 0. 18 % of each of the following dyes: FDC- 1 and Satur-Yellow; 150 soybean plants; 141 and 150 Brachiaria plantaginea plants were used as targets located in the rows and between the rows of the crop, respectively; 50 Commelina benghalensis plants located between the rows and 125 glass plates of 19. 76 cm² (25 in the rows; 50 and 50 at 12. 25 cm and 22. 5 from the rows). The spray deposits (mL per plant or plate and mL cm- 2) were individually estimated in each of the 566 targets by washing them in de-ionized water and measuring the concentration of dye FDC- 1 in the solutions by spectrophotometry. The results for each target type and position were expressed in an increasing order and associated to accumulated frequencies from 0 to 100 %. Regression analysis was performed according to the Gompertz model and using the individual deposits and the accumulated frequencies as independent and dependent variables, respectively.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to investigate the impact of Federal Reserve membership on the price of bank services, mainly average loan rates service charges on demand deposits and average deposit rates. In addition, this research investigated the influence of the ratio of member banks to total banks in the market on member banks pricing policies. ^ The research design involved the formulation of a system of equations incorporating bank inputs, output and the pricing of bank services. The system was estimated for all the sampled states (Illinois, Iowa, Kansas and Nebraska) as a group and for individual states (after the necessary modifications) using Three Stage Least Squares. ^ The data were secured from three sources: First, the balance sheets and income statements for insured commercial banks in the four sampled states from 1972 - 1977 were obtained from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Second: total population, retail sales, effective buying income and median household effective buying income were obtained from various issues of Sales and Marketing Management magazine. Finally, the adjusted monetary base (seasonally adjusted) figures were obtained from Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. ^ Within the context of the theoretical framework that bank input, output, and the pricing decisions are simultaneously determined, the statistical results indicated that, on the average, member banks in the four states as a whole, had charged their customers lower average rates on loans, and lower service charges on demand deposits. In addition, the findings suggested that the higher the ratio of member banks to total banks in the market, the higher the service charges on demand deposits and the lower average rates on time and savings deposits. However, the statistical results indicated that the effect of FRS was contingent on the state where member banks were located. For individual state, the findings were as follows: (1) Illinois member banks charged their customers higher average rates on loans and lower service charges on demand deposits than nonmember banks. (2) Iowa member banks charged their customers higher average rates on loans, higher service charges on demand deposits and paid higher average rates on time and savings deposits than nonmember banks. Furthermore, the higher the ratio of member banks in the market, the higher the average loan rate and the service charges on demand deposits. (3) Kansas member banks charged their customers higher service charges on demand deposits and paid higher average rates on time and savings deposits than nonmember banks. Furthermore, the higher the concentration ratio of member banks in the market the lower the service charges on demand deposits and <b>average</b> <b>deposits</b> rate. (4) Nebraska member banks charged their customers lower average rates on loans, lower service charges on demand deposits and paid higher average rates on time and savings deposits. Furthermore, the higher the ratio of member banks in the market, the lower the service charges on demand deposits. ^ Including the interaction term between FRS membership and the ratio of member banks to total banks in the market yielded no statistically significant results for the sample as a whole. However, it was found that member banks in markets dominated by member banks charged their customers higher service charges on demand deposits (in the state of Illinois), lower service charges on demand deposits (in the state of Kansas) and paid higher average rates on time and savings deposits (in the state of Nebraska). ...|$|E

After a typhoon,the nearshore is scoured and the far offshore is <b>deposited.</b> The <b>average</b> scour depth is around 4 cm and the <b>average</b> <b>deposited</b> height is around 2 cm.

The sediment recovery mechanism is that,due to the dynamic action of the water in the normal wind period,it transports the deposition of sediment at the far offshore to the nearshore so as to make it recovered and gradually deposited. Based on the above regularity and mechanism,measures can be taken like that,to fill a sediment barrier parallel to the shoreline,which can make the water carry more sediment to the nearshore so as to speed up the recovery at Silver Beach.

Double lung recipients <b>deposited</b> on <b>average</b> 2. 8 ± 0. 8 mg (left lung) and 4. 0 ± 1. 3 mg (right lung). The drug was well distributed throughout the lungs, but delivery to the native lung was in some cases suboptimal. These studies provide an important precursor to studies of the efficacy of inhaled ABLC as a prophylaxis of invasive aspergillosis after lung transplant...|$|R
