They were all so fucking serious, trying to be a voice for a generation or some shit like that, but worst of all they remained within the parameters of social acceptability. There was also a big censorship flap going on <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> <b>We</b> looked at it as a chance to catch up with our obscenity quota.|$|E

In an interview with Family Christian Stores, Meany explained that a sermon was {{the inspiration for the}} band's name: [...] "...This man was preaching about how humans are really spirit beings encased in fleshly bodies. The term [...] "earth suit" [...] came up. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> liked it, and we took it." [...] The two regularly performed at Café Joel, a small coffeehouse their church had started where Meany was music director. These performances helped cultivate their unique sound and introduced them to future band member David Rumsey.|$|E

In a 2004 interview, Coombes said [...] "It wasn't trying to be a real statement, but <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> knew that it was a big deal. Kids all around England were getting nicked for having a bit of hash on them. In Oxford that kind of thing happened quite a lot. It's all true so it was easy to write. It was a funny experience – not too funny at the time 'cause I was only 15 and shitting myself. The song has that disturbing energy. It's comparable to your heart racing.

500|$|At {{the age of}} 16, Smith {{released}} his debut album, Boomin' Words from Hell, in 1989. Of the album, Smith stated, [...] "It was the crack era, [...] and that's where all that really came from. It was all an expression about [...] Young Boys Incorporated, Mayor Coleman Young, the city we lived in and just the turmoil that our city was going through <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> <b>We</b> referred {{to the streets of}} Detroit as 'Hell' on that record. So that's where my ideas came from." [...] In 1990, Esham and James H. Smith founded the independent record label Reel Life Productions, which reissued his debut album with an alternate track listing and artwork. Esham found it difficult to develop a fanbase, because many wrote off the dark content of his lyrics and imagery as shock value, while hip hop fans did not connect to Esham's albums because of his heavy metal influences.|$|E
500|$|Since A Thousand Leaves was {{the first}} Sonic Youth album that was {{recorded}} in their own studio, the band had more time and freedom to work on it. As a result, the songs evolved unevenly and were recorded from {{an early stage of}} development. According to guitarist Lee Ranaldo, the album is [...] "a reflection of where we were <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> <b>We</b> weren't into making anything concise. We were just playing what we felt like playing. We really didn't feel like what we needed to be doing was producing another record like Goo." [...] The 11-minute song [...] "Hits of Sunshine (For Allen Ginsberg)" [...] was initially intended to be released on one of the EPs as an instrumental track, but it was ultimately included on the album with vocals. The album was co-produced by the band and Confusion Is Sex producer Wharton Tiers and mastered by Greg Calbi at Masterdisk in New York City.|$|E

500|$|Originally, songwriters George Merrill and Shannon Rubicam {{had written}} the song's demo for Janet Jackson, {{employed}} by A Records executive, John McClain. However, after hearing the song, Jackson's management passed on the song, feeling it was too weak in comparison to her other material. In an interview with Fred Bronson, Merrill expressed his feelings after learning of Jackson's decision. [...] "We were pretty upset because {{we thought it was}} perfect for her <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> <b>We</b> had written it with her completely in mind." [...] During this period, Brenda Andrews, at Almo-Irving Music, Merrill and Rubicam's publisher, played the song for Gerry Griffith, the director for R music at A and Arista Records. Griffith, who was compiling material for Houston's debut at the time, felt the song perfectly matched her sound. He soon contacted Andrews and the song's two writers and implored that they should relinquish the song to him for Houston's debut album. Griffith described his discovery of the song, and what he and Clive Davis thought of it: ...|$|E
500|$|Mega Man & Bass was {{developed}} for the Super Famicom {{after the release of}} Mega Man 8, which preceded Mega Man & Bass on the two 32-bit consoles, the PlayStation and Sega Saturn.

He wrote to his friend John Vaughan: [...] "We know but little more than we did when we left you of European affairs." [...] In the winter of 1794–95, Priestley wrote to friends that his situation was very [...] "distant from my original views" [...] and [...] "my time here is far from passing so agreeably as it did in England", yet he was [...] "very thankful for such an asylum" [...] and he attempted [...] "to make the best of my situation". In his letters to friends back in Britain, Priestley consistently referred to himself as an exile and to England as his real home. Mary was happier with the couple's situation and wrote to William Vaughan: [...] "I am happy and thankful to meet with so sweet a situation and so peaceful a retreat as the place I now write from. Dr. Priestley also likes it and of his own choice intends to settle here, which is more than I hoped for <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> came up...This country is very delightful, the prospects of wood and water more beautiful than I have ever seen before and the people plain and decent in their manners." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the tour, Black Sabbath {{returned}} to Los Angeles and again rented {{a house in}} Bel Air, where they spent nearly a year working on new material for the next album. The entire band were abusing both alcohol and other drugs, but Iommi says Osbourne [...] "was on a totally different level altogether". The band {{would come up with}} new song ideas but Osbourne showed little interest and would refuse to sing them. Pressure from the record label and frustrations with Osbourne's lack of input coming to a head, Iommi made the decision to fire Osbourne in 1979. Iommi believed the only options available were to fire Osbourne or break the band up completely. [...] "At that time, Ozzy had come to an end", Iommi said. [...] "We were all doing a lot of drugs, a lot of coke, a lot of everything, and Ozzy was getting drunk so much <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> <b>We</b> were supposed to be rehearsing and nothing was happening. It was like 'Rehearse today? No, we'll do it tomorrow.' It really got so bad that we didn't do anything. It just fizzled out." [...] Drummer Ward, who was close with Osbourne, was chosen by Tony to break the news to the singer on 27 April 1979. [...] "I hope I was professional, I might not have been, actually. When I'm drunk I am horrible, I am horrid", Ward said. [...] "Alcohol was definitely one of the most damaging things to Black Sabbath. We were destined to destroy each other.
