He is granted {{the ability to}} summon demons from Nicaea after {{experiencing}} a train accident {{on his way home}} from taking mock exams. With this newfound power he finds himself intertwined in a battle of survival against the Septentriones who seek to destroy the world. Kamiya did not express any opinions on Hibiki's character. However he was very clear to point out that despite the series being called Devil Survivor 2, it is not a sequel to a previous series but rather an independent story <b>all</b> <b>its</b> <b>own.</b>|$|E

25|$|To {{understand}} {{the history of}} the Ostfriesen and Alt-Oldenburger, an understanding of the people who bred them is helpful. Traditionally, the region settled by the Frisians was highly agricultural, based on the fertile though marshy soil. Though Hanover is geographically close by, its terrain is more hilly and their cultures were far apart. Furthermore, the region of Oldenburg was passed back and forth between Denmark and Germany. This unique cultural mixture gives the region a distinct identity <b>all</b> <b>its</b> <b>own.</b> The story of the Ostfriesen and Alt-Oldenburger is that of horse breeders responding to a dynamic market.|$|E
25|$|It is {{even more}} amazing however that all these {{societies}} had but one main aim behind their various activities, apart that is from enjoying themselves, which was {{to raise money for}} wartime charities, to help orphans, war-widows, refugee families, disabled soldiers, prisoners of war; or even to buy new boots for soldiers serving in the trenches. As Fabry puts it:‘Each of the many different societies in Elisabethville has a character <b>all</b> <b>its</b> <b>own,</b> yet a common basis: philanthropy. We need recreation, but of a sort that helps the unfortunate’.The total amount raised probably equates to hundreds of thousands of pounds today, if not millions.|$|E
25|$|This remark refers {{among other}} things to Newton's finding, {{supported}} by mathematical demonstration, that if the inverse square law applies to tiny particles, then even a large spherically symmetrical mass also attracts masses external to its surface, even close up, exactly as if <b>all</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> mass were concentrated at its center. Thus Newton gave a justification, otherwise lacking, for applying the inverse square law to large spherical planetary masses {{as if they were}} tiny particles. In addition, Newton had formulated in Propositions 43-45 of Book 1, and associated sections of Book 3, a sensitive test of the accuracy of the inverse square law, in which he showed that only where the law of force is accurately as the inverse square of the distance will the directions of orientation of the planets' orbital ellipses stay constant as they are observed to do apart from small effects attributable to inter-planetary perturbations.|$|E

[...] Sheena McNeil of Sequential Tart praised {{the first volume}} as [...] "a highly enjoyable read". Coolstreak Cartoons's Leroy Douresseaux described the series as [...] "belong to a fantasy subgenre {{sometimes referred to as}} 'pop Gothic' and relying on atmosphere and looks. Critics praised the art of Bizenghast as detailed, but did not see it as manga-styled. Anime Jumps Chad Clayton called the series [...] "heavily steeped in the gothic tradition" [...] and commented that the series [...] "successfully develops an inventive visual style <b>all</b> <b>its</b> <b>own.</b> It seems to owe more to classical art, gothic comics, and even artists like Edward Gorey than it does to manga." [...] Johanna Draper Carlson, a longtime reviewer for Publishers Weekly, found the art reminiscent [...] "of classic fantasy indy comics" [...] and noted [...] "stock elements" [...] in the story. Reviewers found Dinah's character design [...] "striking" [...] and with the potential to appeal to fans of the Gothic Lolita fashion. Criticism focused on the writing, [...] "uneven pacing", flat characters, and the varying quality of the art. Anime News Network's Zac Bertschy heavily criticized Bizenghast for the [...] "slightly modified generic monster-of-the-week cliché" [...] plot, one-dimensional characters, and art. David Welsh compared Bizenghast to [...] "a cosplay of a horror manga", and wrote: [...] "It’s got a handle on the cosmetics, but central elements of story and character are vague and underdeveloped." ...|$|E

500|$|Justin Ravitz of PopMatters {{called the}} series a [...] "cleverly trashy postmodern soap" [...] and {{credited}} it for reviving {{the soap opera}} genre, which he felt had disappeared but still suited American culture. He compared the pilot to Sex and the City, declaring it [...] "could potentially replace the departed Sex as the TV Sunday ritual for women and gay men everywhere, although DH is the guiltier pleasure of the two." [...] However, he noted the contrasting tones and dynamics between the two series, and stated that the friendships between Desperate Housewives four leading women seemed [...] "tenuous," [...] opining, [...] "the sisterly, sugar-swapping connection between the surviving women is superficial, and clearly vulnerable to shifting alliances, acts of betrayal and crowd-pleasing cat-fights." [...] Brian Lowry of Variety called the pilot [...] "oodles of fun." [...] He complimented the cast, stating that while Hatcher provides [...] "the emotional core" [...] of the series, [...] "nearly everyone is intriguing {{in one way or}} another," [...] and predicted that Eva Longoria would become the show's breakout star. However, Lowry noted that Desperate Housewives may be [...] "a little too smart for its own good" [...] and expressed concern over the series' [...] "soapy elements." [...] Tom Shales of The Washington Post praised the pilot, assessing, [...] "In visual style, witty language, borderline surrealism and overall mad attitude, [...] stands on a mountaintop <b>all</b> <b>its</b> <b>own,</b> the best new drama of the season and perhaps the best new comedy, too." [...] He complimented Cross and Hatcher's performances, as well as the writing for the Mary Alice character's narrations.

500|$|Gary Burton, of Berklee College of Music, {{noted the}} {{consistent}} innovation present throughout the album, stating: [...] "It wasn’t just one tune {{that was a}} breakthrough, it was the whole record. When new jazz styles come along, the first few attempts to do it are usually kind of shaky. Early Charlie Parker records were like this. But with Kind of Blue [...] all sound like they’re fully into it." [...] Along with the Dave Brubeck Quartet's Time Out (1959) and Coltrane's Giant Steps (1960), Kind of Blue has often been recommended by music writers as an introductory jazz album, for similar reasons: the music on both records is very melodic, and the relaxed quality of the songs makes the improvisation easy for listeners to follow, without sacrificing artistry or experimentation. Upon {{the release of the}} 50th anniversary collector's edition of the album, a columnist for All About Jazz stated [...] "Kind of Blue heralded the arrival of a revolutionary new American music, a post-bebop modal jazz structured around simple scales and melodic improvisation. Trumpeter/band leader/composer Miles Davis assembled a sextet of legendary players to create a sublime atmospheric masterpiece. Fifty years after its release, Kind of Blue continues to transport listeners to a realm <b>all</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> while inspiring musicians to create to new sounds—from acoustic jazz to post-modern ambient—in every genre imaginable." [...] Later in an interview, renowned hip-hop artist and rapper Q-Tip reaffirmed the album's reputation and influence when discussing the significance of Kind of Blue, stating [...] "It's like the Bible—you just have one in your house." [...] The 2014 album Blue by Mostly Other People Do the Killing is a note-for-note reproduction of Kind of Blue.|$|E
