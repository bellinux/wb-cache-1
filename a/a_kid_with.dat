25|$|The Villa del Pastore {{dates from}} between the eighth century BC and 79 AD. It {{is divided into two}} parts: a large outdoor area and a series of {{residential}} rooms. The garden area is bordered to the south by the semicircular wall, while on the north is a 140m long cryptoporticus which runs parallel to a colonnade on a slightly lower level. At the centre of the garden is a swimming pool (natatio) with marble staircase. In the centre of the semicircular alcove was found the statue that gives the villa its name, of marble, 65cm tall in Hellenistic style and is an old shepherd dressed in hides, carrying on his shoulders <b>a</b> <b>kid,</b> <b>with</b> a basket with grapes and bread on his left hand while in the right hand is a hare. Also in the garden to the south west is a porch 10x2m portico paved with black and white mosaic. Also a small square nympheum was found in the centre of which was placed a marble labrum.|$|E

Just after she leaves, Jerry tries to reason with the others {{that he did not know}} she had a pony and wonders why {{immigrants}} with ponies would leave Europe to come to America without ponies ("Who leaves a country packed with ponies to come to a non-pony country?") After the dinner, when Jerry's parents are leaving, his father soothes: [...] "Hey, I agree with him. Nobody likes <b>a</b> <b>kid</b> <b>with</b> a pony." [...] But Jerry receives a phone call from Uncle Leo, who informs him that Manya has died. Jerry is very upset about it, but he's also upset to learn that the funeral will be held on the same day of his softball championship.|$|E

2500|$|Jermain {{made his}} first-team debut in a League Cup match against Walsall in September 2000, scoring in a 1–0 win. Shortly thereafter, he joined Second Division club Bournemouth on a near season-long loan, where he scored in ten {{consecutive}} matches, equalling John Aldridge's and Clarrie Jordan's post-war record. He scored 18 goals in 29 league appearances for Bournemouth. West Ham manager Harry Redknapp tipped him for stardom, saying, [...] "He's done great. I sent {{him out to}} Bournemouth to get some experience playing league football and he's coped marvellously. To score 10 goals in 10 games is a terrific achievement. He's a bright lad who's full of confidence. Nothing knocks him, he's a typical goal-scorer. If he misses, he'll be there the next time looking for a goal. He's <b>a</b> <b>kid</b> <b>with</b> a big future." ...|$|E
2500|$|The novel sparked {{discussion}} {{over the}} use of plastic surgery to improve one's looks. The author said he has “received many letters from girls who have decided against having surgery since reading Uglies,” while others, sparked by Uglies, have started to ponder the ethics of changing your body’s appearance. [...] Westerfeld has theorized that “having extreme cosmetic surgery will be like buying a $1,000 Gucci bag, an indication that you are a member of the privileged class." [...] Critics echo his opinion. However, Westerfeld has also stated he “wouldn’t hesitate [...] if he had <b>a</b> <b>kid</b> <b>with</b> port-wine stain. We have all been altering our appearances ever since clothing was invented.” Other critics have stated that while altering one's appearance with plastic surgery can be ethically debatable, the benefits of it to people who have need for it are tremendous.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his second}} {{professional}} season in 1986, Walker achieved his breakthrough while playing for two A-level clubs, the Burlington Expos and West Palm Beach Expos.

[...] Walker {{caught the eye of}} his fellow Canadians, and, as a 19-year-old minor leaguer, had acquired an entourage of Canadian reporters. [...] "I know now I can hit the ball. [...] I {{have a lot of confidence}} even though I still strike out a lot. [...] I swing at too many bad pitches," [...] he contemplated. [...] Predicted West Palm Beach manager Felipe Alou, [...] "If he keeps improving the way he has the last 12 months, there`s no telling what he could do. [...] You have <b>a</b> <b>kid</b> <b>with</b> his kind of potential, they don`t last long in the minor leagues." [...] Meanwhile, the club clinched the Florida State League South division, winning by two games over the Fort Lauderdale Yankees.|$|E

2500|$|Frames {{was made}} {{over the course of}} a year and a half. Unlike on his {{previous}} album, Live It Up, DeWyze served as a producer on Frames. Toby Gad was the only producer and co-writer to collaborate with DeWyze on both albums. DeWyze described the co-writing process on Live It Up as having been like speed-dating, but said that on Frames it felt like [...] "a full on collaboration." [...] He said that the recording process felt organic and that there was no [...] "pressure [...] to make a 'certain' type of record." [...] Free of this obligation, he chose not to confine himself to only writing folk rock songs and also included the pop songs [...] "You Don't Know Me" [...] and [...] "The Ride," [...] which have been compared to the music of the Beatles, [...] "Fire Away," [...] which has been described as a combination of roots music and rockabilly, and [...] "Who Would've Known," [...] which has been described as a combination of pop and bluegrass. DeWyze specifically set out to write Frames so that it would [...] "flow as one," [...] harkening back to the kind of albums that he had listened to as <b>a</b> <b>kid</b> <b>with</b> his dad. He said, [...] "I wanted the vibe of the album as a whole to be cohesive. I wanted you to be able to sit down and listen to the whole thing and have a musical experience with it." ...|$|E
2500|$|As with season one, {{the writing}} team {{came up with}} more [...] "what if" [...] episodes for the series, like season two's [...] "Visitor", which came from the idea of, [...] "what if someone showed up and Clark began {{to believe that he}} wasn't the last person from his planet." [...] In the case of [...] "Nocturne", [...] "what if Clark had been brought up by {{different}} parents?" [...] With [...] "Nocturne", the episode is meant to be [...] "an extreme version of the Clark story". As Gough explains, [...] "Here's <b>a</b> <b>kid</b> <b>with</b> a condition, whose parents literally lock him in the basement. It's an extreme parenting episode—contrasting how these parents deal with Byron, and how the Kents deal with Clark." [...] The episode also dealt with Clark's fallibility, in the fact that Clark is only a teenager, and he does not always have all of the facts; just because he thinks he is doing the right thing {{does not necessarily mean that}} he is. In this case, Clark believes that he is saving Byron from his abusive parents. Gough clarifies, [...] "'s doing what he thinks is right, but ultimately unleashes the kid, and [...] causes damage. Just because you have the power and you think you're right doesn't always mean you're taking the right course of action." [...] Another [...] "what if" [...] episode was [...] "Witness", which originally came from the concept, [...] "what if Clark witnessed a crime and had to testify in court as to why he was standing in the middle of the road at 2 o'clock in the morning?" [...] In the end, the court angle was dropped from the storyline, with Clark making an anonymous phone call to the Sheriff and eventually having to battle the three kryptonite powered thieves that he had witnessed stealing.|$|E
