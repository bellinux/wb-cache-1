Six inch columns with a 0. 5 " <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> <b>orifice</b> were used {{during the course of the}} investigation. The spouting medium was air.

40|$|The basic Waste Collection System (WCS) design under {{consideration}} utilized air flow {{to separate the}} stool from the WCS user and to transport the fecal material to a slinger device for subsequent deposition on a storage bowel. The major parameters governing stool separation and transport {{were found to be}} the area of the air inlet orifices, the configuration of the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> <b>orifice</b> and the transport air flow. Separation force and transport velocity of the stool were studied. The developed inlet orifice configuration was found to be an effective design for providing fecal separation and transport. Simulated urine tests and female user tests in zero gravity established air flow rates between 0. 08 and 0. 25 cu sm/min (3 and 9 scfm) as satisfactory for entrapment, containment and transport of urine using an urinal. The investigation of air drying of fecal material as a substitute for vacuum drying in a WCS breadboard system showed that using baseline conditions anticipated for the shuttle cabin ambient atmosphere, flow rates of 0. 14 cu sm/min (5 cfm) were adequate for drying and maintaining biological stability of the fecal material...|$|E

Considering temperature distribution homogeneity as evaluation objective, the simulation distribution condition of three fields in longitudinal cross sections was qualitatively analyzed and experimentally verified. The heat transfer and pressure drop performance were fulfilled using numerical simulation analysis and comparison method for inlet orifice with three different shapes as circle holes, elliptic or regular hexagon. The test data of inside temperature in refrigerated transport carriage in fully loaded process showed that the highest temperature in cross sections with width direction dropped from 2. 53 ? to 1. 27 ?, and the standard deviation amplitude of temperature values dropped from 0. 642 ? to 0. 332 ?, respectively. The results also demonstrated that the flow resistance of elliptic <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> <b>orifice</b> was smaller than other two shapes, and the consumption power of refrigeration motor-pump was fewer.

The influences of the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> temperature and velocity on the air outlet temperature and heat transfer rate were investigated The <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> temperature used for the solidification of RT 25 were 10 °C, 12 °C and 14 °C and for the melting 34 °C, 36 °C and 38 °C. The selected <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> velocities were {{the same for the}} melting and solidification process: 0. 5 m/s, 1. 4 m/s and 2. 5 m/s. The results suggest that an increase of the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> velocity reduces linearly the temperature difference between the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> and outlet for the solidification process of the RT 25. Contrary, for the melting of the RT 25, increasing the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> velocity does not reduce the temperature difference linearly, increasing the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> temperature furthermore from 36 °C to 38 °C did not affect the melting time. The <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> temperature plays a significant role on the melting process, reducing linearly the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> and outlet temperature difference and the heat transfer rate, however does not influence the solidification process, similar <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> and outlet temperature difference and the heat transfer rate were obtained for all condition.

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{an evaluation of}} the effects of the spouted bed design and operating conditions on system fluiddynamics and process performance during enteric coating of hard gelatine capsules. The design parameters studied were the column diameter (150 mm and 200 mm), the included angle of the conical base, gamma (60 degrees or 40 degrees) and the presence or absence of a Venturi inserted before the <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> <b>orifice.</b> The process variables studied were the ratio between the feed flow rate of the coating suspension to the spouting gas flow rate (W(s) /W(g)), the mass of capsules loaded to the equipment (M(0)), and the ratio between the Spouting gas flow rate to the gas flow rate at minimum spouting condition (Q/Q(ms)). The response variables were the rate of increase of the capsules mass (K(1)), and the adhesion efficiency (eta). The linear regression equation for the dependent variable K, in terms of the independent variables adequately described the process with an r(2) value of 0. 872. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed that increasing of W(s) /W(g), Q/Q(ms) and gamma significantly increased the adhesion efficiency. Adhesion efficiencies higher than 90 % were achieved by selecting precise coating conditions, indicating the feasibility of the process for coating of hard gelatine capsules. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V.

Modified eddy dissipation concept (EDC) with a reduced mechanism was used to calculate the characteristic of MILD combustion.

The influences of the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> temperatures and velocities have been investigated on the charging/discharging time of the PCM panels, heating/cooling load and effectiveness over the phase transition. These parameters play a vital on determining thermal performance of an air-PCM unit. <b>Air</b> <b>inlet</b> temperatures of 34 °C, 36 °C and 38 °C and <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> velocities of 0. 6 m/s, 1. 6 m/s and 2. 5 m/s. have been studied. The increase of the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> velocity reduced the charging and discharging time, however not linearly. The time for the complete melting and solidification is substantially reduced when the velocity has been increased from 0. 6 m/s to 1. 6 m/s. The <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> temperature has been proved to be most important factor affecting the discharging time. For lower <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> velocity the cooling and heating loads achieve lower values but remain nearly constant {{over a longer period}} of time. The effectiveness reaches its highest values for the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> velocity of 0. 6 m/s for the charging and discharging processes. It has been concluded that discharging time can be extended by reducing the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> velocity and making the technology more suitable for heating and cooling applications for the buildings.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{investigates the}} effect of <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> size on (i) the flowfield {{generated}} in a dry powder inhaler, and (ii) the device-specific resistance, and the subsequent effect on powder deagglomeration. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) {{analysis was used to}} simulate the flowfield generated in an Aerolizer 1 with different <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> sizes at 30, 45, and 60 l/min. Dispersion performance of the modified inhalers was measured using mannitol powder and a multistage liquid impinger at the same flow rates. The <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> size had a varying effect on powder dispersion depending on the flow rate. At low flow rates (30 and 45 l/min), reducing the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> size increased the inhaler dispersion performance by increasing the flow turbulence and particle impaction velocities above their critical levels for maximal powder dispersion. At 60 l/min, re-ducing the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> size reduced the inhaler dispersion performance by releasing a large amount of powder from the device before the turbulence levels and particle impaction velocities could be fully developed. The results demonstrate that the maximal inhaler dispersion performance can be predicted if details of the device flowfield are known...|$|R

30|$|The <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> {{system of}} {{traditional}} engines mainly relies on absorption by the quarter-wavelength straight-tube to suppress high-frequency noise, but two major problems exist. First, the quarter-wavelength straight-tube has a narrow denoising band and cannot cover the low-frequency noise band completely, {{which results in}} incomplete noise reduction. Second, due to the greatly restricted radial size of the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> tube in the engine’s inlet system, the longer length of the traditional quarter-wavelength straight-tube {{will be difficult to}} arrange in a compact car <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> system. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new type of muffler design, which has the advantages of both the quarter-wavelength straight-tube and Helmholtz muffler, with a wider noise elimination frequency band and smaller radial size. When used in a practical automobile test, the muffler showed excellent performance in high frequency noise reduction of the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> system, and this performance was supported by the experimental data.|$|R
