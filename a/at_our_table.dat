50|$|Rose asked guitarist and pedal steel player Rich Gilbert (known for {{his work}} with Boston bands Human Sexual Response and The Zulus, and later with Tanya Donelly and Frank Black and the Catholics), to join her band for the <b>At</b> <b>Our</b> <b>Tables</b> tour.|$|R
5000|$|In September 2008, <b>At</b> <b>Our</b> <b>Tables</b> was re-released with an {{additional}} live CD of tracks off the album which was recorded at Long View Farm studios with the touring Holy Wreck band - Gilbert, Ward, and James Murray on drums. At the same session, the band recorded [...] "Live At Longview", a limited edition CD featuring re-worked versions of old songs and demo versions of some new songs, which was self-released and sold at shows.|$|R
60|$|He ate heartily of {{the supper}} I cooked. Never had {{he had such}} an {{appetite}} <b>at</b> <b>our</b> <b>table</b> in the old days. We spoke of it, {{and he said that}} he had never been so healthy in his life.|$|E
6000|$|... "Boys, {{and elderly}} gents," [...] said Vuyning, {{five days later}} at his club, {{standing}} up against the window where his coterie was gathered, and keeping out the breeze, [...] "a friend of mine from the West will dine <b>at</b> <b>our</b> <b>table</b> this evening." ...|$|E
60|$|He broke {{bread with}} us and from that moment we were all friends {{together}} and forever. After we had eaten all we could, we sat <b>at</b> <b>our</b> <b>table</b> {{for an hour and}} listened to Uncle Jesse telling us stories of his life.|$|E
5000|$|Rose {{released}} her fourth album, <b>At</b> <b>Our</b> <b>Tables,</b> in Europe through Evangeline Records on 10 March 2008. Recorded in Detroit, it was co-produced by Al Sutton, {{who has worked}} with Sheryl Crow and Kid Rock, and Eric Hoegemeyer (Charm Farm, Kid Rock, Uncle Kracker). It was recorded with members of Rose's touring band, The Holy Wreck - guitarists Bull and Goodman, Nicholas Giadone Ward on bass - and members of local bands Sponge and Detroit Cobras. Nick Lucassian of Detroit band Shipwreck Union sings a vocal duet with Rose on the track [...] "Will-O'-The-Wisp".|$|R
60|$|Many other {{advantages}} {{might be}} enumerated: For instance, {{the addition of}} some thousand carcasses in our exportation of barrelled beef; the propagation of swine's flesh, and improvement {{in the art of}} making good bacon, so much wanted among us by the great destruction of pigs, too frequent <b>at</b> <b>our</b> <b>tables,</b> which are no way comparable in taste, or magnificence to a well-grown, fat yearling child, which roasted whole will make a considerable figure at a Lord Mayor's feast, or any other public entertainment. But this, and many others I omit being studious of brevity.|$|R
5000|$|On {{her time}} at Newcomb College, Joor wrote: [...] [...] [...] many {{memories}} of those beginning days of Newcomb {{in the tiny}} vine-covered brick building that housed the college heating plant! We were so like a little family group the few of us working <b>at</b> <b>our</b> <b>tables</b> with Mr. Meyer thumping out his vases at the wheel beside us, and the big round kiln looming up in the other corner of the room, with the splashed glazing table beside it!

60|$|Kauffman {{remained}} {{for a few}} more minutes <b>at</b> <b>our</b> <b>table,</b> but he did not return to the subject. After he had left us with a somewhat stiff bow, he went and talked earnestly with Karl, the little head-waiter. Then he slowly returned.|$|E
6000|$|When [...] "Dixie" [...] {{was being}} played a dark-haired young man sprang up from somewhere with a Mosby guerrilla yell and waved frantically his soft-brimmed hat.

6000|$|... 'Yes,' replied Mr. Muzzle, 'we tried 'em <b>at</b> <b>our</b> <b>table</b> {{when they}} first come, but we couldn't keep 'em. The gal's manners is dreadful vulgar; and the boy {{breathes}} so very hard while he's eating, that we {{found it impossible to}} sit at table with him.' ...|$|E

[...] That was bizarre.|$|R
6000|$|... "With {{respect to}} our meats, all praise is supererogatory. Ask the wretched hunter of chevreuil, the poor devourer of rehbraten, {{what they think}} of the noble English haunch, that, after {{bounding}} in the Park of Knole or Windsor, exposes its magnificent flank upon some broad silver platter <b>at</b> <b>our</b> <b>tables?</b> It is enough to say of foreign venison, that THEY ARE OBLIGED TO LARD IT. Away! ours is the palm of roast; whether of the crisp mutton that crops the thymy herbage of our downs, or the noble ox who revels on lush Althorpian oil-cakes. What game is like to ours? Mans excels us in poultry, 'tis true; but 'tis only in merry England that the partridge has a flavor, that the turkey can almost se passer de truffes, that the jolly juicy goose can be eaten as he deserves.|$|R
6000|$|... "Alone," [...] Norgate admitted. [...] "It {{was not for}} me {{to invite}} a {{chaperon}} if the lady did not choose to bring one, was it, sir? As we were finishing dinner, the Prince came in. He made a scene <b>at</b> <b>our</b> <b>table</b> and ordered me to leave." ...|$|E

60|$|The detective stood {{once more}} <b>at</b> <b>our</b> <b>table.</b> My instinctive dislike {{of him was}} now an {{accomplished}} thing.

6000|$|He was kindly, and did {{his best}} to be democratic, but we {{children}} stood away from him, wondering what he was doing in our house. My mother disliked him from the start for as he took his seat <b>at</b> <b>our</b> dinner <b>table,</b> he drew from his pocket a case in which he carried a silver fork and spoon and a silver-handled knife. Our cutlery was not good enough for him! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What!" [...] cried Euphemia, [...] "go {{to a hotel}} {{the very}} first day? I {{think it would be}} dreadful! Why, I have been looking forward to this first meal with the {{greatest}} delight.

6000|$|... "In that case," [...] said King Thothmes, {{with more}} geniality in his tone, [...] "there {{can be no}} impropriety in my {{addressing}} you personally.

6000|$|... “It was an impertinence,” snapped out the Baron, his {{protruding}} eyes {{taking on}} a scandalised expression; “fancy the woman talking like that <b>at</b> <b>our</b> <b>table.</b> She almost told us we were nobodies, and I don’t believe a word of it. She is just Schmidt and nothing more. She has been talking {{to some of the}} peasants about the old Cernogratz family, and raked up their history and their stories.” ...|$|E

60|$|We were at our supper of beef stew {{and dried}} apples when he trotted in {{as if on}} the heels of a dog team, and made one of the mess <b>at</b> <b>our</b> <b>table.</b> With the freedom of the camps he {{assaulted}} our ears and claimed the fellowship of men lost in the wilds of a hash house. We embraced him as a specimen, and in three minutes we had all but died for one another as friends.|$|E
60|$|We walked {{together}} {{down the}} Avenue de Clichy, but Strickland {{was not in}} the cafe. It was too cold to sit outside, and we took our places on leather benches within. It was hot and stuffy, and the air was gray with smoke. Strickland did not come, but presently we saw the French painter who occasionally played chess with him. I had formed a casual acquaintance with him, and he sat down <b>at</b> <b>our</b> <b>table.</b> Stroeve asked him if he had seen Strickland.|$|E
60|$|It was the {{conclusion}} I arrived at {{in my own}} mind. But just why I had been chosen for the honour, especially at such a time, was a riddle.

Rodolf, you absurd boy, do you think that a Marquis is other than a man?

40|$|Citation: Rigg, Eva T. The {{action of}} {{bacteria}} on foods. Senior thesis, Kansas State Agricultural College, 1902. Introduction: The subject of Bacteriology is one which has but recently been {{brought before the}} public. The discoveries which have been made along this line in {{the last fifty years}} have been marvelous and there is no doubt but what the work is just fairly begun. There is a wide field open for investigation by scientists. The necessity of this investigation is obvious enough when we consider the close relation which bacteria bear to human life or indeed to any kind of life, either animal or vegetable. A knowledge of bacteria is necessary to every individual, for we meet them everywhere in life, they are omnipresent. The earth, the water and the air about us are supplied with them. They are very social and dwell with us in our houses, sit with us <b>at</b> <b>our</b> <b>tables,</b> cling to <b>our</b> clothing, and take up their abode in our food and drink. They are our greatest friends as without them {{it would be impossible to}} live. They are also our greatest enemies, for they are the initiative of the greater part of all the diseases and death in the world...|$|R
6000|$|My {{letter of}} {{invitation}} was from the younger of these boys, and having accepted his invitation, I was a bit in doubt as to what I should wear, for he had written, [...] "with Mrs. Roberts and myself," [...] and something {{in the tone of}} the letter had decided me to play safe. I put on evening dress, and it was well I did, for Ben met me in irreproachable dinner coat and presented his wife, a handsome and beautifully gowned woman, quite {{in the manner of a}} city-bred host.
