5|$|The demands made by {{the colonial}} {{government}} on Congolese workers during the war provoked strikes and riots from the workforce. Whites in the colony were allowed to form trade unions {{for the first time}} during the war, and their demands for better pay <b>and</b> <b>working</b> <b>conditions</b> were often emulated by black workers. In October 1941, white workers in the colony unsuccessfully attempted a general strike across the colony.|$|E
5|$|Title I, Section 7(b) {{permitted}} {{the establishment of}} standards regarding maximum hours of labor, minimum rates of pay, <b>and</b> <b>working</b> <b>conditions</b> in the industries covered by the codes, while Section 7(c) authorized the President to impose such standards on codes when voluntary agreement could not be reached.|$|E

5|$|In the Boston Police Strike, Boston police {{officers}} {{went on strike}} on September 9, 1919. They sought recognition for their trade union and improvements in wages <b>and</b> <b>working</b> <b>conditions.</b> Police Commissioner Edwin Upton Curtis denied that {{police officers}} had any right to form a union, much less one affiliated with a larger organization like the American Federation of Labor (AFL). Attempts at reconciliation between the Commissioner and the police officers, particularly {{on the part of}} Boston's Mayor Andrew James Peters, failed.|$|E
5|$|Nasser made Egypt fully {{independent}} of British influence, {{and the country}} became a major power {{in the developing world}} under his leadership. One of Nasser's main domestic efforts was to establish social justice, which he deemed a prerequisite to liberal democracy. During his presidency, ordinary citizens enjoyed unprecedented access to housing, education, jobs, health services and nourishment, as well as other forms of social welfare, while feudalistic influence waned. By the end of his presidency, employment <b>and</b> <b>working</b> <b>conditions</b> improved considerably, although poverty was still high in the country and substantial resources allocated for social welfare had been diverted to the war effort.|$|E
5|$|Curtis, {{with the}} backing of Massachusetts Governor Calvin Coolidge, {{rejected}} the Storrow Commission's proposal. He proceeded with department trials of the 19 and on September 8 found them guilty of union activity. Rather than dismiss them from the police force, he extended their suspensions. He later explained that he was giving them an opportunity to reconsider their actions and avoid discharges, which would have been irrevocable. The police union members responded that same day by voting 1134 to 2 in favor of a strike and scheduled it to start at evening roll call the next day. Their stated grounds omitted wages <b>and</b> <b>working</b> <b>conditions.</b> They said the strike's rationale was to protest the Commissioner's denial of their right to ally themselves with the AFL.|$|E
40|$|Teacher Job {{satisfaction}} wants <b>and</b> <b>working</b> <b>condition</b> wants {{have long}} been of interest to superordinates. This {{study was designed to}} investigate the hierarchy of teacher job satisfaction wants <b>and</b> <b>working</b> <b>condition</b> wants as perceived by principals, superintendents, school board presidents, National Education Association Uniserv directors, and field representatives of the American Federation of Teachers. The survey instrument was {{based on the work of}} Frederick Herzberg and Jerry Pipes. This national study was limited to randomly selected samples from the afore mentioned groups representing four geographical regions of the United States. Eighteen two-way comparisons of actual teacher wants and teacher wants as perceived by school board presidents, superintendents, principals, N. E. A. representatives and representatives of the A. F. T. were proposed. The Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient was used to determine degrees of difference or congruency. The data indicates that elementary and secondary teachers are in unison about their feelings toward Job satisfaction <b>and</b> <b>working</b> <b>condition</b> wants in the current educational environment. Principals, superintendents, and school board presidents have an accurate perception of what teachers expect out of, their Jobs.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Epidemiological {{research}} has confirmed {{the association between}} socioeconomic status (SES) and health, {{but only a few}} studies considered <b>working</b> <b>conditions</b> in this relationship. This study examined the contribution of physical <b>and</b> psychosocial <b>working</b> <b>conditions</b> in explaining the social gradient in self-rated health. METHODS: A representative sample of 10 101 employees, 5003 women and 5098 men, from the Swiss national health survey 2002 was used. SES was assessed according to the EGP-scheme. Working conditions included exposure to physical disturbances, physical strain, job insecurity, monotonous work and handling simultaneous tasks. For data analysis logistic regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: Data show a social gradient for self-rated health (SRH) as well as for physical <b>and</b> psychosocial <b>working</b> <b>conditions.</b> Logistic regression analysis controlling for age, gender and level of employment showed both physical <b>and</b> psychosocial <b>working</b> <b>conditions</b> to be significant predictors of SRH. Physical <b>and</b> psychosocial <b>working</b> <b>conditions</b> such as physical disturbances from work environment, physical strains in doing the job, monotony at work, job insecurity etc. could explain most of the social gradient of SRH in men and women. CONCLUSION: The study confirmed the relevance of modifiable physical <b>and</b> psychosocial <b>working</b> <b>conditions</b> for reducing social inequality in health. Gender differences need to be considered in epidemiological and intervention studies...|$|R
5|$|Federal {{and state}} laws {{regulating}} hours, wages, <b>and</b> <b>working</b> <b>conditions</b> changed markedly in the United States {{during the early}} 20thcentury. The state's Industrial Welfare Commission, established in 1913, ruled in 1914 that women could not work in laundries for more than 54 hours a week, and that work days were not to exceed nine hours. The commission established a minimum weekly wage of $8.25 for women working in Portland's laundries. By 1917, the work day was reduced to an eight-hour maximum. In 1920, to lower costs related to regulations {{and the rise of}} organized labor, several industrial laundries in Portland combined to form the Home Services Company. The new company lowered overhead by sharing resources, and added a pickup and delivery service popular among middle-class families. The company acquired the Yale Union Laundry in 1927.|$|E
5|$|Fremantle Prison's {{officers}} {{were known as}} warders until the early 20th century. They lived in specially built terrace houses {{within walking distance of}} the prison, and their lives were just as regimented as the prisoners. In the 1890s warders still had stringent living <b>and</b> <b>working</b> <b>conditions,</b> including ten- to twelve-hour working days. Due to a high turnover rate, many had little knowledge of either official policies or unofficial rules and traditions. The warder's role, previously unwritten, only became clearly defined in 1902. As well as guarding against escapes and enforcing discipline, they oversaw prisoner work and instructed inmates in trades. The warders were also supposed to be moral role models for prisoners, while maintaining a formal, distant, relationship.|$|E
5|$|Funding for the battleships was {{authorized}} by a 24 June 1910 act, {{which called for}} the ships to cost no more than $6,000,000. The act also specified new labor policies for their construction which put strict limits on labor hours <b>and</b> <b>working</b> <b>conditions</b> for shipyard employees. Bids were solicited only for Battleship No. 35, Texas, on 27 September 1910, while Battleship No. 34, New York, was to be built by New York Navy Yard. Bids opened for No. 35 on 1 December. Ultimately Newport News Shipbuilding Company won the contract with a bid of $5,830,000. Battleship No. 35 began construction first, on 17 April 1911, launched 18 May 1912, and completed on 12 March 1914. Battleship No. 34 was laid down on 11 September 1911, launched on 30 October 1912, and completed on 15 April 1914.|$|E

5|$|On 8 October, it was {{announced}} that postal workers had voted three to one in favour of taking strike action over job security <b>and</b> <b>working</b> <b>conditions.</b> It was later announced that a national strike would be held on Thursday 22 October and Friday 23 October. After further talks failed, more strikes were announced to take place on Thursday 29 October, Friday 30 October and Saturday 31 October. Discussions continued throughout the second wave of strikes with proposals being put to both sides, but these were overshadowed by the announcement of a third walkout on Friday 6 November and Monday 9 November. However, on 5 November it {{was announced}} that strikes had been called off until the New Year to allow time for fresh talks to take place. A resolution to the dispute was finally reached following lengthy discussions on 8 March 2010, and on 27 April it was reported that postal workers voted to accept the deal.|$|E
5|$|The {{bill had}} a more {{difficult}} time in the Senate. The National Association of Manufacturers, Chamber of Commerce, and industrialist Henry Ford all opposed its passage. Senator Bennett Champ Clark introduced an amendment to emasculate Section 7(a), but Wagner and Senator George W. Norris led the successful opposition to the change. The bulk of the Senate debate, however, turned on the bill's suspension of antitrust law. Senators William E. Borah, Burton K. Wheeler, and Hugo Black opposed any relaxation of the Sherman Antitrust Act, arguing that this would exacerbate existing severe economic inequality and concentrate wealth {{in the hands of}} the rich (a severe problem which many economists at the time believed was one of the causes of the Great Depression). Wagner defended the bill, arguing that the bill's promotion of codes of fair trade practices would help create progressive standards for wages, hours, <b>and</b> <b>working</b> <b>conditions,</b> and eliminate sweatshops and child labor. The Senate passed the amended legislation 57-to-24 on June 9.|$|E
5|$|As a result, {{the force}} {{was called in}} to manage {{industrial}} disputes on a range of occasions between 1887 and 1906. In the mining town of Lethbridge, for example, the Alberta Railway and Coal Company locked out its workforce in 1894 during an attempt to cut staff and reduce wages; a team of ten police was deployed to maintain order, in particular any risks posed by eastern European immigrants, and to mediate in the dispute. Police deployed there again in 1906 for nine months during a dispute between the company, now called the Alberta Railway and Irrigation Company, and the workforce over union recognition, pay <b>and</b> <b>working</b> <b>conditions.</b> A team of 82 regular police were reinforced by 11 special constables recruited from within the company, with an undercover constable deployed to infiltrate the strike and send back intelligence. Efforts were made to collect information on the earnings of the union leaders, probably intended for use in discrediting them. The police maintained order and escorted non-striking workers past the picket lines.|$|E

5|$|The Indian {{independence}} movement developed {{roots in the}} city when Mahatma Gandhi established two ashrams– the Kochrab Ashram near Paldi in 1915 and the Satyagraha Ashram (now Sabarmati Ashram) {{on the banks of}} the Sabarmati in 1917– which would become centres of nationalist activities. During the mass protests against the Rowlatt Act in 1919, textile workers burned down 51 government buildings across the city in protest at a British attempt to extend wartime regulations after the First World War. In the 1920s, textile workers and teachers went on strike, demanding civil rights and better pay <b>and</b> <b>working</b> <b>conditions.</b> In 1930, Gandhi initiated the Salt Satyagraha from Ahmedabad by embarking from his ashram on the Dandi Salt March. The city's administration and economic institutions were rendered inoperative in the early 1930s by the large numbers of people who took to the streets in peaceful protests, and again in 1942 during the Quit India Movement. Following independence and the partition of India in 1947, the city was scarred by the intense communal violence that broke out between Hindus and Muslims in 1947, Ahmedabad was the focus for settlement by Hindu migrants from Pakistan, who expanded the city's population and transformed its demographics and economy.|$|E
5|$|The revolutionary {{committee}} {{headed by}} Niceto Alcalá-Zamora became the provisional government, with Zamora as the President and Head of State. The Republic had broad support from {{all segments of}} society; elections in June 1931 returned {{a large majority of}} Republicans and Socialists. With the onset of the Great Depression, the government attempted to assist rural Spain by instituting an eight-hour day and giving tenure to farm workers. Land reform <b>and</b> <b>working</b> <b>conditions</b> remained important issues throughout the lifetime of the Republic. Fascism remained a reactive threat, helped by controversial reforms to the military. In December a new reformist, liberal, and democratic constitution was declared. The constitution secularised the government, and this, coupled with their slowness to respond to a wave of anti-clerical violence prompted committed Catholics to become disillusioned with the incumbent coalition government. In October 1931 Manuel Azaña became Prime Minister of a minority government. The Right won the elections of 1933 following an unsuccessful uprising by General José Sanjurjo in August 1932, who would later lead the coup that started the civil war.|$|E
