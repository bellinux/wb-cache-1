5|$|All the {{alkali metals}} have odd atomic numbers; hence, their {{isotopes}} must be either odd–odd (both proton and neutron number are odd) or odd–even (proton number is odd, but neutron number is even). Odd–odd nuclei have even mass numbers, whereas odd–even nuclei have odd mass numbers. Odd–odd primordial nuclides are rare because most odd–odd nuclei are highly unstable {{with respect to}} beta decay, because the decay products are even–even, <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>more</b> strongly bound, due to nuclear pairing effects.|$|E
5|$|When {{examining}} {{groups of}} people with obstructive sleep apnea, {{researchers have found that}} 10–20% of them meet the criteria for OHS as well. The risk of OHS is much higher in those with more severe obesity, i.e. a body mass index (BMI) of 40 kg/m2 or higher. It is twice as common in men compared to women. The average age at diagnosis is 52. American Black {{people are more likely to}} be obese than American whites, <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>more</b> likely to develop OHS, but obese Asians are more likely than people of other ethnicities to have OHS at a lower BMI as a result of physical characteristics.|$|E

25|$|The actual {{societies}} {{which would}} be encountered in a game depends on the play style; some societies are more suited for more light-hearted games (Zap-style, or the lighter end of Classic), whereas others represent a more serious threat to Alpha Complex <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>more</b> suitable for Straight or the more dark sort of Classic games.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{airborne}} forces typically lack the supplies and equipment for prolonged combat operations, <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>more</b> suited for airhead operations than for long-term occupation; furthermore, parachute operations are particularly sensitive to adverse weather conditions. Advances in helicopter technology since World War II have brought increased flexibility to {{the scope of}} airborne operations, and air assaults have largely replaced large-scale parachute operations, and (almost) completely replaced combat glider operations.|$|E
25|$|Female mate {{guarding}} is {{the act of}} guarding {{a potential}} partner away from other competing females. It occurs when women mate with males that are seen as desirable due to their paternal value, see mate value, <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>more</b> likely to attract other females. Over 50% of females asked in a survey admitted to poaching (see Mate poaching) another woman’s’ mate, as well as 50% of men admitting that they were unfaithful when presented with a poaching female. It is therefore a balancing act between having close female friendships that can help with childcare, and the sharing of resources, but not letting friends become too close that they {{have easy access to}} poach successfully. Females have therefore come up with tactics to ward of any potential threats.|$|E

25|$|Outbreaks of canine {{distemper}} continue to occur throughout the United States and elsewhere, and {{are caused by}} many factors. These factors include the overpopulation of dogs and the irresponsibility of pet owners. The overpopulation of dogs is a national problem that {{organizations such as the}} Humane Society and ASPCA face every day. This problem is even greater within areas such as Arizona, owing to the vast amount of rural land. An unaccountable number of strays that lack vaccinations reside in these areas <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>more</b> susceptible to diseases such as {{canine distemper}}. These strays act as a host for the virus, spreading it throughout the surrounding area, including urban areas. Puppies and dogs that have not received their shots can then be infected if in a place where many dogs interact, such as a dog park.|$|E
25|$|The {{adaptive}} foraging {{hypothesis is}} a proposed pre-copulatory explanation in which females assess the nutritional {{value of a}} male compared to the male's value as a mate. Starving females are usually in poor physical condition <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>more</b> likely to cannibalize a male than to mate with him. Among mantises, cannibalism by female Pseudomantis albofimriata improves fecundity, overall growth, and body condition. Among spiders, Dolomedes triton females in need of additional energy and nutrients for egg development choose to consume the closest nutritional source, even if this means cannibalizing a potential mate. In Agelenopsis pennsylvanica and Lycosa tarantula, {{a significant increase in}} fecundity, egg case size, hatching success, and survivorship of offspring has been observed when hungry females choose to cannibalize smaller males before copulating with larger, genetically superior males. This reproductive success was largely due to the increased energy uptake by cannibalizing males and investing that additional energy in the development of larger, higher-quality egg cases. In D. triton, post-copulatory sexual cannibalism was observed in the females that had a limited food source; these females copulated with the males and then cannibalized them.|$|E
25|$|Because {{ultrasound}} imaging techniques do not employ ionizing radiation to generate images (unlike radiography, and CT scans), {{they are generally}} considered safer <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>more</b> common in obstetrical imaging. The progression of pregnancies can be thoroughly evaluated with less concern about damage from the techniques employed, allowing early detection and diagnosis of many fetal anomalies. Growth can be assessed over time, important in patients with chronic disease or pregnancy-induced disease, and in multiple pregnancies (twins, triplets, etc.). Color-flow Doppler ultrasound measures the severity of peripheral vascular disease and is used by cardiologists for dynamic evaluation of the heart, heart valves and major vessels. Stenosis, for example, of the carotid arteries may be a warning sign for an impending stroke. A clot, embedded deep {{in one of the}} inner veins of the legs, can be found via ultrasound before it dislodges and travels to the lungs, resulting in a potentially fatal pulmonary embolism. Ultrasounds is useful as a guide to performing biopsies to minimise damage to surrounding tissues and in drainages such as thoracentesis. Small, portable ultrasound devices now replace peritoneal lavage in trauma wards by non-invasively assessing for the presence of internal bleeding and any internal organ damage. Extensive internal bleeding or injury to the major organs may require surgery and repair.|$|E

500|$|Two film {{industry}} trade journals gave the film positive reviews. Todd McCarthy of Variety felt Adamson's direction had a [...] "surer sense of cinematic values" [...] and praised the improved special effects, the [...] "timeless" [...] locations and production design. On the performances, he felt [...] "the four kids overall have more character <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>more</b> {{interesting to watch}} than they were before, and Italian actor Castellitto registers strongly with evil that's implacable but not overplayed." [...] Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter noted the film was darker than its predecessor, with [...] "the loss of innocence theme ... significantly deepened". He highlighted Peter Dinklage's performance, which [...] "outmaneuver the title character as Narnia's most colorful new inhabitant";.|$|E
500|$|Stability of {{isotopes}} {{is affected}} by the ratio of protons to neutrons, and also by the presence of certain [...] "magic numbers" [...] of neutrons or protons that represent closed and filled quantum shells. These quantum shells correspond to a set of energy levels within the shell model of the nucleus; filled shells, such as the filled shell of 50 protons for tin, confers unusual stability on the nuclide. Of the 254 known stable nuclides, only four have both an odd number of protons and odd number of neutrons: hydrogen-2 (deuterium), lithium-6, boron-10 and nitrogen-14. Also, only four naturally occurring, radioactive odd–odd nuclides have a half-life over a billion years: potassium-40, vanadium-50, lanthanum-138 and tantalum-180m. Most odd–odd nuclei are highly unstable with respect to beta decay, because the decay products are even–even, <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>more</b> strongly bound, due to nuclear pairing effects.|$|E
500|$|The {{recovery}} of higher-resolution ice cores spanning {{more of the}} past 1,000,000 years by the ongoing EPICA project may help shed more light on the matter. A new, high-precision dating method developed by the team allows better correlation of the various factors involved and puts the ice core chronologies on a stronger temporal footing, endorsing the traditional Milankovitch hypothesis, that climate variations are controlled by insolation in the northern hemisphere. The new chronology is inconsistent with the [...] "inclination" [...] theory of the 100,000-year cycle. The establishment of leads and lags against different orbital forcing components with this method—which uses the direct insolation control over nitrogen-oxygen ratios in ice core bubbles—is in principle a great improvement in the temporal resolution of these records and another significant validation of the Milankovitch hypothesis. An international climate modelling exercise (Abe-ouchi et al., Nature, 2013) demonstrated that climate models can replicate the 100,000-year cyclicity given the orbital forcing and carbon dioxide levels of the late Pleistocene. The isostatic history of ice sheets was implicated in mediating the 100,000-year response to the orbital forcing. Larger ice sheets are lower in elevation because they depress the continental crust upon which they sit, <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>more</b> vulnerable to melting.|$|E

2500|$|This {{conflict}} is easily resolved when the domain name owner actually uses the domain {{to compete with}} the trademark owner. Cybersquatting, however, does not involve competition. Instead, an unlicensed user registers a domain name identical to a trademark, and offers to sell the domain to the trademark owner. Typosquatters—those registering common misspellings of trademarks as domain names—have also been targeted successfully in trademark infringement suits. [...] "Gripe sites", on the other hand, tend to be protected as free speech, <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>more</b> difficult to attack as trademark infringement.|$|E
2500|$|The contest {{has long}} been accused by some of {{political}} bias; the perception is that judges and televoters allocate points based on their nation's relationship to the other countries, rather than the musical merits of the songs. According to one study of Eurovision voting patterns, certain countries tend to form [...] "clusters" [...] or [...] "cliques" [...] by frequently voting in the same way. Another study concludes that as of 2006, voting blocs have, {{on at least two}} occasions, crucially affected the outcome of the contest. On the other hand, others argue that certain countries allocate disproportionately high points to others because of similar musical tastes and cultures and because they speak similar languages, <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>more</b> likely to appreciate each other's music.|$|E
2500|$|In her report, Abbey {{also argues}} that “men may be socialized to attend more {{carefully}} than women to potentially sexual cues <b>and</b> <b>are,</b> <b>therefore,</b> <b>more</b> likely to interpret a variety of stimuli {{as a sign of}} sexual intent.” Men tend to read into women’s actions more sexually than women would read into men’s actions. For example, men might find tickling to mean that the woman is very interested while to women it might just be a way of flirting or joking around. This can lead to some problems and possibly awkward encounters. Abbey also says that men tend to have a more sexual outlook and oftentimes perceive situations more sexually than women might; therefore, men could then feel that sexual advances are appropriate and justified whereas a woman may not be thinking so.|$|E

2500|$|Deuterium {{is one of}} {{only five}} stable nuclides with an odd number of protons and an odd number of neutrons. ( [...] , , , , also, the {{long-lived}} radioactive nuclides , , , [...] occur naturally.) Most odd-odd nuclei are unstable with respect to beta decay, because the decay products are even-even, <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>more</b> strongly bound, due to nuclear pairing effects. Deuterium, however, benefits from having its proton and neutron coupled to a spin-1 state, which gives a stronger nuclear attraction; the corresponding spin-1 state does not exist in the two-neutron or two-proton system, due to the Pauli exclusion principle which would require one or the other identical particle with the same spin to have some other different quantum number, such as orbital angular momentum. But orbital angular momentum of either particle gives a lower binding energy for the system, primarily due to increasing distance of the particles in the steep gradient of the nuclear force. In both cases, this causes the diproton and dineutron nucleus to be unstable.|$|E
2500|$|The {{issue of}} far more {{consequence}} {{brought to the}} fore {{as a result of}} this game was that of access to equal and fair competition, the access to the chance to compete for and win the [...] "Big Game" [...] in the first place. There was a tremendous amount of criticism surrounding the 2010 Fiesta Bowl team pairing. Many argued that the BCS was terrified of a non-BCS team defeating a BCS team and bringing into question ever more starkly the entire premise of the BCS's existence, that teams from BCS Conferences are somehow superior to non-BCS teams <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>more</b> deserving to play for the [...] "National Championship". A defeat of a top ranked BCS team would help affirm that this premise was false – as the impressive record of non-BCS teams in BCS Bowls (4–2 against BCS AQ teams) already hints at. Consequently, the BCS paired TCU and BSU together so that the possibility of an embarrassment of an AQ school, and by extension the entire system's validity, was eliminated. Boise State ended up beating TCU in the Fiesta Bowl, 17-10.|$|E
