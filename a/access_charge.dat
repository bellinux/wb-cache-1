40|$|The {{analysis}} {{in this paper}} considers the problem of excessive originating and terminating <b>access</b> <b>charges</b> imposed by some competitive local exchange carriers (CLECs) in the United States. The problem arises because the current institutional structure provides an incentive for CLECs to <b>charge</b> for <b>access</b> service in excess of what a competitive market would indicate. An examination of the data shows {{that the problem of}} excessive <b>access</b> <b>charges</b> imposed by CLECs is very real. An analysis of terminating <b>access</b> <b>charges</b> for September 2000 reveals that average terminating <b>access</b> <b>charges</b> billed to three interexchange carriers (IXCs) are excessive, exceeding average price cap regulated incumbent local exchange carrier (ILEC) <b>access</b> <b>charges</b> by 370 - 470 percent. Some solutions to the problem are offered including a first-best solution whereby the calling party would be required to pay for originating access service and have the receiving party pay for terminating access service. A second-best solution would be to limit CLEC's <b>access</b> <b>charges</b> to an IXC to be {{less than or equal to}} the <b>access</b> <b>charges</b> of the ILEC with which it directly competes for customers. <b>Access</b> <b>charges</b> CLECS Federal Communication Commission Telecommunications Policy...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: We aim {{to clarify}} the role of <b>access</b> <b>charges</b> under two-way network competition, {{employing}} a reduced-form approach. Retaining the key features of specific network competition models but imposing less structure, we analyze the impact of changes in <b>access</b> <b>charges</b> on linear and non-linear retail prices. We derive sufficient conditions for usage fees to be increasing (and subscriber charges to be decreasing) in <b>access</b> <b>charges.</b> These conditions are shown to be satisfied only under rather restrictive assumptions on the demand for calls, suggesting that implementing collusion by inflating <b>access</b> <b>charges</b> {{is likely to be}} non-feasible...|$|R
50|$|The pricing {{structure}} for UK directory enquiries was reformed by Ofcom on 1 July 2015. Call charges consist of an <b>Access</b> <b>Charge</b> and a Service Charge.

40|$|Both senders and {{receivers}} {{of telecommunications}} messages derive benefits, creating {{the possibility of}} externalities. We explore whether intercarrier compensation (i. e., <b>access</b> <b>charges)</b> can induce carriers to internalize these external effects. In important settings, <b>access</b> <b>charges</b> are irrelevant. Where they are relevant, <b>access</b> <b>charges</b> can induce an efficient ratio of off-net send and receive prices [...] taking their sum as given [...] but cannot induce the correct sum. The latter requires a mechanism for cross-carrier internalization, such as repeat play or pricing policies contingent on one another.

40|$|After the {{deregulation}} of the German electricity markets, network <b>access</b> <b>charges</b> are based on contractual arrangements between energy producers and industrial consumers.

50|$|One {{consequence}} of the breakup was that local residential service rates, which were formerly subsidized by long distance revenues, began to rise faster than the rate of inflation. Long-distance rates, meanwhile, fell both due {{to the end of}} this subsidy and increased competition. The FCC established a system of <b>access</b> <b>charges</b> where long distance networks paid the more expensive local networks both to originate and terminate a call. In this way, the implicit subsidies of the Bell System became explicit post-divestiture. These <b>access</b> <b>charges</b> became a source of strong controversy as one company after another sought to arbitrage the network and avoid these fees. In 2002 the FCC declared that Internet service providers would be treated as if they were local and would not have to pay these <b>access</b> <b>charges.</b> This led to VoIP service providers arguing {{that they did not have}} to pay <b>access</b> <b>charges,</b> resulting in significant savings for VoIP calls. The FCC was split on this issue for some time; VoIP services that utilized IP but in every other way looked like a normal phone call generally had to pay <b>access</b> <b>charges,</b> while VoIP services that looked more like applications on the Internet and did not interconnect with the public telephone network did not have to pay <b>access</b> <b>charges.</b> However, an FCC order issued in December 2011 declared that all VoIP services would have to pay the charges for nine years, at which point all <b>access</b> <b>charges</b> would then be phased out.|$|R

40|$|<b>Access</b> <b>charges</b> to {{the railway}} infrastructures, and in {{particular}} of the high speed lines, poses many theoretical and practical questions. Besides the need to decide whether {{it is better to}} apply a principle of marginal cost or a full cost approach, a difficulty arises with regard to the possibilities of competition between various operators. France is especially affected by this problem since <b>access</b> <b>charges</b> are particularly high {{while at the same time}} competition is non-existent. Is this absence of competition explained by the high level of <b>access</b> <b>charges?</b> After describing the principles which underlie the pricing scheme for high speed trains in France, this paper attempts to find out if these tolls constitute a barrier to entry. After building a model that summarizes the components of supply and demand on the Paris-Lyon journey, this paper shows that the considerations relating to demand (peak hour or off-peak hour) are more fundamental than <b>access</b> <b>charges,</b> which do not in themselves constitute a barrier to entry. Barriers exist, but they involve <b>access</b> <b>charges</b> in relation to the allocation of slots which would make it possible to guarantee certain profitability to a new entrant.
