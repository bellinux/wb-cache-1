5|$|Another {{development}} was the Dreyer Fire-control Table that combined {{the functions of}} the Dumaresq <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>range</b> clock in the transmission stations. Hercules was probably fitted with a prototype table when its inventor, Commander Frederic Dreyer, was assigned to the ship at the end of 1911. The ship retained that instrument at least until February 1916, although it had been replaced by a Mark I table by 1918. Colossus received her Mark I table by early 1916.|$|E
5|$|The Samba was not {{the only}} Talbot model to see {{customer}} interest waning; as the 1980s progressed, all Talbots began to sell rather poorly <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>range</b> was gradually phased out. Peugeot had been working on developing a replacement for the Samba as late as 1984, which would have been based on the forthcoming Citroen AX, but this project was abandoned as Peugeot took the decision to phase out the Talbot brand, and the Peugeot 205 was proving so popular that Peugeot felt little need for a third car of this size within the group.|$|E

5|$|The Swiss Ornithological Institute {{has set up}} a {{monitoring}} program to record breeding populations of woodland birds. This has shown that deadwood is an important habitat requirement for the black woodpecker, great spotted woodpecker, middle spotted woodpecker, lesser spotted woodpecker, European green woodpecker and Eurasian three-toed woodpecker. Populations of all these species increased by varying amounts in the period 1990 to 2008. During this period, the amount of deadwood in the forest increased <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>range</b> of the white-backed woodpecker enlarged as it extended eastwards. With the exception of the green and middle spotted woodpeckers, the increase in the amount of deadwood {{is likely to be the}} major factor explaining the population increase of these species.|$|E
5|$|Altdorfer's primary {{point of}} {{reference}} in his research was probably Hartmann Schedel's Nuremberg Chronicle (Schedelsche Weltchronik), an illustrated world history published in Nuremberg in 1493. Schedel was a physician, humanist, historian and cartographer, and his Chronicle {{was one of the}} first books produced on the printing press. With a heavy reliance on the Bible, it recounts the seven ages of human history, from Creation to the birth of Christ and ending with the Apocalypse. Altdorfer's statistics for the battle of Issus mirror those of Schedel. Furthermore, the errors in Schedel's maps of the Mediterranean and Northern Africa are also present in The Battle of Alexander at Issus: the island of Cyprus is noticeably oversized, and both the mountain rise in the painting's centre <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>range</b> adjacent to the Nile do not exist. Since the Chronicle describes Alexander's victory over the Persians in terms of its proximity to Tarsus and omits mention of Issus, it is likely that the cityscape by the sea is intended to be the former city rather than the latter. Issus in the 16th century was minor and relatively unknown, whereas Tarsus was renowned for its having been a major centre of learning and philosophy in Roman times. Tarsus was also said to be the birthplace of the Apostle Paul, which may explain the presence of the church towers in Altdorfer's portrayal. Another source may have been the writings of Quintus Curtius Rufus, a 1st-century Roman historian who presents inflated figures for the number of killed and taken prisoner and the sizes of the armies.|$|E
5|$|An {{experimental}} fire-control {{director was}} fitted {{in the forward}} spotting top and evaluated in May 1910. This electrically provided data to the turrets via pointers, which the turret crew were to follow. The director layer fired the guns simultaneously which aided in spotting the shell splashes and minimised {{the effects of the}} roll on the dispersion of the shells. The director was subsequently removed, but Superb had a production model installed by May 1915 and both Temeraire and Bellerophon received theirs by May 1916. The latter's director, however, was not fully installed by the date of the Battle of Jutland {{at the end of the}} month and she fought without it. Furthermore, they were fitted with Mark I Dreyer Fire-control Tables by early 1916 in the transmission stations. It combined the functions of the Dumaresq <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>range</b> clock.|$|E

5|$|Fire control {{technology}} advanced quickly {{during the}} years immediately preceding World War I {{and the development of}} the Dreyer Fire Control Table was one such advance. It combined the functions of the Dumaresq <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>range</b> clock and a simplified version, the Mk I, was fitted to the Invincibles during refits in 1915–16. The more important development was the director firing system. This consisted of a fire control director mounted high in the ship which electrically provided gun data to the turrets via pointers, which the turret crewmen only had to follow. The director officer fired the guns simultaneously, which aided in spotting the shell splashes and minimised the effects of the roll on the dispersion of the shells. Invincible was the first battlecruiser to receive this system during her refit from April to August 1914, but its installation was interrupted by the outbreak of the war and it was not fully working until after the Battle of the Falkland Islands in November. Indomitable and Inflexible didn't receive their systems until May 1916, immediately before the Battle of Jutland.|$|E
5|$|Fire-control {{technology}} advanced quickly {{during the}} years between the St Vincents' commissioning {{and the start of}} World War I and the most important development was the director firing system. Mounted high in the ship, a fire-control director electrically provided data to the turrets via a pointer on a dial, which the turret crewmen only had to follow. The director layer fired the guns simultaneously, which aided in spotting the shell splashes and minimised the effects of the roll on the dispersion of the shells. While the exact dates of installation are unknown, St Vincent was equipped with a director by December 1915 and the others by May 1916. The ships were fitted with Mark I Dreyer Fire-control Tables in the transmission stations by early 1916, which combined the functions of the Dumaresq <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>range</b> clock.|$|E
