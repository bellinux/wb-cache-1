I have traced the {{family history of}} the man who calls himself Freddy Mike, and I find beyond question, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> say even on his own admission, {{that there is not a}} shred or shadow of foundation for his story from beginning to end. He said that he had a twin brother. He had no twin brother. He said that the twin brother or a friend of the twin brother was in Eastbourne that night. There were no such people, and the whole story is an invention because, having known John Williams in the past, he did not like to think of his being hanged." ...|$|E
500|$|In other cases, errors {{may have}} been wrongly {{attributed}} to Aristotle. Katrin Weigmann wrote [...] " [...] statement that flies have four legs was repeated in natural history texts {{for more than a}} thousand years despite the fact that a little counting would have proven otherwise." [...] However, the historian and philosopher of biology John S. Wilkins notes that Aristotle did not say [...] "all flies have four legs"; he wrote that one particular animal, the ephemeron or mayfly, [...] "moves with four feet and four wings: <b>and,</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> observe in passing, this creature is exceptional not only in regard to the duration of its existence, whence it receives its name, but also because though a quadruped it has wings also." [...] Mayflies do in fact walk on four legs, the front pair not being adapted for walking, so, Wilkins concludes, Aristotle was correct.|$|E
500|$|Activity was {{happening}} {{elsewhere on the}} field, however, and as the battle drew to a close, Napoleon's Middle Guard launched {{an assault on the}} British line, to the 52nd's left, and were met by a number of regiments including the 1st Foot Guards, who repulsed the 3rd Chasseurs, but had to themselves retreat when the 4th Chasseurs moved forward to threaten their left. The 52nd, under Sir John Colborne, wheeled to the left, deploying parallel to the French column, and fired volleys against their left flank. William Hay, a Light Dragoon watching from the right, later recalled that [...] "so well-directed a fire was poured in, that down the bank the Frenchmen fell <b>and,</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> say, the battle of Waterloo was gained." [...] Seeing the 52nd begin an advance, Wellington reputedly ordered [...] "Go on, Colborne, they won't stand!"; the battalion then advanced diagonally across the field. When this was later followed by a bayonet charge by all of General Adam's 3rd Brigade, the Guard broke, forced into full retreat. Having pursued the French down the escarpment of Mont St Jean, the 52nd crossed the valley floor (that {{at the start of the}} battle had separated the armies) and on the other side attacked a square of Old Guard (part of the personal body guard of Napoleon,) that had formed up to the British right of the inn La Belle Alliance and forced it to retreat.|$|E

500|$|Many {{of these}} attacks are {{considered}} to have been scurrilous, including suggestions that {{he was planning to}} [...] "crown himself king" [...] and [...] "grooming John Quincy as heir to the throne". However, Peter Shaw has argued that: [...] "he inevitable attacks on Adams, crude as they were, stumbled on a truth that he did not admit to himself. He was leaning toward monarchy and aristocracy (as distinct from kings and aristocrats) at the time he wrote 'Davila', though he did not directly reveal this in its essays. Decidedly, sometime after he became vice-president, Adams concluded that the United States would have to adopt a hereditary legislature and a monarch... and he outlined a plan by which state conventions would appoint hereditary senators while a national one appointed a president for life." [...] In contradiction to such notions, Adams asserted in a letter to Thomas Jefferson: [...] "If you suppose that I have ever had a design or desire of attempting to introduce a government of King, Lords and Commons, or in other words an hereditary Executive, or an hereditary Senate, either into the government of the United States, or that of any individual state, in this country, you are wholly mistaken. There is not such a thought expressed or intimated in any public writing or private letter of mine, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> safely challenge all of mankind to produce such a passage and quote the chapter and verse." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cary wrote [...] "there was {{not doubt}} of the {{legality}} of the catch", Jack Fingleton called it [...] "one of the most unfortunate decisions {{in the history of the}} Tests." [...] and most English pressmen shared their view. However, E.W. Swanton reported [...] "The Don waited for the decision, confident that it was a bump ball, and the umpire Borwick, ruled 'not out'". In the Australian dressing rooms the players were divided as to whether he was out or not. When Bradman returned at the end of the session he said he had played down on a yorker and to Ray Lindwall there was no doubt as to his sincerity. In the end the batsman was given the benefit of the doubt, but it had repercussions. Bradman recovered his form and hit 159 runs in 160 minutes before he was out for 187, which set up Australia's victory in the First Test by an innings and 332 runs. This was a morale-booster for a young team with eight debutants, but if Bradman had been out the Australian total would have been less, England would have batted on a flat wicket and the thunderstorm that wrecked the wicket would have caught Australia in their second innings. 'As he walked past Bradman at the end of the over Hammond glared at Bradman and said tensely, [...] "That's a fine way to start a Test series"'. The England captain was furious that Bradman had not walked in what was supposed to be a post-war goodwill tour and refused to talk to him for the rest of the series except to call the toss. To the press he was more diplomatic [...] "I thought it was a catch but the umpire may have been right <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> have been wrong" [...] Bradman, 38 years old and suffering from fibrositis, had been advised not to play by his doctor and a cheap dismissal might have made him retire, especially if he had been caught on a sticky wicket in the second innings. Keith Miller later wrote [...] "that decision was subsequently admitted in nearly every quarter to have been erroneous".|$|E
