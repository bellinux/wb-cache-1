5|$|It is also {{possible}} for erectile dysfunction to exist not {{as a direct result}} of SCI but due to factors such as major depression, diabetes, or drugs such as those taken for spasticity. Finding <b>and</b> <b>treating</b> the root cause may alleviate the problem. For example, men who experience erectile problems as the result of a testosterone deficiency can receive androgen replacement therapy.|$|E
5|$|Some probiotics {{have been}} shown to be {{beneficial}} in reducing both the duration of illness and the frequency of stools. They may also be useful in preventing <b>and</b> <b>treating</b> antibiotic associated diarrhea. Fermented milk products (such as yogurt) are similarly beneficial. Zinc supplementation appears to be effective in both treating and preventing diarrhea among children in the developing world.|$|E

5|$|After {{the lethal}} second wave struck in late 1918, new cases dropped abruptly– almost to nothing after {{the peak in}} the second wave. In Philadelphia, for example, 4,597 {{people died in the}} week ending 16 October, but by 11 November, {{influenza}} had almost disappeared from the city. One explanation for the rapid decline of the lethality of the disease is that doctors simply got better at preventing <b>and</b> <b>treating</b> the pneumonia that developed after the victims had contracted the virus, although John Barry stated in his book that researchers have found no evidence to support this.|$|E
5|$|Atangana {{won over}} other chiefs and headmen through gifts, tax cuts, flattery, and {{intervention}} on their behalf. He lavished attention on visitors {{from out of}} town, letting them stay at his palace and use his horses, <b>and</b> <b>treating</b> them to feasts. In addition to flattering them, this allowed him to monitor their activities and dealings with the colonial authorities. His clerk appointees in Jaunde informed him of the doings of both the Germans and his subjects. Atangana gained {{a substantial amount of}} wealth. He owned workshops and sold produce from five plantations to provision impressed railway construction workers.|$|E
5|$|Front {{tracking}} {{methods have}} long been used in fluid dynamics to model and track the motion of boundaries between different materials, of steep gradients in material properties such as weather fronts, or of shock waves within a single material. These methods involve deriving the equations of motion of the boundary, and using them to directly simulate {{the motion of the}} boundary, rather than simulating the underlying fluid <b>and</b> <b>treating</b> the boundary as an emergent property of the fluid. The same methods {{can also be used to}} simulate the curve-shortening flow, even when the curve undergoing the flow is not a boundary or shock.|$|E

She identified the entities (DIS <b>and</b> <b>TREAT)</b> by using MeSH, and {{the relationships between the}} entities by using a neural network based on five graphical models with lexical, syntactic, and semantic features.

30|$|Evidently, the {{adsorption}} process {{consisted of two}} main reaction stages; a fast adsorption followed by a slow adsorption. The fast Na+ {{adsorption process}} by the natural <b>and</b> <b>treated</b> zeolite material occurred among the 100  min. The rapid process is then followed by a slow adsorption that gradually decreased as contact time increased. After 480  min, the Na+ adsorption process almost reached the maximum adsorption capacity under the experimental conditions for natural <b>and</b> <b>treated</b> zeolite material. A similar behaviour was observed and reported by Argun (2008) and Bektaş and Kara (2004) for natural <b>and</b> <b>treated</b> clinoptilolite.|$|R
5|$|In 2017, the Series again drew criticism, {{this time}} for {{allowing}} games to be called early because of weather <b>and</b> <b>treating</b> them as official games. After the Yokohama BayStars lost a 5-inning game in the 2017 Central League Climax Series, Coskrey wrote that playoff games should never end like in that manner. He suggested that NPB could have easily suspended the game and resumed where it left off {{the next day or}} even postponed the game entirely until the next day.|$|E
5|$|In March 2015, a 173rd Airborne {{battalion}} of around 600 American paratroopers headed to Ukraine to train Ukrainian national guard troops. The training {{took place at}} the Yavoriv training center near the western Ukrainian city of Lviv. The 173rd Airborne paratroopers trained the Ukrainians on how to better defend themselves against Russian and rebel artillery and rockets. Training also included securing roads, bridges, and other infrastructure <b>and</b> <b>treating</b> and evacuating casualties. This program was known as Fearless Guardian which was congressionally approved under the Global Contingency Security Fund. Under the program, the United States trained three battalions of Ukrainian troops over a six-month period.|$|E
5|$|In general relativity, the apsides of any orbit (the {{point of}} the {{orbiting}} body's closest approach to the system's center of mass) will precess—the orbit is not an ellipse, but akin to an ellipse that rotates on its focus, resulting in a rose curve-like shape (see image). Einstein first derived this result by using an approximate metric representing the Newtonian limit <b>and</b> <b>treating</b> the orbiting body as a test particle. For him, {{the fact that his}} theory gave a straightforward explanation of Mercury's anomalous perihelion shift, discovered earlier by Urbain Le Verrier in 1859, was important evidence that he had at last identified the correct form of the gravitational field equations.|$|E

It consisted of removing accumulated dirt and an old coating of black wax, repatinating the bronze surface to return it to its original colour <b>and</b> <b>treating</b> it with a clear wax as protection from pollution and the elements. The bas reliefs on the pedestal were also cleaned and treated, as was the pedestal itself.|$|E
5|$|Just {{like most}} punk songs, Girlschool’s lyrics usually have short and direct texts, often {{reflecting}} the wild rock 'n' roll lifestyle <b>and</b> <b>treating</b> sex and romance {{as seen from}} a feminine point of view, {{with the use of}} reverse sexism and tongue-in-cheek sense of humour. Some of their songs deal also with more serious matters, such as exploitation and abuse of women, murder, addiction, the destruction of the environment, social and political issues.|$|E

5|$|Although not {{all people}} with Tourette's have comorbid conditions, most Tourette's {{patients}} presenting for clinical care at specialty referral centers may exhibit symptoms of other conditions {{along with their}} motor and phonic tics. Associated conditions include attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADD or ADHD), obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), learning disabilities and sleep disorders. Disruptive behaviors, impaired functioning, or cognitive impairment in patients with comorbid Tourette's and ADHD may {{be accounted for by}} the comorbid ADHD, highlighting the importance of identifying <b>and</b> <b>treating</b> comorbid conditions. Disruption from tics is commonly overshadowed by comorbid conditions that present greater interference to the child. Tic disorders in the absence of ADHD {{do not appear to be}} associated with disruptive behavior or functional impairment, while impairment in school, family, or peer relations is greater in patients who have more comorbid conditions and often determines whether therapy is needed.|$|E
5|$|Antibiotics are {{not usually}} used for gastroenteritis, {{although}} they are sometimes recommended if symptoms are particularly severe or if a susceptible bacterial cause is isolated or suspected. If antibiotics are to be employed, a macrolide (such as azithromycin) is preferred over a fluoroquinolone due to higher rates {{of resistance to the}} latter. Pseudomembranous colitis, usually caused by antibiotic use, is managed by discontinuing the causative agent <b>and</b> <b>treating</b> it with either metronidazole or vancomycin. Bacteria and protozoans that are amenable to treatment include Shigella Salmonella typhi, and Giardia species. In those with Giardia species or Entamoeba histolytica, tinidazole treatment is recommended and superior to metronidazole. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of antibiotics in young children who have both bloody diarrhea and fever.|$|E
