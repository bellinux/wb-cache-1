40|$|The use of by-plot {{coefficient}} of variation (CV) has not been evaluated in precision <b>agricultural</b> <b>work.</b> This <b>study</b> evaluated the relationship between CVs determined from normalized-difference vegetative index (NDVI) sensor readings, plant population, and sensing direction on NDVI values. Randomly selected plots, measuring 1 m 2 (2003) and 3 m 2 (2004), were established for this study. Plots in 2004 were divided into three 1 m 2 subplots with, 0 and 120 kg ha− 1 fall-applied N, and 80 kg ha− 1 topdress nitrogen (N). Sensor reading of subplots were taken at Feekes 5 and 7 using the Green Seeker hand-held sensor. Results showed {{that the relationship between}} vegetative RI (RINDVI) and harvest RI (RIHarvest) improved with increasing CV values. The prediction of RIHarvest was improved when CV was integrated into the RINDVI calculation. RIHarvest can be better predicted with RINDVI when the CV of spectral radiance measurements is used in the RINDVI equation...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{this paper}} is to introduce the agricultural ergonomics and to show the importance of it in improving the <b>agricultural</b> <b>works.</b> Background: Despite of rapid advancement of technologies and adoption of modern mechanical equipments at farms in Korea, most of <b>agricultural</b> <b>works</b> have still remained manual and thus have {{regarded as one of the}} hardest works. With aging and feminization in rural areas, the need to improve <b>agricultural</b> <b>works</b> has grown quite much. Agricultural ergonomics have been known as a good tool in improving <b>agricultural</b> <b>works</b> around the world. Recently Korean government initiated a national program of providing assistive equipments to help farmers and a few ergonomists started to apply agricultural ergonomics in our rural villages as a part of this program. Method: This study reviewed how Ergonomics was used for the <b>agricultural</b> <b>work.</b> Results: Methods of Ergonomics which are used for the agricultural ergonomics and the simple procedure of the agricultural ergonomics were presented. Conclusion: It was found that <b>agricultural</b> <b>works</b> can be improved quite much using the agricultural ergonomics principle and the musculoskeleta...|$|R

A number of ergonomics evaluation methods have been developed in order to evaluate the work load for preventing WMSDs. The workload evaluation methods were developed for manufacturing industry. Therefore, these ergonomic evaluation methods were used carefully in agriculture industry because work type in agriculture different from work type in manufacturing. Method: Various references of ergonomic evaluation methods such as OWAS, REBA, RULA, NLE and Snook table have been reviewed for <b>agricultural</b> <b>work.</b> Results: This paper presents the characteristics, the selection and application procedure of ergonomic evaluation methods for <b>agricultural</b> <b>work.</b> Application: These results can be used to provide baseline informatio...|$|R
