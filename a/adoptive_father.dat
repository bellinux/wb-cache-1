40|$|Background: Fathers {{and mothers}} play an unique {{role in the}} {{relationship}} with their children. This also accounts for the relationships of adoptive parents and their adopted children. Research {{of the differences between}} <b>adoptive</b> <b>fathers</b> and <b>adoptive</b> mothers in the relationship with their children is scarce. Aim: In this study the relationship of <b>adoptive</b> <b>fathers</b> with their daughters was investigated, by comparing this relationship with adoptive mothers and their daughters. The difference between <b>adoptive</b> <b>fathers</b> and mothers in the interpretation of the problem behavior of their children was also examined. Methods: <b>Adoptive</b> <b>fathers</b> (n = 67) and matched adoptive mothers (n = 67) completed a questionnaire about their adopted daughters, when their daughters were on average 7. 7 years (SD = 2. 7) old. The questionnaire included questions about the relationship between adoptive parents and their children, about the time they spend together, their communication {{and the extent to which}} adoptive parents trust their adopted children. The adoptive parents also completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) to assess problem behavior of the adopted daughters. The Total Problem behavior scale and Social Problem scale were used in the current study. Results: Most adoptive parents were positive about their relationship with their adopted daughter. There was no significant difference between the relationship of <b>adoptive</b> <b>fathers</b> and their adopted daughters and adoptive mothers and their adopted daughters. Communication, time spend together and trust were significantly related to the amount of problem behavior of the adopted child. The relationship between adoptive parents and their adopted daughters was significant related to their ratings of problem behavior: a better relationship meant more problem behavior. Conclusion: There were no significant differences in the relationship between <b>adoptive</b> <b>fathers</b> and mothers and their adopted daughters. Their perspective on the amount of problem behavior of their adopted daughters is also the same. It’s therefore important to value the role of <b>adoptive</b> <b>fathers</b> when training and counselling is offered to adoptive parents...|$|R
