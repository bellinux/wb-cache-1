3000|$|Reachability This {{measurement}} evaluates a protocol’s reliability. It {{is represented}} by the delivery ratio of <b>a</b> <b>flooding</b> message at all receiving nodes. For example, if there are 50 nodes in a network and <b>a</b> node <b>floods</b> <b>a</b> message using <b>a</b> certain <b>flooding</b> protocol resulting in 42 nodes receiving this message, then we say that the reachability is 42 / 49 = 85.71 %.|$|R

5|$|A {{tropical}} storm warning was issued {{at some point}} during the existence of the cyclone for the west coast of Florida from Key West to Apalachicola.

Before the arrival of Marco, elementary schools were closed on the three barrier islands in Lee County. Florida governor Bob Martinez ordered the closure of state offices in the Tampa Bay area, and also decided not to open the University of South Florida and nearby community colleges. Public schools were not opened on the day of the storm's passage in Manatee and Sarasota counties, though most other schools remained open.

5|$|Evan soon {{learns that}} 614 {{actually}} {{refers to the}} verse in the Book of Genesis, where God instructs Noah to build an Ark in preparation for <b>a</b> <b>flood.</b> God later repeatedly appears in various guises before finally revealing himself to Evan, and cordially insisting that he should also build an ark as well. God explains to Evan that <b>a</b> <b>flood</b> is coming, {{and that the only}} opportunity Evan will have to change the world is by saving his community instead. God also tells Evan to inform others about the flood should they ask him later. Concerned about Evan's behavior, Joan initially believes that he is having a mid-life crisis. Evan begins constructing the ark with his sons, who start to admire him as he is spending more time with them.|$|E
