40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyse India's anti dumping behaviour. India has become a major user of anti dumping measures, {{initiating}} more than 300 cases against many of its trading partners. After looking at the trends and patterns in the use of anti dumping measures by India, the paper tries to identify the various factors that influence the anti dumping procedure in India at different stages. The study finds that, many of the <b>allegedly</b> <b>dumped</b> <b>products</b> have experienced substantial increase in their imports into India. Again, many domestic producers seeking protection are performing unsatisfactorily. However, when it comes to the final decision by the authority to impose anti dumping duty, none of these factors appear to be significantly influencing that decision. Rather a less concentrated industry tends to get more anti dumping protection. The paper concludes with the observation that the anti dumping actions in India cannot be justified on predatory ground. However, the author feels that strategic actions on the part of the stake-holders should be explored to better understand the anti dumping behaviour of the nation.

50|$|DUT is {{a member}} of the dUTPase family, which is known for catalyzing the pyrophosphoralysis of dUTP into dUMP and {{inorganic}} pyrophosphate. This function contributes to DNA replication and repair via de novo thymidylate biosynthesis, as the <b>dUMP</b> <b>product</b> is methylated by thymidylate synthase (TS) to form dTMP, which is then phosphorylated to dTTP. DUT is also crucial for maintaining genome integrity by reducing cellular dUTP levels, thereby preventing the repeated cycles of uracil misincorporation into DNA and DNA repair-mediated strand breaks that would lead to cell death.|$|R
40|$|The GATT Anti-Dumping Code {{provides}} that anti-dumping proceedings may be concluded without {{the imposition of}} duties if the exporters of the <b>dumped</b> <b>product</b> offer undertakings which the authorities of the importing country consider acceptable. Undertakings are, in essence, formal commitments by exporters under anti-dumping investigation to abstain from dumping or {{to ensure that their}} exports will not injure the domestic producers of the product concerned. In accordance with the GATT rules, he anti-dumping laws of the European Community and the United States contain provisions allowing the anti-dumping authorities to accept price undertakings. In practice, however, the use of undertakings in the two jurisdictions has been considerably different.

40|$|Abstract: In {{the context}} of an {{antidumping}} investigation, the dumping margin {{is one of the key}} elements that need to be considered by the authorities. Without a sufficiently significant dumping margin, the investigation cannot conclude with the imposition of sanctions. Given the special interests that often influence the antidumping investigation, the need to identify dumping even if there is no such practice involved often makes the authorities use innovative methods of calculating key elements like the dumping margin. One of the most used such methods is the zeroing procedure. Key words: antidumping, dumping margin, zeroing The Antidumping Agreement allows two ways if calculating the dumping margin (which represents the difference between the export price of a good and the price considered normal for it, considering factors like production costs, transportation and normal profit margin). The first refers to a comparison between the weighted average normal value of all transactions with the <b>dumped</b> <b>product</b> and the weighte...|$|R

40|$|Abstract only. Louisiana {{accounts}} for more than 90 % of U. S. production of crawfish. While the majority of the product is sold live for crawfish boils, approximately 15 %- 30 % of the domestic output has historically been processed for the tail meat. As a result of increasing competion from China, Lousiana processors filed an antidumping petition alleging that frozen tail meat product from China was being dumped resulting in material injury to the domestic processing industry. In the following year, the United States International Trade Commission found that <b>dumped</b> <b>product</b> from China was causing material injury to the domestic processing industry and large duties (generally in excess of 100 %), as determined by the U. S. Department of Commerce, were subsequently imposed. Because U. S. Customs had considerable problems collecting these duties,exports from China to the United States have, over time, continued to increase; leading {{to the conclusion that the}} imposition of large duties have been only a minor deterrent to increasing supply from China due to exporters being able to evade the duties. This paper will examine: (a) the overall effectivness of the duties on imported tail meat from China, (b) means by which exporters evaded duties, and (c) a discussion of Byrd monies distributed to the processing sector and the impact of the Byrd funds...|$|R
40|$|Dumping can {{be defined}} as {{exporting}} goods at prices below those charged on the domestic market or at prices insufficient to recover the cost of the goods sold. Dumping is considered an unfair trading practice because it interferes with free market economy principles. During the 1980 s, anti-dumping measures were an important issue for a few developed countries that had attractive markets for foreign producers; these countries were the United States, the European Community, Canada, and Australia. The European Community (EC) has developed its own anti-dumping laws over the years; Article 113 of the EEC Treaty gives power to Community institutions to take action against <b>dumped</b> <b>products</b> from third countries. This EEC regulation was first adopted in 1968, and amended several times until 1994. In 1994, the United States and 110 other countries signed the Final Act Embodying the Results of the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations. One of the multilateral agreements under the Uruguay Round is a new anti-dumping code. In response to this new code, the EC Council adopted a new EC anti-dumping regulation which implemented the Uruguay Round anti-dumping agreement. This paper examines the relevant issues in past EC anti-dumping proceedings, and compares past practice with the revised rules in the new regulation. Furthermore, this paper addresses the degree of conformity of the new EC regulation with the Uruguay Round Agreements Act...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the food labeling claims that implied Vietnamese catfish of being raised in poor condition, the CFA accused the Vietnamese producers of <b>dumping</b> their <b>products</b> in the U.S. market. Since the Vietnamese catfish prices continued to sell in the U.S. market despite of the food labeling action, the CFA claimed that Vietnamese catfish producers were heavily subsidized by the government. Therefore, their production costs were not accurate in reflecting the selling prices in the U.S. The U.S. required the Vietnamese producers {{to prove that they}} operated under free market condition without any government subsidy.|$|R

40|$|Anti-dumping {{administration}} is a {{is a complex}} task requiring the application of economic, legal and accounting principles {{in the evaluation of}} petitions by industry for anti-dumping measures to be taken against <b>allegedly</b> injurious <b>dumped</b> imports. In particular there are complex competition issues involved in a decision on the imposition of dumping duties. Competition in the domestic market should be the first issue investigated. This will reduce the possibility of finding a false positive of injurious dumping at the initiation stage, and any unnecessary inhibitory effect on trade. The accuracy of the authority’s decisions can be enhanced by improving the transparency of the investigation process. This can be achieved by providing counsel for each party with access to the commercial in confidence information. It is then easier though a process of facilitated mediation for there to be a convergence on agreed issues needing resolution. This is likely to improve parties’ acceptance of the administering authority’s decisions based on sound economic principles from initiation to a final determination...|$|R
40|$|It is {{generally}} believed that, {{in the absence}} of retaliation, a country can enhance its welfare by <b>dumping</b> its <b>product</b> on another country. Antidumping policies, in the form of countervailing duties, are usually introduced by the dumped-upon countries. In this paper, the authors show that it may in fact be in the social interest of the dumping country to introduce a "voluntary dumping restraint" policy. It is also shown that such a policy can be enacted without the government having to forbid dumping by the private producers: an optimal production subsidy policy may be enough to preempt dumping.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a rationale for}} split decisions in antidumping cases. A split decision occurs when the U. S. government simultaneously investigates multiple countries for <b>dumping</b> the same <b>product</b> but imposes antidumping duties on only a subset of these countries. In the U. S., 76 % of antidumping petitions filed between 1980 and 2004 involved two or more countries accused of <b>dumping</b> the same <b>product.</b> Among these multi-country investigations, roughly 30 % concluded with a split decision in {{the final stage of}} an investigation. The model in this paper shows that selectively applying antidumping duties against foreign countries that are selling increased quantities of imports at a price below long run average total cost improves the importing country's welfare. Imperfectly competitive firms in different countries face stochastic demand and are subject to capacity constraints. As a result, foreign firms dump when they face weak demand in their own markets. In response to the shift in a foreign country's export supply, the importing country's optimal rent-shifting tariff against the foreign country with weak demand increases while its optimal tariff against other countries falls. This paper suggests an economic rationale behind the differential treatment afforded to different countries accused of dumping. ...|$|R

5000|$|The use of {{predatory pricing}} {{to capture a}} market in one {{territory}} while maintaining high prices in the suppliers' home market (also known as [...] "dumping") creates a risk that the loss-making product will find its {{way back to the}} home market and drive down prices there. For example, when Dow Chemical exported competitively-priced bromine to Europe, the established German bromine cartel attempted to punish them by selling bromine in the US at half price (below manufacturing cost), which would prevent Dow from making any profit in the US. But Dow's founder Herbert Dow simply purchased the cheap German product and sold it back to Europe at a profit. Eventually the cartel worked out what was happening and ceased <b>dumping</b> their <b>product,</b> but by then Dow's company had acquired a base of customers in Europe and his US competitors had been forced out of business.|$|R
50|$|Calculating {{the extent}} of <b>dumping</b> on a <b>product</b> is not enough.

Therefore, a detailed investigation must first be conducted according to specified rules. The investigation must evaluate all relevant economic factors that have a bearing {{on the state of}} the industry in question; if it is revealed that dumping is taking place and hurting domestic industry, the exporting company can raise its price to an agreed level in order to avoid anti-dumping import duties.|$|R

Dumping is the practice of dishonest trading, but the dumping was not prohibited by the WTO.
