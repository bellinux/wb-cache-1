25|$|Another story {{surrounding}} the Fling {{claims that it}} is meant to imitate a stag; the story goes that a boy who saw a stag was <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> it by his father. He lacked the words, so danced instead; the position of the hands resembles the head and antlers of a stag. This urban legend hides the fact that Highlanders used to snap their fingers as they danced.|$|E

25|$|Many {{researchers}} use self-report {{measures of}} felt emotion as a manipulation check. This raises {{an interesting question}} and a possible methodological weakness: are people always accurate when they recall how they felt in the past? Several findings suggest {{this is not the}} case. For instance, in a study of memory for emotions in supporters of former U.S. presidential candidate Ross Perot, supporters were <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> their initial emotional reactions after Perot's unexpected withdrawal in July 1992 and again after the presidential election that November.|$|E
25|$|To {{support this}} theory, {{evidence}} from Bisiach and Luzzatti's study of Piazza del Duomo can be considered. For the study, patients with hemispatial neglect, that were also {{familiar with the}} layout of the Piazza del Duomo square, were observed. The patients were asked to imagine themselves at various vantage points in the square, without physically being in the square. They were then <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> different landmarks around the square, such as stores. At each separate vantage point, patients consistently only described landmarks on the right side, ignoring {{the left side of the}} representation. However, the results of their multiple descriptions at the different vantage points showed that they knew information around the entire square, but could only identify the right side of the represented field at any given vantage point.When asked to switch vantage points so that the scene that was on the contralesional side is now on the ipsilesional side the patient was able to describe with details the scene they had earlier neglected.|$|E

There's a nuance to the adult songs that is different. It's still the story telling, but its different shades and angles. You read between the lines more." ...|$|E

500|$|Blue Lights on the Runway was {{released}} in the United States through the band's American label on 3 March 2009. It appeared in the top twenty of that country's Billboard Top Heatseekers Chart. When <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> touring {{for the first time}} without Crosby, Noonan said: [...] "It's good—it's all part of the journey". The band received attention from prominent bloggers in the country and made appearances on public radio, said to be a [...] "crucial showcase" [...] for bands like them in the United States. The band recorded a Ukulélé Session with the newspaper Le Soir to support the release of their album in Belgium. In Spain they played the Festival Internacional de Benicàssim that year. Back home Blue Lights on the Runway was given an [...] "honourable mention" [...] by The Sunday Business Posts Andrew Lynch in his end-of-year 2009 review of music.|$|E
500|$|The {{music of}} Megadeth and its {{underground}} metal contemporaries from the 1980s featured harsh vocals, double bass drum patterns, staccato riffing, tremolo picking, and screeching lead guitar work; albums {{from this period}} were produced on low budgets. After forming Megadeth, Mustaine followed the thrash metal style of his previous band, Metallica, with more emphasis on speed and intensity. Megadeth's music is characterized by its neat instrumental performance, featuring fast rhythm sections, complex arrangements, and [...] "snarling" [...] vocals. When <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> Megadeth's guitar style, Mustaine answered: [...] "When {{you go to a}} show and see a guitar player who just stands there, that's a guitar player. A thrash guitar player is a guy who plays like he wants to beat the guitar's guts out." [...] Most of the songs are recorded in standard guitar tuning as Mustaine believes it to provide a superior melody to alternative methods of tuning.|$|E
500|$|Experimental {{research}} on consciousness presents special difficulties, {{due to the}} lack of a universally accepted operational definition. In the majority of experiments that are specifically about consciousness, the subjects are human, and the criterion used is verbal report: [...] in other words, subjects are <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> their experiences, and their descriptions are treated as observations of the contents of consciousness. [...] For example, subjects who stare continuously at a Necker cube usually report that they experience it [...] "flipping" [...] between two 3D configurations, even though the stimulus itself remains the same. [...] The objective is to understand the relationship between the conscious awareness of stimuli (as indicated by verbal report) and the effects the stimuli have on brain activity and behavior. In several paradigms, such as the technique of response priming, the behavior of subjects is clearly influenced by stimuli for which they report no awareness, and suitable experimental manipulations can lead to increasing priming effects despite decreasing prime identification (double dissociation).|$|E

500|$|The episode {{showed the}} unwillingness of Sisko to accept his {{position}} as a religious figure within the Bajoran culture. [...] This theme was first explored in [...] "Emissary", the pilot of the series. The ongoing theme for Bajoran politics and religion began with [...] "In the Hands of the Prophets" [...] and ran {{through the rest of}} the series. Wolfe was raised as a Catholic, and he attributes the religious theme of the episode to this influence, as well as his interest in history. [...] He compares the religious intrigue of the story to the history of Catholicism in the 15th and 16th century, a time when members of various families jostled for power to become Pope. When <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> the character of Winn, Louise Fletcher said, [...] "Think the Pope in space, except she's like an ancient Pope, from the old days when Popes were ruthless and powerful and exerted their powers and fought wars and did all kinds of naughty things." ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{reluctant}} to give any specifics, he has expressed snippets of conceptual background at times; this, however, doesn't extend to the reasoning behind the album's title, which he declined to elaborate upon. When <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> the album in three words, he stated {{that it was a}} [...] "path of exploration". Bassist Jeff Caxide has revealed that Turner noted Carl Jung as a major influence on the concept and lyrics. Jung's 1961 work, Memories, Dreams, Reflections, served as a specific source of inspiration for Turner, as he noted on his blog in a post preceding the album's release. Beyond Jung, he has spoken of how the album is closely related to dreams, and that he had been keeping a dream journal during the album's compositional phase. He gave up smoking marijuana in 2008, which he says enabled him to remember his dreams more clearly and, according to J. Bennett, [...] "tap into an internal consciousness". All of the album's official lyrics, deemed almost entirely indecipherable, [...] were revealed in celebration of the album's first anniversary.|$|E
500|$|The {{purpose of}} the growing medium is [...] to provide support and to store water, oxygen and {{dissolved}} minerals to feed the plant. In the case of cacti, there is general agreement that an open medium with a high air content is important. When cacti are grown in containers, recommendations as to how this should be achieved vary greatly; Miles Anderson says that if <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> a perfect growing medium, [...] "ten growers would give 20 different answers". Roger Brown suggests a mixture of two parts commercial soilless growing medium, one part hydroponic clay and one part coarse pumice or perlite, {{with the addition of}} soil from earthworm castings. The general recommendation of 25–75% organic-based material, the rest being inorganic such as pumice, perlite or grit, is supported by other sources. However, the use of organic material is rejected altogether by others; Hecht says that cacti (other than epiphytes) [...] "want soil that is low in or free of humus", and recommends coarse sand as the basis of a growing medium.|$|E

500|$|After Carey {{finished}} her The Adventures of Mimi Tour (2006) {{in support of}} her tenth studio album The Emancipation of Mimi (2005), she began to work on material for her eleventh studio effort, the yet untitled E=MC² (2008). E=MC² was hailed {{as one of the}} most anticipated albums to be released in 2008, with many critics weighing their opinions on whether Carey would be able to deliver significant success, following her achievements with The Emancipation of Mimi. After the release and success of [...] "Touch My Body", the project's lead single, subsequent singles of the album failed to garner airplay or significant charting, Island Records halted promotion of the album. Since the album's release, Carey had planned to embark on an extensive tour in support of E=MC², describing its production and direction in several interviews. When <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> the tour's theme, Carey explained [...] "I'm thinking elaborate. I like elaborate. We only do substantial. That's what my jeweler says. I haven't gotten the looks in mind just yet, but we're going to figure it out soon enough." [...] Although plans for a tour were underway, and Carey's announcement for a tour during her promotional appearance on The X Factor in the United Kingdom in November 2008, the tour was suddenly cancelled in the following month.|$|E
500|$|The soap opera's {{official}} website stated that Eve was the [...] "beautiful and compassionate town doctor" [...] who was enjoying a successful career; [...] she {{was described as}} an altruist by John Berlau of The Atlas Society. Ross initially saw the character as easy to play, calling her [...] "everyone's best friend, and the town doctor, and a great mother". The actress had a more difficult time when Eve began behaving in morally questionable ways to protect secrets about her past. She felt that the change in Eve's character made the role challenging on an emotional level, comparing the experience to [...] "getting a jail sentence and you're expected {{to go along with}} it without any explanation" [...] or [...] "the gods messing with somebody with no reason but to mess with them". When <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> Eve in three words, Ross responded that she was a [...] "contradiction inside an enigma". Playing Eve, she said, was [...] "as if somebody came and told you that your closest friend is doing abominable things". Ross appreciated Eve's characterization as a human being who was not portrayed as completely good or bad and had admirable qualities as well as faults. She later connected Eve's shame of her past life with Julian and inability to tell her family to Lavinia Kingsley's regrets about her youth in the 2002 comedy film The Banger Sisters.|$|E
500|$|Since the album's {{release in}} early April, Carey had said {{publicly}} that she planned on {{embarking on a}} large worldwide tour in support of E=MC². In an interview with Billboard on March 28, 2008, Carey explained [...] "It's come up, and I'm probably {{going to do it}}, but I don't know exactly how we're going to do it or when. I'm thinking probably September. But I think it's important to tour with this album, {{because there are so many}} songs that I really want to sing live, that I really enjoy." [...] Months later, in an interview with MTV News in July, Carey further addressed her plans of a tour: [...] "We're looking at November right now. Please don't hold me accountable if it turns out to be December 5 or December 7 or January 18!" [...] When <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> the tour's theme, Carey explained [...] "I'm thinking elaborate. I like elaborate. We only do substantial. That's what my jeweler says. I haven't gotten the looks in mind just yet, but we're going to figure it out soon enough." [...] Despite continued plans for a tour, and announcements made on The X Factor in United Kingdom in November, the tour was suddenly cancelled by early December. Tabloids and critics began heavily speculating that Carey had become pregnant, and had abandoned plans for a tour as a result. Many claimed to have seen Carey visiting a famed gynecologist's office in Los Angeles. Additionally, Carey's newly slimmed figure began to change, as she stopped her exercise routines and gained weight. Though Carey had eventually announced that she was pregnant with twins on November 28, 2010, over two years later, she admitted she had indeed been pregnant during that time period, and suffered a miscarriage. For that reason, she cancelled the tour, and lost the child only two months later.|$|E
