40|$|An {{inertial}} navigation system is described and analyzed based on two two-degree-of-freedom Schuler-gyropendulums and one two-degree-of-freedom <b>azimuth</b> <b>gyro.</b> The three sensors, each base motion isolated about its two input axes, are mounted on a common base, strapped down to the vehicle. The up and down pointing spin vectors of the two properly tuned gyropendulums track the vertical and indicate physically their velocity with respect to inertial space. The spin vector of the <b>azimuth</b> <b>gyro</b> is pointing northerly parallel to the earth axis. The system can be made self-aligning on a stationary base. If external measurements for the north direction and the vertical are available, initial disturbance torques can be measured and easily biased out. The error analysis shows {{that the system is}} practicable with today's technology...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. For Magnetic Suspension Gyro-total-station has {{vulnerable}} to outside interference factors, {{there are some}} random drifting containing in measurements which are unable to establish its mathematical model. Vondrak filter which {{does not require the}} model is used to pre-process measurements of Magnetic Suspension Gyro-total-station. In this paper a high-precision astronomical baseline is established in Xi'an, and the <b>gyro</b> <b>azimuth</b> is tested eight times in baseline. 40, 000 north-seeking torque of the first and second place is filtered by the Vondrak filter for each test. The results show that the burr of data is reduced after filtered, and the filtered values reflect the trends of gyro north-seeking. Compared with the root mean square (RMS) of the measurements, RMS of Vondrak filter is decreased, the data is denser. Vondrak filter can effectively eliminate the random drifting containing in measurements, retain useful information in the maximum extent, and improve the accuracy of true north azimuth...|$|R
40|$|Even {{when the}} Global Positioning System (GPS) signal is blocked, a rate {{gyroscope}} (gyro) north finder {{is capable of}} providing the required azimuth reference information to a certain extent. In order to measure the azimuth between the observer and the north direction very accurately, we propose a multi-position non-continuous rotation gyro north finding scheme. Our new generalized mathematical model analyzes the elements that affect the azimuth measurement precision and can thus provide high precision azimuth reference information. Based on the gyro’s principle of detecting a projection of the earth rotation rate on its sensitive axis and the proposed north finding scheme, {{we are able to}} deduct an accurate mathematical model of the <b>gyro</b> outputs against <b>azimuth</b> with the <b>gyro</b> and shaft misalignments. Combining the gyro outputs model and the theory of propagation of uncertainty, some approaches to optimize north finding are provided, including reducing the gyro bias error, constraining the gyro random error, increasing the number of rotation points, improving rotation angle measurement precision, decreasing the gyro and the shaft misalignment angles. According them, a north finder setup is built and the azimuth uncertainty of 18 ” is obtained. This paper provides systematic theory for analyzing the details of the gyro north finder scheme from simulation to implementation. The proposed theory can guide both applied researchers in academia and advanced practitioners in industry for designing high precision robust north finder based on different types of rate gyroscopes...|$|R
