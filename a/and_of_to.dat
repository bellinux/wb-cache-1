5000|$|On October 21-23, 1956, a {{delegation}} composed of 40 {{writers and artists}} discussed the questions of intellectual freedom with such prominent party cadres as Trường Chinh, Xuân Thủy, and Tố Hữu. Of the intellectuals present, the young poet Lê Đạt expressed particularly sharp criticism of the regime's intolerant cultural policies in general, <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>To</b> Huu and Hoai Thanh in particular. Among others, he condemned the imprisonment of the poet Trần Dần, and the harassment to which Văn Cao, a famous poet and composer, had been subjected. On the second day, it was the artists’ turn to speak. On the third day, Truong Chinh declared that the intellectuals’ complaints were justified, but he instructed the participants not to publish anything about {{the debate in the}} press. The Hungarian revolution of October 23 (and particularly the Soviet invasion of November 4) put an end to North Vietnam’s short-lived intellectual [...] "thaw".

30|$|SDN offers {{built-in}} {{mechanisms for}} data collection via the OpenFlow (OF) protocol. Amaral et al. [19] harness SDN <b>and</b> <b>OF</b> <b>to</b> monitor and classify TCP enterprise network traffic. They leverage ML to extract knowledge from the collected data. In their architecture, a SDN application collects flow statistics from controlled switches and pro-actively installs a flow entry to direct all packets to the controller. For TCP traffic, the controller skips the TCP control packets, and stores the features of sizes, timestamps, MAC and IP addresses, and port numbers {{for the first five}} packets, along with their inter-arrival times. Then, the controller installs a flow entry with an idle timeout for local processing at the switch. Upon timeout, flow features of packet count, byte count and duration are collected at the controller.|$|E
40|$|A {{microfluidic}} {{sensor system}} based on a carbon nanotube-epoxy composite electrode was fabricated to allow detection {{of the presence of}} the anti-cancer drug carboplatin in healthy tissue in real time during chemotherapy. Detection of carboplatin was carried out by observing the effects of the drug on the differential pulse voltammetry of free purine bases using a novel carbon nanotube-epoxy composite electrode. In free solution these electrodes performed better than glassy carbon electrodes for oxidation of the free purine bases AMP and GMP, and than DNA-modified carbon nanotube-epoxy composite sensors for detection of carboplatin. On-line carboplatin detection was performed using a computer-controlled microfluidic platform. The methodology for on-line carboplatin detection was optimised in terms of the analysis time <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>to</b> allow repeated carboplatin measurement using the same electrode. Microdialysis sampling and our microfluidic platform were combined to give a proof of concept system for real-time carboplatin detection with a limit of detection of 0. 014 mM carboplatin in the sampled media.

40|$|There is a {{widespread}} perception that Muslims are making politically exceptional, culturally unreasonable or theologically alien demands upon European states. My contention is that the logic of Muslim claims-making is European and contemporary. The case of Britain is illustrative. The relation between Muslims and the wider British society and British state has {{to be seen in}} terms of a development and rising agendas of racial equality and multiculturalism. Muslims, indeed, have become central to these agendas even while they have contested important aspects of it – especially, the primacy of racial identities, narrow definitions of racism and equality and the secular bias of the discourse and policies of multiculturalism. While there are now emergent Muslim discourses of equality, of difference, <b>and</b> <b>of,</b> <b>to</b> use the title of the newsletter of the Muslim Council of Britain, ‘the common good’, they have to be understood as appropriations and modulations of contemporary discourses and initiatives whose provenance lie in anti-racism and feminism.

40|$|In {{the light}} of recent {{experimental}} and theoretical improvements, we review our previous model-independent comparison [hep-ph/ 0106247] of the Super-Kamiokande (SK) and Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) solar neutrino event rates, including updated values for the ``equalized'' SK datum and for the reference Standard Solar Model (SSM) B neutrino flux. We find that the joint SK+SNO evidence for active neutrino flavor transitions is confirmed {{at the level of}} 3. 3 standard deviations, independently of possible transitions to sterile states. Barring sterile neutrinos, we estimate the 3 -sigma range for the $^ 8 $B neutrino flux (normalized to SSM) as f_B= 0. 96 + 0. 54 - 0. 55. Accordingly, the 3 -sigma range for the energy-averaged nu_e survival probability is found to be = 0. 31 + 0. 55 - 0. 16, independently of the functional form of P_ee. An increase of the reference nu_e + d [...] > p + p + e cross section by ~ 3 %, as suggested by recent theoretical calculations, would slightly shift the central values of f_B <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>to</b> ~ 1. 00 and ~ 0. 29, respectively, and would strengthen the model-independent evidence for nu_e transitions into active states at the level of ~ 3. 6 sigma.

Once concluded this phase, <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>to</b> have made the recommendations pertinent; it is tried to design a programmed tool that, in addition to functional, is from easy manipulation and helps of this form in workings such as: to introduce the field data and to make the interpretation more accessible of the successfully obtained information. Consequently, this methodology will make agile the control, the analysis of the advance of the work and the costs of the project. The design of the tool was elaborated with Microsoft Excel, for the creation of tables of storage of data and with the aid of Macros in Visual BASIC, for the assembly of screens. The objective must to implement the created tool, in a real project of construction. The used mechanism will be to elaborate a monthly report, that includes the aspects and indices contemplated in the important tool and other parameters for the control of costs; in addition, it has been made the revision and study of legal documents; another aspect taken into account is the initial preparations for the correct planning and putting in practices of the project.

40|$|Background {{and purpose}} of the project The {{integrity}} of the canister {{is an important factor}} for long-term safety of the repository for spent nuclear fuel. When the canister is placed in the repository hole it will be subjected to mechanical loads due to the hydrostatical pressure and the swelling pressure of the bentonite surrounding it. Copper is a soft material and will creep and lay down on the ductile iron insert due to the loads. The creep process will go on until the bentonite is fully saturated. During this time period the creep properties of the copper canister are very essential for the integrity of the copper shell. The copper material may creep but is not supposed to fracture. SKB has investigated the creep properties of the used copper material (Oxygen Free Copper with 40 – 60 ppm phosphorous, OFP material), by carrying out different research projects regarding creep. All the relevant work arising from the development programme concentrates on measurement of minimum creep rates and creep lives for Oxygen free copper (OF) <b>and</b> <b>OF</b> <b>to</b> which 50 ppm phosphorus has been added (OFP) under conditions where test duration has not exceeded two years. This has required testing to be accelerated by using higher temperatures and/or higher stresses than would be expected in service. Extrapolation of test data over five orders of magnitude in time, coupled with reductions in temperature and stress, has been used to predict service behaviour. Doubt has been cast on the validity of such extreme extrapolations by the observation that creep deformation and failure mechanisms in metals change with changes in temperature or applied stress (Bowyer- 2003) This study has been undertaken in an effort to understand the differences in behaviour of OF and OFP material more fully and attempt to resolve the doubts referred to above...|$|E
