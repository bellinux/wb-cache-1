5|$|Initially given a blue color scheme, the TIE fighter {{models for}} the first film were grey to better film against a bluescreen; TIE fighters in The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983) shifted {{back to being a}} muted blue. Sound {{designer}} Ben Burtt created the distinctive TIE fighter sound effect by combining an elephant call with a car driving on wet pavement. Combat scenes between TIE fighters and the Millennium Falcon and Rebel Alliance X-wing fighters in Star Wars were meant to be reminiscent of World War II dogfight footage; editors used World War II air combat clips as placeholders while Industrial Light & Magic completed the movie's special effects. Darth Vader's distinct TIE advanced X1 in Star Wars was designed to make it instantly recognizable, and the TIE interceptors developed for Jedi were designed to look fast, deadly, <b>and</b> <b>frightening.</b>|$|E
5|$|However, {{the game}} often {{considered}} the first true survival horror, due {{to having the}} most influence on Resident Evil, was the 1989 release Sweet Home, for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It was created by Tokuro Fujiwara, who would later go on to create Resident Evil. Sweet Homes gameplay focused on solving a variety of puzzles using items stored in a limited inventory, while battling or escaping from horrifying creatures, {{which could lead to}} permanent death for any of the characters, thus creating tension and an emphasis on survival. It was also the first attempt at creating a scary <b>and</b> <b>frightening</b> storyline within a game, mainly told through scattered diary entries left behind fifty years before the events of the game. Developed by Capcom, the game would become the main inspiration behind their later release Resident Evil. Its horrific imagery prevented its release in the Western world, though its influence was felt through Resident Evil, which was originally intended to be a remake of the game. Some consider Sweet Home to be the first true survival horror game.|$|E
5|$|Williams {{had wanted}} to make a horror game for eight years prior to Phantasmagoria, and had started to design one on several occasions, but none came to fruition. She felt the {{computer}} game industry and software technology had not yet reached the point where an effective <b>and</b> <b>frightening</b> computer game could be made. As a result, she decided to wait until CD-ROMs were faster and could handle real actors, which she believed was crucial for a horror game because she felt the player {{had to be able to}} empathize with the character to fear for them. Williams had been considering several horror story ideas for years before making the game. In one, the heroine answers a magician's advertisement for an assistant and gets the job, but the magician turns out to be insane. Another was set in the past, with the female protagonist getting involved in the supernatural life of a magician character. That idea evolved into a woman being married to a man who is drawn to a bizarre house that previously belonged to illusionists and is haunted by ghosts. The final story as it appears in the game has a contemporary setting, but combines elements from modern fiction, 19th century literature, and classic horror films of the 1950s.|$|E

25|$|Broadly speaking, these mutinies {{resulted}} in three problems. First, the mutinies were unpredictable <b>and</b> <b>frightening</b> events for any military leader to deal with. Second, they encouraged the troops {{to live off}} the locals, extracting 'free lodgings, and encouraging theft and plunder' which drastically reduced local support for the Spanish cause. Third, the pauses in the campaigns caused by the mutinies allowed the Dutch to recover lost ground each time.|$|E

25|$|Completing The Fog was {{an unusually}} {{difficult}} process for Carpenter. After viewing {{a rough cut}} of the film, he was dissatisfied with the result. For {{the only time in}} his filmmaking career, he had to devise a way to salvage a nearly finished film that did not meet his standards.

25|$|The Doctor Who {{theme music}} {{was one of}} the first {{electronic}} music signature tunes for television, and after five decades remains one of the most easily recognised. It has been often called both memorable <b>and</b> <b>frightening,</b> priming the viewer for what was to follow. During the 1970s, the Radio Times, the BBC's own listings magazine, announced that a child's mother said the theme music terrified her son. The Radio Times was apologetic, but the theme music remained.|$|E
25|$|In particular, The Cradle of the Deep, an {{autobiography}} {{written by a}} silent movie actress, Joan Lowell, in March 1929, became a national bestseller that topped non-fiction part of The New York Times Best Seller list.

25|$|Murray’s advice {{had been}} met with dismay from some Liberal {{members of the}} {{coalition}} Cabinet, who were unhappy at the realignment of Britain’s war effort towards total war and a massive commitment of troops to the Western Front. Augustine Birrell (Chief Secretary for Ireland), along with Reginald McKenna (Chancellor of the Exchequer), Walter Runciman (President of the Board of Trade) and Sir Edward Grey (Foreign Secretary) had contemplated joining Sir John Simon (Home Secretary) in resigning in protest at the conscription of bachelors, due to be enacted in January 1916. Birrell wrote to the Prime Minister (29 December) that he and Runciman agreed that finance and “strategic policy as expounded in Murray’s long, unconvincing <b>and</b> <b>frightening</b> paper” were more important than conscription.|$|E

500|$|The {{team did}} not want the android Azel to be a typical {{energetic}} anime-style heroine, and instead tried to make her simultaneously appealing <b>and</b> <b>frightening.</b> Her character underwent the most revisions, emphasizing her human and non-human aspects, and one early design had a hole in her torso. Art director Manabu Kusunoki picked Katsumi Yokota to design the characters; according to Futatsugi, Yokota is [...] "a very, very good artist.

500|$|Kate Mulgrew {{suggested}} that the show incorporate a new and stronger antagonist, saying: [...] "We need [...] to encounter enemies of such ferocity, enemies who in fact are quite lethal <b>and</b> <b>frightening.</b> Enemies that you would watch and say, 'Oh, boy, {{how are they going}} to get out of this one?'

He considered it to be [...] "an interesting <b>and</b> <b>frightening</b> image, because they're standing there, not intervening". Brooker converted it to a script for Dead Set, in which a photograph goes viral on social media and [...] "unlock this primal urge for people to be voyeurs of agony".
