The flag consisted of a thunderbolt in the centre and <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>and</b> eight oil lamps for the border, with the Vande Mataram caption split around the thunderbolt. It was also presented at the Indian National Congress meeting in 1906. Soon, many other proposals were initiated, {{but none of them}} gained attention from the nationalist movement.|$|E

She once complained that she was only earning <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>and</b> twenty pesos a month despite her hard labor. To this, Marcos laughed and {{said that it was}} her fault that she was working hard only for such an amount. This was a turning point for Imelda to no longer feel guilty about spending money. From then on, she pushed herself to extreme luxury.|$|E
5|$|In 1153 or 1154, Chesney was the {{recipient}} of the lordship of <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>and</b> a half in Norfolk, possibly in compensation for the loss of the manor of Mileham. Chesney likely lost Mileham to another noble family, the fitzAlans, as part of the settlement resulting from the Treaty of Wallingford which settled the civil war in England. Both William's father Robert and his elder brother John had held these offices before him.|$|E

5|$|Since Hairsprays plot focuses {{heavily on}} dance, choreography became a heavy focus for Shankman, who hired four {{assistant}} choreographers, Jamal Sims, Anne Fletcher, and Zach Woodlee, and put both his acting cast and over <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>and</b> fifty dancers through {{two months of}} rehearsals. The cast recorded the vocal tracks for their songs as coached by Elaine Overholt in the weeks just before principal photography began in September.|$|E

5|$|Gilbert's legacy, {{aside from}} {{building}} the Garrick Theatre and writing the Savoy Operas and other works {{that are still}} being performed or in print over <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>and</b> twenty-five years after their creation, is felt perhaps most strongly today through his influence on the American and British musical theatre. The innovations in content and form of the works that he and Sullivan developed, and in Gilbert's theories of acting and stage direction, directly influenced {{the development of the}} modern musical throughout the 20th century. Gilbert's lyrics employ punning, as well as complex internal and two and three-syllable rhyme schemes, and served as a model for such 20th century Broadway librettists and lyricists as P.G. Wodehouse, Cole Porter, Ira Gershwin, Lorenz Hart and Oscar Hammerstein II.|$|E
5|$|Pritchard {{received}} word from local residents {{that on the}} night before a party, probably including the Confederate President, had crossed the Ocmulgee River just north of Abbeville. Since there were two roads to Irwindale, one of which had been taken by Harnden and his men, Pritchard decided to take the other, {{to see if he could}} capture Davis. He took with him about <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>and</b> forty men and their horses, while the balance of the Michiganders stayed on the Ocmulgee River near Abbeville. Some seven hours later, at 1 A.M. on May 10, Pritchard arrived at Irwindale. There was no evidence of Harnden's men being there yet.|$|E

5|$|Knox {{had avoided}} being arrested by Lord Bothwell through Wishart's advice {{to return to}} tutoring. He took shelter with Douglas in Longniddry. Several months later {{he was still in}} charge of the pupils, the sons of Douglas and Cockburn, who wearied of moving from place to place while being pursued. He {{toyed with the idea of}} fleeing to Germany and taking his pupils with him. While Knox {{remained}} a fugitive, Beaton was murdered on 29 May 1546, within his residence, the Castle of St Andrews, by a gang of five persons in revenge for Wishart's execution. The assassins seized the castle and eventually their families and friends took refuge with them, about <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>and</b> fifty men in all. Among their friends was Henry Balnaves, a former secretary of state in the government, who negotiated with England for the financial support of the rebels. Douglas and Cockburn suggested to Knox to take their sons to the relative safety of the castle to continue their instruction in reformed doctrine. Knox arrived at the castle on 10 April 1547.|$|E
5|$|Names {{of three}} poets from the 11th century {{and some of}} their poems are available. Madara Chennaiah, a cobbler turned saint, is {{considered}} by H.S. Shiva Prakash as the first Vachana poet, and was held in high esteem by latter day poets of the 12th century, including Basavanna. Only ten of Chennaiah's poems, expressing his resentment of the caste system in metaphors taken from the cobblers' trade, are extant today. Dohara Kakkaiah is the second poet. A dalit by birth, his six available poems are confessional in nature, a theme seen in the later poems of Basavanna. Devara Dasimaiah (or Jedara Dasimaiah, 1040) is better known because <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>and</b> fifty of his poems are available. Written in a deft and concise language of proverbs and metaphors, his poems encourage monotheistic belief in the god Shiva. Dasimaiah's wife Duggale qualifies as Kannada's first women poet, though only a few of her poems are available.|$|E
