25|$|There {{are three}} {{melatonin}} agonists {{on the market}} today (February 2014); ramelteon (Rozerem), <b>agomelatine</b> (Valdoxan, Melitor, Thymanax) and Tasimelteon (Hetlioz). Ramelteon was developed by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company and approved in the United States in 2005. <b>Agomelatine</b> was developed by the pharmaceutical company Servier and approved in Europe 2009. Tasimelteon was developed by Vanda Pharmaceuticals and completed the phase III trial in 2010. It was approved by the FDA on January 31, 2014 for the treatment of non-24-hour sleep–wake disorder in totally blind individuals.|$|E
25|$|<b>Agomelatine,</b> a melatonergic {{antidepressant}} with sleep-improving {{qualities that}} does not cause daytime drowsiness, is licensed for marketing in the European Union and TGA Australia. After trials in the United States its development for use there was discontinued in October 2011 by Novartis, who had bought the rights to market it there from the European pharmaceutical company Servier.|$|E
25|$|Receptors and the {{structure}} of melatonin are known. Therefore researchers started to investigate modulations of the core structure to develop better agonists than melatonin; more potent, with better pharmacokinetics and longer half-life. TIK-301 (figure 1) is an agonist of the early classes. It is very similar to melatonin and has made it to clinical trials. This led to further research on the molecule, mainly substitution of the aromatic ring. Various modulations showed promising activity, especially the naphthalene ring which is present in <b>agomelatine</b> (figure 1). Other ring systems have also showed melatonin agonist activity. Amongst them are indane which is present in ramelteon (figure 1) and the ring system of tasimelteon (figure 1).|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{and probably}} {{most widely accepted}} scientific theory of antidepressant action is the monoamine hypothesis (which {{can be traced back}} to the 1950s), which states that depression is due to an imbalance (most often a deficiency) of the monoamine neurotransmitters (namely serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine). It was originally proposed based on the observation that certain hydrazine anti-tuberculosis agents produce antidepressant effects, which was later linked to their inhibitory effects on monoamine oxidase, the enzyme that catalyses the breakdown of the monoamine neurotransmitters. All currently marketed antidepressants have the monoamine hypothesis as their theoretical basis, with the possible exception of <b>agomelatine</b> which acts on a dual melatonergic-serotonergic pathway. Despite the success of the monoamine hypothesis it has a number of limitations: for one, all monoaminergic antidepressants have a delayed onset of action of at least a week; and secondly, there are a sizeable portion (>40%) of depressed patients that do not adequately respond to monoaminergic antidepressants. A number of alternative hypotheses have been proposed, including the glutamate, neurogenic, epigenetic, cortisol hypersecretion and inflammatory hypotheses.|$|E
2500|$|... 2 Ordinary {{efficacy}} drug. Maybe some {{primary sources}} indicate superior efficacy relative to superior efficacy agents (e.g. <b>agomelatine</b> has shown superior efficacy to venlafaxine in one clinical trial) but insufficient data {{to say with}} much confidence.|$|E
2500|$|TIK-301 (PD-6735, LY-156,735) {{has been}} in phase II {{clinical}} trial in the United States (US) since 2002. The FDA granted TIK-301 orphan drug designation in May 2004, {{to use as a}} treatment for circadian rhythm sleep disorder in blind individuals without light perception and individuals with tardive dyskinesia. [...] In 2005 ramelteon (Rozerem®) was approved in the US indicated for treatment of insomnia, characterized as difficulty with falling asleep, in adults. Melatonin in the form of prolonged release (trade name Circadin®) was approved in 2007 in Europe (EU) for use as a short-term treatment, in patients 55 years or older, for primary insomnia (poor quality of sleep). Products containing melatonin are available as a dietary supplement in the United States and Canada. In 2009 <b>agomelatine</b> (Valdoxan®, Melitor®, Thymanax®) was also approved in Europe and is indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder in adults. Tasimelteon completed the phase III clinical trial in the United States for primary insomnia in 2010. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted tasimelteon orphan drug designation status for blind individuals without light perception with non-24-hour sleep–wake disorder in January the same year, and final FDA approval for the same purpose was achieved in January 2014 under the trade name Hetlioz®.|$|E
50|$|The {{chemical}} structure of <b>agomelatine</b> {{is very similar}} to that of melatonin. Where melatonin has an NH group, <b>agomelatine</b> has an HC=CH group. Thus melatonin contains an indole part, whereas <b>agomelatine</b> has a naphthalene bioisostere instead.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, {{possibly}} {{because of its}} action on melatonin receptors, <b>agomelatine</b> appears to improve sleep quality, with no reported daytime drowsiness. <b>Agomelatine</b> has demonstrated anxiolytic properties in rodents. It has been found significantly more effective than placebo {{in the treatment of}} generalised anxiety disorder. There is tentative evidence to suggest the efficacy of <b>agomelatine</b> as either a monotherapy or adjunct in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). A case report documenting the efficacy of <b>agomelatine</b> in the treatment of social anxiety disorder has been published. An open-label study has found <b>agomelatine</b> to be efficacious in the treatment of seasonal affective disorder. Open-label studies have suggested efficacy of adjunctive <b>agomelatine</b> in bipolar depression. A study in mice found that it protected against pentylenetetrazole- and pilocarpine-induced seizures. A small placebo-controlled trial found some benefit of <b>agomelatine</b> in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). A 2015 review suggested no recommendations of <b>Agomelatine</b> in support of, or against, its use to treat individuals with seasonal affective disorder.|$|E
50|$|<b>Agomelatine</b> is a {{substrate}} of CYP1A2, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. Inhibitors {{of these}} enzymes, e.g. the SSRI antidepressant fluvoxamine, reduce its clearance and can therefore {{lead to an}} increase in <b>agomelatine</b> exposure. There is also the potential for <b>agomelatine</b> to interact with alcohol to increase the risk of hepatotoxicity.|$|E
5000|$|However, {{the body}} of {{research}} on <b>agomelatine</b> has been substantially affected by publication bias, prompting analyses which take into account both published and unpublished studies. These have confirmed that <b>agomelatine</b> is (statistically) approximately as effective as more commonly used antidepressants (eg SSRIs), but some qualified this as [...] "marginally clinically relevant", being only slightly above placebo. According to 2013 review <b>Agomelatine</b> did not seem to provide a significant advantage in efficacy over other antidepressive agents for the acute-phase treatment of major depression.|$|E
50|$|Results of the {{meta-analysis}} of three positive, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies in 357 patients treated with <b>agomelatine</b> and 360 patients treated with placebo show that <b>agomelatine</b> {{is effective in}} treating severe depression. Its antidepressant effect is greater for more severe depression. In patients with a greater baseline score (>30 on HAMD17 scale), the agomelatine-placebo difference was of 4.53 points. Controlled studies in humans have shown that <b>agomelatine</b> {{is at least as}} effective as the SSRI antidepressants paroxetine, sertraline, escitalopram, and fluoxetine in the treatment of major depression.|$|E
50|$|<b>Agomelatine</b> is {{expected}} to be relatively safe in overdose.|$|E

50|$|<b>Agomelatine</b> resynchronises {{circadian}} rhythms {{in animal}} models of delayed sleep phase syndrome. By antagonizing 5-HT2C receptors, it disinhibits/increases noradrenaline and dopamine release {{specifically in the}} frontal cortex. Therefore, it is sometimes classified as a norepinephrine-dopamine disinhibitor. It has no influence on the extracellular levels of serotonin. <b>Agomelatine</b> has shown an antidepressant-like effect in animal models of depression (learned helplessness test, despair test, chronic mild stress) {{as well as in}} models with circadian rhythm desynchronisation and in models related to stress and anxiety. In humans, <b>agomelatine</b> has positive phase shifting properties; it induces a phase advance of sleep, body temperature decline and melatonin onset.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Agomelatine</b> is {{indicated}} {{for the treatment}} of major depressive episodes in adults. Ten placebo controlled trials have been performed to investigate the short term efficacy of <b>agomelatine</b> in major depressive disorder. At the end of treatment, significant efficacy was demonstrated in six of the ten short-term double-blind placebo-controlled studies. Two were considered [...] "failed" [...] trials, as comparators of established efficacy failed to differentiate from placebo. Efficacy was also observed in more severely depressed patients in all positive placebo-controlled studies. The maintenance of antidepressant efficacy was demonstrated in a relapse prevention study. A large meta-analysis of 20 trials with 7460 participants found <b>agomelatine</b> to be as effective as standard antidepressants.|$|E

50|$|No dosage {{tapering}} {{is needed}} on treatment discontinuation. <b>Agomelatine</b> has no abuse potential as measured in healthy volunteer studies.|$|E
50|$|<b>Agomelatine</b> {{appears to}} cause fewer sexual {{side effects and}} {{discontinuation}} effects than paroxetine. It appears better tolerated than the SSRIs.|$|E

50|$|<b>Agomelatine</b> {{does not}} alter daytime {{vigilance}} and memory in healthy volunteers. In depressed patients, treatment {{with the drug}} increased slow wave sleep without modification of REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep amount or REM latency. <b>Agomelatine</b> also induced an advance {{of the time of}} sleep onset and of minimum heart rate. From the first week of treatment, onset of sleep and the quality of sleep were significantly improved without daytime clumsiness as assessed by patients.|$|E

50|$|<b>Agomelatine</b> is {{contraindicated}} {{in patients}} with kidney or liver impairment. According to information disclosed by Les Laboratoires Servier on October 10, 2012, guidelines for the follow-up of patients treated with Valdoxan have been modified {{in concert with the}} European Medicines Agency. As some patients may experience increased levels of liver enzymes in their blood during treatment with Valdoxan, doctors have to run laboratory tests to check that the liver is working properly at the initiation of the treatment and then periodically during treatment, and subsequently decided whether to pursue the treatment or not. No relevant modification in <b>agomelatine</b> pharmacokinetic parameters {{in patients with}} severe renal impairment has been observed. However, only limited clinical data on its use in depressed patients with severe or moderate renal impairment with major depressive episodes is available. Therefore, caution should be exercised when prescribing <b>agomelatine</b> to these patients.|$|E
50|$|<b>Agomelatine</b> was {{discovered}} and {{developed by the}} European pharmaceutical company Servier Laboratories Ltd. Servier continued to develop the drug and conduct phase III trials in the European Union.|$|E
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 21st century, several melatonin receptor agonists that bind to and activate melatonin receptors were developed. These analogues, prescribed for several sleep disorders, include ramelteon, <b>agomelatine,</b> TIK-301 and tasimelteon. Ramelteon (Rozerem®) was approved for treatment of insomnia in the US in 2005. In 2009 <b>agomelatine</b> (Valdoxan®, Melitor®, Thymanax®), primarily used for depression, was approved in Europe. Both TIK-301 (in 2004) and tasimelteon (Hetlioz®) ten years later were approved in the US for the circadian rhythm sleep disorder non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder in totally blind individuals.|$|E
50|$|Due to its {{distinctive}} mechanism of action, <b>agomelatine</b> is also studied for {{its effects on}} sleep regulation. Studies report various improvements in general quality of sleep metrics, as well as specific therapeutic benefits in circadian rhythm disorders.|$|E
50|$|<b>Agomelatine,</b> {{is a type}} of {{drug that}} acts on a dual melatonergic-serotonergic pathway, which have shown its {{efficacy}} in the treatment of anxious depression during clinical trails, study also suggests the efficacy in the treatment of atypical and melancholic depression.|$|E
50|$|<b>Agomelatine</b> is a {{melatonin}} {{receptor agonist}} (MT1 (Ki=0.1nM) and MT2 (Ki=0.12nM)) and a 5-HT2C (Ki=631nM) receptor antagonist. Binding {{studies indicate that}} it has no effect on monoamine uptake and no affinity for adrenergic, histaminergic, cholinergic, dopaminergic and benzodiazepine receptors, nor other serotonergic receptors.|$|E
50|$|Research {{indicates}} that some suicide victims have an abnormally {{high number of}} 5-HT2C receptors in the prefrontal cortex. There is some mixed evidence that <b>agomelatine,</b> a 5-HT2C antagonist, is an effective antidepressant. Antagonism of 5-HT2C receptors by <b>agomelatine</b> results in an increase of dopamine and norepinephrine activity in the frontal cortex. Conversely, many SSRIs (but not fluoxetine, which is a 5-HT2C antagonist) indirectly stimulate 5-HT2C activity by increasing levels of serotonin in the synapse although the delayed mood elevation that is usually typical of SSRIs is usually paralleled by the downregulation of the 5-HT2C receptors. Many atypical antipsychotics block 5-HT2C receptors, but their clinical use is limited by multiple undesirable actions on various neurotransmitters and receptors. Fluoxetine acts as a direct 5-HT2C antagonist in addition to inhibiting serotonin reuptake, however, the clinical significance of this action is variable.|$|E
50|$|Aside from <b>agomelatine,</b> fluoxetine, and flibanserin, as of present, {{no other}} drugs have been {{described}} as NDDIs in the medical literature, despite the fact that many other existing drugs possess effects consistent with those of the definition of an NDDI. In any case, more drugs labeled specifically as NDDIs may be seen in the future.|$|E

50|$|It is not {{recommended}} for use {{in children and adolescents}} below 18 years of age {{due to a lack of}} data on safety and efficacy. Only limited clinical data is available on the use of <b>agomelatine</b> in elderly patients ≥ 65 years old with major depressive episodes. Therefore, caution should be exercised when prescribing it to these patients.|$|E
50|$|<b>Agomelatine</b> (BAN, rINN; {{trade names}} Valdoxan, Melitor, Thymanax) is a melatonergic {{antidepressant}} {{developed by the}} pharmaceutical company Servier. It is marketed {{for the treatment of}} major depressive disorder, primarily for its relatively favorable side effect profile: it avoids the weight gain, sexual dysfunction, and severe withdrawal associated with the most commonly used classes of antidepressants (SSRIs, SNRIs, tricyclics), while providing similar therapeutic benefit.|$|E
50|$|Tasimelteon is a {{selective}} agonist for the melatonin receptors MT1 and MT2, {{similar to other}} members of the melatonin receptor agonist class of which ramelteon (2005) and <b>agomelatine</b> (2009) were the first approved. As a treatment for N24HSWD, as with melatonin or other melatonin derivatives, the patient may experience improved sleep timing while taking the drug. Reversion to baseline sleep performance occurs within a month of discontinuation.|$|E
