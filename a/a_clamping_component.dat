40|$|The multiprotein {{replisome}} {{complex that}} replicates DNA {{has been extensively}} characterized in vitro, but its composition and architecture in vivo is unknown. Using millisecond single-molecule fluorescence microscopy in living cells expressing fluorescent derivatives of replisome components, we have examined replisome stoichiometry and architecture. Active Escherichia coli replisomes contain three molecules of the replicative polymerase, rather than the historically accepted two. These are associated with three molecules of t, <b>a</b> <b>clamp</b> loader <b>component</b> that trimerizes polymerase. Only {{two of the three}} sliding clamps are always associated with the core replisome. Single-strand binding protein has a broader spatial distribution than the core components, with 5 to 11 tetramers per replisome. This in vivo technique could provide single-molecule insight into other molecular machines. Replisomes are dynamic multiprotein ma-chines that replicate DNA by copyingthe leading-strand template continuously and the lagging-strand template discontinuously. In E. coli the replisome couples the activities of more than 11 proteins during genome replica-tion (1, 2). The DnaB helicase, loaded onto th...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} in closed access until 1 st Feb. 2018. Thanks to their {{compactness}} and suitability for vacuum applications, linear ultrasonic motors are considered as substitutes for classical electromagnetic motors as driving elements in absolute gravimeters. Still, their application is prevented by relatively low power output. To overcome this limitation and provide better stability, a V-type linear ultrasonic motor with <b>a</b> new <b>clamping</b> method is proposed for a gravimeter. In this paper, a mechanical model of stators with flexible <b>clamping</b> <b>components</b> is suggested, {{according to a}} design criterion for clamps of linear ultrasonic motors. After that, an effect of tangential and normal rigidity of the <b>clamping</b> <b>components</b> on mechanical output is studied. It is followed by discussion of <b>a</b> new <b>clamping</b> method with sufficient tangential rigidity and a capability to facilitate pre-load. Additionally, a prototype of the motor with the proposed clamping method was fabricated and the performance tests in vertical direction were implemented. Experimental {{results show that the}} suggested motor has structural stability and high dynamic performance, such as no-load speed of 1. 4 m/s and maximal thrust of 43 N, meeting the requirements for absolute gravimeters...|$|R

25|$|When a {{fastener}} is torqued, a tension preload develops in the bolt and an equal compressive preload develops in the parts being fastened. This can be modeled as a spring-like assembly {{that has some}} assumed distribution of compressive strain in the <b>clamped</b> joint <b>components.</b> When <b>an</b> external tension load is applied, it relieves the compressive strains induced by the preload in the <b>clamped</b> <b>components,</b> hence the preload acting on the compressed joint components provides the external tension load with a path (through the joint) other than through the bolt. In a well designed joint, perhaps 80-90% of the externally applied tension load will pass through the joint and the remainder through the bolt. This reduces the fatigue loading of the bolt.|$|R

50|$|A {{crowbar circuit}} is {{distinct}} from <b>a</b> <b>clamp</b> in that, once triggered, it pulls the voltage below the trigger level, usually close to ground. <b>A</b> <b>clamp</b> prevents the voltage from exceeding a preset level. Thus, a crowbar will not automatically return to normal operation when the overvoltage condition is removed; power must be removed entirely to stop its conduction.|$|R
50|$|The {{advantage}} of a crowbar over <b>a</b> <b>clamp</b> is that the low holding voltage of the crowbar lets it carry higher fault current without dissipating much power (which could otherwise cause overheating). Also, a crowbar is more likely than <b>a</b> <b>clamp</b> to deactivate <b>a</b> device (by blowing a fuse or tripping a breaker), bringing attention to the faulty equipment.|$|R

50|$|<b>A</b> <b>clamp</b> {{force sensor}} is a {{relatively}} expensive component in an EMB caliper. The cost is derived from its high unit value from a supplier, as well as marked production expenses because of its inclusion. The later emanates from the complex assembly procedures dealing with small tolerances, as well as on-line calibration for performance variability from one clamp force sensor to another. The successful use of <b>a</b> <b>clamp</b> force sensor in an EMB system poses a challenging engineering task. If <b>a</b> <b>clamp</b> forcesensor is placed close to a brake pad, {{then it will be}} subjected to severe temperature conditions reaching up to 800 Celsius that will challenge its mechanical integrity. Also temperature drifts must be compensated for. This situation can be avoided by embedding <b>a</b> <b>clamp</b> force sensor deep within the caliper. However, embedding this sensor leads to hysteresis that is influenced by friction between the clamp force sensor and the point of contact of an inner pad with the rotor. This hysteresis prevents <b>a</b> true <b>clamp</b> force to be measured. Due to the cost issues and engineering challenges involved with including the clamp force sensor, it might be desirable to eliminate this component from the EMB system. A potential opportunity to achieve this presents itself in accurate estimation of the clamp force based on alternative EMB system sensory measurements leading to the omission of <b>a</b> <b>clamp</b> force sensor.|$|R
