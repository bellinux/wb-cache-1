50|$|The {{accurate}} {{calculation of}} a location's longitude was long a critical element of maritime navigation. The United States established the United States Coast Survey in the 1830s {{to produce a}} consistent set of nautical charts for the nation's coastline. The Harvard College Observatory in Cambridge, Massachusetts was chosen in 1847 {{as the site of}} the prime reference point for the longitude determinations, and survey work extended from there. The advent of telegraphy made possible the simultaneous exchange of time signals between distant locations to determine the difference in time between observed passage of an object in the sky (often Polaris) at different locations. With sufficiently <b>accurate</b> <b>time</b> <b>pieces,</b> longitude could be determined with significant precision.|$|R
40|$|For {{the past}} 50 years, atomic {{standards}} {{based on the}} frequency of the cesium ground-state hyperfine transition have been the most <b>accurate</b> <b>time</b> <b>pieces</b> in the world. We now report a comparison between the cesium fountain standard NIST-F 1, which has been evaluated with an inaccuracy of about 4 × 10 - 16, and an optical frequency standard based on an ultraviolet transition in a single, laser-cooled mercury ion for which the fractional systematic frequency uncertainty was below 7. 2 × 10 - 17. The absolute frequency of the transition was measured versus cesium to be 1 [*] 064 [*] 721 [*] 609 [*] 899 [*] 144. 94 (97) Hz, with a statistically limited total fractional uncertainty of 9. 1 × 10 - 16, the most accurate absolute measurement of an optical frequency to date...|$|R

With {{the aid of}} the direct Eulerian GRP (generalized Riemann problem) methods Yang-He-Tang: 2011,Yang-Tang: 2012 and the analytical resolution of the local "quasi 1 D" GRP, the two-stage fourth-order <b>accurate</b> <b>time</b> discretizations are successfully implemented for the 1 D and 2 D special relativistic hydrodynamical equations.
