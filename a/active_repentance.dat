Some specialized statutes reward <b>active</b> <b>repentance</b> after an offense is committed, the conspiracy statutes for example, but these remain the exception.

Later on in the article the Author focuses upon the offence subject and the features determining the enforcement proceedings. Finally, he deals with the subject since he considers that an offence specified in Art. 298 of the Penal Code is an oriented offence, which means that it is determined by a specific aim (obtaining the indemnity).
