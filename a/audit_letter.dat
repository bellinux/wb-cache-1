5000|$|Dreier {{distributed}} fake {{financial statements}} and <b>audit</b> opinion <b>letters</b> of a reputable accounting firm and recruited assistance to represent legitimate companies {{involved in the}} transactions, including false e-mail addresses and telephone numbers. Dreier directed that two purchasers of the bogus notes wire payment to his law firm's escrow account. At least one purchaser discovered the fraud and received the return of its investment. There is an unaccounting of approximately $100 million in known proceeds {{from the sale of}} the bogus notes. Dreier had been offering fictitious promissory notes in the name of former client, Solow Realty, a New York real estate development company. Since at least October 2008, Dreier had approached at least three different investment funds with an offer to sell, at a deep discount, various short-term, unsecured promissory notes, ostensibly issued by Solow. Two of the investment funds agreed to purchase the notes (one fund purchased notes in two separate transactions) and forwarded the payments of approximately $113 million to an account in the name of [...] "Dreier LLP Attorney Trust Account". A third fund was offered the notes, but declined to participate. All of the offers were accompanied by documents that Dreier subsequently admitted he knew were fabricated. Dreier offered the notes for sale even though he knew Solow had never issued them, had not authorized Dreier to market them, and knew nothing of their existence. Dreier had provided the hedge funds with fabricated documents including a [...] "form" [...] note and related agreements, [...] "audited financial statements", and purported <b>audit</b> <b>letters,</b> which bore the forged signature of Solow's auditor, but which were printed on purported stationery of Solow's auditing firm. Dreier never told the representatives from the hedge funds that the entire marketing and sales plan was fictitious.|$|R
50|$|In 2011, <b>audit</b> <b>letters</b> {{were sent}} to five donors to a now-defunct {{conservative}} 501(c)(4) group, Freedom's Watch, which {{were involved in the}} 2008 election cycle. The goal of the audit was to assess whether or not gift taxes needed to be paid on these donors' donations to Freedom's Watch. The Congressional Research Service said that the audit was legally well-founded, as tax law exempts only 501(c)(3) and 527 groups from gift taxes. However, Ari Fleischer, {{a board member of the}} group, alleged that the group was being singled out. According to tax experts, the IRS had not been enforcing that law, but tax lawyers had advised their clients that they might owe the tax, leading to a situation where some paid and some did not. The audit appeared to indicate a new emphasis on enforcing the law, but political opposition from Republicans in Congress led to the IRS dropping the audit and publicly announcing that it would not levy gift taxes on contributions to 501(c)(4) groups. Inspector General J. Russell George's report recommended that the IRS create clearer rules and conduct more training for employees on 501(c)(4) issues, including gift tax exemptions.|$|R

The title is "The tax auditing function implementation analysis {{in order to improve}} the compliance of taxpayers in the Tax Service Office in Probolinggo. The purpose of this research knows about the tax auditing implementation to the tax obligation for improving the compliance and awareness in order to perform their duty as obligation. For analyzing the tax auditing function implementation were use the organization structure which was applied in the Tax Service Office in Probolinggo, the tax auditor criteria, the tax auditing implementation procedures, and the form or reports which were use by tax auditor. Those analyses were supported by some ratio which had influenced on the tax auditing implementation and tax obligation. The result of the research refers to the organization structure that had match with the standard of directorate general. Actually those things were prevailed for all the tax service offices in Indonesia. But the structure had some lack of auditing section had made the auditor team work become more, this case had influenced to the completion percentage of the tax <b>auditing</b> command <b>letter</b> which never reached 100 %. The criteria of the auditors in the tax service office in Probolinggo need to be improved, especially for the educational background of the auditor team members who formerly was Diploma 1 of taxation can be improved to the D 3.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{see whether}} some {{sections}} of the BMJ attract more comment than others, whether letters submitted in response to different {{sections of the}} journal are rejected at different rates, and whether the balance between letters that agree and disagree with articles in the published correspondence reflects that in submitted letters. DESIGN [...] Retrospective <b>audit</b> of <b>letters</b> submitted for publication in the correspondence columns of the BMJ in response to articles published between 1 January and 21 May 1989. SUBJECTS [...] A total of 1319 letters received by the journal, 974 submitted {{in response to the}} 1501 published articles and a further 345 raising new issues. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] The total numbers of letters submitted in response to the four main sections of the journal [...] editorials, news, papers, and middles [...] and the numbers published. Submitted and published letters were analysed according to whether they agreed or disagreed with articles. RESULTS [...] The overall rejection rate was 63 % (831 / 1319), but among letters relating to articles it was 56 % (543 / 974). Editorials and middles attracted proportionately more letters than papers, but letters relating to papers had a lower rejection rate (43 % v 57 % for editorials and 43 % v 66 % for middles). For all sections more letters disagreed than agreed, but a higher proportion of letters in response to editorials and middles disagreed than those submitted in response to papers (64 % and 72 % v 53 %). Among the published letters, however, broadly equal numbers of letters agreed and disagreed with articles, irrespective of section. CONCLUSION [...] Those sections of the journal that aim at stimulating debate succeeded in attracting the most comment. The relative importance of original scientific research papers was reflected by the priority given to letters submitted in response to papers, and the final correspondence column was a balanced platform of debate despite an unequal submitted response in terms of letters that agreed and disagreed with different sections of the journal...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} a {{tax enforcement}} field experiment in Denmark. In the base year, a stratified and {{representative sample of}} over 40, 000 individual income tax filers was selected for the experiment. Half of the tax filers were randomly selected to be thoroughly audited, while the rest were deliberately not audited. The following year, threat-of-audit letters were randomly assigned and sent to tax filers in both groups. We present three main empirical findings. First, using baseline audit data, {{we find that the}} tax evasion rate is close to zero for income subject to third-party reporting, but substantial for self-reported income. Since most income is subject to third-party reporting, the overall evasion rate is modest. Second, using quasi-experimental variation created by large kinks in the income tax schedule, we find that marginal tax rates {{have a positive impact on}} tax evasion for self-reported income, but that this effect is small in comparison to legal avoidance and behavioral responses. Third, using the randomization of enforcement, we find that prior <b>audits</b> and threat-of-audit <b>letters</b> have significant effects on self-reported income, but no effect on third-party reported income. All these empirical results can be explained by extending the standard model of (rational) tax evasion to allow for the key distinction between self-reported and third-party reported income...|$|R
40|$|Consensus {{guidelines}} {{for the management of}} patients with inflammatory bowel disease were produced by gastroenterologists, gastrointestinal surgeons and a cross-section of general practitioners (GPs) from Leicestershire in order to develop a seamless pattern of care with a common approach to diagnosis and treatment. It was hoped that the guidelines would encourage a movement towards care in the community for many patients with stable disease and so speed up new consultation rates. The study then assessed the impact of these guidelines on the referral letters of GPs to hospital consultants, the prediction of disease and adherence to them on re-referring patients after discharge. The guidelines were distributed to all 487  GPs in the Leicester Health Authority area and the gastroenterology teams within the hospitals. The value of the guidelines was assessed by an <b>audit</b> of referral <b>letters,</b> the length of time from referral letter to out-patient appointment, {{both before and after the}} launch of the guidelines, adherence to the guidelines on re-referral, and monitoring the outcome of the discharged patients. Whilst the guidelines may have helped GPs to manage stable patients in the community, the content of referral letters and the diagnostic abilities of GPs were not seen to improve since the launch of the guidelines. However, only 5 % of stable patients who were discharged from one clinic were re-referred for inflammatory bowel disease.    Keywords: guidelines; audit; inflammatory bowel diseas...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} {{efficiency}} of referral to an outpatient clinic and particularly the differences between referrals from general practitioners practising in health centres and those from other general practitioners. Design: Retrospective <b>audit</b> of referral <b>letters</b> and case notes by comparison with externally set standards of appropriateness of referrals over two years. Setting: Outpatient hypertension clinic at Western Infirmary, Glasgow. Patients: 306 Consecutive new referrals of patients over two years (1 May 1986 to 30 April 1988), for whom case notes were available in 298. Main outcome measures: Congruence of referrals with each of two standards of appropriateness based on published opinion on specialist referral (standard 1 was stricter than standard 2) and completeness of referall letters. Results: Of the 298 referrals, those from general practitioners accounted for 205, from other hospital departmentS 68, and from other sources 25. Overall, 84 referrals of the 205 from general practice met the first standard AND 134 met the second, more lenient standard. 58 Referral letters from outside the hospital had some item missing. Referrals from general practitioners working in health centRes (a fifth of the total) {{were significantly more likely}} to meet both standards (P < 0. 01) and to send a complete referral letter (p < 0. 001) than the 145 referred by other general practitioners.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{a randomized}} tax enforcement experiment in Denmark. In the base year, a stratified and {{representative sample of}} over 40, 000 individual income tax filers was selected for the experiment. Half of the tax filers were randomly selected to be thoroughly audited, while the rest were deliberately not audited. The following year, "threat-of-audit" letters were randomly assigned and sent to tax filers in both groups. Using comprehensive administrative tax data, we present four main findings. First, {{we find that the}} tax evasion rate is very small (0. 3 %) for income subject to third-party reporting, but substantial (37 %) for self-reported income. Since 95 % of all income is third-party reported, the overall evasion rate is very modest. Second, using bunching evidence around large and salient kink points of the nonlinear income tax schedule, we find that marginal tax rates {{have a positive impact on}} tax evasion, but that this effect is small in comparison to avoidance responses. Third, we find that prior audits substantially increase self-reported income, implying that individuals update their beliefs about detection probability based on experiencing an <b>audit.</b> Fourth, threat-of-audit <b>letters</b> also have a significant effect on self-reported income, and the size of this effect depends positively on the audit probability expressed in the letter. All these empirical results can be explained by extending the standard model of (rational) tax evasion to allow for the key distinction between self-reported and third-party reported incomes. ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} the impact an empowerment strategy may have {{when applied to}} public sector employees delivering Environmental Services. The study employs a case study method as its central research strategy with ten sample local authorities chosen as strategic informants. The key issues considered were {{the relevance of the}} appropriate structure within the organisation, the importance of employee engagement, the impact of the management or leadership style, and the opportunity for implementation of an empowerment strategy. Primary data collection was through twenty eight semi-structured interviews including Heads of Service, Service Managers, Supervisors and Front Line Operational Employees. Secondary data included Best Value Reviews, Comprehensive Performance Assessments, as well as Annual <b>Audit</b> Inspection <b>Letters</b> specific to the chosen sample. The research findings support the assumption that an empowered and empowering workforce can contribute to service improvement and also support the assumptions that other key drivers must also be in place to enable and facilitate that improvement. The research recognises those additional key drivers as engagement, corporate ambition, leadership style, training, resources, external constraints, task complexity, rewards and levels of and opportunities for innovation that contribute to the performance level of the organisation. Some or all of these drivers are evident in the sample authorities both from assessment reports as well as interview data. The research findings also suggest that there are many interpretations of empowerment with the most common understanding being simply the opportunity to change the way things are done but only after prior consultation with line managers. Line managers in the study group wanted to voice support for empowerment but in reality their actions fell short of an explicit strategy with a clear definition. Involvement in decision making by the front line employees was evident but fell short of a declaration of empowerment. The golden thread of empowerment appears to be dangled just out of reach of this group. The study contributes to existing empowerment literature but also to the specific impact of empowerment in a public service environment. It is important because it focuses on a service area that is experienced and used by the vast majority of citizens. The impact of poor or declining environmental services as well as high quality and improving environmental services is immediately noticeable by all that experience it. It is a service where a strategy of empowerment should bring about a noticeable change in quality...|$|R
