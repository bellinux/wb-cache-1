40|$|This {{paper is}} dealing with the {{relationships}} between HRM, company performance <b>and</b> <b>employee</b> well-being. The relationship between S/HRM and company performance has received much attention in prior literature, while the employee perspective has been widely neglected in this research tradition. The {{purpose of this paper is}} two-fold: first, to identify and evaluate how company performance <b>and</b> <b>employee</b> well-being are related, and, secondly, to evaluate the possibilities of HR policies and practices to impact on company performance <b>and</b> <b>employee</b> well-being. The results indicate that the relationship between company performance <b>and</b> <b>employee</b> well-being is weak and difficult to grasp. And such is the direct link between HRM <b>and</b> <b>employee</b> well-being, which is better explained by typical work-related factors. Instead, HR practices are relatively good predictors of company performance...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The paper aims at {{investigating}} the processes underlying {{the relationship between}} transformational leadership <b>and</b> <b>employee</b> creativity. We hypothesized that promotion focus mediates the relationship between transformational leadership <b>and</b> <b>employee</b> creativity <b>and</b> that creative process engagement mediates the relationship between promotion focus <b>and</b> <b>employee</b> creativity. Design/Methodology/Approach: We conducted a three-wave longitudinal study with 279 <b>employees</b> <b>and</b> used a path-modeling approach to test our hypotheses. Findings: Our results provide support for a sequential mediation model. Promotion focus mediated the relationship between transformational leadership <b>and</b> <b>employee</b> creativity. Creative process engagement partially mediated the relationship between promotion focus <b>and</b> <b>employee</b> creativity. Implications: Findings of this study help to understand how transformational leadership fosters creativity by highlighting the role of promotion focus and creative process engagement. Understanding the relationship between transformational leadership and creativity helps supervisors to create a work environment that fosters employee creativity. Originality/Value: This study {{contributes to the literature}} by identifying the mediating mechanism for the relationship between transformational leadership <b>and</b> <b>employee</b> creativity <b>and</b> providing a comprehensive model that illustrates the importance of the different stages within the creative process as antecedents of employee creativity...|$|R

5|$|In February 1974, President Nixon {{proposed}} {{more comprehensive}} health insurance reform—an employer mandate to offer {{private health insurance}} if employees volunteered to pay 25 percent of premiums, replacement of Medicaid by state-run health insurance plans available to all with income-based premiums and cost sharing, and replacement of Medicare with a new federal program that eliminated the limit on hospital days, added income-based out-of-pocket limits, and added outpatient prescription drug coverage. In April 1974, Kennedy and Mills introduced a bill for near-universal national health insurance with benefits identical to the expanded Nixon plan—but with mandatory participation by employers <b>and</b> <b>employees</b> through payroll taxes—both plans were criticized by labor, consumer, and senior citizen organizations because of their substantial cost sharing. In August 1974, after Nixon's resignation and President Ford's call for health insurance reform, Mills tried to advance a compromise based on Nixon's plan—but with mandatory participation by employers <b>and</b> <b>employees</b> through premiums to private health insurance companies—but gave up when unable to get more than a 13–12 majority of his committee to support his compromise plan.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Work {{motivation}} (intrinsic & extrinsic) <b>and</b> <b>employee</b> engagement is the hot {{issues for}} today’s management. Employee’s motivation {{has been in}} discussion for years, different compensation plans and strategies were adopted over years to make employees more productive. Recently, the introduction of employee engagement as a new construct to business, management, and human resource management fields make it an imperative to adopt in organizational settings. Many studies made indirect link between work motivation (intrinsic & extrinsic) <b>and</b> <b>employee</b> engagement. Moreover, motivational factors (intrinsic & extrinsic) are often considered {{a useful tool for}} employee engagement. But very few studies investigated the direct relationship between work motivation (intrinsic & extrinsic) <b>and</b> <b>employee</b> engagement. Purpose: This study explored the relationship between work motivation (Intrinsic & Extrinsic) <b>and</b> <b>employee</b> engagement. Moreover, the study also examined the impact of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation on employee engagement.   Methodology: In order to fulfill the research purpose, quantitative study was adopted. Questionnaires were designed using Google survey tool. 187 questionnaires were collected from employees of Allied Bank of Pakistan. Later on, SPSS was used to perform the required test of descriptive statistics, reliability analysis, bivariate correlation, ANOVA test and multiple regression analysis.   Findings: The results of SPSS revealed strong agreement of respondents to positive relationship between intrinsic motivation <b>and</b> <b>employee</b> engagement, <b>and</b> extrinsic motivation <b>and</b> <b>employee</b> engagement. Four intrinsic factors namely interesting work, job appreciation, satisfaction and stress, and four extrinsic factors namely job security, good wages, promotion & growth and recognition were considered important by respondents for engagement.   Conclusion: From the findings it is concluded that there is positive relationship between intrinsic motivation <b>and</b> <b>employee</b> engagement, <b>and</b> extrinsic motivation <b>and</b> <b>employee</b> engagement. Furthermore, it is also accomplished that both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation has strong positive impact on employee engagement. From the results it is also concluded that the relationship and impact of extrinsic motivation was stronger on employee engagement as compared to intrinsic motivation.       The study will enrich the current literature of work motivation <b>and</b> <b>employee</b> engagement. On practical level this study will not only help practitioners and consultants but also bank management will also be equipped with useful information regarding work motivation <b>and</b> <b>employee</b> engagement in organizational settings...|$|R
