A Rose makes the important decisions within this group, since she has control over the student council. Candidates for the position, which lasts through the school year, are chosen through an election. Any student can run to become a Rose, although the position is usually given to the en boutons, the Roses' petite sœurs.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of George XII in December 1800, the Russian general Ivan Lazarev issued the Tsar Paul I's order to <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> royal family, {{beginning}} with Darejan, forbidding the nomination of any heir to the throne. After Paul's death in March 1801, Darejan applied to the new tsar, Alexander I, to confirm her eldest son, Iulon, as the new king and protect her and her kin from harassment from George XII's heir Prince David and his supporters. However, the Russian government proceeded with the outright annexation of the Georgian kingdom, bringing the millennium of the Bagratid rule in Georgia to an end.|$|E

However, they are ambushed by Zeke, the man behind the Titan invasions and the spies, leading an army of Titans including the Colossal Titan against them. The battle ends with Zeke retreating, and the Colossal Titan defeated and killed by Armin, who became a Titan Shifter like Eren, but at the cost of the lives of almost <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> expedition, including the commander of the Survey Corps, Erwin Smith.|$|E
5|$|For {{some time}} Monteux had {{felt that he}} should leave the SFSO. He had two main reasons: he {{believed}} that a conductor should not remain in one post for too long, and he wished {{to be free to}} accept more invitations to appear with other orchestras. He resigned from the SFSO {{at the end of the}} 1952 season. He briefly reappeared on the podium at the War Memorial Opera House within a year, as co-conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra's coast-to-coast American tour, at Munch's invitation. Almost <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SFSO were in the audience, and joined in the ovation given to their former chief.|$|E

5|$|The {{people were}} allowed to enter to the Congress on April 1, 10:00.

The event was attended by the former presidents Carlos Menem, Fernando de la Rúa, Eduardo Duhalde and Néstor Kirchner, <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Supreme Court of Argentina, mayor Mauricio Macri, governor Daniel Scioli, the president of Uruguay Tabaré Vázquez and several other politicians.

A three-way dance was next, with Tajiri facing Little Guido Maritato and Super Crazy. Tajiri was accompanied {{to the ring}} by The Sinister Minister and Mikey Whipwreck, and Guido was accompanied by his fellow F.B.I. members. One {{of the highlights of}} the match occurred when Super Crazy deliver a moonsault off the balcony onto <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> F.B.I. Guido was the first eliminated when Whipwreck delivered a Whipper Snapper while the referee was distracted. Tajiri picked up the three count to eliminate Guido.

5|$|According to the statutes, the Foundation {{consists}} of a board of five Swedish or Norwegian citizens, with its seat in Stockholm. The Chairman of the Board is appointed by the Swedish King in Council, with the other four members appointed by the trustees of the prize-awarding institutions. An Executive Director is chosen from among the board members, a Deputy Director is appointed by the King in Council, and two deputies are appointed by the trustees. However, since 1995, <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> board have been chosen by the trustees, and the Executive Director and the Deputy Director appointed by the board itself. As well as the board, the Nobel Foundation {{is made up of}} the prize-awarding institutions (the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, the Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institute, the Swedish Academy, and the Norwegian Nobel Committee), the trustees of these institutions, and auditors.|$|E
5|$|Alfonsín died {{at home on}} 31March 2009, {{at the age of}} 82, {{after being}} {{diagnosed}} a year before with lung cancer. The streets around his house at the Santa Fe avenue were filled with hundreds of people, who started a candlelight vigil. The radical Julio Cobos, Fernández de Kirchner's vice president, was the acting president at the moment and ordered three days of national mourning. There was a ceremony in the Congress, where his body was displayed in the Blue Hall, that was attended by almost a thousand people. His widow María Lorenza Barreneche could not attend the funeral, because of her own poor health. It was attended by former presidents Carlos Menem, Fernando delaRúa, Eduardo Duhalde and Néstor Kirchner, <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Supreme Court of Argentina, mayor Mauricio Macri, governor Daniel Scioli, the president of Uruguay Tabaré Vázquez and several other politicians.

5|$|<b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{cast for}} the {{production}} were from Britain or the Commonwealth. Later in the season, one of England's few pre-war international opera stars, Eva Turner, appeared as Turandot. For the company's second season, eminent singers from continental Europe were recruited, including Ljuba Welitsch, Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, Paolo Silveri, Rudolf Schock and Set Svanholm. Other international stars {{who were willing to}} re-learn their roles in English for the company in its early years included Kirsten Flagstad and Hans Hotter for The Valkyrie. Nevertheless, even as early as 1948, the opera in English policy was weakening; the company was obliged to present some Wagner performances in German to recruit leading exponents of the main roles. At first Rankl conducted all the productions; he was dismayed when eminent guest conductors including Beecham, Clemens Krauss and Erich Kleiber were later invited for prestige productions. By 1951 Rankl felt that he was no longer valued, and announced his resignation. In Haltrecht's view, the company that Rankl built up from nothing had outgrown him.|$|E
5|$|Bohrium is {{the fifth}} member of the 6d series of {{transition}} metals and the heaviest member of group 7 in the periodic table, below manganese, technetium and rhenium. <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> group readily portray their group oxidation state of +7 and the state becomes more stable as the group is descended. Thus bohrium is expected to form a stable +7 state. Technetium also shows a stable +4 state whilst rhenium exhibits stable +4 and +3 states. Bohrium may therefore show these lower states as well. The higher +7 oxidation state {{is more likely to}} exist in oxyanions, such as perbohriate, , analogous to the lighter permanganate, pertechnetate, and perrhenate. Nevertheless, bohrium(VII) is likely to be unstable in aqueous solution, and would probably be easily reduced to the more stable bohrium(IV).|$|E
5|$|Gandhi {{opposition}} to the Indian participation in the World War II was motivated by his belief that India could not be party to a war ostensibly being fought for democratic freedom while that freedom was denied to India itself. He also condemned Nazism and Fascism, a view which won endorsement of other Indian leaders. As the war progressed, Gandhi intensified his demand for independence, calling for the British to Quit India in a 1942 speech in Mumbai. This was Gandhi's and the Congress Party's most definitive revolt aimed at securing the British exit from India. The British government responded quickly to the Quit India speech, and within hours after Gandhi's speech arrested Gandhi and <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Congress Working Committee. His countrymen retaliated the arrests by damaging or burning down hundreds of government owned railway stations, police stations, and cutting down telegraph wires.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, {{a backup}} relief party of 77 teams and wagons was {{making its way}} east to provide {{additional}} assistance to the Martin Company. After passing Fort Bridger {{the leaders of the}} backup party concluded that the Martin Company must have wintered east of the Rockies, so they turned back. When word of the returning backup relief party was communicated to Young, he ordered the courier to return and tell them to turn back east and continue until they found the handcart company, but several days had been lost. On November 18 the backup party met the Martin Company with the greatly needed supplies. At last <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> handcart party were now able to ride in wagons. The 104 wagons carrying the Martin Company arrived in Salt Lake City on November 30; at least 145 members of the company had lost their lives. Many of the survivors had to have fingers, toes, or limbs amputated due to severe frostbite.|$|E
5|$|On Shackleton's return home, public honours {{were quickly}} forthcoming.

He was honoured by the Royal Geographical Society, who awarded him a Gold Medal; a proposal that the medal be smaller than that earlier awarded to Captain Scott was not acted on. <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nimrod Expedition shore party received silver Polar Medals on 23 November, with Shackleton receiving a clasp to his earlier medal. Shackleton was also appointed a Younger Brother of Trinity House, a significant honour for British mariners.|$|E
