40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} meshfree {{particle}} method for simulations of continuous motion, which is particularly suitable for complex problems such as free surfaces and multiphase flows, moving boundaries etc. Such modeling features frequently occur in many industrial applications, rendering FPM a unique tool for efficient and robust simulation such processes. We will concentrate on industrial applications, especially cutting processes in metal industry. FPM is Lagrangian method. A fluid domain is first replaced by a discrete number of points, which {{are referred to as}} particles. Each particle carries <b>all</b> continuous <b>information,</b> like <b>density,</b> velocity, temperature etc. In the Lagrangian method, particles move with fluid velocity. In fact, particles themselves can be considered as geometrical grids of the fluid domain. Spatial approximations are performed using a specialized version of the moving least squares idea, the so called FPM-MLS, which implements stability criteria for general finite difference approaches...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – Interface design often {{overlooks the}} problem of visual <b>information</b> <b>density.</b> This problem is {{concerned}} with how uniform a set of data is laid out on a display. It tries to avoid both clutter and sparsity of data as those two problems {{have a negative effect}} on the efficient use of display space. Since visual density is part of the perception process, it has to be dealt on this basis. This paper tries to lay down the concepts of ecological perception and relate them to {{the problem of}} visual <b>information</b> <b>density.</b> A new approach is inspired by this relation. This approach is based on depth layout which provides a more natural interface and introduces more affordances and flexibility than normal interfaces.

40|$|Incremental {{dialogue}} {{systems are}} often perceived as more responsive and natural {{because they are}} able to address phenomena of turn-taking and overlapping speech, such as backchannels or barge-ins. Previous work in this area has often identified distinctive prosodic features, or features relating to syntactic or semantic completeness, as marking appropriate places of turn-taking. In a separate strand of work, psycholinguistic studies have established a connection between <b>information</b> <b>density</b> and prominence in language—the less expected a linguistic unit is in a particular context, {{the more likely it is}} to be linguistically marked. This has been observed across linguistic levels, including the prosodic, which plays an important role in predicting overlapping speech. In this article, we explore the hypothesis that <b>information</b> <b>density</b> (ID) also plays a role in turn-taking. Specifically, we aim to show that humans are sensitive to the peaks and troughs of <b>information</b> <b>density</b> in speech, and that overlapping speech at ID troughs is perceived as more acceptable than overlaps at ID peaks. To test our hypothesis, we collect human ratings for three models of generating overlapping speech based on features of: (1) prosody and semantic or syntactic completeness, (2) <b>information</b> <b>density,</b> and (3) both types of information.

40|$|As {{with any}} sensory input, music might be {{expected}} to incorporate the processing of information about the safety of the environment. Little research has been done on how such processing has evolved and how different kinds of sounds may affect the experience of certain environments. In this article, we investigate if music, as a form of auditory information, can trigger the experience of safety. We hypothesized that (1) there should be an optimal, subjectively preferred degree of <b>information</b> <b>density</b> of musical sounds, at which safety-related information can be processed optimally; (2) any deviation from the optimum, that is, both higher and lower levels of <b>information</b> <b>density,</b> should elicit experiences of higher stress and danger; and (3) in general, sonic scenarios with music should reduce experiences of stress and danger more than other scenarios. In Experiment 1, the <b>information</b> <b>density</b> of short music-like rhythmic stimuli was manipulated via their tempo. In an initial session, listeners adjusted the tempo of the stimuli to what they deemed an appropriate tempo. In an ensuing session, the same listeners judged their experienced stress and danger in response to the same stimuli, as well as stimuli exhibiting tempo variants. Results are consistent with the existence of an optimum <b>information</b> <b>density</b> for a given rhythm; the preferred tempo decreased for increasingly complex rhythms. The hypothesis that any deviation from the optimum would lead to experiences of higher stress and danger was only partly fit by the data. In Experiment 2, listeners should indicate their experience of stress and danger in response to different sonic scenarios: music, natural sounds, and silence. As expected, the music scenarios were associated with lowest stress and danger whereas both natural sounds and silence resulted in higher stress and danger. Overall, the results largely fit the hypothesis that music seemingly carries safety-related information about the environment...|$|R
