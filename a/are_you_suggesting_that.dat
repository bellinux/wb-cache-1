5000|$|Interviewer <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> {{members of}} the Gush Shalom ("Peace Bloc") group who made those {{comments}} {{should be placed on}} trial for treason? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know where}} Miss Gascoyne <b>is,</b> but <b>you</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> had {{something}} to ask me, and I shall be busy by and by," [...] he said.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, father," [...] {{said our}} hero {{with a modest}} look, [...] "it may <b>be,</b> as <b>you</b> <b>suggest,</b> <b>that</b> Winnie Van der Kemp does not care for me more than for a fathom of salt water--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Right! How <b>are</b> <b>you</b> right? Have <b>you</b> <b>been</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that,</b> my dear?" [...] demanded my wife, with {{a gentle}} despair of me in her voice.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{tells me}} so," [...] she answered, with a laugh. [...] "How uncourtier-like <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> Paul! Do <b>you</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> any man {{could see me}} and not love me?" ...|$|R
3000|$|Thank {{you for the}} offer, but it won’t work. There <b>is</b> nothing <b>you</b> can <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> I haven’t {{been through}} a hundred times myself. (157) [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It is an {{extraordinary}} story,' Mr. Singleton said, when he heard it all. 'I cannot doubt <b>that</b> it <b>is</b> as <b>you</b> <b>suggest.</b> <b>That</b> my little Dorothy should behave {{in this way is}} too ridiculous to be believed for a moment; though I own that I should have been ready, if obliged, to swear in court that it was she who came to me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is no {{such thing}} as the right man," [...] said Ann resolutely, [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> there is a type of man in {{existence}} who is capable of inspiring what is called romantic love. I believe in marriage. [...] ." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In the calmest {{season of}} the year, the surf will hinder any such operation. And you will also {{bear in mind that}} if landing <b>were</b> {{possible}} as <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>suggesting,</b> <b>that</b> landing could not be covered by the ships' guns. In fact, it is the landing parties would be in danger from their own artillery." ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the way preschoolers relate events in a story. Twelve Mandarin-speaking preschoolers served as subjects; their {{narratives}} were elicited {{through the use of}} a picture book, Frog, where <b>are</b> <b>you?</b> Our data <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> children’s progression from treating single, unrelated events to related ones requires proper linguistic and cognitive capacities. The data also support earlier findings that most 5 -year-olds are not able to relate a chain of events well. Additionally, it is found that there is dissociation in abilities for producing linguistic expressions and for inferring relations between events. We try to interpret the dissociation in terms of Karmiloff-Smith’s problem-solving model...|$|R
500|$|Sotomayor {{cast her}} first vote as an {{associate}} Supreme Court justice on August 17, 2009, in a stay of execution case. She was given a warm welcome onto the Court and was formally invested in a September 8 ceremony. Sotomayor's inaugural case in which she heard arguments was on September 9 during a special session, Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission. It involved the controversial aspect of the First Amendment {{and the rights of}} corporations in campaign finance; Sotomayor dissented. In her vigorous examination of Floyd Abrams, representing the First Amendment issues in the case, Sotomayor challenged him, questioning 19th century rulings of the Court and saying, [...] "What <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the courts, who created corporations as persons, gave birth to corporations as persons, and there could be an argument made that that was the Court's error to start with ... a creature of State law with human characteristics." ...|$|R
6000|$|But, Senor Valdes, Senor Valdes! Do not {{you know}} that this small {{condition}} of yours implies in its fulfilment hardly less than the gift of the whole earth? You merely ask that the character portrayed in fiction <b>be</b> human; and <b>you</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> the novelist should study humanity if he would know whether his personages are human. This appears to me the cruelest irony, the most sarcastic affectation of humility. If you had asked that character in fiction be superhuman, or subterhuman, or preterhuman, or intrahuman, and had bidden the novelist go, not to humanity, but the humanities, for the proof of his excellence, it would have been all very easy. The books are full of those [...] "creations," [...] of every pattern, of all ages, of both sexes; and it is so much handier to get at books than to get at Men; and when you have portrayed [...] "passion" [...] instead of feeling, and used [...] "power" [...] instead of common-sense, and shown yourself a [...] "genius" [...] instead of an artist, the applause is so prompt and the glory so cheap, that really anything else seems wickedly wasteful of one's time. One may not make one's reader enjoy or suffer nobly, but one may give him the kind of pleasure that arises from conjuring, or from a puppet-show, or a modern stage-play, and leave him, if he is an old fool, in the sort of stupor that comes from hitting the pipe; or if he is a young fool, half crazed with the spectacle of qualities and impulses like his own in an apotheosis of achievement and fruition far beyond any earthly experience.|$|R
6000|$|... "Because <b>you</b> <b>are</b> {{responsible}} for the whole affair. You introduced Douglas to her. <b>You</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> he should bring her home. Go to her to-morrow and ascertain her intentions." ...|$|R
6000|$|But Binet was {{far from}} agreement. [...] "Are <b>you</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> Polichinelle should play Scaramouche?" [...] he asked, incredulously.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> I dismiss Wilding?" [...] {{cried the}} Duke. [...] "You know his influence, {{and the bad}} {{impression}} his removal would leave." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh yes, it is {{a perfect}} thing in its way. Don't {{say a word to}} her; but if <b>you</b> <b>are</b> {{consulted}} for my next birthday present, Grace, couldn't <b>you</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> one does cease to be a girl." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am in your hands,' he cried. 'What would <b>you</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> {{we should}} do? Would {{it not be}} best that I should remain here?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As {{a matter}} of fact, it was Miss Kenwardine to whom you owed most," [...] Jake said meaningly. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> she's dangerous, too?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By the Blood of God, boy! Do you {{imply that}} I had knowledge? Do <b>you</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> I would have bought any life {{at such a}} price?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are insolent!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "You will be {{good enough}} to answer questions, not to ask them. Answer me, then. Do <b>you</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> I have your necklace?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Odds death!" [...] blazed Grey, {{giving a}} free rein to his dislike of this calm gentleman. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> a man's honour is imperilled in His Grace's service?" ...|$|R
60|$|MRS LUTESTRING. I am {{at present}} in my {{two hundred and}} seventy-fifth year. <b>You</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> I should take {{advantage}} of the innocence of a child of thirty, and marry it.|$|R
6000|$|Her colour rose. [...] "Well, sir? What do <b>you</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> I implied or {{seemed to}} imply?" [...] But as {{suddenly}} her manner changed. [...] "I {{think we are}} too concerned with trifles where the matter on which I have sought <b>you</b> <b>is</b> a serious one." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Stop!" [...] I cried, {{putting out}} a hand as if I would cover her mouth. Then {{collecting}} myself. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> Cosimo could lend himself to so infamous a compact?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Since <b>you</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> my {{presence}} {{may be of}} service to <b>you,</b> I <b>am</b> happy that circumstances should have delayed my departure," [...] was his lordship's courteous answer. [...] "A chair, Dom Miguel." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's a {{difficult}} situation, Bellamy," [...] he said. [...] "You are asking {{a great deal}} when <b>you</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> we should interfere in the slightest manner with the course of justice. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> absolutely convinced, I suppose, that this man Laverick {{had nothing to do}} with the murder?" ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{also failed}} to understand; but a light broke in upon me. [...] "Did <b>you</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> he should?" [...] I asked, and the girl {{answered}} with some reluctance: [...] "Yes; was it not natural that I should?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course!" [...] said Jimmy gravely. [...] "Nobody {{would expect}} {{anything}} else from you. I don't mind admitting that I {{have been a}} little anxious about what Eleanor might do--but we'll change the subject. <b>You</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> Merril <b>was</b> getting into trouble?" ...|$|R
5000|$|WYSINWYW, what <b>you</b> see <b>is</b> {{not what}} <b>you</b> want, <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> Microsoft Word often {{controls}} the user, {{not the other}} way around ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Are <b>you</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> we may meet Mr. Lessingham?" [...] Helen enquired, lazily. [...] "I am {{perfectly}} {{certain that}} he knows nothing of the equipment of the melodramatic spy. As to Zeppelins, don't you remember {{he told us that}} he hated them and was terrified of bombs." ...|$|R
6000|$|Andre-Louis {{expelled}} a {{cloud of}} smoke. [...] "You cannot wish to <b>be</b> offensive. Yet <b>you</b> almost <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> I live on other men's leavings." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Since {{she was at}} Rio Frio {{when she}} sent the note, it is plain that Gomez added the few lines that led you into the trap. But we must think how we can rescue Mr. Grahame. <b>You</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> the men who came with you from San Lucar have no plans?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Adrea, {{you talk}} like a child," [...] he said sternly. [...] "I made no such {{insinuation}} as <b>you</b> <b>suggest!</b> <b>You</b> know <b>that</b> I did not! Sit down!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mother!" [...] Charlotte {{broke in}} terribly upon her. [...] "Are <b>you</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> I should <b>be</b> {{married in a}} storage warehouse? Well, I haven't fallen quite so low as that yet. If I can't have a home wedding, I will have a church wedding, and I will wait till doomsday for it if necessary." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I fancy it <b>is.</b> <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>suggesting</b> {{community}} of interest? Still, I scarcely realize {{how a man}} with empty pockets could be of very much use to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Robina, [...] "I have." [...] I {{gathered}} from her tone that the Joan of Arc expression had departed. Had Primgate wanted to paint her {{at that particular}} moment I should have suggested Katherine--during the earlier stages--listening to a curtain lecture from Petruchio. [...] "Are <b>you</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> all women should take her for a model?" ...|$|R
