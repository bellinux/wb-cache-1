5|$|Although the bat's {{status in}} Myanmar {{is not well}} known, the Thai {{population}} is restricted to a single province and {{may be at risk}} for extinction. Its potential threats are primarily <b>anthropogenic,</b> and include habitat degradation and the disturbance of roosting sites.|$|E
5|$|Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), Biosphere reserves, marine parks, {{national}} monuments {{world heritage}} status, fishery management and habitat protection can protect reefs from <b>anthropogenic</b> damage.|$|E
5|$|Porpoises {{are very}} {{sensitive}} to <b>anthropogenic</b> disturbances, and are keystone species, which can indicate the overall health of the marine environment. Populations of harbor porpoises in the North and Baltic Seas are under increasing pressure from <b>anthropogenic</b> causes such as offshore construction, ship traffic, fishing, and military exercises. Increasing pollution is a serious problem for marine mammals. Heavy metals and plastic waste are not biodegradable, and sometimes cetaceans consume these hazardous materials, mistaking them for food items. As a result, the animals are more susceptible to diseases and have fewer offspring. Harbour porpoises from the English Channel were found to have accumulated heavy metals.|$|E
5|$|There {{is a kind}} of {{continuum}} {{with three}} semi-distinct categories dealing with <b>anthropogenic</b> hybridization: hybridization without introgression, hybridization with widespread introgression (backcrossing with one of the parent species), and hybrid swarms (highly variable populations with much interbreeding as well as backcrossing with the parent species). Depending on where a population falls along this continuum, the management plans for that population will change. Hybridization is currently an area of great discussion within wildlife management and habitat management. Global climate change is creating other changes such as difference in population distributions which are indirect causes for an increase in <b>anthropogenic</b> hybridization.|$|E
5|$|Global methane {{levels in}} 2011 had {{increased}} {{by a factor}} of 2.5 since pre-industrial times: from 722 ppb to 1800 ppb, the highest value in at least 800,000 years. Methane has an <b>anthropogenic</b> global warming potential (AGWP) of 29, which means that it's 29 times stronger in heat-trapping than carbon dioxide is, over a 100-year time scale.|$|E
5|$|The early {{development}} of cultigen taxonomy follows that of plant taxonomy in general {{as the early}} listing and documentation of plants made little distinction between those that were <b>anthropogenic</b> and those that were natural wild kinds. Formal botanical nomenclature and classification evolved from the simple binomial system of folk taxonomy {{and it was not}} until the mid-19th century that the nomenclatural path of cultigens began to diverge from mainstream plant taxonomy.|$|E
5|$|The fern {{thrives in}} thin {{serpentine}} soils on sunny, disturbed habitats such as roadcuts and talus slopes, in dunite and other ultramafic rocks. <b>Anthropogenic</b> disturbance has removed thicker soils and increased sun exposure {{in many of}} these sites; for instance, many of the Quebec stations are in asbestos mines, both abandoned and active. In more natural habitats, frost weathering and erosion may promote rock fall and maintain suitable habitat.|$|E
5|$|The {{life span}} of {{peregrine}} falcons in the wild is up to 15.5years. Mortality {{in the first year}} is 59–70%, declining to 25–32% annually in adults. Apart from such <b>anthropogenic</b> threats as collision with human-made objects, the peregrine may be killed by larger hawks and owls.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} {{introduced}} to China and various parts of southern Europe in the 17th century. The species is widely naturalized elsewhere, occurring in temperate and tropical regions of Australia, South America, Mexico, the Caribbean and southeastern US states. The actual species' distribution has been suggested {{to be the result}} of human cultivation (<b>anthropogenic).</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Anthropogenic</b> ecology {{refers to}} the human impact on animals and plants in an ecosystem. A shift from medium and large game animals, such as deer, bighorn sheep, and antelope, to smaller ones like rabbits and turkey during the mid-10th to mid-13th centuries might {{indicate}} that Mesa Verdean subsistence hunting had dramatically altered faunal populations on the mesa. Analysis of pack rat midden indicates that, {{with the exception of}} invasive species such as tumbleweed and clover, the flora and fauna in the area have remained relatively consistent for the past 4,000 years.|$|E
5|$|Both {{species are}} listed as {{vulnerable}} by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. <b>Anthropogenic</b> threats include pollution, entanglement in fishing nets, and direct harvesting for their gill rakers for use in Chinese medicine. Their slow reproductive rate exacerbates these threats. They are protected in international waters by the Convention on Migratory Species of Wild Animals, but are more vulnerable closer to shore. Areas where mantas congregate are popular with tourists. Only a few public aquariums are large enough to house them.|$|E
5|$|GCC's {{advocacy}} activities included lobbying government officials, grassroots lobbying through {{press releases}} and advertising, participation in international climate conferences, {{criticism of the}} processes of international climate organizations, critiques of climate models, and personal attacks on scientists and environmentalists. Policy positions advocated by the coalition included denial of <b>anthropogenic</b> climate change, emphasizing the uncertainty in climatology, advocating for additional research, highlighting the benefits and downplaying the risks of climate change, stressing the priority of economic development, defending national sovereignty, and opposition to the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions.|$|E
5|$|Grey jays are {{classified}} as least concern (LC) according to the IUCN Red List, having stable populations over a very large area of boreal and subalpine habitats only lightly occupied by humans. Significant human impacts may nevertheless occur through <b>anthropogenic</b> climate warming. Grey jays at the northern edges of their range may benefit from the extension of spruce stands out onto formerly treeless tundra. A study of a declining population {{at the southern end}} of the grey jay's range linked the decline in reproductive success to warmer temperatures in preceding autumns. Such warm temperatures may trigger spoilage of the perishable food items stored by grey jays upon which success of late winter nesting partly depends.|$|E
5|$|Human {{activities}} have had {{positive effects on}} some species of cockatoo and negative effects on others. Many species of open country have benefited greatly from <b>anthropogenic</b> changes to the landscape, with the great increase in reliable seed food sources, available water and have also adapted well to a diet including foreign foodstuffs. This benefit appears to be restricted to Australian species, as cockatoos favouring open country outside Australia have not become more abundant. Predominantly forest-dwelling species have suffered greatly from habitat destruction; in the main, {{they appear to have}} a more specialised diet and {{have not been able to}} incorporate exotic food into their diet. A notable exception is the yellow-tailed black cockatoo in eastern Australia.|$|E
5|$|In human culture, domesticated mammals {{played a}} major role in the Neolithic revolution, causing farming to replace hunting and gathering, and leading to a major {{restructuring}} of human societies with the first civilizations. They provided, and continue to provide, power for transport and agriculture, as well as various commodities such as meat, dairy products, wool, and leather. Mammals are hunted or raced for sport, and are used as model organisms in science. Mammals have been depicted in art since Palaeolithic times, and appear in literature, film, mythology, and religion. Defaunation of mammals is primarily driven by <b>anthropogenic</b> factors, such as poaching and habitat destruction, though there are efforts to combat this.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency {{is charged}} with {{regulating}} and managing mercury contamination. Several laws give the EPA this authority, including the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and the Safe Drinking Water Act. Additionally, the Mercury-Containing and Rechargeable Battery Management Act, passed in 1996, phases out the use of mercury in batteries, and provides for the efficient and cost-effective disposal of many types of used batteries. North America contributed approximately 11% of the total global <b>anthropogenic</b> mercury emissions in 1995.|$|E
5|$|Noise {{pollution}} from <b>anthropogenic</b> activities is another major concern for marine mammals. This {{is a problem}} because underwater noise pollution interferes with the abilities of some marine mammals to communicate, and locate both predators and prey. Underwater explosions are used {{for a variety of}} purposes including military activities, construction and oceanographic or geophysical research. They can cause injuries such as hemorrhaging of the lungs, and contusion and ulceration of the gastrointestinal tract. Underwater noise is generated from shipping, the oil and gas industry, research, and military use of sonar and oceanographic acoustic experimentation. Acoustic harassment devices and acoustic deterrent devices used by aquaculture facilities to scare away marine mammals emit loud and noxious underwater sounds.|$|E
5|$|Seawater is {{slightly}} alkaline {{and had a}} preindustrial pH of about 8.2. More recently, <b>anthropogenic</b> activities have steadily increased the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere; about 30–40% of the added CO2 is absorbed by the oceans, forming carbonic acid and lowering the pH (now below 8.1) through a process called ocean acidification. on the CaCO3 System in the Oceans| journal = Science| volume = 305| issue = 5682| pages = 362–6| year = 2004| last1 = Feely | first1 = R.

5|$|Termite populations can be {{substantially}} impacted by environmental changes including those caused by human intervention. A Brazilian {{study investigated the}} termite assemblages of three sites of Caatinga under different levels of <b>anthropogenic</b> disturbance in the semi-arid region of northeastern Brazil were sampled using 65 x 2 m transects. A total of 26 species of termites {{were present in the}} three sites, and 196 encounters were recorded in the transects. The termite assemblages were considerably different among sites, with a conspicuous reduction in both diversity and abundance with increased disturbance, related to the reduction of tree density and soil cover, and with the intensity of trampling by cattle and goats. The wood-feeders were the most severely affected feeding group.|$|E
5|$|The inaccessibility of its habitat affords some {{protection}} for A.bradleyi. Quarrying and strip mining may threaten the sandstone cliffs, {{especially on the}} Cumberland Plateau. Rock climbers and botanical collectors have also damaged populations of the fern. Toxic runoff from atop cliffs can affect them, and {{they may also be}} threatened by both natural and <b>anthropogenic</b> shading of cliffs due to increased tree growth at the cliff base, invasive vines overrunning the cliff face, or the piling of slash against the cliff after logging.|$|E
5|$|While the golden-crowned sifaka faces few {{biological}} threats, such as predation, {{it faces}} many significant human-caused (<b>anthropogenic)</b> threats. Its habitat has been highly fragmented, with forest patches isolated by severely degraded grasslands. By 1985 {{it was estimated}} that 34% of the entire eastern rainforest of the island had disappeared, and by extrapolation it is predicted that at this rate of deforestation there will be no eastern rainforest left by 2020. Illegal logging practices, slash-and-burn agriculture (known as tavy), uncontrolled grass fires, gold mining, poaching, and clearing land for agricultural use have all significantly contributed to the significant deforestation witnessed in Madagascar and the ongoing decline of suitable habitat for this species.|$|E
25|$|Of {{all of the}} {{mechanisms}} of human-mediated disturbances, <b>anthropogenic</b> fire {{has become one of}} great interest to ecologists, geographers, soil scientists, and anthropologists alike. By studying the effects of <b>anthropogenic</b> fires, anthropologists have been able to identify landscape uses and requirements of past cultures. Ecologists became interested in the study of <b>anthropogenic</b> fire as to utilize methods from previous cultures to develop policies for regular burning. Geographers and soil scientists are interested in the utility of anthropic soils caused by burning in the past. The interest in <b>anthropogenic</b> fire came about {{in the wake of the}} Industrial Revolution. This time period included a mass migration from rural to urban areas, which decreased controlled burning in the countryside. This led to an increase in the frequency and strength of wildfires, thus initiating a need to develop proper prevention methods. Historical ecology focuses on the impact on landscapes through human-mediated disturbances, once such being <b>anthropogenic</b> fire. It is a fusion of ecological, geographical, anthropological, and pedological interests.|$|E
25|$|The natural diet of many corvid {{species is}} omnivorous, {{consisting}} of invertebrates, nestlings, small mammals, berries, fruits, seeds, and carrion. However, some corvids, especially the crows, have adapted well to human conditions and {{have come to}} rely on <b>anthropogenic</b> foods. In a US study of American crows, common ravens and Steller's jays around campgrounds and human settlements, the crows appeared to have the most diverse diet of all, taking <b>anthropogenic</b> foods such as bread, spaghetti, fried potatoes, dog food, sandwiches, and livestock feed. The increase in available <b>anthropogenic</b> food sources is contributing to population increase in some corvid species.|$|E

25|$|Vegetation, in some regions, emits {{environmentally}} {{significant amounts}} of Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) on warmer days. These VOCs react with primary <b>anthropogenic</b> pollutants—specifically, NOx, SO2, and <b>anthropogenic</b> organic carbon compounds — to produce a seasonal haze of secondary pollutants. Black gum, poplar, oak and willow are some examples of vegetation that can produce abundant VOCs. The VOC production from these species result in ozone levels up to eight {{times higher than the}} low-impact tree species.|$|E

25|$|Sources of air {{pollution}} sources in British Columbia may be divided between those external to the province, such as transboundary pollution, and those internal to it; and between <b>anthropogenic</b> (man-made) sources and natural sources. External <b>anthropogenic</b> sources include combustion particles and gases from industrial sources {{in the province of}} Alberta or the U.S. state of Washington. Mount St. Helens has been a significant external natural source: although located entirely in the United States, its eruption created {{air pollution}} in parts of British Columbia.|$|E
