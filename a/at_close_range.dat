5|$|The PIATs' {{ammunition}} {{used the}} Hollow charge principle, which, if the often unreliable round design delivered it correctly to the target, allowed the warhead to penetrate almost all enemy armour types <b>at</b> <b>close</b> <b>range.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{quality of}} guns, armor, ordnance, and design was {{changing}} rapidly, so experience could quickly become irrelevant. Combat {{experience in the}} Spanish–American War had shown the value of many smaller guns <b>at</b> <b>close</b> <b>range,</b> where the larger guns had been inaccurate.|$|E
5|$|As the French approached, the British lines {{held their}} fire. Wolfe had devised a firing method for {{stopping}} French column advances in 1755 {{that called for}} the centre—in this case, the 43rd and 47th Foot regiments—to hold fire {{while waiting for the}} advancing force to approach within , then open fire <b>at</b> <b>close</b> <b>range.</b>|$|E
50|$|Shotguns {{are long}} guns that are {{designed}} to fire many small projectiles at once. This makes them very effective <b>at</b> <b>close</b> <b>ranges,</b> but with diminished usefulness at long range.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{normally}} desirable {{to keep the}} sights of a firearm {{as close to the}} bore as possible, since a firearm with a large bore to sight distance will require more sight adjustment when shifting between shooting at different targets <b>at</b> <b>close</b> <b>ranges.</b> On the other hand, a firearm with a short bore to sight distance will need less sight adjustment when changing between targets <b>at</b> <b>close</b> <b>ranges.</b> <b>At</b> longer ranges the bore to sight distance will be of less importance, since gravity has affected the projectile so much that the height difference between the bore and the sight has less to say in total, compared to the bullet drop.|$|R
2500|$|With safety trials {{complete}} {{in the late}} 2000s, laser dazzlers {{have been developed for}} defensive purposes on super-yachts. They can be effective up to [...] with the effects going from mild disorientation to flash blindness <b>at</b> <b>closer</b> <b>range.</b>|$|R
5|$|During the withdraw, however, A Company {{ran into}} a sizable North Korean force and had {{scattered}} in the ensuing fight. Most of the company, including its commander were killed <b>at</b> <b>close</b> <b>range.</b> In this desperate action, Private First Class Luther H. Story, a weapons squad leader, fought so tenaciously that {{he was awarded the}} Medal of Honor. Badly wounded, Story refused to be a burden to those who might escape, and when last seen was still engaging North Korean <b>at</b> <b>close</b> <b>range.</b> Of those in the company, approximately ten men escaped to friendly lines. The next morning, under heavy fog, the group made its way by compass toward Yongsan. From a hill at 12:00, after the fog had lifted, the men looked down on the Battle of Yongsan which was then in progress. That afternoon 20 survivors of the company merged into the lines of the 72nd Tank Battalion near Yongsan. Stragglers from this position continued to stream {{in the next few days}} as well.|$|E
5|$|In Iberia, {{the western}} Mediterranean and {{northwest}} Africa, the common starling may {{be confused with}} the closely related spotless starling, the plumage of which, as its name implies, has a more uniform colour. <b>At</b> <b>close</b> <b>range</b> {{it can be seen that}} the latter has longer throat feathers, a fact particularly noticeable when it sings.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to <b>At</b> <b>Close</b> <b>Range,</b> Foley also directed the song's video. David Naylor and Sharon Oreck {{were in charge}} of the production. The video serves as a publicity campaign for the movie, as it includes brief scenes of the film that indicate the conflict the young man in the movie—played by Sean Penn—feels.|$|E
5000|$|The {{only known}} {{description}} of Knight's end {{comes from the}} victor's combat report: [...] "...I attacked him <b>at</b> <b>closest</b> <b>range....</b> I saw immediately that I had hit the enemy. First he went down in curves, then he crashed to the ground. I pursued him until 100 meters above the ground." ...|$|R
5000|$|Many now {{consider}} the [...]35SL inadequate as a deer round, {{but it may}} still be suitable for coyote or similar medium-sized game <b>at</b> <b>close</b> <b>ranges.</b> When first introduced however, the notable firearm expert Townsend Whelen noted the [...]35SL cartridge as displaying similar ballistics as the [...]38-40 black powder, low-pressure cartridge.|$|R

5|$|Monitor, to the {{surprise}} of Virginias crew, had emerged from behind Minnesota and went straight for the approaching Virginia and positioned herself between her and the grounded Minnesota, preventing the Confederate ironclad from further engaging the vulnerable wooden ship <b>at</b> <b>close</b> <b>range.</b> At 8:45am Worden gave the order to fire where Greene fired the first shots of the battle between the two ironclads which harmlessly deflected off the Confederate ironclad. During the battle Monitor fired solid shot, about once every eight minutes, while Virginia fired shell exclusively. The ironclads generally fought <b>at</b> <b>close</b> <b>range</b> for about four hours, ending at 12:15pm, ranging from a few yards to more than a hundred. Both ships were constantly in motion, maintaining a circular pattern. Because of Virginias weak engines, massive size and weight and with a draft of , she was slow and difficult to maneuver, taking her half an hour to complete a 180-degree turn.|$|E
5|$|Olfactory cues may be {{important}} in salmon, which are known {{to return to the}} exact river where they hatched. Lockley reports experimental evidence that fish such as minnows can accurately tell the difference between the waters of different rivers. Salmon may use their magnetic sense to navigate to within reach of their river, and then use olfaction to identify the river <b>at</b> <b>close</b> <b>range.</b>|$|E
5|$|As a batsman, Macaulay was {{reasonably}} good and possibly {{better than his}} statistics would suggest. He was capable of batting well in a crisis but may have been prevented from honing his batting skills by the Yorkshire leadership who wished him to focus on bowling. He generally batted low down in the order after the all-rounders in the team. Macaulay's fielding was also very effective. He was excellent <b>at</b> <b>close</b> <b>range</b> to the batsmen, particularly from his own bowling.|$|E
50|$|Sibat {{can either}} be used hand-to-hand or thrown from a distance. Blunt {{portions}} of the weapon {{could be used to}} incapacitate <b>at</b> <b>closer</b> <b>ranges.</b> These attacks can be used in conjunction; the shaft can be used to block an enemy's weapon and then followed with a thrust into the throat or stomach.|$|R
5000|$|Conversely, slower subsonic bullet {{velocities}} {{might be}} desirable <b>at</b> <b>close</b> <b>ranges</b> {{because it will}} drastically reduce the sound or noise generated by the bullet (and rifle), especially when the rifle is also fitted with a sound suppressor (commonly known as [...] "silencers"). This would help the sniper to remain concealed or undetected.|$|R

5|$|Following Sean's {{birth in}} 1975, Lennon took a hiatus {{from the music}} {{industry}} and became a househusband to care for his infant son. He resumed his songwriting career shortly before his December 1980 murder, which Ono witnessed <b>at</b> <b>close</b> <b>range.</b> She has stated that the couple was thinking about going out to dinner after spending several hours in a recording studio, but were returning to their apartment instead, because Lennon wanted to see Sean before he was put to bed. Following the murder, Ono went into complete seclusion for an extended period.|$|E
5|$|Great white sharks, {{like all}} other sharks, have an extra sense given by the ampullae of Lorenzini which enables them to detect the {{electromagnetic}} field emitted by the movement of living animals. Great whites are so sensitive they can detect variations of half a billionth of a volt. <b>At</b> <b>close</b> <b>range,</b> this allows the shark to locate even immobile animals by detecting their heartbeat. Most fish have a less-developed but similar sense using their body's lateral line.|$|E
5|$|However, Paramount {{rejected}} the track, believing that Leonard {{was incapable of}} creating the score for the film. Leonard later presented the instrumental to Madonna, who decided {{to use it for}} <b>At</b> <b>Close</b> <b>Range,</b> the new film starring her then-husband, actor Sean Penn. Madonna wrote all the lyrics, added some melodies to the composition, and recorded a demo on a cassette. She presented the track to the film's director James Foley, who liked it and enlisted Leonard to compose the film's score, as suggested by Madonna.|$|E

50|$|The U.S. {{provided}} France with 269,644 M1 and M2 carbines from World War II to 1963. The M1 carbine {{was used}} by the French Paratroopers and Legionnaires during the Indo-China War and Algerian War. The M1 carbine was also popular in French Expeditionary Force in Vietnam because of it was ideal for use <b>at</b> <b>close</b> <b>ranges,</b> being better suited to jungle fighting than French standard infantry rifles. French troops discovered its ammunition was deadlier in <b>close</b> <b>range</b> combat.|$|R
25|$|In the East Roman Empire, the Romans used {{auxiliary}} forces {{known as}} dromedarii, whom they recruited in desert provinces.

5|$|In {{a school}} of Pacific blue-eyes that is threatened, a few {{individuals}} accelerate and change direction, which initiates an escape wave that spreads through the whole cohort. Animals are known to dart in random directions and speeds as an escape response when threatened. Pacific blue-eyes on their own dart in this manner for up to ten seconds after being faced with a threat <b>at</b> <b>close</b> <b>range.</b> This period is briefer when faced with more distant threats or for fish in schools.|$|E
5|$|In early 1799 Prudente was {{operating}} off South Africa, attacking British trade passing {{to or from}} the Cape Colony when the ship was discovered by British frigate HMS Daedalus under Captain Henry Lidgbird Ball. Prudente turned away and Ball gave chase, following the French ship closely. After five hours Daedalus caught Prudente and fired a raking broadside into the stern, disabling the French ship. For another hour the action continued <b>at</b> <b>close</b> <b>range</b> until Prudente was forced to surrender.|$|E

5|$|Jetpac Refuelled {{features}} a multiplayer mode {{that can be}} played either offline using a split screen or online via Xbox Live. In this mode, the player has to compete one-on-one in a race to build and refuel their craft before their opponent does. Fuel and rocket pickups can be stolen from opponents by shooting them or by using an EMP blast <b>at</b> <b>close</b> <b>range.</b> Lives are unlimited in multiplayer {{and the winner is}} determined by the highest score.

5|$|The AV-8A's {{abilities}} in air-to-air combat were {{tested by the}} Marine Corps by conducting mock dogfights with McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom IIs; these exercises trained pilots to use the vectoring-in-forward-flight (VIFF) capability to outmanoeuvre their opponents and showed that the Harriers could act as effective air-to-air fighters <b>at</b> <b>close</b> <b>range.</b> The success of Harrier operations countered scepticism of V/STOL aircraft, which had been judged to be expensive failures in the past. Marine Corps officers became convinced of the military advantages of the Harrier and pursued extensive development of the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The Austrians {{believed}} their ships {{to have less}} effective guns than their enemy, so decided to engage the Italians <b>at</b> <b>close</b> <b>range</b> and ram them. The Austrian fleet formed into an arrowhead formation with the ironclads in the first line, charging at the Italian ironclad squadron.

40|$|Reliable {{detection}} and tracking of high-speed projectiles {{is crucial in}} providing modern battlefield protection or {{to be used as}} a forensic tool. Subsonic projectiles fired from silenced weapons are difficult to detect, whereas reliable tracking of the projectile trajectory is hard to accomplish.

5000|$|The {{effect of}} {{enlarging}} the pattern {{was to make}} the pattern more visible at a distance, avoiding [...] "blobbing", where smaller areas of color seem to blend into larger blobs. This also gave the pattern a higher contrast, making it stand out more sharply <b>at</b> <b>close</b> distances and defeating the camouflage effect <b>at</b> <b>closer</b> <b>range.</b> Digital and Flecktarn camouflage patterns resolve this problem by using a range of blob sizes to give a similar effect whatever the distance.|$|R
