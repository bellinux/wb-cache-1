5|$|The station depot was {{replaced}} by a wooden one-story depot, referred to by locals as <b>a</b> <b>shack,</b> {{along the side of the}} tracks in downtown Turner. The new station itself lasted around the same amount of time that its predecessor station depot had; however, the widow of Edward Henry Harriman (d. September 9, 1909), a local railroad executive whose Arden estate was in the nearby hills, donated land in February 1910 in a different portion of Turner to build a brand new station to the east. The old one-story depot had a roof and structural supports that were aging and on the verge of collapsing to the ground.|$|E

5|$|In 2012, Todd jumps bail and {{arrives in}} Port Charles upon {{learning}} that Starr {{has been involved}} in a car accident that resulted in the deaths of Cole and Hope. Todd thinks local mobster Sonny Corinthos (Maurice Benard) is responsible for the deaths and seeks revenge. The charges against him for Victor's murder are dropped, due to a claim of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following his years in captivity, but Starr faces attempted murder charges for trying to kill Sonny. A pregnant Téa, who has been sought out by Blair to represent Starr, gets the charges dropped. In June, Todd is with Téa during an intense rainstorm when she goes into labor and gives birth to an unresponsive baby boy. Sam Morgan (Kelly Monaco) is also giving birth to a baby boy in a motel room. After Todd, searching for help, comes upon Heather Webber (Robin Mattson) in <b>a</b> <b>shack,</b> and she tells Todd that Téa's baby has died, he comes across Sam's son. An elated Téa sees the child and believes he is hers. Todd allows Téa to believe the child is hers, after Heather talks him out of telling Téa the truth. Todd forms a close relationship with Carly Corinthos (Laura Wright), Sonny's former wife, in the wake of yet another rejection from Blair, who is set to marry Tomás. Todd's role in the baby switch is eventually revealed. To make amends for almost killing her son, Steven, Heather lies to the judge and prosecutors about Todd's role in switching the babies. He is then released.|$|E

25|$|Jones {{was born}} on May 13, 1931 {{in a rural area}} of Crete, Indiana, to James Thurman Jones (1887–1951), a World War I veteran, and Lynetta Putnam (1902–1977). Lynetta {{reportedly}} believed she had given birth to a messiah. Jones was of Irish and Welsh descent.; he later claimed partial Cherokee ancestry through his mother, but his maternal second cousin later stated this was likely untrue. Economic difficulties during the Great Depression necessitated that Jones' family move to the town of Lynn in 1934, where he grew up in <b>a</b> <b>shack</b> without plumbing.|$|E

25|$|The {{next day}} she began work on the canteen. Calls to merchants came with {{requests}} for cigarettes and tobacco, while housewives were asked to contribute cake and cookies, with attempts to get the younger women to hand out the gifts and keep conversation up with the soldiers. The first meeting was held on December 22 for the canteen committee. Three days later, on Christmas day, the next train pulled into the city, surprising {{the young men who}} were expecting just another boring stop. At first, the women worked out of the nearby Cody Hotel. They were later allowed to move into <b>a</b> <b>shack</b> {{by the side of the}} tracks by the railroad company when a woman became friendly with the president of the Union Pacific. Eventually the movement grew and people from multiple organizations in surrounding communities began to contribute.|$|E

25|$|John Gómez (also {{known as}} Juan Gómez and Panther John) was a semi-legendary but real person {{who lived in}} <b>a</b> <b>shack</b> with his wife on {{otherwise}} uninhabited Panther Key near Marco Island in the Ten Thousand Islands region of Southwest Florida in the late 1800s. He was well known along Florida's Gulf coast as an expert hunting and fishing guide, boat pilot, and a teller of tall tales, mostly about himself. His self-reported age and birthplace varied, even on official documents. In the 1870 United States Census, he is listed as having been born in 1828. However, during the 1880 US census, Gómez {{claimed to have been}} born in France in 1785; in 1885, he told state census takers that he had been born in Corsica; and when asked for the 1900 US Census, he claimed to have been born in Portugal in 1776. Meanwhile, various contemporary letters and news articles report that Gómez claimed at different times to have been born in 1778, 1781 or 1795 in either Honduras, Portugal, or Mauritius. Most of his supposed birth years would have likely made him the oldest person in the world before his death.|$|E
25|$|In 1896, Charlie Russell {{and his new}} wife, Nancy, {{were living}} in <b>a</b> <b>shack</b> in back of a house in Cascade, Montana. In 1897, the couple moved into a rented four-room home on Seventh Avenue North in Great Falls. In December 1899, Russell's father Charles Silas Russell gave the couple $500. The estate of Mary Mead Russell, Russell's mother who died in 1895, was finally probated shortly thereafter, and {{in the spring of}} 1900 the Russells began {{building}} a new home on the corner of 13th Street and 4th Avenue North. A friend and neighbor, George Calvert, was the likely architect and constructed the house for them. The two-story wood frame building had clapboard siding, gable roof, and wooden shake roofing shingles. It had little exterior ornamentation. The house faced south, with gable fronted dormers on the east and west and another project slightly from the southwest corner of the house. The front door led to a small front hall, and a parlor ran across the south face of the home. Also on the first floor were dining room, bathroom, kitchen, and a small maid's room off the kitchen. Some of the furniture on first floor (such as two seats, a china closet, a bookcase) were built into the home. A steep stairway led to three small bedrooms (under the gables) and a small bathroom on the second floor. The interior was paneled in dark wood. A small exterior porch ran around the southeast corner of the home. The architectural style was in the Arts and Crafts genre. The Russells occupied the home in the summer of 1900.|$|E
