5|$|The storm petrel's large nasal {{olfactory}} bulbs facilitate <b>a</b> <b>keen</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> smell, and {{the birds}} themselves have a distinctive musty aroma which can help researchers to locate breeding colonies. Individual petrels recognise their own body scent and {{can use it to}} locate their nest in the dark.|$|E
5|$|The {{large size}} of the {{olfactory}} bulbs, {{as well as the}} terminal and olfactory nerves, suggest that Tarbosaurus had <b>a</b> <b>keen</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> smell, as was also the case with Tyrannosaurus. The vomeronasal bulb is large and differentiated from the olfactory bulb, which was initially suggested as being indicative of a well-developed Jacobsen's organ, which was used to detect pheromones. This may imply that Tarbosaurus had complex mating behavior. However, the identification of the vomeronasal bulb has been challenged by other researchers, since they are not present in any living archosaurs.|$|E
5|$|The {{black vulture}} is a {{scavenger}} and feeds on carrion, {{but will also}} eat eggs or kill newborn animals. In areas populated by humans, it also feeds at garbage dumps. It finds its meals either by using its keen eyesight or by following other (New World) vultures, which possess <b>a</b> <b>keen</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> smell. Lacking a syrinx—the vocal organ of birds—its only vocalizations are grunts or low hisses. It lays its eggs in caves or hollow trees or on the bare ground, and generally raises two chicks each year, which it feeds by regurgitation. In the United States, the vulture receives legal protection under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918. This vulture also appeared in Mayan codices.|$|E

5|$|In 1989, Emily B. Griffin {{found that}} Stegoceras and other pachycephalosaurs {{had a good}} sense of smell (olfaction), based on the study of cranial endocasts that showed large {{olfactory}} bulbs in the brain. In 2014, Jason M. Bourke and colleagues found that Stegoceras would have needed cartilaginous nasal turbinates {{in the front of the}} nasal passages for airflow to reach the olfactory region. Evidence for the presence of this structure is a bony ridge to which it could have attached. The size of the olfactory region also indicates that Stegoceras had <b>a</b> <b>keen</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> smell. The researchers found that the dinosaur could have had either a scroll-shaped turbinate (like in a turkey) or a branched one (as in an ostrich) as both could have directed air to the olfactory region. The blood vessel system in the passages also suggest that the turbinates served to cool down warm arterial blood from the body that was heading to the brain. The skull of S. validum specimen UALVP 2 was suited for a study of this kind due to its exceptional preservation; it has ossified soft tissue in the nasal cavity, which would otherwise be cartilaginous and therefore not preserved through mineralization.|$|E

He was known for {{supportive}} letters sent to friends during World War II, and the gift parcels sent by him and his wife. Oscar Tiegs' geographical isolation, and his own diffidence probably prevented him from maximising his contribution to zoology, although rather than diffidence others describe it as an unassuming disposition. He is described as shy and reserved, preferring the laboratory to the committee meeting or social function.|$|E

25|$|Steering a ship {{effectively}} requires skills {{gained through}} training and experience. An expert helmsman has <b>a</b> <b>keen</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> how a particular ship {{will respond to}} the helm or how different sea conditions impact steering. For instance, experience teaches a helmsman the ability to correct the rudder in advance of a ship substantially falling off course. This requires the capacity to anticipate the delay between when the helm is applied and when the ship responds to the rudder. Similarly, a skilled helmsman will avoid overcompensating for a ship's movement caused by local conditions, such as wind, swells, currents, or rough seas.|$|E

25|$|Certainly a man {{of fierce}} pride, his pride was {{tempered}} {{by a sense of}} humour that included <b>a</b> <b>keen</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> the absurd in his own situation. While mastermind of a clandestine military, he remained a public figure. When official head of the Free State government, he continued to cooperate in the IRA's secret operations. He was capable of bold, decisive actions on his own authority, which caused friction with his colleagues, his falling out with Cathal Brugha, for example; but at critical junctures he could also bow to majority decisions which were profoundly disadvantageous and dangerous to his own interests (such as his appointment to the Treaty negotiating team).|$|E

5000|$|In 1972, Mayne {{abruptly}} left Cal Poly Pomona and {{collaborated with}} five {{other students and}} educators whom he met at while at USC, to create the Southern California Institute of Architecture, or SCI-Arc. The rift was due to differences between the dean at Cal Poly {{at the time and}} Ray Kappe, who headed the school's architecture department. The goal of the new institute was to reinvigorate formal architectural education with <b>a</b> <b>keener</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> social conscience.

25|$|His strength, speed, stamina, agility, reflexes, senses, flexibility, durability, endurance, and {{swimming}} are extraordinary {{in comparison to}} normal men. He has wrestled full grown bull apes and gorillas, lions, rhinos, crocodiles, pythons, sharks, tigers, man-size seahorses (once) and even dinosaurs (when he visited Pellucidar). Tarzan is a skilled tracker and uses his exceptional senses of hearing and smell to follow prey or avoid predators, and kills only for food, yet is a skilled thief when raiding African tribal villages or hunting parties that Tarzan has judged to be brutal and deserve no pity, taking their spears, shields, bows, knives, and most importantly, metal arrowheads. <b>A</b> <b>keen</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> hearing allows him to eavesdrop on conversations between other people near him.|$|E
25|$|From {{the very}} {{beginning}} of their career together, all the band members had <b>a</b> <b>keen</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> visual style. They worked with stylist Perry Haines and fashion designers such as Kahn & Bell and Antony Price to build a sharp and elegant image, soon outgrowing the ruffles and sashes of the pirate-flavoured early New Romantic look that had been popularised by Adam and the Ants during 1980–81. They have continued to present fashion as part of their package throughout their career. In the 1990s they worked with Vivienne Westwood, and in the 2000s with Giorgio Armani. The band retained creative control of their visual presentation and worked closely with graphic designer Malcolm Garrett and many others over the years to create album covers, tour programs and other materials.|$|E
25|$|In an {{interview}} for Segno Cinema magazine, Barboni explained that during the two weeks of shooting at the Elios Film set, filming was made problematic by the low amount of available sunlight. Grey and heavy clouds covered the sky nearly permanently, making it extremely difficult for the crew to choose the right light. Many scenes {{turned out to be}} underexposed, but the type of film negative that was used permitted this, and the crew was enthusiastic about the visual effects created. Deodato believes {{that as a result of}} the limitations imposed by the cold weather and the low budget, as well as the craftsmanship of production members such as costumer Marcella De Marchis (the wife of Roberto Rossellini), the film has a neorealistic aesthetic comparable to the works of Rossellini and Gualtiero Jacopetti. Nero has noted that Corbucci displayed <b>a</b> <b>keen</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> black humour throughout production, which once resulted in the director and his crew abandoning Nero during the shooting of the film's opening titles as a joke.|$|E

He will, not, perhaps, achieve so wide a popularity as his brothers-in-verse, for he practically lacks that element of local color which is so profusely evident in most of their poems. He is a dreamer, given to looking backward and moralising; viewing the world more as a past than as a passing show, and therefore finding it particularly rich in regrets." ...|$|R
5000|$|The syssitia patently {{served to}} bring kinship groups {{together}}, and in having {{those who would}} fight together eat together in peacetime, a strong bond was formed. The syssitia in effect became an extended family, where all were [...] "children of the state". It also ensured a separation between subject classes and citizens, and in Sparta additional separation based on station and wealth. They were thus a strong tool for developing nationalism. Herodotus (I, 65) remarks that the Spartan syssitia led to troops [...] "who fought with more bravery and <b>a</b> <b>keener</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> shame than {{would have been the}} case with chance comrades" [...] (Smith 1870) ...|$|R
5000|$|Tintagel was premiered in Bournemouth on 20 October 1921 by the Bournemouth Municipal Orchestra {{conducted}} by Dan Godfrey. The Musical Times reported: On October 20 interest was chiefly centred in…the actual first {{performance of a}} new composition by Arnold Bax, entitled Tintagel. This was very successfully produced, Mr. Bax being the recipient of a genuine outburst of applause. Lovely passages abound in his score, and the poetic quality of the music is everywhere exemplified. One felt, however, that a better structural balance could have been obtained, and that <b>a</b> <b>keener</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> climax would have improved this deeply-felt piece of writing. Mr. Godfrey's handling of the intricate score was above reproach.|$|R
