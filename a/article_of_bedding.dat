Primary and secondary accounts of rabbit skin robes and blankets suggest that these items are very warm. But compared to modern materials, how warm could rabbit skin robes actually have been? To determine a standardized intrinsic warmth value of rabbit skin robes we perform two tests. In the first we compare the relative temperature loss between a rabbit skin robe reproduction and four modern <b>articles</b> <b>of</b> clothing and <b>bedding.</b> In the second we establish the thermal conductivity (k-value) for the rabbit skin robe reproduction, which allows us to make a standardized comparison between the rabbit skin and other materials.

In populous districts, we kept on our drawers, or supplied their place with a piece of rag, or a skin; and then, when the rain was over, we wrapped ourselves up in our 'quarry,' and taking off the wetted articles, hung them over the animal's cruppers to dry."

40|$|Taking care <b>of</b> <b>beds</b> is part <b>of</b> nurses {{everyday}} work. The way a bed looks {{influences the}} patients {{physical and mental}} state. Care <b>of</b> the <b>bed</b> involves its arrangement, exchanging used bed-linen and especially disinfection, which prevents the transfer of nosocomial infections. The objectives of the thesis was to survey the way nurses take care <b>of</b> <b>beds,</b> identify obstacles associated with the care <b>of</b> <b>beds,</b> and propose a basis for creating a standard care <b>of</b> <b>beds.</b> 3 research questions were set. Research question 1 : How does the length of patients stay on the bed depend on the frequency of its disinfection in practice? Research question 2 : Do nurses consider the care <b>of</b> <b>beds</b> {{from the point of}} view of the work schedule or the patients comfort? Research question 3 : What are the most frequent obstacles in the care <b>of</b> <b>beds?</b> The research was conducted by means of a structured observation, followed by a follow-up recording in the record sheet. An anonymous questioning was conducted to obtain results. 8 nurses present in the department took part in the observation and questioning in the course of research investigation. The research set consisted of nurses in the subsequent care of the CTM Hospital a. s. in Humpolec. The investigation results let us set hypotheses. Hypothesis 1 : The overall disinfection <b>of</b> the <b>bed</b> is done after the patient is discharged from the hospital. Hypothesis 2 : Nurses take care <b>of</b> <b>beds</b> according to work schedule. Hypothesis 3 : An obstacle in the arrangement <b>of</b> the <b>bed</b> is the lack of clean bed-linen. The investigation results may be provided to the management of the department in which the investigation was conducted.

40|$|In Australia, the ‘remote {{education}} system’ {{presents itself}} as a simple system where the right inputs, such as quality teachers and leaders will engender the outputs that have been set by the system, such as certain levels of English literacy and numeracy. The system has measures in place, including national testing, to report on its success. For the most part, this system {{seems to be working}} quite well. However, this modelling breaks down when the education system of remote Australia is presented. This remote system is presented in much of the literature and in the press, as disadvantaged, under-resourced and underperforming. Reported results indicate that current activities are not bringing the desired outcomes. The so-called mainstream system makes adjustments using its model of input to output, but without success. There is a clear need for change. Just what this change might look like is the focus <b>of</b> this <b>article.</b> Theorising in this space is considered from two positions; the first being the published work of a number of Indigenous Australian educators and leaders writing in this space; the second, a consideration of western theorising using complex adaptive systems.

40|$|Objective: To {{define the}} number of {{occasions}} of sitting out <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> in patients {{in the intensive care}} unit (ICU) following tracheostomy formation. Design: Descriptive observational study. Setting: ICU, Guy’s and St. Thomas’ National Health Service Foundation Trust, London, UK. Participants: Convenience sample of 30 mechanically ventilated patients requiring a tracheostomy. Main outcome measures: The number of occasions of sitting out <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> and/or sitting on the edge <b>of</b> the <b>bed</b> during the patient’s stay on the ICU, {{the number of}} occasions that patients did not sit out <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> or sit on the edge <b>of</b> the <b>bed</b> as defined due to being ‘medically unwell’ or ‘other’, and ICU outcome. Results: This preliminary work demonstrated that 63 % (19 / 30) of patients sat out <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> during their ICU stay. The median number of occasions of sitting out <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> was two. Thirty-seven percent (11 / 30) of patients did not sit out <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> and demonstrated a higher mortality rate than the patients who did sit out <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> during their ICU stay. There was no significant difference in age, gender, Apache II scores or length of ICU stay between patients that did and did not sit out <b>of</b> <b>bed.</b> Conclusions: This study found that a culture of patient mobilisation exists on the ICU at St. Thomas’ Hospital, but its frequency of delivery is reduced by the construct that patients are considered too unwell for it to be indicated at times. The effects, risks and benefits of early mobility within the ICU environment require further exploration in order to add to the literature and develop clinical practice...|$|R

This research studied the effect <b>of</b> concentration <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> materials on combustion efficiency during waste incineration. The size <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> materials, combustion temperature, and excess air factor were controlled to assess the concentration of carbon monoxide. The pressure drop was measured to evaluate the bed expansion and calculate the concentration <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> materials. Experimental {{results indicated that the}} concentration of carbon monoxide did not decrease with the decrease of residence time and increase of excess air factor. With higher heat transfer efficiency, the combustion time could be reduced and the combustion efficiency would be improved. The concentration of carbon monoxide at 700 degreesC was higher than that at 800 and 900 degreesC. The influence of heat transfer efficiency on combustion efficiency was significant as the operating temperature was higher than 700 degreesC. The concentration of carbon monoxide decreased with increasing static bed height. In addition, the size <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> materials affected the mixing and heat transfer efficiency in the sand bed.
