5|$|From {{the data}} he {{collected}} <b>and</b> <b>documented,</b> Aristotle inferred {{quite a number}} of rules relating the life-history features of the live-bearing tetrapods (terrestrial placental mammals) that he studied. Among these correct predictions are the following. Brood size decreases with (adult) body mass, so that an elephant has fewer young (usually just one) per brood than a mouse. Lifespan increases with gestation period, and also with body mass, so that elephants live longer than mice, have a longer period of gestation, and are heavier. As a final example, fecundity decreases with lifespan, so long-lived kinds like elephants have fewer young in total than short-lived kinds like mice.|$|E
5|$|Geologists have dated <b>and</b> <b>documented</b> {{dozens of}} major eruptions over the volcano's long history, {{bridging}} the long gap between Kīlauea's oldest known rock and only extremely recent written records and historical observation.

The oldest flows, dating back 275,000 to 225,000 years, have been recovered from Kīlauea's submerged southern slope by ship-towed remotely operated vehicles. These lavas exhibit forms characteristic of early, submerged preshield-stage eruptive episodes, from when the volcano was still a rising seamount that had not yet breached the ocean surface, and their surface exposure is unusual, as in most other volcanoes such lavas would have since been buried by more recent flows.|$|E

In parts of Apulia (Grecìa Salentina, for example) the Griko dialect is commonly used in song.

5|$|Fish {{and other}} aquatic prey {{taken in the}} water or at the water's edge form the major part of American alligator's diet and may be eaten {{at any time of}} the day or night. Adult American {{alligators}} also spend considerable time hunting on land, up to 50m (170ft) from water, ambushing terrestrial animals on trailsides and road shoulders. Usually, terrestrial hunting occurs on nights with warm temperatures. When hunting terrestrial prey, American alligators may also ambush them {{from the edge of the}} water by grabbing them and pulling the prey into the water, the preferred method of predation of larger crocodiles. The teeth of the American alligator are designed to grip prey, but can not rip or chew flesh like teeth of some other predators (such as canids and felids), and depend on their gizzard instead to masticate their food. The American alligator is capable of biting though a turtle's shell or a moderately sized mammal bone. Additionally, American alligators have recently been filmed <b>and</b> <b>documented</b> killing and eating sharks and rays; four incidents documented indicated that bonnetheads, lemon sharks, Atlantic stingrays and nurse sharks are components of the animal's diet. Sharks are also known to prey on American alligators in turn, indicating encounters between the two predators are more common than thought.|$|E

40|$|The claimed {{advantage}} of describing a document data set with a bipartite graph is that partitioning such a graph yields a co-clustering of words <b>and</b> <b>documents.</b> The topic of each cluster {{can then be}} represented by the top words <b>and</b> <b>documents</b> that have highest withincluster degrees. However, such claims may fail if top words <b>and</b> <b>documents</b> are selected {{simply because they are}} very general and frequent. In addition, for those words <b>and</b> <b>documents</b> across several topics, it may not be proper to assign them to a single cluster. To that end, this paper introduces a new bipartite formulation that incorporates both word hypercliques <b>and</b> <b>document</b> hypercliques as super vertices. By copreserving hyperclique patterns during the clustering process, our experiments on real-world data sets show that better clustering results can be obtained and the cluster topic can be more precisely identified. Also, we illustrate an application of the partitioned bipartite to search engines, returning clustered search results for keyword queries. We show that the topic of each cluster with respect to the current query can be identified more accurately with the words <b>and</b> <b>documents</b> from the patterns than with those top ones from the standard bipartite formulation...|$|R
