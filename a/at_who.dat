25|$|The {{combination}} of {{direct and indirect}} deaths from malnutrition caused by unsafe water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) practices is estimated by the World Health Organisation to lead to 860,000 deaths per year in children under five years of age. The multiple interdependencies between malnutrition and infectious diseases {{make it very difficult}} to quantify the portion of malnutrition that is caused by infectious diseases which are in turn caused by unsafe WASH practices. Based on expert opinions and a literature survey, researchers <b>at</b> <b>WHO</b> arrived at the conclusion that approximately half of all cases of malnutrition (which often leads to stunting) in children under five is associated with repeated diarrhoea or intestinal worm infections as a result of unsafe water, inadequate sanitation or insufficient hygiene.|$|E
25|$|Auckland's network {{consists}} of four lines: Southern, Eastern, Western and Onehunga. All services on these lines are provided by electric trains, the conversion from diesel being completed {{by the end of}} 2015 {{with the exception of the}} non-electrified section of track between Papakura and Pukekohe, where a diesel train shuttle service operates. For nine years Tranz Metro also operated the suburban passenger services in Auckland, however in mid-2004 Connex (later Veolia, now Transdev) won the contract to run them. In recent years the mothballed Onehunga Branch was reopened (2010) and a new line was built (Manukau Branch, opened April 2012). Recent major projects include electrification of the Auckland suburban network and the building of the City Rail Link. Most Auckland rolling stock is owned by Auckland Transport (<b>AT)</b> <b>who</b> fund all services.|$|E

500|$|Australian and American {{media were}} {{generally}} welcoming to the album; John Mangan from Australia's The Age newspaper commended the diverse set of styles and Minogue's songwriting skills, saying [...] "Impossible Princess sounds right and constitutes another {{step in the}} right direction."

[...] In conclusion, they acknowledged that [...] "Impossible Princess is the best, most complete work of her career." [...] Cameron Adams, writing for Herald Sun, listed the record as his [...] "CD of the Week"; He favored the singles as the album's best tracks, but also said, [...] "Impossible Princess is her best yet, the classey, personal pop album she has always threatened." [...] Michael Dwyer, writing for the Western Mail highlighted the [...] "club-dance" [...] tracks as the better cuts, while examining that [...] "Impossible Princess range of styles approaches and collaborators makes it as hard as ever to say just who is making progress here, but progress it most assuredly is." [...] Larry Flick from American magazine Billboard described the album as [...] "stunning", concluding that [...] "it's a golden commercial opportunity for a major record company with vision and energy to release it in the United States...".|$|E
500|$|Michaels {{returned}} to the ring as a fan favorite in May 1995 {{and he went on}} to defeat Jeff Jarrett to win his third Intercontinental Championship in July at [...] This led to a title defense against Razor Ramon at SummerSlam in a ladder match, which Michaels won. Around this time, Michaels became the leader of a backstage group known as The Kliq. Critics perceive the group to have sufficient clout with WWF owner Vince McMahon, becoming dominant wrestling figures in the WWF for several years in the mid-1990s, causing friction with other wrestlers. Michaels disputes the perception, saying that McMahon pushed only deserving wrestlers. Michaels' fan base was later nicknamed [...] "The Kliq" [...] as an inside reference to the real [...] "Kliq". In October 1995, Michaels was the victim of a legit assault outside a bar in Syracuse, New York. Due to not being able to compete, Michaels was forced to forfeit the Intercontinental Championship to his original opponent Dean Douglas <b>at</b> , <b>who</b> in turn Douglas lost the championship Razor Ramon, another member of the Kliq. This event has been cited {{as an example of the}} Kliq holding others down. During a match with Owen Hart on a November episode of Raw, Hart performed an enzuigiri that struck the back of Michaels' head. They continued the match, but Michaels collapsed in the ring, supposedly because he had suffered a concussion. The concussion was scripted, which was kept from most fans at the time. A retirement angle was written so that Michaels could take some time off after he came back from an injury too soon.|$|E

2500|$|Dennis {{was told}} the {{identity}} of the culprit minutes before he filmed the scene in which Paul was pushed. He was initially the only cast member who knew for [...] "quite a while." [...] The actor was sworn to secrecy and was not allowed to tell any of his co-stars. Dennis admitted that he was forced to lie {{that he did not know}} the identity of Paul's attacker when he was asked. He also said that he was not surprised when the culprit was revealed to him. When asked if he was surprised <b>at</b> <b>who</b> the culprit was, Dennis stated that he was not because it was explained to him why it was that person. The other cast members did not find out who the culprit was until a couple of weeks after the 6000th episode. Jane Hall later revealed that she had known her character, Rebecca, would be the culprit from the start. She was told by the writers it what was what they had planned. Hall admitted to thinking that the storyline would be [...] "really tricky" [...] as it goes against her character's nature.|$|E

Heather Phares wrote for AllMusic the song [...] "flirts with satire" [...] in its usage {{in the film}} because [...] " [...] threatened by these upstarts from other cliques invading their territory", in reference of Troy and Gabriella's performance. Phares considered its medoly [...] "so bright" [...] and Tisdale and Grabeel's vocals [...] "so relentlessly cheery, {{it sounds like a}} parody of a show tune". A writer for Talkin' Broadway echoed this view, describing the song as [...] "a clever parody of Broadway styles". Chris Willman, for Entertainment Weekly, compared the song with [...] "You Are The Music In Me", a song included in the sequel High School Musical 2. He wrote [...] "both an earnest Troy/Gabriella duet and an insincere (but more fun) showstopper for self-absorbed Sharpay". A reviewer for Common Sense Media highlighted the track. Commenting on the reprise, DVD Verdict said it [...] "is a little soft". The Christian Broadcasting Network offered a spiritual analysis of the song: [...] " [...] a great opportunity to look <b>at</b> <b>who</b> God is and His character, including the fact that He's always with us." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the last}} quarter of the 20th century, {{researchers}} addressed the twin problems of water and impurities adhering to skis during spring conditions. Terry Hertel addressed both problems, first with the novel use of a surfactant that interacted with the wax matrix in such a way as to repel water effectively, a product introduced in 1974 by Hertel Wax. Hertel also developed the first fluorocarbon product and the first spring-time wax that repels and makes the running surface slick for spring time alpine ski and snowboard. This technology was introduced to the market in 1986 by Hertel Wax. [...] In 1990, Hertel filed for a U.S. patent on a [...] "ski wax for use with sintered-base snow skis", containing paraffin, a hardener wax, roughly 1% per-fluoroether diol, and 2% SDS surfactant. In the 1990s, Swix chief chemist Leif Torgersen found a glide wax additive to repel pollen and other snow impurities—a problem with soft grip waxes during distance races—in the form of a fluorocarbon that could be ironed into the ski base. The solution was based on the work of Enrico Traverso <b>at</b> , <b>who</b> had developed a fluorocarbon powder with a melting temperature just a few degrees below that of sintered polyethylene, patented in Italy as a [...] "ski lubricant comprising paraffinic wax and hydrocarbon compounds containing a perfluorocarbon segment".|$|E
