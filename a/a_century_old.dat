5|$|Possibly {{the best}} ecologically studied {{seamount}} {{in the world}} is Davidson Seamount, with six major expeditions recording over 60,000 species observations. The contrast between the seamount and the surrounding area was well-marked. One of the primary ecological havens on the seamount is its deep sea coral garden, and many of the specimens noted were over <b>a</b> <b>century</b> <b>old.</b> Following the expansion of knowledge on the seamount there was extensive support to make it a marine sanctuary, a motion that was granted in 2008 as part of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary. Much of what is known about seamounts ecologically is based on observations from Davidson. Another such seamount is Bowie Seamount, which has also been declared a marine protected area by Canada for its ecological richness.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of Columbia's graduate and undergraduate studies are conducted in Morningside Heights on Seth Low's late-19th century {{vision of a}} university campus where all disciplines could be taught at one location. The campus was designed along Beaux-Arts principles by architects McKim, Mead, and White. Columbia's main campus occupies more than six city blocks, or , in Morningside Heights, New York City, a neighborhood that contains a number of academic institutions. The university owns over 7,800 apartments in Morningside Heights, housing faculty, graduate students, and staff. Almost two dozen undergraduate dormitories (purpose-built or converted) are located on campus or in Morningside Heights. Columbia University has an extensive underground tunnel system more than <b>a</b> <b>century</b> <b>old,</b> with the oldest portions predating the present campus. Some of these remain accessible to the public, while others have been cordoned off.|$|E

5|$|The {{circumstances}} in which the Crosby Garret helmet was buried are still unclear, but the discoveries made by the post-discovery Tullie House/PAS excavations have provided much more detail about its context. It was clearly deposited within an artificial feature that had been specially constructed; Stuart Noon of the Museum of Lancashire suggests that the feature may have been intended as a memorial of some sort. It was not buried in an isolated spot but within a long-occupied Romano-British farming settlement that had clearly adopted aspects of Roman culture. Given the settlement's proximity to Roman military locations, it is very possible that some of its inhabitants served with the Roman army, which often recruited mounted auxiliaries from among native peoples. The helmet may well already have been a valuable antique {{at the time of}} its burial; if the coins found nearby reflect when it was buried, it could have been over <b>a</b> <b>century</b> <b>old</b> by the time it was deposited. It was deliberately broken before being buried in what may have been intended as a ritual sacrifice. The identity of its owner will never be known, but it could have been that a local inhabitant who had formerly served with the Roman cavalry was responsible for the helmet's deposition.|$|E

25|$|At first, the cartographic {{community}} {{largely ignored}} Peters's foray into cartography. The preceding century had already witnessed many campaigns for new projections with little visible result. Just twenty years earlier, for example, Trystan Edwards described and promoted his own eponymous projection, disparaging the Mercator, and recommending his projection as the solution. Peters's projection differed from Edwards's only in height-to-width ratio. More problematic, Peters's projection was identical {{to one that}} was already over <b>a</b> <b>century</b> <b>old,</b> though he probably did not realize it. That projection—Gall's orthographic—passed unnoticed {{when it was announced}} in 1855.|$|E
25|$|In 1882 George Wright took up cricket seriously {{again with}} the Longwood Cricket Club of Boston where he {{dominated}} local cricket sides with Isaac Chambers, the Longwood cricket pro and greenskeeper, holding up the other bowling end. In 1891 George Wright captained the Longwood Cricket Club against Lord Hawke's visiting English side. Wright's side surprised the visiting English first-class players with accurate bowling which kept the tourist in check. In 1892 George Wright donated cricket gear to British Guianese (Guyana) cricket players thereby starting <b>a</b> <b>century</b> <b>old</b> tradition of West Indian cricket in New England.|$|E
25|$|The Buenos Aires Underground, {{initially}} {{maintained by}} the national government, {{was the subject of}} a year-long dispute between Macri and Kirchner. The national government sought to transfer it to the city (which Macri supported), but the budget and length of the transition period were contested. Macri announced that the city would take over the underground on 13November 2012. Line A, still using wooden cars almost <b>a</b> <b>century</b> <b>old,</b> received a fleet of modern cars from the national government; Line H also received new cars. Madrid Metro rolling-stock purchases for Line B were criticised, despite their technical superiority, for being incompatible with the line and costing more than new trains for the city's commuter-rail network.|$|E

25|$|In 1825, Jacob J. Hasbrouck {{moved out}} to a brick {{farmhouse}} two miles (3.2km) along the Wallkill to retire; his son, Maurice, took over the main stone house and devoted himself primarily to the farm, {{as most of the}} family's land had been subdivided and sold. He undertook no major renovations other than whatever routine maintenance the house needed, and moved out in 1870 when his own son, Abram, married and needed the space as his grandfather had before him. The house, by this time, was almost <b>a</b> <b>century</b> <b>old</b> and badly needed to be restored. The original Hasbrouck land parcels had long been divided up, leaving only , and the family had moved on to other sources of income. By the mid-19th century, tax assessments suggest that the stone houses that had symbolized their earlier wealth were losing their appeal as younger homeowners embraced newer styles.|$|E
25|$|Derry {{is home to}} the Magee Campus of Ulster University, {{formerly}} Magee College. However, Lockwood's 1960s {{decision to}} locate Northern Ireland's second university in Coleraine rather than Derry helped contribute to the formation {{of the civil rights movement}} that ultimately led to The Troubles. Derry was the town more closely associated with higher learning, with Magee College already more than <b>a</b> <b>century</b> <b>old</b> by that time. In the mid-1980s a half-hearted attempt was made at rectifying this mistake by forming Magee College as a campus of the Ulster University but this has failed to stifle calls for the establishment of an independent University in Derry that can grow to it full potential. The campus has never thrived and currently only has 3,500 students out of a total Ulster University student population of 27,000. Ironically, although Coleraine is blamed by many in the city for 'stealing the University', it has only 5,000 students, the remaining 19,000 being based in Belfast.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the party}} infighting, Whitcomb {{was able to}} {{successfully}} advocate for {{the passage of a}} number of bills to expand the state highway system, to repeal laws passed during his predecessors’ terms that distributed funds to the county governments and to computerize both the state's criminal records and its Bureau of Motor Vehicles. Significant constitutional development took place during his term. Also on the ballot during his election campaign were a number of constitutional amendments, among them a reorganization of the state court system, changing the legislatures sessions to occur annually rather than biennially, a change that would allow governors to begin serving consecutive terms again, and the placing of a new cabinet position(s) in the constitution. Whitcomb however, could not run for a second term because he had been elected under the prior version of the constitution. Another significant event occurred during his first months in office when the Indiana Supreme Court ruled that the pocket veto was unconstitutional, which passed into law several bills that had been pocket vetoed by his predecessors. Whitcomb requested that General Assembly pass an act repealing all laws that were enacted because of the Supreme Court decision, some of which were nearly <b>a</b> <b>century</b> <b>old.</b> The assembly complied with the request and passed a blanket repeal.|$|E
