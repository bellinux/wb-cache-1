50|$|<b>Ammonium</b> <b>sulfamate</b> (like other {{ammonium}} salts, e.g. Ammonium dihydrogen phosphate, Ammonium sulfate) is {{a useful}} flame retardant. These salt based flame retardants offer advantages over other metal/mineral-based flame retardants {{in that they are}} water processable. Their relatively low decomposition temperature makes them suitable for flame retarding cellulose based materials (paper/wood). <b>Ammonium</b> <b>sulfamate</b> (like Ammonium dihydrogen phosphate) is sometimes used in conjunction with Magnesium sulfate or Ammonium sulfate (in ratios of approximately 2:1) for enhanced flame retardant properties.|$|E
50|$|Within {{industry}} <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulfamate</b> {{is used as}} a flame retardant, a plasticiser and in electro-plating. Within {{the laboratory}} it {{is used as a}} reagent.|$|E

50|$|<b>Ammonium</b> <b>sulfamate</b> (British {{spelling}} Ammonium sulphamate) {{is a white}} crystalline solid, readily soluble in water. It {{is commonly}} used as a broad spectrum herbicide, with additional uses as a compost accelerator, flame retardant and in industrial processes.|$|E
50|$|Several {{years ago}} the Henry Doubleday Research Association (HDRA) (known as Garden Organic), {{published}} an article on <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulfamate</b> after a successful set of herbicide trials. Though not approved for use by organic growers it does provide an option when alternatives have failed.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ammonium</b> <b>sulfamate</b> is {{considered}} to be slightly toxic to humans and animals, making it appropriate for amateur home garden, professional and forestry uses. It is generally accepted to be safe for use on plots of land that will be used for growing fruit and vegetables intended for consumption.|$|E
50|$|Ammonium sulfate {{has also}} been used in flame {{retardant}} compositions acting much like diammonium phosphate. As a flame retardant, it increases the combustion temperature of the material, decreases maximum weight loss rates, and causes {{an increase in the}} production of residue or char. Its flame retardant efficacy can be enhanced by blending it with <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulfamate.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{pesticides}} {{review by}} the European Union led to herbicides containing <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulfamate</b> becoming unlicensed, and therefore effectively banned, from 2008. This situation arose as the Irish Rapporteur refused to review the data supplied unless it contained details of animal testing on dogs. As there was already substantial animal data within the package supplied the data pack holder felt further tests without substantiation would cause unnecessary animal suffering. Its licence was not withdrawn on grounds of safety or efficacy.|$|E

40|$|Synergistic effect between α-zirconium {{phosphate}} (α-ZrP) and <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulfamate</b> (AS) for enhanced {{flame retardant}} properties of Polyamide 6 (PA 6) was investigated by using oxygen index instrument, cone calorimeter, thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA), Instron universal test machine and {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM). PA 6 /AS/α-ZrP ternary hybrid materials with various contents of α-ZrP and AS were fabricated by melt-mixing method. The result from flammability indicated that the Limiting oxygen index (LOI) and Underwriters Laboratories- 94 (UL- 94) rating of PA 6 /AS/α-ZrP were significantly accelerated under the coordinating function of α-ZrP and AS. Moreover, the thermal stability for PA 6 /AS/α-ZrP studied by TGA also demonstrated this synergistic effect between α-ZrP and AS on the heat resistance. The effects of the usage amount of α-ZrP and AS on mechanical properties were analyzed by using uniaxial tensile test. It {{was found that the}} addition of AS provided negative effects on the tensile strength of PA 6 /AS/α-ZrP, however, the adverse trends that mentioned above could be overcome by using the well dispersed α-ZrP...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to purify and {{characterize}} a keratinase produced by a new isolated Bacillus subtilis KD-N 2 strain. The keratinase produced by the isolate was purified using ammonium sulphate precipitation, Sephadex G- 75 and DEAE (diethylaminoethyl) -Sepharose chromatographic techniques. The purified enzyme was shown to have a molecular mass of 30. 5 kDa, as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis. The optimum pH at 50 °C was 8. 5 and the optimum temperature at pH 8. 5 was 55 °C. The keratinase was partially inactivated by some metal ions, organic solvents and serine protease inhibitor phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) had positive effect on the keratinase activity. Reducing agents including dithiothreitol (DTT), mercaptoethanol, L-cysteine, sodium sulphite, as well as chemicals of SDS, <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulfamate</b> and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) stimulated the enzyme activity upon a feather meal substrate. Besides feather keratin, the enzyme is active upon the soluble proteins ovalbumin, bovine serum albumin (BSA), casein and insoluble ones as sheep wool and human hair. Calf hair, silk and collagen could not be hydrolyzed by the keratinase...|$|E
40|$|Polyamide 6 (PA 6) is a widely-used polymer {{that could}} find {{applications}} in various sectors, including home textiles, transportation or construction. However, {{due to its}} organic nature, PA 6 is flammable, and flame-retardant formulations have to be developed to comply with fire safety standards. Recently, it was proposed to use <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulfamate</b> as an effective flame retardant for PA 6, even at low loading content. However, processing issues could occur with this additive considering large-scale production. This paper thus studies the use of another sulfamate salt—guanidine sulfamate (GAS) —and evidences its high efficiency when combined with melamine polyphosphate (MPP) as a flame retardant for PA 6. A decrease of {{the peak of the}} heat release rate by 30 % compared to pure PA 6 was obtained using only 5 wt% of a GAS/MPP mixture in a microscale calorimeter. Moreover, PA 6 containing the mixture GAS/MPP exhibits a Limiting Oxygen Index (LOI) of 37 vol% and is rated V 0 for the UL 94 test (Vertical Burning Test; ASTM D 3801). The mechanisms of degradation were investigated analyzing the gas phase and solid phase when the material degrades. It was proposed that MPP and GAS modify the degradation pathway of PA 6, leading to the formation of nitrile end-group-containing molecules. Moreover, the formation of a polyaromatic structure by the reaction of MPP and PA 6 was also shown...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT-These studies {{demonstrate}} the nitrosatirig potential of N 0 2 in vivo in ICR mice. Groups of mice were gavaged with 2 mg dimethylamine (DMA) and exposed to N 0 2 at levels from 0. 04 to 44. 5 ppm for periods up to 4 hours. Mice were individually frozen and blended to a powder. aliquots {{of which were}} homog-enized in ice-cold dicholoromethane and 35 % aqueous methanol. Concentrates of organic extracts were analyzed for dimethyl-nitrosamine (DMN) by a Thermal Energy Analyzer with a gas chromatograph interface. Biosynthesis of DMN was dose- and time-dependent with relation to N 02 exposure. reaching a maxi-mum yield of 60 - 70 ng/mouse (0. 0034 % DMA conversion) at 2 hours. DMN biosynthesis was inhibited by sodium ascorbate and. more effectively. by <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulfamate.</b> -JNCI 1981; 67 : 137 - 141. Nitrogen oxides are common atmospheric pollutants. largely resulting from the combustion of fossil fuels and {{a wide range of}} high temperature combustion processes. such as welding and foundry work (1). Additional sources of nitrogen oxides include main-stream and side-stream tobacco smoke (2 - 4) and domes-tic gas stoves (5, 6). Chemical studies in the liquid or solid phase (7 - 10) and in the gas phase (11 - 17) and in vitro studies in plasma (18) and lung homogenates (19) have shown that N 02 can nitrosate secondary amines. resulting in formation of carcinogenic nitrosamines. Extensive in-formation is available on nitrosation of secondary and tertiary amines by sodium nitrite in chemical. in vitro. and in vivo systems (20 - 22), with recent findings on nitrosamine formation in humans (23, 24). We have recently demonstrated in vivo nitrosating potential of N 02 in mice, following gavage with morpholine (25). As an extension of these studies, we present here data on in vivo nitrosation of DMA in mice by inhaled N 02. MATERIALS AND METHODS Analytic grade (> 99. 8 % pure) DMA·HCI and nitro-samine standards. DMN and DPN, were purchase...|$|E
