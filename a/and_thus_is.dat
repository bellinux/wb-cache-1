5|$|Berkelium is a soft, silvery-white, {{radioactive}} metal. The berkelium-249 isotope emits low-energy electrons <b>and</b> <b>thus</b> <b>is</b> {{relatively safe}} to handle. It decays with a half-life of 330days to californium-249, {{which is a}} strong emitter of ionizing alpha particles. This gradual transformation is an important consideration when studying the properties of elemental berkelium and its chemical compounds, since the formation of californium brings not only chemical contamination, but also free-radical effects and self-heating from the emitted alpha particles.|$|E
5|$|Dhumavati {{is always}} {{considered}} a widow, <b>and</b> <b>thus,</b> <b>is</b> the only Mahavidya without a consort. Though associated with Shiva, having eaten him, {{he has since}} left her. Having destroyed the male element (Purusha) in the universe, she is left with nothing, but she is still Shakti, the female element with latent energy. Dhumavati's insatiable hunger and thirst is highlighted in many texts, and has been interpreted as the manifestation of her unsatisfied desires.|$|E
5|$|Drax has opted {{in to the}} Large Combustion Plant Directive (LCPD) <b>and</b> <b>thus</b> <b>is</b> {{permitted}} to continue operating beyond 2015. The use of flue gas desulfurisation ensures that the limits on sulphur dioxide emissions are not exceeded.|$|E

In mainland China {{the direction of}} writing and binding for all books was changed to be like left to right languages in the mid-20th century.|$|R

5|$|In {{synthetic}} diamond {{grown by}} the high-pressure high-temperature synthesis or chemical vapor deposition, defects with symmetry lower than tetrahedral align to {{the direction of}} the growth. Such alignment has been also been observed in gallium arsenide <b>and</b> <b>thus</b> <b>is</b> not unique to diamond.|$|E
5|$|Plutonium also {{exhibits}} valence states {{between 3 and 7}} inclusive, <b>and</b> <b>thus</b> <b>is</b> chemically {{similar to}} neptunium and uranium. It is highly reactive, and quickly forms an oxide film in air. Plutonium reacts with hydrogen even at temperatures {{as low as}} 25–50°C; it also easily forms halides and intermetallic compounds. Hydrolysis reactions of plutonium ions of different oxidation states are quite diverse. Plutonium(V) can enter polymerization reactions.|$|E

5|$|Since 1998, the mallard {{has been}} rated {{as a species}} of least concern on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species. This is {{because it has a}} large range–more than 20,000km2 (7700mi2)–and because its {{population}} is increasing, rather than declining by 30% over ten years or three generations <b>and</b> <b>thus</b> <b>is</b> not warranted a vulnerable rating. Also, the population size of the mallard is very large.|$|E
5|$|Stress in Mongolian is nonphonemic (does not {{distinguish}} different meanings) <b>and</b> <b>thus</b> <b>is</b> considered to depend entirely on syllable structure. But scholarly opinions on stress placement diverge sharply. Most native linguists, {{regardless of which}} dialect they speak, claim that stress falls on the first syllable. Between 1941 and 1975, several Western scholars proposed that the leftmost heavy syllable gets the stress. Yet other positions were taken in works published between 1835 and 1915.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Tug Argan was a land {{battle between}} {{forces of the}} British Empire and Italy which took place on 11–15 August 1940 in what was British Somaliland (later {{independent}} and renamed Somalia). The battle {{was part of the}} Italian conquest of British Somaliland, in which Italy successfully attempted to conquer the latter British colony, <b>and</b> <b>thus</b> <b>is</b> included in the larger East African Campaign of the Second World War.|$|E

5|$|The Grand National has {{the status}} of being an event of {{significant}} national interest within the United Kingdom <b>and</b> <b>thus</b> <b>is</b> listed on the Ofcom Code on Sports and Other Listed and Designated Events.

5|$|The {{analysis}} of the satellite communication relies on {{a limited number of}} data points that were analysed using innovative techniques that were only developed after the incident. The analysis has worked to determine useful information about in-flight events and the location of Flight370 at the 08:19MYT signal—believed to have occurred near the time of fuel exhaustion <b>and</b> <b>thus</b> <b>is</b> close to the final location of Flight370.|$|E

5|$|There are {{a number}} of common misconceptions {{regarding}} sex and pregnancy. Douching after sexual intercourse is not an effective form of birth control.

Women can become pregnant the first time they have sexual intercourse and in any sexual position. It is possible, although not very likely, to become pregnant during menstruation.|$|E

Jerry Brown, who served as governor from 1975 to 1983, is currently serving <b>and</b> <b>thus</b> <b>is</b> not included on this list.|$|E
