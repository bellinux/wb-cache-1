5|$|Equine {{species can}} crossbreed with each other. The most common hybrid is the mule, <b>a</b> <b>cross</b> <b>between</b> <b>a</b> male donkey {{and a female}} horse. With rare exceptions, these hybrids are sterile and cannot reproduce. A related hybrid, a hinny, is <b>a</b> <b>cross</b> <b>between</b> <b>a</b> male horse and a female donkey. Other hybrids include the zorse, <b>a</b> <b>cross</b> <b>between</b> <b>a</b> zebra and a horse and a zonkey or zedonk, a hybrid of a zebra and a donkey. In areas where Grévy's zebras are {{sympatric}} with plains zebras, fertile hybrids do occur.|$|E
5|$|Familiar {{examples}} of equid hybrids are the mule, <b>a</b> <b>cross</b> <b>between</b> <b>a</b> female horse and a male donkey, and the hinny, <b>a</b> <b>cross</b> <b>between</b> <b>a</b> female donkey and a male horse. Pairs of complementary types like the mule and hinny are called reciprocal hybrids.|$|E
5|$|The {{less common}} tiglon or tigon is <b>a</b> <b>cross</b> <b>between</b> <b>a</b> lioness and a male tiger. In {{contrast}} to ligers, tigons are often relatively small {{in comparison to}} their parents, because of reciprocal gene effects.|$|E

5|$|In the 1850s, Stonehenge {{recommended}} <b>a</b> <b>cross</b> <b>between</b> <b>a</b> Beagle and a Scottish Terrier as a retriever. He {{found the}} crossbreed to {{be a good}} worker, silent and obedient, but it had the drawback that it was small and could barely carry a hare.|$|E
5|$|Camel {{hybridisation}} {{began in}} the first millennium BC. For about a thousand years, Bactrian camels and dromedaries have been successfully bred in regions where they are sympatric to form hybrids with either a long, slightly lopsided hump or two humps – one small and one large. These hybrids are larger and stronger than their parents – they can bear greater loads. <b>A</b> <b>cross</b> <b>between</b> <b>a</b> first generation female hybrid and a male Bactrian camel can also produce a hybrid. Hybrids from other combinations tend to be bad-tempered or runts.|$|E
5|$|The {{concert in}} Cologne was {{recorded}} and released as an album titled Symphonic Odysseys by Dog Ear Records, Nobuo Uematsu's recording label. It was announced {{to be in}} production on October 26, 2011, and released on December 28, 2011. The artwork for the album features <b>a</b> <b>cross</b> <b>between</b> <b>a</b> sword and a violin on a white background, in the vein of the Symphonic Fantasies album, which had <b>a</b> <b>cross</b> <b>between</b> <b>a</b> violin and a game controller. The cover art was produced by German design house Schech, who earlier provided the artwork for the European release of Symphonic Fantasies. Accompanying the CD is a booklet which contains photos of the concert and discusses the arrangers and compositions included in each song. The album contains everything played at the concert, with the Final Fantasy suite split into three tracks, and the album is split at the intermission into two CDs. Its fourteen tracks have a duration of 1:34:56. While Dog Ear Records published the album in Japan, the album was released in Europe through the online music retailer MAZ-Sound.|$|E

5|$|The {{less common}} tigon is <b>a</b> <b>cross</b> <b>between</b> <b>a</b> lioness and a male tiger. Because the male tiger does not pass on a growth-promoting gene and the lioness passes on a growth {{inhibiting}} gene, tigons are often relatively small, only weighing up to 150kg (350lb), {{which is about}} 10–20% smaller than lions. Like ligers, they have physical and behavioural traits from both parental species, and males are sterile. Females are sometimes fertile and have occasionally given birth to litigons when mated to a lion.|$|E
5|$|Centaur was {{allocated}} the United Kingdom Official Number 147275 and the Code Letters KHHC. Her {{port of registry}} was Liverpool. When Centaur entered {{service at}} the end of 1924, the Fremantle–Java– Singapore trade route was being serviced by two other Blue Funnel Line vessels; Gorgon (which remained in service until 1928) and Charon (which Centaur was replacing). Centaurs route ran from Fremantle up the Western Australian coast calling at Geraldton, Carnarvon, Onslow, Point Samson, Port Hedland, Broome, and Derby then to the Bali Strait, Surabaya, Semarang, Batavia, and Singapore. Centaur operated as <b>a</b> <b>cross</b> <b>between</b> <b>a</b> tramp steamer and a freight liner; she travelled a set route, but stops at ports along the route varied between journeys. From 1928 until sometime in the 1930s, Centaur remained alone on her route, but the increase in trade along this route prompted Blue Funnel Line to reassign Gorgon and assign the new Charon to work alongside Centaur.|$|E
5|$|Earlier, Riesling was {{sometimes}} {{claimed to have}} originated from wild vines of the Rhine region, without much support to back up that claim. More recently, DNA fingerprinting by Ferdinand Regner indicated that one parent of Riesling is Gouais blanc, known to the Germans as Weißer Heunisch, a variety that, while rare today, was widely grown by the French and German peasantry of the Middle Ages. The other parent is <b>a</b> <b>cross</b> <b>between</b> <b>a</b> wild vine and Traminer. It is presumed that the Riesling was born somewhere in {{the valley of the}} Rhine, since both Heunisch and Traminer have a long documented history in Germany, but with parents from either side of the Adriatic the cross could have happened anywhere on the way.|$|E

5|$|The Selle Français stud {{book has}} long allowed {{crossbreeding}} {{with four other}} breeds: the Thoroughbred, Arabian, Anglo-Arabian and French Trotter. Today, restrictions exist to harmonize the stud book with directives for other European warmblood breeds. For a Selle Français to be registered, it must be from two registered Selle Français parents or from <b>a</b> <b>cross</b> <b>between</b> <b>a</b> Selle Français and a facteur de selle français (non-Selle Français horse that has passed stud book selection procedures). Stallions must pass through a selection process before their progeny is allowed to be registered as Selle Français. The process involves an approval committee that judges stallions on criteria based on the age, breed and nationality of the horses. The qualification criteria involve the conformation, gaits, performance and are scored against national indices.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{designed}} to have a future-retro look, with heavy use of grey tones to give a dreary, stagnant feel to totalitarian London. The largest set created for the film was the Shadow Gallery, which was made to feel like <b>a</b> <b>cross</b> <b>between</b> <b>a</b> crypt and an undercroft. The Gallery is V's home {{as well as the}} place where he stores various artefacts forbidden by the government. Some of the works of art displayed in the gallery include The Arnolfini Portrait by Jan van Eyck, Bacchus and Ariadne by Titian, a Mildred Pierce poster, St. Sebastian by Andrea Mantegna, The Lady of Shalott by John William Waterhouse and statues by Giacometti.|$|E
5|$|The king cheetah is {{a variety}} of cheetah with a rare {{mutation}} for cream-coloured fur marked with large, blotchy spots and three dark, wide stripes extending from their neck to the tail. In 1926 Major A.Cooper wrote about an animal he had shot near modern-day Harare. Describing the animal, he noted its remarkable similarity to the cheetah, but the body of this individual was covered with fur as thick {{as that of a}} snow leopard and the spots merged to form stripes. He suggested that it could be <b>a</b> <b>cross</b> <b>between</b> <b>a</b> leopard and a cheetah. After further similar animals were discovered, it was established they were similar to the cheetah in having non-retractable clawsa characteristic feature of the cheetah.|$|E

5|$|The liger is <b>a</b> <b>cross</b> <b>between</b> <b>a</b> male {{lion and}} a tigress. Because the lion sire passes on a growth-promoting gene, but the {{corresponding}} growth-inhibiting gene from the female tiger is absent, ligers grow far larger than either parent species. They share physical and behavioural qualities of both parent species (spots and stripes on a sandy background). Male ligers are sterile, but female ligers are often fertile. Males {{have about a}} 50% chance of having a mane, but, even if they do, their manes will be only around {{half the size of}} that of a pure lion. Ligers are typically between 10 and 12feet in length, and can weigh between 800 and 1,000pounds or more.|$|E
5|$|The {{collaboration}} between Disney and Square {{resulted in a}} mixture of familiar Disney and Square characters, as well as several new characters created and designed by Tetsuya Nomura. The primary protagonist of the game is Sora, a 14-year-old boy chosen to wield the Keyblade—a weapon which is <b>a</b> <b>cross</b> <b>between</b> <b>a</b> key and a sword—for battling darkness. The game also features two friends from his home world, Riku and Kairi. For most of the game, Sora is joined by Donald Duck and Goofy. Donald, the court wizard, and Goofy, captain of the royal guard, are sent from Disney Castle to find the Keyblade. The three join forces to search for King Mickey Mouse, Kairi, and Riku. The primary antagonist is Ansem, who seeks power and knowledge by using dark beings called the Heartless. The Heartless, hearts corrupted by darkness, serve as most of the enemies encountered in the game and {{come in a variety of}} shapes and sizes. Maleficent, from the 1959 film Sleeping Beauty, leads a group of Disney villains that seeks to use the Heartless for their own gain.|$|E

25|$|The {{second part}} of Kiss' and Aucoin's plan called for the band to appear in a film that would cement their image as larger-than-life rock and roll superheroes.

Although the project was proposed to the band as <b>a</b> <b>cross</b> <b>between</b> <b>A</b> Hard Day's Night and Star Wars, the final result fell far short of those expectations. The script underwent numerous rewrites, and the band (particularly Criss and Frehley) grew increasingly frustrated with the filmmaking process.|$|E
