500|$|The album {{features}} vocal appearances by Timberlake, Timbaland, Pharrell Williams and Kanye West. It features {{production by}} Madonna, Timbaland, Timberlake, The Neptunes and Nate [...] "Danja" [...] Hills. Previously, Madonna {{had worked with}} relatively unknown producers like William Orbit, Mirwais Ahmadzaï and Stuart Price. However, for Hard Candy Madonna decided to collaborate with producers and artists who were already well-known. Talking to MTV, Madonna explained her decision to collaborate with well-known producers: [...] "Because they're good, and I like their shit. [...] I mean, I don't like to repeat myself, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> around thinking, 'What music do I love right now?' And it was actually [...] record FutureSex/LoveSounds. [...] I was listening to it obsessively." ...|$|E
2500|$|At St Peter's, Connolly {{decided he}} wanted to make people laugh. [...] "I can {{remember}} the moment in the school playground. I would have been 7 or 8. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> in a puddle and people were laughing. I had fallen in it and people found it funny. And it wasn't all that uncomfortable, so I stayed in it longer than I normally would because I really enjoyed the laughing. My life was very unhappy at the time, and laughter wasn't something I heard all the time, so it was a joy. And I realised quickly that if you can have an audience this way, life was rather pleasant." [...] While at St Peter's, Connolly joined a gang. His arch-enemy was Geordie Sinclair, who lived around the corner.|$|E
60|$|The {{business}} was just achieved, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> down to take breath, when Mrs. Bretton once more appeared.|$|E
60|$|That afternoon, as Euphemia <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> {{under a tree}} by the tent, we {{were very}} much {{surprised}} to see Pomona come walking down the peninsula.|$|R
6000|$|... "For a week reports {{continued}} favourable. One {{night we}} went to the opera to hear a celebrated prima donna. When we returned home Miriam <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> in her room, chatting over the events of the evening.|$|R
60|$|Well, well! Dora <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> on {{the sofa}} by and by, quiet enough, and Jip was lying in her lap, winking peacefully at me. It was off my mind. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{in a state of}} perfect rapture. Dora <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> engaged.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Doctor, you {{remember}} that you were forward talking to the young Zemindar, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> aft {{by the side of}} Miss Hannay, when they opened fire?" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{suppose they}} 'ad {{been in the}} sulks about a month, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> 'ere one evening getting my breath arter a couple o' hours' 'ard work, when one of 'em, George Tebb by name, came off the ship and nodded to me as he passed.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was just}} half-past eleven. I had not begun to undress, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> {{by the fire}} in my bedroom when I heard the report. It was not very loud--it seemed to be muffled. I rushed down--I don't suppose it was thirty seconds before I was in the room." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "At half-past nine Professor Binkly is {{rolled in}} his quilt snoring in blank verse, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sitting</b> {{by the fire}} {{listening}} to the frogs. Mr. Little Bear slides into camp and sits down against a tree. There is no symptoms of firewater.|$|R
60|$|Lumley <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> in {{the hall}} of Fort Wichikagan, {{awaiting}} the advent of dinner, when the sound of the sleigh-bells just referred to broke upon our ears. We bounded from our seats as if galvanised, seized our caps and rushed out.|$|R
60|$|It is a very, {{very bad}} day here, very dark and very wet. Dolby {{is over at}} Glasgow, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sitting</b> at a side window looking up the length of Prince's Street, {{watching}} the mist change over the Castle and murdering Nancy by turns.|$|R
6000|$|It was a {{few months}} {{afterward}} <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> in my office when in walked old Fagg. I {{was surprised to see}} him down, but we talked over the current topics in that mechanical manner of people who know that they have something else to say, but are obliged to get at it in that formal way. After an interval Fagg in his natural manner said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just as I {{was almost}} here I heard a twig snap behind me, or thought I did, and I jumped {{so as to}} get here and be safe. I didn't suppose anyone would be frightened by little me," [...] he explained. [...] "It was some jump!" [...] exclaimed Jumper the Hare admiringly. [...] "He went right over my head, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> up at that!" ...|$|E
60|$|The morning {{had worn}} away in these inquiries, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> {{on the step}} of an empty shop at a street corner, near the market-place, deliberating upon {{wandering}} towards those other places which had been mentioned, when a fly-driver, coming by with his carriage, dropped a horsecloth. Something good-natured in the man's face, as I handed it up, encouraged me to {{ask him if he}} could tell me where Miss Trotwood lived; though I had asked the question so often, that it almost died upon my lips.|$|E
60|$|Gray <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> {{together}} {{at the far end}} of the block house, to be out of earshot of our officers consulting; and Gray took his pipe out of his mouth and fairly forgot to put it back again, so thunder-struck he was at this occurrence.|$|R
6000|$|Five {{minutes later}} the three {{officers}} had approached so near where Sergeant Corney <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> that we could hear their words once more, and then, to my indignation and the old soldier's anger, Colonel Cox cried, in a fury, as he planted himself {{directly in front of}} the commander: ...|$|R
60|$|Jack <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>sitting,</b> as we <b>were</b> often wont to do, on {{the rocks}} at Spouting Cliff, and Peterkin was {{wringing}} the water from his garments, having recently fallen by accident into the sea--a thing he was constantly doing--when our attention was suddenly arrested by two objects which appeared on the horizon.|$|R
60|$|That evening, about eleven o'clock, auntie {{had gone}} to bed, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> up by myself, musing late over the red cinders in the little back drawing-room grate. I felt as though I couldn't sleep, and so I was waiting up till I got sleepy. Suddenly there came a loud knock and a ring at the bell, after which Amelia ran in {{to say that a}} gentleman wanted to see me in the dining-room on urgent business, and would I please come down to speak with him immediately. I knew at once it was Ernest.|$|E
60|$|Oh! {{what a day}} it was, as {{time went}} on. Madame Croquelebois went to high mass, and Bellote {{remained}} in charge. I was, you understand, a prisoner at large. Provided some one was attending me, I went into any {{room in the house}} save the only one where I cared to be. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> in the salon, with my Bible and Prayer-book before me-- not reading, I fear me, but at any rate attesting my religion, when there came up a message that Son Altesse Royale, the Duke of Gloucester, requested to be admitted to see Mademoiselle de Ribaumont.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{then came}} the missionary. That missionary! What a Guy! Gummy! It was in the afternoon, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> in state in my outer temple place, sitting on that old black stone of theirs, when he came. I heard a row outside and jabbering, and then his voice {{speaking}} to an interpreter. 'They worship stocks and stones,' he said, and I knew what was up, in a flash. I had one of my windows out for comfort, and I sang out straight away {{on the spur of}} the moment. 'Stocks and stones!' I says. 'You come inside,' I says, 'and I'll punch your blooming Exeter Hall of a head.' ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I went to Dino and Carlo's bar in North Beach {{every so}} often with my friend Ron Small. Ron would {{frequently}} meet there with an older guy who <b>I</b> <b>was</b> told worked at the SF Chronicle and on one occasion this Mr. Charles McCabe <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> there waiting for Ron to arrive.|$|R
6000|$|... "It came up {{from the}} sea," [...] she said. [...] "One moment Tony <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> out under the trees to keep away from the sun, and the next we were driven {{shivering}} indoors; It was just like running into a fog bank {{in the middle of}} the Atlantic on a hot summer's day." ...|$|R
60|$|I had {{advanced}} in fame and fortune, my domestic joy <b>was</b> perfect, <b>I</b> had <b>been</b> married ten happy years. Agnes <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> by the fire, {{in our house}} in London, one night in spring, and three of our children were playing in the room, when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> told that a stranger wished to see me.|$|R
60|$|But {{that night}} I {{realized}} that I was once more a useless, lonely old woman. I cried myself to sleep, and next morning I hadn't spunk enough to cook myself a dinner. I dined off some crackers and {{the remnants of}} the apple pies, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> staring at the crumbs when the bell rang. I wiped away my tears and went to the door. Joseph P. Nelson was standing there, and he said, without wasting any words--it was easy to see how that man managed to get railroads built where nobody else could manage it--that he had called to see me on a little matter of business.|$|E
60|$|It {{was about}} eight years arter I 'ad left off going to sea and took up night-watching. A {{beautiful}} summer evening it was, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> by the gate smoking a pipe till it should be time to light up, when I noticed a woman who 'ad just passed turn back and stand staring at me. I've 'ad that sort o' thing before, and I went on smoking and looking straight in front of me. Fat middle-aged woman she was, wot 'ad lost her good looks and found others. She stood there staring and staring, and by and by she tries a little cough.|$|E
6000|$|... "That will please Mamma, I'm sure, {{and make}} her quite forget my naughty prank of yesterday. Do you know I {{offended}} her dreadfully by peeping into the gold case she wears on her neck? She was asleep <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> by her. In her sleep she pulled it out and said something about a letter and Papa. I wanted to see Papa's face, for I never did, because the big picture of him is gone from the gallery where the others are, so I peeped into the case when she let it drop and was so disappointed to find nothing but a key." ...|$|E
6000|$|Lucilla's hand closed fast on mine. [...] "Cruel! cruel!" [...] {{she whispered}} to herself angrily. I gave her a little squeeze, recommending patience--and looked in silent {{expectation}} (just as Nugent was looking too) at Herr Grosse. The German rose deliberately to his feet, and waddled to the place in which Lucilla <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> together.|$|R
6000|$|There was {{one evening}} when she <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> with our sketchbooks {{in the shade}} on the beech at Ilfracombe, while the rest had gone, some to bathe, the others to make {{purchases}} in the town. [...] We had been condoling with one another over the impossibility of finding anything among our water-colours that would express the wondrous tints before our eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Tis always drowsy {{summer when}} From out the past she comes again; The westering {{sunshine}} {{in a pool}} Floats in her parlour still and cool; While the slim bird its lean wires shakes, As into piercing song it breaks; Till Peter's pale-green eyes ajar Dream, wake; wake, dream, in one brief bar. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sitting,</b> dull <b>and</b> shy, And she with gaze of vacancy, ...|$|R
6000|$|As we {{had been}} looking out for fish for some time past, {{everything}} was in readiness for them. The boats were hanging over the side ready to lower, tubs for coiling away the ropes, harpoons, lances, etcetera, all were ready to throw in, and start away at a moment's notice. The man in the [...] "crow's nest," [...] as they call the cask fixed up at the mast-head, was looking anxiously out for whales, and the crew were idling about the deck. Tom Lokins was seated on the windlass smoking his pipe, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> beside him on an empty cask, sharpening a blubber-knife.|$|E
60|$|I {{forget the}} drift of the conversation, {{or what it}} was made Isabel {{interrupt}} me. She did interrupt me. She had been lying prone {{on the ground at}} my right hand, chin on fists, listening thoughtfully, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> beside old Lady Evershead on a garden seat. I turned to Isabel's voice, and saw her face uplifted, and her dear cheeks and nose and forehead all splashed and barred with sunlight and the shadows of the twigs of the trees behind me. And something--an infinite tenderness, stabbed me. It was a keen physical feeling, like nothing I had ever felt before. It had a quality of tears in it. For {{the first time in my}} narrow and concentrated life another human being had really thrust into my being and gripped my very heart.|$|E
6000|$|... 'There was {{the sound}} of a clap of thunder in my ears. I may have been stunned for a moment. A pitiless hail was hissing round me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> on soft turf in front of the overset machine. Everything still seemed grey, but {{presently}} I remarked that the confusion in my ears was gone. I looked round me. I was on {{what seemed to be a}} little lawn in a garden, surrounded by rhododendron bushes, and I noticed that their mauve and purple blossoms were dropping in a shower under the beating of the hail-stones. The rebounding, dancing hail hung in a cloud over the machine, and drove along the ground like smoke. In a moment I was wet to the skin. [...] "Fine hospitality," [...] said I, [...] "to a man who has travelled innumerable years to see you." ...|$|E
6000|$|May I not {{encourage}} {{a hope that}} during the ensuing summer, or at the worst at no distant period, you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> might meet, when a few hours' conversation would effect more than {{could come out of}} a dozen letters dictated, <b>and</b> hastily, as <b>I</b> <b>am</b> obliged to dictate this, from an unexpected interruption when Mrs. W. <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> down with the pen in her hand? ...|$|R
6000|$|My wife <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> at {{the open}} bow-window of my study, {{watching}} the tuft of bright-red leaves on our favorite maple, which warned us that summer <b>was</b> over. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> solacing myself, like all the world in our days, with reading the [...] "Schönberg Cotta Family," [...] when my wife made her voice heard through the enchanted distance, and dispersed the pretty vision of German cottage life.|$|R
60|$|One day, while Lumley <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> at dinner--which {{we usually}} took about noon--we were agreeably {{surprised}} {{by the appearance of}} a strange Indian, and still more agreeably surprised by his entering the hall and holding out a packet to Lumley. Having delivered it, the man, who looked wayworn, strode to the fire, sat quietly down and began to smoke a pipe which I had handed to him ready charged.|$|R
