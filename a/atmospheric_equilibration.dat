The presence of liquid, such as water on Earth or methane on Titan, may affect the threshold values to a great extent. Sediment density is also crucial for determining threshold values. Here we provide quantitative data on density and water content of common wind tunnel materials {{that have been used}} to study conditions on Earth, Titan, Mars, and Venus. The measured density values for low density materials are higher compared to literature values, whereas for the high density materials, there is no such discrepancy. We also find that low density materials have much higher water content and longer <b>atmospheric</b> <b>equilibration</b> timescales compared to high density sediments.

In addition, {{the existence of}} deglacial � 13 C minima in tropical surface water records (2, 3) {{has been difficult to}} explain because the nutrient increase implied by the � 13 C shift is not supported by evidence of increased upwelling in these presently nutrient-poor regions (2). Because the � 13 C of atmospheric CO 2 was lower {{at the onset of the}} deglaciation, tropical surface water � 13 C DIC would have decreased via air-sea equilibration without an accompanying nutrient change. Such a mechanism is analogous to the invasion of low � 13 C anthropogenic CO 2 into the modern surface ocean (7). Taken as a whole, the timing and distribution of the deglacial carbon isotope minimum in tropical marine sediments is consistent with a Southern Ocean origin, with advection through intermediate waters and <b>atmospheric</b> <b>equilibration</b> providing the high-latitude–tropical connection...|$|E
40|$|A Holocene {{sediment}} sequence from Lake Igelsj. on, {{south central}} Sweden, was studied by stable oxygen- and carbon-isotope analyses of different carbonate components. The deposit, which covers the time-span from ca 11, 500 cal BP to the present, was {{laid down in}} a small, kettle-hole lake, the hydrological balance of which is presently dominated by groundwater flow. Isotopic records obtained on bulk carbonates originating mainly from summer-produced, calcitic algal encrustations exhibit several rapid shifts of more than 2 %, likely reflecting pronounced hydrological variations. Corresponding isotopic data obtained on calcitic gastropod opercula from parts of the profile show subdued responses to major climatic shifts, probably related to an extended calcification season. The isotopic records were complemented by studies of modern isotope hydrology, and our interpretations {{are based on a}} simplistic climate-hydrology model in which variations in groundwater generation within the lake catchment produce changes in groundwater level and related adjustments of lake level and surface/volume ratio of the basin during the ice-free season. Assumed periods of decreased lake volume in a relatively dry climate (low lake level) are characterised by enrichment in 18 O and 13 C resulting from increased evaporation/inflow ratio and <b>atmospheric</b> <b>equilibration,</b> respectively. In clear contrast to this situation, intervals of more humid climatic conditions give rise to increased lake volume (high lake level), possibly surface over flow, and relatively depleted isotopic ratios.

40|$|Intraseasonal {{variability}} of deep convection represents a fundamental mode of {{variability in the}} organization of tropical convection. While most studies of intraseasonal oscillations (ISOs) have focused on the spatial propagation and dynamics of convectively coupled circulations, we examine the projection of ISOs on the tropically-averaged temperature and energy budget. The area of interest is the global oceans between 20 degN/S. Our analysis then focuses on these questions: (i) How is tropospheric temperature related to tropical deep convection and the associated ice cloud fractional amount (ICF) and ice water path (IWP) ? (ii) What is the source of moisture sustaining the convection and what role does deep convection play in mediating the PBL - free <b>atmospheric</b> temperature <b>equilibration?</b> (iii) What affect do convectively generated upper-tropospheric clouds have on the TOA radiation budget? Our methodology {{is similar to that of}} Spencer et al., (2007) with some modifications and some additional diagnostics of both clouds and boundary layer thermodynamics. A composite ISO time series of cloud, precipitation and radiation quantities built from nearly 40 events during a six-year period is referenced to the atmospheric temperature signal. The increase of convective precipitation cannot be sustained by evaporation within the domain, implying strong moisture transports into the tropical ocean area. While there is a decrease in net TOA radiation that develops after the peak in deep convective rainfall, there seems little evidence that an "Infrared Iris"- like mechanism is dominant. Rather, the cloud-induced OLR increase seems largely produced by weakened convection with warmer cloud tops.

40|$|Intraseasonal {{variability}} of deep convection represents a fundamental mode of organization for tropical convection. While most studies of intraseasonal oscillations (ISOs) {{have focused on}} the spatial propagation and dynamics of convectively coupled circulations, here we examine the projection of ISOs on the tropically-averaged heat and moisture budget. One unresolved question concerns the degree to which observable variations in the "fast" processes (e. g. convection, radiative / turbulent fluxes) can inform our understanding of feedback mechanisms operable in the context of climate change. Our analysis use daily data from satellite observations, the Modern Era analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA), and other model integrations to address these questions: (i) How are tropospheric temperature variations related to that tropical deep convection and the associated ice cloud fractional amount (ICF), ice water path (IWP), and properties of warmer liquid clouds? (ii) What role does moisture transport play vis-a-vis ocean latent heat flux in enabling the evolution of deep convection to mediate PBL - free <b>atmospheric</b> temperature <b>equilibration?</b> (iii) What affect do convectively generated upper-tropospheric clouds have on the TOA radiation budget? Our methodology {{is similar to that of}} Spencer et al., (2007 GRL) whereby a composite time series of various quantities over 60 + ISO events is built using tropical mean tropospheric temperature signal as a reference to which the variables are related at various lag times (from - 30 to + 30 days). The area of interest encompasses the global oceans between 20 oN/S. The increase of convective precipitation cannot be sustained by evaporation within the domain, implying strong moisture transports into the tropical ocean area. The decrease in net TOA radiation that develops after the peak in deep convective rainfall, is part of the response that constitutes a "discharge" / "recharge" mechanism that facilitates tropical heat balance maintenance on these time scales. However, water vapor and hydrologic scaling relationships for this mode of variability cast doubt on the utility of ISO variations as proxies for climate sensitivity response to external radiatively forced (e. g. greenhouse gas-induced) climate change...|$|R

Atmospheric particles, or particulate matter, can be solid or liquid with diameters varying from around 0. 002 [micrometers] to roughly 100 [micrometers]. Atmospheric aerosol sources {{can be classified}} as primary or secondary, with the primary aerosol being directly emitted from the corresponding sources and the secondary particles being formed in the atmosphere, for example, from gas-phase chemical reactions that produce condensable vapors. At the same time aerosol particles are ultimately connected {{with the formation of}} water droplets and equivalently with the formation of clouds and fogs in the atmosphere. The first part of this thesis concerns the mathematical modeling of wet and dry acid deposition and of the relevant physicochemical processes. Acid deposition consists of the delivery of acidic substances, principally sulfuric and nitric acid, from the atmosphere to the earth's surface. Upon emission to the atmosphere, SO 2 and NOx, are photochemically oxidized, yielding sulfuric and nitric acid vapors. Sulfuric acid is rapidly incorporated into aerosol particles, while nitric acid may be scavenged by particles or droplets or remain in the gas phase. Even {{in the absence of an}} aqueous phase (no clouds or fog), the acidic gases and dry particles can be transported to and deposited at ground level; this process is called dry deposition. When an aqueous phase is present (inside a cloud or a fog), gas-phase species like SO 2, HNO 3, NH 3 and aerosol particles are scavenged by water droplets resulting in a solution that can be significantly acidic. Additional cloudwater or fogwater acidity beyond that attained purely from scavenging of gases and particles results from aqueous-phase chemistry, most notably oxidation of dissolved SO 2 to sulfuric acid. These acidic droplets can reach the earth's surface either as precipitation or as impacted cloud and fogwater, in the processes termed wet deposition. If they are not rained or deposited out the aqueous droplets can evaporate leaving as residue new aerosol particles that may themselves undergo dry deposition to the earth's surface. The effects of acid deposition include soil and lake acidification, forest decline and deterioration of cultural monuments. Mathematical models are a major tool in our effort to understand and ultimately control acid deposition. The development of such a mathematical model represents a major challenge as it requires the ability to describe the entire range of atmospheric physicochemical phenomena. As a first step in the modeling, a comprehensive chemical mechanism for aqueous-phase atmospheric chemistry was developed and its detailed sensitivity analysis was performed. The main aqueous-phase reaction pathways for the system are the oxidation of S(IV) to S(VI) by H 2 O 2, OH, HO 2, O 2 (catalysed by Fe 3 + and Mn 2 +), O 3, and [ [...] . ]. The dominant pathway for HNO 3 (aq) acidity is scavenging of nitric acid from the gas phase. HCOOH is produced because of the reaction of HCHO(aq) with OH(aq). The gas-phase concentrations of SO 2, H 2 O 2, HO 2, OH, O 3, HCHO, NH 3, HNO 3, and HCl are of primary importance. Increase of the liquid water content of the cloud results in a decrease of the sulfate concentration, but an increase of the total sulfate amount in the aqueous-phase. On the basis of the sensitivity analysis, a condensed mechanism was derived. The next step was the development of a model that actually predicts the amount of liquid water in the atmosphere solving the energy balance. This Lagrangian model combines for the first time a detailed description of gas and aqueous-phase atmospheric chemistry with a treatment of the dynamics of radiation fog, that is the fog that is created due to the radiative cooling of the earth's surface to the space during the night. The model was evaluated against a well documented radiation fog episode in Bakersfield in the San Joaquin Valley of California over the period January 4 - 5, 1985. This application showed that the model predictions for temperature profile, fog development, liquid water content, gas-phase concentrations of SO 2, HNO 3, and NH 3, pH, aqueous-phase concentrations of [ [...] . ], [ [...] . ], and [ [...] . ], and finally deposition rates of the above ions match well the observed values. The fog was found to lead to a drastic increase of deposition rates over those in its absence for the major ionic species, with most notable being the increase of sulfate deposition. Several important differences were found to exist between the characteristics of a radiation fog and a representative cloud environment. Radiation fogs typically develop under stable conditions (very low wind speed) resulting in weak mixing and significant vertical gaseous species concentration gradients. Because of the proximity of the fog to ground-level sources of pollutants like SO 2 and NOx, the corresponding gas-phase concentrations can reach much higher levels that in a cloud. In such a case, pathways for aqueous-phase sulfate production that are of secondary importance in a cloud environment may become significant in a fog. The next level of treatment beyond assuming that all the water droplets have the size and chemical composition is to explicitly model the size-composition distribution of droplets as a result of nucleation on aerosol particles. A third model was developed to study the distribution of acidity and solute concentration among the various droplet sizes in a fog or a cloud. The major finding of this study was that significant solute concentration differences can occur in aqueous droplets inside a fog or a cloud. For the fog simulated, during the period of dense fog, the solute concentration in droplets larger than 10 [micrometers] diameter increased with size, in such a way that droplets of diameter 20 [micrometers] attain a solute concentration that is a factor of 3. 6 larger than that in the 10 [micrometer] droplets. Chemical processes tend to decrease the total solute mass concentration differences among the various droplet sizes. Low cooling rates of the system also tend to decrease these concentration differences while high cooling rates have exactly the opposite effect. The mass/size distribution of the condensation nuclei influences quantitatively, but not qualitatively, the above concentration differences. The effects of equilibration processes on wet and dry deposition were then investigated and furthermore the accuracy of the currently used modelling approaches of these phenomena was examined. <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>equilibration</b> processes between two phases with different deposition velocities have the potential to affect significantly the amount of total material deposited on the ground. The magnitude of the effects of the equilibration processes depends primarily on the ratio of the deposition velocities of the two phases, on the production/emission rate of the gas-phase species, and on the initial distribution of species between the two phases. At this point all the tools were available for the detailed investigation of the cyclical relationship between the aerosol and aqueous droplets; a polluted atmosphere with high aerosol concentration assists the formation of the aqueous phase which itself appears to enhance smog production, visibility reduction and aerosol sulfate levels after its dissipation. A model including descriptions of aerosol and droplet microphysics, gas and aqueous-phase chemistry and deposition was used to study the transformation of aerosol to fog droplets and back to aerosol in an urban environment. Fogs in polluted environments have the potential to increase aerosol sulfate concentrations, but at the same time to cause reductions in the aerosol concentration of nitrate, chloride, ammonium and sodium as well as in the total aerosol mass concentration. The sulfate produced during fog episodes favors the aerosol particles that have access to most of the fog liquid water which are usually the large particles.
