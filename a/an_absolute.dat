5|$|As an A-type main {{sequence}} star, Beta Pictoris is more luminous than the Sun: combining the apparent magnitude of 3.861 with {{the distance of}} 19.44 parsecs gives <b>an</b> <b>absolute</b> magnitude of 2.42, {{as compared to the}} Sun, which has <b>an</b> <b>absolute</b> magnitude of 4.83. This corresponds to a visual luminosity 9.2 times greater than that of the Sun. When the entire spectrum of radiation from Beta Pictoris and the Sun is taken into account, Beta Pictoris is found to be 8.7 times more luminous than the Sun.|$|E

5|$|Relative to both {{luminosity}} {{and distance}} from Earth, a star's absolute magnitude (M) and apparent magnitude (m) are not equivalent; for example, the bright star Sirius has an apparent magnitude of −1.44, {{but it has}} <b>an</b> <b>absolute</b> magnitude of +1.41.|$|E

5|$|The Phantom {{is a large}} fighter with a {{top speed}} of over Mach2.2. It can carry more than 18,000 pounds (8,400kg) of weapons on nine {{external}} hardpoints, including air-to-air missiles, air-to-ground missiles, and various bombs. The F-4, like other interceptors of its time, was designed without an internal cannon. Later models incorporated an M61 Vulcan rotary cannon. Beginning in 1959, it set 15 world records for in-flight performance, including <b>an</b> <b>absolute</b> speed record, and <b>an</b> <b>absolute</b> altitude record.|$|E
5|$|Electronic {{tactical}} {{air navigation}} (TACAN) became <b>an</b> <b>absolute</b> necessity in Laos, where mountain peaks and unexpected inclement weather made flying extremely hazardous, especially for older aircraft. This problem was solved by establishing unmanned Air Force stations that broadcast continuous radio transmissions, allowing aerial navigation from fixed geographic reference points. The Air Force also emplaced TSQ-81 radar {{sites in the}} north and northeast to direct Rolling Thunder missions over North Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|HD 154672 {{is located}} 65.8 parsecs (214.6 light years) away from Earth. It has an {{apparent}} magnitude (V) of 8.22, making the star too dim {{to see from}} Earth with the naked eye. The star is slightly dimmer than planet Neptune as perceived with the naked eye, which has an apparent magnitude of 7.78 at its brightest.

5|$|In 1398 Richard summoned {{a packed}} Parliament to Shrewsbury—known as the Parliament of Shrewsbury—which {{declared}} all {{the acts of}} the Merciless Parliament to be null and void, and announced that no restraint could legally {{be put on the}} king.

5|$|In 1845, Arago {{suggested}} to Fizeau and Foucault that {{they attempt to}} measure the speed of light. Sometime in 1849, however, {{it appears that the}} two had a falling out, and they parted ways pursuing separate means of performing this experiment. In 1848−49, Fizeau used, not a rotating mirror, but a toothed wheel apparatus to perform <b>an</b> <b>absolute</b> measurement of the speed of light in air. In 1850, Fizeau and Foucault both used rotating mirror devices to perform relative measures of the speed of light in air versus water. Foucault used a scaled-up version of the rotating mirror apparatus to perform <b>an</b> <b>absolute</b> measurement of the speed of light in 1862. Subsequent experiments performed by Marie Alfred Cornu in 1872–76 and by Albert A. Michelson in 1877–1931 used improved versions of the toothed wheel and rotating mirror experiments to make steadily more accurate estimates of the speed of light.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to political campaigning, the NSDAP engaged in paramilitary {{violence and the}} spread of anti-communist propaganda in the days preceding the election. On election day, 6 March 1933, the NSDAP's share of the vote increased to 43.9 percent, and the party acquired the largest number of seats in parliament. Hitler's party failed to secure <b>an</b> <b>absolute</b> majority, necessitating another coalition with the DNVP.|$|E
5000|$|One way to {{identify}} <b>a</b> nominative <b>absolute</b> {{is to add}} a conjunction and a verb: one can often (though not always) create a subordinate clause out of <b>a</b> nominative <b>absolute</b> by adding <b>a</b> subordinating conjunction (such as [...] "because" [...] or [...] "after") and a form of the verb to be.|$|R

5|$|It thus {{appears that}} prior to the cession the Mexican authorities, upon examination, found that the Indians had {{abandoned}} the land; that the only adverse claim was vested in the mission of San Diego and made <b>an</b> <b>absolute</b> grant, subject only to the condition of satisfying whatever claims the mission might have. How can it be said therefore that when the cession was made by Mexico to the United States there was a present recognition by the Mexican government of the occupancy of these Indians? On the contrary, so far as any official action is disclosed, it was distinctly to the contrary, and carried with it an affirmation that they had abandoned their occupancy, and that whatever of title there was outside of the Mexican nation was in the mission, and <b>an</b> <b>absolute</b> grant was made subject only {{to the rights of}} such mission.|$|E
5|$|It {{was noted}} that the naming process would remain stalled without such rules, and that even with them, few of these bodies can be imaged with {{sufficient}} resolution to determine their shapes.
