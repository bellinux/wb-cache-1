5|$|Faced {{with these}} {{proposals}} to examine nuclear {{power as a}} possible response to climate change, anti-nuclear campaigners and scientists in Australia emphasised claims that nuclear power could not significantly substitute for other power sources, and that uranium mining itself could become <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> greenhouse gas emissions. Anti-nuclear campaigns were given added impetus by public concern about the sites for possible reactors: fears exploited by anti-nuclear power political parties in the lead-up to a national election in 2007.|$|E
50|$|Currently, {{the biggest}} {{renewable}} <b>source</b> <b>of</b> {{energy in the}} UK is wind power, and the UK {{has some of the}} best wind resources in Europe. The UK has relatively small hydroelectricity deployment and resources, although some pumped storage exists. Solar power is rapidly growing and provides significant power during daylight hours, but total energy provided is still small. Biofuels are also used as <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> power. Geothermal is not highly accessible and is not <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>source.</b> Tidal resources are present and experimental projects are being tested, but are likely to be expensive.|$|R

5|$|Farming was {{the main}} {{occupation}} in Urmston until the early 19th century, when weaving became <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> employment, although this later declined due to competition from large industry. In 1848, the population was recorded as being 771, with around 80% of the land being farmed. The opening of the Cheshire Lines Railway in 1873 allowed the town to grow as a commuter town: between 1871 and 1901 the population grew by over 650%, from 996 to 6,594. By 1901, farming had virtually died out, and the town became a residence for the middle classes.|$|E

50|$|The bomb casing can be <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> neutron-activated radioisotopes. The {{neutron flux}} in the bombs, {{especially}} thermonuclear devices, {{is sufficient for}} high-threshold nuclear reactions. The induced isotopes include cobalt-60, 57 and 58, iron-59 and 55, manganese-54, zinc-65, yttrium-88, and possibly nickel-58 and 62, niobium-63, holmium-165, iridium-191, and short-lived manganese-56, sodium-24, silicon-31, and aluminium-28. Europium-152 and 154 can be present, {{as well as two}} nuclear isomers of rhodium-102. During the Operation Hardtack, tungsten-185, 181 and 187 and rhenium-188 were produced from elements added as tracers to the bomb casings, to allow identification of fallout produced by specific explosions. Antimony-124, cadmium-109, and cadmium-113m are also mentioned as tracers.|$|R
5|$|Prior to the Spanish {{invasion}} in 1524, {{the population of}} Guatemala was almost exclusively Maya. The Spanish conquest created a system of wealthy European landowners overseeing a labor force composed of slaves and bonded laborers. However, the community lands of the indigenous population remained in their control until the late 19th century. At this point, rising global demand for coffee made its export <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> income for the government. As a result, the state supported the coffee growers by passing legislation that took land away from the Indian population, as well as relaxing labor laws so that bonded labor could be used on the plantations.|$|E
5|$|By the 14thcentury, Norwich {{was one of}} {{the largest}} and most prosperous cities in England, and Norwich Market was a major trading hub. Control of, and income from, the market was ceded by the monarchy to the city of Norwich in 1341, from which time it {{provided}} <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> income for the local council. Freed from royal control, the market was reorganised to benefit the city as much as possible. Norwich and the surrounding region were devastated by plague and famine in the latter half of the 14thcentury, with the population falling by over 50%. Following the plague years, Norwich came under the control of local merchants and the economy was rebuilt. In the early 15thcentury, a Guildhall was built next to the market to serve as a centre for local government and law enforcement. The largest surviving mediaeval civic building in Britain outside London, it remained the seat of local government until 1938 and in use as a law court until 1985.|$|E
5|$|In 1878 the Cremation Society of Great Britain {{bought an}} {{isolated}} {{piece of the}} LNC's Brookwood land and built Woking Crematorium on the site. The crematorium was completed in 1879 but Richard Cross, the Home Secretary, bowed to strong protests from local residents and threatened to prosecute if any cremations were conducted. As a consequence the crematorium was not used other than for the experimental incineration of livestock. The 1884 trial of William Price established that human cremation was not unlawful in England, and on 26March 1885 the first human cremation took place at Woking. Although the LNC was hostile {{to the idea of}} cremation, Woking Crematorium was the only operational crematorium in the country. Since the Necropolis Railway provided the easiest way to transport bodies and mourners from London to the Woking area, transport to and from Woking Crematorium soon began to provide <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> revenue for the LNC.|$|E

For the 2009–10 season, average attendances across the league clubs were 34,215 for Premier League matches {{with a total}} {{aggregate}} attendance figure of 13,001,616. This represents an increase of 13,089 from the average attendance of 21,126 recorded in the league's first season (1992–93). However, during the 1992–93 season the capacities of most stadiums were reduced as clubs replaced terraces with seats {{in order to meet}} the Taylor Report's 1994–95 deadline for all-seater stadiums. The Premier League's record average attendance of 36,144 was set during the 2007–08 season. This record was then beaten in the 2013–14 season recording an average attendance of 36,695 with a total attendance of just under 14 million, the highest average in England's top flight since 1950.|$|E
