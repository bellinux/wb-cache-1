5|$|Despite {{there being}} only two flat stages (the first two road race days), many top-tier sprinters started the race, as the Tirreno–Adriatico is {{traditionally}} {{considered to be}} excellent preparation for Milan–San Remo. Every Milan–San Remo winner since Andrei Tchmil in 1999 raced Tirreno–Adriatico (rather than Paris–Nice) beforehand. Tyler Farrar, Tom Boonen, Alessandro Petacchi, André Greipel, world champion Thor Hushovd, the aforementioned McEwen, and the last two Milan–San Remo winners Mark Cavendish and Óscar Freire <b>all</b> <b>started</b> the race.|$|E

5|$|I {{certainly}} don't see gay {{and lesbian}} history starting with Stonewall... and I don't see resistance starting with Stonewall. What I do see is a historical coming together of forces, and the sixties changed how human beings endured things in this society and what they refused to endure... Certainly something special happened on that night in 1969, and we've made it more special in our need to have what I call a point of origin... it's more complex than saying that it <b>all</b> <b>started</b> with Stonewall.|$|E
5|$|A dance crew {{is a team}} {{of street}} dancers who come {{together}} to develop new moves and battle other crews. As hip-hop culture spread throughout New York City, the more often breaking crews got together to battle against each other. It was during this time that the different dance moves within breaking developed organically. All styles of hip-hop are rooted in battling, and {{being a part of}} a crew {{was the only way to}} learn when these styles began because they were not taught in studios: they <b>all</b> <b>started</b> out as social dances. Forming and participating in a crew is how street dancers practiced, improved, made friends, and built relationships. In breaking in particular, battling is how b-boys/b-girls improved their skill.|$|E

Over the last 100+ years, many students have chosen careers in public service; the ministry and teaching have been traditional vocations, but some chose politics.

As a station ship she was assigned to monitor 1) Internal Japanese Fleet frequencies 2) Frequencies measurements and DF or direction finder azimuths. She had three intercept operators and one chief radioman supervised by an officer. This <b>all</b> <b>started</b> in 1933 during the reconstruction of the Japanese fleet by Tokyo.

25|$|Superficially, Charlemagne {{seemed to}} have imposed himself on Benevento. Arechis had paid tribute {{and one of his}} sons was being held hostage as a {{guarantee}} of Benevento's loyalty. Frankish influence was also given formal expression. Traditionally Benevento had produced and used gold coinage, but from 787 the Beneventan mint began to strike silver coins too. The new coins were similar to those issued by Charlemagne's Frankish kingdom. Both the new silver and the traditional gold coins, as well as Beneventan legal documents, <b>all</b> <b>started</b> to include Charlemagne's name and title alongside those of Arechis. The inclusion of titles on coins and in charters was considered an important marker of political authority.|$|E
25|$|By {{the second}} half of the 19th century, Berlin had been growing at a {{tremendous}} rate for some time, but its growth accelerated even faster after the city became the capital of the new German Empire on 18 January 1871.

Now firmly in the centre of a metropolis whose population eventually reached 4.4 million, making it the third largest city in the world after London and New York, the area was ready to take on its most celebrated role. Vast hotels and department stores, hundreds of smaller shops, theatres, dance-halls, cafés, restaurants, bars, beer palaces, wine-houses and clubs, <b>all</b> <b>started</b> to appear. Some of these places became internationally known.|$|E
