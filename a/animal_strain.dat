In this study, we investigated {{the influence of}} fish oil enriched diets on lipid and lipoprotein metabolism in F₁B and GS hamsters {{to determine if the}} response was preserved within <b>animal</b> <b>strain.</b> Hamsters were fed either fish oil, a diet high in monounsaturated fatty acids, or a diet with an n- 6 :n- 3 fatty acid ratio of 5. Fish oil induced hyperlipidemia to a much greater extent in F₁B compared to GS hamsters. Fish oil fed F₁B hamsters had milky plasma containing chylomicron-like particles which was not observed in GS hamsters. The concentration of plasma cholesterol, triglycerides, free cholesterol, and cholesterol esters were significantly higher in fish oil fed F₁B hamsters compared to GS hamsters. Feeding a diet with an n- 6 :n- 3 ratio of 5 markedly decreased all lipid parameters in F₁B and GS hamsters compared to the fish oil diet. However, this diet increased LDL-cholesterol concentrations compared to the diet rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, suggesting that even a small amount of fish oil in the diet has a deleterious effect on the plasma lipoprotein profile. The presence of milky plasma, and elevated triglyceride concentrations suggested an inhibition of clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins in F₁B hamsters. Thus, we investigated the activity of LPL, MTTP, LDL-receptor mRNA expression, and the protein expression of apoB and apoE to determine if diet or <b>animal</b> <b>strain</b> had an effect on these aspects of lipoprotein clearance. LPL activity, MTTP activity, and LDL-receptor mRNA expression were unaffected by diet, however LPL activity was lower in F₁B hamsters. In addition, the protein expression of apoB and apoE were altered by both diet and <b>animal</b> <b>strain.</b> In conclusion, comparison of F₁B and GS hamsters allowed us to attribute the fish oil induced hyperlipidemia to diversity in <b>animal</b> <b>strain...</b>|$|E

The ability to form inclusions after the addition of penicillin was much reduced in the two animal isolates (koala LPCoLN, bandicoot B 21) compared to the two human isolates (respiratory AR 39, heart A 03). The penicillin treatment resulted in a dose dependent loss of infectious progeny for all isolates, with the human strains failing to produce infectious progeny at lower doses of penicillin than the <b>animal</b> <b>strains.</b> The most remarkable finding however was the contrasting ability of the isolates to recover infectious progeny production after rescue by removal of the penicillin (at 72 h) and continued culture.

Moreover, the level of functional recovery 3 weeks after injury induced in juvenile rats (1 month old) was not globally different from that in younger adult, adult (10 month old) and older adult (24 month old) Wistar rats. Furthermore, the level of recovery of some contractile parameters differed between Wistar and Sprague-Dawley strains 3 weeks after injury. In conclusion, a very long time (> 12 weeks) is required for full neuromuscular recovery following neuromyotoxic injury of young adult rats.

40|$|By DNA-DNA hybridization, we {{classified}} 26 human strains, 4 dog and cat strains, and 4 hamster strains putatively {{identified as}} Helicobacter cinaedi {{as well as}} 2 human <b>strains</b> and 2 <b>animal</b> <b>strains</b> of Helicobacter fennelliae. All but one human strain belonged to the same hybridization group as the type strain of H. cinaedi. The <b>animal</b> <b>strains</b> also appeared to belong to this hybridization group. Both human strains of H. fennelliae were shown to be H. fennelliae by DNA-DNA hybridization, but both <b>animal</b> <b>strains</b> were less than 15 % related to the type strain. All strains were also characterized by plasmid profiles and ribotyping. Plasmids were found in 23 % of the human strains, 100 % of the hamster strains, and 33 % of the dog and cat strains. Human strains were essentially identical by ribotyping, but were clearly differentiated from the hamster and dog and cat strains. Some strains {{may be difficult to}} culture on primary isolation; we found that our strains grew well on anaerobic CDC agar, brucella agar, and tryptic soy agar II. Our H. cinaedi and H. fennelliae strains differed from those previously described because some were resistant to cephalothin: some H. cinaedi strains were also resistant to nalidixic acid. All isolates were also characterized by antimicrobial susceptibility testing. We found that human strains of H. cinaedi were more resistant to clindamycin and erythromycin than were animal isolates; 19 % of the human strains were resistant to ciprofloxacin. Therefore, we recommend that antimicrobial susceptibility results be obtained before initiating therapy for H. cinaedi and H. fennelliae infections...|$|R
