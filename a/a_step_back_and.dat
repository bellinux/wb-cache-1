The album was originally scheduled for an early 2010 release, but Shinoda was concerned with [...] "the quality of the tunes" [...] and said, [...] "if we need to take <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> make sure everything is top, top quality by our standards, we will". Shinoda also said that, in comparison to Minutes to Midnight, the new album would have a bigger [...] "thread of consistency" [...] and would be more experimental and [...] "hopefully more cutting-edge".|$|E
500|$|On October 22, 2015, {{producer}} Malek Akkad {{expressed his}} wishes to postpone production {{for the new}} Halloween film and insists that the next iteration and the extra time {{will result in a}} better film. Malek said of Halloween Returns: [...] "Although, I have to say, and this is somewhat new news, but unfortunately things happen in Hollywood where you have issues with studios and different variables. We've had to take <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> now we’re trying to re-figure this beast that is the new Halloween. So there {{is a bit of a}} delay, but this new Halloween isn't going to be quite what has been announced and what people are expecting, so we're making some changes there as well." ...|$|E

500|$|Q {{performs}} her own stunts in the series. The actress {{liked to}} have her character [...] "be able to do her own thing," [...] as it is an action series where females play lead roles; during her film career, she noted [...] "but in movies, alongside big action men, we've always got to take <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> let the men shine. And in this, it's about the women who know what they're doing." [...] At some point Q set up a three-week long training period {{for the rest of}} the cast to make their fight scenes in the series believable; she had her partner, an action director, bring his stunt team to train them. In filming the stunts she was already used to working in an environment where filming in television would be faster than in American films, because of her time starring in films in Asia, which usually took two to six weeks.|$|E
500|$|In 2015, Nolan's {{production}} company Syncopy formed {{a joint venture}} with Zeitgeist Films, to release Blu-ray editions of Zeitgeist's prestige titles. Their first project was Elena (2011) from director Andrey Zvyagintsev. As part of a Blu-ray release of the Quay brothers animated work, Nolan directed the documentary short Quay (2015). He also initiated a theatrical tour, showcasing the Quays' In Absentia, The Comb and Street of Crocodiles. The program and Nolan's short received critical acclaim, with Indiewire writing in their review that the brothers [...] "will undoubtedly have hundreds, if not thousands more fans because of Nolan, and for that The Quay Brothers in 35mm will always be one of latter's most important contributions to cinema". In 2015, Nolan joined The Film Foundation's board of directors, a non-profit organization dedicated to film preservation. Having been instrumental in keeping the production of film stock alive in the 21st century, Nolan invited over 30 representatives from leading American film archives, labs and presenting institutions to participate in an informal summit entitled Reframing the Future of Film at the Getty Museum in March 2015. On 7 May, it was announced that Nolan and Martin Scorsese had been appointed by the Library of Congress to serve on the National Film Preservation Board (NFPB) as DGA representatives. In 2016, Nolan and Thomas opted to take <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> only serve as executive producers on Zack Snyder's [...] (2016), the sequel to Man of Steel. Later that year, Nolan was featured in the documentary Cinema Futures (2016) by Austrian filmmaker Michael Palm.|$|E

The composition almost revived her No. 1 status in February 2001, returning her into the Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play list, and delivering her a Top 3 entry also in the millennium (No. 2). Although the song {{was at the end}} of the year classified as the 30th most successful US Dance track of 2001, it did not enter the official Hot 100 chart.|$|E

He scored it a 4.0 out of 5 and praised the [...] "fantastic" [...] presentation, {{the amount of}} depth, the [...] "great" [...] soundtrack, and the involvement of Spike Lee. Charles did feel as though the controls could have been better and disliked the dialogue in MyCareer mode. Charles concluded his review by saying: [...] " [...] possibly the most complete game to the series. Truly when picking a title for yourself it’s all about your preference. I actually like NBA Live 16s Pro-Am more, yet I like the way 2K16 presents its product {{on and off the}} court.

It definitely makes you take <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> try to gain some perspective on this world we live in". [...] "Big Bad World" [...] was written for his son Hudson {{who was born in}} March 2012. He said, [...] "It's about that promise we all make to our kids, but realise we don't have as much control as we think. We want to protect them from the big bad world, but the promise matters the most." [...] "Used to You" [...] is a song Sebastian wrote for his wife Jules. He said, [...] "I always say to her, 'I don't get used to you'. I still get back from tours and I'm still excited to see her. [...] We've been friends for 18 years, together for 13 years.

You know the guy who wrote the song with Otis Redding is playing guitar. The same with Midnight Hour and Knock on Wood. All these songs that I keep starting. These guys played on the original and wrote the songs, and were the sound that created them."

I'm having the time of my life and it's an honour to play with you." ...|$|E

[...] Cropper later spoke on AllMemphisMusic, [...] "hearing him singing our music, which was born and raised and produced and recorded in Memphis, Tennessee. [...] It just filled our hearts."

Sebastian was nominated for a Helpmann Award for Best Performance in an Australian Contemporary Concert for The Memphis Tour, and was awarded two Australian Club Entertainment Awards, best Original Music Performer and Outstanding Club Performer of the Year. The Memphis Album received a nomination for Highest Selling Album at the 2008 ARIA Awards, his third album to be nominated in this ARIA Awards category. He travelled to the US several times after The Memphis Tour to write for his fifth album, spending time with Cropper in Nashville on these trips.|$|E

This commentary focuses {{on the first of}} the three. At the ground level, research on the effectiveness of early childhood interventions has progressed steadily over the past few decades.

40|$|Strategic {{practitioners}} and business scholars continuously analyze and study competitive advantage through innovation, seeking measurements that {{provide evidence of}} cause and effect. As a policy matter and academic matter, the impact of intellectual property rights on innovation is still debated. Despite the argument from authority via some bureaus, institutions and vested interests, who do emphasize some empirical studies, the matter remains unsettled. This would appear perplexing considering the volumes of scholarship surrounding this topic. This dissertation encourages <b>a</b> <b>stepping</b> <b>back</b> <b>and,</b> via refreshed considerations of classical and contemporary international business literature, a baselining of the analysis. A means to balance the holistic with the detailed is necessary; innovation proxies, such as R&D spending or patent activity, are suspect given the fluid nature of innovation. Offering an enhancement to the value chain paradigm, a means to assess innovation as comparative advantage demands respect to the holistic activities of firms and country institutions. Property rights are often employed to show economic growth and innovation; however, property rights require parsing to determine if physical property rights alone are an impetus to innovation without reliance on intellectual property rights. The usage of patent as innovation proxy is challenged in this thesis. Thus, the argument is constructed by viewing multiple, theoretical drivers that effect the firm as well as country-specific institutions. The results indicate that patent protection is not correlated with macro-level views of innovation, {{and it is not}} an appropriate proxy for innovation unless confined in the narrowest of scenarios.
