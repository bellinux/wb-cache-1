In this study, we investigated a role of MIP- 2 in concanavalin A (Con A) -induced liver injury in mice. Methods:Liver injury was induced by intravenous <b>injection</b> of Con <b>A</b> (15 mg/kg) and plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT), MIP- 2 levels were determined and histological assessment of the liver was performed. Anti-mouse MIP- 2 antibody was intravenously administered 30 min before Con <b>A</b> <b>injection.</b> Results: Plasma ALT level significantly elevated and reached a maximum at 8 h after Con <b>A</b> <b>injection.</b> Plasma MIP- 2 level was also elevated and reached peak value at 2 h after Con <b>A</b> <b>injection.</b> The elevated ALT level by Con <b>A</b> <b>injection</b> was significantly inhibited by MIP- 2 antibody. The elevated plasma MIP- 2 level after Con <b>A</b> <b>injection</b> was significantly reduced by TNF-a antibody, and MIP- 2 was induced in plasma after recombinant TNF-a injection. Hepatic necrosis and infiltration of neutrophils were observed after Con <b>A</b> <b>injection,</b> and these histological changes were attenuated by MIP- 2 antibody. Conclusion: These findings suggest that Con A induces TNF-a release, and this TNF-a stimulates MIP- 2 induction, at least partially contributing to the liver injury mediated through the recruitment of neutrophils...|$|R

5|$|A {{spontaneous}} {{cerebrospinal fluid}} leak {{is one of}} several types of cerebrospinal fluid leaks and occurs due to the presence of one or more holes in the dura. A spontaneous CSF leak, as opposed to traumatically caused CSF leaks, arises idiopathically. A loss of CSF greater than its rate of production leads to a decreased volume inside the skull known as intracranial hypotension. Any CSF leak is most often characterized by orthostatic headaches â headaches that worsen in a vertical position and improve when lying down. Other symptoms can include neck pain or stiffness, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, fatigue, and a metallic taste in the mouth (indicative of a cranial leak). A CT scan can identify the site of a cerebrospinal fluid leakage. Once identified, the leak can often be repaired by an epidural blood patch, <b>an</b> <b>injection</b> of the patient's own blood {{at the site of the}} leak, a fibrin glue injection or surgery. When the cause cannot be identified the set of symptoms is referred to as spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leak syndrome (SCSFLS).|$|E
5|$|Emergency {{treatment}} is only needed {{if a person}} is showing signs of a severe allergic reaction. Prior to calling for help, stung persons should be laid down, and their legs elevated. An EpiPen or an Anapen is given to people at risk of anaphylaxis, to use in case they are stung. If someone experiences anaphylactic shock, adrenaline and intravenous infusions are required, and those who suffer cardiac arrest require resuscitation. Desensitisation (also called allergy immunotherapy) is offered to those who are susceptible to M. pilosula stings, and the program has shown effectiveness in preventing anaphylaxis. However, the standardisation of M. pilosula venom is not validated, and the program is poorly funded. The Royal Hobart Hospital and the Royal Adelaide Hospital are the only known hospitals to run desensitisation programs.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the hypothesis that}} the need for clean intermittent self-catheterization after botulinum neurotoxin type <b>A</b> <b>injections</b> is outweighed by the efficacy of this treatment, so that clean intermittent self-catheterization is not a burden for patients with refractory idiopathic detrusor overactivity. METHODS: Women undergoing intradetrusor injections of 200 units botulinum neurotoxin type A for refractory idiopathic detrusor overactivity were evaluated prospectively. Clean intermittent self-catheterization was discussed with all patients and its possible need after botulinum neurotoxin type A treatment. As indicator of quality of life, lower urinary tract symptom distress and effect on daily activities were assessed using the validated Urogenital Distress Inventory (UDI- 6) and Incontinence Impact Questionnaire (IIQ- 7) before and 4 weeks after receiving botulinum neurotoxin type <b>A</b> <b>injections.</b> RESULTS: Mean age of the 65 women was 51 years, and all voided spontaneously before botulinum neurotoxin type <b>A</b> <b>injections.</b> After botulinum neurotoxin type A treatment, 28 (43 %) required clean intermittent self-catheterization. Mean UDI- 6 and IIQ- 7 scores reduced from 61 to 33 (P<. 001) and 62 to 30 (P<. 001) in women performing clean intermittent self-catheterization and from 60 to 28 (P<. 001) and 64 to 25 (P<. 001) in those who did not, respectively. Comparison of quality of life in women performing clean intermittent self-catheterization and in those who did not revealed no significant differences before and after botulinum neurotoxin type A treatment. CONCLUSION: Clean intermittent self-catheterization after botulinum neurotoxin type <b>A</b> intradetrusor <b>injections</b> did not impair quality of life in appropriately informed and selected women in the short term. All patients should be informed of the potential need for clean intermittent self-catheterization after botulinum neurotoxin type <b>A</b> <b>injections,</b> and <b>a</b> willingness to do so should be a prerequisite for this still unlicensed off-label treatment...|$|R
40|$|To {{improve the}} {{efficiency}} of hepatic intra-arterial (h. i. a.) chemotherapy, we selected pirarubicin (THP) because it shows good properties for h. i. a. chemotherapy, such as fast and efficient cellular uptake, and used it for h. i. a. chemotherapy in rabbits with V x 2 tumour implanted in the liver. The anti-tumour effect of THP upon h. i. a. administration was compared with that upon intravenous (i. v.) injection and also with the anti-tumour activity of epirubicin (EPI) upon h. i. <b>a.</b> <b>injection</b> using optimal and maximal tolerated doses of each drug. When tumour growth rates and morphometric examinations were evaluated, {{it was found that}} THP and EPI were effective against V x 2 tumour when injected via the h. i. a. route.

Hepatic intra-arterial injection of THP accomplished a selective and higher uptake into the tumour and lower effusion into the plasma than i. v. injection of THP or h. i. <b>a.</b> <b>injection</b> of EPL.

5|$|Injection {{moulding}} machines {{consist of}} a material hopper, <b>an</b> <b>injection</b> ram or screw-type plunger, and a heating unit. Also known as platens, they hold the moulds in which the components are shaped. Presses are rated by tonnage, which expresses the amount of clamping force that the machine can exert. This force keeps the mould closed during the injection process. Tonnage can vary from less than 5 tons to over 9,000 tons, with the higher figures used in comparatively few manufacturing operations. The total clamp force needed {{is determined by the}} projected area of the part being moulded. This projected area is multiplied by a clamp force of from 1.8 to 7.2 tons for each square centimetre of the projected areas. As a rule of thumb, 4 or 5 tons/in2 can be used for most products. If the plastic material is very stiff, it will require more injection pressure to fill the mould, and thus more clamp tonnage to hold the mould closed. The required force can also be determined by the material used {{and the size of the}} part. Larger parts require higher clamping force.|$|E
