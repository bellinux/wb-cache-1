25|$|The Me 262 was {{difficult}} to counter because its high speed and rate of climb {{made it hard to}} intercept. However, as with other turbojet engines at the time, the Me 262's engines did not provide sufficient thrust at low air speeds and throttle response was slow, meaning in certain circumstances such as takeoff and landing, the aircraft became a vulnerable target. Another disadvantage that pioneering jet aircraft of the World War II era shared, was the high risk of compressor stall and if throttle movements were too rapid, the engine(s) could suffer a flame out. The coarse opening of the throttle would cause fuel surging and lead to excessive jet pipe temperatures. Pilots were instructed to operate the throttle gently and avoid quick changes.

50|$|After {{developing}} the Stall Warning Device, Greene continued developing aviation inventions.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop an integrated control strategy for the activated sludge process. For the purpose of this study, the system included the influent pump station, the biological reactor, the air supply and distribution system, and the solids-liquid separator. A comprehensive dynamic model was developed for the system and control was superimposed on the model. The overall model of the system consisted of deterministic and stochastic components. The models for individual process units were taken from the literature and modified where necessary to include features necessary for control strategy development. Computer simulations were used to investigate the control strategies, interactions between the control loops, interactions between process units, and between design and operation. A limited amount of data was available from a full scale experiment conducted at a wastewater treatment plant in Houston, Texas. The objective function was to minimize operating costs and permit limits were treated as constraints. The control strategy for the biological reactor was based on a definition of process state consisting of a combination of D. O. concentration and specific oxygen uptake rate. A rule based controller was designed to maintain the optimal process state. Computer simulations suggested that control of flow between the biological reactor and the separator was capable of eliminating high frequency variations in flow rate. This strategy was proposed for minimizing adverse effects on clarification. For low-friction-head, high-static-head pump stations, on/off pumping was found to require less energy than variable speed pumping or <b>automatic</b> <b>throttling</b> of the discharge. Due to the small size of the wet well, variable speed pumping was found to be incapable of significantly dampening variations in influent flow rate...|$|R
5000|$|The Gyrodyne was a compact, {{streamlined}} rotorcraft weighing {{just over}} 4,410 lb (2,000 kg) and {{powered by a}} [...] Alvis Leonides 522/2 radial engine, the power from which could be transmitted in variable ratios to the fixed-shaft/swashplate-actuated tilting hub-controlled rotor and the wing tip mounted propeller. The Gyrodyne possessed the hovering capability of a helicopter, while its propeller provided the necessary thrust for forward flight to enable its rotor, driven at low torque in cruise flight, to operate at low collective pitch with the tip-path plane parallel to the flight path to minimise vibration at high airspeed. Collective pitch was an <b>automatic</b> function of <b>throttle</b> setting and profile drag of the propeller, which to maintain rpm diverted torque away from the rotor as airspeed increased.|$|R

50|$|An {{autothrottle}} (<b>automatic</b> <b>throttle)</b> {{allows a}} pilot {{to control the}} power setting of an aircraft's engines by specifying a desired flight characteristic, rather than manually controlling the fuel flow. These systems can conserve fuel and extend engine life by metering the precise amount of fuel required to attain a specific target indicated air speed, or the assigned power for different phases of flight. A/T and AFDS (Auto Flight Director Systems) work together to fulfill the whole flight plan and greatly reduce the pilots' work load.|$|E
50|$|Airbus Industrie {{was aware}} of the <b>automatic</b> <b>throttle</b> system (ATS) malfunction. This defect could cause either the jamming of both {{throttles}} and ATS disconnection, or one throttle moving to idle while the other remained above climb power, without ATS disconnection. Investigators stated that the most probable cause of this malfunction was due to the excessive friction in the cinematic linkages between the throttle and the ATS coupling units. At the time of the accident, the Flight Crew Operating Manual (FCOM) issued by Airbus Industrie didn't include the procedures to cope with the anomaly. However, the FCOM issued by TAROM and Swissair did include these procedures.|$|E
50|$|If {{aerobatic}} '3D' {{performance is}} desired, then <b>automatic</b> <b>throttle,</b> or idle up, mode of flight is used. In this mode, the collective pitch ranges from its negative limit at 0% throttle stick input, {{up to its}} positive limit at 100% throttle stick. The throttle, on the other hand, is modulated automatically to maintain a constant rotor speed and is usually at its lowest value when the throttle stick is centered and the pitch is 0. This mode allows the rotor to produce a thrust upwards (by using negative pitch) which, when the model is inverted, allows sustained inverted flight. Usually a more advanced computer radio is used {{for this kind of}} flying, which allows customization of the throttle-collective mix.|$|E

40|$|Summary. The stabifity of an {{aircraft}} with <b>automatic</b> <b>throttle</b> and elevator controls {{has been investigated}} theoretically using an analogue computer. Throttle application proportional to change in airspeed,, incidence, or rate of pitch may provide damping of the long-period motion, but speed is shown {{to be the most}} suitable variable. The control of {{an aircraft}} having negative static margin is considered and shown to require either the addition of an integral control on the throttle or a combination of throttle and elevator controls. Where it is required to control height by means of the elevator, some aircraft flying under certain conditions can only be adequately stabilised by means of an <b>automatic</b> <b>throttle</b> control. 1.

40|$|Accidents due to engine failure, pilot {{disorientation}} or {{pilot incapacitation}} occur far {{more frequently in}} general aviation than in commercial aviation, yet general aviation aircraft are equipped with less safety-enhancing features than commercial aircraft. This thesis presents the design of an emergency autoland system that includes automatic landing site selection, guidance to the selected landing site and guidance along the final approach, {{in addition to the}} automatic landing capability provided by conventional autoland systems. The proposed system builds on the capability of a general aviation autopilot, flight management system and GPS/WAAS augmented, integrated navigation system. The system provides this automatic landing capability without the use of <b>automatic</b> <b>throttle</b> control and without the use of a radar altimeter, which are essential to conventional autoland systems, but are typically lacking on general aviation aircraft. The design addresses the challenge of no <b>automatic</b> <b>throttle</b> control by utilizing only two simple power settings: cruise power and zero power. The lack of radar altimeter is addressed by appropriate flare planning and placement of the target touchdown point. The approach from the point of autoland initiation, to the approach fix at the the landing site, is performed at cruise power, provided that power is available. The final approach from the approach fix to touchdown, is performed at zero power. Control of the touchdown point location during the final approach is achieved through adjustment of the length of the trajectory, whenever the aircraft’s glide performance deviates from the expected performance. The aircraft’s glide performance is measured online as the aircraft tracks the planned trajectory. The performance of the final design is evaluated in simulation in terms of touchdown point dispersion, sink rate and attitude on touchdown. Avidyne, Inc...|$|E
