5|$|Arsenic {{compounds}} such as sodium <b>arsenite</b> or {{sodium arsenate}} are effective flame retardants for wood {{but have been}} less frequently used due to their toxicity. Antimony trioxide is a flame retardant. Aluminium hydroxide {{has been used as}} a wood-fibre, rubber, plastic and textile flame retardant since the 1890s. Apart from aluminium hydroxide, use of phosphorus based flame-retardants—in the form of, for example, organophosphates—now exceeds that of any of the other main retardant types. These employ boron, antimony or halogenated hydrocarbon compounds.|$|E
5|$|A {{study of}} trace {{elements}} in mushrooms {{in the eastern}} Black Sea Region of Turkey found E.sinuatum to have {{the highest levels of}} copper (64.8 ± 5.9μg/g dried material—insufficient to be toxic) and zinc (198μg/g) recorded. Caps and stalks tested in an area with high levels of mercury in southeastern Poland showed it to bioaccumulate much higher levels of mercury than other fungi. The element was also found in high levels in the humus-rich substrate. Entoloma sinuatum also accumulates arsenic-containing compounds. Of the roughly 40μg of arsenic present per gram of fresh mushroom tissue, about 8% was <b>arsenite</b> and the other 92% was arsenate.|$|E
25|$|Physical, chemical, and {{biological}} {{methods have been}} used to remediate arsenic contaminated water. Bioremediation is said to be cost effective and environmentally friendly Bioremediation of ground water contaminated with arsenic aims to convert <b>arsenite,</b> the toxic form of arsenic to humans, to arsenate. Arsenate (+5 oxidation state) is the dominant form of arsenic in surface water, while <b>arsenite</b> (+3 oxidation state) is the dominant form in hypoxic to anoxic environments. <b>Arsenite</b> is more soluble and mobile than arsenate. Many species of bacteria can transform <b>arsenite</b> to arsenate in anoxic conditions by using <b>arsenite</b> as an electron donor. This is a useful method in ground water remediation. Another bioremediation strategy is to use plants that accumulate arsenic in their tissues via phytoremediation but the disposal of contaminated plant material needs to be considered.|$|E

25|$|Oxidation and {{reduction}} affects {{the migration of}} arsenic in subsurface environments. <b>Arsenite</b> is the most stable soluble form of arsenic in reducing environments and arsenate, which is less mobile than <b>arsenite,</b> is dominant in oxidizing environments at neutral pH. Therefore, arsenic may be more mobile under reducing conditions. The reducing environment is also rich in organic matter which may enhance the solubility of arsenic compounds. As a result, the adsorption of arsenic is reduced and dissolved arsenic accumulates in groundwater. That is why the arsenic content is higher in reducing environments than in oxidizing environments.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{examinations}} {{of the properties}} of bezoars by Gustaf Arrhenius and Andrew A. Benson of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography have shown that they could, when immersed in an arsenic-laced solution, remove the poison. The toxic compounds in arsenic are arsenate and <b>arsenite.</b> Each is acted upon differently, but effectively, by bezoar stones. Arsenate is removed by being exchanged for phosphate in the mineral brushite, a crystalline structure found in the stones. <b>Arsenite</b> is found to bond to sulfur compounds in the protein of degraded hair, which is a key component in bezoars.|$|E

25|$|Some {{species of}} {{bacteria}} catalyze redox transformations of arsenic. Dissimilatory arsenate-respiring prokaryotes (DARP) {{speed up the}} reduction of As(V) to As(III). DARP use As(V) as the electron acceptor of anaerobic respiration and obtain energy to survive. Other organic and inorganic substances can be oxidized in this process. Chemoautotrophic <b>arsenite</b> oxidizers (CAO) and heterotrophic <b>arsenite</b> oxidizers (HAO) convert As(III) into As(V). CAO combine the oxidation of As(III) with the reduction of oxygen or nitrate. They use obtained energy to fix produce organic carbon from CO2. HAO cannot obtain energy from As(III) oxidation. This process may be an arsenic detoxification mechanism for the bacteria.|$|E
25|$|Enzymes and receptors {{that contain}} thiol or {{sulfhydryl}} functional groups are actively targeted by <b>arsenite</b> (III) metabolites. These sulfur-containing compounds are normally glutathione and the amino acid cysteine. <b>Arsenite</b> derivatives generally have higher binding affinity {{compared to the}} arsenate metabolites. These bindings restrict activity of certain metabolic pathways. For example, pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) is inhibited when monomethylarsonous acid (MMAIII) targets the thiol group of the lipoic acid cofactor. PDH is a precursor of acetyl-CoA, thus the inhibition of PDH eventually limits the production of ATP in electron transport chain, {{as well as the}} production of gluconeogenesis intermediates.|$|E
25|$|The natural arsenic {{pollution}} {{occurs because}} aquifer sediments contain organic matter that generates anaerobic {{conditions in the}} aquifer. These conditions result in the microbial dissolution of iron oxides in the sediment and, thus, {{the release of the}} arsenic, normally strongly bound to iron oxides, into the water. As a consequence, arsenic-rich groundwater is often iron-rich, although secondary processes often obscure the association of dissolved arsenic and dissolved iron.. Arsenic is found in groundwater most commonly as the reduced species <b>arsenite</b> and the oxidized species arsenate, being the acute toxicity of <b>arsenite</b> somewhat greater than that of arsenate. Investigations by WHO indicated that 20% of 25,000 boreholes tested in Bangladesh had arsenic concentrations exceeding 50 μg/l.|$|E

40|$|Paris {{green was}} brought into {{prominence}} as an insecticide {{for the first time}} in this country in 1869 and London purple in 1877. Arsenious acid (white arsenic) was successfully used for the destruction of the Canker-worm as early as 1875 and is still frequently recommended for the destruction of insects. During these years the <b>arsenites</b> have arisen to the first rank as insect destroyers. They have been largely experimented with by entomologists and widely used by farmers and fruit-growers, and yet there is much difference of opinion as to the proportions in which each may be safely applied to different plants for the destruction of insects. In fact a serious obstacle in the way of a more free and successful use of the <b>arsenites</b> has been their liability to injure tender foliage; even when applied very dilute. In the experiments of the past two seasons, herein reported, I have given much attention to the finding of some method of applying these poisons so as to prevent injury to foliage without lessening their effectiveness in destroying insect life, and the success met with in this direction has been most gratifying. I also give the results of experiments to determine relative injuries to foliage from applications of the <b>arsenites</b> when freshly mixed and when allowed to stand a few days before being applied; to show the effect upon foliage by adding paste or soap to arsenical mixtures; to show the effects of sun, dew and rain upon foliage treated with arsenical mixtures; to show whether or not it is practical and safe, so far as injury to the plant is concerned, to mix the <b>arsenites</b> with insecticides that kill by external contact; and to show the effects of combining the <b>arsenites</b> with fungicides...|$|R
25|$|Arsenic {{trioxide}} is an amphoteric oxide, and its aqueous {{solutions are}} weakly acidic. Thus, it dissolves readily in alkaline solutions to give <b>arsenites.</b> It is less soluble in acids, although it will dissolve in hydrochloric acid.|$|R
25|$|In 2000, {{bacteria}} {{were discovered}} that employ {{a version of}} photosynthesis {{in the absence of}} oxygen with arsenites as electron donors, producing arsenates (just as ordinary photosynthesis uses water as electron donor, producing molecular oxygen). This may be classified as chemolithoautotrophic <b>arsenite</b> oxidation, for which oxygen is used as the terminal electron acceptor, <b>arsenite</b> is the electron donor, and carbon dioxide is the carbon source. Researchers conjecture that, over the course of history, these photosynthesizing organisms produced the arsenates that allowed the arsenate-reducing bacteria to thrive. One strain PHS-1 has been isolated and is related to the gammaproteobacterium Ectothiorhodospira shaposhnikovii. The mechanism is unknown, but an encoded Arr enzyme may function in reverse to its known homologues.|$|E
25|$|Large scale {{applications}} include its use as {{a precursor}} to forestry products, in colorless glass production, and in electronics.

Bulk arsenic-based compounds sodium <b>arsenite</b> and sodium cacodylate are derived from the trioxide.|$|E

2500|$|Nevertheless, Tarchaneiotes {{soon came}} {{to oppose the}} Palaiologoi, and by 1266 he had emerged {{one of the leaders}} of the <b>Arsenites,</b> the {{supporters}} of the former Patriarch of Constantinople Arsenios Autoreianos, who had excommunicated Michael VIII for usurping the rights and the blinding of his predecessor, John IV Laskaris (r. 1258–1261). The <b>Arsenites</b> refused to recognize the Patriarch's subsequent deposition by the Emperor, and were savagely persecuted. They ipso facto refused to recognize the validity of Andronikos' claim to the throne as well, whom they regarded as [...] "the son of the excommunicated usurper" [...] (Nicol), and who had been crowned by an [...] "illegitimate" [...] patriarch, the anti-Arsenite Joseph I Galesiotes. After the failure of Andronikos' attempt at reconciliation with the <b>Arsenites</b> in the synod of Adramyttion in 1284, John Tarchaneiotes became the leader of the radical faction, while the moderates followed a monk, Hyakinthos. Consequently, Tarchaneiotes spent long periods in exile or in prison. He was banished to Chele in 1289, then placed under house arrest in Constantinople. Released ca. 1296, he was arrested again in 1297 and thrown in the palace prison.|$|R
25|$|Arsenic is a neurotoxin {{commonly}} found concentrated in areas exposed to agricultural runoff, mining, and smelting sites (Martinez-Finley 2011). One {{of the effects}} of arsenic ingestion during the development of the nervous system is the inhibition of neurite growth which can occur both in PNS and the CNS. This neurite growth inhibition can often lead to defects in neural migration, and significant morphological changes of neurons during development,) often leading to neural tube defects in neonates. As a metabolite of arsenic, <b>arsenite</b> is formed after ingestion of arsenic and has shown significant toxicity to neurons within about 24 hours of exposure. The mechanism of this cytotoxicity functions through arsenite-induced increases in intracellular calcium ion levels within neurons, which may subsequently reduce mitochondrial transmembrane potential which activates caspases, triggering cell death. Another known function of <b>arsenite</b> is its destructive nature towards the cytoskeleton through inhibition of neurofilament transport. This is particularly destructive as neurofilaments are used in basic cell structure and support. Lithium administration has shown promise, however, in restoring some of the lost neurofilament motility. Additionally, similar to other neurotoxin treatments, the administration of certain antioxidants has shown some promise in reducing neurotoxicity of ingested arsenic.|$|E
25|$|Due to its similar {{structure}} and properties, pentavalent arsenic metabolites {{are capable of}} replacing the phosphate group of many metabolic pathways. The replacement of phosphate by arsenate is initiated when arsenate reacts with glucose and gluconate in vitro. This reaction generates glucose-6-arsenate and 6-arsenogluconate, which act as analogs for glucose-6-phosphate and 6-phosphogluconate. At the substrate level, during glycolysis, glucose-6-arsenate binds as a substrate to glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and also inhibits hexokinase through negative feedback. Unlike the importance of phosphate in glycolysis, the presence of arsenate restricts the generation of ATP by forming an unstable anhydride product, through the reaction with D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. The anhydride 1-arsenato-3-phospho-D-glycerate generated readily hydrolyzes due to the longer bond length of As-O compared to P-O. At the mitochondrial level, arsenate uncouples the synthesis of ATP by binding to ADP {{in the presence of}} succinate, thus forming an unstable compound that ultimately results in a decrease of ATP net gain. <b>Arsenite</b> (III) metabolites, on the other hand, have limited effect on ATP production in red blood cells.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, in 1298, Andronikos was {{in need of}} his cousin's {{military}} {{talent in}} Asia Minor, where the Turks of Menteshe were encroaching once more on Byzantine territory after having been beaten back in 1293–1295 by Alexios Philanthropenos. Philanthropenos had ended up rising in revolt, supported by the local populace which still largely cherished the memory of the Laskarids of Nicaea and resented the Palaiologoi; to prevent Tarchaneiotes, an avowed <b>Arsenite,</b> from following the same path as his predecessor, Andronikos first extracted from him a personal oath of loyalty and then appointed him commander in the southern and most endangered sector of the front, along the Maeander River. There Tarchaneiotes achieved swift success, not only in the field, but most importantly in reorganizing the local administration and ending corruption which had allowed the alienation of the pronoia estates, originally intended for the upkeep of the army, from their rightful holders. Tarchaneiotes seems to have engaged in a reassessment and redistribution of these lands, which was so successful that it resulted not only in an increase in the numbers of his army, but also in the equipment of a small squadron of ships.|$|E
