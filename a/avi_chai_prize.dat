(Additional information about <b>AVI</b> <b>CHAI</b> can be found at vichai. org.) When it started the spend-down, the Foundation's Board of Trustees sought guidance from scholarly and management literature on how to govern the terminal years of a limited-life foundation.

AJOP was launched with the backing of the <b>AVI</b> <b>CHAI</b> Foundation that provided several million dollars as seed money for AJOP to establish itself and run its first number of annual conventions. At the same time the <b>AVI</b> <b>CHAI</b> Foundation also endowed a new institute at the Ner Israel yeshiva in Baltimore {{known as the}} MAOR Institute that would train its yeshiva graduates to become proficient [...] "outreach rabbis" [...] that would dovetail with AJOP's mission of enhancing the already extant field of outreach workers. Thus Rabbi Weinberg headed both MAOR and AJOP that were both aimed and enhancing the field of reaching out to non-Orthodox Jews.

40|$|Israel’s secular-religious divide {{has long}} been seen {{as one of the}} country’s key {{internal}} issues of conflict. Rather than wait for the Israeli state to work toward solving this intractable problem, numerous private donors and foundations—primarily from the United States—have initiated their own large-scale endeavors in the realm of Israeli pop culture. This essay demonstrates how significant financial investments in Israeli television from the American-based <b>Avi</b> <b>Chai</b> Foundation—by far the biggest player in the realm of Israeli culture—and others have transformed the Israeli cultural landscape, bringing significantly more religious characters and Jewish content to Israeli viewers. I explore the ways in which religion and cultural production converge in this increasingly global era, as transnational NGOs and private foundations deploy the media and arts in order to effect social change...|$|R

Once I started hearing stories from within this department, about mythological rivalries between scholars, stubbornness on an epic scale, eccentric professors who live with an academic mission that is bigger than life itself, even if its topic is radically esoteric, I fell in love with them all, and they became the centre of this story." [...] The film was produced by United King Films and Movie Plus. It received support from the Israel Film Fund, Jerusalem Film Fund and the <b>AVI</b> <b>CHAI</b> Foundation.|$|R
