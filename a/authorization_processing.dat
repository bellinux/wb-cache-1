The systém should improve and modernize work of the employees and the clients {{in the process of}} attending the sales return. The systém will contain two kinds of the users. The client can make sales returns and view data about his sales returns. The employee can edit all data about the sales returns and the clients.

We propose a set of security and performance requirements for this setting and derive an <b>authorization</b> framework distributing <b>processing</b> costs between constrained devices and less constrained back-end servers while keeping message exchanges with the constrained devices at a minimum. As a proof of concept we present performance results from a prototype implementing the device part of the framework. IOTSE...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} paper presents a framework and solution {{for improving the}} efficiency of the <b>authorization</b> <b>processing</b> of credit card transactions using multi-threading and shared-memory pool techniques. Through the use of both techniques, a prototype of a real-time multi-threaded authorization system has been developed with Java platforms to overcome the slow sequential <b>authorization</b> <b>processing</b> of a single threaded model of current credit card authorization systems. Via multi-threading technique, it allows parallel execution of the validation functional units involved during the authorization process of credit card transaction through multiple threads. It also enables a separate thread to be executed in the background of the process to perform data synchronization maintained in the shared-memory pool with the main system database. Shared-memory pool has been used to provide a global point of access to the card information kept in the random access memory. During the authorization process, the respective worker thread performs a binary search to obtain the authentication data from the shared memory instead of the system database to hasten the authorization process of credit card transactions. Performancetesting has been carried out to measure the efficiency of a fixed number of credit card authorization processes running between the single-threaded and the multi-threaded authorization systems in a workstation using similar hardware capabilities. Specially-embedded tools are incorporated in the payment gateway applications to obtain the length of end-to-end execution...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to analyze {{delinquency}} risk factors because this risk component contributed the biggest loss portion in the credit card business in Indonesia. Based on the analysis results, the delinquency risk module prototype would be developed as an enhancement of the existing credit card system using Scoring ware method. Data definition in the Scoring ware based on passed facts that create delinquency risks as the benchmark. The target of this enhancement is the customer profile and transaction <b>authorization</b> <b>processing.</b> Scoring ware results used two system concepts in Information System, that which only create supporting data (Decision Support System-DSS) and that which directly made up decision (Expert System-ES). Customer Profile Scoring ware would behave as a DSS while the customer profile score was in the judgment rating range, but it would behave as an ES while the score over the minimum rating or below the declined rating. Suspected Transaction Scoring ware always behave as an ES, because one transaction must be approved or declined in the response time limit based on the Transaction Anomaly Symptoms. Functional independence enhancement, low investments and minimum management changes were the considerations {{for the implementation of}} Scoring ware module prototype in order to minimize delinquency risk losses. The succeeds of the implementation processes were defamed by precise benchmark customer profiles and transactions, user requirement satisfied, cut off strategy and synergy of the implementation team. ...|$|E
40|$|The use {{of highly}} {{effective}} intravenously infused specialty drugs has increased significantly {{over the past}} two decades as they have led to dramatic improvements in patients' quality-of- life. At Massachusetts General Hospital, these drugs are administered in ten independent outpatient clinics. While some clinics only need to offer sporadic treatments and have low utilization of resources, other clinics find patient access is severely limited due to high utilization, poor scheduling practices, and inadequate staffing. This thesis describes methods to increase patient access to infusion while improving resource utilization. Underlying this improvement is a specially developed scheduling algorithm that smooths chair utilization while permitting flexible, multi-day scheduling. By employing the new scheduling algorithm, the recommended centralized infusion unit will be able to provide more expedient care, offer emergent appointments, avoid unnecessary hospital infusion admissions, and make more efficient use of clinical resources. Adding only two days of flexibility to appointments reduces resource requirements by up to 57 %. Also, the day-to-day variability in patient volume is stabilized. Finally, the centralization of administrative resources ensures efficient prior <b>authorization</b> <b>processing,</b> leading to significant financial savings. by Adam Ryan Marshall. Thesis: M. B.

40|$|In September 2014 {{leadership}} of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation commissioned {{the formation of a}} multidisciplinary process improvement team to improve the timeliness, overall satisfaction, and specialty visit completion rate for the AHF California Managed Care Plans’ outpatient referral and authorization processes. In addition to making targeted improvements in timeliness and satisfaction, the team was also tasked with developing a long-term monitoring strategy to support future improvement in the processing of referrals and authorizations. The Referral Improvement Task Force reviewed best practice models, created and analyzed performance data including turnaround time and patient grievances, and conducted a series of key informant interviews with staff and providers in order to develop and implement targeted strategies. Utilization Management staff in the Managed Care Division assumed additional responsibility for referral and <b>authorization</b> <b>processing,</b> allowing for the division to completely own and streamline the referral and authorization processes for California managed care patients thus addressing delays in the referral and authorization process. Through this process improvement effort, AHF drastically reduced the processing time for outpatient specialty care referrals from an average of 12. 5 days in the pre-intervention period, to an average turnaround time of 1. 5 days during the final phase of the process improvement. Both the mean number of days required to generate an authorization and the mean number of days from physician order to specialty visit decreased significantly with ANOVA and t-test p-values below. 01. This reduction was accomplished through the implementation of several process improvement efforts, including a staff re-organization and process redesign as well as the development of opportunities for referral and care coordination within the electronic medical record...|$|E
