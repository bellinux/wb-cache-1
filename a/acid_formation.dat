500|$|Following {{decontamination}} and {{the institution}} of supportive measures, the next priority is inhibition of further ethylene glycol metabolism using antidotes. The antidotes for ethylene glycol poisoning are ethanol and fomepizole. This antidotal treatment forms the mainstay of management of ethylene glycol poisoning. [...] The toxicity of ethylene glycol comes from its metabolism to glycolic acid and oxalic acid. [...] The goal of pharmacotherapy is to prevent the formation of these metabolites. [...] Ethanol acts by competing with ethylene glycol for alcohol dehydrogenase, the first enzyme in the degradation pathway. [...] Because ethanol has a much higher affinity for alcohol dehydrogenase, about a 100-times greater affinity, it successfully blocks the breakdown of ethylene glycol into glycolaldehyde, which prevents the further degradation. [...] Without oxalic <b>acid</b> <b>formation,</b> the nephrotoxic effects can be avoided, but the ethylene glycol is still present in the body. [...] It is eventually excreted in the urine, but supportive therapy for the CNS depression and metabolic acidosis will be required until the ethylene glycol concentrations fall below toxic limits. [...] Pharmaceutical grade ethanol is usually given intravenously as a 5 or 10% solution in 5% dextrose, {{but it is also}} sometimes given orally {{in the form of a}} strong spirit such as whisky, vodka, or gin.|$|E

For the study, rainwater was harvested directly from the atmosphere between March, July and November 2008 - 2010 and tested for pH to determine spatio-temporal variability. The results revealed that in March pH levels ranged between (5. 1 - 6. 5), with the mean value of pH of 5. 7, July having pH values ranging between 5. 5 - 6. 8, with mean values of 6. 01 and in November, pH values ranging between 5. 4 – 6. 7, with the mean value of 5. 7. The results indicated that atmospheric rainwater is more acidic in the months of March and November than July due to variation in rainfall intensity. The southern parts having very low pH values indicated <b>acid</b> rain <b>formations</b> with worse situation in Ibeno, while the northern parts as control with high pH values in atmospheric rainwater approaching alkalinity. <b>Acid</b> Rain <b>formation</b> was observed to be influenced by locations, rainfall frequency, wind direction and gas flaring by Mobil Oil Producing Company which affects man and his environment.

50|$|Allopurinol is a purine analog; it is a {{structural}} isomer of hypoxanthine (a naturally occurring purine in the body) {{and is an}} inhibitor of the enzyme xanthine oxidase. Xanthine oxidase {{is responsible for the}} successive oxidation of hypoxanthine and xanthine, resulting in the production of uric acid, the product of human purine metabolism. In addition to blocking uric acid production, inhibition of xanthine oxidase causes an increase in hypoxanthine and xanthine. While xanthine cannot be converted to purine ribotides, hypoxanthine can be salvaged to the purine ribotides adenosine and guanosine monophosphates. Increased levels of these ribotides may cause feedback inhibition of amidophosphoribosyl transferase, the first and rate-limiting enzyme of purine biosynthesis. Allopurinol, therefore, decreases uric <b>acid</b> <b>formation</b> and may also inhibit purine synthesis.|$|E
