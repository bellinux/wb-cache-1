5|$|Meanwhile, in the Dunphy family, Dylan (Reid Ewing), Haley's boyfriend, tags {{along on}} the trip, much to Claire's chagrin. However, Phil (Ty Burrell) {{eventually}} convinces her that she should {{try to get to}} know Dylan. She attempts to, but suddenly Dylan proposes to Haley (Sarah Hyland) <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>campfire</b> one night. This causes Claire (Julie Bowen) to instantly say no for Haley, leading to Dylan running away. The families go off and look for him, during which Haley criticizes Claire for interfering and reveals she would not have accepted Dylan's proposal. It is also revealed that Dylan gets a job at the ranch and decides to permanently stay in Wyoming, breaking up with Haley.|$|E
500|$|In 1929, the 17-year-old Como met Roselle Belline at {{a picnic}} on Chartiers Creek that {{attracted}} many young people from the Canonsburg area. Como, who attended the cookout with another girl, did not spot Roselle until everyone was <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>campfire</b> singing and the gathering was coming to a close. When it came Como's turn to sing, he chose [...] "More Than You Know", with his eyes on Roselle for the entire song. The teenage sweethearts were married July 31, 1933. They raised three children, Ronnie, David, and Terri, with traditional, non-show-business values. Because Perry Como believed his professional life and his personal life should be kept separate, he declined repeated interview requests from Edward R. Murrow's Person to Person.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Volcano" [...] {{episode was}} in {{production}} when South Park debuted on August 13, 1997. Comedy Central executives did {{not object to}} most of the content of the episode, but said the scene in which Kyle farted while talking to Stan should have been removed because nothing happened after the fart, and they said it was not funny. Parker and Stone, however, insisted it stay in the episode, and they said the lack of any reaction whatsoever to the fart was what made it funny. During close-ups of Cartman's face while telling the story of Scuzzlebutt <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>campfire,</b> the flames from the fire stop moving. Parker and Stone noticed the consistency error after the episode was filmed, but they did not have enough time to go back and fix it before the broadcast date, so it was left in. A cat featured in the background of one of the outdoor scenes was designed to look exactly like Parker's cat, Jake. The scene in which Ned catches fire was based on an experience Parker had during a Colorado camping trip where he tried to do an [...] "Indian Fire Trick", in which one pours gasoline onto a fire to create large flames. Although nobody caught fire, Parker said the trick misfired and he nearly burned down the forest. After finishing the episode, Parker and Stone realized [...] "Volcano" [...] was about two minutes shorter than the time length required for the episode. In order to add time to the episode, Parker and Stone added the scene with Ned singing the song [...] "Kumbaya" [...] around the fire, as well as the long freeze-frame on a shocked Chef and Mayor McDaniels reacting to the news of the volcano's imminent eruption.|$|E
50|$|As noted above, one of {{her sons}} was field {{chaplain}} Dominee Paul Nel, {{who served in the}} First Anglo-Boer War and supposedly often told stories <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>campfires</b> about his childhood and his beautiful mother Sarie Maré, who died young.|$|R

50|$|Music in Oklahoma {{has been}} played, sung, and {{heard in the}} Indian villages of <b>the</b> {{earliest}} Americans; <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>campfires</b> of <b>the</b> cowboys and traders; in the churches, theaters, and dancehalls of the territorial days; and in concert halls and at music festivals, pow-wows National Guard armories, and school gymnasiums of the present day.|$|R
2500|$|On March 12, 2007, the Colorado Senate {{passed a}} {{resolution}} to make Denver's trademark 1972 hit [...] "Rocky Mountain High" [...] one of the state's two official state songs, sharing duties with its predecessor, [...] "Where the Columbines Grow". The resolution passed 50–11 in the House, defeating an objection by Rep. Debbie Stafford (R-Aurora) that the song reflected drug use, most specifically the line, [...] "friends <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>campfire</b> and everybody's high". Sen. Bob Hagedorn, the Aurora Democrat who sponsored the proposal, defended the song as {{nothing to do with}} drugs, but everything to do with sharing with friends the euphoria of experiencing the beauty of Colorado's mountain vistas. Nancy Todd (D-Aurora) said that [...] "John Denver to me is an icon of what Colorado is." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Yellowstone {{country was}} first [...] "officially" [...] {{explored}} by David E. Folsom, Henry D. Washburn, and Ferdinand Hayden in 1869-71. A myth evolved that {{near the end}} of the Washburn expedition, discussion <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>campfire</b> led several of the members to suggest that the area be set aside for public use and not allow it to be sold to private individuals. This myth was successfully exploited by National Park advocates but eventually was debunked by historians. An early ally in promoting a public reservation was the Northern Pacific Railroad Company. They were seeking major destinations for their route through Montana. In an effort to reduce poaching and other misuse of the park, the U.S. Army established a fort in the area in 1881 and began park protection, establishing a pattern that would be continued by later park rangers.|$|E
2500|$|In 1999, Zemeckis donated $5 million {{towards the}} Robert Zemeckis Center for Digital Arts at USC, a [...] center. When the Center opened in March 2001, Zemeckis {{spoke in a}} panel {{about the future of}} film, {{alongside}} friends Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. Of those (including Spielberg) who clung to celluloid and disparaged the idea of shooting digitally, Zemeckis said, [...] "These guys are the same ones who have been saying that LPs sound better than CDs. You can argue that until you're blue in the face, but I don't know anyone who's still buying vinyl. Film, as we have traditionally thought of it, is going to be different. But the continuum is man's desire to tell stories <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>campfire.</b> The only thing that keeps changing is the campfire." [...] The Robert Zemeckis Center currently hosts many film school classes, much of the Interactive Media Division, and Trojan Vision, USC's student television station, which has been voted the number one college television station in the country.|$|E
60|$|The {{clatter of}} the horse's hoofs {{on the rocks}} soon {{attracted}} the attention of those <b>around</b> <b>the</b> distant <b>campfire.</b> <b>The</b> three persons came forward, to see who was coming.|$|R
50|$|Another {{account is}} that the song dates from the First Anglo-Boer War (1880-1881). When Ella de Wet, wife of General Louis Botha's {{military}} attaché Nicolaas Jacobus de Wet came to the battle front to see her husband she often played on the piano while the nearby burghers sang songs from the Cavendish album. The burghers supposedly wanted to honour their field chaplain Dominee Paul Nel, who often told stories <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>campfires</b> about his childhood and his beautiful mother Sarie Maré, who died young.|$|R
60|$|All {{thoughts}} of sleep were {{now out of}} the question, and <b>the</b> three sat <b>around</b> <b>the</b> tiny <b>campfire,</b> discussing <b>the</b> situation. With the first streak of dawn Barringford set to work skinning the buffalo, and Dave assisted.|$|R
60|$|Around and <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>campfire</b> the two circled, until Jerry came up.|$|E
60|$|The crowd <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>campfire</b> {{were eating}} supper and talking in such low tones that Snap {{could not make}} out what was said. They seemed to be in the best of spirits, as if {{something}} had happened to please them greatly.|$|E
60|$|They {{had covered}} {{less than a}} quarter of a mile when they came in sight of a campfire, well-hidden between the rough rocks back from the water’s edge. <b>Around</b> <b>the</b> <b>campfire</b> were huddled the forms of several men, evidently sailors.|$|E
50|$|The Woi Wurrung tribes {{would have}} been aware of the Europeans, through the close {{relationship}} to the Bunwurrung people of the coast who came into contact with the Baudin expedition on the French ship Le Naturaliste during 1801, and then the British settlement at Sullivan Bay in 1803, near modern-day Sorrento, Victoria. William Buckley, a convict, escaped from this abortive settlement and lived for more than 30 years with the Wada wurrung people before approaching John Batman's party in 1835. He told George Langhorne in 1836:I frequently entertained them (the Wada wurrung), when sitting <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>campfires,</b> with accounts of the English People, Houses, Ships - great guns etc. to which accounts they would listen with great attention - and express much astonishment.|$|R
60|$|He hesitated, {{then turned}} {{over on his}} hands and knees and crawled to the opening of the tent and peered <b>around</b> outside. <b>The</b> <b>campfire</b> had burned rather low, so that objects a short {{distance}} away were indistinct. He saw that the horses were huddled together and had their heads turned toward a clump of bushes at one side of the shelter.|$|R

60|$|His cries soon reached those <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>campfire,</b> and a grand rush {{was made}} to the water's edge. By this time Snap had rounded {{the point of the}} cove and was rowing as rapidly as {{possible}} in the direction where the raft lay.|$|E
6000|$|That evening {{there was}} rude merriment <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>campfire.</b> Snap Naab buzzed on his jews'-harp and sang. He stirred {{some of the}} younger braves to dancing, and they stamped and swung their arms, singing, [...] "hoya-heeya-howya," [...] as they moved {{in and out of the}} firelight.|$|E
60|$|Werner and {{his cronies}} had passed into the woods, and now were making their way down a {{hillside}} into a hollow where they had built a fair-sized campfire. As the Rovers and their chums came closer they saw the three sitting <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>campfire</b> and evidently getting ready to have a midday lunch.|$|E
40|$|The ghost story [...] in all {{its forms}} [...] has haunted humans since the first tales of the strange and inexplicable were told <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>campfires</b> of pre-history. Such stories explore {{collective}} ideas of death and the afterlife, the eeriness of certain places, and the awe that is felt {{in the presence of the}} Unknown. Pictures of Lily and Other Stories contains three examples of the genre, each written in a different sub-genre. 2 ̆ 2 Money, 2 ̆ 2 the story of an impoverished college student who gets a housesitting job that is more perilous than it first appears, owes much to the haunted house stories of British master M. R. James, while 2 ̆ 2 Under the House 2 ̆ 2 parallels the haunted love stories of Edith Wharton. Finally, the novella 2 ̆ 2 Pictures of Lily 2 ̆ 2 explores gothic themes in the tradition of Shirley Jackson and Oscar Wilde...|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> Texas <b>Campfire</b> Tapes is <b>the</b> {{first album}} by American singer and {{songwriter}} Michelle Shocked. It was originally a recording {{made on a}} Sony Walkman of an impromptu set performed by Shocked <b>around</b> <b>the</b> eponymous <b>campfire.</b> It was then released by Mercury Records in 1986. It was reissued in 2003 as a two-CD set called Texas Campfire Takes by Shocked's own label, Mighty Sound. Another version of [...] "Fogtown" [...] appears as a [...] "hidden track" [...] on Shocked's breakthrough album Short Sharp Shocked (1988), where she is backed by the hardcore punk band MDC.|$|R
60|$|At last Merwell and Haskers {{were within}} fifty feet of those <b>around</b> <b>the</b> dying <b>campfire.</b> They {{had been talking}} in a low voice, but now both were silent, as {{if this had been}} agreed upon. Merwell was {{slightly}} in advance and he pointed to the outfit of the Morr crowd. This lay between some rocks and covered with a rubber cloth, so that the eatables might not be spoiled by the weather.|$|R
60|$|The {{club members}} went into {{camp on the}} edge of a {{beautiful}} lake. Here they had rousing good times swimming, boating and <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>campfire.</b> They fell in with a mysterious old man known as The Hermit of Triangle Island. Nobody knew his real name or where he came from until the propounding of a riddle solved these perplexing questions.|$|E
60|$|It {{was very}} homelike and cheerful, {{gathering}} <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>campfire,</b> {{and all of}} the boys took a hand at preparing the supper which consisted of fried fish, baked potatoes, sandwiches, cake and coffee. They took their time over the meal, and did not finish until after eight o'clock. Then they sat around for an hour discussing their plans and telling stories.|$|E
6000|$|By {{the time}} the shelter was in {{readiness}} for the night, the supper was cooked, and all sat <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>campfire</b> to partake of the meal. A certain part of it had been slightly burnt, but to this nobody paid attention, although {{it would have been}} noticed if this had occurred at home or at a hotel. But camping out makes such a difference, doesn't it, boys? ...|$|E
5000|$|On New Year’s Eve, 1968, Watkins was <b>around</b> <b>the</b> Family <b>campfire</b> at Myers Ranch when Manson {{delivered}} the Helter Skelter prophecy. For some time, Manson had been predicting blacks would rise up in rebellion in America's cities.

More than that, the musical group wanted Manson and the Family to create an album of their own, to trigger the predicted events: ...|$|R
60|$|The {{weather was}} cold and bleak, and each night <b>the</b> boys {{assembled}} <b>around</b> <b>the</b> big <b>campfire</b> to discuss <b>the</b> situation. They reported the country full of people eager to get away. Everybody seemed studying the problem {{of what to do}} and how to do it. Some were for going to the head-waters of the Pelly, others advocated the Nisutlin, and others still thought it a good plan to prospect on the head-waters of the Tooya, from which excellent reports were coming in.|$|R
60|$|Dave {{watched the}} waving light for some time, as it {{rose and fell}} on the bosom of the ocean, but could learn nothing {{concerning}} the craft that showed it. Then he continued to look <b>around</b> <b>the</b> island. No <b>campfire</b> was to be located, and finally he rejoined Merwell.|$|R
60|$|It seemed {{my eyelids}} had {{scarcely}} touched when Jones's exasperating, yet stimulating, yell aroused me. Day was breaking. The moon and stars shone with wan luster. A white, snowy frost silvered the forest. Old Moze had curled close beside me, {{and now he}} gazed at me reproachfully and shivered. Lawson came hustling in with the horses. Jim busied himself <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>campfire.</b> My fingers nearly froze while I saddled my horse.|$|E
6000|$|... “Let it pass, Shadow!” cried Dave, not wishing the story-teller to {{take the}} matter too seriously. “You can tell all the stories you please <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>campfire.</b> But just now let us push on {{as fast as we}} can. I want a chance to do some rabbit and {{squirrel}} hunting, and you know we’ve got to be back on time, or we’ll have trouble with Doctor Clay as well as with old Haskers.” ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{next day}} was the Fourth of July, and such a day! It rained all the forenoon, cold, persistent, drizzling rain. We hung <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>campfire</b> waiting for some let-up to the incessant downpour. We {{discussed}} the situation. I said: [...] "Now, if the stream in the cañon below us runs to the left, {{it will be the}} east fork of the Iskoot, and we will then be within about one hundred miles of Glenora. If it runs to the right, Heaven only knows where we are." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Udon" [...] {{is named}} after a Japanese noodle soup, which Nakao cooked when he joined {{sessions}} in Zeeland for [...] "Viva Remix" [...] in 2000. After eating the meal and drinking tequila <b>around</b> <b>the</b> outside <b>campfire,</b> <b>the</b> band returned to the studio where Klaus picked up a guitar and began playing a riff, announcing into the microphone [...] "now Nakao will {{tell us how to}} cook udon". Nakao sung the lyrics to [...] "Udon" [...] without any prior preparation, and with a few alterations this is how the song appears on the album. [...] "Kittelback Symphony" [...] {{is named after}} Kittelbach, a small river in Unterrath where Dinger grew up.|$|R
60|$|Inside of half an {{hour the}} lunch was under way. <b>Around</b> <b>the</b> roaring <b>campfire</b> sat <b>the</b> students, some on {{convenient}} rocks and others on a fallen tree that chanced to be handy. They had brought with them several kinds of sandwiches, besides hard-boiled eggs, crackers, cheese, some cake, and the coffee, with a small bottle of cream and some sugar. They also had some potatoes for roasting, and though these got partly burned, all declared them “fine” or “elegant,”—which shows what outdoor air will do for one’s appetite.|$|R
50|$|Later, {{as the two}} Listers sit <b>around</b> a <b>campfire,</b> <b>the</b> {{duplicate}} {{pulls out}} {{the hand of the}} duplicate Kryten holding a piece of paper from his belongings.

Soon, Starbug has left with the wrong Lister while the other is left buried on the planet.|$|R
