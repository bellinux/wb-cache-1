In addition, many employees <b>are</b> <b>choosing</b> <b>to</b> combine a health savings account with higher deductible plans, making the impact of the ACA difficult to determine precisely.|$|E

500|$|Upon {{the release}} of [...] "Roar", many accused Perry of copying Sara Bareilles' [...] "Brave".

2500|$|Recently, in North America and Europe specifically, {{there have}} been drastic changes in the nature and {{character}} of relationships. [...] Fewer people <b>are</b> <b>choosing</b> <b>to</b> get married and instead are assuming relationships similar to marriage, without the title. [...] The divorce rates are rising and types of family development are changing. [...] For example, more couples <b>are</b> <b>choosing</b> <b>to</b> remain childless or have children without being married. [...] These transformations {{may be attributed to}} the changing labor markets, marital tax laws along with new and different value sets and lifestyles. [...] In societies where marriage is no longer uncritically perceived as a monogamous lifelong relationship, getting married seems a more dubious enterprise. [...] Marriage, sex, and childbearing, which have been a tightly bound package for much of the 20th century, are no longer so inextricably linked.|$|E

2500|$|In early 2010, the Swedish {{publication}} The Local published {{series of}} articles about the growing antisemitism in Malmö, Sweden.

Many feel that the community and local politicians have shown a lack of understanding for how the city’s Jewish residents have been marginalized.” He also added that [...] "right now many Jews in Malmö are really concerned about the situation here and don’t believe they have a future here.” The Local also reported that Jewish cemeteries and synagogues have repeatedly been defaced with antisemitic graffiti, and a chapel at another Jewish burial site in Malmö was firebombed in 2009.|$|E
2500|$|The Sauternes wine region {{comprises}} five communes— Barsac, Sauternes, Bommes, Fargues and Preignac. While {{all five}} communes {{are permitted to}} use the name Sauternes, the Barsac region is also permitted to label their wines under the Barsac appellation. The Barsac region {{is located on the}} west bank of the Ciron river where the tributary meets [...] the Garonne. The area sits on an alluvial plain with sandy and limy soils. In general, Barsac wine is distinguished from other Sauternes in being drier with a lighter body; currently more Barsac producers <b>are</b> <b>choosing</b> <b>to</b> promote the wines under their own name. In years when the noble rot does not develop, Sauternes producers will often make dry white wines under the generic Bordeaux AOC. To qualify for the Sauternes label, the wines must have a minimum 13% alcohol level and pass a tasting exam where the wines need to taste noticeably sweet. There is no regulation on the exact amount of residual sugar that the wine needs to have.|$|E

In 2009 the Malmö police received reports of 79 anti-Semitic incidents, double the number of the previous year (2008).

2500|$|Lifestyles for rising {{professionals}} in Detroit reflect {{those of other}} major cities. A 2007 study found that Detroit's new downtown residents are predominantly young professionals (57 percent are ages 25–34, 45 percent have bachelor's degrees, 34 percent have a master's or professional degree). This dynamic is luring many younger residents to the downtown area. Some <b>are</b> <b>choosing</b> <b>to</b> live in the grandiose mansions of Grosse Pointe {{in order to be}} closer to the urban scene. The [...] river east development is a plan investing billions of dollars in a new mixed use residential, commercial, and retail space for downtown Detroit to serve the people where they work and live. To spearhead the development, Michigan created the William G. Milliken State Park and Harbor downtown along the Detroit International Riverfront. In 2007, downtown Detroit was named among the best big city neighborhoods in which to retire by CNN Money Magazine editors. In 2008, Troy, Michigan ranked as the fourth most affordable U.S. city with a median household income of 78,800.
