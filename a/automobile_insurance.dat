5|$|For {{a second}} DUI {{conviction}} in a 10-year period, irrespective of BAC, {{there is a}} fine of $500–$1,000, 2–90 days imprisonment, a 2-year license suspension, an <b>automobile</b> <b>insurance</b> surcharge of $1,000 a year for 3 years, and installation of an ignition interlock device for 1 to 3 years after license restoration. A person who has 3 or more DUI convictions and a gap of less than 10 years since the last conviction incurs a fine of $1,000, 6 months imprisonment, a 10-year license suspension, an <b>automobile</b> <b>insurance</b> surcharge of $1,500 a year for 3 years, and installation of an ignition interlock device for 1 to 3 years after license restoration.

5|$|It {{is illegal}} in New Jersey {{to have an}} open {{container}} of alcohol in the passenger portion of a private automobile, but open bottles of alcohol may be transported {{in the trunk of}} a car, and consumption of alcohol on a bus, train, taxi, limousine, or boat is permitted. The penalty for having an open container of alcohol in a car is $200 fine for the first offense, and a $250 fine or 10 days of community service for repeat violations. The state Motor Vehicle Commission does not impose license points for open container convictions, but some <b>automobile</b> <b>insurance</b> companies impose a surcharge. New Jersey's law on open containers in motor vehicles is compliant with the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), a federal act passed in 1998 which reduces the highway funding of states that do not prohibit open containers in passenger areas of automobiles.|$|E

25|$|In July 2007, The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) {{released}} a report presenting {{the results of a}} study concerning credit-based insurance scores in <b>automobile</b> <b>insurance.</b> The study found that these scores are effective predictors of risk. It also showed that African-Americans and Hispanics are substantially overrepresented in the lowest credit scores, and substantially underrepresented in the highest, while Caucasians and Asians are more evenly spread across the scores. The credit scores were also found to predict risk within each of the ethnic groups, leading the FTC to conclude that the scoring models are not solely proxies for redlining. The FTC indicated little data was available to evaluate benefit of insurance scores to consumers. The report was disputed by representatives of the Consumer Federation of America, the National Fair Housing Alliance, the National Consumer Law Center, and the Center for Economic Justice, for relying on data provided by the insurance industry.|$|E

25|$|Liability {{insurance}} {{is a very}} broad superset that covers legal claims against the insured. Many types of insurance include an aspect of liability coverage. For example, a homeowner's insurance policy will normally include liability coverage which protects the insured {{in the event of}} a claim brought by someone who slips and falls on the property; <b>automobile</b> <b>insurance</b> also includes an aspect of liability insurance that indemnifies against the harm that a crashing car can cause to others' lives, health, or property. The protection offered by a liability insurance policy is twofold: a legal defense {{in the event of a}} lawsuit commenced against the policyholder and indemnification (payment on behalf of the insured) with respect to a settlement or court verdict. Liability policies typically cover only the negligence of the insured, and will not apply to results of wilful or intentional acts by the insured.|$|E

This included four half-centuries, although he was never able to progress past 60 runs in a single innings. During the season, Ramshaw also played two matches in the one-day Federated <b>Automobile</b> <b>Insurance</b> Cup, serving as wicket-keeper in the match against New South Wales in the absence of regular keeper Darren Berry. He did not play at all the following season, but returned for the 1993–94 season, which was to be his last at state level. Displaced from his previous role as an opener, Ramshaw played as a middle-order batsman, scoring 502 runs at an average of 29.52 from nine matches. This again included four half-centuries, with his highest first-class score an innings of 85 runs against New South Wales. Late in the season, when regular captain Dean Jones was on international duty, Ramshaw served as captain of Victoria for three Shield matches and two one-day matches. After the conclusion of his playing career, he served as assistant coach of Tasmania for a period in the early 2000s, as well as co-coach of Western Australia's under-19 team during the 2003–04 season, with Doug Harris.|$|E

States require individuals to buy <b>automobile</b> <b>insurance</b> (implicitly suggesting the unavoidable comparison to health insurance and the fairness of the applying the same principle to health insurance as well)." [...] Sotomayor concluded with the incisive rhetorical flourish in the Court directed at the attorneys: [...] "Do you think that if some states decided not to impose an insurance requirement that the federal government would be without power to legislate and require every individual to buy car insurance?"
