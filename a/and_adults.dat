40|$|Microarray {{transcriptome}} {{analyses of}} fetal mouse liver did not detect circadian expression rhythms of clock genes or clockcontrolled genes, although some rhythmic transcripts that were likely not driven by endogenous cellular clocks were identified. This finding reveals a key {{distinction between the}} circadian oscillators in fetal <b>and</b> <b>adult</b> mouse livers. Thus, in this study, the transcriptomes of fetal <b>and</b> <b>adult</b> livers were systematically compared to identify differences in the gene expression profiles between these two developmental stages. Approximately 1000 transcripts were differentially enriched between the fetal <b>and</b> <b>adult</b> livers. These transcripts represent genes with cellular functions characteristic of distinct developmental stages. Clock genes were also differentially expressed between the fetal <b>and</b> <b>adult</b> livers. Developmental differences in liver gene expression might {{have contributed to the}} differences in oscillation status and functional states of the cellular circadian clock between fetal <b>and</b> <b>adult</b> livers...|$|R

40|$|Hematopoietic {{stem and}} {{progenitor}} cells (HSPCs) in the fetus <b>and</b> <b>adult</b> possess distinct molecular landscapes that regulate cell fate and change their susceptibility to initiation and progression of hematopoietic malignancies. Here, we applied in-depth quantitative proteomics to comprehensively describe {{and compare the}} proteome of fetal <b>and</b> <b>adult</b> HSPCs. Our data uncover a striking difference in complexity of the cellular proteomes, with more diverse adult-specific HSPC proteomic signatures. The differential protein content in fetal <b>and</b> <b>adult</b> HSPCs indicate distinct metabolic profiles and protein complex stoichiometries. Additionally, adult characteristics include an arsenal of proteins linked to viral and bacterial defense, as well as protection against ROS-induced protein oxidation. Further analyses show that interferon α, as well as Neutrophil elastase, has distinct functional effects in fetal <b>and</b> <b>adult</b> HSPCs. This study provides a rich resource aimed toward an enhanced mechanistic understanding of normal and malignant hematopoiesis during fetal <b>and</b> <b>adult</b> life...|$|R
