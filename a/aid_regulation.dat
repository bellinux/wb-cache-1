5000|$|Much of the {{scientific}} controversy about Marx's concept of character masks centres on his unique dialectical approach to analyzing the forms and structure of social relations in the capitalist system: in Das Kapital, he had dealt with persons (or [...] "economic characters") only insofar as they personified or symbolized - often in a reified way - economic categories, roles, functions and interests (see above). According to Marx, the capitalist system functioned as a [...] "system", precisely because the bourgeois relations of production and trade, including property rights, were imposed on people whether they liked it or not. They had to act and conform in a specific way to survive and prosper. As the mass of capital produced grew larger, and markets expanded, these bourgeois relations spontaneously reproduced themselves on a larger and larger scale, be it {{with the assistance of}} state <b>aid,</b> <b>regulation</b> or repression. However, many authors have argued that this approach leaves many facets of capitalist social relations unexplained.

40|$|Exploitation of municipal-owned land may be {{done through}} {{distribution}} of land allocations. A land allocation means the sole right for developers {{to negotiate with}} municipalities regarding how a specific area of municipal-owned land should be exploited. The aim during negotiations is to formulate a detailed development plan that both parties are satisfied with, normally leading to the land area being transferred from the municipality to the developer. Swedish regulations stipulate that municipalities shall adopt policies to clarify the playing field for developers {{in order for them}} to foresee how to receive land allocations. However, there are no sanctions when municipalities fail to comply with their own policies. Moreover, decisions concerning land allocations can only be challenged through legality procedures, meaning that decisions cannot be changed – only repealed. This thesis examines the Swedish land allocation system’s relation to competition law and economic efficiency: In particular, it’s relation to EU state <b>aid</b> <b>regulations</b> and the transaction costs theory. The main purpose of the thesis is to examine whether the system could be competitively problematic and/or economically efficient. The thesis also suggests improvement in order to reach the ideal of having a system that means little risk for municipalities to breach state <b>aid</b> <b>regulations</b> while still being economically efficient. The majority of land allocations are performed through direct allocations, where only one developer gets the chance to negotiate with the municipality regarding how to exploit the land. Another method that is almost as commonly used is tender allocations that allows for many developers to bid in order to receive the land allocation. The predominant use of direct allocation, and the loose framework regulating how land allocations should be performed, means that municipalities run a risk of breaching EU state <b>aid</b> <b>regulations</b> in various situations. A situation that is competitively problematic can, however, be economically efficient. The thesis concludes that Sweden does not have an efficient system to prevent unallowable state aid in land allocation procedures. Suggestions for improvement include stronger incitements for actors to challenge land allocation decisions in court, a clearer regulation regarding what situations that allow for municipalities to perform direct allocations and a stricter framework regarding how to perform land allocations to avoid elements of unallowable state aid...|$|R

They nominated Horace Greeley for president and B. Gratz Brown for vice president. The Republican convention opened on June 5 in Philadelphia and the delegates were in an enthusiastic mood. For the first time in party convention history, telegraph operators communicated minute-by-minute proceedings to the nation. The Republican platform supported amnesty for former Confederates, low tariffs, civil service reform, Grant's Indian Peace policy, and civil rights for African Americans. Grant was unanimously renominated on the second day, to the loud cheers of the convention crowd. Wilson was popular among Republicans for the vice presidential nomination, with an appealing rags-to-riches story that included his rise from indentured servant to owner and operator of a successful shoe making business. On the first ballot, he defeated Colfax, who by then had become an active candidate by renouncing his 1870 pledge and informing his supporters that he would accept renomination if it was offered. The Republicans believed Wilson's nomination, as a politician of integrity coming from the anti-slavery movement, would outflank the anti-corruption argument of the Liberal Republicans, who counted Sumner among their members. Both Grant and his new running mate Wilson were idealized by Republican posters, which depicted Grant [...] "the Galena Tanner" [...] and Wilson [...] "the Natick Shoemaker" [...] carrying tools and wearing workmen's aprons. (Grant's father operated a tanning and leather goods manufacturing business, and before the Civil War Grant had clerked in his father's Galena, Illinois store.) In July, in an unprecedented political party fusion influenced by Schurz, the Democrats adopted the Liberal Republican platform and endorsed that party's candidates. Grant's personal popularity proved insurmountable in the general election, and Grant and Wilson went on to overwhelmingly defeat Greeley and Brown in both the popular and electoral college votes. Wilson's nomination for Vice President had been intended to strengthen the Republican ticket, and was seen as a success.|$|E

40|$|Background: Activation induced deaminase (AID) mediates class switch {{recombination}} {{and somatic}} hypermutation of immunoglobulin (Ig) genes in germinal centre B cells. In order to regulate its specific activity {{and as a}} means to keep offtarget mutations low, several mechanisms have evolved, including binding to specific cofactors, phosphorylation and destabilization of nuclear AID protein. Although ubiquitination at lysine residues of AID is recognized as an essential step in initiating degradation of nuclear AID, any functional relevance of lysine modifications has remained elusive. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we report functional implications of lysine modifications of the human AID protein by generating a panel of lysine to arginine mutants of AID and assessment of their catalytic class switch activity. We found that only mutation of Lys 22 to Arg resulted in a significant reduction of class switching to IgG 1 in transfected primary mouse B cells. This decrease in activity was neither reflected in reduced hypermutation of Ig genes in AID-mutant transfected DT 40 B cell lines nor recapitulated in bacterial deamination assays, pointing to involvement of post-translational modification of Lys 22 for AID activity in B cells. Conclusions/Significance: Our results imply that lysine modification may represent a novel level of <b>AID</b> <b>regulation</b> and tha...|$|E

In 21 cases, presence of AID is constantly associated with high expression of the complete form of the Pax- 5 gene (Pax- 5 a) and lower expression of the Id- 2 and prdm- 1 transcripts. In 33 cases, the absence of AID expression and CSR is associated with a reduction of Pax- 5 a and the appearance of a spliced form with a deletion in exon 8 (Pax- 5 /Delta-Ex 8).

40|$|Activation Induced Deaminase (AID) {{belongs to}} the protein family of DNA deaminases, which {{catalyse}} the deamination of the cytosine residues in single stranded DNA, resulting {{in the formation of}} deoxy-uracils. The enzymatic activity of AID is required for the immunoglobulin gene modifications by class switch recombination (CSR), somatic hypermutation (SHM) and gene conversion (iGC). While being essential for antibody diversification, the activity of AID can be harmful for the organism due to its direct mutagenic activities and induction of genomic instability. This thesis investigates <b>AID</b> <b>regulation</b> both, on the level of gene expression and its interaction partners, and the DNA repair pathways triggered by AIDmediated DNA deamination. Firstly, I have identified estrogen and progesterone as regulators of AID expression. This is achieved via direct binding of estrogen and progesterone receptors to AID promoter. Estrogen leads to an induction of AID expression and increase in AID-mediated downstream pathways – SHM, CSR as well as oncogenic translocations between Ig and c-myc loci. In contrast, progesterone results in a decrease in AID expression and an attenuation of its downstream pathways. Secondly, by generating DT 40 cell lines with endogenously tagged AID, we used co-immunoprecipitation and subsequent mass spectrometry for identifying proteins that form a complex with AID in the cytoplasm, nucleoplasm and chromatin. The results of this approach gave us possible insight into the mechanistic process of AID-mediated DNA deamination in vivo, suggesting that chromatin bound AID resides in a complex with elongating RNA polymerase II. Thirdly, by expressing AID in meiotic recombination deficient fission yeast and nematode, we have established that a meiotic cell can process a base mismatch, using the base excision repair machinery, to give rise to meiotic recombination. This suggests that meiotic cells can process lesions other than Spo- 11 induced DSBs for recombination. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigates individuals 2 ̆ 7 college {{choice and}} dropout {{behavior in the}} market for vocational training, specifically in response to a recently proposed financial <b>aid</b> <b>regulation.</b> Vocational training is {{an important component of the}} postsecondary education arena and has been promoted by political leaders as an option for high school graduates who do not wish to attend traditional 4 year colleges. The major players in this market are for-profit colleges and community colleges, both of which offer open admission and mainly confer certificates and associate degrees. This paper evaluates the implications of a regulation proposed by the Obama administration to restrict federal student financial aid to for-profit colleges. Specifically, I examine the effect of this policy change on students 2 ̆ 7 college enrollment and college retention. To that end, I develop and estimate a two-period discrete choice model of differentiated products, where the products are vocational colleges. In the first period, forward-looking and risk-neutral individuals choose a vocational college to attend or the outside option of no college. In the second period, those who are enrolled in a college decide whether or not to drop out of school upon learning more about their postgraduation outcomes. I estimate this model using Generalized Methods of Moments with school-level data collected from the Department of Education. Model estimates reveal heterogeneous preference across demographic groups and several differentiating factors between for-profit colleges and community colleges. I find that for-profit college enrollment is highly responsive to federal student financial aid availability and that most of those who attend for-profit colleges would rather forgo college altogether than substitute to community colleges. Counterfactual simulations reveal that the proposed regulation would be successful at steering students away from for-profit colleges, as intended by policy makers, but an unintended consequence of the regulation is that 77...|$|E
40|$|The {{biological}} {{behavior of}} {{chronic lymphocytic leukemia}} and small lymphocytic lymphoma is unpredictable. Nonetheless, non-mutated IgV(H) gene rearrangement, ATM (11 q 22 - 23) and p 53 (17 p 13) deletion are recognized as unfavorable prognosticators in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The mRNA expression of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), an enzyme indispensable for somatic hypermutation processes, was claimed to be predictive of non-mutated chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells in blood. Here, we evaluated AID protein expression compared with known molecular and immunohistochemical prognostic indicators in 71 chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma patients using a tissue microarray approach. We found AID heterogeneously expressed in tumor cells as shown by colocalization analysis for CD 5 and CD 23. Ki- 67 positive paraimmunoblasts of the proliferation centers displayed the highest expression. This observation is reflected by a significant association of AID positivity with a high proliferation rate (P= 0. 012). ATM deletion was detected in 10 % (6 / 63) of patients and p 53 deletion in 19 % (13 / 67) of patients. Moreover, both ATM (P= 0. 002) and p 53 deletion (P= 0. 004) {{were significantly associated with}} AID. IgV(H) gene mutation was seen in 45 % (27 / 60) of patients. Twenty-five percent (17 / 69) of patients with AID-positive chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma displayed a shorter survival than AID-negative chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma patients (61 vs 130 months, P= 0. 001). Although there was a trend, we could not show an association with the IgV(H) gene mutation status. Taken together, our study shows that AID expression is an indicator of an unfavorable prognosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma patients, although it is not a surrogate marker for the IgV(H) status. Furthermore, the microenvironment of proliferation centers seems to influence <b>AID</b> <b>regulation</b> and might be an initiating factor in its transformatio...|$|E
