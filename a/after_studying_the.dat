5|$|Honoré de Balzac {{was drawn}} to a {{diversity}} of interests throughout his life, from business to politics. <b>After</b> <b>studying</b> <b>the</b> law for three years, he wrote a number of potboiler novels under various pseudonyms. He also lost large sums of borrowed money in the publishing trade, attempting to capitalize on cheap editions of classical works. By 1828 he owed his mother 50,000 francs.|$|E
5|$|In 1900 and 1901, Harvard College Observatory {{director}} William Henry Pickering led two {{searches for}} trans-Neptunian planets. The first was begun by Danish astronomer Hans Emil Lau who, <b>after</b> <b>studying</b> <b>the</b> {{data on the}} orbit of Uranus from 1690 to 1895, concluded that one trans-Neptunian planet alone could {{not account for the}} discrepancies in its orbit, and postulated the position of two planets he believed were responsible. The second was launched when Gabriel Dallet suggested that a single trans-Neptunian planet lying at 47AU could account for the motion of Uranus. Pickering agreed to examine plates for any suspected planets. In neither case were any found.|$|E
5|$|When the United States {{entered the}} war in 1917, General John J. Pershing sent Brice P. Disque, a former army captain, to the Pacific Northwest to {{determine}} if local labor issues within the forest products industry could be quickly resolved. Disque met with mill owners {{and representatives of the}} Industrial Workers of the World, the union that was trying to organize loggers and sawmill workers in the Pacific Northwest. <b>After</b> <b>studying</b> <b>the</b> situation for several months, Disque determined that the long-standing labor management dispute could not be resolved without direct intervention by the army. Based on Disque's report, the United States Army Signal Corps was given the job of reorganizing the forest products industry in the Pacific Northwest to support United States war production.|$|E

5|$|Nasser was {{informed}} of the British–American withdrawal via a news statement while aboard a plane returning to Cairo from Belgrade, and took great offense. Although ideas for nationalizing the Suez Canal were in the offing after the UK agreed to withdraw its military from Egypt in 1954 (the last British troops left on 13 June 1956), journalist Mohamed Hassanein Heikal asserts that Nasser made the final decision to nationalize the waterway between 19 and 20 July. Nasser himself would later state that he decided on 23 July, <b>after</b> <b>studying</b> <b>the</b> issue and deliberating {{with some of his}} advisers from the dissolved RCC, namely Boghdadi and technical specialist Mahmoud Younis, beginning on 21 July. The rest of the RCC's former members were {{informed of the}} decision on 24 July, while the bulk of the cabinet was unaware of the nationalization scheme until hours before Nasser publicly announced it. According to Ramadan, Nasser's decision to nationalize the canal was a solitary decision, taken without consultation.|$|E
5|$|There was, however, {{a bitter}} {{consequence}} of the awards, rooted in Howe's official dispatch to the Admiralty concerning the battle, which according to some accounts was actually written by Curtis. Howe had appended a list to his report containing the names of officers whom he believed merited special reward for their part in the battle. The list included Vice-Admirals Graves and Hood, Rear-Admirals Bowyer, Gardner, and Pasley, and Captains Seymour, Pakenham, Cranfield-Berkeley, Gambier, John Harvey, Payne, Henry Harvey, Pringle, Duckworth, Elphinstone, Nichols, and Hope. Also mentioned were Lieutenants Monkton and Donnelly. The list had omitted a number of officers who {{had served in the}} battle, and the justice of their omission was a highly controversial issue in the Navy. Rear-Admiral Caldwell was the sole British flag officer present not to receive a hereditary honour, although he was promoted to Vice-Admiral on 4 July (as were Bowyer and Gardner). <b>After</b> <b>studying</b> <b>the</b> ship's logs and reports of the battle, the Admiralty minted a medal to be awarded to the living captains on the list only (although Captain William Parker of HMS Audacious was awarded one as well). The captains excluded from the list were furious, and the furor from this selective commendation lasted years: in 1795 Vice-Admiral Caldwell quit the service in anger as a result, while Cuthbert Collingwood, flag captain of Barfleur, refused all awards for future service until the Glorious First of June medal was presented to him as well. He eventually received it after the Battle of Cape St Vincent in 1797. Over five decades later the battle was among the actions recognised by a clasp attached to the Naval General Service Medal, awarded upon application to all British participants still living in 1847.|$|E

The reporters also managed to track down dozens of additional investigative records not included in the National Archives.|$|E
25|$|The modern {{understanding}} of the condition began with the analysis of patients who exhibited sensitivity to primaquine. The discovery of G6PD deficiency relied heavily upon the testing of prisoner volunteers at Illinois State Penitentiary, a type of study which today is considered unethical and cannot be performed. When some prisoners were given the drug primaquine, some developed hemolytic anemia but others did not. <b>After</b> <b>studying</b> <b>the</b> mechanism through Cr51 testing, it was conclusively shown that the hemolytic effect of primaquine was due to an intrinsic defect of erythrocytes.|$|E

What probably perked up the ears of the Spanish king about Basco's plan to make the Philippine colony financially self-sufficient, thus removing a huge financial burden from the Spanish crown. The King of Spain issued a royal decree on February 9, 1780 setting in motion Basco's plan.|$|E
25|$|History {{professor}} Antonio Santosuosso puts forth {{an opinion}} on Charles, Tours, and the subsequent campaigns against Rahman's son in 736–737, presenting that these later defeats of invading Muslim armies were {{at least as important}} as Tours in their defense of Western Christendom and the preservation of Western monasticism, the monasteries of which were the centers of learning which ultimately led Europe out of her Middle Ages. He also makes an argument, <b>after</b> <b>studying</b> <b>the</b> Arab histories of the period, that these were clearly armies of invasion, sent by the Caliph not just to avenge Tours, but to begin the end of Christian Europe and bring it into the Caliphate.|$|E
25|$|In late March 1966 in Michigan, {{two days}} of mass UFO {{sightings}} were reported, and received significant publicity. <b>After</b> <b>studying</b> <b>the</b> reports, Hynek offered a provisional hypothesis {{for some of the}} sightings: a few of about 100 witnesses had mistaken swamp gas for something more spectacular. At the press conference where he made his announcement, Hynek repeatedly and strenuously stated that swamp gas was a plausible explanation for only a portion of the Michigan UFO reports, and certainly not for UFO reports in general. But much to his chagrin, Hynek's qualifications of his hypothesis were largely overlooked, and the term swamp gas was repeated ad infinitum in relation to UFO reports. The explanation was subject to national derision.|$|E
