40|$|The {{requirement}} of CUL 1 for Arabidopsis embryogenesis suggests that Skp 1 –CUL 1 –F-box protein (SCF) complexes play important roles during embryo development. Among the 21 Arabidopsis Skp 1 -like genes (<b>ASKs),</b> {{it is unknown}} which <b>ASK</b> gene(s) is essential for embryo development. In this study, we demonstrate a vital role for <b>ASK</b> 1 and <b>ASK</b> 2 in Arabidopsis embryogenesis and postembryonic development through analysis of the <b>ask</b> 1 <b>ask</b> 2 double mutant. Our detailed analysis indicates that the double mutations in both <b>ASK</b> 1 and <b>ASK</b> 2 affect cell division and cell expansion/elongation and cause a developmental delay during embryogenesis and lethality in seedling growth. The expression patterns of <b>ASK</b> 1 and <b>ASK</b> 2 were examined further and found {{to be consistent with}} their roles in embryogenesis and seedling development. We propose that mutations in <b>ASK</b> 1 and <b>ASK</b> 2 abolish all of the <b>ASK</b> 1 - and <b>ASK</b> 2 -based SCF and non-SCF complexes, resulting in alteration of gene expression and leading to defects in growth and development...|$|R

40|$|TNF-α {{activates}} <b>ASK</b> 1 {{in part by}} dissociating 14 - 3 - 3 from apoptosis signal–regulating kinase 1 (<b>ASK</b> 1). In {{the present}} study, we identified a novel Ras GTPase-activating protein (Ras-GAP) as an <b>ASK</b> 1 -interacting protein (AIP 1). AIP 1 binds to the C-terminal domain of <b>ASK</b> 1 via a lysine-rich cluster within the N-terminal C 2 domain. AIP 1 exists in a closed form through an intramolecular interaction between the N-terminus and the C-terminus, and TNF-α induces unfolding of AIP 1 leading to association of AIP 1 with <b>ASK</b> 1. Thus, the N-terminus of AIP 1 containing the C 2 and GAP domains constitutively binds to <b>ASK</b> 1 and facilitates the release of 14 - 3 - 3 from <b>ASK</b> 1. In contrast to 14 - 3 - 3, AIP 1 binds preferentially to dephosphorylated <b>ASK</b> 1. Recruited AIP 1 enhances <b>ASK</b> 1 -induced JNK activation, and the <b>ASK</b> 1 binding and the GAP activity of AIP 1 are critical for AIP 1 -enhanced <b>ASK</b> 1 activation. Furthermore, TNF-induced <b>ASK</b> 1 /JNK activation is significantly blunted in cells where AIP 1 is knocked down by RNA interference. These data suggest that AIP 1 mediates TNF-α–induced <b>ASK</b> 1 activation by facilitating dissociation of inhibitor 14 - 3 - 3 from <b>ASK</b> 1, a novel mechanism by which TNF-α activates <b>ASK</b> 1...|$|R

40|$|Apoptosis signal-regulated kinase- 1 (<b>Ask</b> 1) lies {{upstream}} {{of a major}} redox-sensitive pathway {{leading to}} the activation of Jun NH 2 -terminal kinase (JNK) and the induction of apoptosis. We found that cell exposure to H 2 O 2 caused the rapid oxidation of <b>Ask</b> 1, leading to its multimerization through the formation of interchain disulfide bonds. Oxidized <b>Ask</b> 1 was fully reduced within minutes after induction by H 2 O 2. During this reduction, the thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase thioredoxin- 1 (Trx 1) became covalently associated with <b>Ask</b> 1. Overexpression of Trx 1 accelerated the reduction of <b>Ask</b> 1, and a redox-inactive mutant of Trx 1 (C 35 S) remained trapped with <b>Ask</b> 1, blocking its reduction. Preventing the oxidation of <b>Ask</b> 1 by either overexpressing Trx 1 or using an <b>Ask</b> 1 mutant in which the sensitive cysteines were mutated (<b>Ask</b> 1 -ΔCys) impaired the activation of JNK and the induction of apoptosis while having little effect on <b>Ask</b> 1 activation. These results indicate that <b>Ask</b> 1 oxidation is required at a step subsequent to activation for signaling downstream of <b>Ask</b> 1 after H 2 O 2 treatment...|$|R
40|$|Previously we {{have shown}} that {{tyrosine}} 718 of <b>ASK</b> 1 when phosphorylated is critical for SOCS 1 binding and SOCS 1 -mediated degradation of <b>ASK</b> 1. However, the kinase and phosphatase responsible for phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of <b>ASK</b> 1 at Tyr- 718 are unknown. In this study, we identified JAK 2 and SHP 2 as a Tyr- 718 -specific kinase and phosphatase, respectively. Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) induced degradation of <b>ASK</b> 1 in normal but not in SOCS 1 -KO endothelial cells (EC). IFN-γ-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of <b>ASK</b> 1 at Tyr- 718 was blocked by a JAK 2 -specific inhibitor. IFN-γ enhanced the association between JAK 2 and <b>ASK</b> 1, and the <b>ASK</b> 1 -JAK 2 complex was labile and was stabilized by the proteasomal inhibitor MG 132. Furthermore, JAK 2, but not JAK 1, directly bound to and phosphorylated <b>ASK</b> 1 at Tyr- 718, leading to an enhanced association of <b>ASK</b> 1 with SOCS 1 and subsequent <b>ASK</b> 1 degradation. Next, we showed that overexpression of the SH 2 -containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase- 2 (SHP 2) augmented, whereas a phosphatase-inactive mutant of SHP 2 inhibited, TNF-induced <b>ASK</b> 1 dephosphorylation. SHP 2 associated with <b>ASK</b> 1 in response to tumor necrosis factor in EC. An SHP- 2 substrate-trapping mutant formed a complex with tyrosine-phosphorylated <b>ASK</b> 1, suggesting that <b>ASK</b> 1 is a direct SHP 2 substrate. Moreover, SHP 2 wild type, but not a catalytically inactive mutant, dissociated SOCS 1 from <b>ASK</b> 1. IFN-γ-induced <b>ASK</b> 1 Tyr(P) - 718 was enhanced in mouse EC deficient in SHP 2 (SHP 2 -KO). In contrast, tumor necrosis factor-induced dephosphorylation of <b>ASK</b> 1 at Tyr(P) - 718 and activation of <b>ASK</b> 1 -JNK signaling, as well as EC apoptosis, are significantly reduced in SHP 2 -KO EC. Our data suggest that JAK 2 -SOCS 1 and SHP 2 reciprocally regulate <b>ASK</b> 1 phosphorylation and stability in response to cytokines...|$|R
