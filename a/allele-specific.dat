5|$|Gene {{silencing}} aims {{to reduce}} {{the production of the}} mutant protein, since HD is caused by a single dominant gene encoding a toxic protein. Gene silencing experiments in mouse models have shown that when the expression of mHTT is reduced, symptoms improve. Safety of non-allele specific RNAi and ASO gene silencing has now been demonstrated in mice and the large, human-like brains of primates. <b>Allele-specific</b> silencing attempts to silence mutant HTT while leaving wild-type HTT untouched. One way of accomplishing this is to identify polymorphisms present on only one allele and produce gene silencing drugs that target polymorphisms in only the mutant allele. The first 'gene silencing' trial involving human HD patients began in 2015, testing the safety of IONIS-HTTRx, produced by Ionis Pharmaceuticals and led by UCL Institute of Neurology. Mutant huntingtin was detected and quantified {{for the first time in}} cerebrospinal fluid from Huntington's disease mutation-carriers in 2015 using a novel 'single-molecule counting' immunoassay, providing a direct way to assess whether huntingtin-lowering treatments are achieving the desired effect. Similarly, gene splicing techniques are being looked at to try to repair a genome with the erroneous gene that causes HD, using tools such as CRISPR/Cas9.|$|E
25|$|A further {{improvement}} to {{this technique}} was recently described by Wong et al., which uses <b>allele-specific</b> primers that incorporate single-nucleotide polymorphisms into {{the sequence of}} the sequencing primer, thus allowing for separate analysis of maternal and paternal alleles. This technique is of particular usefulness for genomic imprinting analysis.|$|E
25|$|Fluorescent probes {{are used}} to monitor the {{accumulation}} of amplicons produced throughout the PCR process. Thus, increase in reporter fluorescent signal {{is proportional to the}} number of amplicons generated. The appropriate real-time PCR protocol is designed according to the mutation or genotype to be detected. Point mutations are analysed with qualitative real-time PCR with the use of <b>allele-specific</b> probes. Insertions and deletions are analyzed by dosage measurements using quantitative real-time PCR.|$|E
25|$|Transcriptomic {{strategies}} have seen broad application across diverse areas of biomedical research, including disease diagnosis and profiling. RNA-Seq approaches have {{allowed for the}} large-scale identification of transcriptional start sites, uncovered alternative promoter usage and novel splicing alterations. These regulatory elements are important in human disease, and therefore, defining such variants {{is crucial to the}} interpretation of disease-association studies. RNA-Seq can also identify disease-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), <b>allele-specific</b> expression and gene fusions contributing to our understanding of disease causal variants.|$|E
25|$|<b>Allele-specific</b> PCR: a {{diagnostic}} or cloning technique based on single-nucleotide variations (SNVs {{not to be}} confused with SNPs) (single-base differences in a patient). It requires prior knowledge of a DNA sequence, including differences between alleles, and uses primers whose 3' ends encompass the SNV (base pair buffer around SNV usually incorporated). PCR amplification under stringent conditions is much less efficient in the presence of a mismatch between template and primer, so successful amplification with an SNP-specific primer signals presence of the specific SNP in a sequence. See SNP genotyping for more information.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} found that introgressed Neanderthal genes exhibit cis-regulatory effects in modern humans, {{contributing}} to the genomic complexity and phenotype variation of modern humans. Looking at heterozygous individuals (carrying both Neanderthal and modern human versions of a gene), the <b>allele-specific</b> expression of introgressed Neanderthal alleles was found to be significantly lower in the brain and testes relative to other tissues. In the brain, this was most pronounced at the cerebellum and basal ganglia. This downregulation suggests that modern humans and Neanderthals possibly experienced a relative higher rate of divergence in these specific tissues.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time as the {{generation}} of the gynogenetic and androgenetic embryos discussed above, mouse embryos were also being generated that contained only small regions that were derived from either a paternal or maternal source. The generation of a series of such uniparental disomies, which together span the entire genome, allowed the creation of an imprinting map. Those regions which when inherited from a single parent result in a discernible phenotype contain imprinted gene(s). Further research showed that within these regions there were often numerous imprinted genes. Around 80% of imprinted genes are found in clusters such as these, called imprinted domains, suggesting a level of co-ordinated control. More recently, genome-wide screens to identify imprinted genes have used differential expression of mRNAs from control fetuses and parthenogenetic or androgenetic fetuses hybridized to expression arrays, <b>allele-specific</b> gene expression using SNP genotyping arrays, transcriptome sequencing, and in silico prediction pipelines.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the basic}} Invader assay, a FEN called {{cleavase}} {{is combined with}} two specific oligonucleotide probes, that together with the target DNA, can form a tripartite structure recognized by cleavase. [...] The first probe, called the Invader oligonucleotide is complementary to the 3’ end of the target DNA. The last base of the Invader oligonucleotide is a non-matching base that overlaps the SNP nucleotide in the target DNA. The second probe is an <b>allele-specific</b> probe which is complementary to the 5’ end of the target DNA, but also extends past the 3’ side of the SNP nucleotide. The <b>allele-specific</b> probe will contain a base complementary to the SNP nucleotide. If the target DNA contains the desired allele, the Invader and <b>allele-specific</b> probes will bind to the target DNA forming the tripartite structure. This structure is recognized by cleavase, which will cleave and release the 3’ end of the <b>allele-specific</b> probe. If the SNP nucleotide in the target DNA is not complementary <b>allele-specific</b> probe, the correct tripartite structure is not formed and no cleavage occurs. The Invader assay is usually coupled with fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) system to detect the cleavage event. In this setup, a quencher molecule {{is attached to the}} 3’ end and a fluorophore is attached to the 5’ end of the <b>allele-specific</b> probe. If cleavage occurs, the fluorophore will be separated from the quencher molecule generating a detectable signal.|$|E

50|$|Dynamic <b>allele-specific</b> {{hybridization}} (DASH) genotyping {{takes advantage}} of the differences in the melting temperature in DNA that results from the instability of mismatched base pairs. The process can be vastly automated and encompasses a few simple principles.|$|E
50|$|For {{a smaller}} number of SNPs, a uniplex assay like KASP (Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR) are used. KASP is a homogenous, fluorescence-based {{genotyping}} technology that is based on <b>allele-specific</b> oligo extension and fluorescence resonance energy transfer for signal generation.|$|E
50|$|Several {{applications}} {{have been}} developed that interrogate SNPs by hybridizing complementary DNA probes to the SNP site. The challenge {{of this approach is}} reducing cross-hybridization between the <b>allele-specific</b> probes. This challenge is generally overcome by manipulating the hybridization stringency conditions.|$|E
50|$|Another {{potential}} therapeutic approach involves <b>allele-specific</b> RNA interference that targets mutated mRNA for degradation {{while preserving}} normal ACVR1 gene expression.

5000|$|In {{the second}} round of PCR, the {{complementary}} strand to the <b>allele-specific</b> forward primer is generated when the common reverse primer binds to the amplicon formed {{in the first round of}} PCR. Finally, the thermocycling of the PCR reaction continues, starting the third portion of the KASP method. A fluorescently labeled primer is present in the master mix where it is quenched due to hybridization with its complementary part that has a quencher at the end. The fluorescent labeled primer complements the tail sequence of the <b>allele-specific</b> forward primer, allowing for elongation to occur. This occurs multiple times throughout the thermocycling settings and the fluorescent signalling becomes stronger as more fluorescent primers are used in the amplification process. Fluorescent tags normally used are FAM and HEX ...|$|E
50|$|Taq DNA polymerase’s 5’-nuclease {{activity}} {{is used in}} the TaqMan assay for SNP genotyping. The TaqMan assay is performed concurrently with a PCR reaction and the results can be read in real-time as the PCR reaction proceeds (McGuigan & Ralston 2002). The assay requires forward and reverse PCR primers that will amplify a region that includes the SNP polymorphic site. Allele discrimination is achieved using FRET combined with one or two <b>allele-specific</b> probes that hybridize to the SNP polymorphic site. The probes will have a fluorophore linked to their 5’ end and a quencher molecule linked to their 3’ end. While the probe is intact, the quencher will remain in close proximity to the fluorophore, eliminating the fluorophore’s signal. During the PCR amplification step, if the <b>allele-specific</b> probe is perfectly complementary to the SNP allele, it will bind to the target DNA strand and then get degraded by 5’-nuclease activity of the Taq polymerase as it extends the DNA from the PCR primers. The degradation of the probe results in the separation of the fluorophore from the quencher molecule, generating a detectable signal. If the <b>allele-specific</b> probe is not perfectly complementary, it will have lower melting temperature and not bind as efficiently. This prevents the nuclease from acting on the probe (McGuigan & Ralston 2002).|$|E
50|$|Allelic {{differences}} in mRNA splicing {{are likely to}} be a common and important source of phenotypic diversity at the molecular level, in addition to their contribution to genetic disease susceptibility. Indeed, genome-wide studies in humans have identified a range of genes that are subject to <b>allele-specific</b> splicing.|$|E

50|$|Phasing is {{the process}} of {{identifying}} the individual complement of homologous chromosomes. Methods for phasing include pedigree analysis, <b>allele-specific</b> PCR, linkage emulsion PCR haplotype analysis, polony PCR, sperm typing, bacterial artificial chromosome cloning, construction of somatic cell hybrids, atomic force microscopy, among others. Haplotype phasing can also be achieved through computational inference methods.|$|E
50|$|An <b>allele-specific</b> {{oligonucleotide}} (ASO) {{is a short}} {{piece of}} synthetic DNA complementary to the sequence of a variable target DNA. It acts as a probe {{for the presence of}} the target in a Southern blot assay or, more commonly, in the simpler Dot blot assay. It is a common tool used in genetic testing, forensics, and Molecular Biology research.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are three}} {{components}} {{that are critical}} to the KASP assay: 1) a purified DNA sample, 2) two <b>allele-specific</b> forward primers, and 3) a common reverse primer. A minimum of 5-10 ng of the extracted DNA sample are required for the method to function properly. The DNA sample is purified by adding a mixture of chemicals to the buffer solution. [...] In {{the first round of}} PCR, a KASP primer mix that contains the two <b>allele-specific</b> forward primers and the single reverse primer is added to the mixture. The specific nature of the forward primers allows for the primer to bind solely at the SNP of interest, allowing DNA polymerase to lay down the rest of the complementary nucleotides. During this time, the common reverse primer begins to lay down complementary nucleotides on the opposite strand of DNA. This ends the first round of PCR.|$|E
50|$|The first {{described}} occurrence of polar overdominance in sheep was shown after finding that a mutant Callipyge allele must be {{inherited from the}} father to cause a condition called muscle hypertrophy. Muscle hypertrophy in the offspring is caused {{by an increase in}} the size and proportion of muscle muscle fibers, namely the fast-twitch muscle fibers. This increase is generally located in the hind quarters and torso. Muscle hypertrophy only manifests itself in the offspring approximately one month after birth. Polar overdominance shows evidence of an imprinted locus displayed as the difference between the expression of heterozygote phenotypes in a parent-of-origin type fashion. It was discovered that a single nucleotide polymorphism in the DLK1-DIO3 imprinted gene cluster affects the gene expression of paternal <b>allele-specific</b> genes and several maternal <b>allele-specific</b> long noncoding RNA and microRNA. Ectopic expression of Delta-like 1 homologue (DLK1) and the gene 11/Retrotransposon-like 1 (PEG11/RTL1) which are Paternally expressed proteins in skeletal muscle are a hallmark of these mutant individuals.|$|E

5000|$|Normally PCR primers {{are chosen}} from an {{invariant}} {{part of the}} genome, and {{might be used to}} amplify a polymorphic area between them. In <b>Allele-specific</b> PCR the opposite is done. At least one of the primers is chosen from a polymorphic area, with the mutations located at (or near) its 3'-end. Under stringent conditions, a mismatched primer will not initiate replication, whereas a matched primer will. The appearance of an amplification product therefore indicates the genotype. (For more information, see SNP genotyping.) ...|$|E
50|$|Amyotrophic lateral {{sclerosis}} (ALS), {{also called}} Lou Gehrig's disease, is a {{motor neuron disease}} that affects the brain and spinal cord. The disease causes motor neurons to degenerate, which eventually leads to their death. Hundreds of mutations in the Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) {{have been found to}} cause ALS. Gene silencing has been used to knock down the SOD1 mutant that is characteristic of ALS. In specific, siRNA molecules have been successfully used to target the SOD1 mutant gene and reduce its expression through <b>allele-specific</b> gene silencing.|$|E

These techniques extract the <b>allele-specific</b> signal intensities from genotyping data and use that to generate CNV results. These techniques have higher precision and resolution than traditional techniques such as G-banded karyotypic analyses, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH).|$|E

An <b>allele-specific</b> oligonucleotide is then added {{in the presence of a}} molecule that fluoresces when bound to double-stranded DNA. The intensity is then measured as temperature is increased until the melting temperature (Tm) can be determined. A SNP will result in a lower than expected Tm.|$|E

5000|$|DNA ligase catalyzes the {{ligation}} of the 3' {{end of a}} DNA fragment to the 5' end of a directly adjacent DNA fragment. This mechanism can be used {{to interrogate}} a SNP by hybridizing two probes directly over the SNP polymorphic site, whereby ligation can occur if the probes are identical to the target DNA. In the oligonucleotide ligase assay, two probes are designed; an <b>allele-specific</b> probe which hybridizes to the target DNA so that its 3' base is situated directly over the SNP nucleotide and a second probe that hybridizes the template upstream (downstream in the complementary strand) of the SNP polymorphic site providing a 5' end for the ligation reaction. If the <b>allele-specific</b> probe matches the target DNA, it will fully hybridize to the target DNA and ligation can occur. Ligation does not generally occur {{in the presence of a}} mismatched 3' base. Ligated or unligated products can be detected by gel electrophoresis, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry or by capillary electrophoresis for large-scale applications. [...] With appropriate sequences and tags on the oligonucleotides, high-throughput sequence data can be generated from the ligated products and genotypes determined (Curry et al., 2012). The use of large numbers of sample indexes allows high-throughput sequence data on hundreds of SNPs in thousands of samples to be generated in a small portion of a high-throughput sequencing run. This is a massive genotyping by sequencing technology (MGST).|$|E
5000|$|Sex-specific {{effects can}} be due to parental {{imprinting}} a process that results in <b>allele-specific</b> differences in transcription, DNA methylation, and DNA replication timing. Imprinting is an important process in human development, and its deregulation can cause certain defined disease states of other imprinted human disease loci. The establishment of parental imprints occurs during gametogenesis as homologous DNA passes through sperm or egg; subsequently during embryogenesis and into adulthood, alleles of imprinted genes are maintained in two [...] "conformational"/epigenetic states: paternal or maternal. Thus, genomic imprints template their own replication, are heritable, can be identified by molecular analysis, and serve as markers of the parental origin of genomic regions.|$|E
