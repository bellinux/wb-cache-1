6000|$|This odd {{suicide of}} one {{branch of the}} realists may serve {{to remind us of}} the fact which {{underlies}} a very dusty conflict of the critics. All representative art, which can be said to live, is both realistic and ideal; and the realism about which we quarrel is a matter purely of externals. It is no especial cultus of nature and veracity, but a mere whim of veering fashion, that has made us turn our back upon the larger, more various, and more romantic art of yore. A photographic exactitude in dialogue is now the exclusive fashion; but even in the ablest hands it tells us no more--I think it even tells us less--than Molière, wielding his <b>artificial</b> <b>medium,</b> has told to us and to all time of Alceste or Orgon, Dorine or Chrysale. The historical novel is forgotten. Yet truth to the conditions of man's nature and the conditions of man's life, the truth of literary art, is free of the ages. It may be told us in a carpet comedy, in a novel of adventure, or a fairy tale. The scene may be pitched in London, on the sea-coast of Bohemia, or away on the mountains of Beulah. And by an odd and luminous accident, if there is any page of literature calculated to awake the envy of M. Zola, it must be that [...] "Troilus and Cressida" [...] which Shakespeare, in a spasm of unmanly anger with the world, grafted on the heroic story of the siege of Troy.|$|E

5000|$|Faience {{has been}} defined as the first high {{technology}} ceramic, to emphasize its status as an <b>artificial</b> <b>medium,</b> rendering it effectively a precious stone. Egyptian faience is a non-clay based ceramic composed of crushed quartz or sand, with small amounts of calcite lime and a mixture of alkalis, displaying surface vitrification due to the soda lime silica glaze often containing copper pigments to create a bright blue-green luster. While in most instances domestic ores seem to have provided the bulk of the mineral pigments, evidence suggests that during periods of prosperity, raw materials not available locally, such as lead and copper, were imported. Plant ash, from [...] "halophyte" [...] (salt-tolerant) plants typical of dry and sea areas, was the major source of alkali until the Ptolemaic Period, when natron-based alkalis almost completely replaced the previous source. Although the chemical composition of faience materials varies over time and according to the status of the workshop, also as a cause of change of accessibility of raw materials, the material constitution of the glaze is at all times consistent with the generally accepted version of faience glazing.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Mycoplasma mycoides {{subspecies}} mycoides Small Colony (MmmSC) is the causative {{agent of}} Contagious Bovine Pleuropneumonia (CBPP), {{a disease of}} substantial economic importance in sub-Saharan Africa. Failure of vaccination to curtail spread of this disease has led to calls for evaluation {{of the role of}} antimicrobials in CBPP control. Three major classes of antimicrobial are effective against mycoplasmas, namely tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones and macrolides. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to determine the effector kinetics of oxytetracycline, danofloxacin and tulathromycin against two MmmSC field strains in <b>artificial</b> <b>medium</b> and adult bovine serum. METHODS: Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined for oxytetracycline, danofloxacin and tulathromycin against MmmSC strains B 237 and Tan 8 using a macrodilution technique, and time-kill curves were constructed for various multiples of the MIC over a 24 hour period in <b>artificial</b> <b>medium</b> and serum. Data were fitted to sigmoid E(max) models to obtain 24 hour-area under curve/MIC ratios for mycoplasmastasis and, where appropriate, for mycoplasmacidal activity and virtual mycoplasmal elimination. RESULTS: Minimum inhibitory concentrations against B 237 were 20 -fold higher, 2 -fold higher and approximately 330 -fold lower in serum than in <b>artificial</b> <b>medium</b> for oxytetracycline, danofloxacin and tulathromycin, respectively. Such differences were mirrored in experiments using Tan 8. Oxytetracycline was mycoplasmastatic against both strains in both matrices. Danofloxacin elicited mycoplasmacidal activity against B 237 and virtual elimination of Tan 8; similar maximum antimycoplasmal effects were observed in <b>artificial</b> <b>medium</b> and serum. Tulathromycin effected virtual elimination of B 237 but was mycoplasmastatic against Tan 8 in <b>artificial</b> <b>medium.</b> However, this drug was mycoplasmastatic against both strains in the more physiologically relevant matrix of serum. CONCLUSIONS: Oxytetracycline, danofloxacin and tulathromycin are all suitable candidates for further investigation as potential treatments for CBPP.
