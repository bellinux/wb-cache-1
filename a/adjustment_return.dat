40|$|Measures of {{productivity}} growth typically {{include in the}} Productivity "residual" the impacts of subequilibrium from fixity of factors, costs of <b>adjustment,</b> <b>returns</b> to scale and markups. This paper proposes a general two part framework for adjusting the residual measure to take these impacts into account. Errors computing the weights on output and quasi-fixed input growth in traditional measures are first corrected for both primal- and Cost-side measures. Then the deviation of revenues from costs is used to decompose the full primal measure to identify the differential influences of technical change, utilization fluctuations, scale economies and price margins. Use of the framework is illustrated empirically for the U. S.,, Japanese and Canadian manufacturing sectors, using an econometric model that allows explicit incorporation and measurement of these influences.

We use metadata from 33 studies of 10 transition economies covering a period from 1975 through 2002. Our empirical model {{is an attempt to}} account for cross-section and over-time variation in rates of return {{as a function of the}} timing, speed, and volatility of reform processes as well as estimation methods used and sample characteristics. Our principal aim is to investigate the relative strength of two hypotheses: (1) the speed of economic transformation from planning to market represent the relaxation of legal, regulatory, and institutional constraints on wage-setting behavior, leading directly to <b>adjustment</b> <b>returns</b> to schooling to market rates; 2) the rapid increase in returns to schooling during the early reform period reflects the ability of highly-educated individuals to respond to changing opportunities in a disequilibrium situation. We find that both the speed of reforms and the degree of economic disequilibrium as reflected in macroeconomic volatility help to explain cross-country differences in the time paths of the returns to schooling. We report the systematic effects of sample characteristics, estimation methods, and model specifications on estimated returns to schooling. returns to schooling, skills, speed of reforms, meta-analysis, transition, Central and Eastern Europe, China, Russia. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} some considerations {{about the}} use of adequate statistical techniques in the framework of the neuroelectromagnetic brain mapping. With the use of advanced EEG/MEG recording setup involving hundred of sensors, the issue of the protection against the type I errors that could occur during the execution of hundred of univariate statistical tests, has gained interest. In the present experiment, we investigated the EEG signals from a mannequin acting as an experimental subject. Data have been collected while performing a neuromarketing experiment and analyzed with state of the art computational tools adopted in specialized literature. Results showed that electric data from the mannequin's head presents statistical significant differences in power spectra during the visualization of a commercial advertising when compared to the power spectra gathered during a documentary, when no adjustments were made on the alpha level of the multiple univariate tests performed. The use of the Bonferroni or Bonferroni Holm <b>adjustments</b> <b>returned</b> correctly no differences between the signals gathered from the mannequin in the two experimental conditions. An partial sample of recently published literature on different neuroscience journals suggested that at least the 30 % of the papers do not use statistical protection for the type I errors. While the occurrence of type I errors could be easily managed with appropriate statistical techniques, the use of such techniques is still not so largely adopted in the literature.

Palmer's first {{claim of}} {{restoring}} hearing to Harvey Lillard, {{there has been}} controversy about whether a link actually could exist between the spinal <b>adjustment</b> and <b>return</b> of hearing. Critics asserted that a spinal adjustment cannot affect certain areas– like the brain– because the spinal nerves do not extend into the encephalon. Years later, V.

40|$|It {{has been}} a decade since changes in diurnal {{temperature}} range (DTR) globally have been assessed in a stand-alone data analysis. The present study takes advantage of substantively improved basic data holdings arising from the International Surface Temperature Initiative’s databank effort and applies the National Centers for Environmental Information’s automated pairwise homogeneity assessment algorithm to reassess DTR records. It is found that breakpoints are more prevalent in DTR than other temperature elements and that the resulting adjustments have a broader distribution. This strongly implies {{that there is an}} overarching tendency, across the global meteorological networks, for nonclimatic artifacts to impart either random or anticorrelated rather than correlated biases in maximum and minimum temperature series. Future homogenization efforts would likely benefit from simultaneous consideration of DTR and maximum and minimum temperatures, in addition to average temperatures. Estimates of change in DTR are relatively insensitive to whether adjustments are calculated directly or inferred from <b>adjustments</b> <b>returned</b> for the maximum and minimum temperature series. The homogenized series exhibit a reduction in DTR since the midtwentieth century globally (- 0. 044 K/decade). Adjustments serve to approximately halve the long-term global reduction in DTR in the basic “raw” data. Most of the estimated DTR reduction occurred over 1960 – 1980. In several regions DTR has apparently increased over 1979 – 2012, while globally it has exhibited very little change (- 0. 016 K/decade). Estimated changes in DTR are an order of magnitude smaller than in maximum and minimum temperatures, which have both been increasing rapidly on multidecadal timescales (0. 186 K/decade and 0. 236 K/decade, respectively, since the midtwentieth century) ...|$|R

Unlike previous studies we re-estimate unemployment rates so that these alternative rates are comparable to those of the OECD member countries.

Our empirical results indicate that unemployment elasticity is low and yet the velocity of <b>adjustment</b> to <b>return</b> to the initial point is rather high. We interpret these findings as being the result of two characteristics of Mexico’s labor market: (i) high labor regulation (which includes labor intervention in hiring-firing decisions), and (ii) the existence of a large informal sector and low enforcement of labor regulation. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Risk <b>adjustment</b> of <b>returns</b> and {{performance}} measurement {{is of great}} interest to financial institutions around the world today, because management board of a certain financial institution wants to know what risks their institution is bearing while achieving a certain level of returns. Separate measures of risk and return are combined in a single ratio through a risk adjustment process and corresponding measures that are analysed in the paper. All risk adjustment measures are divided into two separate classes in the paper according to normality of returns of market variables or portfolios criterion. The analysis revealed the following conclusions: when the normality assumption holds, the generalized Sharpe rule is superior to other risk adjustment measures from the class; when we cannot rely on the normality assumption, then Farinelli-Tibiletti ratio is superior to other asymmetrical risk-adjustment measures because it not only accounts for deviations of financial data from normal distribution, but enables to asses the impact of different preferences of an investor towards profits and/or losses expected...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} and estimate long-run relationships among M 1, prices, output and interest rates, with a view to determining if there is a stable relationship that can be interpreted as long-run money demand. The paper uses a maximum-likelihood multiple- equation cointegration technique, developed by Johansen, to fit a system of equations to the data. One finding is that long-run, but not short-run, unitary price elasticity is easily accepted, while the income elasticity is close to one-half. The coefficients on the deviation of money from its long-run equilibrium in the vector error-correction model imply that when M 1 is above its long-run demand, money will decrease and prices increase to restore long-run equilibrium. The effects of the deviation on output and interest rates are insignificant, pointing to the weak exogeneity of these variables. The implication of the results is that all the <b>adjustment</b> to <b>return</b> the economy to monetary equilibrium comes from fluctuations in money and prices. However, this does not preclude the possibility that changes in the stock of money may have short-run real effects. Indeed, the results suggest that changes in M 1 lead short-term changes in output. ...|$|R
