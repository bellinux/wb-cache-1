5|$|The Swedish {{automotive}} startup Uniti Sweden AB {{has been}} working on an electric city car entirely designed to be sustainable. The CEO Lewis Horne said “When people sell electric cars, the motivation is sustainability. So, why are they so heavy, and why are they the same cars? Where you just take out petrol and you put in the huge battery and you call it sustainable. But it’s not.”. The company has been designing a car that uses sustainable and recycled material such as bio-composite to reduce the footprint of the car during production. In addition, the fully <b>automated</b> <b>factory</b> provided in partnership with Siemens will be able to work with the lights turned off during 22h per day to save energy.|$|E

50|$|The {{step up to}} 300 mm {{required}} major changes, with fully <b>automated</b> <b>factories</b> using 300 mm wafers versus barely <b>automated</b> <b>factories</b> for the 200 mm wafers. These major investments were {{undertaken in}} the economic downturn following the dot-com bubble, resulting in huge resistance to upgrading to 450 mm by the original timeframe. On the ramp up to 450 mm are that the crystal ingots will be 3 times heavier (total weight a metric ton) and take 2-4 times longer to cool, and the process time will be double. All told, the development of 450 mm wafers requires significant engineering, time, and cost to overcome.|$|R

40|$|This {{project is}} {{concerned}} with the development of a distributed, multi-user Internet based simulation environment for <b>automated</b> <b>factories,</b> written in Java. The motivating factor behind the work described is the rapid development in computer controlled automated production lines, which has led to increasing complexity of scheduling of these systems. To avoid the costs in moving expert modellers and Operational Research staff to factory sites, a means for working in a geographically distributed manner is desirable. The environment described here provides that. Its benefits are shown through a case study and ideas for future work are explored. MOTIVATION Simulation {{has been shown to be}} a successful means of expressing and investigating problems in a wide range of fields and recently interest in simulations of <b>automated</b> <b>factories</b> has grown. In particular the graphical presentation of a simulation model has advantages over a more basic trace output, since the results are immediately more [...] ...|$|R

In this article, we review some of these tools and then focus on the Computation and Control Language, CCL, which we have developed as a modeling tool and a programming language for cooperative control systems. ...|$|R

50|$|A {{state-of-the-art}} Georgie Pie factory {{was located}} in Manukau City, Auckland. This <b>automated</b> <b>factory</b> replaced the original one, which operated out of Favona Road (behind Progressive Enterprises Head Office). The new facility was designed to support the continued local and international expansion of the brand. It was capable of producing more than 6,000 pies per hour. The pies were snap frozen (in a spiral freezer) in a raw state and distributed to stores, where they were freshly baked using impinger (conveyor) ovens. Upon its opening, the factory was the second largest investment for Progressive Enterprises.|$|E

Inevitables are built and programmed in <b>automated</b> <b>factories</b> called creche-forges; one of them, mentioned in the Manual of the Planes, is called Neumannus (a reference to Von Neumann machines). Every type of inevitable is designed to enforce {{a particular type of}} universal law and will pursue its objective at any cost. In order to fulfill their tasks, they may ally themselves with other creatures or, if necessary, sacrifice themselves.|$|R
50|$|The {{fundamental}} {{elements of}} the theory are tasks, i.e., the abstract specifications of transformations in terms of input/output pairs of attributes. A task is impossible {{if there is a}} law of physics that forbids its being performed with arbitrarily high accuracy, and possible otherwise. When it is possible, then a constructor for it can be built, again with arbitrary accuracy and reliability. A constructor is an entity which can cause the task to occur while retaining the ability to cause it again. Examples of constructors include a heat engine (a thermodynamic constructor), a catalyst (a chemical constructor) or a computer program controlling an <b>automated</b> <b>factory</b> (an example of a programmable constructor).|$|E

Perplexed, they return to their ship. At the crash site they find a local sentient alien has entered their vessel.

50|$|Xerox later adapted Diablo's daisy wheel {{technology}} into a typewriter that sold {{for less than}} $50. An <b>automated</b> <b>factory</b> was built near Dallas that took less than 30 minutes to assemble a Xerox typewriter. The Xerox typewriter was well received but never achieved the projected sales numbers due to {{the advent of the}} PC and word processing software. The typewriter was later modified to be compatible with PCs but the engineering which made it a low cost device reduced its flexibility. By the mid-1980s daisy wheel technology was rapidly becoming obsolete due to the growing spread of affordable laser and inkjet machines, and daisy wheel machines soon disappeared except for the small remaining typewriter market.|$|E

50|$|This is {{a device}} {{that is part of}} {{computers}} used today in nearly every machine <b>automated</b> <b>factory</b> worldwide. It is an electronic device that allows precise numerical control of machinery. It makes possible modern factory automation, as well as heating, ventilation, air-conditioning, plastic injection molding machines, commercial washing machines, and amusement park rides. It is even found in lavish stage effects of Broadway productions. The devices are designed to work in real time, taking in information, processing it and producing commands to control a mechanical process as it happens. The Programmable Logic Controller ("PLC") came about as a replacement for automatic control systems that used tens and hundreds (maybe even thousands) of relays, motor driven cam timers, and rotary sequencers.|$|E

Motorola made a key hire of the engineer who set up the <b>automated</b> <b>factory</b> for Apple's Macintosh. He created the technology necessary to mass-produce satellites on a gimbal, taking weeks instead of months or years and at a record low construction cost of only US$5 million per satellite. At its peak during the launch campaign in 1997 and 1998, Motorola produced a new satellite every 4.3 days, with the lead-time of a single satellite being 21 days.|$|E
50|$|His {{greatest}} {{achievement was}} an <b>automated</b> <b>factory</b> powered entirely by water; automation was very unusual at the time. Built in 1699 in Stjärnsund, the factory produced {{a number of}} products, deriving from the idea that Sweden should export fewer raw materials and process them within their own borders instead. The factory was a failure; it met great resistance among workers who feared they would be replaced by machinery. Eventually most of the factory was destroyed in a fire in 1734, leaving only {{the part of the}} factory that produced clocks left. The factory continued producing clocks, known for their high quality and low price. Although the popularity of the clocks diminished during the beginning of the 19th century, clock-making continues to this day at Stjärnsund, still producing around twenty clocks of the Polhem design per year.|$|E
50|$|Some 26 {{months after}} the Earth Return Vehicle is {{originally}} launched from Earth, a second vehicle, the Mars Habitat Unit, would be launched on a 6-month long low-energy transfer trajectory to Mars, and would carry a crew of four astronauts (the minimum number required so that the team can be split in two without leaving anyone alone). The Habitat Unit would not be launched until the <b>automated</b> <b>factory</b> aboard the ERV had signaled the successful production of chemicals required for operation on the planet and the return trip to Earth. During the trip, artificial gravity would be generated by tethering the Habitat Unit to the spent upper stage of the booster, and setting them rotating about a common axis. This rotation would produce a comfortable 1 g working environment for the astronauts, freeing them of the debilitating effects of long-term exposure to weightlessness.|$|E
