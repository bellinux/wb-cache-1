50|$|From 1988, DeKi 101 was {{frequently}} {{used as an}} <b>assisting</b> <b>locomotive</b> {{at the back of}} steam-hauled SL Paleo Express services operating on the Chichibu Main Line. This locomotive was withdrawn in 2006, and was repainted into its original brown livery at Hirosegawara Depot, where it remains stored.|$|E
50|$|The Prussian T 26 class steam {{locomotives}} {{always had}} to face the valley on the rack sections. Therefore, these trains had to have an <b>assisting</b> <b>locomotive</b> to push them uphill. In order to avoid the locomotives having to run around in Rennsteig station, where trains had to reverse, the locomotives were always placed with the chimney towards the mountain. This procedure ensured that the boiler water on the steep rack sections always stood at a sufficient height above the ceiling of the firebox.|$|E

50|$|The National Limited traversed some of {{the most}} {{challenging}} terrain in eastern railroading, climbing the Appalachian Mountains in western Maryland and West Virginia. Even through the diesel era, extra motive power was added at the head-end to take the train over these ridges, which meant extra stops {{on both sides of the}} mountain heights to add and remove <b>assisting</b> <b>locomotives.</b> Unfortunately, because the train traveled the B&O's lightly populated St. Louis main line serving towns in northern West Virginia and southern Ohio it never profited from high ridership. Still, the train lasted until the startup of Amtrak in 1971.|$|R
50|$|On this {{occasion}} {{the train was}} not assisted, because the coaches had been propelled, rather than hauled, into the platform, {{and so there was}} no locomotive at the rear as was the usual arrangement. The train left platform 5 at King's Cross station five minutes late, and entered Gasworks Tunnel. When it reached the rising gradient {{at the far end of}} the tunnel the locomotive began to slip badly on a section of newly replaced rail. In the absence of an <b>assisting</b> <b>locomotive</b> and with its own sanding equipment not working fully, no. 2512 was unable to grip the rail and eventually came to a stand. Preoccupied with his tasks at the controls and operating in darkness the driver didn't notice when the train slowed to a stop, and then began to run backwards.|$|E
5000|$|Traffic {{increased}} {{rapidly and}} the line was doubled, starting with the section from Bowes to the summit at Stainmore in 1866, followed by the line from Barnard Castle to the Tees Valley Junction. The NER opened the Tees Valley Railway to [...] in 1868. Doubling of the line to Tebay, except for Belah and Kirby Stephen and Kirby Stephen and Sandy Bank had been approved by 1875. The section between Belah to Kirkby Stephen was approved in 1889, and this involved the doubling of the Aitygill, Merrygill and Podgill viaducts. Smardale Gill Viaduct was built wide enough for double track, but single track was laid to ease the curve.At {{the end of the}} 19th century the line would be typically used by twenty freight trains, mostly mineral traffic. Westbound, 'double load' trains of 32 wagons would be assisted on the rising gradient by a locomotive at the rear. At the summit, where there was a reservoir to provide water, trains would be split into two for the descent. Up to 50 empty wagons could be managed on the return journey, the <b>assisting</b> <b>locomotive</b> then running light from the summit to Barnard Castle. Snow could a problem on the line, especially between the summit and Belah, {{and the line}} was closed by the weather in 1942, 1947 and 1955.|$|E

5000|$|Steam shunter/switchers are now {{mainly of}} {{historical}} interest. Steam switchers were either tank locomotives or had special (smaller) tenders, with narrow coal bunkers and/or sloped tender decks to increase rearward visibility. Headlights, where carried, were mounted on both ends. Most were either side-tank or saddle-tank types, however {{in the usual}} departure from its neighbours' practice, the Great Western Railway used pannier tanks for shunting and branch line work, a practice which the Western Region of BR perpetuated until steam traction was phased out, with several examples joining a 9F as banking engines to <b>assist</b> <b>locomotives</b> on the notoriously arduous ascent of the Lickey Incline, replacing the LMS [...] "Jinties" [...] which had formerly carried out the task alongside [...] "Big Emma".|$|R
25|$|Notwithstanding the {{limitation}} of their longer wheelbase, they were nevertheless widely used on both branch line and main line goods services.

50|$|A Luttermöller axle is {{an unusual}} steam {{locomotives}} component. Steam locomotives with several axles or wheelsets connected to one another by coupling rods {{are not able to}} negotiate tight curves well.

50|$|The P1 {{class engines}} were {{initially}} equipped with two-cylinder boosters {{attached to the}} trailing axle. These were engaged using a Westinghouse pump mounted on the boiler to engage the cylinder clutch. These had a tractive effort of 8,500 lbf kN when used, increasing the tractive effort of the locomotive from 38,500 to 47,000 lbf kN. It was intended by Gresley these boosters {{would be used to}} <b>assist</b> the <b>locomotive</b> while starting and topping the banks over which they travelled.|$|R
50|$|They {{were built}} to <b>assist</b> {{conventional}} <b>locomotives</b> {{up and down}} a steeply graded rack railway section of the Central Western line at Mount Morgan. In 1906 a further pair were built by the North British Locomotive Company with a further two delivered in 1915. One of the original pair was condemned in 1926, with the remaining five withdrawn when the steeply graded section was bypassed in 1952. The only time the locomotives strayed from Mount Morgan was when sent to Rockhampton for overhaul.|$|R

50|$|In the 1950s the Northbound train's {{scheduled}} {{departure from}} London Euston was 7:25pm, stopping at Rugby, Stafford, Crewe, Carlisle, Perth, Pitlochry, Blair Atholl, Dalwhinne, Newtonmore, Kingussie, Kincraig, Aviemore, Carrbridge, Tomatin, Moy, Daviot and Inverness, arriving approximately 9:00am next day. The Southbound train departed Inverness at approximately 5:30pm {{and followed the}} reverse route, although with fewer stops at the local stations. The train was pulled by steam engines, doubleheader, normally Duchess class <b>locomotives</b> <b>assisted</b> by an additional engine at the rear at Beattock Summit.|$|R

[...] An average speed of [...] was attained, including stops; maximum speed during the run was [...] During steeply graded portions of the run it was, of course, <b>assisted</b> by helper <b>locomotives.</b> [...] Such long distance runs were a goal of railway operating departments, enabling a reduction in locomotive numbers and through increased locomotive utilization, reduce overall costs.|$|R
50|$|The Württemberg railway Commission Michael Knoll {{was charged}} with the {{planning}} {{and implementation of the}} construction of the railway link between Stuttgart and Ulm. Knoll and his colleague Karl Etzel constructed the Geislinger Steige and foresaw that all trains would have to be <b>assisted</b> by pusher <b>locomotives</b> up this five and a half kilometre-long ramp in order to climb the Swabian Jura (Schwäbische Alb). The railway needed a station as close as possible above the Steige for the uncoupling of the pusher locomotives. Knoll chose a location about one kilometre west of Amstetten. The village at that time was, with some 300 inhabitants, one of the smaller settlements in the Oberamt (district) of Geislingen.|$|R
40|$|An {{electrochemical}} capacitor (EC) is an electrochemical {{energy storage}} device that has highly reversible charge-storage and delivery capability, long cycle-life (> 105 cycles) and high power density. EC finds usage in hybrid energy systems for electric vehicles, heavy-load starting <b>assist</b> for diesel <b>locomotives,</b> utility load leveling, military, and medical applications. Depending on the charge-storage mechanism, an EC is classified as an electrical double-layer capacitor or a pseudocapacitor. An EC typically consists of two electrodes and an electrolyte that acts not only as an ion conductor {{but also as a}} separator between the electrodes. An EC can employ an aqueous or a non-aqueous electrolyte in either liquid or solid state. Although liquid electrolytes exhibit higher ionic conductivity and better electrochemical performanc...|$|R
25|$|In later years, when wood {{freight cars}} {{had long been}} forgotten, helpers and pushers remained, {{although}} {{in the form of}} much larger, heavier, more powerful <b>locomotives</b> <b>assisting</b> far heavier trains. The BR operated two 700 series of Mallets: the comparatively light 700 through 741 and the heavier 742 through 754. Since they differed in frame design, this meant that the weaker 8th century were never doubled together. Instead, a light 700 would be coupled ahead of the heavier one for a double. When two 700 series Mallets were pushing, the same constraint was applied. If the run utilized two light Mallets, then the second one was placed at the rear, ahead of the caboose, and pushed. One more issue with doubled Mallets was whether or not all the bridges on the run were strong enough for two of the 9th century or the heavy 8th century running together.|$|R
5000|$|One {{locomotive}} of the Badminton Class was rebuilt with {{an experimental}} boiler. With the impending {{opening of the}} direct Reading-Taunton route which was of more undulating nature than the route via Bristol, {{there was a need}} to ensure that the most appropriate locomotives were provided. Churchward's Chief Assistant, F.G. Wright, designed a large boiler with a very deep firebox, which was fitted to no. 3297 Earl Cawdor in July 1903. The boiler was designed to hold a large volume of hot water, forming a reservoir to <b>assist</b> the <b>locomotive</b> running along an undulating line. It also provided a steam space of [...] as against the [...] of the Standard No. 4 boiler, the larger of the two types of standard boiler fitted to the 4-4-0s. This increase in volume was intended to provide a reservoir of steam. The firebox was set deep between the coupled axles, with a horizontal grate. The intention with this was to allow a thick fire to be built up, increasing the area of the firebox in contact with the fire, and decreasing the temperature gradient along the firebox plates, thus reducing the risk of broken firebox stays. The boiler was pressed to [...] No. 3297 was also fitted with a large cab with two side windows, reminiscent of North Eastern practice. The locomotive was regularly rostered on the most demanding trains, but it soon became apparent that it was not up to the work demanded and it was relegated to secondary duties. In October 1906 the boiler was removed and replaced by a Standard No.4 boiler, the North Eastern style side-window cab having been replaced by a Churchward type in November 1904.|$|R
5000|$|Transportation {{improvements}} {{began in}} 1839, when a horse-drawn wagonette line connected the Hill to downtown. A toll road, {{now known as}} Old Shell Road, was completed in 1850. It was built by laying down a bed of crushed oyster shells. [...] The Spring Hill Railroad was established in 1860, but sometimes required beasts of burden to <b>assist</b> the steam <b>locomotive</b> up the steep incline to Spring Hill. [...] With improved transportation, Spring Hill soon became home to summer retreat hotels. The Battle brothers established their Battle House Hotel in Mobile in 1852; then soon afterwards they built another at Spring Hill called the Spring Hill Inn. It sat amidst [...] {{on the south side}} of Old Shell Road and included a lake and bathing pavilion. The Spring Hill Hotel opened for business in 1886. 1893 saw the completion of an electric trolley line along Old Shell Road to the intersection of what is today McGregor Avenue. After being destroyed by fire during the first decade of the twentieth century, a new, larger Spring Hill Hotel, with a tall central tower, was built in its place. It too, was destroyed by fire in 1918. The Spring Hill Inn was also destroyed by fire around this time. With the popularity of retreat hotels diminished by this time, neither structure was rebuilt.|$|R
50|$|In 1933 the Garmisch-Murnau {{line was}} {{reclassified}} {{as a main}} line. The line had to be upgraded for the 1936 Winter Olympics {{to be held in}} Garmisch-Partenkirchen. Since the Murnau-Garmisch section was built as a local railway, it needed to be upgraded {{in a short period of}} time. The section had especially sharp bends and weak bridges. There were more problems on the Hechendorf-Murnau section, including a 2.6% grade, which sometimes required trains had to be so <b>assisted</b> by pusher <b>locomotives.</b> This involved complex movements with the pusher locomotive having to return to the bottom of the steep section on the single track section.For these reasons, on 26 and 27 March 1935 the management board of Deutsche Reichsbahn (German Railways) agreed to the duplication of the Huglfing-Hechendorf section. The upgrade would need to be completed by the beginning of winter 1935 in order to be ready for the 1936 Winter Olympics. In addition to the second track, the original track has been improved, curves had to be widened and the stations at Huglfing, Uffing, Murnau and Hechendorf had to be upgraded considerably. On 18 December 1935 the upgraded section was put back into service, although this required large structures such as a six-metre-high bridge over Highway 2 and the reconstruction of the bridge where the Oberammergau line crosses the line in Murnau. The second track in the Huglfing-Murnau section was dismantled in 1942 and 1943 as a result of the war. Ballast and sleepers from the line were used in the conversion of the Oberammergau line to the standard German electrical system in 1954. The Murnau-Hechendorf section is still operated as two lines. The upgrading of the line in 1935 increased the line speed between Tutzing and Murnau from 80 to 110 km/h and between Murnau and Garmisch-Partenkirchen from 55 to 80 km/h.|$|R
