5|$|Inspired by real-life Christmas toy sell-outs for {{products}} such as the Cabbage Patch Kids <b>and</b> <b>Mighty</b> Morphin Power Rangers, the film was written by Randy Kornfield. Producer Chris Columbus rewrote the script, adding in elements of satire about the commercialization of Christmas, and the project {{was picked up by}} 20th Century Fox. Delays on Fox's reboot of Planet of the Apes allowed Schwarzenegger to come on board the film, while Columbus opted to cast Sinbad ahead of Joe Pesci as Myron. Jingle All the Way was set and filmed in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul at a variety of locations, including the Mall of America. After five weeks filming, production moved to California where scenes such as the end parade were shot. The film's swift production meant merchandising was limited to a replica of the Turbo-Man action figure used in the film.|$|E

25|$|There are {{opinions}} about the validity and authenticity {{of each of the}} mentioned narratives.

However, some have questioned the reports of Karnamag and Shahnameh, considered them mythical and intended to legitimize the founder of the Sasanian dynasty.|$|E
25|$|The {{music of}} Trinidad and Tobago {{is best known}} for its calypso music, soca music and steelpan, {{including}} its internationally noted performances in the 1950s from native artists such as Lord Kitchener <b>and</b> <b>Mighty</b> Sparrow.

There are also local communities which practise and experiment with international classical and pop music, often fusing them with local steelpan instruments.|$|E

25|$|Each bishopric {{was divided}} {{into a number of}} territories or counties, named terras,condados, mandationes, commissos, or territorios in local charters, which in the north were true continuations of the Suebic dioceses which {{frequently}} preserved old tribal divisions and denominations, such as Lemabos, Celticos, Postamarcos, Bregantinos, and Cavarcos. Rights to the tax collection and government of each territory was granted by the titular ruler—usually the king—to a count, bishopric, or large monastery, although there existed some singularities. The bishopric of Lugo {{was divided into}} counties, each one under the government of an infanzon (a lesser nobleman) as a concession of the bishop, while in the south, large <b>and</b> <b>mighty</b> territories such as the Portucalense became hereditary, passed down to the descendants of the 9th century's conquerors.
