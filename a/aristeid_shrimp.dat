40|$|The {{occurrence}} of the <b>aristeid</b> <b>shrimp</b> Hymenopenaeus debilis in the Mediterranean Sea is reported from two individuals collected in the Alboran Sea and off Eivissa (western Mediterranean) from depths of 668 - 679 and 1109 - 1140 m, respectively. Comments {{on the origin of}} the populations and biogeography of the species are related to the Mediterranean pseudopopulations hypothesis. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Mid-water {{plankton}} collections commonly include {{bizarre and}} mysterious developmental stages that differ conspicuously from their adult counterparts in morphology and habitat. Unaware {{of the existence}} of planktonic larval stages, early zoologists often misidentified these unique morphologies as independent adult lineages. Many such mistakes have since been corrected by collecting larvae, raising them in the lab, and identifying the adult forms. However, challenges arise when the larva is remarkably rare in nature and relatively inaccessible due to its changing habitats over the course of ontogeny. The midwater marine species Cerataspis monstrosa (Gray 1828) is an armored crustacean larva whose adult identity has remained a mystery for over 180 years. Our phylogenetic analyses, based in part on recent collections from the Gulf of Mexico, provide definitive evidence that the rare, yet broadly distributed larva, C. monstrosa, is an early developmental stage of the globally distributed deepwater <b>aristeid</b> <b>shrimp,</b> Plesiopenaeus armatus. Divergence estimates and phylogenetic relationships across five genes confirm the larva and adult are the same species. Our work demonstrates the diagnostic power of molecular systematics in instances where larval rearing seldom succeeds and morphology and habitat are not indicative of identity. Larval–adult linkages not only aid in our understanding of biodiversity, they provide insights into the life history, distribution, and ecology of an organism...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of a deep-sea fishery for <b>aristeid</b> <b>shrimps</b> off Brazil is reviewed from its early days in 2002. Descriptive data were collected by observers on board 75 directed fishing trips conducted in the study period, {{with a total of}} over 15, 000 monitored trawls. An incipient fishing phase took place between No-vember 2000 and October 2002, when <b>aristeid</b> <b>shrimps</b> were occasionally reported in the bycatch of operations mostly targeting the Argentine hake (Merluccius hubbsi). After that, a directed fishery was established for these resources. All nine vessels involved in this fishery (one national and eight chartered) concentrated on 11 limited grounds between 700 and 800 m deep and 18 °S and 34 °S. The main species caught between November 2002 and May 2007 was the "carabinero" Aristaeopsis edwardsiana (456, 710 kg), followed by the "moruno" Aristaeomorpha foliácea (121, 497 kg), and then the "alistado" Aristeus antillensis (27, 919 kg). The trawlers operate in conjunction, such that the total area of each fishing ground was swept at least twice. This harvest pattern substantially reduced "carabinero" catch rates from 14 kg hour- 1 in the first sampled trimester to 4 kg hour- 1 in the last. Despite the inferred biomass reduction of this species, the fishery has continued without a formal management plan...|$|R
