5|$|The {{meat and}} blubber of the {{dolphins}} caught {{has been found}} to have high levels of mercury, cadmium, the pesticide DDT, and organic contaminants like PCBs. The levels are high enough to pose a health risk for those frequently eating the meat and researchers warn that children and pregnant women shouldn't eat the meat <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> <b>Because</b> of the health concerns, the price of dolphin meat has decreased significantly.|$|E
5|$|Some viruses {{store their}} entire genomes {{in the form}} of RNA, and contain no DNA <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> <b>Because</b> they use RNA to store genes, their {{cellular}} hosts may synthesize their proteins as soon as they are infected and without the delay in waiting for transcription. On the other hand, RNA retroviruses, such as HIV, require the reverse transcription of their genome from RNA into DNA before their proteins can be synthesized. RNA-mediated epigenetic inheritance has also been observed in plants and very rarely in animals.|$|E
5|$|The {{southern}} {{right whale}} spends the summer months in the far Southern Ocean feeding, probably close to Antarctica. It migrates north in winter for breeding, and can be seen around the coasts of Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, Mozambique, New Zealand, South Africa and Uruguay. Since hunting of the {{southern right whale}} ceased, stocks are estimated to have grown by 7% a year. The South American, South African and Australasian groups apparently intermix very little, if <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> <b>because</b> of the strong fidelity of mothers to their feeding and calving grounds. The mother passes these instincts to her calves.|$|E

Many farmers had no crop <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>because</b> of rust and many other crops were fed to cattle as their quality as grain was extremely poor.|$|E
25|$|White chocolate, {{although}} {{similar in}} texture {{to that of}} milk and dark chocolate, does not contain any cocoa solids. Because of this, many countries do not consider white chocolate as chocolate <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> <b>Because</b> it does not contain any cocoa solids, white chocolate does not contain any theobromine, {{so it can be}} consumed by animals.|$|E
25|$|The Foreigner Talk (FT) {{hypothesis}} {{argues that}} a pidgin or creole language forms when native speakers attempt to simplify their language {{in order to address}} speakers who do not know their language <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> <b>Because</b> of the similarities found in this type of speech and speech directed to a small child, it is also sometimes called baby talk.|$|E

25|$|The fishery {{has yet to}} recover, and may {{not recover}} <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>because</b> of a {{possibly}} stable change in the food chain. Atlantic cod was a top-tier predator, along with haddock, flounder and hake, feeding upon smaller prey such as herring, capelin, shrimp and snow crab. With the large predatory fish removed, their prey has had a population explosion and have become the top predators.|$|E
25|$|If VBA {{determines that}} a veteran suffers from service-connected PTSD, then they assign a {{disability}} rating, {{expressed as a}} percentage. This disability rating determines the amount of compensation and other disability benefits the VA will provide to the veteran. The disability rating indicates {{the extent to which}} PTSD has deprived the veteran of his or her average earnings capacity. A rating of 0% indicates that a veteran has PTSD but the disorder has not affected his or her ability to work, whereas a 100% rating theoretically means that the veteran is not capable of working <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>because</b> of PTSD.|$|E
25|$|However it {{cannot be}} stated affirmatively where {{the mind of}} an arahant exists or that it exists <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> <b>because</b> {{describing}} an arahant's mind in terms of existence would limit it to the confines of time and space, which Nirvana occurs outside of. It would be equally incorrect {{to say that the}} mind of an arahant does not exist — the Buddha said that the idea of existence or non-existence “does not apply” to the behavior of an arahant's mind. Ajaan Mun argued all of this by describing a unique class of “objectless” or “themeless” consciousness specific to Nirvana, which differs from the consciousness aggregate.|$|E

25|$|The 1978 Christmas Day {{show was}} {{disrupted}} due to industrial {{action at the}} BBC, requiring a change in format to the broadcast. The first show, due to be screened on 21 December, was not shown <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>because</b> BBC1 was off the air. For Christmas Day, Noel Edmonds (presenting his last ever edition of TOTP) hosted the show from the 'TOTP Production Office' with clips taken from various editions of the show broadcast during the year and new studio footage performed without an audience. The format was slightly tweaked for the Christmas Day edition in 1981, with the Radio 1 DJs choosing their favourite tracks {{of the year and}} the following edition on 31 December featuring the year's number 1 hits.|$|E
25|$|Many {{people in}} Syracuse, the richest and most {{powerful}} city of Sicily, felt that the Athenians were in fact coming to attack them under the pretense of aiding Segesta in a minor war. The Syracusan general Hermocrates suggested that they ask for help from other Sicilian cities, and from Carthage. He also wanted to meet the Athenian fleet in the Ionian Sea before they arrived. Others argued that Athens was no threat to Syracuse, and some people did not believe there was a fleet <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> <b>because</b> Athens {{would not be so}} foolish as to attack them while they were still at war with Sparta. Athenagoras accused Hermocrates and others of attempting to instill fear among the population and trying to overthrow the government.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{technical}} problem with {{recovery of the}} exhaled gas. Simply venting it to a return hose through a non-return valve will not work, as the hose must be maintained at exactly the ambient pressure at {{the depth of the}} helmet, otherwise the gas from the helmet will either free-flow out under pressure, or not flow out <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>because</b> of back pressure. This obstacle is overcome by using an exhaust valve working on the same principle as the demand valve, which opens the exhaust valve by using the leverage of a diaphragm sensing the pressure difference between the helmet interior pressure and the ambient pressure, This only requires the pressure in the reclaim hose to be lower than ambient at the diver to function. The same principle is used in a diving chamber's Built-in breathing system (BIBS).|$|E

25|$|For {{about four}} months after the {{opposition}} of Jupiter (from L to K in the diagram below), it is possible to view emergences of Io from its eclipses, while for {{about four months}} before the opposition (from F to G), it is possible to view immersions of Io into Jupiter's shadow. For about five or six months of the year, around the point of conjunction, it is impossible to observe the eclipses of Io <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>because</b> Jupiter is too close (in the sky) to the sun. Even during the periods before and after opposition, not all of the eclipses of Io can be observed from a given location on the Earth's surface: some eclipses will occur during the daytime for a given location, while other eclipses will occur while Jupiter is below the horizon (hidden by the Earth itself).|$|E
500|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{inclusion}} of LGBT issues attract media attention, {{in which the}} hype makes some fans and creators uncomfortable. [...] Podcaster Faust points out for example, that gay marriage in a comic issue is treated almost as an “event”, when that series had already been significant with openly gay characters. Lobdell, while wondering about the attention media gives gay characters, hopes that in the near future, they will not “make the news <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> <b>because</b> they are as common as capes and cowls.” ...|$|E
500|$|Futterman {{praised the}} return of Chenoweth's {{character}} April Rhodes, and The Wall Street Journal Raymund Flandez said that she [...] "brings such lightness, humor and zaniness that's endearingly button-nose cute". Fallon wrote, [...] "Chenoweth's every sly smirk, eyebrow tick, and note sung—well, that was my week's highlight." [...] Reiter was unenthusiastic: she acknowledged [...] "Chenoweth's amazing pipes", but added [...] "her character, which was thin to start with, has kind of worn out its welcome". The subplot of Will thinking about going to Broadway with April was roundly criticized: both Meghan Brown of The Atlantic and Bobby Hankinson of the Houston Chronicle {{said there was no}} tension <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>because</b> the viewer knows that he will stay. The A.V.

500|$|Likewise, Beatty said {{he enjoyed}} the actual filming of the episodes but hated the {{television}} business end of it, claiming, [...] "I can't think of anything I would less rather do than television at this moment." [...] He said the process left him [...] "pretty much burnt" [...] and said his enthusiasm for the show had [...] "eroded as time goes on". It was initially reported that Beatty would not return for the second Homicide season <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>because</b> he had accepted a starring role in The Boys, a CBS comedy series also featuring Christopher Meloni. Polito {{said he did not}} believe Beatty's departure would hurt the show because of the ensemble nature of the cast: [...] "I love Ned's work, but the show won't fall apart because of one character."

Or did he not give the work a number <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> <b>because</b> he was not satisfied with it?" [...] The composer's daughter Katarina spoke of the self-doubt that afflicted her father at this time, aggravated by the continuing expectations and fuss that surrounded the Eighth Symphony.

So the guy's chest is cut open and he’s been in make-up for hours {{to make it look like}} he’s been torn open and he’s all bloody and stuff. So then they pour these worms and this goopy, syrupy stuff and this fake blood onto this guy’s chest... We had to zip him up in the body bag. It takes a few minutes to get to 'action' after he's zipped up. We unzip him and we see the worms and it’s so gross–and the look on his face. The worms are crawling up and their in his armpits and starting to crawl toward his face and he can’t move <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>because</b> he’s supposed to be dead." [...] Nicole continued that this scene had to be shot [...] "three or four times.
