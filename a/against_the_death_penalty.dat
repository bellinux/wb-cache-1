40|$|The United States {{is almost}} alone among nations in {{permitting}} {{the execution of}} juvenile offenders. Citing this fact, along {{with a variety of}} legal and historical materials, litigants and scholars are increasingly claiming that the United States 2 ̆ 7 use of <b>the</b> juvenile <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> violates international law. This Article examines the validity of this claim, from the perspective of both the international legal system and the U. S. legal system. Based on a detailed examination of the United States 2 ̆ 7 interaction with treaty regimes and international institutions since the late 1940 s, the Article concludes that the international law arguments <b>against</b> <b>the</b> juvenile <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> have significant weaknesses. As the Article documents, for a number of reasons, the United States has consistently declined to consent to treaty provisions restricting <b>the</b> juvenile <b>death</b> <b>penalty,</b> and it has consistently declared the human rights treaties that contain such restrictions to be non-self-executing. In addition, since at least the mid- 1980 s, the United States has persistently objected to-and thereby legally opted out of-any customary international law restriction on <b>the</b> juvenile <b>death</b> <b>penalty.</b> <b>The</b> Article also argues that, even if the international law arguments <b>against</b> <b>the</b> juvenile <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> were more persuasive, they would not provide a basis for relief in U. S. courts. For separation of powers reasons, courts properly will decline to apply international law to override the considered choices of the president and Senate in their ratification of treaties. In addition, because of concerns relating to both separation of powers and federalism, courts properly will decline to apply customary international law to override state criminal punishment, especially when (as is the case here) the political branches have expressly declined to do so by treaty. This potential gap between evolving international law norms and U. S. judicial enforcement is less disturbing than some commentators appear to assume-it simply means that <b>the</b> juvenile <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> issue, like other difficult issues of social policy in the United States, must be resolved through U. S. democratic and constitutional processes...|$|R

40|$|During the Dark Ages and the Renaissance, Europe’s monarchs often {{resorted to}} torture and executions. The pain inflicted by {{instruments}} of torture—from the thumbscrew and the rack to the Inquisition’s tools of torment—was eclipsed only by horrific methods of execution, from breaking {{on the wheel}} and crucifixion to drawing and quartering and burning at the stake. The English “Bloody Code” made more than 200 crimes punishable by death, and judicial torture—expressly authorized by law and used to extract confessions—permeated continental European legal systems. Judges regularly imposed death sentences and other harsh corporal punishments, from the stocks and the pillory, to branding and ear cropping, to lashes at public whipping posts. In the Enlightenment, jurists and writers questioned the efficacy of torture and capital punishment. In 1764, the Italian philosopher Cesare Beccaria—the father of the world’s anti–death penalty movement—condemned both practices. And Montesquieu, like Beccaria and others, concluded that any punishment that goes beyond absolute necessity is tyrannical. Traditionally, torture and executions have been viewed in separate legal silos, with countries renouncing acts of torture while simultaneously using capital punishment. <b>The</b> UN Convention <b>Against</b> Torture strictly prohibits physical or psychological torture; not even war or threat of war can be invoked to justify it. But {{under the guise of}} “lawful sanctions,” some countries continue to carry out executions even though they bear the indicia of torture. In <b>The</b> <b>Death</b> <b>Penalty</b> as Torture, Prof. John Bessler argues that death sentences and executions are medieval relics. In a world in which “mock” or simulated executions, as well as a host of other non-lethal acts, are already considered to be torturous, he contends that death sentences and executions should be classified under the rubric of torture. Unlike in the Middle Ages, penitentiaries—one of the products of the Enlightenment—now exist throughout the globe to house violent offenders. With the rise of life without parole sentences, and with more than four of five nations no longer using executions, <b>The</b> <b>Death</b> <b>Penalty</b> as Torture calls for the recognition of a peremptory, international law norm <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty’s</b> use.

Pelecanos has described the book as an anti-detective novel because no case is solved by the private investigators and they are constantly a step behind the police.|$|E
25|$|White took {{a middle}} {{course on the}} issue of the death penalty: he was one of five justices who voted in Furman v. Georgia (1972) to strike down several state capital {{punishment}} statutes, voicing concern over the arbitrary nature in which the death penalty was administered. The Furman decision ended capital punishment in the U.S. until 1977, when Gary Gilmore, who decided not to appeal his death sentence, was executed by firing squad. White, however, was not <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> in all forms: he voted to uphold the death penalty statutes at issue in Gregg v. Georgia (1976), even the mandatory death penalty schemes struck down by the Court.|$|E
25|$|In 21 AD, Tiberius {{offered him}} the {{governorship}} of Africa Province.

Although these episodes may seem a flattery towards the emperor Tiberius, Lepidus' activities in the senate show an independent mind. In 21 AD he made a strong speech <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> for an irreverent poet. Nevertheless, the poet was executed by order of the senate: this allowed Tiberius to praise Lepidus' moderation (as well as the senate's zeal in persecuting any offence against the emperor).|$|E

The prosecution, on the other hand, believed Smith murdered her children in order to start a new life with a former lover. It only took the jury two and a half hours to convict her of murdering her two sons. During the penalty phase, Tommy Pope, the lead prosecutor in the Smith case, argued passionately in favor of sentencing Smith to <b>death.</b> But <b>the</b> jury ultimately voted <b>against</b> imposing <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty.</b>|$|R
2500|$|On 11 July 1963, the High Command of the ANC {{was caught}} at Lilliesleaf Farm in Rivonia, {{one of them}} being Govan Mbeki. To hold the prisoners, the General Laws Amendment Act, Number 37 of 1963, was rushed through Parliament and applied {{retrospectively}} to 27 June 1962, mainly but not exclusively so that the people arrested at Rivonia could be detained and held in solitary confinement. [...] In July of the same year, Mbeki began mobilising international support against apartheid. Horrified at the Act, Mbeki led a successful motion in the Student Union to condemn the move and join the boycott of South African goods. He strongly condemned the South African government's new restrictions on political activity and likened it to {{in the politics of}} Nazi Germany. In April 1964, Mbeki appeared before a delegation of the United Nations Special Committee against Apartheid to plead for the life of his father, who by then had been charged with planning an armed uprising <b>against</b> <b>the</b> state. <b>The</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> seemed a certainty for all the Rivonia Treason Trialists.

25|$|Consistent with Catherine's stance, {{the next}} several decades marked a shift of public {{perception}} <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty.</b> In 1824, {{the very existence of}} such a punishment was among the reasons for legislature's refusal to approve {{a new version of the}} Penal Code. Just one year later, the Decembrist revolt failed, and a court sentenced 36 of the rebels to death. Nicholas I's decision to commute all but five of the sentences was highly unusual for the time, especially taking into account that revolts against the monarchy had almost universally resulted in an automatic death sentence, and was perhaps due to society's changing views of the death penalty. By the late 1890s, capital punishment for murder was virtually never carried out, but substituted with 10 to 15 years imprisonment with hard labor, although it still was carried out for treason (for example, Alexander Ulyanov was hanged in 1887). However, in 1910, capital punishment was reintroduced and expanded, although still very seldom used.|$|E
25|$|The Roman Catholic Church in Poland {{provided}} many persecuted Jews {{with food}} and shelter during the war, even though monasteries gave no immunity to Polish priests and monks <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty.</b> Nearly every Catholic institution in Poland looked after a few Jews, usually children with forged Christian birth certificates and an assumed or vague identity. In particular, convents of Catholic nuns in Poland (see Sister Bertranda), {{played a major role}} in the effort to rescue and shelter Polish Jews, with the Franciscan Sisters credited with the largest number of Jewish children saved. Two thirds of all nunneries in Poland took part in the rescue, in all likelihood with the support and encouragement of the church hierarchy. These efforts were supported by local Polish bishops and the Vatican itself. The convent leaders never disclosed the exact number of children saved in their institutions, and for security reasons the rescued children were never registered. Jewish institutions have no statistics that could clarify the matter. Systematic recording of testimonies did not begin until the early 1970s. In the villages of Ożarów, Ignaców, Szymanów, and Grodzisko near Leżajsk, the Jewish children were cared for by Catholic convents and by the surrounding communities. In these villages, Christian parents did not remove their children from schools where Jewish children were in attendance.|$|E

25|$|The four-month trial, {{which began}} on April 11, 1961, was highly publicized and covered by radio, newspaper, and {{television}} journalists {{from around the}} world.

Another 570 viewers watched on a closed-circuit screen in the nearby Ratisbonne Monastery. Israelis had the opportunity to watch live television broadcasts of the proceedings, and videotape was flown daily to the United States for broadcast the following day. A bulletproof glass wall was erected between the stage where the judges sat and the spectator seating, and Eichmann sat inside his own bulletproof glass booth with armed guards at his side. The trial concluded on August 14, 1961; on December 13 the court found Eichmann guilty of crimes <b>against</b> humanity. <b>The</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> was issued on December 15.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. July 2010. Major: Political Science. Advisor: Professor Kathryn Sikkink. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); v, 464 pages, appendices A-E. This dissertation examines how {{an idea that}} begins {{in one part of}} the world becomes a global norm that almost all states in the international system obey. It investigates the processes of normative development and global diffusion through the study of a single norm: the prohibition of <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> for child offenders under the age 18. The dissertation traces the life cycle of this norm from its origins to its rapid global spread in the 1960 s and 1970 s to the present, when it has been internalized by most countries while also strongly contested by a handful of others. Through case studies of <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> policies of China, Ethiopia, France, Japan, Kenya, Pakistan, Tanzania, Tunisia, the United Kingdom and the United States, as well as through institutional case studies of UNICEF and Amnesty International, I argue that abolition of <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> for child offenders diffused as a key part of a globalized childhood. This globalized childhood originated in parts of Europe and the United States and spread via the colonial powers of Britain and France. In the last few decades of the 20 th century, international law addressing children homogenized state policies, further crystallizing <b>the</b> norm <b>against</b> <b>the</b> child <b>death</b> <b>penalty.</b> By considering how states incorporate a specific norm into their domestic value system and legal framework, I explain how such factors as state structure, international pressure, domestic-level actors (such as NGOs and social movements) and law produce human rights change and catalyze international transformation...|$|R
