They were significantly more expensive than both 5.25 inch and 3.5 inch alternatives. This, combined with their low nominal capacities and their essentially proprietary nature, led to the format being discontinued shortly after the CPC itself was discontinued.|$|E

50|$|The Court of Justice {{held that}} the {{requirement}} was contrary to article 34. Under the Directive, the UK, Ireland, Denmark could authorised manufacturers to add vegetable fats to chocolate made there, but it could not benefit from the free movement clause. TFEU article 34 applied to obstacles to marketing products. The Italian rule would make British producers adjust their products and incur <b>additional</b> <b>packaging</b> costs. The Italian law had to be justified by a mandatory requirement, and steps must be proportionate. On the facts, the addition of vegetable fat did not substantially modify the product. So a ‘neutral and objective statement’ informing consumers would be enough. Obliging a change of the sale name was going further than necessary to protect consumers.|$|E

40|$|AbstractMulti-segmented dsRNA viruses {{have been}} {{suggested}} to utilize cis-acting elements in the plus-strand RNA to accomplish genomic RNA assortment during viral packaging. It is not clear if bi-segmented dsRNA birnavirus uses the same strategy. By applying a reverse genetic technique, we generated IBDV particles packaged with only segment A by co-transfection DF- 1 cells of cDNA from segment A and VP 1 (without 5 ′ and 3 ′ noncoding region of segment B) supporting random assortment mechanism and indicating the packaging elements of segment B include sequences in the 5 ′ and 3 ′ NCR. However, gfp-containing IBDV could not be generated {{in the presence of}} gfp cDNA constructs flanked by 5 ′ and 3 ′ NCR from segment A or segment B. The data suggest <b>additional</b> <b>packaging</b> signals are required for IBDV genomic packaging. The presence of VP 1 protein in the IBDV-A particles also suggests the formation of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes might be involved in the assembly of viral particles...|$|E

40|$|The issue {{logic of}} a superscalar {{processor}} dissipates {{a large amount}} of static and dynamic power.

The compiler passes information to the processor about the number of entries needed which limits the number of in-structions dispatched and resident in the queue. This saves power without adversely affecting performance. Compared with recently proposed hardware techniques, our approach is faster, simpler and saves more power. Us-ing a simplistic scheme we achieve 47 % dynamic and 31 % static power savings in the issue queue with only a 2. 2 % performance loss. We then show that the performance loss can be reduced to less than 1. 3 % with 45 % dynamic and 30 % static power savings, outperforming all current ap-proaches. 1...|$|E
40|$|Retroviruses {{preferentially}} package full-length genomic RNA over spliced viral messages. For most retroviruses, this {{preference is}} {{likely due to}} the absence of {{all or part of the}} packaging signal on subgenomic RNAs. In avian leukosis-sarcoma virus, however, we have shown that the minimal packaging signal, MΨ, is located upstream of the 5 ′ splice site and therefore is present on both genomic and spliced RNAs. We now show that an MΨ-containing heterologous RNA is packaged only 2. 6 -fold less efficiently than genomic Rous sarcoma virus RNA. Thus, few <b>additional</b> <b>packaging</b> sequences and/or structures exist outside of MΨ. In contrast, we found that env mRNA is not efficiently packaged. These results indicate that either MΨ is not functional on this RNA or the RNA is somehow segregated from the packaging machinery. Finally, deletion of sequences from the 3 ′ end of MΨ was found to reduce the packaging efficiency of heterologous RNAs...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The issue {{logic of}} a superscalar {{processor}} consumes {{a large amount}} of static and dynamic energy. Furthermore, its power density makes it a hot-spot requiring expensive cooling systems and <b>additional</b> <b>packaging.</b> This paper presents a novel approach to energy reduction that uses compiler analysis communicated to the hardware, allowing the processor to dynamically resize the issue queue, fitting it to the available ILP without slowing down the critical path. Limiting the entries available reduces the quantity of instructions dispatched, leading to energy savings in the banked issue queue without adversely affecting performance. Compared with a recently proposed hardware scheme, our approach is faster, simpler and saves more energy. A simplistic scheme achieves 31 % dynamic and 33 % static energy savings in the issue queue with a 7. 2 % performance loss. Using more sophisticated compiler analysis we then show that the performance loss can be reduced to less than 0. 6 % with 24 % dynamic and 30 % static energy savings and an EDD product of 0. 96, outperforming two current state-of-the-art hardware approaches. ...|$|E
