40|$|Northern Powergrid (NPG) is an {{electrical}} distribution network operator in the UK servicing Yorkshire and the Northeast of England. Currently they produce long-term eight year forecasts for each substation {{on the network}} {{with an emphasis on}} an <b>annual</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>demand</b> (MD) figure. The current method used by NPG is thought to oversimplify the problem and does not give enough insight into changes in substation demand. In order to inform their current forecast, the novel CL-ANFIS method uses a combination of machine learning techniques for both forecasting and general insight to the drivers of demand. Also introduced here are novel techniques for determination of MD at NPG and methods for handling load transfer periods. In order to address a problem of this size, a twofold approach is taken. One is to address the drivers of demand such as weather, economic or demographic data sets through the use of statistics and machine learning techniques. The other is to address the long-term forecasting problem with a transparent technique that can aid in explaining the drivers of demand on any given substation. Techniques used include cluster analysis on demographic data sets in addition to ANFIS as a forecasting method. The results of the novel CL-ANFIS method are compared against the current NPG forecast and show how more insight into substation demand profiles can drive the decision-making process. This is done through a combination of using a tailored customer database for NPG and leveraging the information provided by the membership functions of ANFIS...|$|E

40|$|Water {{utilities}} undertake {{long term}} planning for water source security, often with forecast cycles of 20 to 30 years. Whilst this planning is generally involved with investigations of source water abstraction security {{and the need to}} build dams or to increase the recharge rate of groundwater aquifers, planning for water efficiency gains occurs at annual intervals. Most water utilities in Australia are heavily engaged in water efficiency initiatives with rebate schemes for domestic water-efficient devices ubiquitous across the industry. Wide Bay Water Corporation (WBWC) also engages in these activities but is increasingly interested in the concept of Time of Use Tariffs (TOUT) to target high water users in order to reduce their demand on the system. In 2006, WBWC introduced smart metering technology across the city which captures hourly use data. Interrogation of this data has lead to the ability to identify water use patterns for every domestic and commercial water customer and to design specific interventions to encourage water efficiency, such as a TOUT for domestic customers. A TOUT has been developed that imposes a penalty on all individual consumption greater than 600 L in any hourly interval of any day in the year. The tariff was designed to reduce both the <b>annual</b> <b>maximum</b> peak hour <b>demand</b> and <b>annual</b> <b>maximum</b> day consumption. The ability to reduce both of these infrastructure design parameters has the potential to deliver substantial savings in infrastructure planning and deployment. This paper details the design process of this tariff, examines the infrastructure savings potential derived by network modelling explores and the regulatory framework engagement hurdles to be overcome in order to implement such tariffs in the water industry.

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} was to model, based on the overall {{distribution}} of extreme values, the probability of occurrence of a particular level of <b>annual</b> <b>maximum</b> daily rainfall in three Brazilian regions (Midwest, Southeast and South) and study their behavior over the past 71 years. The parameters of the general distribution of extreme values were estimated by the maximum likelihood method. The Mann–Kendall test showed that there is a positive trend in the <b>annual</b> <b>maximum</b> daily rainfall data series. The non-stationarity was rejected by the augmented Dickey–Fuller test supporting the use of the density function of extreme value distribution to describe the values of the occurrence of <b>annual</b> <b>maximum</b> daily rainfall. The Kolmogorov–Smirnov/Lilliefors goodness-of-fit test showed the good fit of the studied variable to the probability distribution function. The Midwest region has a return period of more frequent <b>annual</b> <b>maximum</b> daily rainfall below 300 mm in comparison with other regions. There is a clear change in the behavior of this extreme event in the Southern region. According to the literature, in past decades <b>annual</b> <b>maximum</b> daily rainfall of 248 mm has been estimated for a return period of 100 years for the state of Santa Catarina-South region, while the results found with the current series, <b>annual</b> <b>maximum</b> daily rainfall of 250 mm was estimated for a return period of 10 years.

40|$|Wave climate risk {{analyses}} must {{balance the}} information available from short data records with the application requirement of predicting rare events. The basis for long term risk analysis is typically the series of <b>annual</b> <b>maximum</b> events, rarely as long as 20 years. The triple <b>annual</b> <b>maximum</b> series, the 3 largest maximum monthly significant wave heights in each climate year, is used here to supplement the sparsity of the <b>annual</b> <b>maximum</b> data. Results from order statistics enable development of a maximum likelihood method for fitting a statistical distribution for the <b>annual</b> <b>maximum</b> event to the triple <b>annual</b> <b>maximum</b> data series and design events at the desired average recurrence intervals are then estimated as quantiles of the fitted distribution. The enhanced reliability of these estimates is confirmed by numerical experimentation. Duration of sea state intensities is of consequence where there are risks due to high seas that persist for hours or days. Application of the triple <b>annual</b> <b>maximum</b> method to one hour significant wave height measurements is extended to runs of significant wave heights continuing over longer durations. Intensity-duration-frequency curves from surface water hydrology are adopted for organization and presentation ofthe results of triple <b>annual</b> <b>maximum</b> analysis for sea state intensities of varying durations. With significant wave height as the intensity measure and average recurrence interval giving the frequency, a family of intensity­ duration curves is constructed, from which magnitudes of estimated design events can be read with ease. Confidence intervals provide a necessary sense of the uncertainty associated with design event estimates. A bootstrap procedure for estimating confidence intervals on triple <b>annual</b> <b>maximum</b> design event estimates is recommended, and its performance is validated by numerical experiments Wave climate risk analyses, comprising triple <b>annual</b> <b>maximum</b> distribution fits, intensity-duration-frequency curves, and bootstrapped confidence intervals on selected design events, are given for five National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration National Data Buoy Center sites in United States waters. These procedures and presentations, used routinely, are of value wherever risks due to sea state intensity must be addressed. Other geophysical risks are amenable as well to analysis by the same methods...|$|R

The trends and change point of <b>annual</b> <b>maximum</b> flood flow and flood duration are also investigated by statistical tests. The results indicate that (1) the <b>annual</b> <b>maximum</b> flood flow only has a marginally increasing trend, whereas the flood duration exhibits a significant decreasing trend at the 0. 10 significant level. The change point for the <b>annual</b> <b>maximum</b> flood flow series was found in 1991 and after which the mean maximum flood flow increased by 45. 26 %. (2) The period after 1991 is characterized by frequent and shorter duration floods due to increased rainstorm. However, land use change in the basin was found intensifying the increased tendency of <b>annual</b> <b>maximum</b> flow after 1991. And (3) under nonstationary environmental conditions, alternative definitions of return period should be adapted. The impacts on curve fitting of flood series showed an overall change of upper tail from "gentle" to "steep," and the design flood magnitude became larger. Therefore, a nonstationary frequency analysis taking account of change point in the data series is highly recommended for future studies...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} several {{models for}} representing {{the distribution of}} the <b>annual</b> <b>maximum</b> flood at a site when the <b>annual</b> <b>maximum</b> flood series corresponds to the maximum of two distinct annual flood series. A joint model, that incorporates correlation between the two series, is theoretically correct. However, in most cases, a simpler mixture model essentially does as well. The simple mixture model, which assumes independence between the two distinct series, is a special case for the joint model; it provided a good description of {{the distribution of the}} <b>annual</b> <b>maxima</b> above some critical probability, when in our case the risk due to rainfall floods dominated. That critical probability is determined by the distribution of each population, and also the correlation between them. A method recommended by William Kirby uses only the events recorded in the <b>annual</b> <b>maximum</b> series to develop conditional flood risk models for both processes; the resulting flood risk model for the <b>annual</b> <b>maximum</b> series is a weighted function of the two. When compared to use of a single 3 -parameter lognormal model, the Kirby Method usually provide more precise estimates of flood quantiles. Overall, for many cases and for extreme quantiles, both the just-rainfall model that models only rainfall, and the mixture model that assumes rainfall and snowmelt maxima are independent, provide flood quantile estimates that are as accurate as use of the full Joint model...|$|R
