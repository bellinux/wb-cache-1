5|$|Although the {{suffrage}} {{movement in}} Wales attempted {{to show a}} level of independence, it was always following rather than leading a national agenda. It depended deeply in its embryonic years on celebrated suffragists from outside its borders to bring crowds to town meetings, but still relied on a network of now forgotten non-militant supporters who organised and campaigned on the ground level. And, although failing to significantly draw a rural Welsh-speaking heartland to its cause, it still embraced a national sense of pride <b>and</b> <b>values</b> <b>that</b> contrasted to their neighbours in England.|$|E
5|$|This {{subfield}} {{of sociology}} studies, broadly, {{the dynamics of}} war, conflict resolution, peace movements, war refugees, conflict resolution and military institutions. As a subset of this subfield, military sociology aims towards the systematic study of the military as a social group {{rather than as an}} organization. It is a highly specialized sub-field which examines issues related to service personnel as a distinct group with coerced collective action based on shared interests linked to survival in vocation and combat, with purposes <b>and</b> <b>values</b> <b>that</b> are more defined and narrow than within civil society. Military sociology also concerns civilian-military relations and interactions between other groups or governmental agencies. Topics include the dominant assumptions held by those in the military, changes in military members' willingness to fight, military unionization, military professionalism, the increased utilization of women, the military industrial-academic complex, the military's dependence on research, and the institutional and organizational structure of military.|$|E

25|$|In two journal {{articles}} published in 1904–05, German sociologist Max Weber propounded a thesis that Reformed (i.e., Calvinist) Protestantism had engendered the character traits <b>and</b> <b>values</b> <b>that</b> under-girded modern capitalism. The English translation of these articles were published in book form in 1930 as The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism. Weber argued that capitalism in northern Europe evolved because the Protestant (particularly Calvinist) ethic influenced {{large numbers of people}} to engage in work in the secular world, developing their own enterprises and engaging in trade and the accumulation of wealth for investment. In other words, the Protestant work ethic was a force behind an unplanned and uncoordinated mass action that influenced the development of capitalism.|$|E

25|$|Related to card {{shuffling}} {{are several}} other problems of counting special kinds of permutations {{that are also}} answered by the Bell numbers. For instance, the nth Bell number equals number of permutations on n items in which no three values that are in sorted order have the last two of these three consecutive. In a notation for generalized permutation patterns where values that must be consecutive are written adjacent to each other, <b>and</b> <b>values</b> <b>that</b> can appear non-consecutively are separated by a dash, these permutations {{can be described as}} the permutations that avoid the pattern 1-23. The permutations that avoid the generalized patterns 12-3, 32-1, 3-21, 1-32, 3-12, 21-3, and 23-1 are also counted by the Bell numbers. The permutations in which every 321 pattern (without restriction on consecutive values) can be extended to a 3241 pattern are also counted by the Bell numbers. However, the Bell numbers grow too quickly to count the permutations that avoid a pattern that has not been generalized in this way: by the (now proven) Stanley–Wilf conjecture, the number of such permutations is singly exponential, and the Bell numbers have a higher asymptotic growth rate than that.|$|E
500|$|Rimsky-Korsakov {{added that}} [...] "during the {{following}} years, when visiting St. Petersburg, [...] usually came to Balakirev's, {{and we saw}} him." [...] Nevertheless, as much as Tchaikovsky may have desired acceptance from both The Five and the traditionalists, he needed the independence that Moscow afforded to find his own direction, away from both parties. This was especially true in light of Rimsky-Korsakov's comment about the [...] "considerable barrier" [...] of Tchaikovsky's Conservatory training, as well as Anton Rubinstein's opinion that Tchaikovsky had strayed {{too far from the}} examples of the great Western masters. Tchaikovsky was ready for the nourishment of new attitudes and styles so he could continue growing as a composer, and his brother Modest writes that he was impressed by the [...] "force and vitality" [...] in some of the Five's work. However, he was too balanced an individual to totally reject the best in the music <b>and</b> <b>values</b> <b>that</b> Zaremba and Rubinstein had cherished. In his brother Modest's opinion, Tchaikovsky's relations with the Saint Petersburg group resembled [...] "those between two friendly neighboring states ... cautiously prepared to meet on common ground, but jealously guarding their separate interests".|$|E
500|$|Evra {{was born}} in Dakar, {{the capital city of}} Senegal, to a father of Guinean descent and Juliette, a Cape Verdean mother. He is one of a total of 25 children, {{although}} two are now deceased. Evra's father was a diplomat and, when Evra was 12 months old, moved to Brussels in Belgium to work at the Senegalese embassy. After over two years living in Belgium, when Evra was three, the family moved to France and settled in Les Ulis, a commune south of Paris. The family first settled in the local Bergeries neighborhood before moving to the Hautes Plaines quarter shortly after. Evra was raised on Senegalese culture <b>and</b> <b>values</b> <b>that</b> quickly became [...] "Westernised". At age 10, he returned to Senegal for a short period, describing the return as [...] "not a good experience" [...] primarily because he ventured back to the country to undergo circumcision. He had not returned to the country as of 2011. Ahead of the 2010 World Cup, Evra revealed he had suffered racial abuse from supporters of the Senegal national team for choosing to represent France internationally over his country of birth. Evra is allergic to eggs, a condition which he did not discover until an examination by Juventus.|$|E

500|$|A {{few years}} later, Griswold {{moved back to}} New York City, leaving his younger {{daughter}} {{in the care of}} the Myers family and his elder daughter, Emily, with relatives on her mother's side. He had by now earned the nickname [...] "Grand Turk", and in the summer of 1847 made plans to edit an anthology of poetry by American women. He believed that women were incapable of the same kind of [...] "intellectual" [...] poetry as men and believed they needed to be divided: [...] "The conditions of aesthetic ability in the two sexes are probably distinct, or even opposite", he wrote in his introduction. The selections he chose for The Female Poets of America were not necessarily the greatest examples of poetry but instead were chosen because they emphasized traditional morality <b>and</b> <b>values.</b> <b>That</b> same year, Griswold began working on what he considered [...] "the maximum opus of his life", an extensive biographical dictionary. Although he worked on it for several years and even advertised for it, it was never produced. He also helped Elizabeth F. Ellet publish her book Women of the American Revolution, and was angered when she did not acknowledge his assistance in the book. In July 1848, he visited poet Sarah Helen Whitman in Providence, Rhode Island, although he had been suffering with vertigo and exhaustion, rarely leaving his apartment at New York University, and was unable to write without taking opium. In autumn of that year, he had an epileptic fit, the first of many he would suffer for the remainder of his life. One fit caused him to fall out of a ferry in Brooklyn and nearly drown. He wrote to publisher James T. Fields: [...] "I am in a terrible condition, physically and mentally. I do not know what the end will be... I am exhaustedbetwixt life and deathand heaven and hell." [...] In 1849, he was further troubled when Charles Fenno Hoffman, with whom he had become good friends, was committed to an insane asylum.|$|E

He is heavily influenced by the theories of various left-wing social movements and social justice leaders.

It is a large campus like facility that currently houses a maximum of 120 juveniles in a treatment environment plus ten beds utilized for regional observation and assessment and special management. There are 6 different residential cottages and 15 other buildings that include several educational buildings, a large food service area, gymnasium, administration building, laundry, and a chapel. There are many areas dedicated to outdoor recreation such as a large soccer area, softball diamond, outdoor basketball court, and a state-of-the art challenge course, with high and low elements. JCC–St. Anthony provides a highly structured, staff-secure program using a [...] model for the custody and treatment of male and female offenders who have a history of various crimes, and have failed in less secure community-based programs and facilities. The JCC–St. Anthony program focuses juveniles on victim and community restoration related to their crimes. The program also offers cognitive skills building to alter their criminal patterns of thought and requires the juveniles to be accountable daily for their behavior and progress through the program. Employees at JCC–St. Anthony are dedicated to helping each of the juveniles that come to the facility. All staff, including all of those who occasionally interact with the juveniles, are trained in the treatment philosophy of the facility and can help the juveniles with their issues. There are many employees who have been employed at the facility for 10 to 25 years, and their experience working with juveniles is invaluable. Staff and juveniles continually work together to create a safe and secure environment that is conducive to making the changes necessary for juveniles to be able to return to their communities with the skills <b>and</b> <b>values</b> <b>that</b> will give them the opportunity to be successful citizens.|$|E
