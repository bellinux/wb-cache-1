In some rich countries, like the US and Japan, artificial exposure is, on average, greater than the natural exposure, due to greater access to medical imaging.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the effects of}} artificial and solar ultraviolet radiation on photosynthesis, growth rate, phototactic orientation and motility of marine phytoplankton. The effects of UV-B (280 - 320 nm) radiation in combination with humic substances, {{as well as the}} ability of the organisms to adapt and/or recover from exposure to UV-B radiation, were also investigated. Phototactic orientation and growth rate were significantly impaired in the dinoflagellate Gyrodinium aureolum, when exposed to <b>artificial</b> UV-B <b>radiation</b> compared to organisms only exposed to photosynthetically active radiation (PAR, 400 - 700 nm). The presence of humic substances during UV-B treatment reduced the inhibition of phototaxis and growth rate in G. aureolum. Four other dinoflagellates, Prorocentrum minimum (Atlantic and Kategatt strains), Heterocapsa triquetra, Amphidinium carterae and a diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum also showed a significant inhibition in growth rate when exposed to <b>artificial</b> UV-B <b>radiation.</b> P. minimum and P. tricornutum cells pre-exposed for over a year to <b>artificial</b> UV-B <b>radiation</b> showed a higher tolerance to short-term UV-B exposure than control organisms. This UV-B tolerance was more pronounced in the diatom species. Motility of H. triquetra and the two strains of P. minimum was decreased by <b>artificial</b> UV-B <b>radiation.</b> Control and UV-B adapted cells of P. minimum, showed similar inhibition in motility with increasing UV-B. However, when the cells were transferred to control conditions (PAR only) for 24 or 48 h, motility partly recovered and the UV-B adapted cells recovered more than the control cells. No significant differences in motility of two strains of P. minimum, kept at different depths in coastal waters, were seen for in situ incubations with or without natural solar UV radiation. Oxygen evolution and carbon uptake measurements were used {{to determine the effects of}} solar and artificial UVR on photosynthesis in both natural phytoplankton populations and in laboratory cultured monocultures. Carbon uptake in natural phytoplankton communities was inhibited by solar UVR. At a depth of 50 cm in coastal waters, UV-B radiation was associated with a greater inhibition of photosynthesis than UV-A (320 - 400 nm), but at greater depths there were no significant differences between different light incubations. When laboratory cultured cells from the dinoflagellate P. minimum and the diatom P. tricornutum were exposed to short-term <b>artificial</b> UV-B <b>radiation,</b> both photosynthetic quantum efficiency and saturation level decreased. This was most pronounced for the diatom. Long-term UV-B adapted dinoflagellates incubated under the same <b>artificial</b> UV-B <b>radiation</b> showed an increase in quantum efficiency and also increased tolerance to short-term UV-B exposure compared to control cells.

However, there is ongoing controversy regarding the relevance of occupational exposure to natural and <b>artificial</b> ultraviolet <b>radiation</b> (UV) radiation. OBJECTIVES: We investigated potential associations between natural and <b>artificial</b> UV <b>radiation</b> exposure at work with NMSC in a case-control study conducted in Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia. METHODS: Occupational exposures were classified by expert assessment for 527 controls and 618 NMSC cases (515 basal cell carcinoma, BCC). Covariate information was collected via interview and multiple logistic regression models were used to assess associations between UV exposure and NMSC. RESULTS: Lifetime prevalence of occupational exposure in the participants was 13 % for natural UV radiation and 7 % for <b>artificial</b> UV <b>radiation.</b> Significant negative associations between occupational exposure to natural UV radiation and NMSC were detected for all who had ever been exposed (odds ratio (OR) 0. 47, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 27 - 0. 80); similar results were detected using a semi-quantitative metric of cumulative exposure. The effects were modified by skin complexion, with significantly decreased risks of BCC among participants with light skin complexion. No associations were observed in relation to occupational <b>artificial</b> UV <b>radiation</b> exposure. CONCLUSIONS: The protective effect of occupational exposure to natural UV radiation was unexpected, but limited to light-skinned people, suggesting adequate sun-protection behaviors.
