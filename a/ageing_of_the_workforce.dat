40|$|The {{composition}} of the New Zealand workforce has changed considerably {{over the past two}} decades. Qualification levels have risen, labour force participation has trended upwards for women, immigrants have increasingly been sourced from Asia, and the large baby-boom cohort has contributed to an <b>ageing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>workforce.</b> The question is whether such compositional changes have affected the quality of labour. Our estimates show a large rise in labour quality since 1988 as a result of increasing qualification levels, particularly at university degree level. With age as a proxy for work experience, an <b>ageing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>workforce</b> also contributed to rising labour quality. The annual rise in labour quality averaged 0. 6 % from 1988 to 2005, which was comparable to the experience of Australia, the United States and the euro area. Although labour quality rose in every year of our sample period, the rise was not constant over time. The increase was much stronger {{in the first half of}} the period (1988 to 1997) than in the second half (1997 to 2005). By drawing a large number of lower-skilled people into work, the strength of recent employment growth may have dampened growth in labour quality. Accounting for changes in labour quality has implications for labour productivity. Almost half of labour productivity growth of 1. 4 % per annum since 1988 can be attributed to the rise in labour quality. Labour productivity measured as output per quality-adjusted working hour rose by 0. 8 % per annum on average from 1988 to 2005, with annual growth of 0. 5 % in the first half of the period and 1. 1 % in the second half.

Nevertheless, a large percentage of workers in the EU do not stay in employment until the official retirement age. The reasons for this are diverse, and will be examined in more detail in this report. Policy-makers are faced with the challenge of addressing this demographic change and its implications for employment, working conditions, living standards and the sustainability of welfare states. The working conditions of older workers and their participation in the labour market are affected by various policy areas (see also Table 1).

40|$|Purpose: This paper {{examines}} employers’ {{perceptions of}} {{changes of the}} labour cost-productivity gap due to the <b>ageing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>workforce,</b> the effects of tenure wages and employment protect ion on the perceived gap and whether a perceived labour cost-productivity gap affects employers’ recruitment and retention behaviour towards older workers. Methodology: We analyze surveys administered to employers in Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland and Sweden. Findings: Approximately half of the employers associate the ageing of the personnel staff with a growing gap between labour costs and productivity. Both the presence of tenure wages and employment protection rules increase the probability that employers perceive a widening labour cost–productivity gap due to the ageing of their workforce. A counterfactual shows that even when employment protection and tenure wage systems are abolished 40 percent of the employers expect a net cost increase. The expected labour cost-productivity gap negatively affects both recruitment and retention of older workers.

Based on a simple descriptive review of selected key data sources, it outlines key labour market trends in the UK, with particular emphasis on the changing industrial and occupational profile of employment, before highlighting {{the implications of these}} changes for skill needs. In particular, the growing importance of computing skills, customer care skills and team-working skills is emphasised. Against this background, the role of demography, alongside changes in participation, in influencing workforce size is outlined. It is stressed that ageing is an issue for all age groups - not merely for older workers. However, it is pointed out that retirements are a key factor in changing labour demand, serving to create new job openings in declining sectors. It is concluded that changing labour market trends and the intensification of skills pose challenges for all workers, and especially older workers, in terms of upgrading their skills throughout their working lives. ...|$|E

A substantial portion of these changes are caused by the <b>ageing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>workforce</b> and the decline in the entry rate of new employer businesses. We show that the tenure distribution is a function of historical hiring rates and tenure-specific separation rates, and we use this framework to show that the shift in the tenure distribution is accounted for primarily by declines in the hiring rate, which are concentrated in the labor market downturns associated with the 2001 and 2007 - 2009 recessions. We also find that the increase in average real earnings since 2007 is less than what would be predicted by the shift toward longer-tenure jobs; this reflects declines in tenure-held-constant real earnings.

The {{changing nature of}} the workforce and increasing demand mean that these shortages are unlikely to ease. This study aims to identify demographic change and retirement patterns of the Australian psychiatry workforce from 1995 to 2003, {{and the implications of}} those changes for future workforce planning. Methods Data from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) Medical Labour Force Survey from 1995 to 2003 is used to examine ageing of the psychiatry workforce and attrition of psychiatrists aged 50 years and over. Future attrition from the workforce is projected to 2025. Results Sixty two percent of psychiatrists practicing in the year 2000 are predicted to have retired by 2025.
