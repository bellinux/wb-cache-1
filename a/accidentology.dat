40|$|For the {{development}} of effective vehicle-related safety solutions to improve cyclist and pedestrian protection, essential information on impact locations, impact situations and cyclist and pedestrian kinematics in impacts with passenger cars is fundamental. <b>Accidentology</b> research showed that cyclists typically have a higher impact location, with {{a larger share of}} injuries from the windscreen area. Majority of accidents happened at crossroads (72 % of the Dutch cases). The average car speed was 36 kph, the median bicycle speed 14 kph. A cyclist simulation study captured kinematics and injuries to head, torso, pelvis and legs for several human body sizes, bicycle types and generic car models. Six full-scale crash tests (passenger car versus cyclist or pedestrian (Polar II dummy) had as main parameters: head impact location (top of bonnet, windscreen, A-pillar), vehicle speed (40 kph) and dummy speed (15 kph). <b>Accidentology,</b> simulation and crash test data showed that the windscreen is a frequent head and torso impact location. <b>Accidentology</b> and crash testing showed that cyclist protection should address higher, more rearward locations in the windscreen area than pedestrian countermeasures.

40|$|Introduction: The {{purpose of}} this study is to assess the impact of communes size on the number and {{severity}} of tram accidents in France. Methodology: For this we calculated the average densities of accidents and serious victims of trams per line kilometer for each class of commune between 2012 and 2014. While adverting to the official data of <b>accidentology</b> and population. Results: The study has shown that almost one third of the municipalities served by the tram have known no accident. The study also showed that the size of the communes is proportional to the accidents density per kilometer of the tram line. The study has also concluded that the density of serious victims per line kilometer is maximum in the communes of average size. Conclusion: To carry out the modal shift toward the urban public transport, it is necessary to deepen our knowledge of the specificities of insecurity of these modes.

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} the work conducted within work package (WP) 5 "Verification of test matrix and protocol" of the Cyclist AEB testing system (CATS) project. It describes the verification {{process of the}} draft CATS test matrix resulting from WP 1 and WP 2, and the feasibility of meeting requirements set by CATS consortium based on requirements in Euro NCAP AEB protocols regarding accuracy, repeatability and reproducibility using the developed test hardware. For the cases where verification tests or additional information indicated that the protocol needed adaptation, proposed changes were discussed and upon agreement amongst the partners provided to the matrix including supporting argumentation. In WP 1 the relevant accident scenarios have been determined, where in WP 2 the most relevant accident parameters were extracted from <b>accidentology</b> and an additional observation study. Using these sources of information, a draft CATS test matrix has been developed. This draft CATS test matrix {{was used as a}} basis for the verification process. The process included workshops where all partners of the CATS consortium have been given the possibility to test the scenarios, a full spec test series was performed with a vehicle including a Cyclist-AEB system. Furthermore simulation studies were done and a robustness test series was performed to check the accuracies of the test protocol and the practical usability of the test equipment. Verification tests and simulations revealed that both the near-side CVNBU crossing scenario with 0 % overlap and the far-side CVFB with 50 % overlap crossing scenario were approximately equally difficult in terms of feasibility. It was therefore decided to change the collision point in the CVNBU test to 50 % instead of 0 % and the collision point in the CVFB scenario from 50 % to 25 %. Both changes still correspond to the parameters found in <b>accidentology.</b> This creates a two-step approach in terms of difficulty where the CVNBU is now less challenging and the CVFB more challenging. Furthermore it was found in the tests that the lateral accuracy of the target remains a challenge, especially for the longitudinal scenario with a long single belt. As a result, the collision point in the longitudinal scenario is changed from 20 % to 25 % since it is important that cyclist remains inside the width of the vehicle in terms of trigger an AEB activation. This still corresponds to the parameters found in <b>accidentology...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract This article {{surveys the}} work {{of one of the}} most {{prominent}} theorists of accidents today, Paul Virilio. Particular focus is given to the May 6, 2010, Flash Crash. This event is used to measure the worth of Virilio’s <b>accidentology,</b> as it is viewed as a harbinger of the integral accident, a catastrophic incident that is experienced simultaneously and universally. While Virilio is supported for drawing attention to the technologically mediated accidents that threaten hyperconnected societies, his method and focus are found wanting. His preference for suggestion over qualification means that he eschews empirical elaboration, and his fixation on the political economy of speed proceeds without reference to a political economy of wealth. This asymmetry results in grand theorizing about general conditions that do not exist, and it overlooks the ways in which accidents, crises, and disasters are endemic to the economic system...|$|E

30|$|In {{the last}} decade European <b>accidentology</b> data, divided per mode of transport, have shown the {{increasing}} relevance of safety for Vulnerable Road User (VRU).

The European Community has promoted and co-financed several research projects to promote {{the development and implementation of}} viable technical solutions to reduce fatalities and mitigate accident consequences. Most of the proposed devices and systems require the interaction with the rider through Human Machine Interface (HMI) devices. This work focuses on the design of an innovative haptic HMI device to communicate information/warnings to the rider in a reliable and intuitive way. An in-depth state of the art on HMI devices for PTWs is presented.

The objectives of this article are to demonstrate the existence of socio-spatial inequalities in terms of traffic safety and to examine the reduction of inequalities in urban renewal projects. Through an analysis of laws, projects and the words of local authorities, safety issues in urban renewal programs are analyzed. While security is incorporated implicitly in urban development, the increase of spatial justice in terms of safety is not maximized.

40|$|Les carnets du LabEx ITEMThe {{effectiveness}} of sport accidents prevention is often considered {{in terms of}} communication strategies, in relation with the good enunciation, the correct reception, and ideally, the appropriation of prevention messages and safe methods by participants. The accuracy of these strategies depends on thorough knowledge of accident frequencies, of typical circumstances and risk factors, and {{of the origins of}} accident sequences (Bahr & Krosshaug, 2005; Rasmussen & Svedung, 2000). Unfortunately, according to recent studies on mountain leisure and recreation (Soulé et al., 2014), the knowledge of accident facts, causes, and consequences in mountain sports seems perfectible. More than the quantity of information produced, sometimes important, the fragmentation of sources, the heterogeneous methodologies used to collect information, and the data availability, are problematic for a meaningful use of accident data. Corporative, institutional, methodological or judicial stakes are pregnant when it comes to accidents and can partly explain this fragmented picture of <b>accidentology</b> (Soulé et al., 2015) ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{prototype}} of a system designed to analyze road accidents is presented. The analysis is carried out in order to recog- nize within accident reports general mechanisms of road accidents that represent prototypes of road accidents. Case Based Reasoning (CBR) is the chosen problem solving paradigm. Natural language documents and semi-structured documents are used to build the cases of our sys- tem, which creates a di±culty. To cope with this di±culty we propose approaches integrating semantic resources. Hence, an ontology of acci- dentology and a terminology of road accidents are used to build cases. The alignment of two resources supports the retrieval process. A data processing model, based on models of <b>accidentology,</b> is proposed to rep- resent the cases of the system. This paper presents the architecture of ACCTOS (ACCident TO Scenarios), a case based reasoning system pro- totype.

40|$|International audienceAccidents are {{notoriously}} frequent in mountain sports – {{also referred to}} as risk sports. For example, the NSOSM 1 recorded 5389 rescue operations in the French mountains in 2012 (excluding ski resort areas). Similarly, in Switzerland, the total number of fatal accidents recorded during hiking, mountaineering and ski touring represents half of all accidental deaths during the practice of sports in the broader sense (Bianchi & Brügger, 2013). The effectiveness of preventive approaches depends on thorough knowledge of typical circumstances, of the origins of accident sequences, and of the main risk factors and consequences (Bahr & Krosshaug, 2005; Rasmussen & Svedung, 2000). Unfortunately, the <b>accidentology</b> of mountain sports appears quite underdeveloped in France, partly because of data availability limitations, fragmentation of sources, heterogeneous methodologies, corporative, institutional, and judicial stakes (Soulé & al., 2014). With this in mind, we present in this communication the opportunities offered by experience feedback methods as used in industrial settings, applied to accident sequences but also to incidents or near-misses. The study of close calls, or incidentology, allows lessening certain issues or blocks to accident reporting and appears as a somewhat dedramatized way to improve knowledge of accident sequences. It consists in grasping the preventive value of problematic situations, which could have escalated to 1 National System for the Observation of Safety in Mountain areas: aggregation of mountain interventions carried out by the various specialized rescue services. an accident but where worse outcomes have been avoided, without having to face the emotional and juridical charge inherent to accidents. Moreover, incidents, much more frequent than accidents, not to say commonplace, provide a greater pool of data to comprehend <b>accidentology</b> from. Experience feedback is a process composed of various steps: collecting and memorising information on accidents, treatment of this data, transmission of the results in order to share the experience thus formulated (Valancogne, 2002; Bal & Kappès-Grangé, 2002). Accident reporting and feedback on accidents has a long history in North America where, to only cite the most famous, Accident in North American Mountaineering (ANAM) publishes reports every year from the American Alpine Club (AAC) and the Alpine Club of Canada (ACC). Although all the existing accident and incident reporting systems provide interesting insights on accident sequences, most of them lack detailed information on the situations to enable thorough analysis of the data, and thus meaningful experience sharing and preventive approaches improvement. After having detailed the theoretical and conceptual background of experience feedback methods and of incidentology, we will intend to offer a comprehensive, international overview of existing accident and near-miss reporting systems in the field of mountain sports. Secondly, based on the presented systems and on cyndynics theories, we will propose general recommendations to create a comprehensive accident and incident reporting system to allow indepth, multi-factors and system-based analysis of reports. This applied research constitutes, on one hand, an innovation as to the methods that were used; on the other hand, it constitutes in itself a social innovation, since it currently results in the implementation of an online, open-access, participative platform enhancing the preventive use of gathered experience feedbacks. With the support of 2 Sciences of danger, such institutions as the Petzl Foundation and the Camptocamp community, it eventually aims to provide an alternative way of improving the prevention of accidents in mountain areas. Like most innovations, {{the success or failure of}} this alternative system, and its actual contribution to the <b>accidentology</b> of mountain sports, will greatly depend on the appropriation of the platform currently designed, a major stake in the coming months...|$|E
30|$|In {{the last}} decade European <b>accidentology</b> data have shown a {{significant}} reduction {{of the total number}} of fatalities, as a consequence of improvements achieved in the sector of car safety.

40|$|Abstract—Existing {{methods of}} data mining cannot be applied on spatial data because they require spatial {{specificity}} consideration, as spatial relationships. This paper {{focuses on the}} classification with decision trees, which {{are one of the}} data mining techniques. We propose an extension of the C 4. 5 algorithm for spatial data, based on two different approaches Join materialization and Querying on the fly the different tables. Similar works have been done on these two main approaches, the first- Join materialization- favors the processing time in spite of memory space, whereas the second- Querying on the fly different tables- promotes memory space despite of the processing time. The modified C 4. 5 algorithm requires three entries tables: a target table, a neighbor table, and a spatial index join that contains the possible spatial relationship among the objects in the target table and those in the neighbor table. Thus, the proposed algorithms are applied to a spatial data pattern in the <b>accidentology</b> domain.

40|$|<b>Accidentology</b> or shock {{biomechanics}} are research domains mainly {{devoted to}} the development of safety conditions for the users of various transport modes in case of an accident.

We aimed at establishing the relationship between the level of muscular activity prior to impact, called 'preactivation', of the lower limb extensors and the mechanical characteristics of impact. Relationships were described between the level of preactivation, the impact peak force values, the minimum force after unloading and the associated loading and unloading rates. The existence of reflex mechanisms that were affected by the level of voluntary muscular preactivation for the lower limb muscles was demonstrated. In conclusion, the existence of specific mechanism acting mainly at the knee level may result from the level of preactivation.

40|$|Gender {{differences}} in <b>accidentology,</b> notably on roads, are well documented and current research in social psychology tends to explain these differences by gender stereotypes, notably {{the association of}} risk-taking with social expectations concerning masculinity.

Beliefs about driving by men and women, {{as well as the}} effect of the age and gender of the perceiver, were explored using the free association method with 599 preadolescents and adolescents between 10 and 16 years of age. The results show that gender stereotypes are indeed associated with driving from the age of 10. While the representation of male drivers is already stable at this age, the representation of female drivers appears to develop with age. Furthermore, there is a notable in-group serving bias, but only among girls.

40|$|From 2018, AEB systems {{dedicated}} to avoid or mitigate car-to-cyclist collisions {{will be included}} in the safety assessment by Euro NCAP [1] & [2]. To test such systems, appropriate equipment and a test procedure are being developed in the project CATS (Cyclist-AES Testing System). <b>Accidentology</b> was used to determine the most common car-to-cyclist accident scenarios in the EU (3]. The testing setup has been developed to deal with the 3 most relevant scenarios: a cyclist crossing the path of the car from the nearside, a cyclist crossing the path of the car from the farside, and a longitudinal scenario in which the car and cyclist are driving in the same direction, and the car drives into the cyclist from the rear. The test equipment should be capable to deal with these 3 scenarios. Apart from the scenarios, the typical AEB systems and the applied sensors by the car manufacturers should recognize the dummy as a real cyclist on a bike, which puts important requirements regarding dummy visual and radar characteristics. Finally, requirements to the design of the testing system and dummy result from practical testing constraints: during testing, possible collisions between car and dummy should be mild to limit damage for the dummy and the vehicle under test, and not to compromise the testing.

40|$|Abstract- Cycling {{supports}} the independence {{and health of}} the aging population. However, elderly cyclists have an increased injury risk. The majority of injured cyclists is victim of a single-sided accident, an accident {{in which there is}} no other party involved [1]. The aim of the project ‘Safe and Aware on the bicycle ’ is to develop guidelines for an advisory system that is useful in preventing single-sided accidents. This system is able to support the elderly cyclist; enabling the cyclist to timely adapt his cycling behaviour and improve cycling safety and comfort. For the development of such advisory system the causes of singles accidents and the wishes of the elderly cyclist must be known. First step to obtain this insight was an literature survey and an GIDAS research. Unfortunately <b>accidentology</b> research with GIDAS did not give the full understanding of the pre-crash situations and (especially the behaviour related) factors leading to the accident. The second step was consultation of elderly cyclist through a questionnaire (n= 800), in-depth interviews (n= 12) and focus group sessions (n= 15). This offered complementary information and a much better understanding of the behavioural aspects. Results concern the behaviour in traffic and identify specific physical (i. e. problems looking backwards over the shoulder) and mental issues. Furthermore, the needs and wishes for support in specific cycling situations were identified. In conclusion; The GIDAS results together with the information obtained contacting the elderly cyclists enabled setting up requirements for an advisory system, which is useful in preventing single-sided accident...|$|E

40|$|AbstractPrevious European research, i. e. COST 331 and the IMPROVER {{projects}} {{had demonstrated}} that road markings greatly increase driver comfort during dry night time conditions. Nevertheless, they highlighted {{the need for}} additional research under wet and wet and rainy conditions. Building upon this research, the RAINVISION project has investigated {{over the last three years}} how road markings can influence driver behaviour under all nightime weather conditions (dry, wet and wet and rainy) and how different age groups and gender groups adapt their behaviour based on the visibility and retro-reflectivity of road markings. The project has carried out three different trials; i. e. a simulation trial in France, a track test trial in Austria and on-road trial in the United Kingdom in cooperation with local authorities. For the simulation and track test trials, more than 100 test subjects were recruited respectively according to three age groups (20 – 40, 41 – 60 and 61 + years) and took several trials during different conditions. For the on-road trials, 10 high-risk sites were selected in cooperation with Durham county and Type II marking materials were applied in these sections. The project subsequently monitored speed over a whole climatic cycle and undertook an <b>accidentology</b> analysis. The results of the study in general indicate that the presence of enhanced road markings did significantly increase driver comfort, especially for older drivers. While there was an increase in driver speed, it was not seen as safety hazard as it was compensated by greater preview times.

40|$|Worldwide the {{popularity}} of cycling is booming due to its many positive impacts on health, environment and accessibility. Unfortunately, in most traffic systems cyclists are exposed {{to high levels of}} road risks. In 2014, more than 2000 cyclist deaths were recorded in the EU alone. Many more were seriously injured, but their actual numbers or reliable estimates of it are not available. Today, even in a cycling friendly country like the Netherlands - frequently serving as a model for cycle promotion elsewhere - about a third of all road fatalities {{and more than half of}} all serious road injuries are cyclists. Whereas in the last decades huge safety gains have been achieved for car occupants, up to now protection of cyclists has been far less successful. Yet, policies to protect cyclists are scarce. Research fundamental for the development of such policies is still in its infancy and hampered by many limitations, such as incomplete data on bicycle crashes, lack of funding and focus, as well as shortcomings in methods suitable for research on bicycle safety. From 30. 302 papers on traffic safety indexed in Science Direct for the years 2012 — 2016, only 7. 8 % dealt with the safety of cycling. On a more positive note, the growing numbers of participants in the International Conference on Cycling safety (ICSC) indicates that the tables are about to turn. In its fourth edition in 2015 in Hannover, the ICSC welcomed 114 participants from 24 countries and about 50 papers were presented. Based on a selection of these papers, this special issue ‘Improving cyclist safety through scientific research’ provides a platform for recent developments in cycling research.

We soughtto study the epidemiology and <b>accidentology</b> of such rescues. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical reports of a singlehelicopter-based emergency medical service. Data from 1 January 2003 to 31 December 2008 were analyzed. Cases with emergency callindicating that the victim was deceased were excluded. Data includedthe age and gender of the patients, the type of patients activitypreceeding the injury, the mecanism of injury, and the type of lesions(main diagnosis). Results: 9879 rescue missions were conducted between 1 January 2003 and 31 December 2008. The 921 (9. 3 %) missions involvingwinching of the emergency physician were analysed. The male:femaleratio of the patients was 2 : 1. There were 56 (6 %) patients aged 15 orunder. Most of the patients, while injured, were practising winter sportsor mountain-related activities in the summer (table 1). Falls accountedfor the great majority of the trauma events (700 patients or 76 %),followed by illnesses (81 patients or 9 %). Of the 921 missions in whichthe physician was winched in the field, 28 (3 %) were avalanche rescuesand 13 (1 %) were glacier crevasse rescues. Trauma to the upper andlower extremities accounted for 429 (47 %) of all injuries, followed by 175 (19 %) head injuries and 108 (12 %) spinal lesions. Hypothermia,frostbite and altitude illnesses were diagnosed in 11 (1 %) cases. In 128 (14 %) cases two different diagnoses were made, and in 69 (7 %) threeor more diagnoses. Conclusions: In our helicopter emergency base, between 2003 and 2008, 921 rescue missions (9. 3 %) involved winching of the emergencydoctor. Patients rescued using the winch usually practice outdoorsports, and are predominantly male. The mechanism of the injury isusually a fall, and extremities and head injuries account for more than 50 % of the main diagnosis made on the field...|$|E
40|$|From 2018, AEB systems {{dedicated}} to avoid or mitigate passenger car-to-cyclist collisions {{will be considered}} in the safety assessment by Euro NCAP. To test such systems, appropriate equipment has been developed in the project CATS “Cyclist-AEB Testing System. ” Moreover, the project dealt with setting up a proposal for the most relevant test scenarios. The objective of the project was to provide proof of the relevance of the proposed test scenarios and of the feasibility of practical implementation of the scenarios and test setup to Euro NCAP. <b>Accidentology</b> was used to determine the most common car-to-cyclist accident scenarios in the EU. The test setup has been developed to deal with the three most relevant scenarios: two scenarios for a cyclist crossing the path of the car (from the near side and the far side), and a longitudinal scenario in which the car drives into the cyclist from the rear. Requirements regarding a soft cyclist target have been set up. These consider target visual and radar characteristics as typical AEB systems and the applied sensors should recognize the target as a real cyclist on a bike. Moreover, requirements to the design of the testing system and target result from practical testing constraints: during testing, possible collisions between car and target should be mild without compromising the testing. A target and target propulsion system were constructed to meet these requirements. Accident data and data from observation studies were used to determine the parameter ranges in the proposed test matrix for the selected test scenarios. Together with car manufacturers and suppliers, a test matrix has been proposed and a testing setup including cyclist target has been built. In several test series, the test setup and the protocol were verified. Verification considered not only the capability of the protocol to distinguish between well-performing and less-performing AEB systems, but also the reproducibility and repeatability of the tests. Also the practical use of the system and the target were tested. The CATS project was unique in the fact that developments were performed in a consortium of 10 car manufacturers and 7 automotive suppliers, with BASt as review partner. This has stimulated the harmonization and acceptance of the protocol, target and test setup. The progress and intermediate results including the used methodology have been shared on a regular basis during the project with stakeholders in Europe, Japan and the USA. Euro NCAP already indicated to consider the results of the CATS project as the main input to draft the test protocol, including scenarios and target for Cyclist-AEB systems in 2018...|$|E
40|$|Electric Vehicles (EVs) have {{experienced}} an incredible fast evolution. In {{the last few}} years almost every car manufacturer has presented its own EV prototype or fully functional vehicle and developing dedicated vehicles instead of the classical "General Purpose" concept is becoming more common. Most Electric Light Trucks existing already in the market still adopt the classic powertrain lay-out used in thermal engine vehicles. The EC co-funded OPTIBODY project is developing new modular structure architecture for a European L 7 e category vehicle focused on safety improvement and exploring the capabilities of modularity applied to safety and reparability. The OPTIBODY vehicle has been designed using a modular structure architecture composed of a chassis, a cabin and several add-ons. The cabin will provide improved levels of comfort, protection and ergonomics to the user and the addons will provide protection in case of frontal, side and rear impact, including also crash compatibility and interaction with vulnerable road users. Europe, U. S. A., Canada, Japan and Australia were targeted for the initial analysis of the electric light vehicle worldwide situation to achieve the objectives of the project. The current light trucks fleet, <b>accidentology</b> and the requirements to be fulfilled by the vehicles were analyzed in the previous regions. The chassis, the cabin and the materials and a modular concept to improve self and partner protection safety. The thermal engine has been removed and substituted by electrical inwheels engines, and the extra space has been use to improve frontal impact and vulnerable road users protection. The requirements for certification of both L 7 e and low-speed vehicle categories in Europe and North America are very low in terms of safety and there is no mandatory crash test to evaluate neither pedestrian protection nor impact performance. OPTIBODY project has proposed frontal, side, rear and pedestrian impact tests and they have been use as targets to design the OPTIBODY vehicle to improve self and partner protection. Frontal crash test simulations showed an improvement in the cabin integrity and self and partner protection, as well as an improved pedestrian protection due to the extra space available, the use of new materials and the design of the add-on. The OPTIBODY vehicle adhered to the US commitment of Part 581 Zone, improving the crash compatibility of the vehicle. The use of modular architectures and new materials also improved the reparability of the vehicle. The OPTIBODY project is developing a new modular architecture for L 7 e vehicles that will provide an improvement in self and partner protection and reparability. Modularity has been only considered in this vehicle category and its applicability to other categories should be considered. L 7 e vehicles in Europe and low speed vehicles in the US have very poor safety requirements for certification. The OPTIBODY project is a good opportunity so show a great improvement in self and partner protection for L 7 e vehicles and also to explore how electric vehicles can improve the current levels of safety and the benefits of applying modularity to safety and reparability field...|$|E
40|$|The OPTIBODY {{project is}} focused on {{developing}} new modular structure architectures for electric light trucks and vans (ELTVs) which will improve the passive safety of the vehicle to help {{reduce the number of}} fatalities and severe injuries. The new concept will develop a structure composed of a chassis, a cabin that includes improved levels of comfort, protection and ergonomics of the user, a number of add-ons that provide protection in case of impact or rollover and also covering the topic of crash compatibility, including a good amount of the interaction with vulnerable road users. To achieve the objectives, an initial analysis of the ELTVs that are found on today's markets is being made. Selected markets include Europe, U. S. A., Japan and Australia Together with an in-depth review on <b>accidentology</b> of these vehicles and a state-of-the-art research, a basis of requirements will be established. This is the starting point of the project, from which the first results have delimited the study to only L 7 e category vehicles (light urban delivery vehicles). These requirements will include legal aspects to be covered in the terms of passive safety, homologation, reparability and the integration of structural add-ons for added safety. Special attention is paid also to energy storage solutions, frontal and lateral compatibility, new design guidelines adequate to feasible solutions and new materials and processes. All the work {{is focused on}} improving all aspects considering the incoming electric vehicle technologies, which can be adequately applied in a very near future. All the work done will be exemplified {{at the end of the}} project by the demonstration of the designed add-ons and systems with a pilot demonstrator vehicle. This vehicle will show the developed chassis and cabin concept, complemented by different add-ons that could be utilized throughout different markets. Complimentary, the entire process is to be documented and a specialized publication with the best practices will be made available to the interested public, especially designers and vehicle manufacturers. With this attempt, the OPTIBODY project will provide new and improved safety systems for a segment of vehicles which do not take into account the same requirements as "regular" N 1 category vehicles and which have shown to have a large percentage of fatalities on the road, including pedestrian incidents. This study has been limited to a selected type and category of vehicle, the L 7 e category (in Europe). The characteristics of these vehicles make them quite unique, since their low weight and low power make them apt only for urban driving and are widely used by goods delivery companies, urban services, etc. the requirements for their homologation are lower in terms of structure and safety, including pedestrian protection, hence the objective of this project to improve protection for occupants and vulnerable users. High accident rates with fatalities and severe injuries have been found for these vehicles. The OPTIBODY project is a pioneer enterprise in terms of improving safety in selected vehicle categories which have been traditionally less developed than regular cars or heavy goods vehicles. This approach will lead to an improvement in safety for all road users while interacting with these urban vehicles, which have less strict requirements than the rest. It is important to adequately design a chassis and body for the new upcoming electric technologies which now pose different risks in various aspects, such as energy storage, dynamics and accident behaviour. In general, the approach taken during this project will generate new and innovative ideas on the way that vehicles are designed and built with the use of electrical energy for their power. The risks of electrical mobility are being tackled as we speak, and the technological solutions that will be developed will improve the safety on our roads...|$|E
