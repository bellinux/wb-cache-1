25|$|Naegele's rule is a {{standard}} way of calculating the due date for a pregnancy when assuming a gestational age of 280 days at childbirth. The rule estimates the expected date of delivery (EDD) by adding a year, subtracting three months, and adding seven days to the origin of gestational age. Alternatively there are mobile apps, which essentially <b>always</b> <b>give</b> consistent estimations compared {{to each other and}} correct for leap year, while pregnancy wheels made of paper can differ from each other by 7 days and generally do not correct for leap year.|$|E
25|$|Electrotype {{was also}} used to {{manufacture}} matrices {{that could be used}} as moulds for individual pieces of metal type. This had several advantages over traditional punchcutting in hard steel: the type master only needed to be carved out of soft metal, and was also useful for large sizes of type, since it was hard to drive large punches into a matrix effectively. It cut the cost of decorative types that would not be used so often as body text typefaces. On the other hand, it gave no steel punch {{that could be used to}} create multiple matrices quickly, and was reported to not <b>always</b> <b>give</b> such good results as steel punchcutting.|$|E

25|$|The cranium lacks a {{pronounced}} occipital bun in the neck, a bulge that anchored considerable neck muscles in Neanderthals. Modern humans, even the earlier ones, generally {{have a larger}} fore-brain than the archaic people, so that the brain sits above rather than behind the eyes. This will usually (though not <b>always)</b> <b>give</b> a higher forehead, and reduced brow ridge. Early modern people and some living people do however have quite pronounced brow ridges, but they {{differ from those of}} archaic forms by having both a supraorbital foramen or notch, forming a groove through the ridge above each eye. This splits the ridge into a central part and two distal parts. In current humans, often only the central section of the ridge is preserved (if it is preserved at all). This contrasts with archaic humans, where the brow ridge is pronounced and unbroken.|$|E
25|$|Imagine {{a pair of}} {{particles}} that can be measured at distant locations. Suppose that the measurement devices have settings, which are angles—e.g., the devices measure something called spin in some direction. The experimenter chooses the directions, one for each particle, separately. Suppose the measurement outcome is binary (e.g., spin up, spin down). Suppose the two particles are perfectly anti-correlated—in the sense that whenever both measured in the same direction, one gets identically opposite outcomes, when both measured in opposite directions they <b>always</b> <b>give</b> the same outcome. The only way to imagine how this works is that both particles leave their common source with, somehow, the outcomes they will deliver when measured in any possible direction. (How else could particle 1 know how to deliver the same answer as particle 2 when measured in the same direction? They don't know in advance how {{they are going to}} be measured...). The measurement on particle 2 (after switching its sign) can be thought of as telling us what the same measurement on particle 1 would have given.|$|E

In retirement, Windle stayed in the United States for a few more years, working for Allis-Chalmers, an agricultural equipment corporation. He returned home after being transferred to the Australian division of the firm's operations.

500|$|The other {{commonly}} formulated {{generalization of}} Cesàro summation is {{the sequence of}} (C, n) methods. It has been proven that (C, n) summation and (H, n) summation <b>always</b> <b>give</b> the same results, but they have different historical backgrounds. In 1887, Cesàro came close to stating the definition of (C, n) summation, but he gave only a few examples. In particular, he summed [...] to [...] by a method that may be rephrased as (C, n) but was not justified as such at the time. He formally defined the (C, n) methods in 1890 in order to state his theorem that the Cauchy product of a (C, n)-summable series and a (C, m)-summable series is (C, m + n + 1)-summable.|$|E
500|$|Mills' {{management}} style {{was influenced by}} a number of managers he played under, including John Barnwell, Brian Clough, Alan Hinton, Howard Kendall, Brian Little, David Pleat, Russell Slade and Neil Warnock. He learned simplicity from Clough, saying: [...] "He never did complicate anything. Football is a simple game and Cloughie was no coach, he didn't confuse us with sessions straight out of the manual". Like Clough, Mills has been praised for his man management skills and Daren Fulford, his reserve-team manager at Tamworth, said: [...] "If he felt you had made a mistake, he would give you a rollicking but if he was pleased with you he would <b>always</b> <b>give</b> kind words". Fulford also commented on Mills' thoroughness, saying he wanted information on each players' performances after the reserves played.|$|E

Blaine is visibly moved by Kurt's emotional tribute and realizes that he has feelings for Kurt. He later argues that the Warblers shouldn't rely on him alone for Regionals, and proposes that instead of [...] "Misery", the group should feature a duet.

500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the century, the kirk had considerable control over the lives of the people. It had {{a major role in the}} Poor Law and schools, which were administered through the parishes, and over the morals of the population, particularly over sexual offences such as adultery and fornication. A rebuke was necessary for moral offenders to [...] "purge their scandal". This involved standing or sitting before the congregation for up to three Sundays and enduring a rant by the minister. There was sometimes a special repentance stool near the pulpit for this purpose. In a few places the subject was expected to wear sackcloth. From the 1770s kirk session increasingly administered private rebukes, particularly for men from the social elites, while until the 1820s the poor were almost <b>always</b> <b>give</b> a public rebuke. In the early part of the century the kirk, particularly in the Lowlands, attempted to suppress dancing and events like penny weddings at which secular tunes were played. The oppression of secular music and dancing by the kirk began to ease between about 1715 and 1725.|$|E
500|$|Negative reviews {{came from}} Salon.com and The Scotsman. Louis Bayard of Salon.com {{disagreed}} with the delivery of the final chapter, on ecological debt, writing that Atwood [...] "forsakes artistic engagement for ideological reflex". William Skidelsky in The Guardian agreed that the chapter was [...] "by no means {{the highlight of the}} book". [...] He also wrote: [...] "Because Atwood constantly veers off in new directions she doesn't <b>always</b> <b>give</b> herself time to sink her claws deep into a topic. The result is that, although Payback is packed with information, it can seem oddly thin... Still, Atwood's enthusiasm for her subject and lively style {{go a long way toward}} making up for these flaws. She can be a brilliant phrase-maker, and has a gift for summing up an idea with a single vivid image." [...] Allan Massie, reviewing for The Scotsman, could not find a coherent argument being presented and found her writing style [...] "veering uncomfortably between the academic and the jokily colloquial, [...] tiresome, [...] some of her writing is pretentious, much obvious and platitudinous". The reviewers in Salon.com and The Scotsman, as well as The Economist, were all uncomfortable with Atwood not distinguishing or contrasting 'good' and 'bad' debt.|$|E
500|$|On November10,2010, [...] "Don't You Wanna Stay" [...] was {{performed}} {{live for the}} first time by Aldean with Clarkson on the 44th Country Music Association Awards. The performance triggered an overwhelming demand from radio stations across the country. As a result, Aldean’s label, Broken Bow Records, made the song available on PLAY MPE. Carson James, the label's Senior Vice President for Promotion responded, [...] "If there’s one thing I’ve learned in my years in the record business, it is <b>always</b> <b>give</b> radio what they want [...] Our entire promotion staff has spent all night fielding calls and returning texts about getting this song, so we decided it best to release it on Play MPE first thing this morning." [...] Myra Dehais of RED Company claimed that the song's rise at adult-radio stations was a result of the company's distribution, saying [...] "This is a proud moment for RED distribution, [...] In crossing a country song over to the adult and pop formats, we can face resistance, since (some) stations have only a slot or two for country music, in order to maintain sonic balance. [...] "Don't You Wanna Stay" [...] was later included on the deluxe edition of Clarkson's fifth studio album, Stronger (2011).|$|E

But I {{feel like the}} time for a Sandman movie is coming soon. We need someone who has the same obsession with the source material as Peter Jackson had with Lord of the Rings or Sam Raimi had with Spider-Man." [...] That same year, he stated that he could imagine Terry Gilliam as a director for the adaptation: [...] "I would <b>always</b> <b>give</b> anything to Terry Gilliam, forever, so if Terry Gilliam ever wants to do Sandman then as far as I'm concerned Terry Gilliam should do Sandman." [...] In 2013, DC President Diane Nelson said that a Sandman film would be as rich as the Harry Potter universe. David S. Goyer announced in an interview in early December that he would be producing an adaptation of the graphic novel, alongside Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Neil Gaiman. Jack Thorne was hired to write the script. On October 16, 2014, Gaiman clarified that while the film was not announced with the DC slate by Warner Bros., it would instead be distributed by Vertigo and announced with those slate of films. Goyer told Deadline.com in an interview that the studio was very happy with the film's script. According to Deadline.com, the film was to be distributed by New Line Cinema. In October 2015, Goyer revealed that a new screenwriter was being brought on board to revise the script by Jack Thorne and stated that he believed the film would go into production the following year. In March 2016, The Hollywood Reporter revealed that Eric Heisserer was hired to rewrite the film's script. The next day, Gordon-Levitt announced that he had dropped out due to disagreements with the studio over the creative direction of the film. On November 9, 2016, i09 reported that Heisserer had turned in his draft of the script but left the film, stating that the film should be an HBO series instead.|$|E
