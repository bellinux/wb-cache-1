40|$|The use {{of mineral}} {{fertilizer}} {{is essential for}} sustainable agriculture. Mineral fertilizers are applied to balance {{the gap between the}} nutrients required for optimal crop development and the nutrients supplied by the soil and by available organic sources. As all human activities, crop production and in particular the use of mineral fertilizer has an “environmental footprint”. With regards to N fertilizers this is mainly related to eutrophication and <b>acidification</b> <b>of</b> <b>ecosystems,</b> and the release of greenhouse gases (GHG). This paper investigates the GHG emissions (“carbon footprint”) of crop production in general and the role of mineral nitrogen fertilizers in particular. Production and use of mineral and organic N fertilizer contributes significantly to the global GHG emissions, but the major agricultural contribution to GHG emissions on the global scale is the expansion of agricultural land into forests and wetlands. This study compares the carbon footprint of crop production with different nitrogen fertilizer inputs based on life-cycle assessment (LCA) principles. This means it includes all on-farm activities to produce wheat grain, the production and supply of seeds, pesticides, machinery, and fertilizers as well as the extraction and processing of any raw materials needed. The study reveals that intensive crop production aiming at economic optimum N supply helps mitigating GHG emissions by preserving natural land from being converted into cropland...|$|E

Chironomids have in general high adaptability of species to harsh conditions. Food supply and concentration of dissolved oxygen are likely the main factors which influence the assemblages of chironomids in freshwater ecosystems. Chironomids are suitable for use in surface water research and biomonitoring due to their world-wide distribution, high species diversity and density.

40|$|Ammonia {{emissions}} are major contributors to eutrophication and <b>acidification</b> <b>of</b> <b>ecosystems</b> and secondary PM 2. 5 concentrations in Europe. Reduction of the ammonia emissions in Europe {{has been on}} the agenda for more than a decade, first on a national scale, e. g. in Denmark and the Netherlands, followed by international efforts. The latter include the UNECE CLRTAP Gothenburg Protocol and EU directives and strategies. This Cross Cutting Group considered the policy context of the ammonia problem, including socio-economic, environmental, institutional and technological aspects. Drawing on the scientific findings and recommendations from the other Working Groups and independent contributions from the participants, the Cross Cutting Group addressed the potential role of different policy options to help mitigate ecosystm and health impacts of ammonia emissions. It also discussed a need to adapt tools used in policy analysis (integrated assessment models, IAMs) and consequently evaluate policies in view of new findings. Ammonia policies are becoming strongly interlinked with a number of other environmental and agricultual policies. In order to avoid the problem of pollution swapping, future policies need to consider these interactions. This in turn calls for extensions the tools currently used, verification of specific elements of the models, adaptation of monitoring networks, targeted measurement programs, but also possible revision of legislation in order to close existing loopholes and increase synergies in addressing nitrogen polluton at large. In that sense, priority should be given to measures aiming at reducing all kinds of nitrogen losses at farm level. Ammonia emission reduction policies must be analysed in a multi-effect (human health, acidification and eutrophication of the ecosystems and related biodiversity loss), multi-media (air, water, soil), multi-scale (hot spots, regional, European, global) framework...|$|E
40|$|The <b>acidification</b> <b>of</b> <b>ecosystems</b> {{is still}} an unsolved problem in Europe. Thus, in the Sulphur Protocol of Oslo, signed in 1994, most European {{countries}} agreed on national sulphur emission ceilings for the year 2000 that have been derived mainly {{on the basis of}} the critical loads concept. In view of this, the paper develops a practicable model of tradable SO 2 -permits for the EU- 15 public power producers who contribute to about 30 % of all anthropogenic SO 2 -emissions. For this sector the scheme would become the main instrument to curb SO 2 -emissions. A short evaluation of the literature on spatially differentiated permit systems, and the empirical evidence on the U. S. Acid Rain Program and the Californian RECLAIM Program lead to the choice of a spatially undifferentiated SO 2 -permit system as a starting-point for the model’s design. The inherent conflict between ecological effectivity and economic efficiency is assessed using an applied general equilibrium model for the European Union. Simulations indicate that an undifferentiated SO 2 permit system will save costs, but violates the national deposition targets in all countries with the exceptions of Greece, Portugal and Spain. The macroecenomic impacts turn out to be small; they lay within a range of ± 0. 5 per cent for all countries (based on the business-as-usual case). In order to address the ecological needs a bundle of measures counteracting possible hot spots is proposed whose use should be graded according to their intensity of interference, in order to keep the degrees of freedom for all agents in the market as high as possible. Concerning the initial allocation of SO 2 -permits to the public power producers a long-term transition from a mode of grandfathering to the mode of a free auction is chosen. This "limited grandfathering " is implemented by a primary distribution of permits to existing sources which only covers the expected remaining regular lifetime of the respective plant type.

40|$|Gaseous ammonia {{emissions}} from livestock production are a well known source of anthropogenic {{ammonia emissions}} {{and have been}} the subject of numerous studies in Western Europe and in the United States of America. They are deemed responsible for the <b>acidification</b> <b>of</b> <b>ecosystems.</b> Furthermore, ammonia emissions from intensive livestock operations located in the vicinity of major cities induce favourable conditions for smog formation. Ammonia volatilization from manure also reduces its effectiveness as a fertilizer by reducing its nitrogen content, an important nutrient for plant growth. Certain technologies and structures exist to cover manure storage tanks in order to limit these ammonia losses to the atmosphere. Very few studies have been done in Canada where climate and manure management practices differ widely from those in Western Europe and in the United States of America. In this project, a measurement campaign was financed by Agriculture and Agrifood Canada on four commercial livestock production infrastructure to begin the development of national ammonia inventory. Commercial dairy and swine manure storages covered by floating geomembranes were monitored for periods exceeding six months in the Eastern Townships of Quebec. The swine manure storage emitted negligible amounts of ammonia, from 5. 9 ? 10 [superscript - 3] to 0. 14 [micro]g? m[superscript - 2]. s[superscript - 1] over the summer time. The dairy manure storage emitted more substantial amounts of ammonia when the manure surface was frozen in winter, from 1. 9 to 16 [micro]g. m[superscript - 2] ? s[superscript - 1], then when unfrozen, 93 to 166 [micro]g? m[superscript - 2] ? s[supercript - 1]. A structural difference in the covering technology at the dairy manure storage rendered it less airtight than the swine manure storage. Therefore, the efficiency of a cover to limit ammonia emissions from manure is function of its air tightness. Ammonia emission rates from two tie-stall commercial dairy buildings were also monitored in the Eastern Townships of Quebec. Ammonia emission measurements done at building A during winter 2007 ranged from 3. 77 to 6. 80 g ? day[superscript - 1] ? animal[superscript - 1] while those performed at building B during summer 2007 were higher and ranged from 11. 33 to 18. 20 g ? day[superscript - 1] ? animal[superscript - 1]. These values fall within the wide range of those published for Western Europe and the United States of America. However, unlike studies completed in Europe using similar procedures, the methods used to measure gaseous ammonia concentrations and building ventilation flow rates in this study were validated in controlled environments...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} impact of acidic precipitation on the environmental mobility of the metalloids arsenic (As) and selenium (Se) has not been given much attention and is poorly understood. As with other elements, the interest here is the potential effect <b>of</b> environmental <b>acidification</b> on environmental behavior {{in ways that are}} relevant to human exposure to these metalloids. Available information on acid precipitation and the environmental behavior of these metalloids do, however, permit some preliminary conclusions to be drawn. Both As and Se appear to be mobilized from household plumbing into tap water by the corrosive action of soft, mildly acidic water, while surface water catchment systems in areas impacted by acidic deposition may contain elevated soluble As levels. <b>Acidification</b> <b>of</b> aquatic <b>ecosystems</b> that are drinking water sources may pose the prospect of enhanced release of As from sediment to water as well as reduction in water levels <b>of</b> Se. <b>Acidification</b> <b>of</b> ground waters, where As appears to be especially mobile, is of particular concern in this regard.

The effect is opposite for the two elements; lowered pH would appear to enhance As mobility and to reduce Se availability.

NO 3 is the major oxidation species at night often reacting with biogenic volatile organic hydrocarbons emitted during the nighttime air, which lead to peroxyl radical and nitric acid formation.

While detrimental effects on living organisms are thought to occur primarily through DNA damage, solar UV can also damage cellular proteins, lipids and signalling pathways. Cryptosporidium, a member of the eukaryotic phylum Apicomplexa, contain numerous vesicular secretory organelles and their discharge via regulated exocytosis is essential for the successful establishment of infection. Using flow cytometric techniques we demonstrate that solar UV rapidly induces sporozoite exocytosis resulting in a significant reduction in the ability of sporozoites to attach and invade host cells. We found that solar UV induced sporozoite membrane depolarization, resulting in reduced cellular ATP and increased cytosolic calcium. These changes were accompanied by a reduction in the internal granularity of sporozoites, indicative of apical organelle discharge, which was confirmed by analysis of sporozoites with an exocytosis-sensitive dye. The precise timing of apical organelle discharge in the presence of a compatible host cell is critical for sporozoite attachment and invasion. Our results demonstrate for the first time how solar UV radiation can interfere with exocytosis, a fundamental cellular process in all eukaryotic cells. We contend that not only may the forecast increases in solar radiation in both aquatic and terrestrial environments significantly affect members of the Apicomplexa, solar UV-induced membrane depolarizations resulting i...|$|R

To investigate whether ectomycorrhizas protect against excessive Mn by improving plant growth and nutrition or by retention of excess Mn in the hyphal mantle, seedlings of two populations of Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), two varieties, one being menziesii (DFM) and the other being glauca (DFG), were inoculated with the ectomycorrhizal fungus Rhizopogon subareolatus in sand cultures. Five months after inoculation, half of the inoculated and non-inoculated seedlings were exposed to excess Mn in the nutrient solution for further 5  months. At {{the end of this}} period, plant productivity, nutrient concentrations, Mn uptake and subcellular compartmentalisation were evaluated. Non-inoculated, non-stressed DFM plants produced about 2. 5 times more biomass than similarly treated DFG. Excess Mn in the nutrient solution led to high accumulation of Mn in needles and roots but only to marginal loss in biomass. Colonisation with R. subareolatus slightly suppressed DFM growth but strongly reduced that of DFG (− 50 %) despite positive effects of mycorrhizas on plant phosphorus nutrition. Growth reductions of inoculated Douglas fir seedlings were unexpected since the degree of mycorrhization was not high, i. e. ca. 30 % in DFM and 8 % in DFG. Accumulation of high Mn was not prevented in inoculated seedlings. The hyphal mantle of mycorrhizal root tips accumulated divalent cations such as Ca, but not Mn, thus not providing a barrier against excessive Mn uptake into the plants associated with R. subareolatus...|$|R

Currently, PM 2. 5 and PM 10 aerosols are mainly monitored by bulk mass methods. This however gives very little information on the contribution of different aerosol compounds to the total mass and on aerosol sources. In addition, composition data is needed to refine the epidemiological understanding of the aerosol metrics most closely associated with human health impacts. Long term real time measurements of chemically speciated inorganic aerosols and their precursor gases are needed to understand the sources of emissions, and aerosol processes in the atmosphere in order to implement effective emission reduction measures. Furthermore, long-term data sets are necessary to validate national and international chemical transport models, which are used to inform policy. The MARGA (Monitoring instrument for AeRosols and reactive Gases, Applikon Analytical BV, Netherlands) is an instrument that provides long term real time (hourly) measurements of water soluble inorganic aerosols (NH 4 +, NO 3 -, SO 42 -, Cl-) and their gas precursor (NH 3, HNO 3, HNO 2, SO 2, HCl). The MARGA is based on a wet chemistry method that utilises rotating annular wet denuders for the capture of reactive trace gases and steam jet aerosol collectors (SJACs) for the collection of soluble aerosols.

Since June 2006 a MARGA has been operated continuously at the northern UK EMEP supersite ‘Auchencorth Moss’, monitoring the composition of both PM 10 and PM 2. 5 aerosol.
