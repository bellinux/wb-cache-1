6000|$|It {{is one of}} his {{arguments}} for bringing in the Jews, but the colonisation of Palestine will leave no Jews over for Irak.

[...] "There is really nothing for it," [...] he bursts out in despair, [...] "but the introduction of Mohammedans from other countries where the climatic conditions of Irak prevail." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I've {{been at the}} {{business}} a good deal longer than you have," [...] said the captain, [...] "and I'm not tired of it yet. When I took away my first cargo, you must remember that I carried each bag on my own shoulders, {{and it took me}} more than a month to do it, and even all that is only <b>a</b> <b>drop</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bucket</b> compared to what most men who call themselves rich have to do before they make their money." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{going to}} talk straight, Geoffrey. Your friend told me the whole thing, and I agree with his opinion. See here, you are safe for life if you hold fast to what you have got now--and the Lord knows whether we will ever be {{successful}} in the cañon. Of course the money would help us, but it isn't sufficient to make victory dead certain, and it would be <b>a</b> <b>drop</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bucket</b> if we came down with a bang, as we may very well do. Even considering what's at stake, I couldn't let you make the plunge without protesting." ...|$|E
60|$|There {{was much}} brisker bidding for the implements, working oxen, and {{remnant of the}} stock, which were {{within the limits of}} my neighbors, and who did their best; but the prices {{realized}} were by comparison merely <b>a</b> <b>drop</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bucket,</b> and I turned away disconsolate, knowing that the worst I feared had come to pass. All the borrowed money had been sunk in the improvement of that property, and now the mortgage holder, who had even before the sale been almost repaid, owned the whole of it, land and improvements, and still held a lien on me for a balance of the debt.|$|E

6000|$|... "But all I can say {{now is that}} it was a {{spectacle}} to freeze the blood. Poor Almia could scarcely retain consciousness as she gazed upon the awful scenes of woe and suffering which spread out beneath her. And she could do nothing! Her labors would be useful only in cases of isolated woundings. If she were to mingle in the fray she would perish in the general slaughter; and if she were to go and offer assistance in the hospitals she would find herself but as <b>a</b> <b>drop</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bucket,</b> her efforts unrecognized, even if she were not driven away as an interloper. Besides, she did not know where the hospitals were.|$|E

[...] "The stuff is there; we know that; {{and it must}} be found. But all this is only the one string to our bow--though I tell you I've gone into it head-first, as if it was our bottom dollar. Why, the first thing I did before I'd raised a cent, and with this other notion in my head already--the first thing I did was to secure the schooner. The Norah Creina she is, sixty-four tons--quite big enough for our purpose since the rice is spoiled, and the fastest thing of her tonnage out of San Francisco. For a bonus of two hundred, and a monthly charter of three, I have her for my own time; wages and provisions, say four hundred more: <b>a</b> <b>drop</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bucket.</b> They began firing the cargo out of her (she was part loaded) near two hours ago; and about the same time John Smith got the order for the stores. That's what I call business." ...|$|E
60|$|I quote an American in this {{connection}} without scruple. Uncle Sam is better than John Bull, but he is tarred with the English stick. For Mr. Grant White the States are the New England States and nothing more. He wonders {{at the amount of}} drinking in London; let him try San Francisco. He wittily reproves English ignorance as to the status of women in America; but has he not himself forgotten Wyoming? The name Yankee, of which he is so tenacious, is used over the most of the great Union as a term of reproach. The Yankee States, of which he is so staunch a subject, are but <b>a</b> <b>drop</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bucket.</b> And we find in his book a vast virgin ignorance of the life and prospects of America; every view partial, parochial, not raised to the horizon; the moral feeling proper, at the largest, to a clique of States; and the whole scope and atmosphere not American, but merely Yankee. I will go far beyond him in reprobating the assumption and the incivility of my countryfolk to their cousins from beyond the sea; I grill in my blood over the silly rudeness of our newspaper articles; and I do not know where to look when I find myself in company with an American and see my countrymen unbending to him as to a performing dog. But in the case of Mr. Grant White example were better than precept. Wyoming is, after all, more readily accessible to Mr. White than Boston to the English, and the New England self-sufficiency no better justified than the Britannic.|$|E

6000|$|... "There {{have been}} from time to time, among well-meaning Christian people, {{retrenchment}} societies on high moral grounds, which have failed for want of knowledge how to manage the complicated question of necessaries and luxuries. These words have a signification {{in the case of}} different people as varied as the varieties of human habit and constitution. It is a department impossible to be bound by external rules, but none the less should every high-minded Christian soul in this matter have a law unto itself. It may safely be laid down as a general rule, that no income, however large or however small, should be unblessed by the divine touch of self-sacrifice. Something for the poor, the sorrowing, the hungry, the tempted, and the weak should be taken from what is our own at the expense of some personal sacrifice, or we suffer more morally than the brother from whom we withdraw it. Even the Lord of all, when dwelling among men, out of that slender private purse which he accepted for his little family of chosen ones, had ever something reserved to give to the poor. It is easy to say, 'It is but <b>a</b> <b>drop</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bucket.</b> I cannot remove the great mass of misery in the world. What little I could save or give does nothing.' It does this, if no more,--it prevents one soul, and that soul your own, from drying and hardening into utter selfishness and insensibility; it enables you to say, I have done something; taken one atom from the great heap of sins and miseries {{and placed it on the}} side of good.|$|E
