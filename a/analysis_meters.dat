Automatic <b>meter</b> <b>analysis</b> aims to {{annotate}} {{a recording of}} a metered piece of music with its metrical structure. This analysis subsumes correct estimation {{of the type of}} meter, the tempo, and the alignment of the metrical structure with the music signal. Recently, Bayesian models have been successfully applied to several of <b>meter</b> <b>analysis</b> tasks, but depending on the musical context, <b>meter</b> <b>analysis</b> still poses significant challenges. In this paper, we investigate if there are benefits to automatic <b>meter</b> <b>analysis</b> from additional a priori information about the metrical structure of music. We explore informed automatic <b>meter</b> <b>analysis,</b> in which varying levels of prior information about the metrical structure of the music piece is available to analysis algorithms. We formulate different informed <b>meter</b> <b>analysis</b> tasks and discuss their practical applications, with a focus on Indian art music. We then adapt state of the art Bayesian <b>meter</b> <b>analysis</b> methods to these tasks and evaluate them on corpora of Indian art music. The experiments show that the use of additional information aids <b>meter</b> <b>analysis</b> and improves automatic <b>meter</b> <b>analysis</b> performance, with significant gains for analysis of downbeats.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new method for detecting long-timescale structure in music. We describe {{a way to}} compute autocorrelation such that the distribution of energy in phase space is preserved in a matrix. The resulting Autocorrelation Phase Matrix (APM) is useful for several tasks involving metrical structure. In this paper we describe the details of calculating the APM. We then show how phase-related regularities from music are stored in the APM and present two ways to recover these regularities. The simpler approach uses variance or entropy calculated {{on the distribution of}} information in the APM. The more complex approach explicitly searches through the phase and lag space of the APM to predict meter and tempo in parallel. We compare these approaches against standard autocorrelation for the task of tempo prediction on a relatively large database of annotated digital audio files. We demonstrate that better tempo prediction is achieved by exploiting the phase-related information in the APM. We argue that the APM is an effective data structure for tempo prediction and related applications, such as real-time beat induction and music <b>analysis.</b> <b>Meter</b> is the sense of stressed and unstressed beats that arises from the interaction amon...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—A {{method is}} decribed which {{estimates}} the basic pattern of beats {{in a piece}} of music, the musical <b>meter.</b> <b>Analysis</b> is performed jointly at three different time scales: at the temporally atomic tatum pulse level, at the tactus pulse level which corresponds to the tempo of a piece, and at the musical measure level. Acoustic signals from arbitrary musical genres are considered. For the initial time-frequency analysis, a new technique is proposed which measures the degree of musical accent as a function of time at four different frequency ranges. This is followed by a bank of comb filter resonators which perform feature extraction for estimating the periods and phases of the three pulses. The features are processed by a probabilistic model which represents primitive musical knowledge and uses the low-level observations to perform joint estimation of the tatum, tactus, and measure pulses. The model takes into account the temporal dependencies between successive estimates and enables both causal and noncausal estimation. The method is validated using a manually annotated database of 474 musical signals from various genres. The method works robustly for different types of music and improves over two state-of-the-art reference methods in simulations.

Independently, the IPCL algorithm incrementally characterizes patterns in stream data and correlates these across time.
