Around this time, an unknown McCartney original was recorded, {{with the help of}} engineer Geoff Emerick. The songs that McCartney would work on were voted upon democratically: McCartney comments, [...] "I pulled up some [...] from my memories, when I was a kid and we had family sing-songs, which was the original inspiration for the whole idea, I said to Tom, 'Let's look at these ones.

Four cars had 440 engines equipped with four-speeds; the fifth car was a 383 with automatic.

The Challengers were prepared and maintained for the movie by Max Balchowsky, who also prepared the Mustangs and Chargers for Bullitt (1968). The cars performed to Loftin's satisfaction, although dust came to be a problem. None of the engines were blown.

When I met you that night I had just arrived from Melbourne. I had been lucky in some trading speculations I had out there, and I had some bills with me, but no money except what I had tucked in the skin of that portmanteau and a few papers connected with my family at home. When a man lives the roving kind of life I have, he learns to keep all that he cares for under his own hat, and isn't apt to blab to friends. But it got out in some way on the voyage that I had money, and as there was a mixed lot of 'Sydney ducks' and 'ticket of leave men' on board, it seems they hatched a nice little plot to waylay me on the wharf on landing, rob me, and drop me into deep water.

I'd my suspicions that <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> men might be waiting for me {{at the end of the}} wharf. I left the ship just a minute or two before the sailors did.

6000|$|After dinner (as I {{need not}} tell the keen {{observer}} of human nature who peruses this) the human mind, if the body be in a decent state, expands into gayety and benevolence, and the intellect longs to measure itself in friendly converse with the divers intelligences around it. We ascend upon deck, and after eying {{each other for a}} brief space and with a friendly modest hesitation, we begin anon to converse about the weather and other profound and delightful themes of English discourse. We confide to each other our respective opinions of the ladies round about us. Look at that charming creature in a pink bonnet and a dress of the pattern of a Kilmarnock snuff-box: a stalwart Irish gentleman in a green coat and bushy red whiskers is whispering something very agreeable into her ear, as is the wont of gentlemen of his nation; for her dark eyes kindle, her red lips open and give an opportunity to a dozen beautiful pearly teeth to display themselves, and glance brightly in the sun; while round the teeth and the lips a number of lovely dimples make their appearance, and her whole countenance assumes a look of perfect health and happiness. See her companion in shot silk and a dove-colored parasol; in what a graceful Watteau-like attitude she reclines. The tall courier who has been bouncing about the deck in attendance upon these ladies (it is his first day of service, and he is eager to make a favorable impression on them and the lady's-maids too) has just brought them from the carriage a small paper of sweet cakes (nothing is prettier than to see a pretty woman eating sweet biscuits) and a bottle that evidently contains Malmsey madeira. How daintily they sip it; how happy they seem; how that lucky rogue of an Irishman prattles away! Yonder is a noble group indeed: an English gentleman and his family. Children, mother, grandmother, grown-up daughters, father, and domestics, twenty-two in all. They have a table to themselves on the deck, and the consumption of eatables among them is really endless. The nurses have been bustling to and fro, and bringing, first, slices of cake; then dinner; then tea with huge family jugs of milk; and the little people have been playing hide-and-seek round the deck, coquetting with the other children, and making friends of every soul on board. I love to see the kind eyes of women fondly watching them as they gambol about; a female face, be it ever so plain, when occupied in regarding children, becomes celestial almost, and a man can hardly fail to be good and happy while he is looking on at such sights. [...] "Ah, sir!" [...] says a great big man, whom you would not accuse of sentiment, [...] "I have <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> little things at home;" [...] and he stops and heaves a great big sigh and swallows down a half-tumbler of cold something and water. We know what the honest fellow means well enough. He is saying to himself, [...] "God bless my girls and their mother!" [...] but, being a Briton, is too manly to speak out in a more intelligible way. Perhaps it is as well for him to be quiet, and not chatter and gesticulate like those Frenchmen a few yards from him, who are chirping over a bottle of champagne.|$|E
6000|$|I {{was glad}} to observe <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> new colonists of the {{ornamental}} water, the dabchicks, and to renew my acquaintance with the familiar, long-established moorhens. One of them was engaged in building its nest in an elm-tree growing at the water's edge. I saw it make two journeys with large wisps of dry grass in its beak, running up the rough, slanting trunk to a height of sixteen to seventeen feet, and disappearing within the [...] "brushwood sheaf" [...] that springs from the bole at that distance from the roots. The wood-pigeons were much more numerous, also more eager to be fed. They seemed to understand very quickly that my bread and grain was for them and not the sparrows; but although they stationed themselves close to me, the little robbers we were jointly trying to outwit managed to get some pieces of bread by flying up and catching them before they touched the sward. This little comedy over, I visited the water-fowl, ducks of many kinds, sheldrakes, geese from many lands, swans black, and swans white. To see birds in prison during the spring mood of which I have spoken is not only no satisfaction but a positive pain; here--albeit without that large liberty that nature gives, they are free in a measure; and swimming and diving or dozing in the sunshine, with the blue sky above them, they are perhaps unconscious of any restraint. Walking along the margin I noticed three children some yards ahead of me; two were quite small, but the third, in whose charge the others were, was a robust-looking girl, aged about ten or eleven years. From their dress and appearance I took them to be the children of a respectable artisan or small tradesman; but what chiefly attracted my attention was the very great pleasure the elder girl appeared {{to take in the}} birds. She had come well provided with stale bread to feed them, and after giving moderately of her store to the wood-pigeons and sparrows, she went on to the others, native and exotic, that were disporting themselves in the water, or sunning themselves on the green bank. She did not cast her bread on the water in the manner usual with visitors, but was anxious to feed all the different species, or as many as she could attract to her, and appeared satisfied when any one individual of a particular kind got a fragment of her bread. Meanwhile she talked eagerly to the little ones, calling their attention to the different birds. Drawing near, I also became an interested listener; and then, in answer to my questions, she began telling me what all these strange fowls were. [...] "This," [...] she said, glad to give information, [...] "is the Canadian goose, and there is the Egyptian goose; and here is the king-duck coming towards us; and do you see that large, beautiful bird standing by itself, that will not come to be fed? That is the golden duck. But that is not its real name; I don't know them all, and so I name some for myself. I call that one the golden duck because in the sun its feathers sometimes shine like gold." [...] It was a rare pleasure to listen to her, and seeing what sort of a girl she was, and how much in love with her subject, I in my turn told her {{a great deal about the}} birds before us, also of other birds she had never seen nor heard of, in other and distant lands that have a nobler bird life than ours; and after she had listened eagerly for some minutes, and had then been silent a little while, she all at once pressed her two hands together, and exclaimed rapturously, [...] "Oh, I do so love the birds!" ...|$|E

The {{increasing}} {{application of}} notions and results from category theory, especially from algebra and coalgebra, {{has revealed that}} any formal software or hardware model is constructor- or destructorbased, a white-box or a black-box model. A highly-structured system may involve both constructor- and destructor-based components. The two model classes and the respective ways of developing them and reasoning about them are dual to each other. Roughly said, algebras generalize the modeling with context-free grammars, word languages and structural induction, while coalgebras generalize the modeling with automata, Kripke structures, streams, process trees and all other state- or object-oriented formalisms. We summarize the basic concepts of co/algebra and illustrate them at <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> signatures including <b>those</b> used in language or compiler construction like regular expressions or acceptors. ...|$|R
40|$|Impact {{detection}} is a {{very important}} Technology in today’s industry and science. It has many applications, from testing building structures to detecting the coin impact in an automatic distribution machine. The aim of this project is to design a low cost and low power consumption electronic circuit to condition the signal from different piezoelectric sensors. To begin, we made a study of piezoelectric technology, which is the most used in impact detection. We have also studied the mathematical model of an impact. Once we know clearly what we want to measure, we decided to use piezoelectric buzzers, instead of commercial sensors, because they have a similar behavior but a lower cost. To continue, we have studied the buzzer features, to design the circuit. After that, we have designed and simulated the sensor signal conditioning circuit. Once we have the circuit design, we have mounted it using commercial components, and we have tested it with <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> experiments. <b>Those</b> experiments served as feedback to adjust the circuit parameters and to learn concepts about impact detection. To carry on with this project work, the whole system could be designed to be portable, powered with batteries and with SMD components {{in order to make it}} smaller...|$|R
