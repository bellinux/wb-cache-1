5|$|During Taiwan under Japanese rule (1895–1945), {{the use of}} Pe̍h-ōe-jī was {{suppressed}} and it faced further countermeasures {{during the}} Kuomintang martial law period (1947–1987). In Fujian, use declined after {{the establishment of the}} People's Republic of China (1949) <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> 21st century the system was not in general use there. Taiwanese Christians, non-native learners of Southern Min, and native-speaker enthusiasts in Taiwan are among those that continue to use Pe̍h-ōe-jī. Full native computer support was developed in 2004, and users can now call on fonts, input methods, and extensive online dictionaries. Rival writing systems have evolved, and there is ongoing debate within the Taiwanese mother tongue movement as to which system should be used. Versions of pe̍h-ōe-jī have been devised for other Chinese varieties, including Hakka and Teochew Southern Min.|$|E

5|$|Gillings had an {{inventory}} of material that he had acquired while editing Fantasy, and he drew on this for Science Fantasy, as well as incorporating his own fanzine, Science Fantasy Review, into the new magazine. Once Carnell took over, Science Fantasy typically ran a long lead novelette along with several shorter stories; prominent contributors in the 1950s included John Brunner, Ken Bulmer, and Brian Aldiss, whose first novel Nonstop appeared (in an early version) in the February 1956 issue. Fantasy stories began to appear more frequently during {{the latter half of}} the 1950s, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> 1960s Carnell began to publish Thomas Burnett Swann's well-received historical fantasies. Carnell felt that the literary quality of Science Fantasy was always higher than that of New Worlds, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> 1960s his efforts were rewarded with three consecutive Hugo nominations for best magazine. Under Bonfiglioli more new writers appeared, including Keith Roberts, Brian Stableford and Josephine Saxton. In the opinion of science fiction historian Mike Ashley, the final year of Impulse, as it was titled by that time, included some of the best material ever published in a British science fiction magazine.|$|E

5|$|Since Arafat {{was raised}} in Cairo, the {{tradition}} of dropping the Mohammed or Ahmad portion of one's first name was common; notable Egyptians such as Anwar Sadat and Hosni Mubarak did so.
