They traded in Canton and Macao, which technically was against the rules and regulations in the charter of the SOIC. Grill took <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that his father was a director of the SOIC, and until his father's death shipped his own goods on board SOIC ships. From Europe the ships brought objets d'art, corals from the Mediterranean Sea, expensive clocks and other mechanical automatons known to the Chinese as sing-songs. Such goods were appreciated by the Emperor and the rich mandarins.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Lechaeum (391 BC) was an Athenian {{victory in}} the Corinthian War. In the battle, the Athenian general Iphicrates took <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that a Spartan hoplite {{regiment}} operating near Corinth was moving in the open without the protection of any missile throwing troops. He decided to ambush it with his force of javelin throwers, or peltasts. By launching repeated hit-and-run attacks against the Spartan formation, Iphicrates and his men were able to wear the Spartans down, eventually routing them and killing just under half. This marked {{one of the first}} occasions in Greek military history on which a force of peltasts had defeated a force of hoplites (heavy infantry).|$|E

Layers in the input images will be mapped in the subspace, where it is proven that they form well-defined clusters and can be reliably identified by a simple mean-shift based clustering algorithm. Global optimality is achieved since all valid regions are simultaneously taken into account, and noise can be effectively reduced by enforcing the subspace constraint. Good layer descriptions are shown to be extracted in the experimental results...|$|R

5|$|The most {{effective}} way to purify uranium oxide in a laboratory was to take <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that uranium nitrate is soluble in ether. Scaling this process up for industrial production was a dangerous proposition; ether was explosive, and a factory using large quantities was likely to blow up or burn down. Compton and Spedding turned to Mallinckrodt in Saint Louis, Missouri, which had experience with ether. Spedding went over the details with Mallinckrodt's chemical engineers, Henry V. Farr and John R. Ruhoff, on 17 April 1942. Within a few months, sixty tons of highly pure uranium oxide was produced.|$|E
5|$|With no {{permanent}} plans for conquest, the Assyrians left control of Egypt {{to a series}} of vassals who became known as the Saite kings of the Twenty-sixth Dynasty. By 653BC, the Saite king Psamtik I (taking <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that Assyria was involved in a fierce war conquering Elam and that few Assyrian troops were stationed in Egypt) was able to free Egypt relatively peacefully from Assyrian vassalage with the help of Lydian and Greek mercenaries, the latter of whom were recruited to form Egypt's first navy. Psamtik and his successors however were careful to maintain peaceful relations with Assyria. Greek influence expanded greatly as the city of Naukratis became the home of Greeks in the delta.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} algorithms for animating deformable {{objects in}} real-time.

The targeted application domain is surgical training. This application relies more on visual realism than exact, patientspecific deformation, but requires that computations {{be performed in}} real-time. This is in contrast with pre-operative surgical planning, where computations may be done offline, but must provide accurate results. To achieve realtime performance, the proposed algorithms take <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> that most deformations are local, human-body tissues are well damped, and motions of surgical instruments are relatively slow.

40|$|Representing {{images with}} layers has many {{important}} applications, such as video compression, motion analysis, and 3 D scene analysis. This paper presents a robust subspace approach to reliably extracting layers from images by taking <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that homographies induced by planar patches {{in the scene}} form a low dimensional linear subspace. Such subspace provides not only a feature space where layers in the image domain are mapped onto denser and better-defined clusters, but also a constraint for detecting outliers in the local measurements, thus making the algorithm robust to outliers. By enforcing the subspace constraint, spatial and temporal redundancy from multiple frames are simultaneously utilized, and noise can be effectively reduced.

Finite element analyses were carried out for some typical crack problems, including a mixed mode crack, whose analytical solutions are known and <b>the</b> validity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> index was concretely demonstrated through the comparison between <b>the</b> variations <b>of</b> error and index with <b>the</b> sizes <b>of</b> singular element. <b>The</b> degree <b>of</b> error seems to be justly estimated through <b>the</b> value <b>of</b> index...|$|R
5|$|Jan van Eyck's {{use of oil}} as {{a medium}} was a {{significant}} development, allowing artists far greater manipulation of paint. The 16th-century art historian Giorgio Vasari claimed van Eyck invented the use of oil paint; a claim that, while exaggerated, indicates {{the extent to which}} van Eyck helped disseminate the technique. Van Eyck employed a new level of virtuosity, mainly from taking <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that oil dries so slowly; this gave him more time and more scope for blending and mixing layers of different pigments, and his technique was quickly adopted and refined by both Robert Campin and Rogier van der Weyden. These three artists are considered the first rank and most influential of the early generation of Early Netherlandish painters. Their influence was felt across northern Europe, from Bohemia and Poland in the east to Austria and Swabia in the south.|$|E
5|$|Plug-in {{electric}} vehicles offer users {{the opportunity to}} sell electricity stored in their batteries back to the power grid, thereby helping utilities to operate more efficiently {{in the management of}} their demand peaks. A vehicle-to-grid (V2G) system would take <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that most vehicles are parked an average of 95 percent of the time. During such idle times the electricity stored in the batteries could be transferred from the PEV to the power lines and back to the grid. In the U.S this transfer back to the grid have an estimated value to the utilities of up to $4,000 per year per car. In a V2G system it would also be expected that battery electric (BEVs) and plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) would have the capability to communicate automatically with the power grid to sell demand response services by either delivering electricity into the grid or by throttling their charging rate.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of the Lippe was a cavalry action {{fought on}} 2 September 1595 {{on the banks}} of the Lippe river, in Germany, between a corps of Spanish cavalry led by Juan de Córdoba and a corps of Dutch cavalry, {{supported}} by English troops, led by Philip of Nassau. The Dutch statholder Maurice of Nassau, taking <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that the bulk of the Spanish army was busied in operations in France, besieged the town of Groenlo in Gelderland, but the elderly governor of the citadel of Antwerp, Cristóbal de Mondragón, organized a relief army and forced Maurice to lift the siege. Mondragón next moved to Wesel, positioning his troops on the southern bank of the Lippe river to cover Rheinberg from a Dutch attack. Maurice aimed then, relying on his superior army, to entice Mondragón into a pitched battle, planning to use an ambush to draw the Spanish army into a trap. However, the plan was discovered by the Spanish commander, who organized a counter-ambush.|$|E

5|$|Rotblat {{returned}} to Britain to become senior lecturer and {{acting director of}} research in nuclear physics at the University of Liverpool. Most of his family had survived the war. With {{the help of a}} Polish man, his brother-in-law Mieczysław (Mietek) Pokorny had created false Polish Catholic identities for Rotblat's sister Ewa and niece Halina. Ewa, taking <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that she was an ash blonde who, like Rotblat, spoke fluent Polish as well as Yiddish, smuggled {{the rest of the family}} out of the Warsaw Ghetto. Mietek, Rotblat's brother Mordecai (Michael) and Michael's wife Manya, Rotblat's mother Scheindel, and two Russian soldiers lived in a concealed bunker underneath a house near Otwock, in which Ewa and Halina lived with a Polish family. Displays of Polish anti-Semitism that she witnessed during the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising embittered Ewa towards Poland, and she petitioned Rotblat to help the family emigrate to England. He therefore now accepted Chadwick's offer of British citizenship so he could help them escape from Poland. They lived with him in London for some time before becoming established. Halina would go on to graduate from Somerville College, Oxford and University College London, and become an editor of the Dictionary of National Biography.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{proposes a}} new ultra-precision {{machining}} method, i. e. pressure-based {{grinding and polishing}} with oblique axis spherical tools, for free-form lenses. The method is based on controlling the normal contact force between the tool and the workpiece. By employing grinding and polishing tools made from elastic materials, the normal contact force is easy {{to be controlled by}} monitoring <b>the</b> elastic deformation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tool. <b>The</b> method takes <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that more material can be removed by increasing the normal contact force.

40|$|Abstract — As an {{increasing}} number of automatic safety and navigation features are added to modern vehicles, <b>the</b> crucial job <b>of</b> providing real-time localisation is predominantly performed by a single sensor, GPS, despite its well-known failings, particularly in urban environments. Various {{attempts have been made to}} supplement GPS to improve localisation performance, but these usually require additional specialised and expensive sensors. Offering increased value to vehicle OEMs, we show that it is possible to use just the video stream from a rear parking camera to produce smooth and locally accurate visual odometry in real-time. We use an efficient whole image alignment approach based on ESM, taking account <b>of</b> both <b>the</b> difficulties and <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that a parking camera views only the road surface directly behind a vehicle. Visual odometry is complementary to GPS in offering localisation information at 30 Hz which is smooth and highly accurate locally whilst GPS is course but offers absolute measurements. We demonstrate our system in a large scale experiment covering real urban driving. We also present realtime fusion of our visual estimation with automotive GPS to generate a commodity-cost localisation solution which is smooth, accurate and drift free in global coordinates.

40|$|The radiant {{time series}} method (RTSM) takes <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that design cooling load {{calculations}} {{are based on}} steady periodic excitations. The main difference between the RTSM and the other cooling load calculation methods is that the periodic response factors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> RTSM are restricted to calculating the conduction heat gain through building elements under periodic outdoor conditions, which simplifies the computational procedure significantly. It is vital to have a reliable method or procedure to accurately calculate the periodic response factors of various types of walls and roofs. In this study, a procedure, based on the frequency-domain regression (FDR) method, is developed to directly and accurately calculate the outside, across and inside periodic response factors of a multilayer wall or roof from its geometric and thermal properties. At first, a polynomial s-transfer function is established from <b>the</b> frequency characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wall or roof using the FDR method. The periodic response factors are then generated from the poles and residues <b>of</b> <b>the</b> polynomial s-transfer function. Computational tests show that the FDR method provides an accurate and hopefully better alternative procedure to calculate periodic response factors. Using this procedure, the periodic response factors of various representative wall and roof types are calculated and compared with those calculated by other conventional methods.
