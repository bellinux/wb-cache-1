5|$|At {{the outset}} of the war, Australia's economy had been quite small and {{dependent}} largely upon agriculture <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>resources</b> industries for export earnings, while most manufactured products were imported from overseas. Almost immediately uncertainty over the continuation of foreign trade led to a rise in unemployment, indeed it was estimated that after only a couple of days of Britain having declared war, that up to 15,000 men had been retrenched in New South Wales alone due to concerns about the continued availability of foreign markets for Australian produce.|$|E
5|$|The bunkerisation {{programme}} was {{a massive}} drain on Albania's weak economy. The construction of prefabricated bunkers alone cost an estimated two percent of net material product, and in total the bunkers cost {{more than twice as}} much as the Maginot Line in France, consuming three times as much concrete. The programme diverted resources away from other forms of development, such as roads and residential buildings. On average, they are said to have each cost the equivalent of a two-room apartment <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>resources</b> used to build them could easily have resolved Albania's chronic shortage of housing. According to Josif Zagali, building twenty smaller bunkers cost as much as constructing a kilometre of road. It also had a human cost; 70–100 people a year died constructing the bunkers. In addition, the bunkers occupied and obstructed a significant area of arable land.|$|E
40|$|Resource {{allocation}} involves assigning <b>the</b> <b>resources</b> to <b>the</b> <b>resource</b> users. Where <b>the</b> <b>resources</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>resource</b> users do {{not change}} with time, <b>the</b> <b>resource</b> allocation problem can be solved as a scheduling problem. Where <b>the</b> <b>resources</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>resource</b> users change with time then some different allocation mechanisms are needed. In this paper an environment is considered in which <b>the</b> <b>resources</b> emerge <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>resource</b> requests also emerge unpredictably as time goes. <b>The</b> <b>resources</b> emerge with different capacities <b>and</b> in <b>the</b> same way <b>the</b> <b>resource</b> requests also emerge from the users with different demands as time goes. In this dynamic environment <b>the</b> <b>resource</b> allocation performance of the first price sealed bid <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Vickrey auctions are explored <b>and</b> compared. <b>The</b> system allocation performance is measured using the number of <b>the</b> emerging <b>resource</b> provisions <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>resource</b> requests that get matched. The simulation results {{show that there is}} no performance difference between the two mechanisms apart {{from the fact that the}} Auctioneer’s earnings are higher for the first price sealed bid auction. 1...|$|R

The tree and the temple are located on the main route of the THSR, {{and both of them}} faced removal because of railway construction. The temple -“Local Land God Temple”(伯公廟) established just beside the old tree is the belief center of the people there. In 1998, THSRC adjusted the line and design to keep the tree and temple in their original place and cooperated with local government and people to protect the old tree and the temple until today. Afterwards, together with the local government, the Environment <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Resources</b> Protection Committee, and cultural and historical authorities, THSRC drafted the Hsinchu Old Camphor Tree Medical Plan, which called for the repair of decayed branches as well as measures designed to maintain the long-term growth and the health of the tree.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} lightly damaged by saboteurs in December which {{disrupted}} progress and the Regia Marina decided to suspend construction in April 1942 as she remained {{nearly two years}} from completion. By late 1942, the Regia Marinas shortage of destroyers had reached a point that every possible hull was needed and construction restarted at a high priority. This allowed her to be launched on 18 July 1943, but shortly afterwards {{a change in the}} Italian leadership caused any further work to be suspended in August <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>resources</b> used in her construction to be diverted to finish a large group of small wooden minesweepers. During the fighting between the Germans and the Italians after the Italian surrender on 9 September, Spalato was scuttled in Split harbor on 24 September. The Germans occupied Split three days later, refloated the ship several weeks later and stripped her of any valuable material. As part of their scorched-earth strategy as they abandoned Split, the Germans scuttled Spalato and wrecked the shipyard before the Yugoslav Partisans occupied the port on 27 October 1944.|$|E

25|$|In 1992 the Canadian {{government}} {{declared a}} moratorium on the Northern Cod fishery that, for the past 500 years, had largely shaped the lives and communities of Canada's eastern coast.

In the summer of 1992, when the Northern Cod biomass fell to one percent of its earlier level, it became apparent to Canada's federal government that this relationship had been pushed to the breaking point and a moratorium was declared, ending the region's half-millennium run with the Northern Cod.|$|E
