5|$|For illustration, if a {{physical}} system behaves the same, {{regardless of how}} it is oriented in space, the physical laws that govern it are rotationally symmetric; from this symmetry, Noether's theorem shows the angular momentum of the system must be conserved. The physical system itself need not be symmetric; <b>a</b> <b>jagged</b> asteroid tumbling in space conserves angular momentum despite its asymmetry. Rather, the symmetry of the physical laws governing the system {{is responsible for the}} conservation law. As another example, if {{a physical}} experiment has the same outcome at any place and at any time, then its laws are symmetric under continuous translations in space and time; by Noether's theorem, these symmetries account for the conservation laws of linear momentum and energy within this system, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Bezalel Pavilion near Jaffa Gate was a {{tin-plated}} wooden {{structure with}} <b>a</b> <b>jagged</b> roof and tower, built in 1912 at a shop and showroom in Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design. It was {{designed specifically for}} tourists and passersby {{on their way to}} and exiting the Old City. The pavilion was destroyed six years after it was established.|$|E
25|$|El Castillo has 7000 {{square metres}} and four {{hectares}} of grounds. In the different modules, the building combines {{materials such as}} stone, brick, fine plaster, solid wood, and wrought iron. The windows and doors are straight lines, but are marked with stone arches. The upper finishing has <b>a</b> <b>jagged</b> shape with battlements, and in every angle there are watchtowers. The roofs have flat terraces and inclined surfaces with Spanish tiles. It has 45 rooms of up to 90 square metres.|$|E

25|$|Neptune built guitars out {{of scrap}} metal and make {{electric}} lamellophones. The bass is built using a VCR casing {{and another one}} of their instruments has <b>a</b> <b>jagged</b> scythe {{at the end of}} it. They also play on custom made percussion instruments and electric lamellophones. Neptune began in 1994 as a student art project by sculptor/musician Jason Sanford. In 2006 Neptune signed with Table of the Elements, an experimental record label that also has performers such as Rhys Chatham, John Cale, and Captain Beefheart on its roster.|$|E
25|$|Since {{it is at}} {{the limit}} of (or beyond) current {{technology}} to observe individual gas particles (atoms or molecules), only theoretical calculations give suggestions about how they move, but their motion is different from Brownian motion because Brownian motion involves a smooth drag due to the frictional force of many gas molecules, punctuated by violent collisions of an individual (or several) gas molecule(s) with the particle. The particle (generally consisting of millions or billions of atoms) thus moves in <b>a</b> <b>jagged</b> course, yet not so jagged as would be expected if an individual gas molecule were examined.|$|E
25|$|Following France's {{loss in the}} French and Indian War, {{through the}} 1763 Treaty of Paris they ceded control of the land to the British. Colonial {{settlement}} was limited by the Crown to lands east of the Appalachians, {{in order to try}} to end encroachment on Native American lands. The territory of Vermont was divided nearly in half in <b>a</b> <b>jagged</b> line running from Fort William Henry in Lake George diagonally north-eastward to Lake Memphremagog. With the end of the war, new settlers arrived in Vermont. Ultimately, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and New York all claimed this frontier area.|$|E
50|$|A short loop trail leads up Beaverdam Hill where Little Agassiz Rock {{appears as}} a giant granite {{monolith}} silhouetted against the sky. It rests precariously on <b>a</b> small <b>jagged</b> stone, leaving <b>an</b> opening below.|$|R

50|$|The {{summit is}} <b>a</b> sharp, <b>jagged</b> edge of mica schist {{connected}} by an arête with the Nordend, but {{cut off from}} the Zumsteinspitze to the south by nearly vertical rocks about 120 m in height.|$|R
25|$|The area is {{extremely}} varied geographically. The Tees estuary is highly industrialised and urbanised. Much {{of the remainder}} of the lowland parts of Cleveland is farmland. East Cleveland marks the northern end of the chain of cliffs that runs along the North Yorkshire Heritage Coast. South Cleveland {{is extremely}} hilly, forming the escarpment of the North York Moors. One of the best known symbols of Cleveland is the distinctive hill of Roseberry Topping, which overlooks Newton under Roseberry on the Great Ayton to Guisborough road. Its original roughly conical form was undercut by extensive mining, giving it <b>a</b> <b>jagged</b> appearance that many have thought reminiscent of the Matterhorn mountain.|$|E
25|$|Initially, Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich) {{created the}} {{identity}} with Stu Macher (Matthew Lillard) {{in order to}} kill Sidney because of her mother's affair with Billy's father. The Ghostface persona remains the same throughout the Scream series, featuring a black hood and cloak with <b>a</b> <b>jagged</b> base and a white rubber-mask resembling a ghost with a screaming expression. Though each iteration of Ghostface is human, they often exhibit extreme durability against physical harm, high levels of physical strength, and an almost supernatural stealth ability; able to appear and disappear in seemingly impossible situations. The character has often appeared in popular culture since its inception, referenced in film and television as well as spawning a series of action figures and merchandise.|$|E
25|$|Various {{ornaments}} of {{the nasal}} boss have also been used to distinguish between different species of Pachyrhinosaurus. Both P. lakustai and P. perotorum bore <b>a</b> <b>jagged,</b> comb-like extension {{at the tip of}} the boss which was missing in P. canadensis. P. perotorum was unique in having a narrow dome in the middle of the back portion {{of the nasal}} boss, and P. lakustai had a pommel-like structure projecting from the front of the boss (the boss of P. canadensis was mainly flat on top and rounded). P. perotorum bore two unique, flattened horns which projected forward and down from the top edge of the frill, and P. lakustai bore another comb-like horn arising from the middle of the frill behind the eyes.|$|E
50|$|Beehive Geyser is a geyser in the Upper Geyser Basin of Yellowstone National Park in the United States. The 4 ft tall cone {{resembles a}} beehive. Beehive's Indicator is <b>a</b> small, <b>jagged</b> cone-type geyser located about 10 ft from Beehive.|$|R
50|$|Lhotse Middle is a {{subsidiary}} peak to Lhotse, {{and was the}} final eight-thousander to be summited. It is <b>a</b> sharp, <b>jagged</b> peak rising 8410 m high, and {{has been described as}} the most difficult peak over eight thousand meters to climb.|$|R
50|$|The {{story goes}} {{that at the}} time the castle was built, if the {{structure}} was not complete, it was not taxable. Supposedly, after completion of the main portion of the castle, <b>a</b> small <b>jagged</b> wall was built on the roof.|$|R
25|$|There {{are three}} raised {{tailings}} dam designs, the upstream, downstream and centerline, named {{according to the}} movement of the crest during raising. The specific design used is dependent upon topography, geology, climate, the type of tailings, and cost. An upstream tailings dam consists of trapezoidal embankments being constructed on top but toe to crest of another, moving the crest further upstream. This creates a relatively flat downstream side and <b>a</b> <b>jagged</b> upstream side which is supported by tailings slurry in the impoundment. The downstream design refers to the successive raising of the embankment that positions the fill and crest further downstream. A centerlined dam has sequential embankment dams constructed directly on top of another while fill is placed on the downstream side for support and slurry supports the upstream side.|$|E
25|$|Minsc is a {{supporting}} {{character in the}} 2000 novelization of Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn by Philip Athans. He is depicted as a well-built man with long red hair, a patchy orange beard, and <b>a</b> <b>jagged</b> scar along {{the right side of}} his head. He is no longer a warrior, and is physically smaller than the novel's protagonist, Abdel. In contrast, Boo is unchanged, and is still referred to by Minsc as his miniature giant space hamster. Held prisoner alongside Abdel at the start of the novel, Minsc is set free and accompanies Abdel until they reach an inn, where he decides to work. Abdel repeatedly shows discomfort for his presence, using Minsc's employment as an excuse to leave him behind and steal his sword, though he later returns for his help in securing travel aboard a ship. After Abdel returns to kill his employers, Minsc realizes the inn will close permanently; he and Boo leave to find another place to work.|$|E
25|$|Saul Bass {{designed}} emblematic movie posters {{that transformed}} the visuals of film advertising. Before Bass’s seminal poster for The Man with the Golden Arm (1955), movie posters {{were dominated by}} depictions of key scenes or characters from the film, often both juxtaposed with each other. Bass’s posters, however, typically developed simplified, symbolic designs that visually communicated key essential elements of the film. For example, his poster for The Man with the Golden Arm, with <b>a</b> <b>jagged</b> arm and off-kilter typography, starkly communicates the protagonist's struggle with heroin addiction. Bass's iconic Vertigo (1958) poster, with its stylized figures sucked down into the nucleus of a spiral vortex, captures the anxiety and disorientation central to the film. His poster for Anatomy of a Murder (1959), featuring {{the silhouette of a}} corpse jarringly dissected into seven pieces, makes both a pun on the film’s title and captures the moral ambiguities within which this court room drama is immersed.|$|E
30|$|Profan delta subfacies mainly {{consist of}} grayish brown mudstones with sand strips and masses. Horizontal bedding is most common, with wavy and {{lenticular}} beddings being less common. The SP curve is relatively straight, while the R curve displays <b>a</b> low-amplitude <b>jagged</b> pattern.|$|R
60|$|After {{passing the}} {{plantation}} and reaching Mellstock Cross the white {{surface of the}} lane revealed itself between the dark hedgerows like <b>a</b> ribbon <b>jagged</b> at the edges; the irregularity being caused by temporary accumulations of leaves extending from the ditch on either side.|$|R
50|$|Southern crested newts are brown to gray dorsally, with darker patches {{scattered}} about. Their bellies and throats are orange, {{with small}} black dots. They {{grow up to}} 7.1 in (18 cm). Males have <b>a</b> large <b>jagged</b> crest from behind their necks down to their tails.|$|R
25|$|Obsidian {{can be used}} to make {{extremely}} sharp knives, and obsidian blades are a type {{of glass}} knife made using naturally occurring obsidian instead of manufactured glass. Obsidian is used by some surgeons for scalpel blades, although this is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use on humans. Well-crafted obsidian blades, as with any glass knife, can have a cutting edge many times sharper than high-quality steel surgical scalpels, the cutting edge of the blade being only about 3 nanometers thick. Even the sharpest metal knife has <b>a</b> <b>jagged,</b> irregular blade when viewed under a strong enough microscope; when examined even under an electron microscope an obsidian blade is still smooth and even. One study found that obsidian incisions produced fewer inflammatory cells and less granulation tissue at seven days, in a group of rats, although no differences were found after 21 days. Don Crabtree produced obsidian blades for surgery and other purposes, and has written articles on the subject. Obsidian scalpels may currently be purchased for surgical use on research animals.|$|E
25|$|VSI crushers use a {{different}} approach involving a high speed rotor with wear resistant tips and a crushing chamber designed to 'throw' the rock against. The VSI crushers utilize velocity rather than surface force as the predominant force to break rock. In its natural state, rock has <b>a</b> <b>jagged</b> and uneven surface. Applying surface force (pressure) results in unpredictable and typically non-cubical resulting particles. Utilizing velocity rather than surface force allows the breaking force to be applied evenly both {{across the surface of}} the rock as well as through the mass of the rock. Rock, regardless of size, has natural fissures (faults) throughout its structure. As rock is 'thrown' by a VSI Rotor against a solid anvil, it fractures and breaks along these fissures. Final particle size can be controlled by 1) the velocity at which the rock is thrown against the anvil and 2) the distance between the end of the rotor and the impact point on the anvil. The product resulting from VSI Crushing is generally of a consistent cubical shape such as that required by modern SUPERPAVE highway asphalt applications. Using this method also allows materials with much higher abrasiveness to be crushed than is capable with an HSI and most other crushing methods.|$|E
500|$|... "Violet Hill" [...] {{features}} an atmospheric synthesizer intro, which {{gives way to}} a piano melody played by Martin. The rest of the band then joins in and the song's prominent guitar riff, characterized by <b>a</b> <b>jagged,</b> fuzzbox distortion effect, enters. Martin sings about medieval imagery of carnivals, cathedrals, religion and war, culminating in a soaring chorus with an anthemic theme. The momentum of the song builds around guitarist Jonny Buckland, who plays a solo.|$|E
5000|$|Stornes Peninsula (...) is <b>a</b> rocky, <b>jagged</b> {{peninsula}} about 3 {{nautical miles}} (6 km) long, projecting into Prydz Bay {{just west of}} Larsemann Hills.

60|$|The belligerent {{fire in the}} office-boy's pink-rimmed {{eyes was}} {{suddenly}} dimmed by a gush of water. It was not remorse that caused him to weep, however. In {{the heat of the}} moment he had swallowed <b>a</b> large, <b>jagged</b> sweet, and he was suffering severely.|$|R
500|$|Shortly after 1:30 on {{the morning}} of 8 March 1966, a {{powerful}} explosion destroyed the upper portion of the Pillar and brought Nelson's statue crashing to the ground amid hundreds of tons of rubble. O'Connell Street was almost deserted at the time, although a dance in the nearby Hotel Metropole's ballroom was about to end and bring crowds on to the street. There were no casualties—a taxi-driver parked close by had a narrow escape—and damage to property was relatively light given the strength of the blast. What was left of the Pillar was <b>a</b> <b>jagged</b> stump, [...] high.|$|E
500|$|Krusty is {{a multimillionaire}} who amassed his fortune mostly by {{licensing}} {{his name and}} image {{to a variety of}} substandard products and services, from Krusty alarm clocks to Krusty crowd control barriers. Many of these products are potentially dangerous, such as Krusty's brand of cereal, Krusty-O's, which in one episode boasted <b>a</b> <b>jagged</b> metal Krusty-O in each box. One of many lawsuits regarding these products was launched by Bart, who ate <b>a</b> <b>jagged</b> metal Krusty-O and had to have his appendix removed. The [...] "Krusty Korporation", the company responsible for Krusty's licensing, has also launched a series of disastrous promotions and business ventures, such as sponsoring the 1984 Summer Olympics with a rigged promotion that backfired when the Soviet Union boycotted the games, causing Krusty to lose $44 million. In the TV series and comic books Krusty is also the mascot and owner of the restaurant Krusty Burger. He has been shut down by the health board many times for everything from overworking employees to stapling together half-eaten burgers to make new ones, as well as using beef infected with Mad Cow Disease to save money. Krusty wastes money almost as fast as he earns it: lighting his cigarettes with hundred-dollar bills, eating condor-egg omelettes, spending huge sums on pornographic magazines and call girls, and losing a fortune gambling on everything from horse races to operas and betting against the Harlem Globetrotters.|$|E
500|$|The Birkenhead {{was never}} {{commissioned}} as a frigate, as two factors {{came into play}} {{while she was still}} under construction, that resulted in her being converted into a troopship. [...] Firstly, the Royal Navy's warships were switched from paddle wheels to more efficient propeller propulsion, following an experiment organised by the Admiralty in 1845 in which the benefits of the propeller over the paddle wheel were dramatically demonstrated. [...] Secondly, the Admiralty had doubts about the effects of cannon shot against iron hulls — in a number of trials carried out at Royal Arsenal in 1845, at lower velocities shot made <b>a</b> <b>jagged</b> hole that was hard to plug.|$|E
