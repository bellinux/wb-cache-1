40|$|The <b>accelerated</b> {{approximate}} <b>procedure</b> {{developed and}} used herein for analysis, design and parametric optimization in electronic packaging {{is based on}} the disturbed state concept (DSC) and the hierarchical single surface (HISS) constitutive models. Over the past many years the benefits of the DSC/HISS model, compared to those of available plasticity models, have been demonstrated and validated {{for a wide range of}} materials and solder connections. When the DSC/HISS model is implemented in a two-dimensional finite element code, it is well suited for failure analyses of lead/tin solder connections under cyclic thermal and mechanical loading that are typically occur in electronic packages. Unfortunately, an analysis of a single solder connection, for approximately 4000 or more cycles, can require much effort and computer time, which may be too long to be of practical use. The <b>accelerated</b> approximate <b>procedure</b> significantly reduces the effort and the analysis time to approximately 10 to 15 minutes on a Pentium 4, 3. 2 GHz personal computer. The main emphasis of this dissertation is the use of the unified DSC model with the finite element procedure to predict the behavior of chip-substrate solder connections. The DSC code is used to validate the performance of a number of packages (144 BPGA, 313 PBGA) tested in the laboratory under thermomechanical loading. Using the <b>accelerated</b> approximate <b>procedure,</b> the effect of the variable thickness solder connection in a plane stress idealization is compared with that of the constant thickness assumption, and a three-dimensional analysis. It shows that the analysis with variable thickness (in plane stress idealization) yields improved results. The <b>accelerated</b> approximate <b>procedure</b> is then used to perform parametric design analyses of a solder connection by varying a number of important factors such as connection size, shape and misalignment. The effects of varying the DSC/HISS parameters on cycle life are also analyzed. The results of this research can be used for design, analysis and failure life prediction of solder connections in electronic packages. The <b>accelerated</b> approximate <b>procedure</b> is considered to yield improved results compared to other available modeling methods...|$|R

However, on 27 November 2012 the ECJ delivered its judgement, answering all the questions submitted to it in an affirmative manner, and thus rejected Pringle's challenge. [...] The ECJ found that the TFEU amendment did not expand the competence of the EU, and thus {{the use of the}} simplified treaty amendment procedure was legal. In addition, the ruling stated that the ESM treaty did not overrule any existing EU law and thus member states were permitted to join and enact the ESM treaty independent of whether the TFEU amendment had been ratified. It also highlighted that the ESM treaty basically replaced the intergovernmental temporary EFSF and the EU-law enacted EFSM, and that it did not limit the competence of the EU to introduce a similar support mechanism in the future.|$|E
40|$|The {{belief that}} certain asylum seekers do not deserve a full {{consideration}} of their claim first arose in Europe in the 1980 s. At the time, many refugee-receiving countries were being overwhelmed with applications for asylum. Popular opinion {{had it that}} the majority of these applications were not from individuals fleeing persecution and seeking protection, but were from people fleeing economic hardship and seeking a better life. This situation was regarded as problematic for two reasons. First, applications from ‘bogus ’ asylum seekers placed extreme pressure on asylum systems and led to increased administration costs. Second, ‘genuine ’ asylum seekers suffered as the resultant backlog of applications meant that it took longer for them to receive refugee status. Therefore, it became accepted that certain asylum applications should be processed in an <b>accelerated</b> <b>procedure.</b> While there is no standardized definition of an <b>accelerated</b> <b>procedure,</b> it is generally understood that an <b>accelerated</b> <b>procedure</b> processes asylum applications at a significantly faster rate than does the normal asylum system. Accelerated procedures can either be classed as ‘inclusionary ’ or exclusionary. While the main objective of an inclusionary <b>accelerated</b> <b>procedure</b> is to speedily grant an individual refugee status, the main objective of an exclusionary <b>accelerated</b> <b>procedure</b> is to speedily deny an individual refugee status. It is widely held that the accelerated procedures currently in operation in Member States of the European Union are examples of the latter. This paper examines {{whether or not it is}} possible for accelerated procedures to be both fair and efficient. The case for speedier decision-making needs to be balanced against the requirement of States to fulfill their obligations under international human rights and refugee law. Research findings from the first independent assessment of the <b>accelerated</b> <b>procedure</b> (fast track procedure) in the United Kingdom are presented. On the basis of this and comparative 2 secondary data the paper suggests that some States may be in danger of violating the principle of non-refoulement and returning refugees to places where their lives or freedoms could be threatened. ...|$|E

Tap water was used to simulate the most representative and stressing working condition, as it is the one normally available during exhibitions, and to promote the formation of the undesired calcareous deposits.

40|$|In this paper, {{we address}} the problem of finding a set of {{feasible}} or near-feasible systems among a finite number of simulated systems in the presence of stochastic constraints. Andradóttir, Goldsman, and Kim (2005) present a procedure that detects feasibility of systems in the presence of one constraint with a pre-specified probability of correctness. We extend their procedure to the case of multiple constraints by the use of the Bonferroni inequality. Unfortunately, the resulting procedure tends to be very conservative when the number of systems or constraints is large. As a remedy, we present a screening procedure that uses an aggregated observation, which is a linear combination of the collected observations across stochastic constraints. Then, we present an <b>accelerated</b> <b>procedure</b> that combine the extension of Andradóttir, Goldsman, and Kim (2005) with the procedure that uses aggregated observations. Some experimental results that compare the performance of the proposed procedures are presented. ...|$|E

40|$|Background : Procedures for {{determining}} refugee status across Europe are being speeded up, despite the high prevalence {{of mental health}} difficulties among asylum seekers. An assurance given is that &#x 2018;&#x 2018;vulnerable applicants&#x 2019;&#x 2019; will be identified and excluded from <b>accelerated</b> <b>procedures.</b> Although experts have recommended assessments to be undertaken by experienced clinicians, this is unlikely to happen for political and financial reasons. Understanding how non-clinically qualified personnel perform assessments of mental health issues is timely and crucial. Misrecognition of refugees due to the inappropriate use of <b>accelerated</b> <b>procedures</b> involves the risk of returning {{the very people who}} have the right to protection from further persecution. Objective : To examine the decision making of immigration lawyers, who are an example of a group of nonclinicians who decide when and whether to refer asylum-seekers for psychiatric assessment. Method : Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 legal representatives working with people seeking refugee or human rights protection in the United Kingdom. The resultant material was analysed using Framework Analysis. Results : Themes clustered around the legal case, the client, the representative and the systems, all with sub-themes. A mapping exercise integrated these themes to show how representatives brought together questions of (1) evidential reasons for a report, influenced by their legal, psychological and case law knowledge, and (2) perceived evidence of mental distress, influenced by professional and personal experiences and expectations. Conclusions : The legal representatives interviewed were well-informed and trained in psychological issues as well as clearly dedicated to their clients. This helped them to attempt quasi-diagnoses of common mental health problems. They nonetheless demonstrated stereotypical understanding of post-traumatic stress disorder and other possible diagnoses and the role of subjectivity. The study has implications for other groups &#x 2013; particularly those less trained and compassionate &#x 2013; who are required to make clinical judgments without the necessary expertise...|$|R

40|$|EU {{member states}} often use speedy (<b>accelerated)</b> asylum <b>{{procedures}}</b> to examine asylum claims that are deemed manifestly unfounded. Speedy asylum procedures should generally {{be considered to}} be {{in the interest of the}} asylum applicant and the state. <b>Accelerated</b> <b>procedures</b> have however been criticised for not being fair and resulting in inaccurate decisions. EU legislation allows the use of an <b>accelerated</b> asylum <b>procedure</b> in any asylum case and does not set minimum time limits for (certain stages) of asylum procedures. This does mean however that EU member states are completely free to design speedy asylum procedures. This article argues that the EU right to an effective remedy, laid down in article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the Charter), and the principle of effectiveness limit member states' discretion to set time limits for asylum procedures. It is contended that EU law is violated if the speed of the proceedings undermines the effectiveness of the EU prohibition of refoulement and/or the right to asylum, guaranteed by articles 18 and 19 of the Charter. Furthermore, short time limits are contrary to EU law if they render the exercise of the EU right to an effective remedy, or other procedural rights guaranteed by the Asylum Procedures Directive, impossible or excessively difficult. This is based on an analysis of EU legislation, the case law of the Court of Justice, and sources of inspiration of EU fundamental rights, in particular, the case law of the European Court of Human Rights. It is shown that time limits in asylum procedures should be reasonable and proportionate in general as well as in the individual asylum case. This article explores which factors should be taken into account when assessing time limits in the light of the EU right to an effective remedy and the principle of effectiveness in a particular case. © The Author (2014).
