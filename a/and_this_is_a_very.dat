2500|$|At the 6 June Bislett Games in Oslo, a Golden League event, Tirunesh Dibaba set a {{world record}} in the 5000 metres, running the {{distance}} in 14:11.15. Lucy Wangui Kabuu from Kenya ran a personal best and finished in second place, 22 seconds behind Dibaba. Tirunesh's sister Ejegayehu Dibaba finished in third place {{with a time of}} 14:36.78 (4.04 seconds off her personal best). Dibaba bettered Meseret Defar's world record by 5.48 seconds. Tirunesh said after the race, [...] "I've been thinking about {{this for a long time}} <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> special day for me. I was trying my best, and I knew I was going to break the record with two laps to go. The early part of the race was pretty good, but at 3000 metres we were a little behind, so then I had to catch up on the pace. I could have run faster if the pacing was a little better." [...] Tirunesh's 800 metre split times were: 2:13.7 - 2:19.0 (4:32.7 through 1600 metres) - 2:22.5 (6:55.2 through 2400 metres and 8:03.7 through 2800 metres) - 2:17.8 (9:13.0 through 3200 metres) - 2:15.4 (11:28.4 through 4000 metres)- 2:10.1 (13.38.5 though 4800 metres), with a last 200 metre split of 32.7.|$|E

60|$|In these {{chapters}} I have endeavoured to {{show that}} if we make due allowance for our ignorance of the full effects of changes of climate and {{of the level of}} the land, which have certainly occurred within the recent period, and of other changes which have probably occurred--if we remember how ignorant we are with respect to the many curious means of occasional transport--if we bear in mind, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> important consideration, how often a species may have ranged continuously over a wide area, and then have become extinct in the intermediate tracts--the difficulty is not insuperable in believing that all the individuals of the same species, wherever found, are descended from common parents. And we are led to this conclusion, which has been arrived at by many naturalists under the designation of single centres of creation, by various general considerations, more especially from the importance of barriers of all kinds, and from the analogical distribution of subgenera, genera, and families.|$|E

60|$|Cirri, {{moderately}} {{long and}} curled; the four posterior pair are alike; each segment has its anterior face somewhat protuberant, and bears six pairs of long spines, with a rather large, narrow tuft of intermediate spines, {{some of which}} are finely and doubly serrated. The dorsal tufts consist of short, thick spines, with some fine longer ones. The first cirrus is seated near the second; its rami are slightly unequal in length; lower segments paved with bristles; one ramus is thicker than the other, and some of its segments have coarsely pectinated spines. Second cirrus has the five basal segments of its anterior ramus highly protuberant, and paved with bristles, of which some are coarsely pectinated; the basal segments of the posterior ramus are rather more thickly clothed with bristles than are the posterior cirri, but otherwise resemble them. The third cirrus, as already stated, is exactly like the three posterior pairs; <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> unusual circumstance. On the dorsal surfaces and sides of the pedicels of the posterior cirri, there are some scattered, short, thick, minute spines.|$|E
60|$|First, {{for the one}} illegitimate short-styled plant. In {{the course}} of three seasons 27 flowers were illegitimately fertilised with pollen from the same plant, and they yielded only a single capsule, which, however, {{contained}} a rather large number of seeds for a union of this nature, namely, 23. As a standard of comparison I may state that during the same three seasons 44 flowers borne by legitimate short-styled plants were self-fertilised, and yielded 26 capsules; so that {{the fact of the}} 27 flowers on the illegitimate plant having produced only one capsule proves how sterile it was. To show that the conditions of life were favourable, I will add that numerous plants of this and other species of Primula all produced an abundance of capsules whilst growing close by in the same soil with the present and following plants. The sterility of the above illegitimate short-styled plant depended on both the male and female organs being in a deteriorated condition. This was manifestly the case with the pollen; for many of the anthers were shrivelled or contabescent. Nevertheless some of the anthers contained pollen, with which I succeeded in fertilising some flowers on the illegitimate long-styled plants immediately to be described. Four flowers on this same short-styled plant were likewise LEGITIMATELY fertilised with pollen from one of the following long-styled plants; but only one capsule was produced, containing 26 seeds; <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> low number for a legitimate union.|$|E

60|$|The Kings {{of these}} realms enjoy several powers, wherein the laws have not interposed: So {{they can make}} war and peace {{without the consent of}} Parliament; <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> great {{prerogative}}. But if the Parliament doth not approve of the war, the King must bear the charge of it out of his own purse, and this is as great a check on the crown. So the King hath a prerogative to coin money without consent of Parliament. But he cannot compel the subject to take that money except it be sterling, gold or silver; because herein he is limited by law. Some princes have indeed extended their prerogative further than the law allowed them; wherein however, the lawyers of succeeding ages, as fond as they are of precedents, have never dared to justify them. But to say the truth, it is only of late times that prerogative hath been fixed and ascertained. For whoever reads the histories of England, will find that some former Kings, and these none of the worst, have upon several occasions ventured to control the laws with very little ceremony or scruple, even later than the days of Queen Elizabeth. In her reign that pernicious counsel of sending base money hither, very narrowly failed of losing the kingdom, being complained of by the lord-deputy, the council, and the whole body of the English here:[5] So that soon after her death it was recalled by her successor, and lawful money paid in exchange.|$|E

I sent a letter early this morning to Lady Masham, to beg her to write some comforting words to the poor Duchess. I dined to-(day) with Lady Masham at Kensington, where she is expecting these two months to lie in. She has promised me to get the Queen to write to the Duchess kindly on this occasion; and to-morrow I will beg Lord Treasurer to visit and comfort her. I have been with her two hours again, and find her worse: her violences not so frequent, but her melancholy more formal and settled. She has abundance of wit and spirit; about thirty-three years old; handsome and airy, and seldom spared anybody that gave her the least provocation; by which she had many enemies and few friends. Lady Orkney, her sister-in-law, is come to town on this occasion, and has been to see her, and behaved herself with great humanity. They have been always very ill together, and the poor Duchess could not have patience when people told her I went often to Lady Orkney's. But I am resolved to make them friends; for the Duchess is now no more the object of envy, and must learn humility from the severest master, Affliction.
