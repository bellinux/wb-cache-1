Ten battalions (see List of battalions of the King's Regiment (Liverpool)) were formed between 1939 and 1940, including the reconstituted 8th (Liverpool Irish) Battalion. Two of the battalions converted to armour and anti-air roles in 1941: the 11th became the 152nd Regiment in the Royal Armoured Corps, but continued to wear their King's Regiment cap badge on the black beret of the RAC, as did all infantry units converted in this way, while the 12th transferred to the Royal Artillery as 101st Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment.|$|E

It was still a substantial building though, in the Italianate style, with almost 100 rooms on three storeys.|$|E

In 1944 Madgwick and colleagues began drafting their vision for post-war adult education and articulated their vision at the Workers Education Association of New South Wales Conference, held 10–11 March 1944 in Sydney. They followed-up the conference with a formal, published paper, which called for heavy Commonwealth government involvement and expenditures on adult education. Their proposed plan, however, was rejected by the Prime Minister's office, which, to Madgwick's disappointment selected <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>modest</b> program. Madgwick's active duty service ended in March 1946 and he was transferred to reserve officer status on 19 April 1946.|$|E

William had attempted a series of educational and career paths, and a venture into farming in 1830 led to huge losses, which his father repaid in full, despite offers from others to assist. This left Wilberforce with little income, and he was obliged to let his home and {{spend the rest of}} his life visiting family members and friends.

His employers then sent him to work at their manufacturing plant in Hercules, California on San Francisco Bay, where he earned a relatively high wage of $100 a month; he was plagued by headaches caused by exposure to nitroglycerin. He saved money in the hope of continuing his academic studies and began a degree in chemistry at Stanford University, but found the tuition fees unaffordable and returned to Pasadena.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Labor Party Governments led by Prime Ministers Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard between 2007 and 2013 {{commissioned}} two defence white papers, {{which were}} published in 2009 and 2013.

This increase in spending did not occur, however. The Defence White Paper 2013 had similar strategic themes, but set out <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>modest</b> program of defence spending which reflected the government's constrained finances. As part of an election commitment, the Liberal-National Party Abbott Government commissioned a further defence white paper that was published in 2016.

They failed to inflict any permanent damage before being driven off by near misses. Both ships had their anti-aircraft armament modernized and reinforced over the winter of 1939–40 and were transferred to Tallinn shortly after the Soviets occupied Estonia in 1940. Oktyabrskaya Revolyutsiya received more AA guns in February–March 1941.

5|$|To {{promote the}} {{missions}} {{as a tourist}} destination, travel agencies, chambers of commerce and industry, the towns' mayors, native communities and other institutions organized the , a five-day tourist event lasting from March 23–27, 2006. Journalists and international tour operators were shown the important tourist attractions, and introduced to the culture through visits to museums, local workshops, various concerts, native dances, high masses, processions, crafts festivals, and local cuisine. The organisers’ goal initially was to raise the number of tourists from 25,000 to 1 million per year over a ten-year period, which would have represented US$400 million of income. Subsequently, {{in the face of}} lack of support from the Bolivian government and the downturn of the national and local economies, <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>modest</b> goal of attracting between 200,000 and 250,000 people per annum was established.|$|E

At the end of 2001 the league began a relationship with America One that would last until 2009. Coverage was relatively generous with 43 games, including the playoffs, covered in the last year. <b>A</b> <b>more</b> <b>modest</b> deal of 14 games was negotiated with the NFL Network in 2010, which lasted two years. The 2012 season began without a contract and the league resorted to internet broadcasts on ESPN3 until NBC Sports Network agreed to a 14-game regular season package of its own; unlike the NFL network, NBC opted to broadcast games during the NFL preseason as well as cover the playoffs and Grey Cup. Both the NBC and ESPN deals were renewed in 2013 with a slight scaling back of playoff coverage and ESPN2 also picking up a handful of games in the summer months. American broadcasts have been simulcasts of game coverage from Canadian networks.|$|E

He then considered <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>modest</b> proposal, based on the original Bristol and Western plans, and the scheme, now renamed the Bristol and Taunton Canal, was authorised by an Act of Parliament dated 14 May 1811. The company had powers to raise £420,000 in shares and an additional £150,000 if required, but economic concerns meant that the project did not start immediately. Powers for the Bristol to Bridgwater section lapsed in 1815, but work finally commenced in 1822, to be halted by an injunction because the authorised route was not being followed. A further Act, of 17 June 1824, authorised the revised route, and changed the name of the project to the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal Company. The predicted costs for the construction of the shorter canal were £34,145, as opposed to £429,990 for the longer scheme.|$|E
5|$|Whilst Wigan Warriors and Wigan Athletic {{flourished in}} the new stadium (Wigan Athletic in {{particular}} would achieve significant success, rising up the English football pyramid to the Premier League by 2005), Orrell R.U.F.C. did not. Dave Whelan and Maurice Lindsay decided to invest heavily in the club, {{with the aim of}} having the club play in rugby union's Guinness Premiership at the stadium. After failing to win 2004's National Division Two, Whelan pulled a large amount of investment from the club, to <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>modest</b> GB£30,000 a year. This was the beginning of Orrell's demise, as players left during the summer of that year and the club were consequently relegated the season after. Ownership eventually passed from Lindsay back to the club's members, but by this point, Orrell had sold their former Edge Hall Road ground to Dave Whelan's company, Whelco Holdings, and therefore had no assets apart from their rebuilt clubhouse following a fire in 2002. Orrell never settled at the JJB Stadium, and were eventually de-professionalised {{at the end of the}} 2006–07 season.|$|E

5|$|Entering the presidency, Garfield {{had little}} foreign policy experience, so he leaned heavily on Blaine. Blaine, a former protectionist, now agreed with Garfield {{on the need}} to promote freer trade, {{especially}} within the Western Hemisphere. Their reasons were twofold: firstly, Garfield and Blaine believed that increasing trade with Latin America would {{be the best way to}} keep Great Britain from dominating the region. Secondly, by encouraging exports, they believed they could increase American prosperity. Garfield authorized Blaine to call for a Pan-American conference in 1882 to mediate disputes among the Latin American nations and to serve as a forum for talks on increasing trade. At the same time, they hoped to negotiate a peace in the War of the Pacific then being fought by Bolivia, Chile, and Peru. Blaine favored a resolution that would not result in Peru yielding any territory, but Chile, which by 1881 had occupied the Peruvian capital, Lima, rejected any settlement that restored the previous status quo. Garfield sought to expand American influence in other areas, calling for renegotiation of the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty to allow the United States to construct a canal through Panama without British involvement, as well as attempting to reduce British influence in the strategically located Kingdom of Hawaii. Garfield's and Blaine's plans for the United States' involvement in the world stretched even beyond the Western Hemisphere, as he sought commercial treaties with Korea and Madagascar. Garfield also considered enhancing the United States' military strength abroad, asking Navy Secretary Hunt to investigate the condition of the navy with an eye toward expansion and modernization. In the end, these ambitious plans came to nothing after Garfield was assassinated. Nine countries had accepted invitations to the Pan-American conference, but the invitations were withdrawn in April 1882 after Blaine resigned from the cabinet and Arthur, Garfield's successor, cancelled the conference. Naval reform continued under Arthur, if on <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>modest</b> scale than Garfield and Hunt had envisioned, ultimately ending in the construction of the Squadron of Evolution.|$|E
