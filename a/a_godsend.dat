25|$|For Zedler this {{document}} restricting {{the scope of}} the imperial privilege was <b>a</b> <b>godsend,</b> because it secured the continuation of his lexicon. The philosophy professor Carl Günther Ludovici, a classmate of Longolius, took over as editor of the Universal Lexicon from Volume 19. Schultze stopped printing further volumes of the Universal Lexicon's in 1745 because of financial difficulties.|$|E
25|$|Having long endured {{so-called}} dhimmi status, {{and having}} suffered the brutality and oppression of Hamidian leadership since 1876, the Armenian minority in Cilicia perceived the nascent Young Turk government as <b>a</b> <b>godsend.</b> With Christians now being granted {{the right to}} arm themselves and form politically significant groups, {{it was not long}} before Abdul Hamid loyalists, themselves acculturated into the system that had perpetrated the Hamidian massacres of the 1890s, came to view the empowerment of the Christian minority as coming at their expense.|$|E
25|$|The 20th-century Reform rabbi {{and author}} Gunther Plaut argued that Isaac {{was not really}} deceived. Reading the story with close {{attention}} to the personality of Isaac, Plaut concluded that throughout the episode, Isaac was subconsciously aware of Jacob's identity, but, as he was unable to admit this knowledge, he pretended to be deceived. Plaut thus saw a plot within a plot, as Rebekah and Jacob laid elaborate plans for deceiving Isaac, while unknown to them Isaac looked for a way to deceive himself, in order to carry out God's design to bless his less-loved son. Plaut argued that Isaac was old but not senile. In his heart, Isaac had long known that Esau could not carry on the burden of Abraham and that, instead, he had to choose his quiet and complicated younger son Jacob. In Plaut's reading, weak and indecisive man and father that Isaac was, {{he did not have the}} courage to face Esau with the truth. His own blindness and Rebekah's ruse came literally as <b>a</b> <b>godsend.</b> Plaut noted that Isaac did not reprimand Jacob. Plaut concluded that no one, not even Esau, was deceived, for even Esau knew that Jacob was the chosen one.|$|E

50|$|In a {{memorial}} speech, his son Osman Kurdaş said Kemal Kurdas followed {{as many as}} ten different paths. His legacy includes publications giving sound policy advice to developing countries, a university that every year produces thousands of graduates and about a thousand scientific articles, a forest that is <b>an</b> environmental <b>godsend,</b> <b>a</b> wide range of Turkish businesses, the METU museum where fascinating artifacts from Gobekli Tepe were shown at a 2011 exhibit, and perhaps most important, an attitude of tolerance and open-mindedness that is all too rare {{not only in the}} Middle East but {{in other parts of the}} world.|$|R

25|$|The Ottoman envoy's mission {{had been}} <b>a</b> <b>godsend</b> for the Bey. Not {{only did he}} make {{a show of force}} to deter the European powers, he also brought desperately-needed {{financial}} support in the amount of 0.5m francs in gold coin. At the same time the government was able to raise further funds by selling the coming olive harvest to European traders in advance, with Khaznadar once again profiting from the transaction. This allowed the Bey to re-recruit 2,000 zouaoua troops who had been dismissed from service by his predecessor Muhammad Bey for grave indiscipline. As they were Kabyles from Algeria, their loyalty could be relied on as they had no ties to the Arab tribal leaders of the rebellion. The Bey was also able to use some of this money to begin buying off some of the tribal leaders, and mistrust started to spread among the rebels. The fear grew that if the uprising continued, the country would end up being occupied by the French army. The rebellion began to falter. In the countryside, people wanted to return to their fields in time for the harvest; in the coastal towns, fear of brigandage by the nomadic tribes led by Ali Ben Ghedhahem made them wary of throwing their lot in with the insurgents of the interior.|$|E
500|$|The delays proved {{beneficial}} in some regards. The script was refined during production, and the unreliable mechanical sharks forced Spielberg to shoot many scenes {{so that the}} shark was only hinted at. For example, {{for much of the}} shark hunt, its location is indicated by the floating yellow barrels. The opening had the shark devouring Chrissie, but it was rewritten so that it would be shot with Backlinie being dragged and yanked by cables to simulate an attack. Spielberg also included multiple shots of just the dorsal fin. This forced restraint is widely thought to have added to the film's suspense. As Spielberg put it years later, [...] "The film went from a Japanese Saturday matinee horror flick to more of a Hitchcock, the less-you-see-the-more-you-get thriller." [...] In another interview, he similarly declared, [...] "The shark not working was <b>a</b> <b>godsend.</b> It made me become more like Alfred Hitchcock than like Ray Harryhausen." [...] The acting became crucial for making audiences believe in such a big shark: [...] "The more fake the shark looked in the water, the more my anxiety told me to heighten the naturalism of the performances." ...|$|E
500|$|For Angels fifth season, as with Buffys fourth, Spike {{steps in}} to replace Cordelia {{as a source}} of comedic {{dialogue}} within the series. It is also noted by critics that, in the fifth season, [...] "it doesn't take long for Illyria to become a version of Cordelia, giving everyone the cold and honest truth whether they want it or not". Concerning Cordelia's last appearance in Angels fifth and final season, Joss Whedon says he used the 100th episode to reinforce the [...] "mission statement" [...] of the show, as well as assess where the characters are now compared to how they began. Whedon explains this episode presents an ideal opportunity to—through Cordelia, who was [...] "there at the beginning"—ask of Angel, [...] "Where are you now? Where were you when you started and where are you now and {{how do you feel about}} that?" [...] The return to the show's [...] "original concerns" [...] is echoed by the flashback to Doyle's first season advertisement; Sara Upstone points out aerial images of Los Angeles reappear at the same time Cordelia tells Angel [...] "You forgot who you are," [...] bringing back the show's link to the city. Buffy Summers was originally intended to appear in the 100th episode to get Angel 'back on track', but Sarah Michelle Gellar had other obligations. Writer/director David Fury explains that since [...] "we couldn't get Sarah" [...] the episode was instead written for Cordelia. He adds, [...] "This turned out to be <b>a</b> <b>Godsend</b> because Charisma was fantastic." [...] In the original script, Fury wrote a conversation between Wesley and Angel while driving to the hospital that set up Cordelia as a possible vegetable. The scene was never shot because [...] "the shock of seeing her up and around after a 9-month coma was enough. We just didn't want to tip it too soon," [...] says Fury.|$|E

500|$|In March 1955, St. Laurent tabled {{legislation}} {{to make the}} Department of Defence Production permanent. This would also extend the extraordinary powers of the Minister. [...] Fearful of another damaging confrontation between Howe and the Opposition, the Cabinet agreed that St. Laurent would guide the bill through, but after {{the first day of}} debate St. Laurent, who was prone to depression, absented himself. Tory frontbencher Donald Fleming contended that the extension could make the minister [...] "the virtual dictator of the economy". [...] With St. Laurent absent (or when present, silent), Howe took charge of the bill, and according to his biographers, Robert Bothwell and William Kilbourn, [...] "utterly failed to perceive that the bill and his manner of defending it were <b>a</b> <b>godsend</b> to the opposition". When Howe alluded to the Avro Arrow project and that he [...] "was out on a limb for $30 million", which gave him [...] "the shudders", the Opposition met the statement with jeers and cries of [...] "What's a million?" [...] The Tories were supported by the Social Credit MPs, while the Government gained the support of the CCF on this issue. [...] Interrupted by a lengthy governmental trip by Howe to Australia and New Zealand, the debate stretched on until midyear. In early July, Howe left town for a long weekend, after asking St. Laurent and Minister of Finance Walter Harris to maintain his stand while he was gone, although he gave Harris the authority to do as he saw fit. Without informing Howe, St. Laurent contacted Drew, and the two men agreed that the minister's powers would expire in 1959 unless sooner renewed. The amended bill passed the Commons in Howe's absence, and when he returned, he furiously accused Harris of making a deal behind his back. However, when Howe was told that it had been the Prime Minister's decision, he accepted it. [...] Howe had earlier turned down an Opposition offer to agree to a three-year extension of his ministerial powers, saying [...] "That would mean coming back to Parliament in three years, and I've more to do with my time than amusing Parliament." [...] The extension was allowed to expire in 1959, although by then, Howe had left office.|$|E

2500|$|This policy {{continued}} {{after the}} French revolution, as France was clearly {{in need of}} an eastern diversion against its continental enemies. For the Ottoman Empire, the French Revolution was <b>a</b> <b>godsend,</b> since conflict between European powers could only weaken the states that were its traditional enemies. For Sultan Selim III, this was a golden opportunity to modernize, and achieve the [...] "New Order" [...] (Nizam-i Jedid). He established permanent embassies in several European countries, and turned to France for help. Various experts were sent, and in 1795, French envoy extraordinaire [...] attempted to establish a Treaty of Alliance. A young artillery officer {{by the name of}} Napoleon Bonaparte was also to be sent to Constantinople in 1795 to help organize Ottoman artillery.

2500|$|Goulding {{explained}} that the album [...] "is made up of songs that all started on a guitar {{over a period of}} about two years. A number of the songs vent romantic victories and failures."

2500|$|In the meantime, {{the fall}} of Bucharest had left Romania divided: King Ferdinand, his government, and the army {{proceeded}} to Western Moldavia, where they continued resistance; in the Wallachian south, Conservative Lupu Kostaki and his allies tolerated, or collaborated with, the German occupation. Mariu was one of Kostaki's associates, and, in January 1918, was appointed secretary of the Wallachian Bishopric, an Orthodox institution. His Catholicism having been revealed to the public, he was forced two resign a few days into his office. A few weeks after, Marghiloman was called upon to form a cabinet and negotiate a peace with the Central Powers (which was signed in May 1918). Mariu believed that Marghiloman was <b>a</b> <b>godsend</b> for Romania: [...] "he managed to defend the dynasty and protect the army from being disarmed". He ran in the 1918 election, taking a seat in Senate for Ilfov County, and resuming his work for the unification of churches. His major effort was in supporting the Romanians of Northern Dobruja, which Romania had effectively ceded to Greater Bulgaria. Mariu Theodorian suggested that Orthodox Romanians, forcefully integrated into Bulgarian Orthodoxy, protect themselves by mass-converting to Catholicism.|$|E
2500|$|In Cairo Maclean dined with Alexander Cadogan, his FO superior, and {{the next}} day {{reported}} to Anthony Eden, the Foreign Secretary. [...] He stated his conclusions straightforwardly: that the Partisans were important militarily and politically and would influence the future of Yugoslavia whether the Allies helped them or not; their impact on the Germans could be greatly increased by Allied support; they were Communist and oriented towards the USSR. He says that his report created [...] "something of a stir". [...] He was sent back to collect two Yugoslav liasison officers who had not been allowed to come out with him on the first Navy pick-up. [...] From Bari on the Italian Adriatic coast, now a centre of operations for the Tactical Air Force, he saw that this would prove difficult, as the German offensive had captured the whole Dalmatian coast. Fortunately, he had asked Air Marshal Sholto Douglas to assign him a liaison officer, and Wing Commander John Selby proved <b>a</b> <b>godsend.</b> [...] Together they obtained the use of a Baltimore bomber and an escort of Lightnings. Twice they set out from Italy on a sunny day and twice the clouds blocked them from the Bosnian hills. On the third day the fighters were unavailable so the bomber set out alone, but again the weather made it impossible to land. [...] On their return to Italy, they received a signal that the Partisans had captured a small German plane that they proposed to use. [...] As they were loading up the plane, an enemy aircraft, alerted by a traitor, bombed the landing strip at Glamoc, killing Whetherly, Knight, and Ribar, and wounding Milojevic. This event, at the end of November, proved a spur to getting the mission higher priority, and soon Maclean got a large Dakota and half a squadron of Lightnings to complete the landing operation. [...] Milojevic and Velebit accompanied Maclean to Alexandria, where the Yugoslavs decompressed for a few days, while Maclean sought out the prime minister.|$|E
