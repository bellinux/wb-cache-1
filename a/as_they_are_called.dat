5|$|After the Clarno volcanoes had subsided, {{they were}} {{replaced}} about 36million {{years ago by}} eruptions from volcanoes to the west, in the general vicinity of {{what would become the}} Cascade Range. The John Day volcanoes, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>called,</b> emitted large volumes of ash and dust, much of which settled in the John Day basin. As with the earlier Clarno debris flows, the rapid deposition of ash preserved the remains of plants and animals living in the region. Because ash and other debris fell during varied climatic and volcanic conditions and accumulated from many further eruptions extending into the early Miocene (about 20million years ago), the sediment layers in the fossil beds vary in their chemical composition and color. Laid down on top of the Clarno Strata, the younger John Day Strata consist of several distinct groups of layers. The lowermost contains red ash such as that exposed in the Painted Hills Unit. The layer above it is mainly pea-green clay. On top of the pea-green layer are buff-colored layers. Fossils found in the John Day Strata include a wide variety of plants and more than 100 species of mammals, including dogs, cats, oreodonts, saber-toothed tigers, horses, camels, and rodents. The Blue Basin and the Sheep Rock unit contain many of these same fossils, as well as turtles, opossums, and large pigs. More than 60 plant species are fossilized in these strata, such as hydrangea, peas, hawthorn, and mulberry, as well as pines and many deciduous trees. One of the notable plant fossils is the Metasequoia (dawn redwood), a genus thought to have gone extinct worldwide until it was discovered alive in China in the early 20thcentury.|$|E

It was at Aston however that on 10 June 1844 the first Corpus Christi procession was held in the British Isles, an event which attracted thousands of Catholics and Protestants alike. Barberi then began to visit other parishes and religious communities in order to preach, such 'missions' <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>called</b> caused Barberi's reputation to become widely known in England. These missions frequently took place in the industrial cities of northern England, such as Manchester, Liverpool and Birmingham.|$|E
25|$|The Cascade Range is a mountainous region {{stretching}} from the Fraser River in British Columbia, Canada down to south of Lassen Peak, California. The Cascades (<b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>called</b> for short) {{are part of the}} Pacific Ring of Fire, the ring of volcanoes around the Pacific Ocean. All of the known historic eruptions in the contiguous United States have been from either Cascade volcanoes or near Mono Lake. Lassen Peak was the last Cascade volcano to erupt in California, from 1914 to 1921. Lassen is the most southerly active volcano of the Cascade chain.|$|E

By the time the platform has completed almost a full rotation, another milker or a machine removes the cups and the cow steps backwards off the platform and then walks to its feed. Rotary cowsheds, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>called</b> in New Zealand, started in the 1980s but are expensive compared to Herringbone cowshed - the older New Zealand norm.|$|E

The Crown also entered {{into a series of}} numbered treaties with the indigenous peoples of the area, which serve as the basis of the relationship between First Nations, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>called</b> today, and the Crown. Since the late twentieth century, land losses and inequities as a result of those treaties have been subject to negotiation for settlement between the First Nations in Saskatchewan and the federal government, in collaboration with provincial governments.|$|E
25|$|In England and Wales, {{the law of}} arms is {{regarded}} {{as a part of the}} laws of England, and the common law courts will take judicial notice of it as such. These dignities, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>called,</b> have legal standing. But the law of arms is not part of the common law and the common law Courts have no jurisdiction over matters of dignities and honours, such as armorial bearings, or peerages. In this respect the law of arms was most influenced by the civil law and may be regarded as similar to the ecclesiastical law, which is a part of the laws of England influenced by canon law, but not part of the common law.|$|E

25|$|Hogwarts {{is divided}} into four houses, each bearing the last name of its founder: Godric Gryffindor, Salazar Slytherin, Rowena Ravenclaw and Helga Hufflepuff. Throughout the school year, the houses compete for the House Cup, gaining and losing points based on actions such as {{performance}} in class and rule violations. The house with the highest end-of-year total wins and has its colours displayed in the Great Hall for the following school year. Each house also has its own Quidditch team that competes for the Quidditch Cup. These two competitions breed rivalries between the houses. Houses at Hogwarts are living and learning communities for their students. Each house is {{under the authority of}} one of the Hogwarts staff members. The Heads of the houses, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>called,</b> are in charge of giving their students important information, dealing with matters of severe punishment, and responding to emergencies in their houses, among other things.

Among these officials were the [...] "Roman governors", <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>called</b> in English: either magistrates elected at Rome who {{in the name of}} the Roman people governed senatorial provinces; or governors, usually of equestrian rank, who held their imperium on behalf of the emperor in provinces excluded from senatorial control, most notably Roman Egypt. A governor had to make himself accessible to the people he governed, but he could delegate various duties. His staff, however, was minimal: his official attendants (apparitores), including lictors, heralds, messengers, scribes, and bodyguards; legates, both civil and military, usually of equestrian rank; and friends, ranging in age and experience, who accompanied him unofficially.|$|E
