5|$|In 1985, Goldstone {{ruled that}} the government's mass sacking of 1,700 black staff at Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto had been illegal. The {{following}} year, {{he was the first}} judge to free a political prisoner who had been detained under a recently imposed state of emergency under which the government had given itself draconian police powers. Another important ruling against the state in 1988 resulted in the release of a detainee who had not been advised by the police that he was entitled to a lawyer. In 1989, Goldstone became the first South African judge under apartheid to take on a black law clerk, an African-American Yale Law student named Vernon Grigg. Goldstone also used his judicial prerogatives to visit thousands of people who had been imprisoned without trial, including some who later became members of the post-apartheid South African government. Although he could do little to free them, his visits served to reassure the prisoners – and serve notice to the prison administration – that someone in <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> was taking an active interest in their well-being. Few white judges at the time enjoyed the trust and respect of the black majority; Goldstone became a notable exception.|$|E

25|$|Undue {{influence}} is an equitable doctrine that involves one person {{taking advantage of}} <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> over another person through a special relationship such as between parent and child or solicitor and client.

When no special relationship exists, {{the question is whether}} there was a relationship of such trust and confidence that it should give rise to such a presumption.|$|E

The youngest brother, Benjamin, had remained in Canaan with Jacob, so Joseph takes Simeon hostage and {{insists that the}} brothers return with Benjamin. Judah offers himself to Jacob as surety for Benjamin's safety, and manages to persuade Jacob to let them take Benjamin to Egypt. When the brothers return, Joseph tests them by demanding the enslavement of Benjamin. Judah pleads for Benjamin's life, and Joseph reveals his true identity.|$|E
25|$|Paraguayan {{women had}} a {{significant}} role in the Paraguayan War. During the period just before the war began many Paraguayan women were the heads of their households, meaning they held <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> and authority. They received such positions by being widows, having children out of wedlock, or their husbands worked as peons. When the war began women started to venture out of the home becoming nurses, working with government, and establishing themselves into the public sphere. When the New York Times reported on the war in 1868 they considered Paraguayan women equal to their male counterparts.|$|E

She {{was a member of}} the Prussian parliament from 1923 to 1933, advising on economic matters. It was unusual for a woman in the 1920s and 1930s to be in <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> within the German union movement, and Kähler became one of Germany's most visible female trade union officials, representing the Movement at the 1927 International Trade Union Congress held in Paris.|$|E

In 1888 she married Prince Amadeo, Duke of Aosta, the former king of Spain. Maria Letizia became the Duchess of Aosta, Duke of Aosta being a title by which Amadeus was known before and after his kingship. Their marriage was instrumental in almost reviving French hopes of reinstating the Bonaparte dynasty into <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>power,</b> as seen in the days of Napoleon III.|$|E
25|$|The Bene Gesserit are {{notable for}} their {{extensive}} skill in seduction, sex and sexual imprinting. The most talented and most highly trained {{are known as}} Imprinters. Men in <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> or future power, or those with specific qualities that the order wishes to incorporate into their breeding program, are typical targets of a Bene Gesserit imprinter. Men seduced by an imprinter are permanently affected (imprinted) by the intense sexual experience and are thereafter consciously or subconsciously favorable to the Sisterhood. An imprinter can be successfully resisted if the subject has been psychologically pre-conditioned to do so, and the subject's automatic defensive response may even be entirely subconscious.|$|E

25|$|The Cultural Revolution, {{formally}} the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, was a sociopolitical {{movement that}} took place in China from 1966 until 1976. Set into motion by Mao Zedong, then Chairman of the Communist Party of China, its stated goal was to preserve 'true' Communist ideology in the country by purging remnants of capitalist and traditional elements from Chinese society, and to re-impose Maoist thought as the dominant ideology within the Party. The Revolution marked the return of Mao Zedong to <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> after the Great Leap Forward. The movement paralyzed China politically and negatively affected the country's economy and society to a significant degree.|$|E
25|$|The {{formation}} of the Labor–Green alliance resulted {{in one of the}} biggest scandals in Tasmanian political history. Launceston businessman Edmund Rouse was the managing director of ENT Limited, Tasmania's largest media company. Returning to Tasmania from an overseas trip shortly after the election, Rouse was dismayed to find the Greens in <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> in government, and was determined to take on what he saw as a grave threat to the Tasmanian and Australian economies. In particular, Rouse was concerned with the effect on the Tasmanian timber company Gunns, of which he was chairman, and which he thought stood to lose between $10 million and $15 million {{as a result of the}} Greens' environmental policies.|$|E
25|$|Her {{greatest}} {{period of}} reform activity was after her retirement {{from the medical}} profession, from 1880–1895. Blackwell was interested in {{a great number of}} reform movements– mainly moral reform, sexual purity, hygiene and medical education, but also preventative medicine, sanitation, eugenics, family planning, women's rights, associationism, Christian socialism, medical ethics and antivivisection– none of which ever came to real fruition. She switched back and forth between many different reform organisations, trying to maintain <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> in each. Blackwell had a lofty, elusive and ultimately unattainable goal: evangelical moral perfection. All of her reform work was along this thread. She even contributed heavily to the founding of two utopian communities: Starnthwaite and Hadleigh in the 1880s.|$|E

25|$|The Burmese then laid siege to Ayutthaya city. After heavy cannon fire {{put a stop}} to Burmese {{attempts}} at digging up to the walls, the invaders began building a bridge at Koh Keo in order to access the walls from a new direction. Maha Chakkraphat died {{during the course of the}} siege, therefore his son Mahinthrathirat ascended the throne. Frequent Ayutthaya sorties once again prevented the Burmese from finishing the construction. Bayinnaung then sent an Ayutthayan noble he held captive under the guise of a deserter. Not only was the spy allowed into the city but he was also put into <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>power.</b> On the night of 2 August 1569, the spy opened the gates of the city, bringing its downfall. Mahinthrathirat along with his family and the nobility were captured and taken to Pegu. Mahinthrathirat died in the same year on the way. Ayutthaya became a Burmese vassal state, with Mahathammarachathirat as appointed king.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of Anglo-Saxon kingship is little understood but the model proposed by Yorke, considered the {{development of}} kingdoms and writing down of the oral law-codes {{to be linked to}} a progression towards leaders providing mund and receiving recognition. These leaders who developed in the sixth century, were able to seize the initiative and to establish <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> for themselves and their successors. Anglo-Saxon leaders, unable to tax and coerce followers instead extracted surplus by raiding and collecting food renders and 'prestige goods'. The later sixth century saw the end of a 'prestige goods' economy, as evidenced by the decline of accompanied burial, and the appearance of the first princely graves and high-status settlements. These centres of trade and production reflect the increased socio-political stratification and wider territorial authority which allowed seventh-century elites to extract and redistribute surpluses with far greater effectiveness than their sixth-century predecessors would have found possible. Anglo-Saxon society, in short, looked very different in 600 than it did a hundred years earlier.|$|E

At the Syrian Ba'athist Regional Congress, the Military Committee [...] "proved" [...] that it was rebelling equally against Aflaq and the traditional leadership, as against their moderate social and economic policies. The Military Committee was bent on removing Aflaq from <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>power,</b> believing that he had become old and frail.|$|E

Roxas had been a leading Japanese collaborator serving in the puppet government of Jose Laurel, but MacArthur claimed that Roxas had secretly been an American agent all the long. About MacArthur's claim that Roxas was really part of the resistance, the American historian Gerhard Weinberg wrote that [...] "...evidence to this effect has yet to surface", and that by favoring the Japanese collaborator Roxas, MacArthur ensured there was no serious effort to address the issue of Filipino collaboration with the Japanese after the war.|$|E
