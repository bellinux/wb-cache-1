A link has been established between this group and a similar network in Chicago. Currently, Five Ways' main partner school <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>is</b> Walter Payton College Preparatory High School which is a Math, Science and World Language High School. This is a CPD link aimed mainly at senior management at the moment. An exchange is currently taking place. The intention is to broaden this link to encompass teachers at all levels.|$|E
25|$|The channel has {{sometimes}} been judged, increasingly in more recent years, to have moved away from this original role and to have {{moved closer to the}} mainstream. Since the launch of the digital-only BBC Four, the BBC has been accused in particular of shifting its more highbrow output to the new channel, which, {{until the end of the}} UK's digital TV switchover in October 2012, a minority (7.5% in the final quarter of 2010) of viewers did not receive. BBC Four's remit is very similar to that of the earlier remit of BBC2, and contains many documentaries and arts programmes. It has been perceived by some that this strategy is to allow BBC Two to show more popular programmes and to secure higher ratings. Since 2004 there have been some signs of an attempt to return closer to parts of BBC Two's earlier output with the arts strand The Culture Show. Its most popular programme <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>is</b> Top Gear.|$|E

500|$|He bemoaned the Conservatives {{when they}} were in Opposition, criticising Michael Howard in particular: [...] "I knew Michael Howard {{was going to be a}} {{disaster}} as soon as he opposed top-up fees, either out of sentimentality or calculated expediency so that it might get him a bit of the student vote...Instead of backing Tony Blair, causing revolution in the Labour Party, the Conservatives have been whoring after strange gods, coming up with increasingly strange policies." [...] He likened Gordon Brown to the fictional Kenneth Widmerpool, continuing, [...] "It seems to me that with Brown there is a complete sense of humour and charm bypass." [...] Of Ed Miliband, in 2015 he said [...] "He is a man of high ambition and low talent – the worst possible combination.

Although we are joined with England by land, and we are part of Great Britain, Wales is a country in its own right." [...] The title Prince of Wales is still conferred on the heir apparent to the British throne, currently Prince Charles. However the Prince of Wales has no constitutional role in modern Wales. According to the Welsh Government: [...] "Our Prince of Wales <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>is</b> Prince Charles, who is the present heir to the throne.

500|$|That winter, The Cricketer {{magazine}} named Chapman {{as a young}} cricketer of the year. However, at {{the beginning}} of the 1922 season, his form was so poor that critics suggested leaving him out of the University Match. He had scored 300 runs from 14 innings, but retained his place partially on the strength of his fielding. After Cambridge batted very slowly on the first day, Chapman attacked the bowling on the second morning to score 102 not out. Cambridge won easily, concluding Chapman's cricket at the university, but his innings impressed critics to the extent that he was again selected for the Gentlemen v Players match at Lord's. There, he scored 160 and shared century partnerships with Arthur Carr and Frank Mann. Chapman earned praise for his aggression and his stroke-play on the off side. The Times described it as [...] "one of the great innings in the history of the game". Shortly after this, Sydney Pardon wrote in The Times: [...] "In the cricket field the most interesting figure <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>is,</b> beyond all comparison, Mr. A. P. F. Chapman. A fortnight ago we were all lamenting his ill-success this season and wondering whether he would ever do justice to his great gifts and fulfil the hopes entertained of him in 1920. Most effectually he has put his critics to shame... in such a position that if an England eleven had to meet Australia next week he would be picked at once with acclamation." [...] Prior to this, only R. E. Foster had scored centuries in both the University Match and the Gentlemen v Players match in the same year. Chapman ended his season by scoring 805 runs and taking 19 wickets for Berkshire, and playing in festival games. He aggregated 607 runs at 33.72 in first-class matches for the season.|$|E

2500|$|Artificial {{intelligence}} is {{breaking into the}} healthcare industry by assisting doctors. According to Bloomberg Technology, Microsoft has developed AI to help doctors find the right treatments for cancer. There is {{a great amount of}} research and drugs developed relating to cancer. In detail, there are more than 800 medicines and vaccines to treat cancer. This negatively affects the doctors, because there are too many options to choose from, making it more difficult to choose the right drugs for the patients. Microsoft is working on a project to develop a machine called [...] "Hanover". Its goal is to memorize all the papers necessary to cancer and help predict which combinations of drugs will be most effective for each patient. One project that is being worked on <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>is</b> fighting myeloid leukemia, a fatal cancer where the treatment has not improved in decades. Another study was reported to have found that artificial intelligence was as good as trained doctors in identifying skin cancers. Another study is using artificial intelligence to try and monitor multiple high-risk patients, and this is done by asking each patient numerous questions based on data acquired from live doctor to patient interactions.|$|E
