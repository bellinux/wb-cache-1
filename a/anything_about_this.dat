25|$|You can't say <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> {{because it}} will screw up our source and there's a real concern. Mitchell {{is the only one}} who knows about this and he feels {{strongly}} that we better not do anything because... if we move on him, he'll go out and unload everything. He knows everything that's to be known in the FBI. He has access to absolutely everything.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} fragment is the First Partheneion or Louvre-Partheneion, found in 1855 in Saqqara in Egypt by the French scholar Auguste Mariette. This Partheneion consists of 101 lines, of {{which more than}} 30 are severely damaged. It {{is very hard to}} say <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> fragment, and scholars have debated ever since the discovery and publication about its content and the occasion on which this partheneion could have been performed.|$|E
2500|$|A {{week after}} the story broke, while the {{investigations}} were still ongoing, Taoiseach Enda Kenny, stated: [...] "I don't think we should say <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> until we are in possession of all the facts." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If I know <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> it, <b>this</b> {{storm is}} going to last for some time," [...] said the captain, after {{a long look at}} the sky.|$|R
50|$|It {{is remarkably}} {{difficult}} to find <b>anything</b> definitive <b>about</b> <b>this</b> period, particularly the period 1987-1991, {{and it is not}} clear why.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mother, did aunt say <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> coming <b>this</b> week?" [...] asked Polly, {{after a pause}} {{of intense}} thought over a breadth with three darns, two spots, and a burn.|$|R
2500|$|In The Lord of the Rings film trilogy, {{the wearer}} of the Ring is always portrayed as moving through a shadowy realm where {{everything}} is distorted. In the book, neither Bilbo Baggins nor Frodo Baggins ever mentioned <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> while using the Ring, but when Sam puts on the Ring {{at the end of}} The Two Towers he does experience something similar to this. Sam never wore the Ring on screen in Jackson's films. [...] The actual Ring for the movies was designed and created by Jens Hansen Gold & Silversmith in Nelson, New Zealand, and was based on a simple wedding ring.|$|E
2500|$|On the way Israel is {{perceived}} in the Netherlands: [...] "The crisis of Dutch socialism can be sized {{up in its}} attitudes toward both Islam and Israel. It holds Israel to exceptionally high moral standards. The Israelis, however, will always do well, because they themselves set high standards for their actions. The standards for judging the Palestinians, however, are very low. Most outsiders remain silent on all the problems in their territories. That helps the Palestinians become even more corrupt than they already are. Those {{who live in the}} territories are not allowed to say <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> because they risk being murdered by their own people." ...|$|E
2500|$|Before his death, Kaduri {{had said}} that he {{expected}} the Mashiach, the Jewish Messiah, to arrive soon, {{and that he had}} met him a year earlier. It has been alleged that he left a hand-written note to his followers and they were reportedly instructed to only open the note after Rabbi Kaduri had been dead for one year. After this time period had passed, the note was opened by these followers and was found to read, [...] "" [...] (translated as [...] "he will raise the people and confirm that his word and law are standing"), which by acronym, suggested the name [...] "Yehoshua". Such acrostics are a well recognised phenomenon in the Tanakh. Many religious Jews and counter missionaries discredit the note as a Messianic forgery. Rabbi Tovia Singer suggests that when considering the context of the note, the name Yehoshua refers to the biblical Yehoshua Ben Nun rather than Jesus to whom many messianic groups ascribe the name [...] "Yeshua". Singer also claimed that no member of Kaduri's family he spoke to 'knew <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> note'.|$|E
6000|$|Having again paused as before, Eugene said: 'I don't know that, either. But tell me. Did {{you ever}} see me take so much trouble <b>about</b> <b>anything,</b> as <b>about</b> <b>this</b> {{disappearance}} of hers? I ask, for information.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Buchanan doesn't see <b>anything</b> anti-Semitic <b>about</b> <b>this</b> statement, and responded: If it is {{the lack}} of Jewish names among those soldiers, why is my list not also anti-Italian, anti-Greek, and anti-Polish? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wonder if}} there is <b>anything</b> strange <b>about</b> <b>this</b> place," [...] remarked Dorcas. [...] "It is so very odd that no native will stop here at night except that half-wild Ivana." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1742, Charlotte {{got a new}} acting {{company in}} the New Theatre in St. James's, and she {{produced}} her second play, Tit for Tat, or, Comedy and Tragedy at War. In the flush of early success, she borrowed money from her uncle and opened the Charlotte Charke Tavern in Drury Lane. [...] This failed due to thieving by her customers and her own generosity; she sold it at a loss. [...] In the summer season, she appeared {{in a series of}} male roles. [...] At this point, she was [...] "Charles Brown" [...] in public in London on an everyday basis. [...] She joined with Theophilus Cibber at the Haymarket in 1744 and then joined William Hallam's company. [...] She married John Sacheverell in 1746, but scholars cannot determine <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> man, and Charke refers to him only in passing in her autobiography, and not even by name. [...] Whatever the nature of the marriage, it was cut short by Sacheverell's death. It did give Charke a new surname under which to appear for a time.|$|E

5000|$|... "I can't {{believe it}} myself, I don't {{remember}} <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> it. <b>This</b> tops Wimbledon (she won the girls' tournament in 2011), this trumps everything. I'm just so {{happy with the}} way I played." [...] —Barty speaking on her win over Francesca Schiavone.|$|R
50|$|People {{have trouble}} {{accepting}} themselves {{because of a}} lack of motivation. Some have the misconception that if someone is happy with themselves, they would not change <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> themselves. <b>This</b> is not true; individuals don't have to be unhappy with themselves to know and actively change things they don't like.|$|R
6000|$|... "He w6n't do that. Can't you see, Ned, that he don '.t know <b>{{anything}}</b> more <b>about</b> <b>this</b> {{room than}} he does of any other? We're all right for awhile anyhow; but I guess we'll be pretty hungry, 'cause we can't get anything to eat." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Do {{you know}} <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> Chilian business?” Lord Cochrane asked Stephen {{as they walked}} up and down the deck {{together}} on the following morning.|$|E
6000|$|... "Jake," [...] she said, [...] "you mustn't {{think my}} father knows <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>this.</b> I sent the packet, without telling him, because Daly asked me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you know}} <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> paragraph?" [...] she asked, {{touching}} {{it with her}} delicately-gloved forefinger. [...] "The one, I mean, which concerns the Count di Marioni?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Everything {{is not yet}} arranged, of course," [...] said Miss Panney, {{speaking}} rapidly, for {{she heard}} approaching footsteps, [...] "and you are not to say <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> all <b>this</b> or mention me in connection with it. I only spoke to you {{for the sake of}} the Dranes. It is your duty to get them away from here." ...|$|R
5000|$|TVSquad {{gave it a}} very {{positive}} review and said that [...] "Two episodes in and I really can't say <b>anything</b> bad <b>about</b> <b>this</b> show. It's wonderful. You shouldn't feel satisfied after watching a show <b>about</b> <b>this</b> subject matter, but you do and that's because it's done well." [...] and also praised the opening sequence for being [...] "slick".|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, I’ll do what I can {{for you if}} {{the worst}} comes to the worst," [...] said the skipper. [...] "You’d better not say <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> to anybody else." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> man. Anyhow, I {{only know}} two things about him. One is, {{he has never}} been in jail, and the other is, I don't know why." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't say <b>anything</b> to him <b>about</b> <b>this</b> second message, Mrs. Grantly, please, and Mr. Barton. Nor to Aunt Mildred. It {{would only}} cause them {{irritation}} and needless anxiety." ...|$|R
5000|$|Dhalyn Warren from Fanbolt {{gave the}} episode an A+ rating {{saying that the}} episode was [...] "fantastic" [...] and [...] "perfect". [...] "After the disappointing episode that premiered two weeks ago, “Bringing Out the Dead” {{definitely}} showed us why TVD {{is one of the}} best shows on television. ...

40|$|Suppose we {{grant that}} {{evolutionary}} forces {{have had a}} profound effect on the contours of our normative judgments and intuitions.

I will argue that, for the most part, we cannot...|$|R
