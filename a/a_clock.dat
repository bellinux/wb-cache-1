5|$|Innovations to the {{mechanical}} clock continued, with miniaturization leading to domestic clocks in the 15th century, and personal watches in the 16th. In the 1580s, the Italian polymath Galileo Galilei investigated the regular swing of the pendulum, {{and discovered that}} it could be used to regulate <b>a</b> <b>clock.</b> Although Galileo studied the pendulum as early as 1582, he never actually constructed <b>a</b> <b>clock</b> based on that design. The first pendulum clock was designed and built by Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens, in 1656. Early versions erred by less than one minute per day, and later ones only by 10seconds, very accurate for their time.|$|E
5|$|The {{appearance}} of clocks in {{writings of the}} 11th century implies that they were well known in Europe in that period. In the early 14th-century, the Florentine poet Dante Alighieri referred to <b>a</b> <b>clock</b> in his Paradiso; the first known literary reference to <b>a</b> <b>clock</b> that struck the hours. Giovanni da Dondi, Professor of Astronomy at Padua, presented the earliest detailed description of clockwork in his 1364 treatise Il Tractatus Astrarii. This has inspired several modern replicas, including some in London's Science Museum and the Smithsonian Institution. Other notable examples from this period were built in Milan (1335), Strasbourg (1354), Lund (1380), Rouen (1389), and Prague (1462).|$|E

5|$|The main {{railway station}} {{building}} includes <b>a</b> <b>clock</b> tower, imitation Tudor chimneys and carved {{heads in the}} frames of every window. There is a small British Transport Police station within the building.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>clock</b> is {{documented}} in this tower since 1405, {{when a new}} bell was installed. The city accounts of 1438 mention the repair of the clockworks. The first mention of a dial is in 1443, and the first known image of the, much smaller first astrolabium dial (in the diary a cobbler journeyman from Ulm) is dated 1534. The jacquemart (bellstriker) is also documented in the same 1534 source.|$|E
5|$|A {{detached}} four-storey {{bell tower}} was built near the riverbanks {{by the first}} Augustinian Recollect priest of Loboc. It has seven bells, with the 1863 bell being the oldest and the 1937 bell, named for Father Cayetano Bastes, being the largest. It also has a large wooden ratchet, installed in 1899, used during Holy Week, and <b>a</b> <b>clock</b> made by the Altonaga Company, installed in 1893.|$|E

5|$|Alexander Bain, a Scottish {{clock and}} {{instrument}} maker, {{was the first}} to invent and patent the electric clock in 1840. On January 11, 1841, Alexander Bain along with John Barwise, a chronometer maker, took out another important patent describing <b>a</b> <b>clock</b> in which an electromagnetic pendulum and an electric current is employed to keep the clock going instead of springs or weights. Later patents expanded on his original ideas.|$|E
5|$|Bughouse can {{be played}} without <b>a</b> <b>clock,</b> but then there is usually a rule {{preventing}} a player waiting for pieces (stalling or sitting) indefinitely.

5|$|In 1751, Francis Blomefield, in his Collectanea Cantabrigiensia, {{recorded}} StJames' {{as having}} a square tower, with four bells and <b>a</b> <b>clock.</b> The north aisle was leaded {{and there was a}} chantry chapel at the east end with a screen. He concludes this to be the Chancel of the Resurrection. At this time, the south aisle, nave and chancel were also recorded as leaded.|$|E
5|$|In 1987 <b>a</b> <b>clock</b> {{tower and}} a {{fountain}} were erected at Council Negri Monument. A centenary stone that was erected in 1967 {{to commemorate the}} event is kept under the clock tower.

5|$|Rubidium and caesium {{are often}} used in atomic clocks. Caesium atomic clocks are {{extraordinarily}} accurate; if <b>a</b> <b>clock</b> had been made {{at the time of}} the dinosaurs, it would be off by less than four seconds (after 80 million years). For that reason, caesium atoms are used as the definition of the second. Rubidium ions {{are often used}} in purple fireworks, and caesium is often used in drilling fluids in the petroleum industry.|$|E
5|$|Some {{animals can}} {{navigate}} using celestial cues {{such as the}} position of the sun. Since the sun moves in the sky, navigation by this means also requires an internal clock. Many animals depend on such <b>a</b> <b>clock</b> to maintain their circadian rhythm. Animals that use sun compass orientation are fish, birds, sea-turtles, butterflies, bees, sandhoppers, reptiles, and ants.|$|E
5|$|The Bilbie {{family were}} also {{involved}} in clock making. In 1749 Thomas Biblie (senior) was asked to make a set of chimes for Cullompton church. Thomas II worked on clock mechanisms to play tunes on church bells at East Coker and also at Beaminster. Thomas Castleman is recorded as having made <b>a</b> <b>clock</b> for Cullompton Church in 1811 {{at a cost of}} £55.|$|E

5|$|While Sayid is gone, Daniel asks Regina (Zoë Bell), a {{colleague}} on the freighter {{to shoot a}} projectile onto the island.

5|$|A major {{stimulus}} {{to improving the}} accuracy and reliability of clocks was the importance of precise time-keeping for navigation. The position of a ship at sea could be determined with reasonable accuracy if a navigator could refer to <b>a</b> <b>clock</b> that lost or gained less than about 10 seconds per day. The marine chronometer would {{have to keep the}} time of a fixed location—usually Greenwich Mean Time—allowing seafarers to determine longitude by comparing the local high noon to the clock. This clock could not contain a pendulum, which would be virtually useless on a rocking ship.|$|E
5|$|Alcatraz cellhouse had a {{corridor}} naming system named after major American streets and landmarks. Michigan Avenue was {{the corridor to}} the side of A-Block, and Broadway was the central corridor in which the inmates would assemble as they massed through Times Square (an area with <b>a</b> <b>clock</b> on the wall), before entering the dining hall for their meals. Broadway separated Block-B and Block-C and prisoners kept along it had the least privacy in the prison. The corridor between Block-C and the library was called Park Avenue. The corridor in D-Block was named Sunset Strip. Gun galleries lay {{at the end of each}} block, including the West and East Gun Galleries.|$|E
