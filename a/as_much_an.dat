5|$|Mercyful Fate {{were a part}} of {{the first}} wave of black metal, along with other groups, such as Venom, Bathory and Hellhammer. Many of these groups helped {{establish}} the style upon which future black metal artists would later build. Unlike the other first wave bands, typical elements of Mercyful Fate's style are influences from progressive rock, epic 1970s hard rock and traditional heavy metal. As many of the band's songs featured lyrics about Satanism and the occult and King Diamond was among the first black metal musicians to use the now famous corpse paint, Mercyful Fate was a pioneer in developing black metal, although their musical style was not <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>an</b> influence as that of other first wave bands.|$|E
5|$|Pinker's 1994 The Language Instinct was {{the first}} of several books to combine {{cognitive}} science with behavioral genetics and evolutionary psychology. It introduces the science of language and popularizes Noam Chomsky's theory that language is an innate faculty of mind, with the controversial twist that the faculty for language evolved by natural selection as an adaptation for communication. Pinker criticizes several widely held ideas about language – that it needs to be taught, that people's grammar is poor and getting worse with new ways of speaking, the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis that language limits the kinds of thoughts a person can have, and that other great apes can learn languages. Pinker sees language as unique to humans, evolved to solve the specific problem of communication among social hunter-gatherers. He argues that it is <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>an</b> instinct as specialized adaptative behavior in other species, such as a spider's web-weaving or a beaver's dam-building.|$|E

25|$|The {{conceptualisation}} of {{the past}} as the standard of the Middle Ages is perhaps best encapsulated by the German term Völkerwanderung. In this model, the Scots are portrayed as making their way from Egypt via Ireland to Scotland, annihilating their enemies on the way. The legitimacy therefore derives from conquest, and purity of racial/royal descent. The tradition in Scotland {{was influenced by the}} Historia Regum Britanniae, the Lebor Gabála Érenn and the Historia Brittonum. Ultimately, such conceptualizations can be derived from Virgil's Aeneid and the Bible, but were just <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>an</b> organic and original product of the medieval Scots themselves.|$|E

He faced a Kharijite uprising and preferred negotiations to armed conflict, personally holding talks with two Kharijite envoys shortly before his death. He recalled the troops besieging Constantinople led by his cousin Maslama. The Second Arab siege of Constantinople had failed to take the city and was sustaining heavy losses {{at the hands of}} allied Byzantine and Bulgarian forces. Its defeat was a serious blow to Umayyad prestige.|$|E

25|$|The frontoviks had to live, {{fight and}} die in small {{circular}} foxholes dug into the earth with enough room {{for one or two}} men with slit trenches being to connect what the Germans called “Russian holes”. The soldiers were usually not issued blankets or sleeping bags, even in the winter. Instead, the frontovik slept in their coats and shelter-capes usually on pine, evergreen needles, fir boughs, piled leaves or straw. In the winter, the temperature could drop as low as -60°F (-50°C), making General Moroz (General Frost) <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>an</b> enemy as the Germans.

500|$|Characters of Shakespear's Plays argues {{against a}} century and a half of {{criticism}} that saw Shakespeare as a [...] "child of nature", deficient in art and full of faults. To anchor his position, Hazlitt makes an observation by the poet Alexander Pope—despite Pope's being one of those very critics—his unifying theme: [...] "every single character in Shakespear, is <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>an</b> individual, as those in life itself", and he explores the Shakespearean art that, as much as observation of nature, brought those characters to life.|$|E

This is confirmed by a German chronicle which explains that Mehmet wanted to turn Moldavia into [...] "some kind of fortress," [...] and from there, to launch attacks against Poland and Hungary. The Ottomans also feared the strategic position of Moldavia, whence it would only take 15 to 20 days to reach Constantinople.|$|E

500|$|A {{number of}} factors {{influenced}} the opera's very favourable reception. The initial cast contained leading singers of the period and, as it changed, equally brilliant stars (e.g. Falcon) were introduced as replacements. The sensational plot and the notoriety of the Nuns' ballet ensured that the opera was a hot topic in journals and reviews. This was assisted by the marketing skills of the director Véron and the publisher Schlesinger. The scenery was of exceptional quality: [...] "This was <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>an</b> opera to see as to hear, {{and it has been}} argued that the real hero behind Robert le diable was Cicéri, the designer." [...] Meyerbeer was keen to keep influential persons on his side. For example, he sent free tickets for 'a good box' to Heinrich Heine. And of course the businessman Véron knew how to use (and pay) the claque and its leader Augustin Levasseur.|$|E
500|$|As {{a symbol}} of Croatia's {{national}} identity, Vukovar has become a place of pilgrimage for people from across Croatia who seek to evoke feelings of [...] "vicarious insideness", as Kardov describes them, in the suffering endured during the country's war of independence. Some gather {{in front of the}} town's main memorial cross on New Year's Eve to pray as the year ends, though such sentiments have attracted criticism from local Croats for not allowing them to [...] "rejoice for even a single night", as one put it. The town has thus become, in Kardov's words, [...] "the embodiment of a pure Croatian identity" [...] and the battle [...] "the foundational myth of the Croatian state". This has led to it becoming <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>an</b> [...] "imagined place", a receptacle for Croatian national sentiment and symbolism, as a real place. Kardov concludes that it is questionable whether Vukovar can ever once again be [...] "one place for all its citizens".|$|E

After reviewing various other critics of Shakespeare, Hazlitt focuses {{on two of the}} most important, including the influential Dr. Johnson. Hazlitt found the Shakespearean criticism of Johnson, the premier literary critic of the previous era, troubling in several ways. He insufficiently valued the tragedies; he missed the essence of much of the poetry; and he [...] "reduced everything to the common standard of conventional propriety [...] the most exquisite refinement or sublimity produced an effect on his mind, only as they could be translated into the language of measured prose". Johnson also believed that every character in Shakespeare represents a [...] "type" [...] or [...] "species", whereas Hazlitt, siding with Pope, emphasised the individuality of Shakespeare's characters, while discussing them more comprehensively than anyone had yet done.|$|E

500|$|Under Edward's rule, parliament's {{importance}} grew as a {{means of}} making political decisions and answering petitions, although as the historian Claire Valente notes, the gatherings were [...] "still <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>an</b> event as an institution". After 1311, parliament began to include, in addition to the barons, the representatives of the knights and burgesses, who in later years would constitute the [...] "commons". Although parliament often opposed raising fresh taxes, active opposition to Edward came largely from the barons, rather than parliament itself, although the barons did seek to use the parliamentary meetings as a way of giving legitimacy to their long-standing political demands. After resisting it for many years, Edward began intervening in parliament {{in the second half of}} his reign to achieve his own political aims. It remains unclear whether Edward was deposed in 1327 by a formal gathering of parliament or simply a gathering of the political classes alongside an existing parliament.|$|E
500|$|Along with New York Dolls, Too Much Too Soon {{became one}} of the most popular cult albums in rock music. According to AllMusic senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine, the group predated punk rock with their [...] "gleeful sleaziness and {{reckless}} sound" [...] on the record, which he said was embellished by Morton's production details and exemplified by [...] "musically visceral and dangerous" [...] songs such as [...] "Human Being". In 1986, Sounds magazine ranked it sixtieth on its list of the 100 best albums of all time. After it was reissued by Mercury in 1987, Don McLeese of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote that Morton's production highlighted the New York Dolls' sense of humor and was rendered vividly by the CD remaster. However, he felt Too Much Too Soon was marred by inconsistent material and rated it lower than their first record. In a review of the reissue, Don Waller of the Los Angeles Times said the album was underappreciated and <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>an</b> [...] "instant classic" [...] as New York Dolls.|$|E
500|$|Film scholar Richard Dyer {{highlights}} several intelligent devices used by Argento in {{the editing}} of the film, noting that interpolated sequences are sometimes punctuated by [...] "shots of pills {{and the sound}} of running water." [...] Steffen Hantke believes that the shock cuts {{in the latter part of}} the film are among cinema's [...] "most brutal and stylized", and exhibit a degree of abstract expressionism. Film scholar Leon Hunt argues that the devices and themes utilized by Argento in the making of Tenebrae make it <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>an</b> example of art cinema as anything else. The initial murders are shot in a [...] "clipped montage style", which is later revealed to be reflecting the use of a camera by the first killer to record the scene. Giuliano Gemma later said that Argento fostered an improvisational atmosphere on set. One example he gave was the scene where his character bends to pick up some evidence from the floor, only to reveal Neal behind him having perfectly matched his position relative to the camera. This moment was not scripted, but resulted from Argento's noticing the actors' similar build while they were stood, one behind the other in front of him.|$|E
