In God of War, Aphrodite helped Kratos by {{empowering}} {{the head of}} the slain Medusa <b>and</b> <b>giving</b> <b>it</b> to Kratos as a magical weapon. In God of War III, she offered advice regarding the architect Daedalus. After seducing Kratos, Aphrodite directed him to her estranged husband. She is the only god that Kratos did not kill that was present in God of War III. The character was voiced by Carole Ruggier in God of War, and April Stewart in God of War III.|$|E

The first home version was {{released}} in Japan in 1994 as a launch title for the PlayStation; the versions for North America and Europe were released in 1995. It was re-released in Japan for the PlayStation The Best range in 1997, and for the Greatest Hits and Platinum ranges in North America and PAL regions respectively the same year. Ridge Racer {{played a major role in}} establishing the new system <b>and</b> <b>giving</b> <b>it</b> an early edge over its nearest competitor, the Sega Saturn, and was considered a rival to Sega's Daytona USA.|$|E
5|$|Franklin asked Timothy Folger, {{his cousin}} twice removed (Nantucket Historical Society), a Nantucket Island whaling captain, for an answer. Folger {{explained}} that merchant ships routinely crossed the then-unnamed Gulf Stream—identifying it by whale behavior, {{measurement of the}} water's temperature and the speed of bubbles on its surface, {{and changes in the}} water's color—while the mail packet captains ran against it. Franklin worked with Folger and other experienced ship captains, learning enough to chart the Gulf Stream <b>and</b> <b>giving</b> <b>it</b> the name by which it is still known today. He offered this information to Anthony Todd, secretary of the British Post Office, but it was ignored by British sea captains.|$|E

Robyn gave the song a perfect score of 10 and said that Måns was a charismatic performer. Deban gave the song a rate of 7.5 and said that Måns was [...] "fabulously telegenic" [...] and said [...] "Heroes" [...] is a weak entry without the visuals. Bogdan gave the lowest score for the song-3 out of 10- {{and said that the}} song was the child of David Guetta's [...] "Lovers on the Sun" [...] and Avicii's [...] "The Nights". Denise described the song as a mix between Avicii <b>and</b> Coldplay <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> 10 out of 10. Billy said that the song would certainly win Europeans' hearts <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> 10 out of 10.

Sami said the song reminded of David Guetta <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> 9 out of 10. William said the lyrics of the song made no sense <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> 7 out of 10. Writing in The Independent, Kiran Moodley also compared it with the Guetta song, concluding [...] "indeed the resemblance is uncanny." ...|$|R
5|$|The {{opposition}} to the ritual is not explicit in the oldest Upanishads. On occasions, the Upanishads extend {{the task of the}} Aranyakas by making the ritual allegorical <b>and</b> <b>giving</b> <b>it</b> a philosophical meaning. For example, the Brihadaranyaka interprets the practice of horse-sacrifice or ashvamedha allegorically. It states that the over-lordship of the earth may be acquired by sacrificing a horse. It then {{goes on to say that}} spiritual autonomy can only be achieved by renouncing the universe which is conceived in the image of a horse.|$|E

Huser is later revealed to be a media personality, and he appears on a network's morning television show warning tourists against visiting Springfield <b>and</b> <b>giving</b> <b>it</b> his lowest rating for any American location (six out of ten). The Springfield tourism business collapses and Mayor Quimby holds an emergency meeting at the town hall. After many senseless suggestions, Lisa suggests that Springfield legalize same-sex marriage to entice visitors to their town. All of Springfield happily agrees with Lisa's idea, even Marge. The town makes a commercial that is broadcast throughout America, convincing {{people to come to}} Springfield.|$|E
5|$|Evans {{found himself}} in battles to protect his {{intellectual}} property many times throughout his career, but he pursued the cause most doggedly during his latter years. His first and most successful patents concerning flour-milling proved the most problematic to defend, and Evans' battles proved influential in setting precedent for the newly established area of federal patent law. His original patent for his automated flour-mill expired in January 1805, but Evans believed that the fourteen year patent term was too brief and petitioned the Congress to extend it. In January 1808 An Act for the Relief of Oliver Evans was passed and signed by President Jefferson, a long-time admirer of Evans's work. The act took the extraordinary step of reviving to Evans his expired patent <b>and</b> <b>giving</b> <b>it</b> another fourteen year term— Evans was delighted, but the move was to highly problematic, particularly regarding those who had implemented Evans's designs in the intervening three year period between the patent terms, as many millers had waited for Evans's patent to expire before upgrading their mills.|$|E

5|$|In the American camp, {{the mutual}} resentment between Horatio Gates and Benedict Arnold finally {{exploded}} into open hostility. Gates quickly reported {{the action of}} September 19 to the Congress and Governor George Clinton of New York, but he failed to mention Arnold at all. The field commanders and men universally credited Arnold for their success. Almost all the troops involved were from Arnold's command and Arnold was the one directing the battle while Gates sat in his tent. Arnold protested, and the dispute escalated into a shouting match that ended with Gates relieving Arnold of his command <b>and</b> <b>giving</b> <b>it</b> to Benjamin Lincoln. Arnold asked for a transfer to Washington's command, which Gates granted, but instead of leaving he remained in his tent. There is no documentary evidence for a commonly recounted anecdote that a petition signed by line officers convinced Arnold to stay in camp.|$|E
5|$|Italian ornithologist Tommaso Salvadori {{defined the}} new genus Neophema in 1891, placing the {{turquoise}} parrot within it <b>and</b> <b>giving</b> <b>it</b> its current scientific name. There is little geographical variation, with some minor local {{differences in the}} amount of orange on the belly. In 1915, Gregory Mathews described a subspecies dombrainii from Victoria on the basis of more prominent red on the scapulars; however, this distinction was not confirmed on review with New South Wales specimens, and hence no subspecies are recognised. One of six species of grass parrot in the genus Neophema, it is most closely related to the scarlet-chested parrot. The two are an allopatric species pair, and are the only two species in the genus to exhibit marked sexual dimorphism—where the male and female are different in appearance.|$|E
5|$|The {{only major}} hype related to {{commercials}} {{in the months}} leading up to Super Bowl XLI involved various campaigns to allow consumers to be involved in the creation of Super Bowl ads, inspired by consumer-generated content sites like YouTube. Frito-Lay announced a campaign in September 2006 to allow the public to submit ads for their Doritos brand and vote on the best one, which aired during the Super Bowl. Doritos actually aired two of the ads due to a close voting margin; the winning ad (featuring a chance meeting with a man and a woman that feature the qualities of Doritos) aired in the first quarter, while a second (with a checkout lady overly enamored with the product) aired in the second quarter. The five finalists each received $10,000 in this contest. General Motors announced a similar contest, open only to college students, for their Chevrolet brand; however, the ad would be produced professionally based on ideas suggested by the public. The winning ad featured men gathering around an HHR model with women in it and stripping off their clothes <b>and</b> <b>giving</b> <b>it</b> a car wash. The NFL itself advertised a similar contest to generate suggestions for a commercial promoting the league, with the winning concept featuring fans' disappointment that their teams' season was over.|$|E

The unicorn was chosen because it was seen as a proud and haughty beast which would rather die than be captured, just as Scots would fight to remain sovereign and unconquered. Two unicorns supported the royal arms of the King of Scots, and since the 1707 union of England and Scotland, the royal arms of the United Kingdom have been supported by a unicorn along with an English lion. Two versions of the royal arms exist: that used in Scotland gives more emphasis to the Scottish elements, placing the unicorn on the left <b>and</b> <b>giving</b> <b>it</b> a crown, whereas the version used in England and elsewhere gives the English elements more prominence.|$|E
