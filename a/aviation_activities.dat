5|$|General <b>aviation</b> <b>activities</b> at {{the airport}} {{gradually}} increased. In the early 1960s, sailplanes became popular {{at the airport}}. The aerodrome is located with good wind and air pressure conditions for sailplane flying, and Oslo Flyklubb stationed two of its sailplanes at Tuven. Ronald Stensrud established a pilot school in 1966, but was forced to close after failing to make ends meet.|$|E
5|$|In some countries, {{the need}} for more land for housing is {{threatening}} small airfields. These airfields may also be used for other general <b>aviation</b> <b>activities,</b> and the addition of gliding may be difficult to accommodate. This can limit the number of available airfields and so it can require longer drives to reach them.|$|E
25|$|At this date, {{there were}} 12 RAAF squadrons, of which two existed in nucleus only and four were citizen force. The {{aircraft}} inventory consisted entirely of obsolescent machines. In Brisbane, <b>aviation</b> <b>activities</b> centred on Archerfield and Amberley (under construction).|$|E

25|$|General <b>aviation</b> <b>activities</b> at {{the airport}} include a base and pilot school {{operated}} by Pegasus Helicopter. There are several aviation clubs {{at the airport}}, including Grenland Flyklubb, which operates three aircraft, the parachute club Grenland Fallskjermklubb, a model aircraft club, ten privately owned small aircraft and the base for Russian Warbirds of Norway, which operates heritage Russian military aircraft.|$|E
25|$|The airline was {{established}} in Bergen in 1946. The first aircraft were operational in 1948, consisting of three three-passenger Republic RC-3 Seabees and a one-passenger Luscombe 8A Silvaire. The airline was initially engaged in various general <b>aviation</b> <b>activities.</b> An important task was air ambulance services. However, the airline never signed a fixed contract with the health authorities and had to get every trip refunded on a case for case basis form the National Insurance Administration.|$|E
25|$|In parachuting, a {{drop zone}} or DZ {{is the area}} above and around a {{location}} where a parachutist freefalls and expects to land. It is usually situated beside a small airport, often sharing the facility with other general <b>aviation</b> <b>activities.</b> There is generally a landing area designated for parachute landings. Drop zone staff includes the DZO (drop zone operator or owner), manifestors, pilots, instructors, coaches, cameramen, packers, riggers and other general staff.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to Coast Guard flight operations, during World War II, Albert Whitted Airport was converted to military {{use as a}} primary flight training base for student Naval Aviators for the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps. Hundreds of Naval Aviation cadets under the U.S. Navy's V-5 pre-commissioning program received initial flight training in Stearman N2S and Waco biplanes. At {{the end of the}} war, Navy training ceased, civilian commercial and general <b>aviation</b> <b>activity</b> returned, and the Coast Guard remained the sole military <b>aviation</b> <b>activity</b> at the airport until its relocation in 1976.|$|R
25|$|McGregor {{joined the}} Royal New Zealand Air Force in 1921. In 1923, he was {{appointed}} Squadron Leader. He also took part in civil <b>aviation</b> <b>activities.</b> He ran a barnstorming operation, Hamilton Airways. He flew a passenger route between Dunedin and Christchurch in a De Havilland DH.50 borrowed from the New Zealand government. He flew some pioneering airmail routes throughout New Zealand. In late April 1929, he participated in the New Zealand Air Pageant, entering a de Havilland Gypsy Moth from Hamilton Airways.|$|E
25|$|Early in the war, French {{aircraft}} {{had been}} brought into to defend Venice from air attack. In {{the wake of the}} Battle of Caporetto, four squadrons of the British Royal Flying Corps were dispatched to Italy to supplement the Italian aviation effort. Unbeknownst to either Italians or British, the Austro-Hungarians were beginning to suffer shortages of vital war materials on the home front; as a result, their <b>aviation</b> <b>activities</b> were seriously curtailed for the Winter of 1917. However, the RFC squadrons would claim 550 victories for their year in Italy.|$|E
25|$|In February 1928, {{construction}} work began on Lethbridge Collegiate Institute {{at the corner}} of 4 Avenue and 15 Street South. The institution would become the city's first combined junior high and high school. The site had previously been used for <b>aviation</b> <b>activities</b> in the city, until the opening of Kenyon Field (now Lethbridge County Airport) south of Six-Mile Coulee in the summer of 1939. Construction of the school at the site finished in October 1928, but a fire in the spring of 1929 ravaged the new building. Classes had to be moved to other local schools until later that year.|$|E

50|$|NATOPS manuals contain {{standard}} flight {{doctrine and}} the optimum operating {{procedures for the}} aircraft model or <b>aviation</b> <b>activity</b> (e.g., CV NATOPS, LSO NATOPS, etc.) concerned. They do not include tactical doctrine.|$|R
50|$|After {{the airline}} {{deregulation}} of the late 1970s, the nature of commercial service would change for Hickory. Now smaller, commuter airline service would be offered to feed large hubs of <b>aviation</b> <b>activity.</b>|$|R
25|$|The airport {{opened in}} 1937 {{and was taken}} over by the Luftwaffe in 1940. It was at first used as a dummy airfield, but from 1944 the Luftwaffe carried out upgrades. These were not {{finished}} by the end of Second World War. Jarlsberg was from 1947 to 1959 used by the Royal Norwegian Air Force (RNoAF), although the functions were eventually taken over by the nearby Sandefjord Airport, Torp. Braathens SAFE operated scheduled services from 1952 to 1959, and later also Thor Solberg and Fred. Olsen Airtransport also operated scheduled services. Activity has been limited to various general <b>aviation</b> <b>activities</b> since the late 1960s.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, the {{government}} of Puerto Rico has announced that the airport at the base will be reopened, and will become a major Caribbean air cargo hub, relieving Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport and extending its useful life indefinitely {{without the need for}} property expansion. It will also be used to centralize general <b>aviation</b> <b>activities</b> now dispersed over several municipal airports, saving the Puerto Rico Ports Authority significant sums of money on maintenance and other costs. Other plans are in motion to make use of other sections of the former base to benefit the local economy. A large portion of the undeveloped land in the property is being set aside for ecological preservation.|$|E
25|$|The airline {{was founded}} in 1934, and was engaged in various general <b>aviation</b> <b>activities.</b> In 1936, Widerøe started {{scheduled}} seaplane flights and, from 1940, also ambulance flights. During the 1940s and 1950s, the airline increased its seaplane routes and established a fleet based on de Havilland Canada DHC-3 Otter and Noorduyn Norseman aircraft. From 1968, Widerøe started flying to STOLports built in northern and western Norway using DHC-6 Twin Otters, and later also with Dash 7 aircraft. In 1989, Widerøe bought Norsk Air and started services from Sandefjord. During the 1990s, it replaced all its aircraft with Dash 8 aircraft; in the 2000s it was bought by the SAS Group and took over SAS Commuter's operations in northern Norway. In 2010, Widerøe took over regional SAS services in western Norway.|$|E
50|$|The Marines used a few {{of their}} planes to form an aerial formation-flight {{demonstration}} team, dubbed The Flying Leathernecks (which was also the title of a 1951 film starring John Wayne, concerned with Marine <b>aviation</b> <b>activity</b> in World War II).|$|R

50|$|As of October 2016, India {{is not a}} {{signatory}} to the UN supported 'Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation' (CORSIA). 66 countries contributing {{more than}} 85% of international <b>aviation</b> <b>activity</b> has decided to voluntarily participate in this mechanism from the introductory phase itself.|$|R
500|$|Whilst carbon {{emissions}} from all UK activities other than aviation had declined by 9 per cent in the 10years between 1990 and 2000, {{carbon emissions}} from <b>aviation</b> <b>activities</b> {{doubled in the}} same period. Air transport in the UK accounted for 6.3 per cent of all UK carbon emissions in 2006. When the radiative forcing impact of other emissions {{are taken into account}} the total impact of emissions attributable to aviation is estimated to be twice that of its carbon emissions alone. Although the government has committed to reducing total UK carbon emissions by 60 per cent from existing levels by 2050, its policy is based on the use of [...] "… economic instruments to ensure that growing industries are catered for within a reducing total." [...] Even if this reduction in total carbon emissions is achieved, research published in February 2006 concluded that aviation could account for between 24 per cent and 50 per cent of the UK's carbon budget by 2050.|$|E
2500|$|The airport's {{most recent}} Master Plan was {{released}} in December 2006. [...] The Plan identifies four major goals for the airport: [...] Retain and expand scheduled passenger flights, increase charter operations, increase corporate and general <b>aviation</b> <b>activities,</b> and increase cargo activities. In order to achieve these goals, the airport {{over the long term}} endeavors to, among other things: ...|$|E
2500|$|Fjellfly (literally [...] "Mountain Fly") was a Norwegian airline which {{operated}} between 1954 and 1972. The airline {{was based}} at Skien Airport, Geiteryggen and {{diverse range of}} general <b>aviation</b> <b>activities</b> and a limited scheduled services. Major undertakings included deliveries of the newspaper Dagbladet, flying tourists into mountainous areas such as Hardangervidda and crop dusted forest areas. A scheduled service was introduced from Skien to Oslo Airport, Fornebu in 1963, and extended to Sandefjord Airport, Torp and Hamar Airport, Stafsberg four years later. At its peak in 1965, the airline had a fleet of fourteen aircraft.|$|E

2500|$|In April 2004, Japan and US {{extended}} {{discussions on}} potential cooperative {{efforts on the}} P-X and US Navy's Multi-mission Maritime Aircraft (MMA) programmes; options ranged from terminating the P-X program {{to participate in the}} US-led MMA program to incorporating some of the MMA's technology onto the P-X to reduce costs. The Japanese Defence Ministry ultimately opted to persist with the P-X program, stating that: [...] "there was a possibility that foreign aircraft would not satisfy the required capability and there was a possibility that foreign aircraft would not meet the required period of introduction...it is necessary to domestically develop the aircraft". In addition to the P-1, studies were also conducted into the use of ship-based UAVs to support maritime <b>aviation</b> <b>activities.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{shift from}} full, carrier-embarked squadrons to single- or two-helicopter flights {{operating}} from frigates forced overhauls {{of the management}} and organisational style of the FAA, with squadrons made to act with increasing independence and less experienced junior officers taking greater responsibility for the <b>aviation</b> <b>activities</b> of their assigned ship. During the 1980s, the Eurocopter Ecureuil (Squirrel) and Sikorsky S-70 Seahawk were acquired to operate from the Adelaide-class frigates. During the early 1990s, these helicopters operated aboard Australian ships deployed to support the international coalition during the Gulf War; they were used for anti-air surveillance and surface search, to deliver boarding parties to interdicted ships, and provide search-and-rescue capabilities. During 1992, FAA Sea Kings were embarked aboard [...] for Operation Solace, part of the famine-relief operation in Somalia.|$|E
2500|$|The Bug first flew in February 1999. The {{aircraft}} {{was designed to}} be an inexpensive and easy to fly three axis controlled aircraft similar to a primary glider, although the designer terms it an airchair. The Bug has an empty weight of under [...] and so qualifies to be operated under the United States FAR 103 Ultralight Vehicles regulations. The aircraft is made available as technical drawings, not plans, to allow potential builders to study them. Sandlin makes his computer assisted design drawings available free of charge as downloads in [...]dxf, [...]dwf and [...]gif formats and has explicitly released them to the public domain. The Bug 4 drawings comprise 66 sheets. The designer considers his <b>aviation</b> <b>activities</b> a hobby only.|$|E
50|$|Today, 35% of the airport's {{activity}} is {{accounted for by}} Oxford Aviation Academy training student commercial pilots under a Civil Aviation Authority/European Aviation Safety Agency (CAA/EASA) licence. 10% is business aviation, both private and charter, and the remaining 55% is mainly private and recreational general <b>aviation</b> <b>activity.</b>|$|R
50|$|Geiger {{was ordered}} to cease all flying {{operations}} in late 1913 because the trade winds were too strong. The airplanes were sold locally, and the engines were {{sent back to the}} North Island Flying School. The Hawaiian Islands would not see any more Army <b>aviation</b> <b>activity</b> until 1917.|$|R
50|$|Local {{officials}} hope to attract future commercial airline service, despite challenges {{caused by the}} relatively close proximity of the large Charlotte-Douglas International Airport. Nonetheless, the airport has maintained a relatively high traffic volume due to its corporate, air charter, air cargo, and local and itinerant general <b>aviation</b> <b>activity.</b>|$|R
