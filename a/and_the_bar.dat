5|$|During the 8th century BCE, {{the village}} {{was part of the}} Kingdom of Judah. During the days of Jewish king Herod the town was the {{administrative}} center for the district of Idumea. After the turmoil of the First Jewish-Roman War <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bar</b> Kokhba revolt the town became a thriving Roman colony and a major administrative center under the name of Eleutheropolis. In the early 7th century CE, Bayt Jibrin was conquered by Muslim forces led by 'Amr ibn al-'As. Under the Crusaders in the 12th century, it was known as Beth Gibelin, and had a population of 1,500, compared to 100-150 in the average village of the time. It fell to the Mamluks and then the Ottoman Turks. In the 19th century, the al-'Azza family took control of Bayt Jibrin and unsuccessfully attempted to rebel against the Ottomans, ending in the exile and execution of local leaders.|$|E
5|$|Hichens {{was next}} {{appointed}} {{commander of the}} 8th MGB Flotilla. These new boats were armed with a twin Oerlikon mount aft, a QF 2-pounder Mark XIV forward, twin Lewis or later twin Vickers machine guns {{either side of the}} bridge and depth charges. The flotilla was moved to Dartmouth, Devon in July 1942. The first action they were involved in was during the night of 14/15 July. Ordered to engage E Boats using Cherbourg as a base they found a convoy of naval trawlers escorting a small tanker. The flotilla engaged the two rear escort trawlers and carried out a depth charge attack. The tanker was last seen to be on fire as the flotilla reformed off Alderney. After this action Hichens was awarded a Bar to his DSO. Both the DSO <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bar</b> were presented during the same investiture at Buckingham Palace on 22 September 1942, while other members of the flotilla were awarded a Conspicuous Gallantry Medal and four MIDs for the action.|$|E

5|$|After the {{resignation}} of Lord Oaksey in 1956 Denning was offered {{a job as a}} Law Lord. After a period of contemplation (he worried that such an appointment would reduce his chances of becoming Master of the Rolls or Lord Chief Justice) he accepted, and was formally offered the job on 5 April 1957. He was appointed on 24 April 1957, as Baron Denning, of Whitchurch in the County of Southampton; for the supporters of his coat of arms he chose Lord Mansfield and Sir Edward Coke. Many members of the judiciary <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bar</b> approved of his appointment, but he was warned that he should move slowly to reform the court. During his time in the House of Lords he also served as Chairman of the Quarter Sessions of East Sussex. During his time in the House of Lords Denning frequently expressed dissenting opinions. Denning did not enjoy his time in the House of Lords and clashed frequently with Viscount Simonds, who was known as a conservative and orthodox judge. Despite his reputation as a fiercely individual judge, Denning dissented in only 16% of cases he heard in the House of Lords; fewer than Lord Keith, who dissented 22% of the time. On 9 May 1960, Denning was appointed a Deputy Lieutenant of Sussex.|$|E
5|$|The 10th Battalion {{was back}} in action on 22–23 August as the Allied advance {{continued}} north of Proyart. The 10th Battalion was in a supporting role protecting the flank of the 1st Brigade. Upon learning of some difficulties due to German positions in Luc Wood, the commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Maurice Wilder-Neligan, immediately tasked McCann, commanding two companies, to clear the area. Along with flanking troops, McCann cleared the wood, capturing 15 prisoners and four machine guns. The advance was then able to continue. McCann temporarily commanded the battalion for a week in late August, before being promoted to temporary major on 23 September. The battalion saw its last action {{of the war in}} late September. McCann again temporarily commanded the battalion for a week in early October, and was substantively promoted to major on 21 October. Shortly after this he attended a strategy and tactics course at the Staff College, Camberley, before returning to the battalion in November, when he was appointed as unit second-in-command. In early January 1919 he was appointed as commanding officer. He commanded the 10th Battalion until its disbandment in March, and was mentioned in Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig's final despatch of 16 March 1919. Also in March, he led a party of American delegates {{on a tour of the}} war zone and, in the following month, he headed the 3rd Brigade contingent in the Anzac Day march through London. On 3 May he was invested with his Distinguished Service Order <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> to his Military Cross at Buckingham Palace. Later that month he embarked for Australia, and arrived back in Adelaide in June. He was admitted to Keswick Repatriation General Hospital on his return, and was discharged from the AIF on 8 September 1919. Two of McCann's brothers also served in the AIF, with one being killed in action. In addition to the decorations previously mentioned, McCann was also issued with the 1914–15 Star, British War Medal, and Victory Medal for his service during the war.|$|E
