5|$|After {{just over}} an hour, Gemmell {{finally managed to}} equalise for Celtic when Craig passed {{to him from the}} right wing and he scored with a {{powerful}} 25 yard shot. The balance of play remained the same with Inter defending deeply against sustained Celtic attacking. With <b>about</b> <b>five</b> <b>minutes</b> remaining, a long-range shot from Bobby Murdoch was diverted by Stevie Chalmers past a wrong-footed Sarti. This proved to be the winning goal.|$|E

The film opened at #11 at the DVD sales chart, making $1.6 {{million in the first}} week off 104,000 DVD units. There is a rated and an unrated version, with the unrated version running <b>about</b> <b>five</b> <b>minutes</b> longer than the theatrical version. The UK Blu-ray lacks most of the extras found on the locked US release.|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} ZIPRA guerrillas, {{armed with a}} Strela-2 launcher, waited in the bush beneath Flight 825's flightpath, and fired on the Hunyani <b>about</b> <b>five</b> <b>minutes</b> after it took off, while the {{aircraft}} {{was still in the}} climb phase of its flight. The heat-seeking missile hit the plane's starboard wing and exploded, causing the inner engine to also explode. A fuel tank and hydraulic lines ruptured, creating a fire that could not be put out. The second starboard engine failed almost immediately, leaving Hood with only his two port engines. Heaving wildly, the Hunyani began to descend rapidly.|$|E

5|$|A {{different}} approach to resolve the problems of range anxiety and lack of recharging infrastructure for electric vehicles was developed by Better Place. Its business model considers that electric cars are built and sold separately from the battery pack. As customers {{are not allowed to}} purchase battery packs, they must lease them from Better Place which will deploy a network of battery swapping stations thus expanding EVs range and allowing long distance trips. Subscribed users pay a per-distance fee to cover battery pack leasing, charging and swap infrastructure, the cost of sustainable electricity, and other costs. Better Place signed agreement for deployment in Australia, Denmark, Israel, Canada, California, and Hawaii. The Renault Fluence Z.E. was the electric car built with switchable battery technology sold for the Better Place network. The robotic battery-switching operation was completed in <b>about</b> <b>five</b> <b>minutes.</b>|$|E
5|$|At around 11:00pm on 6 February 1965, about 300 Viet Cong {{soldiers}} of the 30th Company assembled at their positions outside Camp Holloway, where they began breaking through the wire fences. However, the Viet Cong's mission nearly turned into a disaster when their combat engineers accidentally tripped an electrical wire after breaking through the third fence barrier, but the U.S. Military Police patrolling the area did not detect it. At 1:50am on 7 February 1965, the Viet Cong attackers opened fire with their AK-47 rifles, having successfully penetrated Camp Holloway. Shortly afterwards, the Viet Cong mortared the airfield and the U.S. advisory compound, while the sections of the 30th Company attacked their respective targets with small arms fire. <b>About</b> <b>five</b> <b>minutes</b> later, the Viet Cong began retreating from the facility. Later that morning the Viet Cong claimed victory, having caused the death of eight U.S. soldiers, and another 126 wounded. In addition, ten aircraft were destroyed and 15 more were damaged.|$|E
5|$|In May 1995, Miyazaki took a {{group of}} artists and animators to the ancient forests of Yakushima and the {{mountains}} of Shirakami-Sanchi, taking photographs and making sketches. The landscapes in the film were inspired by Yakushima. In Princess Mononoke, Miyazaki revisited the ecological and political themes of Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind. Miyazaki supervised the 144,000 cels in the film, about 80,000 of which were key animation. Princess Mononoke was produced with an estimated budget of ¥2.35 billion (approximately US$23.5 million), making it the most expensive film by Studio Ghibli at the time. Approximately fifteen minutes of the film uses computer animation: <b>about</b> <b>five</b> <b>minutes</b> uses techniques such as 3D rendering, digital composition, and texture mapping; the remaining ten minutes uses digital ink and paint. While the original intention was to digitally paint 5,000 of the film's frames, time constraints doubled this.|$|E

5|$|The game spans six levels, each lasting <b>about</b> <b>five</b> <b>minutes,</b> with {{a variety}} of boss battles. Over the course of the game, the plot is {{revealed}} through cutscenes using the game's own graphic engine. Gameplay consists of a player controlling a flying dragon and his rider through an aiming reticle that can be moved over the whole screen with the D-pad; the player must shoot a variety of enemies (ranging from machines to monsters) in a 3D post-apocalyptic fantasy environment of barren landscapes and mysterious ruins of a fallen civilization. Progression through the levels is made at a predetermined pace, as the player is constantly set along a rail of gameplay. The only time the game pauses is during boss battles. The field of vision can be directed with the aiming reticle on the x and y-axis, but the overall direction of travel is predetermined. The dragon follows the reticle movements, allowing the player to avoid enemy projectiles and obstacles.|$|E
5|$|The main Austro-Hungarian {{force of}} three light cruisers trailed the leading destroyers by a {{considerable}} distance and Commander Miklós Horthy spotted the Allied force around 09:05. Acton spotted them <b>about</b> <b>five</b> <b>minutes</b> later and manoeuvred his ships {{to cover the}} disabled Aquila rather than crossing the Austrians' T. The British ships opened fire about 09:30, although Horthy's ships quickly laid a smoke screen and turned away through it. Both sides settled on parallel courses to the north-northwest and Bristol gradually began to fall behind and could eventually only use her bow gun at very long range before ceasing fire at 10:15. The British fire was moderately effective, but the Austrian ships concentrated their fire on Dartmouth which was hit three times, although not significantly damaged. Acton reduced his speed around 10:45 to allow Bristol to catch up. At 10:58 he ordered speed to be increased and turned two minutes later in an unsuccessful attempt {{to cut off the}} trailing Austrian cruiser. At 11:04, the British cruisers ceased fire and turned away on Acton's order, presumably to avoid encountering Austro-Hungarian reinforcements which Acton knew were en route. During the battle the British cruisers were repeatedly attacked by Austro-Hungarian aircraft, but they inflicted no significant damage or casualties.|$|E

25|$|Hercules {{also offered}} {{the ability to}} attack pre-located ground targets, after feeding in the {{coordinates}} in an operation that took <b>about</b> <b>five</b> <b>minutes.</b> For these missions the computer used the MTR to guide the missile to a point above the target, then commanded it to dive vertically while measuring any changes in trajectory as it fell. The missile would eventually pass out of line-of-sight with the MTR, so final arming information was provided during the dive, and the warhead was triggered by a barometric fuse.|$|E
50|$|The {{combined}} {{frequency of}} the electric trains from South Hampstead to Watford was thus <b>about</b> every <b>five</b> <b>minutes,</b> and the through Bakerloo trains were additional to this.

The 1933 signalling system had allowed scheduled headways of two minutes on the route.|$|R
