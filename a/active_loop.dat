40|$|The {{investigation}} of a small loop antenna with a single parasitic loop is considered. The two loops are coaxially arranged so the planes of the loops are parallel. Far field equations for the case where the two loops are loosely coupled are derived, first using relations in circuit theory, and second, using the field concept of vector potential. Computer solutions for these equations are obtained and the radiation patterns are plotted. An experimental study is attempted, {{and the results are}} considered. Solutions obtained show that the parasitic loop tends to act as a reflector or as a director depending on its separation from the <b>active</b> <b>loop</b> and on its tuning. This results in bending the two loops of the radiation pattern of the array either toward the <b>active</b> <b>loop</b> or away from it. As the parasitic loop becomes more detuned and more separated from the <b>active</b> <b>loop,</b> the radiation pattern tends to approach that of a single loop antenna. A loss in the signal strength has also resulted. Advisor:Allen R. Ediso...|$|E

The <b>active</b> <b>loop</b> configuration demonstrates a number of advantages that overcome the typical limitations of W-band passive tuners or conventional active open loop techniques in a cost effective way: load reflection coefficients Γ L as high as 0. 95 in magnitude can be achieved at 94 GHz, thus providing a nearly full coverage of the Smith Chart. Possible applications of the setup include technology assessment, large-signal device model verification at sub-THz frequencies, and W-band MMIC design and characterization.

A recently introduced ultralow-loss directional coupler, which has been designed and realized by the authors, provides a number of advantages when used in load-pull test sets. This device has been called the load-pull head. The new ultralow-loss load-pull head can transform any passive precalibrated load-pull system into an easily calibrated and accurate real-time load-pull test set, without losing highreflection- coefficient capabilities. Moreover, if used to realize an <b>active</b> <b>loop,</b> the load-pull head reduces the risks of oscillations and the amount of the loop amplifier output power. As an example application, measurements with a passive real-time load-pull setup of a 30 -W laterally diffused MOS (LDMOS) transistor are presented. Furthermore, some advice to bypass the remaining unavoidable losses due to probes and cables is given. We will show, with measurements and with very simple calculations, that the combined use of load-pull heads, a passive tuner, and an <b>active</b> <b>loop</b> not only boosts the available ΓL but also decreases the loop amplifier output power, with a sensible reduction in the overall cost of the syste...|$|E

40|$|The {{chromatin}} {{architecture is}} constantly changing because of cellular {{processes such as}} proliferation, differentiation {{and changes in the}} expression profile during gene activation or silencing. Unravelling the changes that occur in the chromatin structure during these processes has been a topic of interest for many years. It is known that gene activation of large gene loci is thought to occur by means of an <b>active</b> <b>looping</b> mechanism. It was also shown for the β-globin locus that the gene promoter interacts with an active chromatin hub by means of an <b>active</b> <b>looping</b> mechanism. This means that the locus changes in three-dimensional (3 D) nuclear volume and chromatin shape. As a means of visualizing and measuring these dynamic changes in chromatin structure of the β-globin locus, we used a 3 D DNA-FISH method in combination with 3 D image acquisition to volume render fluorescent signals into 3 D objects. These 3 D chromatin structures were geometrically analysed, and results prior to and after gene activation were quantitatively compared. Confocal and superresolution imaging revealed that the inactive locus occurs in several different conformations. These conformations change in shape and surface structure upon cell differentiation into a more folded and rounded structure that has a substantially smaller size and volume. These physical measurements represent the first non-biochemical evidence that, upon gene activation, an actively transcribing chromatin hub is formed by means of additional chromatin looping...|$|R

This structure shares many similarities, but also significant differences, with the previously determined structures of the inactive internal <b>loop.</b> The <b>active</b> internal <b>loop</b> displays different base-pairing interactions and forms a novel RNA fold composed exclusively of sheared G-A base pairs.

40|$|AbstractHypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferases (HPRTs) are of {{biomedical}} {{interest because}} defects in the enzyme from humans {{can result in}} gouty arthritis or Lesch–Nyhan syndrome, and in parasites these enzymes are potential targets for antiparasite chemotherapy. In HPRTs, a long flexible <b>loop</b> (<b>active</b> site <b>loop</b> II) closes over the active site during the enzyme catalyzed reaction. Functional roles for this loop have been proposed but {{have yet to be}} substantiated. For the present study, seven amino acids were deleted from loop II of the HPRT from Trypanosoma cruzi to probe the functional role of this <b>active</b> site <b>loop</b> in catalysis. The mutant enzyme (Δloop II) was expressed in bacteria, purified by affinity chromatography, and kinetic constants were determined for substrates of both forward (purine salvage) and reverse (pyrophosphorolysis) reactions catalyzed by the enzyme. Loop II deletion resulted in moderate (0. 6 – 2. 7 -fold) changes in the Michaelis constants (Kms) for substrates other than pyrophosphate (PPi), for which there was a 5. 8 -fold increase. In contrast, kcat values were severely affected by loop deletion, with rates that were 240 – 840 -fold below those for the wild-type enzyme.

Domain movements and rearrangement of <b>active</b> site <b>loops</b> change the structure from an open active site form (apoenzyme and γEC complex) to a closed active site form (hGSH•ADP•SO 42 − complex).
