5|$|Shortly after stylists penned {{the first}} design sketches, Holden {{engineers}} {{began work on}} developing the chassis. Opel, which had {{provided the basis for}} all previous Commodore generations, ceased production of their rear-wheel drive Omega in 2003. This meant that Holden had two options: to use another GM platform, or to develop an all-new vehicle. GM's new premium rear-wheel drive Sigma platform was to see production in the 2002 Cadillac CTS. Holden's engineers were offered this platform, but decided it was not appropriate. The Sigma platform's double A-arm front suspension and extensive use of aluminium were too costly for the VE's market segment. The luggage compartment was deemed too small and the Sigma interior package could not be stretched sufficiently to become a family-sized car. In particular, the rear-seat shoulder width was too tight. These major drawbacks made Holden decide to develop an all-new platform, known as the GM Zeta platform, on which a number of forthcoming GM vehicles will also be based. The Zeta suspension system comprises new double-pivot MacPherson strut for the front and a four-link independent rear setup. These replace the previous simple MacPherson strut design front and much criticised semi-trailing <b>arm</b> <b>rear</b> suspension, for improved ride and handling.|$|E

25|$|GNX #001 is the 1986 {{prototype}} currently {{owned by}} Buick and sometimes makes appearances at car shows around the US. The GNX used a unique torque arm that was mounted to a special, GNX only, rear differential cover, for increased traction. The torque <b>arm</b> <b>rear</b> suspension alters the suspension geometry, making the body lift while planting the rear tires down, resulting in increased traction.|$|E

25|$|In North America, Datsun marketed the 810 series Bluebird sold as the Datsun 810 from February 1977 to 1980—the direct {{ancestor}} {{of the long}} running Datsun/Nissan Maxima range. The Datsun 810 model line began with the six-cylinder Nissan Bluebird 2000G6 sold in Japan. With a longer nose than the regular Bluebird, to accommodate a longer inline-six engine, it was powered by {{two versions of the}} SOHC L-series I6 engine: a 2.0L displacement for the Japanese market and a 2.4L24E unit (as found in the Datsun 240Z) for the US market. The Bluebird G6 used a carburetor for the base model and fuel injection for the sporty version. The 2.0L engine was good for 122PS JIS (90kW), while the bigger American engine could reach 125hp SAE (93kW). The sport version channeled power through a four-speed manual transmission for the sedan and wagon, five-speed transmission for the coupe. These cars were rear-wheel drive and had a semi-trailing <b>arm</b> <b>rear</b> suspension. The station wagon variant, only sold in North America, had a rear live axle for load carrying reasons. Some fuel-injected versions had automatic transmissions.|$|E

2500|$|In November 1970, {{the third}} {{generation}} Suzuki Fronte 71 (LC10 II) two-door sedan was introduced. Its aggressive design was {{commonly referred to as}} the [...] "Sting Ray Look". The rear-engined chassis design and engine remained the same as its predecessor the LC10, although with a slightly longer [...] wheelbase. Other minor chassis differences were the addition of a front anti-roll bar and the change to a semi-trailing <b>arm</b> <b>rear</b> suspension layout. There were 31, 34 or 36hp versions available, the lineup being topped by the S, SS, SSS and SSS-R (the letter [...] "R" [...] merely indicating the fitment of radial tires) versions. As of May 1971 a water-cooled version, the LC10W, became available in either GL-W (34hp) or 37hp GT-W/GTR-W ("R" [...] again meaning radial tires) versions. The success of the water-cooled models led Suzuki to quickly introduce further versions, with the lesser GO-W and GS-W models (also with 34hp) appearing two months later.|$|E

The frame makes heavy use of high-strength steel. Mini platform is applicable to either front- or four-wheel drive vehicles, using only front-mounted transverse engines.
