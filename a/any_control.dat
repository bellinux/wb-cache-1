5|$|The larval {{stages of}} B. rufimanus occur inside the seeds, and are {{therefore}} protected from <b>any</b> <b>control</b> measures, including chemical control. Bruchus rufimanus is most vulnerable at the adult stage. Most control measures have therefore targeted adults either at colonization stage in the field or at emergence in storage facilities. Control measures have been focused on direct control with insecticides, but restrictions and removal from market due to environmental concerns have increased the need for alternative measures.|$|E
5|$|Benzylpiperazine is, however, to be {{the subject}} of a European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) risk assessment, the results of which may {{determine}} what, if <b>any,</b> <b>control</b> will placed on BZP throughout the European Union. The risk assessment comes about {{as the result of a}} joint Europol – EMCDDA report which concluded that BZP needs to be looked at in more detail. The results were published in June 2007. The report concluded that the use of BZP can lead to medical problems even if the long effects are still unknown. Taking this concession as a basis, the European Commission has decided to ask the Council to place BZP under control of the UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances. On 4 March 2008, the EU requested countries to place BZP under control within a year and France complied in May 2008.|$|E
5|$|By late 1830, and {{certainly}} {{by the spring}} of 1831, trouble in South Wales looked likely and, probably in response, Bute broke from his normal annual plans and in May travelled south from Scotland to Cardiff Castle. With a reform bill looking likely, tensions grew between the different political factions in Glamorganshire and how the potential new parliamentary seats should be shared out, especially between Bute and his conservative allies, Crawshay and Guest. Radical demonstrations occurred in Merthyr Tydfil, one of the largest industrial communities, in May, and the crowd set light to effigies of conservative politicians. Violence broke out and arrests were made on 10 May; the prisoners were released by the angry crowd and the local authorities effectively lost <b>any</b> <b>control</b> of the town. A general insurrection ensued on 30 May.|$|E

5|$|Pain is {{the presumed}} builder of Pain's Castle in the Welsh county of Radnor. He also {{controlled}} Caus Castle in Shropshire, and through his wife Ludlow Castle {{in the same}} county. Although he held the title to Weobley Castle, he {{does not appear to}} have exercised <b>any</b> <b>control</b> over it, which eventually went to Gilbert de Lacy. Pain was not the only recipient of Hugh de Lacy's lands; some went to Jocelin de Dinan and some to Miles of Gloucester. Pain's share included property in Gloucestershire, Herefordshire, and Worcestershire, and he succeeded in acquiring additional lands near Ludlow, adding to the manors he held there through his wife; his holdings of land were considered to be worth 17 knights fees. By 1130 he had evidently acquired additional properties in Oxfordshire, where he is recorded as being excused payment of danegeld that year.|$|E
5|$|Thames {{subsequently}} {{returned to}} Brest with Allemand's squadron on 25 October, although the British ship was thoroughly looted during the journey by the French sailors, whose officers {{were unable to}} exert <b>any</b> <b>control</b> over them. The ship's officers had been removed, including the surgeon, and therefore the British wounded did not receive medical treatment until the squadron arrived at Brest on 25 October; two subsequently died, making the total British deaths 13, with 21 wounded. Cotes wrote {{a report on the}} engagement, which he sent to the Admiralty from captivity in Gisors, which the French authorities intercepted and delayed, with the result that the first news of Thames fate did not arrive in Britain until 7 May 1794. Cotes was soon afterwards exchanged and returned to Britain, where a court-martial investigating the loss of Thames exonerated him. Several of his officers were not repatriated however, remaining in French captivity for the next two years.|$|E

50|$|In the United States, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act defines what {{substances}} {{require a}} prescription {{for them to be}} dispensed by a pharmacy. The federal government authorizes physicians, psychiatrists, physician assistants, nurse practitioners and other advanced practice nurses, veterinarians, dentists, and optometrists to prescribe <b>any</b> <b>controlled</b> substance. They are then issued unique Drug Enforcement Act numbers; many other mental and physical health technicians, including basic-level registered nurses, medical assistants, emergency medical technicians, most psychologists, and social workers, for example, do not have the authority to prescribe <b>any</b> <b>controlled</b> substance.|$|R

He could only achieve success when he had the film in his possession without <b>any</b> <b>control</b> for at least 2 hours.|$|E
25|$|A run out cannot {{occur if}} no fielder has touched the ball. As such, if a batsman plays a {{straight}} drive which breaks the non-striker's stumps whilst he is outside his crease, {{he is not}} out. However, if a fielder (usually the bowler, in this case) touches the ball at all before it breaks the stumps at the non-striker's end, then it is a run out, even if the fielder never has <b>any</b> <b>control</b> of the ball.|$|E

25|$|Like B-splines, NURBS {{control points}} {{determine}} {{the shape of}} the curve. Each point of the curve is computed by taking a weighted sum of a number of control points. The weight of each point varies according to the governing parameter. For a curve of degree d, the influence of <b>any</b> <b>control</b> point is only nonzero in d+1 intervals (knot spans) of the parameter space. Within those intervals, the weight changes according to a polynomial function (basis functions) of degree d. At the boundaries of the intervals, the basis functions go smoothly to zero, the smoothness being determined by the degree of the polynomial.|$|E
25|$|As the Soviet Union {{fell apart}} {{many of its}} {{projects}} were put on hold, and some cancelled altogether. However, {{for the first time}} there was no longer <b>any</b> <b>control</b> over what theme a building should have or how high it should be. As a result, with generally improving financial conditions architecture grew at a high rate. For the first time modern methods of skyscraper construction were implemented, this resulted in an ambitious Moscow International Business Center. In other cases, architects returned to successful designs of Stalinist architecture, which resulted in buildings like the Triumph Palace in Moscow. New Classical Architecture is also appearing more consistently throughout modern Russia, with a large complex being proposed for Saint Petersburg.|$|E
25|$|In {{part because}} of such long {{retention}} times, as well as growing Internet upload speeds, Usenet is also used by individual users to store backup data in a practice called Usenet backup, or uBackup. While commercial providers offer more easy to use online backup services, storing data on Usenet is free of charge (although access to Usenet itself may not be). The method requires the user to manually select, prepare and upload the data. Because anyone can potentially download the backup files, the data is typically encrypted. After the files are uploaded, the uploader does not have <b>any</b> <b>control</b> over them; the files are automatically copied to all Usenet providers, {{so there will be}} multiple copies of it spread over different geographical locations around the world—desirable in a backup scheme.|$|E

25|$|In 1755 an {{expedition}} was dispatched from Madras to the Tinnevelly country, {{to assist the}} Nawab of the Carnatic, to whom it belonged, in bringing it to some order from the poligar chieftains who actually controlled it. Although the polygars were signally defeated the Nawab's representative was unable to exert <b>any</b> <b>control</b> meriting the name, which led the area to being leased to the British by the Nawab. However, in 1763, when Yusuf Cawn, the only native commander-in-chief of British troops in India, {{and the man who}} had been given charge of Tinnevelly, rebelled and raised the French flag, another expedition was despatched to quell him, after which troops in the area were commanded by British officers and the area administered by native officials on behalf of the Nawab.|$|E
25|$|On April 1, 1922 the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) began a {{nationwide}} strike {{against the man}} with a mask, (A.K.A. Bloody Williamson). W. J. Lester, owner of the Southern Illinois Coal Company, operated a strip mine about halfway between Herrin and Marion, Illinois. Lester at first complied with the strike. He had only recently opened the mine, and massive startup debts made him negotiate with the UMWA to allow his mine to remain open, as long as no coal was shipped out. Under the agreement, some United Mine Workers members were allowed to continue working during the strike. Lester told an associate that local union leaders were friendly with him; however, he was warned this did not mean he had <b>any</b> <b>control</b> over the ordinary members.|$|E
25|$|After the Norman Conquest of England in the 11th century, royal justice {{came to be}} {{administered}} in three central courts: the Court of King's Bench, the Court of Common Pleas, and the Exchequer. The common law developed in these royal courts. To commence litigation in these royal courts, {{it was necessary to}} fit one's claim within a form of action. The plaintiff would purchase a writ in the Chancery, the head of which was the Lord Chancellor. If the law provided no remedy (or no efficacious remedy), litigants could sometimes appeal directly to the King. Eventually, the King would delegate resolution of these petitions to the King's Council. These petitions were eventually delegated to the Lord Chancellor himself. Christianity did play a role in creating Common Law, however it does not have <b>any</b> <b>control</b> or power in the court of law.|$|E
