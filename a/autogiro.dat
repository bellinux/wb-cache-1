50|$|When the Darrieus rotor is spinning, the {{aerofoils}} {{are moving}} forward {{through the air}} in a circular path. Relative to the blade, this oncoming airflow is added vectorially to the wind, so that the resultant airflow creates a varying small positive angle of attack (AoA) to the blade. This generates a net force pointing obliquely forwards along a certain 'line-of-action'. This force can be projected inwards past the turbine axis at a certain distance, giving a positive torque to the shaft, thus helping it to rotate in the direction it is already travelling in. The aerodynamic principles which rotate the rotor are equivalent to that in <b>autogiros,</b> and normal helicopters in autorotation.|$|R
25|$|Under license from Cierva in the 1920s and 1930s, the Pitcairn & Kellett {{companies}} made further innovations.

In April 1941, he handed over command of the unit to his former civilian colleague Alan Marsh. On 9 April 1941, he was appointed to command the Technical Development Unit at the Central Landing Establishment, based at RAF Ringway, and then assumed the rank of acting Wing Commander. The unit carried out {{research and development of}} methods such as landing troops and equipment by parachute or by glider, and notable projects were the Hafner Rotachute and Hafner Rotabuggy.

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of a combined theoretical and experimental investigation conducted at the Georgia School of Technology on the static thrust of the lifting air screw of the type used in modern <b>autogiros</b> and helicopters. The theoretical part of this study is based on Glauert's analysis but certain modifications are made that further clarify and simplify the problem. Of these changes the elimination of the solidity as an independent parameter is the most important. The experimental data were obtained from tests on four rotor models of two, four, and five blades and, in general, agree quite well with the theoretical calculations. The theory indicates a method of evaluating scale effects on lifting air screws, and these corrections have been applied to the model results to derive general full-scale static thrust, torque, and figure-of-merit curves for constant-chord, constant-incidence rotors. Convenient charts are included that enable hovering flight performance to be calculated rapidly...|$|R
25|$|The <b>Autogiro</b> Company of America AC-35 was {{an early}} attempt to make a roadable {{aircraft}} in the United States during the 1930s.

25|$|Although the Rotachute concept {{had proved}} to be practical, the {{operational}} requirement for such a machine never materialised. About eight Rotachutes were constructed, most being progressively converted to Mark III and then to Mark IV specifications. They continued to be flown in ground-based and inflight trials until late 1943, to help research flight characteristics for a follow-on project, the Hafner Rotabuggy, an air-towed land vehicle with <b>autogiro</b> capabilities.|$|E
25|$|Work on {{what would}} become the Skeeter had been {{commenced}} by the Cierva <b>Autogiro</b> Company as the Cierva W.14. Following Saunders-Roe's take over of Cierva, it was decided to continue its projects, including the Skeeter. Despite an initial preference for the rival Fairey Ultra-light Helicopter, which had already been ordered, there was a reversal of fortune when interest from the Bundeswehr in the potential procurement {{of a large number of}} Skeeters. This led to the British order for the Ultra-light Helicopter being cancelled and the Skeeter effectively taking its place, which also served to guarantee an export order from Germany.|$|E
50|$|In 1932 Pullin joined G & J Weir Ltd's {{aircraft}} department, in Glasgow, Scotland, {{as chief}} designer to develop single-place autogyros. Pullin {{and his team}} designed a series of <b>Autogiros</b> {{before moving on to}} a small helicopter using two rotors mounted atop outriggers each side of the fuselage. The Weir W.5 was a single-seat helicopter powered by an air-cooled engine, and established a maximum airspeed of 70 mph. Its two two-blade, fixed-pitch rotors had swashplate-actuated cyclic control. The W.5 made its first flight at Dalrymple, Ayrshire, on 7 June 1938, when it was piloted by Raymond Pullin and it became the first British helicopter to fly successfully. By World War II the W.5 had logged eighty hours' flying time and was followed by a scaled-up version, the W.6, which was the first two-seater helicopter in the world, powered by a much more powerful DH Gipsy aero engine. Further progress on this model was prevented by World War II.|$|R
50|$|The NAA has {{certified}} aviation {{and aerospace}} {{records in the}} United States since 1905 and its records database counts over 8,000 record flights to include those of balloons, airships, airplanes, (landplanes, seaplanes, amphibians, very light jets,) gliders, helicopters, <b>autogiros,</b> model aircraft, parachutes, human powered aircraft, spacecraft, tilt-wing/tilt-engine aircraft, hang gliders, paragliders, microlights, space models, and UAVs. In addition, the NAA certifies {{a wide variety of}} records including altitude, time-to-climb, distance, speed, greatest payload carried, and efficiency. As the U.S. representative to FAI, the National Aeronautic Association is the sole authority for overseeing and certifying all aviation records that take place within the United States. On average, the NAA certifies 150 records each year. The NAA records process is directed by the NAA Contest and Records Board and managed by the NAA Director of Contest and Records, Arthur W. Greendfield. It is easy to carry out a record attempt with an ordinary plane, but there is some paperwork involved.|$|R
25|$|In January 1942, {{trials of}} the Rotachute Mark I were {{conducted}} to assess the aerodynamic characteristics while mounted on the truck-mounted rig, with pilot control of the aircraft in forward motion. On 11 February 1942, the prototype Rotachute was first manually flown from a wheeled trolley while under tow behind a Humber car at Ringway, after starting the rotor by hand. The pilot was Flt Lt I.M. Little, who had experience flying Avro/Cierva C.30 Rota <b>autogiros</b> on radar calibration duties; he was later awarded the Air Force Cross (UK). On that and on a subsequent trial, the machine rolled over after landing, sustaining damage to the blades {{but not to the}} pilot. A tethered test beneath a barrage balloon and a longer test flight at RAF Snaith were both more successful. The flexible tail section evidently offered inadequate directional stability, and the consequence was the Rotachute Mark II, that had a longer tail section braced with wooden formers, plus two landing wheels mounted below the centre of gravity.|$|R
25|$|The U.S. {{industrialist}} Harold Frederick Pitcairn, {{on learning}} of the successful flights of the autogyro, visited De la Cierva in Spain. In 1928, he visited him again, in England, after taking a C.8 L.IV test flight piloted by Arthur H.C.A. Rawson. Being particularly impressed with the autogyro's safe vertical descent capability, Pitcairn purchased a C.8 L.IV with a Wright Whirlwind engine. Arriving in the United States on 11 December 1928 accompanied by Rawson, this autogyro was redesignated C.8W. Subsequently, production of autogyros was licensed {{to a number of}} manufacturers, including the Pitcairn <b>Autogiro</b> Company in the U.S. and Focke-Wulf of Germany.|$|E
25|$|In 1934 the Bureau of Air Commerce {{approached}} Weick's team {{looking for}} standards for a competition {{for a safe}} and practical $700 aircraft. In 1936 {{the winner of the}} competition was the Stearman-Hammond Y-1, incorporating many of the safety features of the W-1. Two other winners were the Waterman Aeroplane and a roadable autogyro, the <b>Autogiro</b> Company of America AC-35. The W-1 was not intended for production to qualify as a competitor, but was purchased by the Bureau for continued experimental tests in spin-control safety. After the prototype W-1 underwent a forced landing, an updated W-1A was built by Fairchild, incorporating leading edge cuffs.|$|E
25|$|Juan de la Cierva was a Spanish {{engineer}} and aeronautical enthusiast. In 1921, {{he participated in}} a design competition to develop a bomber for the Spanish military. De la Cierva designed a three-engined aircraft, but during an early test flight, the bomber stalled and crashed. De la Cierva was troubled by the stall phenomenon and vowed to develop an aircraft that could fly safely at low airspeeds. The result was the first successful rotorcraft, which he named <b>Autogiro</b> in 1923. De la Cierva's autogyro used an airplane fuselage with a forward-mounted propeller and engine, a rotor mounted on a mast, and a horizontal and vertical stabilizer.|$|E

40|$|While {{the history}} of heavier-than-air {{aviation}} has passed the 100 -year mark, {{it could be said}} that the ageold dream of flight is not yet totally fulfilled. Aeronautical technology has advanced, but it has done so at the expense of core expectations that underpin the dream. The principal concession has been vertical takeoff and landing. VTOL remains inaccessible to the common man, just as it was to the ancient Greeks. In this modern age of technical marvels, helicopters can ascend straight up and hover, but they are innately complex and prohibitively expensive. The few rotorcraft that approach general affordability are <b>autogiros</b> that can neither hover, nor fly as fast as fixedwing airplanes. For that matter, not even a full-fledged helicopter will ever be made to cruise at 300 knots. To do so would require a compounding of its complexity that puts both ownership and reliability further out of reach. The “bottom line ” is that rotorcraft development has run its course without realizing the dream for everyman. That leaves all hopes for having both vertical ascension and swift translation resting solely on variants of the basic fixed-wing aircraft. However, during the 20 th century, fixed-wing research was largely a quest for speed, not V/STOL capability. Somewhere along the line, it became generally accepted that long runways (and the ponderous airport infrastructure that goes with them) are necessary to the design of aircraft that can go fast. Such narrow thinking subverts the concept of free, unfettered flight that birds continue to inspire. So it has happened that, after 100 years, man can fly fast, but only from one airport to another. There must be more to it than that. But fixed-wing evolution may not be at a dead end...|$|R
25|$|Development of the {{autogyro}} {{continued in}} the search for a means to accelerate the rotor prior to takeoff (called prerotating). Rotor drives initially took the form of a rope wrapped around the rotor axle and then pulled by a team of men to accelerate the rotor – this was followed by a long taxi to bring the rotor up to speed sufficient for takeoff. The next innovation was flaps on the tail to redirect the propeller slipstream into the rotor while on the ground. This design was first tested on a C.19 in 1929. Efforts in 1930 had shown that development of a light and efficient mechanical transmission was not a trivial undertaking. But, in 1932, the Pitcairn-Cierva <b>Autogiro</b> Company of Willow Grove, Pennsylvania, United States, finally solved the problem with a transmission driven by the engine.|$|E
25|$|In 1947, the Cierva <b>Autogiro</b> Company {{commenced}} {{work on a}} new project, {{which was}} designated as the W.14 Skeeter. As designed, it was a relatively compact two-seat helicopter, intended to be suitable for use as both a civilian aircraft and for aerial observation duties with military customers. The original engine selected to power the Skeeter was a single 110hp Jameson FF-1 air-cooled horizontally-opposed piston engine. On 10 October 1948, the first prototype Skeeter performed its maiden flight at Eastleigh airfield. Initial flight trials of the prototype proved the rotorcraft to be underpowered, which was partially {{as a result of}} the experimental Jameson engine being prone to overheating. In response, the company decided to develop an improved Mark 2 Skeeter which was to be equipped with the well-established de Havilland Gipsy Major 10, which proveded 145hp (108kW). The Mark 2 Skeeter was a noticeably larger aircraft and had a different appearance.|$|E
25|$|Juan de la Cierva {{invented the}} modern {{autogyro}} (<b>autogiro</b> in Spanish) {{in the early}} 1920s. His first three designs (C.1, C.2, and C.3) were unstable because of aerodynamic and structural deficiencies in their rotors. His fourth design, the C.4, made the first documented flight of an autogyro on 17 January 1923, piloted by Alejandro Gomez Spencer at Cuatro Vientos airfield in Madrid, Spain (9 January according to Cierva). De la Cierva had fitted the rotor of the C.4 with flapping hinges to attach each rotor blade to the hub. The flapping hinges allowed each rotor blade to flap, or move up and down, to compensate for dissymmetry of lift, the difference in lift produced between {{the right and left}} sides of the rotor as the autogyro moves forward. Three days later, the engine failed shortly after takeoff and the aircraft descended slowly and steeply to a safe landing, validating De la Cierva's efforts to produce an aircraft that could be flown safely at low airspeeds.|$|E
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} design process started in 1935. The Experimental Development Section of the Bureau of Air Commerce contracted {{the building of}} a roadable aircraft based around an PA-22 autogyro from ACA's parent company, Pitcairn <b>Autogiro</b> Company. The vehicle could fly at high speed in the air, and drive at up to [...] on the ground with its rotors stowed. Six other companies were contracted to produce a roadable aircraft, but the AC-35 {{was the only one that}} met all the requirements.|$|E
2500|$|Between 1930 and 1935, Earhart had set seven women's {{speed and}} {{distance}} aviation records {{in a variety}} of aircraft including the Kinner Airster, Lockheed Vega, and Pitcairn <b>Autogiro.</b> By 1935, recognizing the limitations of her [...] "lovely red Vega" [...] in long, transoceanic flights, Earhart contemplated, in her own words, a new [...] "prize ... one flight which I most wanted to attempt – a circumnavigation of the globe as near its waistline as could be". For the new venture, she would need a new aircraft.|$|E
2500|$|De la Cierva {{developed}} his C.6 model {{with the assistance}} of Spain's Military Aviation establishment, having expended all his funds on development and construction of the first five prototypes. The C.6 first flew in February 1925, piloted by Captain Joaquín Loriga, including a flight of [...] from Cuatro Vientos airfield to Getafe airfield in about 8minutes, a significant accomplishment for any rotorcraft of the time. Shortly after De la Cierva's success with the C.6, Cierva accepted an offer from Scottish industrialist James G. Weir to establish the Cierva <b>Autogiro</b> Company in England, following a demonstration of the C.6 before the British Air Ministry at RAE Farnborough, on 20 October 1925. Britain had become the world centre of autogyro development.|$|E
