5|$|A 1992 phylogenetic {{study of}} {{mitochondrial}} DNA sequences showed a strong {{possibility of a}} clade consisting of Boselaphini, Bovini and Tragelaphini. Bovini consists of the genera Bubalus, Bos, Pseudoryx (saola), Syncerus (African Buffalo), Bison and the extinct Pelorovis. Tragelaphini consists of two genera: Taurotragus (eland) and Tragelaphus. A closer relationship between Boselaphini and Tragelaphini was predicted, and seconded by <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>study</b> in 1999.|$|E

5|$|A {{review of}} {{metformin}} overdoses reported to poison control centers {{over a five-year}} period found serious adverse events were rare, though the elderly appeared to be at greater risk. <b>A</b> <b>similar</b> <b>study</b> in which cases were reported to Texas poison control centers between 2000 and 2006 found ingested doses of more than 5,000mg were more likely to involve serious medical outcomes in adults. Survival following intentional overdoses with up to 63,000mg (63g) of metformin have been reported. Fatalities following overdose are rare. In healthy children, unintentional doses of less than 1,700mg are unlikely to cause significant toxic effects.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>study</b> of Asian Americans {{resulted}} in President Bill Clinton presenting 22 Medals of Honor in 2000.

One of these Medal of Honor recipients was Senator Daniel Inouye, a former U.S. Army officer in the 442nd RCT.|$|E
5|$|Nuclear {{weapons were}} {{developed}} during World War II by the wartime Manhattan Project. Key scientists {{working on the}} project anticipated that their development would have wide-ranging implications. However the project director, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., was reluctant to spend project funds on activities beyond those required to win the war. Nonetheless, Arthur Compton of the Metallurgical Project in Chicago commissioned a report on post-war nuclear energy, and the Military Policy Committee, the Manhattan Project's governing body, commissioned <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>study</b> by Richard Tolman. Both reports called for a comprehensive, government-supported nuclear energy program, with military, scientific, and industrial aspects.|$|E

25|$|<b>A</b> <b>similar</b> <b>study</b> in 2007 using samples {{exclusively}} from Europe {{found that the}} most important genetic differentiation in Europe occurs on a line from the north to the south-east (northern Europe to the Balkans), with another east-west axis of differentiation across Europe. Its findings were consistent with earlier results based on mtDNA and Y-chromosonal DNA that support the theory that modern Iberians (Spanish and Portuguese) hold the most ancient European genetic ancestry, as well as separating Basques and Sami from other European populations.|$|E
25|$|It is {{recommended}} to buy captive bred box turtles (in areas {{where this is}} allowed) to reduce the pressure put on the wild populations. A 3-year study in Texas indicated that over 7,000 box turtles {{were taken from the}} wild for commercial trade. <b>A</b> <b>similar</b> <b>study</b> in Louisiana found that in a 41-month period, nearly 30,000 box turtles were taken from the wild for resale, many for export to Europe. Once captured, turtles are often kept in poor conditions where up to half of them die. Those living long enough to be sold may suffer from conditions such as malnutrition, dehydration, and infection.|$|E
