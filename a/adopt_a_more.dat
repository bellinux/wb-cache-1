5|$|As a Liberal MP he {{supported}} Irish Home Rule, trade unions, {{free trade and}} welfare reforms. Leading up to the First World War he argued that Britain should <b>adopt</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> sympathetic approach towards Germany, including naval disarmament. When war did break out, Brunner was resolute in the opinion {{that it should be}} fought and won. In addition to the production of alkali, his factories were making other chemicals for use as explosives. He also built a new factory to purify trinitrotoluene.|$|E
5|$|Leslie was a Confederate sympathizer {{during the}} Civil War, but began to <b>adopt</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> {{progressive}} position during his gubernatorial campaign against Harlan. Though he opposed {{ratification of the}} Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, he used his influence as governor to effect passage of laws admitting the testimony of blacks in court and providing for an educational system for recently freed slaves. He also helped quell violence perpetrated by the Ku Klux Klan {{in many areas of}} the state.|$|E
5|$|Lumumba's speech, {{broadcast}} {{live on the}} radio across the world, denounced colonialism and was interpreted as an affront to Belgium and Baudouin personally. While it was well-received within the Congo, it was widely condemned internationally as unnecessarily confrontational and for showing ingratitude {{at a time when}} Belgium had granted independence to the state. The speech nearly provoked a diplomatic incident between the Congo and Belgium and Lumumba later gave further speeches attempting to <b>adopt</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> conciliatory tone.|$|E

5|$|On {{the basis}} of Ice's good looks and dance moves, Public Enemy tried to {{convince}} their producer, Hank Shocklee, to sign Ice to Def Jam, but Ice later {{signed a contract with}} SBK Records in 1990. SBK remixed and re-recorded Hooked under the title To the Extreme. The reissue contained new artwork and music. According to Ice, SBK paid him to <b>adopt</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> commercial, conventional appearance. This led Ice to later regret his business agreements with SBK.|$|E
5|$|After {{eight other}} {{publishers}} had rejected Philosopher's Stone, Bloomsbury offered Rowling a £2,500 advance for its publication. Despite Rowling's statement {{that she did}} not have any particular age group in mind when beginning to write the Harry Potter books, the publishers initially targeted children aged nine to eleven. On the eve of publishing, Rowling was asked by her publishers to <b>adopt</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> gender-neutral pen name in order to appeal to the male members of this age group, fearing {{that they would not be}} interested in reading a novel they knew to be written by a woman. She elected to use J. K. Rowling (Joanne Kathleen Rowling), using her grandmother's name as her second name because she has no middle name.|$|E
5|$|Although he was successful, Ice later regretted his {{business}} arrangements with SBK, which had paid him to <b>adopt</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> commercial appearance {{to appeal to}} a mass audience and published fabricated biographical information without his knowledge. After surviving a suicide attempt, Ice was inspired to change his musical style and lifestyle. While his later, less mainstream albums failed to chart or receive much radio airplay, Ice has had a loyal underground following. In 2009, Ice began hosting The Vanilla Ice Project on DIY Network. His latest album WTF – Wisdom, Tenacity & Focus was released in August 2011. Ice is currently signed to Psychopathic Records.|$|E

5|$|Bartolomé de las Casas spent 50 {{years of}} his life {{actively}} fighting slavery and the violent colonial abuse of indigenous peoples, especially by trying to convince the Spanish court to <b>adopt</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> humane policy of colonization. Unlike the other priests who sought to destroy all of the indigenous peoples native books and writings, he was strictly opposed to this action. Although he failed to save the indigenous peoples of the Western Indies, his efforts resulted in several improvements in the legal status of the natives, and in an increased colonial focus on the ethics of colonialism. Las Casas is often seen {{as one of the first}} advocates for universal conception of human dignity (later human rights).|$|E
5|$|Since its return, {{the tournament}} has used an unusual point scoring system. As with most league competitions, three points are awarded for a win, {{one for a}} draw and zero for a loss. An {{additional}} point, however, is awarded for each goal scored. The system is designed to reward teams that <b>adopt</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> attacking style of play. Each entrant plays two matches, with the winner being the club that finishes {{at the top of}} the table. The original competition was held at De Meer, Ajax's home between 1934 and 1996. The Amsterdam Arena has played host to the event since its return.|$|E
5|$|The Chief Justice of Singapore, Chan Sek Keong, {{suggested}} extrajudicially {{during a}} 2010 lecture that Singapore courts may not apply the sufficient interest test {{with the same}} rigour as the UK courts. A more stringent application of the sufficient interest test would be {{in line with the}} green-light approach that the courts adopt in administrative law. Under this approach, the Government commits itself to good administrative practices while the courts play a supporting role by articulating clear rules for the executive to adhere to. Accordingly, the courts may <b>adopt</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> discriminating standing test to discourage litigation that will unnecessarily curtail the executive's ability to carry out good governance.|$|E

50|$|The NZR was {{established}} in June 1905 in Congress Poland by National Democracy (ND) {{in order to increase}} its support amongst the working class. However, following the Revolution of 1905, it broke away from ND, which had <b>adopted</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> pro-Russian approach. By 1906 the party had 15,961 members. It subsequently left the National League and joined the Temporary Commission of Confederated Independence Parties in 1912 after <b>adopting</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> pro-Austrian position.|$|R

5|$|Clinton joined friend Bruce Lindsey's Little Rock {{law firm}} of Wright, Lindsey and Jennings. In 1982, he was elected {{governor}} a second time and kept the office for ten years. Effective with the 1986 election, Arkansas had changed its gubernatorial term of office from two to four years. During his term, he helped transform Arkansas's economy and improved the state's educational system. For senior citizens, he removed the sales tax from medications and increased the home property-tax exemption. He became a leading figure among the New Democrats, a group of Democrats who advocated welfare reform, smaller government, and other policies not supported by liberals. Formally organized as the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC), the New Democrats argued that in light of President Ronald Reagan's landslide victory in 1984, the Democratic Party needed to <b>adopt</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> centrist political stance in order to succeed at the national level. Clinton delivered the Democratic response to Reagan's 1985 State of the Union Address and served {{as chair of the}} National Governors Association from 1986 to 1987, bringing him to an audience beyond Arkansas.|$|E
5|$|In 1653–55 {{there was}} a major Royalist rising in the Highlands led by William Cunningham, 9th Earl of Glencairn (1610–64) and former Covenanter soldier John Middleton (1608–74). It was {{particularly}} threatening to the regime because it coincided with the First Dutch War (1652–54). Glencairn was given command of the Royalist forces in Scotland by Charles II. He convened a meeting of Scottish notables at Lochearn in August 1653. Among those present were John Murray, 1st Marquess of Atholl, Archibald Campbell, eldest son of the Marquis of Argyll, Lord Loin, Donald MacDonell of Glengarry, Ewen Cameron of Lochiel, John Graham of Duchray and Colonel Blackadder of Tullyallan. These notables then mustered their vassals and supporters to form a small army of about 60 horse, and a force of foot, made up of 60–80 Lowlanders and 150 Highlanders. The governor of Stirling Castle, Colonel Kidd, sallied out to suppress this force, but was defeated at Aberfoyle. This victory boosted morale and the rising gained some support from Lowland Scottish lords, forcing the Commonwealth government to <b>adopt</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> conciliatory attitude to these groups.|$|E
5|$|In the 66thminute, Alex Ferguson {{completed}} his attacking quartet by bringing Dimitar Berbatov on {{in place of}} Park. Ronaldo was penalised for a high elbow when challenging for a header with Puyol a minute later, before Rooney forced another corner off Piqué in the 69thminute. However, United's numbers up front in search of another goal left them wanting in defence; a weak clearance from Van der Sar was cut out by Puyol who played the ball to Eto'o {{on the right side}} of the penalty area. The ball broke to Xavi on the edge of the area, who crossed for Messi to send a looping header over the United goalkeeper and into the far side of the goal for a two-goal lead. Immediately after the goal, Henry was replaced by Seydou Keita, allowing Barcelona to <b>adopt</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> defensive stance.|$|E

5|$|On Süleyman's {{explicit}} advice, {{a revolutionary}} delegation was dispatched to Istanbul, {{where it was}} to negotiate the movement's official recognition—among the envoys were Bălcescu, Ștefan Golescu, and Dimitrie Bolintineanu. By that moment, Russian diplomats had persuaded the Porte to <b>adopt</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> reserved attitude, and to replace Süleyman with a rapporteur for the Divan, Fuat Pasha. In parallel, Russia ordered its troops in Bessarabia to prepare for an intervention over the Prut River and into Bucharest—the prospect of a Russo-Turkish war was inconvenient for Abdülmecid, {{at a time when}} the French Second Republic and the United Kingdom failed to clarify their positions in respect to Ottoman policies. Stratford Canning, the British Ambassador to the Porte, even advised Ottoman officials to intervene against the Revolution, thus serving Prime Minister Palmerston's policy regarding the preservation of Ottoman rule in the face of outside pressures. The Wallachian delegation was denied reception, and, after a prolonged stay, had to return to Bucharest.|$|E
5|$|The Europeans {{were also}} {{concerned}} about the long-term goals of the Mongols. Early Mongol diplomacy had been not a simple offer of cooperation, but straightforward demands for submission. It was only in later communications that Mongol diplomats started to <b>adopt</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> conciliatory tone; but they still used language that implied more command than entreaty. Even the Armenian historian Hayton of Corycus, the most enthusiastic advocate of Western-Mongol collaboration, freely admitted that the Mongol leadership was not inclined to listen to European advice. His recommendation was that even if working together, European armies and Mongol armies should avoid contact because of Mongol arrogance. European leaders were aware that the Mongols would not have been content to stop at the Holy Land, but were on a clear quest for world domination. If the Mongols had achieved a successful alliance with the West and destroyed the Mamluk Sultanate, they certainly would have eventually turned upon the Franks of Cyprus and the Byzantines. They also would have surely conquered Egypt, from which they could have continued an advance into Africa, where no strong state could have stood in their way until Morocco and the Islamic caliphates in the Maghreb.|$|E
5|$|The Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenesrenamed Yugoslavia in 1929was {{created on}} 1December 1918, and {{incorporated}} Bosnia-Herzegovina. Stojanović continued studying medicine in Zagreb. As a former activist of Young Bosnia, {{he was offered}} a King's scholarship but he refused it. In Zagreb, he reunited with his former schoolmate Nikola Nikolić, who had also {{been a member of}} National Unity. After his release from the Zenica prison, Nikolić was drafted into the Austrian army and sent to the Russian front where he surrendered to the Russians and participated in the October Revolution. Nikolić's account of the revolution influenced Stojanović to <b>adopt</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> leftist stance. During this period, Stojanović's favourite authors were Maksim Gorky and Miroslav Krleža. His professor of anatomy, Drago Perović, arranged for him to visit an anatomical institute in Vienna. Stojanović went there several times in 1921 and 1922 and befriended members of a leftist association of Yugoslav students at the Vienna University. When they held a protest against the king and government of Yugoslavia, Stojanović took part and delivered a speech. Behind the protest stood the Communist Party of Yugoslavia (Komunistička partija Jugoslavije, KPJ).|$|E

5|$|The couple {{moved to}} Drumcondra in October 1919, where Thomas {{found a job}} as a bank cashier. The job did not pay well, but the two managed on his meagre wages. In early 1920, they moved to Grove Road in the Rathmines district, and Brendan was born in October. Soon afterwards, Brendan and his mother were nearly killed when caught in the cross-fire between the controversial, mostly British {{temporary}} constables employed by the Royal Irish Constabulary—Black and Tans—and the Irish Republican Army (IRA). In 1921, Brendan's brother Raymond was born, followed by sisters Clare and Monica, and a brother, Kevin. The household was somewhat split over religious and political issues. Their father was a teetotaller and a strict Catholic. Their mother, however, encouraged the elder brothers to <b>adopt</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> liberal leaning in life. Brendan was educated at Synge Street and Marlborough Street. At 10, Brendan showed a keen interest in sport, particularly rugby.|$|E
5|$|Tropical illness took {{a toll on}} the Europeans at Fernando Po, where {{hundreds}} died during Nicolls's time there. Nineteen of the 34 men in Nicolls's first contingent died soon after their arrival, and only five of the original 47 Royal Marines who accompanied him to Fernando Po in 1829 survived two years of duty on the station. Nicolls, somewhat restored to health, served a second term as Superintendent of Fernando Po during 1832–1833. Despite his differences with Owen, Nicolls was just as determined to disrupt the slave trade, and equally energetic in his attempts to convince the British government to <b>adopt</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> aggressive stance. Frustrated in territorial annexation schemes, he invited the West African rulers of Bimbia, Old Calabar, Camaroon, Malimba, and the Bonny to Fernando Po to form an anti-slavery alliance. To Nicolls' disappointment, the British government ordered him to evacuate Fernando Po on 29 August 1832, {{and put an end}} to operations there. Unfinished work and efforts to provide for the welfare of liberated and displaced slave populations delayed the end of Nicolls's mandate for several months, and he did not return to England until April 1835.|$|E
5|$|At the {{strategic}} level the ARVN and the South Vietnamese government had both rallied after {{appearing on the}} verge of collapse and the communist threat against Saigon had subsided, yet additional troop increases were required if Westmoreland was to <b>adopt</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> offensive strategy, with US troop levels planned to rise from 210,000 in January 1966 to 327,000 by December 1966. The Australian government increased its own commitment to the ground war in March 1966, announcing the deployment of a two battalion brigade—the 1st Australian Task Force (1 ATF)—with armour, aviation, engineer and artillery support; in total 4,500 men. Additional Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) and the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) force elements would also be deployed and with all three services total Australian strength in Vietnam was planned to increase to 6,300 personnel. 1 RAR was subsequently replaced by 1 ATF which was allocated its own area of operations in Phuoc Tuy Province, thereby allowing the Australians to pursue operations more independently using their own counter-insurgency tactics and techniques. The task force arrived between April and June 1966, constructing a base at Nui Dat, while logistic arrangements were provided by the 1st Australian Logistic Support Group which was established at the port of Vung Tau.|$|E
