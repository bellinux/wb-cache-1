40|$|A {{controlled}} {{field experiment}} investigates order picking performance {{in terms of}} productivity. We examined three manual picker-to-parts order picking methods (parallel, zone, and dynamic zone picking) under two different incentive systems (competition-based vs. cooperation-based) for pickers with different regulatory foci (prevention-focus vs. promotion-focus). The study {{was carried out in}} a warehouse erected especially for the purposes of order picking research. Our results show that when using a parallel picking method, <b>a</b> competition-based <b>incentive</b> system increases productivity compared to <b>a</b> cooperation-based <b>incentive</b> system, and that when using a zone picking method it is more productive to use <b>a</b> cooperation-based <b>incentive</b> system. This pattern of results was especially pronounced for pickers with a dominant promotion focus. Dominantly, prevention-focused pickers were more productive in zone picking with <b>a</b> cooperation-based <b>incentive</b> system than <b>a</b> competition-based <b>incentive</b> system, but in the other two picking methods the <b>incentive</b> systems delivered <b>a</b> similar productivity performance. No effects on order picking quality were identified. The analyses demonstrate that by aligning order picking methods, incentive systems, and regulatory focus, warehouses can substantially improve productivity...|$|R

Behan's sympathy to the Cowboys was well known, and during the trial he firmly denied he had contributed money to help Ike with his defense costs. However, documents were located in 1997 that showed Behan served as guarantor for a loan to Ike Clanton during the Spicer hearing.

5|$|By {{the end of}} this period, the {{constant}} attempts at reorganisation had proved a mixed bag, particularly for the auxiliary forces.

The system of central per-capita grants helped support the units, despite the worrying side-effect of causing <b>an</b> <b>incentive</b> to keep as many men on the books as possible regardless of fitness, but even so it was becoming apparent that many Volunteer Corps were headed towards financial collapse unless some action were taken.|$|E

40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{the case for}} R&D subsidies in export sectors when the outcome of R&D is uncertain and the product market is oligopolistic. When R&D reduces expected costs in the particular sense of lirst-order stochastic dominance, a national strategic basis for R&D subsidies exists, whether firms choose prices or quantities. This must be balanced against <b>a</b> corrective <b>incentive</b> to tax R&D whenever the number of domestic firms exceeds one. However, when R&D increases the riskiness of the cost distribution as well, the results may switch: there emerges <b>a</b> strategic <b>incentive</b> to tax and <b>a</b> corrective <b>incentive</b> to subsidize R&D. 1...|$|R
