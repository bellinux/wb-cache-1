5|$|The <b>approach</b> <b>will</b> {{be based}} on {{utilizing}} a novel selective photocatalytic oxidation technology for the selective oxidation of ethylene and ethane to acetic acid. Unlike traditional oxidation catalysts, the selective oxidation process will use UV light to produce acetic acid at ambient temperatures and pressure.|$|E
5|$|Another {{approach}} is possible, originally developed by Anatoliy Skorokhod and Andrei Kolmogorov, for a continuous-time stochastic process with any metric space as its state space. For {{the construction of}} such a stochastic process, {{it is assumed that}} the sample functions of the stochastic process belong to some suitable function space, which is usually the Skorokhod space consisting of all right-continuous functions with left limits. This {{approach is}} now more used than the separability assumption, but such a stochastic process based on this <b>approach</b> <b>will</b> be automatically separable.|$|E

50|$|Using Hückel's Rule, one {{can tell}} if the π-system is {{aromatic}} or anti-aromatic. If aromatic, linear approaches use disrotatory motion while non-linear approaches use conrotatory motion. The opposite goes with an anti-aromatic system. Linear <b>approaches</b> <b>will</b> have conrotatory motion while non-linear <b>approaches</b> <b>will</b> have disrotatory motion.|$|R

25|$|A {{traditional}} {{model of}} a biological system will focus on capturing its most important parameters. In contrast, an alife modeling <b>approach</b> <b>will</b> generally seek to decipher the most simple and general principles underlying life and implement them in a simulation. The simulation then offers the possibility to analyse new and different lifelike systems.|$|E
25|$|The {{background}} {{is assumed to}} be the frame at time t. This difference image would only show some intensity for the pixel locations which have changed in the two frames.

25|$|While {{contraceptive}} vaccines can {{be delivered}} remotely, they still require administration to each individual animal {{that is to be}} made infertile. Thus contraceptive vaccines have been used to control only relatively small populations of wildlife. Australia and New Zealand have large populations of European invasive species for which such <b>approach</b> <b>will</b> not scale. Research in these countries has therefore focused on genetically modifying viruses or microorganisms that infect the unwanted invasive species to contain immunocontraceptive antigens.|$|E
25|$|There {{are times}} when an uninitiated dog owner or a new enthusiast {{mistakes}} the Koolie as a shy, reserved or even a timid animal. The Koolie's temperament needs to be understood in proper context when one seeks an optimal match of skills and demeanour. Koolies are intelligent animals, and the most experienced handlers know well that they need guidance in training. A steady and supportive <b>approach</b> <b>will</b> be productive, proving the Koolie's adaptability in diverse situations when given time.|$|E
25|$|The {{ecosystem}} {{approach is a}} strategy for the integrated management of land, water and living resources that promotes conservation and sustainable use in an equitable way. Application of the ecosystem <b>approach</b> <b>will</b> help to reach a balance of the three objectives of the Convention. An {{ecosystem approach}} {{is based on the}} application of appropriate scientific methodologies focused on levels of biological organization, which encompasses the essential structures, processes, functions and interactions among organisms and their environment. It recognizes that humans, with their cultural diversity, are an integral component of many ecosystems.|$|E

25|$|At the Manor Christmas party, Will {{once again}} sees Dawson and Old George {{who seem to}} know him well. Miss Greythorne and Merriman debate about {{when and how to}} <b>approach</b> <b>Will</b> about his destiny. Maggie Barnes (Amelia Warner), an {{attractive}} local girl appears at the party and Will becomes upset when one of his older brothers approaches her and begins chatting to her. Will leaves the Manor, and an ominous figure mounted on a white horse and accompanied by dogs chases Will. As the ominous figure prepares to kill Will, who is currently no match for him, Miss Greythorne, Merriman, Dawson, and Old George suddenly appear and save Will. Merriman names the threatening figure as The Rider (Christopher Eccleston), who warns them all that in five days' time his power – The Dark – will rise. The four adults are the last of the Old Ones – ancient warriors who serve The Light – and take Will on a walk through time and space to a place called the Great Hall, which in the present day is the church the Stantons attend. Will is the last of the Old Ones to have been born: he is the seventh son of a seventh son whose power begins to ascend on his fourteenth birthday, though Will disputes this idea because he believes he is the sixth son. Will is The Seeker: the sign-seeker who must locate six Signs whose possession will grant The Light power over The Dark. The Rider is also seeking them. Will returns home to his attic room and falls and twists his ankle. The doctor who calls is The Rider in disguise but he is recognized by Will. The Rider demonstrates his powers on Will’s ankle by alternately healing it and making it much worse before restoring it to its injured state; he offers Will the chance to have any desire he wants fulfilled in exchange for giving him the signs. Will discovers he has a lost twin brother named Tom, who, as a baby, mysteriously disappeared one night and was never found. Merriman instructs Will on his powers, which include sensing the Signs, summoning superhuman strength, commanding light and fire, telekinesis, stepping through time, and the unique knowledge to decipher an ancient text in the Book of Gramarye. Unfortunately, Will learns he can't fly, a power he wanted.|$|E
500|$|In {{regards to}} Microsoft naming the new {{operating}} system Windows 10 instead of Windows 9, Terry Myerson said that [...] "based {{on the product}} that's coming, and just how different our <b>approach</b> <b>will</b> be overall, it wouldn't be right to call it Windows 9." [...] He also joked {{that they could not}} call it [...] "Windows One" [...] (alluding to several recent Microsoft products with a similar brand, such as OneDrive, OneNote, and Xbox One) because Windows 1.0 already existed. Tony Prophet, Microsoft Vice President of Windows Marketing, said at a San Francisco conference in October 2014 that Windows 9 [...] "came and went", and that Windows 10 is not [...] "an incremental step from Windows 8.1," [...] but [...] "a material step.

[...] The Milwaukee Journal gave the film 3 stars, calling it [...] "the most chilling science fiction thriller since Alien." [...] A review in Orange Coast magazine stated that [...] "the distinguishing virtue of The Terminator is its relentless tension. Right from the start it's all action and violence with no time taken to set up the story... It's like a streamlined Dirty Harry movie– no exposition at all; just guns, guns and more guns." [...] In the May 1985 issue of Cinefantastique it was referred to as a film that [...] "manages to be both derivative and original at the same time... not since The Road Warrior has the genre exhibited so much exuberant carnage" [...] and [...] "an example of science fiction/horror at its best... Cameron's no-nonsense <b>approach</b> <b>will</b> make him a sought-after commodity". In the United Kingdom the Monthly Film Bulletin praised the film's script, special effects, design and Schwarzenegger's performance.|$|E
