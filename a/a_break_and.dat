5|$|After Kieswetter's {{retirement}} from cricket, his father {{suggested that he}} take <b>a</b> <b>break</b> <b>and</b> play some golf. He had done so during his youth in South Africa, playing in provincial tournaments. After some lessons with David Leadbetter, who suggested that he try to become a professional golfer, Kieswetter began to enter amateur tournaments. After performing well in those events, he set himself a target of becoming a professional, and playing regularly on the European Tour. In late 2016, he {{took part in a}} couple of PGA EuroPro Tour tournaments and one on the MENA Golf Tour. In early 2017, he turned professional and in March played in the MENA Golf Tour qualifying school in Morocco, finishing tied for 31st place and earning a card for the 2017 season. He played regularly on the Tour during 2017 and in September won his biggest prize of the season, winning US$360 in the Dubai Creek Open after finishing tied for 38th place.|$|E

After a few {{unlikely}} wins, the Kid calls for <b>a</b> <b>break</b> <b>and</b> confronts Shooter, who admits to being forced into cheating by Slade. The Kid insists he can win {{on his own and}} tells Shooter to deal straight or he will blow the whistle, destroying Shooter's reputation. Before the game resumes, Melba succeeds in seducing the Kid. Christian makes a surprise visit to the room, catches them after the fact and walks out on The Kid.|$|E

Bumgarner was rested for what would have been his final start of the season, following a great seven-inning, one-run, 10-strikeout win over the New York Mets. Bochy said he wanted to give Bumgarner <b>a</b> <b>break</b> <b>and</b> also allow Barry Zito a final home start. Bumgarner finished in ninth place for the National League Cy Young Award voting by the Baseball Writers' Association of America.|$|E

He added that two types of camera– the Alexa XT and the Red Dragon– were being used to film a number of mild movement shots throughout the film. On 17June 2015, Siva told the media that all filming except for a week of patchwork was finished. By then, a song sequence focusing on the lead pair was being filmed at Ramoji Film City.|$|E
5|$|John Smith became {{chairman}} in 1973 with his business experience {{to build a}} more corporate view for the club. He ended the club's policy of changing chairmen every three years. In 1973 the old Main Stand was demolished and replaced with official opening by the Duke of Kent on 10March 1973. They exited to Yugoslav team Red Star Belgrade in the 1973–74 European Cup second round. Their 1973-74 Football League campaign was bookended with poor results (in contrast to champions Leeds United unbeaten in their first league 29 games). Liverpool finished second. A second FA Cup win came with two goals by Keegan and one by Heighway in the 1974 FA Cup Final beating Newcastle United 3–0. Ray Kennedy's end of season transfer from Arsenal was Shankly's last act as Liverpool manager. He resigned citing the need for <b>a</b> <b>break</b> <b>and</b> was replaced by his assistant Bob Paisley.|$|E

5|$|Five days of filming {{were spent}} at the London Underground tunnels. Filming took place on actual tube tunnels, albeit disused ones. As the crew were {{scouting}} the disused Aldwych tunnels, they found the ex-Northern line 1972 stock train stabled in the tunnel for maintenance, training, and filming purposes. When Sam Miller called Cross about the development, the writer included it as a last minute addition to the script, and the sequence was shot the next day. As a way to scare the audience, Cross included a homeless woman living in the train. The filming crew present disliked filming the Underground sequences because while filmed during the summer, it became hot locations to work in. The crew were prohibited from bringing food or drink into the tunnels, as it would attract rats. Furthermore, break times had to be longer than usual because {{it would take a}} while for a crew member to leave the tunnels, have <b>a</b> <b>break</b> <b>and</b> then return. The FSB base was filmed in the London Docklands, near the ExCeL London.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Scully {{visit the}} murderer's house, where Mulder sees a {{repairman}} {{working on the}} cable line. They find hundreds of video tapes of the news. Scully believes all the violence the man watched on TV may have {{led him to the}} murders, something Mulder does not believe. That night Scully watches the tapes, seeing if there are any clues to why the man committed murder. She steps outside for <b>a</b> <b>break</b> <b>and</b> sees Mulder in a car talking to the Cigarette Smoking Man. In the morning Scully suspiciously asks Mulder if he moved the car in the night. When Mulder tells her he only went out for a paper earlier, she believes he is lying. The next day a similar murder occurs when a woman thinks she sees her husband in a hammock with another woman; in reality she has killed her neighbor who was in a hammock with his dog. Mulder sees the same cable repairman near the house, who escapes from him. Climbing up on the telephone pole Mulder finds a device inside the cable box.|$|E
5|$|The Sussex captain, Arnold Long, won the toss {{and chose}} to bowl first, hoping that morning dew might give his bowlers an advantage. Brian Rose scored 14 {{runs from the}} first over, bowled by Imran, who later took Somerset's first wicket, bowling Denning before the batsman had scored a run. That brought Richards to the crease, and Long {{immediately}} changed both of his bowlers, replacing the quick bowling of the openers with the slower deliveries of Giles Cheatle and John Spencer. Cheatle dismissed Rose in his first over, caught down the leg side by the wicket-keeper, Long after scoring 44 runs. Peter Roebuck also got out to Cheatle, scoring nine runs before being caught by Mendis. Botham joined Richards in the middle, and immediately scored a four with a straight drive, followed by two hooks for sixes. Cheatle and Spencer each bowled their entire allocation of 12 overs without <b>a</b> <b>break,</b> <b>and</b> were followed {{by the introduction of}} another slow bowler, John Barclay. Although Richards finished as the competition's leading run-scorer, Woodcock said that he struggled to score fluently, particularly against the spin bowling of Barclay and Cheatle. In the Wisden Cricketers' Almanacks summary of the season, Jack Alridge praised Long's captaincy in the final, highlighting the use of slower bowling against Richards and Ian Botham as being particularly commendable. Vic Marks, who also played in the match for Somerset, suggested that Botham was the only Somerset batsman to play with freedom, and said {{that the rest of the}} team were nervous and intimidated by the prospect of winning Somerset's first trophy. Richards scored 44 runs, and Botham 80, including three sixes, but none of the rest of the middle- or lower-order batsmen made a significant score and Somerset finished their innings on 207 for 7. Along with Barclay, Spencer bowled particularly economically for Sussex.|$|E

5|$|Tucker and Devon {{continue}} to bond over their shared interest in music while Tucker manages {{to put aside}} his differences with Katherine. He and Harmony later find a specialist to operate on Devon to fully repair his hearing. Afterward, Ashley and Tucker begin having marital problems when it is revealed that Tucker {{had a relationship with}} Genevieve Atkinson, Jack's ex-fiancée, when they were teens. Ashley decides they need <b>a</b> <b>break</b> <b>and</b> before leaving town, she catches Tucker and Harmony in bed and files for divorce. Tucker's actions destroy all the progress he's made with Devon, but the two manage to rebuild their relationship. Tucker supports Ashley when Abby is supposedly kidnapped and they even share a kiss but Ashley still serves him with divorce papers. Tucker then began to advise Sharon Newman (Sharon Case) to take more power at Newman Enterprises, as Victor had disappeared after their wedding. She takes over as CEO while beginning an affair with Tucker; in reality, Tucker had hired Genevieve to find Victor and keep him away from Genoa City so Tucker can buy up all of the Newman Enterprises stock. Once Victor was presumed dead in Los Angeles, Sharon decided to marry Tucker, but Genevieve turned her back on Tucker and brought Victor back alive, who stopped the wedding. With Victor alive, Jack was forced to sell all of his Newman stock as well as Beauty of Nature to Tucker in order to make his margin call. Yet, Jack, with Genevieve's help, tried to blackmail Tucker to win back Beauty of Nature or else the SEC would investigate his recent actions. Tucker decided to face the SEC and sell Beauty of Nature back to Victor in order to stop Victor from pursuing continuing a criminal investigation into Sharon's actions. Victor agreed to Tucker's deal but an unaware Sharon went to the SEC and told them of the shell corporations Tucker set up to secretly buy up Newman stock. Victor informed Sharon of his deal with Tucker and she rushed to his office only to find Tucker being arrested by the SEC and FBI as she apologized to Tucker as he was led away asking if Sharon was responsible for his arrest. He was eventually released after Sharon recanted her story to the SEC. Jill later tried to convince Katherine to forgive Tucker, which she eventually did. After they became on better terms, Tucker announced he was moving to Hong Kong, leaving Katherine devastated. Tucker and Katherine are reunited just before she passes away. According to Devon, Katherine's death hits Tucker a lot harder than he would like to admit. Tucker is so devastated that he cannot attend Katherine's funeral. Katherine leaves Tucker her record collection saying music was his first and true passion.|$|E

Studies show this may decrease the rate of property crime by up to 50% in the local area.|$|E

25|$|The rest of {{the half}} was a tight affair, with England edging in front from {{applying}} pressure and Jonny Wilkinson's boot put them up to a 9–5 lead after Australian indiscipline gave away several penalties, but were unable to capitalise on their territory.

Lawrence Dallaglio made <b>a</b> <b>break</b> <b>and</b> popped the ball inside to Jonny Wilkinson, who drew the defence before putting Robinson away in the corner for a try.
