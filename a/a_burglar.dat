25|$|They {{looked at}} the case as a murder, with the {{burglary}} staged to throw the police off the trail.

The condo {{was in the middle}} of a gated complex, surrounded by other units from which burglars could have expected to be easily observed.

25|$|Although {{some kind}} of reform was {{obviously}} needed to contrast the criminal problems of the streets, nowadays critics believe that watchmen were actually vigorously engaged in catching offenders, and that their work might be concealed in the records because the official arrest would be recorded by the constable {{in charge of the}} watch. The Old Bailey Session Papers report many examples of watchmen being very capable and brave in confronting and arresting offenders.
