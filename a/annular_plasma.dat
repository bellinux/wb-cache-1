From the linearized fluid equations, the beam-sheath interaction is resolved into three coupled equations. The corresponding wakefield is computed and the asymptotic linear evolution is noted. For illustration, numerical examples are given for a plasma accelerator employing such a sheath.

A considerable number of microwave sources employ cylindrical waveguides, containing axis encircling electron beams. In these devices the <b>annular</b> <b>plasma</b> column interacts with the modes of empty waveguides, in which case they have {{been referred to as}} large-orbit gyrotrons, or with the azimuthally periodic wiggler magnetic field where they are called circular geometry free electron lasers. In either case, frequencies of the generated electromagnetic–electrostatic waves have been shown to have a strong dependence on the radii of coaxial waveguide and on relative positions of the inner and outer radii of the beam [5]. Analysis of the plasma waveguide requires knowledge of its eigenmodes. High-frequency eigenmodes of a magnetized plasma waveguide are characterized in four families, EH and HE waveguide modes, cyclotron modes, and space-charge modes.|$|E

A numerical investigation shows the existence of propagating slow modes, backward modes, a quasi-TEM mode, and waveguide-type modes in a magneto-plasma filled coaxial structure. Dispersion curves for these different modes are presented. Measurements have been made of electromagnetic propagation in a coaxial electrode structure filled with longitudinally magnetized plasma.

Using the slow wave approximation it had been predicted by Napoli and Swartz and Pinder and Foulds that such a structure should support a backward wave and that this backward wave would be virtually unaffected if the inner conductor is withdrawn. The exact analysis which is here reported shows that whilst the backward wave is present without the inner conductor {{it is no longer}} present when the inner conductor is inserted. The absence of the backward wave in the coaxial line was also shown by the experiment that was performed. The experiment was performed with a novel standing wave detector which was developed for this purpose. For the theoretical aspect of this work a technique for solving certain types of differential equations was developed. The theory when applied to a multi-layered model of a plasma also failed to show the presence of the backward wave for the coaxial line arrangement...|$|E

40|$|Spectral {{decomposition}} of dynamical equations using curl-eigenfunctions {{has been extensively}} used in fluid and plasma dynamics problems using their orthogonality and completeness properties for both linear and non-linear cases. Coefficients of such expansions are integrals over products of Bessel functions in problems involving cylindrical geometry. In this paper, certain identities involving products of two and three general solutions of Bessel's equation have been derived.

40|$|One-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamic {{simulations}} {{are performed}} to develop {{insight into the}} scaling of stagnation pressure with initial conditions of an imploding spherical plasma shell or "liner. " Simulations reveal the evolution of high-Mach-number (M), <b>annular,</b> spherical <b>plasma</b> flows during convergence, stagnation, shock formation, and disassembly, and indicate that cm- and μs-scale plasmas with peak pressures near 1 Mbar can be generated by liners with initial kinetic energy of several hundred kilo-joules. It is shown that radiation transport and thermal conduction must be included to avoid non-physical plasma temperatures at the origin which artificially limit liner convergence and thus the peak stagnation pressure. Scalings of the stagnated plasma lifetime (τstag) and average stagnation pressure (Pstag, the pressure at the origin, averaged over τstag) are determined by evaluating {{a wide range of}} liner initial conditions. For high-M flows, τstag L 0 /v 0, where L 0 and v 0 are the initial liner thickness and velocity, respectively. Furthermore, for argon liners, Pstag scales approximately as v 0 ^(15 / 4) over a wide range of initial densities (n 0), and as n 0 ^(1 / 2) over a wide range of v 0.

40|$|The {{results of}} an {{experimental}} study of an electrodeless electric propulsion device using electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) heating for plasma production are presented. The effects of pressure, propellant flow rate, and microwave input power on the plasma properties were examined. In addition, {{the effect of a}} magnetic nozzle on a plasma beam were examined experimentally and computationally. A laboratory ECR thruster was operated with argon propellant in a vacuum tank at pressures in the 10 (- 5) torr range using a 2. 115 GHz microwave beam at power levels up to several kilowatts. Several movable plasma diagnostics were used to measure the spatial variation of various plasma properties in the plume of the thruster. At low pressures, ion flux profiles showed an unexpected <b>annular</b> <b>plasma</b> plume with a depressed ion flux along the thruster axis. The ion energy measurements indicate that the ion kinetic energy is invariant with input microwave power. However, increases in pressure cause the plasma to lose kinetic energy due to friction with the background neutrals in the vacuum tank. Propulsion parameters were calculated from the ion flux and energy data. The results are greatly affected by additional ion flux due to entrainment of the background gas. The plasma potential and electron temperature both decreased with increasing pressure in the tank but were invariant with changes in microwave power. Microwave power reflected from and transmitted through the ECR region was measured and the results indicate that inefficient absorption may contribute significantly to energy losses in the laboratory device. Plasma detachment from the magnetic nozzle was identified as a critical issue for ECR and other applied-field thrusters. A collisionless model was used to calculate the trajectories of plasma rings in a magnetic nozzle. The code predicted that the plasma will detach under certain conditions and that the acceleration due to the force on the dipole moments of the electrons is inconsequential to the plasma trajectories. The radii of 90 ° deflection were calculated for several plasma initial conditions, and it was shown that the nozzle configuration can be manipulated to reduce beam divergence and increase the useful radius of the thruster. An attempt was made to experimentally examine detachment using an ion thruster in an applied magnetic nozzle. The magnetic field could then be varied independent of the ion energy. The grids of the thruster were masked to extract a thin ring of plasma coaxial with the magnetic nozzle, and the ion flux density profile was measured to determine the effect of the magnetic field on the trajectory of the <b>annular</b> <b>plasma.</b> A radial electric field was established in presence of the magnet nozzle that caused the annulus to spread and decrease in radius making detachment unobservable.

40|$|Abstract: Annular field {{reversed}} configuration (AFRC) devices form <b>annular</b> <b>plasma</b> toroids {{between a}} pair of concentric cylindrical coils. This plasmoid remains detached from the external magnetic field {{so that it can}} be ejected from the coils, making AFRCs vi-able pulsed inductive plasma accelerators. Though numerous formation studies on AFRCs are available, no successful translation studies have been published. Michigan Technolog-ical University, in conjunction with the Air Force Research Laboratory, is investigating the translation of AFRCs as pulsed inductive plasma accelerators. The first step in this investigation is to develop an annular electromagnetic launcher model to study the basic translation characteristics of the device. The launcher model treats the plasmoid as a rigid conducting slug, accelerated out of the coils by a Lorentz force. It predicts coil and plasmoid currents, plasmoid trajectories, and acceleration efficiencies for various input con-ditions. The model has been optimized for peak acceleration efficiency using a combination of non-dimensional analysis, genetic algorithms, and gradient-based numerical optimization routines. A description of the model, explanation of the numerical optimization techniques, and preliminary results from the model are presented in this paper.

40|$|Closed-Drift (Hall) {{thrusters}} {{constitute an}} important electric propulsion technol-ogy for certain applications requiring low thrust levels, e. g. satellite station keeping and orbit transfer (Gulczinski and Spores, 1996). The thrust in Hall thrusters {{is generated by}} ions being accelerated through an <b>annular</b> <b>plasma</b> by the electric eld set up between an anode and a cathode. This electric eld is strongly coupled to an externally applied radial magnetic eld which typically localizes the electric eld near the channel exit. The ions are generated through electron-impact ionization of Xenon neutrals. Due to their large inertia, the ions are not magnetized, and stream out of the device without experiencing very many collisions. The electrons, on the other hand, collide with the background neutrals as they migrate to the an-ode across the magnetic eld. The cathode is located a few centimeters downstream of the channel exit and provides enough electrons to supply much of the discharge current, ionize the incoming neutrals, and neutralize the beam of exiting ions. While the overall operational characteristics of Hall thrusters are understood, some key issues remain to be resolved. In particular, {{the relationship between the}} various types of fluctuations in these devices and the overall engine eciency needs to be determined. Electron conductivity is critical in the operation of Hall thrusters since it impacts the ionization of neutrals and the potential drop which accelerates the resulting ions. However, it’s expected (classical) value, arising from electron-neutral and Coulomb collisions, is far too low to account for the measured electron current (Morozov et al. 1972). Two mechanisms have been proposed to account for the enhanced electron transport (often termed ‘anomalous ’ in the plasma physics literature) : electron wall interactions and azimuthal fluctuations in electron density (Morozov et al. 1972). It is important that electron diusion be accurately modeled if the essential physics of the thruster are to be represented by one- or two-dimensional compu-tations. State of the art approaches (e. g. Fife et al. 1997) assume that the electron mobility is given by the ‘Bohm model’...|$|E

40|$|A new {{approach}} for the electromagnetic control and propulsion of a current carrying electric arc plasma ring is described. The {{essence of the}} approach is to form and manipulate the arc plasma outside rather than inside an electromagnetic field (B-field) producing coil so that pulsed plasma thrusts can be produced in a choice of different directions. The interaction of the electric arc, formed in atmospheric pressure air, with such B-field has been investigated. It {{has been shown that}} a stable azimuthal plasma ring can rapidly be produced by the simple process of separating two <b>annular</b> contacts. Pulsed <b>plasma</b> propulsion is obtained when the arc plasma, and B-field sustaining current is automatically reduced to zero, whereby the constraining electromagnetic forces are removed and, as a consequence, the resulting plasma ring radially expands outwards.

40|$|A magnetically conﬁned dc plasma {{discharge}} sustained by a thermionic source was investigated using a combined experimental and theoretical approach. The discharge originates {{in an arc}} plasma source and is expanded in a cylindrical chamber, where it is stabilized by an <b>annular</b> anode. The <b>plasma</b> expansion is contained by an axial magnetic ﬁeld generated by coils positioned {{at the top and}} the bottom of the reactor. The plasma reactor design allows control of the energy of ions impinging on the substrate and thus a high electron density of about 1017 m− 3 at 1 Pa can be reached. The plasma is studied using a model composed of the Poisson and of the charged species continuity equations, solved in the ﬂow and temperature ﬁelds determined by solving the Navier–Stokes and Fourier equations. The model equations are integrated using the ﬁnite element method in a two-dimensional axial symmetric domain. Ionization rates are either assumed constant or determined by solving the Boltzmann transport equation in the local electric ﬁeld with the Monte Carlo ͑MC͒ method. Electron and ion transport parameters are determined by accounting for magnetic conﬁnement through a simpliﬁed solution of the ion and electron momentum conservation equations, which yielded parameters in good agreement with those determined with the MC simulations. Calculated electron densities and plasma potentials were satisfactorily compared to those measured using a Langmuir probe. The model demonstrates that the intensity of the magnetic ﬁeld greatly inﬂuences the electron density, so that a decrease by a factor of 2 in its intensity corresponds to a decrease by almost an order of magnitude of the electron and ion concentrations...|$|R
40|$|Stability and {{efficiency}} are two fundamental requirements for any component {{to be used}} in space applications, and electric thrusters are no exception. This Thesis consists of two parts, each of which addresses a topic concerning the two cited aspects. In the first part we investigate an unstable operating regime of a specific class of high-power plasma thrusters, the magnetoplasmadynamic (MPD) thrusters. These thrusters potentially offer unique values of thrust density and specific impulse which make them suitable for space missions in which both mass savings and mission duration are a concern. The operation of these devices is strongly limited by the inception of the cited critical phenomenon, which is known simply as "onset" in the literature. Despite the onset regime has been extensively investigated, with both theoretical and experimental approaches, a complete and clear theoretical framework in which to fit all the experimental results is still missing. To this scope we first start with a detailed and critical review of the last 50 years of research on the topic, aiming at providing a classification of the main results starting from the different thruster configurations. The main contribution of the first part is then the development of a complete and physically plausible theory in which we provide explanations for the different aspects of the onset phenomenology in self-field MPD thrusters. We address the problem of the breaking of the azimuthal symmetry of the discharge, explaining the underlying physical mechanism and providing a quantitative criterion for this to occur. We then show that this azimuthal instability is also {{at the base of the}} formation of the filamentary plasma structures which have been observed in experimental investigations. The nature of the unstable dynamics of these filaments is then addressed and finally we propose a mechanism which explains the connection between the plasma dynamics and the electrical response of the thruster. We conclude the first part by looking at possible design choices which could help improve the stability of these devices. Among others, particular attention is given to an alternative concept developed by A. I. Morozov, the Quasi-Steady Plasma Accelerator, which requires a staging strategy in which the ionization of the propellant is separated from the acceleration phase. A technical solution for the implementation of this concept in MPD thrusters would be the development of an efficient <b>annular</b> <b>plasma</b> source. In the second part of this work we focus on the possibility of developing an annular helicon plasma source. Helicon sources have undergone a rapid diffusion in practically all the branches of research on low-temperature plasmas, as a consequence of their simplicity and potentially high ionization efficiency. The use of these sources as ionization stages in high-power plasma thrusters can potentially lead to an increase of the overall efficiency of the device and contribute to widen its operational envelope, as well as help in creating favorable conditions for stable operation. The goal of this work is to provide a basis of knowledge to help and guide future developments and designs of this kind of sources. First we investigate the problem of the excitation and propagation of helicon waves, which are bounded modes of whistler waves, in an annularly bounded homogeneous plasma. Finite electron mass effects and all possible combinations of boundary conditions are included in the study, for which closed form analytical solutions are provided. A parametric analysis of the solution as a function of the main driving parameters is performed. The problem of the radial equilibrium of a magnetized plasma in annular configurations is then addressed. By making use of a two-fluid model in a non-dimensional form, the most important parameters affecting both the plasma equilibrium and the wall losses are illustrated. As a result of a parametric study, the interplay between magnetic confinement and collisional effects is stressed to be the most important mechanism, and the effects induced by other parameters such as a finite ion temperature, plasma beta and geometry of the source are illustrated. Given the relative importance of collisional effects in the radial equilibrium problem, in which neutral particles can play a major role at low ionization levels, we then report the results of a joint experimental and numerical activity aiming at the validation of a procedure that allows to calculate the neutral particle background in a helicon source. The results of this activity also give indication of a possible role played by the propellant injection system in the neutral pumping phenomenon, which is known to be a potential limiting factor of the efficiency of these devices. The last part of the thesis concerns an experimental activity carried on an annular helicon source. This activity involved designing and building both the plasma source and a diagnostics setup to perform optical emission spectroscopy measurements. The setup allowed to perform scans of the light emitted by the plasma through a cross section of the device in between adjacent magnets. The occurrence of some calibration issues of the spectrometer did not allow for a quantitative estimate of the plasma parameters (electron temperature and number density), but the recorded spectra give indication of an inductive coupling mode of the source with the RF antenna. Taking into account the results of the model on the radial equilibrium, it is likely that the plasma in the source was collision-dominated. Finally, the linear scans of the emitted light are not in general axi-symmetric, which is not expected given the nominal symmetry of the source, thus indicating the possibility that asymmetric equilibria might exist in these sources...|$|E
