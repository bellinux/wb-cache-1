5|$|After trucks {{became popular}} in the 1910s, the Omaha Stockyards grew exponentially. Cattle, hogs <b>and</b> <b>sheep</b> were shipped cheaper by truck than by trains. In 1919 27% of {{livestock}} at the Stockyards was shipped by truck; by 1940's it rose to over 75%. In 1955 the Stockyards became the biggest livestock distribution center in the United States, {{and almost all of}} the cattle was shipped by truck.|$|E

5|$|In ancient Egypt, cattle {{were the}} most {{important}} livestock, <b>and</b> <b>sheep,</b> goats, and pigs were also kept; poultry including ducks, geese, and pigeons were captured in nets and bred on farms, where they were force-fed with dough to fatten them. The Nile provided a plentiful source of fish. Honey bees were domesticated from at least the Old Kingdom, providing both honey and wax.|$|E
5|$|It was a mad waste. The colonists {{in their}} greed for more grass seed <b>and</b> <b>sheep</b> pasture burned {{millions}} of pounds worth of timber. They recklessly destroyed the wonderful {{beauty of the}} bush, baring the soil until it was carried away by landslides, and lowered the rainfall, and laid waste the homes of countless sweet songsters.|$|E
5|$|Many {{places in}} Norway farms also {{maintained}} mountain farms (seter/støl), where cows, goats, <b>and</b> <b>sheep</b> would put out to pasture {{during the summer}} months. These would typically include a small dwelling house and a dairy for making and storing cheese, sour cream, etc.|$|E

5|$|Phylogenetically Capricornis {{is closer}} to goats <b>and</b> <b>sheep</b> than cattle. The {{nomenclature}} and status of Capricornis taxa are not completely resolved.

Capricornis has a lower canine, which Naemorhedus species usually do not.|$|E
5|$|The local Biodiversity Action Plan {{recommends}} {{land management}} measures {{to control the}} spread of ragwort and bracken and identifies four non-native, invasive species as threatening native biodiversity: Japanese knotweed, rhododendron, New Zealand flatworm and mink.

5|$|According to the Long Life, Ajtony's {{seat was}} a stronghold on the Mureș (urbs Morisena).

Ajtony was a wealthy ruler who owned horses, cattle <b>and</b> <b>sheep,</b> and was powerful enough to establish customs offices and guards along the Mureș and tax salt carried to Stephen I of Hungary on the river.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture, and to {{a lesser}} extent forestry, are the main sources of income over most of the county of Carmarthenshire. On {{improved}} pastures, dairying is important and in the past, the presence of the railway enabled milk to be transported to the urban areas of England. The creamery at Whitland is now closed but milk processing still takes place at Newcastle Emlyn where mozzarella cheese is made. On upland pastures and marginal land, livestock rearing of cattle <b>and</b> <b>sheep</b> is the main agricultural activity. The estuaries of the Loughor and Towy provide pickings for the cockle industry.|$|E

5|$|Anecdotal {{evidence}} suggests that the plant may be mildly toxic. The noxious odours have been associated with nausea and headaches, as well as with contact dermatitis reported in both humans <b>and</b> <b>sheep,</b> who also developed weakness and paralysis. It contains a quinone irritant, 2,6-dimethoxybenzoquinone, as well as active quassinoids (ailanthone itself being one) which may account for these effects, but they have, however, proved difficult or impossible to reproduce in humans and goats. In one trial a tincture from the blossom and foliage caused nausea, vomiting and muscular relaxation.|$|E
5|$|Australia and New Zealand {{are crucial}} {{players in the}} {{contemporary}} sheep industry, <b>and</b> <b>sheep</b> are an iconic part of both countries' culture and economy. New Zealand has the highest density of sheep per capita (sheep outnumber the human population 12 to 1), and Australia is the world's indisputably largest exporter of sheep and cattle. In 2007, New Zealand even declared 15 February their official National Lamb Day to celebrate the country's history of sheep production.|$|E
5|$|Deptford Dockyard was {{established}} in 1513 by Henry VIII as the first Royal Dockyard, building vessels for the Royal Navy, and was at one time known as the King's Yard. It was shut down from 1830 to 1844 before being closed as a dockyard in 1869, and is currently known as Convoys Wharf. From 1871 until the First World War it was the City of London Corporation's Foreign Cattle Market.

40|$|The {{content of}} hippuric acid in raw goat's <b>and</b> <b>sheep's</b> milk <b>and</b> {{the content of}} benzoic acid in model {{fermented}} milk drinks prepared using different cultures of bacteria of milk fermentation were determined. All fermented milk drinks contained benzoic acid in the range 5. 0 - 78 mg kg- 1. Higher quantity of benzoic acid in fermented sheep's milk drinks corresponded also to significantly higher quantity of hippuric acid in raw sheep's milk. No significant differences among used cultures of bacteria of dairy fermentation and the quantity of benzoic acid in fermented milk drinks were recorded. In addition, the quantity of benzoic acid in various commercial goat's <b>and</b> <b>sheep's</b> cheeses produced directly in farms was analyzed. The contents of benzoic acid in cheeses ranged from 5. 1 to 90 mg kg- 1. No {{significant difference in the}} quantity of benzoic acid from goat's <b>and</b> <b>sheep's</b> cheeses was found, whereas significant differences were registered in the quantity of benzoic acid in cheeses produced in individual farms...|$|R
