40|$|A basic {{question}} in adeno-associated virus (AAV) biology has been whether adenovirus (<b>Ad)</b> <b>infection</b> provided any function which directly promoted replication of AAV DNA. Previously in vitro assays for AAV DNA replication, using linear duplex AAV DNA as the template, uninfected or Ad-infected HeLa cell extracts, and exogenous AAV Rep protein, demonstrated that <b>Ad</b> <b>infection</b> provides <b>a</b> direct helper effect for AAV DNA replication. It was {{shown that the}} nature of this helper effect was to increase the processivity of AAV DNA replication. Left unanswered was the question of whether this effect was the result of cellular factors whose activity was enhanced by <b>Ad</b> <b>infection</b> or was the result of direct participation of Ad proteins in AAV DNA replication. In this report, we show that in the in vitro assay, enhancement of processivity occurs with the addition of either the Ad DNA-binding protein (Ad-DBP) or the human single-stranded DNA-binding protein (replication protein A [RPA]). Clearly Ad-DBP is present after <b>Ad</b> <b>infection</b> but not before, whereas the cellular level of RPA is not apparently affected by <b>Ad</b> <b>infection.</b> However, we have not measured possible modifications of RPA which might occur after <b>Ad</b> <b>infection</b> and affect AAV DNA replication. When the substrate for replication was an AAV genome inserted into a plasmid vector, RPA was not an effective substitute for Ad-DBP. Extracts supplemented with Ad-DBP preferentially replicated AAV sequences rather than adjacent vector sequences; in contrast, extracts supplemented with RPA preferentially replicated vector sequences...|$|R

40|$|Adenovirus (<b>Ad)</b> <b>infection</b> {{has been}} {{identified}} as predisposing hosts to the development of pulmonary disease through unknown mechanisms. Lung dendritic cells (DCs) are vital for initiating pulmonary immune responses; however, the effects of <b>Ad</b> <b>infection</b> on primary lung DC have not been studied. In contrast to the effects on bone marrow- and monocyte-derived DCs, the current study shows that <b>Ad</b> <b>infection</b> of murine BALB/c lung DCs in vitro and in vivo suppresses DC-induced T-cell proliferation. The effect of Ad on DCs was not due to a downregulation of major histocompatibility complex or costimulatory molecules. Analysis of the production of interleukin- 12 (IL- 12), alpha interferon (IFN-α), and IFN-γ by the Ad-infected DCs shows no significant differences over noninfected control lung DCs. Ad-induced suppression was not due to a deficiency of IL- 2 or other DC-secreted factors and was dependent on viral protein synthesis, as UV irradiation of Ad abrogated the suppressive effect. Results suggest that Ad-infected DCs induce T cells to be nonresponsive to IL- 2 during primary coculture, as the addition of IL- 2 in secondary cultures recovered T-cell proliferation. In vivo studies supported in vitro results showing that <b>Ad</b> <b>infection</b> resulted in lung T cells with decreased proliferative ability.

40|$|Background: We have {{recently}} reported {{the presence of}} Human herpesvirus- 6 A (HHV- 6 A) DNA in the 43 % of endometrial epithelial cells from primary idiopathic infertile women, with no positivity in fertile women. To investigate the possible effect of HHV- 6 <b>A</b> <b>infection</b> in endometrial (e) NK cells functions, we examined activating/inhibitory receptors expressed by eNK cells and the corresponding ligands on endometrial cells during HHV- 6 <b>A</b> <b>infection.</b> Methods: Endometrial biopsies and uterine flushing samples during the secretory phase were obtained from 20 idiopathic infertile women and twenty fertile women. HHV- 6 <b>A</b> <b>infection</b> of endometrial epithelial cells was analyzed by Real-Time PCR, immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. eNKs receptors and endometrial ligands expression were evaluated by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. Results: We observed the presence of HHV- 6 <b>A</b> <b>infection</b> (DNA, protein) of endometrial epithelial cells in the 40 % of idiopathic infertile women. The eNK from all the subgroups expressed high levels of NKG 2 D and NKG 2 A receptors. Functional studies showed that NKG 2 D activating receptor and FasL {{are involved in the}} acquired cytotoxic function of eNK cells during HHV- 6 <b>A</b> <b>infection</b> of endometrial epithelial cells. In the presence of HHV- 6 <b>A</b> <b>infection,</b> eNK cells increased expression of CCR 2, CXCR 3 and CX 3 CR 1 chemokine receptors (p = 0. 01) and endometrial epithelial cells up-modulated the corresponding ligands: MCP 1 (Monocyte chemotactic protein 1, CCL 2), IP- 10 (Interferon gamma-induced protein 10, CXCL 10) and Eotaxin- 3 (CCL 26). Conclusion: Our results, for the first time, showed the implication of eNK cells in controlling HHV- 6 <b>A</b> endometrial <b>infection</b> and clarify the mechanisms that might be implicated in female idiopathic infertility...|$|R

40|$|BackgroundThe {{seroprevalence}} and seroincidence {{of novel}} influenza <b>A</b> <b>infection</b> among HIV-infected patients, who {{were believed to}} have more severe outcomes than healthy individuals, are rarely investigated {{in the era of}} highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Our aim was to determine the seroprevalence and seroincidence of novel influenza <b>A</b> <b>infection</b> among HIV-infected patients in Taiwan. MethodsBetween September and November 2009, before the implementation of a nationwide vaccination for novel influenza A in Taiwan, 931 HIV-infected patients and 566 persons seeking voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) for HIV infection at our university hospital were enrolled in this study. Antibody responses to novel influenza A were determined using a hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) assay. ResultsHIV-infected patients had a significantly lower seroprevalence of novel influenza <b>A</b> <b>infection</b> than VCT clients (14. 7 % vs. 33. 9 %, p <  0. 001). The seroincidence of novel influenza <b>A</b> <b>infection</b> among HIV-infected patients was 9. 4 % (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 7. 6 – 11. 4). On the multivariate analysis, heterosexual (odds ratio [OR]: 1. 89; 95 % CI: 1. 105 – 3. 227) and baseline HI titer (OR: 1. 02; 95 % CI: 1. 001 – 1. 038) were significantly associated with seroconversion to novel influenza A virus. ConclusionHIV-infected patients demonstrated a lower seroprevalence of novel influenza <b>A</b> <b>infection</b> than HIV-uninfected patients in Taiwan in the HAART era.
