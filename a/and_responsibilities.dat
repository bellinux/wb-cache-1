40|$|Business {{activity}} {{can be analyzed}} through a “risk awareness” perspective and a “responsibility awareness” perspective. However, risk <b>and</b> <b>responsibility</b> are actually interdependent. Risk‐taking triggers <b>responsibility</b> issues <b>and</b> taking <b>responsibility</b> means risking being asked critical questions. This paper suggests some first steps for combining these two perspectives conceptually. After several introductory illustrations showing how risk <b>and</b> <b>responsibility</b> issues are intertwined, the paper looks separately each at risk <b>and</b> at <b>responsibility.</b> Then the argument that such perspectives could be usefully combined is elaborated further from a theoretical angle and from a practical angle, by looking at various ethical issues and by presenting paradigmatic examples of balancing or sharing risk <b>and</b> <b>responsibility</b> related to leadership, to ERM and to insurance...|$|R

40|$|The Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) in the US and the Single European Sky Air Traffic Management (ATM) Research (SESAR) {{program in}} Europe are redefining ATM, {{allowing}} for transformative new concepts of operation that may radically re-allocate authority <b>and</b> <b>responsibility</b> between air <b>and</b> ground. There {{is a need}} for methods that can systematically incorporate innovative allocations of authority <b>and</b> <b>responsibility</b> in the design of novel concepts of operations to enable them to meet their specified performance and safety goals. This need translates to two objectives: 1) Create the methodology and tools for analysis of allocation of authority <b>and</b> <b>responsibility</b> in novel air traffic concepts of operation, and 2) Create the methodology and tools for synthesis of allocation of authority <b>and</b> <b>responsibility</b> in novel air traffic concepts of operation. This thesis first establishes concrete definitions of capability, authority <b>and</b> <b>responsibility</b> in the context of function allocations in the design of concepts of operations. Then, it addresses the first objective by proposing a computational modeling and simulation methodology to assess allocations of authority <b>and</b> <b>responsibility</b> with respect to the performance and safety goals of the concept of operations. Subsequently, it addresses the second objective by proposing a methodology based on network modeling and optimization to systematically synthesize allocations of authority under specified allocations of responsibility to meet performance and safety goals. The proposed methodologies are demonstrated on a case study designing of allocations of authority <b>and</b> <b>responsibility</b> in aircraft merging and spacing operations during arrival. The methodologies described and demonstrated in this thesis can be used by designers of concept of operations to both analyze and synthesize allocations of authority <b>and</b> <b>responsibility.</b> Further, the results of the case study can inform the design of similar concepts of operations.
