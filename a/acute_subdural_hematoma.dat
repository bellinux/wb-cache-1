40|$|Abstract Introduction Symptomatic {{subdural}} hematoma {{development is}} a constant concern for patients who have undergone cerebrospinal fluid shunting procedures to relieve symptoms related to normal-pressure hydrocephalus. Acute subdural hematomas are of particular concern in these patients as even minor head trauma may result in subdural hematoma formation. The presence of a ventricular shunt facilitates further expansion of the subdural hematoma and often necessitates surgical treatment, including subdural hematoma evacuation and shunt ligation. Case presentation We present {{the case of a}} 63 -year-old North American Caucasian man with normal-pressure hydrocephalus with an adjustable valve ventriculoperitoneal shunt who developed an <b>acute</b> <b>subdural</b> <b>hematoma</b> after sustaining head trauma. Conservative treatment was favored over operative evacuation because our patient was neurologically intact, but simple observation was considered to be too high risk in the setting of a low-pressure ventriculoperitoneal shunt. Thus, the valve setting on the ventriculoperitoneal shunt was increased to its maximum pressure setting in order to reduce flow through the shunt and to mildly increase intracranial pressure in an attempt to tamponade any active bleeding and limit hematoma expansion. A repeat computed tomography scan of the head six days after the valve adjustment revealed complete resolution of the <b>acute</b> <b>subdural</b> <b>hematoma.</b> At this time, the valve pressure was reduced to its original setting to treat symptoms of normal-pressure hydrocephalus. Conclusions Programmable shunt valves afford the option for non-operative management of <b>acute</b> <b>subdural</b> <b>hematoma</b> in patients with ventricular shunts for normal-pressure hydrocephalus. As illustrated in this case report, increasing the shunt valve pressure may result in rapid resolution of the <b>acute</b> <b>subdural</b> <b>hematoma</b> in some patients. </p...|$|E
