5|$|A {{study in}} 2009 of seven {{mitochondrial}} genes (mtDNA) and three nuclear genes grouped fork-marked lemurs with sportive lemurs (family Lepilemuridae), offering {{a host of}} explanations, such as a possible hybridization (introgression) following the initial split between the families. A study published in 2013 also grouped fork-marked lemurs with sportive lemurs when it used 43morphological traits and mtDNA. If correct, this would make the family Cheirogaleidae paraphyletic. Broad agreement between two lemur phylogeny studies—one in 2004 using SINE analysis and another in 2012 using multilocus phylogenetic tests—gave strong support for a sister group relationship between fork-marked lemurs <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the cheirogaleids and a more distant relationship with sportive lemurs. The split between Phaner <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the cheirogaleids {{is thought to have}} occurred approximately 38mya (million years ago), not long after the radiation of most of the major lemur groups on Madagascar, roughly 43mya.|$|E

During the overhaul, on 8 March, the ship was assigned to the 3rd Division, 1st Squadron. After emerging from the dry dock, she resumed her normal peacetime routine of maneuvers {{with the rest of the}} squadron, gunnery practice, and training cruises. In February 1910 she was sent on a cruise in the Caribbean. The ship was reassigned to the 4th Division, 1st Squadron on 20 October, and two weeks later she <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the squadron held a naval review in Boston for President William Howard Taft on 2 November. The ships then crossed the Atlantic to visit European ports; Rhode Island went to Gravesend. During the cruise, the fleet conducted large scale battle and reconnaissance training.

The operation lasted until 9 September and failed to bring Russian naval units to battle. The squadron participated in a demonstration off Windau the next day.

Cleomenes ordered his army to take five days' worth of rations and sent his troops toward Sellasia, to {{give the appearance of}} raiding the territory of Argos. From there he went to the territory of Megalopolis; during the night he ordered one of his friends, Panteus, to capture the weakest section of the walls, while Cleomenes <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the army followed.
