25|$|Antianxiety agents (benzodiazepines): Use of benzodiazepines for panic {{disorder}} is controversial with opinion differing {{in the medical}} literature. The American Psychiatric Association states that benzodiazepines can be effective {{for the treatment of}} {{panic disorder}} and recommends that the choice of whether to use benzodiazepines, antidepressants with <b>anti-panic</b> properties or psychotherapy should be based on the individual patient's history and characteristics. Other experts believe that benzodiazepines are best avoided due to the risks of the development of tolerance and physical dependence. The World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry, say that benzodiazepines should not be used as a first-line treatment option but are an option for treatment-resistant cases of panic disorder. Despite increasing focus on the use of antidepressants and other agents for the treatment of anxiety as recommended best practice, benzodiazepines have remained a commonly used medication for panic disorder. They reported that in their view there is insufficient evidence to recommend one treatment over another for panic disorder. The APA noted that while benzodiazepines have the advantage of a rapid onset of action, that this is offset by the risk of developing a benzodiazepine dependence. The National Institute of Clinical Excellence came to a different conclusion, they pointed out the problems of using uncontrolled clinical trials to assess the effectiveness of pharmacotherapy and based on placebo-controlled research they concluded that benzodiazepines were not effective in the long-term for panic disorder and recommended that benzodiazepines not be used for longer than 4 weeks for panic disorder. Instead NICE clinical guidelines recommend alternative pharmacotherapeutic or psychotherapeutic interventions.|$|E
2500|$|Treatment {{of panic}} {{disorder}} with sertraline {{results in a}} decrease {{of the number of}} panic attacks and an improved quality of life. In four double-blind studies sertraline was shown to be superior to placebo for the treatment of panic disorder. The response rate was independent of the dose. In addition to decreasing the frequency of panic attacks by about 80% (vs. 45% for placebo) and decreasing general anxiety, sertraline resulted in improvement of quality of life on most parameters.

50|$|Emapunil (AC-5216, XBD-173) is an {{anxiolytic}} drug {{which acts}} as a selective agonist at the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor, {{also known as the}} mitochondrial 18 kDa translocator protein or TSPO. This protein has multiple functions, among which is regulation of steroidogenesis, particularly the production of neuroactive steroids such as allopregnanolone in the brain. In both animal and human trials, emapunil produced fast acting anxiolytic and <b>anti-panic</b> effects, without producing sedation or withdrawal symptoms following cessation of use. Emapunil is also used in its 11C radiolabelled form to map the distribution of TSPO receptors in the brain.|$|E
50|$|Much {{research}} has been done in isolating and understanding the effective aspects of A. vicina venom. A recent study involving Wistar rats involved isolating the neurotoxin AvTx8 and then microinjecting it into the brains of rats to understand its effect on brain activity. It was found that the neurotoxin has effects on GABAergic neurotransmission, increasing the activity of specific inhibitory pathways. By doing so, it reduces defensive behavior in rats by propagating an <b>anti-panic</b> effect. The study suggests that AcTx8, as well as many of the other chemicals found in A. vicina venom, may be used to study mechanisms of the brain and brainstem networks.|$|E

40|$|Experimental panic {{provocation}} {{in healthy}} man—a translational role in <b>anti-panic</b> drug development? Michael Kellner, MD, PhD Experimental provocation of panic attacks in panic disorder patients Experimental neurochemical provocation of panic attacks in susceptible human subjects has considerably expanded {{our knowledge of}} the pathophysiology and psychopharmacology of panic disorder. Some panicogens also elicit short-lived panic-like states in healthy man. This offers the opportunity to assess the <b>anti-panic</b> action of drugs in proof-of-concept studies. However, from current data it is still unclear whether experimental panic in healthy man is a valid translational model. Most such studies in healthy volunteers have been performed using a cholecystokinin tetrapeptide (CCK- 4) challenge. While CCK- 4 panic was blocked by alprazolam pretreatment, escitalopram showed negative results in healthy man.

40|$|Rats {{with chronic}} {{inhibition}} of GABA synthesis by infusion of l-allyglycine, a {{glutamic acid decarboxylase}} inhibitor, into their dorsomedial/perifornical hypothalamus are anxious and exhibit panic-like cardio-respiratory responses to treatment with intravenous (i. v.) sodium lactate (NaLac) infusions, {{in a manner similar}} to what occurs in patients with panic disorder. We previously showed that either NMDA receptor antagonists or metabotropic glutamate receptor type 2 / 3 receptor agonists can block such a NaLac response, suggesting that a glutamate mechanism is contributing to this panic-like state. Using this animal model of panic, we tested the efficacy of CBiPES and THIIC, which are selective group II metabotropic glutamate type 2 receptor allosteric potentiators (at 10 - 30 mg/kg i. p.), in preventing NaLac-induced panic-like behavioral and cardiovascular responses. The positive control was alprazolam (3 mg/kg i. p.), a clinically effective <b>anti-panic</b> benzodiazepine. As predicted, panic-prone rats given a NaLac challenge displayed NaLac-induced panic-like cardiovascular (i. e. tachycardia and hypertensive) responses and "anxiety" (i. e. decreased social interaction time) and "flight" (i. e. increased locomotion) -associated behaviors; however, systemic injection of the panic-prone rats with CBiPES, THIIC or alprazolam prior to the NaLac dose blocked all NaLac-induced panic-like behaviors and cardiovascular responses. These data suggested that in a rat animal model, selective group II metabotropic glutamate type 2 receptor allosteric potentiators show an <b>anti-panic</b> efficacy similar to alprazolam...|$|E
40|$|The anxiety syndrom "panic disorder" is at {{the moment}} subject of {{intensive}} biological psychiatrical research. The syndrom consists of panic attacks (intense fear) with several somatic symptoms (dizziness, palpitations, hyperventilation). Most patients develop some degree of anticipatory anxiety (i. e. fear of having anothe'r panic attack). A number of panic disorder patients develop agoraphobic symptoms. These symptoms may be described as fear {{to be in a}} situation in which no help is present if something (e. g. a panic attack) happens to the patient. It has been described that panic anxiety is benzodiazepine resistant (Sheehan (1982), McNair and Kahn (1981)), but anti-depressants have been shown to have <b>anti-panic</b> properties (Klein (1967), Zitrin et al (1978)). The therapeutic efficacy seems to correlate with the reuptake inhibition of serotonin (5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT)) (Den Boer (1988)). The· triazolobenzodiazepine alprazolam has also a beneficial effect in panic disorder (Ballenger et al (1988)). It is less known that the GABAB receptor agonist baclofen also possesses <b>anti-panic</b> properties (Pepplinkhuizen and Bruinvels (1978), Breslow et al. (1989)). In order to investigate the mechanism responsible for the anxiolytic effect of baclofen, an animal behavioural model has been developed in which this compound is effective. Chapter I reviews the literature on the GABA-ergic system, 5 -HT system, the involvement of several neurotransmitters in anxiety, various animal models for anxiety and panic disorder. The aim of the experiments was to investigate the relationship between baclofen on one hand, and the GABAAjbenzodiazepine receptor chloride channel complex and the 5 -HT system on the other hand, using extinction of conflict behaviour as a tool. The Chapters II to V describe the experiments which try to shed more light on two possible mechanisms, namely GABAA and/or 5 -HT involvement, by which baclofen might mediate its effect on extinction of conflict behaviour...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Adeficiency ofmost current drug {{products}} {{for treatment of}} acute conditions is slow onset of action. A promising means of accelerating drug action is through rapid systemic drug administration via deep lung inhalation. The speed of pulmonary drug absorption depends {{on the site of}} aerosol deposition within the lung and the dissolution rate and drug content of the deposited particles. Alveolar delivery of fast-dissolving, pure drug particles should in theory enable very rapid absorption. We have previously shown that heating of thin drug films generates vapor-phase drug that subsequently cools and condenses into pure drug particles of optimal size for alveolar delivery. Here we present a hand held, disposable, breath-actuated device incorporating this thermal aerosol technology, and its application to the delivery of alprazolam, an <b>anti-panic</b> agent, and prochlorperazine, an anti-emetic with recently discovered anti-migraine properties. Thermal aerosol particles of these drugs exist in an amorphous state, which results in remarkably rapid drug absorption from the lung into the systemic circulation, with peak left ventricular concentrations achieved within 20 s, even quicker than following rapid (5 s) intravenous infusion. Absorption of the thermal aerosol is nearly complete, with> 80 % absolute bioavailability found in both dogs and huma...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the effects of acute exercise on anxiogenic responding to 65 % O- 2 / 35 % CO 2 challenge. Participants (N = 92) were 51 female and 41 male volunteers ranging in age from 17 to 24 (M = 19. 43, SD = 1. 31). Participants had no history of panic attacks and were randomized to moderate treadmill exercise (i. e., 70 % of HRmax) or quiet rest prior to taking a single vital capacity inhalation of 35 % CO 2 / 65 % O- 2. Gender and measures of negative affectivity and anxiety sensitivity were included in the design as control variables. Results indicated participants who exercised prior to challenge showed significantly reduced reactivity compared to their counterparts who rested prior to challenge. Importantly, the effect sizes for the advantage of exercise over rest remained in the medium to large range (i. e., partial eta(2) >. 07) after controlling for the effects of gender, anxiety sensitivity, and negative affectivity. These findings are the first to demonstrate that the <b>anti-panic</b> effects of exercise are unique from, and cannot be better explained by, established risk factors of CO 2 challenge reactivity...|$|E
40|$|AIMS: 1. To {{verify the}} {{sensibility}} of panic patients to {{a mixture of}} 35 % CO 2 and 65 % O 2. 2. To determine if a ten days treatment with clonazepam attenuates the panic attacks induced by the inhalation of 35 % carbon dioxide in panic disorder. METHOD: We randomly selected six panic disorder subjects, using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. All subjects went double-blindly through an inhalation of 35 % CO 2 and compressed gas (atmospheric air) on two occasions. First, at baseline, when they were drug free. Second, after a 10 days clonazepam treatment. RESULTS: Neither at baseline nor after treatment any patient had a panic attack during compressed gas inhalation. At the first test five patients (83. 3 %) had a severe panic attack {{with high levels of}} subjective anxiety during carbon dioxide inhalation. After 9. 6 (± 3. 4) days of clonazepam treatment, only two (33. 3 %) patients experienced a mild panic attack. CONCLUSION: This pilot study suggests the efficacy of the short term clonazepam therapy in attenuating panic attacks and supports the usefulness of the 35 % carbon dioxide challenge test as an analogue method for study the efficacy of <b>anti-panic</b> drugs. Further placebo-controlled studies to pharmacological treatment are warranted...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} is aimed at characterizing the carbon dioxide (CO 2) {{procedure}} in healthy subjects to achieve reliable provocation of anxiety symptoms. Thirty healthy subjects inhaled in single-blind both compressed air and 7 % CO 2 mixture. Panic Symptom List (PSLIII-R), Visual Analogue Scale-Anxiety (VAS-A), State Anxiety Inventory (STAI-Y/ 1), respiratory parameters and skin conductance were measured. 'Responders' were classified depending on PSLIII-R scores after CO 2. Twelve out of the 21 'responders' performed a second test to assess test-retest repeatability. In 21 subjects Delta%VAS-A (45. 4 +/- 32. 1) and PSLIII-R (pre-test 2. 3 +/- 2. 1, post-test 17. 5 +/- 8. 2) but not STAI-Y/ 1, significantly increased during CO 2 inhalation. Respiratory Rate, Minute Volume, end-Tidal CO 2 and skin conductance rose in 'responders'. Repeatability was studied with Bland-Altman plots, revealing mean difference between tests close to 0 for both Delta%VAS-A and PSLIII-R. Among physiologic parameters, end-Tidal CO 2 and Respiratory Rate showed good repeatability, with a within-subject CV of 9. 2 % and 6 %, respectively. The challenge produced measurable response in healthy subjects. Good test-retest repeatability was observed in 'responders'. These data indicate that the test can be suitable for testing putative <b>anti-panic</b> or anxiolytic drugs in clinical studies using a within subject, crossover design...|$|E

40|$|Introduction Adult Separation Anxiety Disorder (ASAD) {{is related}} to greater {{personal}} dysfunction and to a reduced sensitivity to conventional treatment, such as cognitive-behavioural therapy or <b>anti-panic</b> drugs, even considering severity of anxiety symptoms, number of co-morbid disorders, socioeconomical status, disease duration, and severity of agoraphobia. Objectives To evaluate separation anxiety, psychiatric co-morbidity, levels of anxiety, character and temperament personality traits, and global functioning, in subjects with anxiety disorders attending a tertiary-level outpatient clinic. Aims To predict the outcome and customize treatment for anxiety disorders. Methods After symptom stabilization of one month (T 0) 40 patients with anxiety disorders were assessed by means of SCI- SAS, SASI, ASA - 27, MINI, HAM- A, TCI-R, GAF. Prospective evaluation is planned at T 60 and T 180. Results According to preliminary cross-sectional data, higher scores of separation anxiety show statistically significant correlations with some domains of the TCI-R; in addition, patients with ASAD show greater psychiatric co-morbidity. No correlations {{were found between the}} presence of separation anxiety and levels of anxiety at HAM-A or GAF scores at baseline. Conclusions The prospective study of long-term response to treatment is ongoing and the sample will be expanded. The comprehension of anxiety symptoms appraisal in the framework of psychobiological personality characteristics is expected to influence the choice of both pharmacological and psychological therapeutic tools, particularly in patients showing higher levels of dysfunction.

40|$|Chronic {{administration}} of antidepressants such as fluoxetine and imipramine increases the responsiveness of 5 -HT(1 A) receptors in dorsal {{periaqueductal grey matter}} (DPAG), a midbrain area consistently implicated in the pathogenesis of panic disorder. This effect has been related to the clinically relevant <b>anti-panic</b> action of these drugs. In this study we determined whether long-term {{administration of}} fluoxetine also affects 5 -HT efflux in DPAG. As a comparison, the effect of chronic treatment with the anxiolytic 5 -HT(1 A) receptor agonist buspirone on DPAG 5 -HT levels was assessed. We also investigated whether the inhibitory effect of chronic fluoxetine on escape behaviour in the rat elevated T-maze, considered as a panicolytic-like effect, is counteracted by intra-DPAG injection of the 5 -HT(1 A) receptor antagonist WAY 100635. Male Wistar rats were treated (1 or 21 d, i. p.) with fluoxetine, buspirone or vehicle, once daily. After treatment, 5 -HT in DPAG was measured by in-vivo microdialysis coupled to HPLC. In another study, rats treated (21 d, i. p.) with either fluoxetine or vehicle also received intra-DPAG injection of WAY 100635 or saline 10 min before being tested in the elevated T-maze. Chronic, but not acute, administration of fluoxetine significantly raised extracellular levels of 5 -HT in DPAG. Long-term treatment with buspirone was ineffective. In the elevated T-maze, intra-DPAG injection of WAY 100635 fully blocked the anti-escape effect of chronic administration of fluoxetine. Therefore, chronic fluoxetine facilitates 5 -HT(1 A) -mediated neurotransmission within DPAG and this effect accounts for the panicolytic-like effect of this antidepressant in the elevated T-maze.

40|$|Several {{investigations}} have provided information that defensive behaviors evoked by stimulation of deep {{layers of the}} superior colliculus (dISC) are subjected to inhibitory nigral modulation. This inhibition is made mainly through GABAergic neurons from substantia, nigra, pars reticulata (SNpr), that sends outputs toward neural networks of the deep layers of the superior colliculus and dorsal periaqueductal gray matter involved with the organization of fear-like responses. in this work, we compared the effects of two GABAergic agonists, muscimol and baclofen, with the effect of neurotoxin AvTx 8 (1567 Da), isolated from the venom of the social wasp Agelaia vicina, microinjected into SNpr of Rattus norvegicus (Wistar rats) prior to dISC saline or bicuculline microinjections, considering that wasp venom has some influence on the uptake of GABA and/or glutamate neurotransmitters. GABA(A) receptor blockade in the dISC evoked a vigorous escape behavior, expressed by rapid running, jumps and turns, as compared to control. These defensive reactions were maximized after the intranigral GABA(A) agonism with muscimol, but not after in situ GABA(B) agonism. Nigral microinjection of AvTx 8 induced similar effects to those of baclofen, decreasing the intensity of behavioral defensive reactions caused by GABA(A) receptor blockade in the dorsal mesencephalon. These findings suggest that AvTx 8 has some effects on GABAergic neurotransmission, increasing {{the activity of the}} inhibitory nigrocollicular pathways, causing an <b>anti-panic</b> (antiaversive) effect. Therefore, our work suggests AvTx 8 as a novel pharmacological tool to study differences between the two types of GABAergic receptors and excitatory amino acid-mediated mechanisms in the brain and brainstem networks.

40|$|The dorsomedial {{hypothalamus}} (DMH) {{has long}} {{been associated with the}} regulation of escape, a panicrelated defensive response. Previous evidence has shown that the activation of serotonin (5 -HT) 1 A and 2 A receptors impairs escape behavior induced by the electrical stimulation of the same region. in this study we further explore the relationship of the DMH with defense by investigating the effects of 5 -HT 1 A activation on escape behavior generated in male Wistar rats by an ethologically based aversive stimuli, exposure to one of the open arms of the elevated T-maze (ETM). Aside from escape, the ETM also allows the measurement of inhibitory avoidance, a defensive response associated with generalized anxiety disorder. To evaluate locomotor activity, after ETM measurements animals were submitted to an open field. Results showed that intra-DMH administration of the 5 -HT 1 A receptor agonist 8 -OH-DPAT inhibited escape expression. Local administration of the 5 -HT 1 A antagonist WAY- 100635 by its own was ineffective, but blocked the panicolytic-like effect of 8 -OH-DPAT. Chronic (21 days) systemic treatment with imipramine potentiated the anti-escape effect of 8 -OH-DPAT. No significant effects of treatment with 8 -OH-DPAT or imipramine on avoidance latencies or the number of lines crossed in the open field were found: These results indicate that 5 -HT 1 A receptors within the DMH may play a phasic inhibitory role on ETM escape expression. As previously proposed, facilitation of 5 -HT 1 A-mediated neurotransmission in the DMH may be involved in the mechanism of action of <b>anti-panic</b> compounds. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Background: Recent {{studies have}} {{examined}} the proper role of benzodiazepine pharmacotherapy in the treatment of Panic Disorder (PD). The purpose of this naturalistic outcome study is to evaluate the possible clinical benefits and safety of paroxetine/ clonazepam combination therapy in the acute treatment phase (weeks 1 - 16) of PD. We also compare the treatment outcome of paroxetine plus short-term clonazepam versus paroxetine monotherapy at one year follow-up. Method: Seventy-seven patients with PD with or without agoraphobia participated in our study. All 77 patients received paroxetine (up to 40 mg per day) and 30 / 77 patients received paroxetine plus clonazepam (up to 1. 5 mg/day) for the first 12 weeks of treatment. Patients were assigned to receive clonazepam in a non-randomized fashion. A gradual clonazepam taper was started after week 8, and the clonazepam was discontinued at week 12. The patients in both groups were then continued on paroxetine monotherapy for a total of 12 months. The Panic Self-Questionnaire" (PSQ) was administered to all patients on a monthly basis for one year. Results: The majority of the patients responded well to the pharmacological treatment. Patients showed a statistically significant improvement at four weeks, eight weeks, sixteen weeks and twelve months follow-up. At four weeks and eight weeks follow-up, the paroxetine-clonazepam group reported lower levels of panic symptoms compared to the paroxetine monotherapy group (df: 1, p< 0. 01). At the sixteen week, and twelve month follow-up visits, there were no statistically {{significant differences between the two}} groups (p=NS) in terms of treatment response. Also, there was no significant difference between the PD and the PD with Agoraphobia (PDA) groups at baseline and at all follow-up points. Age, sex and, duration of illness had no significant effect on treatment outcome. Conclusion: The combination of paroxetine and clonazepam was more beneficial than paroxetine alone during the acute phase of treatment. During the subsequent maintenance phase, however, there was no significant difference between the two groups. We suggest that clonazepam may be useful as an <b>anti-panic</b> agent during the acute treatment phase of PD, but long-term use is not recommended...|$|E
40|$|Background and aims: Panic {{disorder}} is a psychiatric disorder characterized by sudden attacks of intense anxiety. It displays {{a lot of}} features suggesting {{that it may be}} associated with an underlying aberration in the autonomic regulation of heart activity and respiration: i) the attacks are often characterized by respiratory symptoms and symptoms from the heart, ii) the attacks can be elicited by respiratory stimulants, iii) between attacks, patients with panic disorder often display enhanced respiratory variability and reduced heart rate variability, and iv) patients with panic disorder display enhanced prevalence of respiratory disorders and enhanced mortality in cardiovascular disease. Addressing the reasons for these physiological aberrations may help in elucidating the pathophysiology underlying panic disorder, and shed light on why this {{disorder is}} associated with enhanced mortality in cardiovascular disease. Serotonin is believed to be a neurotransmitter of great importance for panic disorder, {{as well as for the}} regulation of respiration: one main purpose of the animal studies presented in this thesis hence was to increase our knowledge regarding the role of serotonin in respiratory regulation, the hypothesis being that aberrations in respiration may cause the anxiety attacks, and that serotonin-modulating drugs may prevent panic attacks partly by stabilizing the regulation of respiration. In the first part of the thesis, data is presented on the effects on respiration in freely moving rats of various serotonergic compounds. The second part of this thesis is focused on genetic variations that may be associated with panic disorder. Orexin is a neuropeptide of suggested importance for both respiratory regulation and arousal. We investigated two polymorphisms in the orexin receptors 1 and 2, HCRTR 1 Ile 408 Val and HCRTR 2 Val 308 Iso, in panic disorder patients and healthy controls. Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) is an enzyme that degrades catecholamines such as dopamine and noradrenaline, and may thus be of importance for both autonomic control and psychiatric symptoms. The functional Val 158 Met polymorphism in this gene has been associated with panic disorder in several studies; in an attempt to replicate this finding, we genotyped this polymorphism in the same group of panic disorder patients. In a separate cohort, we also explored if the same polymorphism is associated with risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Observations: 1) Serotonin depletion with para-chlorophenylalanine decreased respiratory rate and increased respiratory variability. 2) Chronic treatment with serotonin reuptake inhibitors increased respiratory rate. 3) Acute treatment with serotonin reuptake inhibitors, as well as the serotonin releasing drugs d-fenfluramine and m-CPP, and the 5 -HT 1 A antagonist WAY- 100635, decreased respiratory rate. 4) The HCRTR 2 Val 308 Iso polymorphism was significantly associated with panic disorder in women. 5) In line with previous studies in Caucasian samples, the COMT Val 158 allele was significantly more frequent in PD patients than controls. 6) Met 158 allele carriers displayed significantly higher waist-hip-ratio, sagittal diameter, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate, than Val 158 allele carriers in a population of healthy men. Conclusions: Our results suggest that serotonin exert a modulatory role on respiration, and support the notion that an influence on respiration may contribute both to the anxiogenic and the <b>anti-panic</b> effects of serotonergic drugs. The association between panic disorder and the hypocretin receptor- 2 Val 308 Iso polymorphism is a novel finding in need of replication, whereas the association between panic disorder and the COMT Val 158 allele can by now be regarded as confirmed. The association between the COMT Val 158 Met polymorphism and cardiovascular risk factors is of interest, but does not support the theory that this polymorphism contributes to the enhanced mortality in cardiovascular disease seen in panic disorder patients...|$|E
