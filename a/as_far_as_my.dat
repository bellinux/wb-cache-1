500|$|Calvin and Servetus {{were first}} brought into contact in 1546 through a common acquaintance, Jean Frellon of Lyon; they {{exchanged}} letters debating doctrine; Calvin used a pseudonym as Charles d' Espeville; Servetus left his unsigned. Eventually, Calvin lost patience {{and refused to}} respond; by this time Servetus had written around thirty letters to Calvin. Calvin was particularly outraged when Servetus sent him {{a copy of the}} Institutes of the Christian Religion heavily annotated with arguments pointing to errors in the book. When Servetus mentioned that he would come to Geneva, [...] "Espeville" [...] (Calvin) wrote a letter to Farel on 13 February 1546 noting that if Servetus were to come, he would not assure him safe conduct: [...] "for if he came, <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>my</b> authority goes, I would not let him leave alive." ...|$|E
500|$|In Leipzig, Bache studied piano with Ignaz Moscheles and {{composition}} with Carl Reinecke. He also {{became friends with}} a fellow student, Arthur Sullivan, who, he wrote, [...] "cannot play well, but ... has written some things which I think show great talent." [...] Another fellow student Bache knew well, though they were not especially close, was Edvard Grieg. While the city was reportedly past the halcyon days it had experienced under Mendelssohn, it proved valuable for exposing Bache to artists such as Pauline Viardot, Giulia Grisi, Joseph Joachim and Henri Vieuxtemps, and {{to the music of}} Beethoven, Bellini, Chopin, Moritz Hauptmann and Mendelssohn. He applied himself to his piano studies, but by his own admission wasted much time in Leipzig and lacked direction. In Brother Musicians, Constance quotes [...] "a musician of high standing" [...] who was one of his circle of friends (possibly Sullivan or the pianist Franklin Taylor), who explained, [...] "You see in Leipzig nobody was compelled to work, there being no particular supervision; and there was always plenty to do, in the way of amusement, for the less energetic. <b>As</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>my</b> recollection goes Bache was at that time rather given to working by fits and starts, frequently making excellent resolutions, the effect of which did not last many days." ...|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} {{published in the}} alternative weekly Montreal Mirror on June 8, Day addressed some of the perceptions that he was homophobic. He began by denying that he had ever referred to homosexuality as a [...] "mental disorder". He acknowledged having gay staffers working on his campaign: [...] "First of all, <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>my</b> campaign, I don't ask people if they're homosexual, lesbian or heterosexual. People who are working on my campaign are doing so because they believe in me. That doesn't mean that they necessarily agree 100 per cent with everything I believe. But in principle they're saying we think you can take this Alliance {{to the next step}} and we think you'd be good for Canada. So I don't ask. Nobody has to pass a sex test to be on this campaign." [...] But the statement that made headlines in newspapers across the country was Day's acknowledgment that he would indeed consider using the Notwithstanding Clause to block a Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage, then a distinct possibility that was unnerving many social conservatives. After being pressed by journalist Matthew Hays on the Notwithstanding Clause question, Day replied [...] "Yes, and the reason I say that is because such a significant number of constituents would reflect concern on that and would want the discussion. The Alberta position on this is that the definition of marriage changing would allow {{for the use of the}} Notwithstanding Clause. That's because the sense of the elected officials in Alberta is that the people would be significantly motivated on that issue." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2006, {{during an}} {{interview}} with MTV News, Knowles spoke about her more aggressive stage persona, Sasha Fierce. She said: [...] "I absolutely get scared every time I get on the stage. I get nervous. I'm actually really scared when I'm not nervous because then I don't transform into that person that {{people are used to}} seeing." [...] She added that in real life, she was nothing like the person people see in her videos and performances: [...] "I'm really more quiet, reserved. I speak when spoken to and polite. When I'm onstage, I'm aggressive, I'm strong, I'm fearless." [...] Knowles' third album I Am... Sasha Fierce formally introduced Sasha Fierce as her alter ego; she revealed that Sasha was born during the making of her single [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] (2003). In an interview with People magazine, Knowles affirmed that her alter ego is strictly for the stage and Sasha Fierce was further described as the singer's sensual, aggressive alter ego. In October 2008, Billboard magazine reported that Knowles would go on tour in the spring of 2009 to support her third studio album. Beyoncé's father and manager Mathew Knowles revealed that it would visit different countries worldwide. The tour dates for the European leg were announced in December 2008. During an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Knowles confirmed that she was excited about the tour and that she would be backed by her all-female band which also accompanied her during her previous tour The Beyoncé Experience (2007). She also stated that she worked on the tour for eight months, rehearsing and trying to put the set list together. Knowles further revealed that the twelve-hour rehearsals for the tour included dancing the choreography in heels for two months before it commenced. She also added that she learnt to make transition from herself to Sasha Fierce really fast for the performances. Knowles further acknowledged that I Am... World Tour was a huge production and that she was proud of the theatrical show she created. She said that it was a mixture of everything she loved: [...] "I tried to bring jazz and hip-hop, and ballet and fashion, and everything together... It is the best thing I've done <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>my</b> tours go." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{series in}} Australia 'emphasised {{the gulf between}} players and administrators' and John Snow wrote 'I was sick of the biased {{attitude}} and incompetence which was apparent in cricket administration. David Clark was the MCC tour manager, Bernard Thomas of Warwickshire the assistant manager and physiotherapist and G.C.A. Saulez the scorer. Clark had been the amateur captain of Kent in 1949-51 who was described by Ray Illingworth as [...] "an amiable, but somewhat ineffectual man". and there were soon divisions {{between him and the}} players. John Snow had bowled over 50 eight-ball overs in the First Test and was rested for the state match against Western Australia, but Clark insisted that he practice in the nets with the other bowlers. Snow bowled a couple of desultory overs and Clark berated him for five minutes after which Snow told him [...] "that <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>my</b> good conduct money was concerned he could swallow it" [...] and went walkabout until the next day. Ray Illingworth smoothed things over, but in Second Test Clark criticised both captains for cautious play and England for their short-pitched bowling. When asked by the press if he would prefer four more draws or a 3-1 Australian victory he replied [...] "I'd rather see four results" [...] as if they were drawn there might be no Ashes left to play for. Ray Illingworth only discovered this when he was asked for a comment by a journalist in the morning and the team when they read it in the newspapers. As a result, Illingworth effectively took over the running of the tour {{with the support of the}} players and Clark's influence declined. Clark's only ally was the vice-captain Colin Cowdrey, also from Kent, who became isolated as a result. Unlike his predecessors Illingworth insisted on good hotel accommodation, decent sporting facilities, better travel arrangements, higher allowances and pay and fought hard to get them, which was greatly appreciated by the players. In the final Sydney Test Clark tried to push Illingworth back onto the field when he took the team off because of the crowd throwing beer cans after the Snow-Jenner incident. A furious Illingworth said he would not return until the playing area had been cleared and the crowd had calmed down and objected to Clark constantly siding with the Australians against his own team. When the team returned to England Illingworth said that [...] "all hell would break loose" [...] if anyone was denied his good conduct bonus (as had happened with Fred Trueman in the West Indies in 1953-54), but this did not happen.
