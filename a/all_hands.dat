The music on the record ranges from soft melodies to fast punk rock guitar work, while the lyrics address multiple media issues, such as the image of women in rock, music journalism, and violence as entertainment, among others.|$|E
5|$|In {{the control}} and living spaces, the ship had quieted down, too. Orders were given in low voices; the men speak to each other, {{carrying}} out their normal duties, in a repressed atmosphere. A regular pall has descended upon us. I know that <b>all</b> <b>hands</b> {{are aware of the}} decision and recognize the need for it. Perhaps they are relieved {{that they did not have}} to make it. But it is apparent that this unexpected illness, something that could neither have been foreseen nor prevented, may ruin our submergence record.|$|E

5|$|Of {{the three}} boats of the class, only U-5 survived the war intact. U-12 was sunk {{with the loss}} of <b>all</b> <b>hands</b> when she hit a mine near Venice in August 1915, while U-6 was scuttled by her crew in May 1916 after {{becoming}} trapped in an anti-submarine net that {{was a part of the}} Otranto Barrage. U-5 herself sank after hitting an Austro-Hungarian mine during a training exercise, but was raised, repaired and recommissioned before the war's end. U-5 was ceded to Italy as a war reparation and scrapped in 1920.|$|E
5|$|On 3 July, Linienschiffsleutnant Ludwig Müller sailed U-20 {{out from}} Trieste for the Gulf of Venice. A day later, U-20 was spotted by the Italian {{submarine}} F-12, {{which was on}} patrol in the northern Adriatic. F-12 initially pursued U-20 underwater, {{and then on the}} surface. At a range of , F-12 torpedoed U-20 at position , sinking her with <b>all</b> <b>hands.</b> There was no wreckage on the surface, only an oil slick. Like all of her sister boats, U-20 had no wartime successes.|$|E

5|$|Set in the 24th century, {{the series}} follows {{the adventures of}} {{the crew of the}} Federation {{starship}} Enterprise. In this episode, the Enterprise is caught in a time loop which results in the destruction of the ship and the loss of <b>all</b> <b>hands</b> after a collision with the USS Bozeman. As events re-occur, they begin to feel a sense of déjà vu and upon investigating, realize their predicament. Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner) realizes how to pass a brief message to himself in the next loop, which allows him to save the ship from destruction.|$|E
5|$|The storm {{reportedly}} {{killed three}} {{people on the}} island.

Roosevelt, averted its course after encountering adverse conditions.|$|E
5|$|The {{submarine}} sank {{only one}} ship, a Greek cargo ship in May 1915, {{but she had}} earlier captured six Montenegrin sailing vessels as prizes in March. U-12 also damaged, but did not sink, the French battleship Jean Bart in December 1914. While searching for targets {{in the vicinity of}} Venice in August 1915, U-12 struck a mine that blew her stern off, and sank with <b>all</b> <b>hands,</b> becoming the first Austro-Hungarian submarine sunk in the war. Her wreck was salvaged the next year by the Italians, who interred U-12s crewmen in a Venetian cemetery.|$|E

In March 1916, UB-13 was responsible for sinking the Dutch ocean liner , raising the ire of the Dutch public. Tubantia was the largest neutral vessel sunk during the war and among the 30 largest ships sunk by U-boats. On 24 April 1916, UB-13 was sunk with <b>all</b> <b>hands.</b>|$|E
5|$|USS Albany, {{the first}} United States Navy ship of that name, {{was built in}} the 1840s for the US Navy. The ship was among the last of the wooden sloops powered by sail and saw {{extensive}} service in the Mexican War. Before and after her combat service, Albany conducted surveillance and observation missions throughout the Caribbean. In September 1854, during a journey along the coast of Venezuela, Albany was lost with <b>all</b> <b>hands</b> on 28 or 29 September 1854. Included among the 250 men lost were several sons and grandsons of politically prominent men.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{overwhelming}} French majority in numbers, {{the attack was}} a disaster: nearly 1,000 French soldiers were killed as the boats were caught in open water under the island's gun batteries: several were sunk with <b>all</b> <b>hands.</b> Heavy fire from batteries and Royal Marines prevented a single French soldier from landing and the retreating fleet was subject to heavy fire from the smaller island to the north, inflicting further losses. British casualties were negligible. Although this operation indicated the probable result of a full-scale invasion of Britain, the threat remained and British forces began a close blockade of the surviving landing craft that were anchored in the Cotentin ports. A month after the battle this strategy resulted in a secondary success when a French frigate and corvette passing along the coast were intercepted and defeated by the blockade squadron.|$|E
