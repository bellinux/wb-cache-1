5|$|During {{the filming}} of his directorial debut Vandemataram (1939) at Hampi, Bommireddy Narasimha Reddy visited the Virupaksha Temple to capture {{the beauty of the}} monuments, which {{reflected}} the taste and artistic outlook of Krishnadevaraya, king of the Vijayanagara Empire. At the heart of the temple, Narasimha Reddy felt that he was standing exactly <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> Krishnadevaraya had once stood and offered prayers to the deity. From that moment, Reddy decided to make a film in which Krishnadevaraya would be the main character, and he began working on the script.|$|E

5|$|Piaget {{concluded}} that some infants {{are too young}} to understand object permanence, which explains why they do not cry when their mothers are gone ("out of sight, out of mind"). A lack of object permanence can lead to A-not-B errors, where children reach for a thing <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> it should not be. Older infants are less likely to make the A-not-B error because they are able to understand the concept of object permanence more than younger infants. However, researchers have found that A-not-B errors do not always show up consistently. They {{concluded that}} this type of error might be due to a failure in memory or the fact that infants usually tend to repeat a previous motor behavior.|$|E

Oedipus sends immediately for the man to either confirm or deny his guilt. At the very worst, though, he expects to find himself to be the unsuspecting murderer of a man unknown to him. The truth has not yet been made clear.|$|E

25|$|Positioned on {{the shores}} of a glacial lake {{at the end of the}} last Ice Age, Pickering was in an ideal place for early {{settlers}} to benefit from the multiple natural resources of the moorlands to the north, the wetlands to the south, running water in the beck and the forests all around.

25|$|The {{investigators}} were thus able {{to recreate the}} bombers activities. Amrozi, Idris and Ali Imron had simply walked into a dealership and purchased a new Yamaha motorbike, after asking how much they could re-sell it for if they returned it in a few days. Imron used the motorbike to plant the small bomb outside the U.S. Consulate. Idris then rode the motorbike as Imron drove two suicide bombers in the Mitsubishi to the nightclub district in Kuta. He stopped near the Sari Club, instructed one suicide bomber {{to put on his}} explosives vest and the other to arm the vehicle bomb. The first bomber headed to Paddy's Pub. Idris then left the second bomber, who had only learned to drive in a straight line, to drive the minivan the short distance to the Sari Club. Idris picked up Imron on the Yamaha and the duo headed back into Denpasar. Idris dialed the number of the Nokia to detonate the bomb at the Consulate. The two suicide bombers exploded their devices. Imron and Idris dropped the motorbike <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> it eventually attracted the attention of the caretaker.|$|E
25|$|The {{plans and}} {{designs for the}} new {{cemetery}} were drawn up by the Commission's architect, Barry Edwards. One of the immediate problems faced was deciding on a suitable location. The original location of the mass graves was considered as a site for the cemetery (and was offered as such by the landowner), but the ground {{was found to be}} too prone to flooding. The site that was chosen was nearby, about 120metres to the southwest of the original battlefield mass graves, but on a higher piece of land just outside the village of Fromelles. The overall cemetery shape is hexagonal, and the design incorporated radial rows of headstones leading towards a raised Cross of Sacrifice on the southern side of the cemetery. This higher location for the cemetery allowed the deliberate placement of the Cross of Sacrifice <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> it would be visible on the skyline when viewed from the nearby V.C. Corner Australian Cemetery and Memorial. This memorial is one of several locations in and around Fromelles where those who fell in the battle are commemorated. The Fromelles battlefield of 1916 would also be visible from the elevated Cross of Sacrifice terrace. Another consideration in the design was the cemetery orientation, with the headstones orientated to the south to avoid shadows and to increase the daytime visibility of the headstone inscriptions. The exact layout of the burial plots was left flexible as the number of burials needed was not known at that point. A small car park was included in the design. Unlike earlier CWGC cemeteries, this modern cemetery was designed to include ramps to allow accessibility for wheelchair users.|$|E

500|$|Most of {{the myths}} {{associated}} with the temple are not dated and vary with the different religious and ethnic groups as well. One set of myths deals {{with the creation of}} the temple, and the other deals with various reconstruction efforts. For the Hindu Tamils, the Munneswaram temple is primarily a Siva temple. [...] According to a Tamil legend, the temple is situated <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> king Rama of Ayodhya (in India), the hero of the epic Ramayana, prayed to Siva after his war with the demon-king Ravana of Lanka (identified with Sri Lanka). For Sinhala Buddhists who hail from outside of Pattuva, Munneswaram is primarily a goddess temple, currently associated with Kali, and also a popular place of sorcery. Sinhalese myths say that Munneswaram is the place where the deity Kali landed from India. The legend further postulates that another Sinhalese female deity, Pattini, prevented Kali from devouring human beings and made her settle down in Munneswaram.|$|E

2500|$|In {{situations}} where direct pressure and elevation are either not possible or proving ineffective, {{and there is}} a risk of exsanguination, some training protocols advocate the use of pressure points to constrict the major artery that feeds the point of the bleed. [...] This is usually performed <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> a pulse can be found, such as in the femoral artery. [...] There are significant risks involved in performing pressure point constriction, including necrosis of the area below the constriction, and most protocols give a maximum time for constriction (often around 10 minutes). [...] There is particularly high danger if constricting the carotid artery in the neck, as the brain is sensitive to hypoxia and brain damage can result within minutes of application of pressure. Pressure on the carotid artery can also cause vagal tone induced bradycardia, which can eventually stop the heart. Other dangers in use of a constricting method include rhabdomyolysis, which is a buildup of toxins below the pressure point, which if released back into the main bloodstream may cause renal failure.|$|E
2500|$|In March 1915, Joffre {{concluded}} that a period of inactivity would benefit the Germans more than the French; General Ferdinand Foch, commander of the Groupe Provisoire du Nord (GPN), proposed an offensive in which a [...] "general action" [...] on the Western Front including the British, to confuse the defenders and pin down reserves, would complement a [...] "decisive action", {{to break through the}} German defences, <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> the Germans {{would not be able to}} establish a new defensive front by a short retirement. Joffre accepted the proposals on 23 March, with the objective being the seizure of Vimy Ridge and exploitation of the success by an eastwards advance into the Douai plain. The French army had not completed an adaptation to siege warfare and much of the equipment necessary, particularly heavy artillery, did not exist. It had been impossible to synchronise operations in Artois with the First Battle of Champagne, which ended on 17 March. Debate within the army as to means and ends had led to two schools of thought: those who like Joffre favoured [...] "continuous battle" [...] (an attack without pause involving all resources) and advocates of [...] "methodical battle" [...] like Foch, who wanted to conduct offensives as series of attacks, with pauses to reorganise and consolidate.|$|E
2500|$|The NAACP of Portland withdrew {{its support}} of the protest, accusing the {{original}} organizers of failing to discuss discrimination affecting minority groups, specifically immigrants, Muslim women, and women of color.
