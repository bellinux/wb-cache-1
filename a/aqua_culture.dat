40|$|BACKGROUND: Pollution in {{aquaculture}} {{areas may}} negatively impact edible species and threaten seafood quality and safety. The {{aim of this}} study was to determine the interaction between copper and bacteria in the aquatic habitat and their impact upon crustaceans. Marbled crayfish was chosen as a model of aquatic crustaceans and the influence of metal contamination on bacterial community structure in water used to culture crayfish and in crayfish themselves was investigated. Histamine, an allergen commonly formed by certain groups of bacteria in crustacean edible tissue during storage, was also determined. RESULTS: Copper exposure increased its concentration in crayfish meat by 17. 4 %, but the copper concentration remained within acceptable food safety limits. Elevated copper levels affected the bacterial community both in the water used to cultivate crayfish and in the marbled crayfish themselves. Cluster analysis of 16 S rRNA-gene based microbial community fingerprints revealed that copper impacted the bacterial community in the water and in the crayfish meat. However, copper exposure reduced the formation of histamine in crayfish meat during storage by 66. 3 %. CONCLUSION: Copper from the habitat appears to reduce histamine accumulation in crayfish meat during storage by affecting the bacterial community structure of the cultivation water and most likely also in the intestine of the crayfish. From a food safety point of view, copper treatment during the <b>aqua</b> <b>culturing</b> of crustaceans has a positive impact on the postharvest stage. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry...|$|R

40|$|Smoked {{vacuum-packed}} trout fillets {{have won}} {{importance in the}} market {{over the last few}} years, especially because of the increasing production in <b>aqua</b> <b>cultures.</b> According to the fish regulations (Fischhygiene-Verordnung 1994) fish processing facturies have to establish the principles of the HACCP-system for this potentially hazardous product. Similar control-plans were laid down also for the food trade in the ordinance about food hygiene (Lebensmittelhygiene-Verordnung 1997). Here, the most important control point is the maintenance of the cold chain according to the declared temperature in order to control the multiplying of spoiling bacteria and pathogenous microorganisms. The aim of the thesis was to estimate the hazard of insufficient cold storage. First, this study determines the hygienic state of smoked vacuum-packed trout fillets that were taken from fish processing plants, wholesale trade and retail markets. Then, the storage temperatures in chilled cabinets of food handling establishments were controlled by long-term measurements. Afterwards, challenge tests were carried out in order to assess the influence of different temperature conditions on the product quality and shelf life. The hazard caused by growth of L. monocytogenes and toxin production of Cl. botlinum was discussed. The results are summarized as follows: 1.) The median for the total aerobic bacterial count of 28 samples taken in fish processing plants was log 3, 10 cfu/g. The market anlysis of 44 samples bought in wholesale trade and 76 samples bought in retail shops showed a median of log 6, 38 cfu/g (wholesale) and log 6, 80 cfu/g (retail) for the total count. The predominant spoilage bacteria belonged to the group of lactic acid bacteria and Pseudomonas spp., followed by coliform bacteria and yeasts. 2.) L. monocytogenes was isolated in 43 (31 %) smoked trouts from wholesale trade and retail markets. 42 % of the L. monocytogenes-positive samples showed levels between log 2 and log 4 L. monocytogenes/g, in 12 % of the samples levels of more than log 4 L. monocytogenes/g were detected. 3.) The long-term measurements of the storage temperature proved insufficient cooling in 9 of 12 chilled cabinets. On the one hand the storage temperature remained constant over the whole period of time but exceeded the declared temperature partly extreme. In other hand the smoked trout fillets were stored at extremely varying temperatures. The labeled storage temperature was mainly exceeded during the defrosting period. Furthermore, the long-term determination showed that neither spot checks of the storage temperature by single measurement nor integrated displays provide meaningful results, because the defrosting can not be recorded. 4.) A high total bacterial load (> log 6 cfu/g) was reached at 3, 5 °C after 3 weeks storing of commercially produced smoked vacuum-packed trout fillets. A comparable result was attained within 8 days when the samples were stored at 11 °C. In samples stored at 6 °C, interrupted by one-hour storage at 11 °C, the limit of log 5 cfu/g was exceeded between the fifth and eighth day of storage. The minimum shelf life at a constant temperature of 4 °C should be fixed upon 14 days. 5.) Within the usual labeled shelf life of more than 3 weeks L. monocytogenes and Cl. botulinum will grow to high levels or produce toxin in smoked vacuum-packed trout fillets, if temperature abuse occurs (f. e., storage temperature of 10 °C). Therefore, for this potentially hazardous product a maximum storage temperature of 4 °C has to be settled. This indicates also a contribution to consumer protection. Furthermore, it is concluded from {{the results of this study}} that the trade has to be more responsible for the control point "storage temperature". <br...|$|R

40|$|Agro-discourse, or {{agricultural}} discourse, represents both a person-oriented and {{an institutional}} {{type of communication}} between the agricultural producers as participants in the agricultural sphere – {{one of the areas}} of production, processing and consumption of agricultural products (agronomy, crop production, horticulture, veterinary medicine, animal husbandry, mechanization and electrification of agriculture, land reclamation and irrigation of agricultural lands, environmental soil and water pollution, <b>aqua</b> and ichthiological <b>culture).</b> The cognitive model of this type of discourse organizes the entire aspect of agriculture as a semiotic formation comprising a significant part of human culture, and includes the appropriate chronotope, members (agents and customers – producers and consumers of agricultural products), tools, objects and conditions of cultivation, production, processing and consumption. Within the framework of this model we describe the linguosemiotic actualization of signs-pragmatonyms forming the system of concepts and nominations on agroindustrial themes in this discourse. The article describes the linguosemiotic actualization of one of the main types of signspragmatonyms – signs of agroengineering – in English and Russian agricultural discourse. These signs are qualified as signs-instrumentatives nominating the means of production and product operations (manipulations) with real material objects for the purpose of their treatment or processing as the procedures of transformation to some agricultural products. The agroengineering signs-pragmatonyms, as one of the agricultural sectors, providing mechanized cultivation and processing of soil for sowing grain, harvesting, growing and harvesting of fruits and vegetables, as well as carrying out many other manipulations and operations with the help of technology, include the signs which gain linguosemiotic actualization in English and Russian agricultural discourse.

5000|$|A {{common problem}} that plagues drug {{development}} is obtaining a sustainable {{supply of the}} compound. Compounds isolated from invertebrates {{can be difficult to}} obtain in sufficient quantity for clinical trials. Synthesis is an alternate source of the compound of interest if the compound is simple otherwise, it is generally not a viable alternative. <b>Aqua</b> <b>culture</b> is another alternative if the organism is readily grown otherwise, it may not be good sustainable source of a compound. Also, the small quantity the compound is usually found in from organisms makes this alternative even more expensive. For example, ET-743 can be isolated from the tunicate Ecteinascidia turbinata with a yield of 2 g per ton. [...] This would require thousands of tons of tunicate to be grown and extracted to produce the kilograms of ET-743 that would be required for the treatment of thousands of people. Some success has been had in producing compounds of interest from microorganisms. Microorganisms {{can be used as a}} sustainable source for the production of compounds of interest. They can also be used for the production of intermediates so that semisynthesis can be used to produce the final compound. This has been achieved for ET-743 with the production of the intermediate Safracin B from Pseudomonas fluoresens and the subsequent semisynthesis into ET-743. This is currently the industrial production method for the production of Yondelis.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about the {{importance}} of Brand Positioning. We look at Brand Positioning with regards to how practices are within one of Norway‟s most important industries - the Norwegian Fishing- and <b>Aqua</b> <b>Culture</b> Industry. There is the first research contributing to this particular field within this industry. We based our research on three research questions. First, we wanted to present and analyze relevant Brand Positioning theory. The chosen theory is mainly based on four renowned theorists‟ within Brand Positioning. We divided theory into five different parts; Brand Positioning Culture, Information Collection, Defining Brand Positioning, Implementation of Brand Positioning and Intended Effects of Brand Positioning. Theory is presented with a comparison and analysis of the different researchers‟ views. This comparison led to a development of a synthesis of the different Brand Positioning aspects; a Normative Framework. This framework is a basis for measuring Brand Positioning capabilities. We uncovered what companies‟ consider to be their strengths and weaknesses within Brand Positioning capabilities in relation to the Normative Framework. Our findings indicate that the industry in general consider themselves to be strong with collecting information, while there are signs of weaknesses with the implementation aspect of Brand Positioning. Our findings reveal several potential improvement areas for Fishing and <b>Aqua</b> <b>Culture</b> companies within Brand Positioning. In the final part of the research we compared companies‟ Brand Positioning practices and their economic performance. More specifically we looked at the companies‟ profit margins. Our analysis indicates that the definition aspect of Brand Positioning has a positive impact on profit margins. Only 45. 2 % of the surveyed companies state that they have a defined position for their brand, and merely 26. 9 % have a document that describes it. A lot of companies fail {{to come up with a}} position for their brands, and show a misunderstanding of what Brand Positioning means – to specifically state how their brand can be positively unique in comparison with competitors. We see that companies agree with the importance of defining a Brand Positioning, but they show poor enactment of it. This is a major improvement area within one of our nation‟s most important industries. If more companies‟ defined their brand‟s position, their economic performance could be a lot stronger than it is today...|$|E

One specific {{problem is the}} toxicity of ammonia in fish at levels of 25 μg/l - a very common issue in today’s <b>aqua</b> <b>culture.</b> In this study we report a development of a fast responsive, optical ammonia sensor for trace concentrations. Results Different hydrogels have been investigated as host polymers for a pH based sensing mechanism based on fluorescent dyes. A porous hydrophobic fluoropolymer membrane {{was used as an}} ion barrier cover layer to achieve a good ammonia permeability. The sensor’s sensitivity towards ammonia as well as crosssensitivity towards pH-value and salinity, and the temperature dependency have been determined. Two different methods to reference fluorescence signals have been employed to eliminate intensity-based measurement drawbacks. Conclusion The presented sensor features high sensitivity and a fast response even at concentrations near 1 ppb. No cross sensitivity towards pH and salinity could be observed and temperature dependency was determined as compensateable. Both referencing approaches prove themselves to be able to provide a simple use of the sensor for in-field applications. </p...|$|E

At the tissue level the Al deposition is prominent and mostly distributed in the intracellular spaces as well as cellular interfaces. The accumulation of Al and its induced oxidative damages are also revealed through Evan’s blue staining. In both the cases dose dependent responses of Al induced oxidative damages and its mitigation with Put was the resultant. Under non enzymatic antioxidation pathways, anthocyanin and flavonoids were the two phenolics over expressed as a function of Al and ameliorated with Put application. The property of root membranes was changed with an up regulation of H+/ATPase activity which was moderated by Put. The peroxidase activity particularly those were restricted to the wall bound also showed variability according to Al doses as revealed through in gel staining. From these studies of Al accumulation and its concomitant changes in physiological attributes in Salvinia plants, the species could be selected as a potential hyper accumulator of Al. The role of Put in Al accumulation as well as its moderation has been discussed with reference to physiological activities...|$|E
40|$|Climatic {{change is}} a {{significant}} and lasting change in the statistical distribution of weather patterns over periods ranging from decades to millions of years. Millions {{of people around the}} world depend on fish for income and livelihood. Linked to the strong increase in fish production, employment in capture fisheries and aquaculture has grown substantially in the last three decades, with an average rate of 3. 6 percent. Climatic changes affects spawning sites of fisheries resulting in the reduction of fish biomass, destruction of coral reeves, distortion of food web and food chain, and the reduction of caught fisheries. Shifts in ocean salinity are occurring, with near-surface waters in the more evaporative regions of most of the world’s ocean increasing in salinity, while marine areas in high latitudes are showing decreasing salinity due to greater precipitation, higher runoff, melting ice and other atmospheric processes. Importantly, increase in salinity affects fish spawning site which in turn influences fish population. This will translate to less income for fishers as they record less catch. In an attempt to meet up other social responsibilities, fishers may resort to other more dangerous methods of catching fish like toxic chemicals, explosives and dynamite. Serious sanctions must be put in place to restrain fishers from adopting these dangerous methods of catching fishes while effort must also be intensified to improve <b>aqua</b> <b>culture</b> production...|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{demand for}} fish with {{limiting}} local supply of fresh fish, results {{in having a}} range from 50 % to 63 % as self sufficient ration in the study period, 1988 - 1995. The policies of optimal use of marine fishery resources, and supporting non-traditional sectors of fish production as aquaculture sector and high-seas fishery became a necessary step. 	The study followed up the traditional sector of fishery, and factors affecting its yield with special references to its main two sources, Red Sea and Arabian Gulf. Red Sea shares decreased from 66 % to 59 %, while Arabian Gulf increased from 29 % to 40 $ of total marine fishery yield, between 1988 and 1995. <b>Aqua</b> <b>culture</b> and highseas fishery had a share of 5 % and 7 % total fish production in 1995, respectively. 	Fishing effort numbers had a negative impact of fishing yield, 4 kg/effort, while number of fishing days had a positive impact, 22 kg/day at Red Sea and 61 kg/day at the Arabian Gulf. Using the concept of Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY), to determine the optimal harvest rate from the traditional fishery sector, resulted in harvesting 53 thousands tons a year. The average current price level was 21 SR/kg. at the optimal harvest level, when the supply curve become a backward binding curve.

This study investigated the shallow subsurface of the beach ridges in down stretch of Kolleru Lake. The depth of sand deposition was calculated through geophysical resistivity survey.

Hydrogeomorphological study indicates that the potential aquifers around the Kolleru Lake are paleo beach ridges, buried river courses. All other geomorphic features either aquiclude or aquitards and may not be considered as prospective zones for groundwater. Though there are number of open wells present in the villages used for potable water, people are depending on imported water as their drinking water source, which signifies the contamination of groundwater resources. Present land use activities like aqua-culture, agriculture, large-scale industries and allied industries in and around the Kolleru Lake Region has large contribution for the change of water quality. The paleo beach ridge areas, where the permeability of the sandy soil is very high are also converted into aqua ponds.

40|$|Mangroves play a {{key role}} in carbon {{sequestration}} along tropical and subtropical coastlines, mainly as a result of their high primary productivity and the anoxic character of their soils, in which organic matter decay processes are slow. Unfortunately, these forests are disappearing worldwide, notably due to <b>aqua</b> <b>culture</b> and the need for space on the shoreline. The mangrove area in Viet Nam decreased substantially until late 90 's, which was a concern for the Vietnamese government. Then, replantation programs were developed in order to protect the shoreline against the erosion; like in northern Viet Nam, where monospecific stands were planted from the mid 90 's. Within this context, our objectives were to determine carbon stocks and carbon burial rates in the soil of a 18 years old Kandelia obovata (Sheue, Lui & Yong) mangrove forest. Three plots were set up in the planted mangroves and three in adjacent bare land (without any mangrove) at the mouth of Red River. Three geo-slicers up to 100 cm depth were taken in each plot; and in each core, ten soil samples were collected with a 10 cm depth interval. Later on, dead and live roots were sorted. Carbon contents in soils and in roots were determined using the Walkley-Black method and loss on ignition (LOI) method, respectively. Then, the total belowground carbon sequestration was estimated. There was a depth related distribution of organic carbon in soil with the highest concentrations measured between 20 and 60 cm depth. Accumulated carbon up to depth of 100 cm in soil and roots of the planted K. obovata were 146. 78 +/- 3. 87 Mg OC ha(- 1) and 12. 67 +/- 0. 14 Mg OC ha(- 1), respectively. The value was 87. 59 +/- 1. 08 Mg OC ha(- 1) for the adjacent bare land. Consequently, the mean carbon burial rate for this system was approximately 6. 94 Mg OC ha(- 1) yr(- 1), which is higher than most of the mangroves and may be related to a low export of the net primary productivity or most likely to a high sedimentation rate. These results were compared with previously published results on carbon stocks in younger planted forests of the same species in the same region, a positive and linear relationship was determined between the age of the planted stand and the below ground carbon stocks...|$|E

As farming of turbot is growing as an <b>aqua</b> <b>culture</b> enterprise, the identification of genetic regions responsible for economically import ant traits might be importance for future aquaculture of turbot. The sex-determining systems of fish appear {{to be at a}} primitive stage of evolution and display an amazing diversity, includi ng male heterogametic, female heterogametic, and temperature dependent systems. F emales of this species reach commercial size 4 - 6 months before than males, thus the interes t of industry in obtaining all-female populations. Neither mitotic nor meiotic chromosome s have shown sex-associated heteromorphisms in turbot, but the main sex determi ning region of turbot was identified after a detailed QTL and marker association analysis. Her e we describe the construction and characterization of a bacterial artificial chromoso me (BAC) library from turbot and the identification of clones containing genes related t o the sex determining region and to the gonadal differentiation process. The BAC library wa s constructed from the genomic DNA of a highly inbred individual using the vector pIndigo BAC 536. The large, high-quality inserts showed a size of at least 100 kb and < 5 % empty vect ors or non-recombinants were detected. Based on estimated turbot genome size: 800 Mb the l ibrary provides 5 x coverage. To our knowledge, this is the first reported Scophthalmus maximus BAC library. The library contains 46. 080 clones arrayed in 120 384 -well microtiter pl ates. To isolate genes related to sex- determination and differentiation we screened the l ibrary using the 4 D-PCR method with slight modifications. Several genes and/or markers associated to the main sex-determining region or related with gonad differentiation were i dentified and are being used for their physical mapping using FISH. Since some of them had been previously mapped, they are being useful to establish the correspondence betwee n the cytogenetic and genetic turbot maps. Using this information the BAC library will be furt her used to analyzed differences in the main sex determining region between males and femal es using positional cloning or chromosome microdissection. This BAC library will b e an essential tool for future projects on genome analysis of productive traits with relevant implications for turbot industry...|$|E
40|$|Animals {{are kept}} {{for a variety}} of reasons but in the {{developing}} world their purpose is primarily for food, transport or as a sign of wealth and status. They are kept in a variety of husbandry systems and in different numbers, from the single domestic cow to the large flocks and herds maintained in a range of systems. Their role as a source of nutrition is vital: by the end of the century, it is estimated, there will be four mouths to feed for every three there are now. Although world production is increasing, and in some commodities global surpluses exist, these can often disguise local scarcities. Maintaining and increasing food security is the challenge for the last decade of the millennium, but this must be done in price competitive terms. This will entail improvements in production efficiency, especially of those domestic animals which occupy an important place in the food chain. Science is now providing both new directions and new tools for those who are concerned with the management of animal production. The impact of bioscience (which covers the fields of nutrition, environment, disease, genetic selection, endocrinology, and chromosome manipulation) and its contribution to the progress of animal production worldwide, was the subject of the Royal Agricultural Society of England (RASE) annual Royal Agricultural Show in July 1989. Sub-Saharan Africa may not be totally representative of other developing regions in the world, but as a whole it represents the worst possible situation facing the agricultural sector of all the developing countries: frequent man-made and natural disasters have severely weakened the economy, particularly in the agricultural sector and present livestock productivity levels remain well Wow those in other developing countries. Thus an examination of how new technologies and research can increase productivity, and the constraints on these will increase understanding of the situation in other developing economies. In sub-Saharan Africa, livestock account for 5 % of the total GDP and 18 % of the agricultural GDP. Their contribution to daily calorie and protein intakes was well below the average for developing countries and any increases in recent years have lagged well behind those in population growth. Nutrition and control of animal diseases rather than genetic improvement are the problems which the governments of developing, particularly sub-Saharan African countries, must address. The development of such technologies requires a serious research effort. One contributor to the RASE symposium, Addis Anteneh of International Livestock Centre for Africa (ILCA), gave it as his opinion that all too often African agricultural researchers have to follow the brain drain trail to western high tech firms and research organizations. Trypanosomiasis research Two international research institutes have a mandate primarily emphasizing animal research in sub-Saharan Africa: ILCA and International Laboratory for Research on Animal Diseases (ILRAD). An ILCA/ILRAD collaborative research programme on trypanotolerance promises a considerable impact on future livestock production in those areas with low to medium tsetse challenge. Possibilities of trypanotolerant genetic transfers would facilitate even more rapid expansion of animal production in those same areas. Such developments would also permit better utilization of the vast areas of Africa currently affected by the tsetse. However, Praofessor Maxwell Murray, head of the veterinary medicine department of the University of Glasgow's Veterinary School, said that in his opinion there was little doubt that the optimum long-term solution would be a combination of genetically resistant animals and a cheap vaccine effective against different species of trypanosomes. Aquaculture development Unlike African livestock production, <b>aqua</b> <b>culture</b> is one area in which all six branches of bioscience can be of benefit to developing countries. In nutrition, considerably research is being applied in the key areas a micro-encapsulation of feeds for larval diet and feed formulation for species in tropical and sub-tropical areas. In disease control major developments in vaccine production and improved diagnostic methods will lea. to more efficient treatment. In the future the introduction of transgenic fish will have enormous potential benefits while conventional genetic selection offers the possibility of medium to long-term improvement. In endocrinology and chromosome manipulation new techniques offer quick solutions to several problems, including sexual maturation, manipulation of spawning time and induced ovulation an preservation of gametes. In the field of aquaculture, government c overseas aid money is vital in the initial steps of any enterprise, but industry-led research will provide the most rapid progress during the development and production process. The RASE symposium drew a clear line between those areas of bioscience which are of use to developing countries and those which cannot yet be applied because of political, financial, research or other constraints.
