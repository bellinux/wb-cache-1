40|$|Abstract Using {{more than}} 500 accelerometric ecords from three {{vertical}} arrays located in Japan, {{we performed a}} regression analysis in order to derive attenuation relationships atunderground sites with depths ranging from 100 to 950 m. Analyses were conducted on both peak ground acceleration a d pseudo-velocity response spec-tra. Because of {{a positive correlation between}} magnitude and distance, a two-step regression technique was employed. Results show that, compared with surface ground motion, peak accelerations at underground sites are lower by a factor <b>anging</b> from 1. 5 to 4 according to the depth. In the case of response spectra, differences between ground surface and underground spectra re dependent on geological con-ditions. For the three sites considered in the study, underground pseudo-velocity response spectra show amplitudes lower by a factor <b>anging</b> from 1. 5 to 10 according to the depth or the period considered. Ratios between the receiver esponses obtained at different depths provided av-erage transfer functions. Those were compared with transfer functions calculated by averaging ratios of observed response spectra between different depths. A good agreement between the two techniques was found. Finally, theoretical transfer func-tions were estimated using both one-dimensional SH and complete wave modeling. It was shown that the characteristics of the incident wave field can {{play an important role in}} the estimation of theoretical transfer functions...|$|E

To ex-plore {{the mechanism}} underlying passive avoidance deficits, we assessed {{the relation of}} extraversion, neuroticism, and response latency after punishment to passive avoidance l arning by using two successive go/no go discrimination tasks. The tasks were designed to examine two aspects of subjects' reactions to punishment: response speed on trials immediately following punishment (Experiment 1) and time to terminate punishment feedback between successive trials (i. e., reflectivity; Experi-ment 2). Consistent with previous findings, the results of Experiment 1 showed that extraverts com-mit more passive avoidance rrors than introverts do (Newman, Widom, & Nathan, 1985) and fail to pause following punished errors (Nichols & Newman, 1986). In Experiment 2, only neurotic extraverts displayed this pattern of performance differences. In both experiments, longer pausing following punishment predicted better learning from punishment for both introverts and extraverts. These results uggest that, {{in the presence of}} salient cues for reward, extraverts ' characteristic reac-tion to punishment interferes with processing punished errors and may contribute to their more general propensity for impulsive, nonreflective action...|$|E

The'dissolut ion kinetics of deposited Au spots after i l lumination and the possibi l ity of electroless gold deposit ion on the Au spots are discussed.

This unexpected behavior is expla ined in terms of rates of partial reactions, such as anodic Au dissolution and cathodic O 2 reduction, which can occur on different parts o f the electrode surface. It is concluded that, in general, the rate of a localized reaction at a semicon-ductor crystal depends not only on the size of the localized area, but also on the amount of crystal surface area exposed to the electrolyte.
