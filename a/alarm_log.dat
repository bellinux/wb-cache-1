40|$|Abstract- We {{describe}} a pre-processing technique for mining a telecommunication <b>alarm</b> <b>log</b> for frequent temporal patterns. The method consists in extracting relevant subsets {{from the initial}} log {{with the aim of}} discovering frequent patterns more accurately. In a first step, the alarm types presenting the same temporal behaviour are clustered with a self organizing map. Then, log areas which are rich in alarms of each cluster are regrouped in subsets which are subsequently exhaustively searched for frequent patterns. We demonstrate the efficiency of our preprocessing method through experiments on an actual <b>alarm</b> <b>log</b> from an ATM network. Keywords: Self-organizing map, chronicle recognition, telecommunications network supervision. ...|$|E

A reduction of alarm flood periods contributes to a decrease in plant incidents. In this work, a combination of <b>alarm</b> <b>log,</b> process data and connectivity analysis is used to isolate consequence alarms originating from the same process abnormality and to provide a causal alarm suggestion. The effectiveness of the method is illustrated on an industrial case study of an ethylene plant, a typical example of a large-scale industrial system...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel methodology {{to detect a}} set of more suitable attributes that may potentially contribute to emerging faults of a wind turbine. The set of attributes were selected from one-year historical data for analysis. The methodology uses the k-means clustering method to process outlier data and verifies the clustering results by comparing quartiles of boxplots, and applies the auto-associative neural networks to implement the residual approach that transforms the data to be approximately normally distributed. Hotelling T 2 multivariate quality control charts are constructed for monitoring the turbineâ€™s performance and relative contribution of each attribute is calculated for the data points out of upper limits to determine the set of potential attributes. A case using the historical data and the <b>alarm</b> <b>log</b> is given and illustrates that our methodology {{has the advantage of}} detecting a set of susceptible attributes at the same time compared with only one independent attribute is monitored...|$|E
40|$|Equipment shelter alarm {{management}} is usually performed from central offices from which field units react to alarms {{and to which}} they return after the alarm source has been fixed. This is time consuming and travel times are often long. The goal of this thesis is to present an efficient alarm handling solution that reduces costs and repair times. The thesis also presents theory about digital cartography, routing and mobile positioning. An alarm pilot was planned and built. The pilot combines a GIS system, an equipment shelter database, mobile positioning, routing and <b>alarm</b> <b>logging.</b> <b>Alarms</b> are received from external systems. Costs and repair times are reduced significantly when travel times are shorter. This requires the mobile positioning of the nearest field units to the alarm source.

40|$|The APT {{attack on}} the Internet is {{becoming}} more serious, and most of intrusion detection systems can only generate alarms to some steps of APT attack and cannot identify {{the pattern of the}} APT attack. To detect APT attack, many researchers established attack models and then correlated IDS logs with the attack models. However, the accuracy of detection deeply relied on the integrity of models. In this paper, we propose a new method to construct APT attack scenarios by mining IDS security logs. These APT attack scenarios can be further used for the APT detection. First, we classify all the attack events by purpose of phase of the intrusion kill chain. Then we add the attack event dimension to fuzzy clustering, correlate IDS <b>alarm</b> <b>logs</b> with fuzzy clustering, and generate the attack sequence set. Next, we delete the bug attack sequences to clean the set. Finally, we use the nonaftereffect property of probability transfer matrix to construct attack scenarios by mining the attack sequence set. Experiments show that the proposed method can construct the APT attack scenarios by mining IDS <b>alarm</b> <b>logs,</b> and the constructed scenarios match the actual situation {{so that they can be}} used for APT attack detection...|$|R

40|$|As the {{software}} industry grows larger by the minute, {{the need for}} automated solutions within bug report management is on the rise. Although some {{research has been conducted}} in the area of bug handling, new, faster or more precise approaches are yet to be developed. A bug report typically contains a free text observations field where the issue can be described by a human. Research regarding processing of this type of field is extensive, however, bug reports are often accompanied with system log files which have been given less attention so far. In the 4 G LTE telecommunications network, the available system log files are many and several are likely to aid the routing of bug reports. In this thesis, one system log file was chosen to be evaluated; the <b>alarm</b> <b>log.</b> The alarm logs are time series count data containing alarms raised by the system. The <b>alarm</b> <b>log</b> data have been pre-processed with data mining techniques. The Apriori algorithm has been used to mine for specific alarms and alarming objects which indicates that the bug report should be solved by a particular developer group. We extend the Apriori algorithm to a temporal setting by using a customised time dependent confidence measure. To further mine for interesting sequences of events in the logs, the sequence mining approach SPADE has been used. The extracted class-associated sequences from both pre-processing approaches are transformed into binary features possible to use as predictors in any prediction model. The results have been evaluated by predicting the correct developer group with two different methods; logistic regression and DO-probit. Logistic regression was regularised with the elastic net penalty to avoid computational issues as well as handling the sparse covariate set. DO-probit was used with a horseshoe prior; it is well suited for the sparse covariate regression problem as it is customised to obtain signals in sparse, noisy data. The results indicate that a data mining approach for processing alarm logs is promising. The results show that the rules obtained with the Apriori mining process are suitable for mining the alarm logs as most binary representations of the rules used as covariates in logistic regression are kept in the equations for the expected classes with strongly positive coefficients. Although, the overall improvement in accuracy from using the alarms logs in addition to the learned topics from free text fields is modest, the alarm logs are concluded to be a good complement to the free text information as some Apriori covariates appears to be better suited to predict some classes than some topics...|$|E

Often, important details are overlooked {{and it is difficult}} to get an overall picture of what is occurring in the network by manually traversing textual alarm logs.

Alarm data is presented in an overview where system administrators can get a general sense of network activity and easily detect anomalies. They then have the option of zooming and drilling down for details. The information is presented with local network IP (Internet Protocol) addresses plotted over multiple yaxes to represent the location of alarms.

40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} {{we focus on}} serial episodes, that are {{sequences}} of event types extracted from single or multiple input sequences, and that reflect a qualitative relation is-followed-by between the event types. Episodes have natural applications into several domains, including for instance the analysis of business time series, medical data, geophysical data and also <b>alarm</b> <b>log</b> analysis for network monitoring (especially in telecommunications). However, in many applications episodes clearly show some limitations, {{due to the fact}} that the information provided by the is-followed-by relation is not always enough to properly characterize the phenomena at hand. This, in particular, pulls our research toward the refinement of episodes to incorporate quantitative temporal information, able to describe the time intervals observed for the is-followed-by relation. We proposed a refinement of episodes called quantitative episodes, that provides quantitative temporal information in a readable, tree-based graphically representable form. These quantitative episodes describe the main groups of homogeneous behaviors within the occurrences of each episode, according to the elapsed times between the consecutive event types of the episode. Moreover, they are not provided in an isolated way, but in trees giving a global view of how the occurrences of the corresponding episode differentiate in homogeneous groups along the elements of the pattern. From a computational point of view, the main interest of the quantitative episodes is that they can be mined in a sound and complete way without increasing the cost of extractions significantly when compared to extractions of episodes alone. This is achieved through an extraction algorithm that tightly integrates episode extraction with a computationally reasonable analysis of temporal quantitative information...|$|E

40|$|As {{the trend}} of {{successful}} network attacks continue to rise, better forms of intrusion, detection and prevention are needed. This thesis addresses network traffic visualization techniques that aid administrators in recognizing attacks. A view of port statistics and Intrusion Detection System (IDS) alerts has been developed. Each help to address issues with analyzing large datasets involving networks. Due {{to the amount of}} traffic as well as the range of possible port numbers and IP addresses, scaling techniques are necessary. A port-based overview of network activity produces an improved representation for detecting and responding to malicious activity. We have found that presenting an overview using stacked histograms of aggregate port activity, combined with the ability to drill-down for finer details allows small, yet important details to be noticed and investigated without being obscured by large, usual traffic. Another problem administrators face is the cumbersome amount of alarm data generated from IDS sensors. As a result, important details are often overlooked, {{and it is difficult to}} get an overall picture of what is occurring in the network by manually traversing textual alarm logs. We have designed a novel visualization to address this problem by showing alarm activity within a network. Alarm data is presented in an overview from which system administrators can get a general sense of network activity and easily detect anomalies. They additionally have the option of then zooming and drilling down for details. Based on our system administrator requirements study, this graphical layout addresses what system administrators need to see, is faster and easier than analyzing text logs, and uses visualization techniques to effectively scale and display the data.

40|$|Abstract: Most {{commercial}} {{intrusion detection}} systems (IDSs) presently available are signature-based network IDSs. Organisations using these IDSs are still experiencing difficulties in detecting intrusive activity on their networks since novel new attacks are consistently being encountered, and analysts can miss legitimate alarms when reviewing large <b>alarm</b> <b>logs</b> that contain {{a high number}} of false positives. There has been research investigating the use of data mining techniques to effectively detect malicious activity in an enterprise network. The results of many of these projects have demonstrated that these techniques can be effective when trained/calibrated using labelled datasets. Labelled datasets identify and characterize normal and malicious traffic for use in training/calibrating the detection sensor. However, the creation of labelled datasets is resource intensive. It requires a significant effort by security analysts to create a data set that characterises the traffic in a specific enterprise network environment. This research simulates and analyses malicious activity on an enterprise network to explore the detection of malicious activity with data mining techniques using unlabelled datasets. Semi-discrete decomposition (SDD) is used as a clustering and outlier analysis technique to characterize network traffic as either normal or anomalous. 1...|$|R
40|$|The four LHC {{experiments}} at CERN {{have decided}} to use a commercial SCADA (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition) product for the supervision of their DCS (Detector Control System). The selected SCADA, which is therefore used for the CMS DCS, is PVSS II from the company ETM. This SCADA has its own database, which is suitable for storing conventional controls data such as voltages, temperatures and pressures. In addition, calibration data and FE (Front-End) electronics configuration need to be stored. The amount of these data is too large to be stored in the SCADA database [1]. Therefore an external database {{will be used for}} managing such data. However, this database should be completely integrated into the SCADA framework, it should be accessible from the SCADA and the SCADA features, e. g. <b>alarming,</b> <b>logging</b> should be benefited from.

40|$|Preventative {{maintenance}} {{is a key}} consideration for equipment manufacturers. In industries such as mining, oil & gas and rail, the site operators prioritise minimising disruption caused by downtime which leads to significant losses in terms of revenue and damage to reputation. Ensuring equipment is healthy is therefore a major concern for all stakeholders to ensure continued reliable operation of a site. Current methods of delivering such diagnostics typically form part of a SCADA suite which takes a site-wide approach to displaying information. While correct use of these suites has shown to bring benefits to both customer and supplier, {{it can be argued}} that they are not suitable for customers with small scale implementations, especially given their expensive nature and difficulty to configure. SCADA systems are also prone to being ineffective when troubleshooting low-level equipment related problems, especially in scenarios where automated equipment is deployed in remote sites for extended periods. In such cases, service engineers report scenarios where <b>alarm</b> <b>logs</b> were too full to effectively analyse and draw meaningful conclusions from. The aim of this project is to design and develop a solution that delivers enhanced product support through diagnostics and preventative maintenance. A graphical interface will be developed for engineers that displays technical information about equipment, aiding the troubleshooting process and reducing time spent on-site. A report-based graphical interface will cater for non-technical customers, providing an intuitive display of how healthy the system is. The report will also provide advice to aid with decision making when equipment is not being used optimally or is approaching the end of its life. Equipment manufacturers can take advantage of the solution to improve relationships with existing customers, appeal to new customers and generate a new revenue stream through enhanced support programmes. The solution is designed to recognise that continued site operation is of paramount importance for a customer. Production environments impose stringent safety restrictions which restricts invasive access to equipment when it is operating. A non-invasive wireless access mechanism is therefore a key requirement to ensure that downtime is minimised...|$|R
40|$|Current network {{security}} tools generally lack sufficient context for maintaining a well informed and proactive defense posture. Vulnerabilities are usually assessed in isolation, without considering how {{they contribute to}} overall attack risk. Similarly, intrusion <b>alarms</b> are <b>logged</b> as isolated events, with limited correlation capabilities. Security professionals are overwhelmed by constant threats, complexity of security data, and network growth. Our approach to network defense applies attack graphs for advanced vulnerability analysis and intrusion detection. Attack graphs map paths of vulnerability, showing how attackers can incrementally penetrate a network. We can then identify critical vulnerabilities and provide strategies for protection of critical network assets. Because of operational constraints, vulnerability paths may often remain. The residual attack graph then guides optimal intrusion detection and attack response. This includes optimal placement of intrusion detection sensors, correlating intrusion alarms, accounting for missed detections, prioritizing alarms, and predicting next possible attack steps. 1...|$|R
