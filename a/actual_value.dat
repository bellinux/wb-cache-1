5|$|Berzelius {{made some}} initial characterisations {{of the new}} metal and its {{chemical}} compounds: he correctly determined that the thorium–oxygen mass ratio of thorium oxide was 7.5 (its <b>actual</b> <b>value</b> is close to that, ~7.3), but he assumed the new element was divalent rather than tetravalent, and so calculated that the atomic mass was 7.5 times that of oxygen (120 amu); it is actually 15 times as large. He determined that thorium was a very electropositive metal, ahead of cerium and behind zirconium in electropositivity. Metallic thorium was isolated {{for the first time}} in 1914 by Dutch entrepreneurs Dirk Lely Jr. and Lodewijk Hamburger.|$|E
5|$|The first {{quantitative}} {{estimate of}} the speed of light was made in 1676 by Rømer (see Rømer's determination {{of the speed of}} light). From the observation that the periods of Jupiter's innermost moon Io appeared to be shorter when the Earth was approaching Jupiter than when receding from it, he concluded that light travels at a finite speed, and estimated that it takes light 22 minutes to cross the diameter of Earth's orbit. Christiaan Huygens combined this estimate with an estimate for the diameter of the Earth's orbit to obtain an estimate of speed of light of , 26% lower than the <b>actual</b> <b>value.</b>|$|E

5|$|Jones {{was accused}} (in a lawsuit brought by Mona Brewer against Earl Paulk of Chapel Hill Harvester Church) of using {{money from a}} $125 million green space bond sale to {{purchase}} a Decatur, GA church building from Paulk for $2.4 million, a sum claimed to be unjustifiably {{in excess of the}} land's <b>actual</b> <b>value.</b> The County made no use of the property, and was the building was later leased to a start-up cable network for a token sum of a dollar per year. During the ensuing court case, the plaintiff alleged that, as part of a questionable relationship, Paulk arranged for a sexual encounter between Jones and one of Paulk's former mistresses. When deposed, Jones refused to answer questions relating to that incident, {{as well as a number}} of other questions involving his dealings with Paulk. That case was ultimately withdrawn by the plaintiff's attorney, Louis Levenson, who felt that the judge in the case was biased against his client. The case was subsequently refiled and drew a different judge.|$|E
5|$|Archimedes {{was able}} to use infinitesimals {{in a way that is}} similar to modern {{integral}} calculus. Through proof by contradiction (reductio ad absurdum), he could give answers to problems to an arbitrary degree of accuracy, while specifying the limits within which the answer lay. This technique is known as the method of exhaustion, and he employed it to approximate the value of π. In Measurement of a Circle he did this by drawing a larger regular hexagon outside a circle and a smaller regular hexagon inside the circle, and progressively doubling the number of sides of each regular polygon, calculating the length of a side of each polygon at each step. As the number of sides increases, it becomes a more accurate approximation of a circle. After four such steps, when the polygons had 96 sides each, he {{was able to}} determine that the value of π lay between 3 (approximately 3.1429) and 3 (approximately 3.1408), consistent with its <b>actual</b> <b>value</b> of approximately 3.1416. He also proved that the area of a circle was equal to π multiplied by the square of the radius of the circle (πr2). In On the Sphere and Cylinder, Archimedes postulates that any magnitude when added to itself enough times will exceed any given magnitude. This is the Archimedean property of real numbers.|$|E
25|$|Let us {{consider}} a two-class prediction problem (binary classification), {{in which the}} outcomes are labeled either as positive (p) or negative (n). There are four possible outcomes from a binary classifier. If the outcome from a prediction is p and the <b>actual</b> <b>value</b> is also p, then it is called a true positive (TP); however if the <b>actual</b> <b>value</b> is n then {{it is said to}} be a false positive (FP). Conversely, a true negative (TN) has occurred when both the prediction outcome and the <b>actual</b> <b>value</b> are n, and false negative (FN) is when the prediction outcome is n while the <b>actual</b> <b>value</b> is p.|$|E

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) By {{focusing}} on the Schwartz (1992) value tradition, the main aim of this thesis was to establish that there are meaningful differences between people’s Ideal <b>values</b> and their <b>Actual</b> behavioural expression of values. A total of 645 first and second year students from a university in Australia responded {{to a number of}} psychometric instruments designed to measure Ideal and <b>Actual</b> <b>values,</b> traits, opinions, behaviours and psychological health. These investigations show that there are distinct differences in the way people conceptualise their Ideal and <b>Actual</b> <b>values.</b> They also indicate that a person’s innate traits, which were conceptualised via the five factor model of personality (Costa & McCrae, 1992), are distinctly different from their Ideal values and that both Ideal values and traits have a unique influence on the <b>Actual</b> expression of <b>values.</b> These findings are further explored in studies that show Ideal <b>values,</b> traits and <b>Actual</b> <b>values</b> all have unique relationships with both opinions and behaviours. It is also concluded {{that one of the most}} widely accepted and used measures of values, the Schwartz (1992) Value Survey, is probably assessing a combination of the Ideal and <b>Actual</b> aspects of <b>values.</b> Moreover, Schwartz’s (1992) underlying theory of values suggests that values can be conceptualised in terms of 10 Universal value types but no evidence was found to support this conceptualisation. Finally the thesis shows that differences between Ideal and <b>Actual</b> <b>values</b> are also related to poor psychological health. From these investigations it is concluded that there are very distinct differences between Ideal and <b>Actual</b> <b>values</b> and that these two aspects of values need to be considered when theorising about, or measuring, values...|$|R
