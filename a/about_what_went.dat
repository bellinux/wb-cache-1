2500|$|Throughout his career, Mahal has {{performed}} his brand of blues (an African American artform) for {{a predominantly white}} audience. This has been a disappointment at times for Mahal, who recognizes {{there is a general}} lack of interest in blues music among many African Americans today. He has drawn a parallel comparison between the blues and rap music in that they both were initially black forms of music that have come to be assimilated into the mainstream of society. He is quoted as saying, [...] "Eighty-one percent of the kids listening to rap were not black kids. Once there was a tremendous amount of money involved in it... they totally moved it over to a material side. It just went off to a terrible direction." [...] Mahal also believes that some people may think the blues are about wallowing in negativity and despair, a position he disagrees with. According to him, [...] "You can listen to my music from front to back, and you don't ever hear me moaning and crying about how bad you done treated me. I think that style of blues and that type of tone was something that happened as a result of many white people feeling very, very guilty <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>went</b> down." ...|$|E

Starting from these plain facts, the idea is that we should all write the story of the Moonstone in turn--as far as our own personal experience extends, and no farther. We must begin by showing how the Diamond first fell into the hands of my uncle Herncastle, when he was serving in India fifty years since. This prefatory narrative I have already got by me {{in the form of an}} old family paper, which relates the necessary particulars on the authority of an eye-witness. The next thing to do is to tell how the Diamond found its way into my aunt's house in Yorkshire, two years ago, and how it came to be lost in little more than twelve hours afterwards.
