Theoretical divisions within the field of STS are examined, particularly the Sociology of Scientific Knowledge (SSK) and Actor-Network Theory (ANT). Any conflicts which these two theories present to each other are examined through the empirical findings of the Irish wave energy sector. In particular, <b>ANT</b> <b>s</b> rejection of macro and micro distinctions when analysing society are compared to SSK s identification of causality in the creation of scientific knowledge and technology. <b>ANT</b> <b>s</b> network outlook was later built on by a new SSK concept called co-production and this is also examined in light of empirical findings.

Government White Papers, academic articles, websites and interviews are used in painting a broad picture of the Irish wave energy sector. This is then applied in answering the empirical research question: What {{needs to be done in}} order for wave energy to be successfully implemented in Ireland? The use of ANT shows that there are many forces at play in the Irish wave energy network, both positive and negative, and these have been crucial in plotting the path of this young and still developing sector.

40|$|The fire ants, Solenopsis invicta and S. richteri, were accidentally {{imported}} into the United States {{in the first}} half of this century from South America. In their adopted habitat the imported fire ants have thrived causing considerable medical and agricultural problems in the nine widely infested states of the south and southeast. The red imported fire <b>ant,</b> <b>S.</b> invicta was considered the dominant ant in the infested areas, having displaced the black imported fire <b>ant,</b> <b>S.</b> richteri, into a small enclave in north- eastern Mississippi. However, a large reproductively viable S. invicta/S. richteri hybrid population was recently discovered across northern Alabama and into Mississippi and Georia by chemical analysis. This paper reports on the use of three species-specific chemical characters (venom alkaloids, cuticular hydrocarbons, and trail pheromones) to define S. invicta, S. richteri, and hybrid populations in the United States. In addition, these characters have been applied to fire ant taxonomy in South America. We also discuss fire ant population dynamics in the United States and its implications on several models of hybridization. These results have important consequences regarding the species status of the two imported fire ants and the taxonomy of fire ant populations in South America...|$|R

The many physiological effects of the venom are caused by 2 -methyl- 6 -alkyl and/or alkenylpiperidine alkaloids. The variation in piperidine alkaloid structures has useful taxonomic characters. The most well studied Solenopsis species is S. invicta, which was accidentally imported into the USA in the 1930 s from South America. It quickly spread throughout the southern USA {{and is now a}} major invasive pest ant in the USA and {{in other parts of the}} world. Interestingly, the invasive S. invicta has largely displaced a native USA fire <b>ant,</b> <b>S.</b> geminata, from the southern USA. We explore the possibility that differences in venom chemistry could be correlated with this displacement. The cis and trans alkaloids from body extracts of workers and alate queens of S. geminata were separated by silica gel chromatography, identified, and quantitated by GC-MS analysis. Both workers and alate queens produce primarily cis- and trans- 2 -methyl- 6 -n-undecyl-piperidines, as well as other minor alkaloid components. Imported fire <b>ant,</b> <b>S.</b> invicta, alate queens produce the same alkaloids as S. geminata alate queens, but in contrast S. invicta workers produce piperidine alkaloids with longer side chains, which are purported to be physiologically more effective.

30|$|The red {{imported}} {{fire ant}} (RIFA) Solenopsis invicta is a globally invasive species, {{in part because}} it lives in high densities and may dominate potential food sources (Vinson 1994; Holway et al. 2002). The species is omnivorous, opportunistic, and exploits recently disturbed habitats by searching for food sources through a pheromonal pathway (Tschinkel et al. 1995; Taber 2000). The species utilizes a foraging distance of around 40  m from the mound (Martin et al. 1998). Evolution has modified the ants' sting in various ways to produce chemical substances to inject in, smear upon, or expel predators and potential competitors (Hölldobler and Wilson 1990).

These observations indicate that S. contracta larvae parachuted to the ground where they spin their cocoons in the soil. When a larva that had just parachuted down was returned to an arboreal twig, the larva repeated the parachuting behavior. This parachuting behavior appears to be adaptive, because larvae can descend to the ground safely and with low energy cost.

In this paper, we discuss the problems for calculating the Shapley-Shubik index, the Banzhaf index and the Deegan-Packel index of weighted majority games. 1. Introdution In 1944, John von Neumann and Oskar Motgenstern studied the distribution of power in voting systems in their book Theory of G a m e s and Economic Behavior [19]. They dealt with a ""simple game " in which the only goal is "winning". This is an abstraction of the constitutional political machinery for voting. This paper deals with the weighted majority game, which is a familiar example of voting systems. In 1960 s) U. S. Supreme Court handed down a series of "one person one vote " decisions. After that, calculations of power indices using real data were carried out and presented as evidence in the courtroom. For example, the courts in New York State have accepted the Banzhaf index (also called the Coleman value or Chow parameters) as an appropriate measure for weighted voting systems.
