40|$|Background: Most asthma {{patients}} in Sweden are treated in primary care, but {{little is known}} about economic aspects of asthma treatment in that setting and about the regional variation in the use of <b>antiasthmatics</b> drugs and the adherence to national guidelines for the treatment of asthma. General aims: To analyze treatment of asthma {{patients in}} terms of classification of severity, quality of life, variation in utilization, clinical practice and costs from a societal perspective. Methods: A prospective cross-sectional design was used to study the pharmaceutical costs of asthma and their relationship to quality of life, asthma severity, clinical practice and lungfunction and to compare different approaches to classifying asthma severity, all in primary care. A prospective cluster-randomized controlled trial was carried out in primary care to study the effect of information and monitoring on asthma control. To study regional variations in <b>antiasthmatics,</b> a registry study based on the Swedish National Prescribed Drug Register was performed. In all studies, the population consists of adult patients. However, in the registry study, there was an upper limit of 44 years of age to exclude patients with COPD-patients. Results and conclusions: There are large variations in costs of pharmaceuticals for asthma treatment between primary care centers in Stockholm as well as between different Swedish regions. Asthma severity explains {{only a small part of}} the variations in pharmaceutical costs and does not account for the differences between centers. When different approaches used to classify severity were tested, no strategy tested strategies was superior. Adherence to guidelines is low among caregivers. There is room for improvement of both asthma control and quality of life of asthma patients treated in primary care.

40|$|In {{an effort}} to improve patient {{outcomes}} and reduce resource use and costs associated with asthma care, asthma disease management programmes have now gained momentum. If a programme is to be effective, the identification of goals and outcomes relevant to the target populations is essential. These may include strategies aimed at reducing the use of resources, improving patient symptom scores and quality-of-life measures, or normalising pulmonary function. Methods to measure such outcomes should be developed in the design phase of the programme. The best practice model for asthma care incorporates a multidisciplinary approach, using asthma care specialists, case managers, primary care physicians and nurse educators to target `high-risk' asthmatics. The key interventions include incorporating clinical pathways developed from evidence-based guidelines, patient education and removal of obstacles to care and adherence.

The economic burden resulting from drug-related morbidity and mortality is equally significant and has been conservatively estimated at $US 30 billion dollars annually, and could exceed $US 130 billion in a worst-case scenario. Since many adverse drug events are considered preventable, increased efforts should be made to avoid classes of drugs that are problem-prone and to initiate diligent monitoring of drugs with predictable toxicities. Programmes should also be implemented that improve medication use practices within institutions. Although nearly all drugs are capable of producing an injury, certain drugs are more likely to do so.

40|$|Objective:The primary {{objective}} was to evaluate the relationship between willingness-to-pay (WTP), quality-of-life (QOL), and disease-severity measures in patients with asthma. The hypothesis studied was that patients with asthma with more severe disease {{are willing to pay}} more for a hypothetical cure of asthma than those with less severe disease. Design setting/Patients and participants: One hundred patients with asthma were recruited from community pharmacies in Kentucky for 30 -minute face-to-face interviews. Interventions: Spirometry assessed objective disease severity in terms of pulmonary function, while a multiple choice question measured subjective disease severity. The Medical Outcomes Study 36 -item Short Form (SF- 36) health survey and Asthma Technology of Patient Experience (Asthma TyPE) measured quality of life. WTP was obtained via a dichotomous choice contingent valuation question. Results: In this exploratory evaluation, WTP was significantly related to both objective disease severity (p = 0. 02) and subjectively assessed disease severity (p = 0. 01). For objective disease severity the mean monthly WTP was $US 90 for mild asthma, $US 131 for moderate asthma and $US 331 for severe asthma and for subjective disease severity the mean monthly WTP was $US 48 for mild asthma, $US 166 for moderate asthma and $US 241 for severe asthma. Conclusions: The results suggest that the WTP for a cure from asthma is related to both objective and subjective disease severity.

The actual dose required to produce bronchodilation was not known so comparison was made by testing various concentration of drug extract of Cassia tora L. The modified physiological salt solution containing hydroalcoholic extract of Cassia tora (1. 5 mg/ml) significantly inhibited the contractile effect of histamine thus produces significant bronchodilation. It is concluded that 1500 µg/ml of Cassia tora showed potent <b>antiasthmatic</b> activity due to bronchodilator activity...|$|E
40|$|Various {{extracts}} of Tectona grandis Linn. bark {{were screened}} for <b>antiasthmatic</b> activity by using different invivo animal models like clonidine induced catalepsy, haloperidol induced catalepsy, milk induced leucocytosis and eosinophilia. The observation {{of this study}} indicated that the Tectona grandis bark having antihistaminic activity inhibited clonidine-induced catalepsy and not inhibited haloperidol-induced catalepsy. The results of these studies indicated that ethyl acetate extract of Tectona grandis Linn. Bark showed significant (p< 0. 001) <b>antiasthmatic</b> activity at the dose of 100 mg/kg. The anti-asthmatic activity of ethyl acetate extract {{can be attributed to}} antihistaminic (H 1 -antagonist), antimuscarinic, antiallergic, antiinflammatory and adaptogenic activity suggestive of its potential in management of asthma...|$|E
40|$|Disease management, a new {{treatment}} model that may improve outcomes {{for patients with}} chronic illness, emphasises the need for formal assessments often not included in traditional approaches to healthcare, such as environmental exposures, self-care skills and functional status. This article discusses {{the importance of these}} measures in designing a disease management programme for asthma and presents the results of a study of patients referred to this programme. The objectives of the programme were to determine: 1. baseline functional status 2. any barriers to treatment 3. home exposure to patient-reported asthma triggers; and 4. patients' self-care skills. The proportion of referred patients who actually enrolled in the programme and, among those patients, the proportion who completed the prescribed educational component and attended the scheduled follow-up visits were also calculated. The investigators developed a structured assessment battery that included standardised measures of functioning; this battery was administered by clinical and research staff at enrolment and at 3 - and 6 -month follow-up. The patients (n = 228) had significantly lower functioning compared with the Medical Outcomes Study general US population norms and for patients with chronic lung disease. 71 % (n = 127) of patients endorsed 1 or more of the 3 items on a depression screen. 85. 5 % of patients completed the 3 educational sessions; 104 of 228 patients (45. 6 %) returned for the 6 -month follow-up visit. This study contributes data about the design of disease management programmes and about asthma in inner city and minority patients, which are important topics in current research.

40|$|Asthma is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} disorder of the airways, affecting about 10 % {{of children and}} 5 to 7 % of the adult population. Improved asthma control will not only benefit the patient but will also result in reduced financial expenditure in asthma healthcare. This article summarises the tools that are available for assessing asthma and attempts to quantify the usefulness of each tool in assessing asthma in different clinical contexts, whether it be screening for asthmatics within a population, diagnosing asthma in an individual, influencing management or judging outcome. The overall role of the symptoms of asthma, lung function variables, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, atopy and biological markers of inflammation, {{as well as their}} application in various settings is summarised in tabulated form. Flow charts are presented proposing sequential testing in the screening and diagnostic procedures. Intervention and treatment strategies for the individual are subsequently considered. Prevention should be the start of the intervention, educating the patient to enhance disease knowledge and avoidance of environmental triggers ideally resulting in a change in behaviour, to which teaching programmes may contribute. Since the recognition that asthma is an inflammatory disorder resulting in variable and reversible airflow obstruction, inhaled corticosteroids have become the mainstay treatment, with inhaled bronchodilators to be prescribed on an as-needed basis. Recently the long-acting beta 2 -agonist bronchodilators {{have been shown to be}} especially effective in treating nocturnal symptoms and together with inhaled corticosteroids achieve better control of asthma. Considering the complex nature of the asthmatic inflammatory process, respiratory symptoms, lung function variables and biomarkers are presently used as complementary outcome measures; the frequency of assessment will depend on practical considerations.

40|$|Background: Internship is the {{intermediate}} period between under-graduation and general practice. The dexterity of health professional relies upon prescribing practices. Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics (CPT) {{is a crucial}} discipline for interns to acquire safe and rational prescription of drugs. Cultivating sound knowledge about CPT during under graduation is, henceforth, mandatory. Aims and objectives: 1. To assess whether the undergraduate CPT teaching and internship training had prepared interns adequately for safe and rational prescription. 2. To assess the awareness and reporting of adverse drug reaction (ADR). Methods: 110 interns were enrolled after obtaining informed written consent. A structured questionnaire was given to them including basic demographic information, undergraduate CPT teaching, experience of ADR and any deficiency in the under-graduate CPT teaching. Results: Response rate was 91 % in which 53 were males and 47 females. 81 considered themselves aware of CPT. 56 % & 57 % interns were able to prescribe drug safely and rationally respectively. Without supervision, they were confident to prescribe antacids (93 %), vitamins and minerals (90 %), NSAIDS (85 %), antihistamines (82 %), antibiotics (75 %), antiemetics (62 %) and <b>antiasthmatics</b> (52 %). Only 22 % had reported ADR and opined that {{it could lead to}} hospitalization (51 %), prolonged hospital stay (33 %), morbidity (16 %) and death (21 %). According to interns, the topics where more emphasis needed were ADR, dosage calculation, pediatric and emergency medicine and therapeutic drug monitoring during undergraduate CPT teaching. Conclusion: CPT teaching should be improved at undergraduate level for safe and rational prescribing including ADR monitoring, ADR reporting and dosage calculation.
