50|$|Racetams, such as piracetam, oxiracetam, and <b>aniracetam,</b> are {{structurally}} similar compounds, {{which are}} often marketed as cognitive enhancers and sold over-the-counter.

The racetams have poorly understood mechanisms of action; however, piracetam and <b>aniracetam</b> are known to act as positive allosteric modulators of AMPA receptors and appear to modulate cholinergic systems.|$|E
50|$|The parent {{compound}} {{in which the}} AMPA modulating activity was first characterised was the well known nootropic drug <b>aniracetam.</b> Several drugs in the racetam family have been reported as producing ampakine effects, but while this has been well established for some compounds such as <b>aniracetam</b> and pramiracetam, it is unclear {{if all of the}} racetam family act in this way, as the racetam drugs appear to have multiple modes of action.|$|E
50|$|Nicoracetam {{is a drug}} {{from the}} racetam family. It shares some {{structural}} similarities with <b>aniracetam,</b> but differs in {{that it has a}} methoxypyridine group in place of aniracetam's methoxyphenyl group.|$|E
50|$|PEPA is an ampakine drug {{which acts}} as an {{allosteric}} potentiator of AMPA receptor desensitisation, which is up to 100x more potent than <b>aniracetam</b> in vitro. It produces memory-enhancing effects in rats when administered intravenously.|$|E

50|$|There is no universally {{accepted}} {{mechanism of action}} for racetams. Racetams generally show negligible affinity for common central nervous system receptors, but modulation of central neurotransmitters, including acetylcholine and glutamate, has been reported. Although <b>aniracetam</b> and nebracetam show affinity for muscarinic receptors, only nefiracetam demonstrates nanomolar interactions. Modification of membrane-located mechanisms of central signal transduction is another hypothesis.|$|E
50|$|Many {{modifications}} of pyrrolidine {{are found in}} natural and synthetic chemistry. The pyrrolidine ring structure is present in numerous natural alkaloids such as nicotine and hygrine. It is found in many drugs such as procyclidine and bepridil.

50|$|IDRA-21 shows {{nootropic}} {{effects in}} animal studies, significantly improving learning and memory. It is around 10-30 times more potent than <b>aniracetam</b> in reversing cognitive deficits induced by alprazolam or scopolamine, and produces sustained effects lasting {{for up to}} 48 hours after a single dose. The mechanism for this action {{is thought to be}} through promoting the induction of long-term potentiation between synapses in the brain.|$|E
40|$|The {{nootropic}} drug, <b>aniracetam,</b> behaves as {{a positive}} modulator of AMPA-sensitive glutamate receptors {{in a variety of}} systems, including intact brain tissue, amphibian oocytes injected with rat brain mRNA, and cultured neurons. In electrophysiological studies, <b>aniracetam</b> both increases the peak amplitude and reduces the rate of decay of the ion current generated by AMPA or quisqualate. In cultured neurons, <b>aniracetam</b> (as well as oxiracetam and piracetam) enhances the stimulation of 45 Ca 2 + influx produced by AMPA but not that produced by kainate or NMDA. In addition, <b>aniracetam</b> (as other nootropic drugs) increases the maximal density of low affinity binding sites for [3 H]AMPA in crude synaptic membranes. Positive modulation of AMPA receptors by <b>aniracetam</b> provides a novel molecular substrate which explains the clinical efficacy of nootropic drugs as memory and cognition enhancers...|$|E
40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{community}} of individuals who self-administer the nootropic <b>aniracetam</b> for its purported cognitive enhancing effects. <b>Aniracetam</b> {{is believed to be}} therapeutically useful for enhancing cognition, alleviating anxiety, and treating various neurodegenerative conditions. Physiologically, <b>aniracetam</b> enhances both glutamatergic neurotransmission and long-term potentiation. Previous studies of <b>aniracetam</b> have demonstrated the cognition-restoring effects of acute administration in different models of disease. No previous studies have explored the effects of <b>aniracetam</b> in healthy subjects. We investigated whether daily 50 mg/kg oral administration improves cognitive performance in naïve C 57 BL/ 6 J mice in a variety of aspects of cognitive behavior. We measured spatial learning in the Morris water maze test; associative learning in the fear conditioning test; motor learning in the accelerating rotarod test; and odor discrimination. We also measured locomotion in the open field test, anxiety through the elevated plus maze test and by measuring time {{in the center of the}} open field test. We measured repetitive behavior through the marble burying test. We detected no significant differences between the naive, placebo, and experimental groups across all measures. Despite several studies demonstrating efficacy in impaired subjects, our findings suggest that <b>aniracetam</b> does not alter behavior in normal healthy mice. This study is timely in light of the growing community of healthy humans self-administering nootropic drugs...|$|E
40|$|<b>Aniracetam</b> is a {{nootropic}} {{drug that}} {{has been shown to}} selectively enhance quisqualate receptor-mediated responses in Xenopus oocytes injected with brain mRNA and in hippocampal pyramidal cells [Ito, I., Tanabe, S., Kohda, A. & Sugiyama, H. (1990) J. Physiol. (London) 424, 533 - 544]. We have used patch clamp recording techniques in hippocampal slices to elucidate the mechanism for this selective action. We find that <b>aniracetam</b> enhances glutamate-evoked currents in whole-cell recordings and, in outside-out patches, strongly reduces glutamate receptor desensitization. In addition, <b>aniracetam</b> selectively prolongs the time course and increases the peak amplitude of fast synaptic currents. These findings indicate that <b>aniracetam</b> slows the kinetics of fast synaptic transmission and are consistent with the proposal [Trussell, L. O. & Fischbach, G. D. (1989) Neuron 3, 209 - 218; Tang, C. -M., Dichter, M. & Morad, M. (1989) Science 243, 1474 - 1477] that receptor desensitization governs the strength of fast excitatory synaptic transmission in the brain...|$|E
40|$|In {{addition}} to the acute pathology produced by traumatic brain injury, there are chronic alterations that occur after the trauma, including a depressed state of neuronal activity (Feeney, 1991). This study included a preclinical testing of a novel treatment strategy focusing on increasing neuronal activity during the chronic hypofunctional posttraumatic stage. The present investigation tested the effects of repeated post-injury <b>aniracetam</b> administration on cognitive performance in the Morris water maze (MWM) and on the GluR 2 - immunoreactivity and protein expression by Western blot analysis in the hippocampus. The first study examined the optimal dose of <b>aniracetam</b> in the MWM task. Animals received <b>aniracetam</b> (25 mg/kg, 50 mg/kg) or vehicle once daily for fifteen days and on days 11 - 15 were tested in the MWM. The results indicated that injured aniracetam-treated rats had a significant improvement in MWM performance compared to injured saline-treated animals. When the drug was delayed for 11 days post-injury in the second experiment, its beneficial effects were still present, as injured aniracetam-treated rats performed significantly better that injured saline treated rats on the MWM task. In the third experiment, chronic daily <b>aniracetam</b> administration was terminated after 15 days immediately before MWM testing on days 16 - 20. The results indicated that termination of <b>aniracetam</b> did not enhance MWM performance as injured terminated aniracetam-treated rats did not have significant improvement over injured saline-treated rats. In the fourth study we investigated the mechanism of <b>aniracetam</b> 2 ̆ 7 s effects by examining {{the expression of the}} AMPA receptor GluR 2 subunit, the only AMPA receptor subunit that is Ca++ impermeable. Using a monoclonal antibody selective for the GluR 2 subunit, immunohistochemical results indicated that injured rats treated with <b>aniracetam</b> (50 mg/kg for 15 days post-injury) had a slight reduction in the GluR 2 - IR. The fifth study investigated a change in the GluR 2 protein expression in the hippocampus with a Western blot analysis. The results were consistent with the immunohistochemical study outcome as the injured vehicle and injured <b>aniracetam</b> treated animals showed a reduced protein expression in the hippocampus. The changes were not significantly different from the controls. The results of these experiments suggested that chronic <b>aniracetam</b> treatment significantly attenuated injury induced spatial memory deficits when administered continually during the hypofunctional posttraumatic stage and when the treatment was delayed for 11 days, but not when the treatment was terminated before the MWM testing. These effects suggest that the compound does not induce chronic receptor changes and has to be biologically active in an organism for it to exert its beneficial properties. Results from the present studies suggest that <b>aniracetam</b> may become a potential treatment option for brain injury induced cognitive deficits...|$|E
40|$|We report here on {{the ability}} of IDRA 21 and <b>aniracetam,</b> two {{negative}} allosteric modulators of glutamate-induced DL-alpha-amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methyl- 4 -isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor desensitization, to attenuate alprazolam-induced learning deficit in patas monkeys working in a complex behavioral task. In one component of a multiple schedule (repeated acquisition or "learning"), patas monkeys acquired a different four-response chain each session by responding sequentially on three keys in the presence of four discriminative stimuli (geometric forms or numerals). In the other component (performance) the four-response chain was the same each session. The response chain in each component was maintained by food presentation under a fixed-ratio schedule. When alprazolam (0. 1 or 0. 32 mg/kg p. o.) was administered alone, this full allosteric modulator of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors produced large decreases in the response rate and accuracy in the learning component of the task. IDRA 21 (3 or 5. 6 mg/kg p. o.) and <b>aniracetam</b> (30 mg/kg p. o.) administered 60 min before alprazolam, having no effect when given alone, antagonized the large disruptive effects of alprazolam on learning. From dose-response studies, it can be estimated that IDRA 21 is approximately 10 -fold more potent than <b>aniracetam</b> in antagonizing alprazolam-induced learning deficit. We conclude that IDRA 21, a chemically unrelated pharmacological congener of <b>aniracetam,</b> improves learning deficit induced in patas monkeys by the increase of GABAergic tone elicited by alprazolam. Very likely IDRA 21 exerts its behavioral effects by antagonizing AMPA receptor desensitization...|$|E
40|$|The in vivo and {{in vitro}} effect of oxiracetam, <b>aniracetam</b> and alpha-glicerylphosphorylcholine (alphaGPC) on protein kinase C (PKC) {{activity}} was studied in rat brain cortex and hippocampus. Administration of oxiracetam and alphaGPC in vivo elicited an early increase of particulate histone-directed PKC activity {{accompanied by a}} decrease of soluble activity and followed {{a few hours later}} by a down regulation of the enzyme. The effect was also observed in vitro when either oxiracetam or alphaGPC were administered at nanomolar concentrations to rat brain cortex slices. <b>Aniracetam</b> had no effect in the cortex but promoted PKC translocation both in vivo and in vitro in the hippocampus. In cortex slices the effect of oxiracetam was antagonized by the addition of AP- 5, an NMDA receptor blocker, but not by CNQX and L-AP 3, antagonists of AMPA and metabotropic glutamate receptors, respectively. Scopolamine also prevented the increase of particulate PKC elicited by oxiracetam in vitro. In the hippocampus the increase of particulate PKC activity was antagonized by AP- 5, CNQX and L-AP 3, indicating participation by both ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors in the action of <b>aniracetam.</b> The data support the hypothesis that PKC activation may be a common mechanism amongst cognition stimulating drugs from different chemical classes...|$|E
40|$|Micromolar {{concentrations}} of piracetam, <b>aniracetam,</b> and oxiracetam enhanced alpha-amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methyl- 4 -isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) -stimulated 45 Ca 2 + influx in primary cultures of cerebellar granule cells. Nootropic drugs increased the efficacy {{but not the}} potency of AMPA and their action persisted {{in the presence of}} the voltage-sensitive calcium channel blocker nifedipine. Potentiation by oxiracetam was specific for AMPA receptor-mediated signal transduction, as the drug changed neither the stimulation of 45 Ca 2 + influx by kainate or N-methyl-D-aspartate nor the activation of inositol phospholipid hydrolysis elicited by quisqualate or (+-) - 1 -aminocyclopentane-trans- 1, 3 -dicarboxylic acid. Piracetam, <b>aniracetam,</b> and oxiracetam increased the maximal density of the specific binding sites for [3 H]AMPA in synaptic membranes from rat cerebral cortex. Taken collectively, these results support the view that nootropic drugs act as positive modulators of AMPA-sensitive glutamate receptors in neurons...|$|E
40|$|Objective：To {{observe the}} effect {{and explore the}} {{mechanism}} of Huannao Yicong capsule in treating senile patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Methods：The investigational drugs were packed by blind method. A randomized, double-blind and controlled trial was conducted on ninety senile patients with MCI. Other forty-five senile healthy persons were recruited to the healthy control group. The ninety senile patients were randomly divided into the Huannao Yicong capsule-treated group (45 patients administered with three Huannao Yicong capsules and two <b>aniracetam</b> capsule analogues) and aniracetam-treated group (45 patients treated with two <b>aniracetam</b> capsules and three Huannao Yicong capsule analogues). Patients {{in the two groups}} were treated three times daily for 16 weeks. Memory, traditional Chinese medicine syndrome, cerebral blood flow, free radicals and inflammatory mediators, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), acetylcholinesterase (AchE), interleukin- 1 α (IL- 1 α) and interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) were determined before and after the treatment. Blood lipids, including triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), apolipoprotein A- 1 (ApoA- 1) and apolipoprotein B- 100 (ApoB- 100), were detected before and after the treatment. The safety indexes, such as routine tests of blood and urine, hepatic and renal function tests and electrocardiogram (ECG) were taken before and after the treatment. Results：Index score of clinical memory scale in senile healthy people was significantly higher than that in MCI patients before treatment (P＜ 0. 01), and the content of AchE, IL- 1 α and IL- 6 was obviously lower (P＜ 0. 01, P＜ 0. 05), the activity of SOD was higher (P＜ 0. 05). No significant difference was found in direction memory of clinical memory scale between the two treatment groups. Other index scores of clinical memory scale and traditional Chinese medicine syndrome in patients of Huannao Yicong capsule-treated group were significantly improved as compared with those of the aniracetam-treated group (P＜ 0. 05, P＜ 0. 01). The blood flow parameters of anterior cerebral artery, posterior cerebral artery and resistant index in patients of Huannao Yicong capsule-treated group were increased significantly (P＜ 0. 01, P＜ 0. 05). Huannao Yicong capsule could significantly increase the activity of serum SOD and decrease the content of AchE, IL- 1 α and IL- 6 (P＜ 0. 01, P＜ 0. 05), better than <b>aniracetam.</b> Furthermore, Huannao Yicong capsule could significantly improve the blood lipid, such as the level of TG, LDL-C, HDL-C, ApoA- 1 and ApoB- 100 (P＜ 0. 01, P＜ 0. 05), and better than <b>aniracetam</b> (P＜ 0. 01, P＜ 0. 05). No significant changes were found after treatment in safety indexes, such as routine tests of blood and urine, hepatic and renal function tests and ECG. Conclusion: Huannao Yicong capsule has better therapeutic effect than <b>aniracetam</b> capsule in treating senile mild cognitive impairment...|$|E
40|$|What {{determines the}} {{amplitude}} {{and the time}} course of spontaneous excitatory unitary events is not well understood. Desensitization of fast AMPA/K channels {{has been shown to be}} fast enough to shorten individual quantal responses. However, it is not known whether the desensitization is uniform nor is it known what determines the relation between amplitude and rise or decay times in absence of desensitization. Both the rise and the decay times are essentially amplitude-independent in control conditions, but become markedly amplitude-dependent after desensitization has been suppressed by <b>aniracetam.</b> Strong amplitude-dependence of the rise and decay times suggests that in absence of desensitization the process(es) that determine(s) {{the time course of}} unitary events is/are concentration-dependent. Highly nonuniform, and strongly amplitude-dependent desensitization can be explained by its concentration dependence. The scatter of both rise and decay times about the best fitting lines was also amplitude-independent in control conditions. It increased markedly and in an amplitude-dependent manner after addition of <b>aniracetam.</b> The same factors that determine mean values probably determine the scatter as well...|$|E
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of BR- 16 A, a herbal psychotropic preparation, {{was investigated in}} short-term memory paradigms in mice. The passive avoidance task consisted of an electric grid with a centrally located shock-free zone (SFZ). BR- 16 A (50 - 500 mg/kg) improved passive avoidance acquisition as well as retrieval in mice. BR- 16 A reversed scopolamine (0. 3 mg/kg) -induced disruption of learning and memory. Physostigmine (0. 5 mg/kg) enhanced the {{effectiveness of}} BR- 16 A (50 and 100 mg/kg) against scopolamine-induced deficits. The amnesia-induced by acute treatment with electroconvulsive shock (ECS) was also significantly reversed by BR- 16 A (50 and 100 mg/kg). When administered in combination with GABA (50 mg/kg) and <b>aniracetam,</b> respectively BR- 16 A (50 mg/kg) treated mice showed improved learning and memory retrieval. In another model, using transfer latency as a parameter employing elevated plus-maze, similar observations were recorded in scopolamine-treated mice following administration of BR- 16 A along or its combination with <b>aniracetam.</b> The results suggest for a possibly nootropic action of BR- 16 A involving cholinergic and GABAergic modulation...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{addressed}} {{the effects of}} sleep deprivation (SD) on AMPA receptor (AMPAR) binding in brain regions associated with learning and memory, and investigated whether treatment with drugs acting on AMPAR could prevent passive avoidance deficits in sleep deprived animals. [(3) H]AMPA binding and GluR 1 in situ hybridization signals were quantified in different brain regions of male Wistar rats either immediately after 96 h of sleep deprivation or after 24 h of sleep recovery following 96 h of sleep deprivation. Another group of animals were sleep deprived and then treated with either the AMPAR potentiator, <b>aniracetam</b> (25, 50 and 100 mg/kg, acute administration) or the AMPAR antagonist GYKI- 52466 (5 and 10 mg/kg, acute and chronic administration) before passive avoidance training. Task performance was evaluated 2 h and 24 h after training. A significant reduction in [(3) H]AMPA binding {{was found in the}} hippocampal formation of SD animals, while no alterations were observed in GluR 1 mRNA levels. The highest dose of <b>aniracetam</b> (100 mg/kg) reverted SD-induced impairment of passive avoidance performance in both retention tests, whereas GYKI- 52466 treatment had no effect. Pharmacological enhancement of AMPAR function may revert hippocampal-dependent learning impairments produced after SD.

The seizures were evoked {{by means of}} auditory stimulation (109 dB, 12 - 16 kHz) in animals placed singly under a hemispheric Perspex dome. The 2, 3 -benzodiazepines studied after 30 min pretreatment were generally less potent than the related derivative 1 -(4 -aminophenyl) - 4 -methyl- 7, 8 -methylenedioxy- 5 H- 2, 3 -benzodiazepine hydrochloride (GYKI 52466) except 3, 5 -dihydro- 7, 8 -dimethoxy- 1 -phenyl- 4 H- 2, 3 -benzodiazepin- 4 -one (2, 3 -BZ- 2) and 2, 3 -BZ- 2 M (3 -methyl derivative of 2, 3 -BZ- 2) which showed comparable activity. Thirty minutes after i. p. administration of 2, 3 -benzodiazepines, the rank order of potency for anticonvulsant activity against clonus was 2, 3 -BZ- 2 > GYKI 52466 > 2, 3 -BZ- 2 M > 2, 3 -BZ- 1 > 2, 3 -BZ- 3, > 2, 3 -OBZ- 1, > 2, 3 -OBZ- 2 2, 3 -OBZ- 3. The intracerebroventricular (i. c. v.) injection of <b>aniracetam</b> on it own (12. 5 - 100 nmol/mouse) had no convulsant activity, but it reversed the anticonvulsant effects of some 2, 3 -benzodiazepines. In particular, the pharmacological actions of GYKI 52466, 2, 3 -BZ- 2 and 2, 3 -BZ- 2 M, which {{proved to be the}} most potent 2, 3 -benzodiazepine derivatives as anticonvulsants, were significantly reduced by an i. c. v. pretreatment with <b>aniracetam</b> (50 nmol/mouse). Concomitant treatment with <b>aniracetam</b> (50 nmol/mouse) shifted to the right the dose-response curves and significantly increased the ED 50 values for GYKI 52466, 2, 3 -BZ- 2 and 2, 3 -BZ- 2 M. After 30 min pretreatment 2, 3 -BZ- 2 showed a similar potency to GYKI 52466 in antagonizing seizures induced by i. c. v. administration of alpha-amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methyl- 4 -isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA), thus suggesting a clear involvement of AMPA receptors in the anticonvulsant activity of these compounds.

40|$|Glutamate is {{the major}} {{excitatory}} neurotransmitter in the brain. Amongst ionotropic receptors responding to glutamate, the AMPA subtype has been considered as essential for the fast excitatory neurotransmission in {{the central nervous system}} and the expression and maintenance of long-term potentiation. As glutamate is known to be involved in many neurological and psychiatric disorders, AMPA receptors seem to represent interesting targets to develop therapeutic drugs. Hence, the enhancement of AMPA signals is an approach currently investigated for the management of Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia or mood disorders. In particular, many efforts are being conducted in the development of AMPA positive allosteric modulators ("potentiators"), which alter the rate of receptor desensitization.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{believed}} that nootropic (cognition-enhancing) agents produce their therapeutic effects by augmenting excitatory synaptic transmission in cortical circuits, primarily through positive modulation of a-amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methyl- 4 -isoxazole-propionate receptors (AMPARs). However, GABA-mediated inhibition is also critical for cognition, and enhanced GABA function may be likewise therapeutic for cognitive disorders. Could nootropics act through such a mechanism as well? To address this question, we {{examined the effects of}} nootropic agents on excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs and IPSCs) recorded from layer V pyramidal cells in acute slices of somatosensory cortex. <b>Aniracetam,</b> a positive modulator of AMPA/kainate receptors, increased the peak amplitude of evoked EPSCs and the amplitude and duration of polysynaptic fast IPSCs, manifested as a greater total charge carried by IPSCs.
