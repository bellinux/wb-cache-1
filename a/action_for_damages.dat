25|$|There {{are certain}} {{conditions}} precedent, or defenses, to a recovery of damages for a person's failure to testify, or to provide documents pertinent to a hearing or trial. There {{must be a}} breach of testimonial duty, after having been properly served with a legitimately executed subpoena. There must be a demonstration of actual damages incurred from the absence of testimony. Most courts have rejected the arguments for seeking damages {{in this kind of}} case. Giving false testimony in a judicial proceeding even though the allegation is made that the person giving the testimony knew it to be false, does not give rise, either at common law or by statute, to a civil <b>action</b> <b>for</b> <b>damages,</b> resulting from such testimony. The situation is probably different if intentionally false documents are submitted under a subpoena duces tecum.|$|E
25|$|Chile {{approved}} {{class actions}} in 2004. The Chilean model is technically an opt-out issue class action {{followed by a}} compensatory stage which can be collective or individual. This means that the class action is designed to declare the defendant generally liable with erga omnes effects {{if and only if}} the defendant is found liable, and the declaratory judgment can be used then to pursue damages in the same procedure or in individual ones in different jurisdictions. If the latter is the case, the liability cannot be discussed but only the damages. There under the Chilean procedural rules, one particular case works as an opt-out class <b>action</b> <b>for</b> <b>damages.</b> This is the case when defendants can identify and compensate consumer directly, i.e. because it is their banking institution. In such cases the judge can skip the compensatory stage and order redress directly. Since 2005 more than 100 cases have been filed, mostly by Servicio Nacional del Consumidor , the Chilean consumer protection agency. Salient cases have been the case Condecus v. BancoEstado, and SERNAC v. La Polar.|$|E

While such a person would previously have had to take out a legal <b>action</b> <b>for</b> <b>damages</b> separately from any judicial review proceedings, since May 2011 it has been possible for a person who has successfully obtained prerogative orders or a declaration to ask the High Court to also award him or her [...] "relevant relief", that is, a liquidated sum, damages, equitable relief or restitution.

[...] In this case the plaintiff had made a bailment to the defendant to keep goods for him. [...] The defendant's bailee had used and damaged them, [...] This action was thought to be similar to trespass, since the bailees had no right {{to the use of the}} chattels, but it was not a trespass since there was no interference with the chattels while they were in the possession of the plaintiff.

40|$|There are {{numerous}} reasons why private enforcement of E. U. competition law remains underdeveloped in Europe. The main reason is perhaps {{that it is}} not regulated by E.

A system that creates optimal conditions for individuals to challenge infringements of competition rules before national courts ensures a high level of compliance.

2500|$|In {{addition}} to his institutional appointments, Whitehead was sometimes called upon {{to be an expert}} witness in court cases relating to medicine, examples of which include an action in 1896 against a known quack who claimed specialism in the treatment of hernias, and Thomas vs. Barker (an <b>action</b> <b>for</b> <b>damages</b> against Herbert Atkinson Barker, the bonesetter, in 1911). In 1911, Whitehead referred again to this latter case in an article published in The English Review. In this he appealed for an investigation by the medical profession into the potential for adoption of some of the methods used by bonesetters. He said that these people had traditionally been viewed by the profession, including himself, as [...] "anathema" [...] and [...] "technically unqualified" [...] but that Barker's case had demonstrated that there was good cause to investigate their methods and successes rather than be [...] "blinded by professional prejudices".|$|E
2500|$|The constitutions of some jurisdictions have clauses {{stating that}} the court may provide redress to those whose rights {{have been shown to}} be violated. The Privy Council has held that such clauses empower the court to grant damages (monetary compensation) vindicating the {{constitutional}} right that has been contravened to [...] "reflect the sense of public outrage, emphasise the importance of the constitutional right and the gravity of the breach, and deter further breaches". However, no clause of this nature exists in the Singapore Constitution. Since in Singapore the granting of damages is outside the ambit of judicial review in administrative law, the same is probably true for a breach of the Constitution. In order to claim damages, an aggrieved person must be able to establish a private law claim in contract or tort law.
