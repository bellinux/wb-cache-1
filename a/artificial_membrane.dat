25|$|Santelli et al. {{explained}} {{more about}} the process after they determined the crystal structure of the PA/CMG2 complex. The structure of this complex shows the binding of CMG2 by both domain 2 and 4 of PA. This interaction demonstrates less freedom to unfold the Greek key. Further analysis shows that seven of the nine histidines in PA are on the domain 2/domain 4 interface. Protonation of these histidines causes the domains to separate enough to allow the Greek-key to flop out and help form the β-hairpin involved in insertion. In addition, when PA binds to CMG2, insertion no longer occurs at a pH of 6.5, as it does when inserted into an <b>artificial</b> <b>membrane.</b> Instead it requires a pH of 5.0 for insertion in natural cells. This difference was explained {{to be the result}} of the pocket next to the MIDAS motif in CMG2. This pocket contains a histidine buried at the bottom where domain 2 attaches. This histidine is protonated at a lower pH and adds greater stability to PA. This added stability keeps the Greek-key from being able to move until more acidic conditions are met. These histidines all work in conjunction to keep the heptamer from inserting prematurely before endocytosis occurs.|$|E
60|$|He found a {{monoplane}} {{in charge}} of an aeronaut awaiting him on the westward stage. Seen close this mechanism was no longer small. As it lay on its launching carrier upon the wide expanse of the flying stage, its aluminum body skeleton was {{as big as the}} hull of a twenty-ton yacht. Its lateral supporting sails braced and stayed with metal nerves almost like the nerves of a bee's wing, and made of some sort of glassy <b>artificial</b> <b>membrane,</b> cast their shadow over many hundreds of square yards. The chairs for the engineer and his passenger hung free to swing by a complex tackle, within the protecting ribs of the frame and well abaft the middle. The passenger's chair was protected by a wind-guard and guarded about with metallic rods carrying air cushions. It could, if desired, be completely closed in, but Graham was anxious for novel experiences, and desired that it should be left open. The aeronaut sat behind a glass that sheltered his face. The passenger could secure himself firmly in his seat, and this was almost unavoidable on landing, or he could move along by means of a little rail and rod to a locker at the stem of the machine, where his personal luggage, his wraps and restoratives were placed, and which also with the seats, served as a makeweight to the parts of the central engine that projected to the propeller at the stern.|$|E

5000|$|In {{medicinal}} chemistry, parallel <b>artificial</b> <b>membrane</b> permeability assay (PAMPA) is {{a method}} which determines the permeability of substances from a donor compartment, through a lipid-infused <b>artificial</b> <b>membrane</b> into an acceptor compartment. [...] A multi-well microtitre plate {{is used for the}} donor and a membrane/acceptor compartment is placed on top; the whole assembly is commonly referred to as a “sandwich”. At the beginning of the test, the drug is added to the donor compartment, and the acceptor compartment is drug-free. After an incubation period which may include stirring, the sandwich is separated and the amount of drug is measured in each compartment. Mass balance allows calculation of drug that remains in the membrane.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{existence}} of lipid rafts in live cells remains {{a topic of}} lively debate. Although large, micrometer-sized rafts are readily observed in <b>artificial</b> <b>membranes,</b> attempts to observe analogous domains in live cells place an upper limit of ∼ 5 nm on their size. We suggest that integral membrane proteins attached to the cytoskeleton act as obstacles that limit the size of lipid domains. Computer simulations of a binary lipid mixture show {{that the presence of}} protein obstacles at only 5 – 10 % by area dramatically reduces the tendency of the lipids to phase separate. These calculations emphasize the importance of spatial heterogeneity in cell membranes, which limits the transferability of conclusions drawn from <b>artificial</b> <b>membranes</b> to live cells...|$|R

5000|$|The carrier {{aggregate}} {{is composed}} {{of at least one}} amphiphat (such as phosphatidylcholine), which in aqueous solvents self-assembles into a lipid bilayer that closes into a simple lipid vesicle. By addition of at least one bilayer softening component (such as a biocompatible surfactant or an amphiphile drug) lipid bilayer flexibility and permeability are greatly increased. The resulting Transfersome is optimized for flexibility and permeability, and can therefore adapt its shape to ambient conditions easily and rapidly by adjusting local concentration of each bilayer component to the local stress experienced at the bilayer. Since its basic organization is broadly similar to a liposome, a Transfersome differs from more conventional vesicles primarily by its [...] "softer", more deformable, and better adjustable <b>artificial</b> <b>membrane.</b>|$|E

The interaction kinetics was imaged using time-lapse fluorescence lifetime imaging of a fluorescently-tagged melittin derivative. Interaction with the synthetic membranes resulted in membrane pore formation. In contrast, the interaction with bacteria led to transient membrane disruption and corresponding leakage of the cytoplasm, but surprisingly with a much reduced level of pore formation.

50|$|An <b>artificial</b> <b>membrane,</b> or {{synthetic}} membrane, is a synthetically created membrane {{which is}} usually intended for separation purposes in laboratory or in industry. Synthetic membranes have been successfully used for small and large-scale industrial processes {{since the middle of}} twentieth century. A wide variety of synthetic membranes is known. They can be produced from organic materials such as polymers and liquids, as well as inorganic materials. The most of commercially utilized synthetic membranes in separation industry are made of polymeric structures. They can be classified based on their surface chemistry, bulk structure, morphology, and production method. The chemical and physical properties of synthetic membranes and separated particles as well as a choice of driving force define a particular membrane separation process. The most commonly used driving forces of a membrane process in industry are pressure and concentration gradients. The respective membrane process is therefore known as filtration. Synthetic membranes utilized in a separation process can be of different geometry and of respective flow configuration. They can also be categorized based on their application and separation regime. The best known synthetic membrane separation processes include water purification, reverse osmosis, dehydrogenation of natural gas, removal of cell particles by microfiltration and ultrafiltration, removal of microorganisms from dairy products, and Dialysis.|$|E
