5|$|Parathyroid glands share {{a similar}} blood supply, venous {{drainage}}, and lymphatic drainage to the thyroid glands. Parathyroid glands {{are derived from}} the epithelial lining of {{the third and fourth}} branchial pouches, with the superior glands <b>arising</b> <b>from</b> the fourth pouch, and the inferior glands <b>arising</b> <b>from</b> the higher third pouch. The relative position of the inferior and superior glands, which are named according to their final location, changes because of the migration of embryological tissues.|$|E

5|$|Decompression {{sickness}} (DCS; {{also known}} as divers' disease, the bends or caisson disease) describes a condition <b>arising</b> <b>from</b> dissolved gases coming out of solution into bubbles inside the body on depressurisation.
