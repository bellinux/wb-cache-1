40|$|Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) {{extracts}} {{obtained from}} Treponema hyodysenteriae of serogroups A, B, D and E, and from T. innocens were examined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), silver-staining, and immunoblotting with hyperimmune rabbit sera. All organisms possessed multiple LPS bands, but their position and number differed. Immunoblotting of LPS with grouping sera identified {{three or four}} major antigenic LPS components in the 10 - 42 kDa range in all organisms: these components were largely specific to each type-organism of a serogroup, and presumably represented group antigens. Although some minor cross-reactivity occurred between LPS from organisms in the different groups, this was insufficient to merit changes to the current LPS serogrouping system for T. hyodysenteriae. Besides this LPS ‘complex’, other higher-molecular-weight material which {{appeared to be a}} common component of the treponemes examined was present in low concentrations. Organisms with different serotypes within a serogroup apparently possessed common LPS bands, but also had unique LPS bands which may account for their serotype specificity. One ‘untypable’ organism lacked group-specific LPS and was thought to be a mutant of a group B organism. The loss of serogroup LPS by the isolate suggested that this material is an external component of the cell wall.

40|$|Indole-positive {{members of}} the Proteeae usually have {{inducible}} expression of chromosomal beta-lactamases. Mutants with stably derepressed beta-lactamase expression occur in inducible populations at frequencies {{in the range of}} 10 (- 6) to 10 (- 8). The contribution of these beta-lactamases to drug resistance was examined in Morganella morganii and Proteus vulgaris. The M. morganii enzyme was a high-molecular-weight (49, 000) class I cephalosporinase with low Vmax rates for ampicillin, carbenicillin, and and broad-spectrum cephalosporins. The P. vulgaris enzyme had a lower molecular weight (32, 000) and high Vmax rates for ampicillin, cephaloridine, cefotaxime, and ceftriaxone. Imipenem and cefoxitin inactivated the P. vulgaris enzyme but were low-Vmax, low-Km substrates for that of M. morganii. Despite these differences, the two beta-lactamases caused similar resistance profiles. Ampicillin and cephaloridine were strong inducers for both species, and beta-lactamase-inducible strains and their stably derepressed mutants were resistant, whereas basal mutants (those with low-level uninducible beta-lactamase) were susceptible to these two compounds. Mezlocillin, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, and (usually) carbenicillin were almost equally active against beta-lactamase-inducible organisms and their basal mutants, but were less active against stably derepressed mutants. This behavior reflected the beta-lactamase lability of these drugs, coupled with their weak inducer activity below the MIC. Carbenicillin was a labile strong inducer for a single P. vulgaris strain, and inducible enzyme was protective against the drug in this <b>atypical</b> <b>organism.</b> Cefoxitin and imipenem, both strong inducers below the MIC, were almost equally active against beta-lactamase-inducible organisms and their basal and stably derepressed mutants...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{questions}} {{of whether the}} use of antibiotics that are active against <b>atypical</b> <b>organisms</b> is beneficial {{in the treatment of}} community-acquired pneumonia and of the potential mechanisms of any beneficial effects remain unresolved. Proposed mechanisms include activity against <b>atypical</b> <b>organisms</b> vs the immunomodulatory effects of these antibiotics. The study of outcomes of a large cohort of patients with bacteremic pneumonia provides a unique opportunity to address these questions by excluding patients with primary atypical infection. Methods: We reviewed data from the charts of 2, 209 Medicare patients who were admitted to hospitals across the United States from either home or a nursing facility with bacteremic pneumonia between 1998 and 2001. Patients were stratified according to the type of antibiotic treatment. Multivariate modeling was performed to assess the relationship between the class of antibiotic used and several outcome variables.

40|$|Purpose: To {{describe}} {{a case of}} fungal keratitis involving an <b>atypical</b> <b>organism</b> with confirmatory in vivo confocal microscopy and to review the literature on Rhodotorula keratitis. Methods: Case report and review of the medical literature. Results: A 22 -year-old college student was struck in the left eye with a tree branch and subsequently developed pain, redness and photophobia. Upon presentation, visual acuity was 20 / 200 {{and there was a}} large epithelial defect with diffuse stromal inflammation involving the anterior one-third of the cornea. Cultures of the infiltrate were performed for bacterial, viral and fungal organisms that resulted in a positive culture for Rhodotorula mucilaginosa. Fungal elements were confirmed in vivo by confocal microscopy. The patient was treated with voriconazole initially and had amphotericin added once Rhodotorula infection was confirmed. The patient responded well clinically, and one month after therapy was initiated, the corneal infiltrate had resolved leaving mild anterior stromal haze. Upon completion of therapy at three months, the patient was asymptomatic, had a clear cornea and had a best corrected visual acuity of 20 / 20 in the involved eye. There was no measurable change in his manifest refraction. Conclusions: Prior cases of Rhodotorula keratitis most often required surgical intervention and were associated with poor outcomes. This case shows that Rhodotorula keratitis can be successfully treated with topical antifungal agents if diagnosed early and appropriate treatment is initiated promptly. We report the first case of Rhodotorula keratitis confirmed by in vivo confocal microscopy. This is also the first description of pseudomycelium formation that has not been previously described in vivo, a morphological structure that this organism rarely demonstrates. Finally, this case shows that confocal microscopy may aid in the early diagnosis and management of fungal keratitis involving this rare but potentially damaging organism...|$|E

40|$|Community-acquired {{pneumonia}} (CAP) is {{a common}} cause {{of morbidity and mortality}} and is associated with the consumption of considerable health resources worldwide. Initial treatment of patients with CAP is often empirical. Growing concern about the increasing prevalence of <b>atypical</b> <b>organisms</b> is reflected in North American guidelines, which place considerable emphasis {{on the use of the}} macrolides. Azithromycin, the prototype azalide, is a macrolide derivative with a broad antimicrobial spectrum including enhanced activity against Haemophilus influenzae relative to erythromycin. Its distinctive pharmacokinetic profile is characterised by extensive and prolonged tissue distribution accompanied by low serum drug concentrations. An estimated tissue half-life of between 2 and 3 days enables the drug to be administered as a once daily, abbreviated regimen for the treatment of patients with CAP. This provides the drug with an advantage over other macrolides including erythromycin and clarithromycin, which require a longer treatment duration. However, the potential for prolonged subinhibitory tissue concentrations of azithromycin to promote the development of resistant microorganisms requires further evaluation. Clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of 3 - to 5 -day regimens of oral azithromycin (total dose 1. 5 g) in patients with CAP. These regimens were generally as effective as longer treatment durations with other commonly used antimicrobials including other macrolides and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. Importantly, azithromycin is well tolerated and is associated with a lower incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events than erythromycin. Azithromycin is also associated with fewer pharmacokinetic drug interactions than erythromycin or clarithromycin. According to US prescribing information, orally administered azithromycin is not recommended for use (presumably as monotherapy) in patients with moderate to severe pneumonia, bacteraemia or significant underlying health problems, or in elderly or debilitated patients. A recently developed intravenous formulation of azithromycin may be of value in some of these patients but this requires confirmation. Conclusion: Oral azithromycin is an attractive antimicrobial option in patients with mild CAP and has a role in both empirical therapy and pathogen-directed treatment against <b>atypical</b> <b>organisms.</b> However, its usefulness, as for other macrolides, may be limited in regions with a high prevalence of macrolide-resistant pneumococci. Particular benefits over erythromycin and some other macrolides include enhanced activity against Gram-negative pathogens, an improved tolerability profile, a once daily abbreviated treatment regimen (which may result in improved patient compliance) and few pharmacokinetic drug interactions. The development of an intravenous preparation may expand the use of azithromycin in patients with CAP requiring hospitalisation.

Clinical success and mortality were compared between different oral antibiotic classes, and antibacterials with atypical coverage (macrolides and fluoroquinolones) were specifically compared with other antibacterials. In total, 13 eligible studies involving a total of 4, 314 patients were included. The quality of the studies was variable. Five studied macrolides and fluoroquinolones, three macrolides and b-lactams, three fluoroquinolones and b-lactams and two cephalosporins versus b-lactams / b-lactamase inhibitors. No significant difference was detected regarding clinical success or mortality, regardless of atypical coverage or between antibacterial classes with similar atypical coverage. It was not possible to demonstrate any advantage of specific antibacterials for mild community-acquired pneumonia in relatively healthy outpatients. The need for coverage of atypical pathogens in this setting was not apparent. In mild-to-moderate cases of outpatient-treated community-acquired pneumonia, it might be most appropriate to select antibacterials according to side-effects, patient preferences, availability and cost...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the frequency of}} community-acquired respiratory pathogens with special focus on <b>atypical</b> <b>organisms</b> in patients presenting to a tertiary care facility with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Methods: The descriptive study on adult patients was conducted from February 2007 to March 2008 at the Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi. It comprised 124 consenting patients of age 16 and above who presentd with a diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia. The diagnostic modalities used were based on significant changes in antibody titer or persisting high antibody titers {{in the case of}} Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chalmydia pneumoniae infections, or bacterial antigen in urine, in the case of Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 infection. Pyogenic bacteria were identified on the results of respiratory secretions or blood cultures. Continuous data and categorical variables were worked out using SPSS version 15. Results: Among the 124 patients enrolled, an etiologic agent was identified in 44 (35. 4 %) patients. The most common organism was Mycoplasma pneumoniae (n= 21, 17 %), followed by Chlamydia pneumoniae (n= 15, 12 %), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n= 9, 7 %), Haemophilus influenzae (n= 2, 1. 6 %), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n= 2, 1. 6 %) and Staphylococcus aureus (n= 1, 0. 8 %). Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common organism isolated from blood cultures. No cases of Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 were identified. Conclusions: Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chalmydia pneumoniae are significant etiologic agents for community-acquired pneumonia occurring in Karachi. Local treatment guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia should include therapy directed specifically at these agents...|$|R
30|$|Most {{cases were}} {{recognised}} and treated appropriately within 3 hours. Some, however, had an unacceptably long delay. Most patients survived their bacteraemia {{and did not}} require ICU admission. Ward doctors are generally good at assessing the likely source of sepsis and most use guidelines or specialist advice to guide therapy. Management could be improved by encouraging doctors to administer antibiotics personally {{at the time of}} assessment and to measure lactate, especially when presentation is <b>atypical.</b> Most <b>organisms</b> are sensitive and unnecessary broadening of empiric antibiotic therapy beyond guidelines is not required. However, due to a significant minority of resistant pathogens, close liaison with Microbiology is recommended.|$|R

40|$|Telithromycin was {{the first}} of the ketolide class of an-tibiotics to gain {{approval}} in the US. 1 A derivative of macrolide antibiotics, telithromycin has clinical activity against bacterial pathogens associated with community-ac-quired respiratory infections including Streptococcus pneu-moniae, Hemophilus influenza, Mycobacterium catarrhalis, and <b>atypical</b> <b>organisms</b> such as Legionella pneumophila. 1 - 3 Telithromycin exerts its antibacterial effects by blocking protein synthesis at domains II and V of 23 S rRNA of the 50 S ribosomal subunit. As with its macrolide counterparts, telithromycin is hepatically metabolized by the cytochrome P 450 mixed oxidase system, primarily through the 3 A 4 (about 50 % of its total metabolism) and 1 A isoenzyme pathways. 3, 4 In vitro studies have not demonstrated a propensity for induction or inhibition of these enzyme sys-tems. 1, 5 However, clinically significant drug interactions may occur by potential displacement of one drug at en-zyme binding sites by another drug. We report a case of verapamil toxicity caused by a probable interaction be-tween verapamil and telithromycin. Case Report A 76 -year-old white female was brought to the emergency depart-ment (ED) of a large community teaching hospital after experiencing a sudden onset of shortness of breath and weakness while at home. Upon arrival in the ED, the patient was found to be profoundly hypotensive and bradycardic, with systolic BP 50 – 60 mm Hg and HR 30 beats/min. Her past medical history was significant for breast cancer, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and hyperlipidemia.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Pediatric {{bacterial}} bloodstream infections (BSIs) are a {{major cause}} of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Epidemiological data from resource-limited settings in southeast Asia, such as Cambodia, are sparse but have important implications for treatment and public health strategies. METHODS: We retrospectively investigated BSI in children at a pediatric hospital and its satellite clinic in Siem Reap, Cambodia, from January 1, 2007, to July 31, 2011. The range of bacterial pathogens and their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns were analyzed in conjunction with demographic, clinical and outcome data. RESULTS: Of 7682 blood cultures with results (99. 9 % of cultures taken), 606 (7. 9 %) episodes of BSI were identified in 588 children. The incidence of BSI increased from 14 to 50 / 1000 admissions (P < 0. 001); this was associated with an increased sampling rate. Most BSI were community acquired (89. 1 %). Common pathogens included Salmonella Typhi (22. 8 % of all isolates), Staphylococcus aureus (12. 2 %), Streptococcus pneumoniae (10. 0 %), Klebsiella pneumoniae (6. 4 %) and Escherichia coli (6. 3 %). 21. 5 % of BSI were caused by a diverse group of uncommon organisms, the majority of which were environmental Gram-negative species. No Listeria monocytogenes or Group B streptococcal BSI were identified. Antimicrobial resistance, particularly among the Enterobacteriaceae, was common. Overall mortality was substantial (19. 0 %), higher in neonates (36. 9 %) and independently associated with meningitis/meningoencephalitis and K. pneumoniae infection. CONCLUSIONS: BSI is a common problem in Cambodian children attending hospital and associated with significant mortality. Further studies are needed to clarify the epidemiology of neonatal sepsis, the contribution of <b>atypical</b> <b>organisms</b> and the epidemiology of pneumococcal disease before the introduction of vaccine...|$|R
