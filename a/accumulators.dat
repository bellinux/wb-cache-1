5|$|On 26 June {{the agents}} {{returned}} {{to supervise the}} destruction of the promotional material, including 251 copies of Reich's books. The American Civil Liberties Union issued a press release criticizing the book burning, although coverage of the release was poor, and Reich ended up asking them not to help because he was annoyed that they had failed to criticize {{the destruction of the}} <b>accumulators.</b> In England A.S. Neill and the poet Herbert Read signed a letter of protest, but it was never published. On 23 July the remaining <b>accumulators</b> in New York were destroyed by S. A. Collins and Sons, who had built them.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the years}} the FDA interviewed physicians, Reich's {{students}} and his patients, asking about the orgone <b>accumulators.</b> A professor at the University of Oregon who bought an accumulator told an FDA inspector that he knew the device was phoney, but found it helpful because his wife sat quietly in it for four hours every day.|$|E
5|$|On 5 June 1956 two FDA {{officials}} {{arrived at}} Orgonon {{to supervise the}} destruction of the <b>accumulators.</b> Most of them had been sold by that time and another 50 were with Silvert in New York. Only three were at Orgonon. The FDA agents were not allowed to destroy them, only to supervise the destruction, so Reich's friends and his son, Peter, chopped them up with axes as the agents watched. Once they were destroyed, Reich placed an American flag on top of them.|$|E
5|$|Representing himself {{during the}} hearing, he {{admitted}} the violation but {{pleaded not guilty}} and hinted at conspiracies. During a recess the judge apparently suggested a psychiatric evaluation to Reich's ex-wife, Ilse Ollendorff, {{but this was not}} communicated to Reich. The jury found him guilty on 7 May 1956, and he was sentenced to two years' imprisonment. Silvert was sentenced to a year and a day, the Wilhelm Reich Foundation was fined $10,000, and the <b>accumulators</b> and associated literature were to be destroyed.|$|E

50|$|The <b>accumulator</b> {{is defined}} as any {{equipment}} used for the intermediate storage of electrical energy supplied by the solar generator or by the charging unit. Any on-board <b>accumulator</b> is considered {{as an integral part}} of the vehicle’s <b>accumulator.</b> All on-board electrical equipment, unless consisting of items originally powered by dry batteries, small <b>accumulator</b> or their own solar cells, must receive its energy supply from the vehicle’s official <b>accumulator.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} solve the problem of the {{response}} time of concrete pump distribution circuit unmatching pumping construcution requirement,which caused by selecting <b>accumulator</b> based on experience, the parameter configuration of the <b>accumulator</b> was quantitatively expressed. The response time of the distribution circuit is divided into switch time of S tube distribution valve and accumulated pressure differential time of the <b>accumulator.</b> In order to meet the requirements of the response time of the pumping construction, based on the existing parameter configuration of the <b>accumulator,</b> with dynamic characteristic equation and gas state equation respectively, the switch time of S tube distribution valve and accumulated pressure differential time of the <b>accumulator</b> is quantitatively calculated, and the parameters of the <b>accumulator</b> is configurated. Compared to the traditional <b>accumulator</b> choice method, namely selecting <b>accumulator</b> according to experience and testing whether the response time of the distribution circuit is reasonable, quantitative calculated parameter configuration of concrete pump <b>accumulator</b> is more accurate, and can fully meet the requirments of pumping construction. This method also provides theoretical basis for design and choice of engineering machinery <b>accumulator...</b>|$|R

Hydraulic pressure {{was provided by}} three hydraulic pumps fitted to Nos. 1, 2 and 3 engines. An electrically operated hydraulic power pack (EHPP) {{could be used to}} operate the bomb doors and recharge the brake <b>accumulators.</b> A compressed air (later nitrogen) system was provided for emergency undercarriage lowering.|$|E
5|$|The postwar climate sees {{a period}} of {{austerity}} and mistrust towards the machines. Returning from {{the horrors of the}} war, Marke becomes the Consul of Berlin and instates a reign of isolation and deurbanization. Advanced weapons are destroyed, people are driven out into the countryside to cultivate the land, and the giant energy <b>accumulators</b> are destroyed. Columns made to look like bulls are erected in city squares and at crossroads, and roar twice a day like a dying animal to remind people of the catastrophe of the Ural War. Marduk succeeds Marke as the Consul and continues the period of brutal authoritarian rule.|$|E
5|$|Production of {{electricity}} in the station ceased in 1919, ushered in by the completion of an extension to generating equipment at Newburn Steelworks. The building was retained and continued {{to be used to}} supply power to the tram route by housing a sub-station, which used rotary converters. The station also provided a service for local residents who wanted their wireless <b>accumulators</b> recharged. The station continued to operate in this way until 1946, when the tram route was closed. The station's chimney was demolished in 1949, along with remaining structures of the Tyne Iron Works, which had stood next to the power station throughout its operation.|$|E

5|$|After the war, {{he started}} selling {{bicycles}} and motorbikes {{in a small}} shop in Brunswick Street, in the Kensington Fields area of Liverpool. He began selling and recharging batteries in 1925, opening a shop {{in the front room}} of his family's three-storey Georgian terraced house, called Phillips’ Battery Charging Depot, and had to install large <b>accumulators</b> in the cellar. Phillips ran the business for 30 years, even during WWII, but due to a decline in demand for batteries in the early 1950s (most people having electricity by then) he started selling household electrical goods. By late 1954, the shop was only selling records and record players; customers would buy recordings of American Country and Western, and Big Band music. As Phillips had supplied batteries to the Burtonwood air base during the war, he could buy and sell the latest records from America via his contacts there.|$|E
25|$|ENIAC had 20 ten-digit signed <b>accumulators,</b> {{which used}} ten's {{complement}} representation and could perform 5000 simple addition or subtraction operations between {{any of them}} and a source (e.g., another accumulator or a constant transmitter) every second. It was possible to connect several <b>accumulators</b> to run simultaneously, so the peak speed of operation was potentially much higher, due to parallel operation.|$|E
25|$|It was {{possible}} to wire the carry of one accumulator into another accumulator to perform double precision arithmetic, but the accumulator carry circuit timing prevented the wiring of 3+ for even higher precision. ENIAC used 4 of the <b>accumulators</b> (controlled by a special multiplier unit) to perform up to 385 multiplication operations/second; 5 of the <b>accumulators</b> were controlled by a special divider/square-rooter unit to perform up to 40 division operations/second or 3 square root operations/second.|$|E

50|$|In most cases, the {{operations}} are sequenced {{so that they}} can be combined in the most useful ways. For example, combining CLA (CLear <b>Accumulator),</b> CLL (CLear Link), and IAC (Increment <b>ACcumulator)</b> first clears the AC and Link, then increments the <b>accumulator,</b> leaving it set to 1. Adding RAL to the mix (so CLA CLL IAC RAL) causes the <b>accumulator</b> to be cleared, incremented, then rotated left, leaving it set to 2. In this way, small integer constants were placed in the <b>accumulator</b> with a single instruction.|$|R
