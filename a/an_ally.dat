She made her debut on the April 30 episode of SmackDown, teaming with Beth Phoenix to defeat LayCool (Michelle McCool and Layla).

5|$|Hugo Spadafora was a {{physician}} and political activist who had first clashed with Noriega {{when they were both}} members of Torrijo's government. Though <b>an</b> <b>ally</b> of Torrijos, he and Noriega had been personal enemies for a long time. Despite not {{being a member of the}} opposition, he became a vocal critic of Noriega after returning to Panama from Guatemala in 1981. Spadafora amassed evidence of corruption within the government by using his position as <b>an</b> <b>ally</b> of Torrijos to question Noriega's allies, including Rodriquez and Carlton. This included a lengthy conversation with Carlton in mid-1985 after his drug operations had collapsed due to conflicts over a missing shipment, and he had received negative publicity in the Panamanian press. In September 1985 he accused Noriega of having connections to drug trafficking and announced his intent to return to Panama to oppose him. The drug trafficking charges threatened Noriega's support among his own constituency of middle class individuals who had benefited under his and Torrijos' government.|$|E

5|$|In {{her plan}} {{to kill her}} husband she found <b>an</b> <b>ally</b> in Helmichis, the king's foster brother and spatharius (arms bearer). According to Paul the queen then {{recruited}} the king's cubicularius (bedchamberlain), Peredeo, into the plot, after having seduced him. When Alboin retired for his midday rest on June 28, care was taken to leave {{the door open and}} unguarded. Alboin's sword was also removed, leaving him defenceless when Peredeo entered his room and killed him. Alboin's remains were allegedly buried beneath the palace steps.|$|E
5|$|Lionel's {{development}} from a main antagonist to <b>an</b> <b>ally</b> {{was difficult for}} the writers, who felt the character's arc failed to achieve the status they wanted. Although they continued with the story arc, Lionel returned to using deception to protect Clark rather than exploit him. He is characterized as a sinister character who tried hard to further his own ambitions. Lionel's relationship with his son has been likened to that of Harry Osborn and Norman Osborn from Spider-Man comics.|$|E
5|$|Modern historians {{debate whether}} an {{alliance}} between the Franks and Mongols would {{have been successful in}} shifting {{the balance of power in}} the region, and if it would have been a wise choice on the part of the Europeans.

5|$|Noriega {{took great}} care to shape {{perceptions}} of himself. He permitted and encouraged rumors {{that as the}} chief of intelligence, he was in possession of negative information about everybody in the country. Dinges suggests that the impression among some officials that Noriega made money off of every transaction in the country may have been cultivated by Noriega himself. Among opposition leaders in Panama he was seen variously as a sexual pervert, as a sadist, and a rapist. Within U.S. government circles contradictory images abounded; Noriega {{was seen as a}} CIA spy, a drug trafficker, a nationalist supporting Torrijos, <b>an</b> <b>ally</b> of Cuba, and <b>an</b> <b>ally</b> of Oliver North and the Contras. He was perceived as a trusted collaborator in the war against drugs, even as the DEA was investigating him for involvement in smuggling. By the time of his removal he had come to be hated in the U.S., and the invasion was portrayed as an attempt to remove an evil man. Dinges writes that these contradictory images played a large role in the U.S. government's self-contradictory policy towards Noriega.|$|E

In February, Denmark–Norway {{accepted}} Frederick's elevation {{in hope of}} <b>an</b> <b>ally</b> in the Great Northern War, and the Tsardom of Russia likewise {{approved in}} 1701. Most princes of the Holy Roman Empire followed. Charles XII of Sweden accepted Frederick as Prussian king in 1703. In 1713, France and Spain also accepted Frederick's royal status.|$|E
