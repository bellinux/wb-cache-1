However, studies using rat model of stroke {{have demonstrated that}} IA MSCs delivery can decrease middle cerebral artery (MCA) flow, which may limit its clinical translation. The goal {{of this study is}} to identify a dose of IA MSCs (maximum tolerated dose; MTD) that does not compromise MCA flow and evaluate its efficacy and optimal timing in a rat model of reversible middle cerebral artery occlusion (rMCAo). We sought to determine if there is a difference in efficacy of acute (1 h) versus sub-acute (24 h) IA MSCs treatment after rMCAo.

40|$|As {{semiconductor}} manufacturers build smaller components, circuits {{and chips}} at that scale become less reliable {{and more expensive}} to produce, and no longer conform to the rigid hardware specifications usually expected of them. While traditionally, the onus of handling variability {{has been on the}} hardware manufacturers, there has been a recent push towards embracing device variability, especially in software, rather than hiding it by increasing guardbands applied to chip designs. Our work takes a higher-level software systems approach to previous studies of embedded sensing systems made in this regard and extends them to mobile devices, mainly smartphones, which are the current generation of general purpose computing devices. We begin by measuring and characterizing processor power variability in mobile devices through fine-grained power measurements on a suitably instrumented platform. We observe variation in processor power consumption ranging from 6 % to 15 % across smartphones that are manufactured to be identical. This variability, if harnessed properly, could convert into improvements in battery lifetime of 30 to 70 minutes. In this thesis, we also make the case for adaptive software that can leverage information about patterns of variability observed across devices for improved energy efficiency. Using video playback with different tunable parameters as a motivating example, we discuss the trade- off between quality of service and energy usage an the role device variability can play in these trade-offs and find that it is possible for us to proactively choose the encoding and frame resolution parameters to use for video playback, resulting in estimated energy savings of 3 - 15 % which translates to improved battery lifetime of <b>an</b> <b>hou...</b>|$|E

40|$|This article, {{taking into}} account the {{functions}} of texts in the Warring States period, analyzes “hou” 後, meaning “successor,” in the Zuozhuan 左傳 and other sources. All of the instances in which the existence of <b>a</b> <b>hou</b> is mentioned in the Zuozhuan are episodes about the dafu 大夫 class (aristocracy), and although a few of the instances referring to the absence of <b>a</b> <b>hou</b> are about monarchs, most of them are about dafu. Most of the hou connected by blood relationships appear in conversational passages and few of them in narrative sections. Because hou are often mentioned in argumentative and conversational passages, it would seem appropriate to infer that arguments about hou evolved later. In the Shijing 詩經, Shangshu 尚書, and some bronze inscriptions, hou refers exclusively to a successor related by blood, and he is expected to conduct ancestral rites. Most of the people referred to as hou in the Zuozhuan are monarchs who come from the stock of the Western Zhou dynasty and people of the dafu class who come from comparatively old clans (shi 氏). On the other hand, the reason for {{the presence or absence of}} <b>a</b> <b>hou</b> is not infrequently associated with ideological terms such as “virtue” (de 德) and so on, and the existence of <b>a</b> <b>hou</b> was not based solely on the principle of blood relationships. After the Spring and Autumn period, prefectures (xian 縣) were established to replace city-states (you 邑), and dafu and lowerranking people were dispatched as administrators from the capital, eventually supporting the rule of the central authorities after the Warring States period. Their positions could not be guaranteed solely by their blood relationships. It could also be said that prefecture-like elements, which later expanded from the Spring and Autumn period to the Warring States period, were inserted into the Zuozhuan...|$|R
