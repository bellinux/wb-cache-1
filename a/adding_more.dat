5|$|Even with Nashville {{no longer}} a {{connecting}} hub for a major airline, according to the Federal Aviation Administration, the number of passengers using BNA {{is expected to grow}} from 13 million to over 20 million by 2035. The MNAA leadership has a stated goal of <b>adding</b> <b>more</b> nonstop destinations, increasing cargo service, and <b>adding</b> <b>more</b> international flights. To accommodate the projected growth and aid with landing new nonstop flights, the Metro Nashville Airport Authority has announced a $1.2 billion renovation of the airport dubbed as BNA Vision. It is expected to be completed by 2023.|$|E
5|$|Boeing {{announced}} the 747-500X and -600X at the 1996 Farnborough Airshow. The proposed models would have combined the 747's fuselage {{with a new}} 251ft (77m) span wing derived from the 777. Other changes included <b>adding</b> <b>more</b> powerful engines and {{increasing the number of}} tires from two to four on the nose landing gear and from 16 to 20 on the main landing gear.|$|E
5|$|Due to an {{increase}} of ridership, the MTA has tried to increase capacity wherever possible by <b>adding</b> <b>more</b> frequent service, specifically during the evening hours. However, this increase will not likely {{keep up with the}} growth of subway ridership. Some lines have capacity for additional trains during peak times, but there are too few subway cars for this additional service to be operated.|$|E

5|$|Air Greenland also {{performs}} charter flights within Europe {{on behalf}} of European travel agencies using its Airbus A330. In 2015, the decision voted by Greenland's governments to extend the runways of Nuuk and Ilulissat airports directly threatened the purpose of Air Greenland's single widebody aircraft. The A330 was only used from Pituffik and Kangerlussuaq to Copenhagen Kastrup, but in January 2017, Air Greenland had announced more commercial routes to {{be covered by the}} aircraft between Iceland and Greenland. In March 2017, Air Greenland also announced <b>adding</b> <b>more</b> flights to Kangerlussuaq.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1999, MDOT spent {{substantial}} sums {{of money}} over a five-year program to upgrade M-65 and US23 by refurbishing and replacing bridges and <b>adding</b> <b>more</b> passing lanes. During the same timeframe, the community of Hale embarked on a project to beautify the length of M-65 in town. The project cost $877,929 and installed park benches, new lighting, sidewalks and plantings along the highway. Funding for the venture came {{from the federal government}} and MDOT.|$|E
5|$|Disadvantages {{resulting}} from the nature of orbital mechanics would make {{the arrangement of the}} orbits of the swarm extremely complex. The simplest such arrangement is the Dyson ring, in which all such structures share the same orbit. More-complex patterns with more rings would intercept more of the star's output, but would result in some constructs eclipsing others periodically when their orbits overlap. Another potential problem is that the increasing loss of orbital stability when <b>adding</b> <b>more</b> elements increases the probability of orbital perturbations.|$|E

5|$|In 2001 a new {{master plan}} called 2020 Vision: A Community Concept for the MSU Campus was {{developed}} to guide future campus development. Amongst the recommendations it called for the removing of central campus parking to parking garages replacing it with green space, the removal of head-in parking around West and East Circle Drives, <b>adding</b> <b>more</b> bike lanes and planting more trees on south campus {{in order to give}} it {{the look and feel of}} north campus.|$|E
5|$|Post Oak Mall is a {{regional}} shopping mall in College Station, Texas owned by CBL & Associates Properties. Construction {{on the mall}} began in summer 1979 and it opened February 17, 1982. It initially housed 80 stores with four anchors. A second phase, planned before the mall even opened, was completed in 1985, <b>adding</b> <b>more</b> floor space and bringing the mall up to 125 stores and 6 anchor stores.

5|$|The four {{difficulty}} {{levels for}} each song afford the player a learning curve {{in order to}} help him or her progress in skill. The first difficulty level, Easy, only focuses on the first three fret buttons while displaying a significantly reduced amount of notes for the player to play. Medium introduces a fourth fret button while <b>adding</b> <b>more</b> notes, and Hard includes the final fret button while adding additional notes. Expert does not introduce any other frets to learn, but adds more notes in a manner designed to challenge the player.|$|E
5|$|The {{potential}} redevelopment of Sembawang Hot Spring into {{a national}} park is currently being explored. The Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) said on 23 April 2016 that it is prepared to return the land occupied by the hot spring to the Singapore Land Authority. MINDEF hopes a public agency such as the National Parks Board (NParks) can take over to improve and maintain the place, while constructing amenities such as toilets and <b>adding</b> <b>more</b> greenery. The ministry added that putting the place under a public agency means the land need not be tendered out {{to the highest bidder}} and become commercialised.|$|E
5|$|Development of {{the game}} began in October 2003. The {{overview}} {{of the game}}'s story was originally drafted before the first Knights of the Old Republic was released, after which it saw many revisions and also some major redrafts. In preparation to write Knights of the Old Republic II, Chris Avellone, the game's lead designer, tried {{to learn as much}} about the Star Wars universe as possible. He read many books, guides, modules, and graphic novels, and the Obsidian team also relied on the first Knights of the Old Republic and the original Star Wars films for inspiration. Avellone said that Obsidian recognized {{one of the things that}} made Knights of the Old Republic great was the story and the companions, and that they tried to expand upon this by <b>adding</b> <b>more</b> depth to them.|$|E

5|$|In 1936, the United States Supreme Court {{ruled the}} Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933 unconstitutional. For the first time, Minton gave speeches criticizing {{the court for}} {{overriding}} the will of Congress. He accused the court of allowing itself {{to be influenced by}} political motives rather than the law. In response to the court ruling, Minton began drafting a bill which would allow the Supreme Court to declare a law unconstitutional only if seven out the nine justices supported the decision. In February 1937, before Minton introduced his bill, President Roosevelt introduced a plan of his own to deal with the Supreme Court. Roosevelt proposed <b>adding</b> <b>more</b> justices to the court and creating a mandatory retirement age; the changes would allow him to appoint an overwhelming majority to the court, more sympathetic to his agenda, ensuring the safety of legislation passed by his party.|$|E
5|$|In the {{citric acid}} cycle, all the {{intermediates}} (e.g. citrate, iso-citrate, alpha-ketoglutarate, succinate, fumarate, malate and oxaloacetate) are regenerated during each {{turn of the}} cycle. <b>Adding</b> <b>more</b> {{of any of these}} intermediates to the mitochondrion therefore means that the additional amount is retained within the cycle, increasing all the other intermediates as one is converted into the other. Hence, the addition of any one of them to the cycle has an anaplerotic effect, and its removal has a cataplerotic effect. These anaplerotic and cataplerotic reactions will, {{during the course of the}} cycle, increase or decrease the amount of oxaloacetate available to combine with acetyl-CoA to form citric acid. This in turn increases or decreases the rate of ATP production by the mitochondrion, and thus the availability of ATP to the cell.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the {{relationship}} between price level and output was explained by the quantity theory of money; David Hume had presented such a theory in his 1752 work Of Money (Essays, Moral, Political, and Literary, Part II, Essay III). Quantity theory viewed the entire economy through Say's law, which stated that whatever is supplied to the market will be sold—in short, that markets always clear. In this view, money is neutral and cannot impact the real factors in an economy like output levels. This {{was consistent with the}} classical dichotomy view that real aspects of the economy and nominal factors, such as price levels and money supply, can be considered independent from one another. For example, <b>adding</b> <b>more</b> money to an economy would be expected only to raise prices, not to create more goods.|$|E
