25|$|This version's major {{difference}} is Brainiac's role in Krypton's destruction. Brainiac {{is portrayed as}} the supercomputer that monitors Krypton and advises the planetary council on scientific matters. He senses the imminent destruction of the planet, but denies it so he can avoid the council's order to organize the planet's evacuation and instead focus on saving himself. Brainiac reasons {{that the loss of}} the planet itself and all its living inhabitants is part of the natural order, but his own survival would ensure the preservation of Krypton's history and achievements. Because he goes against Brainiac and the Kryptonian Council, Jor-El becomes an outlaw in their eyes <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>works</b> to save his son. After the destruction of Krypton and Kal-El's arrival on Earth, Brainiac eventually becomes an enemy of Superman.|$|E

After the Illuminati's ship explodes and kills Caiera, the Hulk returns to Earth with his superhero group Warbound and declares war on the planet in World War Hulk (2007).

When his editor offers to take the play out of his hands, Arthur insists that it's his family's project, and {{he wants to be a}} part of it, and is tasked with writing the play's Introduction. He begins to believe that, without question, The Tragedy of Arthur was written by William Shakespeare, and <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>works</b> on the publication of the text, Arthur remains preoccupied with Petra, and ultimately starts sleeping with her despite her relationship with Dana. After his father's death, however, Arthur discovers an index card with details of the play on it, and becomes convinced that it's evidence that the play is a forgery. Furthermore, his father's will dictates that the profit from the publication of the quarto be devised between Arthur, Dana, their mother, and his former business associate, Charles Glassow. The will also requires that the play be published as the work of William Shakespeare, and that any effort made by Arthur to dispute the play's authenticity will result in his share of the profits being retained.|$|E
500|$|The fifth chapter, [...] "The Conspiracy", {{presents}} {{the achievement of}} Thomas Jefferson and James Madison in creating American party politics by forming the Democratic-Republican Party. Even <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>works</b> to undermine Washington's administration from within, however, Jefferson disparages party politics and denies that {{he is capable of}} acting in a partisan fashion, thus failing to understand his own accomplishment. [...] "The Purchase", the book's final chapter, explores the story behind the 1803 Louisiana Purchase, discussing President Jefferson's achievement in making the Purchase but also his failure to prohibit slavery in the new territory. Ellis argues that Jefferson thus set the nation on the course that would lead to the Civil War, and that as a result, [...] "tragedy trumped triumph in the story of the Purchase". In the afterword, Ellis states that [...] "perhaps the most creative act of the founding era" [...] was [...] "an expanding liberal mandate that left room, up ahead, for an Abraham Lincoln and a Martin Luther King to join the list of founders." ...|$|E
500|$|UPN {{executives}} had {{pitched the}} series as following [...] "young doctors in peril at a haunted old Boston Hospital" [...] who {{must contend with}} [...] "a healthy dose of terrifying paranormal occurrences and gripping medical emergencies". In the pilot episode, Dr. Mitchell Grace (Grayson McCouch) begins working at the hospital immediately after graduating from medical school. He had specifically chosen the All Souls medical program, refusing offers from the Mayo Clinic and the Yale–New Haven Hospital, due to his personal connection with the hospital. While working as a janitor in the hospital, Grace's father died in 1978 after contracting a mysterious illness. Grace serves as the show's lead character, and functions as a detective {{as well as a}} doctor while trying to understand the inner workings of All Souls. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>works,</b> Grace encounters both good and evil ghosts, and discovers medical experiments are being conducted under the guidance of the board of directors. Some spirits include [...] "a mad scientist and his Igor-like errand boy," [...] and a woman dressed in 19th century fashion pushing a baby carriage through the halls. Grace is haunted by visions of his father, and he is somehow connected with the ghost Lazarus and Civil War doctors. Dr. Dante Ambrosious (Jean LeClerc), the chair of the facility's board, is shown to have made deals with the evil spirits.|$|E

500|$|Joshua Rothkopf of Time Out New York {{referred}} {{to being a}} [...] "must-see danceumentary." [...] Rothkopf described Jackson as [...] "obviously" [...] having been [...] "shooting for the moon right before his death" [...] {{based on what he}} could tell from the [...] "stunning bits of concert spectacle" [...] of [...] "phalanxes of computer-generated dancers, tempo changes on a dime, a bombshell of a blond guitarist who plays Eddie Van Halen's [...] "Beat It" [...] solo flawlessly". Rothkopf stated that: [...] "But the true value of this raw rehearsal footage is its emphasis, less known, on MJ's laserlike attention to detail, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>works</b> his band and troupe up to speed. A firm floor manager himself, he's often exposed — and probably wouldn't have approved of this film. (One on one, High School Musicals Kenny Ortega, meanwhile, treats him with kid gloves: [...] "I agree, Michael.") But to see him sweetly lose himself in [...] "Human Nature" [...] ("I like living this way...") is to feel a creature of the stage finally returned home, and possibly on the cusp of redemption." [...] Peter Paras, of E! Online felt that watching Jackson and his performances in a positive aspect is the [...] "genius and the sadness of the entire film." [...] He did note that Jackson's performance of [...] "Earth Song," [...] which consists of using Jackson's voiceover to emphasize his environmental concerns while a bulldozer threatens to eat him, was well-intentioned — because it brought attention to environmental concerns — but felt it was a little over the top. Paras felt the film showed an [...] "exacting and refreshingly funny side of Jackson to be revealed" [...] and [...] "had Jackson lived, we never would have seen those moments" [...] and felt the film was a proper way to [...] "finally say goodbye" [...] to Jackson.|$|E
500|$|William Grimes, {{writing in}} the New York Times, {{described}} The Utility of Force as [...] "a closely argued, searching textbook on strategy and the efficient use of military power in the post-Cold War era". Grimes also {{described it as a}} [...] "difficult, challenging book", saying [...] "you can almost hear the pointer hit the blackboard <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>works</b> his way rigorously through each argument and sub-arguments A, B and C, before proceeding to the next step. At times the history lecture becomes a forced march over very familiar terrain, but patient readers will discover that there is indeed a final destination". In a second review for the New York Times in 2007, Niall Ferguson, a history professor at Harvard University, described The Utility of Force as an update of Clausewitz's On War [...] "for our times". Ferguson went on to criticise Smith for drawing too clear a distinction between [...] "war amongst the people" [...] and [...] "war between peoples", pointing out that in several conflicts there was no single, homogeneous [...] "people" [...] and that wars amongst the people can easily transform into wars between people, citing Bosnia as an example. Ferguson was underwhelmed by Smith's recommendations for the future—Smith believes that new equipment and strategies are required in order for armies to be effective in the new paradigm, but does not offer any suggestions. Ferguson's final criticism was what he described as the book's [...] "limited historical perspective"; Smith argues that [...] "war amongst the people" [...] emerged {{in the second half of}} the 20th century during the proxy wars and de-colonisation campaigns of the Cold War era, but Ferguson gave examples of similar campaigns which pre-dated the Cold War, including the First Boer War (1880–81) and campaigns fought in Eastern Europe during the Second World War. Nonetheless, Ferguson concludes that The Utility of Force is [...] "an impressive and absorbing work", and described Smith as [...] "the Clausewitz of low-intensity conflict and peacekeeping operations".|$|E
500|$|Now {{he discovers}} that the self he chooses has a {{boundless}} multiplicity within itself inasmuch {{as it has}} a history, a history in which he acknowledges identity with himself. This history is of a different kind, for in this history he stands {{in relation to other}} individuals in the race, and to the whole race, and this history contains painful things, and yet he is the person he is only through this history. That is why it takes courage to choose oneself, for {{at the same time as}} he seems to be isolating himself most radically he is most radically sinking himself into the root by which he is bound up with the whole. This makes him uneasy, and yet it must be so, for when the passion of freedom is aroused in him-and it is aroused in the choice just as it presupposes itself in the choice-he chooses himself and struggles for this possession as for his salvation, and it is his salvation. Either/Or Part II, Hong, p. 216When a person turns and faces himself in order to understand himself, he steps, as it were, in the way of that first self, halts that which was turned outward in hankering for and seeking after the surrounding world that is its object, and summons it back from the external. In order to prompt the first self to this withdrawal, the deeper self lets the surrounding world remain what it is-remain dubious. This is indeed the way it is; the world around us is inconstant and can be changed into the opposite at any moment, and there is not one person who can force this change by his own might or by the conjuration of his wish. The deeper self now shapes the deceitful flexibility of the surrounding world in such a way that it is no longer attractive to the first self. Then the first self either must proceed to kill the deeper self, to render it forgotten, whereby the whole matter is given up; or it must admit that the deeper self is right, because to want to predicate constancy of something that continually changes is indeed a contradiction, and as soon as one confesses that it changes, it can of course, change in that same moment. However much that first self shrinks from this, there is no wordsmith so ingenious or no thought-twister so wily that he can invalidate the deeper self’s eternal claim. There is only one way out, and that is to silence the deeper self by letting the roar of inconstancy drown it out. Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses, 1845, Hong translation, p. 314Just as a man changes his clothes for celebration, so a person preparing for the holy act of confession is inwardly changed. It is indeed like changing one’s clothes to divest oneself of multiplicity in order to make up one’s mind about one thing, to interrupt the pace of busy activity in order to put on the repose of contemplation in unity with oneself. And this unity with oneself is the celebration’s simple festive dress that is the condition of admittance. Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits, Søren Kierkegaard, 1847, Hong, p.19If a person whose life has been tried in some crucial difficulty has a friend and sometime later he is unable to retain the past clearly, if anxiety creates confusion, and if accusing thoughts assail him with all their might <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>works</b> his way back, then he may go to his friend and say, [...] "My soul is sick so that nothing will become clear to me, but I confided everything to you; you remember it, so please explain the past to me again." [...] But if a person has no friend, he presumably goes to God if under other circumstances he has confided something to him, if in the hour of decision he called God as witness when no one understood him. [...] And the one who went to his friend perhaps was not understood at times, perhaps was filled with self-loathing, which is even more oppressive, upon discovering that the one to whom he had confided his troubles had not understood him at all, even though he had listened, had not sensed what was making him anxious, but had only an inquisitive interest in his unusual encounter with life. But this would never happen with God; who would dare to venture to think this of God, even if he is cowardly enough to prefer to forget God-until he stands face-to-face with the judge, who passes judgment on him but not on the one who truly has God as a witness, because where God is the judge, there is indeed no judge if God is the witness. It by no means follows that a person’s life becomes easy because he learns to know God in this way. On the contrary, it can become very hard; it may become more difficult than the contemptible easiness of sensate human life, but in this difficulty life also acquires ever deeper and deeper meaning.

The third male character is the rich, powerful yet villainous Juan Mardo. He leers at Courtenay and makes rude comments of a sexual nature, in Japanese nonetheless. Mardo provokes Duncan and Steele, and each feels he must defend Courtenay's honor. Ultimately Courtenay defends her own honor rather than submit to shame.|$|E

Eva cries out as Walther enters the room, splendidly attired for the festival, and sings {{the third and final}} section of the Prize Song. The couple are overwhelmed with gratitude for Sachs, and Eva asks Sachs to forgive her for having manipulated his feelings. The cobbler brushes them off with bantering complaints about his lot as a shoemaker, poet, and widower. At last, however, he admits to Eva that, despite his feelings for her, he is resolved to avoid the fate of King Marke (a reference to the subject of another Wagner opera, Tristan und Isolde, in which an old man tries to marry a much-younger woman), thus conferring his blessing upon the lovers. David and Magdalena appear. Sachs announces to the group that a new master-song has been born, which, following the rules of the mastersingers, is to be baptized. As an apprentice cannot serve as a witness for the baptism, he promotes David to the rank of journeyman with the traditional cuff on the ear (and by this also [...] "promoting" [...] him as a groom and Magdalena as a bride).
