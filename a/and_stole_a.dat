25|$|After the {{destruction}} of the Trees and the theft of the Silmarils, the Valar had created the moon and the sun. At the same time, Men awoke, some of whom later arrived in Beleriand and allied themselves with the Elves. Beren, a man who had survived the latest battle, wandered to Doriath, where {{he fell in love with}} the elf Lúthien, the king's daughter. The king sought to prevent their marriage by imposing what he believed an impossible task: retrieving one of the Silmarils from Melkor. But together, Beren and Lúthien embarked on this quest. Sauron, a powerful servant of Melkor, imprisoned Beren along the way; but with Lúthien's help he escaped, crept into Melkor's fortress, <b>and</b> <b>stole</b> <b>a</b> Silmaril from Melkor's crown. Having achieved the task, the first union of man and elf was formed, though Beren was soon mortally wounded and Lúthien also died of grief. However she convinced the Vala Mandos to revive Beren and herself, though she had to renounce her immortality.|$|E
25|$|The Nor’Wester’s {{offers of}} free passage soon had the desired effect. Coupled with the harsh living {{conditions}} in the region, disgruntled settlers began leaving the colony. Archibald Macdonald, then {{in command of the}} colony while Gov. Macdonell was temporarily away, threatened to use the colony’s cannons to prevent their leaving. As a result, on April 3 a party of disgruntled settlers led by George Campbell detained the officers in the mess room of Fort Douglas, broke into the colony’s warehouses <b>and</b> <b>stole</b> <b>a</b> number of artillery pieces, weapons and tools, carrying them off on horse-drawn sleighs while the imprisoned officers watched through the mess-room windows. The colonists then met with Duncan Cameron and a party of NWC voyageurs to whom they gave the stolen guns. The unmounted guns were conveyed by canoes to Fort Gibraltar where field carriages were made for them. When Governor Macdonell returned, NWC officer Severight attempted to arrest him, but Macdonell resisted stating a legally appointed governor cannot be arrested and taken from his post. Macdonnel detained Severight for several hours and then released him.|$|E
25|$|In January 1945 a {{plan was}} drafted by Generalleutenant Graf von Schmettow to hit back at the Americans occupying the Cherbourg peninsula. Using a number of ships rescued from St Malo and with the {{additional}} objective of boosting morale of German soldiers in the Channel islands a detailed plan was created using information from German prisoners {{who had been in}} Granville <b>and</b> <b>stole</b> <b>a</b> landing craft LCV(P) to escape. Training exercises were undertaken by 800 men in Guernsey, away from the civilian population to avoid the plans being revealed. Work on the ships also had to be kept away from the SS Vega in case the preparations were reported. An idea that a raid was being planned was noticed and a message was sent from Guernsey to France with an escaping OT worker, Xavier Gollivet, who had worked for the German Harbour Master and two local fisherman, Tom and Jack Le Page, it would be ignored. A false start on 6 February due to fog, also risked disclosure of the attack.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, the violent {{religious}} and political conflict known as the Troubles broke out in Northern Ireland. Many people {{from both sides of}} the religious/political divide were caught up in the violence that ensued. Hanna was no exception as attacks waged by the Provisional IRA escalated in the early 1970s, and many Ulster loyalists in Northern Ireland, feeling that their status was being threatened and the state response insufficient, sought to retaliate with illegal violence by joining one of the two main loyalist paramilitary organisations, the legal Ulster Defence Association (UDA) or the illegal Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF). Up until his death in 1975, Hanna was the leader of the Mid-Ulster Brigade of the UVF, having established the brigade and set up the first unit in his home town of Lurgan in 1972. Hanna, who held the rank of brigadier, appointed himself commander and his leadership was endorsed by the UVF's supreme commander Gusty Spence. On 23 October of that same year, an armed UVF gang raided King's Park camp, a UDR/Territorial Army depot in Lurgan, <b>and</b> <b>stole</b> <b>a</b> large cache of sophisticated guns and ammunition. Hanna was the depot's guard commander when the raid took place.|$|E

A substantial reward was offered by the Foundation {{for information leading to}} its recovery. By May 2009, after a thorough investigation, British officials said they believe the work, once valued at £3 million (US$5.3 million), was probably sold for scrap metal, fetching about £5,000.

500|$|Thirty-nine {{individuals}} who played professional baseball {{at the major}} league level lack identified given names.

Possible mistakes in reading 19th-century box scores could have also led to players without given names, as [...] "Eland", for example, could be another player from the Baltimore Marylands roster whose name was simply misread. Philadelphia Athletics manager Bill Sharsig signed four of the 39, [...] "local players" [...] McBride, Stafford, Sterling, and Sweigert, for Philadelphia's last game of the season against the Syracuse Stars on October 12, 1890.
