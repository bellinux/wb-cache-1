25|$|The optical {{absorption}} spectrum of pyridine in hexane contains three bands at the wavelengths of 195nm (π→π* transition, molar <b>absorptivity</b> ε=7500L·mol−1·cm−1), 251nm (π→π* transition, ε=2000L·mol−1·cm−1) and 270nm (n→π* transition, ε=450L·mol−1·cm−1). The 1H {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} (NMR) spectrum of pyridine contains three signals with the integral intensity ratio of 2:1:2 that correspond to the three chemically different protons in the molecule. These signals originate from the α-protons (positions 2 and 6, chemical shift 8.5ppm), γ-proton (position 4, 7.5ppm) and β-protons (positions 3 and 5, 7.1ppm). The carbon analog of pyridine, benzene, has only one proton signal at 7.27ppm. The larger chemical shifts of the α- and γ-protons in comparison to benzene result from the lower electron density in the α- and γ-positions, which {{can be derived from}} the resonance structures. The situation is rather similar for the 13CNMR spectra of pyridine and benzene: pyridine shows a triplet at δ(α-C)=150ppm, δ(β-C)=124ppm and δ(γ-C)=136ppm, whereas benzene has a single line at 129ppm. All shifts are quoted for the solvent-free substances. Pyridine is conventionally detected by the gas chromatography and mass spectrometry methods.|$|E

Circumstances occur in which local thermodynamic equilibrium does not prevail, because the strong radiative effects overwhelm the tendency to the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution of molecular velocities.

The origin {{of the failure of}} the theory for carbon dioxide is discussed in detail. (2) The available, empirically determined, emissivity data for water vapor have been correlated in terms of a statistical model for the distribution of spectral lines within well-defined wavelength regions corresponding to the stronger vibration-rotation bands. This correlation provides a useful framework for the extrapolation of measured emissivity data to temperatures and pressures somewhat different from those used to obtain the experimental data. (3) The equilibrium emissivity of heated NO has been calculated for the conditions under which this molecule exists in high-temperature air during reentry of hypersonic missiles.
