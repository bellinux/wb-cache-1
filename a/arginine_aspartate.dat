By a double blind methodology, we were able to show that the treatment group had an enhanced maximal oxygen consumption as well as a significantly decreased plasma lactate concentration at a work intensity of 200, 300 and 400 W on the treadmill. By the same token, 5 and 20 minutes after completion of the test run, blood lactate levels were significantly lower in the group receiving <b>arginine</b> <b>aspartate.</b> Nevertheless, at the 4 mmol lactate threshold, power and total work output were the same for both controls and treatment groups.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this review}} was to {{investigate}} the effects of supplementation with arginine, mainly in combination with aspartate and/or other potentially ergogenic amino acids, on metabolism of substrates, endocrine parameters and performance in endurance and resistance athletes. Data sources: The database PUBMED was consulted, using the following keywords "arginine", "aspartate", "performance" and "metabolism". The references in these articles were scanned for further relevant publications. Study section: Studies with oral or intravenous administration of arginine and/or aspartate alone or in combination with other amino acids were selected. Data extraction: Studies with at least six subjects and utilising a placebo-controlled design were analysed. Data synthesis: Seven studies with the combination of <b>arginine</b> <b>aspartate</b> and evaluation of the effect on performance in athletes were found and evaluated. In addition, further studies with arginine and combination with other amino acids were found and analysed in the same manner. Conclusions: No effect on selected parameters of metabolism or the endocrine system have been shown after oral or intravenous arginine, <b>arginine</b> <b>aspartate</b> or other combinations with arginine and aspartate. Neither were there any ergogenic effects in trained athletes after oral or intravenous arginine use, either alone or in combination with aspartate and/or other potentially ergogenic amino acids...|$|E

Uptake rates for 14 C-labelled alanine, <b>arginine,</b> <b>aspartate,</b> glutamate, glycine and serine, presented singly at an initial concentration of l/imoll" 1, were estimated by observing disappearance of radioactivity from the ambient solution. Net entry of alanine, <b>arginine,</b> <b>aspartate</b> and serine was estimated by HPLC in parallel samples of the medium. There {{was no significant difference}} in the rate of influx of labelled substrate and net entry estimated by HPLC for these amino acids. Ligature of the anterior and posterior ends of the worms did not perceptibly modify rates of uptake. Distribution of radioactivity to the internal and external body wall, coelomocytes, gut and coelomic fluid was observed after l h of incubation in l^molF 1 serine. Rates of exchange of labelled carbon were estimated for all combinations of these internal tissues by taking advantage of morphological features of Glycera. Amino acid pools in each of the tissues of the worms are described, based on HPLC analyses. Internal distribution of radioactivity derived from [14 C]serine is com-pared with total pools based on estimates of tissue volume and the normal serine content of free amino acid pools for each tissue.

40|$|AbstractThe Na+-translocating F 1 F 0 -ATPase of Acetobacterium woodii was stimulated {{not only}} by Na+ but also by Li+ and was {{protected}} by Na+ or Li+ from inactivation by N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD), diethylstilbestrol (DES) and tributyltin (TBSn) but not N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) or azide. The amount of Na+ required for half-maximal protection from DCCD inhibition corresponded to the apparent Km for Na+ of ATP hydrolysis. The inhibition by the amiloride derivatives hexamethylene-amiloride (HMA), ethylisopropylamiloride (EIPA), N- 10 -benzyl-amiloride (benzamil) and N- 10 -phenamil-amiloride (phenamil) could be relieved by Na+ to various degrees. EIPA and HMA effectively protected the ATPase from DCCD inactivation, whereas the protection by benzamil and phenamil was only marginal indicating that the unsubstituted guanidinium group is essential for maximal protection from DCCD inactivation. These {{results indicate that the}} amiloride derivatives and Na+ or DCCD compete for a common binding site.

Xylem sap of olives branches was collected using a external 45 -cm external Scholander Super Chamber. Metabolome analysis was performed by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy-based study and the ionome analysis was performed by inductively coupled plasma with optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES).

40|$|Nucleoside {{diphosphate}} kinases (NDPKs) are multifunctional proteins encoded by the nme (non-metastatic cells) genes, {{also called}} NM 23. NDPKs catalyze {{the transfer of}} γ-phosphate from nucleoside triphosphates to nucleoside diphosphates by a ping-pong mechanism involving {{the formation of a}} high-energy phosphohistidine intermediate. Growing evidence shows that NDPKs, particularly NDPK-B, can additionally act as a protein histidine kinase. Protein kinases and phosphatases that regulate reversible O-phosphorylation of serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues have been studied extensively in many organisms. Interestingly, other phosphoamino acids histidine, lysine, <b>arginine,</b> <b>aspartate,</b> glutamate, and cysteine exist in abundance but remain understudied due to the paucity of suitable methods and antibodies. The N-phosphorylation of histidine by histidine kinases via the two- or multi-component signaling systems is an important mediator in cellular responses in prokaryotes and lower eukaryotes, like yeast, fungi, and plants. However, in vertebrates knowledge of phosphohistidine signaling has lagged far behind and the identity of the protein kinases and protein phosphatases involved is not well established.

The effect of the dopamine D(3) /D(2) receptor agonist quinelorane (30 microg/kg s. c.) was then investigated in both subregions. With the exception of glutamate, histidine, and serine, which showed similar levels in both subterritories, alanine, <b>arginine,</b> <b>aspartate,</b> gamma-aminobutyric acid, glutamine, and tyrosine were significantly higher in the shell compared with the core.

40|$|The {{importance}} of serum-free medium components {{on the growth}} of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and production of recombinant human interferon(IFN) -gamma was investigated. The complexity of the medium led {{to the adoption of}} a statistical optimization approach based on a Plackett-Burman design. From this analysis a set of nutritional components was identified as important for cell growth and recombinant protein production. Glycine was identified as an important determinant of specific growth rate, whereas for cell production bovine serum albumin (BSA), phenylalanine and tyrosine were also identified as important. BSA, sodium pyruvate, glutamate, methionine, proline, histidine, hydroxyproline, tyrosine and phenylalanine were shown to be important for IFN-gamma production. Other medium components, such as insulin, <b>arginine,</b> <b>aspartate</b> and serine produced an inhibitory effect on both cell growth and IFN-gamma production. The effect of the stimulatory nutrients as a whole group was tested by increasing their concentration in the medium. A significant improvement in specific cell growth rate, cell production and IFN-gamma production (up to 45 %) was achieved on both shake-flask and fermentor cultures.

At early time intervals, the amino acid pool of biotin-deficient yeast contained lower concentrations of all amino acids except alanine. After more prolonged incubation, several amino acids accumulated in the pool of biotin-deficient yeast, but citrulline and ornithine accumulated to appreciable levels. The addition of aspartate to the growth medium resulted in a decrease in the amino acid content of biotin-optimal cells but caused a marked increase in the concentration of amino acids in biotin-deficient cells. The pools of biotin-deficient yeast grown in the presence of aspartate displayed a marked reduction in every amino acid with the exception of aspartate itself. These data provide evidence that the amino acid content of yeast cells and their free amino acid pools are markedly affected by biotin deficiency as well as by supplementation with aspartate, indicating that aspartate {{plays a major role in}} the nitrogen economy of yeast under both normal as well as abnormal nutritional conditions...|$|E

Other amino acids tested (leucine, isoleucine, valine, alanine, <b>arginine,</b> and <b>aspartate)</b> do not affect blood pressure. Tyrosine injection appears to reduce blood pressure via an action within the central nervous system, since the effect can be blocked by co-administering other large neutral amino acids that reduce tyrosine's uptake into the brain.

40|$|To {{determine}} whether Salmonella typhimurium has a nitrogen control response, we {{have examined the}} regulation of nitrogen utilization in two mutants with fivefold and threefold elevations in their glutamine synthetase activities. The mutants do not require glutamine for growth on glucose [...] ammonia medium but do have altered growth on other nitrogen sources. They grow better than an isogenic control on media containing arginine or asparate, but more slowly with proline or alanine as nitrogen sources. This unusual growth pattern is not due to altered regulation of the ammonia assimilatory enzymes, glutamate dehydrogenase and glutamate synthase, or {{to changes in the}} enzymes for aspartate degradation. However, transport for several amino acids may be affected. Measurement of amino acid uptake show that the mutants with high glutamine synthetase levels have increased rates for glutamine, <b>arginine,</b> <b>aspartate,</b> and lysine, but a decreased rate for proline. The relationship between glutamine synthetase levels and uptake was examined in two mutants with reduced, rather than increased, glutamine synthetase production. The uptake rates for glutamine and lysine were lower in these two glutamine auxotrophs than in the Gln+ controls. These results show a correlation between the glutamine synthetase levels and the uptake rates for several amino acids. In addition, the pleiotropic growth of the mutants with elevated glutamine synthetase activities suggests that a nitrogen control response exists for S. typhimurium and that it can be altered by mutations affecting glutamine synthetase regulation...|$|E

Mixed primary cell cultures containing ruminal epithelial (REC) or duodenal muco-sal cells (DMC) were isolated from growing sheep (n = 4) fed a mixed forage-concentrate diet. Cells were incu-bated (90 min) in a Krebs salts-based buffer with either acetate (5 mM) or propionate (5 mM) plus a combination of substrate intermediates (5 mM) for urea synthesis: <b>arginine,</b> <b>aspartate</b> + citrulline (AspC), aspartate + or-nithine + ammonia (AspON), or AspON + N-carbamo-ylglutamate (AspONG) in a 2 × 4 factorial arrangement of treatments. Volatile fatty acid, propionate vs. ace-tate, did not influence net urea synthesis. For REC, net urea synthesis (nmoles(106 cells) − 190 min− 1) was greatest with Arg (54. 5 ± 6. 3) followed by AspC (4. 6 ± 1. 1) and AspONG (3. 6 ± 1. 4). For DMC, net urea synthe-sis for Arg (2. 1 ± 0. 7) andAspONG (1. 9 ± 0. 7) treatments was greater than for AspC (0. 3 ± 0. 7) and AspON (− 0. 6 ± 0. 7) treatments. Thus, for both REC andDMC, arginase activity appeared to be sufficient for catabolism of argi-nine to urea. Furthermore, greater urea synthesis from ammonia, ornithine and aspartate in the presence of theN-acetylglutamate analogue suggests that carbam-oyl phosphate synthetase is probably rate-limiting for urea synthesis and ammonia detoxification by rumi-nant gut tissues.

Eight pigments (chlorophyll a, chlorophyll c, fucoxanthin, zeaxanthin, 19 '-butanoylofucoxanthin, 19 '-hexanoylofucoxanthin, peridinin and phaeophytin a) were identified and confirmed the species viability and their state of senescence. The qualitative composition of the recorded 8 monosaccharides (glucose, galactose, xylose, fucose, mannose, rhamnose, arabinose and glucosamine) and 15 aminoacids (<b>arginine,</b> glutamine, <b>aspartate,</b> serine, lysine, glysine, threonine, alanine, tyrosine, methionine, valine, phenylalanine, isoleucine, leucine and histidine) was similar in all cultures, but their quantitative composition differed among them and this might be due to their differences in species composition. The results also showed that the relative abundance of aminoacids and monosaccharides depended on the physiological state of the cells, the former being more abundant during the exponential phase and the latter mainly during the stationary phase of the cultures...|$|R
40|$|The Manila clam (Ruditapes philippinarum) {{has been}} {{considered}} a good sentinel species for metal pollution monitoring in estuarine tidal flats. Along the Bohai coast of China, there are dominantly distributed three species of clams (White, Liangdao Red and Zebra in Yantai population) endowed with distinct tolerances to environmental stressors. In this study, adductor muscle samples were collected from both control and acute mercury exposed White, Liangdao Red and Zebra clams, and the extracts were analyzed by NMR-based metabolomics to compare the metabolic profiles and responses to the acute mercury exposure to determine the most sensitive clam species capable of acting as abioindicator for heavy metal pollution monitoring. The major abundant metabolites in the White clam sample were branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine and valine), lactate, <b>arginine,</b> <b>aspartate,</b> acetylcholine, homarine and ATP/ADP, while the metabolite profile of Zebra clam sample comprised high levels of glutamine, acetoacetate, betaine, taurine and one unidentified metabolite. For the Liangdao Red clam sample, the metabolite profile relatively exhibited high amount of branched-chain amino acids, arginine, glutamate, succinate, acetylcholine, homarine and two unassigned metabolites. After 48 h exposure of 20 mu g L- 1 Hg 2 +, the metabolic profiles showed significant differences between three clam species, which included increased lactate, succinate, taurine, acetylcholine, betaine and homarine and decreased alanine, arginine, glutamine, glutamate, acetoacetate, glycine and ATP/ADP in White clam samples, and elevated succinate, taurine and acetylcholine, and declined glutamine, glycine, and aspartate in Liangdao Red clam samples, while the increased branched-chain amino acids, lactate, succinate, acetylcholine and homarine, and reduced alanine, acetoacetate, glycine and taurine were observed in the Zebra clam samples. Overall, our findings showed that White clams could be a preferable bioindicator for the metal pollution monitoring based on the more sensitive metabolic changes in the adductor muscle compared with other two (Liangdao Red and Zebra) clam species.

40|$|Plant cells {{resistant}} to specific amino acid analogs {{have been reported}} to accumulate the corresponding free amino acids. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the concentrations of fifteen free amino acids: alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, glutamate, proline, <b>arginine,</b> <b>aspartate,</b> threonine, methionine, lysine, serine, glycine, tryptophan and phenylalanine in Daucus carota cell lines, resistant either to the proline analog azetidine- 2 carboxylic acid (A 2 C), or to the tryptophan analog 5 -methyltryptophan (5 -MT), or to both the analogs combined. This study also intended to determine if these analogs influence the biosynthesis of the above-mentioned fifteen amino acids in the cell line {{resistant to}} A 2 C and 5 -MT. Carrot cell lines resistant to 5 -MT, to A 2 C, or to both the analogs were selected by incubating carrot cells in liquid growth media containing either 0. 3 mM 5 -MT, or 0. 5 mM A 2 C for 6 to 16 weeks. Free amino acid concentrations were then determined in the extracts of the cells. Resistance to 5 -MT resulted in significant increases in the intracellular concentrations of tryptophan, phenylalanine, leucine, valine, isoleucine, and proline. Resistance to A 2 C resulted in significant increase in proline only. Resistance to both the analogs caused increases in proline, lysine, phenylalanine, and tryptophan concentrations. In the cell line resistant to both the analogs, the treatment with 5 -MT caused increases in leucine, proline, aspartate, threonine, lysine, and tryptophan. The treatment with A 2 C caused increases in isoleucine, arginine, threonine, methionine, lysine, and glycine, whereas treatment with both the analogs caused increases in threonine, lysine, phenylalanine, and tryptophan. These results indicate the possibility of a common biosynthetic control of a number of amino acids in carrot cells, resembling that found in microorganisms. It is also evident from the results that the analogs play an active role in the biosynthesis of amino acids in the resistant cell lines...|$|E
40|$|In {{previous}} reports, an E 45 K {{mutation in}} reduced folate carrier (RFC 1) resulted in marked substrate-specific changes in folate binding and the induction of an obligatory inorganic anion requirement for carrier function. In this study, site-directed mutagenesis {{was employed to}} further characterize the role of glutamate- 45 in carrier function by replacement with glutamine, <b>arginine,</b> <b>aspartate,</b> leucine, or tryptophan followed by tranfec-tion of the mutated cDNAs into the MTXrA line, which lacks a functional endogenous carrier. Alterations in transport function with amino acid substitutions at this residue were not charge related. Hence, E 45 Q, E 45 R, and E 45 K all 1) increased carrier affinity for 5 -formyltetrahydrofolate; 4 -fold, 2) increased affin-ity for folic acid; 6 - to 10 -fold, 3) did not change affinity for 5 -methyltetrahydrofolate, and 4) except for E 45 R decreased affinity for methotrexate (2 - to 3 -fold). In contrast, mutations E 45 D, E 45 L, and E 45 W generally reduced affinity for all these folates except for folic acid. Finally, chloride-dependent influx was only noted in the E 45 R mutant. These data further sub-stantiate the important role that glutamate- 45 plays in the se-lectivity of binding of folates to RFC 1 and establish {{that it is the}} addition of a positive charge at this site and not the loss of a negative charge that results in the induced anion dependence. These and other studies indicate that mutations in the first transmembrane domain can have a markedly selective impact on the affinity of RFC 1 for folate compounds and in particularly a highly salutary effect on binding of the oxidized folate, folic acid. The reduced folate carrier (RFC 1), a member of the major facilitator superfamily of transport carriers, delivers folates into cells that are essential for one-carbon-requiring biosyn-thetic reactions (Pao et al., 1998). The RFC 1 gene from var-ious species was recently cloned (Dixon et al., 1994; William...|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{experiment}} is to clone the Crustacean Hyperglycemic Hormone (CHH) gene in Dungeness crab, Metacarcinus magister, and learn how CHH regulates molting in response to temperature. CHH is a neuropeptide synthesized in the X-organ/sinus gland complex (XO/SG) that regulates molting, carbohydrate metabolism, water and ion flux, as well as gonad development. The CHH family motif is highly conserved across crustaceans and includes a 28 amino acid signal peptide, a 42 amino acid crustacean hyperglycemic hormone precursor related peptide (CPRP), and a 72 - 74 amino acid mature hormone. The mature CHH hormone includes six cysteines, two <b>arginines,</b> one <b>aspartate,</b> one phenylalanine, and one asparagine. Juvenile Dungeness crab were exposed to temperatures ranging from 5 - 30 ° C. cDNA was created by extracting RNA from eye stalks and using reverse transcriptase enzyme to create cDNA from the RNA. The cDNA was then amplified using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and extracted after gel electrophoresis was run. Most of the mature CHH nucleotide sequence has been deduced and shows high sequence identity with the shore crab, Carcinus maenas. 54 amino acids have been identified based on the nucleotide sequence...|$|R
40|$|Protein {{phosphorylation}} is a ubiquitous {{post-translational modification}} (PTM) that regulates {{all aspects of}} life. To date, investigation of human cell signalling has focussed on canonical phosphorylation of serine (Ser), threonine (Thr) and tyrosine (Tyr) residues. However, mounting evidence suggests that phosphorylation of histidine also plays {{a central role in}} regulating cell biology. Phosphoproteomics workflows rely on acidic conditions for phosphopeptide enrichment, which are incompatible with the analysis of acid-labile phosphorylation such as histidine. Consequently, the extent of non-canonical phosphorylation is likely to be under-estimated. We report an Unbiased Phosphopeptide enrichment strategy based on Strong Anion Exchange (SAX) chromatography (UPAX), which permits enrichment of acid-labile phosphopeptides for characterisation by mass spectrometry. Using this approach, we identify extensive and positional phosphorylation patterns on histidine, <b>arginine,</b> lysine, <b>aspartate</b> and glutamate in human cell extracts, including 310 phosphohistidine and > 1000 phospholysine sites of protein modification. Remarkably, the extent of phosphorylation on individual non-canonical residues vastly exceeds that of basal phosphotyrosine. Our study reveals the previously unappreciated diversity of protein phosphorylation in human cells, and opens up avenues for exploring roles of acid-labile phosphorylation in any proteome using mass spectrometry...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{aim of the}} {{research}} was to perform a structural modelling analysis on amino acids hydrophobicity in order to identify, characterize and quantify the relationship between the structure and the property. A sample of twenty essential amino acids (alanine, <b>arginine,</b> asparagine, <b>aspartate,</b> cysteine, glutamine, glutamate, glycine, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, proline, serine, threonine, tryptophan, tyrosine, and valine) was investigated by using the Molecular Descriptors Family on the Structure-Activity/Property Relationship approach. The property of interest was the hydrophobic or hydrophilic character measured on twenty-four different scales. The information extracted from the amino acids structure was used in order to generate and to calculate the Molecular Descriptors Family. For each hydrophobicity scale the best performing monovariate model in terms of goodness-of-fit were collected and analyzed. The resulted models have been used in order to predict the hydrophobicity of a sample of eleven non standard amino acids (seleno-L-cysteine, pyrrolysine, lanthionine, 2 -aminoisobutyric acid, dehydroalanine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, ornithine, citrulline, homocysteine, hydroxyproline, and dopamine). All identified models were statistically significant (p < 0. 0001). An internal validation approach was applied for analyzing the validity of th...|$|R
