40|$|Abstract. We generalize Björner <b>and</b> <b>Stanley’s</b> poset of {{compositions}} to m-colored compositions.

While many of the proofs for Björner <b>and</b> <b>Stanley’s</b> poset were simplified by showing isomorphism with the subword order, we remark that with 2 or more colors, our posets are not isomorphic to a subword order. 1...|$|R
