500|$|In mid October 2016, Waters {{announced}} that he would return to North America in 2017 with a pioneering new tour named [...] "Us + Them", stating: [...] "We <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> new show on the road, the content is very secret. It'll be a mixture of stuff from my long career, stuff from my years with Pink Floyd, some new things. Probably 75% of it will be old material and 25% will be new, but it will be all connected by a general theme. It will be a cool show, I promise you. It'll be spectacular like all my shows have been." [...] It is intended that the 44-date Us + Them Tour would visit the United States and Canada, showcase Waters' highlights, start on 26 May 2017 in Kansas City, MO and end on 29 October 2017 in Vancouver, BC. The tour title is derived from the track [...] "Us and Them," [...] from the 1973 Pink Floyd album The Dark Side of the Moon.|$|E

6000|$|... 'O yes; it is good, because {{everybody}} says so. We <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> delightful journey. My new-created uncle, as he seems, and I, and my aunt, and perhaps Charlotte, {{if she is}} well enough, are going to Nice, and other places about there.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All right, George! {{we will do}} {{that for}} you with pleasure.

60|$|I left {{very quietly}} a little later, without {{going up to}} the drawing-room. A few days {{afterwards}} I heard that Meadows had gone.

60|$|Oh, another thing. They <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> me out {{and hang}} me in a little while--no, not for killing Professor Haskell. I got life-imprisonment for that.

6000|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{the winter}} Cowles remarked to me that he {{intended}} to marry Miss Northcott as soon as possible--probably some time in the spring. He was, as I have already remarked, fairly well off, and the young lady had some money of her own, so that there was no pecuniary reason for a long engagement. [...] "We <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> little house out at Corstorphine," [...] he said, [...] "and we hope to see your face at our table, Bob, as often as you can possibly come." [...] I thanked him, and tried to shake off my apprehensions, and persuade myself that all would yet be well.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not at all. You don't {{suppose that}} we are going to remain here quietly, knowing that close by there are white people in the hands of those scoundrels.

If they do, so much the worse for them. Now, will you sit down while the steward lays the cloth for lunch?--it will be ready in two or three minutes; then I will bring the other two {{officers}} down to introduce them to you."

You know he has said that he intends to leave a slice of his fortune to her, and I have no doubt that this lad will get the main bulk of his property. I have often told you about his {{engagement}} to the lad's mother, and how the breaking it off has affected his whole life. It is natural that a lonely man as he is should plan for others. He has no future of his own to look forward to, so he looks forward to some one else's. He has had no interest in life for a great many years, and I think he is making a new one for himself in the future of our girl and this lad.|$|E
6000|$|One {{wanderer}} {{over the}} world who [...] "could, if opportunity afforded, recount many unusual scenes and events," [...] spent several pages ardently {{trying to get to}} the point of his letter, and at last achieved the following: [...] "Still I am neglecting the point I set out to write you about. So will say at once that it has been stated in print that you and one or two others <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> cruize around the world a little fifty- or sixty-foot boat. I therefore cannot get myself to think that a man of your attainments and experience would attempt such a proceeding, which is nothing less than courting death in that way. And even if you were to escape for some time, your whole Person, and those with you would be bruised from the ceaseless motion of a craft of the above size, even if she were padded, a thing not usual at sea." [...] Thank you, kind friend, thank you for that qualification, [...] "a thing not usual at sea." [...] Nor is this friend ignorant of the sea. As he says of himself, [...] "I am not a land-lubber, and I have sailed every sea and ocean." [...] And he winds up his letter with: [...] "Although not wishing to offend, it would be madness to take any woman outside the bay even, in such a craft." ...|$|E
