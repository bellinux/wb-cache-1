5|$|There are two distinct, though connected, {{regions of}} ER that differ in {{structure}} and function: smooth ER and rough ER. The {{rough endoplasmic reticulum}} is so named because the cytoplasmic surface is covered with ribosomes, giving it <b>a</b> <b>bumpy</b> appearance when viewed through an electron microscope. The smooth ER appears smooth since its cytoplasmic surface lacks ribosomes.|$|E

25|$|A second {{consideration}} is the rotational energy {{stored in the}} wheels. The pinewood derby car converts gravitational potential energy into translational kinetic energy (speed) plus rotational energy. Heavier wheels have a greater moment of inertia and their spinning takes away energy that would otherwise contribute to {{the speed of the}} car. A standard wheel has a mass of 2.6 g, but this can be reduced to as little as 1 g by removing material from the inside of the wheel. A raised wheel can reduce the rotational energy up to one-quarter, but this advantage is less with <b>a</b> <b>bumpy</b> track.|$|E
25|$|Jean-Éric Vergne was {{eliminated}} in Q1, out-qualified by the Caterhams of Heikki Kovalainen and Vitaly Petrov. Petrov was faster than his teammate {{for most of}} the Q1 session, but a late lap from Kovalinen — which included <b>a</b> <b>bumpy</b> ride across the kerbs at the final chicane — put him two-tenths of a second clear of the Russian. Pedro de la Rosa outqualified both Marussia cars by half a second, with teammate Narain Karthikeyan within a tenth of a second of Charles Pic, completing the final row of the grid. Sebastian Vettel was the fastest driver in the session.|$|E
25|$|After {{his return}} to the front, he was wounded in the throat by a sniper's bullet. At 6ft 2 in (1.88 m) Orwell was {{considerably}} taller than the Spanish fighters and had been warned against standing against the trench parapet. Unable to speak, and with blood pouring from his mouth, Orwell was carried on a stretcher to Siétamo, loaded on an ambulance and after <b>a</b> <b>bumpy</b> journey via Barbastro arrived at the hospital at Lérida. He recovered sufficiently to get up and on 27 May 1937 was sent on to Tarragona and two days later to a POUM sanatorium in the suburbs of Barcelona. The bullet had missed his main artery by the barest margin and his voice was barely audible. It had been such a clean shot that the wound immediately went through the process of cauterisation. He received electrotherapy treatment and was declared medically unfit for service.|$|E

25|$|Downriver {{transport}} {{could be}} quite fast for the day. A traveler bound from Walla Walla would take the stage to Wallula, board the Colonel Wright or another steamer, then head downriver to Celilo. After <b>a</b> <b>bumpy</b> ride over the portage, the traveler would arrive at The Dalles where an overnight stay would be necessary {{at one of the}} hotels. The next morning the traveler would board a steamboat on the middle river, perhaps the Oneonta, for a morning run down to the Upper Cascades. There again the traveler disembarked, usually on the favored north side, and rode on the portage railway to the landing at the Lower Cascades. There, a steamer, possibly the Wilson G. Hunt, then ran downriver to Portland, which the traveler reached some thirty hours after leaving Walla Walla, a feat which was considered remarkable at that time. The genius of the Oregon Steam Navigation Company was to control all the boats on all the steps of the staircase, and the portages too, thus achieving a monopoly on transport in the days before there were roads or railways capable of mounting any competition. The Wright was simply superb at making money, earning as much as $2,500 a trip in passenger fares alone.|$|E

Barber added [...] "She also doesn't play games and she says what she thinks. Rhys loves that about Vanessa and sees her as someone he can trust, which is rare for him." [...] Vanessa and Rhys eventually give into their attraction for one another and share a kiss in Harold's Store. Barber commented that his character enjoys making the first move, so {{he is the one who}} goes in for the kiss. The actor also thought it would be interesting to see his character in a relationship. TV Week's Andrew Mercado observed that Rhys should prepare for <b>a</b> <b>bumpy</b> road ahead, with Vanessa living under the same roof as Lucas. Rhys and Vanessa take their relationship to the next level in a consultation room at Erinsborough Hospital. However, they are shocked when Karl walks in on them.|$|E

500|$|For {{the change}} from Ghost Rider to LMD, Joseph McCabe at Nerdist said that any doubts he had about the change [...] "are more or less eliminated" [...] by the series take on a robotic antagonist, which he called [...] "Avengers: Age of Ultron done right ... where it most {{obviously}} improves on the overstuffed second Avengers film is in the humor department". Schwartz called the transition smooth, and felt the series' ongoing Inhuman subplot complimented the LMD storyline well. Valentine said that the beginning of LMD [...] "doesn’t maintain the heights of [...] days with Ghost Rider in the driver’s seat, but it does manage to remain a solid entry on the airwaves." [...] He was very critical of the Inhuman subplot, calling the Watchdogs [...] "pretty much played out at this point" [...] and feeling the Inhumans had become stale after the previous two seasons. Fitzpatrick also criticized the [...] "flat" [...] Inhuman storyline, but felt the change to LMD [...] "got off to the best possible start" [...] given the [...] "obviously less of an immediate hook" [...] than Ghost Rider. Beginning the Agents of Hydra pod, Schwartz said [...] "this return episode more than delivered" [...] on the previous episode's cliffhanger. She was satisfied that the Framework reality was not undone within a single episode, and was hopeful that the remaining episodes of the season would offer [...] "similar surprises [...] our expectations". Valentine felt [...] "What If..." [...] "made for a very good start" [...] to the pod, feeling it [...] "continues {{to build on the}} goodwill created by season 4 of S.H.I.E.L.D. presenting an interesting concept and world to be explored". McCown-Levy continued the praise, saying [...] "This could’ve been a sodden slog through too-obvious reveals and portentous doom and gloom. Instead, S.H.I.E.L.D. kept its fleet and efficient pacing, but bent it to the service of a dark and compelling narrative arc already paying dividends in terms of rewarding long-time viewers with deep-pull references and stories". Fitzpatrick, however, felt the episode [...] "stumbled" [...] and was [...] "something of <b>a</b> <b>bumpy</b> reentry into season 4, and doubly so for anyone who lost sight of the Life Model Decoy conflict in play, or harbor concern ABC might not order a fifth season." [...] He found it difficult to determine the rules at play in the Framework, and felt the storyline was done more so because the [...] "producers missed working with Brett Dalton".|$|E

He {{would go on to}} name Man of Steel the best Superhero movie of 2013. Jim Vejvoda of IGN gave Man of Steel a 9 out of 10 while praising the action {{sequences}} and the performances of Kevin Costner, Russell Crowe and Michael Shannon. [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave it a 3 stars out of 4, saying, [...] "Caught in the slipstream between action and angst, Man of Steel is <b>a</b> <b>bumpy</b> ride for sure. But there's no way to stay blind to its wonders." [...] Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter said rebooting the franchise was unnecessary, but that the film was confident enough and Snyder's attention to detail careful enough that audiences could overlook another reboot. PopMatters journalist J.C. Maçek III, wrote, [...] "The path of this flawed savior isn’t quite the one that we have been led to expect and many fans will love that and many fans will decry its comic book-divergent choices. On the other hand, barring Lois Lane’s own knowledge of the dual nature of Clark and Superman (thus depriving one of fiction’s greatest reveals), the hero we see in the final moments of Man of Steel is nothing if not the character Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster created… with just a bit more in the 'imperfections' column." [...] Steve Persall of the Tampa Bay Times stated that, [...] "Man of Steel is more than just Avengers-sized escapism; it's an artistic introduction to a movie superhero we only thought we knew." [...] Time magazine's Richard Corliss said, [...] "The movie finds its true, lofty footing not when it displays Kal-El’s extraordinary powers, but when it dramatizes Clark Kent’s roiling humanity. The super part of Man of Steel is just okay, but the man part is super." [...] In a review on Roger Ebert's website, Matt Zoller Seitz awarded the film three out of four stars, calling it an [...] "astonishing movie" [...] and praising the conflict between Clark and Zod. But he criticized the film for not having more personal and intimate moments between Clark and Lois. In 2014, Empire ranked Man of Steel the 286th greatest film ever made on their list of [...] "The 301 Greatest Movies Of All Time" [...] as voted by the magazine's readers.|$|E
