There are many commercial kits available that will carry out this step using some form of reverse transcriptase. PCR is then carried out to amplify the pool of cDNA sequences.

40|$|International audienceSpark-tube {{experiments}} {{and analysis of}} meteorite contents {{have led to the}} widespread notion that abiotic organic molecules were the first life components. However, there is a contradiction between the abundance of simple molecules, such as the amino acids glycine and alanine, observed in these studies, and the minimal functional complexity that even the least sophisticated living system should require. I will argue that although simple abiotic molecules must have primed proto-metabolic pathways, only Darwinian evolving systems could have generated life. This condition may have been initially fulfilled by both replicating RNAs and autocatalytic reaction chains, such as the reductive citric acid cycle. The interactions between nucleotides and biotic amino acids, which conferred new functionalities to the former, also resulted in the progressive stereochemical recognition of the latter by cognate anticodons. At this point only large enough amino acids would be recognized by the primordial <b>RNA</b> <b>adaptors</b> and could polymerize forming the first peptides. The gene duplication of <b>RNA</b> <b>adaptors</b> was a crucial event. By removing one of the anticodons from the acceptor stem the new <b>RNA</b> <b>adaptor</b> liberated itself from the stereochemical constraint and could be acylated by smaller amino acids. The emergence of messenger RNA and codon capture followed...|$|R
40|$|The {{assembly}} of spliceosomal U snRNPs in meta-zoans requires nuclear export of U snRNA precur-sors. Four factors, nuclear cap-binding complex (CBC), phosphorylated <b>adaptor</b> for <b>RNA</b> export (PHAX), the export receptor CRM 1 and RanGTP, {{gather at the}} m 7 G-cap-proximal region and form the U snRNA export complex. Here we show that the multifunctional RNA-binding proteins p 54 nrb/ NonO and PSF are U snRNA export stimulatory factors. These proteins, likely as a heterodimer, ac-celerate the recruitment of PHAX, and subsequently CRM 1 and Ran onto the RNA substrates in vitro, which mediates efficient U snRNA export in vivo. Our results reveal a new layer of regulation for U snRNA export and, hence, spliceosomal U snRNP biogenesis...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn metazoa, {{assembly}} of spliceosomal U snRNPs requires nuclear export of U snRNA precursors. Export {{depends upon the}} RNA cap structure, nuclear cap-binding complex (CBC), the export receptor CRM 1 /Xpo 1, and RanGTP. These components are however insufficient to support U snRNA export. We identify PHAX (phosphorylated <b>adaptor</b> for <b>RNA</b> export) as the additonal factor required for U snRNA export complex assembly in vitro. In vivo, PHAX is required for U snRNA export but not for CRM 1 -mediated export in general. PHAX is phosphorylated in the nucleus and then exported with RNA to the cytoplasm, where it is dephosphorylated. PHAX phosphorylation is essential for export complex assembly while its dephosphorylation causes export complex disassembly. The compartmentalized PHAX phosphorylation cycle {{can contribute to the}} directionality of export...|$|R
40|$|The {{genetic code}} {{is thought to}} have {{developed}} from an early system of RNA-dependent peptide synthesis. To investigate one kind of template-like peptide synthesis that might emerge from an RNA world, we constructed highly reactive aminoacyl phosphate oligonucleotides as adaptors that bound to RNA guide sequences. The reactive aminoacyl groups mimic a chemistry found in modern protein biosynthesis. Guide sequence interactions with adaptors were borrowed in part from universal contacts seen between tRNAs and rRNA. With these constructions, di- and tripeptides formed in a single guide sequence-dependent reaction. The order of amino acids was not random but directional in a way consistent with substrate reactivities. No ribosomes or ribozymes were required. Thus, aminoacyl phosphate <b>adaptors</b> and <b>RNA</b> guides could, in principle, have been intermediates in the transition from the RNA world to modern template-dependent protein synthesis...|$|R
40|$|In metazoa, {{a subset}} of spliceosomal U snRNAs are {{exported}} from the nucleus after transcription. This export occurs in a large complex containing a U snRNA, the nuclear cap binding complex (CBC), the leucine-rich nuclear export signal receptor CRM 1 /Xpo 1, RanGTP, and the recently identified phosphoprotein PHAX (phosphorylated <b>adaptor</b> for <b>RNA</b> export). Previous results indicated that PHAX made direct contact with RNA, CBC, and Xpo 1 in the U snRNA export complex. We have now performed a systematic characterization of the functional domains of PHAX. The most evolutionarily conserved region of PHAX is {{shown to be a}} novel RNA-binding domain that is essential for U snRNA export. In addition, PHAX contains two major nuclear localization signals (NLSs) that are required for its recycling to the nucleus after export. The interaction domain of PHAX with CBC is at least partly distinct from the RNA-binding domain and the NLSs. Thus, the different interaction domains of PHAX allow it to act as a scaffold for the assembly of U snRNA export complexes...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIt is only {{recently}} that the abundant presence of circular RNAs (circRNAs) in all kingdoms of Life, including the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus abyssi, has emerged. This led us to investigate the physiological significance of a previously observed weak intramolecular ligation activity of Pab 1020 RNA ligase. Here we demonstrate that this enzyme, despite sharing significant sequence similarity with DNA ligases, is indeed an RNA-specific polynucleotide ligase efficiently acting on physiologically significant substrates. Using a combination of RNA immunoprecipitation assays and RNA-seq, our genome-wide studies revealed 133 individual circRNA loci in P. abyssi. The large majority of these loci interacted with Pab 1020 in cells and circularization of selected C/D Box and 5 S rRNA transcripts was confirmed biochemically. Altogether these studies revealed that Pab 1020 is required for RNA circularization. Our results further suggest the functional speciation of an ancestral NTase domain and/or DNA ligase towards RNA ligase activity and prompt for further characterization of the widespread functions of circular RNAs in prokaryotes. Detailed insight into the cellular substrates of Pab 1020 may facilitate {{the development of new}} biotechnological applications e. g. in ligation of preadenylated <b>adaptors</b> to <b>RNA</b> molecules...|$|R
40|$|Sorting of transmembrane cargo into clathrin-coated vesicles {{requires}} endocytic <b>adaptors,</b> yet <b>RNA</b> interference (RNAi) -mediated {{gene silencing}} of the AP- 2 adaptor complex only disrupts internalization of {{a subset of}} clathrin-dependent cargo. This suggests alternate clathrin-associated sorting proteins participate in cargo capture at the cell surface, and a provocative recent proposal is that discrete endocytic cargo are sorted into compositionally and functionally distinct clathrin coats. We show here that the FXNPXY-type internalization signal within cytosolic domain of the LDL receptor is recognized redundantly by two phosphotyrosine-binding domain proteins, Dab 2 and ARH; diminishing both proteins by RNAi leads to conspicuous LDL receptor accumulation at the cell surface. AP- 2 –dependent uptake of transferrin ensues relatively normally {{in the absence of}} Dab 2 and ARH, clearly revealing delegation of sorting operations at the bud site. AP- 2, Dab 2, ARH, transferrin, and LDL receptors are all present within the vast majority of clathrin structures at the surface, challenging the general existence of specialized clathrin coats for segregated internalization of constitutively internalized cargo. However, Dab 2 expression is exceptionally low in hepatocytes, likely accounting for the pathological hypercholesterolemia that accompanies ARH loss...|$|R
40|$|PHAX (phosphorylated <b>adaptor</b> for <b>RNA</b> export) {{is the key}} {{regulator}} of U snRNA nuclear export in metazoa. Our {{previous work}} revealed that PHAX is phosphorylated in the nucleus and is exported {{as a component of}} the U snRNA export complex to the cytoplasm, where it is dephosphorylated (M. Ohno, A. Segref, A. Bachi, M. Wilm, and I. W. Mattaj, Cell 101 : 187 - 198, 2000). PHAX phosphorylation is essential for export complex assembly, whereas its dephosphorylation causes export complex disassembly. Thus, PHAX is subject to a compartmentalized phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycle that contributes to transport directionality. However, neither essential PHAX phosphorylation sites nor the modifying enzymes that contribute to the compartmentalized system have been identified. Here, we identify PHAX phosphorylation sites that are necessary and sufficient for U snRNA export. Mutation of the phosphorylation sites inhibited U snRNA export in a dominant-negative way. We also show, by both biochemical and RNA interference knockdown experiments, that the nuclear kinase and the cytoplasmic phosphatase for PHAX are CK 2 kinase and protein phosphatase 2 A, respectively. Our results reveal the composition of the compartmentalized phosphorylation/dephosphorylation system that regulates U snRNA export. This finding was surprising in that such a specific system for U snRNA export regulation is composed of two such universal regulators, suggesting that this compartmentalized system is used more broadly for gene expression regulation...|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe long noncoding Xist RNA inactivates one X chromosome in {{the female}} mammal. Current models posit that Xist induces {{silencing}} as it spreads along X and recruits Polycomb complexes. However, the mechanisms for Xist loading and spreading are currently unknown. Here, we define the nucleation center for Xist RNA and show that YY 1 docks Xist particles onto the X chromosome. YY 1 is a “bivalent” protein, capable of binding both RNA and DNA through different sequence motifs. Xist's exclusive attachment to the inactive X is determined by an epigenetically regulated trio of YY 1 sites as well as allelic origin. Specific YY 1 -to-RNA and YY 1 -to-DNA contacts are required to load Xist particles onto X. YY 1 interacts with Xist RNA through Repeat C. We propose that YY 1 acts as <b>adaptor</b> between regulatory <b>RNA</b> and chromatin targets...|$|R
40|$|The {{origin of}} the genetic code {{in the context of}} an RNA world is a major problem in the field of biophysical chemistry. In this paper, we {{describe}} how the polymerization of amino acids along RNA templates can be affected by the properties of both molecules. Considering a system without enzymes, in which the tRNAs (the translation adaptors) are not loaded selectively with amino acids, we show that an elementary translation governed by a Michaelis-Menten type of kinetics can follow different polymerization regimes: random polymerization, homopolymerization and coded polymerization. The regime under which the system is running is set by the relative concentrations of the amino acids and the kinetic constants involved. We point out that the coding regime can naturally occur under prebiotic conditions. It generates partially coded proteins through a mechanism which is remarkably robust against non-specific interactions (mismatches) between the <b>adaptors</b> and the <b>RNA</b> template. Features of the genetic code support the existence of this early translation system...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The FF domain is conserved {{across all}} eukaryotes and usually {{acts as an}} <b>adaptor</b> module in <b>RNA</b> {{metabolism}} and transcription. Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes two FF domain proteins, Prp 40, {{a component of the}} U 1 snRNP, and Ypr 152 c, a protein of unknown function. The structure of Prp 40, its relationship to other proteins within the U 1 snRNP, and its precise function remain little understood. Results Here we have investigated the essentiality and interaction properties of the FF domains of yeast Prp 40. We show that the C-terminal two FF domains of Prp 40 are dispensable. Deletion of additional FF domains is lethal. The first FF domain of Prp 40 binds to U 1 protein Luc 7 in yeast two-hybrid and GST pulldown experiments. FF domains 2 and 3 bind to Snu 71, another known U 1 protein. Peptide array screens identified binding sites for FF 1 - 2 within Snu 71 (NDVHY) and for FF 1 within Luc 7 (ϕ[FHL] × [KR] × [GHL] with ϕ being a hydrophobic amino acid). Conclusion Prp 40, Luc 7, and Snu 71 appear to form a subcomplex within the yeast U 1 snRNP. Our data suggests that the N-terminal FF domains are critical for these interactions. Crystallization of Prp 40, Luc 7, and Snu 71 have failed so far but co-crystallization of pairs or the whole tri-complex may facilitate crystallographic and further functional analysis. </p...|$|R
