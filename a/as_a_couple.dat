5|$|Chad Harris-Crane is {{the main}} love {{interest}} and later husband of Whitney Russell; {{he is also the}} father of Miles Davis Harris-Crane and another child. Chad's early appearances focus on his search for his biological parents, and his love triangle with sisters Whitney and Simone.

During his separation from Whitney, Chad initiates a sexual relationship with Vincent Clarkson and continues it after his marriage. He is unaware he is committing incest because he is Vincent's half-uncle, adoptive half-cousin, and half-brother-in-law. After catching Chad having sex with Vincent, Whitney files for divorce; they later begin to reconcile through helping Theresa Lopez-Fitzgerald and Ethan Winthrop reunite <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple.</b> Their potential reconciliation is cut short when Chad is murdered by Alistair.|$|E
