5|$|Lead is {{the most}} {{prevalent}} heavy metal contaminant. Levels in the aquatic environments of industrialised societies have been estimated to be {{two to three times}} those of pre-industrial levels. As a component of tetraethyl lead, , it was used extensively in gasoline during the 1930s–1970s. Although the use of leaded gasoline was largely phased out in North America by 1996, soils next to roads built before this time retain high lead concentrations. Later research demonstrated <b>a</b> <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> correlation between the usage rate of leaded gasoline and violent crime in the United States; taking into account a 22-year time lag (for the average age of violent criminals), the violent crime curve virtually tracked the lead exposure curve.|$|E
5|$|Their {{experiment}} showed <b>a</b> <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> {{difference in}} {{the thickness of the}} stomach mucosa. The mucosa of rats fed raw or cooked potato modified with the GNA gene was thicker than that of rats fed the unmodified potato. The crypt length in the jejunum was greater on rats fed the raw modified potato, although there was no statistical difference observed in the rats fed the cooked potato. As these effects were not observed in rats fed the control potatoes spiked with GNA, Pusztai concluded that the differences were a result of the transformation procedure, rather than the presence of GNA. Pusztai's collaborator Stanley Ewen said that the cauliflower mosaic virus used as a promoter could likely be the cause of the observed changes.|$|E

25|$|ACE inhibitors were {{associated}} with <b>a</b> <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> 10% mortality reduction: (HR 0.90; 95% CI, 0.84–0.97; P=0.004). In contrast, no significant mortality reduction was observed with ARB treatment (HR 0.99; 95% CI, 0.94–1.04; P=0.683).

30|$|Just {{like in the}} {{landmark}} study on early goal directed therapy [74], protocol patients received significantly more fluids during the intervention period, whereas these patients received less fluid during the subsequent observation period. In addition, significantly more patients were treated with vasodilators (predominantly nitroglycerine) in the protocol group. These differences in treatment were associated with <b>an</b> almost <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> (p = 0.067), 20 % relative reduction in mortality in addition to <b>a</b> strong <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> reduction in morbidity (duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay, p = 0.006).|$|R

The empirical results show that the proportion of patient care paid for by Medicare managed care has <b>a</b> positive, <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> relationship with the market share of for-profit hospitals. Medicare managed care reimburses health care providers prospectively, and a larger portion of prospective reimbursements is received by for-profit hospitals, whose market share consequently increases.
