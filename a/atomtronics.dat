We postulate an atomtronic phase gate consisting of four wells in a Bose-Hubbard configuration, for which the semiclassical dynamics are controllable using the phase of the atomic mode in one of the wells. We show that the quantum predictions of the positive-P representation for the performance of this device have little relation to those found semiclassically, and that the performance depends markedly on the actual quantum states of the initially occupied modes. We find that initial coherent states lead to closest to classical dynamics, but that initial Fock states give results that are quite different.

40|$|We {{consider}} a correlated Bose gas tightly confined into a ring shaped lattice, {{in the presence}} of an artificial gauge potential inducing a persistent current through it. A weak link painted on the ring acts as a source of coherent back-scattering for the propagating gas, interfering with the forward scattered current. This system defines an atomic counterpart of the rf-SQUID: the <b>atomtronics</b> quantum interference device (AQUID). The goal of the present study is to corroborate the emergence of an effective two-level system in such a setup and to assess its quality, in terms of its inner resolution and its separation {{from the rest of the}} many-body spectrum, across the different physical regimes. In order to achieve this aim, we examine the dependence of the qubit energy gap on the bosonic density, the interaction strength, and the barrier depth, and we show how the superposition between current states appears in the momentum distribution (time-of-flight) images.

40|$|We numerically investigate, {{using the}} time {{evolving}} block decimation algorithm, the quantum transport of ultra-cold bosonic atoms {{in a double}} well optical lattice through slow and periodic modulation of the lattice parameters (intra- and inter-well tunneling, chemical potential, etc.). The transport of atoms {{does not depend on}} the rate of change of the parameters (as along as the change is slow) and can distribute atoms in optical lattices at the quantized level without involving external forces. The transport of atoms depends on the atom filling in each double well and the interaction between atoms. In the strongly interacting region, the bosonic atoms share the same transport properties as non-interacting fermions with quantized transport at the half filling and no atom transport at the integer filling. In the weakly interacting region, the number of the transported atoms is proportional to the atom filling. We show the signature of the quantum transport from the momentum distribution of atoms that can measured in the time of flight image. A semiclassical transport model is developed to explain the numerically observed transport of bosonic atoms in the non-interacting and strongly interacting limits.

40|$|An {{asymmetric}} atom trap is investigated as a {{means to}} implement a "battery" that supplies ultracold atoms to an atomtronic circuit. The battery model is derived from a scheme for continuous loading of a non-dissipative atom trap proposed by Roos et al. (Europhysics Letters V 61, 187 (2003)). The trap is defined by longitudinal and transverse trap frequencies and corresponding trap energy heights. The battery's ability to supply power to a load is evaluated as a function of an input atom flux and power. For given trap parameters and input flux the battery is shown to have a resonantly optimum value of input power. The battery behavior can be cast in terms of an equivalent circuit model; specifically, for fixed input flux and power the battery is modeled in terms of a Thévenin equivalent chemical potential and internal resistance. The internal resistance establishes the maximum power that can be supplied to a circuit, the heat that will be generated by the battery, and that noise will be imposed on the circuit. We argue that any means of implementing a battery for <b>atomtronics</b> can be represented by a Thévenin equivalent and that its performance will likewise be determined by an internal resistance.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the charge current in a {{conductor}} is proportional to the applied electric field. This famous relation, known as Ohm’s law, is the result of relaxation of the current due to charge carriers undergoing collisions, predominantly with impurities and lattice vi-brations in the material. The field of spintronics 1 – 5, where the spin of the electron is ma-nipulated rather than its charge, has recently also led to interest in spin currents. Contrary to charge currents, these spin currents can be subject to strong relaxation due to collisions between different spin species, a phenomenon known as spin drag 6. This effect has been observed for electrons in semi-conductors 7 and for cold fermionic atoms 8, 9, where in both cases it is reduced at low temperatures due to the fermionic nature of the particles. Here, we perform a transport experiment using ultra-cold bosonic atoms and observe spin drag for bosons for the first time. By lowering the temperature we find that spin drag for bosons is enhanced in the quantum regime due to Bose stimulation, which is in agreement with recent theoretical predictions 10.

40|$|<b>Atomtronics</b> is an {{emerging}} interdisciplinary field that seeks new functionality by creating devices and circuits where ultra-cold atoms, often superfluids, {{play a role}} analogous to the electrons in electronics. Hysteresis is widely used in electronic circuits, e. g., it is routinely observed in superconducting circuits and is essential in rf-superconducting quantum interference devices [SQUIDs]. Furthermore, hysteresis is as fundamental to superfluidity (and superconductivity) as quantized persistent currents, critical velocity, and Josephson effects. Nevertheless, in spite of multiple theoretical predictions, hysteresis has not been previously observed in any superfluid, atomic-gas Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Here we demonstrate hysteresis in a quantized atomtronic circuit: a ring of superfluid BEC obstructed by a rotating weak link. We directly detect hysteresis between quantized circulation states, in contrast to superfluid liquid helium experiments that observed hysteresis directly in systems where the quantization of flow could not be observed and indirectly in systems that showed quantized flow. Our techniques allow us to tune {{the size of the}} hysteresis loop and to consider the fundamental excitations that accompany hysteresis. The results suggest that the relevant excitations involved in hysteresis are vortices and indicate that dissipation {{plays an important role in}} the dynamics. Controlled hysteresis in atomtronic circuits may prove to be a crucial feature for the development of practical devices, just as it has in electronic circuits like memory, digital noise filters (e. g., Schmitt triggers), and magnetometers (e. g., SQUIDs).
