5|$|Furthermore, the Jaguar M was expensive, {{limiting}} {{the size of}} the force the French Navy could afford. In 1971, Dassault proposed the Super Étendard, claiming that it was a simpler <b>and</b> <b>cheap</b> development of the existing Étendard IV, and in 1973, the French Navy agreed to order it instead of the Jaguar, although rising costs of the Super Étendard meant that only 71 of the planned 100 aircraft were purchased. The M was cancelled by the French government in 1973.|$|E

5|$|The {{immediate}} {{reason why}} these ships were ordered was for local coast defence {{during the war}} scare during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, but they were chosen for several other reasons. They were small <b>and</b> <b>cheap,</b> and their shallow draft was thought to limit them to defensive operations, which appealed to economy and defence-minded Members of Parliament. The Admiralty, however, envisioned them attacking shallow-water ports that larger ironclads could not enter and operating in the shallow waters of the Baltic Sea.|$|E

5|$|Domestic sheep {{provide a}} wide array of raw materials. Wool {{was one of the first}} textiles, {{although}} in the late 20th century wool prices began to fall dramatically as the result of the popularity <b>and</b> <b>cheap</b> prices for synthetic fabrics. For many sheep owners, the cost of shearing is greater than the possible profit from the fleece, making subsisting on wool production alone practically impossible without farm subsidies. Fleeces are used as material in making alternative products such as wool insulation. In the 21st century, the sale of meat is the most profitable enterprise in the sheep industry, even though far less sheep meat is consumed than chicken, pork or beef.|$|E
5|$|In 1866, Fred {{encountered}} {{two young}} farmers in Connecticut {{who had spent}} time on duty as Union soldiers in Florida during the war. He learned from them that land there was plentiful <b>and</b> <b>cheap,</b> and many recently emancipated blacks were available at low wages to work it. When he shared this information with his mother, Stowe and her husband Calvin Ellis Stowe considered it a prime opportunity to hasten their son's rehabilitation. For $10,000 ($ in 2009) she purchased a cotton plantation near Orange Park, south of Jacksonville, named Laurel Grove, that was originally established by slave trader Zephaniah Kingsley in 1803 and managed in part by his African wife, Anna Madgigine Jai, until 1811.|$|E

5|$|The years {{following}} World War I were severely testing {{for the owners}} of many great estates. The staff both indoor and outdoor, which had previously been plentiful, essential, <b>and</b> <b>cheap,</b> were now in short supply.

Female domestic staff had been called up for war service in factories, and now realised there was an easier and better paid existence outside of {{the gates of the}} great country houses. With both fortunes and staff depleted many owners of country houses now fought a losing battle to retain them.|$|E

5|$|As {{is common}} in {{frontier}} societies, the Southern Rhodesian settler community was mostly male: {{at the time of}} the First World War, white females were outnumbered by males almost two to one. Because white women were so marriageable <b>and</b> <b>cheap</b> black labour was easily available to handle domestic duties, most female settlers did not work and spent most of their days supervising the household and family. The average white woman in the colony continued to live this kind of life during the war, in marked contrast to her British counterpart, who in many cases went to replace the male factory workers and farm labourers who went to war. In Rhodesia little of this sort occurred: there were no munitions factories, and the idea of women working down the country's mines was not considered practical. Some white farmers' wives took over management of the land in their husbands' absence, but this was quite unusual.|$|E
5|$|Given these shortcomings, any modern {{weapons that}} were {{available}} were allocated to the British Army, and the Home Guard was forced to supplement the meagre amount of outdated weapons and ammunition they had with ad hoc weapons. One such weapon was the Northover Projector, the invention of Major Robert Harry Northover. Northover, {{an officer in the}} Home Guard, designed it to be an easily manufactured <b>and</b> <b>cheap</b> anti-tank weapon, costing just under £10 to produce, excluding the required tripod. The Major wrote directly to the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, with his design and arranged for Churchill to attend a demonstration of the Northover Projector. The Prime Minister approved of the weapon and gave it his personal endorsement, ordering in October 1940 that the weapon be mass-produced {{on a scale of one}} for every Home Guard platoon.|$|E
5|$|Single {{cylinder}} {{consists of}} a single large cylinder, usually back mounted, with one first-stage regulator, and usually two second-stage regulators. This configuration is simple <b>and</b> <b>cheap</b> but it has only a single breathing gas supply: it has no redundancy in case of failure. If the cylinder or first-stage regulator fails, the diver is totally out of air and faces a life-threatening emergency. Recreational diver training agencies train divers {{to rely on a}} buddy to assist them in this situation. The skill of gas sharing is trained on most entry level scuba courses. This equipment configuration, although common with entry-level divers and used for most sport diving, is not recommended by training agencies for any dive where decompression stops are needed, or where there is an overhead environment (wreck diving, cave diving, or ice diving) as it provides no functional redundancy.|$|E

5|$|The Han Chancellor and King of Wei Cao Cao (155–220 AD) {{made the}} final {{significant}} attempt {{to limit the}} power of wealthy landowners. Cao Cao established government-managed agricultural colonies for landless commoners; in exchange for land <b>and</b> <b>cheap</b> equipment, the farmers paid {{a portion of their}} crop yield. In the 120s BC, Emperor Wu had attempted to establish agricultural colonies in the northwestern frontier of the newly conquered Hexi Corridor (in modern Gansu). 600,000 new settlers farmed on these state lands using seeds, draft animals and equipment loaned by the government. An imperial edict in 85 AD ordered the local governments of commanderies and subordinate kingdoms to resettle landless peasants onto state-owned lands, where they would be paid wages, provided with crop seeds, loaned farming tools and exempted from rent payments for five years and poll taxes for three years. The edict also allowed peasants to return to their native counties at any time. Subsequent governments of the Three Kingdoms established agricultural colonies on these models.|$|E
5|$|The {{extension}} of the Bridgewater Canal to Runcorn was completed as far as Sale by 1765, and transformed the town's economy by providing a quick <b>and</b> <b>cheap</b> route into Manchester for fresh produce. Farmers who took their wares to market in Manchester brought back night soil to fertilise the fields. Not everyone benefited from the canal however; several yeomen claimed that their crops were damaged by flooding from the Barfoot Bridge aqueduct. A 1777 map shows the village of Cross Street, {{on the site of}} the road now of the same name, divided between the townships of Sale and Ashton upon Mersey. The village was first referred to in 1586 and is believed to have originated around this time. The map also shows that Sale was spread out, mainly consisting of farmhouses around Dane Road, Fairy Lane, and Old Hall Road. Sale absorbed Cross Street as it expanded.|$|E
5|$|The period {{also saw}} the rise of piracy across the Eastern Mediterranean. Pirate {{activity}} was high in the Aegean, while pirate captains frequently offering themselves as mercenaries to {{one or the other}} of the region's powers, providing for the latter a quick <b>and</b> <b>cheap</b> way of raising a fleet for particular expeditions, without the costs of a standing navy. Thus a Byzantine fleet of 66 vessels sent by Isaac II to recapture Cyprus from Isaac Komnenos was destroyed by the pirate Margaritus of Brindisi, who was in the employ of the Normans of Sicily. The depredations of the pirates, especially the Genoese captain Kaphoures, described by Niketas Choniates and his brother, the Metropolitan of Athens Michael Choniates, finally forced the Angeloi to action. The fleet tax was once again levied from the coastal regions and a navy of 30 ships was equipped, which was entrusted to the Calabrian pirate Steiriones. Despite scoring a few early successes, Steiriones' fleet was destroyed in a surprise attack by Kaphoures off Sestos. A second fleet, augmented by Pisan vessels and again commanded by Steiriones, was finally able to defeat Kaphoures and end his raids.|$|E
