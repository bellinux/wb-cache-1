50|$|Is an {{upgraded}} {{version of the}} Mark 3. It extends Air-to-Air operating range by introducing a new Air-to-Air mode which increases <b>acquisition</b> <b>range</b> by 100% at low altitudes and 40% at high altitudes.

50|$|There are two MICA variants; MICA RF has {{an active}} radar homing seeker and MICA IR has an imaging infra-red homing seeker. Both seekers are {{designed}} to filter out counter-measures such as chaff and decoy flares. A thrust vector control unit fitted to the rocket motor increases the missile’s agility. The missile is capable of lock-on after launch (LOAL) which means {{it is capable of}} engaging targets outside its seeker’s at-launch <b>acquisition</b> <b>range.</b> Mounted on the Rafale, the MICA IR can provide IR imagery to the central data processing system, thus acting as an extra sensor.|$|E
50|$|The rapid {{decline and}} {{eventual}} {{fall of the}} Soviet Union in the late 1980s led to considerably less interest in the ASRAAM effort. As well, German reunification gave the German Air Force their {{first look at the}} Russian Vympel R-73 missile, known in the west as the AA-11 Archer. This proved to be a far more dangerous short-range attack weapon than had been known previously. It was clearly able to outperform all operational Western short-range IR tracking missiles, particularly in the ability to guide in high off-axis attacks, but also in terms of field of view, <b>acquisition</b> <b>range,</b> maneuverability, ease of target designation, and target lock-on.|$|E

50|$|The main improvement, {{which was}} also made on {{the latest version of}} the AIM-9 Sidewinder, is a new 128×128 {{resolution}} imaging infrared focal plane array (FPA) seeker manufactured by Hughes before they were acquired by Raytheon. This seeker has a long <b>acquisition</b> <b>range,</b> high countermeasures resistance, approximately 90 degrees off-boresight lock-on capability, and the possibility to designate specific parts of the targeted aircraft (like cockpit, engines, etc.). The ASRAAM also has a LOAL (Lock-On After Launch) ability which is a distinct advantage when the missile is carried in an internal bay such as in the F-35 Lightning II. The ASRAAM warhead is triggered either by laser proximity fuse or impact. A laser proximity fuse was selected because RF fuses are vulnerable to EW intervention from enemy jammers.|$|E
50|$|The 1S51M3-2 {{radar system}} on the SA-8 TELAR {{received}} the NATO codename Land Roll. It {{was derived from the}} naval `Pop Group' radar system but is smaller since it does not require the elaborate stabilisation system. An improved system designated the SA-8B `Gecko' Mod 1, was first seen in Germany in 1980. It had improvements added to the launcher configuration, carrying six missiles in ribbed containers. The system is reported to be of the frequency-agile monopulse type. It consists of an elliptical rotating surveillance antenna mounted on top of the array, operates in H band (6 to 8 GHz) and has a 30 km <b>acquisition</b> <b>range</b> against most targets. The large pulsed J band (14.5 GHz) engagement antenna is mounted below it in the centre of the array and has a maximum tracking range of about 20 km.|$|E
5000|$|The {{missile seeker}} can be slaved to the Helmet Mounted Display (HMD), {{allowing}} the pilot to track a target beyond the aircraft's radar scan envelope using the missile's high off-boresight capability, {{achieved by the}} pilot turning his head towards the target to lock-on, better known as [...] "look and shoot". The missile can then be launched and can immediately pull extreme g-force to reverse its course to engage a target behind the aircraft, sometimes called an [...] "over-the-shoulder". Engage modes include Lock-On After Launch (LOAL) capability to engage targets outside its seeker's <b>acquisition</b> <b>range,</b> and Lock-On Before Launch (LOBL) capability where the target is identified and designated before launch. The two colour thermal imaging technology and a laser proximity fuse fitted on the missile provide multiple Electronic counter-countermeasures (ECCM) techniques with targeting algorithms including advanced spatial filtering techniques and velocity profiling.|$|E
500|$|Founded in 1997 by since-then retired teacher Sigurður Hjartarson and now run {{by his son}} Hjörtur Gísli Sigurðsson, {{the museum}} grew out of an {{interest}} in penises that began during Sigurður's childhood when {{he was given a}} cattle whip made from a bull's penis.
