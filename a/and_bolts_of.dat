They tied feather beds <b>and</b> <b>bolts</b> <b>of</b> cloth to their horses, and dragged them. They herded {{large numbers of}} cattle into pens and slaughtered them. One outraged citizen, Judge John Hays, grabbed a gun and waded ashore through the shallow water, and roared at the bemused warriors, but the Indians chose to spare him, believing him mad. He later found that he had waded ashore to face nearly a thousand Indians with an unloaded pistol.|$|E
500|$|The season {{opened up}} to {{critical}} acclaim with many critics calling it [...] "one of the best shows on TV" [...] and {{was included in the}} top ten for numerous 2006 [...] "best of television" [...] lists. Also the fame of the show skyrocketed during the season The A.V. Club called the show a [...] "pokemon" [...] and [...] "one of the best TV shows around, burning through plot points at a furious clip, swooning romanticism, at embracing the kind of deeply earnest, intensely felt romance that made the show’s relationships so great. Meredith’s famous [...] "Pick me, choose me, love me" [...] speech is corny, to be sure, but it’s got tremendous rhythm and absolute conviction...season two of Grey’s was a comet." [...] Todd Gilchrist of IGN Entertainment expressed hope in the further development of the series, noting the complex backgrounds of each character as being the series' focal point. He noted that the ensemble, composed of [...] "countless comely females and enough strong, competitive males" [...] remains outstanding in prime time, being iconic, due to the vast interpretations regarding the main cast. Whereas Gilchrist acknowledged that the show gives the impression of it being only for women, he stated that he can attest to its universal, equal-opportunity appeal, assessing that the show [...] "explores the medical world with both a sense of testosterone-fueled intensity and estrogen-laced sensitivity" [...] and deserved to have viewers from both genders, championing its merits. In response to the bomb story arc, he called the two episodes [...] "juicy", while assessing that they [...] "followed a story line that not only explained the series up to that point, but featured all of the characters in their more or less purest from". Gilchrist provided an outlook on each character, describing Grey as a [...] "prodigiously talented but insecure surgeon, waylaid by her love for attending Derek Shepherd", while stating that Yang, [...] "an aggressively ambitious intern" [...] lacks knowledge on any topic, except medicine, comparing her to boyfriend Burke, described as her opposite. In response to George O'Malley's story line, he noted how his sensitive personality constantly results in difficulty in his path to becoming a proper surgeon. He also expressed excitement in the doors opened by the previous season's cliffhanger, seeing the arrival of Montgomery (Walsh) as [...] "certainly speaking to the show's focus on relationships over the nuts <b>and</b> <b>bolts</b> <b>of</b> being a surgeon", while praising Rhimes for continuing to [...] "merge those disparate elements in the way that does, or at least should be a source of enthusiasm for both men and women, creating an atmosphere both professional and intimately personal, often at the same time".|$|E

[...] While Michael Milken (a holdover {{from the old}} Drexel) got most of the credit by almost single-handedly creating a junk bond market, another key architect in this strategy was Fred Joseph. [...] Shortly after buying the old Drexel, Burnham found out that Joseph, {{chief operating officer of}} Shearson Hamill, wanted {{to get back into the}} nuts <b>and</b> <b>bolts</b> <b>of</b> investment banking and hired him as co-head of corporate finance. [...] Joseph, the son of a Boston taxicab driver, was a good fit for the firm's culture. [...] He promised Burnham that in 10 years, he would make Drexel Burnham as powerful as Goldman Sachs.|$|E
2500|$|The {{manager was}} Major Rupert Howard of Lancashire {{who had also}} managed the last tour, Gubby Allen's [...] "Goodwill Tour" [...] of 1936–37. He knew Hammond well and they took to touring {{the country in a}} Jaguar lent to them when they arrived in Australia. Unlike later tours Howard was in charge of both the social {{calendar}} and public relations as well as the finances, though they tended to leave the nut <b>and</b> <b>bolts</b> <b>of</b> moving the team around to the baggage-master and scorer Bill Ferguson. The 66-year-old scorer had toured with the MCC since 1907–08 and devised the famous Ferguson Charts which gave greater detail than other scorecards, noting each ball bowled by from which bowler to which batsman. He also invented the radial scoring chart which shows the directions in which a batsman scored his runs.|$|E
2500|$|AllMusic {{reviewer}} William Ruhlmann {{opened his}} review by mentioning how the group released several {{songs in the}} preceding 18 months. Calling this decision [...] "indicative of Man Overboard's youthful drive; this is a band that is in a hurry". This [...] "rush" [...] was [...] "expressed in the breakneck tempos of the short (none over {{three and a half}} minutes) songs" [...] on the group's self-titled album. Ruhlmann classified the album's sound as being [...] "standard-issue" [...] pop punk in the vein of Green Day and Blink-182, with [...] "an echo" [...] of Jimmy Eat World, in terms of the Bruzzese and Eisensteins' [...] "contrasting vocals". Writing for Rock Sound, Andy Ritchie noted that the album [...] "reveals little reinvention, but the nuts <b>and</b> <b>bolts</b> <b>of</b> what makes them so affable have only been tightened and polished further". He considered the band had [...] "a formula that just works," [...] concluding [...] "there really isn’t a dud track here".|$|E

2500|$|As Raimi and his {{producing}} partner Robert Tapert progressed {{through various}} drafts, {{they realized that}} there was a potential franchise on their hands. Universal brought in screenwriting brothers Daniel and Joshua Goldin to work on the script. According to Daniel, they were presented with various drafts and [...] "lots of little story documents. There was just material everywhere; drafts seemed to go in many directions." [...] Goldin said that they [...] "spent {{a lot of time talking}} and pulling together a way of making the story work. I think that mostly we talked in terms of the nuts <b>and</b> <b>bolts</b> <b>of</b> the story." [...] The Goldins added new lines of dialogue, new characters and bits of action. The studio still wasn't satisfied so the Raimi brothers wrote drafts six through twelve before they had a shooting script. For Raimi, he wanted to emphasize Peyton/Darkman's arc over the course of the film. He said, [...] "I decided to explore a man's soul. In the beginning, a sympathetic, sincere man. In the middle, a vengeful man committing heinous acts against his enemies. And in the end, a man full of self-hatred for what he's become, who must drift off into the night, into a world apart from everyone he knows and all the things he loves." ...|$|E

The party of artificers and seamen which landed on the rock counted altogether forty in number.
