5|$|The Tour organisers did {{not make}} many changes the rules or route for the next race, because they {{had worked in the}} 1906 Tour de France. The revised points system would be kept in this form until 1911, only to be changed <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>in</b> 1912 before being {{replaced}} by the time system in 1913. The flamme rouge that was introduced in 1906 to indicate the final kilometre of a stage was kept and is still in use.|$|E

25|$|Some {{applications}} like AC/AC converters with DC-link for frequency {{controls in}} three-phase grids need the higher voltages aluminum electrolytic capacitors usually offer. For such applications electrolytic capacitors can be connected in series for increased voltage-withstanding capability. During charging, the voltage across {{each of the}} capacitors connected in series {{is proportional to the}} inverse of the individual capacitor’s leakage current. Since every capacitor differs <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>in</b> individual leakage current, the capacitors with a higher leakage current will get less voltage. The voltage balance over the series-connected capacitors is not symmetrical. Passive or active voltage balance has to be provided in order to stabilize the voltage over each individual capacitor.|$|E

25|$|The 1987–88 NBA season saw the Mavericks dip just <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>in</b> {{the regular}} season—finishing 53–29 and losing their Midwest Division {{title to the}} Denver Nuggets—but it was another {{successful}} year for the team. Mark Aguirre and James Donaldson both played in the 1988 NBA All-Star Game, the Mavericks rattled off a franchise-best 11-game winning streak, and Rolando Blackman scored his 10,000th career point. Aguirre led the team in scoring for the sixth consecutive year with 25.1 points per game, and Roy Tarpley won the NBA Sixth Man Award with averages of 13.5 points and 11.8 rebounds. The season saw the Mavs' deepest playoff run to date. They dispatched the Houston Rockets in four games and the Nuggets in six, leaving only the defending NBA Champion Lakers between them and their first-ever trip to the NBA Finals. The Mavericks gave the Lakers everything they could handle, {{but in the end}} the more experienced Lakers prevailed, defeating Dallas in seven games on the way to eventually winning their second consecutive NBA Championship.|$|E

I think there was stuff that could have been resolved, and there was drama that was probably unnecessary, typical rock band stuff. I certainly played a role in it.

500|$|After {{finishing}} work on Deadly Shadows, Jordan Thomas went to Irrational Games, where he designed the [...] "Fort Frolic" [...] section of BioShock. He {{later became the}} creative director of BioShock 2. Because of tensions and disagreements within the Deadly Shadows team, Randy Smith was fired from Ion Storm {{near the end of}} the game's production, and he founded Tiger Style with fellow Deadly Shadows designer David Kalina. Smith later wondered if the team had [...] "overdone it" [...] with [...] "Robbing the Cradle", and he stated, [...] "I worry <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>in</b> retrospect about people who just wanted a 'sneaking around mansions and stealing stuff' experience [...] forced into their deepest nightmares."

500|$|It is to {{be noted}} that the riders started in reverse order of the general classification, so Pinot was the last one to start. The riders went off the {{starting}} ramp in two minutes increments. Cancellara got on course early, as he was the seventh man to start. He clocked a time of 48' 55", which would stay a reference for most of the day. He was followed out of the starting area by Matthias Brändle (IAM Cycling) who came in 2' 28" [...] after Cancellara, somewhat surprisingly as he is a time trial specialist too. Malori set the best time at the [...] intermediate point but faded <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>in</b> the end, coming to the finish line only 15 seconds off Cancellara's time. The Swiss would stay as a reference for a while now that some time trial specialists had finished their effort and failed to beat him. Damien Gaudin (Ag2r-La Mondiale) clocked in a time of 50' 46" [...] which put him in sixth position.|$|E

It's an incredibly long process." [...] Regular Arcade Fire collaborators Owen Pallett and Colin Stetson provided instrumental parts, alongside English musician David Bowie who provided vocals for the song. Regarding Bowie's guest appearance on the track, multi-instrumentalist Richard Reed Parry noted, [...] "It was just after The Next Day had come out. He basically just came by the studio in New York while we were mixing, {{just to have a}} listen to the stuff we were doing. He offered to lend us his services because he really liked the song. In fact, he basically threatened us – he was like, 'If you don't hurry up and mix this song, I might just steal it from you!' So we thought, well why don't we go one better, why don't you sing on our version? Thankfully he obliged, and we were really happy about that." ...|$|E

500|$|Armstrong told Bloody Disgusting {{reviewer}} Mike Pereira that {{he thinks}} [...] "visually" [...] Saw VI might be his favorite, saying [...] "We're kind of pulling back <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>in</b> the color palette. It's {{going to be more}} suggestive and not so vibrant, in your face like III and IV. It's more neutral and shows natural flesh tones. On Saw V, I pulled back a little bit and on this one, I pulled back even more." [...] He commented that the [...] "steam room" [...] trap was the [...] "best looking" [...] of them all. [...] He went on to say, [...] "It's big and expensive. It's got furnaces, fires and steam. It's multi-leveled. The most complex Saw. We had techno cranes flying through. It was pretty amazing." [...] Commenting on the [...] "carousel room" [...] trap Armstrong said: [...] "It's very carnival, playground-like. It's just nasty. [...] spinning red lights in there. It's really overwhelming to walk in and look at because everything is spinning." [...] Greutert said in an issue of the horror magazine Fangoria that the [...] "carousel room" [...] was, to date, the [...] "longest trap scene ever". He admitted that originally they had ten actors riding the carousel, but it was ultimately scaled down to six, to [...] "tie in to the [...] title".

I guess I pointed <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>in</b> front, but, you know, what can we say?" [...] Schumacher said [...] "The end of the race was not planned...

2500|$|Jeff Cork from Game Informer {{scored the}} game an 8/10, saying: [...] "Creation and {{discovery}} are at Tearaways foundation, and I was still pleasantly {{surprised at the}} steady drip of new abilities, gameplay elements, and other novelties delivered throughout. Not everything lands, but the parts that do are outstanding. One thing did seem {{to get lost in}} the move to PS4, though: Tearaway on Vita was an intimate experience. Holding the device close to my face, it felt as though I was privy to a secret directly from Media Molecule. I’m glad to see the adventure on the big screen, but the console experience feels less personal, and the journey loses <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>in</b> the transition. That said, Tearaway Unfolded is still a great game for families or anyone else who’s looking for an uplifting change of pace." ...|$|E

Wijemuni was imprisoned for two-and-a-half years for the assault Gandhi later said about the incident: When I was inspecting the guard of honour and as I walked past one person, I saw through {{the corner of my}} eye some movement.

5000|$|Bica is a Portuguese espresso, {{longer than}} its Italian counterpart, but <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> softer <b>in</b> taste.
