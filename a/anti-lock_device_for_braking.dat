50|$|Presence Sensing Devices (PSD) {{are one of}} {{the more}} common safety <b>devices</b> <b>for</b> press <b>brake</b> safety. It is {{difficult}} to protect the operator using a metal bending machine such as a press brake. Often the operator must hold the sheet metal work-piece in one place while another portion of the piece is being formed in the die. If a foreign object is detected, the laser, camera, or light curtain technology will immediately retract the die or stop the motion of the ram. PSDs protect the operator and other employees in the area.|$|R

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to develop the assistive <b>device</b> <b>for</b> {{accelerator}} and <b>brake</b> pedals using bio-signals from the prefrontal lobe in the driving simulator and evaluate its performance. Background: There is lack of assistive <b>devices</b> <b>for</b> the driving in peoples with disabilities in Korea. However, if bio-signals and/or brain waves are used at driving a car, the people with serious physical limitations can improve their community mobility. Method: 15 subjects with driver's license participated in this study for experiment of driving performance evaluation in the simulator. Each subject drove the simulator the same course 10 times in three separated groups which use different interface controllers to accelerate and brake: (1) conventional pedal group, (2) joystick group and (3) bio-signal group(horizontal quick glance of the eyes and clench teeth). All experiments were recorded and the driving performances were evaluated by three inspectors. Results: Average score of bio-signal group for the driving in the simulator was increased 3 % compared with the pedal group and was increased 9 % compared with the joystick group(p< 0. 01). The subjects using bio-signals was decreased 44 % in number of deduction compared with others because the device had the built-in modified cruise control. Conclusion: The assistive <b>device</b> <b>for</b> accelerator and <b>brake</b> pedals using bio-signals showed significantly better performance than using general pedal and a joystic...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn this research, a novel safety escape device {{based on}} magnetorheological fluid and {{permanent}} magnet is designed, manufactured, and tested. The safety escape device with magnetorheological fluid and permanent magnet {{can provide an}} increasing <b>braking</b> torque <b>for</b> a falling object by increasing the magnetic field intensity at the magnetorheological fluid. Such increase is realized by mechanically altering the magnetic circuit of the device when the object is falling.

Finite element analysis is used to determine some of the specifications of the safety escape <b>device</b> <b>for</b> larger <b>braking</b> torque and smaller size. Finite element analysis results are also used for theoretical study and establishment of the dynamic model of the safety escape device. A prototype is realized and tested finally.

40|$|Abstract. The {{research}} is presented {{a kind of}} cooling <b>device</b> <b>for</b> a vehicle’s <b>brake</b> cooling system, which comprises a thermoelectric cooling (TEC) chip and a heat exchange system. The disc-brake and drum-brake systems {{are discussed in the}} research. After inputting electric power, the TEC chip provides one cooling surface which is stick on the brake system and absorbs the heat from the brake pads or shoes. The other surface releases heat which is absorbed by a recycle water-cooling system to discharge the heat by water-cooled radiator to the surrounding. It decreased the working temperature of the brake system about 30 % at most after using this cooling device and increased the braking force about 30 % at least. There is a temperature control <b>device</b> <b>for</b> the <b>device</b> which can start the TEC chip when the temperature of the brake pads or shoes exceeded 50 ℃, which is the lowest temperature that the brake pads or shoes can maintain the most performance of the braking force. The device can efficiently keep the braking force when the driver uses the brake to reduce the vehicle’s speed {{for a long time and}} provide the safety for the driver.
