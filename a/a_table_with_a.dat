5|$|The first {{match to}} {{take place on the}} event's card was the Six Man Tag Team Tables match pitting the team of Johnny Devine and Team 3D against the team of Jay Lethal and MCMG. The match lasted {{fourteen}} minutes and fifty-nine seconds. The objective of a Six Man Tag Team Tables match is to drive {{one of the members of}} the opposing team through a table. During the contest, Lethal drove Devine through <b>a</b> <b>table</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> driving elbow drop. However, as the referee was scripted to appear unconscious, this allowed Team 3D to knockout MCMG and Lethal with the X Division Championship belt. They followed by draping Devine over Lethal, making it appear as though Devine had drove Lethal through the table, thus winning the match for his team.|$|E

25|$|The {{selection}} of the OR table depends on the primary use of the system. Interventional tables with floating table tops and tilt and cradle compete with fully integrated flexible OR tables. Identification of the right table is a compromise between interventional and surgical requirements. Surgical and interventional requirements may be mutually exclusive. Surgeons, especially orthopedic, general and neurosurgeons usually expect <b>a</b> <b>table</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> segmented tabletop for flexible patient positioning. For imaging purposes, a radiolucent tabletop, allowing full body coverage, is required. Therefore, non-breakable carbon fibre tabletops are used.|$|E

25|$|Tea Time is an oil {{painting}} on cardboard with dimensions 75.9 x 70.2cm (29.9 x 27.6 in), signed Metzinger and dated 1911 lower right. The painting represents a barely draped (nude) woman holding a spoon, seated at <b>a</b> <b>table</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> cup of tea. In the 'background', {{the upper left}} quadrant, stands a vase on a commode, table or shelf. A square or cubic shape, a chair or painting behind the model, espouses {{the shape of the}} stretcher. The painting is practically square, like the side of a cube. The woman's head is highly stylized, divided into geometrized facets, planes and curves (the forehead, nose, cheeks, hair). The source of light appears to be off to her right, with some reflected light {{on the left side of}} her face. Reflected light, consistently, can be seen on other parts of her body (breast, shoulder, arm). Her breast is composed of a triangle and a sphere. The faceting of the rest of her body, to some extent, coincides with actual muscular and skeletal features (collar bone, ribcage, pectorals, deltoids, neck tissue). Both of here shoulders are coupled with elements of the background, superimposed, gradational and transparent to varying degrees. Unidentified elements are composed of alternating angular structures, The colors employed by Metzinger are subdued, mixed (either on a palette of directly on the surface), with an overall natural allure. The brushwork is reminiscent of Metzinger's Divisionist period (ca. 1903–1907), described by the critic (Louis Vauxcelles) in 1907 as large, mosaic-like 'cubes', used to construct small but highly symbolic compositions.|$|E
25|$|In the Paley and Austin wing, the {{entrance}} porch leads {{into a long}} hall, which opens into the library, the billiards room, the drawing room and the dining room; all of these rooms have elaborately decorated plaster ceilings. In the library are about 3,500books, some of which survived the 1871 fire, {{and some of the}} former possessions of the scientist Henry Cavendish (1731–1810), including his microscope. On the walls of the billiards room are four painted panels that are attributed to Jean-Baptiste Oudry, a caricature by Joshua Reynolds, and paintings by Jan Wyck and Matthias Reed. The walls of the drawing room are lined in silk, and the room contains a Carrara marble fireplace. Paintings in the room are by Claude Joseph Vernet (its companion-piece was destroyed in the fire), Salvatore Rosa, and Douglas Anderson. The furniture in the dining room includes chairs by Thomas Chippendale. On the walls are portraits of family members, and a self-portrait by Anthony van Dyck. At the far end of {{the entrance}} hall is a cantilevered oak staircase which is approached through limestone arches. It contains over 100balusters, each of which is carved with a different design. Its windows contain heraldic stained glass. The upper floor contains a gallery and four bedrooms. In the gallery are items of furniture, and these include <b>a</b> <b>table</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> purse once belonging to Georgiana Cavendish. Queen Mary's Bedroom gained its name when it was used by Queen Mary when she stayed in the house in 1937. The Wedgwood Bedroom contains a Carrera marble fireplace incorporating blue and white Wedgwood Jasperware. The four-poster bed is by Hepplewhite. The Gloucester Bedroom and Dreesing Room gained their names when they were used by the Duke of Gloucester and his wife when they visited in 1939. The walls are decorated with engravings of Brighton Pavilion by John Nash. The Duke's Bedroom was used by the 7thDuke during the later years of his life.|$|E

500|$|The episode's {{exterior}} {{scenes were}} shot in Vancouver, Canada's Chinatown while the crematorium scenes were shot on a soundstage. Interior {{shots of the}} gambling parlor were shot at the Welsh Irish Scottish English (W.I.S.E.) Hall, a community building in Vancouver. The production staff created a second balcony in the hall exclusively for the episode, with an agreement to tear it down once the episode was filmed. However, after the filming ended, the W.I.S.E. Hall's owners requested that the balcony be left in place [...] "for aesthetic reasons". The vase and tiles used in the episode were created entirely by the show's production department. The scene where a frog pops out of a victim's chest was created by using molds to create a fake human torso, which was then placed over the actor. For a close-up shot, the torso was placed on <b>a</b> <b>table</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hole on it, allowing the show's animal wrangler to push a live frog through the opening in the torso.

The band was recorded in Boston, and Hank Azaria, the voice of Moe, flew over to record his part with them and help them with their lines. In the original script, Moe tempted the band to play by offering them free beer, but the band members asked that the joke be changed. The writers changed the line to [...] "free pickled eggs."
