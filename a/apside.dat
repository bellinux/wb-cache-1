The images of those saints, which had been created in mosaic by the Pope's wish, can be found today in the <b>apside</b> of the chapel. Search for relics for Rome was probably the incentive for Salona residents who inhabited the new city of Split, located only a few kilometers from the abandoned Salona. At the very least, they wanted to bring to Split the bones of their most important protectors: St. Domnius and St. Anastasius. They placed them in what was once Diocletian's mausoleum, which was subsequently converted into a cathedral.|$|E

The city {{underwent}} several sudden changes in status {{in the second half of}} the 6th decade of the 9th century: Florence went from città della marca (a provincial center) to città dell'impero ("imperial city") and then back again to città della marca (Volume 1, Davidsohn p. 231).It seems that in view of the council of 1055, several activities werde carried out: - widening of the crypt- adding of two <b>apside</b> at the sides of the major apsis- construction of an arcade, of which the foundations were found, the foundations of eight pilasters or columns, at about 13 metres outside the facade of Santa Maria del Fiore. In any case, since it is documented that Pope Nicholas II, who was present in his Florentine diocese from November 1059, consecrated the churches that were reconstructed to Santa Felicita and from San Lorenzo, we have no document relating to the consecration of Santa Reparata by the pope or bishop. As far as the baptistery is concerned however, there is an inscription on a panel from the 17th or 18th century, on which it is reported to be consecrated to San Giovanni on 6 November 1055. But if the additions were made before the council, it seems likely that Nicholas II had consecrated Santa Reparata when he was still bishop. The apses are from the romanesque age because the way they are constructed in respect with the foundations of the two towers, especially the southern one, makes it likely that these were brought down at this occasion. The crypt also was enlarged in the romanesque age; the ceiling was carried by columns and its dimensions were widened until the entry of the two chapels on the side, where two stairways lead up to the presbytery.|$|E

Modest remains of a church were found (part of the south <b>apside</b> wall), 76 new graves and 4 graves which were partially researched in 2012, as well as part of a deep ditch which could have been the edge of the cemetery. This season, most of the graves found date back to the earlier stage of the parochial cemetery.

Although there are few remains of the actual church, they still provide some information. The layout of the church was fully investigated during this season, and the size can be estimated to 14. 5 x 8. 3 m.

The archaeological excavations of {{the medieval}} church with a cemetery in Crkvari, near Orahovica have been resumed. The area along the southern (probe S 1) and the southeastern wall (probe S 2) of the apse of the present church building, late-Gothic church with baroque elements, with additional eastern trench across the edge and {{the slope of the}} central elevation (probe S 2 a) (Fig. 1) has been researched. The remains of wooden palisades {{at the edge of the}} central elevation and the wall that used to surround the late medieval and the modern cemetery were discovered (Fig. 3). Particularly significant is the discovery of a substrate of the foundations of a semi-circular apse which is, so far, the oldest found Romanesque church on this location, around which the burials have been found featuring silver ring with an S loop (Fig. 2). During the research, 111 graves were excavated - from the period of the early Middle Ages to the Modern Ages - which makes a total of 479 explored graves on this particular site. In the Modern Age layer of the burials, the burial of a deceased woman from G 376 stands out. She was buried face down in the grave next to the apse, with her head facing the east and her legs facing the west. In the neck region of the deceased, a massive iron (belt) buckle was found and the iron knife by her right shoulder (Fig. 4 – 5). In the oldest horizon of graves a few silver rings with closed ends were found, as well as one ring with an S loop. Discovery of the substrate of the foundations, probably of the Romanesque apse, and the position of graves around it, tells us about the burial horizon, when the old tradition of burials in cemeteris formed in rows, changed to the tradition of burials alongside the church. Some of the oldest graves probably belong to the horizon of the cemetery with burial in rows but before detailed analysis of the site we cannot engage in their discernment...|$|E

Mihovil (St Michael) were found, and b. on the southern slope of Salamandrija, where most of the small finds from prehistoric, Greek, and Roman times were excavated. At the site of the “Late Roman fortification” in square D- 10 a wall was excavated, {{which is part of the}} wall from square C- 10 excavated in 1996. The new ground plan shows an apsidal part of the “fortification” whose diameter is about 3 m. Among the few finds in this square a valuable find is a fragment of Renaissance painted ceramics dated to the 16 th/ 17 th c., which is the first material proof from Palagruža from the Middle Ages. At the same site another three squares were opened: C- 13, C- 14, and D- 13, to the east of the “fortification” wall and in the western part of the church of Sv. Mihovil. Excavations in square C- 13 and 14 followed the excavations of the previous years, D- 13 was partly excavated and remains of a pit were found. Further excavation in the area are planned for the year 2005. In the area of the southern slope of Salamandrija square A and B- 8 were excavated. A total of 6800 fragments of pottery were found belonging to the prehistoric (pottery and flint artefacts of Cetina culture), Greek and Roman period (mostly fine wares). Next to these ceramics fragments other finds - coins, gems, dice for games, bronze arrowheads, fibulae and parts of small stone altars were excavated as well.

The purpose of excavations around the apse of today’s chapel is not only to unearth the foundations of the Gothic apse and buttresses and ascertain other scholarly facts, but also {{to lay the groundwork for}} future drainage projects. In this area, 32 graves were found, dating from the Middle Ages to New Era, so that the overall number of excavated graves at the site is 233. The excavations in the east, around the apse, with complex layers and rich finds, yielded a great deal of information that helps interpret the sequence of the burial horizons at the site, as well as the sequence of individual construction phases. The finds of coins minted by Nikola of Ilok in the archaeological complexes facilitate the chronological analysis of the layers, at the same time suggesting the great significance of the site in the Middle Ages. However, the most important discoveries in 2008 were made upon excavation of a large surface in front of the western façade of today’s church. The disposition of the newly uncovered architecture and the stylistic characteristics of the complex imply the potential discovery of a large church with a nave and two aisles, and a powerful bell-tower. It seems that it was also built over several construction phases, but it was all within the period which in the Croatia’s territory was characterized by the Gothic style, as indicated by the buttresses on the building, as well as individual finds of moulded stone sculpture, and moulded window frames made of brick.

Samo u jednoj crkvi, onoj sv. Franje u Puli, vidljivo je izravno preuzimanje tlocrtnog tipa iz izvorišta franjevačkog reda, iz srednje Italije, poglavito Umbrije i Toskane. Crkva trodijelnog svetišta uobičajen je tip u franjevačkom sakralnom graditeljstvu srednjovjekovne Europe i najčešći je među franjevačkim crkvama zemlje matice reda, Italije. Na hrvatskoj obali Jadranskog mora taj tip zastupljen je franjevačkom crkvom sv. Franje u Puli, jedinstvenom po oblikovanju svetišta i arhitektonsko-plastičnom ukrasu. U ovom članku arhitektonski i tipološki analizirat će se ta crkva, njezina zastupljenost u određenom broju znanstvenih i stručnih radova hrvatskih i inozemnih autora, kao i talijanska ishodišta njezinog tlocrtnog tipa. Temeljem otprije uspostavljenog, jednog od rijetkih prijedloga tipologije propovjedničkih crkava u Umbriji i Toskani, pokušat će se sustavnije definirati njen tlocrtni i arhitektonski tip. The main type of Franciscan churches {{built on}} the Croatian coast {{up to the end}} of the 16 th century is {{represented}} by a church having a single nave showing roof trusses, and three vaulted quadrangular apsides. This type was formed by the acceptance of the ground plan type that the Franciscans brought from central Italy, and by using traditional solutions that were already widely used, such as, for example, a symmetrically vaulted quadrangular apse. The church of St. Francis at Pula is the only church that features a ground plan that was taken over directly from the origins of the Franciscan order, i. e., from central Italy, in particular Umbria and Tuscany. A type of church featuring a tripartite sanctuary is common in Franciscan sacral architecture of medieval Europe. At the same time it represents the most widely used type among Franciscan churches of the country from where the Order emanates, Italy. On the Croatian coast of the Adriatic Sea this type is represented by the Franciscan church of St. Francis at Pula, which is truly unique by the design of the sanctuary, and its architectural decoration. This article gives an architectural and typological analysis of the church of St. Francis at Pula, its representation in a certain number of scientific and professional papers of Croatian and foreign authors, and the Italian origins of its ground plan type. On the basis of one of the rare typological proposals for preaching churches in Umbria and Tuscany presented to date, we will attempt to define in a systematically more precise manner the ground plan and architectural type of the Franciscan church at Pula...|$|E

U kojoj mjeri nam ikonografski program Eufrazijane i drugih svetišta iz doba Justinijana pomaže da shvatimo ulogu cara kao neprijepornog arbitra na području ne samo politike već i kršćanske doktrine, pokušat ćemo objasniti u ovom prilogu. The article deals, once again, {{with the}} famous Early Christian complex in Poreč (named Euphrasiana after the bishop Euphrasius who, in the 6 th century, has given the complex its present, vell {{preserved}} aspect). Euphrasius’ claim to fame, of course, are surely the exquisite mosaics that adorn the main apsis of the basilica (as well as fragments in the apses of the two side aisles). It represents Mary as Theotokos, holding Jesus in her lap, surrounded by angels, local martyrs (Maurus), bishop Euphrasius himself, the deacon and his son. The article traces back {{the development of this}} iconographical scheme in the central apse of the sanctuary, characteristic for the 6 th century and the reign of Justinian, but traceable {{all the way to the}} second half of the 5 th century when we encounter this type of representation in two recorded stories about Mary’s girdle, found in Palestine and brought to Constantinople where Leo I had a sanctuary built to house the precious relic. This iconography can be explained, and often was, by the gradual growth of support for the veneration of Mary, the Mother of God (Theotokos). The official Church played a major part in this respect (in particular as the result of oecumenical councils held in Chalcedon, Ephesus and Constantinople), following and respecting an existing, growing popular affection (one has to note that not all the Church Fathers were all too happy with this; i. e. John Chrysostom and Ambrose of Milan). One last influence has to be reviewed: the imperial contribution in developing and promoting the image of Theotokos as a token of orthodoxy and the holy patron of the state. By 626 it is Mary who is protecting Constantinople and it is her image which is displayed against the invading barbarians. Justinian is rather clear in stating that all of the doctrinal controversies of the period result from the efforts (his efforts !) to prove that Mary is the Mother of God (Theotokos). The iconography in Poreč reflects the endeavours of this emperor just like his other major »investments« do (Gaza, Saint Catherin’s monastery in Sinai, Ravenna). There are many details alongside the main idea that bear proof to the Christian oikoumence of the period which is under absolute control by Justinian. As such, Poreč is not only a message against heretic Arians or Monophysites, but also against the Roman Church, unwilling to accept emperor’s control over matters of Christian doctrine. Pope Vigilius is dragged away to die in Constantinople while Wuphrasius, just about the same time, celebrates the triumph of orthodoxy as promoted by the emperor, as does his contemporary Maximianus in Ravenna. Justinian is only appropriately remembered as »Herr über Kirche und Dogma«...|$|E

Obavljena su zaštitna istraživanja s vanjske strane temelja ranogotičke crkve koju su podignuli templari a istražena su i dva rova istočno i zapadno od crkve i prostor sakristije. Osim nekih zanimljivih arhitektonskih elemenata iz različitih razdoblja – od romaničke <b>apside</b> do novovjekih dogradnji, istražena su i 424 groba. Okvirno se mogu datirati u novovjekovno razdoblje, tj. u vrijeme nakon izgradnje te neposredno prije izgradnje sakristije (mlađa faza), zatim u vrijeme trajanja gotičke faze crkve (srednja faza) te, konačno, u vrijeme prije izgradnje gotičke crkve, odnosno za vrijeme ukopavanja oko romaničke crkve (najstarija faza ukopavanja). Veliku su pažnju na sebe privukli pronađeni pokretni nalazi iz svih faza ukopavanja, no najzanimljiviji su oni koje su iza sebe ostavili viteški redovi – templari i ivanovci. During {{the period}} from 2008 until 2011 the Institute of Archaeology, {{for the sake of}} {{complete}} restoration, undertook the archaeological research of the church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Gora near Petrinja. The rescue excavations were carried out on the front side of the foundations of the early Gothic church that was erected by the Templars. Two trenches on the eastern and on the western side of the church were investigated as well as the area of the sacristy. Besides the interesting architectural elements from different times - from the Romanesque apse to the Modern Age extensions, 424 graves which can be roughly dated to the Modern Ages (younger stage), the Gothic phase of the church (middle stage) and, finally, to the time before the construction of a Gothic church, that is, to the time of burying around a Romanesque church (the oldest phase of burials), were investigated. The finds from all phases of burials deserve special attention, but the most interesting are those left behind by the military orders - the Templars and Hospitallers. To the period of Hospitallers we can attribute, for example, two exemplars of silver denar of Hungaro-Croatian king Louis I, silver signet ring with a motif of lily, and two oval single-piece cast buckles with one pin found on the hips of one decedent. The Templars also left behind few exemplars of money, for example picolo, i. e. “Scyphate” denar of some Venetian Doge (Enrico Dandolo?) and silver Slavonian banovac probably of King Ladislaus IV Kumanac. There are also different pewter rings and a bronze buckle with “a series of beads” (German Perlstab) on the outer bar. Two findings particularly stand out - carved bone buckle in the form of two lions facing each other, with their paws joined, and an oval brooch with engraved inscription written in the beneventan script : AVeMAInLNROAICS. This inscription can be subdivided into two parts, with the AVE MA being an abbreviation of Ave Maria, and the InLNROAICS an invocation for: In Laude Nostri Register Omnipotent Altissimi Salvatori Jesui Christi (“In Praise of our King All-powerful Almighty Jesus Christ the Saviour”) ...|$|E

Tijekom vremena doživjela je brojna oštećenja i nekoliko pregradnji, a današnji izgled rezultat je provedenih istraživanja i konzervatorskih radova započetih 1997. godine. Snažna prisutnost gotičke tradicije u arhitektonskom oblikovanju mogla bi nas uputiti na gradnju crkve u ranom razdoblju vlasti Dubrovačke Republike na području Konavala, no arhivski podaci i stručna {{literatura}} ukazuju na 17. stoljeće kao vrijeme njezine izgradnje te na zavjetni karakter crkve, podignute da bi očuvala usjeve, za Dubrovačku Republiku, izuzetno vrijedne konavoske doline. Ostatak zidnog oslika unutar svetišta, u prostoru <b>apside</b> i na dijelu iznad trijumfalnog luka rijedak je primjer sačuvanog zidnog slikarstva u sakralnom graditeljstvu Konavala. Konzervatorsko-restauratorski radovi na zidnom osliku izvedeni su 2014. godine, na dva različita povijesna sloja, koja potječu vjerojatno iz 17., odnosno 19. stoljeća i zanimljivi su primjeri dekorativnog slikarstva svojega vremena. Oba sloja usporedno su prezentirana. The {{church of}} the Visitation of the Blessed Virgin Mary {{is located in the}} village of Popovići, a secluded place near the southern shaded edge of the Konavle Plain, at the site of Lug. It is a votive chapel of all the Konavle villages. Over the course of time, it has experienced numerous injuries and several reconstructions, with its present appearance resulting from the investigative and conservation work that was started in 1997, when the church was valorized and partially restored to the construction phase pre–dating the building–up of the portico and the extensions to the building, which is believed to had been carried out in 1849. Today, the {{church of the}} Visitation of the Blessed Virgin Mary is a single–nave, longitudinal, east–facing church, with a square apse and a portico before the west front. Architectural features of the church indicate a strong presence of the Gothic tradition and a possible origin of the church in the early period of the Dubrovnik Republic’s rule over Konavle. Of this, however, we have no historical confirmation, while scholarship and archival records, both the earlier known and the newly–discovered, point to the 17 th century as the time of origin of the church of the Visitation of the Blessed Virgin Mary. It can be assumed that the church of Our Lady of Promise was built as a votive chapel, meant to safeguard the valuable crops of this fertile plain that was exceptionally important to the Dubrovnik Republic. In the course of the 1997 efforts, the wall paintings were investigated and valorized. The rest of the wall paintings from inside the sanctuary, in the apse and above the triumphal arch, are particularly valuable as a rare example of mural painting in churches all across Konavle. Conservation work on the wall paintings was carried out in 2014 on two different historical layers, dating probably from the 17 th and the 19 th century, respectively. The layers were presented side–by–side. By adhering to the technology of execution and hallmarks of the periods in which they originated, the conservation procedure was adapted to each of the preserved layers. As the Konavle Plain has over time ceased to be the economic centre of Konavle, so has the church of the Visitation of the Blessed Virgin Mary lost its earlier meaning and importance.

Petra apostola, s ciljem definiranja ulaznog objekta na istočnom pročelju dvorca i tlocrta crkve u njezinom južnom dijelu, koliko je to moguće s obzirom na složenost komunalne infrastrukture. Također, trebalo je utvrditi postojanje, odnosno odsutnost arhitekture poradi budućeg planiranja premještanja raznovrsnih instalacija u tom dijelu Iloka. Istraživanjima je definiran velik ulazni obrambeni objekt pred istočnim pročeljem dvorca Odescalchi, a na crkvi Sv. Petra apostola otkriven je južni dio <b>apside</b> s potpornjakom, južni dio zvonika s potpornjakom i južni dio zapadnog pročelja crkve. U sondama ispred škole, južno od crkve, nisu pronađeni tragovi arhitekture. In June and July 2008, {{the last}} archaeological {{excavation}} project {{was conducted in}} Ilok, at the Castle of the Dukes of Ilok and the Church of St. Peter the Apostle sites, {{which is part of}} the project “Research, Reconstruction and Revitalisation of the Cultural Heritage of Ilok-Vukovar-Vučedol”, supported by the Croatian Government and the European Development Bank. Research was conducted in line with the clearly defined guidelines of the Ministry of Culture, and its objective was to define single noteworthy elements. One of these was the considerable defensive entry structure on the eastern façade of the Odescalchi Palace, and another was the unexamined part of the Gothic Church of St. Peter the Apostle that could be excavated given the complex communal infrastructure. As for the church, it was necessary to find out whether there were pieces of architecture at two locations near the north façade of the Primary School, lying south of the fifteenth century Church of St. Peter the Apostle. The excavations at the site Castle of the Dukes of Ilok focussed on the area from the 2007 excavation line eastward over a length of 19. 06 m and from the outbuilding toward the southern over a length of 15. 51 m. The objective of the excavation was to ascertain where the continuation of the fortified entrance complex of the Castle of the Dukes of Ilok was in the ground-plan. The walls of the entrance building were identified below a layer of shattered rubble covering a length of 14. 62 m. They were damaged when outbuildings were constructed in the nineteenth century, and by recent installations. The total length of the entrance complex is 22. 97 m, and the width 11. 13 m. From historical sources, we learned that the outbuildings were burned down in the mid-twentieth century, so that their walls remained preserved only up to a height of two rows of bricks. Excavations at the site of the Church of St. Peter the Apostle in 2008 were conducted at four locations. In the excavations of 2008, the southern part of the church ground-plan was defined at two spots with two trial-trenches placed on the northern side of the road. This enabled the excavation of the southern part of the apses with a support pillar, and the southern part of the bell-tower with a support pillar at the front of the church. Along with the bell-tower that was formerly in the middle of the church’s west façade, an extension of the wall of the church’s west façade was uncovered, which was otherwise constructed simultaneously with the bell-tower. Two trenches excavated along the northern façade of the primary school building south of the church in order to plan the position of all installations on the site did not reveal any pieces of architecture, but the existence of archaeological layers was ascertained. At the end of the excavations, all trenches were covered by geotextile and then with sand and earth...|$|E

Nakon dvokratnog i dvovrsnog istraživanja pokazalo se da je vjerovanje u Majku Božju Snježnu na navedenom području vrlo živa pojava te da ova svetica ima bitnu ulogu u oblikovanju identiteta krivoputske zajednice. In {{this work}} is {{represented}} the piety shown towards Our Lady of the Snow in the villages and settlements in the Krivi Put region. A church dedicated in honour of Our Lady of the Snow was built in Krivi Put in 1856. The main altar is dedicated to her and her statue is also there. This work was based on data collected during research which {{was carried out in}} two parts. In {{the first part of the}} research made in May 2004 the devotion to Our Lady of the Snow and celebration on her day (5 th August) using half-structured interviews was taken. In the second part of the findings we researched the celebration of Our Lady of the Snow in 2004 whilst participating in the celebration. Two different approaches to the research of the same subject brought some difficulties (it was impossible to compare of all the data) but on the other hand, this allowed us a better insight into the phenomenon and its better understanding. In this work we present the devotion to Our Lady of the Snow separated in small subjects, which were created during the interviews: legends about church buildings, prayers and vows, processions on her holiday and the celebration of the holiday with a special emphasis on the celebration in 2004). Research showed that practical belief in Our Lady of the Snow in Krivi Put is related to the legend about Santa Maggiore in Rome but the locations in local legends are adapted to the Krivi Put region. Prayers which believers dedicate to Our Lady of the Snow, except in one case, are related to solving problems in this life. Most of the time people pray for help in case of illness. There are mostly women making vows to Our Lady of the Snow. The fulfilment of vows happens on her day. A person obliged by vow passes around the altar in the church three times, generally touching the left and right corners of the altar. Some older women make a cross touching the altar. During the third pass some women put their messages and pray to Our Lady of the Snow in a special basket. Sometimes they even place some money. One by one they stop in front of the altar and some of them will kneel. After passing around the altar they go to the statue of Our Lady of the Snow on the left altar. They stay in front of statue and pray, some staying, some kneeling and touching the statue. Donations of money are very often a way of giving gratitude to Our Lady of the Snow for her help. During the procession, mainly old women touch the outside part of the church’s arch. One of the interviewees said that the reason for this is to make the pray dedicated to Holy Mother more powerful, but it could be also a sign of their vow. Aside this, Our Lady of the Snow is important in the creation of the local community’s identity because people from Krivi Put consider her as ‘their saint’ and ‘protector’. Die Autorinnen beschreiben in diesem Artikel die Verehrung der Mutter Schnee in Dörfern und Gehöften auf dem Gebiet des Ortes Krivi Put. Der Artikel gründet sich auf den zweitägigen Untersuchungen. Im ersten Teil der Untersuchungen, im Mai 2004, wurde die Verehrung der Maria Schnee untersucht. Im zweiten Teil untersuchten die Autorinnen die Kennzeichnungen von diesem Festtag als die teilnehmenden Beobachter (August 2004).

Razvrstani su u nekoliko horizonata, uglavnom na temelju međusobnih stratigrafskih odnosa. Mjestimično su pronađeni i istraženi tragovi naseobinskoga sloja iz srednjega vijeka. Po prvi puta je istraživano i područje izvan gabarita Staroga grada, gdje je otkriven obrambeni jarak (ukoliko nije riječ tek o strmoj padini terena u ranije doba). Čini se da je ukapanje jarka oštetilo i ugao pretpostavljene romaničke <b>apside.</b> Dokumentirano je postupno zatrpavanje jarka. Otkriven je i kasnosrednjovjekovni zid nepoznate namjene koji se nalazio izvan gabarita Grada kakvoga znamo. Lokalitet je nakon istraživanja zasut pijeskom. Istraživanja će se nastaviti. In {{the period}} between 10 May and 12 June 2010, the Institute of Archaeology (IARH) {{conducted}} the ninth phase of archaeological excavations in Ivanec at the Stari Grad site. This {{is a continuation of}} excavations that have been carried out by the IARH at the initiative of the Town of Ivanec since 1998 (Belaj 2008). In 2010, excavations of the area within the northern, rectangular tower of Stari Grad were completed. Excavations west of the tower commenced, and the area south of the tower, i. e. between the tower and the Gothic St. John’s Church continued. However, the most intensively excavated area was a trial-trench of 4. 80 × 7. 20 m located east of the northern tower. This was due to the extraordinary features of the structure unearthed beneath the northern tower during the campaign of 2009. Namely, it seems that the foundations represent the remains of the oldest and thus most valuable structure found {{in the course of the}} excavations: a Romanesque church. However, the situation found in this area differs from what was expected. An assumed large defensive trench was unearthed which at an earlier point of time used to surround Stari Grad. Unfortunately, we still cannot claim with certainty that this was really a ditch, as only a smaller part of its southern slopes have been excavated. In favour of the assumption that it was a ditch is the fact that it cut and consequently destroyed the presumed eastern wall of the apse of the newly discovered church, which was precisely the structure that was the primary objective of this year’s excavations. The ditch was later cut by a large long trench extending along the eastern foundations of the northern tower. Consequently, the northern tower represents a newer defence stage of the Old Town, even though the ditch and the tower might have been used in parallel for a while. In the ditch, several filling phases can be identified. The older stage is represented by a smaller number of fills, cut during the construction of the eastern wall of the northern tower, while the newer stage followed after the construction of the northern tower when, after the ditch had been more or less filled to the top, the area east of the tower was covered by a thick layer of yellow clay, which probably served for the final levelling of the terrain. Remains of pillars were identified, set in large holes sunk deep into the lowest fills of the ditches, around which at a later stage the fills were deposited. Although, unfortunately, the ditch cut the structure identified in the course of earlier excavations, which could represent the eastern wall of the apse of the newly discovered church, the function of the structure is partly also suggested by a grave in which lower leg and foot bones were unearthed. It is located in the presumed apse, and its isolated position speaks in favour of it being connected with the newly discovered church, and not the Gothic Church of St. John. In this area, south of the ditch, a small amount of paving was also excavated, constructed of medium-sized stones (15 - 20 cm), bound by firm white plaster and covered with a thinner layer of white plaster. The relationship between this paving (possibly even the structure’s flooring) and the ditch could not be determined exactly. In the course of the 2010 campaign, the northern tower was completely excavated. The last ten graves were excavated, of which nine were located to the south of the newly discovered building, and one in the presumed apse of the Romanesque church. Excavations also continued in the sector North of the Nave of the Gothic Church of St. John, where 15 graves were researched. On the basis of individual finds, their interrelations and the differences between individual burial phases identified in previous research, the graves were chronologically classified into several burial phases. Several graves, excavated in the north, near the Gothic Church of St. John, can be assigned to the newer burial horizon, which is characterised by the presence of belt buckles and burying the deceased with their arms crossed over their chest or stomach. Some graves with the deceased with their arms laid by their body belong to the medium burial phase. Just as in past excavations, in the graves of this phase no remains of coffins or nails were encountered. An older medium phase stands out which had already been identified in and around St. John’s Church, characterised by burials that do not follow the orientation of St. John’s Church and probably do not belong to the graveyard of this newly discovered, older Romanesque church. An interesting phenomenon, already noticed in previous years among finds from some of these graves, is the occurrence of animal teeth. These appear relatively frequently as grave goods. Probably, they functioned as amulets. This year, the assumption that some graves belonged to the oldest burial phase, usually characterised by stone paving and Bijelo Brdo culture material, could be confirmed solely on the basis of stratigraphic relationships. Among the graves ascribed to this stage, grave 279 stands out. It is a sort of ossuary with the relatively well preserved bones of an adult person which were irregularly arranged in the grave. It seems to be either a secondary burial or a body that had been cut into pieces before its burial. On the burial’s rims large, poorly preserved iron mounts were found. Therefore it seems that the remains were buried in a wooden casket. Despite a large number of graves, the exceptionally fatty and compact black and brown cultural layer was also preserved in smaller segments. In the black layer, some fragments of house daub, varying in size, were found along with pottery shards, many of which were decorated with a wavy line. In the brown layer, which regularly occurs under the black layer, many pieces of house daub and some provincial classical Roman or Celtic pottery were unearthed. Among finds unearthed in the 2010 excavations, the largest in number are ceramic vessel shards, particularly from the new era. A large number of stove tile fragments from the same period were also found, as well as many iron nails and other metal artefacts, along with fragments of glass, porcelain, etc. From the Middle Ages, there are mostly fragments of pottery and daub. These were found in the black cultural layer and in numerous fills. As far as special finds are concerned, the decorated or shaped shards of ceramic vessels and stove tiles, several bronze needles, two specimens of coins and various other metal artefacts particularly stand out. Among the newer fills of the ditch, Ferdinand II trimmed three-kreuzer silver coins were unearthed, probably minted in 1622 or 1623. Several fragments of glass bottles and other vessels were found, together with a ceramic whorl and, once again, several examples of animal teeth in graves. The find of a pair of compasses, probably of bronze, and also iron mounts from a smaller coffin from grave 279 particularly stand out...|$|E

Bavi se pitanjem trajanja forme i funkcije koju dobro ocrtava primjer tzv. mauzoleja Galle Placidije u Ravenni. Kompaktnu skupinu sličnih građevina čine bizantske memorije na jugu Istre, u Puli: krstionica, dvije kapele uz baziliku sv. Marije Formoze, te crkva sv. Mateja pred zidinama i Sv. Katarine na otočiću ispred Pule. Donekle su problematični oblik i vrijeme nastanka kapele sv. Andrije na otičiću ispred Rovinja. Srodne crkvice Sv. Klementa na Vrhu pred Pulom i sv. Tome nedaleko Rovinja upućuju na kontinuitet tog arhitektonskog tipa i tokom ranoga srednjeg vijeka u pulskoj regiji. Skupina sličnih građevina u Dalmaciji nema takvu kompaktnost. Krstionica u Baškoj na otoku Krku znatno je manja od crkve sv. Martina na Cresu, a jedna i druga različite su od trikonhalne nutrine u kapeli sv. Ciprijana u Gatima, te njene, vjerojatno nišama, raščlanjene vanjštine. S druge strane upravo su jednake dvije ranosrednjovjekovne kapele: sv. Vid u Zadru i sv. Križ u Ninu. One obnavljaju predloške ranokršćanskih križnih memorija. Indikativna je srodnost njihovih kupola s nekim primjerima iz bizantske arhitekture 10. i 11. stoljeća. Romanička kapela Sv. Dunata pored Kornića na otoku Krku ima neobično rješenje s oblim apsidama u poprečnoj osi prostora. Bogomolja nepoznatog titulara na Crkvini pored Kašića, nedaleko Zadra, srodna je drevnome tipu memorije s tri <b>apside</b> grupirane na začelnoj strani. Unatoć pojedinim razlikama ipak sve memorije i obje njihove skupine povezuje slična križna forma i funerarna funkcija te kontinuitet samog oblika i njegove namjene na tlu Istre i Dalmacije u vremenu od kasne antike do romanike. Zamjetan je također utjecaj bizantskih sredina na oblikovanje takvih memorija u kulturnom krajoliku Jadrana. Generally speaking, paleochristian memoriae {{have emerged}} {{out of the}} funeral traditions of the pagan world of Antiquity with its {{particular}} expression of the cult of deceased, sustained with the culture that {{had come out of}} Christian theology and aesthetics. It came together with new architectural forms some of which were characterized with cross-like forms, not only as a general symbol of new faith, but also as the spatial projection, model after which one had to build. It is defined by two axes that cross at the right angle, the framework of the overall architectural composition, factor of building’s extension in its entire length and width, as well as the height of the building that is dominated and marked by a dome. This particular structure of the building expresses its own essence, memorial use and the Christian paradigm. Through form and function, these buildings have become a distinguished phenomenon of the Christian civilization, valued in the architecture from the late antiquity to Romanesque period. Mature form of the space intended for the cult of the deceased, particularly when small cruciform churches are in question, is remarkably expressed in the preserved chapel of St. Lawrence, widely known as the mausoleum of Galla Placidia, one of two identical buildings once located at the ends of the narthex of the Ravennate church of the Holy Cross. The lower space of Theodoric’s mausoleum in Ravenna is also cruciform, however one should also remember emperor Justinian’s cruciform tomb in Constantinople church of the Holy Apostles. It was demolished in the 15 century, together with the whole complex, and is known only through historical sources. Together with the Ravennate memoriae, such tombs could have – directly or indirectly – influence the formation of the cruciform memoriae in the Adriatic cultural landscape from Late Antiquity to Romanesque period. This paper elaborates the group of approximately fifteen buildings that demonstrate – through their forms and funerary functions – perseverance of particular cruciform plan of a memoriae within the Adriatic ambiance. A particularly numerous group is that of southern Istria, which consists of the Pula cathedral baptistery, two chapels by the basilica of Sta Maria Formosa and St. Mathew’s chapel in Pula, that of St. Catharine on a nearby islet and the supposed cruciform church of St. Andrew on an island in front of Rovinj. To such a concentration of the paleochristian memoriae one should link two early-mediaeval chapels, that of St. Clement in Pula and St. Thomas’ near Rovinj. The latter’s forms were already commented by Ivan Matejčić to follow and repeat paleochristian features. Among these features there are three protruding apses similar to those of St. Catharine’s. Therefore, it seems that the forms and the measures of pre-Romanesque chapels were taken from those of the nearby Byzantine buildings, rather than from the distant Carolingian examples in Italy or France. Earlier and later southern Istrian memoriae are treated here as a typological group with emphasized regional features and continuity. Their forms differ only in some less important details, e. g. facades being either flat or articulated with lesenes. Their common features are, on the other hand, elementary architectural composition, spatial structure that consists of four branches and the dome hidden in the drum, as well as their dimensions and proportions. An element of particular interest is the octagonal upper part of the dome on Pula baptistery, that on St. Catharine’s on an islet in front of Pula as well as one on St. Andrew’s on an islet in front of Rovinj. These are probably reconstructions of the older solution. Within the supposedly later construction, there is a dome, a trula, as Pietro Kandler has named it, relating it with the Longboard architecture. It is carried by squinches. This solution is, actually, the Byzantine tradition in the area of Ravennate influences. A similar dome is constructed above the cruciform chapel consecrated to St. Mary Mater Domini (Theotokos), built next to the church of St. Felix and Fortunato in Vicenza, in 6 century. It seems that the same tradition was followed by very similar buildings, Paduan chapel of San Prosdocimo, and the memory erected by Santi Apostoli in Verona. On the other hand, St. Clement’s in Pula did not have a dome of such type and this church had yet another significant difference from the other Istrian chapels, the rectangular extension of areas in front of the apses. Another example that stands out from the group is the church of St. Euphemia at Saline bay in Lim channel. It is an Early Romanesque chapel with three apses at the rear. Lateral branches are reduced; they are much shorter than the front one, and give an impression of a transept rather than cruciform branches, as in other churches of the group. The upper part of the walls give no evidence of neither vaults nor a dome. Differently from the typological unity of the paleochristian and early mediaeval Istrian memoriae, those in Dalmatia show significant variability of the theme, already noticeable at the physiognomy of the earlier examples. For instance, the small baptistery in Baška on the island of Krk is an orderly cruciform building with relatively short branches and unarticulated flat walls, similar to Pula baptistery. The ground plan of St. Martin’s on the island of Cres is considerably different. It was a considerably larger building, probably in a memorial function related to a nearby villa rustica. It also has the rectangular extension in front of the apse, like St. Clement’s at Pula. Its walls show no traces of vaulted constructions. In a later phase, it was probably used as a parish church, like some examples of Dalmatian triconchal churches. A particular articulation of the walls, different from all of the Istrian and Dalmatian cruciform memoriae, was that of St. Cyprian’s chapel at Gata. Its short branches are rectangular on the outside, while on the inside they have inscribed round apses. Therefore, the outer surfaces have narrow round niches as relief of the thickened angles. Memory of the Holy Cross at Nin also has a round apse inscribed in the rectangular body of its rear branch. However, it is flanked by two smaller protruding apses, i. e. three in total. Other branches are vaulted with a half-dome on angular squinches that are also constructed below the drum with the dome inside. Ivo Petricioli has long ago suggested that its proportions indicate influences of the early mediaeval Byzantine architecture. This is further corroborated by its outer surfaces articulated with shallow niches. These features do not appear in Carolingian architecture, so it seems that the Holy Cross should be dated into the 10 th or the 11 th century. It also should be related to the influences from nearby Zadar - contemporary capitol of the Byzantine Theme of Dalmatia - with the church of St. Vitus whose features, both general form and details, are of the same type of the building. Furthermore, they should be compared with the chapel of St. Donatus at Kornić on Krk Island. This small church is of apparently different ground plan, but one could still consider it a cruciform type. Its front and rear branches are rectangular, and there are indications that the rear branch had a round apse inscribed, similarly to the memory of the Holy Cross at Nin. However, its lateral branches are relatively small round apses, protruding from the sides of the chapel. Among them, there is a relatively spacious central section with the dome constructed on the squinches. Miljenko Jurković has plausibly dated the church in 12 th century, while I believe that it confirms the continuity of the paleochristian cruciform type of the Christian memory in Istria and Dalmatia from Late Antiquity to the Romanesque period. This is proven by some contemporary constructions, such as the chapel of an unknown title at Crkvina near Kašić, near Biljani Donji, that has also been dated in Romanesque period. In spite of some individual differences all of the memoriae compared in this paper, both groups are assembled by numerousness and similarities of both cruciform plans and funerary functions. Also, the influence of Adriatic Byzantine centres, particularly that of Ravenna, Pula and Zadar, is noticeable in formation of the regional characteristics of memorial architecture in the cultural ambiance of Istria and Dalmatia, within the context of long-lasting continuity of its forms and functions, from Late Antiquity to Romanesque period...|$|E
