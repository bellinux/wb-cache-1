5|$|Initially, the {{operations}} room at RAF Uxbridge was disturbed by {{a visit from}} Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Most of the plotting tables were bare, save for a few plots indicating German reconnaissance machines. Most of the Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF) were relaxing, in spite of Churchill’s presence (he had ordered that they not behave <b>any</b> <b>differently).</b> However, at 10:30 the first German aircraft triggered the alarm at Chain Home radar station at Dover. The filter room at Stanmore recognised the formation as hostile. The WAAF detailed group and sector commands throughout the south that 40-plus enemy aircraft were entering Kentish airspace.|$|E
5|$|That morning, {{the police}} interrogated Fischer's girlfriend Marianela at the sheriff's office. They {{asked her if}} she had ever had cross words with Cristina. She said she had never talked to her, though she was {{confused}} why they asked about his ex-girlfriend. Cisneros was also interrogated, but the police found nothing unusual about her behavior, only that she was nervous, and had left her car keys inside her vehicle. Later that day, Cristina went to Buddy's house and offered her condolences. The police did not treat the Cisneros' connection to Fischer <b>any</b> <b>differently</b> {{than the rest of the}} leads. They knew of Cisneros's calls, but they did not think it was suspicious enough to rule the murder a crime of passion. His stepfather initially thought that the murder was tied to a legal dispute over a contract worth thousands of dollars he had with a Chinese shrimp firm based in Arroyo City, Texas, just north of Brownsville that he had terminated. The police began to investigate this lead, and told Fischer's family that they were probably in danger. For about two weeks, they rarely left their house, and his parents considered sending Kathy and Eric to San Antonio, Texas, where their grandparents lived.|$|E
25|$|Tommy Chong, a {{counterculture}} icon, was one {{of those}} charged, for his part in financing and promoting Chong Glass/Nice Dreams, a company started by his son Paris. Of the 55 individuals charged {{as a result of the}} operations, only Chong was given a prison sentence after conviction (nine months in a federal prison, plus forfeiting $103,000 and a year of probation). The other 54 individuals were given fines and home detentions. While the DOJ denied that Chong was treated <b>any</b> <b>differently</b> from the other defendants, critics thought the government was trying to make an example of him. Chong's experience as a target of Ashcroft's sting operation is the subject of Josh Gilbert's feature-length documentary a/k/a Tommy Chong, which premiered at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival.|$|E

25|$|The {{recording}} of its follow up, Play, {{took place during}} 1998 in Moby's Mott Street home studio in Manhattan, New York. At the time, Moby planned on making the album his last before ending his career. When he finished recording, {{there was no sign}} that the album would perform <b>any</b> <b>differently</b> than Animal Rights. According to Moby, he shopped the record to every major label (from Warner Bros. to Sony to RCA) and was rejected every time. After V2 finally picked it up, his publicist sent the record to journalists, many of whom declined to listen to it. According to manager Eric Härle in an interview with HitQuarters, their original goal was to sell 250,000 copies, which was what Everything Is Wrong, Moby's biggest-selling album at the time, had sold.|$|E
25|$|In Bowers v. Hardwick (1986), the Supreme Court heard a {{constitutional}} challenge to sodomy laws brought {{by a man}} who had been arrested, but was not prosecuted, for engaging in oral sex with another man in his home. The Court rejected this challenge in a 5 to 4 decision. Justice Byron White's majority opinion emphasized that Eisenstadt and Roe had only recognized a right to engage in procreative sexual activity, and that long-standing moral antipathy toward homosexual sodomy was enough to argue against the notion of a right to sodomy. Justice Blackmun, writing in dissent, argued that Eisenstadt held that the Constitution protects people as individuals, not as family units. He then reasoned that because state intrusions are equally burdensome on an individual's personal life regardless of his marital status or sexual orientation, there is no reason to treat the rights of citizens in same-sex couples <b>any</b> <b>differently.</b>|$|E

500|$|After {{seeing the}} first three episodes, Maxwell Zachs called the series [...] "a disappointment". One reason for this, he says, is that {{although}} [...] "we see... lovely, endearing transsexuals" [...] portrayed in the show, [...] "what I don’t see is anything {{that is going to}} make people think or feel <b>any</b> <b>differently</b> about what gender is or how it limits us all in one way or another."

500|$|He {{was very}} careful not to present his own views of the meaning of his films and leave them open to interpretation. He {{explained}} in a 1960 interview with Robert Emmett Ginna: [...] "One of the things I always find extremely difficult, when a picture's finished, is when a writer or a film reviewer asks, 'Now, {{what is it that you}} were trying to say in that picture?' And without being thought too presumptuous for using this analogy, I like to remember what T. S. Eliot said to someone who had asked him—I believe it was The Waste Land—what he meant by the poem. He replied, 'I meant what I said'. If I could have said it <b>any</b> <b>differently,</b> I would have". Kubrick likened the understanding of his films to popular music, in that whatever the background or intellect of the individual, a Beatles record, for instance, can both be appreciated by the Alabama truck driver and the young Cambridge intellectual in the way that his films can because their [...] "emotions and subconscious are far more similar than their intellects". He believed that the subconscious emotional reaction evoked by audiences was far more powerful in the film medium than in any other traditional verbal form, and was one of the reasons why he often relied on long periods in his films without dialogue, placing emphasis on images and sound. In a Time magazine interview in 1975, Kubrick further stated: [...] "The essence of a dramatic form is to let an idea come over people without it being plainly stated. When you say something directly, it is simply not as potent as it is when you allow people to discover it for themselves." [...] He also said [...] "Realism is probably the best way to dramatize argument and ideas. Fantasy may deal best with themes which lie primarily in the unconscious".|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{present a}} well-conditioned {{discretization}} {{of the electric}} field integral equation (EFIE) which is Hermitian and positive definite at <b>any</b> frequency. <b>Differently</b> from other preconditioning techniques, like hierarchical methods or Calderón schemes, no refinement of the mesh nor dual basis functions are necessary by the new formulation. This results in substantial computational savings since only the standard system matrix on the regular mesh needs to be stored. Moreover, the coexistence of hermitianity, positive definiteness, and well-conditioning properties allow for a fast direct inversion of the matrix in linear complexity. The new formulation {{is based on the}} regularization of the EFIE with a conjugated EFIE. The two matrices are linked with suitably chosen differential operators and Gram matrices that prevent the squaring of the condition number, and instead ensure a uniformly well-conditioned system matrix. Numerical results corroborate the theory and show the practical applicability of the new scheme...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAim of {{this paper}} is to {{evaluate}} how two non-destructive testing techniques may be integrated in a methodology to analyze the fatigue on materials.

Moreover, both the techniques use the energy directly produced by the stressed body without <b>any</b> external source, <b>differently</b> from other NDT (US, X-Rays …). The experimental tests were carried out on flat steel specimens either under static loading or under sequences of increasing cyclic loading (R= 0). The results allow to define the fatigue limit either by the thermography or by the acoustic emission. The present work is a first approach performed by the authors to compare and integrate the results obtained by experimental tests where the two methods were simultaneously applied...|$|R
40|$|An {{improved}} {{analytical method}} is presented for NEXT and FEXT noise calculation. The method avoids the pitfall {{of making an}} over pessimistic calculation of total noise contribution which arises when assuming that all sub-groups of n interfering systems are using the worst n pairs in a multi-pair cable. More importantly it does this without treating <b>any</b> sub-group <b>differently</b> {{so that there is}} only one way of making the computation. Further the computation is such that in various limiting or trivial cases it converges asymptotically to the reduced state. Also it never predicts a lower noise level when more disturbers are added. The method is being used by the FSAN VDSL subgroup in its consideration of Spectral Compatibility, and is based on and yields identical results to a method proposed by CSELT in [1].

2500|$|The {{presence}} of incorporated boroughs in Connecticut and incorporated villages in Vermont has influenced {{the evolution of}} cities in those states. In Connecticut in particular, {{the historical development of}} cities was quite different from in the other New England states, and at least technically, the relationship between towns and cities is even today different from elsewhere in New England. Just as boroughs in Connecticut overlay towns, so do cities; for example, while Hartford is commonly thought of as a city, it is coextensive and consolidated with the Town of Hartford; governed by a single governmental entity with the powers and responsibilities of the Town being carried out by the entity referred to as the City of Hartford. [...] In legal theory though not in current practice Connecticut cities and boroughs could be coextensive (covering the same geography as the town) without being consolidated (a single government); also a borough or city can span more than one town.
