The initial organic matter in the turbidite is very homogeneous and relatively high and offers an ideal case {{for the study of}} oxygen effects on organic matter preservation without the usual complications of varying sources or sedimentation rates and bioturbation. From all four studied turbidites, one sample from the oxidized part of the turbidite was compared with two samples from the unoxidized part. The aliphatic character of the kerogens after postdepositional oxidation has increased significantly, as revealed by the abundance of the n-alkanes and n-alk- 1 -enes in the oxidized turbidite. At the same time, the contribution of the isoprenoid alkanes and alkenes and the alkylthiophenes to the pyrolysate has decreased significantly. The relative abundances of alkylbenzenes, alkylnaphthalenes,alkylphenols, alkylindenes, and alkan- 2 -ones in the pyrolysates have remained relatively constant upon oxidation.

Discussion • The aromatic hydrocarbon fraction of petroleum derived UCMs is known to induce toxicity in mussels by reducing their Scope for Growth. For the first time, aromatic UCMs have been extracted from a suite of mussels exhibiting a range of SfG values and analysed in detail using comprehensive GCxGC-ToF-MS to determine their composition and identify the potentially toxic components. • Using the NIST mass spectral library {{it was possible to}} confidently identify some of the unknown toxic aromatic UCM hydrocarbons from their mass spectra. However, the majority of compounds could not be identified in this way, owing to the complexity of the samples and the limited number of spectra in the NIST library. • Accurate classification of the UCM hydrocarbons into compound classes and groups (Figure 6 a and b) is readily achievable using the 2 -D retention time data (Figures 4 and 5) and the base ions in the ToF-MS mass spectra (e. g. Figures 7 a and b). For example, the additional double bond in the core structure of alkylindenes make them more polar than the alkylbenzenes but less polar than the alkylnaphthalenes, so they fall between the alkylbenzenes and alkylnaphthalenes on the second dimension axis (Figure 5) ...|$|E

Ultraviolet (UV) light from the sun can induce various photochemical transformations of contaminants in the environment. Alkylnaphthalenes are light-molecular-weight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) which {{are one of the}} most widespread organic pollutants present in ambient air as a result of a variety of incomplete combustion sources. In this study, 1 -methylnapthalene,a typical example of an <b>alkylnaphthalene,</b> was subjected to UV irradiation to investigate its transformation in the presence and absence of air. Twenty-one products were detected in the reaction mixtures. Some photo-oxidation products were identified, including both ring-opened and ring-retained oxygenated compounds, such as 1 -naphthaldehyde, 1 -naphthoic acid, 1 -naphthalenemethanol and phthalic anhydride. Although dimeric products were observed in the presence of air, more were found in the presence of helium or argon gas, indicating a different photo-oxidation pathway from those commonly observed in other media, such as water. Under just 48 hours of exposure to the UV light in the presence of air, three major products were formed with a production yield of about 10 % each. Compared to 1 -methylnapthalene, the UV induced transformation products observed in this study are more volatile, acidic, water soluble or toxic.

Methyl substituted naphthalenes were better substrates than ethylnaphthalenes and naphthalene itself. The highest product formation activity for a singly substituted <b>alkylnaphthalene</b> was obtained with 2 -methylnaphthalene. The oxidation of alkylnaphthalenes was regioselective for the benzylic methyl or methine C–H bonds. The products from 1 - and 2 -ethylnaphthalene oxidation were highly enantioselective with a single stereoisomer being generated in significant excess. The disubstituted substrate, 2, 7 -dimethylnaphthalene, had a higher product formation activity than either 1 - and 2 -methylnaphthalene. Methyl substituted biphenyls were also better substrates than biphenyl and had similar biocatalytic parameters to 1 -methylnaphthalene. CYP 101 B 1 catalysed oxidation of 2 - and 3 -methylbiphenyl was selective for attack at the methyl C–H bonds. The exception was the turnover of 4 -methylbiphenyl which generated 4 ′-(4 -methylphenyl) phenol as the major product (70 %) with 4 -biphenylmethanol making up the remainder. The drug molecule diclofenac was also regioselectively oxidised to 4 ′-hydroxydiclofenac by CYP 101 B 1.

40|$|The {{rate of the}} self-initiated {{autoxidation}} of hexadecane at 160 0 C under 760 Torr of O 2 {{is reduced}} {{by the addition of}} submolar concentrations of naphthalene or <b>alkylnaphthalene.</b> The kinetics of these (alkyl) naphthalene-modulated, self-initiated hexadecane autoxidations have been examined by monitoring hydroperoxide concentrations. Under similar conditions, the extent of the rate retardation is essentially identical for equal concentrations of naphthalene and 1 - and 2 -methylnaphthalene (and 2 -sec-butylnaphthalene), which proves that retardation is due to chemistry associated with the naphthalene moiety. It is shown that the (alkyl) naphthalene produces both an increase in the rate constant for a bimolecular, peroxyl + peroxyl chain-termination process and a kinetically-first-order chain-termination reaction. Both of these termination processes are attributed to an initial addition of hexadecylperoxyl radicals to the naphthalene ring. Reaction of the resultant peroxycydohexadienyl radical with O 2 produces the HOO 2 ̆ 022 radical which is responsible for the increase in the rate constant for bimolecular termination. Unimolecular decomposition of the peroxycyclohexadienyl radical yields hexadecanol and an (alkyl) naphthoxyl radical, the latter being responsible for the kinetically-first-order termination process. A simplified scheme of 17 elementary reactions yields a kinetic expression which, via computer modeling, is shown to give a very satisfactory agreement between calculated and measured hydroperoxide yields under all experimental conditions surveyed. This simulation yields a rate constant k 19 of 2 ̆ 23 c 70 M - 1 s - 1 for the addition of hexadecylperoxyl radicals to (alkyl) naphthalenes at 160 0 C, a value which may be compared with the estimated rate constant for hydrogen abstraction from 1 - or 2 -methylnaphthalene under similar conditions, viz., k 15 = 34 M - 1 s - 1. The simulation also gives a satisfactory agreement between calculated and measured yields of organic hydroperoxides and hydrogen peroxide. That the naphthalene ring was oxidatively cleaved under the experimental conditions was demonstrated by the identification of phthalic acid and phthalic anhydride following the addition of naphthalene or a methylnaphthalene to autoxidizing hexadecane.

40|$|Sedimentary {{organic matter}} {{contains}} many compounds {{that have no}} obvious biogenic precursors, so their formation and occurrence are of geochemical interest. The {{first part of this}} thesis (chapters 2 - 5) discusses the results obtained from studying hydrocarbon racemates. Some of the compounds identified are also suggested as intermediates in the formation of <b>alkylnaphthalenes</b> identified in chapters 6 - 7. The second part of this thesis (chapters 6 - 11) covers the identification of a range of <b>alkylnaphthalenes</b> and alkylphenanthrenes in sedimentary organic matter. Possible pathways for the formation of these hydrocarbons are outlined and their application as probes into the processes of petroleum formation are described. In chapter 2 the use of permethylated cyclodextrin capillary gas chromatography columns to separate hydrocarbon racemates are reported. Chapter 3 reports the synthesis of 1, 2, 2, 5 -tetramethyltetralin and 1, 2, 2, 5, 6 -pentamethyltetralin and identifies them as racemates in crude oil. They are proposed as intermediates in the formation of sedimentary <b>alkylnaphthalenes</b> (identified in chapters 6 and 7). The identification of isodihydro-ar-curcumene in sedimentary organic matter is described in chapters 4 and 5. It co-occurs in crude oil with dihydro-ar-curcumene and is suggested to originate from this compound via a sedimentary rearrangement process. Chiral GC-MS techniques have been used to show the presence of both enantiomers of these compounds in crude oils. The elution order of the enantiomers has been established using reference compounds of known configuration. The effects of maturity and biodegradation on dihydro-ar-curcumene and isodihydro-ar-curcumene enantiomers is reported. Optically pure dihydro-ar-curcumene from natural products undergoes rapid racemisation in the subsurface, yielding a racemic mixture before the onset of significant oil formation. ++ 1, 2 -Alkyl shifts on the aromatic ring also begin at an early stage to yield isodihydro-ar-curcumene and these processes continue with increasing maturity. Laboratory experiments using proton and clay catalysts (Lewis acid catalyst) show that the alkyl shift reaction is catalysed by both proton and Lewis acids, and racemisation is only catalysed by Lewis acids. A moderately biodegraded crude oil {{has been shown to be}} depleted in the R enantiomer of dihydro-ar-curcumene and an extensively degraded oil has dihydro-ar-curcumene depleted relative to isodihydro-ar-curcumene. The identification of a number <b>alkylnaphthalenes</b> and their possible origins in sedimentary organic matter is described in chapters 6 and 7. In chapter 6 a previously unreported tetramethylnaphthalene (TeMN) was identified in petroleum. This compound is structurally similar to bicyclic compounds of microbial origin and these are suggested as a likely source, via a tetralin intermediate identified in chapter 3. In chapter 7 isomeric pentamethylnaphthalenes previously unreported in sedimentary organic matter are reported. These isomeric pentamethylnaphthalenes (PMNs) were identified in a number of crude oils and sediments, ranging in age from Proterozoic to Tertiary. 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 -PMN is suggested to form predominantly from the aromatisation of drimanoid precursors via 1, 2, 2, 5, 6 -pentamethyltetralin identified in chapter 3. In laboratory experiments, the other pentamethylnaphthalenes were generated from 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 -PMN in proportions that reflect the relative stability of the isomers. By analogy, the other PMNs in sediments are suggested to arise via acid catalysed isomerisation or transalkylation processes. A maturity parameter was developed based on laboratory experiments in conjunction with observed distributions of pentamethylnaphthalenes. The formation of <b>alkylnaphthalenes</b> and alkylphenanthrenes through a ++methylation process is discussed in chapters 8 - 10. Several crude oils and shales which contain anomalously high concentrations of 1, 6 -dimethylnaphthalene, 1, 2, 5 -trimethylnaphthalene, 1, 2, 7 -trimethylnaphthalene, 1, 2, 3, 5 -tetramethylnaphthalene, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 -pentamethylnaphthalene, 2 -methyl- 6 -isopropyl- 1 (4 -methylpentyl) naphthalene, phenanthrene, 1 -methylphenanthrene, 1, 7 -dimethylphenanthrene and retene have been shown to contain relatively high concentrations of their corresponding methylated counterparts. In laboratory experiments carried out under mild conditions, each of the <b>alkylnaphthalenes</b> and alkylphenanthrenes have been shown to be methylated in specific positions when heated with a methyl donor in the presence of a clay catalyst. These observations have been interpreted as evidence for a sedimentary methylation process. The effect of biodegradation on <b>alkylnaphthalenes</b> and alkylphenanthrenes formed from sedimentary methylation is described in chapter 11. Land-plant-derived aromatic hydrocarbons with a range of susceptibilities to reservoir biodegradation have been identified in crude oils. These compounds are the result of reactions of natural products involving aromatisation, rearrangement and methylation in the sediments (chapters 9 and 10). They are therefore suggested as markers for land-plants in severely biodegraded oils in which most of the other biologically derived compounds cannot be recognised. The order of biodegradability of these compounds has been assessed relative to their non-methylated counterparts namely 6 -isopropyl- 2 -methyl- 1 -(4 -methylpentyl) naphthalene and retene. The order of degradation of the four compounds is : retene 6 -isopropyl- 2, 4 -dimethyl- 1 -(4 -methylpentyl) naphthalene.

40|$|Two {{case studies}} are {{described}} where partially biodegraded petroleum residues {{were collected from}} the marine environment and analysed to investigate the changes in aromatic hydrocarbons with increasing biodegradation. The first of these studies, involved following the weathering of sea-floor residues from drilling discharges from an offshore petroleum exploration and production platform situated {{off the coast of}} North Western Australia. During operations, formation cuttings with adhering oil-based drilling muds were discharged into the ocean via a chute into approximately 125 n 1 of water, forming a substantial mound {{at the base of the}} platform. A suite of seabed sediments was collected from 16 sampling sites at various distances from the platform immediately following the cessation of drilling operations. The distribution of hydrocarbons in the sediment directly under tile cuttings chute was consistent with that found in drilling fluids formulated from a kerosene-like fluid. The samples from more remote sites exhibited the successive enhancement of an unresolved complex mixture relative to the n-alkanes, associated with tile presence of residues from petroleum biodegradation processes. In a subsequent sampling some three years later, a 10 cm core was retrieved from the cuttings pile and divided into 1 cm depth intervals. Samples within 6 cm of the surface of the cuttings pile contained biodegraded residues of the drilling mud, where the extent of biodegradation increased with decreasing proximity to the surface, most likely indicative of aerobic biodegradation. Biodegradation was less evident in the underlying sediments, where anaerobic conditions prevailed. Analysis of the aromatic hydrocarbons in both sets of sediment extracts by using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) revealed the successive depletion of alkylnaphthalenes, and due to the subtlety of changes in the extent of biodegradation, provided an excellent opportunity to examine the susceptibility of biodegradation towards the individual alkylnaphthalenes in the marine environment. Conventional GC-MS analysis of these mixtures is performed under chromatographic conditions where complete resolution of the mixture is not achieved and several isomers co-elute. The mass spectra of these co-eluting isomers may be so similar that one is unable to differentiate between them, and their abundance may therefore not be determined. Since each isomer has a unique infrared spectrum, however, the abundance of each individual isomer was determined by comparing the infrared spectrum of the co-eluting compounds with the spectrum of each of the isomers. To this end, techniques were developed for the application of direct-deposition gas chromatography - Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (GCFTIR) to the analysis of the complex mixture of alkylnaphthalenes present in the petroleum. This technique was also extended to discriminate between individual alkylphenanthrene isomers, and to clarify the sorption behaviour of the dimethylphenanthrenes by mordenite molecular sieves. The identification of other compounds of geochemical significance in petroleum is also described. Analyses of' the aromatic hydrocarbons in the contaminated sea-floor sediments using GC-FTIR enabled the unambiguous identification and quantification of each of the dimethylnaphthalene, trimethylnaphthalene and tetramethylnaphthalene isomers present in the samples, from which the relative extents of depletion of each with increasing extent of biodegradation were determined. It was apparent from the considerable differences in the observed susceptibility to biodegradation that a strong relationship exists between the compound structure and its susceptibility to biodegradation, with 1, 6 -disubstituted polymethylnaphthalenes being preferentially depleted relative to other isomers that lack this feature. The second case study involved tracking the fate (weathering) of hydrocarbons from an accidental release of condensate from a buried pipeline into intertidal coastal (mangrove) sediments in North Western Australia. Sediment samples were collected on nine occasions over a three-year period. Chemical analysis of the saturated and aromatic hydrocarbon components of the petroleum extracts revealed that both hydrocarbon fractions exhibited an increasingly biodegraded profile with increased residence time in the sediments. In a similar manner to the first case study, detailed analysis of the aromatic hydrocarbons using GC-FTIR techniques was performed to determine the depletion of individual <b>alkylnaphthalene</b> isomers with increasing extent of biodegradation. It was apparent that a relationship similar to that observed for the sea-floor sediments exists between the <b>alkylnaphthalene</b> structure and its susceptibility to biodegradation. Changes in the distribution of methylphenanthrene and dimethylphenanthrene isomer mixtures were also studied and the susceptibility to biodegradation amongst these determined in a similar manner. These relative susceptibilities to biodegradation of the aromatic hydrocarbons were then related to the established hierarchy of susceptibilities of the saturated hydrocarbons, in effect providing a second parallel system for the assessment of the extent of biodegradation. Finally, a system of ratios calculated from the relative abundances of selected aromatic hydrocarbons was developed and used as indicators to differentiate between several crude oils that have been biodegraded to varying extents. These parameters also offer promise as indicators of multiple accumulation events in oil reservoirs where petroleum fluids biodegraded to differing extents are mixed...|$|E

The increase of the degree of recrystallization leads first to the formation of {{composite materials}} MOR/MCM- 41 and then to a complete transformation of mordenite in MCM- 41, followed by a gradual decrease of the amount and strength of acid sites. Recrystallized materials display remarkably high activity, stability and selectivity in alkylation of naphthalene with cyclohexene. The effect is due to the improved accessibility of active sites and easier transport of bulky molecules provided by mesopores. The best catalytic performance is achieved on composite materials with intermediate degree of recrystallization.

Analyses were carried out on "thermal extracts" obtained at a Curie-temperature of 358 °C and on pyrolysates obtained at a Curie-temperature of 770 °C. The relative concentrations of alkylphenols and <b>alkylnaphthalenes</b> decrease with increasing maturity. Alkylbenzenes are prominent pyrolysis products throughout the maturity interval investigated. A {{significant increase in the}} relative concentration of alkylphenanthrenes and alkylbiphenyls with increasing maturity is noted. There is a substantial similarity between the compositions of "thermal extracts" and pyrolysates. This indicates that the trends observed are mainly due to changes in frequency distributions of extractable compounds. Vitrinite reflectance measurements carried out on the unextracted and extracted concentrates revealed no significant differences with one exception. For one sample, with a maturity approximately at the transition from the "oil window" to the "gas window", solvent extraction resulted in a significantly higher reflectance value of the residue.

The emitted volatile fraction was collected {{by means of}} dynamic purge-and-trap concentration at ambient temperature, and analyzed by comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC × GC) hyphenated with mass spectrometric detection systems, using quadrupole (GC × GC/qMS) and time-of-flight (GC × GC/ToF-MS) mass analyzers and selective nitrogen-phosphorus detection (GC × GC-NPD). The analysis of mass spectrometry data and GC × GC retention time allowed the tentative identification of about 300 compounds based on spectrometric data and positioning of each compound in the GC × GC plot. Major important headspace components are polyaromatic hydrocarbons, phenols and benzene derivatives, hydrocarbons and heterocyclic compounds containing nitrogen, sulphur or oxygen atoms. Many of the reported compounds are listed as belonging to toxicological substance classes which have been related to harmful health effects. GC × GC provides greater speciation and evidence of composition heterogenicity of the sample than one-dimensional GC analysis, thus allowing to better demonstrate its potential toxicity. Data obtained by specific detection systems for N-heterocycles assisted mass data interpretation assignments. The enhanced separation power obtained after GC × GC compared to one-dimensional gas chromatography (1 D-GC) together with spectral deconvolution and correlation with physical-chemical data, allowed the identification of complex isomer clusters, as demonstrated for alkylquinolines, and applied also to alkylphenols, alkylbenzenes and <b>alkylnaphthalenes...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a detailed study on the occurrence and distribution of <b>alkylnaphthalenes</b> and alkylphenanthrenes in 39 coal and sediment samples from the Late Palaeozoic containing predominantly terrestrial organic matter. Most of the samples represent the Euramerian flora realm and originate from locations beyond the Variscan front in Eastern, Northern and Central Europe, i. e. especially England and the Moscow Basin. The samples are of relatively low maturity (0. 32 to 1. 80 % R-r) and consist mainly of mixtures of type III and II kerogen. Quantification of the C- 0 - to C- 4 -naphthalenes and the C- 0 - to C- 4 -phenanthrenes showed that these compound classes were highly abundant in all samples. Aromatic hydrocarbon maturity parameters in general are in good agreement with measured vitrinite reflectance values. 1, 2, 7 -Trimethylnaphthalene, an assumed diagenetic product of oleanane type biomarkers was present in all investigated samples. This observation provides evidence that oleanane type lipids were biosynthesised by organisms predating the evolution of angiosperms or that assumed formation pathways for 1, 2, 7 -trimethylnaphthalene are insecure. 1, 2, 8 -Trimethylphenanthrene was significantly enriched in samples from the Permian and the one sample from the Devonian investigated in this study. The precursor(s) of 1, 2, 8 -trimethylphenanthrene therefore may have been produced by organisms which were least abundant in the Carboniferous depositional environments represented by our samples.

Alkyl-transfer of simpler alkylaromatics ranging from mono to polyalkyl-benzenes and <b>alkylnaphthalenes</b> were studied in a fixed bed reactor system on solid acid catalysts (zeolites) at temperatures up to 400 °C. Results showed that alkyl-transfer reactions are reversible reactions with disproportionation favoured at lower temperatures while transalkylation seemed to be dominant at higher temperatures. The outlined mechanism showed that the catalyst pore sizes and the type of pores as well as the feed composition of binary mixtures play important roles in the transfer of alkyl groups between aromatic molecules. In alkyl-transfer reactions, the ease of conversion depends on the number of alkyl groups on the aromatic ring/s, the chain length, the type of alkyl substituent/s and the ring conjugation of the aromatic moiety. Zeolitic catalysts are rapidly deactivated by carbonaceous material deposition during alkyl-transfer reactions especially at higher temperatures while deactivation through molecular retention is dominant at lower temperatures. Nevertheless, zeolites can be regenerated by high temperatures in oxidizing atmospheres. Bulkier alkylaromatics (those found in coal and petroleum liquids) can be transformed through alkyl-transfer reactions if a suitable catalyst with the required strength and appropriate pore sizes can be developed, preferably a tri-dimensional arrangement as shown by the results of this study. Thus the alkyl-transfer process has promising future applications in petrochemical and related industries; especially those interested in the transformation of coal to chemicals...|$|R
40|$|Twenty three {{crude oils}} from the Serbian {{part of the}} Pannonian Basin (14 from the Vojvodina Province and 9 from the Drmno Depression) were investigated, aimed at an {{evaluation}} of oil–oil maturity correlation parameters based on the distribution and abundance of saturated biomarkers and alkylarene constituents. Factor and cluster analyses were used for this purpose. Factor analyses using varimax rotation were first run separately, i. e., of maturity parameters based on the abundance of (a) n-alkanes and isoprenoids, (b) steranes and triterpanes, (c) <b>alkylnaphthalenes,</b> and (d) alkylphenanthrenes. These analyses yielded 9 important “maturity factors”. Eight of them, showing higher than 30 % of variance, were further involved in another factor analysis, {{as well as in}} cluster analysis using the Ward method. In this way, all maturity parameters based on saturated biomarkers and alkylarenes were evaluated and ranged, considering the fact that the observed factors represented their linear combinations. The results showed that in the correlation of crude oils from the Serbian part of the Pannonian Basin, the most important were maturity parameters based on isomerization reactions involving one methyl group in thermodynamically less stable α-methylnaphthalenes, ethylnaphthalenes, dimethylnaphthalenes and methylphenanthrenes, and their change into more stable isomers with the methyl group in the β position in the aromatic ring. Processes constituting high loadings factor 2 and factor 3 parameters were also defined. Hierarchy between the “factors” and parameters were controlled, and approved, by cluster analysis using the Ward method. Finally, the investigated crude oils were correlated by factor and cluster analyses, using all the important “maturity factors”.

40|$|The {{emission}} {{spectra of}} some <b>alkylnaphthalenes</b> containing amino or hydrazine moieties {{in the side}} chain exhibit anomalous fluorescence bands. The spectral data {{are consistent with the}} proposal that the bands are derived from intramolecular exciplexes. The steric and electronic requirements for intramolecular exciplex formation are discussed {{on the basis of the}} dipole moments, wavelengths of fluorescence maxima and, in the case of the hydrazines, the N. M. R. spectra. Irregularities in the rate constants for intermolecular quenching of 9 -methylanthracene fluorescence by hydrazines and in the fluorescence spectra of hydrazines are believed to be due to solute association, probably via hydrogen bond formation. A study of the products obtained by irradiation of certain monoacylhydrazines has been made, it is proposed that reaction proceeds by a photoinduced homolysis of the N - N bond. Salts of N,N-diethy 1 - 2 -(1 -naphthyl) ethylamine with hydrogen halides and alkyl halides have been shown to exhibit exciplex formation in aprotic solvents. The results are interpreted in terms of electron transfer from the halogen anion to the singly excited naphthalene, followed by a rapid elimination of hydrogen halide or alkyl halide. The fluorescence quenching of cyanosubstituted aromatic hydrocarbons has been shown to proceed via exciplex formation when the hydrocarbons possess a high singlet energy. Intramolecular fluorescence quenching of naphthalene by dienes and olefins does not give rise to a fluorescent complex, this has been explained in terms of the character of the quenching groups. Donor-acceptor complexes formed between imides and amines or aromatic hydrocarbons have been shown to give an excited state charge-transfer complex upon excitation. Enhanced complex formation has been observed upon freezing cyclohexane or aceto-nitrile solutions of the compounds. Ester and ether groups have been used to separate two naphthalene moieties. Excitation yields excited state naphthalene complexes even when the linking chain consists of more than three atoms. Similar complexes have been detected in cyclohexane and acetonitrile matrices, it is suggested that excitation of aggregates or crystals formed upon freezing give rise to the new fluorescence bands...|$|R

The abundance and similar distribution of biphenyls, cadalene and bicadinanes {{in most of the}} crude oils and condensates indicates a significant supply of higher-plant derived organic matter to the source rocks. Maturity levels of oils and condensates from the Surma basin were estimated based on the <b>alkylnaphthalenes,</b> alkylphenanthlenes, and diamondoids, correspond to calculated vitrinite reflectance (Rc) values of 1. 0 – 1. 3 %. Rc (%) values indicating hydrocarbon expulsion from the source rock at a comparatively high maturity level. The Rc values of oils from the Titas field in the southern margin of the Surma basin are relatively low (0. 8 – 1. 0 %). Some oils were severely biodegraded. The similar distribution of diamondoid hydrocarbons in both biodegraded and non-biodegraded oils indicated similar type of source rocks and similar maturity levels to those of oils from the Surma basin. Although the geochemical data set for the Oligocene and older sedimentary sequences is limited, the top of the Eocene Kopili Shale to lower Jenam Shale of early Oligocene sedimentary rocks rich in terrigenous organic matter are identified as possible source rocks. The relative abundance of C 7 aromatic, cyclic, and straight chain hydrocarbons in oil and condensates and other molecular parameters inferred diversity of the petroleum from waxy crude oils to condensates in the study area. This diversity of the petroleum was likely due to evaporative fractionation, resulting in residual waxy oils and lighter condensates which subsequently underwent tertiary migration and re-accumulation.

40|$|The {{chemical}} composition of morphologically well-preserved cuticular {{remains of the}} Cretaceous Gymnosperm Squamastrobus tigrensis found in the Bajo Tigre locality (Patagonia) was analysed by a progressive chemical degradation sequence involving: (i) lipid extraction after ultrasonic treatments; (ii) further BF 3 -MeOH transesterification; and (iii) repeated mild NaBO 2 -H 2 O 2 degradation of the final residue. The compound assemblages released after the successive treatments were considered to reflect lipid speciation patterns in the different levels of the cuticular structure. In particular, after all the treatments, the dominance of a homologous series of α,ω-alkanedioic acids with maxima at C 9 and C 10 indicates a polymethylene network based on macromolecules; the units of this network contain in-chain unsaturations or substitutions in positions {{similar to those in}} precursor unsaturated C 16 and C 18 acids. The low yields of ω-hydroxyacids typical of cutins and suberins of extant plants are interpreted as an intense microbial alteration and/or diagenetic transformation of the fossil cuticle. In conjunction with data from infrared spectroscopy and analytical pyrolysis, this suggests that the Squamastrobus remains consist of a macromolecular alkyl mixture in which the original C backbone has been defunctionalized, reoxidized, and subjected to additional condensation by the probable contribution of newly-formed, nonhydrolyzable bridges. It appears that this cellulose-lacking material includes a small moiety of altered lignin, and has been subjected to extensive oxidation, but not to further thermal alteration leading to decarboxylation. A possible result of this diagenetic alteration is that a portion of the resin constituents were transformed into lower molecular weight alkylbenzenes and <b>alkylnaphthalenes,</b> whereas another portion condensed into a very stable, nonhydrolyzable residue.

The main aims are to confirm the origin (source) and age of these oils based on CSIA of selected aromatic compounds and {{to understand why the}} Sofer plot is ineffective in establishing the source of western Australian petroleum systems. The bulk d 13 C of saturated and aromatic hydrocarbon fractions of crude oils have been previously used to differentiate sources, however, many Australian crude oils are not classified correctly using this method. The oils were classified as marine by the d 13 C values of individual aromatic compounds and as terrigenous based on the bulk d 13 C data (Sofer plot). The oils where the d 13 C values of 1, 6 -DMN and 1, 2, 5 -TMN isomers are most negative are indicative of a marine source, whereas oils with a less negative values for the 1, 6 -DMN and 1, 2, 5 -TMN isomers are derived from marine source rocks that contain a significant terrigenous component. Similarly, oils with the least negative d 13 C values for the 1 -MP and 1, 9 -DMP isomers reflect varying inputs of terrigenous organic matter to the their marine source rocks.

40|$|The {{kinetics}} of the azobis(isobutyronitrile) initiated autoxidation of 1 - and 2 -methylnaphthalene {{have been}} studied from 30 to 60 0 C in the pretence of sufficient tert-butyl hydroperoxide (1. 0 M) {{to ensure that the}} tert-butylperoxyl radical totally dominates chain propagation and bimolecular peroxyl/peroxyl chain termination. Initial rate measurements demonstrate that these oxidations do not follow the kinetic rate law which applies to alkylbenzenes and other hydrocarbons. Specifically, in addition to the usual second-order peroxyl/peroxyl termination there is a kinetically first-order chain termination reaction, the relative importance of which increases as the oxygen partial pressure is reduced. As a consequence, these autoxidations are self-inhibiting. The major reaction between tert-butylperoxyl and the methylnapbthalenes is hydrogen abstraction from the methyl group (rate constant, K p BR). Self-inhibition is a consequence of a competing, peroxyl radical addition to the aromatic ring, reaction 8. This is a very minor process, e. g., K 8 BR/K p BR = 0. 0036 at 30 0 C, and it does not entirely lead to chain termination. That is, the adduct radical formed in reaction 8 may react with O 2, a process which leads to chain propagation, or it may decompose to yield tert-butyl alcohol and a methylnaphthoxyl radical (reaction 9). It is the methylnaphthoxyl radical that is responsible for the kinetically first-order termination process (via its reaction with a second peroxyl). Reaction 9 is also responsible for the existence of a maximum chain length, 3 ̆bd max, in these autoxidations. That is, at a given temperature and oxygen partial pressure 3 ̆bd cannot be increased indefinitely by reducing the rate of chain initiation as is the case for most hydrocarbons.

D.), Civil Engineering, Washington State UniversityThe Proton Transfer Reaction Mass Spectrometer (PTR-MS) is a {{powerful}} tool for analyzing organic compounds in air and has been applied in field and laboratory applications to assess emissions from biomass burning and vehicles. Biomass burning is an important source of air pollution globally in the form of wild fires, burning of crop stubble, and combustion of organic material for home energy. In the United States, residential wood combustion combined with low inversion heights in winter time has caused air quality problems. Through field deployment of the PTR-MS in Xi’an China during August of 2011, it was determined that 27 %, 16 %, 26 %, and 12 % of ambient carbon monoxide (CO), acetaldehyde, benzene, and toluene could be attributed to biomass burning. The PTR-MS was also deployed to Yakima, Washington in January of 2013, finding that residential wood combustion was a substantial source of air toxics and PM. Residential wood combustion contributed 100 %, 73 %, 69 %, 55 %, 36 %, 19 %, 19 %, and 17 % of organic PM 1, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, black carbon, benzene, toluene, C 2 -alkylbenzenes, and CO respectively. 	Diesel vehicles are becoming a larger fraction of the vehicle fleet and can be held responsible for a substantial fraction of air pollution emissions from on and off road mobile sources. Diesel engines are a source of low volatility products that are difficult to measure and are thought to be important in the formation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA). This work focuses on measuring important diesel exhaust compounds with the PTR-MS and assessing oxidation processes of these compounds. When the PTR-MS was deployed to the field along with a thermal desorption preconcentration system, we estimated that diesel vehicles were about 3 - 15 % of the vehicle activity influencing our study site in Yakima, WA using the ratio of m/z 157 to m/z 129. SOA yields of diesel exhaust compounds were assessed and about 48 % of the SOA was attributed to compounds measured by the PTR-MS; with 21 % attributed to alkylbenzenes, 20 % attributed to alkanes, 3 % attributed to <b>alkylnaphthalenes,</b> 3 % attributed to molecular weight 178 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and 1 % attributable to cycloalkanes.

Diagnostic biomarker parameters along with stable bulk 13 C and D 			isotope abundance reveal three groups of oils in Potwar Basin. Group 			A contains terrestrial source of OM deposited in highly oxic/fluvio-deltaic 			clastic depositional environment shown by high Pr/Ph, high diahopane/hopane, 			high diasterane/sterane, low DBT/P ratios and higher relative 			abundance of C 19 tricyclic and C 24 tetracyclic terpanes. Aliphatic 			biomarkers for rest of the oils indicate marine origin however two 			ranges of values for parameters differentiate them into two 			sub-groups (B and C). Group B oils are generated from clastic rich 			source rocks deposited in marine suboxic depositional environment 			than group C oils which are generated from source rocks deposited in 			marine oxic depositional environment. Group C oils show higher 			marine OM (algal input) indicated by extended tricyclic terpanes (upto 			C 41 or higher) and higher steranes/hopanes ratios. Distribution of 			PAHs classified Potwar Basin oils into similar three groups based on 			depositional environments and source OM variations. Abundant 			biphenyls (BPs) and fluorenes (Fs) are observed in group A oils 			while group B oils showed higher abundance of dibenzothiophenes (DBTs) 			and negligible presence of dibenzofurans (DBFs) and Fs and group C 			oils showed equal abundance of DBTs and Fs. This relative abundance 			of heterocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in Potwar Basin oils broadly 			indicate that the distribution of these compounds is controlled by 			depositional environment of OM where sulfur compounds (i. e. DBTs) 			are higher in marine source oils while oxygen compounds (DBFs) and 			Fs are higher in oxic/deltaic depositional environment oils. Higher 			abundance of aromatic biomarkers the 1, 2, 5 -trimethylnaphthalene 			(1, 2, 5 -TMN), 1 -methylphenanthrene (1 -MP) and 			 1, 7 -dimethylphenanthrene (1, 7 -DMP) indicate major source of OM for 			group A oil is higher plant supported by abundance of conifer plants 			biomarker retene. Variations in distribution of triaromatic steroids 			(TAS) in Potwar Basin oils clearly indicate source dependent of 			these compounds rather than thermal maturity. Higher abundance of 			C 20 and C 21 TAS and substantional difference in distribution of long 			chain TAS (C 26, C 27, C 28) between the groups indicate different 			source origin of these compounds. Group A shows only C 27 and C 28 TAS 			while group B shows C 25 to C 28 TAS and absence of these compounds in 			group C oils revealed that the sterol precursors for these compounds 			are most probably different. Aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon 			maturation parameters indicate higher (late oil generation) thermal 			maturity for all oils from the Potwar Basin. The crude oils of group 			A and C are typically non-biodegraded mature crude oils whereas some 			of the oils from group B showed minor biodegradation indicated by 			higher Pr/n-C 17, Ph/n-C 18 and low API gravity. 			Distribution of PAHs and stable hydrogen isotopic composition (D) 			of nalkanes and isoprenoids has been used to assess the minor 			biodegradation in a suite of eight crude oils from Potwar Basin, 			Pakistan (group B). The low level of biodegradation under natural 			reservoir conditions was established on the basis of biomarker 			distributions. Bulk stable hydrogen isotope of saturated fractions 			of crude oils show an enrichment in D with increase in 			biodegradation and show a straight relationship with biodegradation 			indicators i. e. Pr/n-C 17, API gravity. For the same oils, D values 			for the n-alkanes relative to the isoprenoids are enriched in 			deuterium (D). The data are consistent with the removal of 			D-depleted low-molecular-weight (LMW) n-alkanes (C 14 -C 22) from the 			oils. The D values of isoprenoids do not change during the minor 			biodegradation and are similar for all the samples. The average D 			enrichment for n-alkanes with respect to the 			isoprenoids is found to be as much as 35 for the most biodegraded 			sample. The relative susceptibility of <b>alkylnaphthalenes</b> and 			alkylphenanthrenes at low levels of biodegradation was discussed. 			<b>Alkylnaphthalenes</b> are more susceptible to biodegradation than 			alkylphenanthrenes while extent of biodegradation decreases with 			increase in alkyl substitution on both naphthalene and 			phenanthrenes. A range of biodegradation ratios (BR) are purposed 			from dimethylnaphthalene (DNBR), trimethylnaphthalenes (TNBR) and 			tetramethylnaphthalene (TeNBR) that show significant differences in 			values with increasing biodegradation and are suggested as good 			indicators for assessment of low level of biodegradation. 			Laboratory experiments have shown that activated carbon catalyses 			the reactions of biphenyls (BPs) with surface adsorbed reactants 			that incorporate S, O, N or methylene forming some common 			constituents of sedimentary organic matter namely, dibenzothiophene 			(DBT), dibenzofuran (DBF), carbazole (C) and fluorene (F).
