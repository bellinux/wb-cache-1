5|$|Ritchie Valens, {{who once}} had a fear of flying, asked Tommy Allsup for his seat on the plane. The two agreed to toss a coin to decide. Bob Hale, a DJ with KRIB-AM, was working the concert that night <b>and</b> <b>flipped</b> the coin in the ballroom's side-stage room shortly before the musicians {{departed}} for the airport. Valens won the coin toss for the seat on the flight.|$|E
5|$|He {{returned}} to Team Penske for the 2005 season. At Phoenix in the season's second race, Hornish started {{in second place}} and won after leading for 25 laps. During practice for the Indianapolis 500, he drove over a piece of debris after Paul Dana's second-turn crash <b>and</b> <b>flipped</b> over. Two days later Hornish qualified in second place, crashing out after leading for a race-high 77 laps and finishing 23rd. At the Milwaukee Mile he qualified for the pole position and led for 123 of 225 laps, passing Dario Franchitti with nine laps left for his second win of the season. Hornish {{finished third in the}} championship standings, with 512 points.|$|E
5|$|September 16â€“17, 2014: Hurricane Odile's outer rainbands brought {{thunderstorms}} {{to parts}} of Southern California, as a tropical storm. The remnants of Hurricane Odile also caused damage across central and eastern San Diego County on September16, 2014, generating high winds and several uncharacteristically powerful thunderstorms in the region. Wind gusts over 20knots reportedly uprooting trees, felled branches, cut power lines, crushed several cars, <b>and</b> <b>flipped</b> at least one airplane at Montgomery Field Airport. Dry lightning generated by a line of severe thunderstorms {{in one of the}} rainbands set fire to a palm tree in San Diego and storm force wind gusts within those severe thunderstorms left 6000 customers without power.|$|E

5|$|In Florida, Allison's {{dangerous}} winds {{knocked down}} power lines, leaving 48,000 residents without power and/or telephone services. Along the 150-mile (240km) stretch of Florida's Big Bend, 65 seaside homes were flooded {{and there was}} extensive beach erosion {{as a result of}} the storm surge. Three hotels and a restaurant were damaged. In Apalachicola, three fishing boats were swamped; the storm closed a bridge linking Apalachicola with St. George Island. The highest storm surge in Florida was about 6 to 8feet (1.8 to 2.5m) in Wakulla and Dixie Counties, and 2 to 6feet (0.6 to 1.8m) to the east. A tornado spawned by Allison touched down at Jacksonville Beach, causing minor damage when it downed power lines <b>and</b> <b>flipped</b> over vehicles. Minor crop damage was also reported. There were no deaths reported as a result of Allison in Florida. Damage was estimated at $860,000 (1995 USD) in Florida, primarily {{as a result of the}} storm surge.|$|E
5|$|The final {{match of}} the evening was between Bret Hart and Bam Bam Bigelow to {{determine}} {{the winner of the}} tournament. Bigelow used his strength advantage to control the beginning of the match. He threw Hart out of the ring and focused on injuring Hart's back. Hart escaped from a bear hug and pushed Bigelow into the steel rail at ringside. Bigelow responded by pushing Hart's back into the ring post. Luna Vachon, Bigelow's valet, hit Hart with a chair, which enabled Bigelow to pin Hart and be declared the winner. Referee Earl Hebner came to the ring, however, and explained to Joey Marella, the referee for the match, what had happened. The match was ordered to continue, and Bigelow continued to attack Hart's back. While Bigelow was outside of the ring, Hart performed a flying crossbody by jumping over the top rope and landing on Bigelow. He attempted to perform the Sharpshooter but was unable. As Bigelow ran at Hart {{in the corner of the}} ring, Hart moved out of the way. He climbed onto Bigelow's shoulders <b>and</b> <b>flipped</b> Bigelow forward to pin him with a victory roll.|$|E
5|$|The {{sixth and}} first killer tornado of the {{outbreak}} touched down around 3:10a.m. EST and snapped several trees. After traveling for {{three quarters of}} a mile, it produced significant structural damage along North Carolina Highway 222 where a brick home was destroyed. A nearby trailer was rolled 30ft down the driveway of the home. The four residents sustained no injuries despite having not taken shelter before the tornado. A double-wide mobile home was blown off its foundation <b>and</b> <b>flipped</b> for 50ft before falling to the ground. One of the occupants, a 61-year-old woman was killed and her husband sustained major injuries. Three other mobile homes were destroyed by the tornado before it crossed into Wilson County. Once in Wilson County, several more mobile homes sustained significant damage before the tornado lifted. Damages from the tornado in both counties amounted to $700,000. The tornado was rated as an EF2 by the National Weather Service.|$|E

5|$|Farther to the {{northeast}} in Fayette County, Tennessee, another powerful tornado touched down near the rural community of Yum Yum and quickly reached EF3 intensity. This tornado was spawned by the same supercell that had affected Memphis about an hour earlier. Near {{the beginning of the}} path, a shed was obliterated and a pickup truck parked inside was thrown 40 feet and mangled, killing a man inside the vehicle. Several other vehicles were tossed, and significant damage to large trees was observed before the tornado crossed into Haywood County. Weakening to EF2 strength, the tornado struck the town of Dancyville, destroying a house, severely damaging another house and a church, and uprooting numerous large trees. The tornado then struck the rural community of Hillville, where two mobile homes were completely destroyed, a frame home was heavily damaged, and a convenience store sustained roof damage. Numerous large trees in this area were snapped, and an outbuilding was flattened. Several other homes along this segment of the path sustained minor damage. Regaining EF3 strength, the tornado crossed into Madison County, striking the Huntersville community. Numerous homes were damaged or destroyed in Huntersville, and two people were killed. A church in town sustained major damage, and a nearby church bus was tossed several hundred feet <b>and</b> <b>flipped</b> upside down. The tornado then exited Huntersville and headed towards the city of Jackson. Several cars and at least 13 tractor trailers were blown off of Interstate 40 by the tornado in this area. One car was tossed 75 yards into a farm field. A rest area along the interstate was severely damaged before the tornado began to weaken and lifted as it approached U.S. Route 412, dissipating just before it would have entered densely populated areas of western and northern Jackson.|$|E
5|$|The Horsa and Hamilcar gliders of {{the brigade}} landed at 21:00 on 6 June in a landing zone cleared of {{obstructions}} by the 5th Parachute Brigade. The primary tasks of the brigade were {{to bring in}} reinforcements and supplies, and to aid the two parachute brigades in consolidating the area held by the division; the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Squadron was {{to aid in the}} latter task, acting as a reconnaissance force to scout out German positions and impede the movement of German forces attempting to counter-attack. The Tetrarchs of 'A' Squadron were to play an integral part in this reconnaissance role due to their speed, but the squadron's strength of twenty tanks was severely depleted by the time it landed in Normandy. It lost one tank before the formation landed when the Tetrarch broke loose of its shackles and crashed through the nose of the glider that was carrying it, causing both to fall into the sea mid-flight. The squadron's strength was further weakened when two gliders collided with each other in the landing zone, destroying themselves and the Tetrarchs they carried; a third Hamilcar hit another Tetrarch as it was being unloaded <b>and</b> <b>flipped</b> the tank upside down, rendering it unusable, although the crew escaped without injury. The surviving tanks were then rendered temporarily immobile when parachute rigging lines became tangled in their suspensions, forcing their crews to cut the lines away with welding torches.|$|E

25|$|BourÃ©'s child recalls in {{some aspects}} the Apollo Sauroctonos ("Apollo the Lizard-Slayer"), an often-reproduced figure in {{classical}} antiquity of the pubescent god observing a lizard as it climbs up a tree. The original bronze was attributed to the Athenian sculptor Praxiteles. The Louvre acquired a white marble version in 1807. The sculpture received attention in French-language books on art published while BourÃ© was active, including Ã‰mile Gebhart's PraxitÃ¨le (1864) and Wilhelm FrÃ¶hner's Notice de la sculpture antique du MusÃ©e ImpÃ©rial du Louvre (1878). If {{an image of the}} Sauroctonos is rotated <b>and</b> <b>flipped</b> horizontally, the compositional resemblances with BourÃ©'s L'enfant au lÃ©zard become more evident. The Apollo's overall height of nearly 5 feet, which includes the tree trunk extending past the body, gives the figure a vertical proportion comparable to that of BourÃ©'s 4-foot horizontal boy.|$|E
