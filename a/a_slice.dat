5|$|Although the {{ingredients}} of the BLT have existed for many years, {{there is little evidence}} of BLT sandwich recipes prior to 1900. In the 1903 Good Housekeeping Everyday Cook Book, a recipe for a club sandwich included bacon, lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise and <b>a</b> <b>slice</b> of turkey sandwiched between two slices of bread. Whilst the 1929 book Seven Hundred Sandwiches does include a section on bacon sandwiches, the recipes often include pickles and none contain tomato.|$|E
5|$|Borscht, {{like any}} other soup in East Slavic cuisines, is seldom eaten by itself, but rather {{accompanied}} by a side dish. At a minimum, spoonfuls of borscht are alternated with bites of <b>a</b> <b>slice</b> of bread. Buckwheat groats or boiled potatoes, often topped with pork cracklings, are other simple possibilities, but a range of more involved sides exists as well.|$|E
5|$|For presentation, one {{suggestion}} is that the pilchards be arranged with their tails toward {{the centre of the}} pie and their heads poking up through the crust around the edge. As it includes potatoes and pastry, the pie can be served on its own or with crusty bread, sometimes with vegetables. Other suggested accompaniments are Cornish Yarg cheese, rhubarb chutney, poached eggs or <b>a</b> <b>slice</b> of lemon.|$|E

5|$|The {{episode was}} to have {{concluded}} with Homer eating a pizza in his hospital bed following the operation, and with Marge asking a nurse where the pizza had come from. This reflects the earlier flashback scene where Grampa Simpson watches Homer as an infant, chewing on <b>a</b> <b>slice</b> of pizza in the hospital. The scene was replaced with the family cheering Homer on while he is in intensive care.|$|E

Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger was furious in his post-match briefing, criticising Riley for his performance and describing Van Nistelrooy as a cheat. His comments were investigated by the Football Association, who later fined him £15,000 for improper conduct. Van Nistelrooy was retroactively banned for three matches as his challenge on Cole was missed by Riley.|$|E
5|$|Many fungi {{have been}} used as folk {{medicines}} around the world, including in Europe and in India where traditions are well documented. Some have been found to have useful active ingredients, though these do not always correspond with traditional uses of the fungi concerned. Ergot and various cereal smuts, such as Ustilago tritici (wheat grain smut) were used for disorders of pregnancy. Yeasts, made into a boiled paste with wheat flour, were used in India to treat fevers and dysentery. Wounds were treated in Europe with moulds, using for example <b>a</b> <b>slice</b> of mouldy bread or mouldy wheat straw, with active ingredients patulin and other penicillin-like compounds.|$|E

5|$|Our perceptual {{experiences}} {{depend on}} stimuli that arrive at our various sensory organs from the external world, and these stimuli cause {{changes in our}} mental states, ultimately causing us to feel a sensation, which may be pleasant or unpleasant. Someone's desire for <b>a</b> <b>slice</b> of pizza, for example, will tend to cause that person to move his or her body in a specific manner and in a specific direction to obtain {{what he or she}} wants. The question, then, is how it can be possible for conscious experiences to arise out of a lump of gray matter endowed with nothing but electrochemical properties.|$|E
5|$|Python has array {{index and}} array slicing {{expressions}} on lists, denoted as a, a or a. Indexes are zero-based, and negative indexes are {{relative to the}} end. Slices take elements from the start index up to, but not including, the stop index. The third slice parameter, called step or stride, allows elements to be skipped and reversed. Slice indexes may be omitted, for example a returns {{a copy of the}} entire list. Each element of <b>a</b> <b>slice</b> is a shallow copy.|$|E

40|$|Many {{approaches}} to slicing rely upon the `fact' {{that the union}} of two static <b>slices</b> is <b>a</b> valid <b>slice.</b> It is known that static slices constructed using program dependence graph algorithms are valid slices [19]. However, {{this is not true}} for other forms of slicing. For example, it has been established that the union of two dynamic slices is not necessarily <b>a</b> valid dynamic <b>slice</b> [8]. In this paper this result is extended to show that the union of two static slices is not necessarily <b>a</b> valid <b>slice,</b> based on Weiser's definition of <b>a</b> (static) <b>slice.</b> We also analyse the properties that make the union of different forms of <b>slices</b> <b>a</b> valid <b>slice...</b>|$|R
5|$|A fluffernutter {{is made by}} {{spreading}} peanut butter on <b>a</b> <b>slice</b> of bread, then spreading {{an equal amount of}} marshmallow fluff on another slice and finally combining them to form a sandwich. Variations of the recipe include wheat bread instead of white, Nutella hazelnut spread instead of or in addition to peanut butter, and the addition of sweet ingredients like bananas or savory and salty ingredients like bacon. The Fluffernutter itself is often seen as a variation on the peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Though often seen as a food for children, the Fluffernutter recipe has been adapted to appeal to adult tastes. For example, a New York caterer serves a Fluffernutter hors d'oeuvre in a toasted ice cream cone with a spoon of peanut butter and torched marshmallow fluff on top.|$|E
5|$|Developmental stages began for {{the film}} midway through the series' first season {{production}} in January 1998. Co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone signed a deal with Comedy Central in April 1998 that contracted the duo to producing South Park episodes until 1999, gave them <b>a</b> <b>slice</b> of the lucrative spinoff merchandising the show generated within its first year, {{as well as an}} unspecified seven-figure cash bonus to bring the show to the big screen, in theaters. A large part of Parker and Stone's conditions attached to any potential movie project was that it must at least be R-rated, {{to keep in touch with}} the series' humor and its roots, the short The Spirit of Christmas. Parker stated that their desire was to approach the film from a much more creative perspective and do something other than a simple movie-length version of a regular episode. Despite alleged pressure from Paramount Pictures officials to keep the movie toned down, the two won the battle for a more mature rating.|$|E
5|$|McCrane had {{to spend}} hours in makeup {{in order to get}} the right effect and his eyes were colored with {{specially}} made contact lenses. Many of the scenes were physically exerting. The autopsy scene involved McCrane positioning himself through a hole in the table and sitting perfectly still, giving the illusion of a disembodied head. The scene in the bathtub required McCrane to spend several minutes motionless underwater. The shot in which a new Betts emerges from the old one's mouth was created by Toby Lindala. Lindala used shots of McCrane intercut with shots of a puppet with full-functioning mouth and eyes. Laverne Basham and Lindala were later both nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Makeup in a Series. In addition, the machine that created <b>a</b> <b>slice</b> of Betts' head was designed by Ken Hawryliew.|$|E
40|$|We first {{present a}} {{parallel}} algorithm for finding the optimal implementations for the modules of <b>a</b> <b>slicing</b> floorplan that respects <b>a</b> given <b>slicing</b> tree. The algorithm runs in O(n) time and requires O(n) processors, where n {{is the number}} of modules. It is based on a new O(n 2) sequential algorithm for solving the above problem. We then present a parallel algorithm for finding a set of optimal implementations for <b>a</b> <b>slicing</b> floorplan whose corresponding slicing tree has height O(logn). This algorithm runs in O(n) time using O(logn) processors. Our parallel algorithms do not need shared memory and can be implemented in a distributed system...|$|R

30|$|<b>A</b> network <b>slice</b> {{instance}} is <b>a</b> set of (virtualized) network functions implemented at resources which enable running these network functions. It forms complete instantiated logical {{networks that}} meet certain network characteristics (e.g., ultra-low-latency, ultra-reliability, etc.) {{required by the}} Service Instance. <b>A</b> network <b>slice</b> instance could be isolated from another network slice instance in several ways, e.g., full or partial isolation and logical or physical isolation. To create <b>a</b> network <b>slice</b> instance, <b>a</b> network operator uses <b>a</b> Network <b>Slice</b> Blueprint (description of the structure, configuration, and the flows and ways to control the network slice instance during its life cycle). <b>A</b> network <b>slice</b> instance ensures the network characteristics which are needed by a service instance. Therefore, <b>a</b> network <b>slice</b> instance can be shared with multiple service instances provided by the network operator. The network slice instance layer contains many instances of network slices.|$|R
5|$|The {{extensive}} and complex arrangements required {{to support the}} infantry attack from {{the west and the}} mounted attack from the east were completed by 30 October, when these attacking forces moved to positions within a day's march of their deployment. Three divisions of XX Corps were concentrated in position: the 53rd (Welsh) Division at Goz el Geleib, the 60th (London) Division at Esani and the 74th (Yeomanry) Division at Khasif. In preparation for their final approach march, the Civil Service Rifles and the Queen's Westminster Rifles (179th Brigade, 60th Division) were supplied with tea and rum for the following day. In their haversack rations were five onions, a tin of bully beef, <b>a</b> <b>slice</b> of cooked bacon, biscuits and dates.|$|E

However, he discovers Jerktonium, a dangerous chemical element {{which serves as a}} trap for the citizens of Bikini Bottom and is capable of turning anyone into a jerk. He cooks it into fruitcakes that he intends to feed to all the Bikini Bottomites and turn them into jerks. In order to test it, Plankton gives SpongeBob <b>a</b> <b>slice,</b> but nothing seems to work on SpongeBob, who is immune to Jerktonium because of the combination of his small brain and his very big heart. Increasingly infuriated that his plan has seemingly failed completely to suffice, Plankton gives his fruitcake dispenser to SpongeBob, who promptly distributes the fruitcakes to all of Bikini Bottom and transforms all the residents into jerks. After realizing that the element works only on other people in Bikini Bottom instead and that SpongeBob is so full of Christmas spirit that he is immune to jerktonium, Plankton is forced to send out an evil wind-up robot version of SpongeBob to commit troublesome deeds to frame the real SpongeBob.|$|E

40|$|When {{trying to}} {{understand}} certain behaviors of a given program, a programmer’s job can be facilitated {{by the use of}} <b>a</b> <b>slicing</b> tool, which helps focusing attention on the relevant subprogram. After, or even instead of reading <b>a</b> selected program <b>slice,</b> <b>a</b> programmer might be interested in studying its complement, i. e. the rest of the program. But what is that complement? Simply taking all statements outside the slice will not do, as some of the slice’s statements might be relevant too. Instead, one might ask which statements of <b>a</b> given <b>slice</b> can be removed from the original program, assuming the sliced results are already available. The removal of such redundant statements would yield <b>a</b> <b>slice’s</b> complement. This paper introduces the concept of a complement-slice, or simply co-slice, and demonstrates its use in both program comprehension and reuse. Moreover, the paper presents a provably correct co-slicing algorithm for a simple programming language, and outlines a corresponding solution for the general case. 1...|$|R
