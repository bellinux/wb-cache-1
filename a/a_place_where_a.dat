This caused the Devil great pain, and Dunstan only agreed to remove the shoe and release the Devil after he promised never to enter <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>a</b> horseshoe is over the door. This is claimed as the origin of the lucky horseshoe.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the Middle Ages, castles {{tended to}} lose their {{military}} significance due to the advent of powerful cannons and permanent artillery fortifications; as a result, castles became more important as residences and statements of power. A castle could act as a stronghold and prison but was also <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>a</b> knight or lord could entertain his peers. Over time the aesthetics of the design became more important, as the castle's appearance and size began to reflect the prestige and power of its occupant. Comfortable homes were often fashioned within their fortified walls. Although castles still provided protection from low levels of violence in later periods, eventually they were succeeded by country houses as high status residences.|$|E

25|$|Although {{software}} (hyphenation algorithms) {{can often}} automatically {{make decisions on}} when to hyphenate a word at a line break, it is also sometimes useful for the user {{to be able to}} insert cues for those decisions (which are dynamic in the online medium, given that text can be reflowed). For this purpose, the concept of a soft hyphen (discretionary hyphen, optional hyphen) was introduced, allowing such manual specification of <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>a</b> hyphenated break is allowed but not forced. That is, it does not force a line break in an inconvenient place when the text is later reflowed.|$|E
25|$|Traditional Buru {{houses were}} made from bamboo, often on stilts. The roofs were covered with palm leaves or reeds. Cement, metal and tiles were {{introduced}} in the 20th century and urged to build more permanent dwelling, but with limited results, as the locals continued to relocate. This was {{partly due to the}} habits of relocation and partly due to local disputes or superstitions, such as cursing <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>a</b> certain number of people died within a short period. Presence of a church in a village might hindered relocation for a century, but not always. Traditional Buru costumes are similar those of most other Indonesia peoples. Men wear sarong (a kind of kilt) and a long-skirted tunic, and women are dressed in sarong and a shorter jacket. However, the dress color systematically varies between the different tribes of the island.|$|E

500|$|The second {{bridge is}} the Cheboygan Bascule Bridge in Cheboygan. This bascule bridge {{was built in}} 1940 over the Cheboygan River {{as the last of}} its kind before World War II. It was built as a [...] "two-leaf bridge in <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>a</b> {{single-leaf}} bridge probably would have sufficed." [...] The initial construction of the structure was delayed when the contractor died, but it was completed in December 1940. [...] It was the second moveable bridge on the site, replacing an iron swing bridge built in 1877. The structure is [...] long, composed of two [...] spans {{on either side of the}} central [...] span; the roadway is [...] wide with four lanes for vehicle traffic. There are also pedestrian sidewalks on either side of the roadway. When the bridge is opened to allow river traffic to pass, boats have a [...] channel for navigation. The bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 1, 2000, and reconstructed in 2003.|$|E
500|$|The {{decoration}} {{of the book}} {{is not limited to the}} major pages. Scattered through the text are decorated initials and small figures of animals and humans often twisted and tied into complicated knots. Many significant texts, such as the Pater Noster have decorated initials. The page containing text of the Beatitudes in Matthew (...) has a large miniature along the left margin of the page in which the letter B which begins each line is linked into an ornate chain. The genealogy of Christ found in the Gospel of Luke (...) contains a similar miniature in which the word qui is repeatedly linked along the left margin. Many of the small animals scattered throughout the text serve to mark a [...] "turn-in-the-path" [...] (that is, <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>a</b> line is finished in a space above or below the original line). Many other animals serve to fill spaces left at the end of lines. No two of these designs are the same. No earlier surviving manuscript has this massive amount of decoration.|$|E

[...] As for the A$AP Rocky feature on [...] "Brothers," [...] Cudi explained that he made the decision to go with a minimal hook and let the Harlem rapper dominate the track: [...] "I felt like that was a perfect beat for A$AP to get on there and speak some truths and talk to the younger generation, because he's in <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>a</b> lot of kids are up to him and Kendrick.

500|$|Whereas royalty such as King John had had {{a hunting}} lodge at Bromley-by-Bow, and the Bishop of London had a palace at Bethnal Green, later these estates began to be split up, and estates of fine houses for captains, merchants and owners of {{manufacturers}} began to be built. Samuel Pepys moved his family and goods to Bethnal Green during the Great Fire of London, and Captain Cook moved from Shadwell to Stepney Green, <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>a</b> school and assembly rooms had been established (commemorated by Assembly Passage, and a plaque {{on the site of}} Cook's house on the Mile End Road). Mile End Old Town also acquired some fine buildings, and the New Town began to be built. As the area became built up and more crowded, the wealthy sold their plots for sub-division and moved further afield. Into the 18th and 19th centuries, there were still attempts to build fine houses, for example Tredegar Square (1830), and the open fields around Mile End New Town were used for the construction of estates of workers' cottages in 1820. This was designed in 1817 in Birmingham by Anthony Hughes and finally constructed in 1820 ...|$|E

2500|$|The name [...] "Hereford" [...] {{is said to}} {{come from}} the Anglo-Saxon [...] "here", an army or {{formation}} of soldiers, and the [...] "ford", a place for crossing a river.

The Welsh name for Hereford is Henffordd, meaning [...] "old road", and probably refers to the Roman road and Roman settlement at nearby Stretton Sugwas.
