5|$|Published by Joseph Johnson, Mary {{itself was}} {{moderately}} successful, and sections {{of it were}} included in several collections of sentimental extracts that were popular at the time, such <b>as</b> <b>The</b> <b>Young</b> Gentleman and Lady's Instructor (1809).

5|$|As Commander-in-Chief, Rainilaiarivony {{maintained}} {{a distance from}} politics throughout {{the reign of the}} new monarch, RadamaII, instead preferring to focus on his military responsibilities. Meanwhile, disputes between Prime Minister Rainivoninahitriniony and King Radama grew frequent <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> sovereign pursued radical reforms that had begun to foment displeasure among the traditional masses. The situation came to a head on 7 May 1863, when Radama insisted on legalizing duels, despite widespread concern among the king's advisers that the innovation would lead to anarchy. The Prime Minister initiated the arrest of the menamaso, the prince's influential advisers, while Rainilaiarivony enacted his brother's instructions to keep the peace in the capital city. However, the situation deteriorated in dramatic fashion and, by the morning of 12 May, King RadamaII was declared dead, having been strangled on the Prime Minister's orders.|$|E
5|$|In May 1908, five American missionaries—John G. Lake and Thomas Hezmalhalch, {{along with}} their wives, and A. Lehman—arrived in South Africa from Indianapolis. Lake and Hezmalhalch had links to Dowie's Zion City and had been baptized in the Holy Spirit at the Azusa Street Mission in Los Angeles. Despite these influences, however, the missionaries had no {{organizational}} affiliation. Arriving in Pretoria, Lake felt that the Holy Spirit was leading him to Johannesburg because they found no doors open in Pretoria. In Johannesburg, a Mrs Goodenough met them and invited them to stay in her house. She witnessed that the Holy Spirit had sent her {{to the train station}} to meet the American missionaries. They first began ministry at a rental hall in Doornfontein, a Johannesburg suburb, on 25 May 1908. The services consisted of a mixed racial group, and many who attended the first services were Zionists. The missionaries moved to the Central Tabernacle, Bree Street, Johannesburg <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> Pentecostal movement grew. It was there that the Apostolic Faith Mission developed, initially as a committee first meeting in September 1908. It was not registered as a legal entity until 1913, however.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th century, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> {{discipline}} of organic chemistry {{began to grow}} in Europe, scientists attempted to isolate and purify the active components of many medicines, including willow bark. After unsuccessful attempts by Italian chemists Brugnatelli and Fontana in 1826, Joseph Buchner obtained relatively pure salicin crystals in 1828; the following year, Henri Leroux developed another procedure for extracting modest yields of salicin. In 1834, Swiss pharmacist Johann Pagenstecher discovered {{what he thought was}} a new pain-reducing substance, isolated from the common remedy of meadowsweet (Spiraea ulmaria). By 1838, Italian chemist Raffaele Piria found a method of obtaining a more potent acid form of willow extract, which he named salicylic acid. The German chemist who had been working to identify the Spiraea extract, Karl Jacob Löwig, soon realized that it was in fact the same salicylic acid that Piria had found.|$|E

5|$|In {{the twentieth}} century the move away from figurative {{painting}} to impressionism and abstraction, continued the decline of portrait painting. The first significant group of Scottish artists to emerge in {{the twentieth century}} were the four members of the Scottish Colourists in the 1920s. They have been described as the first Scottish modern artists and were the major mechanism by which post-impressionism reached Scotland. Of their number Francis Cadell (1883–1937), emerged as a significant painter of still lives and single figure compositions, particularly with interior backdrops, before moving closer to abstraction. Of the next significant movement, known as The Edinburgh School, Cecile Walton (1891–1956) referenced classical forms, particularly in her ironic self-portrait Romance (1920), which draws on Titian's Venus of Urbino and Manet's Olympia. Her close friend Dorothy Johnstone's portraits, such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> girl in September Sunlight (1916), made use of interior natural light. The work of James Cowie (1886–1956), who painted a number of girls in interior settings, is similar in theme to that of Johnstone, but had a more distant and elegiac feel that can be seen in Falling Leaves (1934), which has been read as a commentary as a commentary on the transition from childhood to adolescence.|$|E
5|$|It {{begins with}} a young girl playing in the {{backyard}} as snow falls on the ground. The scene shifts {{to that of a}} bedside, where a young woman who has died, lies. Her husband covers her with a white sheet as a priest prays. Madonna, wearing a long, black coat, sings the song underneath a snow-covered, dead tree, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> girl plays with her dead mother's jewelry. The husband comes and shouts at the girl, tearing away the woman's pearl necklace which drop at the little girl's feet. The adult Madonna is shown lying beside another man singing the song as the little girl visits her mother's grave. The man gets up and slaps Madonna in the face, as the little girl cries in front of the grave. She is taken away from the graveyard by her father, as interspersed scenes show the girl being kissed by her mother, her trying to reach the knob of a door, and Madonna powdering the bruise mark on her face.|$|E

In Los Angeles, there were the Weirdos, the Zeros, Black Randy and the Metrosquad, the Germs, X, the Dickies, Bags, and the {{relocated}} Tupperwares, now dubbed the Screamers. San Francisco's second wave included the Avengers, Negative Trend, the Mutants, and the Sleepers. the Dils, from Carlsbad, moved between the two major cities. The Wipers formed in Portland, Oregon. In Seattle, there was the Lewd. Often sharing gigs with the Seattle punks were bands from across the Canada–US border. A major scene developed in Vancouver, spearheaded by the Furies and Victoria's all-female Dee Dee and the Dishrags. the Skulls spun off into D.O.A. and the Subhumans. The K-Tels (later known <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Young</b> Canadians) and Pointed Sticks were among the area's other leading punk acts.|$|E
