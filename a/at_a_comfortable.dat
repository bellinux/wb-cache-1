25|$|A {{workbench}} is a table used by woodworkers to hold workpieces {{while they}} are worked by other tools. There are many styles of woodworking benches, each reflecting the type {{of work to be}} done or the craftsman's way of working. Most benches have two features in common: they are heavy and rigid enough to keep still while the wood is being worked, and there is some method for holding the work in place <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>comfortable</b> position and height so that the worker is free to use both hands on the tools. The main thing that distinguishes benches is the way in which the work is held in place. Most benches have more than one way to do this, depending on the operation being performed.|$|E
500|$|The Motion Picture {{met with}} {{negative}} reviews from critics; a 2001 retrospective for the BBC described {{the film as}} a critical failure. As of October 2017, the film holds a 44% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 36 reviews with the consensus stating: [...] "Featuring a patchwork script and a dialogue-heavy storyline whose biggest villain is a cloud, Star Trek: The Motion Picture is a less-than-auspicious debut for the franchise." [...] Gary Arnold and Judith Martin of The Washington Post felt that the plot was too thin to support {{the length of the}} film, although Martin felt that compared to such science-fiction films as , Star Wars and Alien, The Motion Pictures pretense was [...] "slightly cleverer". Times Harold Livingston wrote that the film consisted of spaceships that [...] "take an unconscionable amount of time to get anywhere, and nothing of dramatic or human interest happens along the way". Livingston also lamented the lack of [...] "boldly characterized" [...] antagonists and battle scenes that made Star Wars fun; instead, viewers were presented with lots of talk, [...] "much of it in impenetrable spaceflight jargon". David Denby said that the slow movement of ships through space was [...] "no longer surprising and elegant" [...] after films such as 2001: A Space Odyssey, and that much of the action consisted of the crew's reacting to things occurring on the viewscreen, which the New York Magazine critic considered to be [...] "like watching someone else watch television". Variety disagreed, calling the film [...] "a search-and-destroy thriller that includes all of the ingredients the TV show's fans thrive on: the philosophical dilemma wrapped in a scenario of mind control, troubles with the space ship, the dependable and understanding Kirk, the ever-logical Spock, and suspenseful take with twist ending". Scott Bukatman reviewed Star Trek - The Motion Picture in Ares Magazine #1. [...] Bukatman commented that [...] "With Star Trek, Roddenberry's trick has been to wear the mask of the humanist as he plays with his Erector set. The scale of the television series arrested his vision <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>comfortable</b> and still interesting level, but the new film has finally removed the mask." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{games in}} the Madeline series have a point and click interface, which players use to {{navigate}} {{through a series of}} static screens, interact with characters, and manipulate objects to complete tasks and to overcome obstacles <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>comfortable</b> speed. The gameplay was compared to other edutainment games, such as Big Thinkers, [...] Fisher-Price video games, [...] JumpStart, and [...] Reader Rabbit. The Madeline games revolve around educational minigames in various subjects, including reading comprehension, mathematics, problem-solving, and cultural studies, targeted for children. The games are thorough and informative, yet have an easy to use, straight-forward design. The interface varies {{over the course of the}} series. While Madeline and the Magnificent Puppet Show and Madeline's European Adventures were designed to look and play like interactive storybook adventure games, others such as Madeline Thinking Games were designed as a series of activities within the game. Madeline European Adventures requires players to search across each screen in a first person view, similar to the game Myst.|$|E

The display hardware had occasional glitches, and was removed as of September 13. The hardware and software designs were further developed and refined for better reliability.

When Ponting reached 96, Chaminda Vaas hit Ponting high on his thigh {{and was given}} out leg before wicket. Many members {{of the crowd and}} media argued it was an incorrect decision due to excessive height. He combined with Stuart Law, also playing on debut, for a partnership of 121. This was only the ninth ever century partnership by debutants in Test cricket. [...] "I've got mixed emotions about my knock at the moment. 96 is a good score {{but it would have been}} nice to get a 100", Ponting said after the innings. [...] "Once I struck a few in the middle of the bat, and I spent some time in the middle I tried to relax and enjoy it, just savour the moment." [...] Australia won the match by an innings.
