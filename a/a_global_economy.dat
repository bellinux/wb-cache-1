25|$|World War II precipitated great {{changes in}} the economy of Massachusetts, which in turn led to changes in society. The {{aftermath}} of WWII created <b>a</b> <b>global</b> <b>economy</b> that was focused upon {{the interests of the}} United States, both militarily and in relation to business. The domestic economy in the United States was altered by government procurement policies focused on defense. In the years following WWII, Massachusetts was transformed from a factory-based economy to one based on services and technology. During WWII, the U.S. government had built facilities that they leased, and in the post-war years sold, to defense contractors. Such facilities contributed to an economy focused on creating specialized defense goods. That form of economy prospered {{as a result of the}} Cold War, the Vietnam War, and the Korean War.|$|E

Defenders of the decision have responded that it simply began bringing the U.S. more in line with international arbitration practice, helping American companies compete in <b>a</b> <b>global</b> <b>economy.</b> One, Alan Rau, has also argued that it is justified not just by the Arbitration Act but by general principles of contract law.|$|E

[...] Management teams are responsible for the total performance of the division they oversee with regards to day-to-day operations, delegation of tasks and the supervision of employees. The authority of these teams are based on the members position on the company's or institution's organizational chart. These management teams are constructed of managers from different divisions (e.g. Vice President of Marketing, Assistant Director of Operations). An example of management teams are executive management teams, which consists of members {{at the top of the}} organization's hierarchy, such as Chief Executive Officer, Board of Directors, Board of Trustees, etc., who establish the strategic initiatives that a company will undertake over a long term period (~ 3–5 years).

2500|$|... {{can be said}} {{to focus}} on {{conditions}} of life which became increasingly prevalent in the late 20th century in the most industrialized nations, including the ubiquity of mass media and mass production, the rise of <b>a</b> <b>global</b> <b>economy</b> and a shift from manufacturing to service economies. Jameson and Harvey described it as consumerism, where manufacturing, distribution and dissemination have become exceptionally inexpensive but social connectedness and community have become rarer. Other thinkers assert that postmodernity is the natural reaction to mass broadcasting in a society conditioned to mass production and mass politics. The work of Alasdair MacIntyre informs the versions of postmodernism elaborated by such authors as Murphy (2003) and Bielskis (2005), for whom MacIntyre's postmodern revision of Aristotelianism poses a challenge to the kind of consumerist ideology that now promotes capital accumulation.|$|E
2500|$|Since the Civil Rights Act of 1964, all {{employing}} entities {{and labor}} unions {{have a duty to}} treat employees equally, without discrimination based on [...] "race, color, religion, sex, or national origin." [...] There are separate rules for sex discrimination in pay under the Equal Pay Act of 1963. Additional groups with [...] "protected status" [...] were added by the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. There is no federal law banning all sexual orientation or identity discrimination, but 22 states had passed laws by 2016. These equality laws generally prevent discrimination in hiring, terms of employment, and make discharge because of a protected characteristic unlawful. There is no federal law against unjust discharge, and most states also have no law with full protection against wrongful termination of employment. Collective agreements made by labor unions and some individual contracts require people are only discharged for a [...] "just cause". The Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 requires employing entities give 60 days notice if more than 50 or one third of the workforce may lose their jobs. Federal law has sought to reach full employment through monetary policy and spending on infrastructure. Trade policy has increasingly attempted to put labor rights in international agreements, to ensure open markets in <b>a</b> <b>global</b> <b>economy</b> do not undermine fair and full employment.|$|E
