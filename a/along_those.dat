5|$|Edgar T. Wherry speculated {{at length}} on the hybrid origins of A.bradleyi and other Appalachian spleenworts in 1925, but the scheme he {{proposed}} was later {{found to be}} untenable, although he did recognize the contribution of A.platyneuron to its ancestry. Herb Wagner, in 1953, suggested instead {{that it was the}} hybrid of A.montanum and A.platyneuron, noting that Eaton and W. N. Clute had already made tentative suggestions <b>along</b> <b>those</b> lines. His cytological studies the following year showed that A.bradleyi was an allotetraploid, the product of hybridization between A.montanum and A.platyneuron to form a sterile diploid, followed by chromosome doubling that restored fertility.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, he {{reported}} preliminary cytological {{studies on the}} Aspleniums and suggested that A.montanum had crossed with ebony spleenwort (A.platyneuron) to yield Bradley's spleenwort (A.bradleyi), noting that D. C. Eaton and W. N. Clute had already made tentative suggestions <b>along</b> <b>those</b> lines. He also made chromosome counts of A.×trudellii, which had been classified by some simply as a variety of A.pinnatifidum. As A.pinnatifidum {{proved to be a}} tetraploid while A.montanum was a diploid, a hybrid between them would be a triploid, and Wagner showed that this was in fact the case for A.×trudellii. His further experiments, published the following year, strongly suggested that both A.bradleyi and A.pinnatifidum were allotetraploids, the product of hybridization between A.montanum and another Asplenium to form a sterile diploid, followed by chromosome doubling that restored fertility.|$|E
5|$|On January 19, 1959, {{the library}} moved to its fifth {{location}} and first permanent home, the former Briarcliff Manor station originally on the New York City & Northern Railroad (later the New York and Putnam Railroad). The station {{had been built}} in 1906 by village founder Walter W. Law in the Tudor Revival style, {{as a replacement for}} a smaller station, which was moved to nearby Millwood. In its later operation as a station, the building was rarely used, and only four trains stopped there each day. Due to the railroad's tracks ending in the Bronx and requiring a transfer to continue on to Manhattan, many Briarcliff Manor residents would drive to Pleasantville or Scarborough, which had stations along lines ending in Manhattan, and more trains ran <b>along</b> <b>those</b> lines. The passenger railroad, then known as the Putnam Division of the New York Central Railroad, discontinued service in 1958, freeing up use of the building for the library.|$|E

5|$|The most {{pressing}} foreign policy concerns when Grant took office were resolving the Alabama claims against Great Britain and whether to recognize Cuban belligerency. The {{dispute with the}} United Kingdom stemmed from a complex of grievances centering on attacks on American shipping during the Civil War by the , a Confederate warship constructed in England. Senator Charles Sumner, Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, believed the British had violated American neutrality and demanded reparations. Sumner convinced his fellow Senators to reject the Johnson administration's proposed settlement, believing that Britain should directly pay $2 billion in gold or, alternatively, cede Canada to the United States. Fish and Boutwell convinced Grant that peaceful relations with Britain were more important than acquisition of territory, and the two nations agreed to negotiate <b>along</b> <b>those</b> lines. To avoid jeopardizing negotiations, Grant refrained from recognizing Cuban rebels who were fighting for independence from Spain, {{which would have been}} inconsistent with American objections to the British granting belligerent status to Confederates. A commission in Washington produced a treaty whereby an international tribunal would settle the damage amounts; the British admitted regret, but not fault. The Senate approved the Treaty of Washington, which also settled disputes over fishing rights and maritime boundaries, by a 50–12 vote in 1871.|$|E

25|$|The Choctaw and the Chickasaw in {{alliance}} with the British patrolled the Mississippi and western Tennessee rivers to prevent American incursion <b>along</b> <b>those</b> pathways. The Chickasaw formed part of the garrison of Fort Panmure on the Mississippi and later in Pensacola. Over a thousand Choctaw warriors helped guard the vital ports in West Florida of Pensacola (seat of the province) and Mobile against the Spanish. In contrast, a portion of Choctaw supported the Spanish, though never in direct opposition to other Choctaw, while the rest remained neutral.|$|E
25|$|Winchester was {{a base of}} {{operations}} for several Confederate incursions into the Northern United States, at times threatening the Federal capital city.

For instance, in 1861, Col. Thomas J. Jackson removed 56 locomotives and 386 railroad cars, along with miles of track, from the B Railroad and ultimately closed down the B's main line for ten months.

25|$|Tucker used William Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England as {{the basis}} of his course at the College, but added {{discussion}} on how the Commentaries differed from U.S. law. Tucker also added lectures on principles of U.S. government, and told his students that the laws passed by U.S. legislatures, both state and federal, would be more important in his course than the authorities whose treatises were the traditional resources for learning about the English common law. <b>Along</b> <b>those</b> lines, Tucker's course would discuss how civil law principles had replaced common law ones in U.S. jurisprudence since the Revolution. Tucker's course also discussed other important topics of the day such as the abolition of slavery. Parts of Tucker's lectures showed that states' rights were an important principle to him.|$|E
25|$|When Junot entered Lisbon on 30 November 1807, the Portuguese royal family, {{aristocracy}} {{and high}} clergy had already set sail for Brazil the previous day. The French Army was initially well received by Lisboners, General Junot taking {{up residence in}} the Queluz National Palace (Palácio Nacional de Queluz). and redecorating it. The bourgeoisie of Lisbon discussed the new liberal ideas in conversations with French officers in the cafes of the city, particularly the Nicola in Rossio square, where the French established their headquarters. The people expected {{a continuation of the}} political reforms enacted by the Marquis of Pombal, but Junot did not want to risk stimulating radical ideas and did nothing <b>along</b> <b>those</b> lines. Napoleon proposed that Lisbon should be incorporated directly into the French Empire, while the old Portucale of northern Portugal would be resurrected as the 'Kingdom of Northern Lusitania' in the province of Entre Douro e Minho. Meanwhile, 50,000 Spanish and French troops roamed the countryside arresting, killing, plundering and raping the citizenry.|$|E

25|$|Some strong positives {{that have}} been {{identified}} in studies of military brat populations are a high occurrence of very resilient personalities, exceptional social skills, a high level of multicultural or international awareness, proficiency in foreign languages, and a statistically very strong affinity for careers that entail service to others. Studies show that ex-military kids end up pursuing service-related careers in very high numbers: military service, teaching, counseling, police, nursing and foreign service work being highly represented in military brat career statistics (in comparison to statistics on non-military brat patterns of employment choices). Mary Edwards Wertsch also identified a pattern (for those military brats who do not choose military service) of work that is more independent (self-employment / avoidance of direct subservience to authority figures) and <b>along</b> <b>those</b> lines also favoring creative and artistic professions that offer more independence. She also reported that for those military brats who did choose military service there was a tendency to go through a phase of bucking or testing authority during military service, or a pattern of resenting authority, represented in her study population. However, military brats who become soldiers also tend to do well overall in the profession.|$|E
