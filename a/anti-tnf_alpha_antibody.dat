40|$|Sepsis is {{associated}} with the activation of several inflammatory cascades, including the cytokine network and the coagulation system, {{but it can also be}} associated with an immunodepressed state. This can lead to a situation in which the septic patient becomes more susceptible to secondary infections. In animal experiments, inhibition of the cytokine cascade by administration of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF <b>alpha)</b> -receptors or <b>anti-TNF</b> <b>alpha</b> <b>antibodies</b> has led to reduced mortality, but this has not been confirmed in clinical trials. After the data were pooled, there was a statistically significant decrease in mortality of 3 - 5 %. Treatment with endotoxin antibodies, corticosteroids in high doses, other anti-inflammatory agents and agents designed to eliminate immunodepression generally also did not produce a convincing decrease in mortality. Research on antithrombotic agents has yielded, along with disappointing results with antithrombin III and 'tissue factor pathway inhibitor', one study with a positive result.

40|$|Introduction: Biological. {{therapy has}} {{dramatically}} changed management of Crohn's disease (CD). New data have confirmed the benefit and relative long-term safety of <b>anti-TNF</b> <b>alpha</b> inhibition {{as part of}} a regular scheduled administration programme. The EPACT appropriateness criteria for maintenance treatment after medically-induced remission (MIR) or surgically-induced remission (SIR) of CD thus required updating. Methods: A multidisciplinary international expert panel (EPACT II, Geneva, Switzerland) discussed and anonymously rated detailed, explicit clinical indications based on evidence in the literature and personal expertise. Median ratings (on a 9 -point scale) were stratified into three assessment categories: appropriate (7 - 9), uncertain (4 - 6 and/or disagreement) and inappropriate (1 - 3). Experts ranked appropriate medication according to their own clinical practice, without any consideration of cost. Results: Three hundred and ninety-two specific indications for maintenance treatment of CD were rated (200 for MIR and 192 for SIR). Azathioprine, methotrexate and/or <b>anti-TNF</b> <b>alpha</b> <b>antibodies</b> were considered appropriate in 42 indications, corresponding to 68 % of all appropriate interventions (97 % of MIR and 39 % of SIR). The remaining appropriate interventions consisted of mesalazine and a "wait-and-see" strategy. Factors that influenced the panel's voting were patient characteristics and outcome of previous treatment. Results favour use of <b>anti-TNF</b> <b>alpha</b> agents after failure of any immunosuppressive therapy, while earlier primary use remains controversial. Conclusion: Detailed explicit appropriateness criteria (EPACT) have been updated for maintenance treatment of CD. New expert recommendations for use of the classic immunosuppressors as well as <b>anti-TNF</b> <b>alpha</b> agents are now freely available online (www. epact. ch). The validity of these criteria should now be tested by prospective evaluation. (C) 2009 European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation. Published by Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Tumor {{necrosis}} factor alpha (TNF alpha) is a cytokine {{with many}} biological functions of relevance to inflammatory disease. Although {{only one of}} several inflammatory mediators produced in abundance in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), experimental data suggest that it is in a dominant position within a cytokine hierarchy and is therefore a prime target for directed immunotherapy in this disease. We have targeted TNF alpha in vivo using a chimerised monoclonal <b>anti-TNF</b> <b>alpha</b> <b>antibody</b> and have now demonstrated beneficial responses to treatment in three different clinical trials.

Hence TNF alpha was a potential therapeutic target.

40|$|To {{verify the}} {{hypothesis}} that alveolar macrophages (AMs) from patients infected with HIV- 1 could synthesize and release TNF alpha, AMs recovered from the BAL fluid of 11 patients with seropositive HIV- 1 (six with AIDS and five with ARC) were tested in vitro {{for their ability to}} destroy TNF alpha-susceptible targets. Furthermore, the presence of TNF alpha was assessed in AM-conditioned supernatants {{on the basis of their}} cytotoxic activity and by using an immunoenzymatic test and immunoblotting. Transcription of the TNF alpha gene in AMs was also studied by means of the Northern blot analysis. AMs freshly recovered from patients infected with HIV- 1 exhibited high levels of cell-mediated cytotoxicity against U 937 targets, and the addition of a polyclonal <b>anti-TNF</b> <b>alpha</b> <b>antibody</b> resulted in a significant inhibition of the target lysis. Cell-free supernatants conditioned by unstimulated AMs exerted high levels of cytotoxic activity against TNF alpha-sensitive targets, whereas duplicate, neutralization experiments performed in the presence of an <b>anti-TNF</b> <b>alpha</b> <b>antibody</b> proved that the observed cytotoxic activity was mostly mediated by TNF alpha. The presence of high amounts of TNF alpha in the conditioned media was confirmed by the immunoenzymatic test. In addition, the immunoblot analysis showed that the TNF alpha released by AMs has a Mr 17, 000 band, identical to a standard preparation of recombinant TNF alpha. The Northern blot demonstrated that unstimulated AMs express detectable levels of mRNA transcripts for TNF alpha. Taken together, our data support the concept that AMs from patients with HIV- 1 infection constitutively release TNF alpha...|$|E
40|$|Radiolabelled cytokines and {{monoclonal}} antibodies are {{an emerging}} class of radiopharmaceuticals for imaging inflammation. These radiopharmaceuticals bind to their targets with high affinity and specificity and therefore have excellent diagnostic potential for imaging {{of patients with}} chronic inflammatory diseases. One of the key cytokines {{involved in the process}} of inflammation is tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha). With the introduction of <b>anti-TNF</b> <b>alpha</b> monoclonal <b>antibodies</b> over the past decade, treatment of inflammatory diseases has evolved, which allowed remarkable advances in controlling signs and symptoms of inflammation and in slowing destruction. However, drugs may lose efficacy over time in patients or induce adverse events. Using immediately the right medication tailored to the patient's molecular status avoids unnecessary costs and side effects. Significant differences in mechanisms of action and in therapy outcome, depending on the disease to be treated, exist among the different TNF alpha antagonists. Labelling these agents may help to find out if TNF alpha is present in the inflammatory process and will therefore help in therapy prediction and stratification in the individual patient. This review describes the role of cytokines and in particular of TNF alpha in the process of inflammation as well as the influence of TNF alpha in some well-known and common inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, inflammatory bowel diseases, psoriasis and sarcoidosis.

40|$|Tumor {{necrosis}} factor (TNF alpha), both {{by direct}} action and by trafficking {{cells of the}} immune system, is implicated in cardiopulmonary derangements and PMN-mediated microvascular injury associated with gram-negative sepsis. We {{examined the effects of}} pretreatment with a monoclonal <b>antibody</b> to TNF <b>alpha</b> on PMN function, hemodynamic derangements, and alveolar capillary membrane damage in a septic porcine model. <b>Anti-TNF</b> <b>alpha</b> profoundly improved hemodynamic consequences in this model. Reduction in PMN CD 11 / 18 receptor expression, lung myeloperoxidase activity, and attenuation of peripheral neutropenia (all P < 0. 05) indicate that pretreatment significantly reduced lung sequestration of PMNs seen in septic controls. In contrast, PMN oxygen radical (O 2 -) generation was not significantly different from unprotected septic animals. Despite the presence of circulating PMNs primed for O 2 - burst, alveolar capillary membrane damage, assessed by bronchoalveolar lavage protein content and arterial PO 2 was markedly attenuated in the treatment group (P < 0. 05). We conclude that <b>anti-TNF</b> <b>alpha</b> suppresses systemic hemodynamic actions of TNF alpha. Further, it prevents upregulation of PMN adhesion receptors inhibiting PMN/endothelial cell interaction. This prevents formation of a "microenvironment," protected from circulating oxidant scavengers, into which sepsis-activated PMNs release their toxic products. Pretreatment with <b>anti-TNF</b> <b>alpha</b> monoclonal <b>antibody</b> thus affords global protection in porcine Gram-negative sepsis...|$|R
40|$|Our pre-clinical {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} a pathogenic role for TNF alpha in RA. Firstly, TNF alpha and its receptors are upregulated and co-expressed in the synovium and cartilage-pannus junction of RA joints.

Neutralizing TNF alpha antibodies in vitro reduces the production of these pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL- 1, IL- 8, and GM-CSF. Thirdly, when injected into arthritic DBA/l mice with collagen-induced arthritis, monoclonal anti-TNF antibodies decrease inflammatory damage of joints. Clinical trials employing cA 2, a monoclonal chimeric <b>anti-TNF</b> <b>alpha</b> <b>antibody,</b> in open-label and randomized placebo-controlled {{studies have demonstrated}} a dose-dependent efficacy with impressive improvement in disease activity and acute phase responses lasting several weeks.

40|$|Context: The {{efficacy}} and favorable safety profile of anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) {{agents in the}} treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) are supported by several randomized controlled studies and meta-analyses. However, some concerns on the long-term safety of these drugs still exist, as these studies generally included small patient numbers and were performed in selected patient populations. Objective: This review presents and discusses current evidence on the safety of <b>anti-TNF</b> <b>alpha</b> agents in patients with psoriasis and PsA, with a focus on European registry studies and case reports of particular importance. Methods: Key studies on the safety of <b>anti-TNF</b> <b>alpha</b> agents {{in the treatment of}} adult patients with psoriasis or PsA were identified by a MEDLINE search (last updated 10 November 2011) based on several interrelated queries, with a focus on European registries. Other studies and case reports were included if deemed relevant. Studies concerning other conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), were included as appropriate when data in psoriatic disease were unavailable or insufficient. Results: Available data on the safety of <b>anti-TNF</b> <b>alpha</b> agents such as etanercept in psoriasis and PsA appear reassuring, even if some concerns still exist. Most notably, data suggest a higher incidence of infection and lymphoma amongst patients treated with the <b>anti-TNF</b> <b>alpha</b> monoclonal <b>antibodies</b> infliximab and adalimumab compared with etanercept. Conclusion: The overall safety profile of monoclonal antibodies in patients with psoriasis, PsA and RA seems less favorable than that of etanercept, particularly in terms of risk of infection and hepatotoxicity...|$|R
40|$|Background: Human T {{lymphocytes}} infiltrating tissues in autoimmune {{diseases are}} known to express somatostatin receptors amongst other activation markers. In this study, we evaluated whether somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS) using a radiolabelled somatostatin analogue (Tc- 99 m-EDDA/tricine-HYNIC-tyr(3) -octreotide (Tc- 99 m-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC)) is able to detect the presence of immune-mediated processes in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and secondary Sjogren's syndrome. We also aimed to evaluate whether positivity to SRS was predictive of therapeutic response and if SRS {{could be used for}} monitoring the efficacy of immunomodulatory treatment. Methods: Eighteen patients with rheumatoid arthritis and secondary Sjogren's syndrome not responding to conventional treatment were recruited for treatment with infliximab, a monoclonal antibody against TNF-alpha. All patients had complete blood cell count, renal and liver function tests, measurements of ESR, CRP, ANA, ENA, and anti-dsDNA antibodies, functional salivary gland scintigraphy, labial biopsy, and ophthalmologic assessment with Schirmer's test and tear film break-up time (BUT). Diagnosis was made according to the revised criteria of the American-European Consensus Group. All patients underwent SRS at baseline and after 3 - 6 months of therapy with infliximab. Eleven out of 18 had repeat SRS images. Images of the salivary glands and major joints were acquired 3 h after injection of 370 MBq of 99 mTc-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC. Image analysis was performed semi-quantitatively. Results: All patients showed uptake of Tc- 99 m-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC in the joints. Salivary glands also showed variable radiopharmaceutical uptake in 12 out of 18 patients, but all patients showed presence of lymphocytic infiltration at labial salivary gland biopsy. All patients, who repeated the study after treatment, showed significant reduction of somatostatin uptake in the joints but not in the salivary glands. Conclusions: SRS using Tc- 99 m-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC may be a useful imaging tool to assess disease activity and extent in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and may help to detect secondary Sjogren's syndrome. It may also aid therapy decision-making with <b>anti-TNF</b> <b>alpha</b> <b>antibodies</b> in the joints but not in salivary glands...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Pigmented villonodular {{synovitis}} (PVNS) {{is considered}} to be a neoplastic-like disorder of the synovium histologically characterised by villonodular hyperplasia, resulting in dense fibrosis and haemosiderin deposition. The pathogenesis of the disease is still unknown. CASE REPORT: A patient presented with severe treatment resistant PVNS of the right knee joint. Several conventional treatment regimens, including open surgical synovectomy and intra-articular injections of yttrium- 90 ((90) Y) failed to control the disease. After finding marked tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) expression in arthroscopic synovial tissue samples, treatment with an <b>anti-TNF</b> <b>alpha</b> monoclonal <b>antibody</b> (infliximab) at a dose of 5 mg/kg was started. Additional courses with the same dose given 2, 6, 14, and 20 weeks later, and bimonthly thereafter up to 54 weeks, controlled the signs and symptoms. Immunohistological analysis at follow up identified a marked reduction in macrophage numbers and TNF alpha expression in the synovium. DISCUSSION: This is probably the first case which describes treatment with TNF alpha blockade of PVNS in a patient who is refractory to conventional treatment. It provides the rationale for larger controlled studies to elucidate further the efficacy of TNFalpha blockade treatment in refractory PVNS...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: In Crohn's disease, {{inflammation}} is presumably {{sustained by}} an increased production of proinflammatory cytokines, in particular tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) and interleukin 1 beta (IL 1 beta). TNF alpha can induce {{a host of}} cellular effector events resulting in perpetuation of the inflammatory process. In vivo studies with <b>anti-TNF</b> <b>alpha</b> <b>antibody</b> treatment have led to impressive clinical results. AIMS: To investigate whether treatment with the TNF alpha inhibitor oxpentifylline results in clinical improvement in corticosteroid dependent chronic active Crohn's disease. METHODS: Sixteen Crohn's disease patients received oxpentifylline 400 mg {{four times a day}} in a four week open label study. RESULTS: Blockade of TNF alpha production in 16 patients with corticosteroid dependent Crohn's disease did not improve the clinical disease activity (CDAI mean (SEM) 188. 75 (5. 65) versus 185. 13 (10. 87) or the endoscopic degree of inflammation (CDEIS 14. 9 (2. 87) versus 14. 8 (2. 27) or laboratory parameters. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, use of the TNF alpha inhibitor oxpentifylline does not improve inflammation in Crohn's disease.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess whether}} {{monoclonal}} antibody to tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) reduces endothelial activation in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: Levels of serum E-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM- 1), and vascular {{cell adhesion molecule}} 1 (VCAM- 1), and circulating leukocytes (differential counts) were measured in RA patients before and up to 4 weeks after infusion of either placebo or chimeric <b>anti-TNF</b> <b>alpha</b> <b>antibody</b> cA 2 (1 or 10 mg/kg). RESULTS: Treatment with anti-TNF alpha decreased serum E-selectin and ICAM- 1 levels, with the earliest detectable changes observed on days 1 - 3 after anti-TNF alpha infusion. No effect on VCAM- 1 levels was detected. In parallel, there was a rapid and sustained increase in circulating lymphocytes. The extent of the decrease in serum E-selectin and ICAM- 1 levels {{and the increase in}} lymphocyte counts was significantly higher (P or = 20 % response, by Paulus criteria, at week 4) compared with that in patients who failed to respond to anti-TNF alpha at this time point. CONCLUSION: We propose that decreased serum levels of adhesion molecules may reflect diminished activation of endothelial cells in the synovial microvasculature, leading to reduced migration of leukocytes into synovial joints, and thus prolonging the therapeutic effect of anti-TNF alpha in RA...|$|E
40|$|To {{define the}} mechanism(s) {{responsible}} for the negative inotropic effects of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) in the adult heart, we examined the functional effects of TNF alpha in the intact left ventricle and the isolated adult cardiac myocyte. Studies in both the ventricle and the isolated adult cardiac myocyte showed that TNF alpha exerted a concentration- and time-dependent negative inotropic effect that was fully reversible upon removal of this cytokine. Further, treatment with a neutralizing <b>anti-TNF</b> <b>alpha</b> <b>antibody</b> prevented the negative inotropic effects of TNF alpha in isolated myocytes. A cellular basis for the above findings was provided by studies which showed that treatment with TNF alpha resulted in decreased levels of peak intracellular calcium during the systolic contraction sequence; moreover, these findings {{did not appear to}} be secondary to alterations in the electrophysiological properties of the cardiac myocyte. Further studies showed that increased levels of nitric oxide, de novo protein synthesis, and metabolites of the arachidonic acid pathway were unlikely to be {{responsible for the}} TNF alpha-induced abnormalities in contractile function. Thus, these studies constitute the initial demonstration that the negative inotropic effects of TNF alpha are the direct result of alterations in intracellular calcium homeostasis in the adult cardiac myocyte...|$|E

In this study, the encapsulation of an antibody into polylactide-co-glycolide (PLGA) based microspheres was explored to obtain a controlled-release of the incorporated drug. In order to avoid stability issues, a solid-in-oil-in-water (s/o/w) method was preferred. The solid phase was made of <b>anti-TNF</b> <b>alpha</b> monoclonal <b>antibody</b> (MAb) spray-dried microparticles, and the PLGA microspheres were produced using two different polymers (i. e. Resomer® RG 505 and Resomer® RG 755 S). The stability of the MAb incorporated into the microspheres was investigated under three conditions (5 ± 3 °C, 25 ± 2 °C/ 60 % RH and 40 ± 2 °C/ 75 % RH) for 12 weeks. During this stability study, it was demonstrated that the MAb loaded PLGA microspheres were stable when stored at 5 ± 3 °C and that the Resomer® RG 755 S, composed of 75 % (w/w) lactic acid as PLGA, was preferred to preserve the stability of the system. Storage at temperatures higher than 5 °C led to antibody stability issues such as aggregation, fragmentation and loss of activity. The release profiles were also altered. Physical ageing of the system associated with changes in the glass transition temperature and enthalpy of relaxation was noticed during the storage of the MAb loaded PLGA microspheres. © 2014 Elsevier B.

Serious infections are the result of the patients' immunocompromised status that is caused by the primary disease itself, as well as by previous immunosuppressive therapy. In order to decrease the risk of developing TB, prior to the introduction of the <b>anti-TNF</b> <b>alpha</b> therapy, all patients should undergo screening for TB. Experiences from the countries that have already implemented recommendations for TB screening show a significant decrease in TB occurrence in the <b>anti-TNF</b> <b>alpha</b> treated patients.

40|$|Human macrophages, {{differentiated}} {{in vitro}} from blood monocytes, can be induced to secrete tumouricidal activity when activated by combined treatment with recombinant interferon gamma and bacterial lipopolysaccharide. We have analysed conditioned culture supernatants of activated human monocytes and in vitro differentiated macrophages cultivated under serum-free conditions for cytolytic activity against a TNF alpha-insensitive human tumour cell line and characterized this activity {{with respect to}} its relationship to TNF alpha and reactive nitrogen intermediates. Cytolytic activity was recovered in the high molecular weight fraction of culture supernatants conditioned by terminally differentiated macrophages, whereas conditioned culture supernatants of freshly isolated blood monocytes, processed under identical conditions, were devoid of significant cytolytic activity. This activity was tumour-specific, strongly affecting the human lymphoma cell line JMP, whereas freshly isolated human peripheral blood lymphocytes were not affected to a significant extent. It was inactivated by heat or trypsin treatment, but only partially inhibited by a monoclonal antibody against recombinant human TNF alpha, which completely neutralized all of the TNF alpha activity detectable in the supernatants tested. Cytolytic activity could not be reduced further even by a 1000 -fold excess of <b>anti-TNF</b> <b>alpha</b> <b>antibody,</b> suggesting that TNF alpha has some synergistic effect on the tumouricidal activity observed, rather than being the central effector molecule.

40|$|Analysis of {{cytokine}} mRNA {{and protein}} in rheumatoid arthritis tissue revealed that many proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF alpha, IL- 1, IL- 6, GM-CSF, and chemokines such as IL- 8 are abundant in all patients regardless of therapy. This is compensated {{to some degree}} by the increased production of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL- 10 and TGF beta and cytokine inhibitors such as IL- 1 ra and soluble TNF-R. However, this upregulation in homeostatic regulatory mechanisms is not sufficient as these are unable to neutralize all the TNF alpha and IL- 1 produced. In rheumatoid joint cell cultures that spontaneously produce IL- 1, TNF alpha was the major dominant regulator of IL- 1. Subsequently, other proinflammatory cytokines were also inhibited if TNF alpha was neutralized, leading to the new concept that the proinflammatory cytokines were linked in a network with TNF alpha at its apex. This led to the hypothesis that TNF alpha was of major importance in rheumatoid arthritis and was a therapeutic target. This hypothesis has been successfully tested in animal models, of, for example, collagen-induced arthritis, and these studies have provided the rationale for clinical trials of anti-TNF alpha therapy in patients with long-standing rheumatoid arthritis. Several clinical trials using a chimeric <b>anti-TNF</b> <b>alpha</b> <b>antibody</b> have shown marked clinical benefit, verifying the hypothesis that TNF alpha is of major importance in rheumatoid arthritis.

40|$|Tumor {{necrosis}} factor (TNF) is a pleiotropic cytokine {{which has}} both cytotoxic and proliferative effects. HuT 78, a T-cell line {{derived from a}} Sezary lymphoma, is resistant to the cytotoxic effects of TNF, suggesting that TNF may be a growth factor for this cell line. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine whether autocrine TNF production could function as a growth factor for HuT 78. Resting HuT 78 and K- 4 cells, a protein kinase C-beta-deficient clone of HuT 78, both produced significant amounts of TNF compared with Jurkat cells. Thymidine incorporation by HuT 78 and K- 4 cells was inhibited by 90. 5 and 73. 2 %, respectively, with addition of a neutralizing monoclonal antibody to TNF alpha, suggesting that TNF is an autocrine growth factor for these cells. HuT 78 and K- 4 cells also expressed high levels of constitutively active NF kappa B, unlike Jurkat cells, which expressed high levels only upon activation with TNF or phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate. p 50 was the major component in the NF kappa B complexes in HuT 78 and K- 4 cells. <b>Anti-TNF</b> <b>alpha</b> <b>antibody</b> dramatically decreased levels of NF kappa B in both HuT 78 and K- 4 cells.

Our aim here was to describe the clinical course of CVA in these patients. METHODS: This was a European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation [ECCO] retrospective observational study, performed {{as part of the}} CONFER [COllaborative Network For Exceptionally Rare case reports] project. A call to all ECCO members was made to report on IBD patients afflicted with CVA during treatment with <b>anti-TNF</b> <b>alpha</b> agents. Clinical data were recorded in a standardised case report form and analysed for event association with <b>anti-TNF</b> <b>alpha</b> treatment. RESULTS: A total of 19 patients were identified from 16 centres: 14 had Crohn's disease, four ulcerative colitis and one IBD colitis unclassified [median age at diagnosis: 38. 0 years, range: 18. 6 - 62. 5]. Patients received <b>anti-TNF</b> <b>alpha</b> for a median duration of 11. 8 months [range: 0 - 62] at CVA onset; seven had previously been treated with at least one other <b>anti-TNF</b> <b>alpha</b> agent. Complete neurological recovery was observed in 16 patients. <b>Anti-TNF</b> <b>alpha</b> was discontinued in 16 / 19 patients. However, recurrent CVA or neurological deterioration was not observed in any of the 11 patients who received <b>anti-TNF</b> <b>alpha</b> after CVA [eight resumed after temporary cessation, three continued without interruption] for a median follow-up of 39. 8 months [range: 5. 6 - 98. 2]. CONCLUSION: These preliminary findings do not unequivocally indicate a causal role of <b>anti-TNF</b> <b>alpha</b> in CVA complicating IBD. Resuming or continuing <b>anti-TNF</b> <b>alpha</b> in IBD patients with CVA may be feasible and safe in selected cases, but careful weighing of IBD activity versus neurological status is prudent...|$|R
40|$|Background & Aims. Considering {{the ability}} of <b>anti-TNF</b> <b>alpha</b> drugs to lower the burden {{intestinal}} inflammation in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and the similarity between IBD and ankylosing spondylitis (AS) regarding inflammatory intestinal involvement, we aimed to investigate the impact of <b>anti-TNF</b> <b>alpha</b> biologic therapy on subclinical intestinal inflammation in AS patients...|$|R
40|$|Tumor {{necrosis}} factor alpha (TNF-alpha) antagonists {{have emerged}} as an effective therapy for patients with diseases as Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and other chronic systemic inflammatory diseases. In the last years, {{there has been a}} growing interest in the role that inflammatory cytokines, which sustain the pathogenesis of these diseases, plays in regulating cardiac structure and function, particularly in the progression of chronic heart failure. In fact there is an increase of <b>anti-TNF</b> <b>alpha</b> levels in advanced heart failure but the treatment with <b>anti-TNF</b> <b>alpha</b> has been shown to worsen the prognosis of heart failure in randomized controlled trials. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis have an increased risk for cardiovascular disease and <b>anti-TNF</b> <b>alpha</b> therapy seems to be beneficial on the risk of cardiovascular disease. In Crohn's disease the increased risk of cardiovascular disease is controversial and therefore it is impossible to demonstrate an effect in reduction of the risk; however, heart failure in patients treated with <b>anti-TNF</b> <b>alpha,</b> despite in a small proportion, has been observed. On the basis of this observation, <b>anti-TNF</b> <b>alpha</b> therapy is contraindicated in patients with Crohn's disease and III-IV New York Heart Association heart failure class...|$|R
40|$|Rheumatoid {{arthritis}} (RA), {{a systemic}} disease, {{is characterized by}} a chronic inflammatory reaction in the synovium of joints and is associated with degeneration of cartilage and erosion of juxta-articular bone. Many pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF alpha, chemokines, and growth factors are expressed in diseased joints. The rationale that TNF alpha {{played a central role in}} regulating these molecules, and their pathophysiological potential, was initially provided by the demonstration that anti-TNF alpha antibodies added to in vitro cultures of a representative population of cells derived from diseased joints inhibited the spontaneous production of IL- 1 and other pro-inflammatory cytokines. Systemic administration of <b>anti-TNF</b> <b>alpha</b> <b>antibody</b> or sTNFR fusion protein to mouse models of RA was shown to be anti-inflammatory and joint protective. Clinical investigations in which the activity of TNF alpha in RA patients was blocked with intravenously administered infliximab, a chimeric anti-TNF alpha monoclonal antibody (mAB), has provided evidence that TNF regulates IL- 6, IL- 8, MCP- 1, and VEGF production, recruitment of immune and inflammatory cells into joints, angiogenesis, and reduction of blood levels of matrix metalloproteinases- 1 and - 3. Randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-center clinical trials of human TNF alpha inhibitors have demonstrated their consistent and remarkable efficacy in controlling signs and symptoms, with a favorable safety profile, in approximately two thirds of patients for up to 2 years, and their ability to retard joint damage. Infliximab (a mAB), and etanercept (a sTNF-R-Fc fusion protein) have been approved by regulatory authorities in the United States and Europe for treating RA, and they represent a significant new addition to available therapeutic options...|$|E
40|$|Objectives Interleukin 33 (IL- 33) is a {{new member}} of the IL- 1 family of cytokines which signals via its receptor, ST 2 (IL- 33 R), and has an {{important}} role in Th 2 and mast cell responses. This study shows that IL- 33 orchestrates neutrophil migration in arthritis. Methods and results Methylated bovine serum albumin (mBSA) challenge in the knee joint of mBSA-immunised mice induced local neutrophil migration accompanied by increased IL- 33 R and IL- 33 mRNA expression. Cell migration was inhibited by systemic and local treatments with soluble (s) IL- 33 R, an IL- 33 decoy receptor, and was not evident in IL- 33 R-deficient mice. IL- 33 injection also induced IL- 33 R-dependent neutrophil migration. Antigen- and IL- 33 -induced neutrophil migration in the joint was dependent on CXCL 1, CCL 3, tumour necrosis factor a (TNF alpha) and IL- 1 beta synthesis. Synovial tissue, macrophages and activated neutrophils expressed IL- 33 R. IL- 33 induces neutrophil migration by activating macrophages to produce chemokines and cytokines and by directly acting on neutrophils. Importantly, neutrophils from patients with rheumatoid arthritis successfully treated with <b>anti-TNF</b> <b>alpha</b> <b>antibody</b> (infliximab) expressed significantly lower levels of IL- 33 R than patients treated with methotrexate alone. Only neutrophils from patients treated with methotrexate alone or from normal donors stimulated with TNF alpha responded to IL- 33 in chemotaxis. Conclusions These results suggest that suppression of IL- 33 R expression in neutrophils, preventing IL- 33 -induced neutrophil migration, may be an important mechanism of anti-TNF alpha therapy of inflammation.

40|$|We have {{previously}} {{hypothesized that the}} pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF alpha has {{a pivotal role in}} the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). It mediates its effects by cross-linking surface p 55 TNF receptors (TNF-R), which can be proteolytically cleaved to yield soluble fragments. Upon binding TNF alpha soluble TNF-R (sTNF-R) can inhibit its function. We investigated the enzymatic nature of the proteases involved in TNF-R cleavage, and found that this process is blocked by a synthetic inhibitor of matrix metallo-proteinase activity (MMP), BB- 2275. Inhibition of TNF-R cleavage was observed {{in a number of different}} cell types, as detected by retention of surface bound TNF receptor and by less sTNF-R released into the cell supernatant. The augmentation of surface TNF-R expression was of biological relevance as TNF alpha-mediated necrosis of human KYM. 1 D 4 rhabdosarcoma cells was enhanced approximately 15 -fold in the presence of BB- 2275. The addition of BB- 2275 to rheumatoid synovial membrane cell cultures totally inhibited MMP activity and also significantly reduced the levels of soluble TNF alpha (P < 0. 006), p 55 sTNF-R (P < 0. 006), and p 75 sTNF-R (P < 0. 004). Paradoxically, despite the reduction in soluble TNF alpha levels, the production of IL- 1 beta, IL- 6, and IL- 8, cytokines whose production was previously demonstrated to be inhibited by the addition of neutralizing <b>anti-TNF</b> <b>alpha</b> <b>antibody</b> were not down-regulated by BB- 2275. These results raise the interesting possibility that a close relationship exits between the enzyme(s) which process membrane-bound TNF alpha, and those involved in surface TNF-R cleavage. Furthermore our observations suggest that hydroxamate inhibitors of MMP activity which block TNF alpha secretion and TNF-R cleavage may not modulate down-stream effects of TNA alpha, and as such suggest that the precise specificity of these compounds will be highly relevant to their clinical efficacy in inflammatory diseases...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{effect of}} {{chimeric}} anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF <b>alpha)</b> monoclonal <b>antibody</b> (MAb) therapy on synovial inflammation was studied {{in order to}} address the hypothesis that <b>anti-TNF</b> <b>alpha</b> therapy leads to down-regulation of adhesion molecules and a decrease in inflammatory cell influx in synovial tissue (ST). METHODS: The immunohistologic features of synovial biopsy specimens, both before and 4 weeks after <b>anti-TNF</b> <b>alpha</b> MAb (cA 2) therapy, were studied in 14 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The patients either received a placebo (n = 2), or were given intravenous doses of cA 2 at 10 mg/kg (n = 5) or 20 mg/kg (n = 7). RESULTS: A significant (P < 0. 03) reduction in the mean scores for T cells and for the adhesion molecules, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 and E-selectin, was observed after therapy with 10 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg of cA 2 in RA patients. CONCLUSION: The reduced expression of adhesion molecules, and the decrease in cellularity of rheumatoid ST after cA 2 administration support the hypothesis that the antiinflammatory effect of <b>anti-TNF</b> <b>alpha</b> therapy might be partly explained by down-regulation of cytokine-inducible vascular adhesion molecules in ST, with a consequent reduction of cell traffic into joints...|$|R
40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} the kinetics of hepatitis B virus (HBV) viral loads and HBV reactivation in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients undergoing therapy with tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) inhibitors. Methods The authors investigated the virological, serological and biochemical evidence of HBV reactivation in 88 RA patients receiving <b>anti-TNF</b> <b>alpha</b> therapy. Levels of HBV surface (HBs) antigen (Ag), anti-HBV core (HBc) -IgG and anti-HBs antibody (Ab) were detected by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay, and viral loads {{were determined by}} real-time PCR assay. Results In a total of 88 HBcAb-positive patients, 18 (20. 5 %) patients were HBsAg-positive, 12 (13. 6 %) patients were HBsAg-negative/HBsAb-negative and 58 (65. 9 %) patients were HBsAg-negative/HBsAb-positive before starting <b>anti-TNF</b> <b>alpha</b> therapy. Among HBsAg-positive patients receiving <b>anti-TNF</b> <b>alpha</b> therapy, HBV reactivation was documented in none of 10 patients who received lamivudine pre-emptive therapy and serum viral loads significantly decreased (mean +/- SEM, 153 860 +/- 80 120 IU/ml at baseline vs 313 +/- 235 IU/ml after 12 months antiviral therapy, p< 0. 001), paralleling the decrease in serum aminotransferase levels. In contrast, five (62. 5 %) of eight patients without antiviral prophylaxis developed HBV reactivation, viral loads significantly increased after <b>anti-TNF</b> <b>alpha</b> therapy (9375 +/- 5924 IU/ml vs 49 710 000 +/- 40 535 000 IU/ml, p< 0. 001), and markedly declined after antiviral therapy (49 710 000 +/- 40 535 000 IU/ml vs 6382 +/- 2424 IU/ml, p< 0. 001). Baseline viral loads were detectable in four (33. 3 %) of 12 patients who had HBsAg-negative/HBsAb-negative status, and one developed HBV reactivation after <b>anti-TNF</b> <b>alpha</b> therapy. Conclusion HBV reactivation can occur in both HBsAg-positive and HBsAg-negative/HBcAb-positive patients with detectable HBV DNA, so-called occult HBV infection, during <b>anti-TNF</b> <b>alpha</b> therapy. Antiviral prophylaxis may effectively reduce HBV reactivation in HBsAg-positive RA patients undergoing <b>anti-TNF</b> <b>alpha</b> therapy...|$|R
40|$|Objectives The risk {{of active}} {{tuberculosis}} increases in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients receiving antitumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) therapy. Longitudinal data concerning serial interferon gamma (IFN gamma) assays for detecting tuberculosis have been limited. This {{study investigated the}} time course of the development of active tuberculosis, and evaluated the utility of serial QuantiFERON-TB Gold (QFT-G) assays for detecting its emergence in RA patients undergoing long-term <b>anti-TNF</b> <b>alpha</b> therapy. Methods 242 RA patients who received <b>anti-TNF</b> <b>alpha</b> therapy and serial QFT-G assays were prospectively evaluated. QFT-G was performed by measuring IFN gamma levels in whole blood treated with tuberculosis-specific antigens. Results Among 242 RA patients, 75 (31. 0 %) had a positive tuberculin skin test (TST) and 45 (18. 6 %) had positive QFT-G results, with another nine (3. 7 %) showing indeterminate QFT-G assay. Isoniazid prophylaxis was given to 37 patients with TST+/QFT-G+ results and 24 TST+/QFT-G- patients with TST induration diameter >= 10 mm. Four patients (three with baseline QFT-G+ results) developed tuberculosis within the first 3 months of <b>anti-TNF</b> <b>alpha</b> therapy, whereas five patients with baseline TST-/QFT-G- results developed active tuberculosis after 20 - 24 months' <b>anti-TNF</b> <b>alpha</b> therapy. Progressively rising levels of released IFN gamma (2. 17 +/- 0. 98 vs 5. 93 +/- 2. 92 IU/ml in early secretory antigenic target- 6 -stimulated well; 1. 12 +/- 0. 84 vs 2. 96 +/- 1. 02 IU/ml in culture filtrate protein- 10 -stimulated well) were observed in those who developed tuberculosis early in <b>anti-TNF</b> <b>alpha</b> therapy. QFT-G conversion was found in baseline QFT-G-negative patients who developed tuberculosis late in treatment. Conclusion The emergence of active tuberculosis follows a biphasic pattern. Persistently high levels of released IFN gamma or QFT-G conversion strongly indicate the development of active tuberculosis in patients undergoing long-term <b>anti-TNF</b> <b>alpha</b> therapy...|$|R
