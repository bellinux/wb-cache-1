50|$|Btrieve {{allows for}} {{duplicate}} key values in an index. Btrieve handles duplicate keys using either a linked duplicate method, or {{by using a}} repeating duplicate method (this terminology started being used when version 6.0 was released). The linked duplicate method used a pair <b>of</b> <b>record</b> pointers in the index page itself {{to point to the}} head and tail of a doubly linked list of duplicate keys. This meant that the order of the duplicate keys in the list was in the order they were entered. The duplicate key method did not use a linked list, but rather made all the keys unique by creating a new index key and appending the <b>address</b> <b>of</b> the <b>record</b> pointer {{to the end of the}} key. This means that the key is retrieved via its position order.|$|R
50|$|Records have {{identity}}, {{the identity}} being {{represented by a}} value known as a database key. In IDMS, as in most other Codasyl implementations, the database key {{is directly related to}} the physical <b>address</b> <b>of</b> the <b>record</b> on disk. Database keys are also used as pointers to implement sets in the form of linked lists and trees. This close correspondence between the logical model and the physical implementation (which is not a strictly necessary part of the Codasyl model, but was a characteristic of all successful implementations) is responsible for the efficiency of database retrieval, but also makes operations such as database loading and restructuring rather expensive.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Objective: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the consistency <b>of</b> death <b>records</b> <b>of</b> Izmir Metropolitan Municipality Directorate of Cemeteries and Izmir Provincial Health Directorate in 2010 and to provide a quantitative estimate of deaths that occurred in Izmir in 2010 through capture-recapture method. Methods: In this descriptive study, we examined whole death <b>records</b> <b>of</b> Izmir Provincial Health Directorate and Izmir Metropolitan Municipality Directorate of Cemeteries in 2010. The <b>records</b> <b>of</b> both institutions were matched exactly to evaluate the consistency <b>of</b> reporting. Missing <b>records</b> which were registered by only Directorate of Cemeteries, but not registered by Provincial Health Directorate were added the database of Provincial Health Directorate. The two source capture-recapture method implemented based on the <b>records</b> <b>of</b> two institutions. The number of deaths by age group and gender and level of completeness of Provincial Health Directorate records were calculated through this method. The observed and calculated numbers of death and summary mortality of measures of Provincial Health Directorate were compared with database of Turkish Statistical Institute (TURKSTAT). Results: 8. 9 % of deaths which registered at the Directorate of Cemeteries were missing at Provincial Health Directorate. Missing notifications showed concentration in the younger age groups, mainly stillbirths (98. 6 %) and infant deaths (46. 9 %). Decedents’ residence <b>addresses</b> <b>of</b> <b>records</b> which matched both instuitions were inconsistent. The level of completeness of Provincial Health Directorate records were 88. 6 % for male and 89. 3 % for female according to calculations using capture-recapture method. Calculated infant mortality rate and under five mortality rate were higher than the rates <b>of</b> observed <b>records</b> <b>of</b> Provincial Health Directorate and the TURKSAT data. Conclusions: This study indicates that the death records are insufficient in terms of reliability. Control mechanisms which provided in the system are required to be operated more efficiently to ensure coordination among the institutions and to execute complete and timely notifications. Key Words: Death statistics, burial records, consistency, completeness. </p...|$|R
