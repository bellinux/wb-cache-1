5|$|Natural {{selection}} {{within a}} population for a trait that can vary across {{a range of}} values, such as height, can be categorised into three different types. The first is directional selection, which is a shift in the <b>average</b> <b>value</b> of a trait over time—for example, organisms slowly getting taller. Secondly, disruptive selection is selection for extreme trait values and often results in two different values becoming most common, with selection against the <b>average</b> <b>value.</b> This would be when either short or tall organisms had an advantage, but not those of medium height. Finally, in stabilising selection there is selection against extreme trait values on both ends, which causes a decrease in variance around the <b>average</b> <b>value</b> and less diversity. This would, for example, cause organisms to slowly become all the same height.|$|E

From the measured data were selected <b>average</b> <b>values</b> of body height, body weight, the circumference of waist and hips and these values were compared with the <b>average</b> <b>values</b> of the previous research. The selected values of body composition were obtained thanks to Bodystat device. The <b>average</b> <b>values</b> of forced vital capacity were obtained thanks to spirometer device and the <b>average</b> <b>values</b> of Ruffierova's test were selected as well. The results of motor tests were also compared with the previous research. All obtained values are summarized in tables and graphs...|$|R

5|$|As noted above, the Moon's orbit is also elliptical. The Moon's {{distance}} from the Earth can vary by about 6% from its <b>average</b> <b>value.</b> Therefore, the Moon's apparent size varies with its {{distance from}} the Earth, {{and it is this}} effect that leads to the difference between total and annular eclipses. The distance of the Earth from the Sun also varies during the year, but this is a smaller effect. On average, the Moon appears to be slightly smaller than the Sun as seen from the Earth, so the majority (about 60%) of central eclipses are annular. It is only when the Moon is closer to the Earth than average (near its perigee) that a total eclipse occurs.|$|E
5|$|In 1859 {{a further}} {{edition of the}} Statutes was issued; the changes related mainly to the costs {{associated}} with the Order. Prior to this date it had been the policy that the insignia (which were provided by the Crown) were to be returned on the death of the holder; the exception had been foreigners who had been awarded honorary membership. In addition foreigners had usually been provided with stars made of silver and diamonds, whereas ordinary members had only embroidered stars. The decision was made to award silver stars to all members, and only require the return of the Collar. The Crown had also been paying the fees due to the officers of the Order for members who had been appointed for the services in the recent war. The fees were abolished and replaced with a salary of approximately the same <b>average</b> <b>value.</b> The offices of Genealogist and Messenger were abolished, and those of Registrar and Secretary combined.|$|E
