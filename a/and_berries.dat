5|$|Red pandas are {{excellent}} climbers, and forage largely in trees. They eat mostly bamboo, and may eat small mammals, birds, eggs, flowers, <b>and</b> <b>berries.</b> In captivity, they were observed to eat birds, flowers, maple and mulberry leaves, and bark and fruits of maple, beech, and mulberry.|$|E
5|$|The common {{blackbird}} is omnivorous, {{eating a}} wide range of insects, earthworms, seeds <b>and</b> <b>berries.</b> It feeds mainly on the ground, running and hopping with a start-stop-start progress. It pulls earthworms from the soil, usually finding them by sight, but sometimes by hearing, and roots through leaf litter for other invertebrates. Small amphibians and lizards are occasionally hunted. This species will also perch in bushes to take berries and collect caterpillars and other active insects. Animal prey predominates, and is particularly important during the breeding season, with windfall apples <b>and</b> <b>berries</b> taken more in the autumn and winter. The nature of the fruit taken depends on what is locally available, and frequently includes exotics in gardens.|$|E
5|$|The {{song thrush}} is omnivorous, eating {{a wide range}} of invertebrates, {{especially}} earthworms and snails, as well as soft fruit <b>and</b> <b>berries.</b> Like its relative, the blackbird, the song thrush finds animal prey by sight, has a run-and-stop hunting technique on open ground, and will rummage through leaf-litter seeking potential food items.|$|E

5|$|The {{waxwings}} are a {{group of}} birds with soft silky plumage and unique red tips {{to some of the}} wing feathers. In the Bohemian and cedar waxwings, these tips look like sealing wax and give the group its name. These are arboreal birds of northern forests. They live on insects in summer <b>and</b> <b>berries</b> in winter.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the arrival}} of Euro-Americans in the 19thcentury, the John Day basin was frequented by Sahaptin people who hunted, fished, and {{gathered}} roots <b>and</b> <b>berries</b> in the region. After road-building made the valley more accessible, settlers established farms, ranches, and a few small towns along the river and its tributaries. Paleontologists have been unearthing and studying the fossils in the region since 1864, when Thomas Condon, a missionary and amateur geologist, recognized their importance and made them known globally. Parts of the basin became a National Monument in 1975.|$|E
5|$|Cacambo and Candide are {{captured}} by Oreillons, or Orejones; {{members of the}} Inca nobility who widened the lobes of their ears, and are depicted here as the fictional inhabitants of the area. Mistaking Candide for a Jesuit by his robes, the Oreillons prepare to cook Candide and Cacambo; however, Cacambo convinces the Oreillons that Candide killed a Jesuit to procure the robe. Cacambo and Candide are released and travel for a month on foot and then down a river by canoe, living on fruits <b>and</b> <b>berries.</b>|$|E

5|$|Found in open woods, parks, hedges and {{cultivated}} land, the mistle thrush feeds {{on a wide}} variety of invertebrates, seeds <b>and</b> <b>berries.</b> Its preferred fruits including those of the mistletoe, holly and yew. Mistletoe is favoured where it is available, and this is reflected in the thrush's English and scientific names; the plant, a parasitic species, benefits from its seeds being excreted by the thrush onto branches where they can germinate. In winter, a mistle thrush will vigorously defend mistletoe clumps or a holly tree as a food reserve for when times are hard.|$|E
5|$|In Russia, {{blackcurrant}} leaves may be {{used for}} flavouring tea or preserves, such as salted cucumbers, <b>and</b> <b>berries</b> for home winemaking. Sweetened vodka may also be infused with blackcurrant leaves making a deep greenish-yellow beverage with a tart flavour and astringent taste. The berries may be infused in a similar manner. In Britain, 95% of the blackcurrants grown end up in Ribena (a brand of fruit juice whose name is derived from Ribes nigrum) and similar fruit syrups and juices.|$|E
5|$|Most {{bears are}} {{opportunistic}} omnivores and consume more plant than animal matter. They eat anything from leaves, roots, <b>and</b> <b>berries</b> to insects, carrion, fresh meat, and fish, and have digestive systems and teeth adapted {{to such a}} diet. At the extremes are the almost entirely herbivorous giant panda and the mostly carnivorous polar bear. However, all bears feed on any food source that becomes seasonally available. For example, Asiatic black bears in Taiwan consume large numbers of acorns when these are most common, and switch to ungulates at other times of the year.|$|E
50|$|In 2005 {{a further}} species, Tetraxylopteris reposana, was {{described}} by Hammond <b>and</b> <b>Berry.</b> The specific epithet reposana is derived from 'El Reposo', {{the name of the}} hacienda near the fossil locality. Hammond <b>and</b> <b>Berry</b> suggest that Proteokalon Scheckler & Banks (1971) may be synonymous with Tetraxylopteris.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze {{polyphenol}} rich beverages (vitamin enhanced waters (VEWs), fruit juices <b>and</b> <b>berry</b> juices) to determine free polyphenol concentrations and free polyphenols per Calorie based on a serving size. The Folin–Ciocalteu reagent was used in a colorimetric assay based on a catechin standard. Fruit <b>and</b> <b>berry</b> juices contained, on average, more than eight-times the concentration of free polyphenols when compared to VEWs. When Calories per serving were taken into consideration, fruit <b>and</b> <b>berry</b> juices contained more than twice the free polyphenols per Calorie...|$|R
5|$|The American robin {{is active}} mostly during the day, {{and on its}} winter grounds it assembles in large flocks at night to roost in trees in secluded swamps or dense vegetation. The flocks break up during {{the day when the}} birds feed on fruits <b>and</b> <b>berries</b> in smaller groups. During the summer, the American robin defends a {{breeding}} territory and is less social.|$|E
5|$|The chicks are fed worms, insects, <b>and</b> <b>berries.</b> Waste {{accumulation}} {{does not}} occur in the nest because adults collect and take it away. Chicks are fed, and then raise tails for elimination of waste, a solid white clump that is collected by a parent prior to flying off. All chicks in the brood leave the nest within two days of each other. Even after leaving the nest, the juveniles will follow their parents around and beg food from them. Juveniles become capable of sustained flight two weeks after fledging.|$|E
5|$|The {{fieldfare}} (Turdus pilaris) is {{a member}} of the thrush family Turdidae. It breeds in woodland and scrub in northern Europe and Asia. It is strongly migratory, with many northern birds moving south during the winter. It is a very rare breeder in the British Isles, but winters in large numbers in the United Kingdom, Southern Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. It is omnivorous, eating a wide range of molluscs, insects and earthworms in the summer, <b>and</b> <b>berries,</b> grain and seeds in the winter.|$|E

5|$|Carménère wine has a {{deep red}} color and aromas found in red fruits, spices <b>and</b> <b>berries.</b> The tannins are gentler and softer than those in Cabernet Sauvignon {{and it is a}} medium body wine. As a result many find it can be drunk easily with fish. Although mostly used as a {{blending}} grape, wineries do bottle a pure varietal Carménère which, when produced from grapes at optimal ripeness, imparts a cherry-like, fruity flavor with smoky, spicy and earthy notes and a deep crimson color. Its taste might also be reminiscent of dark chocolate, tobacco, and leather. The wine is best to drink while it is young.|$|E
5|$|The American {{goldfinch}} is a diurnal feeder. According to the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, {{the species}} {{is one of the}} strictest vegetarians in the bird world. It is mainly granivorous, but will occasionally eat insects, which are also fed to its young to provide protein. Its diet consists of the seeds {{from a wide variety of}} annual plants, often those of weeds, grasses, and trees, such as thistle, teasel, dandelion, ragweed, mullein, cosmos, goatsbeard, sunflower, and alder. However, it also consumes tree buds, maple sap, <b>and</b> <b>berries.</b> It will eat at bird feeders provided by humans, particularly in the winter months, preferring Niger seed (commonly and erroneously called thistle seed).|$|E

5|$|The American robin {{is active}} mostly {{during the day}} and assembles in large flocks at night. Its diet {{consists}} of invertebrates (such as beetle grubs, earthworms, and caterpillars), fruits, <b>and</b> <b>berries.</b> It is one of the earliest bird species to lay eggs, beginning to breed shortly after returning to its summer range from its winter range. Its nest consists of long coarse grass, twigs, paper, and feathers, and is smeared with mud and often cushioned with grass or other soft materials. It {{is one of the first}} birds to sing at dawn, and its song consists of several discrete units that are repeated.|$|E
5|$|The American robin's diet {{generally}} {{consists of}} around 40 percent small invertebrates (mainly insects), such as earthworms, beetle grubs, caterpillars and grasshoppers, and 60 percent wild and cultivated fruits <b>and</b> <b>berries.</b> Their ability {{to switch to}} berries allows them to winter much farther north than most other North American thrushes. They will flock to fermented Pyracantha berries, and after eating sufficient quantities will exhibit intoxicated behavior such as falling over while walking. Robins forage primarily {{on the ground for}} soft-bodied invertebrates, and find worms by sight (and sometimes by hearing), pouncing on them and then pulling them up. Nestlings are fed mainly on worms and other soft-bodied animal prey. In some areas, robins, particularly of the coastal race T. m. caurinus, will feed on beaches, taking insects and small mollusks.|$|E

I therefore resolved if God would grant me deliverance I would at once enter the Federal Army.|$|E
