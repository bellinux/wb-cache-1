Although all treatments inferred qualitatively similar PPAR-α signaling, <b>aleglitazar</b> was inferred to have greater effects on high- and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels than tesaglitazar and Pio/Feno, due to a greater number of gene expression changes in pathways related to high-density and low-density lipoprotein metabolism.

40|$|Abstract Background Glycemic {{control and}} {{management}} of dyslipidemia to reduce cardiovascular risk are major therapeutic goals in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM). This study was performed to evaluate the effects of <b>aleglitazar,</b> a balanced dual peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α/γ (PPARα/γ) agonist, on both lipid and glycemic parameters in obese, hypertriglyceridemic, insulin-resistant rhesus monkeys. Methods A 135 -day efficacy study was performed in six rhesus monkeys. After a 28 -day baseline assessment (vehicle only), monkeys received oral <b>aleglitazar</b> 0. 03 mg/kg per day for 42 days, followed by a 63 -day washout period. Plasma levels of markers of glycemic and lipid regulation were measured at baseline, {{at the end of}} the dosing period, and {{at the end of the}} washout period. Results Compared with baseline values, <b>aleglitazar</b> 0. 03 mg/kg per day reduced triglyceride levels by an average of 89 % (328 to 36 mg/dL; P = 0. 0035 when normalized for baseline levels) and increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by 125 % (46 to 102 mg/dL; P = 0. 0007). Furthermore, <b>aleglitazar</b> reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (41 %) and increased levels of apolipoprotein A-I (17 %) and A-II (17 %). <b>Aleglitazar</b> also improved insulin sensitivity by 60 % (P = 0. 001). Mean body weight was reduced by 5. 9 % from baseline values with <b>aleglitazar</b> at this dose (P = 0. 043). Conclusions <b>Aleglitazar,</b> a dual PPARα/γ agonist, has beneficial effects on both lipid and glucose parameters and may have a therapeutic role in modifying cardiovascular risk factors and improving glycemic control in patients with T 2 DM. </p...|$|E

40|$|IMPORTANCE: No therapy {{directed}} against diabetes {{has been shown}} to unequivocally reduce the excess risk of cardiovascular complications. <b>Aleglitazar</b> is a dual agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors with insulin-sensitizing and glucose-lowering actions and favorable effects on lipid profiles. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the addition of <b>aleglitazar</b> to standard medical therapy reduces cardiovascular morbidity and mortality among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and a recent acute coronary syndrome (ACS). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: AleCardio was a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 720 hospitals in 26 countries throughout North America, Latin America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific regions. The enrollment of 7226 patients hospitalized for ACS (myocardial infarction or unstable angina) with type 2 diabetes occurred between February 2010 and May 2012; treatment was planned to continue until patients were followed-up for at least 2. 5 years and 950 primary end point events were positively adjudicated. INTERVENTIONS: Randomized in a 1 : 1 ratio to receive <b>aleglitazar</b> 150 µg or placebo daily. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary efficacy end point was time to cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke. Principal safety end points were hospitalization due to heart failure and changes in renal function. RESULTS: The trial was terminated on July 2, 2013, after a median follow-up of 104 weeks, upon recommendation of the data and safety monitoring board due to futility for efficacy at an unplanned interim analysis and increased rates of safety end points. A total of 3. 1 % of patients were lost to follow-up and 3. 2 % of patients withdrew consent. The primary end point occurred in 344 patients (9. 5 %) in the <b>aleglitazar</b> group and 360 patients (10. 0 %) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0. 96 [95 % CI, 0. 83 - 1. 11]; P[*]=[*]. 57). Rates of serious adverse events, including heart failure (3. 4 % for <b>aleglitazar</b> vs 2. 8 % for placebo, P[*]=[*]. 14), gastrointestinal hemorrhages (2. 4 % for <b>aleglitazar</b> vs 1. 7 % for placebo, P[*]=[*]. 03), and renal dysfunction (7. 4 % for <b>aleglitazar</b> vs 2. 7 % for placebo, P[*]<[*]. 001) were increased. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with type 2 diabetes and recent ACS, use of <b>aleglitazar</b> did not reduce the risk of cardiovascular outcomes. These findings do not support the use of <b>aleglitazar</b> in this setting with a goal of reducing cardiovascular risk. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials. gov Identifier: NCT 01042769. A.

40|$|Diabetes is {{a chronic}} {{disorder}} frequently associated with failure of vital organs like eyes, heart,kidneys, nerves, and blood vessels. Treatment of diabetic complications with drugs {{was classified as}} monotherapy, dual therapy and triple therapy. Many patients cannot obtain satisfactory glycemic control with current therapies, and eventually develope micro vascular and macro vascular complications. New and more effective agents targeted for therapy are required. This review focuses on the therapeutic potential of novel dual PPAR alpha/gamma agonist,aleglitazar in comparision with PPARγ agonists. <b>Aleglitazar</b> exerts dual effects in lowering plasma triglycerides and increasing HDL cholesterol and is the first target for reducing cardiovascular risk among Glitazars.

40|$|Peroxisome proliferator-activated {{receptor}} (PPAR) agonists {{are used}} as adjunct therapy {{in the treatment of}} diabetes mellitus. Fibrates, including fenofibrate, gemfibrozil, benzafibrate, ciprofibrate, and clofibrate act on PPAR alpha to reduce the level of hypertriglyceridemia. However, agonists (ligands) of PPAR-beta/delta receptors, such as tesaglitazar, muraglitazar, ragaglitazar, imiglitazar, <b>aleglitazar,</b> alter the body's energy substrate preference from glucose to lipids and hence contribute to the reduction of blood glucose level. Glitazones or thiazolidinediones on the other hand, bind to PPAR-gamma receptors located in the nuclei of cells. Activation of PPAR-gamma receptors leads to a decrease in insulin resistance and modification of adipocyte metabolism. They reduce hyperlipidaemia by increasing the level of ATP-binding cassette A 1, which modifies extra-hepatic cholesterol into HDL. Dual or pan PPAR ligands stimulate two or more isoforms of PPAR and thereby reduce insulin resistance and prevent short- and long-term complications of diabetes including micro-and macroangiopathy and atherosclerosis, which are caused by deposition of cholesterol. This review examines the chemical structure, actions, side effects and future prospects of dual and pan PPAR agonists...|$|E
40|$|The {{haemoglobin}} glycation index (HGI) quantifies the interindividual {{variation in}} the propensity for glycation and is a predictor of diabetes complications and adverse effects of intensive glucose lowering. We investigated the relevance of HGI as independent predictor of complications by using data of the AleCardio trial. The AleCardio trial randomized 7226 type 2 diabetes patients with an acute coronary syndrome to <b>aleglitazar</b> or placebo. From 6458 patients with baseline glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1 c)) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG), a linear regression equation, HbA(1 c) (%) = 5. 45 + 0. 0158 * FPG (mg/dl), was used to calculate predicted HbA(1 c) and derive HGI (= observed - predicted HbA(1 c)). With multivariate Cox regression we examined the association with major adverse cardiac events, cardiovascular mortality, total mortality and hypoglycaemia, irrespective of treatment allocation, using HGI subgroups (low, intermediate and high) and HGI as continuous variable. Patients with high HGI were younger, more often non-Caucasian, had a longer duration of diabetes, showed more retinopathy and used insulin more often. Hypoglycaemia occurred less often in the low HGI subgroup, but this difference disappeared after adjustment for duration of diabetes, insulin and sulphonylurea use. Low HGI patients were at lower risk for cardiovascular mortality (hazard ratio 0. 64; 95 % confidence interval 0. 44 - 0. 93, p= 0. 020) and total mortality (hazard ratio 0. 69; 95 % confidence interval 0. 50 - 0. 95, p = 0. 025), as compared with high HGI patients. Every percentage increase in HGI {{was associated with a}} 16 % increase in the risk for cardiovascular mortality (p= 0. 005). The association between HGI and mortality disappeared with additional adjustment for HbA(1 c). HGI predicts mortality in diabetes patients with acute coronary syndromes, but no better than HbA(1 c...|$|E
