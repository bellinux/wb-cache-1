Along with the previously mentioned fear of increases in taxation or decreases in services, he argued that those living in the ACT would have felt that they already had a voice in the governance of the territory, through federal electoral representation.

25|$|In May 1877, a {{group of}} buffalo hunters led by James Harvey, a Civil War veteran and long-time buffalo hunter, {{was looking for a}} buffalo herd. Then after a series of Comanche raids led by Red Young Man, where much stock was taken and a few hunters killed, the game changed. The hunters started after a more deadly game on the Llano Estacado region of north-west Texas and eastern New Mexico looking for revenge against the Comanche. The men were a mix of former Union and Confederate soldiers, former trappers and mixed breeds <b>and</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> to fight.|$|E

The two groups joined together and became a more effective fighting force. By September 1943, the Polish People's Army realized that the Blaichman and Gruber groups could be a dependable ally {{in the fight against}} the Germans and provided them with supplies that had been parachuted in by the Soviet air force. Now equipped with hand grenades, explosives, land mines, machine guns, and ammunition, the group could be even more successful in fighting the Germans.|$|E
25|$|The {{question}} of a catalog was to Cogswell's mind a matter of prime importance. By the end of 1855, Cogswell was able to report that the catalog was finished, excepting {{only a small portion}} of history. The collection was grouped into 14 departments, for each of which a separate catalog was prepared. The alphabetical index to these separate catalogs formed the basis of the printed catalog issued during 1857–1861 in 4 volumes. The timing and the format of the catalog went against Cogswell's judgment, but accorded with the desire of the trustees to put before the public a tangible result of their work. In 1866, a supplement was issued. The first catalog recorded approximately 115,000 volumes. The supplement of 1866 recorded the accessions of five years, about 15,000 volumes, and carried with it an index to subjects. It was imperfect, but also the work of someone who knew books <b>and</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> to guide others to them.|$|E

25|$|Clara Barton {{became an}} {{educator}} in 1838 for 12 years in schools in Canada and West Georgia. Barton fared {{well as a}} teacher <b>and</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> to handle rambunctious children, particularly the boys, since as a child she enjoyed her male cousins' and brothers' company. She learned how to act like them, {{making it easier for}} her to relate to and control the boys in her classroom since they respected her. After her mother's death in 1851, the family home closed down. Barton decided to further her education by pursuing writing and languages at the Clinton Liberal Institute in New York. In this college town, she developed many friendships that broadened her point of view on many issues concurring at the time. The principal of the institute recognized her tremendous abilities and admired her work. This friendship lasted for many years, eventually turning into a romance. As a writer, her terminology was pristine and easy to understand. Her writings and bodies of work could instruct the local statesmen. No one could exceed her outstanding service to humanity in war and in peace.|$|E

[...] In 1909, McNair commanded the 4th Artillery's Battery D at Fort Riley, Kansas, during tests designed to determine the battle-worthiness of different types of defensive works if they were attacked by various types of cannons and howitzers.|$|E
500|$|Although much of {{the music}} of The Bartered Bride is folk-like, the only {{significant}} use of authentic folk material is in the Act II furiant, with a few other occasional glimpses of basic Czech folk melodies. The [...] "Czechness" [...] of the music is further illustrated by the closeness to Czech dance rhythms of many individual numbers. Smetana's diary indicates {{that he was trying}} to give the music [...] "a popular character, because the plot [...] is taken from village life and demands a national treatment." [...] According to his biographer John Clapham, Smetana [...] "certainly felt the pulse of the peasantry <b>and</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> to express this in music, yet inevitably he added something of himself." [...] Historian Harold Schonberg argues that [...] "the exoticisms of the Bohemian musical language were not in the Western musical consciousness until Smetana appeared." [...] Smetana's musical language is, on the whole, one of happiness, expressing joy, dancing and festivals.|$|E

Dr. Mads Gilbert, an anesthesiologist and the chief of the hospital's emergency room, proceeded with the resuscitation attempt. He commented on Bågenholm's state: [...] "She has completely dilated pupils. She is ashen, flaxen white. She's wet. She's ice cold when I touch her skin, and she looks absolutely dead." [...] Gilbert had treated many cases of hypothermia before because of the cold climate in Norway, <b>and</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> to treat Bågenholm. The electrocardiogram connected to her showed no signs of life, but Gilbert knew patients should be [...] "warmed up before you declare them dead".

500|$|Jardine {{insisted on}} strict {{discipline}} from his players but in return {{he went to}} great lengths to look after them, such as organising dental treatment or providing champagne for his tired bowlers. Critics praised his skill in field placing, which was sometimes interpreted as panic when he made frequent changes if the batsmen were on top. He also displayed great physical courage, such as when he was struck by a ball hard enough to draw blood on the Bodyline tour, but refused to show pain before reaching the dressing room. On the same tour, he instructed his men not to be friendly or to socialise with the Australian players; Gubby Allen even claimed that Jardine instructed the team to hate the Australians. Robertson-Glasgow wrote that Jardine made thorough preparation for games in which he was captain, studying individual batsmen at great length to find weaknesses. He had very clear plans, judged the strengths and weaknesses of his teams <b>and</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> to get the best out of individual players. However, Robertson-Glasgow considered it a grave misjudgement to make Jardine captain of England, particularly given his known antipathy towards Australia. Pelham Warner described how Jardine [...] "was a master of tactics and strategy, and was especially adept in managing fast bowlers and thereby preserving their energy. He possessed a great capacity for taking pains, which, it has been said, is the mark of a genius... As a field tactician and selector of teams he was, I consider, surpassed by no one and equalled by few, if any." ...|$|E
500|$|When he {{returned}} home in 1857 at age 26, he found a burgeoning timber industry in Michigan, the [...] "Green Gold Rush". He took a job earning $13 a month at the Pine River lumber camp near St. Louis, Michigan and within a month was promoted to camp foreman with double wages. He was [...] "tall, strong <b>and</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> to give orders". Using savings, he started his own lumber company in 1858, buying 300 acres in Gratiot County. In 1867, he founded the community of Melbourne on the Saginaw River near Zilwaukee, Michigan, named after his favorite city in Australia. By 1870, Melbourne was among {{the largest and most}} complete mills in the world, but in 1876, it was destroyed by a fire of unknown origin. Many at the time thought this {{would be the end of}} Burt's fortunes, but he also owned timber land elsewhere, including in St. Louis County, Minnesota, which turned out to be favourable for him, as it was in the heart of the immensely valuable Mesabi iron range. In addition to his various timber and iron mine holdings, Burt made his fortune in the salt industry, in railroads and in foreign bonds and banking investments. He invested in the former CS Railroad (running between Durand and Bay City) and for a time, owned most of the Ann Arbor Railroad system. He also bought railways in Russia and China. He had plans to build a sugar beet factory in Owosso, Michigan, but the idea failed to come to fruition.|$|E

[...] With his mock-befuddled one-liners and sharp retorts, Rochester broke comedic racial barriers. Unlike many black supporting characters of the time, Rochester was a regular member of the fictional Benny household, and was functionally his equal. [...] Benny wrote the character as transcending the racial stereotype of the era, and the popularity of Rochester nearly rivaled his own.

Morton fine-tuned this approach at the new Western Electric plant in Allentown, Pa., which produced electronic devices and components for the Bell System. He set up a Bell Labs semiconductor development group there and put Eugene Anderson in charge.|$|E
