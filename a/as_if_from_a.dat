5|$|Kitsune are {{commonly}} portrayed as lovers, usually in stories involving a young human male and a kitsune {{who takes the}} form of a human woman. The kitsune may be a seductress, but these stories are more often romantic in nature. Typically, the young man unknowingly marries the fox, who proves a devoted wife. The man eventually discovers the fox's true nature, and the fox-wife is forced to leave him. In some cases, the husband wakes <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> dream, filthy, disoriented, and far from home. He must then return to confront his abandoned family in shame.|$|E
5|$|The divine {{represented}} by light is a motif {{in keeping with}} the sentiment of both the Latin text on the hem of Mary's dress (which compares her beauty and radiance to that of divine light) and on the frame. A separate source of light, which also behaves <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> divine rather than natural source, illuminates her face. The two pools of light behind her have been described as lending the painting a mystical atmosphere, indicating the presence of God. In the niche behind her, the statues are lit by two candles - symbols of the incarnation, whereas she is bathed in natural light. The artificial light adds to the overall illusion of the interior of the church, which Pächt views as achieved mainly through colour.|$|E
25|$|An out-of-body {{experience}} (OBE or sometimes OOBE) {{is an experience}} that typically involves a feeling of floating outside one's body and, in some cases, the feeling of perceiving one's physical body <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> place outside one's body (autoscopy).|$|E

25|$|Encolpius and his companions, by now wearied and disgusted, try {{to leave}} as the other guests proceed to the baths, but are {{prevented}} by a porter (72). They escape only after Trimalchio holds a mock funeral for himself. The vigiles, mistaking the sound of horns for a signal that a fire has broken out, burst into the residence (78). Using this sudden alarm {{as an excuse to}} get rid of the sophist Agamemnon, whose company Encolpius and his friends are weary of, they flee <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> real fire (78).|$|E
500|$|A {{man named}} Vukota said these words to Bishop Danilo, {{one of the}} main {{characters}} of The Mountain Wreath, who previously uttered a piercing vision speaking as if he was alone. The second and the third verses can be compared with an idiomatic expression whose literal sense is [...] "to dash into a frenzied countenance", meaning [...] "to fall into a frenzied or crazed exaltation". Vukota compared Bishop Danilo's exaltation with that of a witch or a vjedogonja when their spirit flew out of their body. It was thought that the witches held an assembly each year on 1 March, and the vjedogonje mostly flew during the long autumn nights, especially when strong winds blew. After Vukota's words, Bishop Danilo started <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> dream.|$|E
500|$|Multiple {{critics have}} noted that the {{portrayal}} of Doofenshmirtz and Perry's relationship in the episode features a somewhat of a homosexual subtext. The concept behind it is a parody of stereotypical teen romance film, casting Perry and Doofenshmirtz—two males who are of different species—as the teenage couple who is [...] "breaking up." [...] Perry's initial suspicions over Doofenshmirtz having a new nemesis are portrayed as if a person discovers their significant other is cheating on them. Perry discovers a paw print on Doofenshmirtz's face, resembling a lipstick mark on the cheek <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> lover, and Peter the Panda emerges from Doofenshmirtz's closet. Doofenshmirtz initially tries to deny having a new nemesis, but eventually admits to the accusation, noting that he [...] "didn't want [...] to find out this way," [...] overtly detailing a common way couples discover their partner is cheating on them. Perry is depressed about their [...] "break up" [...] and reminisces about their past [...] "relationship" [...] together, while music resembling a love song plays in the background. After feeling depressed himself, Doofenshmirtz [...] "dumps" [...] Peter and reunites with Perry on a talk show prone to featuring romantic confrontations.|$|E

500|$|Part One has a 67% rating at Rotten Tomatoes, while Part Two has an 80% rating. Scott Foundas of the LA Weekly proclaimed Che [...] "nothing if not {{the movie}} of the year". In his review for the Village Voice, J. Hoberman wrote, [...] "At its best, Che is both action film and ongoing argument. Each new camera setup seeks to {{introduce}} a specific idea—about Che or his situation—and every choreographed battle sequence {{is a sort of}} algorithm where the camera attempts to inscribe the event that is being enacted". Hoberman compared Soderbergh's directing style and [...] "non-personalized" [...] historical approach on the film to Otto Preminger's observational use of the moving camera, or one of Roberto Rossellini's [...] "serene" [...] documentaries. Armond White, in his review for the New York Press, wrote, [...] "Out-perversing Gus Van Sant's Milk, Soderbergh makes a four-hour-plus biopic about a historical figure without providing a glimmer of charm or narrative coherence". In his review for The New York Times, A.O. Scott writes, [...] "Mr. Soderbergh once again offers a master class in filmmaking. As history, though, Che is finally not epic but romance. It takes great care to be true to the factual record, but it is, nonetheless, a fairy tale". Sheri Linden, in her review for the Los Angeles Times, wrote, [...] "in this flawed work of austere beauty, the logistics of war and the language of revolution give way to something greater, a struggle that may be defined by politics but can't be contained by it". In her review for the Washington Post, Ann Hornaday wrote, [...] "The best way to encounter Che, is to let go of words like 'film' and 'movie', words that somehow seem inadequate to the task of describing such a mesmerizing, fully immersive cinematic experience. By the end of Che, viewers will likely emerge <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> trance, with indelibly vivid, if not more ambivalent feelings about Guevara, than the bumper-sticker image they walked in with".|$|E
2500|$|In fact, Gog and Magog {{were held}} by the Mongol to be their ancestors, at least by some segment of the population. As {{traveler}} and Friar Riccoldo da Monte di Croce put it in c. 1291, [...] "They say themselves that they are descended from Gog and Magog: and on this account they are called Mogoli, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> corruption of Magogoli". Marco Polo, traveling when the initial terror had subsided, places Gog and Magog among the Tartars in Tenduc, but then claims that the names Gog and Magog are translations of the place-names Ung and Mungul, inhabited by the Ung and Mongols respectively.|$|E
2500|$|Helpless to {{save his}} wife, Georges suffers the [...] "tragedy of masculinity" [...] that Antoine predicts as {{the fate of the}} enslaved [...] "negro" [...] male. Georges is subject to the patriarchal power denied to him even though he is a male head of family, as he is also denied the right to keep his family {{together}} and protect his wife and children. As Antoine harshly declaims {{at the beginning of the}} story, a slave's virtues as a man can never come to fruition: the institution corrupts virtue until it becomes monstrous, grotesque or destructive. Georges' heroic impulses are overwritten by gothic horror. He threatens to kill Alfred and drink his blood; his laugh becomes [...] "infernal," [...] his voice issues <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> tomb, like [...] "one of the damned." ...|$|E

2500|$|Actress Meryl Streep, {{who played}} Katherina in 1978 at the Shakespeare in the Park festival, {{says of the}} play, [...] "really {{what matters is that}} they have an {{incredible}} passion and love; it's not something that Katherina admits to right away, but it does provide the source of her change." [...] Similarly, John C. Bean sees the speech as the final stage in the process of Katherina's change of heart towards Petruchio; [...] "if we can appreciate the liberal element in Kate's last speech – the speech that strikes modern sensibilities as advocating male tyranny – we can perhaps see that Kate is tamed not in the automatic manner of behavioural psychology but in the spontaneous manner of the later romantic comedies where characters lose themselves and emerge, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> dream, liberated into the bonds of love." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rick Mercer tours the United States, {{talking to}} Americans <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> Canadian news program, asking them about [...] "Canadian issues." [...] The {{object is to}} see how little some Americans know about their {{northern}} neighbours. The piece was so popular that the CBC had Mercer create a one-hour TV special based on the segment. It became the highest rated comedy special in Canadian television history when it aired on Canada Day, 2001. Some truly memorable bits include Mercer getting Americans to say [...] "Congratulations Canada on legalizing VCRs!" [...] and getting a professor at Princeton University to sign a petition against the re-starting of the Annual Toronto Polar Bear Hunt. In an election 2000 segment, he convinced then-Governor of Texas George W. Bush that Canada's Prime Minister Jean Chrétien was named Jean Poutine {{and that he was}} supporting Bush's candidacy. The success of the CBC special got Mercer attention on numerous American media outlets, including ABC's Nightline. Mercer abandoned the concept after September 11, 2001.|$|E
2500|$|Around 200 AD, ten of {{the plays}} of Euripides began to be {{circulated}} in a select edition, possibly for use in schools, with some commentaries or scholia recorded in the margins. Similar editions had appeared for Aeschylus and Sophoclesthe only plays of theirs that survive today. Euripides however was more fortunate than the other tragedians in the survival of a second edition of his work, compiled in alphabetical order <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> set of his collect works, but without scholia attached. This [...] "Alphabetical" [...] edition was combined with the [...] "Select" [...] edition by some unknown Byzantine scholar, bringing together all the nineteen plays that survive today. The [...] "Select" [...] plays are found in many medieval manuscripts but only two manuscripts preserve the [...] "Alphabetical" [...] playsoften denoted L and P, after the Laurentian Library at Florence, and the Bibliotheca Palatina in the Vatican, where they are stored. It is believed that P derived its Alphabet plays and some Select plays from copies of an ancestor of L, but the remainder is derived from elsewhere. P contains all the extant plays of Euripides, L is missing The Trojan Women and latter part of The Bacchae.|$|E
50|$|He {{became an}} {{exponent}} of L'Aeropittura (Aeropainting), the dominant Futurist {{style of the}} 1930s which applied the experience of flight to the depiction of landscape aerially; the world was no longer seen {{from the perspective of}} the person on the ground but <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> aeroplane.

2500|$|During the 14th century Giotto di Bondone and his {{followers}} began to acknowledge nature in their work, increasingly introducing elements of the landscape as the background setting for {{the action of the}} figures in their paintings. Early in the 15th century, landscape painting was established as a genre in Europe, as a setting for human activity, often expressed in a religious subject, such as the themes of the , the Journey of the Magi, or Saint Jerome in the Desert. Luxury illuminated manuscripts were very important in the early development of landscape, especially series of the Labours of the Months such as those in the Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry, which conventionally showed small genre figures in increasingly large landscape settings. A particular advance is shown in the less well-known Turin-Milan Hours, now largely destroyed by fire, whose developments were reflected in Early Netherlandish painting {{for the rest of the}} century. The artist known as [...] "Hand G", probably one of the Van Eyck brothers, was especially successful in reproducing effects of light and in a natural-seeming progression from the foreground to the distant view. This was something other artists were to find difficult for a century or more, often solving the problem by showing a landscape background from over the top of a parapet or window-sill, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> considerable height.|$|E

40|$|This study {{explored}} perspective {{taking in}} social phobics' images of past anxiety-provoking social situations and non-social situations. For images of social situations, social phobics {{were significantly more}} likely than non-patient controls to take an observer perspective, viewing themselves <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> external point of view. In contrast, social phobics and controls did not differ in the perspective taken in images of non-social situations, which were generally viewed <b>from</b> <b>a</b> field perspective (seeing the situation <b>as</b> <b>if</b> looking out through their own eyes). The clinical significance of these findings is briefly discussed...|$|R
