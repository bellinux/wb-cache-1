Several medicinal recipes prepared from a mixture of plants are often used by traditional medicinal practitioners for the treatment of many diseases including cancer. However, little is known for their scientific information especially their anticancer effects. In this study, one traditional used Moroccan herbal remedy for treatment of hemorrhoids and cancer therapy (cervical cancer, skin cancer) was investigated for its cytotoxic effect against cancer cell lines. <b>Aqueous</b> herbal <b>distillate</b> of mixture in equal quantity of five medicinal plants was evaluated for its in vitro cytotoxicity, using the 3 -(4, 5 - dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, against two human cancer cell lines; cervix adenocarcinoma (HeLa) and breast cancer cell line (MCF 7). The mixture of plants exhibited potent cytotoxicity with an IC 50 of 60 µg/ml for Hela cells and 122 µg/ml for MCF 7 cells. Furthermore, the mixture was evaluated in vitro for antioxidant potential with the spectrophotometric method based on the reduction of the stable DPPH (1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picryl hydrazyl) free radical.

40|$|Abstract Background The polyherbal eye drop (Itone™) is {{a mixture}} of <b>aqueous</b> <b>distillates</b> of {{nineteen}} traditionally used ingredients that sum up to impart potency to the formulation and make it a useful adjunct in various ocular pathologies. However, as there have been no controlled experimental studies accounting to the above claim, therefore, the present study was designed to evaluate the polyherbal formulation (PHF) for antiangiogenic, anti-inflammatory, anticataract, antioxidant and cytotoxicity in addition to the evaluation of intraocular penetration of PHF in rabbit eyes using LC-MS/MS. Materials and methods Antiangiogenic activity of the PHF was evaluated using in ovo chick chorio-allantoic membrane (CAM) assay and in vivo cautery induced corneal neovascularization assay in rats. Anticataract potential was evaluated using steroid induced cataract in developing chick embryos, sodium selenite induced cataract in rat pups and galactose induced cataract in rats. The antioxidant activity was evaluated using di-phenyl picryl hydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging assay. Anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated in vitro using inhibition of LTB 4 formation in human WBCs and in vivo using carrageenan induced paw edema assay in rats. The cytotoxicity was evaluated against HeLa cancer cell lines using (3 -(4, 5 -Dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Furthermore evaluation of the intraocular penetration of the PHF was carried out in rabbit eyes via aqueous humor paracentesis and further analysis using LC-MS/MS. Results PHF significantly inhibited VEGF induced proliferation of new blood vessels in CAM assay and inhibited the cautery induced corneal neovascularization in rats. Additionally, PHF showed noticeable delay in the progression of cataract in the selenite and galactose induced cataract models whereby the PHF treated lenses were graded for stages II and III respectively. However, the PHF did not show any anticataract activity in the hydrocortisone induced cataract model. Moreover, PHF exhibited anti-inflammatory activity whereby it showed 39. 34 % inhibition of LTB 4 formation and significantly inhibited carrageenan induced paw edema in rats. Eight compounds of PHF viz. camphor, casticin, curcumin-II, quercetin, rosmarinic acid, γ-terpinene, β-pinene and dipentene exhibited transcorneal penetration in rabbit eyes. Conclusion The significant antiangiogenic and anti-inflammatory activities evinced by the PHF merits further investigation for ocular neovascular and inflammatory diseases in humans. </p...|$|R

The <b>aqueous</b> <b>distillate</b> was collected in traps cooled to - 10 to - 80 C. The culture volatiles were extracted from the distillate with CH 2 Cl 2, and, after removal of {{the bulk of the}} solvent, the concentrated volatiles were examined by packed-column gas chromatography. Nineteen peaks were observed, and coupled gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was employed to identify the larger components. The compounds identified were: 3 -methyl-butanol, 3 -octanone, 3 -octanol, 1 -octen- 3 -ol, 1 -octanol, and cis- 2 -octen- 1 -ol. The two octenols were the predominant compounds, and sufficient sample was trapped from the gas chromatograph for infrared analyses; this confirmed the mass spectral identifications and permitted the assignment of the cis designation to 2 -octen- 1 -ol.

40|$|A spectrofluorometric {{method for}} the {{determination}} of malonaldehyde in wet tissues which employes a malonaldehyde specific reagent, 4, 42 ̆ 7 -sulfonyldianiline, was developed. In this determination, malonaldehyde was reacted with 4, 42 ̆ 7 -sulfonyldianiline to form a fluorescent compound that can be measured at an excitation maximum of 475 nm and an emission maximum of 545 nm. Malonaldehyde was first extracted as an <b>aqueous</b> <b>distillate</b> from acidified muscle tissue and subsequently transferred from the aqueous solution into N,N-dimethylformamide. To achieve the transfer, an aliquot of the aqueous solution was mixed with dimethylformamide and the mixture made alkaline with 0. 1 N sodium hydroxide. Water was then removed from the mixture by fractional distillation. Under the alkaline condition (pH 11 - 12), malonaldehyde occurred in a non-volatile form and was retained in the dimethylformamide residue;The spectrofluorometric assay and the thiobarbituric acid (TBA) test gave similar results for the malonaldehyde content of raw and cooked turkey, beef and pork. However, the TBA test gave increasingly higher values for the cooked meats during storage than did the fluorometric assay. The SPF assay was at least 25 x more sensitive than the TBA test;The effect of microwave energy on the stability and fatty acid composition of turkey, pork and beef lipids was also studied. For turkey and pork samples, the rate of lipid oxidation was significantly higher for microwave cooked than conventionally cooked samples. Cooking method did not significantly affect the rate of lipid oxidation in beef. Microwave cooking caused {{a significant increase in}} the unsaturated/saturated fatty acids (U/S) ratio for pork and turkey compared to conventional cooking. This increase in U/S ratio is probably responsible for the increased rate of lipid oxidation observed for microwave cooked samples. Trans fatty acids were not formed by microwave cooking in any meat samples;Formation of trans fatty acids by microorganisms during the fermentation of semi-dry summer sausages and natto (a fermented soy product) was studied. The organisms involved in these fermentations (Pediococcus, Micrococcus, and Bacillus subtilis) did not cause hydrogenation of the fatty acids, and hence, no trans fatty acids were detected...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1966 Increasing {{interest}} {{has been shown}} in the irradiation sterilization and irradiation pasteurization of foods, but problems of off-flavors and odors are still unsolved, {{especially in the case of}} dairy products. From the flavor chemistry point of view, milk lipids are very highly susceptible to irradiation effects. Therefore, this investigation was designed to study some irradiation induced reactions involving flavor changes in the milk fat and to identify the volatile components produced in the milk fat upon irradiation. Milk fat, prepared from raw sweet cream and washed free of phospholipids, was first irradiated in the presence of air and under vacuum in glass vials at 4. 5 Mrad with gamma rays from cobalt- 60. The irradiation resulted in increase in TBA number, peroxide value, total monocarbonyls, bleaching of color, slightly rancid and typical candle-like off-flavors. Free fatty acids were also produced upon irradiation. The changes were more drastic in air along with production of a slight oxidized flavor. The monocarbonyls identified by column and paper chromatographic methods in irradiated milk fat include: C₁ through C₁₂, C₁₄, and C₁₆ n-alkanals; C₃ through C₉, C₁₁, C₁₃ and C₁₅ alk- 2 -ones with only traces of C₆ and C₈ alk- 2 - ones; and C₅, C₆, C₉, and C₁₂ alk- 2 -enals. Irradiation of milk fat that had been dried over calcium hydride also caused free fatty acid production, especially short chain fatty acids. Methyl octanoate treated with calcium hydride and irradiated at 1. 5, 3. 0, 4. 5, and 6. 0 Mrad yielded small quantities of free octanoic acid, confirming that irradiation caused fission of the ester linkage even when traces of water were removed. The quantities of octanoic acid formed increased with increasing dose of irradiation. For identification of volatile components, the milk fat was irradiated in 307 x 409 'C' enameled cans under vacuum. The headspace analysis showed some air still left in the cans. Irradiation resulted in consumption of oxygen and production of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and methane as identified in the headspace gases. The volatiles were isolated from the irradiated and control milk fats by low temperature, vacuum steam distillation at 40 °C and 1 - 2 mm Hg. The volatile components were then extracted from the <b>aqueous</b> <b>distillate</b> with ethyl ether. The ethyl ether extract exhibited the typical candle-like defect. The ethyl ether concentrate was analyzed by combination of GLC and fast-scan mass spectrometric techniques. Identification of various components was achieved on the basis of mass spectral data and coincidence of gas chromatographic retention times. In the case of the components for which only GLC t[subscript r]/t[subscript r] evidence was available or the mass spectra obtained were not satisfactory, the identity assigned was only tentative. The volatile compounds that were positively identified to be present in irradiated milk fat are given below: n-Alkanes C₅ through C₁₇ 1 -Alkenes C₅, C₇ through C₁₇ Fatty acids C₄, C₆, C₈ and C₁₀ n-Alkanals C₅ through C₁₁ Others γ-decalactone, δ-decalactone, 2 -heptanone, benzene, ethyl acetate, chloroform, and dichlorobenzene. The tentative identification was obtained for the following compounds: γ-lactones C₆ and C₈ δ-lactones C₆, C₈, C₁₁, and C₁₂ 1, ?-alkadienes C₁₀, C₁₁, C₁₂, C₁₆ and C₁₇ iso-alkanes C₁₀, C₁₁, C₁₂, and C₁₃ Others methyl hexanoate, 2 -hexanone, 4 -heptanone and n-dodecanal. The compounds present in unirradiated control milk fat included: short chain fatty acids (C₄, C₆, C₈, and C₁₀), C₈, C₁₀, and C₁₂ δ-lactones, 2 -heptanone, chloroform, dichlorobenzene, benzene, toluene, and ethyl-benzene.

The different extracts were analyzed by gas chromatography coupled to a flame ionization detector (GC-FID) and by gas chromatography coupled to a mass spectrometer (GC-MS). Essential oils yields obtained range from 0. 3 to 1. 6 %. E. camaldulensis had the higher yield. Forty four compounds were characterized in E. camaldulensis essential oils. These lasts were dominated by 1. 8 -cineole (47. 54 to 52. 47 %), limonene (16. 5 to 19. 1 %), α-pinene (7. 3 to 11. 2 %) and p-cymene (6. 0 to 8. 8 %). Fifty compounds were identified in E. Alba oils with 1. 8 -cineole (36. 0 - 38. 3 %) α-pinene (19. 0 - 26. 4 %), limonene (5. 7 - 8. 3 %), trans-pinocarveol (3. 5 - 5. 0 %) β-pinene (1. 9 to 4. 6 %) as major compounds. In E. tereticornis oils, fifty two compounds were identified. Their composition were dominated by p-cymene (42. 49 to 48. 51 %) followed by 1. 8 -cineole (21. 3 - 24. 5 %), limonene (4. 8 - 5. 9 %) and α-pinene (1. 9 to 6. 7 %). The analyzed hydrosols were composed by oxygenated molecules whose major part was found in oils. As essential oils, all corresponding hydrosols hade high rate of 1. 8 -cineole. E. alba hydrosol contains mainly 1. 8 -cineole (39. 1 %), trans-pinocarveol (19. 3 %), pinocarvone (6. 8 %).

This {{study was conducted in}} order to develop a more thorough understanding of the chemical nature of this defect, and to formulate a synthetic malty flavor preparation. An 18 hour malty culture and an acidified heated skim milk control were steam distilled using a specially designed, low temperature, reduced pressure glass apparatus fitted with ground glass ball or standard taper joints. After subsequent ethyl ether extractions, the <b>aqueous</b> <b>distillates</b> yielded flavor concentrates which were suitable for gas-liquid chromatographic (GLC) and mass spectrometric analysis. Flavor component identifications were made on both a tentative and positive basis. Tentative identifications were made using the technique of GLC relative retention times. Identifications were considered positive when GLC retention data could be coupled with mass spectral data. Compounds positively identified as being present in the malty culture included acetaldehyde, 3 -methylbutanal, phenylacetaldehyde, ethanol, butanol, 2 -methylpropanol, 3 -methylbutanol, 2 -furfurol, phenethyl alcohol, acetone, butanone, 2 -pentanone, 2 -heptanone, 2 -nonanone, ethyl formate, ethyl acetate, ethyl butyrate, ethyl isovalerate, ethyl octanoate, isoamyl acetate and toluene. Compounds tentatively identified included 2 -methylpropanal, pentanal, benzaldehyde, 2 -furfural, 2 -undecanone, 2 -tridecanone, ethyl hexanoate, ethyl decanoate, methyl acetate, γ-octalactone, δ-octalactone, formic acid and acetic acid. In the heated skim milk control, acetaldehyde, benzaldehyde, 2 -furfural, 2 -furfurol, 2 -pentanone, 2 -heptanone, 2 -nonanone, 2 -undecanone, 2 -tridecanone, ethyl acetate and methyl chloride were positively identified while pentanal, hexanal, octanal, nonanal, 2 -hexanone, 2 -octanone, ethyl formate, ethyl octanoate, methyl acetate, γ-octalactone and δ-octalactone remained as tentative identifications. Quantitative evaluations of the volatile constituents present in each of four strains of the malty culture were conducted using a gas entrainment, on-column trapping, GLC technique.

40|$|Graduation date: 1965 Numerous {{investigations}} {{have been made}} on the contribution of butter cultures to the flavor of cultured cream butter, but production of uniform cultured cream butter has not been possible in industry. Therefore, it was desirable to investigate in detail the qualitative and quantitative chemistry of the flavor of high quality butter cultures, and to examine more closely some of the aspects of flavor production by butter culture organisms. Volatile flavor components of high quality butter culture and control heated milk were isolated from intact samples {{by means of a}} specially designed low-temperature, reduced-pressure steam distillation apparatus. Most of the flavor compounds present in the resulting distillate fractions were tentatively identified by gas chromatographic relative retention time data. Flavor concentrates obtained by ethyl ether extractions of <b>aqueous</b> <b>distillates</b> were also separated by temperature-programmed, capillary column gas chromatography, and the effluent from the capillary column was analyzed by a fast- scan mass spectrometer. Many of the flavor compounds in the flavor concentrates were positively identified by correlation of mass spectral and gas chromatographic data. In addition, supporting evidence for the identification of some flavor components was obtained through the use of qualitative functional group reagents, derivatives and headspace gas chromatography. Compounds that were positively identified in butter culture include ethanol, acetone, ethyl formate, methyl acetate, acetaldehyde, diacetyl, ethyl acetate, dimethyl sulfide, butanone, 2 -butanol, methyl butyrate, ethyl butyrate, methane, methyl chloride, carbon dioxide and methanol; also included were 2 -pentanone, 2 -heptanone, acetoin, formic acid, acetic acid, lactic acid, 2 -furfural, 2 -furfurol, methyl hexanoate, ethyl hexanoate, 2 -nonanone, 2 -undecanone, methyl octanoate and ethyl octanoate. Compounds that were tentatively identified in butter culture include hydrogen sulfide, methyl mercaptan, n-butanal, n-butanol, 2 -hexanone, n-pentanal, n-pentanol, 2 -mercaptoethanol, n-butyl formate, n-butyl acetate, 2 -methylbutanal, 3 -methylbutanal, methylpropanal, methyl heptanoate, n-octanal, 2 -tridecanone, methyl benzoate, methyl nonanoate, ethyl nonanoate, ethyl decanoate, methyl dodecanoate, ethyl dodecanoate, delta-octalactone and delta-decalactone. Compounds that were positively identified in control heated milk include acetaldehyde, ethyl formate, ethyl acetate, 2 -heptanone, 2 -furfural, 2 -furfurol, 2 -nonanone, 2 -undecanone, ethyl octanoate and methyl decanoate. Compounds that were tentatively identified in control heated milk include dimethyl sulfide, hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, methyl mercaptan, methyl acetate, acetone, methanol, butanone, butanal, n-butanol, methyl butyrate, ethyl butyrate, 2 -pentanone, 2 -hexanone, 2 -mercaptoethanol, 2 -furfuryl acetate, ethyl hexanoate, methyl heptanoate, 2 -tridecanone, ethyl decanoate, ethyl dodecanoate, delta-octalactone and delta-decalactone. The data indicated that the qualitative flavor composition of control heated milk and butter culture were very similar. Diacetyl, ethanol, 2 -butanol and acetic acid were noted to be consistently absent in the data for the control heated milk. Other compounds were not observed in the heated milk fractions, but were also absent from some of the culture fractions. This was attributed to their presence in low concentrations, chemical instability or inefficient recovery. A modified 3 -methyl- 2 -benzothiazolone hydrazone spectrophotometric procedure was adapted for the determination of acetaldehyde produced in lactic starter cultures. The procedure was applied in conjunction with diacetyl measurements in studying single- and mixed-strain lactic cultures. The diacetyl to acetaldehyde ratio was found to be approximately 4 : 1 in desirably flavored mixed-strain butter cultures. When the ratio of the two compounds was lower than 3 : 1 a green flavor was observed. Acetaldehyde utilization at 21 °C by Leuconostoc citrovorum 91404 was very rapid in both acidified (pH 4. 5) and non-acidified (pH 6. 5) milk cultures. The addition of five p. p. m. of acetaldehyde to non-acidified milk media prior to inoculation greatly enhanced growth of L. citrovorum 91404 during incubation at 21 °C. Combinations of single-strain organisms demonstrated that the green flavor defect can result from excess numbers of Streptococcus lactis or Streptococcus diacetilactis in relation to the L. citrovorum population. Diacetyl, dimethyl sulfide, acetaldehyde, acetic acid and carbon dioxide were found to be "key" compounds in natural butter culture flavor. Optimum levels of these compounds in butter culture were ascertained by chemical or flavor panel evaluations. On the basis of these determinations, a synthetic butter culture prepared with heated whole milk and delta-gluconolactone (final pH 4. 65) was flavored with 2. 0 p. p. m. of diacetyl, 0. 5 p. p. m. of acetaldehyde, 1250 p. p. m. of acetic acid, 25. 0 p. p. b. of dimethyl sulfide and a small amount of sodium bicarbonate for production of carbon dioxide. The resulting synthetic butter culture exhibited the typical aroma, flavor and body characteristics found in natural high quality butter cultures, except that the delta-gluconolactone was found to contribute an astringent flavor...|$|R
