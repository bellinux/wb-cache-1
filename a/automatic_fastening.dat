Snap fasten ' rs are non-rigid bodies, and hence predicting the motion of flexible obj cts during an assembl is of interest as an algorithmic problem. We consider a plnr [...] . system of rid bodies that are cnantly connected by torsional springs. A single root dy undergpes pure translation, durig which k passively rotationally compliant members calle- awls " can contact with immva le planar obstacles. As the motion proceeds, the pawls I/ deform (deflect) around the obstaclesâˆˆ reponse to the kinematic constraints and the frictional contact forces. The pawls can also snap off an obstacle edge towards their zero position; Lcc' this motion is modeled using a pure rotation. The simulation problem {{is to determine the}} '"'y motion of the pawls as parameterized by the translation distance of the root, and to compute the termination configuration of the system if it is reachable. The solution trajectory (D of the system is piecewise cubic in the configuration space, and the dynamics may be reduced to erecting cubic "local " configuration space constraints.
