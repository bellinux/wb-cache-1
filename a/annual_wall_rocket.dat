The effect of seed burial depth on seedling recruitment in the field was also investigated at Roseworthy, South Australia. Under optimal conditions (30 C, light/dark) germination of perennial <b>wall</b> <b>rocket</b> was rapid, with 90 % of seeds germinating within 48 h of imbibition. Germination was reduced (20 %) at lower, suboptimal temperatures (10 to 20 C) when seeds of perennial <b>wall</b> <b>rocket</b> were exposed to light. Germination declined with increasing osmotic potential and was completely inhibited at osmotic potentials of − 1. 5 MPa. Perennial <b>wall</b> <b>rocket</b> emergence was greatest from seeds placed on the soil surface, but some seedlings...|$|R
