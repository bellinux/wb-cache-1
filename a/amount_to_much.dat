5|$|Van der Byl was {{appointed}} Minister of Foreign Affairs and Defence on 2 August 1974. These were two distinct portfolios, {{the first of}} which (Foreign Affairs) did not <b>amount</b> <b>to</b> <b>much</b> in a state which lacked any form of international recognition. The Defence portfolio, at a time when Rhodesia was drifting into civil war, was an important post; although his previous political experience had been largely in the area of public relations, he was now charged with responsibilities which were central to the survival of Rhodesia.|$|E
25|$|An elbow injury, which necessitated surgery, {{ended his}} county career in 1933, he {{was granted a}} {{testimonial}} which didn't <b>amount</b> <b>to</b> <b>much,</b> {{and turned to the}} Birmingham League where he sent down many more maidens for Kidderminster, Aston Unity and Old Hill before putting away his boots in 1948.|$|E
25|$|The {{death of}} Lord Richard {{was one of}} a number of events during 1978 that brought UDI to an abrupt end. The loss of one man did not <b>amount</b> <b>to</b> <b>much</b> in the whole scheme of things, but it was the {{identity}} of that man and the nature of his loss that had an impact. One factor that had sustained UDI since 1965 was tacit support from some elements in the British establishment who were variously influenced by anti-communism, appreciation of the colonial era's achievements and a wish to safeguard investments. Lord Richard was the embodiment of that support. His death brought the UDI project into question and made certain people think very hard about the wisdom of it.|$|E

500|$|However, some of {{the reviews}} were more negative. PALGN's Jeremy Jastrzab opined that [...] "Darkwatch gives vampires, undead, cowboys and plenty of bullets to fire. But that's about it. Otherwise, Darkwatch is a fairly {{standard}} affair that's worth a rental." [...] According to Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine, [...] "Darkwatch doesn't <b>amount</b> <b>to</b> <b>much</b> more than your run-of-the mill first-person shooter." [...] Eurogamer's Martin Coxall called it [...] "a generic and quickly tiresome shooter, with a contrived premise which, unfortunately, does nothing to elevate it." ...|$|E
500|$|Critics were {{positive}} towards the song. In the Entertainment Weekly {{review of the}} album, critic David Browne wrote: [...] "Songs like 'In My Place' and 'Warning Sign' marry lyrics imbued with deep regret and mistakes (...You were an island / And I passed you by in the touching latter song) with lyrical melodies and guitar hooks that twinkle and sparkle." [...] Adrien Begrand of PopMatters wrote: [...] "When the shimmering, pretty lead-off single 'In My Place' represents the album's weakest moment, you know you've got something extraordinary. Currently storming the charts a la 'Yellow', 'In My Place' is another surprisingly simple song, carried by Jonny Buckland's chiming guitar and Chris Martin’s heartfelt vocals. It really shouldn't <b>amount</b> <b>to</b> <b>much,</b> but Coldplay make it work very well. When Martin sings, [...] "Please, please, please/Come back and sing to me," [...] he totally sells it, and you buy it. And why not? The song's lovely.|$|E
500|$|Blue Shift {{received}} a mixed reaction from critics, holding overall scores of 67.40% and 71/100 [...] on the review aggregator sites GameRankings and Metacritic, respectively. The game has sold around 800,000 copies at retail (this figure {{does not include}} later sales on Steam). In a review for IGN, critic Tal Blevins noted that Blue Shifts gameplay [...] "is pretty much what we've come to expect out of Half-Life" [...] by blending action and puzzle solving, stating that the latter [...] "were all logical and well done, {{although some of the}} jumping puzzles were frustrating". Though IGN praised the game for maintaining the [...] "epic" [...] feel of the original, Blevins was critical of the relatively short length of the game. GameSpot reviewer Greg Kasavin agreed with many of IGN's criticisms, stating that [...] "it's not that the game is easy so much that it's extremely short" [...] and that Blue Shift [...] "doesn't <b>amount</b> <b>to</b> <b>much</b> on its own terms". In addition, Kasavin described the graphical enhancements brought about by the High Definition pack as [...] "helpful", but noted that [...] "they still don't make Half-Life look like a new game—nor are many of the changes themselves very noticeable".|$|E

500|$|In his December 1999 {{review for}} the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert gave the film {{a rating of}} three stars out of four. He {{described}} some of the animation, such as Firebird Suite, his favorite segment, as [...] "powerful" [...] though others, like the dance of the abstract triangles in Symphony No. 5, [...] "a little pedestrian". He admired Rhapsody in Blue and its interlocking stories, pointing out its style was reminiscent of the Madeline picture books by Ludwig Bemelmans. He thought Pines of Rome presented itself well in the IMAX format and found the Piano Concerto No. 2 played [...] "wonderfully as a self-contained film". He found The Sorcerer's Apprentice to be [...] "not as visually sharp {{as the rest of}} the film". He nonetheless described the film on the whole as [...] "splendid entertainment". Film critic Stephen Holden of The New York Times wrote that the film [...] "often has the feel of a giant corporate promotion whose stars are there simply to hawk the company's wares" [...] while noting the film [...] "is not especially innovative in its look or subject matter." [...] Firebird Suite was his favorite segment which left [...] "a lasting impression of the beauty, terror, and unpredictability of the natural world". He found The Sorcerer's Apprentice fit well with the rest of the film and the battle in Symphony No. 5 too abbreviated to <b>amount</b> <b>to</b> <b>much.</b> He found the segment with the whales failed in that the images [...] "quickly become redundant". He found Rhapsody in Blue to be the second-best in the film with its witty, hyper kinetic evocation of the melting pot with sharply defined characters. He found the segment with the flamingos cute and the one with the tin soldier to be romantic. James Berardinelli found the film to be of uneven quality. He felt Symphony No. 5 was [...] "dull and uninspired", the yo-yoing flamingos [...] "wasteful", and the New York City-based story of Rhapsody in Blue interesting but out of place in this particular movie. He found the story of the tin soldier to successfully mix its music with [...] "top-notch animation" [...] and [...] "an emotionally rewarding story". He felt the Firebird section was [...] "visually ingenious", and Pomp and Circumstance the most light-hearted episode and the one with the most appeal to children, in an otherwise adult-oriented film. To him The Sorcerer's Apprentice was an enduring classic.|$|E
2500|$|The {{immediate}} {{results of}} the operation were disastrous for {{the image of the}} Air Corps. Speaker of the House Henry T. Rainey, echoing comments made by Gen. Billy Mitchell, criticized: [...] "If we are unfortunate enough to be drawn into another war, the Air Corps wouldn’t <b>amount</b> <b>to</b> <b>much.</b> If it is not equal to carrying the mail, I {{would like to know what}} it would do in carrying bombs." [...] Despite the public humiliation, the Air Mail Fiasco resulted in a number of improvements for the Air Corps, bringing about changes that its previous publicity campaigns were unable to obtain.|$|E
2500|$|The Canadian Army was unimpressed at the headway {{made by the}} group. The general {{impression}} of the time was that aircraft would never <b>amount</b> <b>to</b> <b>much</b> in actual warfare. Despite official scepticism, the Association was finally invited to the military base at Camp Petawawa to demonstrate the aircraft. The sandy terrain made a poor runway for an aircraft with landing wheels about [...] wide. The Silver Dart had great difficulty taking off. On its fifth flight on 2 August 1909, McCurdy wrecked the craft when one wheel struck {{a rise in the}} ground while landing. The Silver Dart never flew again.|$|E

2500|$|There's {{no doubt}} Iraq hasn't fully {{complied}} with its disarmament obligations {{as set forth}} by the Security Council in its resolution. But on the other hand, since 1998 Iraq has been fundamentally disarmed: 90-95% of Iraq's {{weapons of mass destruction}} capacity has been verifiably eliminated... We have to remember that this missing 5-10% doesn't necessarily constitute a threat... It constitutes bits and pieces of a weapons program which in its totality doesn't <b>amount</b> <b>to</b> <b>much,</b> but which is still prohibited... We can't give Iraq a clean bill of health, therefore we can't close the book on their weapons of mass destruction. But simultaneously, we can't reasonably talk about Iraqi non-compliance as representing a de-facto retention of a prohibited capacity worthy of war. (page 28) ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1966, Patrick joined Rediffusion as an [...] "English Programme Announcer Grade 3", {{earning a}} salary of RM$150 a month. For the first three months, he {{was not allowed to}} enter the studio. Instead, he wrote scripts and picked out songs for 'Lunch Time Melodies'. At the end of the three months, he was allowed to work in the studio during non-peak hours, where his primary duty was to press buttons to air {{pre-recorded}} programmes. After six months, he was allowed to go on air, reading from pre-approved scripts. Within two years, Patrick was promoted to Assistant Programme Manager and a year after that, he was the Programme Manager for Rediffusion. A memorable moment of his tenure in the English Programme Department of Rediffusion was when Patrick was told by his then Department Supervisor that he would never <b>amount</b> <b>to</b> <b>much</b> in the industry because of his physical handicap (Patrick contracted polio when he was 7 years old). Patrick eventually replaced the man as English Programme Supervisor.|$|E
