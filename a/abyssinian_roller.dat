50|$|The <b>Abyssinian</b> <b>roller</b> {{is a large}} bird, {{nearly the}} size of a jackdaw at 28 - 30 cm. It has a warm brown back, {{with the rest of the}} plumage mainly blue. Adults have long (12 cm) tail streamers. Sexes are similar, but the {{juvenile}} is a drabber version of the adult. <b>Abyssinian</b> <b>roller</b> is striking in its strong direct flight, with the brilliant blues of the wings contrasting with the brown back and the long tail streamers trailing behind. The call of the <b>Abyssinian</b> <b>roller</b> is a harsh crow-like gak sound, or a screeched aaaargh.|$|E

5000|$|In the field, these crow-sized rollers {{are often}} perched {{alone on a}} tree in a grassy clearing. Lilac-breasted rollers are almost unmistakable with their bright plumage, but may be {{confused}} with <b>Abyssinian</b> <b>Rollers</b> in Turkana Basin of Kenya. For C. c. caudatus, look for a lilac throat that deepens into a darker lilac breast. The crown to mantle is olive, and the cheeks and ear coverts are a lilac-rufous. In the subspecies C. c. lorti, the crown to mantle is blue instead of olive, and the breast is azure. The throat is lilac, and some blue-throated rollers have a lilac patch on the lower abdomen. Both subspecies have long black outermost tail feathers that are absent in juveniles. Lilac-breasted rollers are not sexually dimorphic but males may be slightly larger than females. The average mass is 104 grams, and length ranges from 36 to 38 centimeters. These acrobatic fliers have an average wingspan range of 50 to 58 cm. [...] Unique to rollers (Coraciidae family) are syndactyl feet, in which {{the second and third}} digits are fused.|$|R

5000|$|The {{population}} {{trend for}} the <b>Abyssinian</b> <b>roller</b> {{is thought to}} be upward, as it exploits the opportunities provided by modern agricultural practices and urbanization. It has an extensive range, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of [...] "least concern".|$|E
50|$|The <b>Abyssinian</b> <b>roller</b> (Coracias abyssinicus), or Senegal roller, is {{a member}} of the roller family of birds which breeds across {{tropical}} Africa in a belt south of the Sahara, known as the Sahel. It is resident in the southern part of its range, but northern breeding populations are short-distance migrants, moving further south after the wet season.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Abyssinian</b> <b>roller</b> is {{native to}} {{tropical}} Africa. Its range extends from southern Mauritania and Senegal {{in the west and}} to Ethiopia, Somalia and northern Kenya in the east. It is also found in south-western Saudi Arabia and western Yemen. This is a common bird of warm open country with some trees, and has adapted to farmland and human habitation.|$|E
50|$|The rollers are {{medium-sized}} Old World {{birds of}} open woodland habitats. They have brightly coloured plumage and a hooked bill. Most are found {{south of the}} Sahara. The genus Coracias contains eight species of sit-and-wait hunters. The European roller is similar in appearance and behaviour to the <b>Abyssinian</b> <b>roller,</b> {{which appears to be}} its closest relative. These two birds and the lilac-breasted roller seem to share a common ancestry and could possibly be considered to form a subspecies.|$|E
50|$|There are 379 {{species of}} birds in the park {{including}} the contiguous Logone floodplain; among the birds that have been sighted are marbled duck, ferruginous duck, greater spotted eagle, scissor-tailed kite in grass lands, lesser kestrel, Nubian bustard (Neotis nuba), quail-plover, Arabian bustard Ardeotis arabs, hippos heron, hornbill, gross hopper, starks, <b>Abyssinian</b> <b>roller,</b> and fast moving ostrich. However, some of the species of global conservation concern are: Marmaronetta angustirostris, Aythya nyroca, Clanga clanga, Falco naumanni, Neotis nuba, which has been recorded once, in 1998.|$|E

50|$|The park {{is home to}} over 93 mammal species, and {{the large}} mammals of the park include an {{elephant}} population, hippos, buffalo, and warthogs. The park is considered a primary African preserve for antelope species including kob, defassa waterbuck, roan, hartebeest, oribi, the bushbuck, and two duikers, the red duiker and yellow-backed duiker. Olive baboons, black-and-white colobus monkeys, the green vervet, and patas monkeys are the known species of monkeys resident in the park. Of the 33 known species of reptiles slender-snouted and dwarf crocodile {{are found in the}} park. Sightings of hyenas, lions and leopards are unusual, but these carnivores were once more common in the park. Among the 344 listed bird species are the martial eagle, the white-headed and palm-nut vultures, saddle-billed storks, herons, egrets, the <b>Abyssinian</b> <b>roller,</b> the violet turaco, various shrikes and the red-throated bee-eater.|$|E
