The most generally useful strategy is to maintain variation across the genome, using methods that consider one or more of: population size, population structure, <b>animal</b> <b>selections,</b> mate allocations and information from genetic markers. A key reason to maintain genetic diversity is to facilitate longer-term genetic gains, and this means that most breeding programs need to consider genetic diversity as well as shorter-term genetic gains.

The Nguni, an {{indigenous}} cattle breed in South Africa,found {{in rural areas}} have not undergone the intensive selection programs that are used for the exotic and commercially-oriented breeds (Nguni Cattle Breed Society, 2011).

Cattle records for traits of economic importance are needed for accurate performance evaluation in terms of performance trends, selection criteria and mating system designs.

The usage of animal model in conjunction with residual maximum likelihood (REML) techniques for mixed models has revolutionized the methods. These methods to estimate quantitative genetic parameters have recently been advocated for use in evolutionary studies of natural populations. Therefore, it is perhaps timely to discuss the development of REML methods and their application to the analysis of artificial selection experiments and breeding programmes in animals. This should give extra insight into the methods and hopefully lead to synergy between both the areas...|$|E
