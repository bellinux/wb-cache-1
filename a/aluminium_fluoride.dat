2500|$|Silicon and {{silicon carbide}} readily react with all four stable halogens, forming the colourless, {{reactive}} and volatile silicon tetrahalides. Silicon tetrafluoride {{may also be}} made by fluorinating the other silicon halides, and is produced by the attack of hydrofluoric acid on glass. Heating two different tetrahalides together also produce a random mixture of mixed halides, which may also be produced by halogen exchange reactions. The melting and boiling points of these species usually rise with increasing atomic weight, though there are many exceptions: for example, the melting and boiling points drop as one passes from SiFBr3 through SiFClBr2 to SiFCl2Br. The shift from the hypoelectronic elements in group 13 and earlier to the group 14 elements {{is illustrated by the}} change from an infinite ionic structure in <b>aluminium</b> <b>fluoride</b> to a lattice of simple covalent silicon tetrafluoride molecules, as dictated by the lower electronegativity of aluminium than silicon, the stoichiometry (the +4 oxidation state being too high for true ionicity), and the smaller size of the silicon atom compared to the aluminium atom. Silicon tetrachloride is manufactured on a huge scale as a precursor to the production of pure silicon, silicon dioxide, and some silicon esters. The silicon tetrahalides hydrolyse readily in water, unlike the carbon tetrahalides, again because of the larger size of the silicon atom rendering it more open to nucleophilic attack and the ability of the silicon atom to expand its octet which carbon lacks. The reaction of silicon fluoride with excess hydrofluoric acid produces the octahedral hexafluorosilicate anion [...]|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the release of <b>aluminium</b> and <b>fluoride</b> from restorative materials placed in either deciduous or young permanent immature teeth stored in artificial saliva for 1 month. Cavities were prepared in extracted teeth, then filled with a fluoride releasing restorative (glass-ionomer, compomer or composite resin), with and without conditioning as appropriate. The teeth were then stored in artificial saliva for 1 month, after which the amount of <b>aluminium</b> and <b>fluoride</b> released was determined spectrophotometrically. With all materials tested, both <b>aluminium</b> and <b>fluoride</b> were released in all cases. Young immature teeth were associated with lower level of ion release which was attributed to the absorption of ions by the enamel. However, unconditioned samples were usually associated with similar ion release to conditioned ones, suggesting {{that the loss of}} mineral phase on conditioning has only a marginal effect on the capacity for ion uptake. The ratio of <b>aluminium</b> to <b>fluoride</b> released varied with the type of tooth, deciduous conditioned teeth generally absorbing proportionately less aluminium than young immature teeth. The overall conclusion is that interaction with ions released by restorative materials is influenced by type of tooth...|$|R

40|$|An {{increasing}} infertility due to pathological {{changes on}} sperm {{has become a}} serious issue. A rising concentration of fluorides in the environment could be a potentially negative factor affecting the male fertility. Eco-toxicological effect of fluorides can be enhanced in the present of aluminium ions by forming fluoro-metallic complexes, analogues of phosphate groups that interfere with the activity of G-proteins and P-type ATPases, which are part of several signalling pathways during sperm maturation. The aim of this thesis was monitoring the effect of fluorides on mouse sperm capacitation in vitro, analysis {{of the effect of}} fluorides on male reproductive organ and on the level of mouse spermatogenesis. Fluorides were administered to mice through table water at the concentrations of 0, 1, 10, 100 ppm {{and at the same time}} we monitored their synergic action with aluminium at 10 ppm dose. The level of tyrosine phosphorylation in the sperm head was the main marker for successful capacitation in vitro.

40|$|Although the {{principles}} {{for the treatment}} of sensitive teeth are demonstrated successfully by many, the current treatments for tooth hypersensitivity are not effective in the long term or as a permanent solution. The purpose of this research project was to investigate the occlusion of dentinal tubules by calcium phosphate minerals doped with erbium, <b>aluminium,</b> and <b>fluoride</b> compounds under laser irradiation. The investigation included the synthesis and characterisation of calcium phosphate (CaP) powders, preparation of hypersensitive dentine sections, and coating of dentine sections with CaP powders followed by laser irradiation. CaP powders were synthesised by the chemical precipitation and hydrothermal methods. These powders were also chemically modified by the addition of different compounds (dopants) under various conditions to achieve substitutions for calcium, phosphate, and hydroxyl ions in the CaP structure. Dopants’ compounds included erbium compounds (erbium oxide and erbium nitrate) to produce photoactive CaP minerals, aluminium compounds (aluminium phosphate and <b>aluminium</b> nitrate) and <b>fluoride</b> compounds (calcium fluoride and ammonium fluoride) to produce CaP minerals with high mechanical, chemical, and thermal stability. As well as chemically modifying the structure of CaP, {{the size and shape of}} CaP particles were investigated by varying pH and temperature of the synthesis method. The chemically modified CaP minerals were applied onto hypersensitive dentine sections by the dip coating method and laser irradiated by CW and pulsed lasers to achieve a complete occlusion of open dentinal tubules. CaP powders in the form of pellets were also prepared for laser irradiation and acid erosion trials to determine their interaction with laser irradiation and solubility behaviour in an acid environment, respectively. CaP powders, CaP pellets, and laser irradiated – coated dentine sections were characterised using various analysis techniques, including SEM, SEM-EDX, static laser scattering, XRD, FTIR, DSC, ICP/MS, Micro – hardness, and Profile roughness. ...|$|R

Enhancement of the magneto-optic Kerr effect signal contrast {{of a factor}} 1. 76 has been observed for P- polarized incident light on a trilayer configuration of <b>aluminium,</b> magnesium <b>fluoride,</b> and permalloy. A quadrilayer structure where the trilayer is overcoated with zinc sulphide enhances the signal contrast by a factor 4. 05 for P-polarized light.

The experimental data are compared to a simplified theoretical model where the electric field components are calculated using a 4 x 4 matrix algorithm. The model {{is found to be}} inadequate in predicting the longitudinal magneto-optic Kerr effect response from complex multilayer structures.
