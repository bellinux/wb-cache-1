5|$|The party, or parties, {{that hold}} the {{majority}} of seats in the Parliament forms the Scottish Government. In contrast to many other parliamentary systems, Parliament elects a First Minister {{from a number of}} candidates {{at the beginning of each}} parliamentary term (after a general election). Any member can put their name forward to be First Minister, and a vote is taken by all members of Parliament. Normally, the leader of the largest party is returned as First Minister, and head of the Scottish Government. Theoretically, Parliament also elects the Scottish Ministers who form the government of Scotland <b>and</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> the Scottish cabinet, but such ministers are, in practice, appointed to their roles by the First Minister. Junior ministers, who do not attend cabinet, are also appointed to assist Scottish ministers in their departments. Most ministers and their juniors are drawn from amongst the elected MSPs, with the exception of Scotland's Chief Law Officers: the Lord Advocate and the Solicitor General. Whilst the First Minister chooses the ministers – and may decide to remove them at any time – the formal appointment or dismissal is made by the Sovereign.|$|E

25|$|Crandon {{performed}} {{many of her}} séances in the nude, and {{was reported}} to throw herself onto the laps of her male sitters. She was also described as an alcoholic. During séances, Eric Dingwall told Crandon to take off her clothes <b>and</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> the nude. Crandon would also sometimes sprinkle luminous powder on her breasts and because of such activities William McDougall and other psychical researchers criticized Dingwall for having improper relations with Crandon.|$|E

25|$|An astrologer {{claimed that}} he was able to {{ascertain}} a person's astrological sign after talking with them for a few minutes. He was presented with twelve people, one at a time, each with a different astrological sign. They could not tell the astrologer their astrological sign or birth date, nor could they wear anything that would indicate it. After the astrologer talked to them, he had them go <b>and</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> front of the astrological sign that the astrologer thought was theirs. By agreement, the astrologer needed to get ten of the 12 correct, to win. He got none correct.|$|E

25|$|The Revolution {{permanently}} ended {{any chance}} of Catholicism becoming re-established in England. For British Catholics its effects were disastrous both socially and politically: Catholics were {{denied the right to}} vote <b>and</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> the Westminster Parliament for over a century; they were also denied commissions in the army, and the monarch was forbidden to be Catholic or to marry a Catholic, this latter prohibition remaining in force until 2015. The Revolution led to limited tolerance for Nonconformist Protestants, although it would be some time before they had full political rights. It has been argued, mainly by Whig historians, that James's overthrow began modern English parliamentary democracy: the Bill of Rights 1689 {{has become one of the}} most important documents in the political history of Britain and never since has the monarch held absolute power.|$|E
25|$|Both Art and Horace were very, {{very aware}} of {{what they wanted to}} do. They wanted {{to get away from the}} jazz scene of the early '50s, which was the Birdland scene—you hire Phil Woods or Charlie Parker or J. J. Johnson, they come <b>and</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> with the house rhythm section, and they only play blues and {{standards}} that everybody knows. There's no rehearsal, there's no thought given to the audience. Both Horace and Art knew that the only way to get the jazz audience back and make it bigger than ever was to really make music that was memorable and planned, where you consider the audience and keep everything short. They really liked digging into blues and gospel, things with universal appeal. So they put together what was to be called the Jazz Messengers.|$|E
500|$|During the {{recording}} of The Wall, Waters, Gilmour and Mason became increasingly dissatisfied with Wright's lack of contribution to the album. Gilmour said that Wright [...] "hadn't contributed anything of any value whatsoever to the album—he did very, very little" [...] and this was why he [...] "got the boot". According to Mason, [...] "Rick's contribution was to turn up <b>and</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> on the sessions without doing anything, just 'being a producer'." [...] Waters commented: [...] " [...] {{was not prepared to}} cooperate in making the record... it was agreed by everybody... either [...] can have a long battle or [...] can agree to... finish making the album, keep [...] full share... {{but at the end of}} it [...] leave quietly. Rick agreed." ...|$|E

The day began at 6am, changing into costumes and getting onto the actors' bus, which {{took them to the}} sets in Kanuria. The actors, including Aamir, all travelled on the same bus. If anyone missed it, it was up to them to reach the sets. One day, Aamir was late and missed the actors' bus. That day, his wife Reena, the executive producer, reprimanded him for being late. She told him he had to set an example {{for the rest of the}} crew. [...] "If he started coming late, how could she tell the others to come on time?" [...] While on the sets, the actors were given call sheets with the day's timetable such as breakfast, hair styling, make-up, costumes, etc.|$|E
500|$|The House of Lords Act 1999 {{provides}} firstly that [...] "No-one {{shall be}} a member of the House of Lords by virtue of a hereditary peerage." [...] (The Act treats the Principality of Wales and the Earldom of Chester as hereditary peerages, though those titles, granted normally to the heir-apparent, are never inherited.) The Act then provides that 92 peers, including the Earl Marshal, the Lord Great Chamberlain and 90 other peers elected in accordance with the Standing Orders of the House, would be excepted from the exclusion of hereditary peers, and that after the first session of the next Parliament, whenever one of these seats fell vacant, the Lords would have to proceed to a by-election. The Act also provided that a hereditary peer would be entitled to vote in elections for, <b>and</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in,</b> the House of Commons, unless he or she was a member of the House of Lords. Previously, hereditary peers had been constitutionally disqualified from being electors to, or members of, the House of Commons.
