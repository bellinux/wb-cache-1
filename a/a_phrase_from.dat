His essays were published in a series entitled This View of Life (<b>a</b> <b>phrase</b> <b>from</b> the concluding paragraph of Charles Darwin's Origin of Species) starting from January 1974 and ended in January 2001, amounting to a continuous publication of 300 essays. Many of his essays were reprinted in collected volumes that became bestselling books such as Ever Since Darwin and The Panda's Thumb, Hen's Teeth and Horse's Toes, and The Flamingo's Smile.|$|E
5|$|Mozart had a pet common {{starling}} {{which could}} sing {{part of his}} Piano Concerto in G Major (KV. 453). He had bought it from a shop after hearing it sing <b>a</b> <b>phrase</b> <b>from</b> a work he wrote six weeks previously, which {{had not yet been}} performed in public. He became very attached to the bird and arranged an elaborate funeral for it when it died three years later. It has been suggested that his A Musical Joke (K. 522) might be written in the comical, inconsequential style of a starling's vocalisation. Other people who have owned common starlings report how adept they are at picking up phrases and expressions. The words have no meaning for the starling, so they often mix them up or use them on what to humans are inappropriate occasions in their songs. Their ability at mimicry is so great that strangers have looked in vain for the human they think they have just heard speak.|$|E
5|$|The Urban District Council {{received}} its {{coat of arms}} from the College of Heralds in 1957. After the change to borough status a modified coat of arms, based on the original, was awarded in 1976, and presented to the council on 24 March 1977. It features a central cross on a shield, representing the town's location at the meeting point of north–south and east–west roads. The shield bears nine martlets representing both the county of Sussex and the new town's original nine neighbourhoods.

25|$|His {{international}} {{career was}} also affected by his strong Christian beliefs, as {{he refused to}} play on Sundays. Although he was selected for the 1987 and 1991 All Black World Cup squads, he missed three Sunday games in the 1991 tournament due to his religious beliefs. Jones was omitted from the 1995 squad {{as he would have}} been unavailable for the quarterfinal and semifinal games. He was once asked how a Christian such as himself could be such an uncompromising tackler. In reply he quoted <b>a</b> <b>phrase</b> <b>from</b> the Bible: is better to give than receive.|$|E

25|$|Early Modern English as a {{literary}} medium was unfixed in structure and vocabulary in comparison to Greek and Latin, and was {{in a constant state}} of flux. When William Shakespeare began writing his plays, the English language was rapidly absorbing words from other languages due to wars, exploration, diplomacy and colonization. By the age of Elizabeth, English had become widely used with the expansion of philosophy, theology and physical sciences, but many writers lacked the vocabulary to express such ideas. To accommodate, writers such as Edmund Spenser, Sir Philip Sidney, Christopher Marlowe and William Shakespeare expressed new ideas and distinctions by inventing, borrowing or adopting a word or <b>a</b> <b>phrase</b> <b>from</b> another language, known as neologizing. Scholars estimate that, between the years 1500 and 1659, nouns, verbs and modifiers of Latin, Greek and modern Romance languages added 30,000 new words to the English language.|$|E
25|$|Her {{powers in}} the musicals are based on both her anime and manga incarnations. In Last Dracul she heads to the enemy hideout alone only to have her attacks fail; In the revised version of Transylvania no Mori she laments that <b>a</b> <b>phrase</b> <b>from</b> a game similar to Red light Green light is more useful than her most {{powerful}} attack when dealing with the Sammael Quartet. Conversely, in the same musicals {{she is able to}} combine her powers with Sailor Moon for multiple powerful attacks that damage/heal enemies. It is only in the fourth season of the anime that she gains a more relevant role as Pegasus gives her a new compact to become Super Sailor Chibi Moon for the first time, and she becomes the only one able to summon him to give assistance to Sailor Moon in performing the attacks that defeat the enemies' minions.|$|E

[...] Borrowing <b>a</b> <b>phrase</b> <b>from</b> Frederick Douglass, he popularized {{the use of the term}} color line to represent the injustice of the separate but equal doctrine prevalent in American social and political life.

500|$|Bryan {{had long}} planned {{to run for}} president. Although he would only be 36 years old in 1896—one year above the {{constitutional}} minimum—he believed the silver question could carry him {{not only to the}} nomination, but to the presidency. He traveled widely, speaking to audiences across the nation. His speeches impressed many; even some of his opponents later conceded that Bryan was the most compelling speaker they had ever heard. Bryan's speeches evolved over time; in December 1894, in a speech in Congress, he first used <b>a</b> <b>phrase</b> <b>from</b> which would come the conclusion to his most famous address: as originally stated, it was [...] "I will not help to crucify mankind upon a cross of gold." ...|$|E

500|$|He first {{considered}} doing {{a documentary}} or a low-budget feature film {{about people who}} believed in UFOs.

[...] Borrowing <b>a</b> <b>phrase</b> <b>from</b> the ending of The Thing from Another World, he retitled the film Watch the Skies, rewriting the premise concerning Project Blue Book and pitching the concept to Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz. Katz remembered [...] "It had flying saucers from outer space landing on Robertson Boulevard [...] I go, 'Steve, that's the worst idea I ever heard." [...] Spielberg brought Paul Schrader to write the script in December 1973 with principal photography to begin in late 1974.

500|$|Leng {{has named}} Living in the Material World as his {{personal}} favourite {{of all of}} Harrison's solo albums.

Eder likewise welcomes Material Worlds bold idealism, saying: [...] "Even {{in the summer of}} 1973, after years of war and strife and disillusionment, some of us were still sort of looking – to borrow <b>a</b> <b>phrase</b> <b>from</b> a Lennon–McCartney song – or hoping to get from them something like 'the word' that would make us free.

500|$|<b>A</b> <b>phrase</b> <b>from</b> The Tempest is {{mentioned}} by Gorkon as representing the new galactic order, {{that of a}} [...] "brave new world". Chang recites most of the lines from Shakespeare used in the film, including quotes from Romeo and Juliet and Henry IV, Part 2 in his parting words to Kirk after dinner. During Kirk's trial, Chang also mocks Kirk with lines from Richard II. The final battle above Khitomer contains seven references to five of Shakespeare's plays. Two references are drawn from the title character's lines in King Henry V ("Once more unto the breach"/"The game's afoot"), while two more quotations are from Julius Caesar ("I am as constant as the Northern Star"/"Cry 'havoc!' and let slip the dogs of war"). There is a single reference to Prospero from The Tempest ("Our revels now are ended"), and Chang shortens the wronged Shylock's speech from The Merchant of Venice: [...] "Tickle us, do we not laugh; prick us, do we not bleed; and wrong us, shall we not revenge?" ...|$|E
