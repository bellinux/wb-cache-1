5|$|Round two {{consisted}} of five questions posed to the players. The host read a question, {{and one of}} the contestants buzzed-in and provided a response. Their response, along with two other choices, were provided to the other two contestants, who selected one of the choices. Correct answers earned three spins for a buzz-in <b>answer</b> <b>and</b> one spin for a multiple choice answer. After five questions, all three contestants advanced to the final round.|$|E
5|$|The Byzantine emperor {{was said}} to have been infuriated with the <b>answer</b> <b>and</b> {{the fact that he was}} outsmarted. However, Michael III who was {{informed}} of the conflict between Andronikos III and Andronikos II hinted him that he could help Andronikos III against his grandfather in case of war and returned to Bulgaria promising that soon he would begin negotiations.|$|E
5|$|Each episode {{consists}} of three rounds. A team of four contestants starts the game; one player is eliminated after two rounds of play. For each question, the team has 60 seconds to unanimously agree on an answer; the available money decreases the longer it takes. Each contestant must enter the same response on their respective panel and then everyone must simultaneously lock in an <b>answer</b> <b>and</b> stop the clock. If the team answers the question correctly, they bank whatever money is left on the clock; if they are wrong, or if time runs out, their bank is reduced by half.|$|E
40|$|The authors {{investigate}} {{the interplay between}} <b>answer</b> quality <b>and</b> <b>answer</b> speed across question types in community question-answering sites (CQAs). The research questions addressed are the following: (a) How do <b>answer</b> quality <b>and</b> <b>answer</b> speed vary across question types? (b) How do the relationships between <b>answer</b> quality <b>and</b> <b>answer</b> speed vary across question types? (c) How do the best quality <b>answers</b> <b>and</b> the fastest <b>answers</b> differ in terms of <b>answer</b> quality <b>and</b> <b>answer</b> speed across question types? (d) How do trends in answer quality vary over time across question types? From the posting of 3, 000 questions in six CQAs, 5, 356 <b>answers</b> were harvested <b>and</b> analyzed. There {{was a significant difference}} in <b>answer</b> quality <b>and</b> <b>answer</b> speed across question types, and there were generally no significant relationships between <b>answer</b> quality <b>and</b> <b>answer</b> speed. The best quality answers had better overall answer quality than the fastest answers but generally took longer to arrive. In addition, although the trend in answer quality had been mostly random across all question types, the quality of answers appeared to improve gradually when given time. By highlighting the subtle nuances in <b>answer</b> quality <b>and</b> <b>answer</b> speed across question types, this study is an attempt to explore a territory of CQA research that has hitherto been relatively uncharted...|$|R

5|$|In this bonus round, {{each member}} of the winning team plays the same {{question}} individually. While the first contestant is asked the question, the second is isolated offstage so that they cannot see or hear the question. The two teammates have a total of 40 seconds to answer (in seasons 1 and 2, the time limit was 30 seconds); the clock stops when the first contestant submits an <b>answer,</b> <b>and</b> resumes when the second contestant first sees the question. If one team member answers the question correctly, they receive an additional $1,000; if both answer correctly, their winnings are augmented to $10,000.|$|E
5|$|Jameson did {{not regard}} this {{ambiguity}} as a proper <b>answer,</b> <b>and</b> impatiently waited for further {{word from the}} king. After standing by for the specified two days and receiving nothing, he correctly concluded that Lobengula was stalling him, and using the extra time {{to distance himself from}} his former capital. Jameson therefore made good on his pledge, and called for volunteers; he assembled a host of about 470 men, mixed together from the Mashonaland Mounted Police, the Bechuanaland Border Police, and Raaff's Rangers, an independent unit led by the eponymous Commandant Piet Raaff. This force was placed under Forbes's command, with three Maxim guns attached. Jameson told the major to scout the area between Shiloh and Inyati for spoor, with the ultimate objective of capturing Lobengula, and sent him out just before sunset on 14 November 1893.|$|E
5|$|Suzy gets {{a job at}} {{a burger}} joint, and moves into an {{abandoned}} boiler, with entry through the attached pipe. Doc is unhappy, and Hazel decides {{something has to be done}} ("Thinkin' "). He is unable to come up with an <b>answer,</b> <b>and</b> eventually forgets the question. Some weeks pass, and Joe the Mexican woos Suzy. He has no success, and his attempts irritate Doc. The next day, Doc himself approaches the pipe with flowers in hand ("How Long?"), still uncertain as to why he is seeking a girl like Suzy. Suzy lets him in the boiler, which she has fitted up in a homelike manner. She is doing well at the burger joint, but is grateful to Fauna for giving her confidence. She is confident enough, indeed, to reject Doc, who is unhappy, but philosophical ("The Next Time It Happens").|$|E

5|$|Upon {{his return}} to office, Kogălniceanu {{personally}} organized conspiratorial meetings with the Russian diplomat Aleksandr Nelidov, and approved Russian demands in exchange for co-belligerency. With C. A. Rosetti and Brătianu, he supported the transit of Russian troops and persuaded Carol to accept the Russian alliance, contrary to the initial advice of the Crown Council. He also sought advice on this matter from the French Third Republic, who was {{still one of the}} powers supervising Romania; Louis, duc Decazes, the French Foreign Minister, declined to give him a reassuring <b>answer,</b> <b>and</b> pointed that, were Romania to join up with Russia, the other powers would cease offering their protection. Making note of this, Kogălniceanu expressed his hope that France would still support his country at the decisive moment.|$|E

5|$|Before his trial, Tony {{attempts}} suicide. Whitney {{tries to}} visit but is refused, and Bianca {{sees it as}} a form of manipulation. Tony repeatedly attempts to contact Whitney by phone, but after {{the first day of the}} trial, he flushes the SIM card down the toilet in his cell. When Whitney's brother Ryan Malloy (Neil McDermott) tries to attack Tony in court, Whitney says she will refuse to testify, claiming her witness statement was a lie and she was forced to say it. Bianca explains to Whitney that Tony will be set free and that he will target other children. Tony's barrister, Mrs Taylor (Jacqueline Defferary), cross-examines Whitney, trying to imply that she pursued him for several years, saying she refused to take 'no' for an <b>answer</b> <b>and</b> lied about the accusations. Tony shouts out that he is innocent but Whitney says she trusted him and he abused her, revealing the truth about the relationship. After leaving the courtroom, Whitney gives her barrister, Vivien Easley QC (Geraldine Alexander), a mobile phone with messages from Tony on it. A week later Tony is found guilty of all charges and sentenced to 13 years in custody. He smirks as the verdict is being read out but is taken away with his head in his hands.|$|E
5|$|On June 10, the Lithuanian {{government}} {{discussed the}} new developments. It decided that Merkys {{should return to}} Kaunas and Urbšys should deliver a note offering withdrawal from the Baltic Entente, a full investigation of the incident, and dismissal of Skučas and Povilaitis. A personal letter from President Antanas Smetona to Chairman of Presidium of the Supreme Soviet Mikhail Kalinin repeated assurances that Lithuania always honored the mutual assistance pact. The third and final meeting between Merkys, Urbšys, and Molotov on June 11 brought no resolution. The Soviets continued to press charges which the Lithuanians could not meaningfully <b>answer</b> <b>and</b> made no more actionable requests. On June 12, Merkys returned to Lithuania and informed {{the government of the}} situation. It was decided that Skučas should resign and Povilaitis would be immediately dismissed. The Lithuanian Army was ordered to be alert, but no orders were issued regarding mobilization or preparedness. Lithuanian politicians did not fully understand the gravity of the situation and did not think the results would be catastrophic. Urbšys reported that the Soviets strongly disapproved of Merkys and his cabinet; he suggested that a new government be installed, possibly led by Stasys Raštikis, former Commander-in-Chief of the Lithuanian Army. Such suggestion interfered with Lithuania's domestic affairs.|$|E
5|$|The core game {{is based}} on Hangman. Each round has a {{category}} and a blank word puzzle, with each blank representing a letter in the <b>answer,</b> <b>and</b> punctuation revealed as needed. Most puzzles are straightforward figures of speech that fit within a mostly static list of categories, and this list has evolved {{over the course of}} the series. Crossword puzzles were added to the rotation in 2016. In such rounds, a clue bonding the words in the puzzle is given instead of a traditional category, and contestants win by solving all the words in the crossword. The titular Wheel of Fortune is a roulette-style wheel mechanism with 24 spaces, most of which are labeled with dollar amounts ranging from $500 to $900, plus a top dollar value: $2,500 in round 1, $3,500 in rounds 2 and 3, and $5,000 for round 4 and any subsequent rounds. The wheel also features two Bankrupt wedges and one Lose a Turn, both of which forfeit the contestant's turn, with the former also eliminating any cash or prizes the contestant has accumulated within the round. Each game features three contestants, or occasionally, three two-contestant teams positioned behind a single scoreboard with its own flipper. The left scoreboard from the viewer's perspective is colored red, the center yellow, and the right blue, with the contestants' positions determined by a random selection prior to taping.|$|E

5|$|The exam {{is offered}} {{every year in}} May. Students are not {{expected}} to memorize any formulas; rather, a list of common statistical formulas related to descriptive statistics, probability, and inferential statistics is provided. Moreover, tables for the normal, Student's t and chi-squared distributions are given as well. Students are also expected to use graphing calculators with statistical capabilities. The exam is three hours long with ninety minutes allotted to complete each of its two sections: multiple choice and free-response. The multiple choice portion of the exam consists of forty questions with five possible answers each. The free response section contains six open-ended questions that are often long and divided into multiple parts. The first five of these questions may require twelve minutes each to <b>answer</b> <b>and</b> normally relate to one topic or category. The sixth question consists of a broad-ranging investigative task and may require approximately twenty-five minutes to answer.|$|E

Many will say turn awayaway from this man, for he is not a man but a demon, a monster, a subverter and an enemy of the black manand we will smile. They will say that he is of hatea fanatic, a racistwho can only bring evil to the cause for which you struggle! And we will <b>answer</b> <b>and</b> say to them: Did you ever talk to Brother Malcolm? Did you ever touch him, or have him smile at you? Did you ever really listen to him? Did he ever do a mean thing? Was he ever himself associated with violence or any public disturbance? For if you did you would know him. And if you knew him you would know why we must honor him... And, in honoring him, we honor the best in ourselves.|$|E
