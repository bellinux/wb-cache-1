40|$|Icing {{detection}} and de-icing techniques {{play an important}} role to assure a safe operation of airplanes and wind turbines [1, 2]. Integration of piezoceramics in structural parts allow for additional functionalities like health monitoring, impact {{detection and}} even to solve icing problems. The paper deals with innovative sheet-metal compounds, consisting of a piezomodule in a layer of adhesive embedded between two aluminum sheets. An airfoil demonstrator structure with integrated piezomodules is used for icing detection. A special production and forming technology was presented in earlier studies, where forming takes place in a viscous condition of adhesive. This concept allows for a forming of brittle piezoceramic fibers inside the compound. This demonstrator structure was built with this production technology. The integrated sensor is used for a detection of <b>additional</b> local <b>masses.</b> Aim is the implementation for aerodynamic icing detection and a vibration assisted de-icing. Within the paper preliminary tests for an icing detection are described. Therefore impedance and loss angle of an integrated piezomodule are measured for a broad frequency range under variation of <b>additional</b> <b>masses</b> and temperature. Icing was performed inside a cold chamber at - 40 °C. It is shown that the impedance is significantly influenced by <b>additional</b> <b>masses</b> at room temperature, by a reduction of temperature without <b>additional</b> <b>masses</b> and by <b>additional</b> <b>masses</b> (ice) at reduced temperatures. The results imply that the assumptions are correct and the continuative investigations are worthwhile to potentially develop an icing detection technology...|$|R

In his 1805 book Celestial Mechanics, in addition to laying out his mathematical argument for the resonant orbits of Io, Europa, and Ganymede, Laplace was able to use perturbations on the orbit of Io by Europa and Ganymede to provide the first estimate of Io's mass, 1.73 of the mass of Jupiter, which was one-quarter of the modern value.

Io's diameter was estimated using micrometer measurements and occultations of background stars by Io. Edward E.

While this is 20% less than the currently accepted value, it was enough for astronomers to note the differences between the densities of the inner two Galilean satellites (Io and Europa) versus the outer two Galilean satellites (Ganymede and Callisto). The densities of Io and Europa suggested that they were composed primarily of rock while Ganymede and Callisto contained more ices.|$|E

The {{aim is to}} maximize the critical flow speed of the fluid by means of <b>additional</b> <b>masses,</b> supporting springs or dampers {{along the length of}} the pipe. The optimization problem was formulated by modelling the pipe by FEM, using Euler-Bernoulli beam elements. The locations of the <b>additional</b> <b>masses,</b> springs and dampers and the properties of these elements (mass, spring constant and damping constant) were chosen as design parameters. The maximization problem for the critical fluid flow speed was solved by the sequential quadratic programming (SQP) technique. In addition to the presentation of the optimal values obtained for the design parameters, some aspects of the sensitiveness of the systems to variations in these parameters and the robustness of the optimum designs with respect to the stability of the system are studied. Although a considerable increase in the critical flow velocity of the fluid can be achieved in the example cases studied here, a marked sensitivity of the system to the location and properties of the additional elements in the optimum designs was observed. Also, the margin with respect to stability seems to be relatively small in some of the optimum designs considered. Non-linear numerical analysis confirmed the findings of the linear analysis with respect to the sensitivity of the optimum designs to the properties of the additional elements and revealed a very rich post-critical dynamic behaviour in the optimized structures...|$|R
