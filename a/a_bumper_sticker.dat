500|$|The title [...] "Rust in Peace" [...] was {{inspired}} by <b>a</b> <b>bumper</b> <b>sticker</b> that Mustaine saw {{on the back of}} a vehicle while driving home from Lake Elsinore, California. The sticker read: 'May all your nuclear weapons rust in peace'. Mustaine liked the concept and decided to use it as a title for Megadeth's upcoming album. Rust in Peace was recorded in Rumbo Studios with producer Mike Clink, while the mixing was handled by Max Norman. Clink was brought in for his work on both Guns N' Roses' Appetite for Destruction and UFO's Strangers in the Night. The producer's work dealt mostly with the bass, drums and Friedman's guitar. In a 2002 interview, Mustaine declared that they [...] "really didn’t make the record with [...] " [...] as at the time he was focused on Guns N' Roses' Use Your Illusion I and II — which were also being recorded at Rumbo — and stated most of the work in the album was done by himself, Norman, and engineer Micajah Ryan.|$|E
500|$|Gore was a speculated {{candidate}} for the 2004 Presidential Election (<b>a</b> <b>bumper</b> <b>sticker,</b> [...] "Re-elect Gore in 2004!" [...] was popular). On December 16, 2002, however, Gore {{announced that he would}} not run in 2004. Despite Gore taking himself out of the race, a handful of his supporters formed a national campaign to draft him into running. One observer concluded it was [...] "Al Gore who has the best chance to defeat the incumbent president", noting that [...] "of the 43 Presidents, only three have been direct descendents of former Presidents:" [...] John Quincy Adams, Benjamin Harrison, and George W. Bush, that [...] "all three won the office only after... anomalies in the Electoral College", that the first two were defeated for re-election in a populist backlash, and finally that [...] "the men who first lost to the presidential progeny and then beat them" [...] (i.e. Andrew Jackson and Grover Cleveland) [...] "each won a sort of immortality—having his image placed on a unit of US currency", and that Gore should answer this call of history. The draft movement, however, failed to convince Gore to run.|$|E

500|$|The episode's {{title is}} a {{reference}} to the film Viva Las Vegas (1964).

Outside Rev. Lovejoy's church is a notice that today's sermon will be 'He Knows What You Did Last Summer', which is {{a reference to the}} title of the 1997 slasher film I Know What You Did Last Summer. As Homer and Ned escape from Vegas, a snippet of the theme from the 1996 comic science fiction film Mars Attacks! can be heard. The Comic Book Guy's license plate is NCC-1701, which is also the registration of the USS Enterprise, a fictional starship from the Star Trek media franchise. He also has <b>a</b> <b>bumper</b> <b>sticker</b> which reads [...] "my other car is the Millennium Falcon" [...] which was given to him by somebody who looked like the actor Harrison Ford; the Millennium Falcon was the ship used by Ford's character Han Solo in the Star Wars film series. The line Homer gives after Ned signs the contract is a reference to the 1997 film The Game.|$|E

McVeigh wore a printed T-shirt with the motto of the Commonwealth of Virginia, Sic semper tyrannis ("Thus always to tyrants", according to legend what Brutus said as he assassinated Julius Caesar, also shouted by John Wilkes Booth immediately after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln) and [...] "The tree of liberty must be refreshed {{from time to time}} with the blood of patriots and tyrants" [...] (from Thomas Jefferson).

Noting that the high percentage of oil drilled in the Middle East gives vast profits to Middle Eastern regimes, Woolsey believes that it is a patriotic obligation to drive more efficient vehicles. In a Motor Trend magazine article, Woolsey stated that those oil profits find their way to terrorist groups like al-Qaeda, meaning that Americans who buy inefficient vehicles would, in effect, be indirectly funding terrorism. [...] "We're paying for both sides in this war, and that's not a good long-term strategy," [...] said Woolsey.

2500|$|Throughout the 1980s, Al Seckel {{was active}} in the Freethought movement. In this {{capacity}} he authored a number of articles and pamphlets. He also edited two books on the English rationalist philosopher Bertrand Russell. In 1983, Seckel and John Edwards co-created the Darwin fish design, which was first sold as <b>a</b> <b>bumper</b> <b>sticker</b> and on T-shirts in 1983–84 by a southern California group called Atheists United. Chris Gilman, a Hollywood prop maker, manufactured the first plastic car ornaments in 1990, and licensed the design to Evolution Design of Austin, Texas. When the emblem evolved into a million-dollar business, Evolution Design began threatening to sue distributors of look-alike and derivative products (like a Jewish [...] "gefilte" [...] fish). Seckel in turn sued Evolution Design for copyright infringement. Seckel did not seek royalties, but wanted Evolution Design to allow free use of the design by anyone authorized by him. Although Seckel was able to produce examples of the design that predated Gilman's claimed 1990 copyright date, the suit was settled when it became apparent that Seckel and Edwards had allowed the design to fall into public domain.|$|E
