2500|$|Blake {{was given}} {{command of the}} gunboat [...] {{stationed}} in the James River, engaged in transporting troops and in occasional engagements with the enemy. The {{most important of these}} was on 24 January 1865, when a powerful Confederate squadron launched an attack on the Union blockade of the river at Trent's Reach. Sailing downriver the Confederate force drove away the Union pickets, and commenced removing the boom and obstructions. William A. Parker, the Union naval commander, instead protecting the defences, retired and allowed them to be removed, leaving a clear passage for the enemy. However, two rams went aground, and the Confederates had to wait until high water the following night before proceeding. On the morning of the 25th, Parker was relieved of his command and Blake was made temporary commander of the naval division. Blake ordered the monitor [...] to put herself into a position within the range of enemy batteries, such that, if sunk, she would take the place of the removed obstructions. Subsequent attacks by Union ships and shore batteries sank two and badly damaged six of the Confederate ships, who eventually withdrew. After dark a party from Eutaw, commanded by Acting-Ensign Thomas Morgan boarded the abandoned [...] and re-floated her, finding her not <b>as</b> <b>damaged</b> <b>as</b> believed. In a letter Admiral David Dixon Porter wrote to Blake, [...] "Had your predecessor done as well, we should now be in possession of the entire rebel navy, and on our way to Richmond." [...] Blake continued to command the ironclads and naval picket line until the fall of Richmond and end of the war in April 1865. He was then {{was in charge of the}} removal of the torpedoes and obstructions from the James River.|$|E

The aircraft is considered to have been completely destroyed by the impact and the following explosion, and on 22 March work began on moving debris from the temporary investigative base in Nikkaluokta near the crash site to an aircraft hangar at Kiruna Airport, but efforts were still being hampered by adverse weather and the discovery of further cracks in the glacier on which the debris is located. In August 2012 both the cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder were found and flown to the United Kingdom where experts at the Air Accidents Investigation Branch are aiding local authorities in salvaging data from the two recorders as Sweden {{does not have the}} expertise to handle flight recorders <b>as</b> <b>damaged</b> <b>as</b> the ones found in the wreckage. By 3 October 2012 NRK reported that data from the flight recorders had been successfully downloaded, and preliminary results have indicated that the terrain warning system was set for landing, so no warning was given before impact.|$|E

The announcement of sanctions met very harsh criticism among Serbian media and political writers and reflected a divide between the actions of the Serbian government and the opinions of Serbian citizens. Professor Predrag Simić of the UB Faculty of Political Science {{said in an interview with}} S Media that Iran seemed to be tolerant of the Serbian government's accession into the EU, and inferred that it was possible that relations with Iran would not be <b>as</b> <b>damaged</b> <b>as</b> they are with other western nation's despite Serbia's sanctions. In 2013, Serbia's ambassador in Tehran Aleksandar Tasić met with Mahmoud Ahmadinejad; the meeting was cited by Mohammad Reza Rahimi in a note of congratulations to Serbia's state holiday on February 15, in which it was stated that there are [...] "no impediments" [...] to further relations between Tehran and Belgrade.|$|E
5000|$|Actor Michael Chiklis {{signed on}} to play her co-star, “He’s {{different}} than any other cop that I’ve played; he’s perhaps the most damaged—he’s lost everything that mattered to him—his daughter—to these monsters. He’s really hurting and damaged, and wants to exact revenge on those responsible for his daughter’s death.” Chiklis admitted, “My character is very much in a vigilante mode in this film. Yet in connecting with this girl ‘Sadie,’ there’s this undercurrent of hope and even if he’s beyond hope, <b>as</b> <b>damaged</b> <b>as</b> he is, he finds hope with her since she’s even more damaged than him. Their mistrusting relationship turns into a strange partnership, to almost a relationship where there’s this odd, {{for want of a better}} word, sort of love between them.” Talking about the script, he remembered, “I really responded to the script, but meeting Sebastian was sort of the nail in the coffin as it were. He struck me as a guy who really loves the cinema and is knowledgeable about it. He really made me feel like he was going to make a very good picture.” Chiklis, who had never appeared in a horror film, continued, “What really appealed to me is that the word ‘vampire’ is never used in the film. Sebastian made it clear that there was never going to be the biting of the neck shot—that conventional vampire movie thing. Instead, it’s going to be something very unusual—what we’re going for is a true noir—and that appealed to me greatly.” ...|$|E

40|$|Natural genetic {{transformation}} in the bacterium Bacillus subtilis provides an experimental system for studying the evolutionary function of sexual recombination. The repair hypothesis proposes that during transformation the exogenous DNA taken up by cells is used as template for recombinational repair of damages in the recipient cell's genome. Earlier results demonstrated that the population density of transformed cells (i. e., sexual cells) increases, relative to nontransformed cells (primarily asexual cells), with increasing dosage of ultraviolet irradiation, provided that the cells are transformed with undamaged homologous DNA after they have become damaged. In nature, however, donor DNA for transformation is likely to come from cells that are <b>as</b> <b>damaged</b> <b>as</b> the recipient cells. In order to better simulate the effects of transformation in natural populations we conducted similar experiments as those just described using damaged donor DNA. We document in this report that transformants continue to increase in relative density {{even if they are}} transformed with damaged donor DNA. These results suggest that sites of transformation are often damaged sites in the recipient cell's genome...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to better {{understand}} the role of ocular pigmentation and genetics in light-induced retinal damage. Adult pigmented [Long Evans (LE) and Brown Norway (BN) ] and albino [Sprague Dawley (SD) and Lewis (LW) ] rats were exposed to a bright cyclic light for 6 consecutive days and where compared with juvenile animals exposed to the same bright light environment from postnatal age 14 to 28. Flash ERGs and retinal histology were performed at predetermined days (D) post-light exposure. At D 1, ERGs were similar in all adult groups with no recordable a-waves and residual b-waves. A transient recovery was noticed at D 30 in the LW and LE only [b-wave: 18 % and 25 % of their original amplitude respectively]. Histology revealed that BN retina was the most damaged, while LE retina was best preserved. SD and LW rats were almost <b>as</b> <b>damaged</b> <b>as</b> BN rats. In contrast, the retina of juvenile BN was almost as resistant to the bright light exposure as that of juvenile LE rats. Our results strongly suggest that, although ocular pigmentation and genetic background are important factors in regulating the severity of light-induced retinal damage, the age of the animal at the onset of light exposure appears to be the most important determining factor...|$|E

50|$|To {{illustrate}} the spectrum weighting principle, the incident power density in midday summer sunlight is typically 0.6 mW/(nm m2) at 295 nm, 74 mW/(nm m2) at 305 nm, and 478 mW/(nm m2) at 325 nm. (Note the huge absorption {{that has already}} {{taken place in the}} atmosphere at short wavelengths.)The erythemal weighting factors applied to these figures are 1.0, 0.22, and 0.003 respectively.

40|$|Teflon(registered trademark) FEP (fluorinated ethylene-propylene) is {{commonly}} used on exterior spacecraft surfaces in the low Earth orbit (LEO) environment for thermal control. Silverized or aluminized FEP {{is used for the}} outer layer of thermal control blankets because of its low solar absorptance and high thermal emittance. FEP is also preferred over other spacecraft polymers because of its relatively high resistance to atomic oxygen erosion. Because of its low atomic oxygen erosion yield, FEP has not been protected in the space environment. Recent, long term space exposures such as on the Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF, 5. 8 years in space), and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST, after 3. 6 years in space) have provided evidence of LEO environmental degradation of FEP. These exposures provide unique opportunities for studying environmental degradation because of the long durations and the different conditions (such as differences in altitude) of the exposures. Samples of FEP from LDEF and from HST (retrieved during its first servicing mission) have been evaluated for solar induced embrittlement and for synergistic effects of solar degradation and atomic oxygen. Micro-indenter results indicate that the surface hardness increased as the ratio of atomic oxygen fluence to solar fluence decreased for the LDEF samples. FEP multilayer insulation (MLI) retrieved from HST provided evidence of severe embrittlement on solar facing surfaces. Micro-indenter measurements indicated higher surface hardness values for these samples than LDEF samples, but the solar exposures were higher. Cracks induced during bend testing were significantly deeper for the HST samples with the highest solar exposure than for LDEF samples with similar atomic oxygen fluence to solar fluence ratios. If solar fluences are compared, the LDEF samples appear <b>as</b> <b>damaged</b> <b>as</b> HST samples, except that HST had deeper induced cracks. The results illustrate difficulties in comparing LEO exposed materials from different missions. Because the HST FEP appears more damaged than LDEF FEP based on depth of embrittlement, other causes for FEP embrittlement in addition to atomic oxygen and ultraviolet (UV) radiation, such as thermal effects and the possible role of soft x-ray radiation, need to be considered. FEP that was exposed to soft x-rays in a ground test facility, showed embrittlement similar to that witnessed in LEO, which indicates that the observed differences between LDEF and HST FEP might be attributed to the different soft x-ray fluences during these two missions...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} years, {{knowledge}} about how frost-damage affects the behaviour of concrete structures {{has been developed}} and presently some related studies can be found. It has been generally proved in all tests and analyses carried out since now, that when concrete is severely damaged by freezing, a reduction of the load-carrying capacity and stiffness of the structure and a possible change of the failure mode are detected. Due to {{the change in the}} micro and macro structure of concrete, the material properties of frost-damaged concrete may not be the same as for undamaged concrete. The aim of this master thesis is to study the influence of frost-damage on reinforced concrete beams and to analyse the mechanical behaviour of the beams. Material and bond properties of frost-damaged specimens have been tested by Zandi Hanjari (2008). The results from these experiments were used to choose the input data for non-linear analysis of twelve beams, with different geometries and reinforcement content. Six beams were analysed with undamaged concrete properties and the other six with damaged concrete properties, in order to study the effect of frost-damage on the beams. The stress-strain and bond-slip curves, the Young’s modulus of elasticity and the fracture energy were introduced in the analyses for both undamaged and damaged concrete. Results from experiments on the same frost-damaged reinforced concrete beams, performed by Hassanzadeh and Fagerlund (2006), were compared with the numerical results. Moreover, the results obtained in this thesis were compared with previous analyses, carried out by Zandi Hanjari et al. (2008). The numerical results of this thesis underestimate the stiffness and the strength of large beams with crushing failure. This {{may be due to the}} fact that all the finite elements were considered to be <b>as</b> <b>damaged</b> <b>as</b> the outer part of concrete. While in reality, the level of damage is not constantly distributed along the cross section; that is the closer it is to the surface of concrete, the more damaged it would be. On the other hand, for small beams with crushing failure, which are believed to be more damaged than the larger ones, the same assumption led to an overestimation of the loadcarrying capacity. In general, the numerical results carried out with new input data showed a general improvement when predicting the deformations and load capacities of the beams. The failure modes were also well predicted and the shape of the force-deformation curves appeared to be fairly better fitted with new input data analyses. To sum-up, the experimental research on material properties for frost-damaged concrete seems to have been really helpful to better predict the mechanical behaviour of the tested damaged beams...|$|E
