5|$|In 1947, {{before the}} flight {{testing of the}} prototypes was completed, 30 {{production}} aircraft were ordered. They incorporated an ejection seat and a redesigned vertical stabilizer {{as well as two}} auxiliary fins, one towards the tip {{on each side of the}} tailplane in an attempt to improve the directional stability of the aircraft. The fuselage was lengthened to fit <b>additional</b> <b>equipment</b> and the wing had fillets added at the rear junction with the fuselage.|$|E
5|$|The {{system has}} {{two types of}} receivers: radio terminals, which can either be {{hand-held}} or mounted in vehicles, and desktop equipment for control centers. The system will include 40,000 radios throughout the country. Compared to the analog network, the digital radio equipment will be smaller and have options for <b>additional</b> <b>equipment</b> such as hands free, and allow special radios for motorcycles, snowmobiles, boats, undercover activities and smoke diving. Communication can either be performed as one-to-one conversations, group calls for predefined or ad-hoc groups, with radios able {{to be part of}} several groups, or as walkie talkies in areas without network coverage. The digital transmission reduced background noise and allows monitoring terminal identity to prohibit unauthorized use. All radios are equipped with an emergency button that will give priority in the network.|$|E

5|$|Course {{officials}} resumed work by drilling shafts {{into the}} surface to form a well and installed a cap on it {{in an attempt to}} reduce the drainage problem before the start of Friday's scheduled sessions. It was mooted by some British press publications that the race would be moved to the track's infield road course but this could not be achieved because the circuit did not hold a licence from motorsport's world governing body, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile, to hold an event on this section, and the teams did not bring a suitable aerodynamic package. Drainage problems continued to affect the track leading to the cancellation of the qualifying session, and the starting order was determined by the drivers order in the points' standings. The pole position was awarded to Bräck, his sixth of the season. He was joined on the grid's front row by de Ferran. Andretti was third, Castroneves fourth and Dixon fifth. Dario Franchitti, Patrick Carpentier, Cristiano da Matta, Roberto Moreno and Tony Kanaan rounded out the top ten. Drying efforts continued overnight with <b>additional</b> <b>equipment</b> and extra workers from across England brought in to help improve the track's drainage. Five jet dryers were taken onto the track with additional fuel transported from Sywell Aerodrome to help the vehicles carry out their operation. Additionally, thousands of small holes were created in the track's surface to release moisture.|$|E

Aircraft could be modified in the factory with Umrüst-bausatz (Umbau) conversion kits or by adding extra equipment, called Rüstzustand, to convert standard airframes for special roles, a reconnaissance or bad-weather fighter, for example. Unlike the Rüstsatz field-kits, these modifications were permanent.|$|E
25|$|Various new ECMs and {{electronic}} support systems were retrofitted onto the Nimrod fleet {{in response to}} new challenges and to increase the type's defensive capabilities; <b>additional</b> <b>equipment</b> also provided more effective means of identification and communication.
