In spite of increasing {{evidence to support}} use of modern dressings many units use traditional adhesive dressings, which can cause wound healing problems. Our modern dressing design hydrofibre/hydrocolloid (HF/HC) was highly effective following hip and knee replacements in a national arthroplasty unit. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate this dressing in a district hospital to see if similar clinical outcomes could be achieved. Methods: Prospective evaluation of the modern dressing involved 89 consecutive elective and trauma patients from October 2007 –January 2008. Outcome measures included blistering, wear time, dressing changes, delayed discharge and SSI rate. Results were compared to a traditional dressing currently used. Results: 65 patients HF/HC group, 24 Traditional group. CUSUM tool set an upper <b>alert</b> <b>limit</b> of 5 % blister rate. Traditional group breached upper <b>alert</b> <b>limit</b> after 8 cases. It was decided unethical to continue after 24 cases. Comparison of HF/HC with Traditional showed blistering 1. 5 % versus 16. 7 %, wear time 4. 8 versus 1. 4 days and dressing changes 0. 9 versus 2. 8. Delayed discharge 0 % compared with 4. 2 %.

40|$|In a {{differential}} GPS system such as {{the ground}} based augmentation system (GBAS) for precision approaches of aircraft, GPS reference stations with known locations are utilized to determine and remove most of the ranging uncertainties of the GNSS system in use. Corrections are broadcast to the aircraft and all but residual errors are eliminated. These residual pseudorange errors are due to the position difference between the aircraft and the reference station and lead to a position uncertainty of the aircraft. To qualify for category I precision guidance, the system has to guarantee that undetected pseudorange errors do not cause horizontal and vertical position errors larger than the horizontal and vertical <b>alert</b> <b>limits</b> with a probability smaller than 2 × 10 ^- 7 per approach. There are four fundamental sources of residual pseudorange error for a single frequency GBAS system: signal multipath, receiver noise N_ 0, residual troposphere error due to the differential applied troposphere model and the error induced by ionosphere gradients. In this work we combined different theoretical probability density functions (PDF) for each individual error to a combined pseudorange error distribution. This distribution was propagated through the GBAS Hatch filter and then mapped into the position domain using a one day constellation change observed at Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany (ICAO Identifier EDMO). Where possible, the propagation process was carried out through analytical convolution. When no analytical solution existed, we either performed a numerical solution of the convolution integrals (if the PDF was available in an analytical form) or used numerical convolution for discrete timeseries. The PDF propagation though the Hatch filter was simulated using a pseudo random generator based on the pseudorange error PDF. Our calculations using the unapproximated PDFs yielded a significant reduction of the position domain error at the 2 × 10 ^- 7 integrity risk level when compared to classical methods like Gaussian or Gaussian Mixture overbounding. Indeed, the results suggest a new integrity concept that could be beneficial in obtaining CAT-III performance. The concept employs <b>alert</b> <b>limits</b> and protection levels in the along-track, cross-track and vertical direction rather than the traditional dual split in horizontal and vertical components only. This new concept does not need inflation factors and promises real-time performance through look-up tables. With assumed realistic minimum detectable errors (MDE) for GBAS monitoring algorithms, the position domain error bounds can be reduced even further and decrease close to the projected CAT-III <b>alert</b> <b>limits.</b> This is especially true since the projected ionosphere threat space for Europe does not contain the extreme gradients that have been observed over the continental US. ...|$|R

Stand-alone satellite navigation has not yet reached the point of being sufficiently robust and accurate in order to reach certification level.

40|$|Abstract—Reliability and {{integrity}} {{have become increasingly}} important in ubiquitous positioning systems, and particularly in critical applications. To implement reliability {{and integrity}} measures, Fault Detection and Exclusion (FDE) methods should be used. However, the current FDE methods in the Chi-square test and the outlier test are suboptimal in terms of continuity and availability. This {{is due to the}} assumption that the bias always corresponds with the measurement that has the largest Protection Level (PL), and in the setting of the continuity probability to a predefined value rather than being maximised. The FDE methods assume that the bias always corresponds with the measurement that has the largest PL. However, {{this is not the case}} since a bias can occur in any one of the measurements. Consequently, a method of averaging the Missed Detection probabilities calculated at the <b>Alert</b> <b>Limit</b> (AL) across all measurements was proposed in the literature. However, simulations demonstrated that only minor improvements in the availability have been achieved. The FDE methods in the Chi-square test and the outlier test are also dependent on the user specifying the instantaneous continuity probability that is required to be met. It is then, once the continuity probability has been specified, that the methods determine if there is sufficient integrity, via the monitoring of the maximum PL in relation to the AL. However, in general, ubiquitous positioning systems do not have a minimum continuity probability that is required to be met; but simply desire the continuity probability to be maximised. This paper develops an optimised FDE strategy for one or more biases, which assumes that the bias can exist in any one of the measurements and allows varying satellite failure rates. In addition, the method also aims to provide a position that has sufficient integrity continuously, via maximising the instantaneous continuity probability...|$|E

One proposed alternative is the Local Airport Monitor (LAM). This concept would rebroadcast Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) differential corrections in LAAS format while using an on-airport receiver to monitor the WAAS corrections and tighten the broadcast error bounds to the level required for a Category I approach. The LAM proposal would thus merge the capabilities of WAAS and LAAS to achieve Category I with an architecture similar to that proposed for precision approach with the Ground-Based Regional Augmentation System (GRAS). This paper examines a method for implementing the LAM using a range-domain concept for the LAM ground facility. The cornerstone to the implementation is a modified Vertical Protection Level (VPL) equation {{that takes into account}} the discrepancy between the WAAS pseudorange corrections and the locally measured pseudorange corrections. This modified protection level equation can be implemented without requiring any changes to existing airborne receiver equipment. Specifically, through a careful manipulation of the VHF Data Broadcast (VDB) message, the aircraft’s existing protection levels are transformed into the desired LAM protection levels. Simulation indicates that a baseline LAM implementation achieves reasonable integrity and availability performance even without a specialized multipath limiting antenna. However, baseline availability and continuity are severely degraded for a Vertical <b>Alert</b> <b>Limit</b> (VAL) below 12 m. Two optional modifications are thus introduced to augment availability in support of a 10 m VAL.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate specific alterations to the electromyogram (EMG) and verify safe alarm limits in a porcine model of sustained traction of the RLN using continuous intraoperative neuromonitoring (C-IONM). Methods: Sixteen Norwegian Landrace pigs were anesthetized and intubated with a tracheal tube with a stick-on laryngeal electrode. EMG was recorded at baseline (BL) and during sustained traction applied to each RLN until 70 % amplitude decrease from BL, and during 30 -min recovery. Results: In 29 nerves at risk (NAR), BL amplitude and latency values were 1098  ±  418 (586 – 2255) μV (mean ± SD (range)) (right vagus) and 845  ±  289 (522 – 1634) μV (left vagus), and 4. 7  ±  0. 5 (4. 1 – 5. 9) ms and 7. 9  ±  0. 8 (6. 7 – 9. 6) ms, respectively. At 50 % amplitude decrease, latency increased by 14. 0  ±  5. 7 % (right side) and 14. 5  ±  9. 1 % (left side) compared with BL. Corresponding values for 70 % amplitude depression were 17. 9  ±  6. 1 % and 17. 3  ±  12. 8 %. Traction time to 50 and 70 % amplitude decrease ranged from 3 to 133 min and 3. 9 – 141 min, respectively. In 16 NAR (55 %), time from 50 to 70 % reduction in amplitude was ≤ 5 min, but in six NAR (21 %) ≤ 1 min. In only 11 (38 %) of 29 nerves, the amplitude recovered to more than 50 % of BL. Conclusions: Latency increase may be the first warning of RLN stretch injury. Given the short interval between 50 and 70 % amplitude reduction of the EMG, amplitude reduction by 50 % can be taken as an appropriate <b>alert</b> <b>limit.</b> </p...|$|E
