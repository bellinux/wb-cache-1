5|$|A {{third party}} sells an <b>adapter</b> that {{includes}} USB, SD, and microSD {{on a single}} unit. An <b>adapter</b> to VGA connectors allows the iPad to work with external monitors and projectors. Another <b>adapter</b> mirrors the screen onto HDMI compatible devices in 1080p and works with all apps and rotations. Unlike other adapters, it allows the iPad to charge through another dock connector. While the HDMI <b>adapter</b> was released with and advertised for the second generation iPad, it also works with the first-generation iPad, the iPhone 4, and the fourth generation iPod Touch.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, stock {{abutments}} {{are used}} to retain dentures using a male-adapter attached to the implant and a female <b>adapter</b> in the denture. Two common types of adapters are the ball-and-socket style retainer and the button-style <b>adapter.</b> These types of stock abutments allow movement of the denture, but enough retention {{to improve the quality}} of life for denture wearers, compared to conventional dentures. Regardless of the type of <b>adapter,</b> the female portion of the <b>adapter</b> that is housed in the denture will require periodic replacement, however the number and <b>adapter</b> type does not seem to affect patient satisfaction with the prosthetic for various removable alternatives.|$|E
5|$|Any DVI-to-HDMI <b>adapter</b> can {{function}} as an HDMI-to-DVI <b>adapter</b> (and vice versa). Typically, the only limitation is {{the gender of the}} adapter's connectors and the gender of the cables and sockets it is used with.|$|E
50|$|There {{is great}} {{debate in the}} Pentax {{community}} over the applicability and safety of <b>adapters</b> other than those supplied by Pentax. Many users of third-party infinity-focus <b>adapters,</b> such as Bowers, report difficulty in removing the <b>adapters</b> from camera bodies. Such <b>adapters</b> may require modification before they may be safely used. Official Pentax <b>adapters,</b> and flanged non-infinity-focus <b>adapters,</b> do not provoke such problems.|$|R
5|$|Apple {{settled a}} U.S. class action in 2011 {{regarding}} the older T-shaped MagSafe power <b>adapters.</b> Apple agreed {{to replace the}} <b>adapters</b> with newer <b>adapters,</b> and to compensate customers who were forced to buy replacement <b>adapters.</b>|$|R
25|$|Unicomp {{currently}} produces Model M's with USB connectors {{that can}} be connected directly to modern PCs. However, earlier Model M's have either AT or PS/2 connectors, requiring <b>adapters</b> for PCs lacking those capabilities. (PS/2-to-USB <b>adapters</b> exist for computers without PS/2 ports; and additional AT-to-PS/2 <b>adapters,</b> or SDL-to-PS/2 cables, for computers without AT ports.) Some PS/2-to-USB <b>adapters</b> are unreliable with early Model M's that require more power than the <b>adapters</b> can provide.|$|R
5|$|A Wii console {{running a}} GameCube disc is {{restricted}} to GameCube functionality, and GameCube controller is required to play GameCube titles. A Nintendo GameCube Memory Card is also necessary to save game progress and content, since the Wii internal flash memory will not save GameCube games. Also, backward compatibility is limited in some areas. For example, online and LAN-enabled features for Nintendo GameCube titles are unavailable on the Wii, since the console lacks serial ports for the Nintendo GameCube Broadband <b>Adapter</b> and Modem <b>Adapter.</b>|$|E
5|$|DisplayPort {{connector}} {{is compatible}} with HDMI and can trasmit single-link DVI and HDMI 1.2/1.4/2.0 signals using attached passive adapters or <b>adapter</b> cables. The source device includes a dual-mode transmitter which supports both LVDS signals used by DisplayPort and TMDS signals used by DVI/HDMI. The same external connector is used for both protocols - when DVI/HDMI passive <b>adapter</b> is attached, the transmitter circuit switches to TDMS mode. DisplayPort Dual-mode ports and cables/adapters are typically marked with the DisplayPort++ logo. Thunderbolt ports with mDP connector also supports Dual-mode passive HDMI adapters/cables. Conversion to dual-link DVI and component video (VGA/YPbPr) requires active powered adapters.|$|E
5|$|In an {{announcement}} for the Super Smash Bros. Invitational, a tournament {{which was held}} at E3 2014, Nintendo revealed an official GameCube controller <b>adapter</b> for the Wii U, which allows players to use GameCube controllers with the game, {{as well as a}} Smash Bros. themed game controller. The <b>adapter</b> and controllers were released alongside the game and are also available separately, but vary depending on the region.|$|E

40|$|In general few {{components}} are reused as they are. Often, available {{components are}} incompatible {{with what is}} required. This necessitates component adaptations {{or the use of}} <b>adapters</b> between components. In this paper we develop algorithms for the synthesis of <b>adapters,</b> coercing incompatible components into meeting requirements. We concentrate on <b>adapters</b> for concurrent systems, where <b>adapters</b> are able to resolve synchronisation problems of concurrent components. A new interface model for components, which includes protocol information, allows us to generate these <b>adapters</b> semi-automatically...|$|R

5|$|On June 13, 2016, {{during its}} E3 2016 press conference, Microsoft {{unveiled}} Xbox One S, {{a revision of}} the original Xbox One hardware with a streamlined form factor. Its new casing is 40% smaller than the original design, and supports vertical orientation with a stand. The capacitive power and eject keys were replaced by physical buttons, the side USB port and controller sync button were moved {{to the front of}} the console, and its power supply is integrated into the console's casing rather than sitting externally. Xbox One S requires a USB <b>adapter</b> to attach a Kinect sensor, as it no longer includes the proprietary port used on the original model. A free USB <b>adapter</b> was provided by Microsoft to Kinect owners who registered their ownership of Kinect and Xbox One S online, but this promotion ended in March 2017. Although Microsoft stated that it would eventually bundle the <b>adapter</b> with standalone Kinect units, it is instead sold separately.|$|E
5|$|All LDL {{receptor}} family proteins {{contain a}} cytoplasmic tail {{with at least}} one NPXY motif. This motif is important for binding intracellular <b>adapter</b> proteins and endocytosis. ApoER2 is distinct from most other members of the LDL family of receptors due to a unique insert on its cytoplasmic tail. In ApoER2, there is a proline-rich 59 amino acid insert encoded by the alternatively spliced exon 19. This insert allows for protein interactions that are unable to occur with other LDL receptors. It binds the PSD-95 <b>adapter</b> protein, cross-linking ApoER2 and the NMDA receptors during the process of long-term potentiation, and is also bound specifically by JIP-2, an important interaction in the JNK signalling pathway. It is also speculated that this insert may diminish the function of ApoER2 in lipoprotein endocytosis by somehow disrupting the NPXY motif.|$|E
40|$|By using {{different}} interface <b>adapters</b> for different methods, {{it is possible}} to construct a maximally covering web of interface <b>adapters</b> which incurs minimum loss during interface adaptation. We introduce a polynomial-time algorithm that can achieve this. However, we also show that minimizing the number of <b>adapters</b> included in a maximally covering web of interface <b>adapters</b> is an NP-complete problem. Comment: 7 page...|$|R

50|$|<b>Adapters</b> for PC Cards to Personal Computer ISA slots were {{available}} when these technologies were current. Cardbus <b>adapters</b> for PCI slots have been made. These <b>adapters</b> were sometimes used to fit Wireless (802.11) PCMCIA cards into desktop computers with PCI slots.|$|R
5|$|HDMI is {{backward}} compatible with single-link Digital Visual Interface digital video (DVI-D or DVI-I, but not DVI-A). No signal conversion is required when an <b>adapter</b> or asymmetric cable is used, {{so there is}} no loss of video quality.|$|E
5|$|In the hippocampus, ApoER2 is {{complexed}} with NMDA receptors {{through the}} PSD-95 <b>adapter</b> protein. When reelin binds ApoER2, it initiates tyrosine phosphorylation of NMDA receptors. This occurs through Dab-1 activation of Src family kinases, which {{have been shown to}} play a role in regulating synaptic plasticity. VLDLR also acts as a receptor coupled to ApoER2 as it does during development, but its role is not well understood. ApoER2 plays a more important role in this process, most likely due to its ability to bind the PSD-95 <b>adapter</b> protein through the 59 amino acid insert on its cytoplasmic tail. Studies with mice have shown that knocking out ApoER2 or just the alternatively spliced exon 19 causes a much greater impairment of LTP than knocking out VLDLR.|$|E
5|$|The Mac Pro also {{supported}} Serial ATA solid-state drives (SSD) in the 4 hard drive bays via an SSD-to-hard drive sled <b>adapter</b> (mid-2010 models and later), and by third-party solutions for earlier models (e.g., by an adapter/bracket which plugged into an unused PCIe slot). Various 2.5-inch SSD drive capacities and configurations were available as options.|$|E
