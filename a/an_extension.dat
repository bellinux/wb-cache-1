50|$|<b>A</b> finitely {{generated}} <b>extension</b> {{may not be}} <b>a</b> finite <b>extension.</b> For example, Q(e) is <b>a</b> {{finitely generated}} <b>extension</b> of the rationals, but of infinite degree since e is transcendental. In a sense, <b>a</b> finitely generated <b>extension</b> is <b>a</b> transcendental generalization of <b>a</b> finite <b>extension</b> since, if the generators in A are all algebraic, then F(A) is <b>a</b> finite <b>extension</b> of F. Because of this, most examples come from algebraic geometry.|$|R

5|$|The {{southern}} {{termination of}} the line at Elephant & Castle presented the opportunity for the line to be extended further, to serve Camberwell and other destinations in south-east London. In 1913, the Lord Mayor of London announced a proposal for the Bakerloo Tube to be extended to the Crystal Palace via Camberwell Green, Dulwich and Sydenham Hill, but nothing was done to implement the plan. In 1921, the LER costed <b>an</b> <b>extension</b> to Camberwell, Dulwich and Sydenham and in 1922 plans for <b>an</b> <b>extension</b> to Orpington via Loughborough Junction and Catford were considered. In 1928, a route to Rushey Green via Dulwich was suggested.

40|$|Conditioned {{suppression}} {{was used}} with rats {{to study the}} effects of extending conditioned stimuli (CSs) before versus after the delivery of unconditioned stimuli. These extensions are termed B and <b>A</b> <b>extensions,</b> respectively. Within-group designs were used to compare the effects of extending CSs when 2 -min parts of those CSs were separated by temporal gaps of 6 min versus a separation of no gap. The results were as follows: (<b>a)</b> B <b>extensions</b> weakened conditioning more than did <b>A</b> <b>extensions,</b> with or without gaps; (b) under some conditions, this asymmetrical effect persisted with extended training; (c) gaps between 2 -min parts of <b>a</b> B <b>extension</b> had no detectable effect; and (d) under some parameter values, gaps between 2 -min parts of <b>an</b> <b>A</b> <b>extension</b> weakened conditioning significantly. These results are better predicted by the Sometimes Opponent-Process model (SOP; A. R. Wagner, 1981) than by the Rescorla-Wagner-Frey-Sears real–time model (J. J. B. Ayres, M. Albert, 2 ̆ 6 J. C.

5000|$|There is also {{a similar}} notion: <b>a</b> field <b>extension</b> [...] {{is said to be}} self-regular if [...] is an {{integral}} domain. <b>A</b> self-regular <b>extension</b> is relatively algebraically closed in k.

5|$|There {{are also}} {{instances}} of M-numbered state highways that once existed as extensions of US Highways. M-25 was originally <b>an</b> <b>extension</b> of US25 before {{the latter was}} decommissioned in Michigan, and M-24 was once <b>an</b> <b>extension</b> of US24 before routing changes separated the two highways. M-131 was <b>an</b> <b>extension</b> of US131 until US131 was routed onto the former M-131. There was also once an M-112 that served as an alternate routing for US112 (both have since been changed to I-94 and US12, respectively).|$|E

KSS extended the Vippetangen Line on 8 November 1905, and opened <b>an</b> <b>extension</b> from Homansbyen to Adamstuen on 24 September 1909. KSS and KES agreed to link their two networks, and a connecting line opened on 1 May 1912 between Homansbyen and Rosenborg station on KES's Line 1. <b>An</b> <b>extension</b> of the Vestbanen Line to Skillebekk was finished on 2 November 1911.|$|E

5|$|Also in 1900, a {{proposal}} {{was presented to}} parliament by the Islington and Euston Railway (I) for <b>an</b> <b>extension</b> of the City and South London Railway (C) from Angel to Euston. At the time, the C {{was in the process}} of constructing <b>an</b> <b>extension</b> to Angel from its recently opened terminus at Moorgate Street. The extension plan was initially permitted in 1901, but delays in the parliamentary process meant that it had to be re-submitted the following year. The second submission was opposed by the Metropolitan Railway, which saw the extension as competition to its service between King's Cross and Moorgate, and the plan was rejected. A third attempt, presented to parliament in November 1902 by the C itself, was successful and approved in 1903.|$|E

5|$|An {{additional}} two-track {{connection is}} planned between the line toward Lower Manhattan (around 63rd Street) and the IND 63rd Street Line toward Queens using existing bellmouths {{that are at}} 63rd Street and First Avenue.

The connection would allow for trains to run from the Financial District to Queens if the capacity of the IND Queens Boulevard Line was increased, or if the Queens Bypass was built. Service from Queens via the 63rd Street Tunnel would allow for the full capacity of the line south of 63rd Street to be used.
