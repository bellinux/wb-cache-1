In the cytotoxic stage, 24 to 48 hours after ingestion, clinical and biochemical signs of liver damage are observed, but the patient is typically free of gastrointestinal symptoms. The signs of liver dysfunction such as jaundice, hypoglycemia, acidosis, and hemorrhage appear. Later, there is an increase in the levels of prothrombin and blood levels of ammonia, and the signs of hepatic encephalopathy and/or kidney failure appear. The risk factors for mortality that have been reported are age younger than 10 years, short latency period between ingestion and onset of symptoms, severe coagulopathy (blood clotting disorder), severe hyperbilirubinemia (jaundice), and rising serum creatinine levels.|$|E

40|$|International audienceStudy Objectives:In Kleine-Levin {{syndrome}} (KLS), {{episodes of}} hypersomnia, cognitive, and behavioral disturbances alternate with <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>periods.</b> Because 50 % of patients report decreased academic performances, we evaluated their cognitive status during <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>periods,</b> determinants of deficits, and changes during follow-up. Methods:The cognitive assessment during <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>periods</b> in all consecutive patients with typical KLS and healthy controls included the non-verbal intelligence quotient (Raven Progressive Matrices), the Trail Making Test, the Stroop Color-Word Test, the Wechsler Memory Test, verbal fluencies, the Free and Cued Learning Memory Test, and the Rey-Osterreith Complex Figure. Cognitive status was reevaluated after 0. 5 to 2 y in 44 patients. Results:At baseline, {{compared with the}} 42 controls, the 122 patients with KLS exhibited lower non-verbal intelligence quotient, speed of processing, attention, and reduced retrieval strategies in episodic memory. Higher episode frequency, shorter episode duration, shorter time since last episode, deeper sleep, and megaphagia during episodes predicted impaired memory. The visuoconstructional abilities and non-verbal memory were intact. After a mean follow-up of 1. 7 ± 1. 0 y, the episode frequency decreased from 4. 6 ± 4. 8 to 1. 7 ± 1. 9 /y. The logical reasoning and attention improved, the processing speed remained low, and the retrieval strategies in verbal memory further worsened. Conclusions:In this field study, one-third of patients with KLS have long-term cognitive deficits affecting retrieval and processing speed. Cognitive function should be systematically tested in patients with KLS, which appears important to help patients in their academic studies...|$|R

40|$|Transmission of HIV first {{results in}} an acute infection, {{followed}} by an apparently <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>period</b> that averages ten years. In the absence of antiretroviral treatment, most patients progress into a generalized immune dysfunction that culminates in death.

40|$|To {{assess the}} impact of {{screening}} programmes in reducing the prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis, mathematical and computational models are used as a guideline for decision support. Unfortunately, large uncertainties exist about the parameters that determine the transmission dynamics of C. trachomatis. Here, we use a SEIRS (susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered-susceptible) model to critically analyze the turnover of C. trachomatis in a population and the impact of a screening programme. We perform a sensitivity analysis on the most important steps during an infection with C. trachomatis. Varying the fraction of the infections becoming symptomatic as well as the duration of the symptomatic period within the range of previously used parameter estimates has little effect on the transmission dynamics. However, uncertainties in the duration of temporary immunity and the <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>period</b> can result in large differences in the predicted impact of a screening programme. We therefore analyze previously published data on the persistence of asymptomatic C. trachomatis infection in women and estimate the mean duration of the <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>period</b> to be longer than anticipated so far, namely 433 Â days (95 % CI: 420 â 447 Â days). Our study shows that a longer duration of the <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>period</b> results in a more pronounced impact of a screening programme. However, due to the slower turnover of the infection, a substantial reduction in prevalence can only be achieved after screening for several years or decades.

40|$|Abstract Background Kleine-Levin {{syndrome}} {{is a rare}} sleep disorder of unknown etiology. It is characterized by intermittent periods of excessive sleepiness, cognitive disturbances and behavioral abnormalities. Nine cases of familial Kleine-Levin syndrome have been identified, {{but there are no}} reported cases describing twins that are affected by the syndrome. Case presentation We report the cases of 16 -year-old monozygotic twin boys who both suffered from Kleine-Levin syndrome. In both cases, the onset of the first episode was preceded by an influenza infection. During symptomatic periods they slept for the entire day except for meals and bathroom visits. Actimetry recordings revealed that during symptomatic periods, daily activity was lower than that of <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>periods,</b> on the other hand, activity during the night was significantly higher in symptomatic <b>periods</b> than <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>periods.</b> Polysomnography (PSG) data during symptomatic periods revealed a decrease in sleep efficiency. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing revealed no DQB 1 * 02 loci. They were administered lithium carbonate but the beneficial effect was limited. Conclusions Our observations suggest that Kleine-Levin syndrome may be due to genetic and autoimmune processes, although etiologic relationship to specific HLA type remains controversial. </p...|$|R
40|$|Kleine-Levin {{syndrome}} {{is characterized by}} relapsing-remitting episodes of severe hypersomnia, cognitive impairment, apathy, derealization and behavioural disturbances. Between episodes, patients have normal sleep, mood and behaviour. Functional imaging studies performed in small series of patients with Kleine-Levin syndrome with visual or semi-quantitative, uncontrolled analysis yielded equivocal brain changes. Using whole brain voxel-based group analysis, we compared brain perfusion scintigraphy during and between episodes in consecutive patients with Kleine-Levin syndrome versus healthy control subjects and correlated perfusion changes with disease severity and symptoms, focusing on less studied but disabling symptoms, such as apathy and derealization.

40|$|The {{onset of}} AIDS is {{characterized}} by the collapse of the immune system after a prolonged <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>period.</b> The mechanistic basis of this disease progression has remained obscure, hindering the development of effective therapies. Here I present a mechanism that underlies the deterioration of the immune system during HIV infection. The elevated turnover of lymphocytes throughout the <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>period</b> is postulated to result in the accumulation of deleterious mutations, which impairs immunological function, replicative ability and viability of lymphocytes. This mutational meltdown is proposed to occur throughout the hierarchy of lymphocyte progenitors, resulting in the deterioration of lymphocyte regeneration and an ensuing rise in viral loads. A mathematical model is used to illustrate this mechanism of progressive immunological deterioration. Mutation accumulation may explain not only the decline in CD 4 +T cells, but also the functional deterioration of CD 4 +T cells, CD 8 +T cells and B cells, and the exhaustion of lymphocyte regeneration...|$|E

Several authors have emphasized, that {{some or all of}} these symptoms related to a past traumatic experience could be reactivated, even after long <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>periods.</b> This study investigates the role of an additional trauma in the reactivation of a childhood trauma among a group of former hidden children (n = 65), the Jewish youths who spent World War II in various hideaway shelters in Nazi-occupied Europe. They were compared with a control group. Method: The presence or absence of an additional trauma in adulthood was assessed and PTSD symptoms were measured by using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised. Results: An additional trauma reactivates PTSD symptoms of intrusion thoughts and, marginally, symptoms of hyper-arousal. At the opposite, symptoms of avoidance were not reactivated. Conclusion: Our results confirm the role of an additional trauma in the reactivation of traumatic memories, related to an earlier trauma, in later life.
