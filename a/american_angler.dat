500|$|Throughout {{their native}} and {{introduced}} ranges, cutthroat trout vary widely in size, coloration and habitat selection. Their coloration {{can range from}} golden to gray to green on the back. Cutthroat trout can generally be distinguished from rainbow trout {{by the presence of}} basibranchial teeth at the base of tongue and a maxillary that extends beyond the posterior edge of the eye. Depending on subspecies, strain and habitat, most have distinctive red, pink, or orange linear marks along the underside of their mandibles in the lower folds of the gill plates. These markings are responsible for the common name [...] "cutthroat", first given to the trout by outdoor writer Charles Hallock in an 1884 article in The <b>American</b> <b>Angler.</b> These markings are not unique to the species, some coastal rainbow trout [...] and Columbia River redband trout [...] populations also display reddish or pink throat markings.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, <b>American</b> <b>anglers,</b> such as Theodore Gordon in the Catskill Mountains of New York, began using fly tackle to fish the region’s brook trout-rich streams {{such as the}} Beaverkill and Willowemoc Creek. Many of these early <b>American</b> fly <b>anglers</b> also {{developed}} new fly patterns and wrote extensively about their sport, increasing the popularity of fly fishing {{in the region and}} in the United States as a whole.

Also, they are not {{excessively}} bony. However, most professional <b>American</b> <b>anglers</b> recommend practicing catch and release for these species to protect their numbers in the United States. To help ensure this, Florida Wildlife and Game Commission officers strictly enforce bag limits for these fish.|$|R

50|$|A fishing reel is {{a device}} {{used for the}} {{deployment}} and retrieval of a fishing line using a spool mounted on an axle. Fishing reels are traditionally used in angling. They are most often {{used in conjunction with}} a fishing rod, though some specialized reels are mounted on crossbows or to boat gunwales or transoms. The earliest known illustration of a fishing reel is from Chinese paintings and records beginning about 1195 A.D. Fishing reels first appeared in England around 1650 A.D., and by the 1760s, London tackle shops were advertising multiplying or gear-retrieved reels. Paris, Kentucky native George Snyder is generally given credit for inventing the first fishing reel in America around 1820, a bait casting design that quickly became popular with <b>American</b> <b>anglers.</b>|$|R
