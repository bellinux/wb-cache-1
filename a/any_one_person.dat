As the lawmaking branch of the state government, it is responsible for raising and distributing the money necessary to run the government. The Senate has 48 members serving four-year terms, while the House has 101 members with two-year terms. The state has a term limit for its legislature that restricts <b>any</b> <b>one</b> <b>person</b> to twelve cumulative years service between both legislative branches.|$|E
5|$|According to the classicist J. C. Stobart, Tiberius's Greek {{education}} had {{caused him to}} overestimate {{the reliability of the}} people as a powerbase, causing him to overplay his hand. In Rome, even when led by a bold Tribune the people lacked anywhere near the influence they enjoyed {{at the height of the}} Athenian polis. Another problem for Gaius's aims was that the Roman constitution, specifically the Tribal Assembly, was designed to prevent any one individual governing for a sustained period of time – and there were several other checks and balances to prevent power being concentrated on <b>any</b> <b>one</b> <b>person.</b> Stobart adds that another reason for the efforts' failures was the Gracchi's idealism; they were deaf to the baser notes of human nature and failed to recognize how corrupt and selfish all sections of Roman society had become.|$|E
5|$|The Hugo Award for Best Fancast {{is awarded}} to the best non-professional audio or video {{periodical}} devoted to science fiction, fantasy, or related subjects. The fancast must have released four or more episodes {{by the end of}} the previous calendar year, at least one of which appeared in that year, and it must not qualify for the dramatic presentation category. It must also not provide or be published by an entity that provides a quarter or more of the income of <b>any</b> <b>one</b> <b>person</b> working on the fancast. The name of the award is a portmanteau of fan and podcast. The Hugo Award for Best Fancast was first proposed as a category after the 2011 awards, and then appeared as a temporary category at the 2012 awards. Temporary awards are not required to be repeated in following years. The 2013 awards, however, did repeat the category, and afterwards it was ratified as a permanent category, and will appear in all future years.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the origin of vy-address came from the Roman Empire and the French due to the influence of their language and culture on the Russian aristocracy. In many other European countries, ty initially was used to address <b>any</b> <b>one</b> <b>person</b> or object, regardless of age and social ranking. Vy was then used to address multiple people or objects altogether. Later, after being in contact with foreigners, the second person plural pronoun acquired another function. Displaying respect and formality, it was used for addressing aristocrats – people of higher social status and power.|$|E

500|$|The [...] "Lucy poems" [...] {{are written}} {{from the point}} of view of a lover who has long viewed the object of his affection from afar, and who is now {{affected}} by her death. Yet Wordsworth structured the poems so that they are not about <b>any</b> <b>one</b> <b>person</b> who has died; instead they were written about a figure representing the poet's lost inspiration. Lucy is Wordsworth's inspiration, and the poems as a whole are, according to Wordsworth biographer Kenneth Johnston, [...] "invocations to a Muse feared dead". Lucy is represented in all five poems as sexless; it is unlikely that the poet ever realistically saw her as a possible lover. Instead, she is presented as an ideal and represents Wordsworth's frustration at his separation from Coleridge; the asexual imagery reflects the futility of his longing.|$|E

Some people would use the Links for hours at a time.

500|$|The {{award was}} first {{presented}} in 1955, {{and has been}} given annually since except for in 1958. A [...] "fanzine" [...] is defined for the award as a magazine that {{does not meet the}} Hugo award's criteria for a professional or semi-professional magazine. Specifically, it must meet less than two of the five Hugo criteria for consideration as a semiprozine: that the magazine had an average press run of at least one thousand copies per issue, paid its contributors and/or staff in other than copies of the publication, provided at least half the income of <b>any</b> <b>one</b> <b>person,</b> had at least fifteen percent of its total space occupied by advertising, and announced itself to be a semiprozine. This is the oldest long-running Hugo award for fan activity; in 1967 Hugo Awards were added specifically for fan writing and fan art.

[...] In comparison, the food writer Bee Wilson opines that disparaging Isabella's work was only a [...] "fashionable" [...] stance to take and that the cook's writing [...] "simply makes you want to cook". Christopher Driver, the journalist and food critic, suggests that the [...] "relative stagnation and want of refinement in the indigenous cooking of Britain between 1880 and 1930" [...] may instead be explained by the [...] "progressive debasement under successive editors, revises and enlargers". David comments that [...] "when plain English cooks" [...] were active in their kitchens, [...] "they followed plain English recipes and chiefly those from the Mrs Beeton books or their derivatives". Dickson Wright considers Beeton to be a [...] "fascinating source of information" [...] from a social history viewpoint, and Aylett and Ordish consider the work to be [...] "the best and most reliable guide for the scholar to the domestic history of the mid-Victorian era".|$|E

500|$|After weak {{sales in}} 2009 of several {{titles in the}} Guitar Hero series, Activision {{proceeded}} to make several changes with their internal development teams. The company dissolved RedOctane, bringing {{in some of the}} staff directly into Activision. Activision further shuttered Neversoft's Guitar Hero division, pending the completion of Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock, with further development in the series to be created by some former Neversoft members and Vicarious Visions. Brian Bright, former Neversoft member and current project lead, noted that part of the poor sales of Guitar Hero in 2009 was a result of a loss of focus with Guitar Hero 5, stating that [...] "we were trying to please everyone out there and I think in the end you end up not pleasing <b>any</b> <b>one</b> <b>person</b> a lot". With Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock, Bright wanted to bring the game back to please the fans of the earlier Guitar Hero games, specifically the highly successful [...] To that end, the team developed a soundtrack [...] "more focused on rock 'n' roll" [...] than the variety of genres within Guitar Hero 5. The songs are more guitar-centric, as proven to be the most popular instrument choice based on Guitar Hero 5. Bright noted they used player statistics from previous games to shape Warriors of Rock; for example, according to Bright, within a month of release, 40% of the players of Guitar Hero 5 were playing on Expert mode, and felt this was the audience they needed to cater to. Bright also stated that the aim of Warriors of Rock was to create a game with [...] "its own identity" [...] from both previous Guitar Hero titles and other rhythm games; [...] "Rather than go head-to-head with our own games and our competitors, we decided we wanted to make something different." ...|$|E
