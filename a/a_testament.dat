2500|$|<b>As</b> <b>testament</b> to its popularity, {{the novel}} went through four {{immediate}} editions. In 1971 {{it was still}} considered a classic by the writers of Encyclopædia Britannica, which stated that [...] "addressed to the young, the novel has a quality perennially young." ...|$|R
40|$|Idealism, {{realism and}} history - Thucydides a complex amalgam of these notions and more.

50|$|<b>As</b> <b>testament</b> to the character's {{enduring}} popularity, Irish bookmakers humorously {{began collecting}} bets on whether Dougal would succeed Pope John Paul II upon his death.

5|$|Bowen and the Spurs {{bounced back}} {{and won the}} NBA title in 2005, {{defeating}} the Detroit Pistons. The Spurs could not win back-to-back titles, however, and bowed out 4–3 in a seven-game series against the Dallas Mavericks in the 2006 NBA Playoffs. As <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> to his controversial style of play, Bowen picked up a $10,000 NBA fine for kicking Ray Allen in the back during a March 2006 game.|$|E
5|$|Camelot Software Planning spent between {{twelve and}} {{eighteen}} months developing Golden Sun, {{which is considered}} {{a long time for}} a handheld video game; the finished product was described as <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> to the positive results a long development cycle can bring to a game. In August 2000, Camelot showed an early but playable version at the Nintendo Spaceworld Expo in Japan. North American reviewers received the game {{a few weeks before the}} release, and IGN noted that the experience of developing Shining Force for Sega helped Camelot develop a gripping RPG for the handheld.|$|E

5|$|In 2012, David P.

5|$|In al-Karak, an-Nasir Ahmad had Tashtamur and Qutlubugha {{executed}} for unclear reasons. The move to execute them appalled the public, with whom an-Nasir Ahmad was steadily losing credibility with. The executions {{were seen as}} <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> of an-Nasir Ahmad's ingratitude {{to the men who}} had supported him and virtually installed him as sultan. Historian Joseph Drory argues that it was because Tashtamur and Qutlubugha compelled him to assume the sultanate and remove him from his self-imposed isolation in al-Karak that made an-Nasir Ahmad resentful toward them.|$|E
5|$|The cathedral {{has been}} a focus of Mexican {{cultural}} identity, and is <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> to its colonial history. Researcher Manuel Rivera Cambas reported that the cathedral {{was built on the}} site sacred precinct of the Aztecs and with the very stones of their temples so that the Spaniards could lay claim to the land and the people. Hernán Cortés supposedly laid the first stone of the original church personally.|$|E

5|$|The {{opinion that}} Eclogue 4 was a {{reference}} to the coming of Jesus was not universally held by early members of the early Church, however. St. Jerome, an early Church writer noted for translating the Bible into Latin, specifically wrote that Virgil could not have been a Christian prophet without having accepted Christ, and claimed that anyone that had accepted that Virgil was a pre-Christian prophet was being childish. Classicist Ella Bourne, however, noted that the mere fact that St. Jerome responded to the idea is <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> to the belief's pervasiveness.|$|E
5|$|While Bobby Dodd was a {{determined}} competitor, he cared deeply {{for those who}} played for him. Unlike some other coaches, {{he did not believe}} in winning at any costs; he truly believed that {{the most important aspect of}} college football was the college football player. As <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> to the character of Bobby Dodd, each year a Division I college coach whose team excels on the field, in the classroom, and in the community is awarded the Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Award, presented by the Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Foundation.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20thcentury, the teachings of Tenrikyo's foundress Oyasama became popular throughout Japan. In the following decades, the most devoted followers coalesced around Oyasama's residence in rural Nara, which she had perceived as the birthplace of the world, or Jiba. The six villages surrounding the Jiba slowly became filled with Tenrikyo ministers, mystics, and evangelists, and the area was urbanized. A popular international school (now Tenri University) and Tenri Central Library, built by followers, were also attracting a variety of people to the area. It was around this time that Tenrikyo's Second Shinbashira (community leader) Shōzen Nakayama conceived of creating a grand construction project as <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> to the loyalty of Oyasama's followers.|$|E

5|$|Denard Robinson had {{perhaps his}} worst game {{up to this}} point in the season: he threw three interceptions and was held to only 84 yards rushing. This marked the first time that Michigan State had {{defeated}} Michigan {{three years in a row}} since they accomplished this feat from 1965–1967. The announced crowd of 113,065 was, at the time, the second largest crowd ever at Michigan Stadium. As <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> to Michigan's ongoing kicking woes, the field goal in the first half was Michigan's first attempt since the game against UMass and the first converted kick since the game against Connecticut.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the title}} win, Chapman kept faith with his squad, making only one new signing – outside right Joey Williams – as they {{successfully}} defended their League title in 1924–25. Huddersfield started brightly but a poor run of form in October and November (in part {{caused by an}} injury to goalkeeper Ted Taylor) saw them drop to ninth at one point. Taylor was replaced by new signing Billy Mercer and a resurgence in form saw Huddersfield climb the table, regaining top spot with a 5–0 win over Arsenal in February, and eventually finishing two points clear of runners-up West Bromwich Albion. As <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> to Chapman's philosophy of relying on a strong defence, {{it was the first}} time a title-winning side had gone through a season without conceding more than two goals in any match.|$|E
5|$|In 1968 John Betjeman made a {{television}} film called A Poet Goes North {{in which he}} gave his opinion on the changing architecture of Leeds. Betjeman described the constant sound of falling Victorian architecture. Betjeman also lambasted British Railways House (now City House) saying it blocked all the light out to City Square and was only <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> to money and had no architectural merit of its own. Betjeman also praised Leeds Town Hall in the film. The film, which was never broadcast at the time, was preserved by Leeds Civic Trust and has been restored by the Yorkshire Film Archive. It was screened {{as part of the}} Leeds International Film Festival in 2008.|$|E

The agreement makes the Philippines the eighth country to host the NUASC through which the Transnational Doctoral Programs for Leading Professionals in Asian Countries will be implemented. It will enable Filipino doctoral candidates to enroll in NU doctoral programs without having to be physically present in Nagoya for the whole duration of the course. Nagoya's Graduate School of Bioagricultural Sciences and Graduate School of International Development will offer the doctorates in bioagricultural sciences and international development, respectively, through the said facility.|$|E
5|$|On the hardwood, {{the veteran}} Robertson still proved {{he was a}} {{valuable}} player. Paired with Abdul-Jabbar, two more division titles with the Bucks followed in the 1971–72 and 1972–73 season. In Robertson's last season, he helped lead Milwaukee to a league-best 59–23 record and helped them to reach the 1974 NBA Finals. There, Robertson {{had the chance to}} end his stellar career with a second ring. The Bucks were matched up against a Boston Celtics team powered by an inspired Dave Cowens, and the Bucks lost in seven games. As <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> to Robertson's importance to the Bucks, in the season following his retirement the Bucks fell to last place in their division with a 38–44 record in spite of the continued presence of Abdul-Jabbar.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} {{priorities}} of the regeneration was {{the restoration of the}} dock system, which had deteriorated rapidly since the Brunswick Dock gates had been left open. Contaminated silt was removed from the dock basin, dock gates were replaced & bridges restored, whilst the dock walls were repaired. The Albert Dock company appointed Tarmac to renovate the dock's vast warehouses and repair war time bomb damage. Structural surveys carried out by the MDC found the brickwork and foundations to be in very good condition and it was considered <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> to the strict build quality of Hartley's design that a building almost 150 years old was still in such good condition.|$|E
