5|$|Isolated {{inside the}} Tower, the royal {{government}} was in <b>a</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>shock</b> {{at the turn}} of events. The King left the castle that morning and made his way to negotiate with the rebels at Mile End in east London, taking only a very small bodyguard with him. The King left Sudbury and Hales behind in the Tower, either for their own safety or because Richard had decided it would be safer to distance himself from his unpopular ministers. Along the way, several Londoners accosted the King to complain about alleged injustices.|$|E

5|$|Veltmann {{denied that}} there was a mutinous conspiracy, saying the men were in <b>a</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>shock</b> {{stemming}} from the horrific explosion and the subsequent cleanup of human body parts belonging to their former battalion mates. He said the conversations at Camp Shoemaker were simply those of men who were trying to understand what had happened, and that these discussions were not mutinous nor could they provide the groundwork for conspiracy. Veltmann argued that Small's brief four- or five-minute speech to the men on the barge was given in the performance of his duty to maintain order, a duty placed upon him by his superiors. Veltmann restated that the established legal definition of mutiny was a concerted effort to usurp, subvert or override military authority, and that there had been no such action or intent. Refusal to obey an order was not mutiny.|$|E
5|$|Ann soon arrives, {{discovering}} Gil cowering in {{the cellar}} in <b>a</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>shock.</b> Believing that he is beyond help, Gil at first refuses to see Dr. Hoffman, but after Ann's tearful pleading, Gil reluctantly agrees. During the examination, Dr. Hoffman orders Gil {{to remain in the}} house at all times as a precaution until he can return with help. Feeling guilty for leaving Trudy, Gil returns to the bar but is brutally beaten by George and his gang. Gil regains consciousness the next morning and discovers that Trudy, having felt sorry for him, brought him home to her apartment. George soon arrives and, upon seeing Gil, forces him at gunpoint out into the daylight. Transforming into the creature, Gil murders George in front of the horrified Trudy before fleeing into the hills. Returning to the house, Gil finds Ann, Dr. Hoffman and Buckell waiting there and returns to his normal human state. A disturbed Gil later admits to the murder, with the others assuring him that he acted in self-defense, but when the police arrive with an arrest warrant, the hysterical Gil flees from the grounds in his car and accidentally hits a police officer.|$|E
5|$|In {{trying to}} find a way to escape before the dome rises, Ryouta and Sakuya uncover records in the library {{mentioning}} a medical center that was shut down due to a fire, and that the ghostly Nageki, who Ryouta previously encountered, died in that fire. Sakuya deduces that an unused building on campus was the medical center and after investigating, they find its basement blocked off. They also encounter Anghel, who recalls the protagonist going into the infirmary the day before, contradicting Yuuya and Shuu's shared alibi. As Ryouta searches the infirmary for clues, he finds medical records for himself, the protagonist, Nageki, and Sakuya, but is knocked out immediately after. When he regains consciousness, he discovers the protagonist's bloody student ID—now with concrete evidence, Ryouta prepares to confront the doctor and Yuuya, only to find that Sakuya had left to do so alone. Ryouta returns to the infirmary as Yuuya shields Sakuya from Shuu's attempts to kill him; the doctor tells Ryouta that he will be waiting for him in the medical center's basement before escaping with Labor 9. Yuuya apologizes, affirming that while neither he nor Shuu killed the protagonist, they were the ones who dismembered her, and asks to speak to Sakuya alone. He reveals that they are full-blooded siblings, with Shuu using knowledge of Sakuya's true heritage to blackmail Yuuya into assisting him. Yuuya dies, Shuu's scalpel having been laced with the same neurotoxin that killed the headmaster, leaving Sakuya in <b>a</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>shock.</b>|$|E

5|$|Sophie {{was one of}} Mozart 's pups seen on Meerkat Manor. She had two {{brothers}} and one sister named Sparkle. Only one of her brothers was given a name and he was called Spud. They were born some time after Tosca, Mozart's sister, gave birth to three pups. Their uncle Yossarian decided to move their pups who {{were only a few}} days old. He brought each up above ground and started to move them to a new burrow. The babysitters followed him and carried each pup. The Whiskers returned and Yossarian dropped the pup he was carrying, who was Sophie's sister. Her sister got left behind and died later that night. The other pups were moved to the new burrow. One day, while being babysat by Yossarian, Mitch, Sophie's other uncle, viciously attacked her without warning. Yossarian failed to stop the assault and simply waited until Mitch was proud of the beating. Afterwards, little Sophie was in <b>a</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>shock,</b> but thankfully Tosca gave Sophie a comforting cuddle. Sophie didn't re-appear in the series until much later, when she was older. She was seen babysitting a litter, but was finding them a bit of a handful. That was the last time Sophie was mentioned in Season 1. In this season and up until season 3, she was played by Tina Sparkle since the real Sophie was the one Youssarian unintentionally killed.|$|E

50|$|The final wave of mass shootings began {{several months}} later. A {{large group of}} Jews from the school {{building}} (renamed Camp Kopernikus) were transported to the Jewish cemetery on Christmas Eve of 24 December 1942 and murdered there; those who remained (around 250 slave workers) were killed on 10 January 1943 following the Kopernikus prisoner revolt. The SS surrounded the premises planning a deportation action, but the prisoners locked themselves inside and resisted, putting the SS in <b>a</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>shocked</b> disbelief. After <b>a</b> struggle, the building was eventually set on fire and burned down with the Jews inside. Meanwhile, at the K. Rudzki foundry (renamed Krupp AG) over 100 Jewish workers were extracted on 5 June 1943, and executed as the last. The Ghetto was no more. An underground resistance movement developed in Mińsk, and later the Polish Home Army (AK) {{got a chance to}} retaliate. On 22 July 1943 the Gestapo chief Schmidt was ambushed and shot by the partisans.|$|R
25|$|The {{new wave}} of murders brought the city to <b>a</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>shock</b> as people took the same {{precautions}} as they had when the first wave took place. The city took a beating economically as tourists stayed away. Streets were deserted at night, even in North Beach, a neighborhood known to have a seven-nights-a-week nightlife.|$|E
25|$|In 1978, {{two young}} hikers, while walking on Monte Musinè near Turin, saw a bright light; {{one of them}} {{temporarily}} disappeared and, after a while, was found in <b>a</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>shock</b> and with a noticeable scald on one leg. After regaining consciousness, he reported having seen an elongated vehicle and that some strangely shaped beings descended from it. Both the young hikers suffered from conjunctivitis for some time.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{defection}} of {{some former}} supporters, many Zuma supporters continued to rally outside the courthouse, arousing criticism by anti-rape groups for regular {{attacks on the}} integrity and moral standing of Zuma's accuser, insults yelled at {{a close friend of}} the accuser, and even stones thrown at a woman that members of the crowd mistook for the accuser. Zuma's defence team introduced evidence relating to the woman's sexual past, and asserted that the sex that took place was consensual. The prosecution asserted that her lack of resistance was due to <b>a</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>shock,</b> and that {{the relationship between the two}} was like that of a 'father-daughter' pair.|$|E
40|$|A case <b>of</b> <b>shock</b> {{following}} intravesical formalin instillation for massive bladder hemorrhage {{owing to}} post-radiation cystitis is reported.

30|$|To {{delineate}} the adaptive mechanisms operative under salinity stress, {{it is essential}} to study plant responses at the very early stages of stress which are very crucial for governing plant survival and adaptation.

30|$|All {{patients}} {{presented with}} bleeding per vaginum of varying degrees. Two patients in TAH and VH group had pain abdomen along with bleeding. Three patients in TLH group and three patients in TAH group were in <b>a</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> hypovolemic <b>shock</b> {{at the time}} of hospitalization. Blood transfusions were needed in five patients in the TLH group and six patients each in the TLH and VH groups (Table 5).|$|R
25|$|Occasionally, scourging preceded crucifixion, {{which would}} cause the {{condemned}} to lose {{a large amount of}} blood, and approach <b>a</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>shock.</b> The convict then usually had to carry the horizontal beam (patibulum in Latin) to the place of execution, but not necessarily the whole cross. Crucifixion was typically carried out by specialized teams, consisting of a commanding centurion and four soldiers. When it was done in an established place of execution, the vertical beam (stipes) could even be permanently embedded in the ground. It's claimed by certain religious texts that the victims of crucifixion were stripped naked before being put on the cross—all the New Testament gospels describe soldiers gambling for the robes of Jesus.|$|E
25|$|Command of {{the ship}} thereby devolved upon the ship's third officer, Charles Rivers, but Rivers, {{apparently}} in <b>a</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>shock,</b> proved incapable of action. Fortunately, one {{of the ship}}'s small complement of passengers, Cornelius L. Brady, was a ships' master himself with recent experience of such a crisis. Brady had been the hero in the shipwreck of the SS Atlantic {{less than a year}} prior, where his courageous action in personally establishing a rope to shore was credited with saving as many as 250 lives. Now he was now about to lead another rescue effort. Brady quickly ordered the crew to secure the damaged upper forward hatches with hatches from the lower deck, in order to stop the further flow of water into the ship. A delegation of the crew then implored Brady to take command, a proposal which he accepted. Brady made his way ondeck to the midships wheelhouse, where he ordered the helmsman to turn the ship into the wind. He then rang the engine room to reduce the ship's speed to dead slow.|$|E
25|$|Two {{months after}} the murder of Thomas Lundgren, on August 4, 1979, Bonin and Butts {{abducted}} a 17-year-old named Mark Shelton shortly after the youth left his Westminster home to walk to a movie theater near Beach Boulevard. Screams were heard from {{the vicinity of the}} Shelton household by neighbors, leaving a strong possibility Shelton was abducted by force. The youth was violated with foreign objects including a pool cue, causing his body to enter <b>a</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>shock</b> which proved fatal. His body was then discarded in San Bernardino County. The following day, Bonin and Butts encountered a 17-year-old West German student named Markus Grabs attempting to hitchhike from Pacific Coast Highway. Grabs was bound with lengths of cord and ignition wire and driven to Bonin's home where he was sodomized, beaten, and stabbed a total of 77 times before his nude body was discarded in Malibu Creek, close to Las Virgenes Canyon Road. His body was found the following morning, with one investigator likening the network of injuries inflicted upon the victim to that of a rabid dog unable to determine when to cease biting.|$|E

2500|$|In Congressional {{testimony}} on October 23, 2008, Greenspan {{acknowledged that he}} was [...] "partially" [...] wrong in opposing regulation and <b>stated</b> [...] "Those <b>of</b> us who have looked to the self-interest of lending institutions to protect shareholder's equity—myself especially—are in <b>a</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>shocked</b> disbelief." [...] Referring to his free-market ideology, Greenspan said: [...] "I have found a flaw. I don't know how significant or permanent it is. But I have been very distressed by that fact."

[...] "In other words, you found that your view of the world, your ideology, was not right, it was not working," [...] Waxman said. [...] "Absolutely, precisely," [...] Greenspan replied. [...] "You know, that's precisely the reason I was shocked, because I have been going for 40 years or more with very considerable evidence that it was working exceptionally well."

25|$|At 11:15 that morning, Fred {{formally}} {{admitted to}} police he had indeed killed his daughter, albeit {{in an act}} of manslaughter. He confessed to strangling Heather in a fit of rage before dismembering her body in the ground floor bathroom with a heavy serrated knife he normally used for cutting slabs of frozen meat. Her remains had been stored in a dustbin as he waited for an opportunity to dig her grave. Fred was insistent his wife had no knowledge of her daughter's murder, claiming he had committed this murder as Rose was preoccupied with one of her clients, adding the fact the search team had not yet unearthed Heather's remains was because they had been excavating the wrong section of his garden. He then volunteered to accompany police to the house to pinpoint the precise location of Heather's body. Upon receipt of this confession, Fred's solicitor, Howard Ogden, and his appointed appropriate adult, Janet Leach, informed Mae and Stephen their father had confessed to their sister's murder. In response, Stephen slumped against a wall and began sobbing; Mae entered <b>a</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>shock,</b> before stammering that her father had not killed her sister.|$|E
25|$|Position 1 was {{destroyed}} and buried its inhabitants, {{who were in}} <b>a</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>shock</b> when evacuated from the rubble. The telephone system was cut down. A machine gun, aimed at the planes, {{was hit by a}} shell. Most of the Israelis' firearms got dirty from the dust, and one machine gun broke down. Since the beginning of the attack, the signal operator tried to contact the 53rd Battalion headquarters at Beer Tuvia. At 10:00, she managed to get an SOS through before losing contact completely. Near 11:00, four Egyptian tanks were ordered to break through into the farmstead, followed by infantry. The tanks advanced from the northeastern corner of the camp, and were met by two Israelis armed with PIATs. They managed to hit the track of one of the tanks on the second shot. The tanks halted, but the PIAT soon broke down and its operator suffered a head wound. The tanks retreated and continued to shell the Israeli position. The Egyptian infantry kept advancing, taking over positions 10, 11, 12, and capturing the water tanks area. The Egyptians reported victory. Twelve Israelis were killed by the tank shells.|$|E

50|$|The shock index (SI), {{defined as}} heart rate divided by {{systolic}} blood pressure, {{is an accurate}} diagnostic measure that is more useful than hypotension and tachycardia in isolation. Under normal conditions, a number between 0.5 and 0.8 is typically seen. Should that number increase, so does suspicion <b>of</b> <b>an</b> underlying <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>shock.</b> Blood pressure alone {{may not be a}} reliable sign for shock, as there are times when a person is in circulatory shock but has a stable blood pressure.|$|R
