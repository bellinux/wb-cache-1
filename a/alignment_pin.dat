5000|$|When a {{soft-sectored disk}} is {{low-level}} [...] "formatted", each track is written {{with a number}} of bytes calculated to fit within 360 degrees at the highest expected motor speed; identification data showing where each sector should start is written at this time. The system of punched holes used by hard-sectored disks is not needed; a single hole is retained to indicate the start of the track (-inch disks use an <b>alignment</b> <b>pin</b> rather than a hole). If the motor is spinning any slower than the highest acceptable speed, which is usually the case, the data will fit in fewer than 360 degrees, resulting in a gap {{at the end of the}} track. Additionally, if a sector were to be rewritten on a drive running faster than the drive was running when the track was formatted, the new data would be larger (occupy more degrees of rotation) than the original sector. Therefore, during formatting a gap must be left between sectors to allow a rewritten sector to be larger without over-writing the following sector.|$|E

40|$|Simple, easy-to-use, highly {{effective}} tooling has been devised for maintaining alignment of bolt holes in mating structures during assembly and disassembly of the structures. The tooling was originally used during {{removal of a}} body flap from the space shuttle Atlantis, in which misalignments during removal {{of the last few}} bolts could cause the bolts to bind in their holes. By suitably modifying the dimensions of the tooling components, the basic design of the tooling can readily be adapted to other structures that must be maintained in alignment. The tooling includes tapered, internally threaded alignment pins designed to fit in the bolt holes in one of the mating structures, plus a draw bolt and a cup that are used to install or remove each <b>alignment</b> <b>pin.</b> In preparation for disassembly of two mating structures, external supports are provided to prevent unintended movement of the structures. During disassembly of the structures, as each bolt that joins the structures is removed, an <b>alignment</b> <b>pin</b> is installed in its place. Once all the bolts have been removed and replaced with pins, the pins maintain alignment as the structures are gently pushed or pulled apart on the supports. In assembling the two structures, one reverses the procedure described above: pins are installed in the bolt holes, the structures are pulled or pushed together on the supports, then the pins are removed and replaced with bolts. The figure depicts the tooling and its use. To install an <b>alignment</b> <b>pin</b> in a bolt hole in a structural panel, the tapered end of the pin is inserted {{from one side of the}} panel, the cup is placed over the pin on the opposite side of the panel, the draw bolt is inserted through the cup and threaded into the pin, the draw bolt is tightened to pull the pin until the pin is seated firmly in the hole, then the draw bolt and cup are removed, leaving the pin in place.

40|$|Background: The {{complexity}} of hip reconstruction {{has been and}} continues to be a perplexing problem with restoring leg length, femoral offset, joint stability and overall hip implant fixation. These were contributing factors that lead {{to the development of a}} novel proximal femoral component design “Apex Modular Stem” (Omni, Raynham, MA). The basic stem geometry features a straight stem with a metaphyseal fit and fill cone, a medial triangle and a modular neck junction that allows for version and offset adjustment. In recent years, there has been great concern with the use of modularity in total hip arthroplasty. The goals of this study are (1) to identify complications with the use of a proximal modular design and (2) demonstrated factors that have eliminated those complications. Methods: This is a retrospective study of a single surgeon series (Design A and Design B) of using the same cementless stem and proximal modular neck body (Apex Modular Stem and Omni Mod Hip Stem) from 2000 to 2016 totaling 2, 125 stems. 483 stems were the Design A and 1, 642 stems, were of the Design B style. Results: Design A, 483 stems were implanted between 2000 and 2004. 31 alignment pins sheared resulting in a revision rate of 6. 4 %. Design B, 1, 642 stems have been implanted between 2004 and 2016 all by the same surgeon, with no failures of the modular junction. Conclusion: All implant devices entail a multitude of risks and benefits. The Apex Modular Stem (Design A), provided excellent fixation, minimal risk of modular junction  corrosion, and simple control of anteversion and femoral offset. The limitation was found to be the risk of the <b>alignment</b> <b>pin</b> shearing (6. 4 %). The pin was enlarged to make it 225 % stronger in torsional resistance, and in a subsequent series of over 1, 600 femoral stems in a single surgeon series, there were no pin failures over a  12 year duration...|$|E

40|$|A {{rapid and}} simple method to {{fabricate}} tiny shadow-masks {{and their use}} in multi-layer surface patterning with in situ micromechanical alignment is presented. Instead of using silicon micromachining with through-wafer etching to define the thin membrane with etched apertures, we are using photoplastic SU- 8 -based resist as structural material of both membrane and support rim. Two layers, 5 and 150 m thick, are structured by lithography and finally released from the surface. The free-standing SU- 8 membranes have apertures ranging from 6 to 300 m. They are placed and mechanically fixed to the surface, which needs to be patterned. Deposition by evaporation of Cr, Au, Al or other material through the membrane apertures results in an accurate 1 : 1 replication of the aperture pattern. In view of multi-layer patterning, we used in situ micromechanical <b>alignment</b> <b>pins</b> or jigs and achieved an overlay precision of < 2 m in both x- and y-directions.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} some further {{investigations into}} the connection repeatability for waveguide devices in the WM- 250 (WR- 01) waveguide size over the recommended frequency range of 750 GHz to 1. 1 THz. This work follows previous work on this subject that {{was presented at the}} 82 nd ARFTG conference in November 2013. As with the earlier investigation, three devices have been investigated - an offset short-circuit, a flush short-circuit, and a near-matched load. These devices can be used as calibration standards for Vector Network Analyzers (VNAs), and so can be found in VNA calibration kits. On this occasion, the aperture of each device was inverted (i. e. rotated through 180 °) between the repeated disconnection and re-connection of the device to the VNA test port. This provides an experimental evaluation of the effect of the imperfect position of the device's flange <b>alignment</b> <b>pins</b> and holes. As before, the repeatability of the measurements is assessed using statistical techniques, in terms of the experimental standard deviation in both the real and imaginary components of the complex-valued linear reflection coefficient. The results obtained during this investigation are compared with the results obtained from the previous investigation (where flange inversion was not included as part of the disconnection and re-connection procedure for the devices) ...|$|R
40|$|Current {{waveguide}} flange standards do {{not allow}} for the accurate fitting of microchips, due to the large mechanical tolerances of the flange <b>alignment</b> <b>pins</b> and the brittle nature of Silicon, requiring greatly oversized alignment holes on the chip to fit worst-case fabrication tolerances, resulting in unacceptably large misalignment error for sub-THz frequencies. This paper presents, for the first time, a new method for directly aligning micromachined Silicon chips to standard, i. e. unmodified, waveguide flanges with alignment accuracy significantly better than the waveguide-flange fabrication tolerances, through {{the combination of a}} tightly-fitting circular and an elliptical alignment hole on the chip. A Monte Carlo analysis predicts the reduction of the mechanical assembly margin by a factor of 5. 5 compared to conventional circular holes, reducing the potential chip misalignment from 46 μm to 8. 5 μm for a probability of fitting of 99. 5 %. For experimental verification, micromachined waveguide chips using either conventional (oversized) circular or the proposed elliptical alignment holes were fabricated and measured. A reduction in the standard deviation of the reflection coefficient by a factor of up to 20 was experimentally observed from a total of 200 measurements with random chip placement, exceeding the expectations from the Monte Carlo analysis. To our knowledge, this paper presents the first solution for highly accurate assembly of micromachined waveguide chips to standard waveguide flanges, requiring no custom flanges or other tailor-made split blocks.

A self-aligning <b>pin</b> <b>alignment</b> system was introduced which did not require the perpendicularity of the pin to be measured. The unmodified system had an alignment within that permitted by the ASTM G 99 - 95 a standard. However, the modified, and improved, alignment system produced significant changes in recorded wear behaviour {{in comparison with the}} unmodified system. The standard deviation of the wear data was considerably reduced and the correlation of the wear data with applied load significantly improved. The modified alignment also reduced the absolute value of wear recorded. This effect was observed for both wear volume assessed from mass change and wear volume assessed from pin height change. The reduced constraint of a misaligned pin in comparison with that of a well-aligned pin may account for the difference in these results...|$|R

40|$|An {{electronic}} instrument {{has been developed}} as a prototype of a portable crane-load contact sensor. Such a sensor could be helpful in an application in which the load rests on a base in a horizontal position determined by vertical <b>alignment</b> <b>pins</b> (see Figure 1). If the crane is not positioned to lift the load precisely vertically, then the load {{can be expected to}} swing once it has been lifted clear of the pins. If the load is especially heavy, large, and/or fragile, it could hurt workers and/or damage itself and nearby objects. By indicating whether the load remains in contact with the pins when it has been lifted a fraction of the length of the pins, the crane-load contact sensor helps the crane operator determine whether it is safe to lift the load clear of the pins: If there is contact, then the load is resting against the sides of the pins and, hence, it may not be safe to lift; if contact is occasionally broken, then the load is probably not resting against the pins, so it should be safe to lift. It is assumed that the load and base, or at least the pins and the surfaces of the alignment holes in the load, are electrically conductive, so the instrument can use electrical contact to indicate mechanical contact. However, DC resistance cannot be used as an indicator of contact for the following reasons: The load and the base are both electrically grounded through cables (the load is grounded through the lifting cable of the crane) to prevent discharge of static electricity. In other words, the DC resistance between the load and the pins is always low, as though they were always in direct contact. Therefore, instead of DC resistance, the instrument utilizes the AC electrical impedance between the pins and the load. The signal frequency used in the measurement is high enough (. 1 MHz) that the impedance contributed by the cables and the electrical ground network of the building in which the crane and the base are situated is significantly greater than the contact impedance between the pins and the load. The instrument includes a signal generator and voltage-measuring circuitry, and is connected to the load and the base as shown in Figure 2. The output of the signal generator (typically having amplitude of the order of a volt) is applied to the load via a 50 -resistor, and the voltage between the load and the pins is measured. When the load and the pins are not in contact, the impedance between them is relatively high, causing the measured voltage to exceed a threshold value. When the load and the pins are in contact, the impedance between them falls to a much lower value, causing the voltage to fall below the threshold value. The voltage-measuring circuitry turns on a red light-emitting diode (LED) to indicate the lower-voltage/ contact condition. Whenever the contact has been broken and the non-contact/higher-voltage condition has lasted for more than 2 ms, the voltage-measuring circuitry indicates this condition by blinking a green LED...|$|R

40|$|Fermi-level pinning {{behavior}} {{has been observed}} at the free surface, oxide interface, metal interface, MBE grown surface, stop-regrown homojunction, and misfit-dislocation pinned heterojunction of GaAs. Theories of such behavior are numerous and disparate. Theories of ideal heterojunction band offsets are less diverse, but have still not converged to a single mechanism. Recent studies of heterojunctions suggest that the conduction-band offsets are rela-tively independent of interface Fermi-level position, including situations in which the interface Fermi-level appears to be strongly "pinned". In "ideal " heterojunctions, the conduction-band offsets and bulk doping determine interface Fermi-level location; among other results, this mechanism allows the two-dimensional electron gas at modulation-doped AlGaAs-GaAs heterojunctions. If "pinned " heterojunctions involve charge densities comparable to those infer-red for Schottky barriers, then the pinning interface states should set up a dipole sufficient to alter the band offsets; the interfacial band alignment should then be dominated by the <b>alignment</b> of the <b>pinning</b> states, rather {{than that of the}} bulk bands.

In this study, the typical Hungarian-Greedy Algorithm (HGA) is used as an example for <b>PIN</b> <b>alignment.</b> The authors propose a HGA with 2 - nearest neighbours (HGA- 2 N) and implement its graphics processing unit (GPU) acceleration. Numerical experiments demonstrate that HGA- 2 N can find alignments that are close to those found by HGA while dramatically reducing computing time. The GPU implementation of HGA- 2 N optimises the parallel pattern, computing mode and storage mode and it improves the computing time ratio between the CPU and GPU compared with HGA when large-scale networks are considered. By using HGA- 2 N in GPUs, conserved PPIs can be observed, and potential PPIs can be predicted. Among the predictions based on 25 common Gene Ontology terms, 42. 8 % {{can be found in the}} Human Protein Reference Database. Furthermore, a new method of reconstructing phylogenetic trees is introduced, which shows the same relationships among five herpes viruses that are obtained using other methods...|$|R
