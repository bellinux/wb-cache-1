5|$|The {{petrification}} motif {{also appears}} in non-scriptural works. The Raghuvamsa of Kalidasa (generally dated 4th century CE) {{notes that the}} wife of Gautama (unnamed here) momentarily becomes the wife of Indra. Without explicitly mentioning the curse, it relates further that she regains her beautiful form and casts away her stony appearance, owing to the grace provided by the dust of Rama's feet, which redeems her. Gautam Patel, author of many works about Kalidasa, credits him as {{the first person to}} introduce the petrification motif. In the Ramavataram too, Rama does not have to touch Ahalya with his foot; the dust from his feet is enough to bring her back to life. As in other versions of the tale, the repentant Ahalya is turned to stone, only to be liberated by Rama, and Indra runs away disguised <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>cat</b> but is cursed to bear the marks of a thousand vulvae. The Ramavataram {{is an example of the}} Bhakti-era poets who exalt Rama as a saviour.|$|E

25|$|Aliens are eusocial life-forms with a {{caste system}} ruled {{over by a}} queen. Their life cycle {{comprises}} several distinct stages: they begin their lives as an egg, which hatches a parasitoid larval form known as a facehugger, which then attaches itself to a living host by, as its name suggests, latching onto its face. In the Alien 3 novelization, Ripley commented that this parasitoid would likely {{be able to use}} a host as small <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>cat,</b> or as large as an elephant.|$|E

25|$|A pet door (also known <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>cat</b> flap or dog door) is {{an opening}} in a door to allow pets to enter and exit without the main door's being opened.

25|$|Exposure to a {{predator}} (such <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>cat)</b> elicits defensive behaviors in laboratory rodents, {{even when the}} animal has never been exposed to a cat. In the hypothalamus, this exposure causes an increase in Fos-labeled cells in the anterior hypothalamic nucleus, the dorsomedial part of the ventromedial nucleus, and in the ventrolateral part of the premammillary nucleus (PMDvl). The premammillary nucleus has {{an important role in}} expression of defensive behaviors towards {{a predator}}, since lesions in this nucleus abolish defensive behaviors, like freezing and flight. The PMD does not modulate defensive behavior in other situations, as lesions of this nucleus had minimal effects on post-shock freezing scores. The PMD has important connections to the dorsal periaqueductal gray, an important structure in fear expression.|$|E
25|$|A 2013 {{article in}} the Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery found that rescuers and veterinarians in the United Kingdom tended to {{distinguish}} feral cats from domesticated cats based on traits such as their levels of socialization, ownership, and confinement, and {{on the amount of}} fear of, interaction with, and dependence upon humans. They found that rescuers and veterinarians tended to agree that feral cats were cats that had not had much human contact (particularly before eight weeks of age), would try to avoid humans, and would prefer to escape rather than attack a human. However, veterinarians and rescuers disagreed on whether a feral cat would tend to hiss and spit at or attack a human during an encounter, and disagreed on whether adult ferals could potentially be tamed. The article provided a composite definition of a feral cat <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>cat</b> that would choose not to interact with humans, could survive with or without human assistance, and would hide or defend itself when trapped rather than allowing itself to be handled.|$|E
500|$|The Skanda Purana tells {{that when}} Gautama arrives, Ahalya {{explains}} the whole tale truthfully, but is cursed by Gautama {{to become a}} stone, because he believes that she acted as a rolling stone, unable to recognise the difference between Indra's and Gautama's gestures and movements. The touch of Rama's feet is prophesied to be her saviour. The terrified Indra escapes <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>cat</b> and is cursed with castration. Ahalya's truthfulness is also observed in the Kathasaritsagara. When Gautama arrives after the act, Indra tries to flee <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>cat</b> but is cursed to bear the marks of a thousand vulvae. When asked by Gautama about her visitor, Ahalya wittily answers {{that it was a}} majjara, a word meaning either [...] "cat" [...] or, when split as ma-jara, [...] "my lover". Gautama laughs and curses her to be turned into stone, but decrees that she will be released by Rama since she at least spoke the truth.|$|E

[...] When a prisoner whom the Nazis believe to be a Jew claims to be German, Spiegelman has difficulty deciding whether to present this character <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>cat</b> or a mouse. [...] Throughout the book, Spiegelman incorporates and highlights banal details from his father's tales, sometimes humorous or ironic, giving a lightness and humanity to the story which [...] "helps carry the weight of the unbearable historical realities".|$|E
500|$|During the {{pre-production}} for the episode, {{the cast}} and crew realized that the Halloween conceit would allow the various cast members to wear costumes, rather than their [...] "usual, realistically plain suits". B. J. Novak called the dress-up experience [...] "fun", noting that [...] "seeing the most serious of our plotlines play out alongside such silly and bizarre visuals was, I think, one of the most inspired ideas of the episode's writer, Greg Daniels." [...] The idea for Pam to be dressed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>cat</b> was inspired by several unused stories, created by Gene Stupnitsky, in which [...] "Pam Beesley must disguise herself as a cat". The plot lines were vetoed by the shows writers, but Stupnitsky successfully petitioned to allow Pam to wear a cat costume.|$|E
500|$|Other authors reinterpreted the Ahalya legend {{from a very}} {{different}} perspective, often depicting Ahalya as a rebel and telling the story from her angle. R. K. Narayan (1906–2001) focuses on the psychological details of the story, reusing the old tale of Indra's disguise as Gautama, his flight <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>cat</b> and Ahalya's petrifaction. The theme of adulterous love is explored in Vishram Bedekar's musical Marathi play Brahma Kumari (1933) and the Malayalam works of P. V. Ramavarier (1941) and M. Parvati Amma (1948). The Ahalya of the Tamil short story writer Ku Pa Rajagopalan (1902–44) also secretly longs for Indra and enjoys dalliance with him. Pratibha Ray's Odia novel Mahamoha (1997, [...] "Great Lust") portrays an independent and nonconformist Ahalya as a tragic heroine, who offers herself to Indra {{so that he can}} fulfil his lust and she her womanhood. When Gautama persuades her to lie to society by claiming to have been raped, she debates chastity and freedom of mind with him.|$|E

500|$|According to the Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Gautama curses Indra {{to bear a}} {{thousand}} vulvae, which will turn to eyes when he worships the sun-god Surya. Ahalya, though innocent, is turned to stone for sixty thousand years and destined to be redeemed only by Rama's touch. Ahalya accepts the verdict without debate. In another version in the same Purana, Gautama catches Indra fleeing <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>cat</b> and curses him with castration. Ahalya's plea of innocence is acknowledged by Gautama, who declares that her mind is pure and she has kept the [...] "vow of chastity and fidelity", but another man's seed has defiled her body. Gautama orders {{her to go to}} the forest and become a stone until rescued by the touch of Rama's feet. In Venkata Krishnappa Nayaka's Telugu rendition, when Indra reluctantly leaves, Gautama arrives and curses Ahalya to become a stone, to be later purified by Rama's feet. After she is freed from the curse, Gautama and Ahalya are reconciled and they spend their days in bed, exploring sexual techniques.|$|E

She works as a bike messenger for courier company Jam Pony {{during the day and}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>cat</b> burglar at night. Michael Weatherly played Logan Cale, the show's second most prominent character. Cale is a wealthy cyber-journalist and vigilante who operates under the alias Eyes Only. He recruits Max to assist with his campaign against corruption and crime in return for helping her find information on her fellow Manticore escapees. Main roles were given to several of the couriers at Jam Pony, including Valarie Rae Miller as Cynthia [...] "Original Cindy" [...] McEachin, Richard Gunn as Calvin [...] "Sketchy" [...] Theodore, and Alimi Ballard as Herbal Thought. J. C. MacKenzie played Reagan [...] "Normal" [...] Ronald, the company's boss, and Jennifer Blanc played Kendra Maibaum, Max's first roommate, [...] and John Savage played the main antagonist, Col.

500|$|The tammar has 324° {{peripheral}} vision and 50° binocular vision. It can distinguish black/white gratings of different widths {{and in different}} light conditions better than most other small mammals, such as rabbits. It is nevertheless not as good <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>cat</b> or a human. Tammars appear to have some colour vision: [...] its eyes have only blue sensitive and green sensitive photoreceptor cones, allowing it to see colour in the blue-green band of the colour spectrum, but not the longer wavelengths of the red-yellow band. Nevertheless, in the band where it can see colour, it can differentiate between two monochromatic colours with wavelengths as close as [...] apart. The pinna (ear) of the tammar is mobile, allowing it to track sounds {{from different parts of}} its surroundings without moving its head. A tammar can point its pinna at a sound source and increase its eardrum's sound pressure by 25–30 dB at 5kHz. When the pinna moves away from the sound source, the animal's hearing level quickly drops. When born, a tammar's sense of smell is already developed; this allows the newborn to find its mother's pouch by the scent.|$|E

In 1974, Track Records-MCA released a Moon solo single covering the Beach Boys' [...] "Don't Worry, Baby" [...] and [...] "Teenage Idol." [...] The next year he released his only solo album, entitled Two Sides of the Moon. Although it featured Moon on vocals, he played drums on only three tracks; most of the drumming was left to others (including Ringo Starr, session musicians Curly Smith and Jim Keltner and actor-musician Miguel Ferrer). The album was received poorly by critics. NME's Roy Carr wrote, [...] "Moonie, if you didn't have talent, I wouldn't care; but you have, which is why I'm not about to accept Two Sides of the Moon." [...] Dave Marsh, reviewing the album in Rolling Stone, wrote: [...] "There isn't any legitimate reason for this album's existence." [...] During one of his few televised solo drum performances (for ABC's Wide World), Moon played a five-minute drum solo dressed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>cat</b> on transparent acrylic drums filled with water and goldfish. When asked by an audience member {{what would happen to the}} kit, he joked that [...] "even the best drummers get hungry."

500|$|Nickelodeon {{assigned}} {{a team of}} producers {{to create a new}} U.S. television program for young children in mid-1994 using research on early childhood education and the viewing habits of preschoolers. Angela Santomero, Todd Kessler, and Traci Paige Johnson met at Nickelodeon Studios for a month to develop Blue's Clues. According to The New York Times, Kessler was the first creator to be brought on board to the project; Santomero and Johnson joined soon after. Kessler had a background in children's television with prior experience on Sesame Street but he disagreed with the program's format because he felt it was too static and not visual enough, according to Malcolm Gladwell's The Tipping Point. He later worked as a freelance producer for Nickelodeon from 1993 to 1994 prior to working on Blue's Clues. Kessler, Santomero, and Johnson, according to Tracy, did not have the traditional backgrounds of most producers of children's programs but [...] "did possess an amazing combination of talents, backgrounds, and personal attributes". Researcher Daniel R. Anderson of the University of Massachusetts Amherst, who had also worked on Sesame Street, was an adviser for the new show. The character Blue was originally conceived <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>cat,</b> {{and the name of the}} show was to be [...] "Blue's Prints," [...] but the show's name was changed and Blue became a dog because Nickelodeon was already producing a show about a cat (presumably CatDog) Kessler handled the show's production, Santomero the research, and Johnson the animation and design. They were given a modest $150,000 to produce a pilot.|$|E
