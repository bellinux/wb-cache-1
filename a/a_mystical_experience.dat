25|$|In 1951, aged nineteen, Rajneesh {{began his}} studies at Hitkarini College in Jabalpur. Asked to leave after {{conflicts}} with an instructor, {{he transferred to}} D. N. Jain College, also in Jabalpur. Having proved himself to be disruptively argumentative, he was not required to attend college classes in D. N. Jain College except for examinations and used his free time {{to work for a}} few months as an assistant editor at a local newspaper. He began speaking in public at the annual Sarva Dharma Sammelan (Meeting of all faiths) held at Jabalpur, organised by the Taranpanthi Jain community into which he was born, and participated there from 1951 to 1968. He resisted his parents' pressure to get married. Rajneesh later said he became spiritually enlightened on 21 March 1953, when he was 21 years old, in <b>a</b> <b>mystical</b> <b>experience</b> while sitting under a tree in the Bhanvartal garden in Jabalpur.|$|E
25|$|Rosenzweig, {{under the}} {{influence}} of his cousins and his close friend Eugen Rosenstock-Huessy, considered converting to Christianity. Determined to embrace the faith as the early Christians did, he resolved to live as an observant Jew first, before becoming Christian. After attending Yom Kippur services at a small Orthodox synagogue in Berlin, he underwent <b>a</b> <b>mystical</b> <b>experience.</b> As a result, he became a baal teshuva. Although he never recorded what transpired, he never again entertained converting to Christianity. In 1913, he turned to Jewish philosophy. His letters to his friend Eugen Rosenstock-Huessy, whom he had nearly followed into Christianity, have been published as Judaism Despite Christianity. Rosenzweig was a student of Hermann Cohen, and the two became close. While writing a doctoral dissertation on Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Hegel and the State, Rosenzweig turned against idealism and sought a philosophy that did not begin with an abstract notion of the human.|$|E
25|$|Casaubon escapes {{the museum}} through the Paris sewers, {{eventually}} fleeing {{to the countryside}} villa where Belbo had grown up. It is unclear by this point how reliable a narrator Casaubon has been, {{and to what extent}} he has been inventing, or deceived by, conspiracy theories. Casaubon soon learns that Diotallevi succumbed to his cancer at midnight on St. John's Eve, coincidentally the same time Belbo died. The novel ends with Casaubon meditating on the events of the book, apparently resigned to the (possibly delusional) idea that the Tres will capture him soon. And when they do, he will follow Belbo's lead, refusing to give them any clues, refusing to create a lie. While waiting, holed up in a farmhouse where Belbo lived years before, he finds an old manuscript by Belbo, a sort of diary. He discovers that Belbo had <b>a</b> <b>mystical</b> <b>experience</b> at the age of twelve, in which he perceived ultimate meaning beyond signs and semiotics. He realizes that much of Belbo's behavior and possibly his creation of the Plan and even his death was inspired by Belbo's desire to recapture that lost meaning.|$|E

On arrival, Lafayette was greeted {{by a group of}} Revolutionary War veterans, who had fought alongside him many years before. [...] New York erupted for four continuous days and nights of celebration. When he departed for what he thought would be a restful trip to Boston, he instead found the route lined by cheering citizens, with welcomes organized in every town along the way. According to Unger, [...] "It was <b>a</b> <b>mystical</b> <b>experience</b> they would relate to their heirs through generations to come. [...] Lafayette had materialized from a distant age, the last leader and hero at the nation's defining moment. They knew they and the world would never see his kind again." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{heard by}} the Belgian {{commission}} on cults, philosopher Luc Nefontaine said that [...] "the establishment of a directory of cult movements (...) seems to him dangerous, because it would also give a bad image of quite honourable organizations such as (...) Antoinism". Eric Brasseur, director of Centre for information and advice on harmful cultish organizations (Centre d'information et d'avis sur les organisations sectaires nuisibles, or CIAOSN) said: [...] "This is a Belgian worship for which we {{have never had a}} complaint in 12 years, a rare case to report". Similarly, in 2013, the Interministerial Mission for Monitoring and Combatting Cultic Deviances (Mission interministérielle de vigilance et de lutte contre les dérives sectaires, or MIVILUDES) made this comment: [...] "We have never received reporting from Antoinists. They heal through prayer, but {{as long as they do}} not prevent people from getting proper treatment by legal means..." [...] In addition, the Renseignements généraux stopped monitoring the religion given the absence of any problem. In 2002, the national service [...] "Pastoral, sects and new beliefs" [...] ("Pastorale, sectes et nouvelles croyances"), which analyses new religious movements from a catholic point of view, wrote about Antoinism: [...] "Although listed among the cults in the 1995 Parliamentary Report, it has no cultish feature." [...] Similarly, Dericquebourg, who deeply studied the religious group, concluded that Antoinism is not a cult: it [...] "has no totalitarian influence on its members, and do not dictate their behaviour to get in the world; it is not exclusive [...] shows no hostility towards social systems". According to Bégot, the group is a [...] "cult" [...] in the sociological language (not to be confused with the pejorative word [...] "cult"), characterized by <b>a</b> <b>mystical</b> <b>experience,</b> a break with the dominant religious tradition, and primacy of the individual on social issues; it has both magical and ethical dimensions.|$|E

Tom Bombadil and the Ents in The Lord of the Rings {{could be considered}} possible examples. In Kenneth Grahame's 1908 children's classic The Wind in the Willows, a depiction of a natural deity, analogous with Pan and Green Man legend, appears as the climax of <b>a</b> <b>mystical</b> <b>experience</b> within the chapter [...] "The Piper at the Gates of Dawn". (Later, the psychedelic rock band Pink Floyd's debut studio album took its name from that chapter.) Elsewhere, Robert Jordan's series The Wheel of Time features a character named Someshta, referred to as [...] "the Green Man". He is the sole survivor of a race called the Nym, who were originally entrusted as the gardeners of the world, and who {{had the ability to}} manipulate the life and growth of plants around them. He first appears in book one, The Eye of the World, in chapters 49 ("The Dark One Stirs") and 50 ("Meetings at the Eye"). He later reappears in book four, The Shadow Rising, in chapter 26 ("The Dedicated"), in a ter'angreal located in Rhuidean.|$|E
2500|$|Carter {{became known}} for his {{religious}} freethinking and support of dissenters even before the Revolution. He resigned from the Cople Parish Church vestry in 1776, and during the following year had <b>a</b> <b>mystical</b> <b>experience</b> while feverish from smallpox inoculation. This prompted further spiritual seeking, from composing his own prayer for God to [...] "have pity upon all Jews, Turks, Infidels & Hereticks", to making trips to experience Quaker, Methodist, Presbyterian and Baptist preachers, as well as investigating Arminianism and perhaps Catholicism (although such was illegal in Virginia at the time). [...] On September 6, 1778, the Rev. Lewis Lunsford baptised Carter in Totuskey Creek. Carter scandalized neighbors further by joining Morattico Baptist Church, a mixed congregation of white and black, free and slave. Carter knew he risked persecution, for Eleazar Clay, another wealthy man, had his life threatened after conversion, and during the three weeks preceding his own baptism Carter attended two different services that were attacked by armed mobs which included Revolutionary War veterans. Frances Ann Tasker Carter, who was declared an invalid in October 1779 {{after the birth of}} their 16th child, moved to Bladensburg, Maryland for health reasons, and eventually converted to the Baptist faith there a year before her death in 1787.|$|E
2500|$|During his 1904 {{retreat from}} Tibet, Younghusband had <b>a</b> <b>mystical</b> <b>experience</b> which suffused him with [...] "love {{for the whole}} world" [...] and {{convinced}} him that [...] "men at heart are divine." [...] This conviction was tinged with regret for the invasion of Tibet, and eventually, in 1936, profound religious convictions invited a founder's address to the World Congress of Faiths (in imitation of the World Parliament of Religions). Younghusband published {{a number of books}} with what one might call New Age themes, with titles like The Gleam: Being an account of the life of Nija Svabhava, pseud. (1920); Mother World (in Travail for the Christ that is to be) (1924); and Life in the Stars: An Exposition of the View that on some Planets of some Stars exist Beings higher than Ourselves, and on one a World-Leader, the Supreme Embodiment of the Eternal Spirit which animates the Whole (1927). The latter drew the admiration of Lord Baden-Powell, the Boy Scouts founder. Key concepts consisted of the central belief that would {{come to be known as}} the Gaia hypothesis, pantheism, and a Christlike [...] "world leader" [...] living on the planet [...] "Altair" [...] (or [...] "Stellair"), exploring the theology of spiritualism, and guidance by means of telepathy.|$|E

2500|$|In 1872 Chase's {{business}} failed. Unemployed, {{he moved}} to Boston leaving his wife and children, where he obtained a meager and unsatisfying living as an actor and singer. In 1873, amidst the Panic of 1873 and subsequent Long Depression and its privations, [...] Chase described having what he called <b>a</b> <b>mystical</b> <b>experience</b> of God's love, of love [...] "unspeakable," [...] of [...] "absolute oneness," [...] which set him on a path of renewed hope in a religious search. Not finding sufficient work to support {{him and his family}} in Boston, Chase moved to Fort Howard (Green Bay, Wisconsin), where he taught school. The first high school graduates of the city ever were in 1875. He moved to Chicago briefly and then {{he moved to}} Kansas with teaching and music tutoring jobs and was visible in the local newspapers in 1879 in a regional music convention. However the school broke up. Next Chase settled in Del Norte, Colorado as an early mining town but was not successful. Meanwhile, Annie remained in Springfield living with her mother and their two daughters, waiting for her husband to provide his family support. However in March 1878 she moved back to Rhode Island and filed for divorce. He wrote a certified letter responding, and despite family pressure to reconcile, Annie persevered and the court granted the divorce. Chase {{had little to do with}} the family after that. Annie lived the rest of her days in Newport, Rhode Island, dying in 1918. Chase's older daughter, Sarah, married in 1895 and had five children before dying suddenly in 1908. Chase's last daughter, Jessamine, never married and became a school teacher and musician; she died in 1947. A letter from some family in New York looking for him was published looking for him some years later in South Dakota. Meanwhile he met and married Eleanor Francesca Hockett Pervier on 6 May 1880 and they settled in Pueblo, Colorado.|$|E
