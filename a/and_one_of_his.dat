5|$|Opinions {{criticizing the}} site rapidly spread {{throughout}} the blogosphere around early 2007. Schlafly appeared on radio programs Today on BBC Radio 4 and All Things Considered on NPR to discuss the site around that time.

5|$|Unlike Hartnell's grave, {{the grave}} of Private William Braine was largely intact. When he was exhumed, the survey team saw signs that his burial had been hasty. His arms, body, and head had not been {{positioned}} carefully in the coffin, <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> undershirts had been put on backwards. The coffin seemed too small for him; its lid had pressed down on his nose. A large copper plaque with his name and other personal data punched into it adorned his coffin lid.|$|E
5|$|A Czech woman went to Heydrich's aid and flagged down a {{delivery}} van. He was first {{placed in the}} driver's cab, but complained the van's movement was causing him pain. He {{was placed in the}} back of the van, on his stomach, and taken to the emergency room at Bulovka Hospital. He had suffered severe injuries to his left side, with major damage to his diaphragm, spleen, <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> lungs. He also had a fractured rib. A doctor, Slanina, packed the chest wound, while another doctor, Walter Diek, tried unsuccessfully to remove the splinters. He immediately decided to operate. This was carried out by Diek, Slanina, and Hohlbaum. Heydrich was given several blood transfusions. A splenectomy was performed. The chest wound, left lung, and diaphragm were all debrided and the wounds closed.|$|E
5|$|A {{plot against}} {{his life was}} revealed, <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> officers, Philotas, was {{executed}} for failing to alert Alexander. The death of the son necessitated {{the death of the}} father, and thus Parmenion, who had been charged with guarding the treasury at Ecbatana, was assassinated at Alexander's command, to prevent attempts at vengeance. Most infamously, Alexander personally killed the man who had saved his life at Granicus, Cleitus the Black, during a violent drunken altercation at Maracanda (modern day Samarkand in Uzbekistan), in which Cleitus accused Alexander of several judgmental mistakes and most especially, of having forgotten the Macedonian ways in favour of a corrupt oriental lifestyle.|$|E

5|$|After the Taino victory {{the colonists}} formed a citizens' militia to defend {{themselves}} against the attacks. Juan Ponce de León <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> top commanders, Diego de Salazar led the Spaniards {{in a series of}} offensives which included a massacre of the Taino forces in the domain of Agüeybaná II. The Spanish offensive culminated in the Battle of Yagüecas against Cacique Mabodomoca. Agüeybaná II was shot and killed, ending the first recorded military action in Puerto Rico. After the failed rebellion, the Tainos were forced to give up their customs and traditions by order of a Royal decree, approved by King Ferdinand II, which required that they adopt and practice the values, religion and language of their conquerors.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there were}} {{conflicting}} reports {{on whether he}} retired from the Army in 1947, 1949 or 1950, he left the army only shortly before the Buffalo Soldiers were disbanded as part of President Harry S. Truman's initiative to integrate the Army. His next job was at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda where he worked as a security guard. By the time he retired for a second time, in 1970, he had become the chief of the guards at the institution. He spent much of his spare time fishing, reading the Bible, and recounting tales of his extensive military experiences, which made him a popular and respected figure within the community. His wife of 57 years, Genevieve Hill Matthews, died in 1986 <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> daughters, Shirley Ann, died two years later.|$|E
5|$|An {{emergency}} subscription {{fund was}} established {{by some of the}} city's wealthiest citizens. Betances and Basora had the city's unsanitary slave barracks torched and a temporary camp set up for its dwellers. A large field at a corner of the city was set aside for a supplementary cemetery, and Betances set and managed a temporary hospital next to it (which was later housed in a permanent structure and became the Hospital San Antonio, the Mayagüez municipal hospital, which still serves the city). However, the epidemic struck the city soon after; Betances' stepmother <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> brothers-in-law would die from it. By October 1856 Betances would {{have to take care of}} the entire operation on his own temporarily.|$|E

Heather Frederiksen won four medals, including gold in the 100m backstroke S8 where she set a new world record time, and Matt Walker, competing in his third Paralympics, won four individual silver and bronze medals and a gold in the 4 × 100 m freestyle relay, whilst James Anderson competed in his fifth Paralympics, taking his individual medal total to 17. Thirteen-year-old Eleanor Simmonds, the youngest of all the British athletes in Beijing, won two gold medals, making her Britains youngest ever individual Paralympic medallist.|$|E
5|$|De Lacy {{witnessed}} charters of the Empress in 1141. During {{the later}} 1140s, de Lacy {{was able to}} recover many of his father's Welsh marcher lands, <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> efforts at Ludlow was later embroidered in the medieval romance Fouke le Fitz Waryn. He and Miles of Gloucester were claimants {{to many of the}} same lands, and during Stephen's reign were generally {{on opposite sides of the}} succession dispute. In June 1153, de Lacy was in the company of Matilda's son, Henry fitzEmpress, who became King Henry II of England in 1154.|$|E
5|$|During the winter, {{they played}} {{baseball}} for Fitzroy Baseball Club, often competing in matches played as curtain raisers {{to the elite}} Australian rules football competition, the Victorian Football League. Saturday night entertainment for the family typically consisted of dinner after the day’s cricket matches for Fitzroy, and Plant, Liddicut and other cricket club personnel were often invited. Under the influence of Plant and Liddicut, the boys were taught to adopt an aggressive approach, using fast feet movement to attack spin bowling in particular. In 1932, Harvey captained the Victorian Under-15 schoolboys team {{on a tour of}} Queensland <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> players was future Victorian and Australian teammate Keith Miller. Harvey graduated to Fitzroy's first XI in 1933–34.|$|E

5|$|Fingleton {{enlisted in}} the {{military}} during World War II and was eventually sent to work on media matters for Prime Minister John Curtin <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> predecessors, Billy Hughes. After the war, Fingleton worked as a political correspondent in Canberra and commentated on cricket {{during the summer months}} in Australia and England. He was a prolific author, {{regarded as one of the}} finest and most stylish cricket writers of his time, producing many books. Fingleton was known for his forthright opinions and willingness to criticise, and his cricket reports were published by newspapers in several countries. He was known for his ongoing feud with Bradman—the pair repeatedly spoke out against one another's judgement and play on the field long after they retired.|$|E
5|$|For his {{achievements}} on 28February, the RAF's most successful {{day of the}} campaign, Cullen was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC). Italian sources recorded that a Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 was only damaged on 28February, not shot down, and that the Breda 20s claimed by the RAF were in fact Fiat BR.20s. Cullen claimed another multiple kill on 3March, when he <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> comrades chased a group of CANT Z.1007bis that had just bombed Larissa, Greece. Catching the retreating bombers south-west of Corfu, No.80 Squadron claimed six destroyed and one probable. Cullen was credited with destroying four CANTs and probably destroying another, though the Italians reported that only two CANT bombers were lost.|$|E
5|$|Goldfaden had an on-again off-again {{relationship}} with Zionism. Some of his earliest poetry was Zionist avant la lettre <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> last plays {{was written in}} Hebrew; several of his plays were implicitly or explicitly Zionist (Shulamith set in Jerusalem, Mashiach Tzeiten?! ending with its protagonists abandoning New York for Palestine); {{he served as a}} delegate from Paris to the World Zionist Congress in 1900. Still, {{he spent most of his}} life (and set slightly more than half of his plays) in the Pale of Settlement and in the adjoining Jewish areas in Romania, and when he left it was never to go to Palestine, but to cities such as New York, London or Paris. This might be understandable when the number of his potential Jewish spectators in Palestine in his time was very small.|$|E
