5|$|Mauna Kea's {{summit is}} one of the best sites in the world for astronomical {{observation}} due to favorable observing conditions. The arid conditions are important for submillimeter and infrared astronomy for this region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The summit is above the inversion layer, keeping most cloud cover below the summit and ensuring the air on the summit is dry, and free of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>pollution.</b> The summit atmosphere is exceptionally stable, lacking turbulence for some of the world's best astronomical seeing. The very dark skies resulting from Mauna Kea's distance from city lights are preserved by legislation that minimizes light pollution from the surrounding area; the darkness level allows the observation of faint astronomical objects. These factors historically made Mauna Kea an excellent spot for stargazing.|$|E
5|$|Resonance of Fate {{takes place}} on Earth in the distant future. When <b>atmospheric</b> <b>pollution</b> nearly annihilates life on Earth, the {{remnants}} of humanity construct a purification system called Basel. In time, the surviving human population create a civilization around Basel's central tower, watched over by its mechanical core Zenith. Zenith ties human lives to quartz stones, making them immune to the pollution while giving them predetermined social status and lifespans. The three protagonists—Zephyr, Leanne, and Vashyron—form a mercenary group that take odd jobs for the populace of Basel. During their missions, they discover a plan by the city's ruling Cardinals to subvert Zenith's rule, and discover their own connections to the Cardinals' plans.|$|E

25|$|Modern smog, {{as found}} {{for example in}} Los Angeles, {{is a type of}} air {{pollution}} derived from vehicular emission from internal combustion engines and industrial fumes that react in the atmosphere with sunlight to form secondary pollutants that also combine with the primary emissions to form photochemical smog.

The <b>atmospheric</b> <b>pollution</b> levels of Los Angeles, Beijing, Delhi, Lahore, Mexico City, Tehran and other cities are increased by inversion that traps pollution close to the ground.

40|$|This study {{examines}} characteristics of <b>atmospheric</b> methylsiloxane <b>pollution</b> in indoor settings where interior renovation/redecoration is being undertaken, {{in addition to}} ordinary family homes and inside family cars. Concentrations of atmospheric methylsiloxane in these locations were approximately one order of magnitude higher than that in outdoor areas. The average indoor concentration of methylsiloxane where renovation was being undertaken was 9. 4 μg/m 3, which is slightly higher than that in an ordinary family home (7. 88 μg/m 3), while samples from family cars showed lower concentration (3. 10 μg/m 3). The indoor atmospheric concentration during renovation/redecoration work was significantly positively correlated with {{the duration of the}} work. The structure of <b>atmospheric</b> methylsiloxane <b>pollution</b> is basically the same in these three venues. The concentration of annulus siloxane was much higher than that of linear compounds (85 % of the total methylsiloxane concentrations). Household dust in average family homes showed total methylsiloxane concentration of 9. 5 μg/m 3 (average); the structure mainly consisted of linear siloxane (approximately 98 % of total concentration), thereby differing from that of <b>atmospheric</b> methylsiloxane <b>pollution.</b> The comparatively high concentration of methylsiloxane in these three venues indicates that interior renovation and decoration work, and even travelling in cars, can involve exposure to more serious siloxane contamination during everyday activities...|$|R

40|$|Based on {{geospatial}} analysis model, this paper analyzes {{the relationship between}} the landscape patterns of source and sink in urban areas and <b>atmospheric</b> haze <b>pollution.</b> Firstly, the classification result and aerosol optical thickness (AOD) of Wuhan are divided into a number of square grids with the side length of 6 km, and the category level landscape indices (PLAND, PD, COHESION, LPI, FRAC_MN) and AOD of each grid are calculated. Then the source and sink landscapes of <b>atmospheric</b> haze <b>pollution</b> are selected based on the analysis of the correlation between landscape indices and AOD. Next, to make the following analysis more efficient, the indices selected before should be determined through the correlation coefficient between them. Finally, due to the spatial dependency and spatial heterogeneity of the data used in this paper, spatial autoregressive model and geo-weighted regression model are used to analyze atmospheric haze effect by source and sink landscape from the global and local level. The results show that the source landscape of <b>atmospheric</b> haze <b>pollution</b> is the building, and the sink landscapes are shrub and woodland. PLAND, PD and COHESION are suitable for describing the atmospheric haze effect by source and sink landscape. Comparing these models, the fitting effect of SLM, SEM and GWR is significantly better than that of OLS model. The SLM model is superior to the SEM model in this paper. Although the fitting effect of GWR model is more unsuited than that of SLM, the influence degree of influencing factors on atmospheric haze of different geography can be expressed clearer. Through the analysis results of these models, following conclusions can be summarized: Reducing the proportion of source landscape area and increasing the degree of fragmentation could cut down aerosol optical thickness; And distributing the source and sink landscape evenly and interspersedly could effectively reduce aerosol optical thickness which represents atmospheric haze pollution; For Wuhan City, the method of adjusting the built-up area slightly and planning the non-built-up areas reasonably can be taken to reduce <b>atmospheric</b> haze <b>pollution...</b>|$|R
