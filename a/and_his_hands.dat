5|$|His head {{hangs in}} exhaustion, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> bleed from the {{puncture}} wounds suffered during his nailing to the cross. His arms are placed higher {{above his head}} and strain to carry {{the weight of his}} body, which visibly slumps. His body takes on a dramatic, almost feminine curve, the result of the contortions forced upon a body nailed to a vertical support.|$|E
5|$|Makeup artist Baker {{provided}} the special makeup effects for The Incredible Melting Man, {{which included the}} gradual melting of Steve West. Rebar wore facial appliances that simulated melting flesh, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> and feet were fitted with liquid substances that dropped off as he walked, creating the appearance that West's body was falling apart. During one scene, a murdered fisherman's severed head falls down a waterfall and smashes on the rocks below. To create the effect, Baker used a gelatin head with a wax skull and fake blood inside, which burst out upon impact.|$|E
5|$|The woman's {{arms were}} {{swinging}} by her side, untied, while about {{twenty feet away}} swung the boy with his clothes partly torn off <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> tided with a saddle string. The only marks on either body were that made by the ropes upon the necks. Gently swaying in the wind, the ghastly spectacle was discovered this morning by a negro boy taking his cow to water. Hundreds of people from Okemah and {{the western part of}} the county went to view the scene.|$|E

5|$|Busch stopped {{painting}} in 1896 and signed-over all publication rights to Bassermann Verlag for 50,000 gold marks. Busch, now aged 64, felt old. He needed spectacles for writing and painting, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> trembled slightly. In 1898, {{together with his}} aging sister Fanny Nöldeke, he accepted Bassermann's suggestion {{to move into a}} large parsonage in Mechtshausen. Busch read biographies, novels and stories in German, English and French. He organized his works and wrote letters and poems. Most of the poems from the collections Schein und Sein and Zu guter Letzt were written in 1899. The following years were eventless for Busch. He developed a sore throat in early January 1908, and his doctor detected a weak heart. During the night of 8–9 January 1908 Busch slept uneasily, taking camphor, and a few drops of morphine as a tranquilizer. Busch died the following morning before his physician, called by Otto Nöldeke, came to assist.|$|E
25|$|Goodfellow {{pioneered the}} use of sterile {{techniques}} in treating gunshot wounds, washing the patient's wound <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> with lye soap or whisky. He became America's leading authority on gunshot wounds and was widely recognized for his skill as a surgeon.|$|E

25|$|The biblical {{regulations}} of Yom Kippur require the officiating Jewish High Priest to bathe himself in water after sending off the scapegoat to Azazel, {{and a similar}} requirement was imposed on the person who led the scapegoat away, {{and the person who}} burned the sacrifices during the rituals of the day. The Mishnah states that the High Priest had to immerse himself five times, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> and feet had to be washed ten times.|$|E
25|$|Twenty {{hours after}} Myrons sinking, Captain Jordon of the steamer W.C. Franz was upbound {{out of the}} Soo Locks and {{on the lookout for}} {{survivors}} when he sighted a body moving on wreckage near Ile Parisienne. Captain Jordon launched a lifeboat and rescued a half-dead Captain Neal from the roof of Myrons pilothouse. Captain Neal's clothing was frozen to his body <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> were so swollen that 2 finger rings were not visible but he survived.|$|E

25|$|In 1963, Stewart {{adopted the}} Mod {{lifestyle}} and look, and began fashioning the spiky rooster hairstyle {{that would become}} his trademark. (It was made possible with sugar water or large amounts of his sisters' hair lacquer, backcombing, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> holding it in place {{to protect it from}} the winds of the Highgate Underground station.) Disillusioned by rock and roll, he saw Otis Redding perform in concert and began listening to Sam Cooke records; he became fascinated by rhythm and blues and soul music.|$|E
25|$|Perón {{was buried}} in La Chacarita Cemetery in Buenos Aires. On 10 June 1987, his tomb was desecrated, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> and some {{personal}} effects, including his sword, were stolen. Perón's hands were cut off with a chainsaw. A ransom letter asking for US$8million was sent to some Peronist members of Congress. This profanation was a ritualistic act to condemn Perón's spirit to eternal unrest, according to journalists David Cox and Damian Nabot in their book Second Death, who connected it to Licio Gelli and military officers involved during Argentina's Dirty War. The bizarre incident remains unresolved.|$|E
25|$|Johnny O'Keefe {{enjoyed the}} drive. In {{the early hours}} of 27 June 1960, O'Keefe, Johnny Greenan and Greenan's wife Janice were driving back to Sydney from the Queensland Gold Coast. About 20 {{kilometres}} north of Kempsey, the Plymouth ploughed into a gravel truck. While the front of the large car bore the brunt of the very severe impact, all three were seriously injured. O'Keefe's face was smashed and Johnny Greenan was thrown out of the car, landing six metres away on the highway, causing a fractured vertebra and loss of front teeth; Janice Greenan suffered a severe concussion. O'Keefe suffered multiple lacerations, a concussion and fractures to his head and face; he lost four teeth, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> were also badly lacerated.|$|E

25|$|Sometime {{during the}} day on New Year's Eve 1977, Fossey's {{favorite}} gorilla, Digit, was killed by poachers. As the sentry of study group 4, he defended the group against six poachers and their dogs, who ran across the gorilla study group while checking antelope traplines. Digit took five spear wounds in ferocious self-defence and managed to kill one of the poachers' dogs, allowing the other 13 members of his group to escape. Poachers sell gorilla hands as delicacies, magic charms or to make ash trays. Digit was decapitated, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> cut off for ashtrays, {{for the price of}} $20. After his mutilated body was discovered by research assistant Ian Redmond, Fossey's group captured one of the killers. He revealed the names of his five accomplices, three of whom were later imprisoned.|$|E
25|$|How {{dangerous}} {{it was to}} {{be accused}} of being an atheist at this time is illustrated by the examples of Étienne Dolet, who was strangled and burned in 1546, and Giulio Cesare Vanini, who received a similar fate in 1619. In 1689 the Polish nobleman Kazimierz Łyszczyński, who had denied the existence of God in his philosophical treatise De non existentia Dei, was imprisoned unlawfully; despite Warsaw Confederation tradition and king Sobieski's intercession, Łyszczyński was condemned to death for atheism and beheaded in Warsaw after his tongue was pulled out with a burning iron <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> slowly burned. Similarly in 1766, the French nobleman François-Jean de la Barre, was tortured, beheaded, and his body burned for alleged vandalism of a crucifix, a case that became a cause célèbre because Voltaire tried unsuccessfully to have the judgment reversed.|$|E
25|$|Wallach and Eastwood flew to Madrid {{together}} and between shooting scenes, Eastwood would relax and practice his golf swing. Wallach was almost poisoned during filming when he accidentally drank {{from a bottle}} of acid that a film technician had set next to his soda bottle. Wallach mentioned this in his autobiography and complained that while Leone was a brilliant director, he was very lax about ensuring {{the safety of his}} actors during dangerous scenes. For instance, in one scene, where he was to be hanged after a pistol was fired, the horse underneath him was supposed to bolt. While the rope around Wallach's neck was severed, the horse was frightened a little too well. It galloped for about a mile with Wallach still mounted <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> bound behind his back. The third time Wallach's life was threatened was during the scene where he and Mario Brega—who are chained together—jump out of a moving train. The jumping part went as planned, but Wallach's life was endangered when his character attempts to sever the chain binding him to the (now dead) henchman. Tuco places the body on the railroad tracks, waiting for the train to roll over the chain and sever it. Wallach, and presumably the entire film crew, were not aware of the heavy iron steps that jutted one foot out of every box car. If Wallach had stood up from his prone position at the wrong time, one of the jutting steps could have decapitated him.|$|E

500|$|In 1774, the First Continental Congress convened, {{and both}} Ward and Hopkins were {{chosen as the}} {{delegate}}s from Rhode Island. [...] Hopkins, at age 68, was senior to every delegate there, and {{was only one of}} two of the 55 delegates (the other being Benjamin Franklin) who had attended the Albany Congress 20 years earlier. [...] Over the previous several years Hopkins had developed palsy in his hands, and this greatly affected his ability to write. [...] At the seating of this congress, Henry Arniett Brown wrote, [...] "yonder sits the oldest of them all. [...] His form is bent, his thin locks, fringing a forehead bowed with age and honorable service, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> shake tremulously as he folds them in his lap. [...] It is Stephen Hopkins." ...|$|E
500|$|Members of {{the crew}} would later provide {{conflicting}} accounts of Heywood's actions during the mutiny. Boatswain William Cole testified that Heywood had been detained on the ship against his will. Ship's carpenter William Purcell thought that Heywood's ambiguous behaviour during the critical hours—he had been seen unwittingly resting his {{hand on top of}} a cutlass—was due to his youth and the excitement of the moment, and that he had no hand in the uprising itself. On the other hand, Midshipman John Hallett reported that Bligh, with a bayonet at his breast <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> tied, had addressed a remark to Heywood who had [...] "laughed, turned round and walked away". Another midshipman, Thomas Hayward, claimed he had asked Heywood his intentions and been told by the latter that he would remain with the ship, from which Hayward assumed that his messmate had sided with the mutineers.|$|E
500|$|Nathaniel Hawthorne, {{though a}} {{founding}} member, was unhappy {{during his tenure}} as a Brook Farmer, partly because {{he was unable to}} write while living there. [...] "I have no quiet at all", he complained, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> were covered [...] "with a new crop of blisters—the effect of raking hay". He later presented a fictionalized portrait of his experience in his 1852 novel, The Blithedale Romance. He acknowledged the resemblance in his introduction, saying [...] "in the 'Blithedale' of this volume, many readers will probably suspect a faint and not very faithful shadowing of Brook Farm, in West Roxbury, which (now a little more than ten years ago) was occupied and cultivated by a company of socialists." [...] The chapter called [...] "The Masqueraders", for example, was based on a picnic held one September to celebrate the harvest season. George Ripley, who reviewed the book for the New York Tribune, said that former Brook Farmers would only notice the resemblance in the humorous parts of the story. Some have also seen a resemblance between Margaret Fuller and Hawthorne's fictional character Zenobia. In the novel, a visitor—a writer like Hawthorne—finds that hard farm labor is not conducive to intellectual creativity.|$|E
