5|$|At {{the end of}} 2001 {{and into}} 2002, CZW's {{territory}} (that is, the area at which they held {{the majority of their}} events) was shifting from Sewell, New Jersey to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in order to hold events regularly at the old ECW arena, beginning with December 15's Cage of Death 3. At this event, they faced Nick Gage and Nate Hatred, but wore masks and were identified as The Midnight Outlaws. This was likely to get around the fact that Jay was only 17 and Mark only 16 at the time; this meant, as they were under 18 years of age, that they could not legally work in a sport wrestling exhibition in the state of Pennsylvania. As CZW regularly began holding shows in the Philadelphia area, the Midnight Outlaws made appearances at the next four CZW events. At A Higher Level of Pain on April 13, 2002, Jay appeared across the ring from the Midnight Outlaws, tagging with Ruckus against Mark <b>and</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else.</b> By this time, he had turned 18. Jay and Ruckus were won the match, and this was the last time either Jay or Mark appeared for CZW until April 12, 2003, where Jay and Mark both returned for Best of the Best 3. Jay was a surprise entrant after being taunted by A.J. Styles, and Mark filling in for the injured Ruckus. Jay advanced to the semi finals, where he lost to B-Boy, and Mark lost his fill-in match to Sonjay Dutt. The two faced off with the Backseat Boyz for the CZW World Tag Team Championship at Truth or Consequences on June 14, but failed to win the belts.|$|E
25|$|The {{official}} {{press release}} stated that Peterson resigned, but Hunt {{had said the}} conversation had been on-going throughout the season. Hunt said his decision to relieve Peterson of duties was not based on what happened the previous day, when the Chiefs lost an 11-point lead in the final 73seconds and were beaten 22–21 by San Diego, dropping their record to 2–12. Hunt {{also said that the}} fate of head coach Herman Edwards would be settled after the season. Hunt said he would split the duties previously held by Peterson and have someone in charge of the business side <b>and</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> in charge of football for the franchise. Hunt said he plans on hiring someone from outside the organization.|$|E

[...] Passersby carried Billy Clanton to the Harwood house, where Tom had been taken. Billy was in {{considerable}} pain and asked for a doctor and some morphine. He told those near him, [...] "They have murdered me. I have been murdered. Chase the crowd away and from the door and give me air." [...] Billy gasped for air, <b>and</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> heard him say, [...] "Go away and let me die." [...] Ike Clanton, who had repeatedly threatened the Earps with death, was still running. William Cuddy testified that Ike passed him on Allen Street and Johnny Behan saw him a few minutes later on Toughnut Street.|$|E

500|$|Following the video's premiere on MTV, Gaga {{explained}} {{some of the}} its {{scenes and}} her inspiration: [...] "The video is quite complex {{in the way that}} the story is told, and it's meant to be slightly linear and slightly twisted and confusing, which is the way that love is." [...] Regarding the sexual intercourse scenes between actor Taylor Kinney and the singer as a mermaid, Gaga explained that it emphasized metaphorically that sometimes relationships did not work. [...] "No matter what you do, there's this giant boundary between you <b>and</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else.</b> So that's what it's about, perceiving in your imagination that there's something magical inside of you that you can make it work," [...] she said.

500|$|Alan Partridge {{was created}} for the 1991 BBC Radio 4 comedy {{programme}} On The Hour, a spoof of British current affairs broadcasting, as the show's hapless sports presenter. He is portrayed by Steve Coogan, who had performed a similar character for a BBC college radio station at university. On The Hour writers Armando Iannucci, Patrick Marber, Richard Herring and Stewart Lee wrote much of Partridge's original material, although Herring credits the creation to Coogan and Iannucci. Iannucci asked Coogan to do a voice for a generic sports reporter; according to Iannucci, [...] "Someone said, 'He's an Alan!' <b>and</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> said, 'He's a Partridge!' Within minutes we knew where he lived, we'd worked out his back story, what his aspirations were." [...] Coogan said Partridge was originally a [...] "one-note, sketchy character" [...] and [...] "freak show", but became [...] "more and more refined {{as sort of a}} dysfunctional alter ego" [...] over the years.|$|E
500|$|Two riders very {{disappointed}} with their results were Michael Matthews and Fabian Cancellara. Matthews crashed {{at high speed}} shortly before the Cipressa and arrived at the finish with a bandaged right elbow. He said: [...] "Obviously I'm devastated. [...] This was everything, this was my world championships {{for the start of}} the season. [...] I was really looking forward to making a good finale, it's really unfortunate that a crash stopped me from doing that." [...] Cancellara, who was riding the event for the last time before retirement at the end of the 2016 season, was held up in Gaviria's crash after having stayed in the leading group. He described his final kilometres as difficult, as he had been isolated from his teammates, saying that the other riders mainly attacked him and did not work with him. Another rider who was almost involved when Gaviria fell was Peter Sagan, who confirmed that the peloton had covered Cancellara in particular. He went on to describe the moment of Gaviria's crash: [...] "Then I got away with Boasson Hagen, Gaviria <b>and</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else.</b> Then with about 500 metres to go, Gaviria looked around because the group was coming up. He went down and I only just managed to avoid him. I stayed up but I lost a lot speed and never managed to get going again in the final metres." ...|$|E

Baden-Powell wrote that a Scout should paddle his own canoe, metaphorically speaking.

2500|$|Almost {{immediately}} following the team selection, controversy arose regarding the two teams selected. Michigan State QB Kirk Cousins, whose team failed {{to qualify for a}} BCS game because it did not finish in the top 14 of the BCS standings, criticized the potential selection of Michigan after his team's debilitating 42-39 loss [...] to Wisconsin in the Big Ten Championship Game, [...] "I don't see how you get punished for playing <b>and</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> gets to sit on the couch and get what they want". Michigan State had defeated the University of Michigan 28-14 in East Lansing earlier that season. [...] Others criticized the selection of Virginia Tech, stating that both Kansas State and Boise State were more deserving of the bid and that the bowl committee had chosen a familiar team as opposed to a new one. [...] The bowl was considered the lowest-ranked match-up of two teams {{in the history of the}} BCS.|$|E
2500|$|The {{programme}} {{has given}} rise to the term 'Skins party', referring to a debauched night of heavy drinking and recreational drug use.

[...] Two hundred people turned up, breaking into the house and causing over £20,000 of seemingly deliberate damage.

Similar incidents have taken place in the Republic of Ireland, with major household damage and theft of personal property being reported in Firhouse, Bray and Drogheda. Although these attacks have not been conclusively linked to the show, news outlets have reported that they are called Skins parties. Club nights marketed as 'Skins Secret Parties' have also taken shape in Leicester and Brighton. Following this, a series of parties were run by Company Pictures in spring 2008.|$|E

2500|$|According to Meyer, {{the book}} was {{inspired}} and influenced by Wuthering Heights by Emily Brontë, although she does not like the book. She said that characters of the book fascinate her and she enjoys reading certain parts, but does not enjoy the book as a whole because she finds it very depressing—an opinion expressed by Edward in Eclipse. When comparing Edward and Jacob to Heathcliff and Edgar Linton of Wuthering Heights, she said, [...] "You could look at Edward and Jacob from one perspective and say: Okay, this one is Heathcliff {{and this one is}} Edgar. <b>And</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> might say: No, wait a second.

2500|$|Both Russia and Bulgaria {{condemned}} the report. [...] "For Bulgaria, this case closed {{with the court}} decision in Rome in March 1986", Foreign Ministry spokesman Dimitar Tsanchev said, while also recalling the Pope's comments during his May 2002 visit to Bulgaria. Senator Guzzanti said that the commission had decided to re-open the report's chapter on the assassination attempt in 2005, after the Pope wrote about it in his last book, [...] The Pope wrote that he was convinced the shooting was not Ağca's initiative and that [...] "someone else masterminded it <b>and</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> commissioned it". The Mitrokhin Commission also claimed Romano Prodi, a former Prime Minister of Italy, was the [...] "KGB's man in Italy". At the end of December 2006, Mario Scaramella, {{one of the main}} informers of senator Guzzanti, was arrested and charged, among other things, of defamation. Rome's prosecutor Pietro Salvitti, in charge of the investigations concerning Mario Scaramella, cited by La Repubblica, showed that Nicolò Pollari, head of SISMI, the Italian military intelligence agency and indicted in the Imam Rapito affair, as well as SISMI n°2, Marco Mancini, arrested in July 2006 for the same reason, were some of the informers, alongside Mario Scaramella, of senator Paolo Guzzanti. Beside targeting Romano Prodi and his staff, this [...] "network", according to Pietro Salvitti's words, also aimed at defaming General Giuseppe Cucchi (current director of the CESIS), Milan's judges Armando Spataro, in charge of the Imam Rapito case, and Guido Salvini, as well as La Repubblica reporters Carlo Bonini and Giuseppe D'Avanzo, who discovered the Yellowcake forgery affair. The investigation also showed a connection between Scaramella and the CIA, in particular through Filippo Marino, one of Scaramella's closest partners since the 1990s and co-founder of the ECPP, who lives today in the US. Marino has acknowledged in an interview an association with former and active CIA officers, including Robert Lady, former CIA station chief in Milan, indicted by prosecutor Armando Spataro for having coordinated the abduction of Abu Omar, the Imam Rapito affair ...|$|E
