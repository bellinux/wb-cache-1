30|$|Two recent {{additions}} to LUISA set it apart from similar land-use models. The first addition considers the parallel endogenous <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>number</b> {{of people to}} the model’s 100  m grid, which is described here briefly; for a detailed overview see Batista e Silva et al. [22]. In LUISA’s people allocation method, in each time step a region’s population is distributed over space. The distributed population and threshold rules are subsequently used to simulate the conversion to urban and abandoned urban land uses before all other simulated land-use types are allocated in the discrete land-use allocation method. Following observed land-use and population distributions, pixels become urban if their modelled population exceeds 6 inhabitants; conversely, urban pixels become ‘abandoned’ when their modelled population declines below 2 inhabitants. The distribution of population is foremost based on a `population potential’ function that describes likely population counts per grid unit. This is a linear function incorporating neighbourhood interdependencies, the log-linear distance to the closest road, current potential accessibility, slope and current land uses; it is fitted on the observed 2006 population distribution by means of spatial econometric methods. For an overview of spatial econometric methods see Anselin [34]. Population allocation in LUISA is subsequently restricted by three factors. Regional urban land demands are accounted for, implying that minimum and maximum limits are imposed {{on the number of}} pixels that reach the urbanization threshold. Regional urban land demands are based on: 1) recent Europop 2010 population projections [35]; 2) an assumed Europe-wide convergence of average household sizes on the very long run (i.e., to 1.8 in all regions by 2100, so that in most regions a limited decrease in household size is modelled by 2030); and 3) extrapolated historical trends of regional urban land consumption per household. In each time step the population distribution method allocates the net regional population growth in a region, as projected by Eurostat, as well as 10  % of the pre-existing population in order to take internal movements into account. The 10  % internally moving population is a coarse estimate of internal movements that is used because projected internal migration numbers are unavailable. Lastly, the method is restricted by per-pixel housing supply, which is approximated in terms of inhabitant capacity in the model and is instrumental in imposing a larger degree of inertia on the model results. Approximated housing supply increases potential population if current population undershoots population capacity, and it penalizes population potential if population counts are higher than housing supply. Every five time steps it assumes the values from current modelled population counts to proxy structural changes in housing supply.|$|E

30|$|Other {{countries}} such as the USA and Germany have similar databases but they use stratification. For example, the US Social Security Administration (SSA) has been compiling a Continuous Work History Sample (CWHS) since the late 1930 s’, which is a one-percent stratified cluster probability sample of all possible Social Security numbers. The population, or sampling frame, from which the CWHS cases are selected consists of the 1 billion possible nine-digit Social Security numbers (SSNs). These digits represent the geographical area <b>of</b> each <b>number</b> allocated, a group for the date of issue and a random serial number [Smith (1989)]. The numbers are thus stratified geographically by place of application for SSN and chronologically by the process <b>of</b> <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>numbers</b> within each stratum.

500|$|In 1919, {{the state}} {{numbered}} its highways {{for the first}} time. In the initial <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>numbers,</b> M-10 was assigned to a highway that started at the Ohio state line south of Monroe, ran northeasterly along Telegraph Road into Dearborn and turned easterly into Detroit. From there, the highway turned north along Woodward Avenue through Pontiac and Dixie Highway through Flint and Saginaw to Bay City. Then M-10 ran along the Saginaw Bay to Standish and turned to follow the Lake Huron shoreline, with some substantial deviations inland. The highway generally followed the lakeshore {{as far north as}} Alpena and Rogers City, and from there, M-10 ran due west through Onaway before turning north into Cheboygan. The last section of M-10 followed the Lake Huron shoreline to Mackinaw City, where it terminated. This designation lasted until November 11, 1926, when the United States Numbered Highway System was created. In Michigan's initial <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> highways, four new designations replaced M-10: US24 from the state line north to Dearborn, US112 between Dearborn and Detroit, US10 from Detroit to Saginaw, and US23 [...] from Saginaw to Mackinaw City.
