5|$|Mariano Moreno {{had several}} {{contacts}} with groups seeking {{the removal of}} Cisneros, but was not strongly involved with the May Revolution, which considered {{the fall of the}} Junta of Seville a reason to depose the viceroy and create a local junta. At the time, Moreno was still loyal to Álzaga. He attended the May 22 open Cabildo, but according to the father of Vicente Fidel López and the father-in-law of Bartolomé Mitre (both direct witness) he stayed silent <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> and did not join the debate. He voted for Saavedra's proposal: to remove viceroy Cisneros and replace him with a Junta. Manuel Hermenegildo Aguirre, captain of hussars, proposed that the Cabildo take the reins of government, with five men appointed as counselors, Moreno among them. However, nobody else voted for that proposal, and it {{was the only one that}} included him. Moreno felt betrayed when the Cabildo twisted the results of the open Cabildo and created a Junta that would be headed by Cisneros. He refused any further contacts with the revolutionaries and stayed home during the remaining events. The definitive members of the Junta came from a popular petition signed on May 25, which was given to the Cabildo. The reasons of Moreno's inclusion in the list are unclear, as with all other members of the Junta. A commonly accepted theory considers it to be a balance between Carlotists and Alzaguists.|$|E

25|$|The S-Bahn {{platforms}} {{were located}} on the outsides of the connecting curves. Platform B was on the track connecting the Stadtbahn to the northern Ringbahn, while platform C was on the southern curve connecting towards Treptower Park. They were removed respectively in 1970 and 1978 due to their dilapidation. After that, trains ran from the northern or southern Ringbahn without stopping, while trains running {{in the opposite direction}} from both the northern and southern Ringbahn continued to stop <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> or the other of platform A.|$|E
25|$|A large {{quantity}} of material including metal objects and textiles was formed into two folded or packed heaps on {{the east end of}} the central wooden structure. This included the extremely rare survival of a long coat of ring-mail, made of alternate rows of welded and riveted iron links, two hanging bowls, leather shoes, a cushion stuffed with feathers, folded objects of leather and a wooden platter. <b>At</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> of the heaps lay an iron hammer-axe with a long iron handle, possibly a weapon.|$|E

25|$|Earth's axis remains tilted in {{the same}} {{direction}} with reference to the background stars throughout a year (regardless of where it is in its orbit). This means that one pole (and the associated hemisphere of Earth) will be directed away from the Sun <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> of the orbit, and half an orbit later (half a year later) this pole will be directed towards the Sun. This is the cause of Earth's seasons. Summer occurs in the Northern hemisphere when the north pole is directed toward the Sun. Variations in Earth's axial tilt can influence the seasons and is likely a factor in long-term climate change (also see Milankovitch cycles).|$|E
25|$|After the {{departure}} of Nusrat Hussain, Salman Ahmad contacted Brian O'Connell and invited him to play bass on the band's second album. Brian O'Connell quit {{his job as a}} social worker and travelled 10,000 miles to Karachi, Pakistan, where he reunited with his old friend. It was after ten years both the friends reunited. In 1992, the band started working on their second studio album. The album was recorded and mixed at Tahir Gul Hasan's Sound on Sound recording studios in Karachi. While working on their second album <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>side,</b> on the other hand the band also featured in a television series, Talaash, directed by Atiqa Odho and written by Anwar Maqsood, based on the true story of the band in which the band members acted themselves and due to its novel storyline it became an extremely popular television series in Pakistan.|$|E
25|$|A {{literary}} masterpiece {{from the}} 13th dynasty talking about Khufu {{is the famous}} Papyrus Westcar, where king Khufu witnesses a magical wonder and receives a prophecy from a magician named Dedi. Within the story, Khufu is characterised in a difficult-to-assess way. <b>At</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> he is depicted as ruthless when deciding to have a condemned prisoner decapitated to test the alleged magical powers of Dedi. At the other side Khufu is depicted as inquisitive, reasonable and generous: He accepts Dedi's outrage and his subsequent alternative offer for the prisoner, questions the circumstances and contents of Dedi's prophecy and rewards the magician generously after all. The contradictory depiction of Khufu {{is the object of}} great dispute between Egyptologists and historians to this day. Especially earlier Egyptologists and historians such as Adolf Erman, Kurt Heinrich Sethe and Wolfgang Helck evaluated Khufu's character as heartless and sacrilegious. They lean on the ancient Greek traditions of Herodotus and Diodorus Siculus, who described an exaggerated negative character image of Khufu, ignoring the paradoxical (because positive) traditions the Egyptians themselves had always taught.|$|E

[...] Between the towers is either a single large traceried window, as at York and Canterbury, or an {{arrangement}} of untraceried lancets, as at Ripon and Wells, rather than the rose windows typical of French facades. There are usually three doors but unlike those of French cathedrals, they are rarely highly elaborate and far more {{emphasis is placed on}} the central door than those to either side.

500|$|Infantry {{units in}} 1809 {{wore a black}} polrock or [...] "Polish coat", a type of frock coat derived from a Lithuanian garment called a litewka which had six pairs of black lace {{fastenings}} down the front. A tall collar showed the regimental colour. Trousers were black with a blue stripe; footwear was black shoes with buttoned gaiters. They wore a shako on their heads, with the skull or a hunting horn badge for light infantry, also a black feather or horsehair plume. The shako, backpack and other equipment were of Austrian design and manufacture. The Sharpshooter companies wore a dark green Prussian-style coatee and a tall hat of Austrian origin with an elongated brim turned-up <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>side.</b> In the Peninsular War, the polrock {{was replaced by a}} short black koller or cavalry-style tunic.

500|$|The East Plaza covers {{an area of}} , {{making it}} the largest open {{ceremonial}} space in the entire city. On its east side it is delimited by 2 medium-height structures (East Plaza Structures 1 and 2), {{on the south side}} by the base of the acropolis, on the west side by Structure 3 of the West Plaza and on the north side by the South Structure of the Northeast Plaza. Six stelae and three altars were found in the East Plaza. The plaza had two construction phases, the first dated to the Late Classic and the second to the Terminal Classic. A few Late Preclassic ceramic fragments were also recovered. The levelling of the East Plaza involved a considerable inversion of labour due to the limestone bedrock being extremely close to the surface <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> and [...] under the surface at the other.|$|E
