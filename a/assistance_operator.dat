50|$|Androla {{was born}} in New Castle, Pennsylvania to a family of mixed Syrian and Italian ancestry. In the early 1970s, Androla {{attended}} Point Park College and later Franconia College, where he studied under poet Robert Grenier and came {{under the influence of}} Language poets whom he emulated at the time. However, he regards himself as part of a tradition of underground American poetry that largely rejects academic context. He considers his entry into the labor force as the true inception of his poetic vocation. For over thirty years, he worked in factories as a pressure press operator. The faces and personas of coworkers often feature in his poetry, which sketches the minutiae of working-class existence in the United States in a confessional style. Before retiring, Androla also worked as a directory <b>assistance</b> <b>operator</b> for a major telecommunications company. His writing credits continue to accumulate, spanning over half a century of publishing.|$|E

5000|$|A similar {{service was}} {{provided}} in North America using toll stations or [...] "ring downs", individual subscribers who were connected over many miles of landline directly to AT&T long distance with no local calling area. Reachable only with <b>operator</b> <b>assistance,</b> these served points like Deep Springs College in Deep Springs, California (whose telephone number {{for much of}} the 1980s remained [...] "Deep Springs Toll Station #2"), far corners of the Nevada or California deserts and a few individual ranches in very remote corners of the Texas Panhandle. In Canada, regional incumbent local exchange carriers (such as Telus in Alberta, MTS in Manitoba or Bell Canada in Ontario and Quebec) provided <b>operator</b> <b>assistance</b> to complete inbound calls to non-dialable points.|$|R
40|$|A {{persistent}} {{problem for}} keyword-driven speech recognition sys-tems is that users often embed the to-be-recognized words or phrases in longer utterances. The recognizer needs {{to locate the}} relevant sections of the speech signal and ignore extraneous words. Prosody might provide an extra source of information to help locate target words embedded inother speech. In this paper we examine some prosodic haracteristics of 160 such utterances and compare matched read and spontaneous versions. Half of the utterances are from a corpus of spontaneous answers to requests {{for the name of}} a city, recorded from calls to Directory <b>Assistance</b> <b>Operators.</b> The other half are the same word strings read by volun-teers attempting tomodel the real dialogue. Results how a consis-tent pattern across both sets of data: embedded city names almost always bear nuclear pitch accents and are in their own intonational phrases. However the distributions of tonal make-up of these pro-sodic features differ markedly in read versus pontaneous speech, implying that if algorithms that exploit hese prosodic regularities are trained on read speech, then the probabilities are likely to be incorrect models of real user speech. 2...|$|R
5000|$|In the 1960s, once most phone {{subscribers}} had direct long-distance dialing, {{a single}} type of operator began to serve both {{the local and}} long distance functions. A customer might call to request a collect call, a call billed to a third number, or a person-to-person call. All toll calls from coin phones required <b>operator</b> <b>assistance.</b> The <b>operator</b> was also available to help complete a local or long-distance number which did not complete. For example, if a customer encountered a reorder tone (a fast busy signal), it could indicate [...] "all circuits busy," [...] or {{a problem in the}} destination exchange. The operator might be able to use a different routing to complete the call. If the operator could not get through by dialing the number, she could call the inward operator in the destination city, and ask her to try the number, or to test a line {{to see if it was}} busy or out of order.|$|R
5000|$|In an emergency, {{the caller}} might simply say [...] "Get me the police", [...] "I want {{to report a}} fire", or [...] "I need an {{ambulance}} or doctor". Until dial service came into use, one could not place calls without proper <b>operator</b> <b>assistance.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{rooms in}} which {{operators}} work are called <b>operator</b> <b>assistance</b> centres (OACs). There are BT OACs in Bangor, Blackburn, Dundee, Glasgow, Liverpool, Newport, and Nottingham.The rooms in which emergency response operators work are called Emergency Control Centres (ECCs) and are operated by local authorities.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} North American {{toll-free number}} was the Zenith number, published in one distant city (or a few cities) only. Published as [...] "Zenith" [...] and a five-digit number, these collect calls required <b>operator</b> <b>assistance.</b> The called party was charged for the operator-assisted call.|$|R
50|$|Until 1990, Albania {{was one of}} the world's most {{isolated}} and controlled countries, and installation and maintenance of a modern system of international and domestic telecommunications was precluded.

50|$|Subscriber trunk {{dialling}} (STD, {{also known}} as subscriber toll dialling) is a telephone system allowing subscribers to dial trunk calls without <b>operator</b> <b>assistance.</b> The term was introduced when it first became possible for long-distance calls to be dialled directly, and is now rarely used where calls to any destination can be dialled.|$|R
30|$|In the 2 D experiment, {{it was a}} {{relatively}} easy to notice the <b>assistance</b> because the <b>operators</b> easily controlled the marker and obtained all information.
