40|$|International audienceBiomechanics of the {{extracellular}} matrix in arteries determines their macroscopic mechanical behavior. In particular, {{the distribution of}} collagen fibers and bundles plays a significant role. Experimental data showed that in most arterial walls there are preferred fiber directions. However, the realignment of collagen fibers during tissue deformation is still controversial: whilst authors claim that fibers should undergo <b>affine</b> <b>deformations,</b> others showed the contrary. In order to have an insight about this important question of <b>affine</b> <b>deformations</b> at the microscopic scale, we measured the realignment of collagen fibers in the adven-titia layer of carotid arteries using multiphoton microscopy combined with an unprecedented Fourier based method. We compared the realignment for two types of macroscopic loading applied on arterial segments: axial tension under constant pressure (scenario 1) and inflation under constant axial length (scenario 2). Results showed that, although the tissue underwent macroscopic stretches beyond 1. 5 in the circumferential direction, fiber directions remained unchanged during scenario 2 loading. Conversely, fibers strongly realigned along the axis direction for scenario 2 Witold Krasny 1, 2, 3, 4 et al. 1 loading. In both cases, the motion of collagen fibers did not satisfy <b>affine</b> <b>deformations,</b> with {{a significant difference between}} both cases: affine predictions strongly underestimated fiber reorientations in uniaxial tension and overestimated fiber reorientations during inflation at constant length. Finally, we explained this specific kinematics of collagen fibers by the complex tension-compression interactions between very stiff collagen fibers and compliant surrounding proteins. A tenseg-rity representation of the {{extracellular matrix}} in the adventitia taking into account these interactions was proposed to model the motion of collagen fibers during tissue deformation...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{continuation}} of the previous paper of the author[M]. We show that an <b>affine</b> <b>deformation</b> space of a hyperbolic surface of type (g,b) can be parametrized by Margulis invariants and affine twist parameters with a certain decomposition of the surface, which are associated with the Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates in Teichmuller theory. W. Goldman and G. Margulis[GM] introduced that a translation part of an <b>affine</b> <b>deformation</b> canonically corresponds to a tangent vector on the Teichmuller space. By this correspondence, we explicitly represent tangent vectors on the Teichmuller space from the perspective of Lorentzian geometry, only when the tangent vectors correspond to Fenchel-Nielsen twists along separating geodesic curves on a hyperbolic surface.
