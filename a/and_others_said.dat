The Eblaites of Mardikh II were Semites, close to their North-Western Semitic neighbors, such as the Amorites. Giovanni Pettinato said the Eblaite language, {{one of the oldest}} attested Semitic languages, was a West Semitic language; Gelb <b>and</b> <b>others</b> <b>said</b> it was an East Semitic dialect closer to the Akkadian language. Academic consensus considers Eblaite an East-Semitic language which exhibits both West-Semitic and East-Semitic features.|$|E
5|$|The airship had tumultuous {{times at}} the start. Professor A. W. Bernard of Nashville, Tennessee took claim to his {{invention}} in 1897. Myers sent telegrams to editors of newspapers {{in the month of}} May of that year explaining that he was the inventor of the world's first 'sky-cycle' airship in spite of what Bernard <b>and</b> <b>others</b> <b>said.</b> Myers explained to the newspapers that his invention had already been displayed in front of a group of people in New York City in August 1895. Myers showed to them that the basic principles of the controllable airship were already patented by him and his wife on May 26, 1885. He further explained that the only 'sky-cycle' patent ever issued to anybody was granted to him on April 20, 1897. Bernard was trying to stake claim that it was his invention and had really just made a duplicate of Myers' previous recorded patents.|$|E
5|$|Combat {{received}} a polarized response; critics alternately called the battles deep and satisfying or shallow and repetitive. Reviewers considered the combat mechanics to be simplistic while allowing for complex tactics, <b>and</b> <b>others</b> <b>said</b> that {{the requirement to}} actively defend against enemy attacks and enhance offense kept fights engaging. Others also praised the combat but considered the mechanics to be robust and elaborate, presenting a solid role-playing combat system concealed under the intentionally simplistic visuals. Some reviewers said {{that a lack of}} depth made combat gradually become repetitive; they said that even when combat is funny and engaging, {{by the end of the}} game the battles can become routine. Joystiq stated that defense was more interesting than offense because it relied on time-sensitive reactions to creative enemy attacks such as Al Gore giving a presentation. Destructoid said there are too few powers available for offense for the game to remain interesting for long. GameSpot found combat was too easy and lacking in challenge because of an abundance of supplement items such as health packs that were found more frequently than they were used, and powerful abilities that quickly subdued opponents. Others disagreed, stating that the variety offered in combat, such as character abilities, allies, weapons, armor, and upgrades, ensured it always felt fun. The effects of the enhancements were sometimes considered to be confusing, and typically relying on simply equipping the highest level item available. Joystiq said the special characters that can be summoned during battle were extreme in terms of power and entertainment value.|$|E

Halfacre also questioned whether the project was about self-promotion or charity.

Their songs started {{appearing on the}} soundtracks of major Hollywood movies, including Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet and John Carpenter's Escape from L.A. Despite improved sales with their second Capitol album, the group's relationship with the label was increasingly troubled. A planned 1998 project, After the Astronaut, was scrapped and Butthole Surfers acrimoniously split with their manager, Tom Bunch. In 1999, Butthole Surfers won their lawsuit against Touch and Go. Despite the outcome, several of Butthole Surfers' peers in the alternative music community, including Fugazi and Minor Threat lead singer Ian MacKaye, criticized them for having pursued the lawsuit. Haynes <b>and</b> <b>others</b> <b>said</b> they wouldn't have initiated the proceedings if they felt Rusk's dealings had been honorable. Rusk provided the band with indecipherable accounting statements. Rusk continued to insist his actions were honest even though the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit found otherwise. With the case resolved, the band reissued Psychic...

[...] European rabbis, who urged Jews to continue circumcision, planned further talks with Muslim and Christian leaders to determine how they can oppose the ban together. The Jewish Hospital of Berlin suspended the practice of male circumcision.

This constitution closely resembled the objectives spelled out in the constitution of the Canadian Alliance Society in 1834; [...] it called for an elected governor, legislative council (senate), House of Assembly and magistracy, all by secret ballot. It was egalitarian, prohibiting both slavery and the granting of [...] "hereditary emoluments, privileges, or honors." [...] It also called for a separation of church and state, and barred the clergy from seeking election, or serving in any civil or military office. It guaranteed the rights to personal property, to freedom of the press, and freedom of assembly. But tied to these rights to personal property and egalitarian democracy were severe restrictions on chartering corporations; starting from the premise that [...] "Labour is the only means of creating wealth" [...] it placed a constitutional prohibition on chartering either banks or trading companies.|$|E

2500|$|Other reviews {{said that}} there were {{problems}} with Lott's model. In the New England Journal of Medicine, David Hemenway argued that Lott failed to account for several key variables, including drug consumption, and that therefore the model was flawed. Ian Ayres and John J. Donohue, said that the model used by Lott contained significant coding errors and systemic bias. In the American Journal of Public Health, Daniel Webster et al. also raised concerns about other flaws in the study, such as misclassification of laws and endogeneity of predictor variables, which they said rendered the study's conclusions [...] "insupportable". Florida State University criminologist Gary Kleck considered it unlikely that such a large decrease in violent crime could be explained by a relatively modest increase in concealed carry, <b>and</b> <b>others</b> <b>said</b> that removing portions of the data set caused the results to still show statistically significant drops only in aggravated assaults and robbery when all counties with fewer than 100,000 people and Florida's counties were both simultaneously dropped from the sample.

2500|$|First, {{the oldest}} {{hypothesis}} suggests that baka originated as a Chinese literary [...] "allusion to a historical fool", the Qin Dynasty traitor Zhao Gao (d. 207 BCE). This etymology first {{appears in the}} (c.1548) Unbo irohashu 運歩色葉集 dictionary, which glosses baka 馬鹿 as meaning [...] "指鹿曰馬" [...] "point at a deer and say horse". Namely, the Chinese idiom zhi lu wei ma 指鹿為馬 (lit. [...] "point at a deer {{and call it a}} horse", Japanese shika o sashite uma to nasu) meaning [...] "call a deer a horse; deliberate misrepresentation for ulterior purposes"; which refers to the (c. 109-91 BCE) Shiji Chinese historical account of Zhao Gao. Zhao was an infamous eunuch who served the first emperor Qin Shi Huang (r.246-221 BCE) and forced the second Qin Er Shi (r.210-207 BCE) to commit suicide. Zhao Gao was contemplating treason but was afraid the other officials would not heed his commands, so he decided to test them first. He brought a deer and presented it to the Second Emperor but called it a horse. The Second Emperor laughed and said, [...] "Is the chancellor perhaps mistaken, calling a deer a horse?" [...] Then the emperor questioned those around him. Some remained silent, while some, hoping to ingratiate themselves with Zhao Gao, said it was a horse, <b>and</b> <b>others</b> <b>said</b> it was a deer. Zhao Gao secretly arranged for all those who said it was a deer to be brought before the law. Thereafter the officials were all terrified of Zhao Gao.|$|E
2500|$|The Rabbis {{taught in}} a Baraita that once Rabbi Joshua ben Hananiah was {{standing}} on a step on the Temple Mount, and Ben Zoma (who was younger than Rabbi Joshua) saw him but did not stand up before him in respect. So Rabbi Joshua asked Ben Zoma what was up. Ben Zoma replied that {{he was staring at}} the space between the upper and the lower waters (described in [...] ). Ben Zoma said that there is only a bare three fingers' space between the upper and the lower waters. Ben Zoma reasoned that [...] says, [...] "And the spirit of God hovered over the face of the waters," [...] implying a distance similar to that of a mother dove that hovers over her young without touching them. But Rabbi Joshua told his disciples that Ben Zoma was still outside the realm of understanding. Rabbi Joshua noted that [...] says that [...] "the spirit of God hovered over the face of the water" [...] {{on the first day of}} Creation, but God divided the waters on the second day, as [...] reports. (And thus the distance that God hovered above the waters need not be the distance between the upper and lower waters). The Gemara presented various views of how great the distance is between the upper and the lower waters. Rav Aha bar Jacob said that the distance was a hair's breadth. The Rabbis said that the distance was like that between the planks of a bridge. Mar Zutra (or some say Rav Assi) said that the distance was like that between two cloaks spread one over another. <b>And</b> <b>others</b> <b>said</b> that the distance was like that between two cups nested one inside the other..|$|E
