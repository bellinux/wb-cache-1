500|$|In July 1973, White House aide Alexander Butterfield testified {{under oath}} to Congress that Nixon {{had a secret}} taping system that {{recorded}} his conversations and phone calls in the Oval Office. These tapes were subpoenaed by Watergate Special Counsel Archibald Cox; Nixon provided transcripts of the conversations but not the actual tapes, citing executive privilege. With the White House and Cox at loggerheads, Nixon had Cox fired in October in the [...] "Saturday Night Massacre"; he was replaced by Leon Jaworski. In November, Nixon's lawyers revealed that an <b>audio</b> <b>tape</b> <b>of</b> conversations held in the White House on June 20, 1972 featured an 18½ minute gap. Rose Mary Woods, the President's personal secretary, {{claimed responsibility for the}} gap, alleging that she had accidentally wiped the section while transcribing the tape, though her tale was widely mocked. The gap, while not conclusive proof of wrongdoing by the President, cast doubt on Nixon's statement that he had been unaware of the cover-up.|$|E
500|$|On October 1, 2012, Universal {{released}} a 6-CD box {{set of the}} album, intended as its definitive edition. It features the previously available mono and stereo mixes as discs one and two. Disc one contains as bonus tracks additional alternate versions of [...] "All Tomorrow's Parties", [...] "European Son", [...] "Heroin", [...] "All Tomorrow's Parties" [...] (alternate instrumental version), and [...] "I'll Be Your Mirror". Disc two contains the same bonus tracks as the prior deluxe version's second disc. Disc three is Nico's Chelsea Girl in its entirety and the Scepter Studios acetate (see below) in its entirety occupies disc 4. Discs 5 and 6 contain a previously unreleased live performance from 1966. According to the essay by music critic and historian Richie Unterberger contained within the set, the source for the show is the only <b>audio</b> <b>tape</b> <b>of</b> acceptable quality recording during singer Nico's tenure in the band. The essay also clarifies {{that the absence of}} any DVD materials in the box set {{is due to the fact}} that none of the band's shows were filmed, in spite of their heavy reliance on multimedia visuals.|$|E

2500|$|In 2007 Alan Canfora, one of {{the wounded}} students, located a static-filled copy of an <b>audio</b> <b>tape</b> <b>of</b> the shootings in a Yale library archive. The {{original}} 30-minute reel-to-reel audio tape recording was made by Terry Strubbe, a Kent State communications student who turned on his recorder and put its microphone in his dormitory window overlooking the campus. At that time, Canfora asserted that an amplified version of the tape reveals the order to shoot, [...] "Right here! Get Set! Point! Fire!". Lawrence Shafer, a guardsman who admitted he fired during the shootings {{and was one of}} those indicted in the 1974 federal criminal action with charges subsequently dismissed, told the Kent-Ravenna Record-Courier newspaper in May 2007: [...] "I never heard any command to fire. That's all I can say on that." [...] Referring to the assertion that the tape reveals the order, [...] Shafer went on to say, [...] "That's not to say there may not have been, but with all the racket and noise, I don't know how anyone could have heard anything that day." [...] Shafer also said that [...] "point" [...] would not have been part of a proper command to open fire.|$|E
2500|$|The White House and Cox {{remained}} at loggerheads until October, when Nixon had Cox fired {{in what was}} called the [...] "Saturday Night Massacre." [...] The firing infuriated Congress and engendered public protest. On October 30, the House Judiciary Committee began consideration of possible impeachment procedures; the following day Leon Jaworski was named as Cox's replacement, and soon thereafter the president agreed to turn over the requested tapes. When the tapes were turned over a few weeks later, Nixon's lawyers revealed that an <b>audio</b> <b>tape</b> <b>of</b> conversations, held in the White House on June 20, 1972, featured an 18½ minute gap. Rose Mary Woods, the President's personal secretary, claimed responsibility for the gap, alleging that she had accidentally wiped the section while transcribing the tape, though her explanation was widely mocked. The gap, while not conclusive proof of wrongdoing by the President, cast doubt on Nixon's statement that he had been unaware of the cover-up. That same month, during an hour-long televised question-and-answer session with the press, Nixon insisted that he had made mistakes, but had no prior knowledge of the burglary, did not break any laws, and did not learn of the cover-up until early 1973. He boldly declared, ...|$|E

2500|$|Simpson made an incriminating {{statement}} to police about cutting his finger {{the night of}} the murders. First {{he said that he had}} accidentally cut his finger with a shard of broken glass in his Chicago hotel room, then changed his story minutes later. He said he cut his finger in Los Angeles, then said that the cut re-opened while he was in Chicago. Later he claimed not to remember at all how he received the cut on his left middle finger. Bugliosi took Clark and Darden to task for not allowing the jury to hear the police <b>audio</b> <b>tape</b> <b>of</b> this statement. Bugliosi also said the prosecutors should have gone into more detail about Simpson's abuse of his wife. He said it should have been made clear to the mostly African-American jury that Simpson had little influence in the black community. Unlike some other prominent athletes, he had done nothing to help blacks less fortunate than he. Bugliosi pointed out that, although the prosecutors understood that Simpson's race had nothing to do with the murders, once the defense [...] "opened the door" [...] by trying to paint Simpson falsely as a leader in the black community who might have been framed by an overzealous prosecution looking for a suspect, the prosecution should have presented the evidence to the contrary. This might have influenced the jury's verdict. Bugliosi also criticized the prosecution's closing statements as inadequate.|$|E
2500|$|In July 2015, the Los Angeles Times {{released}} a [...] "note to readers" [...] stating that Rall {{had been dropped}} from the paper because of allegations that he had lied about a police encounter in 2001. The Los Angeles Police Department claimed that Rall misrepresented the encounter in a May 2015 opinion blog post he wrote about enforcement of jaywalking laws in Los Angeles. [...] The LAPD provided an <b>audio</b> <b>tape</b> <b>of</b> the encounter that the Times found to [...] "raise {{serious questions about the}} accuracy of Rall's blog post". [...] Rall stood by his version of the incident. [...] Another version of the recording, which Rall posted online after having it restored by sound engineers, included sounds of bystanders talking. One person is heard saying [...] "you need to take off the [...] " [...] which may have referred to handcuffs. [...] The Association of American Editorial Cartoonists issued a statement calling for an independent investigation of the tape. [...] On August 19, the Times issued a lengthy statement reaffirming its conclusion that Rall's original blog post [...] "did not meet its standards". [...] In it, they reported they had the tape investigated by two audio and video forensics experts and it still did not support Rall's version of the event. In March 2016, Rall filed suit against the Times for defamation of character and wrongful termination; in June 2017, the judge in the case dismissed claims against four individuals for defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress; claims against the former and current Times corporate ownership remain.|$|E
