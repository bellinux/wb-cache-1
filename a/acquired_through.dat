5|$|The Shogunate {{also was}} {{preparing}} for further conflict by modernizing its forces. In line with Parkes' designs, the British, previously the Shogunate's primary partner, proved reluctant to provide assistance.

5|$|An {{important}} {{concern for}} Barnes, when {{returning from the}} United Kingdom to Australia, was to avoid paying customs duties on the enormous amount of goods he <b>acquired</b> <b>through</b> various deals during the tour. This included good quality English cloth, in very short supply in Australia at this time. Hearing a rumour that Customs officials were waiting in Sydney for him, Barnes disembarked at Melbourne and travelled to Sydney by train. The move worked and he sold his stock at a substantial profit, conservatively estimated to be equal to his tour fee.|$|E
5|$|Evidence for grapheme-color synesthesia comes {{also from}} the finding that colors can be {{flexibly}} associated to graphemes, as new meanings become assigned to those graphemes. In one study synesthetes were presented with Glagolitic letters that they have never seen before, and the meaning was <b>acquired</b> <b>through</b> a short writing exercise. The Glagolitic graphemes inherited {{the colors of the}} corresponding Latin graphemes as soon as the Glagolitic graphemes acquired the new meaning.|$|E

Scientific, mathematical or natural discoveries, changes in minor concepts of design or style and artistic innovations do not appear on the list.|$|E
5|$|Freshmen were {{expected}} to build the early Bonfires to help prove their worth. For almost two decades, the students constructed Bonfire from debris and wood <b>acquired</b> <b>through</b> various, sometimes illicit, means, including appropriating lumber intended for a dormitory in 1912. In 1935, a farmer reported that students carried off his entire barn as fuel for Bonfire. To prevent future incidents, the university made Bonfire a school-sanctioned event. The following year, for the first time, the school provided axes, saws, and trucks for the students and pointed them toward a grove of dead trees {{on the edge of}} town.|$|E

Four aircraft were delivered beginning in 2012. Volga-Dnepr Group is the parent of three major Russian air-freight carriers – Volga-Dnepr Airlines, AirBridgeCargo Airlines and Atran Airlines. The new 747-8 freighters will replace AirBridgeCargo's current 747-400 aircraft and expand the airline's fleet and will be <b>acquired</b> <b>through</b> a mix of direct purchases and leasing {{over the next six}} years, Boeing said.|$|E
5|$|While Rastignac desires {{wealth and}} social status, Goriot longs {{only for the}} love of his daughters: a longing that borders on idolatry. Because he {{represents}} bourgeois wealth <b>acquired</b> <b>through</b> trade– and not aristocratic primitive accumulation– his daughters are happy to take his money, but will see him only in private. Even as he is dying in extreme poverty, {{at the end of the}} book, he sells his few remaining possessions to provide for his daughters so that they might look splendid at a ball.|$|E
5|$|Wollstonecraft wields the English philosopher John Locke's {{definition}} of property (that is, ownership <b>acquired</b> <b>through</b> labour) against Burke's notion of inherited wealth. She contends that inheritance {{is one of}} the major impediments to the progress of European civilization, and repeatedly argues that Britain's problems are rooted in the inequity of property distribution. Although she did not advocate a totally equal distribution of wealth, she did desire one that was more equitable.|$|E
40|$|Knowledge {{is one of}} {{the truth}} sources on humankind. It is {{believed}} that knowledge is a main factor that shapes human’s culture, history, and civilization. Knowledge construction is a compound that has particular differences. The mechanism of acquiring knowledge according to the philosophy of Islamic education consists of several types: first, mechanism of <b>acquiring</b> knowledge <b>through</b> experience; second, mechanism of <b>acquiring</b> knowledge <b>through</b> rationale and; third, mechanism of <b>acquiring</b> knowledge <b>through</b> revelation. These mechanisms create some important implications in Islamic education philosophy, particularly on learning theories...|$|R

5|$|In 1999, the Muslim Wakf {{authority}} {{controlling the}} Islamic structures atop the Temple Mount began illegally excavating {{large amounts of}} fill from the former site of the Royal Stoa in order to construct a new access to the newly established (or, as the Waqf would put it, restored and expanded) Marwani Mosque. Material dug from the site was dumped in the Kidron Valley, {{so that all the}} important information which could have been <b>acquired</b> <b>through</b> proper excavation of the material in its archaeological context has been lost forever. Trying to save what could still be saved, an operation to sift through the debris was started by Zachi Zweig and Gabriel Barkay. The ongoing Temple Mount Sifting Project has resulted in the recovery of many architectural fragments from the Second Temple buildings as well as remnants from all other historical periods since the First Temple Period.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to independent movements, the party can create formations, with specific formations triggering different status buffs such as regenerating HP or AP. New formations are <b>acquired</b> <b>through</b> {{the course of}} the game, and are specific to characters. Following each battle, characters gain both experience points and ability points; the former raises their experience level and general statistics, while the latter are used as currency to unlock more or upgrade existing abilities. Each character's equipment can be enhanced through the combined effects of assigning types of equipment and items or accessories to a particular character, strengthening their abilities. In {{addition to}} standard battles, characters have access to mechs with their own move sets and abilities, with basic mechanics shared with normal battles.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to recruiting in battle, new demons are <b>acquired</b> <b>through</b> fusion {{at a location}} called the Cathedral of Shadows. Normally only two demons can be fused at once, but under certain conditions more demons can be fused together. Fusions can produce a variety of results based on various circumstances, such as the current phase of Kagutsuchi {{and the addition of}} items called Deathstones. When in the Cathedral of Shadows, the Protagonist can select two demons, viewing a preview of the resultant demon, then initiate a fusion. The resultant demon will both possess its own skills and inherit skills from its two parents: skill inheritance is randomized. Higher-level demons produce more powerful fusions. Demons gained through negotiation or fusion are automatically stored in the Demon Compendium, a record kept within the Cathedral of Shadows. The Protagonist can also pay to summon a demon from the Compendium, returning it to his ranks.|$|E

5|$|In {{dividing}} his lands, William {{appears to}} have followed the Norman tradition, distinguishing between Normandy, which he had inherited, and England, which he had <b>acquired</b> <b>through</b> war. William's second son, Richard, {{had died in a}} hunting accident, leaving Henry and his two brothers to inherit William's estate. Robert, the eldest, despite being in armed rebellion against his father {{at the time of his}} death, received Normandy. England was given to William Rufus, who was in favour with the dying king. Henry was given a large sum of money, usually reported as £5,000, with the expectation that he would also be given his mother's modest set of lands in Buckinghamshire and Gloucestershire. William's funeral at Caen was marred by angry complaints from a local man, and Henry may have been responsible for resolving the dispute by buying off the protester with silver.|$|E
5|$|It is also {{possible}} to obtain a prenatal diagnosis for an embryo or fetus in the womb, using fetal genetic material <b>acquired</b> <b>through</b> chorionic villus sampling. An amniocentesis can be performed if the pregnancy is further along, within 14–18 weeks. This procedure looks at the amniotic fluid surrounding the baby for indicators of the HD mutation. This, too, can be paired with exclusion testing to avoid disclosure of parental genotype. Prenatal testing can be done when a parent has been diagnosed with HD, when they have had genetic testing showing {{the expansion of the}} HTT gene, or when they have a 50% chance of inheriting the disease. The parents can be counseled on their options, which include termination of pregnancy, and on the difficulties of a child with the identified gene.|$|E
5|$|King Henry and King Stephen {{recognised}} Pain as {{the legitimate}} holder of the lands <b>acquired</b> <b>through</b> his wife Sybil. Her kinsman Gilbert de Lacy {{was the son}} of Roger de Lacy, who had been banished from England in 1095 and his English estates confiscated; he had though retained his properties in Normandy. Roger's English possessions were given to his brother Hugh de Lacy, from whom Sybil had inherited them. On Roger's death Gilbert inherited the lands in Normandy, and pressed his claim to the family's former English estates. Coplestone-Crow speculates that the uncertainty hanging over the inheritance was one reason why Pain endeavoured to secure more lands around Ludlow.|$|E
