50|$|There {{are three}} primary distinctions of <b>auditory</b> <b>agnosia</b> that {{fall into two}} categories.|$|E
50|$|This type of <b>auditory</b> <b>agnosia</b> {{is caused}} by lesions to the right {{hemisphere}} of the brain.|$|E
50|$|Another {{important}} aspect of cortical deafness that is often overlooked is that patients feel deaf. They are aware of their inability to hear environmental sounds, non-speech and speech sounds. Patients with <b>auditory</b> <b>agnosia</b> can be unaware of their deficit, and insist {{that they are not}} deaf. Verbal deafness and <b>auditory</b> <b>agnosia</b> are disorders of a selective, perceptive and associative nature whereas cortical deafness relies on the anatomic and functional disconnection of the auditory cortex from acoustic impulses.|$|E
5000|$|Treating <b>auditory</b> verbal <b>agnosia</b> with {{intravenous}} immunoglobulin (IVIG) {{is controversial}} {{because of its}} inconsistency as a treatment method. Although IVIG is normally used to treat immune diseases, some individuals with <b>auditory</b> verbal <b>agnosia</b> have responded positively {{to the use of}} IVIG. [...] Additionally, patients are more likely to relapse when treated with IVIG than other pharmacological treatments. IVIG is, thus, a controversial treatment as its efficacy in treating <b>auditory</b> verbal <b>agnosia</b> is dependent upon each individual and varies from case to case.|$|R
50|$|In childhood, <b>auditory</b> verbal <b>agnosia</b> {{can also}} be caused by Landau-Kleffner syndrome, also called {{acquired}} epileptic aphasia. It is often the first symptom of this disease. A review of 45 cases suggested a relationship between prognosis and age of onset with poorer prognosis for those with earlier onset. In extremely rare cases, <b>auditory</b> verbal <b>agnosia</b> {{has been known to}} present as a symptom of neurodegenerative disease, such as Alzheimer's disease. In such cases <b>auditory</b> verbal <b>agnosia</b> is a symptom that is typically followed by more severe neurological symptoms typical of Alzheimer's disease.|$|R
50|$|<b>Auditory</b> verbal <b>agnosia</b> {{is rarely}} {{diagnosed}} in its pure form. <b>Auditory</b> verbal <b>agnosia</b> can both present {{as the result}} of acute damage or as chronic, progressive degeneration over time. Cases have been documented that result from severe acute head trauma resulting in bilateral temporal lobe damage. In contrast, <b>auditory</b> verbal <b>agnosia</b> has also been documented to present progressively over several years. In one such case, the patient exhibited progressive word deafness over a 9-year period but did not exhibit any other cognitive of mental deterioration. MRIs showed cortical atrophy in the left superior temporal lobe region.|$|R
50|$|This type of <b>auditory</b> <b>agnosia</b> {{is caused}} by lesions to the left {{hemisphere}} of the brain, specifically the temporal lobes and Wernicke's area.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Auditory</b> <b>agnosia</b> {{is a form}} of agnosia that {{manifests itself}} {{primarily}} in the inability to recognize or differentiate between sounds. It is not a defect of the ear or [...] "hearing", but a neurological inability of the brain to process sound meaning. It is a disruption of the [...] "what" [...] pathway in the brain. Persons with <b>auditory</b> <b>agnosia</b> can physically hear the sounds and describe them using unrelated terms, but are unable to recognize them. They might describe the sound of some environmental sounds, such as a motor starting, as resembling a lion roaring, but {{would not be able to}} associate the sound with [...] "car" [...] or [...] "engine", nor would they say that it was a lion creating the noise. <b>Auditory</b> <b>agnosia</b> is caused by damage to the secondary and tertiary auditory cortex of the temporal lobe of the brain.|$|E
5000|$|Classical (or pure) <b>auditory</b> <b>agnosia</b> is an {{inability}} to process environmental sounds, such as animal noises, industrial noises, or the like. An airplane roaring overhead would not be understood {{to be related to}} the idea of [...] "airplane"—indeed, the person would not even think to look up.|$|E
50|$|After Wernicke, came Kussmaul in 1877 who {{attempted}} to explain why <b>auditory</b> verbal <b>agnosia,</b> also known as word deafness, occurs. Contrary to Wernicke's explanations, Kussmaul believed <b>auditory</b> verbal <b>agnosia</b> {{was the result of}} major destruction to the first left temporal gyrus. Kussmaul also posited about the origins of alexia (acquired dyslexia) also known as word blindness. He believed that word blindness was the result of lesions to the left angular and supramarginal gyri.|$|R
25|$|An agnosia {{that affects}} hearing, <b>auditory</b> sound <b>agnosia,</b> is broken into subdivisions based on level of {{processing}} impaired, and a semantic-associative form is investigated within the auditory agnosias.|$|R
50|$|<b>Auditory</b> verbal <b>agnosia</b> can be {{referred}} to as a pure aphasia because it has a high degree of specificity. Despite an inability to comprehend speech, patients with <b>auditory</b> verbal <b>agnosia</b> typically retain the ability to hear, speak, read and write. This specificity suggests that there is a separation between speech perception, non-speech auditory processing, and central language processing. In support of this theory, there are cases in which speech and non-speech processing impairments have responded differentially to treatment. For example, some therapies have improved writing comprehension in patients over time, while speech remained critically impaired in those same patients.|$|R
50|$|Since {{cortical}} deafness and <b>auditory</b> <b>agnosia</b> have many similarities, diagnosing the disorder {{proves to be}} difficult. Bilateral lesions near the primary auditory cortex in the temporal lobe are important criteria. Cortical deafness requires demonstration that brainstem auditory responses arenormal, but cortical evoked potentials are impaired. Brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEP), {{also referred to as}} brainstem auditory evoked responses (BAER) show the neuronal activity in the auditory nerve, cochlear nucleus, superior olive, and inferior colliculus of the brainstem. They typically have a response latency of no more than six milliseconds with an amplitude of approximately one microvolt. The latency of the responses gives critical information: if {{cortical deafness}} is applicable, LLR (long-latency responses) are completely abolished and MLR (middle latency responses) are either abolished or significantly impaired. In <b>auditory</b> <b>agnosia,</b> LLRs and MLRs are preserved.|$|E
50|$|Verbal <b>auditory</b> <b>agnosia.</b> This is a {{very rare}} form of {{language}} impairment, in which the child appears unable {{to make sense of}} speech sounds. It typically occurs as a symptom of Landau-Kleffner syndrome, in which case a diagnosis of SLI would not be appropriate, as there is a known neurological origin of the language difficulties.|$|E
5000|$|A seventy-four-year-old {{man named}} [...] "M" [...] {{had a special}} case of <b>auditory</b> <b>agnosia.</b> [...] "M" [...] {{suffered}} from, [...] "unilateral left posterior temporal and parietal damage", (Saygin, Leech, & Dick, 2010, p. 107) including Wernicke's area. These {{areas of the brain}} are associated with language processing. He had a stroke when he was 62 and went through intensive speech therapy for twelve weeks to help him recover. He was able to regain his language capacity, but when tested at age 74, he had great difficulty in recognizing non-verbal environmental sounds. He did not have either verbal comprehension deficits nor peripheral hearing problems (p. 107). His condition was very rare because <b>auditory</b> <b>agnosia</b> for nonverbal sounds is usually associated with {{the right side of the}} brain. [...] "M" [...] was able to identify familiar Christmas songs and some animal sounds. When he heard music, he couldn't distinguish individual instruments or voices, but he knew it was music. fMRI scans show that after the stroke, his brain re-wired itself through neuronal compensation to account for the damage.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Auditory</b> verbal <b>agnosia</b> (AVA), {{also known}} as pure word deafness, is the {{inability}} to comprehend speech. Individuals with this disorder lose the ability to understand language, repeat words, and write from dictation. However, spontaneous speaking, reading, and writing are preserved. Individuals who exhibit pure word deafness are also still able to recognize non-verbal sounds. [...] Sometimes, this agnosia is preceded by cortical deafness; however, {{this is not always}} the case. Researchers have documented that in most patients exhibiting <b>auditory</b> verbal <b>agnosia,</b> the discrimination of consonants is more difficult than that of vowels, but as with most neurological disorders, there is variation among patients.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Auditory</b> verbal <b>agnosia</b> - Comprehension {{of speech}} is lost but hearing, speaking, reading, and writing ability is retained. This {{is caused by}} damage to the {{posterior}} superior temporal lobes, again not allowing the brain to process auditory input correctly.|$|R
2500|$|Speech <b>agnosia,</b> or <b>auditory</b> verbal <b>agnosia,</b> {{refers to}} [...] "an {{inability}} to comprehend spoken words despite intact hearing, speech production and reading ability". Patients {{report that they}} do indeed hear sounds being produced, but that the sounds are fundamentally unrecognizable/untranslatable.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to {{verbal and nonverbal}} <b>auditory</b> <b>agnosia,</b> there are cases of auditory apperceptive agnosia where patients are unable to recognize music {{in the absence of}} sensory, intellectual, and verbal impairments. In these cases there may be a melodic or a memory basis established in the brain and damage to those areas lead to music agnosia. Agnosia occurs because of failure to re-encode melodic information properly. This associated with right-sided lesions interrupting the melodic route in the brain.|$|E
5000|$|Phonagnosia (from Ancient Greek φωνή phone, [...] "voice" [...] and γνῶσις gnosis, [...] "knowledge") {{is a type}} of agnosia, or loss of knowledge, that {{involves}} a disturbance in the recognition of familiar voices and the impairment of voice discrimination abilities in which the affected individual does not suffer from comprehension deficits. Phonagnosia is an <b>auditory</b> <b>agnosia,</b> an acquired auditory processing disorder resulting from brain damage, other auditory agnosias include cortical deafness and auditory verbal agnosia also known as pure word deafness.|$|E
50|$|Agnosia is the {{inability}} to recognize certain objects, persons or sounds. Agnosia is typically caused by damage to the brain (most commonly in the occipital or parietal lobes) or from a neurological disorder. Treatments {{vary depending on the}} location and cause of the damage. Recovery is possible depending on the severity of the disorder and the severity of the damage to the brain. Many more specific types of agnosia diagnoses exist, including: associative visual agnosia, astereognosis, <b>auditory</b> <b>agnosia,</b> auditory verbal agnosia, prosopagnosia, simultanagnosia, topographical disorientation, visual agnosia etc.|$|E
50|$|<b>Auditory</b> verbal <b>agnosia</b> is the {{inability}} to distinguish phonemes. In some patients with unilateral <b>auditory</b> verbal <b>agnosia,</b> {{there is evidence that}} the ability to acoustically process speech signals is affected at the prephonemic level, preventing the conversion of these signals into phonemes. There are two predominate hypotheses that address what happens within the language center of the brain in people that have AVA. One of the hypotheses is that an early stage of auditory analysis is impaired. The fact that AVA patients have the ability to read shows that both the semantic system and the speech output lexicon are intact. The second hypotheses suggests that there is either a complete or partial disconnection of the auditory input lexicon from the semantic system. This would suggest that entries in the lexicon can still be activated but they cannot go on to cause subsequent semantic activation. In relation to these two different hypotheses, researchers in one study differentiated between two different types of AVA. According to this study, one form of AVA is a deficit at the prephonemic level and is related to {{the inability}} to comprehend rapid changes in sound. This form of AVA is associated with bilateral temporal lobe lesions. The second type of AVA that the study discusses is a deficit in linguistic discrimination that does not adhere to a prephonemic patter. This form is associated with left unilateral temporal lobe lesions and may even be considered a form of Wernicke's aphasia. Often individuals diagnosed with <b>auditory</b> verbal <b>agnosia</b> are also incapable of discriminating between non-verbal sounds as well as speech. The underlying problem seems to be temporal in that understanding speech requires the discrimination between specific sounds which are closely spaced in time. Note that this is not unique to speech; studies using non-speech sounds closely spaced in time (dog bark, phone ring, lightning, etc.) have shown that those with <b>auditory</b> verbal <b>agnosia</b> are unable to discriminate between those sounds in the majority of cases, though a few putative examples of speech-specific impairment have been documented in the literature.|$|R
50|$|It {{is thought}} that {{cortical}} deafness could {{be a part of}} a spectrum of an overall cortical hearing disorder. In some cases, patients with cortical deafness have had recovery of some hearing function, resulting in partial auditory deficits such as <b>auditory</b> verbal <b>agnosia.</b> This syndrome might be difficult to distinguish from a bilateral temporal lesion such as described above.|$|R
50|$|<b>Auditory</b> verbal <b>agnosia</b> {{is caused}} by {{bilateral}} damage to the posterior superior temporal lobes or disruption of connections between these areas. It {{is often associated with}} lesions to the left posterior superior temporal lobe, but no such unilateral case has yet been documented without damage to the white matter tract connecting superior temporal lobes bilaterally or bilateral damage to the superior temporal lobe. In cases where unilateral damage to the left superior temporal lobe has been documented, patients exhibited problems processing both speech and non-speech sounds (in other words, not typical of <b>auditory</b> verbal <b>agnosia).</b> These facts, in combination with the existence of cases of damage to these white matter tracts without detectable cortical damage, in combination with cases of pure word deafness resulting enlargement of the III ventricle alone suggest that the disorder results from damage to the left-right superior temporal circuit rather than the superior temporal area on one hemisphere or the other.|$|R
5000|$|Auditory apperceptive agnosia are {{impairments}} in audition take place despite intact audiogram. In {{some cases the}} deficit is {{in the ability to}} recognize spoken words and in other cases unable to recognize environmental sounds. In all cases individuals are able to read, write, name objects, and converse intelligently. Similar to visual impairments, the deficit arise because of damage in the primary sensory cortex. In the case of <b>auditory</b> <b>agnosia,</b> lesions are present in the superior temporal gyrus bilaterally or in the posterior temporal lobe of the language-dominant (typically left) hemisphere.|$|E
50|$|Cortical {{deafness}} {{is a rare}} form of {{sensorineural hearing}} loss caused by damage to the primary auditory cortex. Cortical deafness is an auditory disorder where the patient is unable to hear sounds but has no apparent damage to the anatomy of the ear (see auditory system), which {{can be thought of}} as the combination of auditory verbal agnosia and <b>auditory</b> <b>agnosia.</b> Patients with cortical deafness cannot hear any sounds, that is, they are not aware of sounds including non-speech, voices, and speech sounds. Although patients appear and feel completely deaf, they can still exhibit some reflex responses such as turning their head towards a loud sound.|$|E
50|$|Music agnosia, an <b>auditory</b> <b>agnosia,</b> is a {{syndrome}} {{of selective}} impairment in music recognition. Three cases of music agnosia are examined by Dalla Bella and Peretz (1999); C.N., G.L., and I.R.. All {{three of these}} patients suffered bilateral damage to the auditory cortex which resulted in musical difficulties while speech understanding remained intact. Their impairment is specific to the recognition of once familiar melodies. They are spared in recognizing environmental sounds and in recognizing lyrics. Peretz (1996) has studied C.N.'s music agnosia further and reports an initial impairment of pitch processing and spared temporal processing. C.N. later recovered in pitch processing abilities but remained impaired in tune recognition and familiarity judgments.|$|E
50|$|Eleanor M. Saffran (May 16, 1938 - November 23, 2002) was a {{researcher}} {{in the field}} of Cognitive Neuropsychology. Her interest in Neuropsychology began at the Baltimore City hospitals of Johns Hopkins University, where her research unit focused on neurological patients with language or cognitive impairments. In papers published between 1976 and 1982, Dr. Saffran spelled out the methodological tenets of “cognitive neuropsychology” exemplified in her studies of aphasia, alexia (acquired dyslexia), <b>auditory</b> verbal <b>agnosia,</b> and short-term memory impairment.|$|R
50|$|Patient J.P., who {{suffered}} a stroke in the left medial/temporal gyrus, resulting in <b>auditory</b> verbal <b>agnosia</b> - the inability to comprehend spoken words, but maintaining {{the ability to read}} and write, and with no effects to hearing ability. J.P. showed normal perceptual priming, but his conceptual priming ability for spoken words was, expectedly, impaired. Another patient, N.G., {{who suffered}} from prosopanomia (the inability to retrieve proper names) following damage to his left temporal lobe, was unable to spontaneously provide names of persons or cities, but was able to successfully complete a word-fragment completion exercise following priming with these names. This demonstrated intact perceptual priming abilities.|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "agnosia" [...] {{refers to}} a loss of knowledge. Acquired music agnosia is the [...] "inability to {{recognize}} music in the absence of sensory, intellectual, verbal, and mnesic impairments". Music agnosia is most commonly acquired; in most cases it is a result of bilateral infarction of the right temporal lobes. In his article, Satoh states [...] "when pure word deafness, <b>auditory</b> sound <b>agnosia,</b> and receptive amusia occur simultaneously, the state is called auditory agnosia" [...] (Satoh 2007). However, one must understand the subtle difference between auditory and music agnosia; the former refers to the inability to recognize environmental sounds while the latter refers to the inability to recognize music.|$|R
50|$|Early reports, {{published}} in the late 19th century, describe patients with acute onset of deafness after experiencing symptoms described as apoplexy. The only means of definitive diagnosis in these reports were postmortem dissections. Subsequent cases throughout the 20th century reflect advancements in diagnoses of both hearing loss and stroke. With the advent of audiometric and electrophysiologic studies, investigators could diagnose cortical deafness with increasing precision. Advances in imaging techniques, such as MRI, greatly improved the diagnosis and localization of cerebral infarcts that coincide with primary or secondary auditory centers. Neurological and cognitive testing help to distinguish between total cortical deafness and <b>auditory</b> <b>agnosia,</b> resulting in the inability to perceive words, music, or specific environmental sounds.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "pure word deafness" [...] is {{something}} of a misnomer. By definition, individuals with pure word deafness are not deaf - in the absence of other impairments, these individuals have normal hearing for all sounds, including speech. The term [...] "deafness" [...] originates from the fact that individuals with AVA are unable to comprehend speech that they hear. The term [...] "pure word" [...] refers to the fact that comprehension of verbal information is selectively impaired in AVA. For this reason, AVA is distinct from other auditory agnosias in which the recognition of nonspeech sounds is impaired. Classical (or pure) <b>auditory</b> <b>agnosia</b> is an inability to process environmental sounds. Interpretive or receptive agnosia (amusia) is an inability to understand music.|$|E
5000|$|Various {{disorders}} of the STS {{have been}} documented in which patients fail to recognize a certain stimulus, but still exhibit subcortical processing of the stimulus, {{this is known as}} an agnosia. Pure <b>auditory</b> <b>agnosia</b> (agnosia without aphasia) is found in a patients who can't identify non-speech sounds such as coughing, whistling, and crying but have no deficit in speech comprehension. Speech agnosia is known as an incapability to comprehend spoken words despite intact hearing, speech production, and reading ability. Patients show a recognition of the familiarity of a word, but are not able to recall its meaning. Phonagnosia is characterized as an inability to recognize familiar voices, while having other auditory abilities. Patients exhibited a double dissociation with either an inability to match names or faces with a certain famous voice, or to discriminate familiar voices from unfamiliar ones. Visual agnosia can be broken into separate disorders in regard to what is being recognized. [...] An inability to recognize written words is known as alexia or word blindness, while an inability to recognize familiar faces is known as prosopagnosia. Prosopagnosia has been shown to have a similar double dissociation as phonagnosia in that some patients show an impairment of memory for familiar faces while others show impairment when discriminating familiar faces from unfamiliar ones.|$|E
5000|$|This {{specific}} {{group of}} symptoms distinguishes {{those who have}} expressive aphasia from individuals {{with other types of}} aphasia. There are several distinct [...] "types" [...] of aphasia, and each type is characterized by a different set of language deficits. Although those who have expressive aphasia tend to retain good spoken language comprehension, other types of aphasia can render patients completely unable to understand any language at all, unable to understand any spoken language (<b>auditory</b> verbal <b>agnosia),</b> whereas still other types preserve language comprehension, but with deficits. People with expressive aphasia may struggle less with reading and writing (see alexia) than those with other types of aphasia. Although individuals with expressive aphasia tend to have a good ability to self-monitor their language output (they [...] "hear what they say" [...] and make corrections), other types of aphasics can seem entirely unaware of their language deficits.|$|R
5000|$|Typically, {{children}} with LKS develop normally, but then lose their language skills. While many affected individuals have clinical seizures, some only have electrographic seizures, including electrographic status epilepticus of sleep (ESES). The first {{indication of the}} language problem is usually <b>auditory</b> verbal <b>agnosia.</b> This is demonstrated in patients in multiple ways including the inability to recognize familiar noises and the impairment {{of the ability to}} lateralize or localize sound. In addition, receptive language is often critically impaired, however in some patients, impairment in expressive language is the most profound. In a study of 77 cases of Landau-Kleffner syndrome, 6 were found to have this type of aphasia. Because this syndrome appears during such a critical period of language acquisition in a child's life, speech production may be affected just as severely as language comprehension. [...] The onset of LKS is typically between 18 months and 13 years, the most predominant time of emergence being between 3 and 7 years.|$|R
40|$|There is an {{unprecedented}} increase of rare low-incident severe disabilities in today 2 ̆ 7 s classroom. Some of them pose classroom management challenges due to concomitantly appearing behavior challenges. Landau Kleffner Syndrome {{is one such}} disability. It was cited {{for the first time}} in 1957 (Zhang, 2 ̆ 6 Gregory, 2010) and is characterized by a typical language and cognitive growth that retrogresses after three to nine years of age (O 2 ̆ 7 Hare, 2008). Behavioral regression is exhibited by students being physically and verbally aggressive (Ekinci, Isik, 2 ̆ 6 Melek, 2012). Children also depict abnormal electroencephalographic (EEG) traits, especially when sleeping (Slyke, 2002). Other concomitant characteristics include attention deficits and severe <b>auditory</b> verbal <b>agnosia</b> (Slyke, 2002). This research was conducted to collect, analyze, and consolidate experiences of adults who served a particular child with Landau Kleffner Syndrome from elementary school to high school. By the end of the research, the subject was nineteen years old and in high school. Challenges, strategies, and concerns of the participants were successfully consolidated and documented for future consultation...|$|R
