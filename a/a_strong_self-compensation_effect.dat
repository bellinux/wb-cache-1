30|$|However, {{this kind}} of growth proposes a new method to control the N: ZnO structure. Furthermore, {{there is a big}} {{difference}} for the carrier concentration and mobility at different oxidation stages. These provide possibility to prepare p-type ZnO and to improve the concentration and mobility of the carrier. In our study, there are several reasons that lead to the n-type formation and the low carrier concentration and mobility. (1) The substrate temperature maintains at room temperature the deposition of the as-deposited Zn-N film in this study. There are a lot of donor impurities (oxygen vacancy, interstitial zinc, etc.) [42], which lead to <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> <b>self-compensation</b> <b>effect</b> after oxidation. (2) N content is too low. The lower N concentration results in the lower N substitution in the O lattice (No). This leads to the formation of n-type N: ZnO and the decrease of carrier concentration. In addition, this leads to the electrical properties of the films which are similar with those of the pure ZnO thin film (n-type) and also the lower carrier concentration [43]. Furthermore, the insulating quartz substrate is nonconductive to generate p-type semiconductors [44].|$|E
30|$|Semiconductor {{nanoparticles}} termed {{quantum dots}} (QDs) have drawn wide attention {{in recent years}} as light-emitting source for light-emitting diode (LED) applications, whose emission spectrum with narrow linewidth can be tuned by changing the energy bandgaps with the variation in QD sizes and shapes [1 – 7]. Numerous experiments present in literature on the high-performance electroluminescence (EL) properties of LEDs based on CdS [8, 9], CdSe [10, 11], and PbS [12, 13] colloidal QD thin film. However, the widespread employment of heavy metal ions, particularly Cd and Pb, are a serious hazard to human health {{as well as to the}} environment [14]. Therefore, it necessitates alternative approaches for developing QD-LEDs with the heavy-metal free composition. Nontoxic ZnO QDs with a tunable direct wide bandgap and a large exciton binding energy of 60  meV at room temperature are very promising for solid-state LED applications [15, 16]. However, the main issue, the lack of high-quality and stable p-type doing of ZnO due to the <b>strong</b> <b>self-compensation</b> <b>effect</b> of native point defects such as zinc interstitial or oxygen vacancy, still remained. Thus, n-ZnO/p-GaN heterojunction LEDs are offered as an alternative approach due to the low lattice mismatch (1.9 %), similar bandgap energy between ZnO and GaN, and the same wurtzite crystal structure. Nevertheless, the spontaneous polarization of GaN [17 – 19] and the interfacial energy barrier between ZnO QDs and GaN will necessarily reduce the performance of the device, thus resulting the low EL efficiency of the device. To improve the EL efficiency of the LEDs, localized surface plasmon (LSP) has been introduced into n-ZnO/p-GaN LEDs to improve EL performance of the device. Recently, different metals like Au, Ag, and Pt have been observed to enhance the EL performance due to the enhancement of the internal quantum efficiency [20 – 26]. More recently, Lu et al. demonstrated a more than 30 -fold EL enhancement of Al nanoparticle-decorated n-ZnO nanorod/p-GaN LEDs compared with that of the bare one [27]. Liu et al. showed the devices of LSP-enhanced ZnO/SiO 2 core/shell nanorod array/p-GaN heterostructure LEDs containing decorated with Ag nanoparticles. In comparison with the bare UV LEDs, the maximum enhancement ration of the Ag nanoparticle-decorated LEDs in EL is sevenfold [28]. However, many reports are mainly focused on the LSP-enhanced LEDs based on ZnO nanorods; there has been no literature concerning the LSP-enhanced EL emission in ZnO QD-based LED structure.|$|R

40|$|Materials {{with zero}} thermal {{expansion}} (ZTE) or precisely tailored thermal expansion are in urgent demand of modern industries. However, {{the overwhelming majority}} of materials show positive thermal expansion. To develop ZTE or negative thermal expansion (NTE) materials as compensators has become an important challenge. Here, we present the evidence for the realization of ultra-low thermal expansion in Mn–Co–Ge–In particles. The bulk with the Ni 2 In-type hexagonal structure undergoes giant NTE owing to a martensitic magnetostructural transition. The major finding is that the thermal expansion behavior can be totally controlled by modulating the crystallinity degree and phase transition from atomic scale. <b>Self-compensation</b> <b>effect</b> leads to ultra-low thermal expansion with a linear expansion coefficient as small as + 0. 68 × 10 − 6 /K over a wide temperature range around room temperature.

30|$|From the {{development}} of Ga 2 O 3, this material still has some disadvantages as follows. (1) P-type doping is a big challenge of Ga 2 O 3 material. Because the acceptor levels are far from the valence band of β-Ga 2 O 3, the activation energy of acceptor impurities is very high. Meanwhile, the n-type background impurities in Ga 2 O 3 crystal will also produce <b>self-compensation</b> <b>effect</b> on acceptor impurities, resulting to the self-insulating of the material. Therefore, there still has been no effective p-type doing. (2) The thermal conductivity of Ga 2 O 3 is too low. Experimental and theoretical investigations have proved that the thermal conductivity of β-Ga 2 O 3 is just only 0.1 – 0.3  W cm− 1  K− 1 [51 – 53]. This is adverse to the power device used in high-voltage and high-current circumstance. Excessive heat accumulation will seriously affect the performance and reliability of the device. (3) Carrier mobility is low. The theoretical mobility of Ga 2 O 3 is limited to about 200  cm 2 /V s due {{to the influence of}} scattering [54]. Low mobility has a negative impact on the frequency and current characteristics.|$|R
40|$|Extraordinary oxidant-dependent {{changes in}} the {{thermoelectric}} properties of undoped ZnO thin films deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD) have been observed. Specifically, deionized water and ozone oxidants {{are used in the}} growth of ZnO by ALD using diethylzinc as a zinc precursor. No substitutional atoms {{have been added to the}} ZnO films. By using ozone as an oxidant instead of water, a thermoelectric power factor (σS) of 5. 76 × 10 W m K is obtained at 705 K for undoped ZnO films. In contrast, the maximum power factor for the water-based ZnO film is only 2. 89 × 10 W m K at 746 K. Materials analysis results indicate that the oxygen vacancy levels in the water- and ozone-grown ZnO films are essentially the same, but the difference comes from Zn-related defects present in the ZnO films. The data suggest that the strong oxidant effect on thermoelectric performance can be explained by a mechanism involving point defect-induced differences in carrier concentration between these two oxides and a <b>self-compensation</b> <b>effect</b> in water-based ZnO due to the competitive formations of both oxygen and zinc vacancies. This strong oxidant effect on the thermoelectric properties of undoped ZnO films provides a pathway to improve the thermoelectric performance of this important material...|$|R
40|$|The {{utilization}} of osmosis for engineered applications sparked off various emerging technologies relying on osmotically driven membrane processes (ODMPs). Represented by forward osmosis (FO) and pressure retarded osmosis (PRO), ODMPs show great promise to leverage the global water-energy nexus and have drawn considerable attention in recent years. However, their performance in practical applications is significantly affected by membrane fouling. Membrane fouling {{is a complex}} problem and {{is associated with the}} foulant deposition, concentration polarization and reverse solute diffusion (RSD) in ODMPs. The current paper provides a comprehensive review on membrane fouling in ODMPs with a focus on the elaboration of the factors and mechanisms governing the fouling behavior. Among those fouling factors and mechanisms, some are also applicable for pressure-driven membrane processes (e. g., reverse osmosis (RO) and nanofiltration (NF)), such as the effects of hydrodynamic conditions, feedwater composition, and membrane material and properties, and the cake-enhanced concentration polarization (CE-CP) mechanism. Others are unique for ODMPs, such as the effects of draw solution composition and membrane orientation, the internal concentration polarization (ICP) <b>self-compensation</b> <b>effect,</b> and the RSD-enhanced fouling. A general osmotic-resistance filtration model for ODMPs is presented in this paper to assist in the interpretation of the intrinsic interrelationships among those fouling factors and mechanisms. The impact and mechanisms of membrane fouling on contaminates removal are also reviewed briefly based on the limited existing literature on this topic. Finally, the available membrane fouling control strategies for ODMPs are summarized upon understanding the cause and effect of fouling. Based on the current review, future research prospects are proposed for further studying the membrane fouling in ODMPs...|$|R
