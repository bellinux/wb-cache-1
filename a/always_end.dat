5|$|Greys Anatomy {{follows the}} lives of {{surgical}} interns and residents at the fictional Grey-Sloan Memorial Hospital (formerly Seattle Grace Hospital, Season 1–6, Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital, Season 6–9, and then Grey-Sloan Memorial Hospital, Season 9–present), as they gradually evolve into seasoned doctors, {{with the help of}} their competent mentors. Every installment, typically, commences with a voice-over narrative from Meredith Grey or a season regular, foreshadowing the theme of the episode. Each season tends to represent the physicians' academic year, with each completed year qualifying the residents at a level higher in the surgical field. The season will <b>always</b> <b>end</b> with a finale, typically involving a tragic event such as a death or character departure. Most installments revolve around the doctors' everyday lives as surgeons, but the show puts an emphasis on their personal, rather than professional, lives. The series sets aside medical ethic concerns to focus on character development and relationships. Although the physicians treat the illnesses of their patients, often through complex surgeries, their primary motivation is customarily praise and competition.|$|E
25|$|Basic stems {{consist of}} one to four syllables (with four being rare) and <b>always</b> <b>end</b> in a vowel. Monosyllabic stems have long vowels or diphthongs, e.g., bií, 'stone, rock'; bía, 'woman'. The vast {{majority}} of nouns in Crow are derived stems. Derivational processes in nominal morphology include affixation and compounding.|$|E
25|$|British Scouting did not <b>always</b> <b>end</b> with Japanese occupation. In Shanghai, District Commissioner A. H. Gordon {{negotiated}} with the Japanese to allow Scouting for boys of various nationalities to continue in early 1942, though they were involved mainly in efforts at self sufficiency through raising vegetables and keeping livestock in the Hungjao (Hongqiao) Scout camp.|$|E

25|$|Endeavours of {{this sort}} <b>always</b> <b>end</b> in defeat. In order to confer a {{technical}} philosophical value upon the common sense of orators and moralists it is necessary either to accept Reid's common sense {{as a sort of}} unjustified and unjustifiable instinct, which will destroy Thomism, or to reduce it to the Thomist intellect and reason, which will result in its being suppressed as a specifically distinct faculty of knowledge. In short, there can be no middle ground between Reid and St. Thomas.|$|E
25|$|Stewart {{devised the}} rules which governed how the show would operate: the {{programme}} would <b>always</b> <b>end</b> {{with the number}} one record, which was the only record that could appear in consecutive weeks. The show would include the highest new entry and (if not featured in the previous week) the highest climber on the charts, and omit any song going down in the chart. Tracks could be featured in consecutive weeks in different formats. For example, if a song was played over the chart countdown or the closing credits, then it was acceptable for the act {{to appear in the}} studio the following week.|$|E
25|$|The series {{focuses on}} eight-year-old Stephanie, the newest {{resident}} of the LazyTown community. She has moved to LazyTown {{to live with her}} uncle, Mayor Meanswell, and is surprised to learn that all of her neighbors lead inactive lifestyles. With the help of an above-average superhero named Sportacus, she helps teach the other residents how to partake in more athletic pastimes. Her attempts are often nearly thwarted by Robbie Rotten, who prefers to lead a sluggish life and is agitated by the sudden boom of physical activity. On a regular basis, Robbie devises ill-judged schemes to make LazyTown lazy once again. However, his plans are never foolproof and <b>always</b> <b>end</b> with him losing.|$|E

500|$|Even as {{the threat}} from Germany and Italy had diminished by August 1942, there were still many ways for the men of Omaha to be harmed. One day, as she was at anchor in Carenage Bay, Trinidad, one of her sailors had {{returned}} from an especially [...] "hard liberty" [...] and found a spot on Omahas direction finder deck to sleep off the effects. When the ship rolled unexpectedly the inebriated sailor rolled from the deck, down an awning, across the quarterdeck and then over the side and into the water. According to Captain Chandler, [...] "probably due to his perfectly relaxed condition", the sailor was uninjured. Other such occurrences did not <b>always</b> <b>end</b> as well.|$|E
500|$|Fincher {{decided to}} use the digital Thomson Viper Filmstream camera to shoot the film. Fincher had {{previously}} used the Thomson Viper {{over the past three years}} on commercials for Nike, Hewlett Packard, Heineken and Lexus which allowed him to get used to and experiment with the equipment. He was able to use inexpensive desktop software like Final Cut Pro to edit Zodiac. Fincher remarked in an interview, [...] "Dailies almost <b>always</b> <b>end</b> up being disappointing, like the veil is pierced and you look at it for the first time and think, 'Oh my god, this is what I really have to work with.' But when you can see what you have as it's gathered, it can be a much less neurotic process." ...|$|E
500|$|One of the {{challenges}} the writers faced was scaling down their ideas to make them feasible for production. [...] Cuse said that he let such ideas flourish because of his relative inexperience with writing for television series. An example given by the writers was Boam's idea for a full-sized [...] "pirate ship on wheels". The writers quickly realized they needed to scale the idea down to something the production designers could create. They settled on putting a full pirate crew on a stagecoach with cannons. Kern said {{it was better to}} [...] "shoot past the mark, and come back to it, rather than start below it". He elaborated on this, saying, [...] "if you envision the 40-foot galleon and go back from that, you'll <b>always</b> <b>end</b> up with more than if you start out with a pirate on a horse." ...|$|E

500|$|Chris says {{he hates}} classic rock {{stations}} because they <b>always</b> <b>end</b> up playing We Built This City from Starship. The radio station Chris tunes in to is [...] "Classic Rock 103.7 WHTT". WHTT was the callsign {{for the current}} Boston, MA radio station WODS, a classic hits station {{at the time that}} played the same music the fictional WHTT apparently airs before flipping to Top 40 in 2012 as 103.3 Amp Radio. The station had the callsign from 1983–86. This further references Boston influences on the TV show. Another station actually holds the callsigns now, 104.1 WHTT-FM in Buffalo, NY, with the same format. After Stewie is injected with steroids, he lifts a barbell on one side and says [...] "I have the power!" [...] and the show then shifts scenes the same as in Masters of the Universe. It is mentioned that Connie is the key to One-Eyed Willy’s gold, a reference to The Goonies. Paul Sorvino and Chazz Palminteri are seen acting in a fictional movie called [...] "Distracting Trumpet". After Stewie's steroids injection wears off and he jumps out the bedroom window, the music playing is from the cartoon The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{discussed}} the acting. Peter Gicas of E! News noted that Fox and Monaghan portray [...] "combustible behavior the tune is hellbent on describing." [...] The New York Posts Jarett Wieselman wrote that they play their roles perfectly and {{help make the}} video powerful. Entertainment Weeklys Whitney Pastorek found the violent acting sexually appealing, while Willa Paskin of New York magazine wrote that the cast's appeal [...] "hypnotize" [...] viewers. Paskin noted the use of sepia toning in the burning-house scenes. Matthew Wilkening of AOL Radio commented that the video leaves viewers to decide [...] "if it's a good thing or a bad thing that the pair <b>always</b> <b>end</b> up reconciling." [...] Mikey Fresh of Vibe commented that Fox's natural reaction when Monaghan pierces the wall and almost hits her is an [...] "incredible act of vulnerability". L Magazines Benjamin Sutton likened the scene in which the characters burn to the Marvel Comics character Chris Bradley, whom Monaghan portrays in the 2009 action film [...] As of October 2017, the video is the site's 33rd most viewed video, with more than 1.4 billion views.|$|E
500|$|The four verses each {{consist of}} two {{questions}} asked by [...] "Files" [...] and answered by the Sergeant- a call-and-response form – {{and then another}} four lines of the Sergeant explaining, as above. In some interpretations, the second four lines are taken to be spoken by a third voice, another [...] "file-on-parade". Both the poem's rhythm and its rhyme scheme reinforce the idea of drilling infantry by giving the effect of feet marching generally but not perfectly in unison: [...] Although the poem's overall meter is iambic, each line in the verses and, to the slightly lesser extent, the chorus features syllables with additional grammatical and phonetic emphasis that fit {{the rhythm of the}} [...] "left, left, left right left" [...] marching cadence. [...] The first four lines <b>always</b> <b>end</b> with the same word, and the last four feature an aaab rhyme scheme with slightly lighter syllables that force the pace into a brisk march despite its somber mood (cf. the text of the poem's final chorus). Eliot noted the imperfect rhyme scheme – parade and said do not quite rhyme – as strongly contributing to this effect, with the slight interruption supporting the feel {{of a large number of}} men marching together, not quite in harmony.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with the official EastEnders website, Oberman detailed the background dynamic to Chrissie and Den's relationship as it existed before their appearance on the show: [...] "They were a real match for each other and ran a successful wine bar. The couple made a good team, but he was always going off with other women. She'd end up leaving him, but they'd <b>always</b> <b>end</b> up back together." [...] Den's womanising and philandering nature was deliberately set against Chrissie's strong and forceful personality, and culminated on-screen in his affair with Kate Mitchell (Jill Halfpenny). The plot was praised by television editor Ru Green as being one of the [...] "better storylines" [...] during an otherwise weak year for the show, with media attention at the time profiling Chrissie's dramatic plans for revenge. Commenting on the storyline's climax, a report in The Sun spotlighted how [...] "instead of collapsing in tears" [...] as many female characters in EastEnders are wont to do, Chrissie [...] "proves that hell hath no fury like a woman scorned". The climax, which saw Chrissie cut off Kate Mitchell's hair in retribution for the affair, was a highlight for Oberman and an important dramatic milestone for her character: [...] "cutting off Jill Halfpenny's hair in the salon... was a really great episode. I loved working with Jill and I think that put Chrissie on the map." ...|$|E
500|$|The summits {{were only}} formalised {{in the period}} between 1974 and 1988. At the December summit in Paris in 1974, {{following}} a proposal from then-French president Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, {{it was agreed that}} more high level, political input was needed following the [...] "empty chair crisis" [...] and economic problems. The inaugural European Council, as it became known, was held in Dublin on 10 and 11 March 1975 during Ireland's first Presidency of the Council of Ministers. In 1987, it was included in the treaties for the first time (the Single European Act) and had a defined role {{for the first time in}} the Maastricht Treaty. At first only a minimum of two meetings per year were required, which resulted in an average of three meetings per year being held for the 1975-1995 period. Since 1996, the number of meetings were required to be minimum four per year. For the latest 2008-2014 period, this minimum was well exceeded, by an average of seven meetings being held per year. The seat of the Council was formalised in 2002, basing it in Brussels. Three types of European Councils exist: Informal, Scheduled and Extraordinary. While the informal meetings are also scheduled 1½ years in advance, they differ from the scheduled ordinary meetings by not ending with official Council conclusions, as they instead end by more broad political Statements on some cherry picked policy matters. The extraordinary meetings <b>always</b> <b>end</b> with official Council conclusions - but differs from the scheduled meetings by not being scheduled more than a year in advance, as for example in 2001 when the European Council gathered to lead the European Union's response to the 11 September attacks.|$|E
