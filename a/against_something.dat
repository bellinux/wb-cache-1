25|$|A myotonic goat, {{otherwise}} known as the fainting goat, is a domestic goat that freezes for roughly 3 seconds when it feels panic. Though painless, this generally results in the animal collapsing on its side. The characteristic {{is caused by a}} hereditary genetic disorder called myotonia congenita. When startled, younger goats will stiffen and fall over. Older goats learn to spread their legs or lean <b>against</b> <b>something</b> when startled, and often they continue to run about in an awkward, stiff-legged shuffle.|$|E
25|$|The DIN fitting {{is a type}} {{of direct}} {{screw-in}} connection to the cylinder. The DIN system is less common worldwide, but has the advantage of withstanding greater pressure, up to 300 bar, allowing use of high-pressure steel cylinders. They are less susceptible to blowing the O-ring seal if banged <b>against</b> <b>something</b> while in use. DIN fittings are the standard in much of Europe and are available in most countries. The DIN fitting is considered more secure and therefore safer by many technical divers.|$|E

25|$|That Start transit {{requires}} {{the attainment of}} a threshold cell size directly implies that yeast cells measure their own size, {{so that they can}} use that information to regulate Start. A favored model for how yeast cells, as well as cells of other species, measure their size relies on the detection of overall translation rate. Essentially, since cell growth consists, to a great extent, of the synthesis of ribosomes to produce more proteins, the overall rate of protein production should reflect cell size. Thus, a single protein that is produced at a constant rate relative to total protein production capacity will be produced in higher quantities as the cell grows. If this protein promotes cell cycle progression (Start in the case of yeast), then it will link cell cycle progression to translation rate and, therefore, cell size. Importantly, this protein must be unstable, so that its levels depend on its current translation rate, rather than the rate of translation over time. Furthermore, since the cell grows in volume as well as mass, the concentration of this size sensor will remain constant with growth, so its activity must be compared <b>against</b> <b>something</b> that does not change with cell growth. Genomic DNA was suggested as such a standard early on, because it is (by definition) present in a constant quantity until the start of DNA replication. How this occurs remains a major question in current studies of size control (see below).|$|E

500|$|The {{first use}} of the term [...] "antibody" [...] {{occurred}} in a text by Paul Ehrlich. The term Antikörper (the German word for antibody) appears in the conclusion of his article [...] "Experimental Studies on Immunity", published in October 1891, which states that, [...] "if two substances give rise to two different antikörper, then they themselves must be different". However, the term was not accepted immediately and several other terms for antibody were proposed; these included Immunkörper, Amboceptor, Zwischenkörper, substance sensibilisatrice, copula, Desmon, philocytase, fixateur, and Immunisin. The word antibody has formal analogy to the word antitoxin and a similar concept to Immunkörper (immune body in English). As such, the original construction of the word contains a logical flaw; the antitoxin is something directed against a toxin, while the antibody is a body directed <b>against</b> <b>something.</b>|$|E

500|$|Due to {{unforeseen}} scheduling {{problems with}} Shaft, production {{for the series}} was postponed for three years following the completion of its writing. However, once the issues were resolved, production began without any further complications. The animation studio spearheaded the conception and design of the witches in the series, as well as creating each one's individual backstory. Urobuchi had originally envisioned the witches {{to be similar to}} conventional monsters such as Godzilla, but upon seeing the surreal concept art for one of the main witches, Walpurgis Night, he remarked: [...] "How can Homura possibly fight <b>against</b> <b>something</b> like this?" [...] Designers from Shaft also added quotes from the German folklore legend Faust to the series. Throughout production, the animation production team Gekidan Inu Curry had freedom to insert new details or modify existing ones from the original script. An example is during a scene in the final episode where the team added black wings to Homura, something which was not included in Urobuchi's writing. Urobuchi praised this aspect of the production, commenting that [...] "additions by the animation production team added more mystery and depth to [...] characters, and without them, {{it would have been very}} difficult to write any further stories in the world of the series".|$|E
500|$|Jasmine {{demonstrates}} several traits, {{beliefs and}} ideologies associated with feminism, exercising much [...] "feminist potential", although notably less explicit than Belle's. Nonetheless, the character still adheres to traditional romance-oriented aspirations {{commonly associated with}} Disney's princess characters despite [...] "her modern, feminist attitude", although her yearning for romance is much more subdued in comparison. Steve Daly of Entertainment Weekly identified Jasmine as [...] "a sexually aware, proto-feminist princess". [...] "New" [...] Exoticisms: Changing Patterns in the Construction of Otherness author Isabel Santaolalla wrote that Jasmine appears to have inherited [...] "the legacy bequeathed by the 1960s Women's Movement." [...] Having [...] "stepped out of the 90s" [...] according to The Washington Posts Desson Howe, Jasmine is appropriately opposed to the glass ceiling." [...] Defying marriage laws and arranged marriages are also among Jasmine's central themes. Larkin believes that her character is responsible for inspiring a change in her kingdom's marriage laws, explaining, [...] "Jasmine didn't just believe in something, she fought <b>against</b> <b>something</b> that she saw was an injustice... She actively sought change and made it happen." [...] Musker agreed that the princess [...] "rebel against the social structure in choosing to marry someone of her own free will". According to singer Brad Kane, who provides Aladdin's singing voice, [...] "Aladdin is a stealth feminist movie" [...] because Jasmine is [...] "willing to give up being a princess to not get stuck marrying someone." [...] Jasmine's defiance eventually successfully convinces her father to change the constitution.|$|E
2500|$|American Motors Vice-President for Sales, Bill Pickett {{described}} {{that the}} Rebel Machine was [...] "another youth-oriented car." [...] The company described, [...] "the supercar buyer is usually young, relatively affluent {{and has a}} [...] "critical awareness" [...] of exterior styling.
