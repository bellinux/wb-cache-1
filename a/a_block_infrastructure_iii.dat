Public interest cases are repeatedly filed to <b>block</b> <b>infrastructure</b> projects aimed at solving environmental issues in India, such as but not limiting to water works, expressways, land acquisition for projects, and electricity power generation projects.

40|$|What {{constitutes}} a ‘slum’ is much debated {{in the urban}} poverty and affordable housing literature. We argue that a focus on living conditions can help clarify this and present a framework, the living conditions diamond, for detailing living conditions and determining how the settlements we deem ‘slums’ compare {{with each other and}} with nonslum settlements. The diamond distils living conditions into four dimensions: (i) tenure, (ii) <b>infrastructure,</b> (<b>iii)</b> unit quality, and (iv) neighbourhood and location. This framework depicts conditions in graphic terms enabling comparison of conditions within and across cities. The diamond moves us beyond the notion that slums are homogeneously poor in quality, and facilitates analyses that can reveal why they differ.

5000|$|Rather than tagging the <b>A</b> <b>blocks</b> {{using the}} {{contents}} {{of one of the}} internal buffers, an indirect movement-imitation buffer can be used instead. This is an internal buffer defined as s1 t s2, where s1 and s2 are each as large as the number of <b>A</b> and B <b>blocks,</b> and t contains any values immediately following s1 that are equal to the last value of s1 (thus ensuring that no value in s2 appears in s1). A second internal buffer containing [...] unique values is still used. The first [...] values of s1 and s2 are then swapped with each other to encode information into the buffer about which <b>blocks</b> are <b>A</b> <b>blocks</b> and which are B <b>blocks.</b> When <b>an</b> <b>A</b> <b>block</b> at index i is swapped with <b>a</b> B <b>block</b> at index j (where the first evenly sized <b>A</b> <b>block</b> is initially at index 0), s1i and s1j are swapped with s2i and s2j, respectively. This imitates the movements of the <b>A</b> <b>blocks</b> through B. The unique values in the second buffer are used to determine the original order of the <b>A</b> <b>blocks</b> as they are rolled through the B blocks. Once all of the <b>A</b> <b>blocks</b> have been dropped, the movement-imitation buffer is used to decode whether <b>a</b> given <b>block</b> in the array is <b>an</b> <b>A</b> <b>block</b> or <b>a</b> B <b>block,</b> each <b>A</b> <b>block</b> is rotated into B, and the second internal buffer is used as swap space for the local merges.|$|R
