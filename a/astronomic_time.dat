40|$|In {{contrast}} to common opinion, it is shown that equilibrium constants determine the time-dependent behavior of particular ratios of concentrations for any system of reversible first-order reactions. Indeed, some special ratios actually {{coincide with the}} equilibrium constant at any moment in time. This is established for batch reactors, and similar relations hold for steady-state plug-flow reactors, replacing <b>astronomic</b> <b>time</b> by residence time. Such relationships can be termed time invariants of chemical kinetics. Key words: kinetics; transient response; thermodynamics process; batch...|$|E
5|$|Evidence from {{daughter}} {{products of}} short-lived radioactive isotopes {{shows that a}} nearby supernova helped determine {{the composition of the}} Solar System 4.5billion years ago, and may even have triggered the formation of this system. Supernova production of heavy elements over <b>astronomic</b> periods of <b>time</b> ultimately made the chemistry of life on Earth possible.|$|R
