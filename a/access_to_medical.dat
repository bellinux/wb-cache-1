5|$|From {{the start}} of 2010 to November 2014, 43 {{hospitals}} in rural areas closed. Critics claimed that the new law caused these hospitals to close. Many of these rural hospitals were built using funds from the 1946 Hill–Burton Act, to increase <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>medical</b> care in rural areas. Some of these hospitals reopened as other medical facilities, but {{only a small number}} operated emergency rooms (ER) or urgent care centers.|$|E
5|$|Rats {{that live}} {{their entire lives}} indoors usually are able to avoid disease-causing {{bacteria}} such as Salmonella and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; the latter is absent in treated water. They may also more easily avoid vectors like cockroaches, beetles, and fleas which are essential for the spread of endemic typhus and intestinal parasites like the Rat tapeworm. Additionally, pet or laboratory rats enjoy the intrinsic benefits of having a consistent and well-balanced diet, along with <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>medical</b> care.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, Watts {{settled in}} Durham, N.C. with his wife, Constance Merrick Watts, {{a native of}} the town. He opened a private clinic in general surgery for poor people and African Americans, as blacks had very limited <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>medical</b> services. In 1965, he was the chief of surgery at the Lincoln Hospital, {{which was one of the}} city's few {{hospitals}} to serve blacks. The hospital consisted of 150 beds. The hospital was also one of the few hospitals in America at that time which allow African American doctors to perform surgery. While working as chief of surgery Watts also served as a trainer for the hospital's interns. In the 1970s he played a major role in establishing the Lincoln Community Health Center.|$|E

5|$|Charles DeWitt Watts (September 21, 1917 – July 12, 2004) was an African American {{surgeon and}} activist for the poor. Watts {{was the first}} surgeon of African American ancestry in North Carolina. Earning his medical degree in 1943 from Howard University College, {{he was the first}} African American board {{certified}} surgeon to serve in North Carolina. After surgical training at Freedman's Hospital in Washington, D.C. in 1949, he moved to Durham, North Carolina in 1950 and established a clinic to provide <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>medical</b> services for the poor. Breaking the social customs of racial obstacles, he advocated for certification of African American medical students. He also became a member of many professional colleges including the National Academy of Science's Institute of Medicine and the American College of Surgeons. He served as chief of surgery at Durham's Lincoln Hospital and was later one of the key figures in converting it to the Lincoln Community Health Center, a low-priced clinic for the poor.|$|E
5|$|Medical centers, dispensaries and {{hospitals}} are {{found throughout the}} island, although they are concentrated in urban areas and particularly in Antananarivo. <b>Access</b> <b>to</b> <b>medical</b> care remains {{beyond the reach of}} many Malagasy, especially in the rural areas, and many recourse to traditional healers. In addition to the high expense of medical care relative to the average Malagasy income, the prevalence of trained medical professionals remains extremely low. In 2010 Madagascar had an average of three hospital beds per 10,000people and a total of 3,150doctors, 5,661nurses, 385community health workers, 175pharmacists and 57dentists for a population of 22million. 14.6percent of government spending in 2008 was directed toward the health sector. Approximately 70percent of spending on health was contributed by the government, while 30percent originated with international donors and other private sources. The government provides at least one basic health center per commune. Private health centers are concentrated within urban areas and particularly those of the central highlands.|$|E
5|$|The {{industry}} {{has come under}} threat, both from {{a decline in the}} number of ships scrapped annually – down from 70–80 to about 20 – and because of environmental and work safety concerns. There have been complaints that journalists and human rights activists are being barred from the ship breaking yards. The ship breaking industry is purportedly damaging the local ecology as well, taking a toll on the fish population and soil quality. A survey conducted by students of the Institute of Marine Science of Chittagong University in 2007 revealed that the soil of the locality is polluted by heavy metals including mercury (0.5 to 2.7ppm), lead (0.5 to 21.8ppm), chromium (220ppm), cadmium (0.3 to 2.9ppm), iron (2.6 to 5.6ppm), calcium (5.2 to 23.2ppm) and magnesium (6.5 to 10.57ppm). Safety standards in the industry are low; between 1995 and 2005, 150 workers were killed and 576 were maimed or injured. The main causes of death were fire or explosion, suffocation and inhaling CO2. These old ships also contain hazardous substances like asbestos, lead paint, heavy metals and PCBs. The workers are paid US$1.75 a day and have little <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>medical</b> treatment. Among the workers, 41% of are aged between 18 and 22 years, and many are reported to be as young as 10 years of age. There have also been allegations of large quantities of steel and non-ferrous items, such as bronze, aluminum, copper, and bronze-amalgam recovered from ship breaking being smuggled out of Bangladesh. There also are reports of pirates targeting tugboats pulling ships in.|$|E
