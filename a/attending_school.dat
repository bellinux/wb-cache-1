5|$|Education in Malta is {{compulsory}} through age {{sixteen and}} is offered through three different providers: the state, the church, {{and the private}} sector. The state is responsible for promoting education and instruction and ensuring universal access to education for all Maltese citizens {{the existence of a}} system of schools and institutions accessible to all Maltese citizens. The objectives of education in Malta include intellectual and moral development and the preparation of every citizen to contribute productively to the national economy. Although Maltese citizens had access to education during the Arab occupation of 870 to 1090, the arrival of a number of religious orders in the following four centuries brought religious-based education to the island for wealthy families. The arrival of the Knights Hospitaller saw the establishment of the University of Malta, around which a number of primary, secondary and post-secondary institutions were established. Education in Malta has been universally available at the primary level since the ejection of the Knights Hospitaller by the French in 1798, when state-funded elementary schooling was established. In 1878, English replaced Italian as the primary language of instruction, and education was made compulsory in 1946 in response to a number of children not <b>attending</b> <b>school</b> due to poverty between World Wars One and Two. The age at which education became compulsory was lowered to five years in 1988.|$|E

5|$|The United Nations ranked Sierra Leone 180 out of 187 {{on their}} Human Development Index. One {{of the major}} factors in this low world ranking was gender inequality. Despite a {{civil war in the}} country, {{football}} remained important to many young people, regardless of gender, in the country. The reason was that football was seen as one way of understanding life by watching what happened on the pitch. In 2007, a football administrator from the country {{is in charge of the}} women's football committee in the West African Football Union. In 2011, Brazilian women's football superstar Marta visited the country and met with the national team.

5|$|Within weeks Jan {{was sent}} from the {{familiar}} surroundings of Klipfontein to a boarding house at Riebeek West, {{to take his}} brother's place {{at the school of}} Mr TC Stoffberg. As had been the case with his brother, his parents had already mapped out his future; like his brother Jan was destined for a future in the Dutch Reformed Church, to be ordained as a predikant at the conclusion of his studies. This vocation, though imposed upon him by his parents, was by no means regarded as an imposition by Jan, growing up as he had in an environment where adherence to the Church and piety of deeds counted for a good deal. This upbringing had turned twelve-year-old Jan into a deeply religious, serious-minded boy. Now, <b>attending</b> <b>school</b> for the first time, he faced a number of obstacles. Foremost amongst these was his rudimentary grasp of English, {{at a time when it}} was the main medium of instruction and crucial for any Afrikaner who wished to play a role in wider Cape society. Thanks to his mother's efforts. in this as well as in other subjects, he was better prepared than most children in similar circumstances, but nevertheless he was to start his schooling alongside children many years younger than himself with many years of study separating him from his contemporaries.|$|E

She has a playful personality and has an extremely strong pet dog named Chibi-Moth, which is actually a familiar created by Kotori {{from the body of}} her dead pet dog Pero. However, she is not affiliated with Gaia or Guardian, and instead follows in the path of an ancient sect of summoners called Druids who revered nature and protected Kagari with familiars. Another heroine is first-year student Sizuru Nakatsu, a shy girl on the public morals committee who has excellent hearing, eyesight and can read lips. She has heterochromia, though wears an eyepatch over her golden-colored right eye as she is very self-conscious about it; her left eye is blue. Sizuru is a member of Guardian who has the ability to produce various chemicals inside her body which can be used to heal herself and others, paralyze and cause amnesia. Sizuru joins the club with her close friend Lucia Konohana, another heroine and the class representative of Kotarou's class. Lucia is easily agitated by the antics of boys and often punches Kotarou when he annoys her. She is obsessed with cleanliness and always wears gloves. Like Sizuru, Lucia is a member of Guardian and has the ability to produces poisonous miasma and pus {{as a result of an}} experiment by Guardian, which she takes medication for to suppress. She can also create vibrations within the objects she touches and break glass at a distance.
