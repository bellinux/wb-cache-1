5|$|The {{specific}} <b>access</b> <b>method</b> {{will depend}} on the skills and abilities of the user. With direct selection a body part, pointer, adapted mouse, joystick, or eye tracking could be used, whereas switch access scanning is often used for indirect selection. Unlike direct selection (e.g., typing on a keyboard, touching a screen), users of Target Scanning can only make selections when the scanning indicator (or cursor) of the electronic device is on the desired choice. Those who are unable to point typically calibrate their eyes to use eye gaze as a way to point and blocking as a way to select desired words and phrases. The speed and pattern of scanning, as well as the way items are selected, are individualized to the physical, visual and cognitive capabilities of the user.|$|E

Multi-dimensional <b>access</b> <b>methods</b> have developed for supporting fast retrieval of multi-dimensional data from multi-dimensional databases.

40|$|Many spatial <b>access</b> <b>methods,</b> {{such as the}} R-tree, {{have been}} {{designed}} to support spatial search operators (e. g., overlap, containment, and enclosure) over both points and regional objects in multi-dimensional spaces. Unfortunately, contemporary spatial <b>access</b> <b>methods</b> are limited by many problems that significantly degrade the query performance in high-dimensional spaces. This chapter reviews the problems of contemporary spatial <b>access</b> <b>methods</b> in spaces with many dimensions and presents an efficient approach to building advanced spatial <b>access</b> <b>methods</b> that effectively attack these problems. It also discusses the importance of high-dimensional spatial <b>access</b> <b>methods</b> for the emerging database applications, such as location-based services...|$|R

40|$|Efficient {{implementation}} of <b>access</b> <b>methods</b> {{is crucial for}} many database systems. Today, database systems are increasingly being employed to support new applications involving multi-dimensional data. A large variety of specialized <b>access</b> <b>methods</b> {{have been developed to}} solve specific problems. These specialized <b>access</b> <b>methods</b> are usually hand-coded from scratch. The effort required to implement and maintain such data structures is high. As an alternative to developing new data structures from scratch, some researchers have tried to simplify search tree technology by generalization. This thesis generalizes <b>access</b> <b>methods</b> at multiple levels, starting with hierarchical search-tree <b>access</b> <b>methods.</b> The basic logic and commonalities among different database search trees are explored.

40|$|The {{specifications}} of Digital Video Broadcasting - Return Channel via Satellite(DVB-RCS 2) {{state that}} the satellite gateway could introduce both random and dedicated <b>access</b> <b>methods</b> to distribute the capacity among the different home users. Before starting an engineering process to design an algorithm allowing to combine both methods, it seems necessary to assess the performance of each. This paper compares random and dedicated <b>access</b> <b>methods</b> by measuring {{their impact on the}} performance of Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) sessions when the home users exploit the DVB-RCS 2 link for regular use (e. g., web browsing or email transmission). In this paper we detail the implementation of an NS- 2 module emulating Physical Channel Access (PCA). This module fills a gap in terms of random and deterministic <b>access</b> <b>methods</b> and allows to model various satellite channel access strategies. Based on NS- 2 simulations using realistic system parameters of the DVB-RCS 2 link, we demonstrate that, compared to dedicated <b>access</b> <b>methods,</b> which generally result in higher levels of transmitted data, random <b>access</b> <b>methods</b> enable faster transmission for short flows. We propose to combine random and dedicated <b>access</b> <b>methods,</b> with the selection of a specific method dependent on the dynamic load of the network and the sequence number of the TCP segments...|$|R

40|$|Laserscanning {{produces}} large sets of multidimensional point data, which {{demand for}} {{an effective and}} efficient organization and storage. Adequate data structures must perform specific spatial queries and operations {{in order to support}} the computation and / or the construction of surface models. Because of their increasing size, it is not advisable to organize the clouds of points by mainmemory data structures. Such an approach would lead to long loading times and misses scalability. Instead, persistent data structures are desirable. In this paper, the usage of multidimensional spatial <b>access</b> <b>methods</b> are investigated for organizing laserscanner data. Such <b>access</b> <b>methods</b> have originally been developed for storing and indexing geographic data in spatial database systems and Geographical Information Systems. Point <b>access</b> <b>methods</b> based on hierarchical hash trees are one important class of such <b>access</b> <b>methods.</b> Typical examples for hash trees are the BANG file and the buddy tree. Rectangle <b>access</b> <b>methods</b> are another class of relevant <b>access</b> <b>methods.</b> The R-tree and its variants are the most important representative of this class. R-trees are typically used by commercial spatial database systems. All data structures mentioned before are fully dynamic, i. e. they support arbitrary sequences of insertions, modifications and deletions. They allow a persistent storage of multidimensional points and preserve spatial proximity locally, i. e. within (database or file) blocks. The performance of the above point and rectangle <b>access</b> <b>methods</b> is investigated and compared for storing and querying large clouds of points representing buildings. The examination identifies those <b>access</b> <b>methods</b> that allow a fast construction of the data structure as well as an efficient support of relevant spatial queries. For some queries, however, a local preservation of spatial proximity is not sufficient. The extraction of points for overview purposes is an example fo...|$|R

500|$|Direct {{activation}} of an AAC system is generally {{the first choice}} of <b>access</b> <b>method</b> as it is faster and cognitively easier. [...] Those unable to do so may use indirect selection or [...] "scanning". [...] In this method, items displayed for selection are scanned; the scanning may be visual using indicators such as lights, highlighting, and/or contrasting borders, or auditory using spoken prompts from a communication partner or device. When the desired message is reached, the AAC user indicates the choice using an alternative selection technique such as a switch, vocalization or gesture. Several different patterns for switch access scanning are available: in [...] "circular scanning", the items are displayed in a circle and then scanned one at a time. It is often introduced first to children or beginning AAC users because it is the easiest to understand. In [...] "linear scanning", items are organized in rows and are scanned one at a time until a choice is made. Although more demanding than circular scanning, it is still easy to learn. Finally, in [...] "group-item scanning", items are grouped and the groups scanned consecutively. Once a particular group is selected, items within the group are scanned. One of the most common group-item strategies is row-column scanning in which each row forms a group. The rows of items are scanned and when a row is selected, the items in the row are scanned one at a time until a message is selected.|$|E
