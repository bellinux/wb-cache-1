5|$|<b>All</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>left</b> of Missouri Row is a four-sided {{concrete}} fireplace {{surrounded by}} pieces of foundation, a few sets of stairs, metal plumbing, and a retaining wall. East of that, surrounding {{what is now}} the Monte Ne boat launch, are remnants of limestone structures. Some of these are foundations from the broad wooden staircase built in front of Hotel Monte Ne; some are structural components for the twin stone bridges that crossed the lagoon and some are simply low retaining walls. The amphitheater and the retaining wall built for the Pyramid are underwater. Occasionally, when water levels drop in summer, they can be seen.|$|E

25|$|On the {{outskirts}} of the village near Monk Stray was Elmfield College, a Primitive Methodist foundation which existed from 1864 to 1932, when it merged with Ashville College in Harrogate. <b>All</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>left</b> of the college now is numbers 1 and 9 Straylands Grove, next to Monk Stray, and staff housing along Elmfield Terrace and Willow Grove.|$|E
25|$|St. Lachtain's Church, Freshford {{was built}} in 1731, {{incorporating}} a portal from 1100 as its main entrance, <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>left</b> of the original church is the beautiful Hiberno-Romanesque (Irish-Roman) architectural porch and doorway. The remainder of the present church was built for Protestant worship in 1731. In St. Lachtains time Freshford was a diocese. In 1225 a bishops palace was built at Aghore (Achadh Ur), now Uppercourt. It {{was used as a}} summer residence for over 300 years.|$|E

25|$|Lowell was at {{one time}} a sizable mining town located just to the {{southeast}} of Old Bisbee. The majority of the original townsite was consumed by the excavation of the Lavender Pit mine during the 1950s. <b>All</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>left</b> today is {{a small portion of}} Erie Street, along with Evergreen Cemetery, Saginaw subdivision and Lowell Middle School. These days Lowell is considered by most of the local residents {{to be more of a}} place name than an operating community.|$|E
25|$|A {{huge part}} of the {{economic}} life of Glasgow was once located in Springburn, where the Saracen Foundry, engineering works of firms like Charles Tennant and locomotive workshops employed many Glaswegians. Indeed, Glasgow dominated this type of manufacturing, with 25% of all the world's locomotives being built in the area at one stage. It was home to {{the headquarters of the}} North British Locomotive Company. Today part of the St. Rollox railway works continues in use as a railway maintenance facility, <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>left</b> of the industry in Springburn.|$|E
25|$|With a {{total area}} of , New Delhi forms {{a small part}} of the Delhi {{metropolitan}} area. Since the city is located on the Indo-Gangetic Plain, there is little difference in elevation across the city. New Delhi and surrounding areas were once a part of the Aravali Range; <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>left</b> of those mountains is the Delhi Ridge, which is also called the Lungs of Delhi. While New Delhi lies on the floodplains of the Yamuna River, it is essentially a landlocked city. East of the river is the urban area of Shahdara. New Delhi falls under the seismic zone-IV, making it vulnerable to earthquakes.|$|E

25|$|Besides {{the water}} board {{facilities}} and the New River, Clissold Park contains two large ornamental lakes, {{a home to}} many water birds and a population of terrapins. These lakes—purportedly the remains of clay pits dug for the bricks used {{in the building of}} Clissold House—are <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>left</b> to mark the course of the Hackney Brook, one of London's lost rivers, which once flowed from west to east across Stoke Newington {{on its way to the}} River Lea. In flood at this point, the brook was known to span 10 metres. The two lakes are not fed from the brook, which has disappeared into the maze of sewers under London, but from the mains supply—the New River.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the reasons}} so {{little is known about}} the Library is that it was lost centuries after its creation. <b>All</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>left</b> of many of the volumes are tantalizing titles that hint at all the history lost due to the building's destruction. Few events in ancient history are as {{controversial}} as the destruction of the Library, as the historical record is both contradictory and incomplete. Its destruction has been attributed by some authors to, among others, Julius Caesar, Augustus Caesar, and Catholic zealots during the purge of the Arian heresy, Not surprisingly, the Great Library became a symbol of knowledge itself, and its destruction was attributed to those who were portrayed as ignorant barbarians, often for purely political reasons.|$|E
25|$|The village {{became a}} ghost town, quickly {{taken over by}} the local poor and homeless, while the factory was partly sold-off as {{individual}} units. In the 1930s the work of demolishing the village began, to make way for new council houses. Further redevelopment of the site after World War II removed more traces, including the school, a prefabricated building estimated to have a working life of ten years yet in constant use for sixty-three! Now <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>left</b> of the whole project is two blocks that were once the food-store and the butcher’s (both now listed buildings but still under threat of demolition), and several of the original sheds on the factory site – though their future is now in some doubt since BAe moved out in early 2010.|$|E
50|$|The entire {{firm and}} both of its {{divisions}} and their separate buildings were destroyed the night of November 9, 1872, {{in what has been}} called the Great Boston Fire of 1872. <b>All</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>was</b> the company's good will and its formulas.|$|R

25|$|The novel {{presents}} Jack as initially likable and well-intentioned but {{haunted by}} the demons of alcohol and authority issues. Nonetheless, he becomes gradually overwhelmed by the evil forces in the hotel. At the novel's conclusion, the hotel forces have possessed Jack's body and proceed to destroy <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>left</b> of his mind during a final showdown with Danny, leaving a monstrous entity that Danny is able to divert while he, Wendy and Dick Halloran escape. The film's Jack is established as somewhat sinister much earlier in the story and dies in a different manner. Jack actually kills Dick Hallorann in the film, but only wounds him in the novel. King attempted to talk Stanley Kubrick out of casting Jack Nicholson even before filming began, {{on the grounds that}} he seemed vaguely sinister {{from the very beginning of}} the film, and had suggested Jon Voight among others for the role.|$|E
25|$|In {{the center}} of {{downtown}} is the Church of San Francisco, finished {{at the beginning of}} the 18th century and from then on the most important in town, serving as the cathedral until the 20th century. It and the attached cloister is <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>left</b> of a large complex that included several chapels and an orchard that extended for blocks to the east and south. On the facade, there is a depicting of Saint James fighting the Moors, cutting the head off of one. The main altar is Neoclassic, and replaced what reputedly was a masterpiece of Baroque design. This has happened frequently in the city; those Baroque altars not plundered over the course of Mexican history were replaced by newer designs. Older Baroque side altarpieces are still here, and are covered in gold leaf. Other notable pieces here include a large Baroque music stand and the seating of the choir section both done by architect Francisco Eduardo Tresguerras of Celaya in the 18th century. There are also sculptures done by Mariano Montenegro and Mariano Arce.|$|E
25|$|By the 1920s and 30s on {{the higher}} land of Hampton, the first houses on Hampton Pier Avenue and Swalecliffe Avenue were being built; {{this time as}} a suburb of Herne Bay. Houses {{eventually}} filled Hampton Hill {{to the east of}} Hampton Pier Avenue, and Studd Hill to the south of the Hampton-on-Sea site. From 1929 to 1966 there was a boating lake in place of the landward oyster pond; it is now a playground. Besides the stub of Hampton Pier and the Hampton Inn, the curved shape of the Land Company's 1900 sea wall, visible at low tide, is <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>left</b> of Hampton-on-Sea. From the 1990s to 2005 this object, known as The Rocks, was considered a shipping hazard, mainly with respect to the jetskiers who ignored and vandalised safety notices about jetskiing near The Rocks. Some chunks of it were removed by contractors until local objections prevented further loss of this landmark which now shelters rockpools, mussels and feeding birds. The coast was conserved in 1959 to 1960 with a new sea defence, and in the same years the landscaping that followed a cliff drainage scheme running down from the Studd Hill estate replaced sea poppies and summer crickets with lawn.|$|E
50|$|With the {{electronics}} division empty, Ferranti-Packard {{was once again}} a major electrical vendor only. Over the years, many other specialty divisions were sold off or closed, and eventually <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>was</b> the original Packard transformer division. It <b>was</b> this <b>that</b> VA TECH purchased.|$|R

500|$|Much of {{the prison}} was {{demolished}} in the 1870s, though parts of it were used as shops and rooms into the 20th century. A local library now stands on the site. <b>All</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>left</b> of the Marshalsea is the long brick wall that marked its southern boundary, the existence of what Dickens called [...] "the crowding ghosts of many miserable years" [...] recalled only by a plaque from the local council. [...] "t is gone now," [...] he wrote, [...] "and the world is none the worse without it." ...|$|E
500|$|Watts {{himself was}} {{ambivalent}} when questioned about the religious {{significance of the}} image, saying that [...] "I made Hope blind so expecting nothing", although after his death his widow Mary Seton Watts wrote that {{the message of the}} painting was that [...] "Faith must be the companion of Hope. Faith is the substance, the assurance of things hoped for, because it is the evidence of things not seen." [...] Malcolm Warner, curator of the Yale Center for British Art, interpreted the work differently, writing in 1996 that [...] "the quiet sound of the lyre's single string is <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>left</b> of the full music of religious faith; those who still listen are blindfolded in the sense that, even if real reasons for Hope exist, they cannot see them; Hope remains a virtue, but in the age of scientific materialism a weak and ambiguous one".|$|E
500|$|The labourers {{worked in}} 12-hour shifts of 3,000–4,000 men, with three 20-minute breaks during each shift. The work {{continued}} around the clock, {{seven days a}} week, under giant floodlights during the night. The living and working conditions were extremely harsh, especially for the political prisoners and the eastern Europeans, who were given especially punitive treatment due to their status as the most expendable members of the workforce. For the non-German workers, falling ill or being unable to work through injury {{was the equivalent of}} a death sentence, as they would either be left to die or be transported back to the concentration camps from which they had been brought. A German commission that inspected the labour camps in the area in late 1943 commented: [...] "The Eastern [...] worker is very tough. He works at his job until he falls flat on his face in the mire, and <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>left</b> for the doctor to do is to issue the death certificate." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{manor house}} was a {{farmhouse}} by the early 18th century and <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> of the village <b>was</b> <b>that</b> farm, a watermill and a cottage.|$|R
50|$|Many {{portions}} of the Philco side of the company were sold off in the early 1970s. By 1975 <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>was</b> the original Aeronutronic divisions.
