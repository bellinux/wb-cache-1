5|$|Dudley was {{credited}} with discovering that a toxic component of tobacco smoke is carbon monoxide (which poisons the blood by interfering with oxygen's ability to bind to hemoglobin). Dudley rejected the popularly held opinion that cigarette smoke was harmful due to the <b>adulteration</b> of the tobacco, e. g. with opium. His experiments showed the toxic agent to be carbon monoxide, resulting alike from cigarette, pipe, or cigar.|$|E
5|$|In 17th-century Germany, the {{physician}} Eberhard Gockel discovered lead-contaminated wine {{to be the}} cause of an epidemic of colic. He had noticed that monks who did not drink wine were healthy, while wine drinkers developed colic, and traced the cause to sugar of lead, made by simmering litharge with vinegar. As a result, Eberhard Ludwig, Duke of Württemberg issued an edict in 1696 banning the <b>adulteration</b> of wines with litharge.|$|E
5|$|Inexpensive {{powdered}} S.luteus fruit {{bodies are}} sometimes {{added to the}} more expensive B.edulis mushroom soup powder, a fraudulent practice {{that is difficult to}} detect with microscopy because the tissues are no longer intact. This <b>adulteration</b> can be determined chemically, however, by testing for increased levels of the sugar alcohols arabitol and mannitol. The practice can also be determined with a DNA-based method that is sensitive enough to detect the addition of 1–2% of S.luteus to B.edulis powder.|$|E
25|$|As of July 2010, Chinese {{authorities}} were still reporting some seizures of melamine-contaminated dairy product in some provinces, {{though it was}} unclear whether these new contaminations constituted wholly new <b>adulterations</b> or were the result of illegal reuse of material from the 2008 <b>adulterations.</b>|$|R
40|$|International audienceNatural {{extracts}} used in fine fragrances (alcoholic perfumes) {{are rare}} and precious. As such, they represent an interesting target for fraudulent practices called <b>adulterations.</b> Absolutes, important {{materials used in}} the creation of perfumes, are obtained by organic solvent extraction of raw plant materials. Because the nonvolatile part of these natural extracts is not normalized and scarcely reported, highlighting potential <b>adulterations</b> present in this fraction appears highly challenging. For the first time, we investigated the use of nontargeted UHPLC-ToFMS metabolomics for this purpose, considering Viola odorata l., a plant largely used in the perfume industry, as a model. Significant differences in the metabolic fingerprints of the violet leaf absolutes were evidenced according to geographical locations, and/or <b>adulterations.</b> Additionally, markers of the geographical origin were detected through their molecular weight/most probable molecular formula and retention time, while <b>adulterations</b> were statistically validated. In this study, we thus clearly demonstrated the efficiency of UHPLC-ToFMS-based metabolomics in accelerating both the identification of the origin of raw materials as well as the search for potential <b>adulterations</b> in absolutes, natural products of high added value...|$|R

5|$|Plant {{medicines}} {{can cause}} adverse effects and even death, whether by side-effects of their active substances, by <b>adulteration</b> or contamination, by overdose, or by inappropriate prescription. Many such effects are known, while others {{remain to be}} explored scientifically. There {{is no reason to}} presume that because a product comes from nature it must be safe: the existence of powerful natural poisons like atropine and nicotine shows this to be untrue. Further, the high standards applied to conventional medicines do not always apply to plant medicines, and dose can vary widely depending on the growth conditions of plants: older plants may be much more toxic than young ones, for instance.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of Accum's publications {{were written in}} English. They were executed in a style that made them quite accessible to the common man. Many scientific contributions were brought forth through his writings, which were influential in the popularization of chemistry during this era. In 1820, Accum published Treatise on <b>Adulteration</b> of Food, in which he denounced the use of chemical additives to food. This ground-breaking work {{marked the beginning of}} an awareness of need for food safety oversight. Accum {{was the first person to}} tackle the subject and to reach a wide audience through his activities. His book, controversial at the time, found a wide audience and sold well. However, it threatened established practices within the food processing industry, earning him many enemies among the London food manufacturers. Accum left England after a lawsuit was brought against him. He lived out the rest of his life as a teacher at an industrial institution in Berlin.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{attempts}} at quality control and standardisation, an extensive history of saffron <b>adulteration,</b> {{particularly among the}} cheapest grades, continues into modern times. <b>Adulteration</b> was first documented in Europe's Middle Ages, when those found selling adulterated saffron were executed under the Safranschou code. Typical methods include mixing in extraneous substances like beetroot, pomegranate fibres, red-dyed silk fibres, or the saffron crocus's tasteless and odourless yellow stamens. Other methods included dousing saffron fibres with viscid substances like honey or vegetable oil to increase their weight. Powdered saffron is more prone to <b>adulteration,</b> with turmeric, paprika, and other powders used as diluting fillers. <b>Adulteration</b> can also consist of selling mislabelled mixes of different saffron grades. Thus, in India, high-grade Kashmiri saffron is often sold and mixed with cheaper Iranian imports; these mixes are then marketed as pure Kashmiri saffron, a development that has cost Kashmiri growers much of their income. Safflower is a common substitute sometimes sold as saffron. The spice is reportedly counterfeited with horse hair, corn silk, or shredded paper. Tartrazine or sunset yellow {{have been used to}} colour counterfeit powdered saffron.|$|E

25|$|<b>Adulteration</b> {{of honey}} is the {{addition}} of other sugars, syrups, or compounds into honey to change its flavor or viscosity, make it cheaper to produce, or increase the fructose content to stave off crystallization. According to the Codex Alimentarius of the United Nations, any product labeled as honey or pure honey must be a wholly natural product, although different nations have their own laws concerning labeling. <b>Adulteration</b> of honey is sometimes used {{as a method of}} deception when buyers are led to believe that the honey is pure. The practice was common dating back to ancient times, when crystallized honey was often mixed with flour or other fillers, hiding the <b>adulteration</b> from buyers until the honey was liquefied. In modern times, the most common adulteration-ingredient became clear, almost-flavorless corn syrup, which, when mixed with honey, is often very difficult to distinguish from unadulterated honey.|$|E

40|$|Citation: Washington, Rebecca Rees. Food <b>adulterations</b> [...] Senior thesis, Kansas State Agricultural College, 1905. Introduction: The {{question}} of food <b>adulterations</b> is of very great importance {{at the present}} time, since the greater amount of our food supply consists of canned and preserved products. Not many years ago, canned food products were considered luxuries, and only people of means could afford them, but as times have grovel better, {{there is a growing}} demand, by all classes of people, for the manufactured goods, and it id the producer trying to meet the popular demand that has, in c great measure, facilitated the manufacture of goods which must necessarily be inferior. The average individual wants the greatest quantity for the least money, regardless of the purity of the article purchased. Manufacturers cannot give high grade food for low prices. Hence the pure product is imitated by using cheap, undesirable, and often poisonous, substances, to give the desired flavor and color. This brings to mind an instance under my own observation. A woman was purchasing baking powder. The clerk showed her several of the better brands and gave prices. She remarked that she wanted something cheaper and when shown the ten cent can, she took it. The law of the state of New York defines <b>adulterations</b> of food as follows: The term food shall include every article of food and drink used and <b>adulterations</b> are (1) If any substance or substances has or have been mixed with it so as to reduce or lower, or injuriously affect, its quality or strength. (2) If any inferior or cheaper substance or substances have been substituted, wholly or in part, for the article. (3) If any valuable material has been wholly or in part abstracted...|$|R
