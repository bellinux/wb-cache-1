5|$|As a freshman, Amadi was {{designated}} a redshirt {{and did not}} play. As a backup cornerback in 2002, Amadi received substantial playing time due to personnel changes resulting in him being the sole backup to both starting cornerbacks. He continued in a reserve role through 2004. After backing up cornerback Theo Baines as a junior, Amadi started much of his senior season in place of Baines due to nagging injuries. In a November game against the Nebraska Cornhuskers, Amadi blocked a punt which was returned for a touchdown by teammate Darren Rus, marking the second time the two had combined to return a blocked punt for a touchdown. By early November, Amadi had recorded 22 tackles and two fumble recoveries in his final and most successful college season. Amadi also played on the college indoor track and field team while <b>at</b> <b>Kansas</b> when not involved in football activities.|$|E

5|$|He {{returned}} to the Nationwide Series full-time for Penske in 2013 to drive the No. 12, now a Ford Mustang after Penske changed manufacturers. Hornish's 2013 season was his best to date, with 16 top-five and 25 top-ten finishes. At the season-opening DRIVE4COPD 300 at Daytona International Speedway, Hornish started and finished second despite his involvement in a serious crash on the final lap. Since race winner Tony Stewart was only eligible to score points for the Sprint Cup Series, Hornish was the series points leader after the Daytona race. At the Sam's Town 300 at Las Vegas Motor Speedway, he led for 114 laps in his second Nationwide victory. Before the season-ending Ford EcoBoost 300 at Homestead-Miami Speedway Hornish was second in points, eight behind Austin Dillon. Hornish qualified in the pole position and led for 37 laps, finishing eighth; Dillon, who finished twelfth, won the series championship. Hornish was second in the final point standings, with 1,177. During the season, car owner Roger Penske said that Hornish (who had driven for the team since 2004) would be released {{due to a lack}} of sponsorship. Hornish planned to drive Penske's No. 12 in the Sprint Cup Series <b>at</b> <b>Kansas</b> and Talladega. <b>At</b> <b>Kansas</b> he started in fourth place, running as high as third before crashing on lap 183 due to winds. The qualifier was rained out at Talladega, and Hornish failed to qualify because he had only one other Cup start that season.|$|E
5|$|Hornish {{returned}} to the Sprint Cup Series for one race in Penske's No. 12: the STP 400 <b>at</b> <b>Kansas</b> Speedway. Starting in 10th place, he led for seven laps and finished 19th (one lap behind). Midway through the season, Hornish replaced A. J. Allmendinger in Penske's No. 22 car after Allmendinger was suspended by NASCAR for failing a drug test. Allmendinger qualified in eighth place, but due to the driver change Hornish had {{to move to the}} rear of the field. He finished 33rd, after a mid-race crash required ten laps of repair time. Hornish drove the car in the remaining races, with a season-best fifth place at Watkins Glen. Aside from that race, his best finishes were a trio of eleventh places at Atlanta, Richmond and Chicagoland. Hornish's best start of the season was fourth at Dover, where he finished 25th (seven laps behind).|$|E
5|$|Ralph Friedgen led {{the team}} for his eighth season as head coach and was {{assisted}} by first-year offensive coordinator James Franklin and third-year defensive coordinator Chris Cosh. It was the first season since the departure of Charlie Taaffe in 2005 that Friedgen did not call the offensive plays himself. Instead, those duties were handled by Franklin, a former Maryland wide receivers coach, who returned after a brief stint <b>at</b> <b>Kansas</b> State and in the National Football League (NFL). With him, Franklin brought a new system: the West Coast offense. Cosh, whose complex defensive scheme had been criticized as too passive, resigned {{at the end of}} the season.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} week <b>at</b> <b>Kansas</b> Speedway, Foyt and his teammate Ed Carpenter shared the third row, with Foyt qualifying 5th. It {{was his best}} career start and second top-10 start in a row. In the RoadRunner Turbo Indy 300, Foyt had his chances of a high finish end as his car {{was caught in the}} pits when an accident involving Buddy Rice occurred. Foyt would drive to an eighth-place finish. Foyt's best finish of the season came in the Iowa Corn Indy 250 in June at the Iowa Speedway where he finished fifth. Foyt finished 19th in points.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} changes of driver before the race. Red Bull Racing Team {{announced}} regular driver A. J. Allmendinger {{would be replaced}} by Mike Skinner who would drive at Talladega, and by former Scuderia Torro Rosso, Formula One driver Scott Speed who would drive in the seven remaining races of the season. Red Bull Racing {{vice president and general}} manager Jay Frye said this change would allow the Red Bull Racing Team to continue its development for the future. Kenny Wallace took over from Michael McDowell in the No. 00 Michael Waltrip Racing car at Talladega, because the team decided to regroup after he failed to qualify the previous race weekend <b>at</b> <b>Kansas</b> Speedway. Richard Childress Racing fielded a fourth car driven by Nationwide Series driver Mike Wallace.|$|E
5|$|Tyler {{was born}} to Nicole Edwards and Kevin Lockett who, having played <b>at</b> <b>Kansas</b> State from 1993 to 1996, was the school's all-time leading {{receiver}} before being passed by Tyler, and also played in the NFL for the Kansas City Chiefs. His uncle, Aaron, who played at K-State from 1998 to 2001, was their fourth all-time leading receiver {{as well as their}} second all-time leading punt returner. Aaron also holds Big 12 Conference records and set the school record in the 60 meters. Kansas State head coach Bill Snyder had coached his father and uncle. His paternal grandparents are John and Beatrice Lockett and his maternal grandparents are Marvin D. Hopson and Shirley Edwards. Lockett is a Christian.|$|E

5|$|While Shay was {{managing}} <b>at</b> <b>Kansas</b> City in early 1910, American Association president Thomas Chivington imposed new conduct {{rules for the}} league. The new system emphasized fines for players and managers rather than simply ejecting them when they behaved poorly. After Shay was ejected from three games in a four-game span, a Minnesota newspaper article questioned whether his behavior {{would be subject to}} additional disciplinary action. The next month, Shay released 48-year-old Jake Beckley, prompting his retirement after one of the longest careers in professional baseball history. The first baseman had tried to make the Kansas City team after 20 years in the National League.|$|E
5|$|In September, Alexander {{believed}} {{that he would make}} his final selection with a December verbal commitment and an April signing of his National Letter of Intent. On October 7, the Hoophall Classic schedule was announced and Curie was scheduled to play Montverde Academy on January 20. By some accounts Kansas was a favorite because his girlfriend was a student <b>at</b> <b>Kansas</b> and the 2013–14 Kansas Jayhawks were scheduled to play the 2013–14 Duke Blue Devils at Chicago's United Center in the ESPN Champions Classic on November 12 just before his scheduled announcement. In 2013 Caelynn Manning-Allen became a freshman on the Kansas women's basketball team. However, Illinois was very excited to be in serious contention for Alexander. It was the first time since Derrick Rose in 2006 that a top 5 prospect was still considering Illinois so late into his senior year and Alexander's level of interest seemed much higher than Rose's. Following his Illinois visit, his scheduled announcement date had moved forward to November 15. On October 31, Alexander officially eliminated Michigan State from his candidate list, leaving Kansas, Illinois, DePaul and Memphis in contention.|$|E
