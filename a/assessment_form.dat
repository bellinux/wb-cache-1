Samsung's attorney clarified {{the purpose of the}} damage-only retrial and stated the result of the first trial, [...] "This is a case not where we're disputing that the 13 phones contain some elements of Apple's property," [...] but the company has disputed the $379.8 million amount that Apple claimed — Samsung presented a figure of $52 million. The San Jose jury eventually awarded Apple $290 million in damages after jurors completed a one-page <b>assessment</b> <b>form</b> for each infringed patent.

500|$|Michael Scott (Steve Carell) is {{assigned}} {{six hours of}} counseling with Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) after he physically reprimanded his nephew Luke (Evan Peters) in [...] "Nepotism", but Michael refuses to speak to Toby. One hour into their session, Toby tells Michael {{that he will not}} fill in the official <b>assessment</b> <b>form</b> unless Michael talks to him, so Michael begins telling ridiculous stories. Toby then tries the common counseling method of playing games with the client to get them to open up more. The method works, and Michael opens up to Toby about his personal history and relationships with people (he mentions seeing a baseball game with his stepfather where he was told that the team's manager deserved respect and how he never forgot that), and Toby makes an important discovery that Michael needs to be liked. Michael realizes what is happening, gets angry at Toby, and denigrates his counseling ability. Toby gives up and gives Michael the official form, allowing him to fill it out however he wants. In his haste, Michael accidentally checks off on the form that he is severely depressed and homicidal. Gabe contacts Toby, confused by his extreme assessment of Michael. Although Michael initially blames Toby for the mishap, he turns his ire to Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods), even making Toby laugh. Michael openly offers to return to the break room with Toby and [...] "bang this out". At the end of the episode, they are both talking and drawing pictures.|$|E

40|$|A {{variety of}} {{structured}} assessment tools {{for use in}} surgical training have been reported, but extant assessment tools often employ paper-based rating <b>forms.</b> Digital <b>assessment</b> <b>forms</b> for evaluating surgical skills could potentially offer advantages over paper-based forms, especially in complex assessment situations. In this paper, {{we report on the}} development of cross-platform digital <b>assessment</b> <b>forms</b> for use with multiple raters in order to facilitate the automatic processing of surgical skills assessments that include structured ratings. The FileMaker 13 platform was used to create a database containing the digital <b>assessment</b> <b>forms,</b> because this software has cross-platform functionality on both desktop computers and handheld devices. The database is hosted online, and the rating forms can therefore also be accessed through most modern web browsers. Cross-platform digital <b>assessment</b> <b>forms</b> were developed for the rating of surgical skills. The database platform used in this study was reasonably priced, intuitive for the user, and flexible. The forms have been provided online as free downloads that may {{serve as the basis for}} further development or as inspiration for future efforts. In conclusion, digital <b>assessment</b> <b>forms</b> can be used for the structured rating of surgical skills and have the potential to be especially useful in complex assessment situations with multiple raters, repeated assessments in various times and locations, and situations requiring substantial subsequent data processing or complex score calculations...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{describe}} nursing assessment documentation {{practices in}} aged care organizations and {{to evaluate the}} quality of electronic versus paper-based documentation of nursing assessment. Methods: This was a retrospective nursing documentation audit study. Study samples were 2299 paper-based and 6997 electronic resident <b>assessment</b> <b>forms</b> contained in 159 paper-based and 249 electronic resident nursing records, respectively, from three aged care organizations. The practice of nursing assessment documentation in participating aged care homes was described. Three attributes of quality of nursing assessment documentation were evaluated: format and structure, process, and content by seven measures: quantity, completeness, timeliness comprehensiveness, frequencies of documentation specific to care domains and data items, and whether <b>assessment</b> <b>forms</b> were signed and dated. Results: Varying practice in documentation of nursing assessment was found among different aged care organizations and homes. Electronic resident records contained higher numbers and more comprehensive resident <b>assessment</b> <b>forms</b> than paper-based records. The frequency of documentation was higher in electronic than in paper-based records in relation to most care domains. There {{was no difference between}} the two types of documentation systems on other aspects of nursing assessment documentation (overall completeness and timeliness, variation of frequencies among different care domains, and item completion in personal hygiene <b>assessment</b> <b>forms).</b> Conclusions: Electronic nursing documentation systems could improve the quality of documentation structure and format, process and content in the aspects of quantity, comprehensiveness and signing and dating of <b>assessment</b> <b>forms.</b> Further studies are needed to understand the factors leading to the variations of practice and the limitations of nursing assessment documentation and to evaluate documentation quality from a clinical perspective. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Today’s {{e-learning}} systems {{meet the}} challenge to provide interactive, personalized environments that support self-regulated learning {{as well as social}} collaboration and simulation. At the same time assessment procedures have to be adapted to the new learning environments by moving from isolated summative assessments to integrated <b>assessment</b> <b>forms.</b> Therefore, learning experiences enriched with complex didactic resources - such as virtualized collaborations and serious games - have emerged. In this extension of [1] an integrated model for e-assessment (IMA) is outlined, which incorporates complex learning resources and <b>assessment</b> <b>forms</b> as main components for the development of an enriched learning experience. For a validation the IMA was presented to a group of experts from the fields of cognitive science, pedagogy, and e-learning. The findings from the validation lead to several refinements of the model, which mainly concern the component <b>forms</b> of <b>assessment</b> and the integration of social aspects. Both aspects are accounted for in the revised model, the former by providing a detailed sub-model for <b>assessment</b> <b>forms...</b>|$|R

[Subjects and Methods] Three hundred and forty-four patients underwent an extensive evaluation, which included the following tests: 1) a Mini Nutritional <b>Assessment</b> Short <b>Form</b> to evaluate nutritional status; and 2) a Barthel Index assessment to evaluate functional status. We categorized patients into three age groups (65 - 74 yrs, 75 - 84 yrs, and > 85 yrs).
