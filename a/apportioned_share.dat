50|$|The {{effectiveness}} of the Union blockade and the peculiar industrial development of the Confederate States removed {{the possibility of an}} ample government revenue. Though import duties were levied, the proceeds amounted to almost nothing. A small export-duty on cotton was expected to produce a large revenue sufficient to base a loan upon, but the small amount of cotton exports reduced this source of revenue to an insignificant figure. Moreover, since few manufactures existed to tax under an internal revenue system such as the US government adopted, the Confederacy was cut off from deriving any considerable revenue from indirect taxation. The first Confederate tax law levied a direct tax of twenty million dollars, apportioned among the states. These, with the exception of Texas, contributed their <b>apportioned</b> <b>share</b> to the central government by issuing bonds or notes, so that the tax was in reality but a disguised form of loan. Real taxation was postponed until the spring of 1863, when a stringent measure was adopted taxing property and earnings. It was slowly and with difficulty put into effect, and was re-enacted in February 1864. In the states and cities there was a strong tendency to relax or postpone taxation in view of the other demands upon the people.With no revenue from taxation, and with the disastrous effects of the wholesale issue of paper money before it, the Confederate government made every effort to borrow money by issuing bonds. The initial $15 million loan was soon followed by an issue of one hundred million in bonds, which was, however, difficult to place. There followed even larger loans. The bonds rapidly fell in value, and were quoted during the war at approximately the value of the paper money, in which medium they were paid for by subscribers. To avoid this circumstance, a system of produce loans was devised by which the bonds were subscribed for in cotton, tobacco and food products. This policy was subsequently enlarged, and enabled the government to secure at least a part of the armies' food supplies. But the bulk of the subscriptions for these bonds was made in cotton, for which the planters were thus enabled to find a market.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{tests the}} Ricardian Equivalence Concept by {{constructing}} “Ricardian ” time {{series for the}} incomes of U. S. States. “Ricardian ” income is taken to be standard disposable income minus the net increment to state debt plus the State’s <b>apportioned</b> <b>share</b> of Federal Debt. Regressions are then run using “Ricardian ” and, alternatively, “standard ” concepts of disposable income to explain residential electricity consumption in each state. The simplest tests used just real income and relative price as regressors. Later tests added weather and natural-gas-price variables. The “standard ” concepts prove preferable, at high levels of significance in all the tests performed. The {{purpose of this paper}} is threefold: a) to make a further contribution to the already substantial literature on the empirical testing of hypotheses concerning Ricardian Equivalence, b) to demonstrate the value and illustrate some of the subtleties of working with subnational (in this case U. S. State) data, and c) to advertise the existence of a new data set on the public finances of the 50 states, which may be of considerable use to others in our profession. ...|$|E

Sometimes the collective bargaining power of the workers to the employers can not bring the workers much hope for their betterment in the future because of many restrictions in the government rules towards labor. This kind of contract brings an opposition status between the employer and the laborers. The opposition between the worker’s to the company.

60|$|What Kant {{maintained}} {{was that}} in all our experience there are two elements to be distinguished, the one due to the object (i.e. {{to what we have}} called the 'physical object'), the other due to our own nature. We saw, in discussing matter and sense-data, that the physical object is different from the associated sense-data, and that the sense-data are to be regarded as resulting from an interaction between the physical object and ourselves. So far, we are in agreement with Kant. But what is distinctive of Kant {{is the way in which}} he <b>apportions</b> the <b>shares</b> of ourselves and the physical object respectively. He considers that the crude material given in sensation--the colour, hardness, etc.--is due to the object, and that what we supply is the arrangement in space and time, and all the relations between sense-data which result from comparison or from considering one as the cause of the other or in any other way. His chief reason in favour of this view is that we seem to have a priori knowledge as to space and time and causality and comparison, but not as to the actual crude material of sensation. We can be sure, he says, that anything we shall ever experience must show the characteristics affirmed of it in our a priori knowledge, because these characteristics are due to our own nature, and therefore nothing can ever come into our experience without acquiring these characteristics.|$|R

It was on a plain 3,000 feet above {{the level of the}} sea, or rather in a hole on the plain; for it was chosen because the bend of a river encircled it on three sides, so that a stockade on the fourth would serve for defence, in case of an attack from the Ajawa; and this consideration made Livingstone enforce the choice upon the Bishop, who again yielded to his opinion. The higher ground around was not unhealthy; the air was pure, the heat never excessive; but the river was too near, and brought fever to a spot soon overcrowded.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} ways in which {{citizens}} of democratic states are responsible for injustices perpetrated by their governments. The attribution of collective responsibility to citizens is common both in theory and practice. Yet there is relatively little thinking about its nature, scope and sources. The thesis develops in three parts. Part 1 identifies three types of responsibility which are relevant to governmental injustices. These are moral responsibility, liability, and counteractive responsibility (namely the responsibility {{to put an end to}} an ongoing injustice). It examines the attribution of each type of responsibility to individuals and to groups; and {{the ways in}} which the collective responsibilities of groups should be distributed amongst their members. An important distinction is drawn between an equal distribution of collective responsibility, which <b>apportions</b> an equal <b>share</b> to each group member; and a differential distribution, which apportions responsibility in light of group members' contributions to and benefits from collective harms. Part 2 applies these theoretical observations to the case of liberal democracies. It first considers the responsibilities of democratic publics as collective units. It explores the extent to which publics bear collective moral and consequential responsibilities for governmental policies. Such policies are often designed and carried out by relatively autonomous representative governments. The analysis is therefore supported by an account of the different meanings of political representation, and the responsibilities that they involve. The thesis then explores {{the ways in which}} the collective responsibilities of the public are to be shared amongst citizens. My core argument is that civic moral responsibility should be attributed in light of citizens' personal behaviour. But, liability and counteractive responsibility can be apportioned equally amongst citizens. The justification concerns the associative obligations of citizens in liberal democracies. The last part draws upon these conclusions in order to assess the legitimacy and necessity of international economic sanctions against 'unjust liberal democracies'. It argues that liberal democracies form amongst themselves a transnational community, and that consequently they have both the right and the obligation to monitor each other's behaviour, and to impose economic sanctions on liberal democracies that violate core democratic norms.

40|$|A {{main reason}} for {{founding}} the European Union was to remove internal trade obstacles and to establish a Single Market within its borders. Along with the increasing integration of international markets, an ever-increasing diversification of firms {{in tandem with the}} development of multinational enterprises is observable. Legislative authorities of the European Union and its member states are faced with the challenge of ensuring that their corporate tax systems keep pace with this economic transformation of companies and markets. Hence, {{in order to meet the}} requirements of an integrated European market, in 2001 the European Commission proposed a switch from Separate Accounting to Formula Apportionment as the leading corporate income taxation system in the European Union. Basically, corporate income of multinational enterprises can be taxed according to these two different principles. At present Separate Accounting is applied at the international level, while some countries like the U. S., Canada, Germany and Switzerland use Formula Apportionment at the state or federal level. Under the current system of Separate Accounting each subsidiary of a multinational enterprise is treated as a separate entity subject to national tax law. For this reason multinationals have to value their intra-firm trade using internal transfer prices, which should meet an external standard of comparison, so-called arm’s length prices. Because of the very nature of internal trade with firm-specific tangibles and intangibles evaluating adequate transfer prices proved difficult. Consequently, Separate Accounting was identified as one reason for manipulations in favor of profit shifting for tax saving purposes. That is why the European Commission regards the consolidation of profits including cross-border loss offset for calculating a multinational company’s tax base as a more suitable approach in the economic union and advocates the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB). To allocate the consolidated tax base to the taxing countries a splitting mechanism is needed. Hence, the CCCTB proposal includes a system of Formula Apportionment. A formula <b>apportions</b> a <b>share</b> of the overall tax base depending on the multinational enterprise’s geographical economic activity in the respective country. The European Commission favors a common three-factor apportionment formula containing assets, labor and sales to represent the production and consumption side. The European Commission’s proposal has initiated a continuing politico-economic discussion about the efficiency and distributional consequences of the transition to Formula Apportionment in Europe. This doctoral thesis evaluates particular issues within this debate by presenting three theoretical articles to answer specific research questions. The articles are based on the methodological concept of a Nash tax competition model under perfect symmetry, where countries choose their corporate tax rates non-cooperatively. The non-cooperative behavior of one country may impose fiscal externalities on other countries and thereby renders the tax policy inefficient. This dissertation focuses on the derivation, explanation and interpretation of the resulting inefficiencies under Separate Accounting and Formula Apportionment. For this reason it contributes three papers to the theoretical literature of optimal tax policies in a non-cooperative equilibrium of tax rates. The work aims to compare and discuss the alternative policy options. The first article pertains to the public debate about the right taxation principle to apply in Europe. The article investigates the effect of fiscal equalization on the efficiency properties of corporate income tax rates chosen under the taxation principles of Separate Accounting and Formula Apportionment. Fiscal equalization ensures efficiency if the marginal transfer just reflects the fiscal and pecuniary externalities of tax rates. In contrast to previous studies, tax base equalization (Representative Tax System) does not satisfy this condition, but combining tax revenue and private income equalization does, regardless of which taxation principle is implemented. This finding implies that it does not matter whether MNEs are taxed according to Separate Accounting or Formula Apportionment if there is equalization of national income (i. e. private income plus tax revenues). Under Formula Apportionment, tax base equalization is superior to tax revenue equalization if the wage income externality is sufficiently large. Even though the European Union does not have an explicit equalization system, a part of the Unions’s budget is financed by contributions from the member states. The implied income redistribution would indeed not be enough to ensure efficiency of corporate income taxation, since the budget is not an equalization system in the sense of our analysis. But the very existence of income redistribution in Europe might indicate that reforming the member states’ contributions to the budget in a suitable way may politically be easier to achieve than replacing an implemented corporate tax system. The second article refers to the sales factor in the proposed three-factor formula under Formula Apportionment. The incorporation of a sales factor in the formula as well as the assignment of sales at the place of origin or destination are hotly debated issues. The CCCTB Working Group suggested in 2007 the inclusion of sales following the destination principle but also mentioned that “ [...] . most member states experts that would support the inclusion of sales as a factor would prefer sales measured ‘at origin’ ”. With regard to the most recent proposal by the European Commission in 2011, the European Parliament advocated that the sales weight be lowered to 10 %. The Committee of the Internal Market and Consumer Protection even called for the removal of the sales factor. In contrast, from Canada and the United States, the opposite development has been observed, namely the increasing importance of the sales factor. Taking a two-country Nash tax competition model with a sales-only formula and market power, we investigate (i) whether the transition from Separate Accounting to Formula Apportionment mitigates tax competition and improves welfare and (ii) whether tax competition is weakest when sales are measured with the origin principle. The driving force is a negative consumption externality that hampers the positive formula externality present for both the origin and destination principle. The third paper investigates the Commission’s recommendation to implement a transition process to Formula Apportionment. During the change Formula Apportionment should be optional for multinational enterprises. Recent empirical literature proves that profit consolidation reduces multinational enterprises’ involuntary costs for complying with different tax laws, but increases discretionary compliance costs incurred by tax planning activities. That is why the third article considers a two-country model with multinationals that are heterogeneous with respect to their involuntary compliance costs. Additionally, multinational enterprises using the Formula Apportionment system face higher discretionary compliance costs due to restricted tax base manipulation opportunities. Hence, multinational enterprises would prefer to be taxed under Formula Apportionment if and only if under Separate Accounting the involuntary compliance costs exceed the tax advantage due to better profit shifting possibilities. We show that a non-negative threshold value of involuntary compliance costs exists such that multinationals with costs above this level choose Formula Apportionment. We prove in a symmetric setting that starting from a pure Separate Accounting system with national revenue maximization, a transition from Separate Accounting to an optional Formula Apportionment increases the non-cooperative tax rates and national revenues for both countries ending up with the results of pure Formula Apportionment. This is because with identical tax rates the multinational enterprise cannot benefit from the better profit shifting opportunities under Separate Accounting but saves involuntary compliance costs. In our analysis the optional system of tax base consolidation promises an efficiency enhancement for the member countries. Hence, we deliver an additional argument in support of an international agreement on the CCCTB proposal.
