5|$|Contrary to {{the view}} here popularized by Cassius Dio, however, Nerva had in fact little choice with regard to his successor. Faced with a major crisis, he desperately needed {{the support of a}} man who could restore his damaged reputation. The only {{candidate}} with sufficient military experience, consular ancestry, <b>and</b> <b>connections</b> was Trajan. Likewise, Edward Gibbon's assertion that Nerva hereby established a tradition of succession through adoption among the Five Good Emperors has found little support among modern historians.|$|E
5|$|In 18th century France, {{there was}} a {{national}} weight standard, the marc de Paris of 8 ounces. The civil pound of 16 ounces was equivalent to 2 marks, {{and it was also}} used as the apothecaries' pound. With 30.6g, the ounces were considerably heavier than other apothecaries' ounces in Romance countries, but otherwise the French system was not remarkable. Its history <b>and</b> <b>connections</b> to the English and Flemish standards are discussed below under Weight standards named after Troyes.|$|E

5|$|John Alexander Macdonald {{was born}} in Ramshorn parish in Glasgow, Scotland, on 11 January 1815. His father was Hugh Macdonald, an {{unsuccessful}} merchant, who had married John's mother, Helen Shaw, on 21 October 1811. John Alexander Macdonald was the third of five children. After Hugh Macdonald's business ventures left him in debt, the family immigrated to Kingston, in Upper Canada (today the southern and eastern portions of Ontario), in 1820, where there were already a number of Macdonald relatives <b>and</b> <b>connections.</b>|$|E
5|$|Of John and Susannah Sartain's children, Samuel (1830–1906), Henry (1833–1895), William Sartain (1843–1925) and Emily were {{painters}} and engravers, beginning {{a legacy of}} Sartain family artists and printmakers. Sartain sought her father's input on her work throughout her career and benefited from his support <b>and</b> <b>connections.</b> She carried on the mezzatint engraving technique that he taught her. Sartain lived with her parents into adulthood, supporting and caring for them in their later years. In 1886, her parents moved into her living quarters at the Philadelphia School of Design for Women.|$|E
5|$|The episodes, {{written in}} advance {{during the fall}} of 2010, were {{conceived}} to successfully {{bring an end to}} the series. Showrunners Brian Peterson and Kelly Souders attempted to preserve the intended ending envisioned by original series developers Alfred Gough and Miles Millar several years earlier. The episodes featured the return of several former actors, including John Schneider, Aaron Ashmore, Annette O'Toole, Michael McKean (voice only), and Michael Rosenbaum. The episodes also contained several overt references, homages, <b>and</b> <b>connections</b> to previous Superman franchises, such as the 1978 film Superman and the 2006 film Superman Returns.|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} impact of {{stochastic}} noise <b>and</b> <b>connection</b> weight matrices uncertainty on global exponential stability of hybrid BAM neural networks with reaction diffusion terms. Given globally exponentially stable hybrid BAM neural networks with reaction diffusion terms, the question to be addressed here is how much stochastic noise <b>and</b> <b>connection</b> weights matrices uncertainty the neural networks can tolerate while maintaining global exponential stability. The upper threshold of stochastic noise <b>and</b> <b>connection</b> weights matrices uncertainty is defined by using the transcendental equations. We find that the perturbed hybrid BAM neural networks with reaction diffusion terms preserve global exponential stability if the intensity of both stochastic noise <b>and</b> <b>connection</b> weights matrices uncertainty is smaller than the defined upper threshold. A numerical example is also provided to illustrate the theoretical conclusion...|$|R

5|$|Additionally, Karan Soni portrays Dopinder, a {{taxi driver}} who befriends Deadpool, and Jed Rees portrays a {{recruiter}} for Ajax. X-Men co-creator Stan Lee and Deadpool co-creator Rob Liefeld make cameo appearances as a strip club emcee and a patron of Weasel's bar, respectively. Rob Hayter makes a cameo appearance as Bob, Agent of Hydra, a recurring character in the comics alongside Deadpool. The rights for Bob are owned by Marvel Studios, who did not give permission {{for him to be}} used in the film, so his comic history <b>and</b> <b>connections</b> to the organization Hydra are not referenced in the film. He is instead explained as a former special forces operative like Wilson. Wolverine star Hugh Jackman was very supportive of Deadpool, and of it making fun of himself and his character, and is seen in the film via his People's Sexiest Man Alive magazine cover.|$|E
5|$|Anne is visibly upset upon {{learning}} {{that the new}} tenant of Kellynch Hall will be Admiral Croft, who is the brother-in-law of Frederick Wentworth (Ciarán Hinds)—a naval captain she was persuaded to reject in marriage nine years previously because of his lack of prospects <b>and</b> <b>connections.</b> Wentworth is now wealthy from serving in the Wars, and has returned to England, presumably to find a wife. Later, Anne expresses to Lady Russell her unhappiness at her family's current financial predicament, and her past decision to reject the captain's proposal of marriage. Anne visits her other sister Mary (Sophie Thompson), a hypochondriac who has married into a local farming family. Anne patiently listens to the various complaints confided in her by each of the Musgrove family; this includes Mary's husband Charles, sisters-in-law Louisa (Emma Roberts) and Henrietta (Victoria Hamilton), and parents-in-law Mr and Mrs Musgrove (Roger Hammond and Judy Cornwell).|$|E

5|$|Born to {{a wealthy}} family, Workman was {{educated in the}} finest schools {{available}} to women and traveled in Europe. Her marriage to William Hunter Workman cemented these advantages, and, after being introduced to climbing in New Hampshire, Fanny Workman traveled the world with him. They were able to capitalize on their wealth <b>and</b> <b>connections</b> to voyage around Europe, North Africa, and Asia. The couple had two children, but Fanny Workman was not a motherly type; they left their children in schools and with nurses, and Workman saw herself as a New Woman who could equal any man. The Workmans began their travels with bicycle tours of Switzerland, France, Italy, Spain, Algeria and India. They cycled thousands of miles, sleeping wherever they could find shelter. They wrote books about each trip and Fanny frequently commented {{on the state of}} the lives of women that she saw. Their early bicycle tour narratives were better received than their mountaineering books.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his lecture}} series, Blackstone became more {{prominent}} in convocation and other university activities. Oxford and Cambridge {{at the time}} had a strange system of law; due to their unique natures, they had exclusive jurisdiction over both academics and students in a fashion which followed either the common law or their own customs, based on the civil law. With his appointment as assessor (or chief legal officer) of the Chancellor's Court, Blackstone became far {{more involved in the}} university's peculiar legal system, and records show him sitting between eight and ten times a year from 1753 to 1759, mainly dealing with small claims of debt. He also wrote a manual on the Court's practice, and through his position gained a large number of contacts <b>and</b> <b>connections,</b> as well as visibility, which aided his legal career significantly. This period also saw Blackstone write his last known piece of poetry, Friendship: An Ode, in 1756.|$|E

5|$|In 2001, Railtrack {{announced}} that, {{due to its}} {{own financial}} problems, it would not undertake to purchase section2, triggering a second restructuring. The 2002 plan agreed that the two sections would have different owners (Railtrack for section1, LCR for section2) but with common Railtrack management. Following further financial problems at Railtrack, its interest was sold back to LCR, which then sold the operating rights for the completed line to Network Rail, Railtrack's successor. Under this arrangement LCR became the sole owner of both sections of the CTRL and the St Pancras property, as per the original 1996 plan. Amendments were made in 2001 for the new station at Stratford International <b>and</b> <b>connections</b> to the West Coast Main Line.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, The New York Times {{reported}} that Mayor Michael Bloomberg's administration had been considering an extension to Hoboken and to Secaucus Junction in New Jersey, {{where it would}} connect with most New Jersey Transit commuter lines.

If opened, the extension would take the New York City Subway outside the state's borders for the first time.

5|$|In late April {{there were}} reports that Orme had a sore throat. This caused Orme to drift in the betting for the Derby, and La Fleche became the favourite. Orme was {{withdrawn}} from the 2000 Guineas, but returned to doing gentle exercise and it was hoped that he would still {{be able to make the}} Derby. The Duke of Westminster hinted that he had been poisoned. In early May, Orme had still not improved, <b>and</b> <b>connections</b> stated that he had been poisoned with mercury. It was suspected that the culprit may have been a well-known backer of Derby rival La Fleche, with the poison being administered in a lozenge that Orme chewed, blistering his tongue. However, a dentist that removed part of a decayed tooth from Orme suggested that the illness was not due to poisoning, but to the decayed tooth.|$|E
