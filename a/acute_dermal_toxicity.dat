40|$|Acute poisonings from {{chemicals}} and products {{continue to be}} a significant public health problem. Development of the Up-and-Down Procedure for acute oral systemic toxicity testing has reduced the number of animals used by 70 % while continuing to provide accurate classification and labeling for human health hazards. U. S. regulatory agencies also require <b>acute</b> <b>dermal</b> systemic <b>toxicity</b> testing for {{chemicals and}} products to estimate their potential to cause life-threatening or fatal toxicity from skin exposures. The resulting estimated lethal dose (LD 50) values are used for <b>acute</b> <b>dermal</b> exposure hazard classification and labeling in order to protect {{human health and the environment}} during the handling, transport, and use of chemicals. With the objective of reducing the number of animals used for <b>acute</b> <b>dermal</b> systemic <b>toxicity</b> testing while maintaining the protection of human health for <b>acute</b> <b>dermal</b> exposures, NICEATM analyzed acute oral systemic toxicity data to determine its usefulness for assigning <b>acute</b> <b>dermal</b> systemic <b>toxicity</b> hazard categories for a wide range of chemicals. LD 50 values were collected for 427 substances that had both <b>acute</b> oral and <b>dermal</b> data. Using oral data to classify <b>dermal</b> <b>toxicity</b> hazard categories underclassified 30 % (126 / 427) and overclassified 34 % (146 / 427) of the substances using the hazard classification categories in the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals. Underclassification of substances is less protective of public health and would fail to appropriately notify material handlers of chemical hazards while overclassification could desensitize them to such hazards. Therefore, acute oral toxicity data should not be used for classifying <b>dermal</b> <b>toxicity</b> hazards because it would underclassify or overclassify a substantial proportion of substances...|$|R

Also, the <b>acute</b> <b>dermal</b> <b>toxicity</b> of this oil was evaluated on guinea-pigs (Cavia porcellus) using a standard method. Agar dilution method with serial dilution of the oil and the mixtures was used for antidermatophytic tests. The percentage inhibition of the fungal growth at each concentration was determined. The MIC of the essential oil was 80 μg mL - 1 for the tested dermatophytes. That of the 8 : 2 mixture was 20 μg mL - 1, whereas those of the 10 : 1 mixture were 8 and 10 μg mL - 1 for Microsporum gypseum and Trichophyton mentagrophytes, respectively. Compared to the control group, we noted no diarrhoea, no change in treated skin and on the fur appearance. In the contrary, the degree of sensitivity to noise, reaction to pinch, activity (locomotion) and reactivity decreased with increase in the dose. The LD 50 was determined to be 5 g kg - 1 b. wt.

40|$|The general {{aim of this}} PhD {{project was}} to {{investigate}} the integrated use of physicochemical and in vitro data for predicting the toxicological hazard of chemicals in animals. This was achieved in two stages: firstly, by developing two types of model for <b>acute</b> <b>dermal</b> and ocular <b>toxicity</b> - structure-activity relationships (SARs) based on easily calculated physicochemical properties, and prediction models (PMs) based on experimentally derived physicochemical or in vitro data; and secondly, by evaluating the tiered testing approach to hazard classification, in which different classification models (CMs) are applied sequentially before animal testing is conducted. The thesis therefore reports the development and assessment of CMs for skin irritation, skin corrosion and eye irritation, as well as the outcome of simulations in which these models were incorporated into tiered testing strategies for these toxicological endpoints. The results show that the tiered testing approach to hazard classification provides a reliable means of reducing and refining the use of animals, without compromising the ability to classify chemicals. In addition to developing the above-mentioned CMs, regression models for corneal permeability were developed, and the relationship between corneal permeability and eye irritation was investigated. The thesis also describes the development and assessment of a novel statistical method called embedded cluster modelling (ECM), which generates elliptic models of biological activity from embedded data sets. The combined use of this method with the existing method of cluster significance analysis (CSA) is illustrated through the development of SARs for eye irritation potential. Finally, novel applications of the bootstrap resampling method were investigated. In particular, algorithms based on this method are shown to provide a means of assessing: a) the minimal variability associated with the Draize rabbit tests for skin and eye irritation; and b) the variability in Cooper statistics (commonly used to summarise the performance of two-group CMs) that arises from chemical variation...|$|R

40|$|The {{conventional}} {{method for}} the assessment of <b>acute</b> <b>dermal</b> <b>toxicity</b> (OECD Test Guideline 402, 1987) uses death of animals as an endpoint to identify the median lethal dose (LD 50). A new OECD Testing Guideline called the dermal fixed dose procedure (dermal FDP) is being prepared to provide an alternative to Test Guideline 402. In contrast to Test Guideline 402, the dermal FDP does not provide a point estimate of the LD 50, but aims to identify that dose of the substance under investigation that causes clear signs of nonlethal toxicity. This is then used to assign classification according to the new Globally Harmonised System of Classification and Labelling scheme (GHS). The dermal FDP has been validated using statistical modelling rather than by in vivo testing. The statistical modelling approach enables calculation of the probability of each GHS classification and the expected numbers of deaths and animals used in the test for imaginary substances with a range of LD 50 values and dose-response curve slopes. This paper describes the dermal FDP and reports the results from the statistical evaluation. It is shown that the procedure will be completed with considerably less death and suffering than guideline 402, and will classify substances either in the same or a more stringent GHS class than that assigned {{on the basis of the}} LD 50 value...|$|E
40|$|Although the {{predictive}} mathematical model {{did not indicate}} that the chemical can be absorbed through the skin, limited toxicokinetic data [Wester et al. 1992] were identified that provide evidence of the potential of chlordane to be absorbed through the skin following dermal exposure. Evidence was identified from data on <b>acute</b> <b>dermal</b> <b>toxicity</b> in rats [Gaines 1969] and from repeated-dose studies [Frings and O'Tousa 1950], with support from oral toxicity studies [Khasawinah and Grutsch 1989 a, 1989 b], to indicate that chlordane is absorbed through the skin, is systemically available and toxic, and {{has the potential to}} cause neurological and liver effects and decreased survival. Insufficient data were available to adequately evaluate the potential for chlordane to cause direct skin effects or skin sensitization. Therefore, {{on the basis of these}} assessments, chlordane is assigned a composite skin notation of SK: SYS. Table 3 summarizes the skin hazard designations for chlordane previously issued by NIOSH and other organizations. The equivalent dermal designations for chlordane, according to the Globally Harmonized System (GHS) for the Classification and Labelling of Chemicals, is Acute Toxicity Category 4 (Hazard statement: Harmful in contact with the skin) [European Parliament 2008].

40|$|The {{current study}} was {{undertaken}} to assess safety of Pistacia lentiscus fruits fatty oil (PLFO) as a topical traditional remedy. A primary skin and eye irritation tests were conducted with New Zealand white rabbits to determine the potential for PLFO to produce irritation from a single application. In addition, a sub <b>acute</b> <b>dermal</b> <b>toxicity</b> study was performed on 18 NZW rabbits to evaluate possible adverse effect following application of PLFO for 28 days. Based {{on the results of}} the current study, PLFO is classified as slightly irritating to the skin and the eye of rabbits (Primary Irritation Index (P. I. I.) = 1. 037; Ocular Irritation Index (O. I. I.) = 5. 33 at 1 h). In the sub-acute toxicity test, PLFO produced neither mortality nor significant differences in the body and organ weights between control group and treated rabbits. However, a reversible irritant contact dermatitis was observed in the treated areas {{from the end of the}} second week of application until the end of experiment. This local phenomenon was accompanied by a significant skin thickening (P≤ 0. 01) since the 12 th day (ANOVA, F = 11, 07143, P = 0, 00765) which is confirmed with an inflammatory granuloma in histological study. Haematological analysis and blood chemistry values of the 2 groups showed no significant differences in any of the parameters examined. In summary, PLFO is minimally irritating to the eye and skin after a single exposure, but it may cause irritant contact dermatiti...|$|E
