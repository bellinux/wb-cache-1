5|$|Raimi <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> <b>help</b> and {{assistance}} from {{several of his}} friends and past collaborators to make The Evil Dead. Campbell was cast as Ash Williams, the main character. To acquire more actors for the project, Raimi put an ad in The Detroit News. Betsy Baker was one of the actresses who responded, and Ellen Sandweiss, who appeared in Within the Woods, was also cast. The crew consisted almost entirely of Raimi and Campbell's friends and family. The make-up adviser for Within the Woods, Tom Sullivan, was brought on to compose the effects after expressing a positive reaction to working with Raimi.|$|E

40|$|Family {{members are}} {{important}} to the well-being of their relatives with substance use disorders or cooccurring substance use and mental disorders. Many caregivers experience high levels of burden, negatively impacting their capacity to provide support to their ill family member. The Andersen health care utilization model (Andersen 2 ̆ 6 Newman, 1973, 2005) was used to identify the impact of predisposing, enabling, and need factors hypothesized to predict caregivers’ likelihood of <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> <b>help</b> and support with their caregiving role. The sample include 82 women recruited from outpatient or inpatient substance abuse treatment centers and 82 family caregivers nominated by these women. Findings showed that almost half of caregivers were unlikely to <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> <b>help.</b> Multiple regression analysis found that two need variables were statistically significant predictors of caregivers’ likelihood to <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> <b>help.</b> Caregivers who had higher subject burden (worry) and caregivers who provided more assistance with daily living were more likely to <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> <b>help.</b> It is suggested that case managers assess the amount of worried family caregivers’ experience because their worries may provide the motivation to <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> <b>help</b> or to participate in help when it is offered to them...|$|R
5|$|Textile {{manufacture}} {{was important}} to the town during the Middle Ages. Chard is the birthplace of powered flight as in 1848 John Stringfellow first demonstrated that engine-powered flight was possible. Percy and Ernist Petter, who formed Westland Aircraft Works, witnessed some of Stringfellow's demonstrations in Chard and often <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> <b>help</b> {{in the formation of}} Westland's first aircraft development factory on the outskirts of Yeovil. AgustaWestland now holds the Henson and Stringfellow lecture yearly for the RAeS. James Gillingham developed articulated artificial limbs.

5|$|In Cold Blood is {{situated}} in Volgia, a fictional state {{on the east coast}} of the former USSR. After the Soviet Union collapsed, Dmitri Nagarov, chief of intelligence and security, took the opportunity to overthrow existing powers and declared independence. After his coup, Volgia started to invade its neighbors. The Volgian Freedom Fighters (VFF) is a resistance movement that is run by Gregor Kostov. The VFF has learned that the Volgians have acquired some special technology and has informed the Americans. They sent a spy named Kiefer to investigate, but communications were lost while he was investigating a uranium mine. The British were <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> <b>help,</b> and Alpha, the boss of MI6, sends agent John Cord, a long-time friend of Kiefer, to investigate.|$|E
5|$|Helmichis' coup {{ultimately}} {{failed because}} it met strong {{opposition from the}} many Lombards who wanted to continue {{the war against the}} Byzantines and to confront the regicides. Faced with the prospect of going to war at overwhelming odds, Helmichis <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> <b>help</b> from the Byzantines. The praetorian prefect Longinus enabled him to avoid a land route possibly held by hostile forces, by shipping him instead down the Po to Byzantine-held Ravenna, together with his wife, his Lombard and Gepid troops, the royal treasure and Albsuinda. Bognetti believes that Longinus may have planned to make the Lombards weaker by depriving them of any legitimate heir. In addition, because of the ongoing war, it was hard to assemble all the warriors to elect a new king formally. This plan was brought to nothing by the troops stationed in Ticinum, who elected their duke Cleph king, having it in mind to continue Alboin's aggressive policy. In contrast, Wolfram argues that Cleph was elected in Ticinum while Helmichis was still making his bid for the crown in Verona.|$|E
