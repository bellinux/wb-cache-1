50|$|Optically <b>active</b> <b>additive</b> (OAA) is {{an organic}} or {{inorganic}} material which, when {{added to a}} coating, makes that coating react to ultra violet light. This effect enables quick, non-invasive inspection of very large coated areas during the application process allowing the coating inspector to identify and concentrate on defective areas, thus reducing inspection time while assuring the probability of good application and coverage. It works by highlighting holidays and pin-holes, areas of over and under application as well as giving the opportunity for crack detection and identification of early coating deterioration through life. The use of optically active additives or fluorescing additives is specified in US Military Specification MIL-SPEC-23236C. The use of and the inspection technique is described in the SSPC document Technology Up-date 11.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:-The paper {{describes}} {{chemical and}} rheologic properties of solutions of polymer additives and cationic surfactants while they flow though pipes in a laminar and turbulent zone and {{their influence on}} drag reduction. Surface <b>active</b> <b>additives</b> or aqueous solutions of surfactants form rod-like micelles, associated into an intermolecular SIS structure that absorbs the turbulence energy at the passage through a pipe, thus influencing the reduction in pressure drop or drag reduction. The influence of the velocity of aqueous solution of surface <b>active</b> <b>additives</b> is analysed in pipes in the Re number range, where high shear stress leads to a degradation of the surfactant intermolecular SIS structure and the drag reduction effect disappears. The pressure drop and drag reduction rate diagrams as functions of aqueous surfactant solution flow velocity and Re number are based on computer calculations...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{estimation}} of the secondary filler applicability showed that secondary rubble and sand on all indicators satisfy the standard requirements (except the content of dust particles and clay particles) {{and can be used}} as filler for construction works. The content of particles sized less than 0. 16 mm is 8 %, which exceeds the requirements. However, the chemical analysis shows that these particles consist of hydrated and non-hydrated cement particles. The amount of non-hydrated cement, based on cement consumption is about 10 %. Consequently, in the course of cement materials production using the secondary rubble and sand you can either reduce the cement consumption or increase the strength of products while maintaining the cement consumption. In turn, the hydrated cement particles can act as additives - the substrates for crystallization. Thus, the screening is a multimineral <b>active</b> <b>additive</b> to cement-based materials...|$|E

40|$|Biopolymers, such as poly(lactic acid) (PLA), {{have been}} {{proposed}} as environmentally-friendly alternatives in applications such as food packaging. In this work, silver nanoparticles and thymol were used as <b>active</b> <b>additives</b> in PLA matrices, combining the antibacterial activity of silver with the antioxidant performance of thymol. The combined action of both additives influenced PLA thermal degradation in ternary systems. DSC {{results showed that the}} addition of thymol resulted in a clear decrease of the glass transition temperature (Tg) of PLA, suggesting its plasticizing effect in PLA matrices. Slight modifications in mechanical properties of dog-bone bars were also observed after the addition of the active components, especially in the elastic modulus. FESEM analyses showed the good distribution of <b>active</b> <b>additives</b> through the PLA matrix, obtaining homogenous surfaces and highlighting the presence of silver nanoparticles successfully embedded into the bulk matrix. Degradation of these PLA-based nanocomposites with thymol and silver nanoparticles in composting conditions indicated that the inherent biodegradable character of this biopolymer was improved after this modification. The obtained nanocomposites showed suitable properties to be used as biodegradable active-food packaging systems with antioxidant and antimicrobial effects.

40|$|Full scale {{tests with}} crushed {{concrete}} used in sub-bases in roads {{show that the}} material has capacity to reharden, very slowly but also after prolonged periods of time. The rehardening process in crushed concrete aggregate has been analysed with a thermogravimetrie method, comparing the change in chemical composition in the aggregate when set with water, compacted and hardened.

If the mortar is ground together with surface <b>active</b> <b>additive,</b> the material set with water gives compressive strength of 2. 8 MPa in 15 days. This is likely due to increased bonding between the ground cores of sand and cement, allowing further crystallisation of ground material to occur closer and chemically better bonded to silicate surfaces...|$|E

No existing energy storage technology can economically provide the power, cycle life and energy efficiency needed to respond to the costly short-term transients that arise from renewables and other aspects of grid operation. Here we demonstrate a new type of safe, fast, inexpensive, long-life aqueous electrolyte battery, which relies on the insertion of potassium ions into a copper hexacyanoferrate cathode and a novel activated carbon/polypyrrole hybrid anode. The cathode reacts rapidly with very little hysteresis. The hybrid anode uses an electrochemically <b>active</b> <b>additive</b> to tune its potential. This high-rate, high-efficiency cell has a 95 % round-trip energy efficiency when cycled at a 5 C rate, and a 79 % energy efficiency at 50 C.

This paper investigates and compares the nanostructure formation {{on the surface of}} different widely used polymers by means of a roll-to-roll reactive dual magnetron plasma etching process. The etching process induces formation of stochastic nanostructures on the surfaces.
