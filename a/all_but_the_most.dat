Newborn calves are kept close {{by a series of}} vocalizations; larger {{nurseries}} have an ongoing and constant chatter during the daytime hours. When approached by predators, the largest and most robust females may make a stand, using their front legs to kick at their attackers.

5|$|One of the {{innovations}} of the Dewey Decimal system {{was that of}} positioning books on the shelves {{in relation to other}} books on similar topics. When the system was first introduced, most libraries in the US used fixed positioning: each book was assigned a permanent shelf position based on the book's height and date of acquisition. Library stacks were generally closed to <b>all</b> <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> privileged patrons, so shelf browsing was not considered of importance. The use of the Dewey Decimal system increased during the early 20th century as librarians were convinced of the advantages of relative positioning and of open shelf access for patrons.|$|E

5|$|Since Madagascar gained {{independence}} from French colonial rule in 1960, Malagasy cuisine has reflected the island's diverse cultures and historic influences. Throughout the country, rice {{is considered the}} preeminent food and constitutes the main staple of the diet in <b>all</b> <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> arid regions {{of the south and}} west. Accompanying dishes served with rice vary regionally according to availability of ingredients and local cultural norms. Outside the home, Malagasy cuisine is served at simple roadside stalls (gargottes) or sit-down eateries (hotely). Snacks and rice-based meals may also be purchased from ambulatory street vendors. Upscale restaurants offer a wider variety of foreign cuisine and Malagasy dishes bearing French and other outside influences in preparation technique, ingredients and presentation alike.|$|E
5|$|The {{first factor}} {{determining}} optimal defense is risk: {{how likely is}} it that a plant or certain plant parts will be attacked? This is also related to the plant apparency hypothesis, which states that a plant will invest heavily in broadly effective defenses when the plant is easily found by herbivores. Examples of apparent plants that produce generalized protections include long-living trees, shrubs, and perennial grasses. Unapparent plants, such as short-lived plants of early successional stages, on the other hand, preferentially invest in small amounts of qualitative toxins that are effective against <b>all</b> <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> specialized herbivores.|$|E

5|$|Often {{people try}} to avoid or outrun a tornado in a vehicle. Although cars can travel faster than the average tornado, the {{directive}} from the National Weather Service is for house-dwellers {{in the path of}} a tornado to take shelter at home rather than risk an escape by vehicle. This is a result of several factors and statistics. An interior room inside a well-built frame house (especially one with a basement) provides a reasonable degree of protection from <b>all</b> <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> violent tornadoes. Underground or above-ground tornado shelters, as well as extremely strong structures such as bank vaults, offer almost complete protection. Cars, on the other hand, can be heavily damaged by even weak tornadoes, and in violent tornadoes they can be thrown large distances, even into buildings. High-profile vehicles such as buses and tractor trailers are even more vulnerable to high winds.|$|E
5|$|Outside urban areas, the redback is {{more often}} found in drier {{habitats}} ranging from sclerophyll forest to desert, even as harsh as the Simpson Desert. It became much more common in urban areas {{in the early decades}} of the 20th century, and is now found in <b>all</b> <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> inhospitable environments in Australia and its cities. It is particularly common in Brisbane, Perth and Alice Springs. The redback spider is commonly found in close proximity to human residences. Webs are usually built in dry, dark, sheltered sites, such as among rocks, in logs, tree hollows, shrubs, old tyres, sheds, outhouses, empty tins and boxes, children's toys or under rubbish or litter. Letterboxes and the undersurface of toilet seats are common sites. Populations can be controlled by clearing these habitats, squashing the spiders and their egg sacs, and using pesticide in outhouses. The CSIRO Division of Entomology recommends against the use of spider pesticides due to their toxicity, and because redbacks are rapid recolonists anyway.|$|E
5|$|The {{sedentary}} {{habits of}} the bivalves have meant that in general the nervous system is less complex than in most other molluscs. The animals have no brain; the nervous system consists of a nerve network {{and a series of}} paired ganglia. In <b>all</b> <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> primitive bivalves, two cerebropleural ganglia are {{on either side of the}} oesophagus. The cerebral ganglia control the sensory organs, while the pleural ganglia supply nerves to the mantle cavity. The pedal ganglia, which control the foot, are at its base, and the visceral ganglia, which can be quite large in swimming bivalves, are under the posterior adductor muscle. These ganglia are both connected to the cerebropleural ganglia by nerve fibres. Bivalves with long siphons may also have siphonal ganglia to control them.|$|E

5|$|Gebhard's supporter, Adolf von Neuenahr, {{surrounded}} Neuss in March 1586, {{and persuaded}} Ernst's small garrison to capitulate. He refortified and restocked {{the city and}} placed young Friedrich Cloedt in command of a garrison of 1600men, mostly Germans and Dutch soldiers. The town's fortifications were substantial; 100years earlier it had resisted a lengthy siege by Charles the Bold (1433–1477) of Burgundy, and between the fortifications, the natural defenses of rivers, and the garrison, it could withstand <b>all</b> <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> determined assaults. In July 1586, the Duke of Parma approached and surrounded the city; by some irony, Agnes' cousin, Karl von Mansfeld and his troops {{were a part of}} the Spanish force assembled against Neuss. Parma had an impressive force at his command; in addition to Mansfeld's 2000troops, he had another 6000or so foot and Tercios, 2000well-mounted, experienced Italian, Spanish and German soldiers, and some 45cannons, which he distributed on the redoubt across the river and on the heights a short distance from the city walls. According to the protocols of war generally accepted in 1586, Parma requested the capitulation of the city prior to the cannonade. Cloedt declined to capitulate, politely. The next day, being the feast of St. James, and the patron day for the Spanish, the bombardment was not initiated, although mendacious reports circulated in the Spanish camp that the Protestants had roasted two Spanish soldiers alive on the Catholic Holy day, a desecration which fanned their enthusiasm for the impending battle.|$|E
