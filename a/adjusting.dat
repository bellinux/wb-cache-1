40|$|Peptic {{ulcer disease}} (PUD) {{is a common}} disorder, but whether an {{association}} exists between PUD and anthropometric indicators remains controversial. Furthermore, no studies on the association of PUD with anthropometric indices, blood parameters, and nutritional components have been reported. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess associations of anthropometrics, blood parameters, nutritional components, and lifestyle factors with PUD in the Korean population. Data were collected from a nationally representative sample of the South Korean population using the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Logistic regression was used to examine associations of anthropometrics, blood parameters and nutritional components among patients with PUD. Age was the factor most strongly associated with PUD in women (p = < 0. 0001, odds ratio (OR) = 0. 770 [0. 683 - 0. 869]) and men (p = < 0. 0001, OR = 0. 715 [0. 616 - 0. 831]). In both crude and <b>adjusted</b> analyses, PUD was highly associated with weight (<b>adjusted</b> p = 0. 0008, <b>adjusted</b> OR = 1. 251 [95 %CI: 1. 098 - 1. 426]), hip circumference (<b>adjusted</b> p = 0. 005, <b>adjusted</b> OR = 1. 198 [1. 056 - 1. 360]), and body mass index (<b>adjusted</b> p = 0. 0001, <b>adjusted</b> OR = 1. 303 [1. 139 - 1. 490]) in women and hip circumference (<b>adjusted</b> p = 0. 0199, <b>adjusted</b> OR = 1. 217 [1. 031 - 1. 435]) in men. PUD was significantly associated with intake of fiber (<b>adjusted</b> p = 0. 0386, <b>adjusted</b> OR = 1. 157 [1. 008 - 1. 328], vitamin B 2 (<b>adjusted</b> p = 0. 0477, <b>adjusted</b> OR = 1. 155 [1. 001 - 1. 333]), sodium (<b>adjusted</b> p = 0. 0154, <b>adjusted</b> OR = 1. 191 [1. 034 - 1. 372]), calcium (<b>adjusted</b> p = 0. 0079, <b>adjusted</b> OR = 1. 243 [1. 059 - 1. 459]), and ash (<b>adjusted</b> p = 0. 0468, <b>adjusted</b> OR = 1. 152 [1. 002 - 1. 325] in women but not in men. None of the assessed blood parameters were associated with PUD in women, and only triglyceride level was associated with PUD in men (<b>adjusted</b> p = 0. 0169, <b>adjusted</b> OR = 1. 227 [1. 037 - 1. 451]). We found that obesity was associated with PUD in the Korean population; additionally, the association between nutritional components and PUD was greater in women than in men...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectives: The {{objective}} of this post hoc exploratory analysis {{was to examine the}} relationship between age and measures of cortical excitability and inhibition. Methods: Forty-six participants (24 with major depressive disorder and 22 healthy controls) completed MT, SICI, ICF, and CSP testing in a cross-sectional protocol. Of these 46 participants, 33 completed LICI testing. Multiple linear robust regression and Spearman partial correlation coefficient were used {{to examine the relationship between}} age and the TMS measures. Results: In the overall sample of 46 participants, age had a significant negative relationship with motor threshold in both the right (rs = - 0. 49, <b>adjusted</b> p =. 007; β= - 0. 08, <b>adjusted</b> p=. 001) and left (rs = - 0. 42, <b>adjusted</b> p =. 029; β= - 0. 05, <b>adjusted</b> p=. 004) hemispheres. This significant negative relationship of age with motor threshold was also observed in the sample of depressed youth in both the right (rs = - 0. 70, <b>adjusted</b> p =. 002; β= - 0. 09, <b>adjusted</b> p=. 001) and left (rs = - 0. 54, <b>adjusted</b> p =. 034; β= - 0. 05, <b>adjusted</b> p=. 017) hemispheres, but not in healthy controls. In the sample of the 33 participants who completed LICI testing, age had a significant negative relationship with LICI (200 millisecond interval) in both the right (rs = - 0. 48, <b>adjusted</b> p =. 05; β= - 0. 24, <b>adjusted</b> p=. 007) and left (rs = - 0. 64, <b>adjusted</b> p =. 002; β= - 0. 23, <b>adjusted</b> p=. 001) hemispheres. This negative relationship between age and LICI (200 millisecond interval) was also observed in depressed youth in both the right (rs = - 0. 76, <b>adjusted</b> p =. 034; β= - 0. 35, <b>adjusted</b> p=. 004) and left (rs = - 0. 92, <b>adjusted</b> p =. 002; β= - 0. 25, <b>adjusted</b> p=. 001) hemispheres. Conclusion: These findings suggest that younger children have higher motor thresholds. This is more pronounced in depressed youth than healthy controls. LICI inhibition may also increase with age in youth...|$|R

5|$|A {{common theme}} {{throughout}} Zobel's {{work is the}} issue of impedance matching. The obvious approach to filter design is to design directly for the attenuation characteristics desired. With modern computing power, a brute force approach is possible and easy, simply incrementally <b>adjusting</b> each component while recalculating in an iterative process until the desired response is achieved. However, Zobel developed a more indirect line of attack. He realized very early on that mismatched impedances inevitably meant reflections, and reflections meant a loss of signal. Improving the impedance match, conversely, would automatically improve a filter's pass-band response.|$|E
