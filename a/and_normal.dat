5|$|Aspirin {{overdose}} can be acute or chronic. In acute poisoning, {{a single}} large dose is taken; in chronic poisoning, {{higher than normal}} doses are taken {{over a period of}} time.

The diagnosis of poisoning usually involves measurement of plasma salicylate, the active metabolite of aspirin, by automated spectrophotometric methods.
