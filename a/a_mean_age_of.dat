Similar figures apply in the remainder of the Western world. All forms of coronary heart disease are much less-common in the Third World, as its risk factors are much more common in Western and Westernized countries; it could, therefore, be termed a disease of affluence. The adoption of a rich, Westernized diet and subsequent increase of smoking, obesity, and other risk factors has led to an increase in angina and related diseases in countries such as China.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the dentoskeletal changes of {{patients}} with Class II Division 1 malocclusion treated with either the Jasper jumper appliance or the activator-headgear combination, both associated with fixed appliances. Methods: The sample comprised 72 subjects with Class II Division 1 malocclusion divided into 3 groups: group 1 included 25 subjects treated with fixed appliances and the force modules of the Jasper jumper at <b>an</b> initial <b>mean</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> 12. 72 years, group 2 included 25 subjects treated with the activator-headgear combination followed by fixed appliances at <b>an</b> initial <b>mean</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> 11. 07 years, and group 3 included 22 untreated subjects at <b>an</b> initial <b>mean</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> 12. 67 years. Initial cephalometric characteristics and dentoskeletal changes were compared with analysis of variance. Results: Both experimental groups had similar dentoskeletal changes: restrictive effect on the maxilla, clockwise mandibular rotation and a slight increase in anterior face height, retrusion of the maxillary incisors, distalization of the maxillary molars, protrusion of the mandibular incisors, extrusion of the mandibular molars, and significant improvements of the maxillomandibular relationship, overjet, overbite, and the molar relationship.

2500|$|Age {{determination}} of this star shows some variation {{based on the}} method used. Statistically, for stars hosting a debris disk, the luminosity of this star suggests an age of about 20–150 million years. Comparison with stars having similar motion through space gives an age in the range 30–160 million years. Given the star's position on the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram of luminosity versus temperature, it has an estimated age {{in the range of}} 30–1,128 million years. λ Boötis stars like this are generally young, with <b>a</b> <b>mean</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> a billion years. More accurately, asteroseismology also suggests an age of approximately a billion years. [...] However, this is disputed because it would make the planets become brown dwarfs to fit into the cooling models. [...] Brown dwarfs would not be stable in such a configuration. [...] The best accepted value for an age of HR 8799 is 30 million years, consistent with {{being a member of the}} Columba Association co-moving group of stars.|$|E
