6000|$|... "Nor would I {{ask you to}} {{run your}} heads in the same noose wherein mine will swing to-morrow. But keep the hut well in sight. At <b>any</b> hour--any <b>moment</b> <b>now</b> {{there may be a}} call of sauve qui peut. Every man for himself and the {{greatest}} luck to the swiftest runner." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is {{the track}} where the {{lightning}} will go; at <b>any</b> <b>moment,</b> even <b>now</b> whilst we are speaking and searching, a fearful force may be loosed upon us. Run on, dear; {{you know the}} way to where the avenue joins the highroad. If you see any sign of the wire, keep away from it, for God's sake. I shall join you at the gateway." ...|$|R
2500|$|Of {{even greater}} moment {{is the second}} danger. Our air warning system will {{undoubtedly}} always depend upon a combination of radar scanning and visual observation. We give Russia the capability of delivering an air attack against us, yet at <b>any</b> given <b>moment</b> <b>now,</b> {{there may be a}} dozen official unidentified sightings plus many unofficial. At the moment of attack, how will we, on an instant basis, distinguish hardware from phantom?” ...|$|R
60|$|At <b>any</b> <b>moment</b> <b>now</b> a howl {{of terror}} might rip {{the silence and}} bring the {{household}} on the run. And then--the explanations! A second drop of perspiration started out {{in the wake of}} the first.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mrs. Crocker {{is in her}} room, Mr. James. She {{ordered the}} car to be brought round at once. It should be here at <b>any</b> <b>moment</b> <b>now,</b> sir. I think Mrs. Crocker intends to visit the Park before luncheon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you know," [...] she said, [...] "I {{believe that}} Mr. Lessingham, by some means or another, would keep any promise he ever made. I am {{expecting to see}} Dick at <b>any</b> <b>moment</b> <b>now,</b> {{so you can get}} on with your lunch, dear, and not sit looking at the curry with tears in your eyes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yet {{the loss}} of the other two is serious, and I deserve a good scolding for my carelessness," [...] the Scarecrow rejoined, penitently. [...] "For in such an unusual party as this {{accidents}} are liable to happen <b>any</b> <b>moment,</b> and even <b>now</b> we may be approaching a new danger." ...|$|R
6000|$|After sending for the Guides, the brigadier, {{at about}} seven o'clock, interviewed his {{different}} commanding officers, and instructed {{them to be}} prepared to turn out at <b>any</b> <b>moment.</b> Major Deane <b>now</b> reported that the Mad Mullah and his gathering were advancing down the valley, and recommended that the Amandara Pass, four miles away, should be held. General Meiklejohn accordingly issued orders for a movable column, to be formed as follows:-- ...|$|R
60|$|And running {{there under}} the trees, I fell and lost consciousness. What {{happened}} afterward, with one glimmering exception, I {{had to be}} told. Nelson, with his enormous strength, picked me up and dragged me on and aboard the train. When he had got me into a seat, I fought and panted so terribly for air that even with his obtuseness he knew I was in a bad way. And right there, at <b>any</b> <b>moment,</b> I know <b>now,</b> I might have died. I often {{think it is the}} nearest to death I have ever been. I have only Nelson's description of my behaviour to go by.|$|R
60|$|Time, therefore, was {{obviously}} precious. At <b>any</b> <b>moment</b> <b>now,</b> if the rain ceased altogether, the populace--in no way cooled by the drenching--would once more storm {{the hill and}} would discover the fugitive Cæsar in his retreat. Already from afar there came to the lonely pedestrian's ear the roar of a mighty wave composed of many sounds, which, gathering force and fury, was ready to dash itself anew upon the imperial hill.|$|E
60|$|Groaning and sweating, urged {{on by the}} curses {{and even}} the whips of their officers, they toiled {{in a frenzy of}} panic-stricken haste to shift the greater number and the more {{powerful}} of their guns across to the landward side, there to emplace them anew, so that they might be ready to receive the attack which at <b>any</b> <b>moment</b> <b>now</b> might burst upon them from the woods not half a mile away.|$|E
6000|$|I {{deposited}} {{a considerable}} {{sum of money}} with the inspector, to meet current expenses, {{and sat down to}} wait for news. We were expecting the telegrams to begin to arrive at <b>any</b> <b>moment</b> <b>now.</b> Meantime I reread the newspapers and also our descriptive circular, and observed that our twenty-five thousand dollars reward seemed to be offered only to detectives. I said I thought it ought to be offered to anybody who would catch the elephant. The inspector said: ...|$|E
6000|$|Ambrose ran out. The flame was lessening, but {{he could}} see the dark bindings, and the {{blackened}} pages of the books he loved so well. A corner of a page of St. Augustine's Confessions was turned towards him and lay on a singed fragment of Aldonza's embroidered curtain, while a little red flame was licking the spiral folds of the screw, trying, as it were, to gather energy to do more than blacken it. Ambrose could have wept over it at <b>any</b> other <b>moment,</b> but <b>now</b> he could only catch up a brand--it was the leg of his master's carved chair--and run back with it. Lucas ventured to light a lamp, and they could then see the old man's face pale, but calm and still, with his long white beard flowing over his breast. There was no blood, no look of pain, only a set look about the eyes; and Aldonza cried [...] "Oh, father, thou art better! Speak to me! Let Master Lucas lift thee up!" ...|$|R
60|$|In a <b>moment</b> <b>now</b> Armand {{realised}} all {{the harm}} which his recklessness had done, was still {{doing to the}} work of the League. Every one of his actions since his arrival in Paris two days ago had jeopardised a plan or endangered a life: his friendship with de Batz, his connection with Mademoiselle Lange, his visit to her yesterday afternoon, the repetition of it this morning, culminating in that wild run through the streets of Paris, when at <b>any</b> <b>moment</b> a spy lurking round a corner might either have barred his way, or, worse still, have followed him to Blakeney's door. Armand, without a thought of any one save of his beloved, might easily this morning have brought an agent of the Committee of General Security face to face with his chief.|$|R

She's not worth tuppence on it if {{any kind of}} a sea kicks up, and it's ripe for a nor'wester <b>any</b> <b>moment</b> <b>now.</b> The crowd {{abandoned}} her completely. Didn't even dream of auctioning her. Morgan and Raff persuaded them to put her up. They're a co-operative crowd, you know, an organized business corporation, fore and aft, all hands and the cook. They held a meeting and voted to sell." ...|$|E
60|$|The Terrorists were no respecters {{of persons}} or of sex. A domicillary search order, in those days, conferred full powers on those in authority, and Juliette might at <b>any</b> <b>moment</b> <b>now</b> be peremptorily ordered to rise. Through her action {{she had made}} herself one with the Citizen-Deputy; if the case were found under {{the folds of her}} skirts, she would be accused of connivance, or at any rate of the equally grave charge of {{shielding}} a traitor.|$|E
6000|$|... "Let us hurry on, then," [...] {{the slave}} said; [...] "it is but half an hour's walk. But as we may at <b>any</b> <b>moment</b> <b>now</b> meet peasants going to their work, I {{will go on}} ahead; do you follow a hundred yards behind me. If I see any one coming I will lift my hand above my head, and do you at once step aside from the road into the {{vineyard}} or orchard, and lie there until they have passed." ...|$|E

And because I must forget {{all this and}} remember only that my duty is absolutely rigid and inflexible. If I condoned your offence, if I suppressed inquiry, I should be in duty and honour bound to offer my own resignation to his Majesty's Government. And I {{have to think of}} other things besides my personal feelings, when at <b>any</b> <b>moment</b> <b>now</b> the French may be over the Agueda and into Portugal." ...|$|E
60|$|Ann {{felt as if}} she had {{struggled}} to the limit of her endurance. She was not prepared to cope with this unexpected blow. She had not the strength to rally under it. Dully she perceived that her schemes must be dismissed as a failure before they had had a chance of success. Her accomplice must not return to the house to be exposed. She saw that clearly enough. If he came back, he would walk straight into a trap. She rose quickly. She must warn him. She must intercept him before he arrived--and he might arrive at <b>any</b> <b>moment</b> <b>now.</b>|$|E
60|$|He {{drew the}} tray upon the table nearer to him, and ate voraciously, while Carrie grew faint with {{apprehension}} {{as she watched}} him. Urmston, who had taken out a cigar, sat motionless, save that he fumbled with it instead of his watch-chain. The room was once more very still, except for the snapping of the stove and the unpleasant sounds the outlaw made over his meal. Time was flying, and Leland might arrive at <b>any</b> <b>moment</b> <b>now.</b> She feared that the other men were hidden beside the trail through the birch bluff, waiting to waylay him.|$|E

"Ladies and gentlemen," [...] he went on, {{addressing}} the passengers, who were {{gathered in a}} group, talking in low tones and anxiously watching the wall of vapour; which now seemed {{to rise from the}} water's edge and reach far up into the sky, the circle of view extending scarce half a mile in any direction; [...] "I must ask you to go below, at once. The storm may strike us <b>any</b> <b>moment</b> <b>now,</b> and when it does come it will come heavily. I should like the deck perfectly clear, and nothing to disturb my thoughts from the working of the ship." ...|$|E
6000|$|While she busied {{herself with}} her toilet her {{thoughts}} dwelt {{on the one}} all-absorbing theme: Percy was in Boulogne, {{he knew that she}} was here, in prison, he would reach her without fail, in fact he might communicate with her at <b>any</b> <b>moment</b> <b>now,</b> and had without a doubt already evolved a plan of escape for her, more daring and ingenious than any which he had conceived hitherto; therefore, she must be ready, and prepared for any eventuality, she must be strong and eager, in no way despondent, for if he were here, would he not chide her for her want of faith? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will stay}} on, if you please, Dr. Swinburne. It {{is not the}} work, but the suspense, that has upset me. One has been expecting this dreadful battle to begin {{for the last three}} days, and to know that at <b>any</b> <b>moment</b> <b>now</b> 200,000 men may fly at each other, and that {{thousands}} upon thousands may be killed is almost too awful to think about. The silence seems so oppressive, one knows that they are gathering and preparing, and that while all seems so still, we may suddenly hear the roar of the cannon all round. I think when it once begins I shall be myself again. It is the waiting that is so oppressive." ...|$|E
