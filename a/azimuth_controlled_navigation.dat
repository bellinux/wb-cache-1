40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Azimuth</b> <b>controlled</b> {{vertical}} {{hydraulic fracturing}} technology has constructed full scale in situ iron reactive permeable barriers at moderate to significant depth for remediation of groundwater contaminated with chlorinated hydrocarbons and metals. Zero valent iron reactive permeable barriers have been installed to remediate chlorinated solvent contaminated groundwater by abiotic {{degradation of the}} halogenated volatile organic compounds into harmless daughter products. Alternatively iron and other reactive materials {{have been used for}} precipitation, sorption or reduction of various groundwater metal contaminants. The <b>azimuth</b> <b>controlled</b> vertical hydraulic fracturing technology has constructed iron reactive barriers up to nine (9) inches in thickness over hundreds of feet in length and down to depths greater than 120 feet. The injection procedure and gel mixture chemistry ensures the barrier is constructed of near uniform thickness, of high permeability and porosity, with minimal impact on groundwater flow regimes, with minimal site disturbance and optimal iron degradation potential...|$|R
