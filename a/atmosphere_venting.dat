40|$|The {{subject of}} this PhD thesis is the {{development}} of an efficient system that can simultaneously pump and separate a gas-liquid mixture, in particular an oil-air mixture. Two-phase flows are encountered in many applications (petroleum extraction, flow in nuclear power plant pumps, pulp and paper processing, etc.) but this study is mainly focused on lubrication systems of aircraft gas turbine engines. The pump and separator system (PASS) for two-phase flows developed in this PhD thesis aims to perform three functions simultaneously: • Send back the oil to the tank (oil pumping) • Separate the air from the oil (de-aeration) • Separate the oil from the air (de-oiling) and release the sealing air into the <b>atmosphere</b> (<b>venting).</b> Particular care is given to the liquid flow rate lost at the gas outlet of the system. Consequently, it could replace the scavenge pumps and oil-air separators existing in present lubrication systems. This modification provides several advantages: simplification of the lubrication circuit, reduction of oil consumption and {{of the size of the}} lubrication system. This research is divided into three axes: the theoretical study of the important physical mechanisms taking place inside the two-phase flow pump and separator system, the experimental development, tests and optimization of different PASS prototypes, and also the numerical simulations of the two-phase flow inside these prototypes. Although the experiments were the central pillar of this research, the three axes were closely imbricated. The PASS design includes three main components: • An inlet chamber with one or several tangential inlets giving a natural centrifugation to the flow, • An impeller (forced centrifugation) with an axial and a radial part followed by a volute chamber, • A metallic foam that lets pass micron and sub-micron droplets and which is followed by an axial vent port. The centrifugation causes the liquid (oil) to move radially outwards in an annular body (a liquid ring) generating pressure. The thickness of this liquid ring inside the impeller is mainly determined by the pressure coefficient (related to the back-pressure and the rotational speed). When the back-pressure increases, the thickness of the liquid ring increases too. An advantage of the PASS is that it does not impose any relation between the liquid head and the liquid flow rate, contrary to common centrifugal pump. It self-regulates the radial position of the gas-liquid interface to sustain the operating conditions. The de-aeration efficiency mainly depends on the pressure coefficient (for a constant liquid viscosity or temperature) or on the thickness of the liquid ring. The pressure gradient which appears in the liquid rotating in an annular body acts like a dam for the gas phase. Indeed, the gas movement is mainly determined by the pressure field (buoyancy) while the liquid distribution is dominated by centrifugal and Coriolis forces. Buoyancy tends to accumulate the gas phase near low pressure areas (PASS hub, suction side of the blades, clearances between closed impeller and casing). The first oil-air PASS prototype produces high viscous losses due to the high peripheral velocity and liquid viscosity. Therefore, the pumping efficiency is poor compared to common impeller pumps. However, the pumping is not the key function of the PASS and a power consumption below 5 kW is acceptable for the application considered in this work. For applications that require lower power consumptions, a reduction of the rotational speed must be considered. Thus, the rotational speed and the impeller diameter are two major constraints for the PASS design which determine the de-aeration and pumping efficiencies. The impeller diameter also influences the size of passage sections for the air flow. The air velocity must be kept as low as possible because the entrainment of droplets increases when the air velocity rises (drag forces on droplets). Indeed, this large influence of the air flow rate on the oil consumption (de-oiling efficiency) was demonstrated by a theoretical analysis, the experiments and the CFD simulations. The production of droplets in the inlet pipes when the two-phase flow is annular is a key phenomenon regarding the oil consumption. In addition to the air flow rate, other variables also influence the oil consumption: • Air-oil temperature: when the temperature rises, the oil consumption increases because the surface tension and the oil density are reduced. Moreover, as the air density also decreases, the air velocity rises. • Oil flow rate: the oil consumption rises more or less linearly with the oil flow rate. However, the influence of the oil flow rate on the inlet droplet size is uncertain. • Rotational speed: the rotational speed has obviously a strong impact on the oil consumption without metallic foam. However, experiments showed that the metallic foam efficiency is almost independent on the rotational speed. Therefore, the oil consumption with the Retimet foam does not depend on the PASS rotational speed. • Altitude or air density: the oil consumption decreases when the air density is reduced because the drag forces on droplets also decrease. The gas density (altitude) is also supposed to influence the de-aeration efficiency but this could not be tested or simulated in this work (the de-aeration efficiency gets probably better when decreasing the gas density because the buoyancy forces increase). Theory, experiments and numerical simulations also allowed the prediction of performance of the first oil-air prototype for real in-flight operating conditions. Two problems have been identified: the de-aeration efficiency at MTO and cruise ratings and the oil leak throughout the vent in cold start and windmilling. To solve them, some modifications of the lubrication system have been suggested. With these modifications, the oil-air PASS should become very efficient and attractive for engine manufacturers.

To prevent rupturing the thin Invar tank material, pressure is controlled by venting the natural gas evaporate. Natural gas is either released to the <b>atmosphere</b> via <b>vent</b> stacks located above the cargo tanks or compressed and piped to the ship's boilers, which are designed to operate simultaneously on natural gas and fuel oil.|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{the project}} was to remove sulfur from a waste stream of {{hydrogen}} sulfide and carbon dioxide. This was accomplished through a modified form of the Claus process. The Claus process combusts hydrogen sulfide and oxygen to produce a specific level of sulfur dioxide. The Claus reaction then catalytically reacts the two sulfur compounds to form elemental sulfur and water. The elemental sulfur is condensed out of the process to be sold, while the remaining gas is <b>vented</b> to the <b>atmosphere.</b> This <b>vented</b> gas met all EPA laws regarding sulfur emissions limits, and released only 1. 4 kg per day of sulfur compounds. The primary improvements from the standard Claus process were the addition of desiccators {{and the development of a}} heat exchanger network. The desiccators remove water, one of the products of the reaction, in order to improve conversion in the process. The heat exchanger network reduces the reliance on utilities and water usage to maintain desired temperatures.

40|$|Sea floor methane vents and seeps direct methane {{generated}} by microbial and thermal decompositions {{of organic matter}} in sediment into the oceans and <b>atmosphere.</b> Methane <b>vents</b> contribute to ocean acidification, global warming, and providing a long-term (e. g. 500 – 4000 years; Powell et al., 1998) life-sustaining role for unique chemosynthetic biological communities. However, the role methane vents play in both climate change and chemosynthetic life remains controversial primarily {{because we do not}} understand long-term methane flux and the mechanisms that control it ([Milkov et al., 2004], [Shakhova et al., 2010] and [Van Dover, 2000]). Vents are inherently dynamic and flux varies greatly in magnitude and even flow direction over short time periods (hours-to-days), often tidally-driven ([Boles et al., 2001] and [Tryon et al., 1999]). But, it remains unclear if flux changes at vents occur on the order of the life-cycle of various species within chemosynthetic communities (months, years, to decades [Leifer et al., 2004] and [Torres et al., 2001]) and thus impacts their sustainability. Here, using repeat high-resolution 3 D seismic surveys acquired in 2000 and 2008, we demonstrate in 4 D that Hydrate Ridge, a vent off the Oregon coast has undergone significant reduction of methane flow and complete interruption in just the past few years. In the subsurface, below a frozen methane hydrate layer, free gas appears to be migrating toward the vent, but currently there is accumulating gas that is unable to reach the seafloor through the gas hydrate layer. At the same time, abundant authigenic carbonates show that the system has been active for several thousands of years. Thus, it is likely that activity has been intermittent because gas hydrates clog the vertical flow pathways feeding the seafloor vent. Back pressure building in the subsurface will ultimately trigger hydrofracturing that will revive fluid-flow to the seafloor. The nature of this mechanism implies regular recurring flow interruptions and methane flux changes that threaten the viability of chemosynthetic life, but simultaneously and enigmatically sustains it...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{greatest}} puzzles of all time is how did life arise? It has been universally presumed that life arose in a soup rich in carbon compounds, but from where did these organic molecules come? In this article, I will review proposed terrestrial sources of prebiotic organic molecules, such as Miller–Urey synthesis (including how they {{would depend on the}} oxidation state of the <b>atmosphere)</b> and hydrothermal <b>vents</b> and also input from space. While the former is perhaps better known and more commonly taught in school, we now know that comet and asteroid dust deliver tons of organics to the Earth every day, therefore this flux of reduced carbon from space probably also played a role in making the Earth habitable. We will compare and contrast the types and abundances of organics from on and off the Earth given standard assumptions. Perhaps each process provided specific compounds (amino acids, sugars, amphiphiles) that were directly related to the origin or early evolution of life. In any case, whether planetary, nebular or interstellar, we will consider how one might attempt to distinguish between abiotic organic molecules from actual signs of life as part of a robotic search for life in the Solar System...|$|R
30|$|At stage A, {{a cavity}} has {{developed}} within the conduit, {{perhaps because of}} magma withdrawal in the conduit, which {{is controlled by the}} conditions below ground. Swarms of MF earthquakes which are observed in the shallow part of the conduit may be related to instability of the rocks within the vent, perhaps caused by the presence of a cavity; thus, they can be precursors to LF earthquakes. At stage B, larger magnitude LF earthquakes occur, perhaps triggered by many MF earthquakes, leading to the partial subsidence of the rocks in the conduit. In some cases, a small amount of ash smoke is also emitted incidentally, which indicates that seismic amplitudes have no connection with the volume of emitted volcanic ash. Simultaneously, the small volumetric change due to the subsidence is converted to a weak infrasonic pulse, which travels through the <b>atmosphere</b> from the <b>vent</b> to each station. This interpretation is very simple and straightforward, but we believe that it has first-order plausibility. At present, no clear evidence from visual or other observations supports the inference of partial subsidence in the conduit, which may indicate that the subsidence associated with LF earthquakes is too small to be detected by our observations. Precise geodetic observations need to be obtained by instruments such as tiltmeters, which should be deployed in the caldera {{in the vicinity of the}} vent to clarify the mechanism of LF earthquakes and infrasonic waves.|$|R
40|$|For this scenario, {{hydrogen}} is generated {{in a container}} that is eventually stored within a drum or some type of long range storage container. When preparing for long-term storage, the hydrogen container (HC) is placed {{in a plastic bag}} (PB 1). The PB 1 is then placed inside an inner drum (ID). The ID is placed inside a plastic bag (PB 2) which is then placed within an outer drum (OD). One or more ODs are then storage is a large container (LC). Filtered vents or vent holes are located on all the container barriers to prevent pressurization and allow gases to flow {{in and out of the}} HC. The LC is <b>vented</b> to the <b>atmosphere</b> with four <b>vent</b> paths for this example. The source of hydrogen generation for this study is not important. Any source that generates hydrogen in elemental form (i. e., H{sub 2 }) is a candidate for the purposes of this generic evaluation. The released hydrogen accumulates inside the waste packaging. Depending on the permeability of the packaging layers, some of the accumulated hydrogen may diffuse out of the packaging layers and into the space surrounding the drums. Since the drums are confined in the LC, the hydrogen accumulates in the LC as it did inside the drums if venting of the LC does not occur. If accumulation in the LC is allowed without venting, the confinement is eventually breached or the {{hydrogen is}} consumed by reaction with other chemical species. One possible reaction is combustion with oxygen. Such a reaction can be explosive, and from this possibility arises the safety concern...|$|R
