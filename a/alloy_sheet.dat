30|$|Magnesium <b>alloy</b> <b>sheets</b> {{have low}} density, good thermal conductivity, high {{specific}} strength and stiffness, desirable damping properties, and excellent electromagnetic shielding. Therefore they {{are widely used}} in the aviation, aerospace [1], automobile [2], high-speed rail, and electronics industries [3]. Consequently, magnesium <b>alloy</b> <b>sheets</b> have become the most promising non-ferrous metal material {{in the world today}} [4 – 6]. In the rolling process of magnesium <b>alloy</b> <b>sheets,</b> the roll temperature has a large influence on plate quality [7]. When the roll temperature is too low, the edges crack and surface cracking of the plate occurs. When the roll temperature is too high, the roll can become stuck [8, 9]. There is an urgent need to make an important breakthrough in the accurate control of roll temperature.|$|R
40|$|Due {{to their}} low density, high {{specific}} strength, and electromagnetic interference shielding, magnesium <b>alloy</b> <b>sheets</b> are increasingly used in automotive and electronics industries. However, magnesium <b>alloy</b> <b>sheets</b> are usually formed at an elevated temperature due to poor formability at room temperature.

In this study, the warm deep drawing process of AZ 31 sheets is numerically studied by non-isothermal simulation. The difference between the isothermal and non-isothermal simulation results and the progress of warm forming is also discussed.

50|$|The Saunders-Roe SR.N1 ("Saunders-Roe Nautical 1"), {{initially}} {{known as}} the Model A, was the world's first full-sized hovercraft. It was controlled from a small cab placed just forward of the cylindrical center piece set {{into the middle of}} the deck which contained the craft's engine and horizontally mounted fan. For aerodynamic efficiency, the fan and the wall of the center piece had very little clearance, while the exterior wall of the center piece itself was heavily reinforced so that the crew would be protected in the event of a catastrophic engine failure. The core of the vehicle was a rivetted aircraft-grade aluminium <b>alloy</b> <b>sheet</b> buoyancy tank, which had been coated with a thin layer of pure aluminium to protect against corrosion.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{formability}} of the magnesium <b>alloy</b> <b>sheets</b> is poor at {{room temperature}} even though the magnesium <b>alloy</b> <b>sheets</b> are attractive because of their excellent characteristics. Application of pulsating hydroforming is a new and effective method to improve the formability. The effects of the pressure amplitude on the maximum bulging height and minimum wall thickness of the formed parts of AZ 31 B magnesium <b>alloy</b> <b>sheets</b> are examined using finite element simulations. It is shown that the distribution of maximum bugling height and minimum wall thickness is similar for different pressure amplitude A, and a uniform expansion in bulging region is obtained, {{the cause of the}} uniform expansion obtained may be caused by the variation of stress components. The AZ 31 B sheet has an excellent performance in formability when the pressure amplitude and pulsating frequency are properly selected...|$|R
40|$|Aluminum <b>alloy</b> <b>sheets</b> of A 5052 -O were welded {{under various}} welding {{conditions}} using a CW YAG laser with a constant output power of 1500 W.

The heat input was evaluated from the numerical results performed using a thermal FEM analysis and the experimental data of weld bead widths. As for the case where nitrogen gas is used as shielding gas, the heat input becomes greater than that of the case where argon gas is used as shielding gas. In addition, regardless of shielding gas, the heat input increases with the increase of shielding gas flow rate. The welding distortion, the quantity of which is specified by the maximum angular distortion and the maximum deflection along welding line, increases with the increase of heat input...|$|R

50|$|Though {{structurally}} {{similar to}} the Yak-18, the Yak-20 had a welded steel tube fuselage which was skinned with aluminium <b>alloy</b> <b>sheet</b> and fabric, with aluminium alloy wings, skinned in metal back to the single spar, and fabric aft of the spar. Accommodation was side by side under a large blown canopy, which slid open to the rear. The cockpit had dual stick controls, with the pilot sitting on the left. There was a central push-pull throttle, and simple gyro instruments. The engine was the newly developed Ivchenko AI-10 five-cylinder radial. This engine was small and extremely light. It was rated at 80 hp, driving a V-515 controllable-pitch counterweight propeller. Fuel was carried in two 35 liter (7.7 gallon) tanks in the wing roots, ahead of the single spar.|$|E
50|$|The Russian {{standard}} design practice also usually mandated fully shuttered engines {{in order to}} cope with the extreme temperatures. A slightly shorter span was incorporated but many of the other alterations were less evident. The passenger door was moved to {{the right side of the}} fuselage, with a top-opening cargo door on the left side in place of the original passenger door. The structural reinforcement included slightly heavier skins necessitated since the metric skin gauges were not exact duplicates of the American <b>alloy</b> <b>sheet</b> metal. Standard Russian metric hardware was different and the various steel substructures such as engine mounts and landing gear, wheels, and tires were also quite different from the original design. Later modifications allowed the provision of ski landing gear in order to operate in remote and Arctic regions. The first PS-84s began to emerge from the GAZ-84 production line by 1939.|$|E
50|$|The {{rectangular}} {{shape of}} the Do 228's fuselage section and large side-loading doors make it particularly suitable for utility operators, which is a market that Dornier had targeted with the type from the onset. According to Flight International, {{one of the more}} distinguishing features of the Do 228 is the supercritical wing used. The structure of the wing is atypical, consisting of a box formed from four integrally-milled alloy panels, while kevlar is used for the ribs, stringers, trailing edge and fowler flaps, the wing's leading edge is conventional <b>alloy</b> <b>sheet</b> metal. Benefits of this wing over conventional methodology reportedly include a 15% reduction in weight, the elimination of the 12,000 rivets over, and lowering the per aircraft manufacturing workload by roughly 340 man hours. Both the fuselage and tail are of a conventional design, but made use of chemical milling in order to save weight.|$|E
