5|$|All of the high-penetrating (armor-piercing) and hollow-point <b>ammunition</b> is {{classified}} as category A (see above). The alternative to a hollow point <b>ammunition</b> was Federal EFMJ, which has been classified into the arms group A in mid 2009, effectively outlawing it. Therefore, only full metal jacket or soft-nosed semi-jacketed rounds and or just unjacketed bullets (lead only) are allowed. Generally, no <b>ammunition</b> with higher wounding potential is allowed.|$|E
5|$|In {{the midst}} of this drive on Taegu, an <b>ammunition</b> {{shortage}} became critical for the UN forces. Eighth Army on September 10 reduced the ration of 105mm howitzer <b>ammunition</b> from 50 to 25 rounds per howitzer per day, except in cases of emergency. Carbine <b>ammunition</b> was also in critical short supply. The 17th Field Artillery Battalion, with the first 8-inch howitzers to arrive in Korea, could not engage in the battle for lack of <b>ammunition.</b>|$|E

5|$|In {{the midst}} of this drive on Taegu, an <b>ammunition</b> {{shortage}} became critical for the UN forces. The situation was such that United Nations Commander General of the Army Douglas MacArthur on September 9 sent messages urging that two <b>ammunition</b> ships then en route to Yokohama, Japan and Pusan carrying 172,790 rounds of 105-mm. shells, with estimated arrival time September 11, proceed at maximum speed consistent with the safety of the vessels. Eighth Army on September 10 reduced the ration of 105-mm. howitzer <b>ammunition</b> from 50 to 25 rounds per howitzer per day, except in cases of emergency. Carbine <b>ammunition</b> was also in critical short supply.

5|$|In the post-apocalyptic environment, <b>ammunition</b> is a {{rare and}} {{essential}} commodity. Pre-apocalypse, military-grade <b>ammunition</b> is used as currency. Players can avoid consuming all the valuable currency by using lower quality bullets made within the Metros. Due to the scarcity of <b>ammunition,</b> a crucial aspect of gameplay is scavenging. The player can loot corpses and the environment for spare <b>ammunition,</b> as well as weapons and other items. The military-grade <b>ammunition</b> {{can be used to}} purchase other <b>ammunition,</b> weapons, and items within most of the Metro stations. Weapon attachments, such as scopes and silencers, which improve weapon efficiency, can be purchased with these bullets.|$|E

5|$|The most {{critical}} problem, however, was {{a shortage of}} <b>ammunition</b> for the PAVN's tanks and heavy artillery (field artillery and mortars 85mm or larger in caliber). By 1974, PAVN's entire stock of heavy artillery and tank <b>ammunition,</b> including all <b>ammunition</b> held by combat units at forward warehouses, and in the PAVN's strategic reserves, totaled just 100,000 rounds. The <b>ammunition</b> problem was so serious that the PAVN artillery command had to replace the larger weapons {{in a number of}} units with obsolete 76.2mm and 57mm artillery pieces drawn out of storage for which there still was adequate <b>ammunition.</b>|$|E

5|$|A {{shortage}} of 9mm <b>ammunition</b> for the Owen Guns was discovered, apparently because the <b>ammunition</b> {{was in the}} LST {{that had not been}} completely unloaded. An emergency airdrop was requested at 10:30. In Port Moresby, the 1st Air Maintenance Company prepared 30 parachutes, each attached to two boxes containing 2,560 rounds of 9mm <b>ammunition,</b> a total of 153,600 rounds. This was loaded onto three USAAF B-24 Liberator bombers at Wards Airfield that took off at 16:55. They arrived over the Finschhafen area after dark at 19:15, where a drop zone in a Kunai patch was marked by men holding hand torches. Of the 115,000 rounds that were dropped, about 112,000 were recovered.|$|E

5|$|A {{variety of}} weapons are {{available}} including handguns, automatic weapons and shotguns, with various <b>ammunition</b> types also in existence. <b>Ammunition</b> {{is limited in}} the game and weapons must be reloaded, although additional <b>ammunition</b> can be collected. Players can also call out to enemies who will sometimes surrender and can then be captured (put in handcuffs) with their <b>ammunition</b> also collected. There are also civilians in the game who can also be called out to and then rescued by the player. Health bars for enemies, vehicles or friendly subjects that must be protected are also sometimes shown. There are health packs which can be picked up, as well as health stations mounted on walls which can be used. Body armor is also sometimes provided or found in levels. A small heads-up-display features a radar/map with an arrow showing the character's direction, red dots for enemies, green dots for civilians, and yellow stars for objectives. The direction and field of vision of enemies is shown on the radar.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} {{news about}} the stolen <b>ammunition,</b> Colonel Stone prepares his regiment for battle. From their cell, the captives see the outmatched Bengal Lancers deployed to assault Khan's fortress. They manage to escape and ultimately destroy the <b>ammunition</b> tower, and young Stone redeems himself by killing Khan with a dagger. With their <b>ammunition</b> gone and headquarters in ruins {{as a result of}} the battle, the remaining rebels surrender. However, McGregor, who was mainly responsible for the destruction of the <b>ammunition</b> tower, is killed in the assault. To recognize their battlefield bravery and military effort, Forsythe and Lieutenant Stone are awarded the Distinguished Service Order and McGregor posthumously receives the prestigious Victoria Cross, with McGregor's horse awarded the medal on his behalf.|$|E

5|$|An early-war Army {{anti-aircraft}} company (Flugabwehr-Kompanie) {{was organized}} in three platoons {{with a total}} of eighteen Sd.Kfz. 10/4s, twelve with guns and six carrying <b>ammunition.</b> When the four-barrel 2 cm Flakvierling 38 was fielded in 1941 each platoon had four Sd.Kfz. 10/4s towing the guns and another for <b>ammunition.</b> Later these companies were reorganized {{with a total of}} eight Sd.Kfz. 10/4s carrying guns, two towing Flakvierlings and three carrying <b>ammunition.</b> These are just examples of some of the Army organizations which differed depending on the unit and the period. Sd.Kfz. 10/5s were substituted for 10/4s on a one for one basis. Detailed records do not survive for the Luftwaffe light anti-aircraft units, but they appear to have been organized into batteries of nine or twelve guns.|$|E

5|$|Autocannons have an {{automatic}} firing mode, {{similar to that}} of a machine gun. They have mechanisms to automatically load their <b>ammunition,</b> and therefore have a higher rate of fire than artillery, often approaching, or, in the case of rotary autocannons, even surpassing the firing rate of a machine gun. While there is no minimum bore for autocannons, they are generally larger than machine guns, typically 20mm or greater since World War II and are usually capable of using explosive <b>ammunition</b> even if it isn't always used. Machine guns in contrast are usually too small to use explosive <b>ammunition.</b>|$|E
5|$|Between Operations Trident and Python, and the Indian Air Force {{attacks on}} Karachi's fuel and <b>ammunition</b> depots, {{more than fifty}} percent of the total fuel {{requirement}} of the Karachi zone was reported to have been destroyed.

The Pakistan Air Force was also affected by the loss of fuel.|$|E

Due to the added barrel length, the PS90 can achieve a muzzle velocity of up to 777m/s (2,550ft/s) with SS195LF <b>ammunition,</b> or up to 930m/s (3,050ft/s) with third-party <b>ammunition.</b>|$|E

The help of the National Guard was enlisted, and two of the bunkers were destroyed (the third remains to this day). In less than six months, a crew composed entirely of volunteers had completed the mile-long track.|$|R
