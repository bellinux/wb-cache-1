5|$|The {{defeated}} Scots {{appealed to}} Pope Boniface VIII to assert {{a claim of}} overlordship to Scotland in place of the English. His papal bull addressed to King Edward in these terms was firmly rejected on Edward's behalf by the Barons' Letter of 1301. The English managed to subdue the country by other means, however. In 1303, a peace agreement was reached between England and France, effectively breaking up the Franco-Scottish alliance. Robert the Bruce, the grandson of the claimant to the crown in 1291, had sided with the English in the winter of 1301–02. By 1304, most of the other nobles of the country had also pledged their allegiance to Edward, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>year</b> the English also managed to re-take Stirling Castle. A great propaganda victory was achieved in 1305 when Wallace was betrayed by Sir John de Menteith and turned over to the English, who had him taken to London where he was publicly executed. With Scotland largely under English control, Edwardinstalled Englishmen and collaborating Scots to govern the country.|$|E

25|$|He {{signed a}} $120 million seven-year {{extension}} deal after the 2009 {{season in the}} largest contract in Cardinals' history. He averaged 147 games played {{for the first five}} years, but injuries severely hurt his playing time in 2015 <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>year.</b> He posted five 20-homer seasons and four 90-RBI seasons. Holliday produced a cumulative WAR of 24.1 in those eight years. According to Fangraphs, which created a tool to convert WAR to dollars in order to estimate the value of a player, Holliday has been worth $168.6 million since 2010. He was active in the community with many charity appearances. He will turn 37 in mid-January 2017, after playing 13 major league seasons, the first five with the Colorado Rockies, and first half of 2009 with the Oakland Athletics until traded on July 24 to the Cardinals. After what could be his final at-bat with the Cardinals at home on September 30, against the Pittsburgh Pirates, he hit his first ever pinch-hit home run, his 20th of the season, giving him 61 RBIs for the season, in his 980th game with the Cardinals that included six 20-homer seasons. With his 20th home run, Holliday became the sixth Cardinals' player to reach that mark, tying the NL record held by the 1965 Milwaukee Braves, and later 2003 Atlanta Braves. The homer also extended the team's pinch-hit home run major league record, now 17.|$|E

Theatregoers hated the play, showing violent disapproval at the curtain calls and spitting at Coward as he left the theatre.

Birmingham Post said in 2000; [...] "nce upon a time, long before anybody had even heard of Britney, Christina, Jessica or Mandy, Australian singer Kylie Minogue ruled the charts as princess of pop.

[...] She is sometimes referred to as the Goddess of Pop/Pop Goddess. She has also been dubbed a Disco Queen. William Baker, co-author of her book , talking about her song [...] "Better the Devil You Know", commented, [...] "The track transferred well onto the dance-floor and heralded a long reign for Kylie as the new queen of disco... a pop princess." [...] Jon O'Brien from Allmusic reviewed her box-set [...] and stated [...] "Kylie has yet to make that one essential album, and the going-through-the-motions nature of her later releases suggests her time may have passed, but this box set still contains plenty of moments to justify her position as one of the all-time premier pop princesses." [...] In November 2011, on the twenty-fifth anniversary of the ARIA Music Awards, she was inducted by the Australian Recording Industry Association into the ARIA Hall of Fame. Many celebrities have named Minogue as a role model. Many media outlets have said many people, particularly woman, have undergone regular checks for cancer symptoms since her breast cancer diagnosis.
