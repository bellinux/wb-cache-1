40|$|A {{valve control}} is {{described}} having a valve body with an <b>actuator</b> <b>stem</b> and a rotating handle {{connected to the}} <b>actuator</b> <b>stem</b> by a differential drive mechanism which, during uniform movement of the handle in one direction, initially opens the valve at a relatively slow rate and, thereafter, complete the valve movement at a substantially faster rate. A series of stop rings are received about the body in frictional abutting relationship and serially rotated by the handle to uniformly resist handle movement independently {{of the extent of}} handle movement...|$|E
40|$|The {{control of}} systems that exhibit {{backlash}} {{has historically been}} a challenge. In these systems, there are essentially two steady state characteristic response curves separated by a deadband zone. This thesis work is motivated {{by the desire to}} accurately control the position of an <b>actuator</b> <b>stem</b> that reacts to the pressure placed on a corresponding diaphragm, which is critical to the temperature control system in a larger piece of machinery. An accurate system model is developed and a number of control methods are explored. The final control scheme is based on the full characterization of the pressure/position backlash curves and real-time pressure and position measurements. This method achieves steady state position response within 1. 3 % of the actuator's full travel...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Parallel robots have {{important}} benefits where speed, lightness and accuracy are concerned. A peculiar type of parallel robots is called vertical Cable Direct Driven Robot (CDDR). In this {{paper we discuss}} an innovative type of planar parallel 2 -link, 2 -d. o. f. robot which is conceptually similar to CDDRs; in place of using cables, this robot uses Storable Tubular Extendible Member (<b>STEM)</b> <b>actuators,</b> {{one of which is}} also capable to actively rotate. STEMs are lightweight mechanisms used mainly in the space industry. We devise a complete model for the behavior of the robot. The kinematics of robot is defined analytically, whereas the structural model is based on numerical and empirical considerations as well. A working prototype of a <b>STEM</b> <b>actuator</b> is presented. The robot is evaluated via the analysis of force polytopes inside the workspace envelope. This allows us to define some useful indexes: maximum force, maximum admissible weight, out-of-plane stiffness. Results show that the robot outperforms Cable Direct Driven Robots (CDDRs). The robot's workspace reaches above the link anchor points and the system can eliminate configuration singularities. Out-of-plane stiffness is indeed computed to be within an acceptable range...|$|R
50|$|The stem {{serves as}} a {{connector}} from the actuator {{to the inside of}} the valve and transmits this actuation force. Stems are either smooth for actuator controlled valves or threaded for manual valves. The smooth stems are surrounded by packing material to prevent leaking material from the valve. This packing is a wearable material and will have to be replaced during maintenance. With a smooth stem the ends are threaded to allow connection to the plug and the <b>actuator.</b> The <b>stem</b> must not only withstand a large amount of compression force during valve closure, but also have high tensile strength during valve opening. In addition, the stem must be very straight, or have low run out, in order to ensure good valve closure. This minimum run out also minimizes wear of the packing contained in the bonnet, which provides the seal against leakage. The stem may be provided with a shroud over the packing nut to prevent foreign bodies entering the packing material, which would accelerate wear.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{the design and}} development of a sub-surface sample acquisition system for use in micro-penetrators. The system was developed for flight use under NASA's New Millennium Program, Deep Space 2 project. The system goal is to acquire approximately 100 mg of Martian sub-surface soil {{and return it to}} the inside of the micro-penetrator for analysis to determine the presence of water. Various passive and active sampling techniques that were tested during the development cycle are described. After significant testing, a side bore drill mechanism was chosen to be developed for use in the flight penetrators. The design, development, and testing of mechanism element are outlined, with particular emphasis placed on <b>actuator</b> development, drill <b>stem</b> design, impact testing, and mechanism testing in various soil types. The other system elements, a pyrotechnically actuated door mechanism to seal the sample and an impact restraint mechanism, are also described...|$|R
