40|$|Modernity is {{characterized}} by profound changes in all spheres of human life caused by the global transformations on macro and micro levels of social reality. These changes allow us {{to speak about the}} present as the era of civilizational transition in the mode of uncertainty. Therefore, this situation demands qualitative transformations of human adaptive strategies and educational technologies accordingly. The dominant role in the dynamics of pedagogics and <b>andragogy’s</b> landscape belongs to transformative learning. The transformative learning theory is considered as the relevant approach to education of the individual, which is able to become an autonomous communicative actor of the social complexity. The article considers the cognitive technologies of social cohesion development and perspectives of their implementation in the educational dimension. In addition to implementing the principles of inclusion, equity in education, an important factor for improving social cohesion, stability and unity of society is the development of cognitive educational technologies. The key factors and foundations for the cognitive educational technologies are transversal competencies. They create the conditions for civil, public dialogue, non-violent type of communication. These “ 21 st century skills” are extremely important for better human adaptation. One of the aspects and roots of social adaptation is social cohesion. Mutual determinations and connections between social cohesion development and transversal competences have been shown. The perspective direction of further researches is to find a methodological base for the further development of cognitive education technologies and platform for realization of innovative services for educational programs. New educational paradigm offers the concept of human adaptation as cognitive effectiveness and how to reach it through educational technologies. The article includes topics of creative thinking, teambuilding abilities, effective decision-making, engagement in the learning and teaching processes, cognitive skills improvement, social cohesion abilities, et...|$|R

The {{purpose of}} this article is to study how real world {{learning}} was used to engender and enhance sustainability principles and practices with 11 micro-, small- and medium-tourism business enterprises and 101 university tourism students enrolled across three university courses.

The {{purpose of this}} article is to study how real world learning was used to engender and enhance sustainability principles and practices with 11 micro-, small- and medium-tourism business enterprises and 101 university tourism students enrolled across three university courses. Design/methodology/approach ? Action research processes were used to focus curricula on ?education about and for sustainability?. A participatory paradigm informed the action research processes. The key methodology was qualitative. Empirical materials were generated through lived experiences, reflexive team conversations, team journals, reflexive journals and student learning materials. Reflexive conversations and reflective dialogue framed interpretations. Findings ? The action research process found that pedagogies, <b>andragogies</b> and ethnogogies that emphasize social processes of meaning making and sensemaking enhance and engender ?education about sustainability? and ?education for sustainability?, especially when coupled with real world learning as a platform for social and profession-building processes between university students, course teaching staff and industry, in this case, micro-, small- and medium-tourism entrepreneurs. Research limitations/implications ? The qualitative findings of this action research study are specific to the participants involved. Generalizability to other university and business settings and goodness of fit require further study. Practical implications ? Insights are provided with regard to implementing real world learning in university undergraduate and postgraduate courses by partnering with industry and focusing on education for sustainability (EfS). A demonstration of the effectiveness of action research as a tool for changing curricula is provided. Social implications ? Learning is a social process of meaning making. Time for real world social interaction is critical for learning. Partnering with industry complements student learning and facilitates the translation of theory into practice. Originality/value ? EfS is engendered and enhanced when learning-teaching engagements are predicated on real world settings, circumstances and experiences. authorsversionPeer reviewe...|$|R

50|$|Alexander Kapp (1799-1869) was a German {{educator}} and editor, brother of Ernst Kapp. In 1833, originally introduced the term <b>andragogy.</b> <b>Andragogy</b> consists of learning strategies focused on adults. It is often {{interpreted as the}} process of engaging adult learners {{in the structure of}} the learning experience. Later, the term <b>andragogy</b> developed into a theory of adult education by the American educator, Malcolm Knowles. Kapp used <b>andragogy</b> to describe elements of Plato's education theory. <b>Andragogy</b> (andr- meaning 'man') could be contrasted with pedagogy (paid- meaning 'child' and agogos meaning 'leading') (see Davenport 1993: 114) Although Kapp's use of <b>andragogy</b> had some currency, it was disputed, and its use ground to a halt. In 1921, the term reappeared in a report by Rosenstock in which he argued that 'adult education required special teachers, methods and philosophy, and he used the term <b>andragogy</b> to refer collectively to these special requirements' (Nottingham <b>Andragogy</b> Group 1983: v).|$|E
