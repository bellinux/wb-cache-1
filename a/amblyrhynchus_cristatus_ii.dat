40|$|The {{ability to}} {{recognize}} {{and respond to the}} alarm calls of heterospecifics has previously been described only in species with vocal communication. Here we provide evidence that a non-vocal reptile, the Galápagos marine iguana (<b>Amblyrhynchus</b> <b>cristatus),</b> can eavesdrop on the alarm call of the Galápagos mockingbird (Nesomimus parvulus) and respond with anti-predator behaviour. Eavesdropping on complex heterospecific communications demonstrates a remarkable degree of auditory discrimination in a non-vocal species...|$|R
5|$|Cleaning {{symbiosis}} {{is known}} from several groups of animals {{both in the}} sea and on land (see table). Cleaners include fish, shrimps and birds; clients include a much wider range of fish, marine reptiles including turtles and iguanas, octopus, whales, and terrestrial mammals. Cleaning symbioses with reptile clients include fish cleaning the teeth of American crocodiles (Crocodylus acutus), geckos eating mosquitoes on Aldabra giant tortoises (Geochelone gigantea) and scarlet crabs (Grapsus grapsus), and three species of Galapagos finches removing ticks from marine iguanas (<b>Amblyrhynchus</b> <b>cristatus).</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{marine iguana}} (<b>Amblyrhynchus</b> <b>cristatus),</b> {{also known as}} the Galápagos marine iguana, is a species of iguana found only on the Galápagos Islands (Ecuador) that has the ability, unique among modern lizards, to forage in the sea, making it a marine reptile. This iguana feeds almost {{exclusively}} on algae and large males dive to find this food source, while females and smaller males feed during low tide in the intertidal zone. They mainly live in colonies on rocky shores where they warm after visiting the relatively cold water or intertidal zone, but can also be seen in marshes, mangrove and beaches.|$|R
50|$|There is {{a diverse}} range in diets among herbivorous lepidosaurs. The marine iguana, <b>Amblyrhynchus</b> <b>cristatus,</b> feeds {{primarily}} on algae. The spiny-tail lizard (Uromastyx aegyptia), which is {{found throughout the}} deserts of the Middle East, feeds mainly on desert grasses. This lizard likely also eats flowering plants, but due to no rain falling during the study period, the animals were not observed consuming these plants. Other herbivores, such as Ctenosaura pectinata (the spiny-tail iguana), have a mixed diet, with 52% of its diet composed of leaves, 35% flowers, and 2% of fruits. This diet stands in stark contrast with an iguana from the same genus, Ctenosaura similis. This animal’s diet is composed of primarily fruit (73%) and leaves (25%), with no consumption of flowers.|$|R
40|$|We {{observed}} {{a colony of}} marine iguanas (<b>Amblyrhynchus</b> <b>cristatus)</b> on Isla Fernandina, Galápagos, Ecuador, while measuring local micrometeorological and tidal conditions. We found size-related differences in foraging mode, with smaller iguanas feeding intertidally during daytime low tides and larger iguanas feeding subtidally. Despite having greater opportunity, subtidal foragers did not time their foraging bouts or exploit their environment in ways that optimized their period at high body temperature. Instead, the foraging schedule of these iguanas served to maximize their rate of rewarming following emergence from the cool sea. Intertidal feeders, by contrast, showed much greater behavioral flexibility in attempting to exploit their thermal environment. We suggest that size-ordered differences in marine iguana thermoregulatory behavior reflect underlying ontogenetic changes in {{costs and benefits of}} thermoregulation due to differences in predator pressure, quantity of food and electrolytes taken at each feeding, mode of foraging, and agonistic tendencies...|$|R
60|$|The lizards {{are five}} in number; a {{peculiar}} species of gecko, Phyllodactylus galapagensis, and four {{species of the}} American family Iguanidæ. Two of these are distinct species of the genus Tropidurus, the other two being large, and so very distinct as to be classed in peculiar genera. One of these is aquatic and found in all the islands, swimming in the sea at {{some distance from the}} shore and feeding on seaweed; the other is terrestrial, and is confined to the four central islands. These last were originally described as <b>Amblyrhynchus</b> <b>cristatus</b> by Mr. Bell, and A. subcristatus by Gray; they were afterwards placed in two other genera Trachycephalus and Oreocephalus (see Brit. Mus. Catalogue of Lizards), while in a recent paper by Dr. Steindachner, the marine species is again classed as Amblyrhynchus, while the terrestrial form is placed in another genus Conolophus, both genera being peculiar to the Galapagos.|$|R
5|$|The primary food of Galapagos {{sharks are}} benthic bony fishes (including eels, sea bass, flatfish, flatheads, and triggerfish) and octopuses. They also {{occasionally}} take surface-dwelling prey such as mackerel, flyingfish, and squid. As the sharks grow larger, they consume {{increasing numbers of}} elasmobranchs (rays and smaller sharks, including of their own species) and crustaceans, as well as indigestible items such as leaves, coral, rocks, and garbage. At the Galapagos Islands, this species has been observed attacking Galapagos fur seals (Arctocephalus galapagoensis) and sea lions (Zalophus wollebaeki), and marine iguanas (<b>Amblyrhynchus</b> <b>cristatus).</b> While collecting fishes at Clipperton Island, Limbaugh (1963) noted that juvenile Galapagos sharks surrounded the boat, with multiple individuals rushing at virtually anything trailing {{in the water and}} striking the boat bottom, oars, and marker buoys. The sharks were not slowed by rotenone (a fish toxin) or shark repellent, and some followed the boat into water so shallow that their backs were exposed.|$|R
40|$|Although {{the cost}} of mate choice is an {{essential}} component of the evolution and maintenance of sexual selection, the energetic cost of female choice has not previously been assessed directly. Here we report that females can incur high energetic costs as a result of discriminating among potential mates. We used heart rate biologging to quantify energetic expenditure in lek-mating female Galápagos marine iguanas (<b>Amblyrhynchus</b> <b>cristatus).</b> Receptive females spent 78. 9 +/- 23. 2 kJ of energy on mate choice over a 30 -day period, which is equivalent to approximately (3 / 4) of one day's energy budget. Females that spent more time on the territories of high-quality, high-activity males displayed greater energetic expenditure on mate choice, lost more mass, and showed a trend towards producing smaller follicles. Choosy females also appear to face a reduced probability of survival if El Niño conditions occur in the year following breeding. These findings indicate that female choice can carry significant costs, and suggest that the benefits that lek-mating females gain through mating with a preferred male may be higher than previously predicted...|$|R
40|$|Although {{glucocorticoid}} hormones {{are considered}} important physiological regulators for surviving adverse environmental stimuli (stressors), evidence {{for such a}} role is sparse and usually extrapolated from glucocorticoid effects under laboratory, short-term and/or non-emergency conditions. Galapagos marine iguanas (<b>Amblyrhynchus</b> <b>cristatus)</b> provide an excellent model for determining the ultimate func-tion of a glucocorticoid response because susceptibility to starvation induced by El Nifto conditions is essentially their only major natural stressor. In a prospective study, we captured 98 adult male marine iguanas and assessed four major components of their glucocorticoid response: baseline corticosterone titres; corticosterone responses to acute stressors (capture and handling); the maximal capacity to secrete corticosterone (via adrenocorticotropin injection); {{and the ability to}} terminate corticosterone responses (negative feedback). Several months after collecting initial measurements, weak El Nifto conditions affected the Galapagos and 23 iguanas died. The dead iguanas were typified by a reduced efficacy ofnega-tive feedback (i. e. poorer post-stress suppression of corticosterone release) compared with surviving iguanas. We found no prior differences between dead and alive iguanas in baseline corticosterone concen-trations, responses to acute stressors, nor in capacity to respond. These data suggest that a greater ability to terminate a stress response conferred a survival advantage during starvation...|$|R
40|$|Tame behaviour, i. e. low wariness, in {{terrestrial}} island {{species is}} often attributed to low predation pressure. However, we {{know little about}} its physiological control and its flexibility {{in the face of}} predator introductions. Marine iguanas (<b>Amblyrhynchus</b> <b>cristatus)</b> on the Galápagos Islands are a good model to study the physiological correlates of low wariness. They have lived virtually without predation for 5 – 15  Myr until some populations were first confronted with feral cats and dogs some 150 years ago. We tested whether and to what extent marine iguanas can adjust their behaviour and endocrine stress response to novel predation threats. Here, we show that a corticosterone stress response to experimental chasing is absent in naive animals, but is quickly restored with experience. Initially, low wariness also increases with experience, but remains an order of magnitude too low to allow successful escape from introduced predators. Our data suggest that the ability of marine iguanas to cope with predator introductions is limited by narrow reaction norms for behavioural wariness rather than by constraints in the underlying physiological stress system. In general, we predict that island endemics show flexible physiological stress responses but are restricted by narrow behavioural plasticity...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} the direct {{interaction}} between hybridization and speciation-two major contrasting evolutionary processes [...] are poorly understood. We present here the evolutionary history of the Galápagos marine iguana (<b>Amblyrhynchus</b> <b>cristatus)</b> and reveal a case of incipient within [...] island speciation, which is paralleled by between-island hybridization. In-depth genome-wide analyses suggest that Amblyrhynchus diverged from its sister group, the Galápagos land iguanas, around 4. 5 million years ago (Ma), but divergence among extant populations is exceedingly young (less than 50, 000 years). Despite Amblyrhynchus appearing as a single long-branch species phylogenetically, we find strong population structure between islands, and one case of incipient speciation of sister lineages within the same island [...] ostensibly initiated by volcanic events. Hybridization between both lineages is exceedingly rare, yet frequent hybridization with migrants from nearby islands is evident. The contemporary snapshot provided by highly variable markers indicates that speciation events may have occurred throughout the evolutionary history of marine iguanas, though these events are not visible in the deeper phylogenetic trees. We hypothesize that the observed interplay of speciation and hybridization might be a mechanism by which local adaptations, generated by incipient speciation, can be absorbed into a common gene pool, thereby enhancing the evolutionary potential of the species as a whole...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Changes in mate {{selectivity}} {{can significantly}} alter {{the direction and}} strength of sexual selection. When the direct cost of mate search increases selectivity often declines; however, {{little is known about}} how the relative cost of mate search affects investment in mate choice. Here, I investigate whether male and female Galápagos marine iguanas (<b>Amblyrhynchus</b> <b>cristatus)</b> alter their investment in mate choice behaviors when resources are limited and the relative cost of mate search is increased. Moderate resource limitation had little effect on male reproductive behavior: in both years, a similar number of males were territorial, and the mean display rate and copulation success of territorial males did not differ. In contrast, female mate search appeared to be affected by the prevailing environmental conditions. During the reproductive season following a moderate El Niño event, when food availability declined, females were in poorer body condition, assessed fewer territorial males, and mated with a male with lower relative reproductive success. Circulating hormone levels also differed between years: when resource availability was limited, receptive females had higher levels of testosterone and stress-induced cortico-sterone. The frequency and magnitude of climatic fluctua-tions are expected to increase in the future across many regions of the globe. Determining how sexual selection is shaped by changes in resource availability is vital for predicting the impact of climate change...|$|R
40|$|We studied {{patterns}} of genetic diversity within and among 5 populations (318 individuals) of Galápagos marine iguanas (<b>Amblyrhynchus</b> <b>cristatus)</b> {{from the island}} Santa Fé. Populations were separated by distances of 0. 2 to 9. 9 km. We sequenced 1182 base pairs of the mitochondrial control region and screened 13 microsatellite loci for variability. We also added data from 5 populations (397 individuals) sampled on 4 neighboring islands (Santa Cruz, Floreana, Espanola, and San Cristobal). The 5 Santa Fé populations, revealed as genetically distinct from populations on other islands, present relatively low levels of genetic diversity, which are similar for both microsatellite (average observed heterozygosity from 0. 7686 to 0. 7773) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) markers (haplotypic and nucleotide diversity from 0. 587 to 0. 728 and from 0. 00079 to 0. 00293, respectively), and comparable with those observed in similar-sized sampling sites on other islands. There was frequency-based evidence of genetic structure between northern and southern sites on Santa Fé (F st of 0. 0027 – 0. 0115 for microsatellite and 0. 0447 – 0. 2391 for mtDNA), but the 4 southern sites showed little differentiation. Most of the intra-island genetic variation was allocated within rather than between sites. There {{was no evidence of}} sex-biased dispersal or population substructuring due to lek-mating behavior, suggesting that these 2 observed behaviors are not strong enough to leave an evolutionary signal on genetic patterns in this species...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} the proximate environmental cues {{that influence the}} timing of reproduction in the seasonally and synchronously breeding Galápagos marine iguana (<b>Amblyrhynchus</b> <b>cristatus).</b> Marine iguana foraging patterns are {{closely linked to the}} tidal cycle, and they feed exclusively on macroalgae. The Galápagos Islands are characterized by seasonal currents that impact water temperature and ultimately algal abundance, which is known to affect iguana body condition and survival. In our study, marine iguanas preferred Gelidium sp., which had the highest nutritional quality (nitrogen content, carbon content, and C:N ratio) of the three species of macroalgae on which they feed. Nutritional quality in Gelidium changed predictably with increasing sea surface temperature, peaking around the median iguana copulation date. Similarly, foraging behavior changed around the time copulations began. To test if consistent relationships existed among food quality, water temperature, and breeding life history, we used seven years of data from this population and found that breeding occurred earlier in years when the mean December sea surface temperature was warmer. Although iguanas might cue directly on changes in sea surface temperature, given the frequency and intensity of El Niño events in the Galápagos, this hypothesis is unlikely. Rather, our results suggest that marine iguanas may use subtle changes in food quality (particularly energy content) associated with seasonal, but annually variable, changes in water temperature as a cue to initiate breeding. The excess available energy may be used to withstand the costly breeding period, as well as to provision yolk to improve hatchling growth and survival...|$|R
40|$|In this study, a metagenome-based {{analysis}} of the fecal samples from the macrophytic algae-consuming marine iguana (MI; <b>Amblyrhynchus</b> <b>cristatus)</b> and terrestrial biomass-consuming land iguanas (LI; Conolophus spp.) was conducted. Phylogenetic affiliations of the fecal microbiome were more similar between both iguanas than to other mammalian herbivorous hosts. However, functional gene diversities in both MI and LI iguana hosts differed {{in relation to the}} diet, where the MI fecal microbiota had a functional diversity that clustered apart from the other terrestrial-biomass consuming reptilian and mammalian hosts. A further examination of the carbohydrate-degrading genes revealed that several of the prevalent glycosyl hydrolases (GH), glycosyl transferases (GT), carbohydrate binding modules (CBM), and carbohydrate esterases (CE) gene classes were conserved among all examined herbivorous hosts, reiterating the important roles these genes play in the breakdown and metabolism of herbivorous diets. Genes encoding some classes of carbohydrate-degrading families, including GH 2, GH 13, GT 2, GT 4, CBM 50, CBM 48, CE 4, and CE 11, as well as genes associated with sulfur metabolism and dehalogenation, were highly enriched or unique to the MI. In contrast, gene sequences that relate to archaeal methanogenesis were detected only in LI fecal microbiome, and genes coding for GH 13, GH 66, GT 2, GT 4, CBM 50, CBM 13, CE 4, and CE 8 carbohydrate active enzymes were highly abundant in the LI. Bacterial populations were enriched on various carbohydrates substrates (e. g., glucose, arabinose, xylose). The majority of the enriched bacterial populations belong to genera Clostridium spp. and Enterococcus spp. that likely accounted for the high prevalence of GH 13 and GH 2, as well as the GT families (e. g., GT 2, GT 4, GT 28, GT 35, and GT 51) that were ubiquitously present in the fecal microbiota of all herbivorous hosts...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Marine iguanas (<b>Amblyrhynchus</b> <b>cristatus)</b> {{inhabit the}} coastlines of {{large and small}} islands {{throughout}} the Galápagos archipelago, providing a rich system to study the spatial and temporal factors influencing the phylogeographic distribution and population structure of a species. Here, we analyze the microevolution of marine iguanas using the complete mitochondrial control region (CR) as well as 13 microsatellite loci representing more than 1200 individuals from 13 islands. Results CR data show that marine iguanas occupy three general clades: one that is widely distributed across the northern archipelago, and likely spread {{from east to west}} by way of the South Equatorial current, a second that is found mostly on the older eastern and central islands, and a third that is limited to the younger northern and western islands. Generally, the CR haplotype distribution pattern supports the colonization of the archipelago from the older, eastern islands to the younger, western islands. However, there are also signatures of recurrent, historical gene flow between islands after population establishment. Bayesian cluster analysis of microsatellite genotypes indicates the existence of twenty distinct genetic clusters generally following a one-cluster-per-island pattern. However, two well-differentiated clusters were found on the easternmost island of San Cristóbal, while nine distinct and highly intermixed clusters were found on youngest, westernmost islands of Isabela and Fernandina. High mtDNA and microsatellite genetic diversity were observed for populations on Isabela and Fernandina that {{may be the result of}} a recent population expansion and founder events from multiple sources. Conclusions While a past genetic study based on pure F ST analysis suggested that marine iguana populations display high levels of nuclear (but not mitochondrial) gene flow due to male-biased dispersal, the results of our sex-biased dispersal tests and the finding of strong genetic differentiation between islands do not support this view. Therefore, our study is a nice example of how recently developed analytical tools such as Bayesian clustering analysis and DNA sequence-based demographic analyses can overcome potential biases introduced by simply relying on F ST estimates from markers with different inheritance patterns. </p...|$|R
40|$|From 1990 through 1994, fecal {{samples were}} {{collected}} and examined for coccidian parasites from 26 giant land tortoises Geochelone nigra, from 715 lava lizards Tropidurus spp., from 139 land iguanas Conolophus subcristatus, and from 128 marine iguanas <b>Amblyrhynchus</b> <b>cristatus,</b> all of which inhabit various islands in the Galápagos Archipelago. None of the samples from A. cristatus or from C. subcristatus was infected with coccidia. Only 1 of 26 (4 %) G. nigra was infected with a single Eimeria species that we describe here as new. A total of 262 of 715 (37 %) individuals representing 3 species of Tropidurus discharged oocysts of 1 - 3 different coccidian species; these included 2 previously described species Eimeria tropidura and Isospora insularius, and an eimerian that we describe here as new. Additionally, 104 fecal samples from Tropidurus spp. were from 51 animals recaptured in either 2 or 3 yr; 21 had no infections in any year, 15 were infected at least once, 14 were infected in 2 yr, and only 1 was infected during 3 yr. No animal was recaptured and sampled during each of the 4 yr of this study. Of the 262 infected individuals, 30 (12 %) had multiple coccidial infections {{at the time of}} collection (eimerian and isosporan, or 2 eimerians). Where determination of the sexes was possible in the lava lizards, {{there was no difference in}} prevalence rates between males (39 %) and females (41 %). Sporulated oocysts of the new eimerian from Tropidurus are ellipsoidal, 27. 1 x 15. 6 (25 - 31 x 14 - 18) μm, with a polar body, but without a micropyle or oocyst residuum; they contain ellipsoidal sporocysts, 11. 8 x 6. 7 (10 - 14 x 6 - 8) μm, without Stieda, sub-, or parastieda bodies, but with a sporocyst residuum. Sporulated oocysts of the new eimerian from G. nigra are ellipsoidal to ovoidal, 21. 6 x 18. 1 (18 - 25 x 16 - 20) μm, with a large polar body, but without a micropyle or oocyst residuum; they contain ellipsoidal sporocysts 10. 7 x 7. 0 (8 - 12 x 5 - 8) μm, with Stieda body but no sub- or parastieda bodies. Also present is a sporocyst residuum of medium to large granules randomly distributed among the sporocysts...|$|R
40|$|Background Chemical {{signals are}} widely used in the animal kingdom, {{enabling}} communication in various social contexts, including mate selection {{and the establishment of}} dominance. Femoral glands, which produce and release waxy secretions into the environment, are organs of central importance in lizard chemical communication. The Galápagos marine iguana (<b>Amblyrhynchus</b> <b>cristatus)</b> is a squamate reptile with a lek-mating system. Although the lekking behaviour of marine iguanas has been well-studied, their potential for sexual communication via chemical cues has not yet been investigated. Here we describe the diversity of the lipophilic fraction of males’ femoral gland secretions among 11 island populations of marine iguanas, and compare it with the composition of its sister species, the Galápagos land iguana (Conolophus subcristatus). We also conducted behavioural observations in marine iguana territorial males in order to explore the possible function of these substances in the context of male dominance in leks. Methods Femoral secretions were analysed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC–MS), and chromatography with a flame ionisation detector (GC-FID) in order to characterise the lipophilic composition. To understand the potential role of femoral secretions in marine iguana intraspecific communication, territorial males were sampled for their femoral glands and monitored to record their head bob rate—a territorial display behaviour in males—as well as the number of females present in their leks. Results We found that the gland secretions were composed of ten saturated and unsaturated carboxylic acids ranging in chain length between C 16 and C 24, as well as three sterols. Cholesterol was the main compound found. Intriguingly, land iguanas have a higher diversity of lipophilic compounds, with structural group of lipids (i. e. aldehydes) entirely absent in marine iguanas; overall the chemical signals of both species were strongly differentiated. Lipid profiles also differed among populations of marine iguanas from different islands, with some islands demonstrating a high diversity of lipophilic compounds (i. e. full spectra of compounds), and others lacking one or more compounds. Among the compounds most frequently found missing were 11 - and 13 -eicosenoic acids. Gland secretions of males with a better body condition and with a higher dominance status (i. e. those accompanied by females and with higher head bob display) were proportionately richer in C 20 -unsaturated fatty acids (11 -eicosenoic acid). Discussion Land and marine iguanas strongly diverged in their chemical composition of the femoral glands likely due to ecological differences between both species. Despite that marine iguana populations varied in their femoral gland composition that was not related to their genetic structure. Our results indicated that 11 -eicosenoic acid may {{play an important role in}} intraspecific chemical communication in marine iguanas...|$|R
