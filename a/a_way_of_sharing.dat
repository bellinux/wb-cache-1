50|$|Concerns {{have also}} been {{expressed}} about the single mode aspect of the national centralisational proposal which would remove rail safety regulation from the New South Wales and Victorian regulators. Critics argue that the national proposal militates against the contemporary integrated transport directions evident in these larger jurisdictions in recent years. These directions have seen transport safety regulators becoming increasingly multi modal and covering modes such as rail, tram, bus and maritime in the one agency as <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>sharing</b> safety expertise, reducing duplication and minimising opportunities for regulatory capture. The national proposal would reverse this modern trend and create a single rail safety regulator.|$|E
