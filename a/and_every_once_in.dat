60|$|But {{after breakfast}} {{the sun came}} out, and a crowd {{collected}} around the tavern, although the air was chill and the muck deep in the street. Stephen caught glimpses of Mr. Lincoln towering above the knots of country politicians who surrounded him, <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>once</b> <b>in</b> a while a knot would double up with laughter. There was no sign that the senatorial aspirant took the situation seriously; that the coming struggle with his skilful antagonist was weighing him down in the least. Stephen held aloof from the groups, thinking that Mr. Lincoln had forgotten him. He decided to leave for St. Louis on the morning train, and was even pushing toward the tavern entrance with his bag in his hand, when he was met by Mr. Hill.|$|E
60|$|A {{night or}} two after this, Legree {{was sitting in the}} old sitting-room, by the side of a {{flickering}} wood fire, that threw uncertain glances round the room. It was a stormy, windy night, such as raises whole squadrons of nondescript noises in rickety old houses. Windows were rattling, shutters flapping, and wind carousing, rumbling, and tumbling down the chimney, <b>and,</b> <b>every</b> <b>once</b> <b>in</b> a while, puffing out smoke and ashes, as if a legion of spirits were coming after them. Legree had been casting up accounts and reading newspapers for some hours, while Cassy sat in the corner; sullenly looking into the fire. Legree laid down his paper, and seeing an old book lying on the table, which he had noticed Cassy reading, {{the first part of the}} evening, took it up, and began to turn it over. It was one of those collections of stories of bloody murders, ghostly legends, and supernatural visitations, which, coarsely got up and illustrated, have a strange fascination for one who once begins to read them.|$|E
60|$|While thus engaged, an old sailor on a chest {{just under}} me was puffing out volumes of tobacco smoke. My supper finished, he brushed {{the stem of}} his sooty pipe against {{the sleeve of his}} frock, and politely waved it toward me. The {{attention}} was sailor-like; as for the nicety of the thing, no man who has lived in forecastles is at all fastidious; and so, after a few vigorous whiffs to induce repose, I turned over and tried my best to forget myself. But in vain. My crib, instead of extending fore and aft, as it should have done, was placed athwart ships, that is, at right angles to the keel, and the vessel, going before the wind, rolled to such a degree, that-every time my heels went up and my head went down, I thought I was on the point of turning a somerset. Beside this, there were still more annoying causes of inquietude; <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>once</b> <b>in</b> a while a splash of water came down the open scuttle, and flung the spray in my face.|$|E
50|$|Surgical {{excision}} may rarely {{be required}} in skeletally mature patients. In chronic {{cases that are}} refractory to conservative treatment, surgical intervention yields good results, particularly for patients with bony or cartilaginous ossicles. Excision of these ossicles produces resolution of symptoms and return to activity in several weeks. After surgery, {{it is common for}} lack of blood flow to below the knees and to the feet. This may cause the loss of circulation to the area, but will be back to normal again shortly. A high pain may come <b>and</b> go <b>every</b> <b>once</b> <b>in</b> a while, {{due to the lack of}} blood flow. If this happens, sitting down will help the pain decrease. Removal of all loose intratendinous ossicles associated with prominent tibial tubercles is the procedure of choice, both from the functional and the cosmetic point of view.|$|R

A reservoir was constructed in 1910 for the power station at Sivasamudram. In the same year, the Mysore-Hassan railway line was extended linking Saligram and Yedatur with the line at Arsikere.

You know how we used to burn the stumps out; and then {{somebody}} invented a stump-extractor, and we pulled them out with a yoke of oxen. Now they just touch 'em off with a little dynamite, and they've got a cellar dug and filled up with kindling ready for housekeeping whenever you want it. Only they haven't got any use for kindling in that country--all gas.

5000|$|Dorothy Cramp (born O'Neil) (voiced by Nicole Oliver), is the yellow-skinned short-tempered, strict {{mother to}} the twins, and wife of Horace Cramp. She is a {{complete}} germaphobe and neat freak. Her obsession for cleanliness is a major joke in the show. She once raided the twins' rooms and husband's storage to check their cleanliness, which resulted in her kicking {{them out of the}} house due to Wayne's junk, Lucien's mud for his worms, and Horace's Rodeo Rita picture. She is something of a scientist by way of cleaning products, for she often mixes home-made cleaning formulas to seek out the strongest germ-killer, which seems to awaken her twisted desire to clean everything [...] "to the brim". This is described by Horace as having [...] "The Cleanies" [...] <b>and</b> happens <b>every</b> <b>once</b> <b>in</b> a while which results in everyone preparing for shelter because she always desires to test it on them first [...] "for safety".

50|$|Variants 1-6 are {{anti-aircraft}} games, {{in which}} the player uses a stationary anti-aircraft gun that can be positioned at a 30, 60, or 90-degree angle to shoot down four different types of aircraft.

For the music video shooting, Clapton was {{provided}} with clothing, glasses, shoes and styling equipment by his long-time friend, Italian fashion designer Giorgio Armani. In the music video, mostly Clapton is shown singing and playing [...] "Change the World" [...] at the Hoboken Terminal, either using an early signature Martin acoustic guitar, or a vintage model. The song's producer Babyface is rarely seen playing and singing the pop song {{in front of}} the camera. While Clapton and Babyface are performing the song at one of New York metropolitan area's major transportation hubs, the scene is completely empty of both people <b>and</b> obstacles. <b>Every</b> <b>once</b> <b>in</b> a while, the performers and passengers, who come later to the terminal, disappear and appear {{as the director of the}} video uses an obliterate video effect. The video was originally released in 4:3 format and was re-sized in 1999 to a high-definition picture. The music video gained a lot of popularity, especially in the United States, topping the music video streaming chart of VH1 in October 1996. The release also reached number four on MuskVideo's power play chart, and peaked at number nine on the most played videos of MTV compilation as reported by Billboard.|$|R

The parameters such as neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and eosinophil-to-basophil ratio (EBR) in routine blood test (RBT) {{are considered to}} be the underlying biomarkers of inflammation. We hypothesized that the prognosis of patients with COPD can be predicted with RBT. Methods: Patients with COPD in stable stage were enrolled. The RBT, pulmonary function testing (PFT), BODE index, C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were performed at enrollment <b>and</b> <b>every</b> follow-up <b>once</b> <b>in</b> <b>every</b> 3 months during the 24 -month follow-up period. Meanwhile, exacerbation count and mortality incidence were recorded. The correlation between the prognostic biomarkers and the prognosis of patients was analyzed. Results: The NLR and EBR in RBT have a significant correlation with the severity of patients with COPD. The NLR is an independent predictor for mortality and the EBR is an independent predictor for exacerbation. Conclusion: As an inexpensive, accessible, and convenient assay, RBT may be used as a practical means in the prediction of prognosis of patients with COPD in future clinical settings.

60|$|Slone {{was packed}} and saddled {{and on his}} way before the sun reddened the canyon wall. He walked the horses. From time to time he saw signs of Wildfire's {{consistent}} progress. The canyon narrowed and the walls grew lower and the grass increased. There was a decided ascent all the time. Slone could find {{no evidence that the}} canyon had ever been traveled by hunters or Indians. The day was pleasant and warm <b>and</b> still. <b>Every</b> <b>once</b> <b>in</b> a while a little breath of wind would bring a fragrance of cedar and pinyon, and a sweet hint of pine <b>and</b> sage. At <b>every</b> turn he looked ahead, expecting to see the green of pine and the gray of sage. Toward the middle of the afternoon, coming to a place where Wildfire had taken to a trot, he put Nagger to that gait, and by sundown had worked up to where the canyon was only a shallow ravine. And finally it turned once more, to lose itself in a level where straggling pines stood high above the cedars, and great, dark-green silver spruces stood above the pines. And here were patches of sage, fresh and pungent, and long reaches of bleached grass. It was the edge of a forest. Wildfire's trail went on. Slone came at length to a group of pines, and here he found the remains of a camp-fire, and some flint arrow-heads. Indians had been in there, probably having come from the opposite direction to Slone's. This encouraged him, for where Indians could hunt so could he. Soon he was entering a forest where cedars and pinyons and pines began to grow thickly. Presently he came upon a faintly defined trail, just a dim, dark line even to an experienced eye. But it was a trail, and Wildfire had taken it.|$|R

[...] In the video, it is presumed that Lewis and Crawford have stolen a large amount of money, as it opens with dialogue between the pair and how they are going to try and arrange to meet each other at a later date, due to the police closing in on them. As the song begins to play, Lewis sings the first verse on the car bonnet in which they were shown sitting in previously. As she sings the first chorus, she stands up and faces Crawford in the car, and begins to walk away in a car park as she sings the second verse. For the second chorus, Lewis is shown to evade the police by trying to escape by car park stairways, but is confronted by policemen in most directions she goes. For the final chorus, Lewis makes it out onto the road and runs from the police in their cars, but is ultimately blocked from escape in all directions as they close in on her, arrest her, and place her {{in the back of a}} police car. People ranked the video as one of the most anticipated videos to be released in January 2009.|$|R
40|$|At {{the apex}} of the human kind and our ability to {{strengthen}} our own resources lies our ability to educate and further develop our own people. As the future development requires more and more knowledge and use of technology, new tools such as the internet must be used to further our world’s evolution. The world of video games {{is only one of many}} areas that must be explored and exploited for the best possible gain for humanity. Very little is known about how to use video games to enhance our learning and this paper means to shed some light upon the media in a more formal learning context than the living room hobby reputation it has developed over the years. In order to get a broad and diverse perspective both computer game developers and teachers were interviewed. The results show that while there are a large number of positive aspects and effects closely related to video games, they are not always suitable to be used independently and may fit better into a blended environment of both more traditional ways to study and computer game experiences. Something new <b>and</b> extraordinary <b>every</b> <b>once</b> <b>in</b> a while was shown to have great effect. A lot of opinions arose regarding strategies to utilize the media of computer games to our advantage but one thing was very clear throughout, the teachers and even to some extent, students of our world are simply not fully prepared to embrace this new form of knowledge. Thus, in order to be able to utilize its full potential, we must strive to improve our knowledge on how entertaining games and pedagogic theory blend together. This in order to create a new, creative, motivational and inspiring way to learn that will last for decades...|$|R
