5|$|For a fully {{secret trust}} to be valid, therefore, it must be proved that there was intention, that this was communicated to the trustee, and that the trustee {{accepted}} his obligations.

5|$|Because {{bulk cargo}} is so {{difficult}} to discharge, bulkers {{spend more time in}} port than other ships. A study of mini-bulkers found that it takes, on average, twice as much time to unload a ship <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>to</b> load it. A mini-bulker spends 55hours at a time in port, compared to 35hours for a lumber carrier of similar size. This time in port increases to 74hours for Handymax and 120hours for Panamax vessels. Compared with the 12-hour turnarounds common for container ships, 15-hour turnarounds for car carriers, and 26-hour turnarounds for large tankers, bulker crews have more opportunities to spend time ashore.|$|E

The book is written with a first-person perspective: the reader learns of the author's morning ritual, {{the fact that his}} cat is named Francie and that he married a woman he met through a Bulletin Board System. Godwin's motivation was to keep the Internet safe from government actions that restrict freedom of speech.

5|$|Malaysia {{rejected}} Singapore's {{argument that}} the traditional Malay concept of sovereignty was based mainly on control over people and not over territory. It stated that authority in states throughout the world {{is based on a}} combination of control over people and territory, and that this applies to the Malay States <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>to</b> any other state. Since the Johor Sultanate was established in the 16th century, it always had rulers who were recognised as such and who thus commanded people's allegiance and therefore controlled the territory where those people lived.|$|E
5|$|Flights from Earth {{to other}} planets in the Solar System {{have a high}} energy cost. It {{requires}} almost {{the same amount of}} energy for a spacecraft to reach Jupiter from Earth's orbit <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>to</b> lift it into orbit in the first place. In astrodynamics, this energy expenditure is defined by the net change in the spacecraft's velocity, or delta-v. The energy needed to reach Jupiter from an Earth orbit requires a delta-v of about 9km/s, compared to the 9.0–9.5km/s to reach a low Earth orbit from the ground. Gravity assists through planetary flybys (such as by Earth or Venus) can be used to reduce the energetic requirement (i.e. the fuel) at launch, at the cost of a significantly longer flight duration to reach a target such as Jupiter when compared to the direct trajectory. Ion thrusters capable of a delta-v of more than 10 kilometers/s were used on the Dawn spacecraft. This is more than enough delta-v to do a Jupiter fly-by mission from a solar orbit of the same radius as that of Earth without gravity assist.|$|E

5|$|The {{concept of}} duality applies {{as well to}} {{infinite}} graphs embedded in the plane <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>to</b> finite graphs. However, care is needed to avoid topological complications such as points of the plane that are neither part of an open region disjoint from the graph nor part of an edge or vertex of the graph. When all faces are bounded regions surrounded by a cycle of the graph, an infinite planar graph embedding can also {{be viewed as a}} tessellation of the plane, a covering of the plane by closed disks (the tiles of the tessellation) whose interiors (the faces of the embedding) are disjoint open disks. Planar duality gives rise to the notion of a dual tessellation, a tessellation formed by placing a vertex at the center of each tile and connecting the centers of adjacent tiles.|$|E

25|$|The body {{responds}} to postoperative wounds {{in the same}} manner <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>to</b> tissue damage acquired in other circumstances. The inflammatory response is designed to create homeostasis. This first step is called the inflammatory stage. The next stage and wound healing is the infiltration of leukocytes and release of cytokines into the tissue. The inflammatory response and the infiltration of leukocytes occur simultaneously. The final stage of postoperative wound healing is called remodeling. Remodeling restores the structure of the tissue and that tissues ability to regain its function.|$|E

500|$|For instance, while {{traveling}} in a moving vehicle at a [...] velocity, {{the laws of}} physics do not change {{as a result of its}} motion. If a person riding within the vehicle throws a ball straight up, that person will observe it rise vertically and fall vertically and not have to apply a force in the direction the vehicle is moving. Another person, observing the moving vehicle pass by, would observe the ball follow a curving parabolic path in the same direction as the motion of the vehicle. It is the inertia of the ball associated with its constant velocity in the direction of the vehicle's motion that ensures the ball continues to move forward even as it is thrown up and falls back down. From the perspective of the person in the car, the vehicle and everything inside of it is at rest: It is the outside world that is moving with a constant speed in the opposite direction of the vehicle. Since there is no experiment that can distinguish whether it is the vehicle that is at rest or the outside world that is at rest, the two situations are considered to be physically indistinguishable. Inertia therefore applies equally well to constant velocity motion <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>to</b> rest.|$|E
500|$|URBs Dan Vidal {{called the}} album [...] "a {{spectrum}} of sound — packed and arranged perfectly into a masterfully composed (debut) full-length body of work... genre-defying masterpiece". Comparing it to singer Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814 (1989), Brentin Mock of The Atlantic called The ArchAndroid [...] "a smothered funk, though perhaps at times too thick, too inaccessible, {{but not so}} much I didn't want to shake my ass" [...] and viewed it as musically progressive, stating [...] "Monáe has given pop music its first Toni Morrison moment, where fantasy, funk, and the ancestors come together for an experience that evolves one's soul... You really don't know whether you want to diagram it, dance to it, or just be dumbstruck. It owes as much to Parliament-Funkadelic <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>to</b> Samuel R. Delany and Octavia E. Butler. She is finally doing what a number of artists—particularly black artists—have not been able to do in years, and that's move pop music forward".

500|$|The use of Viking {{themes and}} imagery in hard rock and heavy metal music predates {{the advent of}} Viking metal. For instance, the lyrics to Led Zeppelin's [...] "Immigrant Song" [...] (1970) and [...] "No Quarter" [...] (1973) feature allusions to Viking voyages, violence, and exploration. The Swedish band Heavy Load often wrote Viking-themed songs, such as the 1978 song [...] "Son of the Northern Light", and Eduardo Rivadavia of AllMusic claims that the 1983 song [...] "Stronger than Evil" [...] {{establishes}} a case for Heavy Load as the first Viking metal group. Swedish neoclassical metal guitarist Yngwie Malmsteen sometimes featured themes of hyper-masculinity, heroic warriors, and Vikings; for example, on his 1985 album Marching Out. The German band Grave Digger and American band Manowar, both of which formed in 1980, drew upon Norse myth as envisioned in Richard Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen. Faithful Breath – which wore fur and horned helmet costumes – and TNT also experimented with Viking themes. Manowar adopted Viking imagery much more heavily than other bands, and {{became known as the}} [...] "champions of the furry loincloth"; they met with ridicule even within the metal community, but attracted a cult following. Unlike the later Viking metal bands, Manowar did not bother with the historicity of popular Viking image, and did not in any way identify with the Vikings, religiously or racially. Trafford and Pluskowski explain that [...] "the Manowar version of the Vikings owes as much to Conan the Barbarian <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>to</b> history, saga, or Edda: What matters to Manowar is untamed masculinity, and the Vikings are for them merely the archetypal barbarian males." ...|$|E
