5|$|In 1853, Paʻaʻāina {{fell ill}} and after much {{suffering}} from <b>a</b> <b>lingering</b> illness, died at Princess Victoria Kamāmalu's residence in May 28, 1853 of scrofulous complaints. Her funeral was held {{the next day}} at the residence of her hānai father John Papa ʻĪʻī.|$|E
5|$|It was {{the first}} time the court had {{considered}} an entrapment case from outside the realm of controlled-substance enforcement, or one involving conduct that had only recently been criminalized. By relying exclusively on whether the defendant had a predisposition to commit the crime, the court appeared to have finally resolved <b>a</b> <b>lingering</b> issue in its previous decisions on the subject.|$|E

5|$|Following the 2006 edition, Dick Clark Productions {{announced}} that Seacrest {{had agreed to}} remain a host for future editions of New Year's Rockin' Eve. As he was still afflicted with speech impediments that resulted from dysarthria, <b>a</b> <b>lingering</b> effect of his stroke, Clark's role in the special was reduced; he continued to make limited on-air appearances from Times Square Studios as co-host near midnight, and still conducted his traditional countdown, but Seacrest hosted {{the majority of the}} program outside in Times Square itself.|$|E
5|$|He {{restarted}} {{competition at}} the Vuelta a España, aiming to regain his form for the world championships. <b>A</b> <b>lingering</b> stomach ailment forced him to abandon the race on stage 3, ruling him out of competition for {{the world championships in}} Richmond. On 11 November 2015, having suffered a season rife with serious injuries and illness, Cancellara announced that he would retire {{at the end of the}} 2016 season.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Arnold Palmer {{took over}} as the honorary starter. Palmer also had the honor in 2008 and 2009. At the 2010 and 2011 Masters Tournaments, Jack Nicklaus joined Palmer as an honorary co-starter for the event. In 2012, Gary Player joined them. Palmer {{announced}} in March 2016 that <b>a</b> <b>lingering</b> shoulder issue would prevent him from partaking in the 2016 tee shot. Palmer was still in attendance for the ceremony.|$|E

5|$|On March 12, Morgan {{scored a}} hat-trick against Rodez to lead Lyon to a 6–0 win and {{advance to the}} semi-finals of the French Cup. She scored four goals and {{recorded}} two assists during the semifinal against Hénin-Beaumont (three of the four occurred within a ten-minute span). Lyon won the Cup after a penalty shootout on May 19. Morgan did not play during the French Cup final due to <b>a</b> <b>lingering</b> hamstring injury suffered during a match against Paris Saint-Germain.|$|E
5|$|Teller left Hungary in 1926, {{partly due}} to the discriminatory numerus clausus rule under Miklós Horthy's regime. The {{political}} climate and revolutions in Hungary during his youth instilled <b>a</b> <b>lingering</b> animosity for both Communism and Fascism in Teller. When he was a young student, his right foot was severed in a streetcar accident in Munich, requiring him to wear a prosthetic foot, and leaving him with a lifelong limp. Werner Heisenberg said that it was the hardiness of Teller's spirit, rather than stoicism, that allowed him to cope so well with the accident.|$|E
5|$|There were fears Iginla {{would again}} hold out after his {{contract}} expired following the season. They were unfounded, however, as {{he signed a}} two-year, $13 million deal before the season and was looked on to again lead the Flames offensively. Iginla fell back to 67points in 2002–03 as injuries, including <b>a</b> <b>lingering</b> finger dislocation following a fight, diminished his play. His 35 goals were still enough to lead the Flames {{for the fourth time}} in five seasons. Despite his offensive contributions, the Flames missed the playoffs.|$|E

5|$|Following his {{discharge}} from the military, Day returned to the Eagles in time for Opening Day on May 5, 1946. He threw a no-hitter against the Philadelphia Stars, despite his absence, in a 2–0 victory, allowing just three base runners via a walk and two errors charged to his teammates. Hampered by <b>a</b> <b>lingering</b> arm injury, Day nonetheless lead the league that season in wins, strikeouts, and complete games. That same year, in the Negro League World Series, he pitched in two games as the Eagles edged the Monarchs in seven games, winning the championship. He played his final season in the Negro leagues in 1949 with the Baltimore Elite Giants. Recordkeeping was poor during Day's career; partial statistics credit him with a 67–29 record, but league historians claim he won as many as 300 games.|$|E
5|$|On 14 October, {{following}} his exclusion from {{the starting lineup}} of a match against Toronto FC by manager Mauro Biello, Drogba refused {{to play for the}} team that night, removing his name from the squad. With both his fitness, due to <b>a</b> <b>lingering</b> back injury, and his role in the team in question, Drogba did not travel with the team to, although he was in attendance at, their first postseason match at D.C. United, a 4–2 victory on 27 October. Drogba did not nearly experience the same level of success in his second regular season compared to the first, scoring only 10 goals while appearing in only 22 games.|$|E
5|$|One of Grant's actions {{during the}} siege was to settle <b>a</b> <b>lingering</b> rivalry. On May 30, General McClernand wrote a self-adulatory note to his troops, {{claiming}} {{much of the credit}} for the soon-to-be victory. Grant had been waiting six months for him to slip, ever since they clashed early in the campaign, around the Battle of Arkansas Post. He had received permission to relieve McClernand in January 1863 but waited for an unequivocal provocation. Grant finally relieved McClernand on June 18. He so diligently prepared his action that McClernand was left without recourse. McClernand's XIII Corps was turned over to Maj. Gen. Edward Ord, recovered from a wound sustained at Hatchie's Bridge. In May 1864, McClernand was restored to a command in remote Texas.|$|E

5|$|Postwar {{social unrest}} was {{also related to}} the {{difficulties}} of absorbing the veterans {{from the war in}} the job market. Competition among groups for work heightened tensions. In the 1920s there was growing anti-Semitism in the United States related to economic competition and the fears of social change from decades of changed immigration, <b>a</b> <b>lingering</b> anti-German sentiment left over from World War I, and anti-black violence erupted in numerous locations as well. In this period African Americans were leaving the South by the tens of thousands, to escape oppressive social conditions and find work in the North and Midwestern industrial cities, in what came to be called the Great Migration.|$|E
5|$|With the {{disintegration}} of the Vijayanagara Empire in the late 16th and early 17th centuries, the centres of Kannada literature moved to the courts of the emerging independent kingdoms, the Kingdom of Mysore and the Keladi Nayakas. Writers in these courts, many of whom were Veerashaiva by faith, were not only adept in Kannada but often also in Sanskrit and/or Telugu. Two such writers were Kalale Nanjaraja and Kempe Gowda, the founder of Bangalore. This multi-linguality was perhaps <b>a</b> <b>lingering</b> legacy of the cosmopolitan Vijayanagara literary culture and the emerging social responsibilities of the Veerashaiva monastic order which no longer confined itself to a Kannada only audience, but rather sought to spread its influence across southern India.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>lingering</b> {{controversy}} {{exists in}} ichthyology over {{the validity of}} the four species Beebe described on the basis of visual descriptions only, which he had observed during his Bathysphere dives. The naming of a new species ordinarily requires obtaining and analyzing a type specimen, something which was obviously impossible from inside the Bathysphere. Some of Beebe's critics claimed that these fish were illusions resulting from condensation on the Bathysphere's window, or even that Beebe willfully made them up, although the latter would have been strongly at odds with Beebe's reputation as an honest and rigorous scientist. While many of Beebe's observations from the Bathysphere have since been confirmed by advances in undersea photography, it is unclear whether others fit the description of any known sea animal. One possibility is that although these animals indeed exist, so much remains to be discovered about life in the deep ocean that these animals have yet to be seen by anyone other than him.|$|E

5|$|In February 1943, Hutson {{announced}} his retirement from football due to <b>a</b> <b>lingering</b> chest injury. He {{changed his mind and}} returned for the 1943 season, however, and caught 47 passes for 776 yards and eleven touchdowns, leading the league in all three. He also threw his first and only completed pass of his career: a 38-yard touchdown pass to Harry Jacunski against the Bears. Additionally, he successfully kicked 36 extra points on 36 tries, and had an 83-yard interception return touchdown. After the season Hutson again {{announced his}} intention to retire as a player, this time to be an assistant coach for the Packers. He once again returned as a player in 1944 and again led the league with 58 receptions, 866 yards, and nine touchdowns, while also serving as assistant coach. He led the Packers to the 1944 NFL Championship Game against the Giants and caught two passes for 47 yards, as the Packers won their third and final championship with Hutson, 14–7.|$|E
5|$|The 1997 Asian Financial Crisis {{affected}} the economy, resulting in <b>a</b> <b>lingering</b> {{decline of the}} value of the peso and falls in the stock market. The extent it was affected initially was not as severe as that of some of its Asian neighbors. This was largely due to the fiscal conservatism of the government, partly as a result of decades of monitoring and fiscal supervision from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), in comparison to the massive spending of its neighbors on the rapid acceleration of economic growth. There have been signs of progress since. In 2004, the economy experienced 6.4% GDP growth and 7.1% in 2007, its fastest pace of growth in three decades. Average annual GDP growth per capita for the period 1966–2007 still stands at 1.45% in comparison to an average of 5.96% for the East Asia and the Pacific region as a whole. The daily income for 45% of the population of the Philippines remains less than $2.|$|E
5|$|The {{leader of}} the Congolese {{province}} of Katanga, Moise Tshombe, requested British and Rhodesian forces to enter the country to restore order. Welensky was sympathetic to the situation but unable to act; the British government, which had ultimate jurisdiction over the federation, disallowed him from mobilising the armed forces. Tshombe declared Katanga unilaterally independent on 11 July, one day after requesting British and Rhodesian assistance. Welensky pleaded with Macmillan to deploy the Rhodesian forces but Macmillan rebuffed him, telling Welensky their hopes were pinned on the United Nations being able to restore order, and hoping for a wholly neutral or anti-communist Congo. United Nations Secretary General Dag Hammarskjöld, hoping to negotiate a solution to Katanga's secession, agreed to meet Tshombe at Ndola. However, Hammarskjöld's plane crashed close to Ndola, and he was killed. Welensky was subsequently blamed for the accident throughout the communist and Afro-Asian world, becoming a hated figure and <b>a</b> <b>lingering</b> symbol of colonialism. Welensky's attitude towards Katanga and the Congo would strain relations between the federation and the British until its dissolution.|$|E
