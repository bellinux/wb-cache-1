It's open season on immigrants, from Europe to the United States. In Europe, migration and the control of external borders has become an issue of high politics, rising {{to the top of}} the policy agenda, even as the European Community (EC) was focusing on abolishing internal borders. In the U. S., it too has been a red-hot topic of public debate in states, focusing yet again with the policy triptych of legal immigrants, illegal aliens, and refugees and asylees. This article reviews a wide variety of policy-oriented books and reports informed by recent scholarship, aimed at once to sharpen the policy debate and to increase public understanding of the nature of immigration and of the policy dilemmas it poses for receiving nations. While the complexity of immigration processes makes them difficult to grasp fully, how a "problem" is perceived and framed (e. g., “illegal immigration”) [...] including conflicting ideologies, hidden and not-so-hidden agendas and assumptions that underlie many policy recommendations [...] largely dictates proposed solutions. Debates that serve to "define the situation" are thus critical to the policy process, and here is where rigorous research can make a difference in political discourse. Political compromises may help enact a policy, but they carry built-in contradictions that can plague the implementation process. Such complexities are among the primary sources of unintended consequences, yielding added reasons to reflect on the limits of public policies, particularly when what is sought is nothing less than to control a world on the move. Politics and policy-making, like life itself, are far more tangled and conflictual than the policy recommendations contained in the volumes reviewed here seem to suggest. Still, condemned to try to control a future they cannot predict by reacting to a past that will not be repeated, policymakers are nonetheless faced with an imperative need to act that cannot be ignored <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>practical</b> or political <b>matter...</b>|$|R

These collections of DNA and biological information call for the sustained involvement {{of large numbers of}} research participants, and raise a host of difficult legal and ethical issues. Historically, the commercial value of medical records, bioinformation, and gene patents emerged after the regulatory structures of bioethics came into place. For some bioethicists and policy-makers, the norm of ‘benefit sharing’ has become a necessary corrective for a system seen to facilitate the appropriation of a valuable resource from research participants. While benefit sharing should be applauded insofar as it attempts to submit relations of biocapital to new claims of distributive justice, the project is likely to fail both <b>as</b> <b>a</b> normative and <b>practical</b> <b>matter</b> without greater attention to issues of procedural justice: in particular, the constitution of distributive agency over resources for genomic research. Governance mechanisms in human subjects research are often justified as protections of research subjects from potential harms, but they also tacitly order the power to make distributive decisions over valuable collections of informational, genetic, and social capital. Benefit sharing <b>as</b> <b>a</b> discourse tends to settle political questions of distributive agency—the power to make distributive choices—in ways that exclude research participants from governing the resources they help to create. The notion of ‘partnership governance’ presents a productive avenue for achieving a normative shift from ‘benefit sharing,’ a distributive value, to ‘power sharing,’ a procedural one. If implemented, partnership governance would empower participants to exert a share in distributive decision-making in return for contributing to the economic and social capital of the project. But it would also assign research participants with correlative obligations to other capital partners such as funders and researchers, and duties to uphold the charitable missions of biobanks. Legal principles and forms from within charitable trust law and corporate governance could help achieve ‘partnership governance,’ and address obvious challenges such as agency gaps and collective action problems...|$|R

40|$|Criminal law can justly {{lay claim}} to being the native domain of law and economics. From Bentham to Becker, no area of law has been more brightly {{illuminated}} by the radiance of economic logic. Not coincidentally, in no other area of the law has the conflict between economics and ordinary moral sensibilities been perceived to be so sharp. When we are deciding how to apportion punishment, our instinct is to look backwards: wrongdoers should be condemned {{in proportion to the}} reprehensibility of their acts. I 2 ̆ 7 ll call the position that punishment should flow directly from these intuitions intrinsic value retributivism. Economics, in contrast, uses the forward-looking idiom of deterrence: punishment is justified if {{and to the extent that}} it produces a desired state of affairs; if the optimal degree of punishment so derived is out synch with intuitions about the reprehensibility of a particular crime, so much the worse for those intuitions. My goal in this essay is to demonstrate that economic analysis lacks the conceptual resources needed to criticize intrinsic value retributivism in this fashion. The economic theory necessarily presupposes some theory of value that tells us what states of affairs we are trying to maximize through punishment. To construct that theory, the members of a community must consult their shared intuitions. Once a theory of value so derived is plugged into deterrence theory, however, the results won 2 ̆ 7 t differ in any material respect from the ones the law would produce if informed explicitly by intrinsic value retributivism. This claim, which I 2 ̆ 7 ll call the theory of value dilemma, can be reduced to three sub-claims. The first is that the economic analysis of criminal law depends on an externally specified theory of value; without some account of what state of affairs the law is trying to maximize, the consequentialist logic of deterrence can 2 ̆ 7 t get off the ground. Second, this theory of value is essentially political; that is, there 2 ̆ 7 s nothing internal to economic approach that justifies discounting the valuations implicit in the decisions of a democratic political community 2 ̆ 7 s legal institutions, and hence nothing internal to economics that forecloses political advocacy of any particular theory of value. And the third and final sub-claim is that these politically derived evaluations will, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>practical</b> and conceptual <b>matter,</b> always dominate the distinctive normative components of the economic theory of deterrence.
