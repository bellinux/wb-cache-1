40|$|International audienceSouth America is {{considered}} a world biodiversity hotspot, especially for freshwater ecosystems where there is significant biodiversity and endemism across different taxonomic groups. Native South <b>American</b> <b>crayfishes</b> are characterized by small range distributions, high levels of endemism and specific habitat requirements. * Although this group may be {{considered one of the}} most threatened among South American freshwater crustaceans, IUCN Red List assessments for most of these species are ‘data deficient’. IUCN assessments are technical evaluations of species risk of extinction based on biological indicators of population features, thereby providing a ‘conservation status’ for each species based on common and international standards. * Attempts to assess the conservation status of native South <b>American</b> <b>crayfishes</b> have been limited mainly owing to a lack of fundamental data and also misinterpretations of present information. Thus, a revision of the state of knowledge of native South <b>American</b> <b>crayfishes</b> (taxonomy, phylogeny and distribution, genetics, ecology and threats) was carried out coupled with IUCN assessments of conservation status. * Globally, the lack of information on the biology of these species is still the major obstacle to making reliable conservation status assessments. For this reason, the Data Deficient (DD) category is still appropriate for many species. However, based on the Extent of Occurrence (EOO) and severely fragmented populations, number of locations and decline in area, extent or quality of habitat, it is recommended that some species (especially Virilastacus spp.) should be moved to threatened categories (VU, EN or CR). The data suggest that others are appropriately in the Near Threatened (NT) category, because they almost reach the thresholds for threatened categories. * The assessment of conservation status is essential to support future conservation actions, especially for species allocated to threatened categories. This study has identified new species under threat and also areas for future study to provide relevant data for conservation assessment for ‘data deficient’ species.

The rooted vascular plant Micranthemum umbrosum comprised 89 % of the total aboveground plant biomass and was unpalatable to all three consumers as fresh tissues, as homogenized pellets, and as crude extracts. Bioassay-guided fractionation of the crude extract from M. umbrosum led to four previously known compounds that each deterred feeding by at least one consumer: 3, 4, 5 -trimethoxyallylbenzene (1) and three lignoids: b-apopicropodophyllin (2); (j) -(3 S, 4 R, 6 S) - 3 -(3 0, 4 0 -methylenedioxya-hydroxybenzyl) - 4 -(3 00, 4 00 -dimethoxybenzyl) butyrolactone (3); and (j) -hibalactone (4).

On the contrary, the agonistic strategy of P.  clarkii did not change with temperature: when engaged in fighting, this species outcompeted both O.  limosus and P.  leniusculus. * Caution should be taken when extrapolating laboratory studies to the field, but these results, combined with outputs of previous modelling exercises, suggest that European catchments will become dominated by P.  clarkii with climate warming.

40|$|The {{crayfish}} plague pathogen, the oomycete Aphanomyces astaci, has been decimating populations of European crayfish species {{for more than}} 150 years, and is therefore {{considered one of the}} 100 worst world's invasive species. A. astaci is highly specialised for a parasitic life, but it can be isolated from moribund crayfish and grown on synthetic media, as it is the case also for several other oomycetes (chapter 7). The life of A. astaci includes three basic forms: mycelium in host's tissues, and the infective units occurring in water, zoospores and cysts. All North <b>American</b> <b>crayfish</b> species tested so far have shown some resistance to A. astaci, i. e., they could carry the infection for long, serving as vectors of the pathogen.

40|$|My Ph. D. thesis {{deals with}} {{various aspects of}} {{research}} of the crayfish plague pathogen, Aphanomyces astaci (Oomycetes).

The infection is transmitted by invasive North <b>American</b> <b>crayfish,</b> which are much less susceptible to the disease and are apparently original hosts of A. astaci.

40|$|ABSTRACT - The {{crayfish}} plague pathogen, Aphanomyces astaci, {{is responsible for}} substantial declines and local extinctions of native European crayfish populations. As a consequence, the pathogen is now listed among 100 world's worst invasive alien species. The spread of A. astaci is greatly facilitated by its natural hosts, North <b>American</b> <b>crayfish,</b> that thanks to a long co-evolutionary history with the {{crayfish plague}} pathogen evolved efficient defence mechanisms. In contrast, European, Australian and Asian crayfish species are highly susceptible to this disease agent. However, progress of A. astaci infection in native European crayfish was observed to differ between distinct pathogen strains, indicating variability in their virulence. Indeed, we demonstrated a relationship between patterns in crayfish immune response and A. astaci virulence in an experimental infection involving the European noble crayfish and three differently virulent crayfish plague strains. The European continent is currently inhabited by at least eight North <b>American</b> <b>crayfish</b> species. The carrier status was confirmed in six of them, including also Orconectes cf. virilis occurring in the Netherlands and the UK. In this country, we detected Aphanomyces astaci presence in some populations of the non-indigenous crayfish species as well [...] ...|$|R

Crayfish from three populations shown previously to be infected to different extents (high, intermediate and low), were repeatedly sampled in different years (2004 – 2010) and seasons.

There was no substantial temporal variation in pathogen prevalence in the highly and very lowly infected populations. However, a significant long-term as well as seasonal decrease {{was found in the}} intermediately infected population. This decline could be related to a decrease in population density over the studied years, and to crayfish seasonal moulting, respectively.

40|$|AbstractThe {{population}} {{size of the}} native European crayfish species has greatly decreased {{in the last century}} due to the crayfish plague and replacement by imported species, the destruction of their habitats, overfishing and eutrophication. In the present paper, the activity behaviours of two European (Astacus astacus and A. leptodactylus) and two <b>American</b> <b>crayfish</b> species (Orconectes limosus and Pacifastacus leniusculus) of the family Astacidae are studied and compared. The four crayfish species are not exclusively active during the night. The day-activity of the <b>American</b> <b>crayfish</b> species P. leniusculus and O. limosus with 33 % and 22 % of their total activity was much higher than those of A. astacus (12 %) and A. leptodactylus (16 %). All species show a relative high activity at a water temperature of 4 °C. From measurements at 25 °C and 30 °C can be concluded that P. leniusculus and A. leptodactylus are better adapted to high temperatures than A. astacus and O. limosus. At 20 °C the covered distance by the four species was calculated from the activity time and running speed. A. leptodactylus covers a distance of about 1600 m per day. In constrast, the distance covered by P. leniusculus is only 200 m.

40|$|Enemy {{release and}} biotic {{resistance}} are competing, but not mutually exclusive, hypotheses addressing {{the success or}} failure of non-native plants entering a new region. Enemy release predicts that exotic plants become invasive by escaping their coadapted herbivores and by being unrecognized or unpalatable to native herbivores that have not been selected to consume them. In contrast, biotic resistance predicts that native generalist herbivores will suppress exotic plants that will not have been selected to deter these herbivores. We tested these hypotheses using five generalist herbivores from North or South America and nine confamilial pairs of native and exotic aquatic plants. Four of five herbivores showed 2. 4 – 17. 3 fold preferences for exotic over native plants. Three species of South American apple snails (Pomacea sp.) preferred North American over South American macrophytes, while a North <b>American</b> <b>crayfish</b> Procambarus spiculifer preferred South American, Asian, and Australian macrophytes over North American relatives.

40|$|Water is a {{limiting}} factor in Mediterranean regions, being specially important to aquatic {{species such as}} the Eurasian otter. The seasonal ﬂuctuation of this resource is often addressed by constructing small and medium-sized water reservoirs. However, {{their role in the}} ecology and conservation of Eurasian otters is largely unknown. Our main goals were to assess the level of use of these reservoirs by otters and determine the main factors that may explain the observed levels of use. Intensity of use was determined by signs of otter presence and related to environmental variables using generalized linear models and variation partitioning techniques. Otters were present in the majority of reservoirs, both in the wet and dry seasons. Otter marking intensity was higher during the dry season, and positively associated with abundance of ﬁsh and <b>American</b> <b>crayﬁsh,</b> existence of refuges and marking sites, number of watercourses and area of reservoir. In contrast, cattle settlements, annual crops and length of watercourses in the surrounding area negatively affected the use of the reservoirs. Otter diet reﬂected their opportunistic behaviour through the selection of seasonally available prey and corroborated the importance of <b>American</b> <b>crayﬁsh</b> as a food item. Our results conﬁrm that otters use the majority of small and medium-sized reservoirs in the study area.

40|$|The {{availability}} of food resources {{has been suggested}} as {{a major factor in}} the substantial increase in reproductive output, survival, recruitment and, ultimately, population growth rates in most organisms. In fact, the artificial increase in food availability resulting from human activities has been suggested as a factor in the substantial increase in population size of several seabirds in recent decades. In the present study, our primary aim was to estimate the importance of the main natural prey and two alternative feeding resources, fishery discards and the invasive <b>American</b> <b>crayfish</b> Procambarus clarkii, for an opportunistic seabird, the Audouin's gull Larus audouinii. We also assessed the influence of age and sex in the use of those three types of food. For this purpose, we compared the analyses of δ 15 N and δ 13 C in blood of male and female adults of known age and chicks with those in their potential prey. Our results reveal sex-related and age-related differences in the consumption of fish discards, small pelagic fish and <b>American</b> <b>crayfish.</b> Differences in the diet of males and females and also between adults and chicks could be related to different nutritional requirements. Age differences were probably related to their different foraging proficiency and the tendency of young breeders to opportunistically exploit anthropogenically derived food.
