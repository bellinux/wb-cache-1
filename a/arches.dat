5|$|As far {{as can be}} determined, between <b>arches</b> 2 to 21, {{the outer}} facing of the {{superstructure}} consists of four layers of brick, followed by layers of rough stonemasonry bound with mortar. In contrast, between <b>arches</b> 22 and 26, {{as well as in}} both ramps on either end, the facing consists of ashlar blocks. The two repaired <b>arches</b> 27a and 27b are differentiated from the earlier work through the use of smaller unworked stones and the incorporation of irregularly placed brick tiles. In arch 26, the lower side of the arch still features a projecting bearing used for the placement of the falsework.|$|E
5|$|At the {{northern}} end of the undercroft is the passage known as the outer parlour. This has stone benches on each side and elaborately carved blind arcades above them. The arcades each consist of two groups of four round-headed <b>arches</b> with capitals, free-standing columns and bases that are set on the benches. The capitals and mouldings of the <b>arches</b> are decorated with a variety of carvings, the capitals being predominantly late Romanesque in style and the <b>arches</b> early Gothic. The carvings include depictions of human heads, stiff-leaf foliage and animals.|$|E

5|$|The Bergen <b>Arches</b> Expressway was {{proposed}} in 1989 by Governor Thomas Kean {{to connect the}} Jersey City waterfront with a new railroad line, which would provide access to the Meadowlands Sports Complex. This four-lane road was to follow an abandoned railroad line known as the Bergen <b>Arches.</b> This proposed highway was strongly supported by Jersey City Mayor Bret Schundler, who felt that the road could bring further development, {{as well as provide}} traffic relief to the four-lane Route139. In 1998, this project was allocated $26million in the federal Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century. Both Jersey City mayor candidates in 2001 supported a transit line instead of a highway along the Bergen <b>Arches.</b> Plans for a highway along the Bergen <b>Arches</b> were dropped in 2002 as leaders of Jersey City, including Mayor Glenn Dale Cunningham, favored mass transit.|$|E

The Alexander Hamilton Bridge is an example of an open-spandrel <b>arch</b> bridge. Finally, if the <b>arch</b> supports the deck only {{at the top of the}} <b>arch,</b> the bridge is called a cathedral <b>arch</b> bridge.|$|R

5|$|The {{facade of}} the mosque was built in 1065 CE on the {{instructions}} of the Fatimid caliph al-Mustansir Billah. It was crowned with a balustrade consisting of arcades and small columns. The Crusaders damaged the facade, but it was restored and renovated by the Ayyubids. One addition was the covering of the facade with tiles. The second-hand material of the facade's <b>arches</b> includes sculpted, ornamental material taken from Crusader structures in Jerusalem. The facade consists of fourteen stone <b>arches,</b> {{most of which are}} of a Romanesque style. The outer <b>arches</b> added by the Mamluks follow the same general design.

5|$|The {{style that}} {{developed}} from the Romanesque, originating in twelfth-century France, {{is now known as}} Gothic. It was characterised by pointed <b>arches,</b> ribbed vaults and flying buttresses.

The style can also be seen in the East end of Elgin Cathedral, which incorporated typical European Gothic mouldings and tracery.|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY: The term “bovine <b>arch</b> ” {{is widely}} used to {{describe}} a common anatomic variant of the human aortic <b>arch</b> branching. This so-called bovine aortic <b>arch</b> has no resemblance to the bovine aortic <b>arch.</b> We describe the most common human aortic <b>arch</b> branching patterns and compare these with the bovine aortic <b>arch.</b> One {{of the most widely}} used misnomers in the medical lit-erature is that of the “bovine aortic <b>arch</b> ” in humans. 1, 2 This term refers to a common anatomic configuration of the aortic <b>arch.</b> By its name, the bovine aortic <b>arch</b> in humans would presumably resemble the aortic <b>arch</b> branching pattern found in the family of ruminant animals, including cattle and buffalo. However, the bovine aortic <b>arch</b> configuration as-cribed to the most common human aortic <b>arch</b> variants bears no resemblance to the aortic <b>arch</b> branching pattern found in cattle. We describe the specific anatomic appearance of hu-man and bovine aortic <b>arch</b> branching patterns and propose a simple nomenclature scheme that should supplant {{the use of the term}} “bovine aortic <b>arch</b> ” in humans...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: <b>Arch</b> {{bridge is}} one of the main bridge types in China. More than 150 {{concrete}} <b>arch</b> bridges and more than 130 CFST <b>arch</b> bridges with a span over 100 m have been built. Great developments of <b>arch</b> bridges have been taking place since 1990. The three main kind <b>arch</b> bridges with world span records were built in this period, i. e., 550 m Lu Pu Bridge for steel <b>arch</b> bridge, 420 m Wanxian Yangtze River Bridge for reinforced concrete <b>arch</b> bridge and 460 m Wu-shan Yangtze River Bridge for concrete filled steel tubular <b>arch</b> bridge. <b>Arch</b> bridge is still developing.

40|$|ObjectiveOpen total <b>arch</b> {{procedures}} {{have been associated}} with significant morbidity and mortality in patients with multiple comorbidities. Aortic <b>arch</b> debranching with endovascular graft placement, the hybrid <b>arch</b> procedure, has emerged as a surgical option in this patient population. This study evaluates the outcomes of a contemporary comparative series from one institution of open total <b>arch</b> and hybrid <b>arch</b> procedures for extensive aortic <b>arch</b> pathology. MethodsFrom July 2000 to March 2009, 1196 open <b>arch</b> procedures were performed, including 45 elective and 7 emergency open total <b>arch</b> procedures. From 2005 to 2009, 64 hybrid <b>arch</b> procedures were performed: 37 emergency type A dissections and 27 elective open <b>arch</b> debranchings. Hemiarch procedures were excluded. ResultsThe hybrid <b>arch</b> cohort was significantly older (P = . 008) and had greater predominance of atherosclerotic pathophysiology (P < . 001). The incidence of permanent cerebral neurologic deficit was similar at 4 % (1 / 27) for the hybrid <b>arch</b> cohort and 9 % (4 / 45) for the open aortic <b>arch</b> cohort. In-hospital mortality was similar at 11 % (3 / 27) for the hybrid <b>arch</b> cohort and 16 % (7 / 45) for the open aortic <b>arch</b> cohort. However, in the open <b>arch</b> group, {{there was a significant difference}} in mortality between patients aged less than 75 years at 9 % (3 / 34) and patients aged more than 75 years at 36 % (4 / 11) (P = . 05). ConclusionsHybrid <b>arch</b> procedures provide a safe alternative to open repair. This study suggests the hybrid <b>arch</b> approach has a lower mortality for high-risk patients aged more than 75 years. This extends the indication for the hybrid <b>arch</b> approach in patients with complex aortic <b>arch</b> pathology previously considered prohibitively high risk for conventional open total <b>arch</b> repair...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{a new form}} of bridge called a spatial <b>arch</b> bridge. This bridge type was developed in response to the demand for landmark structures, which have started to appear in the modern urban landscape to provide a symbol of originality, innovation and progress.

Moreover, the <b>arch</b> itself may not be contained in a plane. The different variables and geometries that create such a structural configuration have been studied and classified.
