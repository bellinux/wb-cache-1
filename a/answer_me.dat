25|$|When evening comes, I go back home, {{and go to}} my study. On the threshold, I {{take off}} my work clothes, covered in mud and filth, and I put on the clothes an {{ambassador}} would wear. Decently dressed, I enter the ancient courts of rulers who have long since died. There, I am warmly welcomed, and I feed on the only food I find nourishing and was born to savour. I am not ashamed {{to talk to them}} and ask them to explain their actions and they, out of kindness, <b>answer</b> <b>me.</b> Four hours go by without my feeling any anxiety. I forget every worry. I am no longer afraid of poverty or frightened of death. I live entirely through them.|$|E
500|$|After the {{distress}} of 1897, Victoria sought {{to reassure the}} Munshi. [...] "I have in my Testamentary arrangements secured your comfort," [...] she wrote to him, [...] "and have constantly thought of you well. The long letter I enclose which was written nearly a month ago is entirely and solely my own idea, not a human being will ever know of it or what you <b>answer</b> <b>me.</b> If you can't read it I will help you and then burn it at once." [...] She told Reid the squabbles placed her and the Munshi under strain, which he replied was unlikely in the latter's case [...] "judging from his robust appearance and undiminished stoutness". Lord Salisbury told Reid he thought it unlikely in her case too, and that she secretly enjoyed the arguments because they were [...] "the only form of excitement she can have".|$|E
6000|$|... "You are not <b>answering</b> <b>me</b> fairly, dear uncle; dearest uncle, do you {{not know}} that you are not <b>answering</b> <b>me</b> fairly? You know what I mean. Have I a right to call the Thornes of Ullathorne my cousins?" ...|$|R
30|$|He {{thinks a}} while and <b>answers</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
60|$|They <b>answered</b> <b>me</b> in the affirmative, {{without a}} moment's hesitation.|$|R
2500|$|My God, keep {{my tongue}} and my lips from {{speaking}} deceit, and {{to them that}} curse me let my soul be silent, and like dust to all. Open my heart in Your Torah, and after [...] Thy commandments let me [...] pursue. As for those that think evil of [...] me speedily thwart their counsel and destroy their plots. Do [...] for Thy name's sake, do this for Thy right hand's sake, do this {{for the sake of}} Thy holiness, do this for the sake of Thy Torah. That Thy beloved ones may rejoice, let Thy right hand bring on help [...] and <b>answer</b> <b>me...</b> May the words of my mouth and the meditations of my heart be acceptable in Thy sight, O Eternal, my rock and my redeemer.|$|E
2500|$|Henry Rollins, in {{his journal}} {{collection}} Get in the Van, notes that Pettibon's artwork became synonymous with Black Flag and that before Rollins joined the band he would collect photocopies of their flyers that had circulated from California to Washington, D.C. The album cover for Nervous Breakdown had a particularly strong impact on Rollins: [...] "The record's cover art said it all. A man {{with his back to}} the wall baring his fists. In front of him another man fending him off with a chair. I felt like the guy with his fists up every day of my life." [...] Another image which drew considerable attention was the artwork created for the [...] "Police Story" [...] single, showing a police officer being held with a gun in his mouth with the speech blurb [...] "Make me come, faggot!" [...] The image was plastered on flyers all around Los Angeles and added to the police pressure on the band. Pettibon later remarked that [...] "my values are relativistic, and I'll give a cop the benefit of the doubt. If that's me with my gat – my gat's larger than the one depicted – we can have a discussion, and he can <b>answer</b> <b>me</b> just as well with my [...]357 barrel in his mouth, or on his cheek, or on his adenoids, or down his throat. I'll listen to his whimpering cries." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you don't}} <b>answer</b> <b>me,</b> Ann--I'm desprit--if you don't <b>answer</b> <b>me</b> now, if you don't say you'll come I'll go right out now----" ...|$|E
60|$|Her voice, {{when she}} <b>answered</b> <b>me,</b> showed {{some signs of}} agitation.|$|R
60|$|I paused. They <b>answered</b> <b>me</b> by silence, by a {{thoughtful}} silence.|$|R
60|$|Gom. How the gipsey <b>answers</b> <b>me!</b> Oh, 'tis a {{most notorious}} hilding.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{you will}} <b>answer</b> <b>me,</b> Bell! Or {{if you would}} like time to think, or to speak to my aunt, perhaps you will <b>answer</b> <b>me</b> to-morrow?" ...|$|E
60|$|Gom. A novice, quotha! {{you would}} make a novice of me, too, if you could. But what was his {{business}} here? <b>answer</b> <b>me</b> that, gentlewoman, <b>answer</b> <b>me</b> that.|$|E
6000|$|... "You do not <b>answer</b> <b>me,</b> Miss Monson," [...] {{continued}} Tom peeping out at {{one side}} of me, for I was still at his eyes--"you do not <b>answer</b> <b>me,</b> cruel, inexorable girl!" ...|$|E
60|$|To my delight he {{understood}} and <b>answered</b> <b>me</b> {{in the same}} jargon.|$|R
60|$|The impudent cheat <b>answered</b> <b>me</b> in the Gaelic {{that he had}} no English.|$|R
60|$|They <b>answered</b> <b>me</b> with a yell, and I {{sat down}} content, and laughed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Will you <b>answer</b> <b>me,</b> sir?" [...] she repeated. [...] "Who {{instructed}} {{you to call}} on Mr. Quiverful this morning?" [...] There {{was another}} pause. [...] "Do you intend to <b>answer</b> <b>me,</b> sir?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Woman," [...] {{cried the}} officer, turning upon Tara, [...] "you {{were the last}} to see E-Med the dwar. <b>Answer</b> <b>me</b> now and <b>answer</b> <b>me</b> truthfully. Did you see him leave this room?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Royal Khaemuas, {{prince and}} magician," [...] she said, [...] "hearken to one who, like you, was Egypt's heir centuries {{before you were}} born, one also who ruled over the Two Lands, and not so ill--which, Prince, never was your lot. <b>Answer</b> <b>me!</b> Is all wisdom centred in your breast? <b>Answer</b> <b>me!</b> Do you alone know the mysteries of Life and Death? <b>Answer</b> <b>me!</b> Did your god Amen teach you that vengeance went before mercy? <b>Answer</b> <b>me!</b> Did he teach you that men should be judged unheard? That they should be hurried by {{violence}} to Osiris ere their time, and thereby separated from the dead ones whom they loved and forced to return to live again upon this evil Earth? ...|$|E
60|$|Her head drooped {{lower on}} her bosom; her voice sunk as she <b>answered</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Pierre--I have no {{slightest}} proof--but {{the guitar}} was hers, I know, I feel it was. Say, did I not last night tell thee, how it first sung to me upon the bed, and <b>answered</b> <b>me,</b> without my once touching it? {{and how it}} always sung to <b>me</b> and <b>answered</b> <b>me,</b> and soothed and loved me,--Hark now; thou shalt hear my mother's spirit." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{felt him}} shiver, {{for he was}} leaning heavily upon <b>me.</b> Nevertheless, he <b>answered</b> <b>me</b> with confidence.|$|R
6000|$|... "There's no one else--what am I to do? <b>Answer</b> <b>me,</b> why {{did they}} put us here? <b>Answer</b> <b>me,</b> little red wretch! I don't mind now what you did--they were not hurt after all. You didn't {{know what you were}} doing--you had no young ones of your own." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Miss Burton. I am {{hard pressed}} at present, and I know {{no one else}} of whom I can ask a certain question, if I cannot ask it of you. I think that you will <b>answer</b> <b>me</b> truly, if you <b>answer</b> <b>me</b> at all. I do not think you would flatter me, or tell me an untruth." ...|$|E
60|$|SEELCHEN. [Touching his hands] Thy {{hands are}} rough to pluck flowers. [She breaks {{away from him}} to the rock where THE GOATHERD is lying] See! Nothing moves! The very day stands still. Boy! [But THE GOATHERD neither stirs nor answers] He is lost in the blue. [Passionately] Boy! He will not <b>answer</b> <b>me.</b> No one will <b>answer</b> <b>me</b> here.|$|E
60|$|She {{suddenly}} looked up, and <b>answered</b> <b>me</b> with a flush on {{her kind}} and handsome old face.|$|R
60|$|His eyes {{softened}} instantly. Little {{by little}} the color faded {{out of his}} face as he <b>answered</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R

60|$|Fisc. And what? Why do you {{stare and}} tremble? <b>Answer</b> <b>me</b> like a man.|$|E
60|$|The dog {{laid his}} head on her lap, asking to be caressed. She patted him while she <b>answered</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
60|$|After another silence, {{the husband}} of the absent woman, turning to <b>me</b> again, <b>answered</b> <b>me</b> with his usual grumbling unwillingness.|$|R
60|$|I {{asked the}} boy why {{his father had}} said that; but he ran back towards the village without <b>answering</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
