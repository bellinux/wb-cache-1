50|$|Wheat yellow leaf virus (WYLV) is a wheat (Triticum spp. L.), barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), rye (Secale cereale M.Bieb.), and oat (<b>Avena</b> <b>sativa</b> <b>L.)</b> {{pathogenic}} virus of {{the family}} Closteroviridae. WYLV virions are 1600-1850 nm in length and 10 nm in diameter. The virus, like other members of its genus, is transmitted by aphids. Identified vectors include Rhopalosiphum padi L. and R. maidis Fitch. (Aphididae). The virus has been identified in crop plants in Japan, China, and Italy. Native host plants include Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) in Europe and Agropyron tsukushiense var. transiens Ohwi in Japan. The virus proliferates in the phloem of its host plants, interfering with the plant's ability to produce sufficient chlorophyll (Chlorosis), causing the leaves to yellow and the plant to die.|$|E
40|$|Summary. In {{attempt to}} {{elucidate}} the early molecular events {{associated with the}} biological action of cyclic guanosine 3 /, 5 /- monophosphate (cGMP) its binding to the structural components of <b>Avena</b> <b>sativa</b> <b>L.</b> plant cell has been studied. cGMP was shown to be bound specifically to proteins located predominantly in the soluble cytosolic fraction. cGMP-agarose affinity purification procedure followed by SDS-PAGE has revealed about ten specific cGMP-binding proteins in the cytosol. The nature of the purified proteins has been discussed [...] Key words: <b>Avena</b> <b>sativa</b> <b>L.,</b> affinity chromatography purification, cGMP, cGMP-binding activity, cGMP-binding proteins, soluble cytosolic fraction...|$|E
40|$|Objective(s) : Nowadays, {{nanoparticles}} bio production, considering {{their performance}} {{in medicine and}} biological science, is increasing. Green synthesis of metal nanoparticles using organisms {{has emerged as a}} nontoxic and ecofriendly method for synthesis of metal nanoparticles The objectives of this study were the production of silver nanoparticles using <b>Avena</b> <b>sativa</b> <b>L.</b> extract and optimization of the biosynthesis process. The effects of quantity of substrate (silver nitrate (AgNo 3)) and temperature on the formation of silver nanoparticles are studied. Methods: In this work, silver nanoparticles were synthesized from an extract of <b>Avena</b> <b>sativa</b> <b>L.</b> at different temperatures (30 ° C, 60 ° C, 90 ° C)  and AgNo 3 concentrations(1 mM, 2 mM, 4 mM). The morphology and size of the nanoparticles were determined using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS). Results: SEM images showed that by increasing temperature nanoparticles size were decreased and by increasing concentrations of AgNo 3 the number of nanoparticles was increased. Conclusions: The results indicated that by increasing the reaction temperature, the size of the nanoparticles would decrease. Also by increasing the concentrations of AgNo 3, the amount of produced nanoparticles would be increased, but won't {{have a significant effect on}} its size. The preparation of nano- structured silver particles using <b>Avena</b> <b>sativa</b> <b>L.</b> extract provides an environmentally friendly option as compared to currently available chemical/ physical methods...|$|E
40|$|To {{elucidate}} {{the influence of}} growth temperature and of stage of maturity on lipid synthesis in seeds, oat plants (<b>Avena</b> <b>sativa</b> nuda <b>L.,</b> variety NOS) were fed with 14 CO 2 at different stages after flowering, and the 14 C-incorporation into the grain lipids was determined at 2, 24, and 48 hours {{after the end of}} 14 CO 2 -application. By changing growth temperature from 12 C to 28 C after the application of 14 CO 2 to intact plants, a higher 14 C-labeling of saturated fatty acids was found at the higher temperature. At 28 C, palmitic and stearic acids contained 23 % and 9 % respectively of total fatty acid- 14 C shortly after the 14 CO 2 -application, whereas at 12 C the corresponding values were 19 % and 4 %, respectively. Within 2 days 14 C-activity of saturated fatty acids decreased at both temperatures, but to a lesser degree at 28 C. The higher 14 C-labeling of saturated fatty acids and its lower decrease within 2 days at 28 C clearly show a direct influence of temperature on fatty acid biosynthesis in oat grains...|$|R
40|$|The study {{presents}} the results of research on the acute toxicity of a fertilizer formulas made of spent coffee ground (SCG) with addition of ash from low-temperature combustion of biomass or ash with an admixture of magnesium sulphate and blood meal. The experimental fertilizer formulas included also rape oil used as a plasticizer for controlling the nutrients release from the fertiliser. Mustard (Sinapis alba <b>L.),</b> oats (<b>Avena</b> <b>sativa</b> sp. <b>L.),</b> cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) and cress (Lepidium sativum L.) were used as test plants species in the experiment. The toxicity tests were performed using a standard procedure of 72 h with the use of Phytotoxkit microbiotest and fertilizer application of 2. 5; 5 and 10 % (v/v). The obtained results indicated an increase of acute toxicity for all tested plant species, proportionally to the applied doses of the fertilizer. During the 72 h period, the strongest inhibition of seedling growth was recorded in samples consisting of 10 % of the tested fertilizers, particularly when they showed considerable level of salinity or low pH values. From the tested plant species, cress (Lepidium sativum L.) {{turned out to be the}} most sensitive to the applied fertilizers, the least was cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) for which only a small inhibition of root system growth was observed. The inhibited growth of roots could be attributed to a reduced oxygen access and excessive salinity of the substratum caused by the applied additives...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} heavy metal accumulation in wheat (Triticum aestivum) and oat (<b>Avena</b> <b>sativa),</b> and other physiological and biochemical parameters affected by these heavy metals.

40|$|Salvia miniata Fernald [1] is a Mexican species whose aerial part exudate showed {{herbicide}} activity against Papaver rhoeas L. and <b>Avena</b> <b>sativa</b> <b>L.</b> in {{a preliminary}} test [2]. Some diterpenes isolated from Salvia miniata had phytotoxic activity against the germination and the subsequent growth of Papaver rhoeas L. and <b>Avena</b> <b>sativa</b> <b>L.,</b> thus indicating that these compounds likely contribute to {{the activity of the}} total exudate mixture [3]. The surface exudate, obtained by rinsing the plant material with CH 2 Cl 2, and subjected to repeated column chromatography on Sephadex LH- 20 and silica gel and to HPLC-MS and MS 2 experiments followed by semi-preparative RP-HPLC, yielded a new clerodane diterpenoid (1), identified by IR and NMR analysis, including TOCSY, COSY, HSQC, HMBC and ROESY experiments, and ESI-TRAP-MS and HR-MS analysis.

40|$|Naked oat (<b>Avena</b> <b>sativa</b> ssp. nuda <b>L.)</b> is {{the highest}} quality small-grain cereal that can be grown at the northernmost margin of cereal production. It remains an under-utilised crop and it {{contributes}} less than 0. 1 % to the total oat area in Finland. In general, limited interest in growing naked oat more extensively is attributed to its weaknesses, which ironically result from nakedness that improves {{the quality of the}} crop. This paper reviews the available literature and assesses the balance of the arguments for and against naked oats. Results from the study were transformed into quantitative variables and analysed for strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) using an analytical hierarchical process. As the importance of different SWOT-factors depends largely on targeted end-use of yield, separate analyses were done for use of naked oats as on-farm feed and as an input for the feed and food industry. If we aim at increasing area under naked oat in Finland, the most feasible starting point would be on-farm feed. In this case, strengths (high nutritional quality and energy content) outweighed weaknesses (sensitivity to grain damage) and threats (problems in germination). Increasing naked oat production in this respect is likely to encourage solving the remaining problems that deter industry. Threats (availability) regarding the feed industry and weaknesses (incomplete expression of nakedness) in the food industry out-weighed strengths (high nutritional quality and storability) and opportunities (potential niches). ...|$|R
