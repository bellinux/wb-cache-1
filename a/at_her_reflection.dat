5|$|Though {{there are}} {{standard}} descriptions of Dhumavati's form, some relatively recent paintings deviate from it. For example, an 18th-century painting by Molaram depicts Dhumavati {{sitting on a}} chariot pulled by two black scavenger birds with curved beaks. The painting follows the usual attributes like the winnowing basket, boon-giving gesture, but also depicts her young and beautiful with full breasts and adorned in gold finery, {{a stark contrast to}} her usual form. An early 20th-century painting from Varanasi depicts her riding a crow, holding a trident, a sword, a winnowing fan, and a bowl in her four arms, dark-complexioned, with sagging breasts, wearing white clothes and with cremation flames in the background. She is again adorned in gold finery and wears a gold-hewn lower garment, unusual for a widow's dress. Another 18th century Nepali manuscript depicts a complete deviation from her traditional descriptions. She is completely nude with high breasts, wears a pearl necklace and headband, stands on a peacock with legs apart, and holds a mirror while looking <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>reflection.</b> A ring of fire surrounds her, possibly conveying cremation flames.|$|E

At work she finds a love note in her shoes and assumes {{it came from a}} coworker named Imada, but later finds out that he is uninterested in her. At home she looks <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>reflection</b> and laughs.|$|E
500|$|The video {{starts with}} a warning saying [...] "no men were harmed {{in the making of}} this video". In the opening, it shows Aguilera playing 1980's {{computer}} games on her computer when she gets an incoming message from an occult fortune teller. Opening the message, she asks [...] "Hey Oranum, what's my week look like?" [...] to which the occult fortune teller responds [...] "You're gonna have a killer week!". Aguilera coyly smiles to the camera and images are shown of Aguilera writhing around seductively on a bed and eating cereal whilst on the couch watching cartoons. In the clip, Aguilera plays a killer who kills men after seducing them. She goes on a ride with the first man and seduces him leading to a make-out session between the two, then after he falls asleep, she blows up his car in electric-pink flames. Next, she goes to a bar and seduces the second man in a bathroom stall, where she bludgeons him to death, leaving spatters of blue paint dripping from the walls. Finally, she seduces a third unlucky suitor (who was foretold by the same occult fortune teller that it was his unlucky day) by inviting him to a motel and then uses a baseball bat to kill him, [...] "showering the room in a mist of red confetti". The video ends with Aguilera washing off the red confetti splattered all over herself while looking in the mirror <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>reflection</b> and as the confetti goes down the drain, shows Aguilera in her trailer eating cereal while changing channels on her television set, settling on [...] "The Lucy Show" [...] before smiling and turning off her television. The video features several cultural influences, including the old NES Advantage, the psychic site Oranum.com, and short films of The Lucy Show featuring American actress Lucille Ball.|$|E

60|$|Shutting the door, she {{returned}} to the office and glanced critically <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>reflection</b> in a mirror on the wall. She had been ill, in consequence of the strain she had borne while her father was sick, and looked older. Her face was thin and she felt tired, but her skin had not lost its silky whiteness, and her black dress hung in becoming lines. It was a well-cut dress, for Sadie was extravagant in such matters and knew how to choose her clothes. She had lost the freshness that had marked her, but had gained something: a touch of dignity that she thought of as style.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Among his books!' she cried, confounded. 'And I dying! I on {{the brink}} of the grave! My God! does he know how I'm altered?' {{continued}} she, staring <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>reflection</b> in a mirror hanging against the opposite wall. 'Is that Catherine Linton? He imagines me in a pet--in play, perhaps. Cannot you inform him that it is frightful earnest? Nelly, if it be not too late, as soon as I learn how he feels, I'll choose between these two: either to starve at once--that would be no punishment unless he had a heart--or to recover, and leave the country. Are you speaking the truth about him now? Take care. Is he actually so utterly indifferent for my life?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, women! Piff! I do {{not care}} for women; they are very unkind to me, because--because--well, perhaps you can guess why, Macumazahn," [...] she answered, glancing <b>at</b> <b>her</b> own <b>reflection</b> in a little {{travelling}} looking-glass that hung from the woodwork of the wagon, for I had been using it to brush my hair, and smiled very sweetly.|$|R
60|$|But {{she did not}} dwell upon this, now, when {{fear was}} gnawing her: how she had humbled her pride for days and weeks and months for him, and how he had refused her paltry request lest he should be laughed <b>at.</b> <b>Her</b> <b>reflections</b> then were not on his waning love. She {{was filled with the}} terror of losing him--of losing all that {{remained}} to her in the world. Presently she began to walk slowly towards the stairs, descended them, and looked around <b>her.</b> The hall, <b>at</b> least, had not changed. She listened, and a bee hummed in through the open doorway. A sudden longing for companionship possessed her-no matter whose; and she walked hurriedly, as though she were followed, through the empty rooms until she came upon George Pembroke stretched at full length on the leather-covered lounge in the library. He opened his eyes, and got up with alacrity.|$|R
60|$|She passed {{across the}} room, {{and on her}} way paused before an old cheval-glass, before which were {{suspended}} two silver candlesticks containing lighted wax candles. She looked steadfastly <b>at</b> <b>her</b> own <b>reflection.</b> A little smile parted her lips. In the bedroom of this quaint farmhouse she was looking upon a face and a figure which the illustrated papers and the enterprise of the modern photographer had combined to make familiar to the world.|$|R
60|$|Shortly before five Isabel {{heard the}} horn of the {{returning}} car. She ran to a mirror and gazed <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>reflection</b> with new interest, for after useless struggle with Fate {{she had decided to}} let Philip Barry cross the water. The telegram had been sent to New York and soon her message would vibrate over the Atlantic cable. Early in the afternoon she had overhauled gowns not intended to be worn until several months later. Her changed toilet was a matter of significance, almost a challenge to her aunt, who would readily construe a transformation from half mourning to violet crepe and amethysts. She listened to the horn, dreading an ordeal. Fortunately, intuitions concerning Mrs. Grace always developed her own mastery. And to-day Isabel ignored the aunt's startled expression and crude outcry, as she hastened on to meet arriving guests.|$|E
60|$|Impelled by a half-feigned fear, {{she stole}} {{away into the}} kitchen bedroom where Bert had died, to study {{her face in the}} bureau mirror. No, she decided; she was little changed. She was still {{equipped}} for the battlefield of love. Beautiful she was not. She knew that. But had not Mercedes said that the great women of history who had won men had not been beautiful? And yet, Saxon insisted, as she gazed <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>reflection,</b> she was anything but unlovely. She studied her wide gray eyes that were so very gray, that were always alive with light and vivacities, where, in the surface and depths, always swam thoughts unuttered, thoughts that sank down and dissolved to give place to other thoughts. The brows were excellent--she realized that. Slenderly penciled, a little darker than her light brown hair, they just fitted her irregular nose that was feminine but not weak, that if anything was piquant and that picturesquely might be declared impudent.|$|E
60|$|But {{there was}} no time to be lost. She went {{straight}} back to the Ritz and wrote a few brief words to Mr. Carter. Having dispatched this, and Tommy not having yet returned--which did not surprise her--she started off on a shopping expedition which, with an interval for tea and assorted creamy cakes, occupied her until well after six o'clock, and she returned to the hotel jaded, but satisfied with her purchases. Starting with a cheap clothing store, and passing through one or two second-hand establishments, she had finished the day at a well-known hairdresser's. Now, in the seclusion of her bedroom, she unwrapped that final purchase. Five minutes later she smiled contentedly <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>reflection</b> in the glass. With an actress's pencil she had slightly altered the line of her eyebrows, and that, taken in conjunction with the new luxuriant growth of fair hair above, so changed her appearance that she felt confident that even if she came face to face with Whittington he would not recognize her. She would wear elevators in her shoes, and the cap and apron would be an even more valuable disguise. From hospital experience she knew only too well that a nurse out of uniform is frequently unrecognized by her patients.|$|E

50|$|One Final Game: Emily {{is shown}} {{seemingly}} {{in a new}} apartment bedroom, and Katherine's actions mirror that of <b>her</b> mother's <b>at</b> {{the beginning of the}} film. She reassures her love to Emily and begins to leave the room. Emily asks Katherine to leave the door open, but Katherine insists she cannot. As the door shuts, a protected window is visible on the door. The next cut is of Katherine locking the door from the outside, revealing this assumed apartment bedroom is actually a hospital room in a children's psychiatric ward. Emily gets out of bed and does a Hide and Seek countdown. She nears the closet, opens, and smiles <b>at</b> <b>her</b> own <b>reflection</b> in the mirror.|$|R
6000|$|Often {{the happiest}} {{beginning}} {{had the most}} painful ending. The greatest pleasure he could give her was {{to take her to}} see Elspeth's baby girl, or that sturdy rogue, young Shiach, who could now count with ease up to seven, but swayed at eight, and toppled over on his way to ten; or their mothers brought them to her, and Grizel understood quite well who her visitors were, sometimes even called Elspeth by her right name, and did the honours of her house irreproachably, and presided at the tea-table, and was rapture personified when she held the baby Jean (called after Tommy's mother), and sat gaily on the floor, ready to catch little Corp when he would not stop at seven. But Tommy, whom nothing escaped, knew with what depression she might pay for her joy when they had gone. Despite all his efforts, she might sit talking to herself, at first of pleasant things and then of things less pleasant. Or she stared <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>reflection</b> in the long mirror and said: [...] "Isn't she sweet!" [...] or [...] "She is not really sweet, and she did so want to be good!" [...] Or instead of that she would suddenly go upon her knees and say, with clasped hands, the childish prayer, [...] "Save me from masterful men," [...] which Jean Myles had told Tommy to teach Elspeth. No one could have looked less masterful at those times than Tommy, but Grizel did not seem to think so. And probably they had that night once more to search the Den.|$|E
6000|$|Willum Lang's {{puckered}} face means business. He {{has been}} sent for by a millworker from Langholm, who, having an hour to spare, thinks he may as well drop in at the priest's and get spliced; or by an innocent visitor wandering through the village {{in search of the}} mythical smithy; or by a lawyer who shakes his finger threateningly at Willum (and might as well have stayed at home with his mother). From the most distant shores letters reach him regarding Gretna marriages, and if Willum dislikes monotony he must be getting rather sick of the stereotyped beginning [...] "I think your charges very extortionate." [...] The stereotyped ending [...] "but the sum you asked for is enclosed," [...] is another matter. It is generally about midnight that the rustics of the county rattle Willum's door off its snib and, bending over his bed, tell him to arise and marry them. His hand is crossed with silver coin, for gone are the bridegrooms whose gold dribbled in a glittering cascade from fat purses to a horny palm; and then, with a sleepy neighbor, a cold hearth, and a rattling cynic of a window for witnesses, he does the deed. Elsewhere I have used these words to describe the scene:--"The room in which the Gretna Green marriages have been celebrated for many years is a large rude kitchen, but dimly lighted by a small 'bole' window of lumpy glass that faces an ill-fitting back door. The draught generated between the two cuts the spot where the couples stand, and must prove a godsend to flushed and flurried bridegrooms. A bed--wooden and solid, ornamented with divers shaped and divers colored clothes dependent from its woodwork like linen hung on a line to dry--fills a lordly space. The monster fireplace retreats bashfully before it into the opposite wall, and a grimy cracked ceiling looks on a bumpy stone floor, from which a cleanly man could eat his porridge. One shabby wall is happily hid by the drawers in which Lang keeps his books; and against the head of the bed an apoplectic Mrs. Langtry in a blue dress and yellow stockings, reminding the public that Simon Lang's teas are the best, shudders <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>reflection</b> in the looking-glass that dangles opposite her from a string." [...] The signboard over a snuffy tavern that attempted to enter into rivalry with the Queen's Head depicts the priest on his knees going through the church marriage services, but the Langs have always kept their method of performing the ceremony a secret between themselves and the interested persons, and the artist in this case was doubtless drawing on his imagination. The picture is discredited by the scene of the wedding being made in a smithy, when it is notorious that the [...] "blacksmith" [...] has cut the tobacco plug, and caught fish in the Solway, and worked at the loom, the last, and the toll-bar, but never wielded Vulcan's hammer. The popular term is thus a mystery, though a witness once explained, in a trial, to Brougham, that Gretna marriages were a welding of heat. Now the welding of heat is part of a blacksmith's functions.|$|E

50|$|Chinese {{legend has}} it that a very {{beautiful}} girl named Yin never tired of looking <b>at</b> <b>her</b> own <b>reflection</b> in the water whenever she took a walk across the red bridge. Han, the bird-catcher, opened his heart to her, but Yin rejected it, because the water only showed the reflection of his graceless face. Moved by the sadness of the bird-catcher, the doves began to spit in the water, which immediately reflected the souls of the two young people. Yin’s reflection became distorted by her vanity whilst Han’s reflection illuminated the surface. This vision melted the heart of Yin and the couple loved each other so much that, on certain evenings, one can make out their silhouettes leaning on the scarlet bridge.|$|R
