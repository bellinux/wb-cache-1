5|$|All tiger sharks {{generally}} swim slowly, which, {{combined with}} cryptic coloration, may make them difficult for prey to detect in some habitats. They are especially well camouflaged against dark backgrounds. Despite their sluggish appearance, tiger sharks {{are one of}} the strongest swimmers of the carcharhinid sharks. Once the shark has come close, a speed burst <b>allows</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> reach the intended prey before it can escape.|$|E
5|$|Despite its {{chemical}} similarity, lithium typically {{does not}} occur together with sodium or potassium due to its smaller size. Due to its relatively low reactivity, {{it can be found}} in seawater in large amounts; it is estimated that seawater is approximately 0.14 to 0.25 parts per million (ppm) or 25 micromolar. Its diagonal relationship with magnesium often <b>allows</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> replace magnesium in ferromagnesium minerals, where its crustal concentration is about 18ppm, comparable to that of gallium and niobium. Commercially, the most important lithium mineral is spodumene, which occurs in large deposits worldwide.|$|E

5|$|In Queensland, P. fimbriata is {{reluctant}} {{to jump into the}} webs of prey spiders, while other Portia species do this at any opportunity. The Queensland orb web spider Argiope appensa shakes its web violently to shake off intruders, and P. fimbriata finds a detour that <b>allows</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> abseil on to the prey. When the web spider Zosis genicularis is busy wrapping up its own prey and is less aware of other predators, P. fimbriata uses this activity as a type of smokescreen to approach the web spider.|$|E

5|$|The 5.7×28mm SS90 {{cartridge}} was discontinued, and replaced, in 1993, {{with the}} 5.7×28mm SS190. The SS190 uses a 2.7-mm (0.11in) shorter projectile with a weight of 2.0g (31grains), which has, when {{fired from the}} P90, a muzzle velocity of roughly 715m/s (2,350ft/s).

5|$|The Sauvignon blanc vine often buds late but ripens early, which <b>allows</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> {{perform well}} in sunny climates when {{not exposed to}} {{overwhelming}} heat. In warm regions such as South Africa, Australia and California, the grape flourishes in cooler climate appellations such as the Alexander Valley area. In areas where the vine is subjected to high heat, the grape will quickly become over-ripe and produce wines with dull flavors and flat acidity. Rising global temperatures have caused farmers to harvest the grapes earlier {{than they have in}} the past.|$|E

In quantum mechanics, the wave-like property of one particle can be described mathematically as a complex-valued function, the wave function, commonly denoted by the Greek letter psi (ψ). When the absolute value of this function is squared, it gives the probability that a particle will be observed near a location—a probability density.|$|E

5|$|The {{zebra shark}} feeds {{primarily}} on shelled molluscs, though {{it also takes}} crustaceans, small bony fishes, and possibly sea snakes. The slender, flexible body of this shark <b>allows</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> wriggle into narrow holes and crevices in search of food, while its small mouth and thickly muscled buccal cavity allow it to create a powerful suction force with which to extract prey. This species may be preyed upon by larger fishes and marine mammals. Known parasites of the zebra shark include four species of tapeworms in the genus Pedibothrium.|$|E
5|$|To be most {{effective}} at controlling a pest, a biological control agent requires a colonizing ability which <b>allows</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> keep pace with changes to the habitat in space and time. Control is greatest if the agent has temporal persistence, {{so that it can}} maintain its population even in the temporary absence of the target species, and if it is an opportunistic forager, enabling it to rapidly exploit a pest population.|$|E

5|$|A {{communications}} variant designated Tu-142MR ("Bear J") was {{the last}} production version of the Tu-142. It was tasked with long-range communications duties with Soviet ballistic missile submarines, a role {{similar to that of}} the Boeing E-6 Mercury. The Tu-142MR differed from the ASW Tu-142s in having less-sophisticated avionics, but had a long trailing wire radio aerial to relay messages to submerged Soviet submarines in times of nuclear war. This was amongst the many distinctive features of the Tu-142MR that <b>allows</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> communicate with satellites, airborne and ground-based command posts, and submarines. The aircraft replaced the Ilyushin Il-80 in the airborne command and control role. Tu-142s are currently operated by the 76th Naval Aviation Regiment from Kipelovo. Other developments of the Tu-142 include the one-off Tu-142MRT maritime reconnaissance variant, and the unbuilt Tu-142MS missile-carrying variant.|$|E
5|$|Alloys of zinc {{with small}} amounts of copper, aluminium, and {{magnesium}} are useful in die casting as well as spin casting, especially in the automotive, electrical, and hardware industries. These alloys are marketed under the name Zamak. An {{example of this is}} zinc aluminium. The low melting point together with the low viscosity of the alloy makes possible the production of small and intricate shapes. The low working temperature leads to rapid cooling of the cast products and fast production for assembly. Another alloy, marketed under the brand name Prestal, contains 78% zinc and 22% aluminium, and is reported to be nearly as strong as steel but as malleable as plastic. This superplasticity of the alloy <b>allows</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be molded using die casts made of ceramics and cement.|$|E
