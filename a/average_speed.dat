Their time was 3 hours, 51 minutes, 52 seconds, an <b>average</b> <b>speed</b> of , which broke the previous turboprop transcontinental record held by Chuck Yeager and Renald Davenport.|$|E
5|$|Historically, storms of such {{magnitude}} {{and with such}} high wind velocities have not lasted more than four or five hours. The Great Lakes storm, however, raged for more than 16hours, with an <b>average</b> <b>speed</b> of 60mph (100km/h), and frequent bursts of more than 70mph (110km/h). It crippled traffic on the lakes and throughout the Great Lakes basin region.|$|E
5|$|On the maxi-catamaran Cheyenne (formerly named PlayStation), Fossett twice set {{the prestigious}} 24 Hour Record of Sailing. In October 2001, Fossett {{and his crew}} set a transatlantic record of 4 days 17 hours, {{shattering}} the previous record by 43 hours 35 minutes; an increase in <b>average</b> <b>speed</b> of nearly seven knots.|$|E

5|$|The 21stages of the 2009 Giro d'Italia {{were divided}} into five categories: one team time trial, seven flat stages, four {{intermediate}} stages, seven mountain stages and two individual time trials. The type of stage together with the <b>average</b> <b>speed</b> of the winner decided how much time each cyclist {{would be allowed to}} finish that stage before being eliminated from the race.|$|E
5|$|A Private act, {{passed in}} September 1881, allowed the {{construction}} of more private horse tramways and additional acts were passed authorising more line construction and services by more companies. Most of the companies operated double-decker tram, although some were single level cabs with many built by John Stephenson Co, Duncan & Fraser of Adelaide, and from 1897 by the A at Kensington. The trams ran at an <b>average</b> <b>speed</b> of , usually two horses pulling each tram {{from a pool of}} four to ten.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{configuration}} of the Autodromo Nazionale Monza, with its high <b>average</b> <b>speed,</b> the teams set up their cars to produce the minimum amount of downforce possible. Williams introduced a revised FW23 specification for Montoya after one was used by Ralf Schumacher in Belgium. Williams equipped the earlier aerodynamic package on Ralf Schumacher's car on Sunday morning. Benetton brought a new front wing and Ferrari debuted a new engine specification with improved aerodynamics.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{configuration}} of the Circuit de Monaco, with its low <b>average</b> <b>speed</b> and abundance of low-speed corners, allied to the low-grip nature of the public road surface, the teams all set their cars up to produce the maximum amount of downforce and mechanical grip possible. Benetton modified their car's suspensions to work better on the circuit's low-speed corners. The Minardi cars came equipped with a new titanium cast gearbox and new rear suspensions. McLaren brought an additional spare car to the event, with four in total being shared between Häkkinen and Coulthard.|$|E
5|$|During the tour, {{tensions}} sometimes arose {{between the}} senior players, who were war veterans and drinkers, while the younger players including Davidson tended {{to abstain from}} alcohol. Teammate Ian Craig estimated that bus journeys to matches proceeded at an <b>average</b> <b>speed</b> of 16km/h because of persistent stoppages outside pubs, something that frustrated the non-drinkers. In the end, the young players had {{to the majority of}} the fielding as their older colleagues were often still intoxicated during matches.|$|E

5|$|For {{additional}} maneuverability, the turuma carried 19 pairs (16 in {{the first}} two ships) of oars with four men per oar. Oarsmen rowed sitting on the weather deck, above the gun deck, with the oarports attached to a rectangular outrigger that was designed to improve the leverage. Despite this, turumas performed poorly under oars and were very difficult to move in any kind of contrary wind. In calm weather the <b>average</b> <b>speed</b> with oars was reported as low as half a knot.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} stage, {{the first major}} climb, the Ballon d'Alsace, made its debut. Four riders were the fastest climbers: Trousselier, René Pottier, Cornet and Aucouturier. Of those four, Trousselier and Aucouturier {{were the first to}} be dropped, and Cornet had to drop in the final kilometers. The top was {{therefore}} reached first by René Pottier, without dismounting, at an <b>average</b> <b>speed</b> of 20km/h. Cornet, who reached the top second, had to wait 20 minutes for his bicycle with higher gear, because his support car had broken down.|$|E
5|$|On 29 September 1931, barely {{two weeks}} after the British team had secured the Schneider Trophy outright, Flight Lieutenant George Stainforth broke the world {{airspeed}} record in a Rolls-Royce R-powered Supermarine S.6B, serial S1595, reaching an <b>average</b> <b>speed</b> of 407.5mph (655.67km/h).

5|$|The {{mountain}} {{is also the}} host {{to one of the}} oldest car races in the country, the Mount Washington Hillclimb Auto Race, which has been held on and off since 1904. In September 2010, Travis Pastrana set an unofficial record at 6 minutes, 20.47 seconds, driving a Vermont sports car Subaru WRX STi. In June 2014, David Higgins set a new record for ascent of Mt. Washington in a car, at 6:09.09 with an <b>average</b> <b>speed</b> of 75mph, using the same model vehicle.|$|E
5|$|Caracciola {{started from}} the second row of the grid at the German Grand Prix, but was into the lead soon after the start. There he {{remained}} to the finish, in front of von Brauchitsch and Rosemeyer. He took pole position at the Monaco Grand Prix three weeks later, and was soon engaged in a hard fight with von Brauchitsch. The Mercedes-Benz drivers took the lead from each other several times, but von Brauchitsch won after a screw fell into Caracciola's induction system during a pit stop, costing him {{three and a half}} minutes. Caracciola won his second race of the season at the Swiss Grand Prix. Despite heavy rain which made the Bremgarten Circuit slippery and hazardous, Caracciola set a new lap record, at an <b>average</b> <b>speed</b> of , and cemented his reputation as the Regenmeister.|$|E
5|$|During the 1929 race at Cowes between Great Britain and Italy, Richard Waghorn {{flying the}} Supermarine S.6 {{with the new}} Rolls-Royce R engine {{retained}} the Schneider Trophy for Great Britain with an <b>average</b> <b>speed</b> of , and also gained the 50km and 100km (31mi and 62mi) world speed records. The records were subsequently beaten when Richard Atcherley later registered higher speeds when he completed his laps of the circuit. The Italian team placed second and fourth using Fiat AS.3 V-12-powered Macchi M.52 aircraft. Another racing seaplane, the Fiat C.29 powered by the AS.5 engine attended the contest but did not compete.|$|E

5|$|The Brill Tramway, {{also known}} as the Quainton Tramway, Wotton Tramway, Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad and Metropolitan Railway Brill Branch, was a six-mile (10km) rail line in the Aylesbury Vale, Buckinghamshire, England. It was privately built in 1871 by the 3rd Duke of Buckingham as a horse tram line to {{transport}} goods between his lands around Wotton House and the national railway network. Lobbying from residents of the nearby town of Brill led to the line's extension to Brill and conversion to passenger use in early 1872. Two locomotives were bought for the line, but as it had been designed and built with horses in mind, services were very slow; trains travelled at an <b>average</b> <b>speed</b> of only 4miles per hour (6.4km/h).|$|E
5|$|On 11 March 1918, Uritsky sent Michael and Johnson to Perm, a {{thousand}} miles to the east, {{on the order of}} the Council of the People's Commissars, which included both Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin. The journey, by freight train in a coach without windows or heat, took eight days at an <b>average</b> <b>speed</b> of 5 miles per hour. At first, Michael was billeted in a hotel but two days after his arrival he was jailed by the local Soviet. Natalia lobbied the Commissars in Petrograd for his release and, on 9 April 1918, he was set at liberty within Perm. He moved into the best room in the best hotel in Perm, along with Johnson and two manservants, valet Vasily Chelyshev and former chauffeur Borunov. Natalia feared for George's safety, and in March 1918, she arranged for him to be smuggled out of Russia by his nanny with the help of Danish diplomats and the Putyatins.|$|E
5|$|On {{cross-country}} flights on {{days when}} strong lift is forecast, pilots fly with water ballast stored in tanks or bags in the wings and fin. The fin tank is used to reduce trim drag by optimizing the center of gravity, which typically would shift forward if water is stored only in the wings ahead of the spar. Ballast enables a sailplane to attain its best L/D at higher speeds but slows its climb rate in thermals, in part because a sailplane with a heavier wing loading cannot circle within a thermal as tightly as one with a lower, unballasted wing loading. But if lift is strong, typically either from thermals or wave, the disadvantage of slower climbs is outweighed by the higher cruising speeds between lift areas. Thus, the pilot can improve the <b>average</b> <b>speed</b> over a course by several percent or achieve longer distances in a given time. If lift is weaker than expected, or if an off-field landing is imminent, the pilot can jettison the water ballast by opening the dump valves.|$|E
