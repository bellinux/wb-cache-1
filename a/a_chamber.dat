5|$|Another popular {{method of}} growing {{synthetic}} diamond is {{chemical vapor deposition}} (CVD). The growth occurs under low pressure (below atmospheric pressure). It involves feeding a mixture of gases (typically 1 to 99 methane to hydrogen) into <b>a</b> <b>chamber</b> and splitting them to chemically active radicals in a plasma ignited by microwaves, hot filament, arc discharge, welding torch or laser. This method is mostly used for coatings, but can also produce single crystals several millimeters in size (see picture).|$|E

5|$|Despairing of any siege {{operation}} {{against the}} Temple's massive walls, Titus had the gates burnt down. At the ensuing council of war, {{when it was}} debated whether to destroy the entire Temple, Alexander voted with the majority who favored preservation. In the event, this made no difference; as the fighting raged on the following day, a Roman soldier hurled a burning brand into <b>a</b> <b>chamber</b> of the Temple itself.

5|$|Houston {{was granted}} {{incorporation}} on June 5, 1837, with James S. Holman becoming its first mayor.

5|$|In fertilised queens, {{the ovaries}} only become active when the queen starts to lay. An egg passes along the oviduct to the vagina {{where there is}} <b>a</b> <b>chamber</b> called the spermatheca, in which the sperm from the mating is stored. Depending on need, she may allow her egg to be fertilised. Unfertilised eggs become haploid males; fertilised eggs grow into diploid females and queens. The hormones that stimulate the {{development}} of the ovaries are suppressed in female worker bees, while the queen remains dominant.|$|E

50|$|In law, <b>a</b> <b>{{chambers}}</b> is <b>a</b> room {{or office}} used by barristers or a judge. <b>A</b> barrister's <b>chambers</b> or barristers' chambers are the rooms {{used by a}} barrister {{or a group of}} barristers. <b>A</b> judge's <b>chambers,</b> on the other hand, is the office of a judge, where the judge may hear certain types of cases, instead of in open court.|$|R
5|$|In the {{fountain}} effect, <b>a</b> <b>chamber</b> is constructed which {{is connected to}} a reservoir of heliumII by a sintered disc through which superfluid helium leaks easily but through which non-superfluid helium cannot pass. If {{the interior of the}} container is heated, the superfluid helium changes to non-superfluid helium. In order to maintain the equilibrium fraction of superfluid helium, superfluid helium leaks through and increases the pressure, causing liquid to fountain out of the container.|$|E
5|$|Jelling, in Denmark, is {{the largest}} royal {{memorial}} from the Viking Age and it was made by Harald Bluetooth in memory of his parents Gorm and Tyra, and in honour of himself.

5|$|Many organs, {{particularly}} those {{built in the}} early 20th century, are contained {{in one or more}} rooms called organ chambers. Because sound does not project from <b>a</b> <b>chamber</b> into the room as clearly as from a freestanding organ case, enchambered organs may sound muffled and distant. For this reason, some modern builders, {{particularly those}} building instruments specializing in polyphony rather than Romantic compositions, avoid this unless the architecture of the room makes it necessary.|$|E

5|$|Most crickets {{lay their}} eggs in the soil or inside the stems of plants, and to do this, female crickets have a long, {{needle-like}} or sabre-like egg-laying organ called an ovipositor. Some ground-dwelling species have dispensed with this, either depositing their eggs in an underground chamber or pushing them into {{the wall of a}} burrow. The short-tailed cricket (Anurogryllus) excavates a burrow with chambers and a defecating area, lays its eggs in a pile on <b>a</b> <b>chamber</b> floor, and after the eggs have hatched, feeds the juveniles for about a month.|$|E
5|$|Next to it, but {{higher up}} and almost inaccessible, are two cells; then a well; and, thirdly, a small vihara, with three cells, {{two of them}} with stone-beds.

Outside are two more cells and <b>a</b> <b>chamber</b> or chapel {{at the end of}} a veranda that runs along in front both of the vihara and the cells.|$|E
