25|$|In the East Roman Empire, the Romans used {{auxiliary}} forces {{known as}} dromedarii, whom they recruited in desert provinces.

25|$|As these spiders live in {{constant}} proximity to humans, {{they are not}} usually aggressive and will even let a human hand approach their web.

Further disturbance {{may lead to the}} spider dropping down on a thread, then running away from the web. If the distance is not considerable, it will usually return to its web within a couple of days. Otherwise, it will start a new one.|$|E

25|$|The {{right for}} bilingual {{topographic}} signs for the regions where Slovene and Croat Austrians live alongside the German-speaking population (as {{required by the}} 1955 State Treaty) is still to be fully implemented {{in the view of}} some, while others believe that the treaty-derived obligations have been met (see below). Many Carinthians <b>are</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> Slovenian territorial claims, pointing to the fact that Yugoslav troops entered the state after each of the two World Wars and considering that some official Slovenian atlases show parts of Carinthia as Slovene cultural territory. The recently deceased governor, Jörg Haider, has made this fact a matter of public argument in autumn 2005 by refusing {{to increase the number of}} bilingual topographic signs in Carinthia. A poll by the Kärntner Humaninstitut conducted in January 2006 states that 65% of Carinthians are not in favour of an increase of bilingual topographic signs, since the original requirements set by the State Treaty of 1955 have already been fulfilled according to their point of view.|$|E
25|$|Sigui is {{the most}} {{important}} ceremony of the Dogon. It takes place every 60 years and can take several years. The last one started in 1967 and ended in 1973; the next one will start in 2027. The Sigui ceremony symbolises the death of the first ancestor (not to be confused with Lébé) until the moment that humanity acquired the use of the spoken word. The Sigui is a long procession that starts and ends in the village of Youga Dogorou and goes from one village to another during several months or years. All men wear masks and dance in long processions. The Sigui has a secret language, Sigui So, that women are not allowed to learn. The secret Society of Sigui plays {{a central role in the}} ceremony. They prepare the ceremonies a long time in advance, and they live for three months hidden outside of the villages while nobody is allowed to see them. The men from the Society of Sigui are called the Olubaru. The villagers <b>are</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> them, and fear is cultivated by a prohibition to go out at night, when sounds warn that the Olubaru are out. The most important mask that plays a major role in the Sigui rituals is the Great Mask or the Mother of Masks. It is several meters long, held by hand, and not used to hide a face. This mask is newly created every 60 years.|$|E

500|$|Reviewer Ian Watson {{states that}} the Athshean forest itself {{is a metaphor for}} {{consciousness}} in the novel. The Terrans, distanced from their own tangled subconscious, <b>are</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> the forest, and seek to tear it down. The Athsheans, in contrast, are integrated with it at a subconscious level. The entire forest is also seen as a collective Athshean consciousness. Although the forest in The Word for World is Forest is not actually sentient, Le Guin explores the idea of a sentient forest further in the short story [...] "Vaster than Empires and More Slow", which shares many thematic parallels with the former.|$|E

Shelby Overman, a mechanic, dives into the water to repair and secure the gates. He is attacked by the shark and killed, leaving only his severed right arm. Later that night, two men sneak into the park and go underwater to steal coral they intend to sell, but both are killed by the shark in the process.|$|E
500|$|A main {{theme of}} the episode is Kate's {{inability}} to commit to other people, always running from difficult emotional situations, and having barriers {{between her and her}} interests – physical, as in Sawyer's cage or Jack's aquarium, or metaphorical, as in her inability to settle down as Kevin's wife. Kate's marriage, which was first alluded in the season one episode [...] "Outlaws", is meant to be a contrast with her relationship with Sawyer in the realtime events – Kate and Kevin is a heartfelt and passionate relationship where Kate tries to get involved but her lifestyle ends up on making the marriage fail, whereas with Sawyer both <b>are</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> intimacy and connection yet still end up together.|$|E

However, Louis welcomed assignments that provided opportunities for him to acquire the skills of war and to demonstrate to his superiors that he was serious about his naval career. Posts on royal yachts and tours arranged by the Queen and Edward actually impeded his progress, as his promotions were perceived as royal favours rather than deserved.|$|E
500|$|According to Wong, {{the idea}} of using a roller-coaster {{derailment}} as the opening-scene disaster came from New Line Cinema executive Richard Bryant and was not inspired by a Big Thunder Mountain Railroad incident. The idea of death omens in photographs was taken from The Omen (1976). Morgan revealed he searched the aisles of a local store at Sunset Boulevard for days to get inspiration regarding Erin's death at the hardware store. According to Morgan, the loss of control was a major theme that he and Wong had envisioned from the very beginning for the film; this is exemplified by both Wendy, who is afraid of losing control, as well as the roller coaster. He stated {{that one of the reasons}} people <b>are</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> roller coasters is because, according to psychologists, [...] " [...] have no control" [...] while on them.|$|E
500|$|Fear of a Black Planet {{contains}} {{themes of}} organization and empowerment within the African-American community, and of confrontation. Chuck D's critical lyrics on the album, interspersed with the surrealism of Flavor Flav, also concern contemporary black life, {{the state of}} race relations, and criticisms of institutional racism, White supremacy, and the power elite. Greg Sandow called Chuck D's language [...] "strong and elusive, often fragmentary" [...] and [...] "embedded [...] critical, sometimes brutal thoughts". Although he viewed that [...] "some people might disagree {{with some of these}} ideas", Sandow wrote that [...] "it's hard to dispute the lyrics' assertion that many Whites <b>are</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> blacks", adding that the album [...] "touches on" [...] the idea of [...] "an age when whites understand that they're a minority in the world". Robert Hilburn believed that the songs [...] "decried what Chuck D. saw as the consequences of white, European cultural domination in the United States and throughout much of the world". Sputnikmusic's Nick Butler observed [...] "two recurring themes – inter-racial relationships ... and the racism inherent in the American media".|$|E
