5|$|In {{the late}} 17th and 18th Centuries, {{equation}} clocks were made, which allowed {{the user to}} see or calculate <b>apparent</b> <b>solar</b> <b>time,</b> as would be shown by a sundial. Before {{the invention of the}} pendulum clock, sundials were the only accurate timepieces. When good clocks became available, they appeared inaccurate to people who were used to trusting sundials. The annual variation of the equation of time made a clock up to about 15 minutes fast or slow, relative to a sundial, depending on the time of year. Equation clocks satisfied the demand for clocks that always agreed with sundials. Several types of equation clock mechanism were devised. which can be seen in surviving examples, mostly in museums.|$|E
25|$|The <b>apparent</b> <b>solar</b> <b>time</b> is {{a measure}} of the Earth's {{rotation}} and the difference between it and the mean solar time is known as the equation of time.|$|E
25|$|One of Wheatstone's most ingenious devices was the 'Polar clock,' {{exhibited}} at {{the meeting of the}} British Association in 1848. It is based on the fact discovered by Sir David Brewster, that the light of the sky is polarised in a plane at an angle of ninety degrees from the position of the sun. It follows that by discovering that plane of polarisation, and measuring its azimuth with respect to the north, the position of the sun, although beneath the horizon, could be determined, and the <b>apparent</b> <b>solar</b> <b>time</b> obtained. The clock consisted of a spyglass, having a Nicol (double-image) prism for an eyepiece, and a thin plate of selenite for an object-glass. When the tube was directed to the North Pole—that is, parallel to the Earth's axis—and the prism of the eyepiece turned until no colour was seen, the angle of turning, as shown by an index moving with the prism over a graduated limb, gave the hour of day. The device is of little service in a country where watches are reliable; but it formed part of the equipment of the 1875–1876 North Polar expedition commanded by Captain Nares.|$|E
50|$|Analemmas (as {{they are}} known today) {{have been used in}} {{conjunction}} with sundials since the 18th century to convert between <b>apparent</b> and mean <b>solar</b> <b>time.</b> Prior to this, the term referred to any tool or method used in the construction of sundials.|$|R
50|$|When well-regulated {{mechanical}} clocks became {{widespread in}} the early 19th century, each city began to use some local mean <b>solar</b> <b>time.</b> <b>Apparent</b> and mean <b>solar</b> <b>time</b> can differ by up to around 15 minutes (as described by the equation of time) because of the elliptical shape of the Earth's orbit around the Sun (eccentricity) and the tilt of the Earth's axis (obliquity). Mean <b>solar</b> <b>time</b> has days of equal length, {{and the difference between}} the two sums to zero after a year.|$|R
50|$|The {{discipline}} {{imposed by}} these public clocks still remained lax by contemporary standards. A clock that only strikes the hours can only record the nearest hour that has passed; most early clocks had only hour hands in any case. Minute hands {{did not come}} into widespread use until the pendulum enabled a large leap in the accuracy of clocks; for watches, a similar leap in accuracy was not made possible before {{the invention of the}} balance spring. Before these improvements, the equation of time, the difference between <b>apparent</b> and mean <b>solar</b> <b>time,</b> was not even noticed.|$|R
5000|$|Mars Pathfinder {{used the}} local <b>apparent</b> <b>solar</b> <b>time</b> at its {{location}} of landing. Its time zone was AAT-02:13:01, where [...] "AAT" [...] is Airy Apparent Time, meaning <b>apparent</b> <b>solar</b> <b>time</b> at Airy-0.|$|E

50|$|Many {{methods have}} been used to {{simulate}} mean <b>solar</b> <b>time.</b> The earliest were clepsydras or water clocks, used for almost four millennia from as early as the middle of the 2nd millennium BC until the early 2nd millennium. Before the middle of the 1st millennium BC, the water clocks were only adjusted to agree with the <b>apparent</b> <b>solar</b> day, thus were no better than the shadow cast by a gnomon (a vertical pole), except that they could be used at night.|$|R
50|$|Mean <b>solar</b> <b>time</b> is {{the hour}} {{angle of the}} mean Sun plus 12 hours. Currently (2009) this is {{realized}} with the UT1 time scale, constructed mathematically from very long baseline interferometry observations of the diurnal motions of radio sources located in other galaxies, and other observations. The duration of daylight varies during the year but {{the length of a}} mean solar day is nearly constant, unlike that of an <b>apparent</b> <b>solar</b> day. An <b>apparent</b> <b>solar</b> day can be 20 seconds shorter or 30 seconds longer than a mean solar day. Long or short days occur in succession, so the difference builds up until mean time is ahead of apparent time by about 14 minutes near February 6 and behind apparent time by about 16 minutes near November 3. The equation of time is this difference, which is cyclical and does not accumulate from year to year.|$|R
5000|$|It {{contains}} {{a catalogue of}} writers on the subject with a brief account of their principal works. Besides his manuscript works on subjects in mathematics, mechanics, etc., Alexandre added a sixth part to Huygens' treatise [...] "De horologio oscillatorio", in which he describes a clock the length of whose pendulum was automatically varied to enable it to indicate <b>apparent</b> <b>solar</b> instead of mean <b>solar</b> <b>time.</b> A description of the pendulum mechanism, which never came into practical use, {{may be found in}} Berthoud's [...] "Essai sur l'horlogerie", Paris, 1786, I, xvii, where some of its defects are pointed out.|$|R
5000|$|The {{equation}} of time describes the discrepancy between two kinds of solar time. The word equation {{is used in the}} medieval sense of [...] "reconcile a difference". The two times that differ are the <b>apparent</b> <b>solar</b> <b>time,</b> which directly tracks the diurnal motion of the Sun, and mean solar time, which tracks a theoretical mean Sun with noons 24 hours apart. <b>Apparent</b> <b>solar</b> <b>time</b> can be obtained by measurement of the current position (hour angle) of the Sun, as indicated (with limited accuracy) by a sundial. Mean solar time, for the same place, would be the time indicated by a steady clock set so that over the year its differences from <b>apparent</b> <b>solar</b> <b>time</b> would resolve to zero.|$|E
50|$|Mean solar {{time was}} {{originally}} <b>apparent</b> <b>solar</b> <b>time</b> corrected by {{the equation of}} time. Mean solar time was sometimes derived, especially at sea for navigational purposes, by observing <b>apparent</b> <b>solar</b> <b>time</b> and then adding to it a calculated correction, the equation of time, which compensated for two known irregularities, caused by the ellipticity of the Earth's orbit and the obliquity of the Earth's equator and polar axis to the ecliptic (which is {{the plane of the}} Earth's orbit around the sun).|$|E
50|$|From 1767 to 1833, the British Nautical Almanac and Astronomical Ephemeris {{tabulated}} {{the equation}} {{of time in the}} sense 'mean minus apparent solar time'. Times in the Almanac were in <b>apparent</b> <b>solar</b> <b>time,</b> because time aboard ship was most often determined by observing the Sun. In the unusual case that the mean solar time of an observation was needed, one would apply {{the equation of}} time to <b>apparent</b> <b>solar</b> <b>time.</b> In the issues since 1834, all times have been in mean solar time, because by then the time aboard ship was increasingly often determined by marine chronometers. In the unusual case that the <b>apparent</b> <b>solar</b> <b>time</b> of an observation was needed, one would apply the equation of time to mean solar time, requiring all differences in the equation of time to have the opposite sign than before.|$|E
50|$|The graph of <b>apparent</b> <b>solar</b> {{declination}} {{is therefore}} different {{in several ways}} from a sine wave. Calculating it accurately involves some complexity, as shown below.|$|R
25|$|French {{astronomer}} Guillaume de Saint-Cloud {{suggested in}} his 1292 work Almanach Planetarum that the eccentricity {{of the sun}} could be determined with the camera obscura from the inverse proportion between the distances and the <b>apparent</b> <b>solar</b> diameters at apogee and perigee.|$|R
50|$|Each lander mission so far {{has used}} its own time zone, {{corresponding}} to average local <b>solar</b> <b>time</b> at the landing location. Of the six successful Mars landers to date, five employed offsets from local mean <b>solar</b> <b>time</b> (LMST) for the lander site while the sixth (Mars Pathfinder) used local true <b>solar</b> <b>time</b> (LTST).|$|R
50|$|The <b>apparent</b> <b>solar</b> <b>time</b> is {{a measure}} of the Earth's {{rotation}} and the difference between it and the mean solar time is known as the equation of time.|$|E
5000|$|The phrase [...] "equation of time" [...] {{is derived}} from the medieval Latin, aequātiō diērum meaning [...] "equation of days" [...] or [...] "difference of days". The word aequātiō was widely used in early {{astronomy}} to tabulate the difference between an observed value and the expected value (as in the equation of centre, the equation of the equinoxes, the equation of the epicycle). The difference between <b>apparent</b> <b>solar</b> <b>time</b> and mean time was recognized by astronomers since antiquity, but prior to the invention of accurate mechanical clocks in the mid-17th century, sundials were the only reliable timepieces, and <b>apparent</b> <b>solar</b> <b>time</b> was the generally accepted standard.|$|E
50|$|Decimal {{time was}} part of a larger attempt at decimalisation in revolutionary France (which also {{included}} decimalisation of currency and metrication) and was introduced as part of the French Republican Calendar, which, in addition to decimally dividing the day, divided the month into three décades of 10 days each; this calendar was abolished at the end of 1805. The start of each year was determined according to the day of the autumnal equinox, in relation to true or <b>apparent</b> <b>solar</b> <b>time</b> at the Paris Observatory. Decimal time would also have been reckoned according to <b>apparent</b> <b>solar</b> <b>time,</b> depending on the location it was observed, as was already the practice generally for the setting of clocks.|$|E
50|$|AMSUs {{are always}} {{situated}} on polar-orbiting satellites in sun-synchronous orbits. This results in their crossing the equator {{at the same}} two local <b>solar</b> <b>times</b> every orbit.

40|$|The Long Now Foundation is {{building}} a mechanical clock {{that is designed to}} keep time for the next 10, 000 years. The clock maintains its long-term accuracy by synchronizing to the Sun. The 10, 000 -Year Clock keeps track of five different types of time: Pendulum <b>Time,</b> Uncorrected <b>Solar</b> <b>Time,</b> Corrected <b>Solar</b> <b>Time,</b> Displayed <b>Solar</b> <b>Time</b> and Orrery Time. Pendulum Time is generated from the mechanical pendulum and adjusted according to the equation of time to produce Uncorrected <b>Solar</b> <b>Time,</b> which is in turn mechanically corrected by the Sun to create Corrected <b>Solar</b> <b>Time.</b> Displayed <b>Solar</b> <b>Time</b> advances each time the clock is wound, at which point it catches up with Corrected <b>Solar</b> <b>Time.</b> The clock uses Displayed <b>Solar</b> <b>Time</b> to compute various time indicators to be displayed, including the positions of the Sun, and Gregorian calendar date. Orrery Time is a better approximation of Dynamical Time, used to compute positions of the Moon, planets and stars and the phase of the Moon. This paper describes how the clock reckons time over the 10, 000 -year design lifetime, in particular how it reconciles the approximate Dynamical Time generated by its mechanical pendulum with the unpredictable rotation of the Earth.

50|$|Before 1891, each {{town and}} city in Metropolitan France {{had its own}} time based on local <b>solar</b> <b>time.</b> In 1891, to avoid {{complications}} with railway timetables, time was unified in Metropolitan France {{and based on the}} <b>solar</b> <b>time</b> of Paris. In detail, the railway companies used a unified time which lagged behind Paris <b>solar</b> <b>time</b> by 5 minutes, for the benefit of non-punctual travellers. In 1911, Metropolitan France adopted GMT+0 (the <b>solar</b> <b>time</b> of Greenwich) as its official time, and used it until 1940 (with GMT+1 used during the summers from 1916 to 1940).|$|R
5000|$|Before clocks {{were first}} invented, {{it was common}} {{practice}} to mark {{the time of day}} with <b>apparent</b> <b>solar</b> <b>time</b> (also called [...] "true" [...] solar time) - for example, the time on a sundial - which was typically different for every location and dependent on longitude.|$|E
50|$|Solar {{time is a}} {{calculation}} of {{the passage of time}} based on the position of the Sun in the sky. The fundamental unit of solar time is the day. Two types of solar time are <b>apparent</b> <b>solar</b> <b>time</b> (sundial time) and mean solar time (clock time).|$|E
50|$|If a horizontal-plate sundial is {{made for}} the {{latitude}} {{in which it is}} being used, and if it is mounted with its plate horizontal and its gnomon pointing to the celestial pole that is above the horizon, then it shows the correct time in <b>apparent</b> <b>solar</b> <b>time.</b> Conversely, if the directions of the cardinal points are initially unknown, but the sundial is aligned so it shows the correct <b>apparent</b> <b>solar</b> <b>time</b> as calculated from the reading of a clock, its gnomon shows the direction of True North or South, allowing the sundial {{to be used as a}} compass. The sundial can be placed on a horizontal surface, and rotated about a vertical axis until it shows the correct time. The gnomon will then be pointing to the North, in the northern hemisphere, or to the South in the southern hemisphere. This method is much more accurate than using a watch as a compass (see Cardinal direction#Watch face) and can be used in places where the magnetic declination is large, making a magnetic compass unreliable. An alternative method uses two sundials of different designs. (See #Multiple dials, above.) The dials are attached to and aligned with each other, and are oriented so they show the same time. This allows the directions of the cardinal points and the <b>apparent</b> <b>solar</b> <b>time</b> to be determined simultaneously, without requiring a clock.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, Portugal adopted mean <b>solar</b> <b>time.</b> Navy (located in Lisbon) and Coimbra Astronomical Observatories {{calculated}} <b>solar</b> <b>time</b> {{to be used}} as legal time in their longitude regions. In 1861, the Astronomical Observatory of Lisbon was founded and, in 1878, it was tasked with the exclusive competence of calculate its mean <b>solar</b> <b>time</b> and to transmit it to rest of the country’s public services. Thus, in practice, Portuguese standard time was defined as the mean <b>solar</b> <b>time</b> at Lisbon Observatory longitude, which was later calculated as being GMT-00:36:44.|$|R
50|$|In other words, Greenwich Mean Sidereal <b>Time</b> exceeds mean <b>solar</b> <b>time</b> at Greenwich by a {{difference}} {{equal to the}} longitude of the fictitious mean Sun used for defining mean <b>solar</b> <b>time</b> (with longitude converted to time as usual {{at the rate of}} 1 hour for 15 degrees), plus or minus an offset of 12 hours (because mean <b>solar</b> <b>time</b> is reckoned from 00:00 midnight, instead of the pre-1925 astronomical tradition where 00:00 meant noon).|$|R
50|$|A {{vertical}} axis tracker pivots {{only about a}} vertical axle, with the panels either vertical, at a fixed, adjustable, or tracked elevation angle. Such trackers with fixed or (seasonally) adjustable angles are suitable for high latitudes, where the <b>apparent</b> <b>solar</b> path is not especially high, but which leads to long days in summer, with the Sun traveling through a long arc.|$|R
50|$|There are two {{independent}} sources that claim the Communist Party of China, and/or the People's Republic of China, were using <b>apparent</b> <b>solar</b> <b>time</b> for Beijing Time before {{the period between}} 27 September 1949 and 6 October 1949, and they adopted the time of GMT+8 within that period of time, however such claim is dubious.|$|E
5000|$|When {{one says}} that a Sun-synchronous orbit goes over {{a spot on the}} earth at the same local time each time, this refers to mean solar time, not to <b>apparent</b> <b>solar</b> <b>time.</b> The Sun will not be in exactly the same {{position}} in the sky {{during the course of the}} year. (See Equation of time and Analemma.) ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Apparent</b> <b>solar</b> <b>time</b> ('apparent' {{is often}} used in English-language sources, but 'true' in French astronomical literature) {{is based on the}} solar day, which is the period between one solar noon (passage of the real Sun across the meridian) and the next. A solar day is {{approximately}} 24 hours of mean time. Because the Earth's orbit around the sun is elliptical, and because of the obliquity of the Earth's axis relative to the plane of the orbit (the ecliptic), the apparent solar day varies a few dozen seconds above or below the mean value of 24 hours. As the variation accumulates over a few weeks, there are differences as large as 16 minutes between <b>apparent</b> <b>solar</b> <b>time</b> and mean solar time (see Equation of time). However, these variations cancel out over a year. There are also other perturbations such as Earth's wobble, but these are less than a second per year.|$|E
40|$|At higher latitudes, most organisms use the {{periodic}} changes in day length to time their annual life cycle. At the equator, changes in day length are minimal, {{and it is}} unknown which cues organisms use to synchronize their underlying circannual rhythms to environmental conditions. Here, we demonstrate that the African stonechat (Saxicola torquatus axillaris) —an equatorial songbird—can use subtle solar cues for the annual timing of postnuptial moult, a reliable marker of the circannual cycle. We compared four groups that were kept over more than 3 years: (i) a control group maintained under constant equatorial day length, (ii) a 12 -month <b>solar</b> <b>time</b> group maintained under equatorial day length, but including a simulation of the annual periodic change in sunrise and sunset <b>times</b> (<b>solar</b> <b>time),</b> (iii) a 14 -month <b>solar</b> <b>time</b> group similar to the previous group but with an extended <b>solar</b> <b>time</b> cycle and (iv) a group maintained under a European temperate photoperiod. Within all 3 years, 12 -month <b>solar</b> <b>time</b> birds were significantly more synchronized than controls and 14 -month <b>solar</b> <b>time</b> birds. Furthermore, the moult of 12 -month <b>solar</b> <b>time</b> birds occurred {{during the same time}} of the year as that of free-living Kenyan conspecifics. Thus, our data indicate that stonechats may use the subtle periodic pattern of sunrise and sunset at the equator to synchronize their circannual clock...|$|R
