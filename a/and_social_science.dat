5|$|The {{events are}} split up into two groups: the seven {{objective}} tests (art, economics, language and literature, math, music, science <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>science)</b> the three subjective events (essay, interview and speech). In addition, {{there is a}} SuperQuiz relay event. The former seven are given as half-hour multiple choice tests, whereas the latter three are graded by judges. The multiple choice exams consist of 50 questions each, {{with the exception of}} math, which has 35 questions. Beginning in the 2012-2013 season, the SuperQuiz written test was dropped and the oral relay was changed to include questions from six of the objective subjects: art, economics, language and literature, music, science, <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>science.</b>|$|E

5|$|In general, the {{objective}} events follow a set organizational outline {{from year to}} year. Language and literature focuses on a single novel or a set of plays in addition to multiple short literary selections {{which tend to be}} poems or excerpts from short stories. The art and music sections include several selections with which students must familiarize themselves in addition to historical information. Economics remains fairly static; 85% of the material focuses on a standard course of macroeconomics and microeconomics and the remaining 15% focuses on the year's topic. For example, in 2005 the themed material covered the economics of ancient Egypt and Rome. Science <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>science</b> reflect the season's theme. Unlike the other events, there is no basic information that carries over. The math curriculum has varied as well, occasionally dropping and adding new subjects or shifting the weight of particular subjects.|$|E

Though teams consist of nine members (three from each category), only the top two individuals from each category are counted in the final team score.
