40|$|The {{higher the}} quality of one’s catalogue, the more esteem the library has had among its users. Through a well-constructed catalogue, users shall be able to find, identify, select and obtain the {{available}} information easily. With increasing bibliographic data from different sources worldwide, authority work is essential to ensure the consistency of access points and {{the overall quality of}} the catalogue. Authority work is the process to control the use of access points in a catalogue. The references in authority records provide the linking to enhance searching and increase precision in information retrieval. Authority work is the most expensive part of cataloguing; libraries have to work cooperatively to share data, and to reduce cost. To meet the bilingual nature of our community, the Hong Kong academic libraries have cooperated since 1999 to build a Hong Kong Chinese <b>Authority</b> <b>Name</b> (HKCAN) database. This paper describes the latest developments of authority projects in East Asia, and in particular the HKCAN project. Recognizing the need to have names rendered in their own script/language in different places, a virtual regional authority file (VRAF) is proposed. The authors hope that the proposal would facilitate further discussions on sharing of authority data among libraries in East Asia and beyond, and contribute to the possible Virtual International Authority File...|$|E
