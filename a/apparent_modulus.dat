40|$|ABSTRACT: The elastic moduli of ultrathin poly(styrene) (PS) and poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) {{films of}} {{thickness}} ranging from 200 nm to 5 nm were investigated using a buckling-based metrology. Below 40 nm, the <b>apparent</b> <b>modulus</b> of the PS and PMMA films decreases dramatically, with {{an order of}} magnitude decrease compared to bulk values for the thinnest films measured. We can account for the observed decrease in <b>apparent</b> <b>modulus</b> by applying a composite model based on the film having a surface layer with a reduced modulus and of finite thickness. The observed decrease in the <b>apparent</b> <b>modulus</b> highlights issues in mechanical stability and robustness of sub- 40 nm polymer films and features. Introduction. There are numerous technological drivers for the use of thin (sub- 1 µm) and ultrathin (sub- 100 nm) polymer films and features. The stability and reliability of these confined polymer systems are critical to numerous existing and emerging technologies such as next-generation lithography, lubricatin...|$|E

The models were also flipped between longer transverse and longer longitudinal trabeculae. With increasing COV of lengths and orientations of trabecular bone, the <b>apparent</b> <b>modulus</b> is linearly decreased, especially in the longer transverse trabeculae lengths. ??Damaged?? bone models were built from the 25 year old model at 5 % COV of longer transverse trabeculae, and with removing trabeculae of 5 % and 10 % of trabecular volume in transverse and longitudinal directions, respectively, {{as well as in}} combination to total 10 % and 15 %.

40|$|International audienceFracture of the {{proximal}} femur {{is a major}} public health problem in elderly persons. It has recently been suggested that combining texture analysis and bone mineral density measurement improves the failure load prediction in human femurs. In this study, we aimed to compare bone texture analysis with three-dimensional (3 D) microarchitecture and mechanical properties of trabecular bone in osteoporotic femurs. Eight femoral heads from osteoporotic patients who fractured their femoral neck provided 31 bone cores. Bone samples were studied using a new high-resolution digital X-ray device (BMA (TM), D 3 A Medical Systems) allowing for texture analysis with fractal parameter H (mean), and were examined using micro-computed tomography (microCT) for 3 D microarchitecture. Finally, uniaxial compression tests to failure were performed to estimate failure load and <b>apparent</b> <b>modulus</b> of bone samples. The fractal parameter H (mean) was strongly correlated with bone volume fraction (BV/TV) (r = 0. 84) and trabecular thickness (Tb. Th) (r = 0. 91) (p < 0. 01). H (mean) was also markedly correlated with failure load (r = 0. 84) and <b>apparent</b> <b>modulus</b> (r = 0. 71) of core samples (p < 0. 01). Bone volume fraction (BV/TV) and trabecular thickness (Tb.

Overall, the best predictors of failure load were H (mean), bone volume fraction, and trabecular thickness, with r (2) coefficients of 0. 83, 0. 76, and 0. 80 respectively.

40|$|An {{erythrocyte}} can be deformed {{very easily}} by even {{small amounts of}} stress, enabling it to flow smoothly through approximately 3 μm diameter microvessels despite its larger size of 8 μm in diameter and 2 μm in thickness. Reduction of erythrocyte deformability leads to poor circulation particularly in microvessels, which may result in hypertension and various circulatory diseases. To clarify blood microcirculatory properties, {{it is very important}} to understand the deformability of erythrocytes. However, a standard method for quantitative evaluation of erythrocyte deformability has not yet been established. In this study, an <b>apparent</b> Young's <b>modulus</b> and a time constant for the recovery of erythrocyte shape following uniaxial stretching are proposed as deformability indices.

40|$|Graphite is {{currently}} the most common anode material used in commercial lithium-ion batteries. During battery charging and discharging processes, lithium ions intercalate into and deintercalate from graphite, forming several distinct stages of graphite-lithium intercalation compounds (G-LICs). Each stage of G-LIC has a unique spacing between graphene layers, with the spacing increasing for increasing lithium content. In graphite-based composite electrodes (graphite particles in a porous polymer matrix), the changing layer spacing leads to stress and strain evolution on the composite length scale. In two separate experiments, we use substrate-curvature measurements to monitor stress changes in a thin electrode constrained on an inert, rigid substrate, and we use digital image correlation to track strain changes in a free-standing, unconstrained electrode. Combining the in-situ stress and strain analyses enables us to extract {{the change in the}} <b>apparent</b> <b>modulus</b> of the composite graphite electrode as a function of electrode potential and lithium content. As expected, we found that constrained electrodes develop compressive stress during lithiation (~ 10 MPa) and that unconstrained electrodes undergo free expansion (~ 1. 5 % linear strain). Interestingly, the <b>apparent</b> <b>modulus</b> of the electrode increases the most significantly during the formation of the dilute stage I compound, increases slightly with the formation of the stage IV, dilute stage II, and stage II compounds, and then decreases with the formation of the stage I compound (LiC 6). During delithiation, unconstrained electrodes contract, recovering nearly their original size. In constrained electrodes during delithation, however, the compressive stress is first relaxed, and then a tensile stress develops and is subsequently relaxed. The tensile stress leads to an apparent softening of the composite electrode over a broad range of electrode potential and capacity. At the end of one complete lithiation/delithiation cycle, the <b>apparent</b> <b>modulus</b> returns to approximately its original value. The evolution of stress, strain, and modulus data provides quantitative information on the coupled electro-chemo-mechanical response of battery electrodes and insight on material strategies to increase battery reliability...|$|E

Nano-indentation and micro-indentation techniques were used in this report to study mechanical {{properties of}} zirconium hydrides (ZrH 1. 83). Hardness, <b>apparent</b> Young's <b>modulus,</b> yield stress and fracture toughness of zirconium hydrides were measured and compared to the values for a zirconium sample.

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{show that}} {{state-of-the-art}} tube models overestimate {{the influence of}} contour length fluctuations (CLF) on the <b>apparent</b> plateau <b>modulus</b> of entangled flexible polymers. The observed inconsistency between the molecular weight dependence of the relaxation time and plateau modulus questions some of the underlying physics and suggests, in particular, that the CLF-based explanation for the zero-shear viscosity vs molecular weight scaling law is not entirely satisfactory...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} study of the damage of laboratory produced granular ice has been started. Damage, defined {{in the present study}} as the change in the <b>apparent</b> elastic <b>modulus</b> resulting from the initiation and propagation of microcracks, has been determined. The tests, conducted under uniaxial stress and moderate confining pressures, used a constant strain rate input as the controlling feedback parameter in a closed-loop machine.
