40|$|In 1987 the NRC {{revised the}} {{material}} control and accounting requirements for NRC licensees authorized to possess {{and use a}} formula quantity (i. e., 5 formula kilograms or more) of strategic special nuclear material. Those revisions issued as 10 CFR 74. 51 - 59 require timely monitoring of in-process inventory and discrete items to detect anomalies potentially indicative of material losses. Timely detection and enhanced loss localization capabilities are beneficial to <b>alarm</b> <b>resolution</b> and also for material recovery {{in the event of}} an actual loss. NUREG- 1280 was issued in 1987 to present criteria that could be used by applicants, licensees, and NRC license reviewers in the initial preparation and subsequent review of fundamental nuclear material control (FNMC) plans submitted in response to the Reform Amendment. This document is also intended for both licensees and license reviewers with respect to FNMC plan revisions. General performance objectives, system capabilities, process monitoring, item monitoring, <b>alarm</b> <b>resolution,</b> quality assurance, and accounting are addressed. This revision to NUREG- 1280 is an expansion of the initial edition, which clarifies and expands upon several topics and addresses issues identified under Reform Amendment implementation experience...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an algorithm that efficiently retrieves audio data similar to an audio query. The proposed method utilises a feature extraction method for acoustical music sequences. The extracted features are grouped by Minimum Bounding Rectangles (MBRs) and indexed {{by means of}} a spatial access method. We also present a novel false <b>alarm</b> <b>resolution</b> method that utilises a reverse order schema while calculating the distance of the query and results, in order to avoid costly operations. Performance evaluation results show that the proposed technique achieves considerable performance improvement in comparison to an existing method...|$|E
40|$|Following the September 11, 2001 {{terrorist}} attacks, {{there was}} concern among maritime security experts that terrorist or criminal organizations that wanted to do harm to the United States could exploit gaps that existed between the various government agencies responsible for maritime security. These gaps resulted {{from a lack of}} clear roles and responsibilities between the agencies where no one organization could easily be identified as having the lead over the other agencies across the range of maritime threat response actions. The Maritime Operational Threat Response (MOTR) Plan, the topic of this thesis, is an attempt to close the gaps by providing an effective framework to coordinate and utilize the unparalleled capabilities of the U. S. Government and enhance the security of the American public. The MOTR Plan is a Federal interagency process to achieve coordinated action and desired national outcomes. Before the creation of the MOTR Plan there was no formal interagency process to address the broad spectrum of maritime threats. The Presidential Directive (PD- 27) Process was used in a limited number of cases, but lacked detailed guidance and a clear framework to coordinate interagency planning and response operations. Since its implementation in October 2005, the MOTR Plan has been successfully employed for hundreds of routine maritime threats and a number of low-frequency/high risk threats. These cases include drug and migrant interdiction, fisheries violations, bomb threats, radiation/nuclear <b>alarm</b> <b>resolution,</b> and piracy. Senior government leaders have heralded the MOTR Plan as a model plan for interagency coordination and cooperation. This thesis focuses on the MOTR Plan and whether it is effective at providing a framework and process to coordinate and leverage the authorities, competencies, and capabilities of the federal government agencies responsible for maritime security. The thesis also provides contextual information, including the importance and complexities of the maritime domain, the primary types of threats that the United States faces in the maritime domain, and the maritime security capabilities that it has to address them. The thesis also discusses maritime security interagency coordination before the MOTR Plan, focusing on the PD- 27 Process, and the inadequacies of this process. by Gary L. Tomasulo Jr. Thesis (M. B.

6000|$|... [63] By {{an act of}} Parliament, the Directors of the East India Company are {{restrained}} from {{acceptance of}} bills drawn, from India, beyond a certain amount, {{without the consent of}} the Commissioners of the Treasury. The late House of Commons, finding bills to an immense amount drawn upon that body by their servants abroad, and knowing their circumstances to be exceedingly doubtful, came to a resolution providently, cautioning the Lords of the Treasury against the acceptance of these bills, until the House should otherwise direct. The Court Lords then took occasion to declare against the resolution as illegal, by the Commons undertaking to direct in the execution of a trust created by act of Parliament. The House, justly <b>alarmed</b> at this <b>resolution,</b> which went to the destruction of the whole of its superintending capacity, and particularly in matters relative to its own province of money, directed a committee to search the journals, and they found a regular series of precedents, commencing from the remotest of those records, and carried on to that day, by which it appeared that the House interfered, by an authoritative advice and admonition, upon every act of executive government without exception, and in many much stronger cases than that which the Lords thought proper to quarrel with.|$|R
