5|$|On 3 November 2006, Litvinenko (under {{the name}} of Edwin Carter) was {{admitted}} for further investigation at Barnet General Hospital, London. After being moved from his local hospital in north London to University College Hospital in central London for intensive care, his blood and urine samples {{were sent to the}} UK's Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE) for testing. Scientists at AWE tested for radioactive poison using gamma spectroscopy. No gamma rays were detected; however, a small spike was noticed at an energy of 803 kilo-electron volts (keV). The BBC reported that by coincidence another scientist, who had worked on Britain's early atomic bomb programme decades before, happened to overhear a discussion about the small spike and recognised it as the gamma ray signal from polonium-210, which was <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> <b>component</b> <b>of</b> early nuclear bombs. On the evening of 22 November, shortly before his death, his doctors were informed the poison was likely to be polonium-210. Further tests on a larger urine sample using spectroscopy designed to detect alpha radiation confirmed the result the following day.|$|E

25|$|The first {{well-documented}} {{description of}} a polyalphabetic cipher was formulated by Leon Battista Alberti around 1467 and used a metal cipher disc to switch between cipher alphabets.

Later, in 1508, Johannes Trithemius, in his work Poligraphia, invented the tabula recta, <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> <b>component</b> <b>of</b> the Vigenère cipher.

25|$|As <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> <b>component</b> <b>of</b> {{restoring}} native riparian communities, restoration practitioners {{often have}} to remove invasive species and prevent them from reestablishing.

Ensuring the establishment of native species is considered vital in preventing future colonizations of exotic plants.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1930s, <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> <b>component</b> <b>of</b> the Democratic Party {{coalition}} has been organized labor.

This trend is depicted in the following graph from the book, Democrats and Republicans—Rhetoric and Reality. It is based on surveys conducted by the National Election Studies (NES).|$|E
50|$|Because {{of their}} initial {{disregard}} for reconnaissance, all belligerents {{shared in the}} failure to develop and field a dedicated, survivable air reconnaissance platform, although they belatedly recognized the need therefore. As a result, nearly all recon aircraft were converted combat aircraft, and the proposed dedicated U.S. types (F-11 and F-13) were canceled after the peace. Soon after the war, the CIA did develop such a dedicated aircraft, the U-2. From 1945 aerial reconnaissance became <b>a</b> <b>critical,</b> high-priority <b>component</b> <b>of</b> national security in both the U.S. and Britain.|$|R
30|$|The {{averaging}} process, typically {{applied to}} construct population-based atlases, washes away the actual anatomical information. Consider, for instance, arterial variants {{of the circle}} of Willis (CoW). Averaging of the variants of an incomplete CoW in 3 D results in a complete averaged CoW with lost information on variants’ variability. To avoid this problem in a population-based atlas, we have proposed to include all the variants and present individually each {{of them in the}} context of a single reference deterministic atlas [16]. These examples illustrate that a detailed anatomical atlas is <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> <b>component,</b> independent <b>of</b> and not replaceable by a population-based atlas.|$|R

25|$|Discovery of the M–σ {{relation}} {{was taken}} by many astronomers to imply that supermassive black holes are fundamental components of galaxies.

This led to the main uses of the relation to estimate black hole masses in galaxies that are too distant for direct mass measurements to be made, and to assay the overall black hole content of the Universe.|$|E
25|$|Reliability {{engineering}} is {{the discipline of}} ensuring a system meets customer expectations for reliability throughout its life; i.e., it does not fail more frequently than expected.

40|$|Background: Myelin protein zero (MPZ) is <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> {{structural}} <b>component</b> <b>of</b> myelin in {{the peripheral}} nervous system. The MPZ gene is regulated, in part, by the transcription factors SOX 10 and EGR 2.

Methodology: We utilized a combination of multi-species sequence comparisons, transcription factor-binding site predictions, targeted human DNA re-sequencing, and in vitro and in vivo enhancer assays to study human non-coding MPZ variants. Principal Findings: Our efforts revealed a variant within the first intron of MPZ that resides within a previously describe...|$|R
