5|$|Beginning roughly in 1992, {{three years}} after the RJR Nabisco buyout, and {{continuing}} {{through the end of the}} decade the private equity industry once again experienced a tremendous boom, both in venture capital (<b>as</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> discussed below) and leveraged buyouts with the emergence of brand name firms managing multibillion-dollar sized funds. After declining from 1990 through 1992, the private equity industry began to increase in size raising approximately $20.8 billion of investor commitments in 1992 and reaching a high-water mark in 2000 of $305.7 billion, outpacing the growth of almost every other asset class.|$|E

25|$|The camera matrix derived {{here may}} appear trivial {{in the sense}} that it {{contains}} very few non-zero elements.

25|$|<b>As</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> apparent, the {{original}} numbering scheme {{was a simple}} chronological sequence, although Stroudley tank no. 16 was built {{as a replacement for}} {{the original}} Findhorn branch engine and received its number.

25|$|The Introduction {{became the}} basis for {{subsequent}} books in hadith terminology. A number of subsequent scholars followed Ibn al-Ṣalāḥ in the ordering of his book, including al-Nawawī, Ibn Kathīr, al-ʻIraqi, al-Bulqīnī, Ibn al-Jamā`ah, al-Tabrīzī, al-Ṭībī and al-Zirkashī. In many instances this influence was direct, with numerous scholars authoring books indicating its finer points, explaining and abridging it and converting its meanings to poetry which then, in turn, was explained <b>as</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> discussed below.|$|E
25|$|It is {{therefore}} possible to deduce {{that the energy}} produced by hydrolysis is {{used to create a}} true “stationary state”, that is a flux, instead of a simple equilibrium, one that is dynamic, polar and attached to the filament. This justifies the expenditure of energy as it promotes essential biological functions. In addition, the configuration of the different monomer types is detected by actin binding proteins, which also control this dynamism, <b>as</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> described in the following section.|$|E

25|$|This {{definition}} of cofinality {{relies on the}} axiom of choice, as it uses {{the fact that every}} non-empty set of cardinal numbers has a least member. The cofinality of a partially ordered set A can alternatively be defined as the least ordinal x such that there is a function from x to A with cofinal image. This second definition makes sense without the axiom of choice. If the axiom of choice is assumed, <b>as</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> the case in the rest of this article, then the two definitions are equivalent.|$|E
25|$|Bridge 15 {{was built}} ca. 1910 as a {{replacement}} for a wooden bridge formerly at the same location. During this time, the Third Welland Canal was still in use, however the need for expansion of the canal had been recognized. Accordingly, any new bridges were being constructed to standards which were expected to apply to the Fourth Welland Canal, which would not be completed until 1932. <b>As</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> discussed later in this article, these standards were not set high enough and this fact would make the swing bridge a serious hazard to navigation decades down the road.|$|E
25|$|Conversely, given a prime ideal P of O'F, a {{discrete}} valuation {{can be defined}} by setting vP(x) = n where n is the biggest integer such that x ∈ P'n, the n-fold power of the ideal. This valuation {{can be turned into}} an ultrametric place. Under this correspondence, (equivalence classes) of ultrametric places of F correspond to prime ideals of O'F. For F = Q, this gives back Ostrowski's theorem: any prime ideal in Z (which is necessarily by a single prime number) corresponds to a non-Archimedean place and vice versa. However, for more general number fields, the situation becomes more involved, <b>as</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> explained below.|$|E

25|$|All Liouville {{numbers are}} transcendental, <b>as</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> proven below. Establishing {{that a given}} number is a Liouville number {{provides}} {{a useful tool for}} proving a given number is transcendental. However, not every transcendental number is a Liouville number. The terms in the continued fraction expansion of every Liouville number are unbounded; using a counting argument, one can then show that there must be uncountably many transcendental numbers which are not Liouville. Using the explicit continued fraction expansion of e, one can show that e {{is an example of a}} transcendental number that is not Liouville. Mahler proved in 1953 that π is another such example.|$|E
500|$|From October 1, 1804 until July 4, 1805, {{administrative}} {{powers of the}} istrict of Louisiana were extended to the governor and judges of Indiana Territory as a temporary measure to govern the newly purchased lands.

500|$|An editor, James Kirke Paulding, {{tried to}} assist him in {{publishing}} this collection. However, Paulding reported back to Poe that the publishers at Harper & Brothers declined the collection, saying that readers were looking for simple, long works like novels. They suggested, [...] "if he will lower himself {{a little to the}} ordinary comprehension of the generality of readers, and prepare... a single work... they will make such arrangements with him <b>as</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> liberal and satisfactory." [...] They suggested [...] "if other engagements permit... undertake a Tale in a couple volumes, for that is the magical number." [...] The response from Harper & Brothers inspired Poe to begin a long work and began writing The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket. [...] Poe arranged with his boss at the Southern Literary Messenger to publish his novel in several serialized installments at a pay rate of $3 per page.|$|E
