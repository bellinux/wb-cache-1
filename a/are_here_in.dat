25|$|The theatre-going public needed escapist {{entertainment}} {{during the}} dark times of World War I, and they {{flocked to the}} theatre. The 1919 hit musical Irene ran for 670 performances, a Broadway record that held until 1938. The British theatre public supported far longer runs like that of Maid of the Mountains (1,352 performances) and especially Chu Chin Chow. Its run of 2,238 performances was {{more than twice as}} long as any previous musical, setting a record that stood for nearly forty years. Revues like The Bing Boys <b>Are</b> <b>Here</b> <b>in</b> Britain, and those of Florenz Ziegfeld and his imitators in America, were also extraordinarily popular.|$|E

500|$|The Texian cavalry joined their infantrymen. [...] Burleson's father, James Burleson, led a cavalry {{advance on}} the Mexican position, yelling, [...] "Boys, we have but once to die, they <b>are</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> the ditch. [...] Charge them!" [...] The Mexican {{artillery}} fired three times, driving the Texians back. [...] Three times the Mexican cavalry attempted {{to take a}} small rise to give the artillery better position; they were repulsed. [...] The Mexican infantry then attacked. [...] Rusk wrote of the Mexican attack: [...] "These men advanced with great coolness and bravery under a destructive fire from our men, preserving... strict order and exhibiting no confusion." [...] The infantry abandoned their charge when they realized that Texian James Swisher had led a band of cavalry {{to try to take}} the Mexican cannon. [...] The Mexican forces then withdrew towards Béxar.|$|E

500|$|Bromwich {{noted that}} Hazlitt's thoughts, {{particularly}} {{as applied to}} Lear, <b>are</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> line with those of Shelley in his Defence of Poetry. Bromwich also noted that for Hazlitt {{the power of this}} play is achieved by Shakespeare's unwillingness to soften the harshness of [...] "nature", as expressed in Lear's halting, broken outcries, such as [...] "I will have such revenges on you both, /That all the world shall——". This approach is never quite followed by even so great a contemporary poet as Wordsworth. To Hazlitt, this is a demonstration of why the greatest poetry of his own age failed to achieve the level of greatness that Shakespeare reached here. That King Lear is strongest in subordinating the artistry of dramatic poetry to the power of nature is also why its kind of poetry is superior to the more artificial kind produced by Pope.|$|E
500|$|Before long, {{all three}} of her daughters became active with the WSPU. Christabel was arrested after {{spitting}} at a policeman during {{a meeting of the}} Liberal Party in October 1905; Adela and Sylvia were arrested a year later during a protest outside Parliament. Pankhurst was arrested {{for the first time in}} February 1908, when she tried to enter Parliament to deliver a protest resolution to Prime Minister H. H. Asquith. She was charged with obstruction and sentenced to six weeks in prison. She spoke out against the conditions of her confinement, including vermin, meagre food, and the [...] "civilised torture of solitary confinement and absolute silence" [...] to which she and others were ordered. Pankhurst saw imprisonment as a means to publicise the urgency of women's suffrage; in June 1909 she struck a police officer twice in the face to ensure she would be arrested. Pankhurst was arrested seven times before women's suffrage was approved. During her trial on 21 October 1908 she told the court: [...] "We are here not because we are law-breakers; we <b>are</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> our efforts to become law-makers." ...|$|E
500|$|George did not {{consider}} the peace with France as real; in his view it was an [...] "experiment". In 1803, the war resumed but public opinion distrusted Addington to lead the nation in war, and instead favoured Pitt. An invasion of England by Napoleon seemed imminent, and a massive volunteer movement arose to defend England against the French. George's review of 27,000 volunteers in Hyde Park, London, on 26 and 28 October 1803 and {{at the height of}} the invasion scare, attracted an estimated 500,000 spectators on each day. The Times said, [...] "The enthusiasm of the multitude was beyond all expression." [...] A courtier wrote on 13 November that, [...] "The King is really prepared to take the field in case of attack, his beds are ready and he can move at half an hour's warning". George wrote to his friend Bishop Hurd, [...] "We <b>are</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> daily expectation that Bonaparte will attempt his threatened invasion... Should his troops effect a landing, I shall certainly put myself at the head of mine, and my other armed subjects, to repel them." [...] After Admiral Lord Nelson's famous naval victory at the Battle of Trafalgar, the possibility of invasion was extinguished.|$|E
