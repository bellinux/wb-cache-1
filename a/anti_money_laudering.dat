The second part sheds light on global efforts to combat money laundering and also domestic efforts via various established agencies to eradicate money laundering and terrorist financing. The third chapter analyses the Nigerian <b>anti</b> <b>money</b> laundering regimes as it has metamorphosed since 1989. Major provisions and differences are identified. The fourth chapter contains the effect of money laundering and terrorist financing, the weakness of the Nigeria <b>anti</b> <b>money</b> laundering regime.

40|$|An {{embedded}} Banking Security Level Index (B-SLI) and Aimed Control (AC) {{scheme for}} banking systems is proposed in this paper. In this design the B-SLI and AC <b>anti</b> <b>money</b> laundering techniques are fused together {{and used in}} sequence to expose a threat and subsequently ameliorate the security level of banking. The potential implementation of the B-SLI/AC template is then evaluated using the Vroom-Yetton-Jago contingency model. Study concludes that the B-SLI/AC scheme can be implemented as a focused collaborative effort that will increase the reporting entities willingness to commit to the <b>anti</b> <b>money</b> laundering effort. This approach draws on our previous research and {{it is part of}} the Idei_ 822 project. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the <b>Anti</b> <b>Money</b> Laundering {{reporting}} regime in Bangladesh. The study scrutinised the activities of the major components of the <b>Anti</b> <b>Money</b> Laundering reporting system, which is comprised of the reporting entities, the Financial Intelligence Unit and the law enforcement agencies. Furthermore, the study identified the core concern of the persons involved in the reporting process and how this concern was continually being handled. Data was collected for this study through various methods including interviews, literature searches and observations. In order to study this substantive area where little research had been done, the analyst utilised a Grounded Theory approach to data collection and conceptualisation. This methodology emphasises the patterns of behaviour of people that indicate a social process that revolves around something relevant and problematic for those involved. It was found that the main concern of the persons engaged in the reporting system was the information deficiency caused by a poor inter-agency information sharing culture. Since timely access to useful information is at the centre of an <b>anti</b> <b>money</b> laundering reporting system, the persons involved, described in this study as <b>anti</b> <b>money</b> laundering professionals, must find alternative ways to fill the deficiency that hinders their day-today work. As they are part of a system that cannot be changed overnight, they must improvise. While this improvisation indicated a number of positive things, including the enthusiasm of the persons concerned to defeat a poorly-functioning system, it was also revealed that makeshift initiatives taken by inadequately trained personnel can result in only partial success. At the end, the study proposed a hypothesis that argued that this phenomenon of a shortage of useful information in the <b>anti</b> <b>money</b> laundering reporting system was actually a part of a general information deficiency in the overall bureaucracy. There was a shortage of both supply of and demand for good quality information. This situation could be comparable to the ‘vicious circle of poverty’ and ‘problem of capital formation’ in developing countries. Therefore, it will be interesting to see if a synchronised increase in the both demand for and supply of information using existing resources could provide an escape from the deadlock...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} <b>anti</b> <b>money</b> {{laundering}} {{policy of the}} international financial regime is analyzed in principal agent model perspective. The strategy of the principal for formal agents is deliberated for global financial stability. This strategy encompasses incentive and dis-incentive for cooperation of formal agent. Formal agent by cooperating with principal may induce dis-incentive for informal agent. All the integrating stake holders make decision {{on the basis of}} comparison of present value of marginal cost of non-cooperation and present value of returns from cooperation. As the desired objective of the principal is to minimize transaction of money through informal channels therefore it has to include informal agents and clients in the strategy. The successful <b>anti</b> <b>money</b> laundering strategy can only be evolved by the cooperation of all the stakeholders. ...|$|R

40|$|Money {{laundering}} presents {{challenges to}} legislators, both in South Africa and globally, considering that its use ranges from criminal syndicates profiting from criminal activities to financiers of terrorist activities.

40|$|Money {{laundering}} is {{a criminal}} activity to disguise black money as white money. It is a process by which illegal funds and assets are converted into legitimate funds and assets. Money Laundering occurs in three stages: Placement, Layering, and Integration. It leads to various criminal activities like Political corruption, smuggling, financial frauds, etc. In India there is no successful <b>Anti</b> <b>Money</b> laundering techniques which are available. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), has issued guidelines to identify the suspicious transactions {{and send it to}} Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU). FIU verifies if the transaction is actually suspicious or not. This process is time consuming and not suitable to identify the illegal transactions that occurs in the system. To overcome this problem we propose an efficient <b>Anti</b> <b>Money</b> Laundering technique which can able to identify the traversal path of the Laundered money using Hash based Association approach and successful in identifying agent and integrator in the layering stage of Money Laundering by Graph Theoretic Approach. ...|$|R
40|$|We analyse the {{accomplishment}} rates of <b>anti</b> <b>money</b> laundering {{recommendations of the}} Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in the five Andean countries between 1989 and 1999.

We also identify the main money laundering channels adopted in each country and find a correspondence between the lack of specific domestic legislation and the development of specific local money laundering techniques. Finally, with an econometric test on money demand, we observe that a stricter FATF compliance relative to neighbouring countries has significant negative effects on excess domestic cash balances, net of the positive effect generated by the higher compliance per se. Our policy advice is therefore that a coordinated <b>anti</b> <b>money</b> laundering action is urgently needed in order to avoid such externalitie...|$|R
