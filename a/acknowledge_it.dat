5|$|The Shakespeare authorship {{question}} is the argument that someone other than William Shakespeare of Stratford-upon-Avon wrote the works attributed to him. Anti-Stratfordians—a collective term for adherents of the various alternative-authorship theories—believe that Shakespeare of Stratford was a front to shield {{the identity of the}} real author or authors, who for some reason did not want or could not accept public credit. Although the idea has attracted much public interest, all but a few Shakespeare scholars and literary historians consider it a fringe belief and, for the most part, <b>acknowledge</b> <b>it</b> only to rebut or disparage the claims.|$|E

As and when the artist exhibits creativity, the audience <b>acknowledge</b> <b>it</b> by clapping their hands. With experienced artists, towards the middle of the concert, requests start flowing in. The artist usually sings the requests, and it helps in exhibiting the artist's broad knowledge of the several thousand kritis that are in existence.|$|E
25|$|Bartholomew Asakura {{was a young}} {{conductor}} that Hakuto's conductor had scouted. When Hane's mother died, {{she turned}} to him for comfort. He uses her love for him to teach her violin techniques. However, after the fire accident, he disappeared from Hane's life. He is known for his genius in teaching his students but they usually commit suicide or their lives ruined after Bartholomew is done with them. After he becomes the conductor of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, he attempts to make Reiji join him.

25|$|Bobby Sanabria {{mentions}} several innovations of Machito's Afro-Cubans, citing them as {{the first}} band: to wed big band jazz arranging techniques within an original composition, with jazz oriented soloists utilizing an authentic Afro-Cuban based rhythm section in a successful manner; to explore modal harmony (a concept explored much later by Miles Davis and Gil Evans) from a jazz arranging perspective; and to overtly explore the concept of clave counterpoint from an arranging standpoint (the ability to weave seamlessly {{from one side of}} the clave to the other without breaking its rhythmic integrity within the structure of a musical arrangement). They were also the first band in the United States to publicly utilize the term Afro-Cuban as the band's moniker, thus identifying itself and acknowledging the West African roots of the musical form they were playing. It forced New York City's Latino and African-American communities to deal with their common West African musical roots in a direct way, whether they wanted to <b>acknowledge</b> <b>it</b> publicly or not.|$|E
25|$|By re-establishing a {{continuous}} front on Army Group South's left flank, the 4th Panzer Army and the 8th Army {{had for the}} moment, blunted a deadly thrust, but {{to the north and}} southeast fresh blows had already been dealt or were in the making. Employing the peculiar rippling effect that marked their offensives, the Red Army, thwarted in one place, had shifted to others. For {{the first time in the}} war they had the full strategic initiative, and they used it well. The failure of Operation Citadel meant the Germans permanently lost the strategic initiative on the Eastern Front without any hope of regaining it, although Hitler refused to <b>acknowledge</b> <b>it.</b> The large manpower losses of the Wehrmacht in July and August 1943 severely restricted both Army Groups South & Centre to react to future thrusts during the winter and 1944. Operations Polkovodets Rumyantsev, along with the concurrent Operation Kutuzov marked the first time in the war that the Germans were not able to defeat a major Soviet offensive during the summer and regain their lost ground and the strategic initiative.|$|E
25|$|In March 2008, The Washington Post {{reported}} {{on a series of}} emails in early 2007 between HUD assistant secretaries Kim Kendrick and Orlando J. Cabrera that suggested that HUD leadership sought to punish Carl R. Greene, the director of the Philadelphia Housing Authority (PHA). On the date these e-mails were sent, HUD notified the housing authority that it had been found in violation of rules requiring that 5 percent of housing be accessible to disabled residents. The department later argued that because the authority refused to <b>acknowledge</b> <b>it</b> was in violation and to agree to a specific remedy, it was in violation of a broader agreement that put $50 million in federal funding in jeopardy. Greene, who later was forced to resign from the Philadelphia Housing Authority due to numerous accusations of wrongdoings, asserted that the HUD actions were in retaliation against PHA because Greene had refused to turn over property to Universal Community Homes, a development company founded by Kenny Gamble; Greene said that Universal had not performed as promised. Gamble complained to Jackson about the situation in 2006.|$|E

The S.H.I.E.L.D. announcement was seen to be overly ambitious for the series given the MCU films are considered unlikely to ever <b>acknowledge</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

500|$|Beadle {{agreed with}} Smith that a deal ending UDI without any prior {{agreement}} on the replacement constitution would meet with widespread opposition among white Rhodesians, but still felt that Salisbury should agree.

Smith refused to make such a commitment, much to the disappointment of Beadle and Gibbs, and signed the final document only to <b>acknowledge</b> <b>it</b> as an accurate record. Wilson was furious with Beadle, feeling that he should have taken a far firmer line to persuade Smith to settle; after Beadle left the meeting, Wilson said that he [...] "could not understand how any man could have a slipped disc whom Providence had failed to provide with a backbone". Beadle and Gibbs urged Smith to reconsider during the journey home, but made little headway.|$|E
500|$|After {{searching the}} castle, Jonathan and Charlotte obtain the Sanctuary spell, a magical attack that dispels curses {{and allows the}} dead to rest in peace.

[...] After Jonathan passes the test and defeats the Memory of the Whip, an entity bearing the likeness of Richter Belmont, he is warned against overusing it, as the Vampire Killer drains life force of a non-Belmont wielding the full power, eventually killing the user as it did Jonathan's father. [...] After the twins are defeated, they open a passage leading to a massive storeroom that contains a portrait leading to Brauner's studio. [...] The two confront Brauner and defeat him. [...] When confronted about his acts, he admits justice wasn't on his side, but refuses to <b>acknowledge</b> <b>it</b> was on the heroes'. [...] Death suddenly hovers from above, and kills Brauner with one swing of his scythe. [...] This act destroys the painting sealing the Throne Room, and Jonathan and Charlotte then go to battle with Dracula.|$|E
