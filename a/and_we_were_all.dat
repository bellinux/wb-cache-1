It was like a silent movie <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> in it."

500|$|McIlrath {{wrote the}} video treatment, and remarked how the band at first {{had no idea}} {{what they wanted to do}} for the video due to the song's unique sound. McIlrath did know that since [...] "Swing Life Away" [...] has simple lyrics, he wanted the video to {{replicate}} the song's easygoing feel. The video was shot over a year after the release of Siren Song Of The Counter Culture, a rarity in the music industry, as most videos are shot only a few months after the song's parent album is released. Parts of the video were filmed at The Fireside Bowl, where Rise Against played some of their first concerts. Looking back on the video, McIlrath said: [...] "Parts of it are kind of cheesy...but it captured where I was at when that song was written - it was written when I was living in a house with four roommates in a bedroom <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> just trying to figure out what to do with our lives." ...|$|E
500|$|Saiz {{wanted to}} keep the video mostly in the moment without much narrative; he said, [...] " [...] wanted it to be more about the girls, doing the {{performance}} with Beyoncé taking a backseat as a kind of madam character"; in order to convey that idea, the singer does not sing the song's lyrics in the video. He envisioned the clip as being [...] "sexy and provocative, but not so overt", leaning to more sophisticated visuals. In an interview with New York magazine, Saiz affirmed that there are many references to 1990s eroticism and the 1995 video for [...] "Human Nature" [...] by American singer Madonna in the clip for [...] "Yoncé". Elaborating further on the video shoot, Saiz told BuzzFeed, [...] "The girls were incredible. Everyone kind of checked whatever ego at the door <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> there to make something fun and special." [...] He described the cast as being [...] "spontaneous and not at all contrived". Joan Smalls revealed during an interview that the crew did not follow a certain script while filming and added it was [...] "up for interpretation" [...] - she mentioned the scene where she licks Beyoncé's breast as her own idea, getting inspiration from the song's lyrics.|$|E
500|$|One day, Lazzara was {{checking}} his emails {{and saw the}} phrase [...] "Best Places to Be a Mom" [...] roll across the news ticker. He thought it was [...] "funny and in context it is". The track {{started out as a}} slow song before being sped up by Reyes. [...] "Sad Savior" [...] feature Nolan playing a 1950s Buddy Holly-esque guitar riff reminding Lazzara that he had missed John Nolan's guitar playing:"...I missed ... John's guitar playing, especially coupled with Eddie 's." [...] Lazzara said, [...] "Money (Let It Go)" [...] has a James Bond [...] "kind of spy/surf-y vibe" [...] and features a [...] "really cool surf-y solo" [...] by Nolan. O'Connell created the chord progression for [...] "This Is All Now", while Nolan came up with the melody for the song's chorus. The track's lyrics went through three or four different drafts. Lazzara said it was about the group's relationship with [...] "faith and growing up {{in and out of the}} church". The band referred to the bridge in [...] "Since You're Gone" [...] as the [...] "Beatles bridge" [...] because it was [...] "very unlike us," [...] according to Lazzara. Lazzara described [...] "Call Me in the Morning" [...] a [...] "ballady kind of sentimental tune". When the group recorded the track, they sat in a circle [...] "with this crazy microphone in the middle <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> playing together". [...] "You Were Right" [...] started as an acoustic song, written by Nolan.|$|E

This weekend {{we had a}} big party, a big YMCMB party, and Drake was {{performing}} <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> up on the stage and Wayne got up there and he announced it himself. And so I was kind of surprised and I was like, 'Oh my gosh, this is awesome!'" [...] Milian is currently recording her fourth album. [...] "We're just getting started on it," [...] she said. [...] "I've already halfway gotten there and when my mom and I went to Wayne and we played him some of the music, off the second song, he was like, 'I love it. Let's do this deal.' I have some music that's already going to be on it and the second half I'm working with them now. [...] When they did a little background check, they saw even the songwriting, {{all that kind of stuff}} adds on top of, alright, she's an actress, she's a pretty face, she can actually sing, but not to mention she's a songwriter. I thought that was cool that they even saw that. [...] They all get on each other's records, so all I have to do is be home with everybody and we'll just do lots of features." ...|$|E

A journalist who visited the Villa in 1942 described Bunin as a [...] "skinny and emaciated man, looking like an ancient patrician". For Bunin, though, this isolation was a blessing and he refused to re-locate to Paris where conditions might have been better. [...] "It takes 30 minutes of climbing to reach our villa, but there's not another view {{in the whole world}} like the one that's facing us," [...] he wrote.

So my agent found Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore… When I read it I liked it a lot. I sent it to Warner Brothers and they agreed to do it. Then they asked who I wanted to direct it. I said that I didn't know, but I wanted somebody new and young and exciting. I called Francis Coppola and asked who was young and exciting and he said 'Go look at a movie called Mean Streets and see what you think.' It hadn't been released yet, so I booked a screening to look at it and I felt that it was exactly what…Alice needed, because [...] was a wonderful script and well written, but for my taste it was a little slick.

2500|$|Three weeks later, on 30 April 1864, {{the measure}} of devotion to the Hauhau {{movement}} displayed itself in the reckless march by 200 warriors on the Sentry Hill redoubt, 9km north-east of New Plymouth, in a one-sided battle that cost the lives of possibly {{a fifth of the}} Māori force. The redoubt had been built in late 1863 by Captain W. B. Messenger and 120 men of the Military Settlers on the crown of a hill that was the site of an ancient pā, and garrisoned by a detachment of 75 men from the 57th Regiment under Captain Shortt, with two Coehorn mortars. The construction of the outpost was regarded by the Atiawa as a challenge, being built close to the Māori position at Manutahi and on their land. In April 1864 a war party was formed of the best fighting men from the west coast iwi that had joined the rapidly spreading Hauhau movement.
