[...] Given the [...] "law" [...] of diminishing marginal utility, or otherwise given convex indifference curves, the rates are such that the willingness to forgo money for the good or service decreases as the buyer would have ever more of the good or service and ever less money.

60|$|Let us suppose in {{any country}} a {{circulating}} medium purely metallic, and a sudden casual increase made to it; for example, by bringing into circulation hoards of treasure, which had been concealed in a previous period of foreign invasion or internal disorder. The natural effect would be a rise of prices. This would check exports and encourage imports; the imports would exceed the exports, the exchanges would become unfavorable, and a newly acquired stock of money would diffuse itself over all countries with which the supposed country carried on trade, and from them, progressively, through {{all parts of the}} commercial world. The money which thus overflowed would spread itself to an equal depth over all commercial countries. For it would go on flowing until the exports and imports again balanced one another; and this (as no change is supposed in the permanent circumstances of international demand) could only be when the money had diffused itself so equally that prices had risen in the same ratio in all countries, so that the alteration of price would be for all practical purposes ineffective, and the exports and imports, though at a higher money valuation, would be exactly the same as they were originally. This diminished value of money throughout the world (at least if the diminution was considerable) would cause a suspension, or at least a diminution, of the annual supply from the mines, since the metal would no longer command a value equivalent to its highest cost of production. The annual waste would, therefore, not be fully made up, and the usual causes of destruction would gradually reduce the <b>aggregate</b> <b>quantity</b> of the precious metals to its former amount; after which their production would recommence on its former scale. The discovery of the treasure would thus produce only temporary effects; namely, a brief disturbance of international trade until the treasure had disseminated itself through the world, and then a temporary depression {{in the value of the}} metal below that which corresponds to the cost of producing or of obtaining it; which depression would gradually be corrected by a temporarily diminished production in the producing countries and importation in the importing countries.|$|E

60|$|When {{these two}} {{fundamental}} laws of society, {{the security of}} property, and the institution of marriage, were once established, inequality of conditions must necessarily follow. Those who were born after the division of property would come into a world already possessed. If their parents, from having too large a family, could not give them sufficient for their support, what are they {{to do in a}} world where everything is appropriated? We have seen the fatal effects that would result to a society, if every man had a valid claim to an equal share of the produce of the earth. The members of a family which was grown too large for the original division of land appropriated to it could not then demand a part of the surplus produce of others, as a debt of justice. It has appeared, that from the inevitable laws of our nature some human beings must suffer from want. These are the unhappy persons who, in the great lottery of life, have drawn a blank. The number of these claimants would soon exceed the ability of the surplus produce to supply. Moral merit is a very difficult distinguishing criterion, except in extreme cases. The owners of surplus produce would in general seek some more obvious mark of distinction. And it seems both natural and just that, except upon particular occasions, their choice should fall upon those who were able, and professed themselves willing, to exert their strength in procuring a further surplus produce; and thus at once benefiting the community, and enabling these proprietors to afford assistance to greater numbers. All who were in want of food would be urged by imperious necessity to offer their labour in exchange for this article so absolutely essential to existence. The fund appropriated to the maintenance of labour would be the <b>aggregate</b> <b>quantity</b> of food possessed by the owners of land beyond their own consumption. When the demands upon this fund were great and numerous, it would naturally be divided in very small shares. Labour would be ill paid. Men would offer to work for a bare subsistence, and the rearing of families would be checked by sickness and misery. On the contrary, when this fund was increasing fast, when it was great in proportion to the number of claimants, it would be divided in much larger shares. No man would exchange his labour without receiving an ample quantity of food in return. Labourers would live in ease and comfort, and would consequently be able to rear a numerous and vigorous offspring.|$|E

40|$|Consider {{a network}} where all nodes share a single {{broadcast}} domain {{such as a}} wired broadcast network. Nodes take sensor readings but individual sensor readings are {{not the most important}} pieces of data in the system. Instead, we are interested in <b>aggregated</b> <b>quantities</b> of the sensor readings such as minimum and maximum values, the number of nodes and the median among a set of sensor readings on different nodes.

In this context, we propose a distributed algorithm that has a very low time and message-complexity for computing certain <b>aggregated</b> <b>quantities.</b> Importantly, we show that if every sensor node knows its geographical location, then sensor data can be interpolated with our novel distributed algorithm, and the message-complexity of the algorithm is independent of the number of nodes.

50|$|The {{standard}} model {{is set up}} as a two-stage game. In the initial stage, the home government is able to enact an export subsidy for the home firm’s output of the homogenous product. In the second stage, the firm of each country chooses the quantity to produce and sell to the third country. Each firm takes the other’s output as given when maximizing profit. The subsidy lowers the home firm’s cost and makes it want to export more for any given export level of the rival. Since the home and foreign products are strategic substitutes, the foreign firm must reduce its output. As the domestic export subsidy increases, <b>aggregate</b> <b>quantity</b> rises, price falls, and the profits of the domestic firm rise while foreign profits decline. In effect, rents are shifted from the foreign firm to the home firm.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) {{games with}} a major player {{and a large number}} of minor players. The major player has a significant influence on others. The minor players individually have negligible impact, but they collectively contribute mean field coupling terms in the individual dynamics and costs. To overcome the dimensionality difficulty and obtain decentralized strategies, the so-called Nash certainty equivalence methodology is applied. The control synthesis is preceded by a state space augmentation via a set of <b>aggregate</b> <b>quantities</b> giving the mean field approximation. Subsequently, within the population limit the LQG game is decomposed into a family of limiting two-player games as each is locally seen by a representative minor player. Next, when solving these limiting two-player games, we impose certain interaction consistency conditions such that the <b>aggregate</b> <b>quantities</b> initially assumed coincide with the ones replicated by the closed loop {{of a large number of}} minor players. This procedure leads to a set of decentralized strategies for the original LQG game, which is an ε-Nash equilibrium...|$|R

40|$|The major {{theoretical}} insight of Keynes’ General Theory is that <b>aggregate</b> <b>quantities</b> {{describing the}} state of an {{economy as a whole}} are irreducible to arithmetic summations of individual decisions. This breaks with the logic of classical political economy and establishes macroeconomics as the study of economy-wide dynamics, logically independent from any underlying theory of individual rationality. However, Keynes does have a theory of individual psychology that links expectations back up to <b>aggregate</b> <b>quantities</b> with robust statistical methods, which account for the fundamental uncertainty one faces in predicting the future. By comparing the theoretical structure of macroeconomics to that of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, this essay proposes a novel reading of Keynes’ epistemology of statistical laws. On this view, statistical methods allow theoreticians to connect the mechanics of vast numbers of micro-scale entities to a macroscale dynamics, {{even in the absence of}} a fully determinate causal story.
