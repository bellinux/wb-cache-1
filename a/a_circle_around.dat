5|$|Cockatoos are {{versatile}} feeders {{and consume}} {{a range of}} mainly vegetable food items. Seeds form {{a large part of}} the diet of all species; these are opened with their large and powerful bills. The galahs, corellas and some of the black cockatoos feed primarily on the ground; others feed mostly in trees. The ground-feeding species tend to forage in flocks, which form tight, squabbling groups where seeds are concentrated and dispersed lines where food is more sparsely distributed; they also prefer open areas where visibility is good. The western and long-billed corellas have elongated bills to excavate tubers and roots and the Major Mitchell's cockatoo walks in <b>a</b> <b>circle</b> <b>around</b> the doublegree (Emex australis) to twist out and remove the underground parts.|$|E
5|$|Planning of the Metro {{started in}} 1992 {{as part of}} the {{redevelopment}} plans for Ørestad with construction starting in 1996, and stage 1, from Nørreport to Vestamager and Lergravsparken, opened in 2002. Stage 2, from Nørreport to Vanløse, opened in 2003, followed by stage 3, from Lergravsparken to Lufthavnen, in 2007. Construction of the M3+M4 City Circle Line is underway. Scheduled to open in 2019, this line will form <b>a</b> <b>circle</b> <b>around</b> the city center, be entirely underground and not share any track with M1 and M2. Kongens Nytorv and Frederiksberg will serve as interchanges between M1, M2 and M3+M4. A two-station branch towards Nordhavn is planned to open in 2019. A planned expansion towards Sydhavn will include a linkup with Ny Ellebjerg on the S-train network (2023). These stations will also be connected to the regional train network following the completion of the new Copenhagen-Ringsted railway. The Sydhavn extension has been approved.|$|E
5|$|The armies gather outside Winterfell {{the next}} morning. Ramsay brings Rickon out and has him run to Jon while firing arrows at him. Jon rushes to {{intercept}} Rickon {{but just before}} escaping, Rickon is killed by an arrow. Jon charges at Ramsay, who orders the Bolton archers to fire and his cavalry to charge; Davos orders the Stark force to shield Jon. The battle leaves hundreds of Bolton and Stark soldiers dead from hand-to-hand combat and from Bolton arrows, creating a wall of corpses. The Bolton infantry forms <b>a</b> <b>circle</b> <b>around</b> the Stark forces. Although the giant Wun Wun kills some Bolton soldiers, Tormund panics and sends the Wildlings towards the wall of bodies and Smalljon's forces, who easily cut them down. Jon is trampled by the Wildlings but struggles to his feet. The Stark forces appear doomed when a horn sounds in the distance as Petyr Baelish and Sansa arrive with the Knights of the Vale, who smash the Bolton army; Tormund kills Smalljon in the chaos.|$|E

25|$|The Sama was practised in the samahane (ritual hall) {{according}} to a precisely prescribed symbolic ritual with the dervishes whirling in <b>a</b> <b>circle</b> <b>around</b> their sheikh, who {{is the only one}} whirling around his axis. The Sama is performed by spinning on the Left foot. The dervishes wear a white gown (tennure) (symbol of death), a wide black cloak (hırka) (symbol of the grave) and a tall brown hat (kûlah or sikke), symbol of the tombstone.|$|E
25|$|Members of {{the church}} also mounted anti-gay protests at the trials of McKinney and Henderson. In response, Romaine Patterson, a friend of Shepard's, {{organized}} a group which assembled in <b>a</b> <b>circle</b> <b>around</b> the Westboro Baptist Church protesters, wearing white robes and gigantic wings (resembling angels) that blocked the protesters, despite Shepard's parents being able to hear the protesters shouting anti-gay remarks and comments at them. Police had to create a human barrier between the two groups. Angel Action was founded by Patterson in April 1999.|$|E
25|$|János Bolyai {{discovered}} a construction {{which gives the}} asymptotic parallel s to a line r passing through a point A not on r. Drop a perpendicular from A onto B on r. Choose any point C on r different from B. Erect a perpendicular t to r at C. Drop a perpendicular from A onto D on t. Then length DA is longer than CB, but shorter than CA. Draw <b>a</b> <b>circle</b> <b>around</b> C with radius equal to DA. It will intersect the segment AB at a point E. Then the angle BEC is independent of the length BC, depending only on AB; it is the angle of parallelism. Construct s through A at angle BEC from AB.|$|E

25|$|The cock {{performs}} {{with his}} wings, alternating wing beats, until he attracts a mate. They {{will go to}} the mating area and he will maintain privacy by driving away all intruders. They graze until their behaviour is synchronized, then the feeding becomes secondary and the process takes on a ritualistic appearance. The cock will then excitedly flap alternate wings again, and start poking on the ground with his bill. He will then violently flap his wings to symbolically clear out a nest in the soil. Then, while the hen runs <b>a</b> <b>circle</b> <b>around</b> him with lowered wings, he will wind his head in a spiral motion. She will drop to the ground and he will mount for copulation. Common ostriches raised entirely by humans may direct their courtship behaviour not at other ostriches, but toward their human keepers.|$|E
25|$|German medieval art really {{begins with}} the Frankish Empire of Charlemagne (d. 814), {{the first state to}} rule the great {{majority}} of the modern territory of Germany, as well as France and much of Italy. Carolingian art was restricted to {{a relatively small number of}} objects produced for <b>a</b> <b>circle</b> <b>around</b> the court and a number of Imperial abbeys they sponsored, but had a huge influence on later Medieval art across Europe. The most common type of object to survive is the illuminated manuscript; wall paintings were evidently common but, like the buildings that housed them, have nearly all vanished. The earlier centres of illumination were located in modern France, but later Metz in Lorraine and the Abbey of Saint Gall in modern Switzerland came to rival them. The Drogo Sacramentary and Folchard Psalter are among the manuscripts they produced.|$|E
25|$|Within various Native American communities, gender {{plays an}} {{important}} role in music. Men and women play sex-specific roles in many musical activities. Instruments, songs and dances are often peculiar to one or the other sex, and many musical settings are strictly controlled by sex. In modern powwows, women play a vital role as backup singers and dancers. The Cherokee people, for example, hold dances before stickball games. At these pre-game events, men and women perform separate dances and follow separate regulations. Men will dance in <b>a</b> <b>circle</b> <b>around</b> a fire, while women dance in place. Men sing their own songs, while women have their songs sung for them by an elder. Whereas the men's songs invoke power, the women's songs draw power away from the opposing stickball team. In some societies, there are customs where certain ceremonial drums are to be played by men only. For the Southern Plains Indians, it is believed that the first drum was given to a woman by the Great Spirit, who instructed her to share it with all women of native nations. However, there also exist prohibitions against women sitting at the Beg Drum.|$|E
