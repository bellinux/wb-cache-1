25|$|Currently, 28 of the U.S. {{states have}} black bear hunting seasons. Nineteen states require a bear hunting license, with some also {{requiring}} <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>game</b> license. In eight states, only <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>game</b> license {{is required to}} hunt black bears. Overall, over 481,500 black bear hunting licences are sold per year. The hunting methods and seasons vary greatly according to state, with some bear hunting seasons including fall only, spring and fall, or year-round. New Jersey, in November 2010, approved a six-day bear-hunting season in early December 2010 to slow {{the growth of the}} black bear population. Bear-hunting had been banned in New Jersey for five years. A Fairleigh Dickinson University PublicMind poll found that 53% of New Jersey voters approved of the new season if scientists concluded black bears were leaving their usual habitats and destroying private property. Men, older voters, and those living in rural areas were more likely to approve of a bear-hunting season in New Jersey than women, younger voters, and those living in more developed parts of the state. In the western states, where there are large black populations, there are spring and year-round seasons. Approximately 18,000 black bears were killed annually in the USA between 1988 and 1992. Within this period, annual kills ranged from six bears in South Carolina to 2,232 in Maine.|$|E
25|$|Cooper {{called in}} James Ashmore Creelman (who {{was working on}} the script of The Most Dangerous Game at the time) and the two men worked {{together}} on several drafts under the title The Eighth Wonder. Some details from Wallace's rough draft were dropped, notably his boatload of escaped convicts. Wallace's Danby Denham character, <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>game</b> hunter, became film director Carl Denham. His Shirley became Ann Darrow and her lover-convict John became Jack Driscoll. The 'beauty and the beast' angle was first developed at this time. Kong's escape was switched from Madison Square Garden to Yankee Stadium and (finally) to a Broadway theater. Cute moments involving the gorilla in Wallace's draft were cut because Cooper wanted Kong hard and tough in the belief that his fall would be all the more awesome and tragic.|$|E
25|$|Cooper {{took his}} concept to Paramount Studios {{in the first}} years of the Great Depression but {{executives}} shied away from a project that sent film crews on costly shoots to Africa and Komodo. In 1931, David O. Selznick brought Cooper to RKO as his executive assistant, and, to sweeten the deal, promised him he could make his own films. Cooper began immediately developing The Most Dangerous Game, a story about <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>game</b> hunter, and hired his friend and former film partner, Ernest B. Schoedsack, to direct. A huge jungle stage set was built, with Robert Armstrong and Fay Wray as the stars. Once the film was underway, Cooper turned his attention to the studio's big-budget-out-of-control fantasy, Creation, a story about a group of travelers shipwrecked on an island of dinosaurs. The film employed special effects wizard Willis O'Brien.|$|E

Notre Dame {{defeated}} Wichita State 81 to 70 {{to set up}} a meeting with Kentucky two nights later. On March 28 Kentucky and Notre Dame met for a berth to the Final Four. In a game that was considered one of the greatest in NCAA Tournament history, Kentucky defeated Notre Dame 68 to 66. Kentucky needed its players to step up in <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>game</b> with such high stakes. Towns was foremost among players stepping up when it mattered most. The 6-foot-11 forward played through foul trouble to score nine of his career-best 25 points over that final stretch, including the game-tying basket in the post with 1:12 left.The big 3 came with 3:15 on the clock. The Cats, {{in the midst of a}} rally after previously trailing by six points with 6:14 to go, trailed by just two when Aaron Harrison pulled up from the right wing. With six seconds left in an Elite Eight matchup with Notre Dame, Andrew Harrison drove and drew a foul on Notre Dame's Demetrius Jackson. Following a timeout called by the Fighting Irish, he toed the line in a 66-66 game and sank two free throws to give Kentucky a 68 to 66 lead. The margin remained intact as Notre Dame's Jerian Grant missed a contested 3-pointer as time expired. The game between Kentucky and Notre Dame was the highest rated college basketball game on cable of all-time.|$|E

Then I wanted to bring the other players on towards the end. It worked and it showed that we have a great squad – better than last season." [...] Crouch, scorer of the winning goal, was also confident the result would boost the Liverpool squad: [...] "There is a bit of rivalry between the sides and it is great to get an early one over them.

Schembechler was often angered by Woolfolk's tendency to try to run around defenders rather than banging through them, resulting in Woolfolk being benched more than once. But Schembechler said Woolfolk [...] "came of age" [...] in the November 1980 Ohio State game.

[...] Woolfolk, too, concluded in the end that Schembechler was [...] "key" [...] to his success: [...] "He kept after me. He kept saying I was getting too fancy.
