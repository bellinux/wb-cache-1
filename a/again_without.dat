5|$|Circle Explorer: Similar to oneworld Explorer, {{but does}} not require travel to North or South America, so you can fly halfway around the globe and then back <b>again,</b> <b>without</b> {{actually}} circumnavigating the planet (for example, London-Hong Kong-Sydney-Johannesburg-London).|$|E
5|$|No batsman scored {{more than}} 33 in England's first innings, as the four quick bowlers shared cheap wickets. In reply, West Indies piled up 384/7, <b>again</b> <b>without</b> a century, {{in a team}} effort down to and {{including}} man-of-the-match Marshall, who scored 43* batting at number eight.|$|E
5|$|Owen was to {{be re-elected}} in 1912, after {{defeating}} a serious primary challenge from former Governor Charles Haskell, and <b>again</b> (<b>without</b> serious challenge) in 1918. He served all told from December 11, 1907 to March 4, 1925. Owen reportedly maintained a mailing list of 300,000 names.|$|E

5|$|Pope Paul VI {{received}} Lefebvre in {{audience on}} 11 September 1976, and {{one month later}} wrote to him admonishing him and, repeating the appeal he had made at the audience. Pope John Paul II received Lefebvre in audience sixty days after his 1978 election, <b>again</b> <b>without</b> reaching agreement.|$|E
5|$|By mid-summer of 1942, Mt. St. Peter Parish {{was once}} <b>again</b> <b>without</b> funds. By this time, the {{majority}} of the work on the new church had been completed and so the congregation agreed {{that it was time to}} sell the old St. Peter Church in order to fund the new church. The General Electric Company was willing to pay $16,000 for St. Peter's and on July 16, 1942, the church became the property of the General Electric Company.|$|E
5|$|In January 1987, Playboy ranked SDSU as the 3rd best party {{school in}} the nation, which appalled some administrators, and amused students. The ranking was {{determined}} {{on a number of}} factors including the education offered at the university, social opportunities, the malefemale ratio, and off-campus activities located near the campus. Some students feared that the ranking would diminish the quality of their degree. In 2002 it dropped to tenth place, and in 2005 was included <b>again</b> <b>without</b> a specific rank, before jumping to fifth place in 2006.|$|E

5|$|To restore {{government}} services, on July 3, 2006, Corzine {{signed an}} executive order calling for an unprecedented Independence Day session of the General Assembly to work on presenting him with a budget. Immediately after listening to the governor's speech, the legislature voted by voice vote to adjourn the session. The General Assembly met <b>again,</b> <b>without</b> proposing a budget, the following day.|$|E
5|$|Albert Edward and Alexandra visited Ireland in April 1868. After {{her illness}} the {{previous}} year, {{she had only}} just begun to walk <b>again</b> <b>without</b> the aid of two walking sticks, and was already pregnant with her fourth child. The royal couple undertook a six-month tour taking in Austria, Egypt and Greece over 1868 and 1869, which included visits to her brother King George I of Greece, to the Crimean battlefields and (for her only) to the harem of the Khedive Ismail. In Turkey {{she became the first}} woman to sit down to dinner with the Sultan (Abdülâziz).|$|E
5|$|BSR Housewares {{became the}} club's first shirt sponsor during the 1981–82 season. The club's shirts have been {{sponsored}} {{for the majority}} of the time since then, although there was no shirt sponsor at the end of the 1993–94 season, after local solicitors Coucher & Shaw were closed down by the Law Society of England and Wales. Unusually for a Premier League club, Albion were <b>again</b> <b>without</b> a shirt sponsor for the start of the 2008–09 campaign, as negotiations with a new sponsor were still ongoing when the season began. The longest-running shirt sponsorship deal agreed by the club ran for seven seasons between 1997 and 2004 with the West Bromwich Building Society. Other sponsors have included T-Mobile (2004–08), Homeserve (2010–11), Bodog (2011–12), Zoopla (2012–14), Intuit Quickbooks (2014–15), TLCBET (2015–16) and K8 group (2016–2017).|$|E

5|$|By early July the Chinese {{launched}} a major offensive in the ROK II Corps and US X Corps sectors. The Americans and South Koreans subsequently {{responded with a}} series of counter-attacks to regain the ground lost, yet these met with only limited success. On 6 July the Chinese attacked elements of the US 7th Division on Porkchop Hill on the US I Corps right flank, and succeeded in gaining the crest. The Americans were reinforced and counter-attacked over the following days, although <b>again</b> <b>without</b> success. Following another Chinese assault on 9 July the Americans again counter-attacked, yet neither side gained a clear advantage. The following day the Chinese {{launched a}} series of company and battalion-sized assaults, but were repulsed. Yet, with the Americans unprepared to accept further casualties for limited tactical gain, they evacuated Porkchop Hill on 11 July.|$|E
5|$|Cross-lingual {{studies were}} {{performed}} at 13 European universities, using 12 different languages, viz. Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek (the {{only one with}} a non-Roman alphabet), Hungarian, Italian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, and Spanish. Because the original yoked design did not lend itself well to long-distance research and standardization, it {{was replaced by a}} simpler, easier to replicate experimental design. Subjects were asked to mark the six capital letters they liked most in a randomized list containing all letters of the local alphabet, <b>again</b> <b>without</b> giving it much thought. They had to mark their first preference with 1, their second with 2, etc. The new method was first applied in Belgium. When results showed the name-letter effect at work again, it was copied in the other countries. A total of 2,047 subjects participated, all students.|$|E
5|$|Dalassenos {{maintained}} an aggressive stance. In 996 his forces raided the environs of Tripoli and Arqa, while Manjutakin, <b>again</b> <b>without</b> success, laid siege to Aleppo and Antartus, but {{was forced to}} withdraw when Dalassenos with his army came to relieve the fortress. The next year, Dalassenos repeated his raids against Tripoli, Rafaniya, Awgh, and al-Lakma, capturing the latter. At the same time, the inhabitants of Tyre, {{under the leadership of}} a sailor named Allaqa, rose up in revolt against the Fatimids and requested Byzantine assistance; further south, in Palestine, the Bedouin leader Mufarrij ibn Daghfal ibn al-Jarrah attacked Ramlah.|$|E
50|$|The Liberals {{were upset}} by the New Democratic Party in the 1990 provincial election, {{although}} Kwinter himself was <b>again</b> re-elected <b>without</b> difficulty.|$|R

5|$|During {{the course}} of the trilogy, Sparrow {{undergoes}} physical transformations. In The Curse of the Black Pearl, Sparrow curses himself to battle the undead Barbossa. Like all the actors playing the Black Pearl crew, Depp had to shoot scenes in costume as a reference for the animators, and his shots as a skeleton were shot <b>again</b> <b>without</b> him. Depp reprised the scene again on a motion capture stage. In At World's End, Sparrow hallucinates a version of himself as a member of Davy Jones's crew, adhered to a wall and encrusted with barnacles. Verbinski oversaw that the design retained Sparrow's distinctive look, and rejected initial designs which portrayed him as over 100 years old.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, {{district}} court judge Ricardo Rodriguez campaigned to unseat Guerra as district attorney, and the Garza case arose as a campaign issue. Rodriguez said that he wanted justice for the Garza family. He {{said that he would}} take a new look at Garza's case if he were elected. Rodriguez won the election. In the days after the vote was announced, Guerra sought to appoint Rodriguez as a special prosecutor in the Garza case. Rodriguez declined, saying that he preferred to take a new look at the evidence once he took control of the district attorney's office in January 2015. In April, he announced that the Garza case was open <b>again.</b> <b>Without</b> mentioning any suspects or elaborating on new evidence, he said that several employees in his office were working on the case.|$|E
5|$|In season eight, Lex {{is missing}} and Tess Mercer (Cassidy Freeman) {{is put in}} charge as Lex's {{hand-picked}} successor. Tess wants Lex found, until Lex is revealed to have a surgically-implanted nano-transmitter in Tess's optic nerve. Wanting revenge, Lex uses a kryptonite bomb to have Lana's stolen bio-enhanced suit, designed to absorb and emit kryptonite radiation, absorb the radiation to de-activate the bomb and subsequently {{never be able to}} go near Clark <b>again</b> <b>without</b> fatal effects. Oliver Queen (Justin Hartley) discovers Lex's location and uses a bomb to blow up Lex's travelling medical transport, seemingly killing him.|$|E

6000|$|... "Thank you," [...] {{said the}} old man. His lips moved <b>again,</b> but <b>without</b> a sound. A strange film had begun to gather in his eyes.|$|R
5|$|In the mid-18th century, Zahir al-Umar, the {{autonomous}} Arab {{ruler of the}} Galilee became a dominant figure in Palestine. In order to build up his army, he strove to gain a monopoly over the cotton and olive oil trade of the southern Levant, including Jabal Nablus, which was a major producer of both crops. In 1771, during the Egyptian Mamluk invasion of Syria, Zahir aligned himself with the Mamluks and besieged Nablus, but {{did not succeed in}} taking the city. In 1773, he tried <b>again</b> <b>without</b> success. Nevertheless, from a political perspective, the sieges led to a decline in the importance of the city in favor of Acre. Zahir's successor, Jezzar Pasha, maintained Acre's dominance over Nablus. After his reign ended in 1804, Nablus regained its autonomy, and the Tuqans, who represented a principal opposing force, rose to power.|$|E
5|$|Leonid Brezhnev awarded Tikhonov the Hero of Socialist Labour, {{after being}} advised {{to do so}} by Konstantin Chernenko. Upon Brezhnev's death in 1982, Tikhonov {{supported}} Chernenko's candidacy for the General Secretaryship. Chernenko lost the vote, and Yuri Andropov became General Secretary. It has been suggested that Andropov had plans of replacing Tikhonov with Heydar Aliyev. Historian William A. Clark noted how Aliyev, a former head of the Azerbaijani KGB, was appointed to the First Deputy Premiership of the Council of Ministers without Tikhonov's consent; however, Andropov's death in 1984 left Tikhonov secure in his office. Some Western analysts speculated that the appointment of Andrei Gromyko to the First Deputy Premiership, <b>again</b> <b>without</b> Tikhonov's consent, was a sign that his position within the Soviet hierarchy was weakened. Tikhonov was on a state visit to Yugoslavia when Gromyko was appointed to the First Deputy Premiership.|$|E
5|$|Lincoln had {{not been}} asked or {{informed}} about either Vallandigham's arrest or {{the closure of the}} Chicago Times. He remembered the section of General Order No. 38 which declared that offenders would be banished to enemy lines and finally decided {{that it was a good}} idea; so Vallandigham was freed from jail and sent to Confederate hands. Meanwhile, Lincoln ordered the Chicago Times to be reopened and announced that Burnside had exceeded his authority in both cases. The President then issued a warning that generals were not to arrest civilians or close down newspapers <b>again</b> <b>without</b> the White House's permission.|$|E
