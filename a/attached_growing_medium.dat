How to let urban cooling strategies {{and how to}} utilize useful building energy savings methods become important goals that all countries need to face to improve. The extensive green roof has become to achieve the aforementioned objectives of counter measures, which of the vegetation and <b>growing</b> <b>medium</b> are playing important roles of extensive green roof. This study aims to investigate the physiological effects of planting on water stress, {{and the effects of}} cooling the roof slab insulation of extensive green roof <b>growing</b> <b>medium,</b> to provide references for medium selection in future extensive green roof. In this study, firstly, the first experiment used chlorophyll fluorescence detection for <b>growing</b> <b>medium</b> on water stress experiment, and observed the planting of the physiological changes. Secondly, through the <b>growing</b> <b>medium</b> physicochemical properties and thermal conductivity coefficients measured by me to investigate the extensive green roof <b>growing</b> <b>medium’s</b> physicochemical properties and heat insulation efficiency. Finally, both of the results have been conducted to be discussion. The results shown that selection for extensive green roof <b>growing</b> <b>medium</b> should be carefully taken into account for the effect of plant physiology, roof insulation efficiency, and roof load problem. The <b>growing</b> <b>medium</b> on water stress experiment results show that when peat moss and vermiculite of the <b>growing</b> <b>medium</b> for C 3 and C 4 plants, the physiological effects are smaller. When using perlite as <b>growing</b> <b>medium</b> on planting CAM plants in flooding treatment had a greater impact. For C 3, C 4 and CAM plants'' physiological effects, using expanded clay as <b>growing</b> <b>medium</b> had a greater impact for plants’ physiological. The heat thermal conductivity measured results have been shown that growing medium''s thermal conductivity in wet state was larger than that in the dry state, and sand’s thermal conductivity in wet state are larger than that of the other kinds of <b>growing</b> <b>medium.</b> Furthermore, vermiculite’s thermal conductivity in wet state was smaller than the other kinds of <b>growing</b> <b>medium.</b> The consolidated on plant physiology, roof insulation, and roof load efficiency considerations for the experiment medium of peat moss and vermiculite as planting medium for the plant physiological effects have been detected smaller. Peat moss and vermiculite’s thermal conductivity variation were stability than that of the other <b>growing</b> <b>medium.</b> Their bulk density was detected to be moderate loading on the roof which would not be caused too much burden to be compared. 第一章 緒論	 1 第一節 研究動機與目的	 1 第二節 研究內容與流程	 4 第二章 文獻回顧	 6 第一節 薄層屋頂綠化與熱傳	 6 一、 屋頂綠化概述	 6 二、 薄層屋頂綠化與熱傳	 10 第二節 介質對薄層屋頂綠化之影響	 16 一、 薄層屋頂綠化常用介質之概述	 16 二、 介質對植栽生長之影響	 20 第三節 薄層屋頂綠化植物與環境逆境之關係	 22 一、 植物與葉綠素螢光之關係	 22 二、 屋頂環境逆境對植物之影響	 28 第三章 研究內容	 30 第一節 研究流程與方法	 31 一、 栽培介質之水分逆境對植物生理之影響試驗	 31 二、 不同含水率之栽培介質對其隔熱效益試驗	 35 第二節 研究限制	 39 第四章 研究結果與討論	 40 第一節 栽培介質之水分逆境對植物生理之影響	 40 一、 不同栽培介質對C 3 植物PSII最大光化學效率之影響	 41 二、 不同栽培介質對C 4 植物PSII最大光化學效率之影響	 48 三、 不同栽培介質對CAM植物PSII最大光化學效率之影響	 55 第二節 不同含水率之栽培介質對其隔熱效益試驗	 62 一、 栽培介質理化特性	 62 二、 熱傳導係數分析	 63 第五章 結論與建議	 65 第一節 結論	 65 一、 栽培介質之水分逆境對植物生理之影響	 65 二、 不同含水率之栽培介質對其隔熱效益影響	 66 三、 綜合探討	 67 第二節 檢討	 68 參考文獻(References) 	 69 附錄	 7...|$|R

Seven <b>growing</b> <b>mediums</b> tested include; five pine bark/lawn clippings/ human urine based compost, a commercial pine bark compost and hygromix (Peat + Polysterene) as the control. The <b>growing</b> <b>mediums</b> were filled into cavity trays, sown with cabbage seeds and arranged in a climate controlled screen house for four weeks. Cabbage seed germination, biomass production and nutrient contents were measured. Germination percentage ranged between 81 - 98 % among unfertilized medium and 72 - 97 % among the fertilized medium. Fertilizer application had slight (3. 7 %) depressive effects on seed germination while Shoot biomass was significantly (P< 0. 01) improved by mediums and fertilizer application. Uptake of N and K were significantly (P< 0. 01) enhanced by fertilizer application, yielding more vigorous transplants, while P uptake was slightly depressed. The interaction of <b>growing</b> <b>mediums</b> and fertilizer application was significant (P< 0. 01), suggesting that the <b>growing</b> <b>mediums</b> released their nutrient content for plant use and biomass production. Pine bark / lawn clipping based <b>growing</b> <b>medium</b> yielded more vigorous transplants compared to the commercially composted pine bark <b>medium.</b> While <b>growing</b> <b>mediums</b> with human urine as supplementary source of N had comparable performance with the commercial hygromix mediums in seedlings germination, nutrient uptake and transplant vigor...|$|R

The constituents of the most attractive <b>growing</b> <b>medium</b> tested were determined by gas chroma-tography analysis using a steam-distillation procedure. We found that fungus gnat adults were more attracted to the <b>growing</b> <b>medium,</b> SB 300 Universal Professional Growing Mix, which contains composted bark, than to another <b>growing</b> <b>medium</b> (Sunshine LC 1 Mix) and their components when tested in a series of laboratory experiments using multiple-choice experimental arenas. A higher percentage of fungus gnat adults were attracted to moist SB 300 (92 %) than SB 300 <b>growing</b> <b>medium</b> that had been oven dried (8 %). In addition, fungus gnat adults preferred SB 300 although they had been reared on Sunshine LC 1 Mix. When comparing the SB 300 fresh from the bag to <b>growing</b> <b>medium</b> that had been pasteurized and moistened with water, gas chromatographic-mass spectroscopic data showed there were declines in several terpenoid constituents as well as an increase in fatty acids and cyclosulfur.

40|$|Treatment of {{agricultural}} biodegradable wastes and by-products {{can be carried}} out using composting or vermicomposting, or a combination of both treatment methods, to create a <b>growing</b> <b>medium</b> amendment suitable for horticultural use. When compared to traditional compost-maturation, vermicompost-maturation resulted in a more mature <b>growing</b> <b>medium</b> amendment i. e. lower C/N and pH, with increased nutrient content and improved plant growth response, increasing lettuce shoot fresh and dry weight by an average of 15 % and 14 %, respectively. Vermicomposted horse manure compost was used as a <b>growing</b> <b>medium</b> amendment for lettuce and was found to significantly increase lettuce shoot and root growth, and chlorophyll content. When used as a <b>growing</b> <b>medium</b> amendment for tomato fruit production, vermicomposted spent mushroom compost increased shoot growth and marketable yield, and reduced blossom end rot in two independent studies. Vermicompost addition to peat-based growing media increased marketable yield by an average of 21 %. Vermicompost also improved tomato fruit quality parameters such as acidity and sweetness. Fruit sweetness, as measured using Brix value, was significantly increased in fruits grown with 10 % or 20 % vermicompost addition by 0. 2 in truss one and 0. 3 in truss two. Fruit acidity (% citric acid) was significantly increased in plants grown with vermicompost by an average of 0. 65 % in truss one and 0. 68 % in truss two. These changes in fruit chemical parameters resulted in a higher tomato fruit overall acceptability rating as determined by a consumer acceptance panel. When incorporated into soil, vermicomposted spent mushroom compost increased plant growth and reduced plant stress under conditions of cold stress, but not salinity or heat stress. The addition of 20 % vermicompost to cold-stressed plants increased plant growth by an average of 30 % and increased chlorophyll fluorescence by an average of 21 %. Compared to peat-based <b>growing</b> <b>medium,</b> vermicompost had consistently higher nutrient content, pH, electrical conductivity and bulk density, and when added to a peat-based <b>growing</b> <b>medium,</b> vermicomposted spent mushroom compost altered the microbial community. Vermicompost amendment increased the microbial activity of the <b>growing</b> <b>medium</b> when incorporated initially, and this increased microbial activity was observed for up to four months after incorporation when plants were grown in it. Vermicomposting was shown to be a suitable treatment method for agricultural biodegradable wastes and by-products, with the resulting vermicompost having suitable physical, chemical and biological properties, and resulting in increased plant growth, marketable yield and yield quality, when used as an amendment in peat-based <b>growing</b> <b>medium...</b>|$|R
