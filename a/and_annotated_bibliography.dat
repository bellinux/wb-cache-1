500|$|Education and Democracy: The Meaning of Alexander Meiklejohn, 1872–1964 is a {{biography}} of Alexander Meiklejohn written by Adam R. Nelson and published by the University of Wisconsin Press in 2001. In lieu of writing a definitive account of Meiklejohn's life, Nelson portrayed Meiklejohn through the subject's own language to let him [...] "speak for himself". Nelson draws on five archives detailed in copious quotations and a 65-page notes <b>and</b> <b>annotated</b> <b>bibliography</b> appendix. While Meiklejohn was popular in the early 20th century and {{best known for his}} stance on academic freedom, he had become a marginal figure by the time this book was published. The book was the first full biography written on Meiklejohn, preceded only by dissertations and a 1981 [...] "short 'biographical study that introduced Meiklejohn's written work. Nelson's title is a response to John Dewey's Democracy and Education. It intends to show the contrast of Meiklejohn's idealism opposite Dewey's pragmatism.|$|E
