5|$|First {{introduced}} in FreeBSD version 4, jails is a security mechanism and an implementation of operating-system-level virtualization {{that enables the}} user to run multiple instances of a guest operating system {{on top of a}} FreeBSD host. It is an enhanced version of the traditional chroot mechanism. A process that runs within such <b>a</b> <b>jail</b> is unable to access the resources outside of it. Every jail has its own hostname and IP address. It is possible to run multiple jails at the same time, but the kernel is shared among all of them. Hence only software supported by the FreeBSD kernel can be run within <b>a</b> <b>jail.</b>|$|E
5|$|The prison {{reformer}} John Howard travelled {{around the}} country in the 1770s inspecting jails, and presented his research in The State of the Prisons in England and Wales (1777).

The Duke of Portland had a one-room cellar in Chesterfield that housed four prisoners, with no straw or heat, which had not been cleaned for months. Lord Arundel owned <b>a</b> <b>jail</b> in Penzance, where Howard found a debtor in a room 11ftx11ft and 6ft high, with a small window. The door of the room had not been opened for four weeks.|$|E

5|$|A {{plea for}} a review by the Constitutional Tribunal was sought as a last-ditch attempt {{to stave off the}} {{execution}} of drug trafficker Shanmugam Murugesu. Shanmugam's lawyer contended that his client's right to equal protection under Article 12 of the Constitution had been infringed. Referring to cases of six recent offenders similarly convicted under the Misuse of Drugs Act, Shanmugam's lawyer drew {{attention to the fact that}} those offenders had imported more than 700grammes of cannabis, an offence which attracted the death penalty, but were eventually charged with possessing less than 500grammes of cannabis which resulted only in <b>a</b> <b>jail</b> sentence. In contrast, Shanmugam, who had imported 1,029.8grammes of cannabis, did not have the amount reduced and was sentenced to death. The plea was rejected by the President on 12 May 2005, one day before the execution date.|$|E

In June 1993, he avoided <b>a</b> <b>jail</b> sentence by being ordered to attend a rehabilitation clinic, but travelled to the South of France instead and was sentenced to 10 months in an open prison, where he was released after five. He was arrested again in September 1994 for possession.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, {{the city of}} Bellevue began {{studying}} a possible civic center with a new city hall, courthouses, <b>a</b> <b>jail,</b> a museum and a basketball arena for the Seattle SuperSonics. The civic center plan was scaled back to a single convention center in downtown Bellevue, Meydenbauer Center, and a new downtown library, both of which opened in 1993; the plan for a city hall was seen as controversial and unnecessary at the time. In 1990, the city hall area was proposed {{as the site of}} a county jail and courthouse to serve the Eastside. The proposed site, located north of city hall, was seen as undesirable because of its existing wetlands and was rejected in favor of a site near Overlake Hospital Medical Center.|$|E
