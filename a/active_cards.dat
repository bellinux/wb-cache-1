The cards are from that year named either NSB-kort for cards produced by NSB or Ruter Reisekortet (Ruter travel card) for cards produced by Ruter.|$|E

40|$|Utilizing {{automatically}} {{collected data}} sources, this research strengthens {{the understanding of}} changes in user travel behavior caused {{by the introduction of}} the extended East London Line (ELL) into London's public transportation network. A recently developed method for inferring all Oyster users' origins and destinations on the public transportation system, and linking trip segments into full journeys, enables analysts to study the influence of a major capital investment on the larger public transportation network in great detail over a span of time and geography not available with traditional survey methods. Expanding an Oyster-based origin-destination matrix to represent all users provides estimates of overall ridership and passengers' travel patterns. Careful analysis of the usage of the rail line and other public transportation services in its vicinity provides a new method to infer the passenger demand generated by the new service. Through the creation of a large user panel (made up of over 54, 000 Oyster users with <b>active</b> <b>cards</b> in April 2010 and who travelled on the ELL in October 2011), this thesis studies changes in journey frequency, travel time, journey distance, public transportation mode share, and access distance by comparing journeys made before and after the introduction of the extended ELL. by Kevin J.

40|$|Dicer {{plays an}} {{essential}} role in the RNA-interference (RNAi) pathway. The structure of Dicer is highly conserved across eukaryotic organisms. While the significance of Dicer in regulation of antiviral RNAi in lower eukaryotes and genesis of microRNAs in mammals have been established, it remains largely unclear whether Dicer could also be involved in other innate antiviral pathways, particularly in the nucleus. In this study, we explored the link between nuclear Dicer and transcription initiation of interferon (IFN) regulatory factors in cells infected with nuclear-replicating influenza A virus. Infection of RNA viruses is initially recognized by host pattern recognition receptors (PRRS) which induce antiviral responses, such as production of type I IFN. Many RNA viruses have evolved with antagonistic mechanisms to counteract host antiviral response {{and it is difficult to}} study some host antiviral functions using wild type viruses. We examined the role of Dicer under infection by using various RNA viruses defective in antagonizing IFN-β production. Our data showed that the depletion of Dicer has no effect on IRF 3 activation but down regulates IFN-β production. Furthermore, over-expression of the constitutively <b>active</b> <b>CARDs</b> from RIG-I in Dicer knockdown cells failed to activate the IFN-b promoter. Using an influenza A virus infection model, we demonstrated that Dicer exerts anti-viral function through modulation of host IFN expressions in the nucleus. It appears that only nuclear-replicating influenza virus, but not the cytoplsmic-replicating Sendai virus, can promote translocation of Dicer to the nucleus. Taken together, our findings suggested that Dicer could induce host antiviral response independent of RIG-I and microRNA pathways. Molecular details for this mechanism will be discussed...|$|E
