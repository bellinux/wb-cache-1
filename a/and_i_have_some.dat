6000|$|... "You couldn't do better, my dear," [...] said Mr. Bennett, approvingly. [...] "And now run away. Mr. Peters <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> {{business}} to discuss." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't doubt it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> {{reason for}} trusting you. I think you're {{a good friend}} of Dick's and Andrew's; and their friends are mine." ...|$|E
60|$|Before {{she could}} speak, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> already {{recognized}} the suspicious-looking personage whom Mr. Engelman <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> time since encountered on the door-step. I inquired {{what the man}} had said when he heard that the lodgings were to let.|$|R
60|$|Monday, Dec. 31.—Mr. G. did {{not appear}} at table to-day, {{suffering}} from a surfeit of wild strawberries the day before. But he dined in his dressing gown, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> chat {{with him in his}} room after lunch.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{your father}} <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> excuse, {{because we were}} out late last night; {{you ought to have}} been up full three hours ago, and to have been all ready, with your lessons learned. Now, what do you suppose you shall do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To a dot!" [...] {{declared}} Patsy. [...] "So come to dinner, for it's {{ready and}} waiting, and the Major <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> wonderful fairy tales to tell you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think not," [...] said Thirlwell. [...] "Very sorry, of course, but there's {{only a week}} of my holiday left <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> {{business}} in South Ontario. Then I must {{go back to the}} bush." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Gentlemen," [...] he said, [...] "I {{have ordered}} {{coffee in the}} smoking-room. The head-waiter has told me of some {{wonderful}} brandy, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> cigars which I am anxious for you to try. Will you come this way?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hum! I've {{shot and}} hunted every beast, <b>I</b> think, shootable <b>and</b> huntable, from a humming-bird to an elephant; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> splendid fishing in Canada; but, after all, {{give me a}} Whitbury trout, on a single-handed Chevalier. We'll at them to-morrow, Mr. Armsworth." ...|$|R
5000|$|.....I guess I've {{been lucky}} {{that most of}} the time I've been in the same {{direction}} as the director. I try to work with directors whose work <b>I</b> like <b>and</b> find interesting. When I was younger, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to find work where <b>I</b> could, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> not great experiences with directors." ...|$|R
50|$|I {{tried to}} write from more of a {{personal}} perspective. I was homeless for a while, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> drinking issues, so I put my personal experiences in there. I also tried {{to put in a}} positive tone so people who are listening can understand and maybe the songs can help them out.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's well," [...] {{returned}} the Captain, with satisfaction. [...] "I had hopes of that young feller {{from the night}} you mention. Now, mother, I'm off. Gillie <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> business to transact up the water. Very particular business--eh, lad?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I'm an American citizen,' said Waterall, 'and I {{happen to}} have some idea of a citizen's duties. What is more, I'm a {{newspaper}} man, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> idea of my duty to my paper. Call me what you like, you won't alter that.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why not? It {{could not}} deepen the feud between our Houses, which already has no bottom, {{and if he}} refused, we would take one, for the captain is my friend. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> little store set by; {{it came to me}} from my mother." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You know why," [...] he said. [...] "I {{have had}} no one to think of but you, for the last four years. Your letters were the great pleasures of my life. <b>I</b> thought over <b>and</b> over again of those last words of yours, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> hope that, when I came back, I might say to you: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One quite {{forgot all}} about time. I was {{relieved}} at 4 A.M., and on looking at my watch found <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been up there nearly twelve hours, <b>and</b> then discovered <b>I</b> was rather hungry. The skipper <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> cheese <b>and</b> biscuits, ham sandwiches, and water on the bridge, <b>and</b> then <b>I</b> went down <b>and</b> brewed some cocoa and ship's biscuit." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Louis," [...] Mr. Bundercombe protested, [...] "I guess I didn't come round here {{to listen}} to lies. You <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> little {{dealings}} together <b>and</b> <b>I</b> feel I've the right to insist on the truth. Now, then, don't give us any more trouble--there's a good fellow! If you'd rather talk to me alone invite me into the office or behind that desk." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{has been}} thought," [...] {{answered}} Ravenswood, [...] "a fatal spot to my family; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> reason to term it so, {{for it was}} here I first saw Miss Ashton; and it is here I must take my leave of her for ever." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, well, {{you ought}} to have got over that by this time," [...] the captain interrupted. [...] "What can I do for you, Mr. Crawshay? I have been yarning with the purser a little longer than usual, this morning, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> rounds to do." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Wimbush nodded. [...] "Certainly," [...] he said. [...] "And I {{hope you}} will not find it uninteresting," [...] he added modestly. [...] "Our muniment room is {{particularly}} rich in ancient records, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> genuinely new light to throw on {{the introduction of the}} three-pronged fork." ...|$|E
5000|$|Stryder began a {{partnership}} with English record producer and songwriter Fraser T Smith. According to Smith {{in an interview with}} HitQuarters, [...] "Kwasi had no shortage of beats and cool sounding production, but I think he wanted to try and break through into the mainstream, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> experience crossing underground over into mainstream having worked with artists like Craig David." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then, I think, I'll {{endeavour}} {{to find my}} way alone,' said Tom, 'for I fear {{she would}} not be very glad to see me. That unfortunate occurrence, in relation to which you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> amicable words together, in private, is not likely to have impressed her with any friendly feeling towards me. Though it really was not my fault.' ...|$|R
3000|$|Since I came to Australia, I {{always felt}} that I am a bit lower grade, my {{self-esteem}} was damaged because I was told that I couldn’t speak English like the local people <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> ‘accent’. If <b>I</b> can’t speak English like Australians, I’d be behind them. So, I expect that the program correct our English and help us improve it (Tomoko) [...]...|$|R
6000|$|Evelyn laughed. [...] "But {{one need}} not go too far?" [...] She paused and gave her mother a steady look. [...] "Langrigg is a fine old house, I don't suppose Jim is ruined, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> money. Then you have taught me to expect that I may get some more." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you have}} an hour to spare," [...] Duncombe said, [...] "it {{would give me a}} great deal of {{pleasure}} if you and your daughter would walk down and have a look over my place. Part of the hall is Elizabethan, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> relics which might interest Miss Fielding." ...|$|E
6000|$|Charles in the meantime, {{still more}} {{surprised}} at what he beheld, called out on his part--"What! Doctor Rochecliffe become literally one of the church militant, and tilting with my friend cavalier Wildrake? May I use the freedom {{to ask him to}} withdraw, as Colonel Everard <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> private business to settle?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Micklethwayte; yes, {{we lived}} there, {{and got on}} very well. We <b>had</b> boarders, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> dear little pupils; but last year Mark Egremont--you {{remember}} dear little Mark--was in the neighbourhood, and hearing my name, he told his uncle, who had been seeking us ever since. And he came, Mr. Egremont, and took us home, and oh, the family have been so kind!' ...|$|R
60|$|We sat late at table, {{and after}} the other guests <b>had</b> retired, Bennoch <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> very {{friendly}} talk, and he proposed that on my wife's return we should take up our residence in his house at Blackheath, while Mrs. Bennoch and himself were absent for two months {{on a trip to}} Germany. If his wife and mine ratify the idea, we will do so.|$|R
60|$|It {{was not a}} large place, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> {{difficulty}} in turning about in it without knocking down the dishes that it contained. But at last I felt that I was in a good position, and then after making me promise not to tell who had let me in if I was discovered, Phil Jones {{closed the door and}} left me to myself.|$|R
6000|$|... "This foreman <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> great set-to's. He's {{a regular}} old-line party-member. Too dogmatic. Expects to reform {{everything}} from deforestration to nosebleed by saying phrases like 'surplus value.' Like reading the prayer-book. But same time, he's a Plato J. Aristotle compared {{with people like}} Ezry Stowbody or Professor Mott or Julius Flickerbaugh." ...|$|E
6000|$|Eustacia {{looked for}} a moment what she felt, and she murmured, lifting her deep dark eyes anxiously to his, [...] "I wish I knew what to do. I don't want to be uncivil to him; but I don't wish to see him again; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> few little things to return to him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed, I {{have nothing}} more to tell. Once or twice {{it seemed to me}} that he was on the point of telling me something. He spoke one evening of the {{importance}} of the secret, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> recollection that he said that no doubt foreign spies would pay a great deal to have it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{not proud}} of my skill," [...] he answered, [...] "but I did try at Homburg once. There {{was nothing else to}} do, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> idea of buying a small car for touring in the Black Forest. If you doubt my words, you can ask any of the servants. They saw me bring the car up the avenue later in the morning." ...|$|R
