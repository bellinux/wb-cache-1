40|$|Silk {{is one of}} the {{promising}} natural fibres and has a long established history in textile production throughout the centuries. Silk is produced by cultured silk worms, spiders, scorpions, mites and flies. It is extracellular proteinaceous fibres which consist of highly crystalline and insoluble proteins, the fibroins glued with sericin and an amourphous protein. On the other hand, understanding and controlling the degradation of protein materials are important for determining quality and the value of <b>appearance</b> <b>retention</b> in textiles. Hence, for silk textiles, <b>appearance</b> <b>retention</b> is critical value for the quality. And this {{is one of the}} key properties directly related to the degree and nature of protein degradation. It is therefore necessary to understand the silk composition and damage to obtain good conservation treatments and long-term preservation especially for the historical silk fabrics. In this study, silk fibre and its properties are briefly introduced along with images on their fibre damages. Additionally, proteomics method which helps to understand the degradation at the molecular level in textiles is introduced. Finally, proteomic evaluation of silk is summarized according to the researchers carried out in the literature. ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceAn intact tidal {{freshwater}} marsh system (3477 m 2) was labelled {{by adding}} 15 N-ammonium as a tracer to the flood water inundating the ecosystem. The <b>appearance</b> and <b>retention</b> of 15 N-label in different marsh components (leaves, roots, sediment, leaf litter and invertebrate fauna) was followed over 15 days. This {{allowed us to}} elucidate the direct assimilation and dependence on creek-water nitrogen on a relatively short term and provided an unbiased assessment of {{the relative importance of}} the various compartments within the ecosystem. Two separate experiments were conducted, one in spring/early summer (May 2002) when plants were young and building up biomass; the other in late summer (September 2003) when macrophytes were in a flowering or early senescent state. Nitrogen assimilation rate (per hour inundated) was > 3 times faster in May compared to September. On both occasions, however, the results clearly revealed that the less conspicuous compartments such as leaf litter and ruderal vegetations are more important in nitrogen uptake and retention than the prominent reed (Phragmites australis) meadows. Moreover, short-term nitrogen retention in these nutrient rich marshes occurs mainly via microbial pathways associated with the litter and sediment. Rather than direct uptake by macrophytes, it is the large reactive surface area provided by the tidal freshwater marsh vegetation that is most crucial for nitrogen transformation, assimilation and short term retention in nutrient rich tidal freshwater marshes. Our results clearly revealed the dominant role of microbes in initial nitrogen retention in marsh ecosystems...|$|R

The results showed that the specimens washed in a HE washer had better fabric hand and smoothness. These results suggest that the HE washer was gentler to the washed clothes because it created less mechanical agitation during the wash process than the conventional washer. Although the agitation in the HE washer was less than that in the conventional washer, according to the current study, the washing action was sufficient to remove most stains, except white paint, after one laundering cycle. The effectiveness the HE washer in removing white paint was similar to that of the conventional washer.

The lymph nodes {{are one of the}} first places where metastases can be detected and are frequently examined for macroscopic metastases to help determine course of treatment for patients. However, {{little is known about the}} significance of microscopic metastases and disseminated individual cancer cells within the nodes. The goal of this work was to use MRI to monitor the development of primary tumors and lymphatic metastases in models of breast cancer. In this thesis, we examined the MRI appearance of lymph nodes in several different strains of immune compromised mice (nude, CB - 17 SCID, NOD/SCID IL 2 Rnull) and compared the appearance to immune competent C 57 /Bl 6 strain. We found that immune deficiencies influenced the MRI appearance of nodes and that the nude strain had highly variable lymph node appearance and volume. We also compared orthotopic transplantation models of breast cancer that used both the nude and CB- 17 SCID strains using MRI. We found that MRI was most reliable for detecting metastases in the lymph nodes of SCID mice and that the variability of the appearance of nodes in nude mice can lead to their misclassification. We then used the SCID orthotopic breast cancer model to monitor the <b>appearance</b> and <b>retention</b> of iron oxide nanoparticle labeled cancer cells in both the primary tumor and lymph nodes. We found that iron-labeled cells are still detected within the primary tumor after 28 days post-implantation and that these labeled cells almost exclusively migrated to the lymph nodes. The development of improved methods for monitoring the development of the primary tumor and metastases and the roles that different cells populations have in these processes will allow for more accurate knowledge of how cancer cell heterogeneity impacts disease progression. These tools will allow for more effective monitoring of the treatment effect of new drugs on primary tumors and metastatic dissemination...|$|R

We therefore assessed effects of delayed necropsy, prolonged storage (3 and 6 months), and of two commonly utilized sterilization approaches: irradiation or final rinse with peracetic acid, on architecture and extracellular matrix (ECM) protein characteristics of de-cellularized mouse lungs. These different approaches resulted in significant differences in both histologic <b>appearance</b> and in <b>retention</b> of ECM and intracellular proteins as assessed by immunohistochemistry and mass spectrometry.

AATCC Test Method 130 - 2010 : Soil Release: Oily Stain Release Method {{was used as}} a guideline to conduct the test for stain removal. Six types of stains (i.e., vegetable oil, mustard, spaghetti sauce, lipstick, nail polish, and white paint) were used to represent the common stains found in home laundering. The staining procedure for vegetable oil, mustard, and spaghetti sauce followed AATCC Test Method 130 - 2010. For lipstick, nail polish, and white paint, to increase the consistency of the stains on the specimens, a stained specimen was established as a standard for each type of stain, and one person was responsible for staining one type of stain for all test specimens based on the standard. As in the study by Schlag and Ordonez (2010), the Gray Scale for Color Change was used to evaluate the color change after washing from the color of the stained, unwashed standard specimen. On this scale, “ 5 ” indicates no color change (i.e., the stain has not been removed at all) and “ 1 ” indicates a severe color change (i.e., the stain has been completely removed).|$|E
40|$|Currently, carpet {{companies}} {{assess the}} quality of their products based on their <b>appearance</b> <b>retention</b> capabilities. For this, carpet samples with different degrees of wear after a traffic exposure simulation process are rated with wear labels by human experts. Experts compare changes in appearance in the worn samples to samples with original appearance. This process is subjective and humans can make mistakes up to 10 % in rating. In search of an objective assessment, research using texture analysis has been conducted to automate the process. Particularly, Local Binary Pattern (LBP) technique combined with a Symmetric adaptation of the Kullback-Leibler divergence (SKL) are successful for extracting texture features related to the wear labels either from intensity and range images. We present in this paper a novel extension of the LBP techniques that improves the representation of the distinct wear labels. The technique consists in detecting those patters that monotonically change with the wear labels while grouping the others.

The results showed that the specimens washed in the HE washer had better fabric hand and were smoother (fewer wrinkles) than those washed in the conventional washer. Conventional and HE washers performed similarly in color change, dimensional change, and skewness change. In regard to dryer, all results except those for stain removal showed no significant differences between the specimens dried in the conventional dryer and those dried in the HE dryer. In stain removal, when a softener was not used, the conventional dryer removed more stains from the specimens than the HE dryer. However, when a softener was used, the stains on the specimens dried in the conventional dryer were more difficult to remove than those on the specimens dried in the HE dryer.|$|E

A qualitative difference in binding of ICG to the serum proteins was noted between both groups of H and F.

40|$|The main aim of {{this project}} was to quantitatively characterise the {{developed}} surface topography of finishes on stainless steel sheet using three-dimensional surface analysis techniques. At present surface topography is measured using (mainly) stylus profilometry and analysed with 2 D parameters, such as Ra, Rq and Rz. These 2 D measurements are not only unreliable {{due to a lack}} of standardised measurement methodology, but are also difficult to relate directly to the actual shape of the topography in 3 dimensions. They bear little direct relation to the functional properties of the surface of stainless steel, making them less useful than their 3 D counterparts. Initially it is crucial to ensure that the surface topography data collected is correct, accurate and relevant, by defining a measurement strategy. Models of the surface topography are developed encompassing the usual features of the topography and variations in the topography caused by production or 'defects'. The functional features are discussed and predicted relevant parameters are presented. The protocol covers the selection of the correct measuring instrument based on the surface model and the size of the relevant functional features so that the desired lateral and vertical resolution and range is achievable. Measurement data is then analysed using Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs) to separate the different frequencies within the spatial frequencies detected on the surface. The frequency of the important features shows up dominantly on a Power Spectral Density (PSD) plot and this is used to find the correct sampling interval to accurately reconstruct the 3 D surface data. The correct instrument for further measurements is then selected using a Steadman diagram. Operational details of the measuring instruments available for this project are given and variables for these instruments are discussed. Finally, measurement method recommendations are made for each of the four finishes modelled. Based on this surface characterisation an attempt is made to identify the 3 D parameters that give a quantitative description of common stainless steel sheet finishes with respect to some aspects of their production and functional performance. An investigation of the differences in manufacturing processes, gauge and grade of material is presented, providing an insight into the effect on topography of such divergences. The standardised 3 D parameter set is examined to determine its sensitivity to common variations in the topography of the 2 B finish and therefore their potential relevance. A new data separation technique of the material probability curve for use on the 3 D datasets establishes a cut-off (transition point) between the two main functionally relevant features of the 2 B surface (plateaus and valleys) by finding the intersection of the asymptotes of a fitted conic section, giving a non subjective methodology to establish the section height. The standardised 3 D parameters are then used on the separated data, with the aim of being more functionally relevant to the main surface studied. Functional tests to rate capability of these parameters in the areas of optical <b>appearance,</b> lubricant <b>retention</b> and corrosion are carried out and the appropriate topography parameters are related to their performance.

40|$|Certain {{aspects of}} the {{formation}} of non-infectious hemagglutinins (NIHA) in the chick embryo infected with influenza virus have been analyzed. It was shown by the use of combined in ovo-deembryonation technics that little or no NIHA is released following infection with small doses of standard virus during the most active and constant growth periods of the virus extending to about the 36 th hour of incubation {{in spite of the fact}} that multiple infection of cells must have taken place in the latter half of that period. A slight decrease in the ID 50 /HA ratios of the yields obtained after the 36 th hour, coinciding with the falling off of virus production and release may possibly be explained in terms of inactivation of completed virus or leakage of as yet incompleted virus from damaged cells. Exposure of the entodermal cells of the allantois of eggs deembryonated shortiy after injection of saturation or near saturation inocula of standard seed to large quantities of infectious virus added to the media at various times after infection and not extending over more than 2 hours resulted in a decrease of the ID 50 /HA ratios of the progenies only during the first 2 or possibly 4 hours after the primary inoculation. Later addition did not influence the yields. As discussed, such sudden and heavy exposures of cells are not expected to occur during the infectious process induced by small inocula of standard seed. The possible role of destruction of cell receptors in NIHA production has been analyzed in several ways. The addition of receptor-destroying enzyme (RDE) to the media of deembryonated eggs after near saturation inocula of standard seeds, if anything, increased the ID 50 /HA ratios of the progenies, and that only when added during the first few hours following infection, presumably by reducing the changes for high multiplicity of infection of cells. In contrast, ultraviolet-inactivated virus, which retains its enzymatic activity, lowered, if anything, the ID 50 /HA ratios of the progenies, when present in the media of deembryonated eggs from the 2 nd to 4 th or possibly 6 th hour after infection. Excessive amounts of irradiated virus may still cause some degree of interference under these conditions. Later addition of irradiated viruses were without effect with respect to NIHA production or interference. In attempts to alter the cell receptors prior to infection by potassium periodate (KIO 4), it was noted that the addition of glycerol led to the <b>appearance</b> and partial <b>retention</b> for at least 24 hours of substances in the allantoic fluids which were capable of inactivating considerable proportions of standard virus. These data indicate that destruction of external cell receptors plays little if any role in NIHA production. The implications of these findings are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Uniforms can be {{regarded}} as a group emblem, a certificate of legitimacy, and a suppressor of individuality. Uniforms therefore can reveal the status of the wearer, enhance the identity of the employees and facilitate group cohesion. Nowadays, many large international organisations, such as airlines, have developed corporate clothing (or uniforms) to enhance their corporate image. In Hong Kong, the image of taxi services is relatively poor. This may be affected by their poor services provided, their appearance and/or the way they wear. Recently, most of the taxi drivers wear T-shirt, vest, shorts or jeans and some are relatively “scruffy”. In respect to the poor image of Hong Kong taxi drivers, this project therefore initiated the development of uniform for taxi drivers with the aim at giving them a new identity and improving their social status. In this study, the nature of work, working condition, the perception of taxi passengers and drivers towards the images of Hong Kong taxi drivers and wearing uniforms were investigated. Anticipated with the current development of Hong Kong’s tourism, it is generally perceived that not only encouraging a positive and competence image of Hong Kong taxi services, uniforms may also enhance the self-esteem, confidence and working morale of taxi drivers. In this study, four commercial fabrics were selected and fabrics were evaluated in terms of comfortability, durability and <b>appearance</b> <b>retention</b> since they are all regarded as very important parameter for the development of uniforms for taxi drivers.

The focus of the laboratory program was to investigate the influence of confinement on the water retention properties, the development of swelling pressure during a decrease in suction and the effect of external pressure and swelling pressure on suction. The majority of the test types involved a stepwise increase in relative humidity under free swelling and under constant volume conditions with measurement of swelling pressure. In addition, tests with constant water content and externally applied pressure were performed. In those tests relative humidity was measured. The measurement of relative humidity through narrow channels was investigated and the influence of testing technique was investigated with regard to gradients in temperature and air pressure over the equipment. The results show that swelling pressure develops during water uptake from water in vapour phase when samples are tested under constant volume conditions. The results also show that if a pressure is applied to a sample with a constant water content the result will be an increase in the measured relative humidity and vice versa. Retention curves for absorption and desorption were determined under free swelling conditions at different relative humidity. The <b>appearance</b> of the <b>retention</b> curves was dependent on the initial water content. The results of the laboratory tests were used to find a relation between water content, void ratio, swelling pressure and suction. In the analysis of the test results the interpretation was made under the assumption that equilibrium had been reached. The measured axial swelling pressure that developed during water uptake under constant volume condition was normalised to a pressure corresponding to swelling pressure at saturation to be independent of void ratio. A relation between the normalised swelling pressure and the degree of saturation is suggested. A second relation based on a thermodynamic relationship for saturated conditions was compared to the laboratory results. In the second relation the swelling pressure is related to the actual relative humidity in the clay and the relative humidity according to the retention curve for the current water content. The correspondence between the second relation and the measured test results was found to be good. The analyses are mainly based on results from the tests conducted with an increasing degree of saturation under constant void ratio. Based on the mentioned relations a model is proposed which can be used e. g. to evaluate field measurements and model the late stage of the wetting process...|$|R
