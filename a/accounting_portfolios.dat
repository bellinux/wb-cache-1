40|$|The {{usefulness}} of stress tests as risk management tool crucially {{depends on the}} choice of stress scenarios: if the scenario is too implausible, the stress test results will be ignored by management.

In contrast to previous findings that the portfolio share of net foreign assets to total assets is constant in a country, both our theoretical and empirical results support a highly persistent process or a unit-root process, with some countries displaying a trend. Finally, we reestablish the composition effect as the quantitatively dominant driving force of current account dynamics in the past data.

We do so {{in the context of a}} two-country macro-finance model of Pavlova and Rigobon (2008 a) that allows exploration of the interconnections between equilibrium portfolios and external accounts' dynamics. We calibrate the model and find that it generates several testable implications, some of which have already been validated empirically. First, we establish dynamic properties of the capital-gains adjusted current account and show that they are fundamentally different from those of the conventional current account. Second, we find that capital gains have a stabilizing effect on the trade balance and the current account. Finally, we demonstrate that in response to a shock, the conventional and the capital-gains adjusted current accounts may move in opposite directions.

40|$|There {{are three}} crucial {{mathematical}} system concepts in Finance, which are either being confused or misapplied - uncertainty, complexity and rank. First, {{the concept of}} epistemic uncertainty is sufficient for modeling {{and the concept of}} probability is unnecessary. This is illustrated by 'Galton's Error,' and the under-repesentation of systematic risk by American mutual funds. These funds use simple unidirectional projection ('regression') to compute Sharpe's beta for fund selection. There are at least five equivalent ways of representing the measured model uncertainty and a new and an improved risk categorization for mutual funds is presented. Second, the concept of (linear) system complexity is usually dealt with by presuming a model rank, as the Cowles Foundation erroneously prescribed in the early 1950 s, and superimposing that model rank on the data, when a model is estimated. But the model rank {{does not have to be}} presumed: it can be identified from the data and all corresponding (Grassmanian) coefficients can be computed by CLS Projections. This is illustrated by the identification of the model rank of simple financial risk systems in six Asian countries, in particular in Taiwan. Third, often it is thought that Markowitz' portfolio optimization and exact and complete cash flow accounting are incompatible because of the non-existence, or empirical instability, of the information matrix. The problem is caused by the rank constraints imposed by the <b>portfolio</b> <b>accounting</b> identities. But these rank constraints also provide the solution, since they form exact selectors of the portfolio allocations, which are found by simple tensor algebra. This will be illustrated by the optimization of an Asian multi- currency stock investment portfolio. financial modeling, cash <b>accounting,</b> <b>portfolio</b> optimization, uncertainty, complexity, rank...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} asset {{allocation}} decisions of life insurance companies in emerging markets. Mature market insurers allocate {{only a small}} fraction of their assets to emerging markets because of regulatory constraints, rating pressures, and currency risk. However, global insurers invest directly in emerging markets by setting up subsidiaries rather than through portfolio investment, and this trend is increasing. Local insurers largely remain captive investors of local instruments and provide stability to the domestic securities market. The regulatory regime and the liquidity and depth of local markets play an important role in asset allocation decisions of insurers. Insurance companies are increasingly adopting asset liability management and risk control measures. However, insufficiently developed local markets and regulatory interventions on the liabilities side often limit optimal asset allocation.

Finally, conditions are derived under which it may be still reasonable, from a practical viewpoint, to implement Black-Scholes strategies. ...|$|R

5000|$|Net {{asset value}} and other {{accounting}} and recordkeeping activities {{are the result}} of the process of fund accounting (also known as securities accounting, investment <b>accounting,</b> and <b>portfolio</b> <b>accounting).</b> Fund accounting systems are sophisticated computerized systems used to account for investor capital flows {{in and out of a}} fund, purchases and sales of investments and related investment income, gains, losses and operating expenses of the fund. The fund's investments and other assets are valued regularly; daily, weekly, or monthly, depending on the fund and associated regulatory or sponsor requirements. There is no universal method or basis of valuing assets and liabilities for the purposes of calculating the net asset value used throughout the world, and the criteria used for the valuation will depend upon the circumstances, the purposes of the valuation and any regulatory and/or accounting principles that may apply. For example, for U.S.-registered open-ended funds, investments are commonly valued each day the New York Stock Exchange is open, using closing prices (meant to represent fair value), typically 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time. For U.S.-registered money market funds, investments are often carried or valued at [...] "amortized cost" [...] as opposed to market value for expedience and other purposes, provided various requirements are continually met.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{investigate}} the entry of renewable energy technologies into Pacific Islands' electricity markets, with particular focus on a new technology: the Pelamis, a wave energy converter. Pacific Islands are endowed with various types of renewable energy resources, yet they remain highly dependent on expensive fuel imports for their energy requirements, using little renewable energy. This paradox is investigated by studying the characteristics of Pacific Islands' electricity markets, including a case study on the entry of a new renewable energy technology, the Pelamis, into the electricity market of Hawaii. The integration of renewable energy technologies into Pacific Islands' electricity systems is then analysed {{from the point of}} view of an energy planner. The recent application of portfolio analysis to energy planning has provided a new framework to evaluate the different electricity generating options available to energy planners. Taking both the generating cost and financial risk of each technology into <b>account,</b> <b>portfolio</b> theory has been applied to various European countries, by comparing actual generation portfolios to an efficient frontier showing the trade-off between energy security and the cost of electricity generation. This framework has clear relevance to Pacific Island Countries. However, the characteristics inherent to Pacific Island Countries have important implications on the operation of their electricity systems, which are not necessarily taken into <b>account</b> in <b>portfolio</b> analysis. In particular, geographical isolation inhibits these countries from connecting to larger intercontinental grids, which emphasizes the importance of reliability of supply. This thesis presents a mathematical model which establishes a method for computing an optimal intertemporal path for introducing renewable energy into a pre-existing electricity system. The model explicitly allows for the cost of maintaining reliability of supply as intermittent generators are integrated. The framework also incorporates concepts from Integrated Resource Planning and portfolio analysis. Finally, policies for accelerating renewable energy development are reviewed, and a discussion is provided on the policies which are likely to be most suitable to Pacific Islands. One of the main conclusions of this thesis is that the amount of backup capacity for renewable energy can be optimally minimized by diversifying the mix of renewable energy resources in each island. In practice, this would require studying the complementarities and loading curves of the various renewable resources available, and comparing their total potential production, and the variability of this production, to electricity demand. This would allow energy planners to model the inclusion of a maximum amount of renewable energy using a minimum of backup capacity to maintain system reliability, potentially leading to a more efficient implementation and formulation of policies aimed at developing renewable energy generation in Pacific Islands...|$|R
