5|$|Some {{historian}}s opine that Hitler {{would have}} assumed Stefanie was of Jewish origin. American historian Graeme Donald believes Hitler would have inferred {{that she was}} Jewish, but saw no problems with this at the time. This view is supported by German historian Anton Joachimsthaler, who stated in a BBC interview that Hitler must have <b>assumed</b> <b>she</b> was Jewish because of her Jewish surname. British singer-songwriter, author, journalist and paranormal researcher Paul Roland wrote in his book Nazi Women that it didn't make the slightest difference to Hitler whether she was Jewish or not.|$|E
5|$|On 5 September, Emden {{entered the}} Bay of Bengal, {{achieving}} complete surprise, since the British <b>assumed</b> <b>she</b> was still with Spee's squadron. She operated on shipping routes there without success, until 10 September, {{when she moved}} to the Colombo–Calcutta route. There, she captured the Greek collier Pontoporros, which was carrying equipment for the British. Müller took the ship into his service and agreed to pay the crew. Emden captured five more ships; four were sunk, and the fifth, a steamer named Kabinga, was used to carry the crews from the other vessels. On 13 September, Müller released Kabinga and sank two more British prizes. Off the Ganges estuary, Emden caught a Norwegian merchantman; upon searching her, the Germans determined she was not carrying contraband and therefore released her. The Norwegians informed Müller that Entente warships were operating in the area, and so he decided to return to the eastern coast of India.|$|E
5|$|The {{first episode}} of Neighbours saw Daphne hired to strip at Des Clarke's (Paul Keane) bucks party. When {{the night was}} {{interrupted}} by a neighbour, Daphne left some belongings behind and returned the following morning to collect them. Des's fiancée <b>assumed</b> <b>she</b> had spent the night and called the wedding off. Realising that Des needed a lodger to help him pay the mortgage off, Daphne moved in. Des was instantly attracted to Daphne, but he tried to hide his feelings and became awkward around her. Josephine Monroe, author of Neighbours: The First 10 Years, wrote that the local men queued up to date Daphne, but it was Shane Ramsay (Peter O'Brien) who first caught her eye and they soon began a relationship.|$|E

25|$|On 18 November, Satish kidnapped six-year-old Somani {{when she}} was {{returning}} from her father's tea stall. Manjari supervised the search and the investigation, but could not make any headway. Satish raped Somani twice in his home; when she lost consciousness, he <b>assumed</b> <b>she</b> was dead and threw her into a field near his house.|$|E
25|$|It is {{believed}} that Mary, Queen of Scots – King George III's ancestor – also suffered from acute intermittent porphyria, although this is subject to much debate. It is <b>assumed</b> <b>she</b> inherited the disorder, if indeed she had it, from her father, James V of Scotland; both father and daughter endured well documented attacks that could fall within the constellation of symptoms of porphyria.|$|E
25|$|In 1953, Williams {{had been}} on {{maternity}} leave for three months while pregnant with daughter Susan, and <b>assumed</b> <b>she</b> would go straight {{to work on the}} film Athena when she returned. However, production started without her, and the studio cast Jane Powell in the lead role, rewriting much of the premise that Williams and writers Leo Pogostin and Chuck Walters had come up with. The studio moved her to Jupiter's Darling. Two more films were planned, Bermuda Encounter and Olympic Venus, about the first Olympic swimmers; however, these were never made.|$|E
50|$|Lord Denning MR {{held that}} Ms Cooke {{did not have}} to prove reliance, and would <b>assume</b> <b>she</b> had acted to her detriment. His {{decision}} went as follows.|$|R
5000|$|... "Robert Shaw plays {{a chauffeur}} who helps an upper-class woman (Sarah Miles) {{out of a}} mental depression, but mistakenly <b>assumes</b> <b>she</b> is {{interested}} in him. Rated three stars." ...|$|R

25|$|Throughout {{her adult}} life, except during World War II, Lawrence spent {{far more than}} she earned. Philip Astley had persuaded her to place £1,000 in a trust fund for her daughter, but aside from {{that she had no}} savings of her own. During her {{engagement}} to Bert Taylor he managed her finances and encouraged her to invest in the productions in which she starred, but although she earned a considerable amount of money from Private Lives, she still was deeply in debt, at one point owing fashion entrepreneur Hattie Carnegie more than $10,000. She opened accounts with dozens of shop owners but <b>assumed</b> <b>she</b> had unlimited credit and paid little attention to the invoices they sent.|$|E
25|$|Nationally, One Nation gained 8.99 {{percent of}} the Senate vote and 8.4% of the Representatives vote, but only one MP was elected – Len Harris as a Senator for Queensland. Heather Hill had been elected to this position, but the High Court of Australia ruled that, {{although}} she was an Australian citizen, she was ineligible for election to sit as a Senator because she had not renounced her British citizenship, which the Court <b>assumed</b> <b>she</b> possessed {{because she had been}} born in Britain. Hanson alleged in her 2007 autobiography Pauline Hanson: Untamed & Unashamed that a number of other politicians had dual citizenship yet this did not prevent them from holding positions in Parliament.|$|E
25|$|In {{search of}} an unusual gift for her father, Maggie chances to wander into Jarvis' shop, and he shows her the bowl he had set aside for Charlotte years ago. Maggie agrees to buy it and asks that it be {{delivered}} to her home. When Jarvis discovers the barely discernible crack Amerigo had noticed, he brings it to Maggie himself, reveals the defect, and offers it at half price. While waiting {{for her in the}} drawing room, he recognizes Amerigo and Charlotte in photographs on a table, and he innocently reveals they were the couple who originally considered purchasing the bowl, three days before the wedding. Maggie realizes that the two were not meeting for the first time, as she had always <b>assumed.</b> <b>She</b> confronts Amerigo, who confesses to his past with Charlotte and to their affair.|$|E

50|$|Some {{sources say}} it is Gwan's ghost who came to visit him, <b>assuming</b> <b>she</b> had died from the landslides. The fact that she touched his face lovingly could imply she has forgiven him.|$|R
25|$|Kurt-Caesar Hoffmann, {{captain of}} Scharnhorst, {{attempted}} {{to draw off}} the British battleship, so that Gneisenau could sink the merchant vessels. Lütjens, however, did not understand Hoffmann's intentions which the Scharnhorst captain {{was not able to}} communicate in detail in such short-order. A heated radio conversation followed in which Lütjens accused him of disobeying orders because he did not turn away immediately. The enemy ship did not leave the convoy and now Lütjens complained the British would be alerted to their position and as a consequence, successful attacks would now be more difficult to execute. In fact, Lütjens' fears were unfounded and luck was once again on his side. The British had sighted only one German ship. Since Hipper was known to be at sea, it was <b>assumed</b> <b>she</b> was the German vessel lurking around the convoy. Tovey's dismissal of the Naiad report masked the German ships' presence. Tovey still believed they were still in German ports. The disagreement did not adversely damage the two men's good relations.|$|E
500|$|June Bellamy, {{voiced by}} Tress MacNeille, is the actress who portrays both Itchy and Scratchy. Her only {{appearance}} was in [...] "The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show." [...] It is <b>assumed</b> <b>she</b> is {{a reference to}} veteran voice actress June Foray, {{based on the same}} first name. In the episode, Bellamy states that a woman voiced the characters, although Itchy and Scratchy are voiced by male actors.|$|E
500|$|In November 2014, Robinson was {{covering}} {{the count of}} the Rochester and Strood by-election. He was seen smiling whilst posing for a photograph with Jayda Fransen, candidate and deputy leader of Britain First, a far right-wing party. Robinson stated {{that he did not}} know who Fransen was, and <b>assumed</b> <b>she</b> was a staff member at the count seeking a [...] "selfie". [...] However, Fransen was wearing a prominent badge saying [...] "candidate" [...] at the time.|$|E
50|$|Following {{the major}} injury of Canada's {{starting}} goalkeeper, Erin McLeod, in March 2016, D'Angelo {{is expected to}} be on the roster for the 2016 Rio Olympics, <b>assuming</b> <b>she</b> makes a full recovery from her wrist injury.|$|R
50|$|Special Skill: Mandy {{can avoid}} spy traps, <b>assuming</b> <b>she</b> gets an exact roll. This skill {{can only be}} {{deactivated}} by the Hologram Projecting Mood Ring, but only on spy traps laid {{up to the point}} of that gadget's use.|$|R
60|$|Betty hurried over to Capt. Boggs' cabin, {{next the}} blockhouse, where Alfred lay, {{and with a}} palpitating heart and a {{trepidation}} wholly out of keeping with the brave front <b>she</b> managed to <b>assume,</b> <b>she</b> knocked gently on the door.|$|R
500|$|The casting process, which Kaufman {{described}} as [...] "arduous", began in New York City. He said teenagers {{from across the}} city wanted to audition. Academy Award-winning producer Scott Rudin was the film's casting director who found Erland van Lidth and Linda Manz. There was no character named Peewee in the novel. Rudin had organized an interview with Manz. Kaufman and Price were present; they all thought she had [...] "great character". Manz was so convincing that everyone <b>assumed</b> <b>she</b> was a real member of a street gang. Because of this, the character Peewee was specifically written for her.|$|E
500|$|In {{the second}} letter, {{addressed}} to Dr Carlyle, minister of Inveresk, Lady Grange writes bitterly {{of the roles}} of Lord Lovat and Roderick MacLeod in her capture and bemoans being described by Sir Alexander MacDonald as [...] "the cargo". Hope had known of Lady Grange's removal from Edinburgh but had <b>assumed</b> <b>she</b> would be well cared for. Appalled by her condition, he paid for a sloop with twenty armed men on board to go to St Kilda at his own expense. It had already set sail by 14 February 1741, but it arrived too late. Lady Grange {{had been removed from}} the island, probably in the summer of 1740.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} years of Dallas, Principal took certain {{measures}} in her personal life in order to add depth to her character. She initially was very distant from the cast and they <b>assumed</b> <b>she</b> didn't like them. Series producer Leonard Katzman confronted her about the issue and she said, [...] "I like everybody. It's just that I want to feel like an outsider, like Pam Barnes does, being married to a Ewing." [...] Principal also took to other ways of improving her character, such as taking voice lessons to perfect a Texas accent. Her relationship with Patrick Duffy's character, Bobby, was a central component to the show, and when Duffy returned to Dallas in 1986, after being killed off a year earlier, the entire previous year had been written off as Pam's dream.|$|E
5000|$|By {{this time}} Ben's {{marriage}} has fallen apart. After sleeping with Jess once more, Ben discovers she is bipolar; convinced {{she is the}} killer and wrongly <b>assuming</b> <b>she</b> has now kidnapped Abby, she counters that with a false accusation of rape.|$|R

5000|$|After getting married, <b>assuming,</b> <b>she</b> {{got married}} to Narungbam Sanathoi Angomcha, noting that Narungbam is her husband's surname, Sanathoi is her husband's name and Angom is her husband's Salai/Clan name. Then, her full name as per the Meitei custom {{will be changed}} as, ...|$|R
500|$|At {{the time}} of her birth, it was unknown if she was a male or female, as it was {{considered}} too dangerous to approach her and her parents. [...] Her handlers <b>assumed</b> <b>she</b> was a male and originally named her [...] "Sonny Jim". When it was established that Pattycake was a female, a contest was held by the New York Daily News to find her a name. [...] "Patty Cake", the winning entry, was submitted by New York fireman John O'Connor, who named the gorilla after his wife and a proposed daughter. [...] "It just so happens that we have three boys and I told my wife that if we ever have a girl, we should name her Patty, which happens to be her name. I thought we'd let the baby gorilla use the name in the meantime," [...] O'Connor told reporters.|$|E
500|$|Miss Rosa {{undertakes}} chemotherapy {{to treat}} her cancer which leaves her bald. Rosenblat did not shave her head for the role because she worried about other roles. She had to wear a silicone [...] "appliance" [...] {{on her head and}} neck. Each morning on set makeup artist Josh Turri made up the appliance onto her. The process would take approximately three hours and Turri added false beauty marks, eyebrows and small veins to complete Miss Rosa's look. Rosenblat described him as [...] "utterly brilliant and a perfectionist ... so you got this entirely organic sense that I was utterly bald and suffering [...] cancer." [...] While on set fellow actors and crew members incorrectly <b>assumed</b> <b>she</b> had shaved her head. The weather during filming also affected Miss Rosa's costumer. During warm weather crew shielded Rosenblat from the sun with umbrellas because the heat would cause the make up to crack. Other breaches were caused by perspiration and Turri would drain water from underneath the prosthetics prior to repairing it. At the end of each shoot it took Rosenblat 45 minutes to remove the appliance.|$|E
500|$|Inside Soap editor, Steven Murphy, {{said that}} the fact Pauline has been such an [...] "enduring staple" [...] will {{make it hard for}} fans to cope with her departure. [...] "It's huge in soap terms... She's a {{character}} people love to hate—you just <b>assumed</b> <b>she</b> would be there forever." [...] When addressing the repercussions that Pauline's exit would have on the soap, Murphy had this to say: [...] "characters like Pauline are like glue, because they're connected to so many other characters and they can help hold stories together. In terms of that [...] has very few of those now." [...] Jonathan Hughes, editor of All About Soap magazine, added [...] " [...] an absolute legend... You can't imagine the show without her... People will miss her because she's been such an important part of EastEnders for so many years." [...] However, not all viewers were sorry to hear of the character's retirement, with one commenting [...] "How can you have someone like Pauline Fowler on the television for 21 years? It's the best thing that's ever happened to television [...] Kill her off? I would have blown her up years ago".|$|E
5000|$|A chorus girl gets {{bad advice}} from her fellow chorines in {{handling}} a rich suitor who <b>assumes</b> <b>she</b> is a gold-digger. But <b>she</b> <b>assumes</b> he is after [...] "one thing" [...] and is {{holding out for}} marriage. After meeting his mother, she learn that her beau is engaged to a society girl. He loses his money and they drift apart. But after making a new fortune, {{he comes to the}} theater.|$|R
60|$|The {{straightforward}} course had, nevertheless, so much {{to recommend}} it, so well avoided the disadvantage of future revelation which a private repetition of the ceremony would entail, that <b>assuming</b> <b>she</b> could depend upon Swithin, as {{she knew she could}} do, good sense counselled its serious consideration.|$|R
50|$|After {{spending}} {{around two}} weeks in the field, the Kanitzs heard their names being called by one of the guards. When they walked to the gate, they saw that their neighbor, Mrs. Nagy, had asked a guard to release them. Kanitz <b>assumes</b> <b>she</b> said she needed them to use as labor.|$|R
