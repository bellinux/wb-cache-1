Researchers had one participant stand near a mockingbird nest and touch it, while others avoided the nest. Later, the mockingbirds recognized the intruder <b>and</b> <b>exhibited</b> defensive behavior, while ignoring the other individuals.|$|E

5|$|A modernist painter, Bellette was {{influential}} in mid-twentieth century Sydney art circles. She frequently painted scenes {{influenced by the}} Greek tragedies of Euripides and Sophocles and the epics of Homer. The only woman to have won the Sulman Prize more than once, Bellette claimed the accolade in 1942 with For Whom the Bell Tolls, and in 1944 with Iphigenia in Tauris. She helped found the Blake Prize for Religious Art, and was its inaugural judge. Bellette married artist and critic Paul Haefliger in 1935. The couple moved to Majorca in 1957; although she visited <b>and</b> <b>exhibited</b> in Australia thereafter, she did not return there to live, and became peripheral to the Australian art scene.|$|E
5|$|Candaules was {{completed}} <b>and</b> <b>exhibited</b> at the Royal Academy in 1830. Etty {{felt that the}} moral lesson of the story was that women were not male chattels, and that if men—even their husbands—violated a woman's rights she was within her rights to punish them. However, he made little effort to explain what was, at the time, an unusual view, instead allowing viewers to form their own judgement of the piece. Thus, unusually for a painting of the time, Candaules appears morally highly ambiguous, inviting the viewer to sympathise either with the sexually immoral Candaules, the murderous Nyssia or the voyeuristic Gyges.|$|E
5|$|Charles Redheffer and {{his machine}} became {{well known in}} Philadelphia in 1812. Redheffer claimed he had invented a {{perpetual}} motion machine <b>and</b> <b>exhibited</b> it in a house near the Schuylkill River in {{the outskirts of the}} city. He charged an admission fee of $5 (some sources claim $1) for men to view it; depending on the source, women were admitted free or at a charge of $1. The machine caused a sensation, and Redheffer lobbied for funds to build a larger version.|$|E

Commercial and subsistence fishers hunt fish in wild fisheries (see fishing) or farm them in ponds or in cages in the ocean (see aquaculture). They are also caught by recreational fishers, kept as pets, raised by fishkeepers, <b>and</b> <b>exhibited</b> in public aquaria.

5|$|Florence Nagle (26 October 1894– 30 October 1988) was {{a trainer}} and breeder of racehorses, a breeder of {{pedigree}} dogs, and an active feminist. Nagle purchased her first Irish Wolfhound in 1913, {{and went on}} to own or breed twenty-one United Kingdom Champions. Best in Show at Crufts in 1960 was awarded to Sulhamstead Merman, who was bred, owned <b>and</b> <b>exhibited</b> by Nagle. She also competed successfully in field trials with Irish Setters, from the 1920s until the mid-1960s resulting in eighteen Field Trial Champions. The male dog who was a linchpin in the 1970s revival of the Irish Red and White Setter breed was descended from one of Nagle's Irish Setters.|$|E

5|$|In 1821 the Royal Academy {{accepted}} <b>and</b> <b>exhibited</b> one of Etty's works, The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia (also {{known as}} The Triumph of Cleopatra), which depicted {{a large number}} of nude figures. Cleopatra was extremely well received, and many of Etty's fellow artists greatly admired him. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, ahead of John Constable. He became well respected for his ability to capture flesh tones accurately in painting, and for his fascination with contrasts in skin tones. Following the exhibition of Cleopatra, over the next decade Etty tried to replicate its success by painting nudes in biblical, literary and mythological settings. Between 1820 and 1829 Etty exhibited 15 paintings, of which 14 included nude figures.|$|E
