5|$|Australia {{opted to}} field an {{unchanged}} {{team for the}} Second Test at Lord's and elected to bat first after winning the toss. Johnson came in at 5/216 on the first afternoon <b>and</b> <b>struggled</b> <b>to</b> score, making only four of the 30 runs added during his stay at the crease before falling at 7/246, caught behind from the bowling of Bill Edrich. However, Australia's lower order wagged and they eventually took the score to 350 on the second morning.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, {{a sequel}} for the Nintendo 64, Mother 3 (EarthBound 64 in North America), was announced. It was slated for release on the 64DD, a disk drive {{expansion}} peripheral for the Nintendo 64. Itoi's expansive ideas during development led the development team {{to question whether}} fans would still consider the game part of the series. The game entered development hell <b>and</b> <b>struggled</b> <b>to</b> find a firm release date and in 2000, despite its level of completion, was later cancelled altogether with the commercial failure of the 64DD.|$|E
5|$|In Southeast Asia and Indonesia, male {{long hair}} was valued in until the seventeenth century, when the area adopted outside {{influences}} including Islam and Christianity. Invading cultures enforced shorter hairstyles on men {{as a sign}} of servitude, as well. They were also confused at the short hairstyles among women in certain areas, such as Thailand, <b>and</b> <b>struggled</b> <b>to</b> explain why women in the area had such short hair. They came up with several mythical stories, one of which involved a king who found a long hair in his rice and, in a rage, demanded that all women keep their hair short.|$|E

5|$|Manchester United, {{the holders}} of the FA Cup, began their defence of the trophy {{with a home}} tie against non-league Exeter City. United had made several first team changes <b>and</b> <b>struggled</b> <b>to</b> find a {{breakthrough}} in the tie. Even with the second half introductions of Paul Scholes and Cristiano Ronaldo, the visitors held on for a goalless draw. The match was replayed at Exeter's home ground, St James Park on 19 January 2005. Ronaldo scored the opening goal of the match in the ninth minute and Wayne Rooney added a second, three minutes from normal time.|$|E
5|$|This policy, {{known as}} malgachization, {{coincided with a}} severe {{economic}} downturn and a dramatic decline {{in the quality of}} education. Those schooled during this period generally failed to master the French language or many other subjects <b>and</b> <b>struggled</b> <b>to</b> find employment, forcing many to take low-paying jobs in the informal or black market that mired them in deepening poverty. Excepting the brief presidency of Albert Zafy, from 1992 to 1996, Ratsiraka remained in power from 1975 to 2001 and failed to achieve significant improvements in education throughout his tenure.|$|E
5|$|After leaving Neighbours, Dale {{found he}} had become typecast as Robinson in Australia <b>and</b> <b>struggled</b> <b>to</b> find work. His career was revitalised after he {{relocated}} to the United States in 2000. Since then, he has had roles in many American series including prominent parts in The O.C. (as Caleb Nichol) and Ugly Betty (as Bradford Meade), as well as recurring and guest roles in Lost, 24, NCIS, ER, The West Wing, The X-Files, Entourage and Once Upon a Time. Dale has also appeared in minor roles in films such as Star Trek Nemesis, Hollywood Homicide, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and , {{as well as the}} London West End production of Spamalot. Dale has been married to former Miss Australia Tracey Pearson since 1990 and has four children.|$|E

5|$|After the Treaties of Tilsit of July 1807 Metternich {{saw that}} Austria's {{position}} in Europe {{was much more}} vulnerable but believed the accord between Russia and France would not last. In the meantime he found the new French Foreign Minister, Jean-Baptiste Champagny unaccommodating <b>and</b> <b>struggled</b> <b>to</b> negotiate a satisfactory settlement {{over the future of}} several French forts on the River Inn. Over the following months the reach of Austrian policy, and Metternich's own reputation, increased. Metternich pushed for a Russo-Austrian alliance, though Tsar Alexander was too preoccupied with the three other wars he was engaged in to commit. Over time, Metternich came to see an eventual war with France as inevitable.|$|E
5|$|Edwin's {{defeat and}} death caused his kingdom to {{fragment}} into {{at least two}} parts. It also led to {{a sharp decline in}} Christianity in Northumbria when Edwin's immediate successors reverted to paganism. Although Paulinus' deacon, James, remained in the north <b>and</b> <b>struggled</b> <b>to</b> rebuild the Roman mission, Edwin's widow decided to return to Kent. Paulinus went with her, taking Edwin and Æthelburg's son and daughter, as well as one of Edwin's grandsons. The two boys went to the continent for safety, to the court of King Dagobert I. Æthelburg, Eanflæd, and Paulinus remained in Kent, where Paulinus was offered the see, or bishopric, of Rochester, which he held until his death. Because the pallium did not reach Paulinus until after he had left York, it was of no use to him.|$|E
5|$|The Transitional Federal Government, {{formed in}} 2004, was {{recognized}} as the central government of Somalia. Before December 2006, the TFG controlled only the town of Baidoa, the sixth largest city. The intervention of Ethiopian government forces following {{the rise of the}} Islamic Courts Union, culminating in the latter's defeat in the Battle of Baidoa, allowed the TFG to expand its control under the protection of Ethiopian troops. The TFG was at the time not able to effectively collect taxes, had no notable finances or real power base, <b>and</b> <b>struggled</b> <b>to</b> exert control over Mogadishu following an attempted move in late December 2006. However, the TFG later succeeded in capturing most of Somalia from insurgents, but struggled to cement its control and establish law and order.|$|E

5|$|Under the 2006 pyramid reorganisations, a third-place {{finish in}} the Wessex League {{was good enough for}} {{promotion}} back to the Southern League, along with local rivals Winchester City and Thatcham Town. In their first season back, they finished in ninth place, just five points from the divisional playoffs. They were unable to build on this <b>and</b> <b>struggled</b> <b>to</b> a nineteenth-place {{finish in the}} following season, ultimately finishing 29points above relegation after Slough Town were reprieved following Halifax Town's expulsion from the Football Conference. Andover's home match against Uxbridge, played towards the end of that season, was the club's thousandth game in the Southern League.|$|E
5|$|After the Olympics, Simpson trained {{throughout}} his winter break into 1957. In May, he rode {{in the national}} 25-mile championships; although he was the favourite, he lost to Sheil in the final. In a points race at an international event at Fallowfield a week later Simpson crashed badly, almost breaking his leg; he stopped working for a month <b>and</b> <b>struggled</b> <b>to</b> regain his form. At the national pursuit championships, he was beaten in the quarter-finals. After this defeat Simpson returned to road racing, winning the BLRC national hill climb championship in October before taking a short break from racing. In spring 1958 he traveled to Sofia with Sheil for two weeks' racing. On his return he won the national individual pursuit championship at Herne Hill Velodrome. In July, Simpson won a silver medal for England in the individual pursuit at the British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Cardiff, losing to Sheil by one-hundredth of a second in the final. A medical exam taken with the Royal Air Force (RAF) revealed Simpson to be colour blind.|$|E
5|$|Drogba {{suffered}} {{a string of}} injuries {{early on in the}} 2008–09 season <b>and</b> <b>struggled</b> <b>to</b> regain fitness, missing games from August to November due to knee problems. He scored his first goal of the season in mid-November but there was little reason to celebrate: he incurred disciplinary action and a three-match ban for throwing a coin back into the stands and Chelsea {{suffered a}} League Cup defeat against Burnley. Drogba scored his second goal of the season in a 2–1 victory against CFR Cluj in the UEFA Champions League, while his first Premier League goal of the season came in a 2–0 win against West Bromwich Albion in late December 2008. Having missed many games through injury and suspension, Drogba had lost his first team place and manager Scolari favoured playing Nicolas Anelka as a lone striker rather than pairing the two. However, he resolved to regain his position in the squad.|$|E

5|$|Giovinco {{missed out}} on Juventus's 2013 Supercoppa Italiana victory, and he {{initially}} went scoreless in the 2013–14 season until finally netting a notable goal in a 3–2 win over rivals Milan on the 6 October 2013. Giovinco fell out of form again <b>and</b> <b>struggled</b> <b>to</b> gain playing time, {{but he managed to}} break his goal drought on 14 April 2014, with a goal against Udinese, taking the ball past a defender and scoring with a left footed curling shot from outside the box. Overall, Giovinco managed 2 goals in 17 Serie A appearances that season, and one goal in the Coppa Italia, as Juventus won their third consecutive Serie A title. During the 2014–15 season under Massimiliano Allegri, Giovinco scored two goals in a 6–1 win over Hellas Verona in the Coppa Italia, on 15 January 2015, helping Juventus to the quarter-finals of the competition; both of his goals came in the first half, with the first coming from a free kick, and the second in injury time.|$|E
5|$|He {{made his}} debut on 24 September 1921 in a 1–0 victory over Chelsea and scored six goals {{in his first}} eleven appearances, {{including}} a brace against West Bromwich Albion on 6 May 1922, for the side as {{they went on to}} win the Football League First Division title with Beadles being praised for a bright future at the club. However, he was never a regular in the side, making just eighteen appearances in all competitions during his three years at the club, <b>and</b> <b>struggled</b> <b>to</b> displace the more established players, although, following being part of back-to-back league titles, Beadles, along with each member of the squad, was given a gold watch by the club. During his time at Anfield, he played in the 1922 FA Charity Shield defeat against Huddersfield Town, however he became frustrated with his lack of playing time and the club not allowing him to play for Wales in order to cover for players who were being called up by England.|$|E
5|$|R.C. Pro-Am II was {{developed}} by Rare and published by Tradewest. It was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in December1992. Nintendo Power praised the game's controls and upgrade options, which made the game strategic. The magazine criticized the difficulty as unfair, with aircraft hazards that gave players no reaction time in which to dodge attacks. Nintendo Magazine System praised the game overall and its multiplayer in particular, but felt that better games were available. In 1993, GamePro said that the game was better than its predecessor, but noted that the graphics and sound could have been better. Jeuxvideo.com appreciated how the sequel's cars had better traction, but thought the game was technically unrefined considering its few advances in four years' time. For example, they criticized Rare for recycling the original game's audio. In 1994, Game Players had high praise for the game's multiplayer, screeching sound effects, vehicle handling, and replay value. They criticized its lack of in-game music and current weapon indicators, <b>and</b> <b>struggled</b> <b>to</b> anticipate turns in the track in the game's angled perspective.|$|E

5|$|The King {{must have}} been {{impressed}} by Edington's performance, because in 1344 he made him treasurer of the realm, a position he held for the exceptionally long period of twelve years. This was a job fraught with problems, as the nation was in serious financial difficulties by the mid-1340s. The treasury was in great debt from the heavy demands of {{the early stages of}} the Hundred Years' War. By then reneging on his debts, the king had lost public confidence, <b>and</b> <b>struggled</b> <b>to</b> obtain new loans. Edington saw the need to bring all royal expenditure under the oversight of the exchequer. This did not entail controlling the King's use of his resources– a move Edward would have resented greatly– but simply attempting to budget all revenues and expenses. By the early 1360s this was largely achieved; a testimony to the capabilities and energy of Edington as an administrator. In 1356 he was named chancellor, a post he held until his retirement from the national scene in 1363, possibly for health reasons.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the Natives left Plymouth on 29 March (Eyton and Pie Wynyard followed a week later). They arrived in Melbourne in May, where the team played mostly Victorian Rules football, hoping {{to make more money}} that way. Although the side had employed Jack Lawlor to coach them in Victorian Rules during their tour of the British Isles, the heavy schedule and high injury count had left little time and energy for such training. As a result, the Victorian Rules matches were a failure; the players' unfamiliarity with the rules, combined with {{the fact that most of}} the Natives were rugby forwards (and therefore less suited to the more open Victorian Rules), ensured that they failed to perform well on the field <b>and</b> <b>struggled</b> <b>to</b> attract large crowds. The side played nine Victorian Rules matches in total, including one in New South Wales, but won only three of them, all against relatively weak opposition.|$|E
5|$|The {{most troubling}} aspect of colonizing the patroonships was enlisting the {{required}} number of colonists, {{so that the}} failure {{of many of the}} other proposed patroonships may in part be attributed to this fact. The patroons still dealt with the issues of a cautious people not caring to venture to an undeveloped world. As an owner of extensive lands in the sandy Gooi and of family estates in the not much more fruitful Veluwe, where several relatives were landowners <b>and</b> <b>struggled</b> <b>to</b> subsist on meager means, Van Rensselaer had an advantage — his agents needed to employ little persuasion to induce some Gooiers and Veluwers to migrate to more fruitful regions where the farming would be less difficult. In addition, he could depend on the indirect support of his nephew Wouter van Twiller, who had been appointed Director of New Netherland in 1632, and with whom he engaged in friendly correspondence at a time when Dutch directors opposed the patroons in every way. In 1634 he collaborated with Michael Reyniersz Pauw, the patroon of Pavonia on shipping cattle.|$|E
