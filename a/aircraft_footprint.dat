40|$|Conformal antennas {{might have}} an {{important}} impact on communication and navigation applications on aircraft, ships and other vehicles. This thesis work presents a general study on conformal antennas and their potential application on aircraft structures. Several electromagnetic simulations are performed {{in order to provide}} a comparative analysis of arbitrary conformal antennas with their planar counterparts and determine {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} each case. The worthiness of integrating these antennas on aircraft fuselages is investigated by simulating the antennas on an <b>aircraft</b> <b>footprint.</b> In addition, a new type of conformal antenna is introduced. Some attractive characteristics of this antenna are its nearly omnidirectional radiation patterns and its small physical size compared to other microstrip antennas of the same frequency range. A prototype of this new structure is designed for the Galileo frequency band E 1 (1. 559 - 1. 591 GHz) and circular polarization i...|$|E

We believe that a tool able to quickly generate an up-to-date high resolution aerial view, e. g. shortly after a natural disaster or a big incident occurs, can be a highly valuable asset to help first responders in the decision making. The presented work focuses on the path planning capabilities of the system, together with the area partitioning and workload distribution among a team of multi-rotor unmanned <b>aircraft.</b> Sensor <b>footprint</b> and range of the involved aircraft may differ. The presented approach {{is based on an}} approximate cellular decomposition of the area of interest. The results of this work will be integrated into an existing system which already provides a mobile ground control station able to supervise and control multiple sensor carriers...|$|R

These <b>aircraft</b> feature low <b>footprint</b> temperature and pressure thrust augmenting ejectors in the wings for vertical lift, combined with a low wing loading, low wave drag airframe for outstanding cruise and supersonic performance. Aerodynamic, propulsion, performance, and mass properties were determined and are presented for each aircraft.

40|$|In {{attempts}} to reduce population exposure to aircraft noise near large airports, current approach and departure routes {{have been developed}} based upon population analyses and static meteorological climatologies as implemented for example in the FAA Integrated Noise Model (INM). However, commercial aircraft have noise “footprints ” that are determined {{not only by the}} operational configuration of the aircraft but also by the highly variable atmospheric environment through which the sound is propagating. The existing approach and departure routes do not reflect these dynamically changing patterns of noise dispersion and propagation. This paper {{attempts to}} quantify the influence of meteorological variability on the shape and extent of <b>aircraft</b> acoustic <b>footprints</b> by using a sound propagation model to predict the acoustic propagation patterns. Both idealized meteorological profiles and actual profiles from soundings are used in the evaluation. For the cases examined, the acoustic footprint is usually smaller than that predicted by the INM, but can also be substantially larger in particular directions around the aircraft due to sound channeling by low level wind shears. With the combined use of a sound model and meteorological measurements and/or forecasts {{it may be possible to}} develop runway use strategies to minimize population exposure to aircraft noise while reducing the adverse effects of noise abatement procedures on airport operations...|$|R
40|$|A {{deep market}} {{analysis}} on the regional and commuter aircraft has revealed that nowadays the volatility of oil price (more and more prone to international political crises), the huge growth of air transport traffic and the increasing attention to the <b>aircraft</b> environmental <b>footprint</b> considerably lead the interest of specialists towards new configurations of regional and commuter transport aircraft. Also the major airlines in this segment have been addressing the replacement for many hundreds of heritage airplanes in the 20 - 150 seats categories currently in service around the world. Turboprop configuration could be the ideal answer to this request. An innovative turboprop configuration with a rear propeller installation {{can lead to a}} cleaner wing with possibilities to achieve laminar flow extension. In addition the wing without engine nacelle and free of propeller interference effects will be characterized by a more efficient high-lift system with a possible increase in aircraft maximum lift coefficient which will positively affect the ground performances. The analysis of the proposed innovative configuration with rear propeller installation, {{which is one of the}} main topics dealt by the IRON project proposal, is characterized by several aerodynamic, performance and propulsion feature that must be predicted with high accuracy and deep comprehension of involved phenomena in order to lead to a possible improved configuration respect to the classical configuration with wing-mounted engines. The IRON project will also address the conventional (wing mounted propeller) turboprop configuration. In this case one of the key element is the reduction of the perceived annoyance due to propeller noise emissions. A low-noise propeller system will be designed after exploring emerging technologies. This achievement will be attained while preserving the propulsion efficiency because of its high impact on economic, environmental and social issues...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the years}} {{gradually}} flight management {{systems have been}} added to airplanes which reduce pilot workload and increase safety. These systems however do not provide an adequate response when in an emergency situation the aircraft loses all thrust. A system that creates glide trajectories to airports that are reachable would enable pilots to focus their attention on stabilizing and regaining control in an in-flight emergency situation. The objective {{of this study is to}} develop such an emergency flight system that can generate glide trajectories from the position at which the emergency starts to all reachable runways. By first determining the maximum range of the <b>aircraft,</b> a <b>footprint</b> is defined in which the reachable runways are identified. To reduce risk on board as well as on the ground, the trajectories generated must be balanced between flying over populated areas effectively increasing the risk of loss of life on ground or avoiding populated areas possibly increasing the risk of losing control of the aircraft by having to be airborne for a longer period of time. The trajectories to all reachable runways are ranked based on several airport and runway quality factors and are presented to the pilot to choose from. The trajectories are generated by an Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP) algorithm which is commonly used in robotics for path planning. In this research it is investigated if it can also be applied in the field of aeronautics for the purpose of an on line emergency trajectory planner. In a test scenarios, trajectories are generated by several ADP variants and compared with a benchmark trajectory created by the A* algorithm. This algorithm generates optimal obstacle avoiding trajectories providing certain conditions are met. The ADP variants that provides the best result is chosen to generate the trajectories for the emergency trajectory planner in a scenario in which the aircraft has to generate trajectories to the reachable airports in the footprint. From the results it could be concluded that approximate dynamic programming can successfully create trajectories to all reachable airports in the footprint. It however proves less suitable to create trajectories on line in emergency situations because the time the algorithm needs to create trajectories is too long to be able to implement it in emergency situations.

40|$|A CFD {{analysis}} of the near-field sonic boom environment of several low boom High Speed Civilian Transport (HSCT) concepts is presented. The CFD method utilizes a multi-block Euler marching code {{within the context of}} an innovative mesh topology that allows for the resolution of shock waves several body lengths from the <b>aircraft.</b> Three-dimensional pressure <b>footprints</b> at one body length below three-different low boom aircraft concepts are presented. Models of two concepts designed by NASA to cruise at Mach 2 and Mach 3 were built and tested in the wind tunnel. The third concept was designed by Boeing to cruise at Mach 1. 7. Centerline and sideline samples of these footprints are then extrapolated to the ground using a linear waveform parameter method to estimate the ground signatures or sonic boom ground overpressure levels. The Mach 2 concept achieved its centerline design signature but indicated higher sideline booms due to the outboard wing crank of the configuration. Nacelles are also included on two of NASA's low boom concepts. Computations are carried out for both flow-through nacelles and nacelles with engine exhaust simulation. The flow-through nacelles with the assumption of zero spillage and zero inlet lip radius showed very little effect on the sonic boom signatures. On the other hand, it was shown that the engine exhaust plumes can {{have an effect on the}} levels of overpressure reaching the ground depending on the engine operating conditions. The results of this study indicate that engine integration into a low boom design should be given some attention...|$|R
40|$|The Development of Methodologies for the Aerodynamic Design and Optimization of New Regional Turboprop Aircraft is {{presented}} proposing innovative procedures and tools {{to improve the}} aerodynamic of this aircraft category. Nowadays the increase in oil price, the huge growth of air transport traffic and the increasing attention to the <b>aircraft</b> environmental <b>footprint</b> led to considerable interest of specialists in new configurations of regional transport aircraft. Airlines and aircraft industries forecast in {{the next twenty years}} about 12000 turboprop aircraft will be delivered. Of these aircraft about 7000 will replace the older turboprop which reach their product life-cycle, while the remaining amount of about 6000 aircraft will be new turboprop aircrafts to satisfy market needs. The 61 % of new turboprop delivered expected to be under 70 seats category (20 % under 50 seats and 41 % of 70 seats), while the new 90 + seat segment is a strong percentage of the total, i. e. the 39 %. For these reasons this work aims to provide some guidelines in the aerodynamic design of future regional turboprop aircraft with about 90 or more passengers. Currently there are no configurations on the market of this type, so a typical 70 passengers turboprop aircraft is taken as reference starting point to put in evidence those aircraft components which particularly affects the "aerodynamic", especially in terms of aerodynamic drag. Particular emphasis is posed on aircraft performance, to highlight how a more accurate aerodynamic design can improve aircraft performance and so give aerodynamic guidelines in the design of new turboprop aircraft configurations. Research work can be divided into three main topics:i) airfoil design and optimization, ii) aircraft components design and optimization and iii) vertical tail design. Airfoil design and optimization is a typical aeronautic topic, which involves several aspects such as parameterization techniques, optimization algorithms and aerodynamic solvers. These aspects have been analyzed and put together into a user friendly code which allows to design and optimize a generic airfoil geometry choosing i) the parameterization technique, ii) the optimization algorithm and iii) the aerodynamic solver. Constraints and multi-objective optimization have been performed, highlighting the crucial features in the design and optimization of a regional turboprop airfoil. The second topic aims to provide an optimization procedure for several aircraft components, fast to use also in a preliminary design phase. By coupling non uniform rational b-spline (NURBS) and a panel code aerodynamic solver, the geometry of a regional turboprop nose, wing-fuselage junction and undercarriage vane have been optimized to reduce aircraft aerodynamic drag. Particular emphasis has been also posed on the winglet design, highlighting how an accurate design can give an improvement in the whole regional aircraft flight envelope. The last topic involves the design of vertical tail plane for turboprop aircraft. This is a crucial topic for all twin-engine commuter aircraft because of all the ground performance are strictly related to the minimum control speed (VMC) which mainly depends from the engine failure speed (VEF), clearly related to vertical tail design. As a matter of fact both Part 23 and Part 25 of the aircraft regulations relates the certification speeds (especially for ground performance) to the VMC; the lower will be the last, the better will be the performance. Moreover a performance improvement also means the commercial success of an aircraft, given the capability to be more competitive in several scenarios respect to competitors. In this research work, using a Navier-Stokes aerodynamic solver, a new method named VeDSC (Vertical tail Design Stability and Control) to design a vertical tail and a rudder has been carried out. More than 300 Navier-Stokes runs have been performed to accomplish with the objective. Particular care has been posed to the software set-up and several test-cases have been performed to validate the methodology. Finally the new method has been applied to several turboprop and twin-engine commuter aircraft and compared to typical semi-empirical methodologies to highlight the capabilities and reliability...|$|R
40|$|As {{projected}} {{air travel}} {{is expected to}} increase up till 2030, future airports are faced to deal with the impact of (rising) noise hinder within their environment and the resulting allowed attainable throughput capacity. To date, several proposed techniques are able to lower the noise contribution. This thesis study focusses on weather-adaptive trajectory optimization, in which departure trajectories - subjected to day-to-day meteorological variations - are reshaped {{in such a way that}} inhabited areas are (partly) avoided to exposed noise areas generated by the aircraft. Incorporating day-to-day meteorological variability into trajectory optimization leads to an enhancement over reference-day trajectory optimization. This enhancement allows for improved accuracy with respect to the aircraft performance- and noise footprint calculations. The accuracy increase can be used to generate opportunities to improve the reference-day optimized trajectories even further. This led to the following purpose statement: The aim of this thesis work is to accurately represent the noise footprint by means of quantifying the influence of meteorological variability of the effects in wind and temperature variations on the shape and extent of <b>aircraft</b> acoustic <b>footprints</b> and use this information to optimize aircraft trajectories for diverse objectives. For this purpose, the FORT reference-day optimization tool is extended with weather dependent effects in an accurate and computationally tractable manner. The enhanced, weather-adaptive, FORT tool is able to optimize flight trajectories with respect to time, fuel, emissions, and awakenings objectives at any given airport for several departure procedures. Within FORT, the noise submodel is based on the INM methodology and enhanced with daily varying excess attenuation. This day-to-day varying excess attenuation replaces the lateral attenuation correction, which represented average yearly excess attenuation. The day-to- day excess attenuation is accessed for various noise-observer distances by means of an EA-database. In this way, the noise submodel employs a table lookup approach for both its NPD- and EA-calculations, maintaining simple and fast lookup table calculations while allowing complex evaluation of atmospheric effects on noise contours. Aircraft and acoustic performance is significantly influenced by varying temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and wind direction layers. A positive temperature lapse rate distribution leads to upward ray path refraction, causing shadow zones, where a negative lapse rate results in downward refraction, causing caustics formation. Furthermore, the combination of temperature and relative humidity have a significant effect on the amount of acoustic absorption. Finally, the combination of temperature and wind layers induce greater speed of sound differences. This greater difference leads to a stronger presence of shadow zones and caustics phenomena, which can be used to eliminate noise at populated areas. Meteorological phenomena, which are seasonal dependent, cause the temperature, relative humidity, and wind profile distribution in the troposphere to vary, which results into different day-to-day aircraft and acoustic performance. The impact of weather-adaptive optimization is assessed by means of a case study in which two departure trajectories are optimized for multiple objectives, while being subjected to several atmospheric profiles. The two departures are based on standard instrument departures currently in use at AAS. The weather-adaptive trajectory optimization model complies with all the regulations and guidelines applicable to departure trajectories prescribed by PANSOPS and AAS in order to create a realistic and feasible trajectory. The atmospheric profiles incorporate temperature-, relative humidity-, wind speed-, and wind direction distribution differences to show the impact of seasonal effects on the optimization outcome. The weather-adaptive optimization results are compared to both reference-day optimization results and standard departure trajectories executed at AAS. For both cases, significant differences in aircraft- and acoustic performance are obtained for all objectives (time, fuel, emission, and awakenings). Firstly, when comparing the reference-day optimization to the results of the weather-adaptive optimization, it is concluded that the true impact of reference-day optimized trajectories on time, fuel, emission, and awakenings objectives differ significantly when subjected to a nonreference- day atmospheric profile. The time, fuel, and emission objectives are dependent on aircraft performance and are therefore affected by the varying wind speed and direction profile. The awakenings objective is both affected by the aircraft- and acoustic performance and therefore influenced by the full atmospheric profile. Secondly, for both standard AAS departure trajectories and reference-day optimized trajectories, it is concluded that the weather-adaptive optimization is able to generate an opportunity to further decrease the objectives. FORT utilizes the atmosphere in a positive manner, by means of aircraft performance advantages and acoustic focussing effects (e. g. directing shadow zones towards unpopulated areas). Finally, it can be concluded that the inclusion of meteorological variability into trajectory optimization leads to improved accuracy of the aircraft- and acoustic performance in general. These results create a better understanding about the atmospheric effects in terms of aircraft performance and subsequent noise contours. Furthermore, the weather-adaptive model is able to use the accuracy increase to further decrease the awakenings impact. For future work, the results can be further improved by analyzing different aircraft types on trajectory optimization output. Furthermore, the combination of multiple simultaneous optimized arrival- and departure trajectory optimizations could be researched in order to improve the feasibility of the current established trajectories with respect to separation requirements. Last but not least, societal costs play a major role when optimizing the awakenings objective. In certain cases, the total number of awakenings can be reduced significantly. This decrease however, may be at the expense of accompanying societal costs as new trajectories could induce complaints and other forthcoming societal costs when flying over different populated areas. The impact of changing the trajectories with respect to social aspects could be researched in more detail to establish societal feasibility of the optimized trajectories.
