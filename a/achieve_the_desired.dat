5|$|Because it hardens {{platinum}} and palladium alloys, ruthenium is used {{in electrical}} contacts, where a thin film is sufficient to <b>achieve</b> <b>the</b> <b>desired</b> durability. With similar properties and lower cost than rhodium, electric contacts are a major use of ruthenium. The plate {{is applied to the}} base by electroplating or sputtering.|$|E
5|$|Dark beers {{are usually}} brewed from a pale malt or lager malt base {{with a small}} {{proportion}} of darker malt added to <b>achieve</b> <b>the</b> <b>desired</b> shade. Other colourants—such as caramel—are also widely used to darken beers. Very dark beers, such as stout, use dark or patent malts that have been roasted longer. Some have roasted unmalted barley.|$|E

5|$|Phase {{truncation}} spurs can {{be reduced}} substantially {{by the introduction of}} white gaussian noise prior to truncation. The so-called dither noise is summed into the lower W+1 bits of the PA output word to linearize the truncation operation. Often the improvement can be achieved without penalty because the DAC noise floor tends to dominate system performance. Amplitude truncation spurs can not be mitigated in this fashion. Introduction of noise into the static values held in the PAC ROMs would not eliminate the cyclicality of the truncation error terms and thus would not <b>achieve</b> <b>the</b> <b>desired</b> effect.|$|E
5|$|The series {{tells the}} story of the {{citizens}} of Kurōzu-cho, a fictional city which is plagued by a supernatural curse involving spirals. The story for Uzumaki originated when Ito attempted to write a story about people living in a very long terraced house, and he was inspired to use a spiral shape to <b>achieve</b> <b>the</b> <b>desired</b> length. Ito believes the horror of Uzumaki is effective due to its subversion of symbols which are normally positively portrayed in Japanese media, and its theme of protagonists struggling against a mysterious force stronger than themselves.|$|E
5|$|After Khan's {{departure}} from Comilla, the cooperative's model failed in independent Bangladesh because {{only a few}} occupational groups managed to <b>achieve</b> <b>the</b> <b>desired</b> success. By 1979, only 61 of the 400 cooperatives were functioning. The model actually fell prey to the ineffective internal and external controls, stagnation, and diversion of funds. This prompted the subsequent scholars and practitioners in microfinance, such as Muhammad Yunus of Grameen Bank and Fazle Hasan Abed of BRAC, to abandon the cooperative approach in favour of more centralised control and service delivery structures. The new strategy targeted the poorest villagers, while excluding the 'less poor'. However, Khan's leadership skills {{during the course of}} his association with the project remained a source of inspiration for these leaders, as well as other participatory development initiatives in the country.|$|E

5|$|George Holdcroft {{composed}} the score for The FP. He {{was invited to}} a screening of the film by producer Christian Agypt, {{and asked if he}} could compose the music for it. Holdcroft, who lived in Chicago at the time, spent 12 hours a day composing the score and e-mailed his compositions to the Trost brothers. To emulate the sound of a choir for one song, Holdcroft sang the same segment more than 200 times using different voices and melodies to <b>achieve</b> <b>the</b> <b>desired</b> result. For another song, he sang in falsetto and altered the pitch of his voice to make himself sound like a woman.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{most other}} episodes, the scenes which {{featured}} multiple clones were filmed using traditional locked-off cameras {{rather than the}} time-consuming Technodolly camera set-up. The episode featured the longest continuous shot filmed in Orphan Black, where a scene between Felix, Tony and Sarah was filmed in one take. It took almost three days to film the 15-second sequence of Scott drilling into Kira's tooth, involving three rented cameras and a prop tooth that was painted red inside and filled with white dust to <b>achieve</b> <b>the</b> <b>desired</b> effect when drilled into. The scene in which Cosima and Delphine use a vaporiser to get high was mostly improvised by Maslany and Brochu; instead of inhaling actual helium, the pitch of their voices was altered in post-production. A stunt double {{was used for the}} second-to-last scene, wherein Cosima falls to the ground after vomiting blood.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, Thornton {{returned}} to New Zealand {{to serve as}} the Quartermaster General of the New Zealand Army, and this was followed as a term from 1956 to 1958 as its Adjutant General. During this period, he was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire. In 1955, New Zealand {{became a member of the}} South East Asian Treaty Organisation (SEATO) and in July 1958, Thornton moved to Bangkok, where he served as head of the Military Planning Office of SEATO. In this capacity, he gained valuable insight in the scenarios in which New Zealand's military might be expected to play a part. The following year he was promoted to acting major general and appointed Chief of the General Staff (CGS), the youngest ever to serve in this role which was effectively the commander of the New Zealand Army. This was to prove a challenging term for Thornton for, driven by the Labour Government, there was a significant change in New Zealand defence policy. Since the Second World War, defence planning had been based around the concept of an infantry division being raised largely from the Territorial Force. This had now changed to a self-sufficient brigade-sized force made up of a combination of Regular and Territorial Force personnel. While not a policy Thornton personally agreed with, he oversaw the reorganisation that was required to <b>achieve</b> <b>the</b> <b>desired</b> structure and this saw some longstanding regiments being amalgamated. In 1962, part way through his term as CGS, he was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath.|$|E
