American sources donating through the United States Operations Mission (USOM) were responsible for 97% of the aid. The USOM sent public health professionals to help with sanitation in an attempt {{to prevent the spread of}} disease. Doctors and nurses were sent to help train local workers in healthcare procedures, so that they would eventually be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of the medical needs refugees. In order of contributions to the aid efforts, the US were followed by France, United Kingdom, Australia, West Germany, New Zealand and the Netherlands. Australian sent farming equipment and accompanying technical instructors under the Colombo Plan.|$|E

25|$|In the past, {{the battle}} on the Nessos was {{identified}} as the Battle of Naissus, but modern scholarship has rejected this view. On the contrary, there is a theory that the victory at Nessos was so decisive that Claudius' efforts against the Goths (including the battle of Naissus) {{were no more than}} a mopping-up operation. After his victory, Gallienus left Marcian in place and hastily left for Italy, intending to suppress the revolt of his cavalry officer Aureolus. After Gallienus was assassinated outside Milan in the summer of 268 in a plot led by high officers in his army, Claudius was proclaimed emperor and headed to Rome to establish his rule. Claudius' immediate concerns were with the Alemanni, who had invaded Raetia and Italy.

[...] He added that, [...] "I used to think the core of me was in politics, probably. It isn't.

40|$|We {{report a}} case of an octogenarian woman who {{suffered}} from cardiogenic shock following an inferolateral myocardial infarction extending to the right ventricle associated with complete atrioventricular heart block. Her initial status was critical with a poor prognosis. She requested an invasive full management <b>to</b> be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> continue <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of her ill husband. She was managed with circulatory assistance, temporary pacing and percutaneous coronary intervention. The procedure was successfully performed and the patient showed a remarkable improvement in clinical condition. Cardiogenic shock complicating right heart ventricle in elderly requires careful patient selection for invasive strategies that can sometimes rely on {{the willingness of the}} patient, as the procedural outcome appears to be poor in this high-risk population...|$|R

2500|$|Further, {{this too}} should be said. Anyone who asserts that god exists either says that god {{takes care of}} the things in the cosmos or that he does not, and, if he does take care, that it is either of all things or of some. Now if he takes care of everything, there would be no {{particular}} evil thing and no evil in general in the but the Dogmatists say that everything is full of evil; therefore god shall not be said to take care of everything. On the other hand, if he takes care of only some things, why does he take care of these and not of those? For either he wishes but is not able, or he is able but does not wish, or he neither wishes nor is able. If he both wished and was able, he would have taken care of everything; but, for the reasons stated above, he does not take care of everything; therefore, it is not the case that he both wishes and is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of everything. But if he wishes and is not able, he is weaker than the cause on account of which he is not <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of the things of which he does not take care; but it is contrary to the concept of god that he should be weaker than anything. Again, if he is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of everything but does not wish to do so, he will be considered malevolent, and if he neither wishes nor is able, he is both malevolent and weak; but to say that about god is impious. Therefore, god does not take care of the things in the cosmos.|$|E

Three weeks after Bankhead's birth, her mother died of blood poisoning (septicemia) on February 23, 1902. Coincidentally, her maternal grandmother had died giving birth to her mother.

40|$|An {{adequate}} {{library is}} absolutely essential for the operation of a modern law school. Fortunately the law building is satisfactory in most respects due to the generosity of the alumni {{and friends of the}} Law School.

2500|$|If {{our society}} were {{to follow in}} the {{footsteps}} of other countries who allow paid time off for taking care of sick children or even for having children our country might be able to get rid of the welfare program.

Employers would have to allow parents to leave work to take care of children and they would have to pay them for it as well.

2500|$|In 1902 the Kentucky state {{assembly}} unanimously {{approved the}} building of a veterans home specifically for Confederate veterans of the American Civil War by the cemetery. It was done at the behest of former Confederate officer Bennett H. Young, who had long desired such a facility as he saw many former Confederate veterans were no longer <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of themselves. After Young's group acquired $16,000, the legislation was approved. [...] Young's group of Confederate veterans and the Daughters of the Confederacy chose the Villa Ridge site just outside the cemetery, as it was well-sited and very inexpensive compared to what it had cost to build in 1889. The cemetery was established shortly after the hospital was opened, with the special monument built soon afterwards. The total area of the home and cemetery was 11,275 square feet.|$|E

[...] The Woodman, it appears, has also recently been {{responsible for the death of}} Michael Kingston, an agent with whom Helm has just worked in an earlier book. [...] Helm, the veteran counter-assassin, is ordered by Mac to get into position to remove the Woodman—permanently.

2500|$|The {{earliest}} extant {{appearance of}} the word in Latin literature occurs in a fragment from the soldiers' chorus in the Iphigenia of Ennius, where it is contrasted to negotium. Researches have determined the etymological and semantic use of otium was never a direct translation of the Greek word [...] "schole", but derived from specifically Roman contexts. Otium {{is an example of}} the usage of the term [...] "praeterpropter", meaning more or less of leisure. It was first used in military terms related to inactivity during war. In ancient Roman times soldiers were many times unoccupied, resting and bored to death when not at war (i.e., winter months, weather not permitting war). This was associated with otium otiosum (unoccupied and pointless leisure—idle leisure). The opposite of this was otium negotiosum (busy leisure) - leisure with a satisfying hobby or being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of one's personal affairs or one's own estate. This was otium privatum (private leisure), equal to negotium (a type of business).|$|E

Ah, now I will leave you unprovided for.' And as he spoke these words, 'suddenly he vomited —it gushed out of him in an arc— it was brown, and he was dead.'" [...] Mozart's older, seven-year-old son Karl was present at his father's death and later wrote, [...] "Particularly remarkable is in my opinion the fact that a few days before he died, his whole body became so swollen that the patient was unable to make the smallest movement, moreover, there was stench, which reflected an internal disintegration which, after death, increased to the extent that an autopsy was impossible." ...|$|E
