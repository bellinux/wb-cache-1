5|$|Each Clan has an {{identical}} hierarchical system. From birth, newborn kittens {{are known as}} ‘kits’, {{as evidenced by the}} ‘-kit’ suffix {{at the end of their}} name. Parents of the kits choose the names; often, a name is related to their appearance (‘Graykit’), an element of nature (‘Sandkit’), or in regards to how the parent felt when the kit was born (‘Brokenkit’). Mothers, known as ‘queens’, then look after their kits for their first six months of life. Kits are expected to stay in camp at all times, <b>and</b> <b>sleep</b> <b>in</b> a designated and comfortable area known as the ‘nursery’.|$|E
5|$|Once a kit {{has reached}} six moons old, they become ‘{{apprentice}}s’. As {{a mark of}} this, each kit is now given the suffix ‘paw’. For example, ‘Graykit’ would become ‘Graypaw’. An apprentice is then assigned to a ‘mentor’. Mentors are often carefully chosen {{in order to fulfill}} an apprentice’s full potential; for example, a rather highly-strung apprentice would be given to a calmer mentor, whilst a more timid apprentice would be given to a mentor known for their bravery. It is the job of a mentor to train their apprentice for any given situation, teaching them to hunt, fight, and patrol borders. Apprentices move out of the nursery <b>and</b> <b>sleep</b> <b>in</b> their own separate den. In addition to training, apprentices are also tasked with keeping the camp clean.|$|E

5|$|In the 1990s the Elephant 6 collective, {{including}} {{acts like}} The Apples in Stereo, The Olivia Tremor Control, Neutral Milk Hotel, Elf Power and of Montreal, produced eclectic psychedelic rock and folk. Other alternative acts to pursue psychedelia from the 1990s included The Brian Jonestown Massacre, The Dandy Warhols, Kula Shaker and Super Furry Animals. Stoner rock also emerged, combining elements of psychedelic rock, blues-rock and doom metal. Typically using a slow-to-mid tempo and featuring low-tuned guitars in a bass-heavy sound, with melodic vocals, and 'retro' production, it was pioneered by the Californian bands Kyuss <b>and</b> <b>Sleep.</b> <b>In</b> the UK the Madchester scene influenced the early sound of 1990s Britpop bands like Blur. The Verve mixed on 1960s psychedelia with the shoegazing aesthetic. Oasis also drew on 1960s psychedelic pop and rock. In the immediate post-Britpop era Kula Shaker incorporated swirling, guitar-heavy sounds of late-'60s psychedelia with Indian mysticism and spirituality. In {{the new millennium}} neo-psychedelia was continued by bands directly emulating {{the sounds of the}} 60s such as The Black Angels, Tame Impala, Pond, King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard, Unknown Mortal Orchestra and The Essex Green, while bands like Animal Collective and The Bright Light Social Hour applied an experimental approach that combined genres from the 1960s and the present.M.

The reasons for this may be linked to different memory traces resulting from different encoding strategies, as well as with different electrophysiological changes during daytime sleep.|$|E

The second {{reason is that the}} dog is a shameless animal, and they make a cult of shamelessness, not as being beneath modesty, but as superior to it. The third reason is that the dog is a good guard, and they guard the tenets of their philosophy. The fourth reason is that the dog is a discriminating animal which can distinguish between its friends and enemies. So do they recognize as friends those who are suited to philosophy, and receive them kindly, while those unfitted they drive away, like dogs, by barking at them.|$|E

500|$|Sleeper berth time is {{any amount}} of time spent inside the sleeper berth (e.g., resting or sleeping). FMCSA {{regulation}} §393.76 gives the minimum requirements for a space to be defined as a sleeper berth. The simple definition is an area separate from (usually immediately behind) the driving controls that includes a bed. The rules do not explicitly require that a driver must sleep, only that a driver must take a period of [...] "rest" [...] within the sleeper berth or off-duty (i.e., home). A statement made by the ICC in 1937 gives the reason: [...] "We have no control over the manner in which a driver may spend his time off-duty, although some of his spare time activities may tire him as much as any work would do. We can only emphasize, by this comment, the responsibility which is the driver's own to assure himself of adequate rest <b>and</b> <b>sleep,</b> <b>in</b> the time available for this purpose, to ensure safety of his driving, and likewise the employer's responsibility to see that his drivers report for work in fit condition." ...|$|E
500|$|Because {{they get}} so little energy from their diet, koalas must limit their energy use and sleep 20 {{hours a day}}; only 4 hours a day are spent in active movement.

On very hot days, a koala may climb down to the coolest part of the tree which is cooler than the surrounding air. [...] The koala hugs the tree to lose heat without panting. On warm days, a koala may rest with its back against a branch or lie on its stomach or back with its limbs dangling. During cold, wet periods, it curls itself into a tight ball to conserve energy. On windy days, a koala finds a lower, thicker branch on which to rest. While it spends most of the time in the tree, the animal descends to the ground to move to another tree, walking on all fours. The koala usually grooms itself with its hindpaws, but sometimes uses its forepaws or mouth.|$|E

500|$|The English {{tradition}} of semi-opera, to which The Fairy-Queen belongs, demanded {{that most of}} the music within the play be introduced through the agency of supernatural beings, the exception being pastoral or drunken characters. All the masques in The Fairy-Queen are presented by Titania or Oberon. Originally Act I contained no music, but due to the work's enormous success it was revived in 1693, when Purcell added the scene of the Drunken Poet and two further songs later on in the work; [...] "Ye gentle spirits of the air" [...] and [...] "The Plaint". As noted above, each masque is subtly related to the action in the play during that particular act in a metaphorical way. In this manner we have Night <b>and</b> <b>Sleep</b> <b>in</b> Act II, which is apt as that act of the play consists of Oberon's plans to use the power of the [...] "love-in-idleness" [...] flower to confuse various loves, and it is therefore appropriate for the allegorical figures of Secrecy, Mystery et al. to [...] usher in a night of enchantment. The masque for Bottom in Act III includes metamorphoses, songs of both real and feigned love, and beings who are not what they seem. The Reconciliation masque between Oberon and Titania at the end of Act IV prefigures the final masque. The scene changes to a Garden of Fountains, denoting King William's hobby, just after Oberon says [...] "bless these Lovers' Nuptial Day". The Four Seasons tell us that the marriage here celebrated is a good one all year round and [...] "All Salute the rising Sun"/...The Birthday of King Oberon". The kings of England were traditionally likened to the sun (Oberon = William. Significantly, William and Mary were married on his birthday, 4 November.). The Chinese scene in the final masque is in homage to Queen Mary's famous collection of china. The garden shown above it and the exotic animals bring King William back into the picture and Hymen's song in praise of their marriage, plus the stage direction bringing (Mary's) china vases containing (William's) orange trees {{to the front of the}} stage complete the symbolism.|$|E
500|$|The Bala Kanda {{mentions}} that Gautama spots Indra, {{who is still}} in disguise, and curses him to lose his testicles. Gautama then curses Ahalya to remain invisible to all beings for thousands of years, fast by subsisting only on air, suffer <b>and</b> <b>sleep</b> <b>in</b> ashes and be tormented by guilt. Nevertheless, he assures her that her sin will be expiated once she extends her hospitality to Rama, who will visit the ashram. Thereafter, Gautama abandons the ashram {{and goes to the}} Himalayas to practise asceticism. The Ayodhya prince Rama, his brother Lakshmana and their guru, the sage Vishvamitra pass Gautama's desolate ashram while travelling to King Janaka's court in Mithila. As they near the ashram, Vishvamitra recounts the tale of Ahalya's curse and instructs Rama to save Ahalya. Although Ahalya is cursed, Vishvamitra nevertheless describes her as goddess-like and illustrious, repeatedly calling her mahabhaga, a Sanskrit compound (maha and bhaga) translated as [...] "most illustrious and highly distinguished"; this interpretation contrasts with that of Rambhadracharya, who believes that the word mahabhaga, in the context of Ahalya's story, means [...] "extremely unfortunate" [...] (maha and abhaga). Following Vishvamitra, the princes enter the ashram to see Ahalya, who, up till then, had been hidden from the universe. Ahalya is described as glowing from the intensity of her ascetic devotion, but hidden from the world like the Sun obscured by dark clouds, the light of a full moon hidden by mist or a blazing flame masked by smoke. Under the direction of his guru, Rama considers Ahalya pure and unblemished and, accompanied by Lakshamana, gives her obeisance by touching her feet, an act that restores her social status. She greets them, recalling Gautama's words that Rama would be her redeemer. Ahalya extends her warmest reception, making a [...] "welcome offering" [...] of forest fruits and washing their feet, an act of respect according to the rites of that era. The gods and other celestial beings shower Rama and Ahalya with flowers and bow to Ahalya, who has been purified through her penance. Gautama then returns to his ashram and accepts her.In one instance in the Mahabharata, Indra {{is said to have been}} cursed by having his beard turned to gold as he seduces Ahalya, while a curse by Kaushika (sometimes interpreted as synonymous to Gautama) is cited as the reason for his castration. In the Uttara Kanda, Indra is cursed to lose his throne and endure captivity and bear half the sin of every rape ever committed, while the innocent Ahalya is cursed to lose her status as the most beautiful woman, as it had prompted Indra's seduction. Ahalya claims her innocence (this part is not found in all manuscripts), but Gautama agrees to accept her only when she is sanctified by offering Rama hospitality.|$|E
