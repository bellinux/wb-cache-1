This descriptive study was limited by examining the decisions and applications related to connecting theory <b>and</b> <b>practice</b> in pre-service teacher education since 1998. Results are organized by concerning the factors like durations and semesters of field experiences, efficiencies of the stakeholders of teacher education programs. In conclusion connecting theoy <b>and</b> <b>practice</b> in pre-service teacher education is considered important in Turkey. However the policies on this issue in Turkey can be criticized; and the stakeholders of teacher education programs are not efficiacy on connecting theory <b>and</b> <b>practice.</b> <b>And</b> the study presents recommendations for enhancing connecting theory <b>and</b> <b>practice</b> in pre-service teacher education as follows: University-School Cooperation Protocol should include methods courses, directors of universities <b>and</b> <b>practice</b> schools should promote other stakeholders for connecting theory <b>and</b> <b>practice,</b> faculties should indigenize connecting theory <b>and</b> <b>practice</b> in teacher education and, cooperating teachers should be good models for teacher candidates in terms of connecting theory <b>and</b> <b>practice...</b>|$|R

5|$|A new Prisons Act {{was passed}} in 1981, which updated the 1903 act and its eleven {{amendments}} with modern philosophies <b>and</b> <b>practices</b> – codifying departmental orders, instructions, and policy documents.

The result was legislation criticised by the Criminal Lawyers Association, academics, and newspapers, including for minimal welfare provisions that did little to ensure prisoner welfare. The department was at the same time renamed the Prisons Department once more, to emphasise imprisonment as its primary responsibility.|$|E
