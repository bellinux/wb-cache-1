40|$|For {{the past}} few decades, analog {{voiceband}} modems have been used extensively to carry digital information over the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). Conventional voiceband modems treat the PSTN as an analog communication channel. However, today’s PSTN is mostly a digital network except for the basic telephone services provided via <b>analog</b> <b>subscriber</b> lines. The conventional model of analog voiceband channels is no longer adequate to characterize the physical connection between terminals with direct digital access to the network and voiceband modems connected to <b>analog</b> <b>subscriber</b> lines.

The major source of distortion on the up-stream channel is quantization error caused by analog-to-digital conversion performed {{as part of the}} encoding to Pulse-Code Modulation (PCM) process. A bandpass filter prior to the PCM encoder restricts the bandwidth while the sampling rate of the PCM encoder is predetermined by the network. Signalling in the presence of such constraints lead to theoretical problems as well as practical concerns in modem design. Communication models that characterize PCM voiceband channels are developed. We investigate modulation design and related issues including index mapping, constellation design and constellation probability assignment to match the pre-determined structure of the detector at the receiver, i. e., the PCM encoder at the central office. We develop a framework for transmitter structures that can avoid or reduce Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI) at the receiver in order to sidestep the limited bandwidth of the up-stream channels and the fixed sampling rate of the up-stream channel. Techniques employed include linear filtering, spectral shaping and precoding to reduce the ISI, while limiting the average transmitted signal power. A filterbank structure for pre-equalizing channels with spectral nulls is also described. A new method for pulse shaping design is proposed. The new pulse shaping filters provide a compatible design {{that can be used for}} the up-stream PCM channel as well as to the cascade of the up-stream and the down-stream channels. Compared to conventional modem design, the proposed modulation and pre-equalization techniques together allow for an increase of the data transmission rates in the up-stream direction of up to 50 %...|$|R

An equalizer transfer function is approximated so as to minimize intersymbol interference of an isolated pulse response. Optimum pole-zero location, which is suited to line characteristics in a wide frequency band, is also discussed. In order to attain high accuracy capacitor ratios using a small unit capacitor, capacitor values are rounded off into equivalent integer values, and are discretely optimized using pole-zero deviation as an error criterion. The equalizer has {{a finite number of}} frequency responses which correspond to line lengths. Gain and delay time differences between the adjoining step responses are compressed. The switched capacitor line equalizer was fabricated using 3 - mu m CMOS technology. Measured data were very close to designed performances...|$|R

CBC television did not broadcast any games, as the CFL and TSN began an exclusive five-year deal. This led some to criticize TSN, because the Grey Cup aired on a cable channel (TSN) while CTV—TSN's majority owner—broadcast regular-season NFL games. Because of obligations to other sporting events, concerns intensified after TSN began relegating some CFL games to its new digital channel TSN2 (which was not available to <b>analog</b> cable <b>subscribers),</b> while other sports, including the NFL, were broadcast. [...] In addition, TSN severely curtailed high-definition coverage for the final three weeks of the regular season, with only five of the twelve games being made available in HD.|$|R

30|$|In {{the analog}} cable TV network, all the {{channels}} are available simultaneously for <b>subscribers.</b> <b>Analog</b> cable TV transmits all the channels at once via a fixed cable to the subscribers, and each active subscriber then chooses a channel for viewing {{by using a}} set-top box (STB). Therefore, channel change is almost instantaneous. But IPTV differs significantly from analog cable TV, in its transmission system. In the IPTV system, a subscriber uses the STB to request for only the specific channel required at that time, and only the required channel is transmitted to this user (possibly by means of multicast).|$|R
40|$|Our modern {{information}} society {{is built on}} the availability and exchange of information {{as an integral part}} of both economic and private life. For example, the amount of traffic carried per year by the world-wide Internet is growing both due to the increasing popularity of private and business usage of the Internet and also due to the increasing number and size of documents available in the World Wide Web (WWW). The information and services offered via the WWW -from scientific research reports to culture and travel information, telephone directory services, dictionaries, train time tables and even online shopping -make this medium very attractive also for private use. The availability of powerful computers, the integration of 'classic' data services for file and document exchange (ftp and e-mail) into easy-to-use WWW browsers also facilitate the growth of world-wide date networks. Today, residential broadband network access is mostly realized via copper pairs (telephone network with <b>analog</b> or digital <b>subscriber</b> lines), coaxial cables (TV cable networks), radio technology (terrestrial or satellite) or even the power supply infrastructure (powerline communication, PLC). Several studies [20 41, 47, 50, 69, 70, 87, 136, 154] claim that in the future, passive optical networks (PON) will gain importance in broadband access. One example for a project building an ATM PON demonstrator wars the BAF (Broadband Access Facilities) project funded by the European Union [26]. In such ATM PON networks special attention needs to be paid to the upstream media access control if the network is required to offer certain quality of service guarantees such as low delay variation on the one hand and statistical multiplexing of the traffic from different subscribers on the other hand. In this thesis, the mechanisms for upstream media access control to be used in passive ATM access networks are classified, studied and compared with respect to their performance, particularly concentrating on delay variation issues.
