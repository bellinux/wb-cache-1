2500|$|The sequel {{takes place}} 10 {{years after the}} events of the first game. While {{organized}} crime has been quelled in Pacific City, a terrorist group calling themselves the Cell started a revolt to overthrow the Agency who has taken control of the city. The Cell's leader and former Agency scientist named Catalina Thorne released a deadly strain of [...] "Freak" [...] virus that infected many citizens and turned them into mindless monsters called Freaks. The Agency tried to stop this epidemic by building Project Sunburst, a weapon that used sunlight to destroy Freaks. However, the Cell took control of Project Sunburt's generators before the <b>Agency</b> <b>can</b> unleash it. This forced the Agency to send out their newer and better equipped Agent to combat both the Cell and the Freaks. The Agent managed to retake the generators from the Cell, but when he tried to activate the main beacon, Thorne appeared in a helicopter and tried to destroy it. The Agent then sacrificed himself by jumping into the helicopter's blades, severely damaging it and forcing Thorn to retreat. Project Sunburst successfully destroyed all Freaks in Pacific City and the place was finally safe at last. A post-credit cut-scene showed Thorn surviving the crash and studying a severed hand from the Agent.|$|E

2500|$|Nicos Mouzelis reconstructed Giddens' {{original}} theories. Mouzelis kept Giddens' original {{formulation of}} structure as [...] "rules and resources." [...] However, {{he was considered}} a dualist, because he argued for dualism to be as important in social analysis as the duality of structure. Mouzelis reexamined human social action at the [...] "syntagmatic" [...] (syntactic) level. He claimed that the duality of structure {{does not account for}} all types of social relationships. Duality of structure works when agents do not question or disrupt rules, and interaction resembles [...] "natural/performative" [...] actions with a practical orientation. However, in other contexts, the relationship between structure and <b>agency</b> <b>can</b> resemble dualism more than duality, such as systems that are the result of powerful agents. In these situations, rules are not viewed as resources, but are in states of transition or redefinition, where actions are seen from a [...] "strategic/monitoring orientation." [...] In this orientation, dualism shows the distance between agents and structures. He called these situations [...] "syntagmatic duality". For example, a professor can change the class he or she teaches, but has little capability to change the larger university structure. [...] "In that case, syntagmatic duality gives way to syntagmatic dualism." [...] This implies that systems are the outcome, but not the medium, of social actions. Mouzelis also criticised Giddens' lack of consideration for social hierarchies.|$|E
