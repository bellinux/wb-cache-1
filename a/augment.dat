40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{is to find out}} if <b>augmented</b> reality can improve people’s {{knowledge}} about archaeology. First of all there is some research about what <b>augmented</b> reality is and the technology {{that can be used to}} create a successful <b>augmented</b> reality application. <b>Augmented</b> reality as it is often used on smartphones in the form of layar applications can be seen some sort of pseudo <b>augmented</b> reality, while real <b>augmented</b> reality applications require much more advanced technology to integrate virtual objects into real world images, and to make more precise tracking possible. Furthermore there are some projects that combine archaeology and <b>augmented</b> reality described in this thesis, with the purpose of finding out which techniques are used and what users think of these techniques and the <b>augmented</b> reality applications in general. Most <b>augmented</b> reality applications have been evaluated, but these evaluations were mostly technical, to find out if an application worked correctly and if there was any room for improvement. There is little information about user experiences with <b>augmented</b> reality applications and the techniques they use. It is only known that people like <b>augmented</b> reality because it is fun and new. There has also been some research into other possibilities of combining archaeology and <b>augmented</b> reality. There are plenty of these possibilities, since most <b>augmented</b> reality applications today are pseudo <b>augmented</b> reality applications, fast to create and cheap layar applications on smartphones. There still are a lot of possibilities in creating real <b>augmented</b> reality applications that integrate virtual objects instead of superimposing them on real world images. These <b>augmented</b> reality applications should also be more focused on archaeology instead of consisting for a large part of historical data...|$|R

The thesis characterizes <b>augmented</b> reality as a specific technological-perceptual concept and establishes a system of perceptual, technological and resulting aspects that reflect important parameters of <b>augmented</b> reality.

40|$|What is <b>augmented</b> in <b>Augmented</b> Reality (AR) ? In this paper, {{we review}} {{existing}} opinions and show how little consensus exists on this matter. Subsequently, {{we approach the}} question from a theoretical and technology-independent perspective. We identify spatial and content-based relationships between the virtual and the real as being decisive for AR {{and come to the}} conclusion that virtual content <b>augments</b> that to which it relates. Subsequently, we categorize different forms of AR based on what is <b>augmented.</b> We distinguish between <b>augmented</b> environments, <b>augmented</b> objects, <b>augmented</b> humans and <b>augmented</b> content and consider the possibility of <b>augmented</b> perception. The categories are illustrated with AR (art) works and conceptual differences between them are pointed out. Moreover, we discuss what the real contributes to AR and how it can shape (future) AR experiences. A summary of our findings and suggestions for future research and practice, such as research into multimodal and crossmodal AR, conclude the paper. </p...|$|R
