5|$|Governor David Paterson's {{selection}} process {{began with a}} number of prominent names and high-ranking New York Democrats, including Andrew Cuomo, Fran Drescher and Caroline Kennedy, vying for the spot. Gillibrand quietly campaigned for the position, meeting secretly with Paterson on at least one occasion. She said that she made an effort to underscore her successful House elections in a largely conservative district, adding that she could be a good complement to Chuck Schumer. Gillibrand was presumed a likely choice {{in the days before the}} official announcement. On January 23, 2009, Paterson held <b>a</b> <b>press</b> <b>conference</b> <b>to</b> announce Gillibrand as his choice.|$|E

5|$|On 21 June 1985, the 737-200 LN-SUG Harald Gille, with 121 {{passengers}} {{en route}} from Trondheim to Oslo, was hijacked by the 24-year-old Stein Arvid Huseby. He had threatened a flight attendant with an air gun. He demanded to talk to Prime Minister Kåre Willoch and Minister of Justice Mona Røkke and <b>a</b> <b>press</b> <b>conference</b> <b>to</b> make a political statement. His demands were not met, and he surrendered while the plane was parked in Oslo. This was the first hijacking in Norway.|$|E
5|$|In December 1997, Suharto for {{the first}} time did not attend an ASEAN presidents' summit, which was later {{revealed}} to be due to a minor stroke, creating speculation about his health and the immediate future of his presidency. In mid-December, as the crisis swept through Indonesia and an estimated $150 billion of capital was being withdrawn from the country, he appeared at <b>a</b> <b>press</b> <b>conference</b> <b>to</b> re-assert his authority and to urge people to trust the government and the collapsing Rupiah. However, his attempts to re-instill confidence had little effect. Evidence suggested that his family and associates were being spared the toughest requirements of the IMF reform process, further undermining confidence in the economy and his leadership.|$|E
5|$|Two people {{disappear}} {{along the}} Appalachian Trail: {{a young man}} jogging with his girlfriend and a hermit who rarely leaves his home. Sheriff Grady Barnes (Gary Busey) finds a trail in the woods which leads him to parts of the hermit's body. That night, young Roy Satterly (Ty Wood) is reading by flashlight when a Bengal tiger briefly appears {{in front of his}} bedroom window. In the morning, his mother, Rose (Marina Stephenson Kerr), finds him sleepwalking in the woods in front of their house. A cast taken at the next victim's scene points to a tiger as the hermit's killer, so Sheriff Barnes holds <b>a</b> <b>press</b> <b>conference</b> <b>to</b> warn the public.

5|$|As {{the season}} concluded, the obvious {{standout}} draft choice for both leagues was Alabama quarterback Joe Namath. The Houston Oilers, {{in last place}} in the AFL East, had the number-one pick for the AFL. Both the Oilers and Jets realized that the Jets had a far better chance of signing Namath in competition with the NFL team which drafted him (as it turned out, the St. Louis Cardinals, formerly the Chicago Cardinals), and the Jets were able to acquire the number-one pick. Neither the Jets nor the Cardinals could sign Namath until Alabama played its {{final game of the}} season, the Orange Bowl, on January 1, 1965. Both the Jets and Cardinals negotiated with Namath's attorney, and when the price got too high for the Cardinals, the Giants secretly acquired Namath's NFL rights. Longtime Jets coach Walt Michaels admitted many years later that the Jets had signed Namath days before the game. On January 2, 1965, the Jets held <b>a</b> <b>press</b> <b>conference</b> <b>to</b> announce Namath's signing.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} {{conclusion}} of the Gator Bowl, Vick was asked by an NBC broadcaster if he intended to return to Virginia Tech for another year of collegiate football. He responded that he would discuss matters with his family and Tech head coach Frank Beamer before making a decision. That announcement sparked a fresh round of speculation from sports pundits and fans wondering if Vick would choose to return to school or enter the 2001 NFL Draft. Virginia Tech, through its football coaching staff, began an intensive lobbying campaign in an effort to convince Vick to stay. On January 11, 2001, Vick held <b>a</b> <b>press</b> <b>conference</b> <b>to</b> announce that he would be forgoing his final two years of collegiate eligibility to enter the NFL Draft. Immediately after the announcement, he was predicted to be the No. 1 pick in the draft, a hypothesis realized on April 21, when he was selected by the Atlanta Falcons, who had traded draft picks in order {{to have the right to}} select Vick.|$|E
5|$|The {{season begins}} with Rowan {{attempting}} to fix Olivia's {{personal life and}} Olivia teaming with Mellie and Fitz for <b>a</b> <b>press</b> <b>conference</b> <b>to</b> reveal the truth about her and Fitz. Olivia and Rowan disagree about the purpose of B613, which Rowan currently heads. Olivia has an emotional history with Huck. She teams with Jake and Huck to expose Operation Remington. Olivia's mother, Maya Lewis (Khandi Alexander), is introduced both in the present day and in flashbacks. Olivia comes to believe {{that her father had}} made the decision to kill her mother, which was very different than her prior beliefs about her mother's death. Believing that her father and Fitz conspired to shoot down a plane with her mother on board, Olivia becomes the client of her own firm. It is later revealed that her mother is alive and has been held prisoner by her father in a maximum security prison for 20 years for national security reasons. Lewis escapes. The midseason hiatus from mid-December to late-February left off with Olivia sending her mother abroad. However, Olivia realizes that her mother is a terrorist who married her father for his access to high level intelligence.|$|E
