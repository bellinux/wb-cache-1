50|$|A plate nut, {{also known}} as a nut plate, anchor nut or <b>anchor</b> <b>plate,</b> is a stamped sheet metal nut that is usually riveted to a workpiece. They have a long tube that is {{internally}} threaded and a plate with two clearance holes for rivets. The most popular versions have two lugs and they exist as fixed anchor nuts and as floating anchor nuts. The latter allows the nut to move slightly and so enlarges the positioning tolerances of the mounted parts. They were originally developed for the aerospace industry, but are now also common in automotive racing.These nuts are made up of variety of soft and hard materials. The choice of material depends on environment to which nut is subjected. Soft materials like copper or brass are used when nut is used in electrical application. Hard materials are used when nut is subjected to high stress environment. Sometimes stainless steel or nickel-plated nuts are used in order to increase corrosion resistance.|$|E
50|$|The first {{prototype}} for the Esquire (and the later Telecaster) {{was completed by}} Leo Fender {{in the fall of}} 1949. The prototype shared with these guitars the now-familiar slab body shape with single cutaway to allow easier access to the upper frets. It likewise featured the distinctive combination bridge and pickup assembly, with a slanted pickup with individual pole pieces for each string, and three bridge saddles which allowed adjustment of string length in pairs and individual string height. The neck, like the first Esquires manufactured in 1950, was made from a single piece of maple without a truss rod. The neck was attached to the body with four screws and an <b>anchor</b> <b>plate,</b> unlike in traditional guitar construction, where a tenon on the neck is glued into the body. Unlike the Esquire, the neck was wider at the nut, and the head had 3 tuners on each side. The prototype differed from the later production guitars in several other respects: the body was made of pinewood, it was painted opaque white, its pickguard did not extend above the strings, it lacked a selector switch, and its volume and tone knobs were mounted on a slanted plate. Like the production models, it had a removable pickup cover, but unlike the production models, the cover had straight sides. The prototype had only one pickup, as did Esquires manufactured from 1951 onwards.|$|E

The houses at No. 11 and No. 15, with their bell-shaped gables based on Dutch designs, are particularly striking. While the former is dated 1741, No. 15 was built in 1792. The Poppingas Old Bakery (Poppingas Alte Bäckerei), No. 21, from the 19th century is also found on Sielstraße and is used now as a museum, cafe and gallery; its interior has been preserved unchanged. Near the church is the so-called High House (Hohes Haus) at 1, Hohe Straße, a two-storey, sideways-on, brick building, which once served as {{the seat of the}} treasurer or Rentmeister. According to the <b>anchor</b> <b>plate</b> on the gable it dates to [...] "1696", but is thought to have already been in decline {{by the middle of the}} 16th century. Today the building, whose street façade is covered with an ashlar facing, houses a hotel. The Amtmannshaus on Neuer Deich is probably from the same period, but was extensively renovated during the 19th century. In the latest renovation the exterior appearance of the house and its associated Gulf barn was changed significantly by the addition of modern dormers. In Mühlenstraße is Haus von Halem, built in 1794 and one of the most important residential examples of neoclassical architecture in East Frisia. The two-storey brick building with a hip roof is divided by a huge pilasters. The portal has a richly carved fanlights in the late rococo style.|$|E

40|$|Background: The fixable suture <b>anchor</b> <b>plate</b> is a {{new device}} that has been {{designed}} {{with the intention of}} improving anchorage-to-bone strength during tendon-to-bone repair in patients with compromised bone quality. In this in vitro study we compare the load-to-failure and mode-of-failure results of a fixable suture <b>anchor</b> <b>plate</b> to that of other devices that are commonly used during rotator cuff repair surgery, including: a buttress plate, metal suture anchors, bioabsorbable suture anchors, and suture through simple tunnels without any augmenting device. We hypothesized that the fixable suture <b>anchor</b> <b>plate</b> would provide higher load-to-failure measurements compared to the other devices. Methods: Each device was implanted into solid rigid polyurethane foam blocks with densities representing varying degrees of osteoporosis, and then tested to failure. ANOVA and post-hoc analysis tests were used to determine statistical significance. Results: The average load to failure for the fixable suture <b>anchor</b> <b>plate</b> was significantly greater in low and medium density blocks compared to the other devices tested (p≤ 0. 01). The greatest difference in magnitude was seen in low density blocks (5 pcf), where the fixable suture <b>anchor</b> <b>plate</b> failed at 278 ± 53 N (mean ± standard deviation), about double the value of the next highest failure at 133 ± 11 N for the buttress plate. Conclusions: The fixable suture <b>anchor</b> <b>plate</b> demonstrated superior anchorage strength in low and medium density foam blocks compared to the other devices that were tested in this study. Further studies are needed to determine whether clinical use of a fixable suture <b>anchor</b> <b>plate</b> will translate into a higher rotator-cuff-repair success rate in vivo...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an innovative soil anchor in loose and dense sand. Many {{studies on the}} <b>anchor</b> <b>plates,</b> both theoretical and experimental, have been conducted, although the existing works were mainly performed on regular and symmetrical <b>anchor</b> <b>plates.</b> A new <b>anchor</b> system is an irregular and non-symmetry shape anchor. This is an innovative system due to the special shape and the penetration into soils. Two sizes of irregular-shaped anchors, 159 and 297 mm, were used. The non-symmetry anchor employed in the system contributes to its good performance and high pullout load capacity. The maximum resistance increased based on the embedment ratio and {{the density of the}} sand. An important innovation of this system is the installation method, where it does not require excavation and grouting. The main objective of this research is to validate the break-out factors and the ultimate uplift capacity load of the irregular-shaped anchor with the existing researches related to <b>anchor</b> <b>plates.</b> The experimental research was performed on the models in a chamber box. For the 159 mm-width irregular-shaped anchor, an embedment ratio L/D between 1 and 7 and for the 297 mm-width embedment ratio L/D between 1 and 4 were employed. The irregular-shaped anchors were used in dry, loose and dense sand. The new irregular-shaped anchors are compatible with the symmetrical <b>anchor</b> <b>plates</b> as determined by existing researchers...|$|R

40|$|Near to its {{official}} publication, Eurocode 2 part 4 (EN 1992 - 4) {{does not account}} for design of <b>anchor</b> <b>plates</b> under seismic action. <b>Anchor</b> <b>plates,</b> with cast in place fasteners, are commonly used in nuclear power plants to connect equipment to reinforced concrete structures. Such solutions provide a flat surface where the support of equipment may be welded, furthermore cast in place fasteners require no drilling holes thus avoiding additional sealing operations. Classic <b>anchor</b> <b>plates</b> typically use at least four fasteners, thus complicating the installation when high density of reinforcement is expected. New specific solutions with only one headed anchor are investigated in this paper: a more classic solution made with a single stud welded in the centre of the steel plate, and a more innovative one made with a piece of an IPE profile, welded in the centre of the steel plate. An experimental campaign was carried out by adapting existing European protocols for the assessment of post-installed anchors under seismic action. Static tests, pulsating tension load tests and tests with constant tension load and varying crack width were carried out in unconfined condition and in cracked concrete under different load conditions. Capacity reduction after cyclic tests is evaluated and compared with Concrete Capacity Design method (CCD) to prove its applicability as design method to these innovative solutions...|$|R
40|$|Cold-formed steel <b>anchor</b> <b>plate</b> {{is widely}} used in the local {{construction}} industry especially in lightweight roof truss system. It is used to connect a truss to its support, transferring load. Sometimes these anchor plates are used to level a truss without a wall plate. The truss then, depended on the anchor plates to carry them in place until grouting is done. The clearance between the support and a truss can go up to a 100 mm high. As with other thin-walled structures, stability is a critical design issue here. This paper examines the effect of plate thickness and load profiles on the plate performance. A total of 18 tests were conducted to determine the ultimate capacity of the <b>anchor</b> <b>plate.</b> The load {{measured from the experiment}} was used to determine the eccentricity of the system through Parametric Column Analysis.

40|$|The {{behaviour}} of tie rod {{anchor plates}} is at present not well established, and the criteria suggested {{do not seem}} to have consistent theoretical basis. This paper suggests a theoretical approach to determine the load-carrying capacity of stiff anchor plates acting on a masonry wall. According to this approach the punching strength is the lower of two values. The first value follows from the hypothesis that collapse occurs because of the slippage of the units on the mortar bed, whereas the second comes from the alternative hypothesis that punching creates a solid consisting of a truncated cone in which the outer face is the surface of the <b>anchor</b> <b>plate</b> (units break whereas the mortar does not crumble). When doing so it is supposed that the <b>anchor</b> <b>plate</b> is so stiff that pressure it applies on the masonry wall is almost constant.

40|$|The uplift {{response}} of symmetrical anchor plates {{with and without}} geogrid reinforcement layers has been evaluated in model tests and numerical simulations using PLAXIS. Many parameters of the reinforcement layers were used to reinforce the sandy soil over circular, square, and rectangular symmetrical anchor plates of various sizes. In the current research, different parameters, such as relative density of sand and embedment ratios, in conjunction with geogrid reinforcement layer parameters including size, number of layers, and {{the proximity of the}} layer to the circular <b>anchor</b> <b>plate,</b> were investigated in a scale model. The failure mechanism and the associated rupture surface were observed and evaluated. Test results showed that using geogrid reinforcement layers significantly improves the uplift capacity of symmetrical anchor plates. It was found that inclusion of one geogrid layer resting directly on top of the symmetrical <b>anchor</b> <b>plate</b> was more effective in enhancing the symmetrical anchor capacity than the layer itself. It was also found that the inclusion of one geogrid layer on the symmetrical <b>anchor</b> <b>plate</b> improved the uplift capacity more than the same symmetrical <b>anchor</b> <b>plate</b> embedded without a reinforcement layer. The single geogrid layer was also more effective in enhancing the uplift capacity compared to the multiple geogrid layer reinforcement approach. In general, the results show that the uplift capacity of symmetrical anchor plates in loose and dense sand can be significantly increased by the inclusion of geogrid layers. It was also observed that the inclusion of geogrid layers reduces the requirement for a higher L/D ratio to achieve the required uplift capacity. The results of the laboratory and numerical analysis are found to be in agreement in terms of the breakout factor and failure mechanism pattern...|$|E

40|$|The {{vertical}} pullout {{capacity of}} strip and circular plate anchors embedded horizontally in a layered sandy medium was computed {{by using the}} plane strain and axisymmetric lower-bound limit analyses in combination with finite elements and linear optimization. The soil medium below the <b>anchor</b> <b>plate</b> {{was assumed to be}} comprised of loose sand. Two different sand layers were considered above the anchor with different combinations of their internal friction angles. For several embedment ratios (H/B), the variations of the pullout factors F-gamma and F-q due to the components of soil unit weight and surcharge, respectively, were computed as a function of H-dense/H for different cases; here, H and H-dense imply (1) the depth of the <b>anchor</b> <b>plate</b> from ground surface and (2) the thickness of the dense sand layer, respectively. The pullout resistance increased continuously with an increase in H-dense/H. For a given H/B, with the same value of H-dense/H, the uplift resistance became greater for a case when the dense sand layer was kept just above the plate rather than placing it close to ground surface. Compared with strip anchors, the uplift factors became considerably greater for circular anchors. The effect of the variation of the unit weights of the two layers above the <b>anchor</b> <b>plate</b> on its pullout resistance was also explored.
