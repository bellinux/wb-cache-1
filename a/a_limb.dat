In certain situations, anticonvulsants {{may be used}} to try to prevent seizures. These situations include focal neurological problems (e.g. inability to move <b>a</b> <b>limb)</b> and focal changes of the brain tissue on CT or MRI scan. Evidence to support or refute the use of antiepileptic drugs as a preventive measure, however, is lacking.|$|E
5|$|Later, between 2009 and 2011, {{another team}} of astronomers {{observed}} WASP-13b and WASP-21b {{to find what}} caused some Hot Jupiters to have anomalously high radii. The RISE photometric camera on the Liverpool Telescope was used to detect further transits. Two partial transits and two full transits were observed during this period, although the quality of both full transits was slightly compromised because of passing cloud cover. The collected observations, along with the JGT observations {{that were used to}} confirm the planet, were scaled to filter out errors such as background noise. The data was then used to re-define WASP-13b's parameters, including its age, mass, radius, and density. The study also noted that <b>a</b> <b>limb</b> darkening effect was present, a characteristic that may affect future atmospheric studies of the planet.|$|E

5|$|The {{system worked}} as follows. The animal's sense organ is altered when it detects an object. This causes a perceptual {{change in the}} animal's seat of sensation, which Aristotle {{believed}} was the heart, not as we now think the brain. This in turn causes {{a change in the}} heart's heat, which causes a quantitative change sufficient to make the heart transmit a mechanical impulse to <b>a</b> <b>limb,</b> which moves, moving the animal's body. The alteration {{in the heat of the}} heart also causes a change in the consistency of the joints, which helps the limb to move.|$|E
5|$|Dinheirosaurus {{material}} included vertebrae, ribs, partial pelvis, and gastroliths. The vertebrae {{were certainly}} from the cervical and dorsal regions, and are articulated. The two cervicals are not greatly preserved, although the twelve dorsals are articulated {{and in good}} condition. Other vertebral material includes seven centra that are fragmentary and a few neural arches, which are unattached. 12 dorsal ribs are preserved, {{as well as some}} appendicular elements. David Weishampel et al. did not recognize all the material as belonging to Dinheirosaurus, and only found 9 dorsals in the holotype, while also misinterpreting the pubis as <b>a</b> <b>limb</b> fragment. They also incorrectly stated that it was found in the Camadas de Alcobaça Formation. Another pair of vertebrae, under collection number ML 418, was originally assigned to Dinheirosaurus by Bonaparte and Mateus, but is now considered to be a distinct new unnamed genus of diplodocid.|$|E
5|$|Emus {{were used}} {{as a source of}} food by {{indigenous}} Australians and early European settlers. Emus are inquisitive birds and have been known to approach humans if they see unexpected movement of <b>a</b> <b>limb</b> or piece of clothing. In the wild, they may follow and observe people. Aboriginal Australians used a variety of techniques to catch the birds, including spearing them while they drank at waterholes, catching them in nets, and attracting them by imitating their calls or by arousing their curiosity with a ball of feathers and rags dangled from a tree. The pitchuri thornapple (Duboisia hopwoodii), or some similar poisonous plant, could be used to contaminate a waterhole, after which the disoriented emus were easy to catch. Another stratagem was for the hunter to use a skin as a disguise, and the birds could be lured into a camouflaged pit trap using rags or imitation calls. Aboriginal Australians only killed emus out of necessity, and frowned on anyone who hunted them for any other reason. Every part of the carcass had some use; the fat was harvested for its valuable, multiple-use oil, the bones were shaped into knives and tools, the feathers were used for body adornment and the tendons substituted for string.|$|E
50|$|AER timing {{does not}} {{regulate}} the fate specification {{of the underlying}} mesoderm, as shown by one set of experiments. When the AER from <b>a</b> late <b>limb</b> bud is transplanted to <b>an</b> earlier <b>limb</b> bud, the limb forms normally. The converse - transplantation of <b>an</b> early <b>limb</b> bud to <b>a</b> late <b>limb</b> bud - also results in normal limb development. However, the underlying mesoderm in the progress zone is fate specified. If progress zone mesoderm is transplanted along with the AER, then additional finger/toes are formed (for an early → late transplantation) or the finger/toes are formed too early (for a late → early transplantation).|$|R

5|$|Ripley's {{performance}} in the first series won her a nomination for Best TV Comedy Actress at the British Comedy Awards 1999. For her {{performance in}} the third series (2000), in which her character separates from her husband and dates another man (played by Ben Miles), she was nominated for the British Academy Television Award for Best Actress. During pre-production of the fourth series (2001), Ripley announced to the producers {{that she would be}} leaving the show, partly because {{she did not want to}} spend five months living in Manchester away from her home in London and wanted to spend more time with her husband, and partly to take other roles which she would otherwise not be able to do. She asked the writer Mike Bullen to either kill off Jenny or have her lose <b>a</b> <b>limb.</b> Bullen refused and instead wrote a plot in which Jenny moves to New York. Ripley returned to the series for a guest appearance in the final episode (2003). She had originally planned not to return to the show, but reprised the role so she could have an on-screen record of the final stages of her pregnancy with her first child.|$|E
5|$|This {{is a list}} of notable {{people who}} have survived the {{infectious}} disease poliomyelitis. Poliomyelitis (often simply called polio) is an acute viral infection that involves the gastrointestinal tract and occasionally the central nervous system. Poliovirus is acquired by faecal-oral or oral transmission. Prior to the introduction of a vaccine in 1955, infection was common, with epidemics during the summer and autumn of temperate countries. An eradication programme has reduced the number of reported polio cases worldwide by more than 99% since the mid-1980s. Most infections are asymptomatic; a small number cause a minor illness that is indistinguishable from many other viral illnesses; less than 1% result in acute flaccid paralysis. The extent of paralysis varies from part of <b>a</b> <b>limb</b> to quadriplegia and respiratory failure. The latter was often treated with an iron lung until, it was hoped, the patient recovered. Around 30–40 years after contracting paralytic poliomyelitis, about 25–40% of cases lead to post-polio syndrome. Symptoms include muscle pain, further weakening of muscles and paralysis.|$|E
5|$|MacLachlan {{reported}} to No. 1 Depot, RAF Uxbridge {{and two days}} later attended No. 2 Central Medical Board on 13 August. He was certified fit to fly and flew Supermarine Spitfire on 21 August. He moved to Bournemouth to see his brother Gordon who was now a pilot officer in No. 501 Squadron RAF. At Queen Mary's Hospital he was fitted with a new arm. MacLachlan explained to the doctors that he required an arm {{that would allow him}} to fly a Hurricane. They designed <b>a</b> <b>limb</b> that allowed him to operate the throttle while taking the control column and firing button with his right hand. They spent hours studying the cockpit layout. The medical staff produced an arm with four spring-loaded pins, like fingers, which enabled him to use the controls on the port side of the cockpit. They secured his left arm to the levers of the throttle quadrant: throttle, propeller pitch control, supercharger and mixture control. The landing gear controls were located on the right side. The artificial arm had to interact with the control column while the gear was being retracted or lowered. His new arm proved sufficient and in September 1941 he flew as many hours in Hurricanes as possible, though not without incident. On 7 September 1941 he force-landed in darkness during a searchlight co-operation exercise. On 28 September 1941 he nearly collided with a Bristol Blenheim in low-cloud. Nevertheless, he was cleared for operational flying on 15 October.|$|E

5|$|Meat ants {{are among}} the very few native species of Australia that are not harmed by the toxins of the cane toad, an {{invasive}} species. Most of the time, foraging workers target metamorph toads. Observations show that workers would forage around ponds and seize any toadlet. This normally starts with a single worker making contact with an individual and tracing its movements, followed by three or four workers capturing it. All the participating ants would grab <b>a</b> <b>limb</b> and sever the legs, returning the prey item back to their nest. Most of the time these tactics do not work. For example, most toadlets are able to escape the ants by displaying aversion-like behaviour; an individual may escape by struggling erratically or forcing the ants to release their grip by returning to the water. This aversion behaviour leads to most toadlets remaining in the water or staying on objects such as water lilies, pieces of bark that the ants cannot access, or moving around on moist substrates. It is unknown if meat ant predation on the toadlets affected the population, but based on the population density of the toadlets within the studied site and the foraging time and efficiency, approximately 2,700 toadlets could be removed per day. As the toadlet population density is extremely high, the impact of meat ant predation is minor. However, the survivability of the toadlets may be affected if the ants prevent the toadlets from foraging into many areas of moist substrate.|$|E
