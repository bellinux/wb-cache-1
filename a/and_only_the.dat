He and Yardley played carefully until the tea break, <b>and</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> England captain offered a chance; Barnes was unable to complete the reflex catch at short leg from the bowling of Toshack. After the resumption of play, Yardley on-drove Lindwall for a four, but lofted Ernie Toshack, who had been bowling leg theory, into the packed on-side where he was caught by Johnson at forward square leg. Toshack's defensive bowling had caused the English skipper to lose patience and his departure for 22 left the score on 141/6.|$|E
5|$|After facing {{criticism}} {{for a lack}} of production in the first two weeks, Smith turned in a record-setting performance against the St. Louis Rams in Week 3. In the first quarter, he scored on each of his first three career receptions with 74-, 41-, and 18-yard touchdowns. The 74-yard score was the longest completion of quarterback Joe Flacco's career. He became the first NFL rookie, <b>and</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> twelfth player, to amass three touchdown receptions in a single quarter. Smith finished the game with five receptions for 152yards in the 37–7 victory. It remains a Ravens rookie record, as does Smith's 30.4 yards per catch that day.|$|E

The spacecraft was also bigger; it had two main parts, the combined command and service module (CSM) and the lunar landing module (LM).

The 2/2nd Field Regiment was still equipped with twelve 18-pounders and twelve 4.5-inchhowitzers. Only A Squadron of the 2/6th Cavalry Regiment was on hand, {{as the rest of}} the regiment was deployed in the defence of the frontier posts at Al-Jaghbub and Siwa Oasis. The 2/1st Machine Gun Battalion had been diverted to Britain. Its place was taken by a British Army machine-gun battalion, the 1st Northumberland Fusiliers. The 2/1st Antitank Regiment had likewise been diverted, so each infantry brigade had formed an antitank company but 2-pounders were in short supply, and only eleven guns were available instead of the 27 required. The infantry battalions were particularly short of mortars, and ammunition for the Boys anti-tank rifle was in short supply.|$|E

5|$|Cambridge Castle, locally {{also known}} as Castle Mound, is located in Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, England. Originally built after the Norman conquest to control the {{strategically}} important route {{to the north of}} England, it {{played a role in the}} conflicts of the Anarchy, the First and Second Barons' Wars. Hugely expanded by Edward I, the castle then fell rapidly into disuse in the late medieval era, its stonework recycled for building purposes in the surrounding colleges. Cambridge Castle was refortified during the English Civil War but once again fell into disuse, used primarily as the county gaol. The castle gaol was finally demolished in 1842, with a new prison built in the castle bailey. This prison was demolished in 1932, replaced with the modern Shire Hall, <b>and</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> castle motte and limited earthworks still stand. The site is open to the public daily and offers views over the historic buildings of the city.|$|E

In 1978, Chapman co-wrote the comedy film The Odd Job with McKenna, and starred as one of the main characters. Chapman wanted his friend Keith Moon to play a co-lead role alongside him, but Moon could not pass an acting test, so the part went to David Jason who had previously appeared on Do Not Adjust Your Set with Pythons Idle, Jones, and Palin.

As he had with his earlier buildings, Holden also prepared the designs for the individual elements of the interior design. From its completion until 1957, it was the tallest office building in London.|$|E
