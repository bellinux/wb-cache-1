40|$|This {{paper is}} about a process and {{practice}} which is bringing representatives of tribal communities in three Indian states together with district, state and national government officials, around the issue of <b>aquaculture</b> <b>services</b> provision. The project comprises a year-long series of visits, fieldwork, workshops, case studies, a consensus-building process, literature research, reviews and documentation. Among its aims are building shared understandings of government services provision among recipients, implementers and policy-makers, and facilitating an equitable dialogue towards policy change. Consideration is given to how three of STREAM’s guiding principles – being people-focused, participatory and practical – are being transformed from concepts into practice. This is being done by applying STREAM’s emerging “process monitoring and significant change ” system. Insights are being gained into:! the practicalities of people’s actual participation in influencing policy change! the interplay of people’s opportunities and choices to improve their livelihoods! how different people’s expectations of each other, and how they work together, can change through mediated experiences! {{what it means to}} work with diversity and the realities of being tolerant, and! rights-based approaches to development work...|$|E
40|$|This report {{includes}} {{an analysis of}} the raw economic value of the ocean, and foreshadows the losses we will incur if we continue on our current destructive trajectory. We believe the figures are a vast underestimate, and the economic assets at risk in the ocean are even more substantial than those presented here. The annual "gross marine product" (GMP)  equivalent to a country's annual gross domestic product  is at least US$ 2. 5 trillion; the total "asset" base of the ocean is at least US$ 24 trillion. Underpinning this value are direct outputs (fishing, <b>aquaculture),</b> <b>services</b> enabled (tourism, education), trade and transportation (coastal and oceanic shipping) and adjacent benefits (carbon sequestration, biotechnology). Putting it into an international context, if the ocean were a country it would have the seventh largest economy in the world. Outputs that are not generated by the ocean per se, such as those from offshore oil and gas or wind energy, were excluded from these estimates, as were assets for which data is not yet available. The analysis did not include valuable intangibles such as the ocean's role in climate regulation, the production of oxygen, temperature stabilization of our planet, or the spiritual and cultural services the ocean provides. The fact that these additional values are not included in his analysis means that the actual value of the ocean is much higher...|$|E

40|$|If Asia, {{aquaculture}} {{has been}} primarily oriented towards meeting local food requirements, creating gainful employment opportunities and supplementing family income. As a result, {{the majority of}} the sectoral contributors are small farmers. Inputs from research institutions and intra-regional exchange of information have accelerated the pace of development of Asian aquaculture. Large-scale commercialisation of aquaculture activities is a recent development in Asia that has been influenced by the price structure and increasing demand for high-value aquaculture products, especially shrimp. Governments in the region have also given high priority to the development of aquaculture because this sector is a major source of foreign exchange earnings through export of high-value products like shrimp. <b>Aquaculture</b> extension <b>services</b> are recognised as the vital link between researchers and primary producers. The governments of countries within the region have worked diligently to expand and improve the network of field staff available to assist the aquaculture industries.

40|$|Ponds {{built in}} areas that have acid soils and soft water may not always perform well for fish production. Such ponds may benefit from liming if the water has a total {{alkalinity}} of less than 20 mg/ 1 (20 ppm). If alkalinity is more than 20 mg/ 1, liming may not be beneficial. Alkalinity measures the buffering capacity {{of the water and}} is usually a good indicator of productivity. Carbonates, bicarbonates, hydroxides, phosphates, and organic substances are the main components of water alkalinity. Water hardness is caused by calcium, magnesium, iron, and aluminum salts, most often in the form of carbonates, sulfates, or chlorides. Ponds that have water hardness concentrations of less than 20 mg/ 1 may also benefit from liming.

40|$|Due to arising {{needs and}} demands, {{aquaculture}} {{is currently the}} fastest growing food production sector. In order to increase yield and yet to remain sustainable, the challenges would be to minimise {{impact on the environment}} and ecosystem <b>services.</b> <b>Aquaculture</b> activity contributes significantly to Malaysia and also the state of Sabah’s economy and food security. Hence, the future changes in the environment as a result of rapid population growth and development would pose as threats to this industry in terms of quality, quantity and sustainability. Unforeseen environmental changes such as environmental pollution from other sources, climate change and the changes in policies would jeopardize the sustainability of this industry. In order to anticipate such impacts to the aquaculture activities, this paper set to chart a sustainable course for its development. Four important research courses were proposed: establishment of a sustainable framework, assessment of impacts of climate change, viability and vulnerability assessment due to future environmental changes and food security. Such findings would eventually allow the stakeholders to plan and manage the resources and aquaculture activities {{in such a way that}} foster sustainable food security and resilient aquatic ecosystems...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The study {{analyzed}} the socio-economic, poverty and gender issues within Aquaculture in Philippines. The dependency of household income from Aquaculture on different socio-economic, institutional and market factors was tested. This {{was accomplished by}} a questionnaire survey of 285 farms spread across five villages (barangays) in two regions, namely Region III and Region IVA in Philippines dominated by different systems of Aquaculture. Results show that income from Aquaculture represents the only source or {{the main source of}} income for 63 % of the respondents. Several factors significantly influence the household’s income from Aquaculture including skills/training, type of management and institutional options. It is important to know why households involve themselves in Aquaculture, especially the poor households who depend on such income for gap-filling (supplementary income) or safety net function (to meet unexpected household needs). Overall, Aquaculture is providing new employment opportunities for poor, women and youth, despite constraints that include inadequate access to credit, lack of skills and licenses to fish farms. In the Philippines, several policies exist in support of the poor, but require political will for implementation. Aquaculture development programmes should be integrated with other sectors, prioritize the poor households whose only or main source of income is <b>Aquaculture,</b> bring necessary <b>services</b> closer to the vulnerable groups, make communication and knowledge dissemination more effective and user friendly, and encourage active participation of communities and fishers organizations in planning and implementation...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that {{scientific}} and political consideration for ecosystem services has dramatically increased over the past decade, few {{studies have focused on}} marine and coastal ecosystem services for conservation strategies. We used an ecosystem services approach to assess spatial distributions of habitat risks and four ecosystem services (coastal protection, carbon storage, recreation, and aesthetic quality), and explored the tradeoffs among them in coastal areas of South Korea. Additionally, we analyzed how the social and ecological characteristics in coastal areas interact with conservation and development policies by using this approach. We found strong negative associations between the habitat risks and ecosystem <b>services</b> (<b>aquaculture,</b> carbon storage, recreation, and aesthetic quality) across the coastal counties. Our results showed that the intensity of the habitat risks and the provision of ecosystem services were significantly different between reclamation-dominated and conservation-dominated counties, except for coastal vulnerability. A generalized linear model suggested that reclamation projects were dependent on economic efficiency, whereas demographic pressures and habitat conditions influenced the designation of protected areas at a county level. The ecosystem services approach provided guidelines to achieve both sustainable development and environment conservation. By using the approach, we can select the priority areas for developments while we can minimize the degradation of biodiversity and ecosystem services. As cultural ecosystem services are evenly distributed throughout coastal areas of South Korea, decision makers may employ them to improve the conditions of coastal wetlands outside of protected areas...|$|R

Seafood is Canada's single largest exported food commodity, exporting 85% of production, making Canada the seventh largest seafood exporter in the world. In 1986, Canadian aquaculture production amounted to only 10,488 tonnes, valued at $35 million, and then in 2009 it had a value of 800 million dollars, 69% of which was exported. British Columbia is the fourth largest producer of salmon in the world and is Canada’s leader in aquaculture production with 52.3% of total production value, followed by New Brunswick with 20.7% in 2009. The main species of fish farmed in Canada is led by salmon with 70.5% of all fish in aquaculture followed by mussels with 15.1%. Aquaculture makes a significant contribution to Canada’s economy totaling 2.1 billion dollars in revenue and jobs in Canada in 2009. The total gross domestic product of farmed fish in Canada totaled $1,005,180,000 dollars in 2009 and $14,495,000 dollars in total employment in Canada. [...] the value accumulated from aquaculture solely for employment is exceptionally important for the members employed in this industry. Over 90% of all jobs (both direct and indirect) are located in rural, coastal, and Aboriginal communities where the human population is low and employment opportunities are scarce.

40|$|Ecosystem {{services}} provided by the marine environment are fundamental to human health and well-being. Despite this, many marine systems are being degraded to an extent that may reduce their capacity to provide these ecosystem services. The ecosystem approach is a strategy for the integrated management of land, water and living resources that promotes conservation and sustainable use in an equitable way (UN Convention on Biological Diversity, 2000). Its application to marine management and spatial planning has been proposed {{as a means of}} maintaining the economic and social value of the oceans, not only in the present but for generations to come. Characterising the susceptibility of services (and combinations of services) to particular human activities based on knowledge of impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (as described in preceding chapters) is a challenge for future management of the oceans. In this chapter, we highlight the existing, but limited knowledge of how ecosystem services may be impacted by different human activities. We discuss how impacts on one service can impact multiple services and explore how the impacts on services can vary both spatially and temporally and according to context. We focus particularly on the effects on ecosystem services of activities whose impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning have already been considered in previous chapters. Some of these activities are associated with poor management of ecosystem benefits, for example, from provisioning <b>services</b> (<b>aquaculture</b> and fisheries), or with excessive input of wastes, fertilisers and contaminants into the system overburdening the waste treatment and assimilation services. Other impacts are associated with the construction of structures or use of space designed to generate benefits from environmental services such as the presence of water as a carrier for shipping, or sources of wind, wave and tidal power. We discuss the trade-offs that are made, consciously or otherwise, between different ecosystem services, which arise from human activities to optimise or manage specific ecosystem services...|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the Holocene formation and evolution of the coastal system of Thermaikos Gulf (NW Aegean Sea). The system is divided into the terrestrial sub-system and the oceanic sub-system; the former represents 90 %, while the latter includes only 10 % of the total area. This particular coastal zone includes the second most important socio-economic area of Greece and in the southern Balkans, the Thessaloniki region; this is in terms of population concentration (> 1 million people), industry, agriculture, <b>aquaculture,</b> trade and <b>services.</b> The geomorphology of the coastal zone is controlled by sediment inputs, nearshore water circulation, and the level of wave activity. The large quantities of sediments (with yields > 500 tonnes/km 2 per year), delivered annually by the main rivers (Axios, Aliakmon, Pinios, and Gallikos) and other seasonal streams are responsible for the general progradation of the coastline and the formation of the Holocene sedimentary cover over the seabed of the Gulf. Changes to the coastline can be identified on macro- and meso-time scales; the former include the evolution of the deltaic plains (at > 1 km 2 /year), while the latter incorporates seasonal changes along sections of the coastline (e. g. sandy spits), mostly due to the anthropogenic activities. The overall water circulation pattern in Thermaikos Gulf is characterised by northerly water movement, from the central and eastern part of the Gulf; this is compensated by southerly movement along its western part. The prevailing climate (winds and pressure systems) appears to control the surface water circulation, while near-bed current measurements reveal a general moderate (< 15 cm/s) southerly flow, i. e. offshore, towards the deep water Sporades Basin. Waves approaching from southerly directions play also a role in controlling the shoreline configuration. Various human activities within the coastal system place considerable pressure on the natural evolution of the coastal zone ecosystem. Thus, the construction of dams along the routes of the main rivers has reduced dramatically the water/sediment fluxes; this caused, for example, retreat of the deltaic coastlines and seawater intrusion into the groundwater aquifers. Similarly, pollution and/or eutrophication of the nearshore marine environment have resulted from the inputs of industrial wastes, urban untreated sewage, and agricultural activities on the coastal plains. This effect is demonstrated by high levels of pollutants, nutrients, and by the increased concentrations of non-residual trace-metals within the surficial sediments. Finally, climatic changes associated with a potential rise in sea level (i. e. 30 – 50 cm) will threaten a substantial part of the low-lying lands of Thermaikos Gulf. Thus, systematic and thorough monitoring is needed {{in order to protect the}} coastal ecosystem; this will ensure its sustainable development and successful management, in relation to present and future socio-economic activities and climatic changes...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{investigate}} if {{the application of the}} ecosystem services concept can provide decision makers and stakeholders with additional relevant information for decisions regarding establishing of aquaculture on a local level, using the Lake Storsjön as a case study. In order to provide this knowledge, three different tasks are carried out within this thesis: the identification of the main ecosystem services provided by Lake Storsjön, the understanding of ecosystem services that will be affected by the expansion of aquaculture and the identification of the services that will be used for a possible expansion of the aquaculture sector. The CICES methodology (Common International Classification of Ecosystem Services) is used to identify the ecosystem services provided by Lake Storsjön. The understanding of the affected ecosystem services is carried out {{with the use of a}} Delphi-inspired approach. The identification of the services required for the establishment of aquaculture is driven by a cross-reference matrix. Lake Storsjön provides thirty-nine out of the fifty-nine ecosystem services included in the CICES. About half of these will be effected by environmental impacts connected to operations of ecosystem management required by aquaculture expansion, mostly with a low or medium degree of impact. An increase in the implementation of aquaculture might cause detrimental trade-offs with these ecosystem services: “Wild animals”, “Genetic materials from all biota“, “Disease control”, “Maintaining nursery populations and habitats” and “Filtration/dilution/sequestration/storage/accumulation by ecosystem”. An expansion of the aquaculture sector requires seven of the ecosystem services provided by Lake Storsjön. The vital services for this process are: “Surface water for non-drinking purposes”, “Filtration/dilution/sequestration/storage/accumulation by ecosystem” and “Chemical condition of freshwater”. These services have to be safeguarded and maintained in order to guarantee adequate conditions for an expansion of this sector. At the same time the expansion of <b>aquaculture</b> supports the <b>service</b> “Animals from in situ aquaculture”. The benefits connected to the implementation of aquaculture shall be economically assessed and compared to the actual economic value delivered by the other ecosystem services in order to further understand the positives and negatives outcomes of aquaculture expansion in an ecosystem services perspective. This is considered to be a relevant step for strategic and decision making processes concerning aquaculture expansion in Lake Storsjön. In addition to the economic perspective, it seems that the most relevant factor when discussing planning and development processes towards ecosystem services is the importance of not overshooting the resilience ability of the ecosystem in order to ensure the accessibility of the services to future generations. This belief is recommended to be applied to Lake Storsjön in order to guarantee a conscious expansion of the aquaculture sector on a social, economic and environmental level...|$|R

Likewise, the average engine capacity per boat increased from 19. 8 HP in 1980 to 26. 2 HP in 1998. The types of fishing gear that provide substantive catch in Vietnam are the trawl, purse seine, gillnet, long line, hand line, lift net and stick-held falling net. The fishing grounds in Vietnam can be classified into: (a) North: trawl, gillnet, lift net, purse seine, hook and line fishery; (b) Central: purse seine, lift net, gillnet, trawl fishery; and (c) South: trawl, purse seine, gillnet and line fishery. In terms of fish catch and net profit contribution the most important are the trawl and purse seine fisheries. Fish {{production in}} the Southern provinces is more developed compared to the northern and central provinces. Most of the commercial scale fishing vessels bring trash fish or by-catch to the shore for fish sauce or fish powder processing. Only trawlers that fish offshore and thus stay at sea for several days discard the trash fish. An attempt to estimate the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) of the coastal fishery resources in Vietnam was made. Using the Schaefer and Fox Models, it was found that MSY is equal to 976 378 t and 1 006 850 t respectively, as against the annual catch of 1 130 660 t, implying biological over-fishing. Thus, the total fish catch in the traditional fishing areas of Vietnam is beyond the sustainable limit of 582 000 t. The Government of Vietnam has therefore developed policies and plans to reduce the fishing pressure on the coastal waters and pursue development of offshore fisheries.

Some previous work on maritime fleet renewal problems (MFRP) have been reviewed, and a two-stage stochastic programming model for the MFRP in the aquaculture sector has been presented. The model aims to minimize the total cost incurring when acquiring and operating a fleet of vessels. The demand is assumed to be known for the first set of time periods, while the demand in the second stage is illustrated by a set of scenarios. Vessels can be bought and sold in all time steps in both the first and second stage of the model. The first stage makes sure that the here and now decisions are equal for each scenario, and the scenarios are included to make the here and now decisions more robust with respect to future uncertainty. All routing decisions have been taken out of the optimization model and moved to a separate loop generator to ensure a simpler structure of the optimization model, and to ensure flexibility in the modelling approach. The optimization model has been implemented in the commercial solver XPRESS IVE and the loop generation is done in MATLAB. To test the model`s performance, a test case with eight time steps and four scenarios was solved and the value of the stochastic solution was found. The case study finds that the model choses a fleet composition which seems reasonable, and that the solver can solve the problem within an acceptable amount of time. The test instance shows a low value for the stochastic solution, indicating that for the particular case a deterministic model could be just as effective. However, the stochastic solution gave a more flexible solution, as the deterministic approach found no feasible solution for one of the scenarios. The model presented in this study provides a good basis for further development of maitime fleet renewal models in the aquaculture sector, and {{can be seen as a}} flexible modelling platform which can easily be altered to include new tasks, new vessels or new acquisition and disposal methods for vessels in the fleet. This modelling platform could be applied by salmon producers wanting to reduce the cost of servicing the demand of their farming locations. Then the model could be used to include all their current and planned locations. Furthermore, the model could be of interest to a ship owning company with a long-term contract with a salmon producer or who just wants to evaluate how the future demand for vessels might be, to be able to buy the right vessels at the right time...|$|R
40|$|Wild kelp forests {{represent}} one of {{the most}} productive habitats on Earth, suppling ecosystem services, including, but not limited to, biodiversity, habitat provision, food web subsidy, nutrient cycling, carbon sequestration and coastal defence. Ecosystem services associated with wild kelps have been examined by researchers for more than six decades. Currently, with the development and growth of seaweed <b>aquaculture</b> the ecosystem <b>services</b> and potential impacts associated with cultivated kelps need to be assessed. World aquaculture production continues to grow year on year with approximately 131. 4 million tonnes of fish, aquatic animals and aquatic plants produced in 2014. The cultivation of aquatic plants, predominantly marine species of seaweeds, accounts for over 20 % of this total production (by weight) which too has seen rapid growth of almost 8 % per year over the past decade. Seaweed cultivation is traditionally dominated by Asian countries, however, over the last 15 years the industry has also expanded in Europe. This interest has been supported by feasibility studies and pilot-scale farms being set up to begin to develop the industry and advance cultivation techniques of kelps native to European waters. Observations of seaweed farms suggest that both the growing kelp and its associated infrastructure could provide ecosystem services, in particular, habitat for associated species altering the ecosystem structure and functioning of the surrounding area. Additionally, carbon from the highly productive kelps released as detritus could be assimilated by other species and incorporated into the food web. This primary productivity may also negatively impact the benthic environment beneath the farm causing increased organic enrichment of the seabed. Little research has been conducted into the communities associated with cultivated kelps. The habitat created by farmed kelps may act as a novel habitat and not simply an expansion of the existing habitat created by wild kelps, due to differences in kelp morphology, age and position within the water column. A comparative study between wild (benthic) and cultivated (suspended) holdfasts communities of Laminaria digitata at an experimental research site on the west coast of Ireland, demonstrated that cultivated kelps provide a distinct habitat for species compared to their wild counterparts. Subsequently, an extensive investigation of the communities associated with cultivated kelp (Alaria esculenta) was conducted at a commercial-scale seaweed farm in Ventry Harbour, Co. Kerry v (southwest coast of Ireland). These studies assessed the properties of the whole farms and the individual parts (frond and holdfast) of the kelp sporophyte as a habitat for communities. Kelps are a major source of primary productivity and using stable isotope analysis it was found that cultivated kelps (A. esculenta and Saccharina latissima) are incorporated into the food web via the suspension-feeding mollusc Mytilus edulis. Additionally, a multivariate analysis of the Ecological Status of benthic communities suggested no negative impacts from the deposition of kelp detritus on the seabed. The commercial kelp farm in Ventry Harbour was located above a Zostera marina bed which is a key habitat under the EU Habitats Directive and OSPAR Commission, yet, this macrophyte community was not adversely impacted by the presence of the farm. Results from this study show that kelp aquaculture sites provide additional ecosystem services beyond the supply of biomass. These services increase the ecological importance of farms, with multifunctional uses of farms and their infrastructure suggested. Negative impacts caused by detrital deposition on the benthos were not evident at the study site which is provisionally a very positive result for the sector as future expansion and development of the industry may not be limited by detrimental effects on the surrounding environment. However, this is {{one of the}} first studies of its kind to identify and assess the ecosystem services and impacts of commercial seaweed (kelp) farms in Europe. Many more factors such as farm scale, seaweed species, site location and hydrodynamics need to be researched in order to fully understand the ecological interactions and impacts (positive or negative) of commercial seaweed cultivation in the future...|$|R
