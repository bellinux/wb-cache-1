5|$|Following the docking, Mirs <b>attitude</b> <b>control</b> {{system was}} used to spin the station, to provide spin-stabilisation {{in order to further}} {{conserve}} the fuel, as the station had descended to an altitude at which its gyroscopes could not be used for <b>attitude</b> <b>control.</b> The station would remain in this spin until the deorbit manoeuvres began.|$|E
5|$|About 257 seconds {{into the}} flight, {{the second stage}} cut off, and the rocket entered a coast phase to apogee. Immediately after cut-off, the second stage <b>attitude</b> <b>control</b> system was pressurised. During the coast the correct {{orientation}} for third stage separation was maintained {{by means of the}} <b>attitude</b> <b>control</b> system. Towards the end of the coast period, the third stage was spun up to a rate of 3hertz (180rpm) by means of six Imp rockets. Five seconds later, the third stage separated, and following ten more seconds of coasting, it ignited. The third stage was a Waxwing solid rocket motor, which burned for 55 seconds.|$|E
5|$|In September 1994, {{after nearly}} five years of {{directed}} observations, the gas supply for its <b>attitude</b> <b>control</b> was exhausted and the observatory {{was placed in a}} non-directed survey mode. Transmissions finally ceased on 27 November 1998.|$|E

5|$|The {{attitude}} was controlled with three hydrazine thrusters. The satellite transmitted data {{back to the}} ground with S-Band and Very High Frequency (VHF) transmitters, at a rate of 15 Mbit/s and 6 bit quantization. The satellite had three-axis fine <b>attitude</b> <b>control</b> with four wheels, which gave it +/- 0.7 degrees of control. The <b>attitude</b> <b>control</b> system also used horizon scanners, sun sensors, and a command antenna. A freon gas propulsion system allowed the satellite to make fine attitude adjustments. Landsat 2 could store 30 minutes worth of data on two wide-band video tape recorders.|$|E
5|$|The main {{spacecraft}} propulsion {{was controlled}} with three hydrazine thrusters. An <b>attitude</b> <b>control</b> system permitted the spacecraft's orientation {{to be maintained}} within plus or minus 0.7 degrees in all three axes.|$|E
5|$|Thrust {{vectoring}} {{was used}} to provide <b>attitude</b> <b>control</b> {{on the first two}} stages. The eight first stage combustion chambers were arranged in pairs which could gimbal either way along one axis. Two of the pairs were arranged perpendicular to the other two, and when all four pairs were used together, they provided roll, pitch and yaw control. The second stage had two combustion chambers, which could gimbal along two axes, providing the same level of control. During a coast phase after second stage cut-off, the rocket was controlled by a reaction control system. The third stage did not have an <b>attitude</b> <b>control</b> system, and was instead spin-stabilised.|$|E

25|$|The <b>Attitude</b> and Articulation <b>Control</b> Subsystem (AACS) {{controls}} the spacecraft orientation (its attitude).

5|$|As another active seismic experiment, the jettisoned LM ascent stages on Apollo 12 {{and later}} {{missions}} were deliberately crashed on the Moon at known locations. The only {{exceptions to this}} were the Apollo 13 LM which burned up in the Earth's atmosphere, and Apollo 16, where a loss of <b>attitude</b> <b>control</b> after jettison prevented making a targeted impact.|$|E
5|$|Salyut 6's {{propulsion}} system experienced a serious malfunction {{during the second}} crew residency in 1978 and was not usable again {{for the remainder of}} the station's lifespan. As a consequence, it was limited to firing its <b>attitude</b> <b>control</b> thrusters and visiting spacecraft had to perform orbital adjustments. After each crew residency ended, it was necessary for Progress and TKS spacecraft to boost the station into a high orbit so it wouldn't decay until the next residency began.|$|E
5|$|The second {{expedition}} to Mir, EO-2, launched on Soyuz TM-2 on 5 February 1987. During their stay, the Kvant-1 module, launched on 30 March 1987, arrived. It {{was the first}} experimental version of a planned series of '37K' modules scheduled to be launched to Mir on Buran. Kvant-1 was originally planned to dock with Salyut 7; due to technical problems during its development, it was reassigned to Mir. The module carried {{the first set of}} six gyroscopes for <b>attitude</b> <b>control.</b> The module also carried instruments for X-ray and ultraviolet astrophysical observations.|$|E

5|$|There {{were also}} {{proposals}} {{to use the}} Gemini spacecraft to conduct long-duration missions to small, purpose-built space stations in low-Earth orbit. One proposal saw a space station based on the Agena, {{which would have been}} used to provide propulsion and <b>attitude</b> <b>control</b> for the station. A pressurized module between the Agena and the docking adapter would have been used by the crew for accommodation and to conduct experiments. The crew would have boarded the Agena by means of an inflatable tunnel between the hatches and its airlock. The Pecan spacecraft was a similar proposal.|$|E
5|$|Soyuz TM-9 {{launched}} EO-6 {{crew members}} Anatoly Solovyev and Aleksandr Balandin on 11 February 1990. While docking, the EO-5 crew noted that three thermal blankets on the ferry were loose, potentially creating problems on reentry, {{but it was}} decided that they would be manageable. Their stay on board Mir saw the addition of the Kristall module, launched 31 May 1990. The first docking attempt on 6 June was aborted due to an <b>attitude</b> <b>control</b> thruster failure. Kristall arrived at the front port on 10 June and was relocated to the lateral port opposite Kvant-2 the next day, restoring the equilibrium of the complex. Due to the delay in the docking of Kristall, EO-6 was extended by 10 days to permit the activation of the module’s systems and to accommodate an EVA to repair the loose thermal blankets on Soyuz TM-9.|$|E
5|$|Two Gemini-derived {{spacecraft}} {{were considered}} for unmanned resupply flights. The {{first of these}} would have involved a Gemini spacecraft, with all systems for manned flight, re-entry and landing removed. The spacecraft would have docked using a port {{at the front of}} the spacecraft. Cargo would have been transferred through the nose of the spacecraft, where the re-entry <b>attitude</b> <b>control</b> system was located on the manned spacecraft. The spacecraft was equipped with a liquid propellant engine to perform rendezvous, and to reboost the space station. The other proposal was for a new spacecraft to be built for unmanned missions, but re-using as many Gemini systems as possible. It would have had a higher cargo capacity than the stripped-down version of the Gemini spacecraft.|$|E
50|$|Helicopters with teetering rotors—for {{example the}} two-blade {{system on the}} Bell, Robinson and others—must not be {{subjected}} to a low-g condition because such rotor systems do not <b>control</b> the fuselage <b>attitude.</b> This can result in the fuselage assuming an <b>attitude</b> <b>controlled</b> by momentum and tail rotor thrust that causes the tail boom to intersect the main rotor tip-path plane or result in the blade roots contacting the main rotor drive shaft, causing the blades to separate from the hub (mast bumping).|$|R

Pitch and yaw sweeps were made about the trim <b>attitudes</b> with the <b>control</b> held at the trimmed settings to determine the static stability characteristics.

5|$|The {{rendezvous}} and first-ever docking {{between two}} spacecraft was successfully completed after 6.5 hours in orbit. Contact {{with the crew}} was intermittent {{due to the lack}} of tracking stations covering their entire orbits. Out of contact with the ground, the docked spacecraft began to roll, and Armstrong attempted to correct this with the Orbital Attitude and Maneuvering System (OAMS) of the Gemini spacecraft. Following the earlier advice of Mission Control, they undocked, but found that the roll increased dramatically to the point where they were turning about once per second, which meant the problem was in their Gemini's <b>attitude</b> <b>control.</b> Armstrong decided the only course of action was to engage the Reentry Control System (RCS) and turn off the OAMS. Mission rules dictated that once this system was turned on, the spacecraft would have to reenter at the next possible opportunity. It was later thought that damaged wiring made one of the thrusters become stuck in the on position.|$|E
