This subterfuge, however, proved too much for Harry. He never spoke to Jack again. When Harry Warner died on July 27, 1958, Jack did not attend the funeral, and he departed for his annual vacation at Cap d'Antibes. [...] Asked to respond to his brother's death, Jack said, [...] "I didn't give <b>a</b> <b>shit</b> <b>about</b> Harry." [...] At the same time, Jack took pride in the fact that President Dwight D. Eisenhower sent him a letter of condolence.|$|E
500|$|Described by her actress, Lauren Cohan, as [...] "a female Humphrey Bogart", Bela is [...] "a {{little bit}} manipulative" [...] and she [...] "always {{wants to be}} in control". According to series creator Eric Kripke, the writers {{conceptualized}} the character as [...] "someone [...] really never come across before" [...] because, though she moves throughout the supernatural world, Bela has no interest in the [...] "altruistic or obsessed or revenge-minded motives of hunting". Writer and producer Sera Gamble summarized the writing team's characterization of Bela as a greedy [...] "mercenary that [...] just [...] give <b>a</b> <b>shit</b> <b>about</b> the cause". Gamble believed that Bela [...] "finds it quite amusing" [...] that the Winchesters use their knowledge of the supernatural to help people. On this aspect, Gamble added, [...] "I always suspect when someone is that blasé that there's something underneath, and we're finally getting into that".|$|E
500|$|The album debuted on the Billboard 200 {{at number}} 144. Geffen shipped {{about half of}} the initial US {{pressing}} to the American Northwest, where it sold out quickly and was unavailable for days. Geffen reputedly put production of all other albums on hold in order to fulfill demand in the region. Nevermind was already selling well but, over the next few months, the momentum increased significantly as [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit" [...] unexpectedly became more and more popular. The song's video had received a world premiere on MTV's late night alternative show 120 Minutes but it soon proved so popular that the channel began playing it during the day. The record was soon certified Gold, but the band was relatively uninterested in the achievement. Novoselic recalled, [...] "Yeah I was happy about it. It was pretty cool. It was kind of neat. But I don't give <b>a</b> <b>shit</b> <b>about</b> some kind of achievement like that. It's cool—I guess." ...|$|E

2500|$|Williams {{took the}} 2003 Kansas {{team to the}} NCAA {{championship}} game against Syracuse. Syracuse defeated Kansas, 81–78, to win the championship. The {{end of the season}} brought a cloud of uncertainty over KU, as Williams' future was up in the air. During CBS' exit interview with Williams, he was consistently asked if he was taking the North Carolina job instead of his current Kansas team's effort, eventually inspiring him to say to the reporter [...] "I could give <b>a</b> <b>shit</b> <b>about</b> North Carolina right now" [...] to the live mic. Chancellor Robert Hemenway fired KU Athletic Director Al Bohl, and while he cited Bohl's involvement in an academic scandal at Fresno State, many perceived the move as a desperate move to keep Williams at KU, as the relationship between Bohl and Williams was very poor. Bohl reacted angrily, accusing Williams of engineering the firing.|$|E
2500|$|On November 20, 1955, African-American rock 'n' roll {{singer and}} guitarist Bo Diddley {{appeared}} on The Ed Sullivan Show, only to infuriate Sullivan ("I did two songs {{and he got}} mad"). Diddley {{had been asked to}} sing Tennessee Ernie Ford's hit [...] "Sixteen Tons", which he agreed. But when he appeared on stage, he forgot his cue and instead sang his #1 R hit song that bears his name. Diddley later recalls, [...] "Ed Sullivan says to me in plain words: 'You are the first black boy—quote—that ever double crossed me!' I was ready to fight, because I was a little young dude off the streets of Chicago, an' him callin' me 'black' in them days was as bad as sayin' 'nigger'. My manager says to me 'That's Mr. Sullivan!' I said: 'I don’t give <b>a</b> <b>shit</b> <b>about</b> Mr. Sullivan, e don't talk to me like that!' An' so he told me, he says, 'I'll see that you never work no more in show business.

2500|$|In 1999, Gurewitz {{reunited with}} Graffin to co-write a song together, called [...] "Believe It", which would appear on their next album, The New America (2000). For it, Todd Rundgren, an early musical {{inspiration}} for Graffin, {{was brought in}} to produce. [...] "Todd was kind of an underground sensation back in 1974. Here's a guy who was making pop music but in a way that you wouldn't hear on the radio. So much of my early musical identity was wrapped up in the way he conducted himself." [...] In the summer of 2000, they set out on a 3-month U.S. arena tour opening for Blink-182. Unfortunately, the experience might not have been all that Greg {{and the rest of the}} band might have hoped. Interest in recording the record waned, due to Rundgren's poor attitude. Jay Bentley reflects on this by saying, [...] "I didn't feel we were going anywhere and so did Greg. Todd didn't like Greg and that made Greg so mad! He met his idol and he was a jerk! I don't think Todd gave <b>a</b> <b>shit</b> <b>about</b> anything." [...] However, Graffin later writes in his book, Anarchy Evolution, that although Todd Rundgren was difficult to work with, he and Graffin are friends to this day.

Students from eight schools around the country participated in the show which featured musical theatre, spoken word and interpretative dance. President Barack Obama made a surprise appearance at the event. Smith adopted a school in Greenfield, California also lobbied Speaker of the House of Representatives John Boehner for increased funding for arts education and that it is a personal issue for him. Smith said [...] "I didn't give <b>a</b> <b>shit</b> <b>about</b> science, math or English when I was in school and music was the only reason I wanted to go. It got me interested in other subjects and I would've never graduated without it. If kids can connect with some sort of art in some way, it will enrich their lives in ways they probably can't fully comprehend at the time." [...] Earlier in the week, Smith was joined by former New York Yankee and musician, Bernie Williams at Savoy Elementary School in Washington, D.C. where together they taught a music class. [...] "These are schools where the kids look down at their feet and have no hope and don't feel like they mean anything. They have no self-worth. They need something. This is not a photo-op and just throwing some money. You really roll your sleeves up and immerse yourself in the school." [...] Smith said.|$|E
