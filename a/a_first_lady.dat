5|$|In 1994, the Pat Nixon Park was {{established}} in Cerritos, California. The site where her girlhood home stood is on the property. The Cerritos City Council voted in April 1996 to erect a statue of the former first lady, {{one of the few}} statues created in the image of <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>lady.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Eleanor Roosevelt Monument in New York's Riverside Park was {{dedicated}} in 1996, with First Lady Hillary Clinton {{serving as the}} keynote speaker. It {{is said to be}} the first monument to an American president's wife. The centerpiece is a statue of Eleanor sculpted by Penelope Jencks, and the surrounding granite pavement contains inscriptions designed by the architect Michael Middleton Dwyer, including summaries of her achievements, and a quote from her 1958 speech at the United Nations advocating universal human rights. The following year, the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial {{was dedicated}}; it has a bronze statue of Eleanor Roosevelt standing before the United Nations emblem, which honors her dedication to the United Nations. It is the only presidential memorial to depict <b>a</b> <b>First</b> <b>Lady.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>As</b> <b>first</b> <b>lady</b> Abigail Fillmore left {{a legacy}} of women and work. <b>As</b> <b>first</b> <b>lady</b> the public was aware that she was educated and {{had worked as a}} teacher.

Abigail paved the way for future women and future <b>first</b> <b>ladies</b> to receive <b>an</b> education and become teachers.|$|R

50|$|Patricia Kempthorne (born June 3, 1950) was the <b>First</b> <b>Lady</b> of Idaho and {{the wife}} of Gov. Dirk Kempthorne. Mrs. Kempthorne was Idaho's <b>first</b> <b>lady</b> from 1999 until 2006. <b>As</b> <b>first</b> <b>lady</b> she was active in issues {{affecting}} children and families in Idaho and {{took the lead in}} assisting state government with children's policy.

25|$|Dorset was {{a notorious}} womanizer. Augustus FitzRoy, 3rd Duke of Grafton became Prime Minister and his {{mistress}} Anne Parsons had the influence, {{if not the}} position, of <b>a</b> <b>First</b> <b>Lady</b> in her country. The Duke divorced his wife on the 23 March 1769. Parsons may have become the First Minister's wife had he not discovered that Parsons {{was having an affair}} with Sackville.|$|E
25|$|After {{assuming}} office, Ray tightened Washington {{state spending}} and began an audit of state salaries and programs. She balanced {{the state budget}} and during her tenure as Governor oversaw the state's first full funding for basic education. As the first resident of the Governor's Mansion without <b>a</b> <b>First</b> <b>Lady,</b> Ray hired her elder sister Marion R. Reid to serve as her official hostess.|$|E

500|$|In April 2009, {{three months}} after the Bushes left office, Martha Gore wrote an op-ed piece titled, [...] "Laura Bush: <b>A</b> <b>First</b> <b>Lady</b> who made America proud," [...] where she {{positively}} assessed Bush's role as First Lady and expressed Bush's successes were rooted in the dignity she brought to the office despite her reserved style as well as her making a good role model for young women and representing American womanhood at its finest. Gore concluded, [...] "Now that Ms. Bush has returned to private life, she will continue to be remembered as <b>a</b> <b>First</b> <b>Lady</b> who did America proud." [...] A 2014 poll which asked who was the most popular First Lady in the past 25 years found Bush ranked in fourth place (out of 4 candidates), behind Hillary Clinton, mother-in-law Barbara and direct successor Michelle Obama.|$|E
500|$|According to {{historian}} Myra Gutin, {{this was}} the first time in history that <b>a</b> <b>First</b> <b>Lady</b> had ever directly reached out to historians to talk about her accomplishments. Attendants of the meeting said that Bush wanted to change the perception that she was a traditional First Lady in that she always stayed by her husband's side. Bush's chief of staff Anita McBride called this characterization of Bush [...] "unfair" [...] and though conceding that she was traditional, McBride noted Bush broke from tradition in addressing issues that were not customary.|$|E
500|$|McCain {{stated that}} the American public wanted <b>a</b> <b>First</b> <b>Lady</b> of the United States who would tend toward a {{traditional}} role in that position. [...] She would not attend Cabinet meetings, but would continue her involvement in overseas non-profit organizations and would urge Americans {{to do the same}} globally or locally. She envisioned herself as a possible figurehead for humanitarian work, along the lines of Diana, Princess of Wales. [...] She continued to expand her roles in such organizations, joining in April 2008 the board of Grateful Nation Montana, which provides scholarships and services to the children of Montana service personnel killed in Iraq and Afghanistan.|$|E

500|$|Howard Gordon, the {{executive}} producer of 24, said that, during character development, they [...] "wanted an actress that had the strength and intelligence to be <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>lady,</b> yet have the unpredictability of never knowing when she might snap." [...] Jean Smart was their first choice. [...] Smart later told The New York Times that she decided she was eager to play the role after reading the character's introductory scene, and commented that in her almost 30years of acting she had come across few roles that offered the possibilities that this one did: a character that is sexy, mysterious, and powerful, yet is mentally unstable and has lost her trust and respect for her husband.|$|E
500|$|In an 1869 Congressional {{investigation}} into the gold panic, Democrats on the House investigation committee questioned why Julia Grant had received a package from the Adams Express Company containing money reported to be $25,000. Another source claims that the package was just $25.00, but nonetheless, it was highly unusual for <b>a</b> <b>First</b> <b>Lady</b> to receive cash in the mail. Corbin had bought gold at 33 margin and sold at 37, leaving Julia a profit of $27,000. [...] Neither Mrs. Grant nor Mrs. Corbin testified {{in front of the}} investigation committee. [...] In 1876 Secretary of State Hamilton Fish revealed to Grant in that Orville E. Babcock, another private secretary to the President, had also been involved in gold speculations in 1869.|$|E
500|$|At first, Imelda did {{the duties}} {{expected}} of <b>a</b> <b>First</b> <b>Lady,</b> the examples set aside by her predecessors. She graced a fashion show, inaugurated a bank, attended the army ladies' tea. Mid-January 1966, she announced her intricate and expansive plans to the public. Ferdinand asked Imelda [...] "to revive the national pride and curb national weaknesses." [...] Imelda's answer was the Cultural Center.The Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP) {{is considered to}} be the premier symbol of Imelda's unrelenting efforts. It was designed by Architect Leandro Locsin, and was built on a reclaimed land along Roxas Boulevard, Manila and covered an area of about 21 hectares. Ninety thousand pesos was granted by the Philippine-American Culture Foundation for its construction. Upon completion, however, it amounted to Php 50 million — a 333.33% increase from the original budget. Although it is notable that prices of the construction materials such as cement, steel, and tiles increased by 30–40% within this time frame, the escalation in the increase of the expenditures are highly questionable.|$|E
50|$|<b>As</b> <b>First</b> <b>Lady</b> she put {{together}} various art exhibitions focusing on Salvador Dalí, Diego Rivera, and Frida Kahlo, and Florida artists.|$|R

500|$|She proved {{popular as}} <b>a</b> <b>First</b> <b>Lady.</b> [...] She was a {{frequent}} speaker at events and before civic groups and became known for her eloquence. [...] She was thus useful to his political career, {{just as she had}} been to his business one. [...] Like her husband, she did not make public appearances on Sundays. [...] He was re-elected in 1964 and 1966, and she campaigned frequently with him. [...] Moreover, she played more of an active and partisan role within her party than any Michigan first lady before or after her. [...] She knew his policy positions at least as well as any of his official aides, went with him on almost all of his out-of-state trips, and gave his speeches for him if sudden events made him unable to attend. [...] Over time an impression grew among some in the public that she was smarter than he was. [...] George Romney biographer T. George Harris concluded in 1967 that [...] "she has been considerably more than a first lady." ...|$|E
500|$|On the issues, Trump labeled himself [...] "very conservative," [...] but {{described}} {{his views on}} healthcare as [...] "quite liberal" [...] and [...] "getting much more liberal," [...] explaining [...] "I believe in universal health care. I believe in {{whatever it takes to}} make people well and better [...] [...] [...] [...] t's an entitlement to this country if we're going to have a great country." [...] He expressed opposition to NAFTA, gun control, and {{said he would like to}} see alcohol corporations sued in the same manner as tobacco corporations. [...] For his first presidential term, he proclaimed, [...] "I want to do the right job: straighten out Social Security, get the trade deficits in order, and lower taxes." [...] As for the lack of <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>lady,</b> Trump said he could solve the issue [...] "in 24 hours" [...] by marrying his 29-year-old girlfriend, model Melania Knauss. [...] In a later interview, Knauss said she would marry Trump under such notice. [...] In the role, she said, [...] "I would be very traditional. Like Betty Ford or Jackie Kennedy. I would support him." [...] Trump described Knauss as [...] "a woman of great style and elegance [...] [...] [...] very poised and gracious and able to get along with everyone." ...|$|E
500|$|Some critics {{called it}} {{inappropriate}} {{for the first}} lady to {{play a central role}} in matters of public policy. Supporters pointed out that Clinton's role in policy was no different from that of other White House advisors and that voters had been well aware that she would play an active role in her husband's presidency. Bill Clinton's campaign promise of [...] "two for the price of one" [...] led opponents to refer derisively to the Clintons as [...] "co-presidents" [...] or sometimes use the Arkansas label [...] "Billary". The pressures of conflicting ideas about the role of <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>lady</b> were enough to send Hillary Clinton into [...] "imaginary discussions" [...] with the also-politically-active Eleanor Roosevelt. From the time she came to Washington, Hillary also found refuge in a prayer group of the Fellowship that featured many wives of conservative Washington figures. Triggered in part by the death of her father in April 1993, she publicly sought to find a synthesis of Methodist teachings, liberal religious political philosophy and Tikkun editor Michael Lerner's [...] "politics of meaning" [...] to overcome what she saw as America's [...] "sleeping sickness of the soul"; that would lead to a willingness [...] "to remold society by redefining what it means to be a human being in the twentieth century, moving into a new millennium." ...|$|E

500|$|The fashion press {{tends to}} take special {{interest}} in First Ladies. The traditional role of <b>a</b> <b>First</b> <b>Lady</b> as the nation's hostess puts her personal appearance and style under scrutiny, and the attention to Pat was lively. Women's Wear Daily stated that Pat had a [...] "good figure and good posture", as well as [...] "the best-looking legs of any woman in public life today". Some fashion writers tended to have a lackluster opinion of her well tailored, but nondescript, American-made clothes. [...] "I consider it my duty to use American designers", she said, and favored them because, [...] "they are now using so many materials which are great for traveling because they're non crushable". She preferred to buy readymade garments rather than made-to-order outfits. [...] "I'm a size 10," [...] she told The New York Times. [...] "I can just walk in and buy. I've bought things in various stores in various cities. Only some of my clothes are by designers." [...] She did, however, wear the custom work of some well-known talents, notably Geoffrey Beene, {{at the suggestion of}} Clara Treyz, her personal shopper. Many fashion observers concluded that Pat Nixon did not greatly advance the cause of American fashion. Nixon's yellow-satin inaugural gown by Harvey Berin was criticized as [...] "a schoolteacher on her night out", but Treyz defended her wardrobe selections by saying, [...] "Mrs. Nixon must be ladylike." ...|$|E
500|$|Mrs. Roosevelt {{also made}} {{extensive}} use of radio. [...] She {{was not the first}} First Lady to broadcast—her predecessor, Lou Henry Hoover, had done that already. But Mrs. Hoover did not have a regular radio program, whereas Mrs. Roosevelt did. [...] She first broadcast her own programs of radio commentary beginning on [...] July 9, 1934. On that first show, she talked about the effect of movies on children, the need for a censor who could make sure movies did not glorify crime and violence, and her opinion about the recent All-Star baseball game. [...] She also read a commercial from a mattress company, which sponsored the broadcast. [...] She said she would not accept any salary for being on the air, and that she would donate the amount ($3,000) to charity. [...] Later that year, in November 1934, she broadcast a series of programs about children's education; it was heard on the CBS Radio Network. Sponsored by a typewriter company, Mrs. Roosevelt once again donated the money, giving it to the American Friends Service Committee, to help with a school it operated. [...] During 1934, Eleanor Roosevelt set a record for the most times <b>a</b> <b>First</b> <b>Lady</b> had spoken on radio: she spoke as a guest on other people's programs, as well as the host of her own, for a total of 28 times that year. [...] In 1935, Mrs. Roosevelt continued to host programs aimed at the female audience, including one called [...] "It's A Woman's World." [...] Each time, she donated the money she earned to charity. [...] The association of a sponsor with the popular First Lady resulted in increases in sales for that company: when the Selby Shoe Company sponsored a series of Eleanor Roosevelt's programs, sales increased by 200%. [...] The fact that her programs were sponsored created controversy, with her husband's political enemies expressing skepticism about whether she really did donate her salary to charity; they accused her of [...] "profiteering." [...] But her radio programs proved to be so popular with listeners that the criticisms had little effect. She continued to broadcast throughout the 1930s, sometimes on CBS and sometimes on NBC.|$|E
2500|$|In August 1975, after First Lady Betty Ford made {{comments}} on sex, Lady Bird expressed sympathy: [...] "I know {{the pressures of}} being <b>a</b> <b>First</b> <b>Lady,</b> and I think maybe she got asked one question too quick." ...|$|E
