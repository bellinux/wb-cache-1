Later, an <b>all-solid</b> <b>state</b> symmetric cell based on these rGO–PMo₁₂ electrodes, and making use of a polymer gel-electrolyte was assembled. This symmetric cell showed a significant improvement in cell performance. Indeed, it allowed for an extended potential window by 0. 3 V that led to an energy density of 1. 07 mW h cm⁻³. Finally, we combined these hybrid electrodes with a hybrid electrolyte incorporating an electroactive species. This is the first proof-of-design where a redox-active solid-state gel-electrolyte is applied to rGO–PMo₁₂ hybrid supercapacitors to accomplish a significant enhancement in the capacitance.

The ORP sensors {{were based on the}} formation of an ion-association complex between the drug cation and tetrakis(4 - chlorophenyl) borate (TpClPB) anionic exchanger as electroactive material dispersed in a PVC matrix. Linear responses of 10 - 2 - 10 - 5 M and 10 - 2 - 10 - 4 M with cationic slopes of 56. 4 mV and 53. 6 mV over the pH range 4 - 7 were obtained by using the ORP-coated graphite (sensor 1) and platinum wire (sensor 2) membrane sensors, respectively. The proposed methods displayed useful analytical characteristics for the determination of ORP in Norflex® tablets with average recoveries of 100. 01 ± 0. 83, 100. 09 ± 0. 90, and in plasma with average recoveries of 99. 4 ± 0. 97 and 98. 55 ± 0. 82, for sensor 1 and 2, respectively. The methods were also used to determine the intact drug in the presence of its degradate and thus could be used as stability indicating methods. The results obtained by the proposed procedures were statistically analyzed and compared with those obtained by using an official method. No significant difference for both accuracy and precision was observed...|$|R

Five Stokes components generated and frequency doubled cover a spectral range of 280 - 740 nm with an average power from 10 to 800 mW and a spectral width of 0. 2 cm- 1 in the visible range. Pulsed lasers generating tunable or multiwave radiation have wide applications in Raman spectroscopy. For the successful use, the developed lasers should meet such requirements as continuous tunability or multiwave operation in a wide spectral range, narrow linewidth, sufficient output power, low divergence of the laser beam, simplicity in operation and low cost. <b>All-solid</b> <b>state</b> lasers meet these requirements rather well. Especially Raman lasers using stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) of light in crystals can be promising laser sources for the spectroscopic applications. Recently, we have developed a cheap and simple Raman laser based on the well-known barium nitrate crystal which can generate nanosecond narrowband (0. 25 cm- 1 in IR) continuously tunable radiation in the ranges of 190 - 1800 nm [1, 2]. The repetition rate of this laser was equal to 10 Hz. However, for many applications in spectroscopy, especially in Raman spectroscopy, {{it is necessary to}} use laser pulses with higher repetition rates, so-called quasi-c...|$|R
