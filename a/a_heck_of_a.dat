The Saints' roster was reduced to 53 players, and Tolliver was among those cut. When the Saints lost Jeff Blake for the season in mid-November due to a dislocated foot, Tolliver was re-signed by the Saints, though he did not play a game that season. In July 2001, Tolliver was signed by the Green Bay Packers. This briefly reunited him with Brett Favre, with whom he was teammates in Atlanta. However, he was cut in the preseason when Doug Pederson won the backup job, and this stint marked the end of Tolliver's professional career.|$|E

He averaged career highs in scoring (25.5 points per game, including a league-leading 764 field goals and 560 attempted free throws) and rebounding (12.7 boards per game, and his accumulated 1042 boards again led the league), and also averaged 3.7 assists and 2.5 blocks per game, both career highs. Coupled with another pair of All-NBA and All-Defensive First Team call-ups, he was named the league's Most Valuable Player, joining teammate David Robinson as the only Spurs members to earn the honor. On the other hand, Duncan's team struggled {{with the fact that}} the aging Robinson was no longer able to sustain his level of performance, and backup center-forward Malik Rose had to step in more often. In the 2002 NBA Playoffs, the Spurs were again outmatched by the Lakers. Up against star center O'Neal once more, the Spurs were defeated 4–1 by the eventual champions. Duncan, who managed 34 points and a franchise-high 25 rebounds in Game 5, stated his frustration: [...] "I thought we really had a chance at this series.

[...] Friedgen initially intended to send the offenders back to College Park by bus, but athletic director Deborah Yow convinced him to issue partial-game suspensions instead. Scott was benched until halfway through the third quarter. He said, [...] "I made a bad decision. I felt I had to run with a purpose." [...] Scott was put into the game on Maryland's third possession of the half but did not receive a carry until the following series. On his first attempt, he ran for 14yards and then ran 11yards on his second. During the next drive, he broke free on a 49-yard touchdown run. On the next possession, Scott rushed on all four plays and gained 66yards and another touchdown. Maryland won, 42–35, and Scott was named the Terrapins' most valuable player of the game. Nevada head coach Chris Ault said, [...] "He just ran through us like we weren't there. They ran the weak-side gap, we knew that was one of their base plays, and he did a great job. He's <b>a</b> <b>heck</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> back, no question about it. He was breaking tackles, and that's not only a difference-maker but a morale-changer." [...] He ran for 174yards, which broke the school record for rushing in a bowl game previously set by Lu Gambino in the 1948 Gator Bowl. Scott also became just the seventh Maryland player to surpass the 1,000-yard single-season rushing benchmark. Earlier in the season, Scott set that mark as one of his goals, and he adorned his room with the statistics of the Terrapins who accomplished that feat in the past, such as Chris Downs in 2002.|$|E
