5|$|Croatia has a {{civil law}} legal {{system in which}} law arises {{primarily}} from written statutes, with judges serving merely as implementers, and not creators of law. Its development was largely influenced by German and Austrian legal systems. Croatian law {{is divided into two}} principal areas – private and public law. By the time EU accession negotiations were completed on 30 June 2010, Croatian legislation was fully harmonised with the Community <b>acquis.</b> The main law in the county is the Constitution adopted on December 22, 1990.|$|E
5|$|Croatia is {{a unitary}} {{democratic}} parliamentary republic. Following {{the collapse of}} the ruling Communist League, Croatia adopted a new constitution in 1990 – which replaced the 1974 constitution adopted by the Socialist Republic of Croatia – and organised its first multi-party elections. While the 1990 constitution remains in force, it has been amended four times since its adoptionin 1997, 2000, 2001 and 2010. Croatia declared independence from Yugoslavia on 8 October 1991, which led to the breakup of Yugoslavia. Croatia's status as a country was internationally recognised by the United Nations in 1992. Under its 1990 constitution, Croatia operated a semi-presidential system until 2000 when it switched to a parliamentary system. Government powers in Croatia are divided into legislative, executive and judiciary powers. The legal system of Croatia is civil law and, along with the institutional framework, is strongly influenced by the legal heritage of Austria-Hungary. By the time EU accession negotiations were completed on 30 June 2010, Croatian legislation was fully harmonised with the Community <b>acquis.</b> Croatia became a member state of the European Union on 1 July 2013.|$|E
5|$|Within this unitary framework, Turkey is {{subdivided}} into 81 provinces (il or vilayet) for administrative purposes. Each province {{is divided into}} districts (ilçe), {{for a total of}} 923 districts. Turkey is also {{subdivided into}} 7 regions (bölge) and 21 subregions for geographic, demographic and economic purposes; this does not refer to an administrative division. The centralised structure of decision-making in Ankara is considered by some academicians as an impediment to good local governance, and occasionally causes resentment in the municipalities of urban centres that are inhabited largely by ethnic minority groups, such as the Kurds. Steps towards decentralisation since 2004 have proven to be a highly controversial topic in Turkey. The efforts to decentralise the administrative structure are also driven by the European Charter of Local Self-Government and with Chapter 22 ("Regional Policy & Coordination of Structural Instruments") of the <b>acquis</b> of the European Union. A decentralisation program for Turkey has been a topic of discussion in the country's academics, politics and the broader public.|$|E
25|$|The term <b>acquis</b> is {{also used}} to {{describe}} laws adopted under the Schengen Agreement, prior to its integration into the European Union legal order by the Treaty of Amsterdam, in which case one speaks of the Schengen <b>acquis.</b>|$|E
25|$|When Schengen was subsumed {{into the}} EU by the Treaty of Amsterdam, Ireland and the UK {{obtained}} an opt-out from {{the part of}} the treaty which was to incorporate the Schengen rules (or <b>acquis)</b> into EU Law. Under the relevant protocol, Ireland and the United Kingdom may request to participate in aspects of the Schengen <b>acquis</b> but this is subject to the approval of the Schengen states.|$|E
25|$|Another {{question}} under {{debate has}} been how the Partners and others could implement the OSCE <b>acquis,</b> in other words its principles, norms, and commitments on a voluntary basis.|$|E
25|$|Such {{negotiations}} usually involved agreeing {{transitional periods}} before {{new member states}} needed to implement {{the laws of the}} European Union fully and before they and their citizens acquired full rights under the <b>acquis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Before {{the start}} of {{negotiations}} with Croatia, the <b>acquis</b> was divided into 35 chapters, 4 {{more than the usual}} 31; the new chapters, previously part of the agricultural policy, are areas expected to be troublesome, as they were with the other applicants. Following the opening of accession negotiations on 3 October 2005, the process of screening 35 <b>acquis</b> chapters with Croatia was completed on 18 October 2006. Negotiations had been restrained for ten months because of a border dispute with Slovenia, but in September 2009 it was announced that Slovenia would remove restraints on Croatia's negotiations with the EU without prejudice to the international mediation on the border dispute.|$|E
25|$|The {{opening of}} talks {{regarding}} the Economic and Monetary Policy <b>acquis</b> chapter of Turkey's accession bid {{was expected to}} begin in June 2007, but were stalled by France. Turkey became the European Union’s fifth-largest trade partner in 2015 according to data released by Eurostat.|$|E
25|$|During {{the migrant}} crisis of September 2015, Germany {{announced}} it was temporarily bringing border controls back {{in accordance with the}} provisions on temporary border controls laid down by the Schengen <b>acquis.</b> Such border controls appear to be an attempt to prevent disorder from making the crisis worse.|$|E
25|$|The Schengen Area {{consists}} of 22 European Union member states and four non-members {{who are members}} of EFTA: Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania are not yet part of the Schengen Area but, nonetheless, have a visa policy that is based on the Schengen <b>acquis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Now {{that the}} Schengen Agreement {{is part of}} the <b>acquis</b> communautaire, it has, for EU members, lost the status of a treaty, which could only be amended {{according}} to its terms. Instead, amendments are made according to the legislative procedure of the EU under EU treaties. Ratification by the former agreement signatory states is not required for altering or repealing {{some or all of the}} former Schengen <b>acquis.</b> Legal acts setting out the conditions for entry into the Schengen Area are now made by majority vote in the EU's legislative bodies. New EU member states do not sign the Schengen Agreement as such, instead being bound to implement the Schengen rules as part of the pre-existing body of EU law, which every new entrant is required to accept.|$|E
25|$|To {{accede to}} the EU, Turkey must {{successfully}} complete {{negotiations with the}} European Commission on 33 of the 35 chapters of the <b>acquis</b> communautaire, the total body of EU law. (Two chapters do not require negotiation.) Afterwards, the member states must unanimously agree on granting Turkey membership to the European Union.|$|E
25|$|The Council of Europe's <b>acquis</b> in {{standard}} setting {{activities in the}} fields of democracy, {{the rule of law and}} fundamental human rights and freedoms should be considered as milestones towards the European political project, and the European Court of Human Rights should be recognised as the pre-eminent judicial pillar of any future architecture.|$|E
25|$|Like the UK, Gibraltar {{does not}} {{form part of}} the Schengen Area and, as a result, the border between Spain and Gibraltar is an {{external}} Schengen border through which Spain is legally obliged to perform full entrance and exit controls. However Gibraltar does participate in certain {{police and judicial cooperation}} aspects of the Schengen <b>acquis</b> in line with the UK's request to participate in the same measures.|$|E
25|$|The UK {{formally}} {{requested to}} participate in certain provisions of the Schengen <b>acquis</b> – Title III relating to Police Security and Judicial Cooperation – in 1999, and this request {{was approved by the}} Council of the European Union on 29 May 2000. The United Kingdom's formal participation in the previously approved areas of cooperation was put into effect by a 2004 Council decision that came into effect on 1 January 2005.|$|E
25|$|The OCTs are {{not subject}} to the EU's common {{external}} customs tariffs but may claim customs on goods imported from the EU on a non-discriminatory basis. They {{are not part of the}} EU and the EU <b>acquis</b> does not apply to them, though those joining OCTA are required to respect the detailed rules and procedures outlined by this association agreement (Council Decision 2013/755/EU). OCTA members are entitled to ask for EU financial support.|$|E
25|$|The Schengen Agreement and its {{implementing}} Convention were {{enacted in}} 1995 only for some signatories, but {{just over two}} years later during the Amsterdam Intergovernmental Conference, all European Union member states except the United Kingdom and Ireland had signed the Agreement. It was during those negotiations, {{which led to the}} Amsterdam Treaty, that the incorporation of the Schengen <b>acquis</b> into the main body of European Union law was agreed along with opt-outs for Ireland and the United Kingdom, which were to remain outside of the Schengen Area.|$|E
25|$|The entire island {{entered the}} EU on 1 May 2004 still divided, {{although}} the EU <b>acquis</b> communautaire – {{the body of}} common rights and obligations – applies only to the areas under direct government control, and is suspended in the areas occupied by the Turkish military and administered by Turkish Cypriots. However, individual Turkish Cypriots able to document their eligibility for Republic of Cyprus citizenship legally enjoy the same rights accorded to other citizens of European Union states. Nicosia continues to oppose EU efforts to establish direct trade and economic links to TRNC {{as a way of}} encouraging the Turkish Cypriot community to continue to support the resolution of the Cyprus dispute.|$|E
25|$|In 1957, six core states {{founded the}} EU's predecessor, the European Economic Community (Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and West Germany). The {{remaining}} states have acceded in subsequent enlargements. On 1 July 2013, Croatia became the newest member {{state of the}} EU. In order to accede, a state must fulfill {{the economic and political}} requirements known as the Copenhagen criteria, which require a candidate to have a democratic, free market government together with the corresponding freedoms and institutions, and respect for the rule of law. Enlargement of the Union is also contingent upon the consent of all existing members and the candidate's adoption of the existing body of EU law, known as the <b>acquis</b> communautaire.|$|E
25|$|The first {{rules were}} created in 1970. The {{original}} six Common Market members realised that four countries applying to join the Common Market at that time (Britain, Ireland, Denmark including Greenland, and Norway) would control the richest fishing grounds in the world. The original six therefore drew up Council Regulation 2141/70 giving all Members equal access to all fishing waters, even though the Treaty of Rome did not explicitly include fisheries in its agriculture chapter. This was adopted {{on the morning of}} 30 June 1970, a few hours before the applications to join were officially received. This ensured that the regulations became part of the <b>acquis</b> communautaire before the new members joined, obliging them to accept the regulation. In its accession negotiations, the UK at first refused to accept the rules {{but by the end of}} 1971 the UK gave way and signed the Accession Treaty on 22 January 1972, thereby bringing into the CFP joint management an estimated four fifths of all the fish off Western Europe. Norway decided not to join. Greenland left the EC in 1985, after having gained partial independence from Denmark in 1979.|$|E
25|$|From 2001 to 2004, Ponta {{held the}} rank of Secretary of State {{as head of the}} government's Control Department. In 2006, a civil servant at the Ministry of Education (who was in an ongoing feud with Ponta) charged that Ponta, while holding this office, covered up corrupt {{activities}} undertaken by former minister Hildegard Puwak, who was cleared of wrongdoing in a report issued by Ponta. Additionally, he helped uncover cases of fraudulent use of Phare funds. In 2001 he also joined the supervisory council of the Authority for State Assets Recovery, and that year he was part of a special committee investigating penal infractions committed by members of the government. In March 2004, he became Minister-Delegate for Control of International Grant Programmes Implementation and for Monitoring the Application of the <b>Acquis</b> Communautaire. A PSD member by 2002, he was from July to November of that year head of the Interim National Council of the Social Democratic Youth (TSD). That October, he {{became a member of the}} PSD's national council, and joined its executive bureau the following month, when he also became president of the TSD, remaining as such for four years. In 2005, he became a vice president of Ecosy, while he has been a vice president of the PSD since December 2006. At the 2004 election, Ponta won a seat in the Chamber of Deputies, where he served as both secretary and vice president of its permanent bureau; he was re-elected in 2008. That December, he became a minister in the incoming Boc cabinet.|$|E
2500|$|The Community <b>acquis</b> or <b>acquis</b> communautaire ( [...] ; [...] ), {{sometimes}} called the EU <b>acquis</b> and often shortened to <b>acquis,</b> is the accumulated legislation, legal acts, and court decisions which constitute the body of European Union law. The term is French: <b>acquis</b> meaning [...] "that which has been acquired or obtained", and communautaire meaning [...] "of the community".|$|E

2500|$|The term <b>acquis</b> {{has been}} {{borrowed}} by the World Trade Organization Appellate Body, {{in the case}} Japan [...] Taxes on Alcoholic Beverages, {{to refer to the}} accumulation of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and WTO law ("acquis gattien"), though this usage is not well established.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the process}} of the {{enlargement}} of the European Union, the <b>acquis</b> was divided into 31 chapters for the purpose of negotiation between the EU and the candidate member states for the fifth enlargement (the ten that joined in 2004 plus Romania and Bulgaria which joined in 2007). These chapters were: ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{contrast}} while Ireland initially {{submitted a}} request {{to participate in the}} Schengen <b>acquis</b> in 2002, which was approved by the Council of the European Union, that decision has not yet been put into effect. In February 2010 the Irish Minister for Justice, in response to a parliamentary question, said that: [...] "he measures which will enable Ireland to meet its Schengen requirements are currently being progressed".|$|E
2500|$|The {{fact that}} the Union for the Mediterranean is {{launched}} as a new phase of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership means that the Union accepts and commits to maintain the <b>acquis</b> of Barcelona, the purpose {{of which is to}} promote [...] "peace, stability and prosperity" [...] throughout the region (Barcelona, 2). Therefore, the four chapters of cooperation developed in the framework of the Barcelona Process during thirteen years remain valid: ...|$|E
2500|$|For the {{negotiations}} with Croatia (which joined in 2013), Iceland, Turkey, Montenegro, Serbia {{and in the}} future, with Macedonia, Albania (candidate countries), the <b>acquis</b> is split up into 35 chapters instead, {{with the purpose of}} better balancing between the chapters: dividing the most difficult ones into separate chapters for easier negotiation, uniting some easier chapters, moving some policies between chapters, as well as renaming a few of them in the process: ...|$|E
2500|$|To {{counter the}} {{potentially}} aggravating {{effects of the}} abolition of border controls on undocumented immigration and cross-border crime, the Schengen <b>acquis</b> contains compensatory police and judicial measures. Chief among these is the Schengen Information System (SIS), a database operated by all EU and Schengen states and which by January 2010 contained in excess of 30 million entries [...] and by January 2014 contained in excess of 50 million entries, according to a document published in June 2015 by the Council of the European Union. Around 1 million of the entries relate to persons, 72% of which {{were not allowed to}} enter and stay in the Schengen area. Only 7% of persons listed on the SIS database were missing persons.|$|E
2500|$|According to the Copenhagen criteria, {{membership}} of the European Union is open to any European country that is a stable, free market liberal democracy that respects {{the rule of law}} and human rights. Furthermore, it has to be willing to accept all the obligations of membership, such as adopting all previously agreed law (the 170,000 pages of <b>acquis</b> communautaire) and switching to the euro. In order to join the European Union, it is required for all member states to agree; if a single member state disagrees, the applying country is declined acceptance to the European Union. [...] In addition to enlargement by adding new countries, the EU can also expand by having territories of member states, which are outside the EU, integrate more closely (for example in respect to the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles) or by a territory of a member state which had previously seceded and then rejoined (see withdrawal below).|$|E
2500|$|After over 2 {{years of}} no chapter openings, the European Commission {{set up a}} [...] "Positive agenda" [...] {{designed}} to focus on common EU-Turkey interests. EU Commissioner for expansion Stefan Füle describes that the goal was [...] "to keep the accession process alive and put it properly back on track {{after a period of}} stagnation which {{has been a source of}} frustration for both sides." [...] The EU Commission mentioned a broad range of areas as the main elements of the Agenda such as “intensified dialogue and cooperation on political reforms”, “visa”, “mobility and migration”, “energy”, “fight against terrorism”, “further participation of Turkey in Community programmes”, “town twinning”, “trade and the Customs Union” and “supporting efforts to align with the <b>acquis,</b> including on chapters where accession negotiations cannot be opened for the time being”. The proposal was considered favorably on the condition that it serves as an instrument in support of and complementary to the negotiation process with the EU.|$|E
2500|$|Aix-les-Bains, a city {{founded in}} the 1st century AD, is rarely {{mentioned}} in the epigraphic texts, and never known by Roman authors. However, two inscriptions preserved by the Archaeological Museum mention of the Latin Aquae (literally: [...] "Waters" [...] cf. Aix-la-Chapelle (Aachen) or Aix-en-Provence) and Aquensis (local residents of water), so information is provided about {{the name of this}} vicus dependent on the city of Vienne. The historians of the 19th century were sometimes subjected to read fanciful names and without historical foundation that still dot some popular books. These include Aquae allobrogium, Aquae gratianæ (an inscription which adorned the façade of the National Baths from 1934 to 1968, and to commemorate the Emperor Gratian, who was assassinated not far away, in Lyon, in 383) and Allobrogum Aquae Gratianæ. The name Aquae is found in the deed of the gift of the royal land of Aix (de <b>Acquis</b> or [...] "acquired") by King Rudolph III of Burgundy to his wife Ermengarde, in 1011. Some texts from the Middle Ages mention of Aquae grationapolis. This suffix simply stating that Aix was part of the diocese of Grenoble.|$|E
