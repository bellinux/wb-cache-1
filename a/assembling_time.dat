Bionic Assembly System (BAS) is a new concept of advanced assembling system, which combines two basic control structures and principles: centralized control system, based on the hierarchy and self-organizing control system, based on the heterarchy. This paper describes hybrid control structure, working scenarios, scheduling, reconfigurations and logic of working cycles during the assembly of one unlimited sequence of assembly orders.

40|$|Natural hazards {{have become}} natural {{disasters}} since people settle in flood areas. The need of protection is increasing with rising population density and concentration of valuables in low lying coastal and river {{areas in the}} last decades. Therefore, the demand for technical protection measures is growing. Densely populated areas mostly offer little space for permanent flood protection schemes like dykes. On the other hand, space saving permanent measures like vertical flood walls cut off traffic lines and obstruct the view. Therefore, urban areas are often poorly protected against flooding despite of high concentrations of valuables on site. Recently, more and more mobile protection schemes are on the market promising to fit both requirements: protection in case of flooding and open access to the floodplain in the remaining time. The protection systems differ in material, construction, height, and permanent facilities. They can be divided in structures made of sandbags, plates, concrete elements, basins, flaps, trestles, and geomembrane containers. For practical use, a systematisation of the structures with regard to reliability, <b>assembling</b> <b>time,</b> purchase and maintenance costs is necessary.

40|$|Manufacturing {{technologies}} are successful {{when they are}} flexible, simple and reliable. Laser processes have the challenge of high investment costs and they require expert handling and high demands on the system safety as well. The core components of the system are the laser and NC ma-chine. Furthermore the essential system parts for a successful hardening process are the housing, beam shaping modules and the temperature controller. In modern machine concepts all modules are connected by field bus interfaces and are controllable by a main PLC. For aspects of safety a laser and robot enclosure built according to standards and guidelines is crucial. For the monitoring of safety interfaces according to current standards, safety-related controls and components have to be designed, calculated, validated and documented. For the effective use of an expensive laser machine the combination of laser hardening and cladding processes is increasingly requested. At Fraunhofer IWS Dresden, laser heat treatment is used and has been continuously developed for many years.

40|$|Automatic {{assembly}} systems plays {{vital role}} in automating production process. They directly affect production efficiency {{and quality of the}} goods. According to the statistical analysis, 30 - 60 % of the tasks in most of the industries branches are assembly operations. Part <b>assembling</b> <b>time</b> takes 35 - 40 % of all manufacture time. Around 33 % of all assembly operations are peg to bush assembly operations. Because of that, assembly operation has big potential in reducing manufacture time by improving assembly methods and installing automatic part assembly systems and devices. This work investigates a new approach of passive vibratory part alignment method using elastic vibrations. In this method bush placed on the assembly plane and is free to move in a narrow space. Another component (peg) fixed in a gripper, which has piezoelectric vibrator in it. Vibrator presses upper end of the peg. Peg and a bush also pressed to each other with a predetermined force. Piezoelectric vibrator generates high frequency harmonic excitation to the peg and creates elastic vibrations of the peg in longitudinal and lateral directions. The lower end of the peg moves in elliptical shape trajectory. Because of the friction force between the components, bush moves to the part alignment direction. Parts successfully assembled after the alignment occurs. This passive alignment method allows assembling parts with circular and rectangular cross-section with no chamfers and at their axial misalignment of few millimetres, or makes it possible to use low accuracy robots Detailed analysis of scientific papers about widely used part alignment methods in a now days industry was done. Vibrations of the peg’s tip while he is in a contact with bush were investigated. Nature of the peg’s vibrations, their relationship to the excitation signal amplitude and bush-to-peg pressing force were determined. Part alignment experiments have been done with circular and rectangular cross-section pegs using their elastic vibrations. Influence of excitation and mechanical system parameters to the alignment efficiency and reliability were determined. Mathematical model of circular part alignment when the peg excited in axial and transversal direction were composed. Excitation signal and mechanical system parameters for the stable and reliable part alignment at impact and non-impact modes were determined...|$|E

40|$|Conjugated {{polymers}} {{have been}} widely utilized in applications such as electrochromic devices, organic photovoltaics, smart windows, organic transistors etc. Their unique electric properties {{and the ability to}} reversibly change color under external electrical stimuli, combined with their low cost, high coloration efficiency and versatile structures make them ideal candidates for the aforementioned applications. However, the processability issue faced by many conjugated polymers, along with the inefficient traditional assembly approach, greatly limited the use of some readily available conjugate polymer materials. We have found a simple yet efficient alternative assembling method in which monomers were mixed with polymer electrolyte before converted to their polymer forms. This novel approach, termed 2 ̆ 2 in situ assembly 2 ̆ 2, is applicable to any monomer that can be dissolved in the electrolyte solution, less sensitive to the polymerization environment, and can reduce <b>assembling</b> <b>time</b> and cost without sacrificing device quality and stability. The device fabrication, polymerization kinetics and mechanism were discussed in Chapter 3. Furthermore, because polymerization takes place after the device assembly, it offers a unique platform for studies that cannot be performed in traditional methods. For example, a high through-put copolymer selection model based on this platform was discussed in Chapter 4. The fundamental of diffusion of small molecules in solid state electrolyte matrix was used as a way to determine how monomer feed ratio affects the resulting copolymer properties. Copolymers of two or more monomers with various ratios can be obtained and characterized in a single run. This method can precisely identify the feed ratio needed to achieve a specific desired color, and could be extended to any other applications that require customized copolymer compositions. ^ We have also extended electrochromic studies onto a spandex fabric substrate. Spandex was impregnated with PEDOT-PSS, a conjugated polymer complex dispersed in water, in order to achieve a conductive fabric. The resulted fabric has a reasonable conductivity and retained the stretchability of the spandex as investigated. This unique substrate is the base of a stretchable color-changing fabric device. By studying the electrical properties of the spandex fabric, the performance of electrochromic material on the substrates as well as assembled devices were investigated in Chapter 5 and Chapter 6. Chapter 7 introduced the development of a break-through stretchable polymer electrolyte. With this electrolyte we have achieved all the key factors that could are essential for making the 2 ̆ 2 truly wearable displays 2 ̆ 2. ...|$|E
40|$|Future {{trend in}} {{communication}} {{system is to}} move to all-optical network. Optical Burst Switching (OBS) has been proposed as a new paradigm for switching and data transfer in all-optical network. One of the main challenges in deploying OBS network is to ensure QoS guarantee in minimising the contention and latency. The objective of this thesis is to develop OBS network that can ensure Quality-of- Service (QoS) by designing the ingress node that minimises delay and core node that minimises contention. In the ingress node, priority queueing (PQ) and burst assembly are deployed in differentiated service aware environment to decrease packet delay. Meanwhile, in the core node, integral of Fiber Delay Line, Wavelength Assignment and Wavelength Preemption (FDL-WA-WPremp) are proposed to minimise Burst Loss Probability (BLP) due to contention. In FDL, contending bursts are sent to travel over a longer fiber line and are, thus, delayed for a specific amount of time. In wavelength assignment, each traffic class has a pre-assigned wavelength for the transmission of bursts. Finally the wavelength preemption technique allows the higher priority traffic to preempt the lower priority traffic, when there is contention or, no available bandwidth for the transmission of the higher priority traffic. Three DiffServ class types that represent multimedia applications, including real time constant bit rate Expedited Forwarding (EF) traffic, real-time variable bit rate Assured Forwarding (AF) traffic and non-real time Best Effort (BE) traffic are investigated in the study. The proposed OBS network and traffic models have been developed using JAVA platform simulator and validated with mathematical analysis. The proposed OBS network performance parameters have been analysed based on BLP, packet end-to-end delay, bandwidth utilisation and throughput. The {{results show that the}} proposed OBS network with FDL_WA_WPremp, PQ and hybrid burst assembly; that is an event where burst is generated whenever the maximum <b>assembling</b> <b>time</b> is achieved or a minimum burst size is obtained, whichever occurs first, significantly improve the OBS network throughput by 10 % compared to the technique without contention resolution. The proposed OBS network enhances the performance of EF, AF and BE traffic with BLP reduction of up to 70 %, 42 % and 34 % respectively compared with OBS network with FDL only. In addition, the endto end delay performance of the EF and AF traffic deploying FDL_WA_WPremp with hybrid based assembly environment give 21. 7 % and 17. 2 % improvement compared to FDL_WA_WPremp with timer based. The overall findings prove that QoS provisioning can be guaranteed through FDL_WA_WPremp, PQ and hybrid burst assembly in OBS network. The proposed OBS network can therefore be deployed in the future all-optical network...|$|E
