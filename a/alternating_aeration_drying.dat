Initially, partial nitrification was established, and then the DO concentration was lowered further, surplus water in the SBR with high nitrite was replaced with tap water, and continuous aeration mode was turned into intermittent aeration mode, while the removal of total nitrogen was still weak. However, the total nitrogen (TN) removal efficiency and nitrogen removal loading reached 83. 07 % and 0. 422 [*]kgN/(m 3 ·d), respectively, 14 days after inoculating 0. 15 [*]g of CANON biofilm biomass into the SBR.

The EF under steady solids loading required a minimum unit height and gas:solids ratio of 0. 006 for efficient clarification. The separated sludge blanket was further thickened with retaining stability when the cyclic solids loading was smaller than 1. 0 kg m^(− 2). In the continuous operation of the bioreactor, the returned activated sludge concentration increased to more than 18, 000 mg L^(− 1), while the effluent suspended solids concentration was lowered below 5 mg L^(− 1). Under influent chemical oxygen demand (COD) /total inorganic nitrogen (TIN) concentration of 300 / 30 mg L^(− 1), the TIN removal efficiency was near 70 % with cycle time ratios of 0. 17 and 0. 27.

40|$|ABSTRACT – (Growth of red {{and green}} strains of the {{tropical}} agarophyte Gracilaria cornea J. Agardh (Gracilariales, Rhodophyta) in laboratory). Gracilaria cornea J. Agardh is an important agarophyte occurring in the western Atlantic Ocean. Green colour individuals of G. cornea were found in a natural population, growing next to red individuals, which were more common. Due {{to the importance of}} colour strains in genetic and intraspecific variability studies, this work aimed to characterize the red and green strains evaluating different nutritional and light conditions. Red and green gametophytes were cultivated at 14 : 10 light: dark cycle, with <b>alternating</b> <b>aeration</b> periods of 30 min. Two different enriched solutions were tested: von Stosch (VSS) at concentrations reduced to 12. 5 % and 25 %; and Provasoli (PES) at concentrations reduced to 25 % and 50 %, and 100 %. Red and green gametophytes were cultivated at the irradiance of 45 µmol photons m- 2 s- 1. In another experiment utilizing PES 100 %, two sources of light (Osram 40 W daylight fluorescent tubes and Sylvania Designer 3, 500 tubes) were tested at irradiances of 90 and 180 µmol photons m- 2 s- 1. Growth rates (GR) were evaluated for five weeks. Gametophytes developed few branches and reproductive structures were not induced. Differences were not observed between GR {{of red and}} green strains in the conditions tested. GR were higher in VSS 12. 5 % (8. 4 % day- 1) than in 25 % (7. 1 % day- 1), suggesting an adaptation of the species to low nutrient concentrations. GR were higher at 180 (9. 0 % day- 1) than at 90 µmol photons m- 2 s- 1 (6. 3 % day- 1). These results suggest that G. cornea should be cultivated in laboratory at high irradiances and low nutrient concentrations.

40|$|An {{axisymmetric}} {{finite element}} model was developed {{that takes into account}} the heat, mass, and momentum transfer that occurs in upright corrugated steel storage structures due to conduction, diffusion, and natural convection. Periods of <b>aeration,</b> <b>dry</b> matter loss distribution, and maize weevil density in corn were estimated. Heat and mass balances were used to calculate the temperature and relative humidity in the headspace and plenum assuming permeable grain surfaces. Two seasons of pilot bin experiments validated the model. The average standard error between the experimental and predicted temperatures was 2. 4 °C (1. 8 to 3. 1 °C range) and the moisture content was 1. 0 percentage point. Non-aerated, automatic ambient aeration, and automatic chilled aeration were evaluated in the replicated pilot bins as alternative methods to control insect development during summer storage. Ambient and chilled aeration reduced development of red flour beetles and maize weevils by 34 % and 70 % over non-aerated storage, respectively. Two locations were investigated (Indianapolis, IN and Minneapolis, MN) to demonstrate the application of the model to control insects in conventionally sized steel bins that were cooled during the fall and winter. The non-aerated and ambient aerated strategies behaved similarly until late summer when the maize weevil density increased dramatically in the non-aerated bins. Chilled aeration controlled maize weevil density at its initial population, but at an energy consumption of fourteen to sixteen times greater than ambient aeration. The simulation results indicated that automatic aeration increased the average bin temperature relative to non-aerated storage, which negated most of the benefits observed in the pilot bins. An optimal scenario includes ambient aeration during the fall, winter, and early spring with non-aerated storage during the summer. Moisture “migration” in the traditional sense did not occur in a cooled grain mass stored into the summer. Instead a more realistic theory of moisture exchange between the grain mass and headspace and plenum was developed. Permeability had a major influence on the magnitude of moisture accumulation. Moisture accumulation occurred primarily due to natural convection currents that entered and exited the headspace, which can be minimized by proper ventilation. ...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the serious}} {{environmental}} problems that the human beings are facing is the nitrogenous pollution. It comes along with the perturbed nitrogen cycle in the nature and is mostly caused by human activities. NH 4 +, NO 2 –-N, and NO 3 [...] N are three major nitrogenous pollutants widely seen in the environment and known by most people. They are also the target compounds this thesis primarily focuses on. ^ Traditional nitrogen removal techniques apply the nitrification process to biodegrade NH 4 +, but accumulate NO 3 [...] N in the treated body. The alternating-aerobic-anoxic process combines both nitrification and denitrification in one system. Therefore, it can not only remove NH 4 + by nitrification but also eliminate NO 3 [...] N by denitrification. NO 2 [...] N exists in the system as an intermediate product of both nitrification and denitrification. The AAA process also shows the capability of removing TOC, which is oxidized under the aerobic condition and consumed by heterotrophs in the anoxic stage. If the organic carbon source is directly obtained from the existing waste stream, costs on adding external carbon will be saved. Successfully applying the biological fluidized bed reactor to the AAA process is proved in this thesis. Its advantages include saving space, eliminating sludge problems, and removing carbon and nitrogen efficiently. ^ Due to the <b>alternating</b> <b>aeration,</b> the aeration/non-aeration ratio {{is one of the}} important factors affecting the performance of the AAA process. For free NH 4 + and easily biodegradable carbon (e. g. glucose), the optimal aeration/non-aeration ratio is within a close range around 1. For a complex aromatic amine (e. g. aniline), due to its low denitrification rate, the non-aeration duration should be correspondingly increased and this makes the aeration/non-aeration ratio less than 1. Accumulation of the organic carbon in the anoxic stage is the distinguished result of a longer non-aeration process when dealing with slowly biodegradable organic compounds. ^ Applying the results of this thesis to the design of the AAA process for the joint aquacultural project between the University of Pennsylvania and the Delaware River Port Authority of Pennsylvania and New Jersey is expected in the near future. The success of the AAA process in removing aniline claims its potential application to removing toxic nitrogen containing organic compounds. ...|$|R

40|$|Samples of Various {{industrial}} or {{pilot plant}} spray-dried materials {{were obtained from}} manufacturers together with details of drying conditions and feed concentrations. The samples were subjected to qualitative and semi-quantitative examination to identify structural and morphological features. The results were related to measured bulk physical properties and to drying conditions. Single particles were produced in a convective drying process Analogous to spray drying, in which different solids or mixtures of solids were dried from solutions, slurries or pastes as single suspended droplets. The localized chemical and physical structures were analysed {{and in some cases}} the retention of volatiles monitored. The results were related to experimental conditions, viz.; air temperature, initial solids concentration and the degree of feed aeration. Three distinct categories of particle morphology were identified, i. e.; crystalline, skin-forming and agglomerate. Each category is evidence of a characteristic drying behaviour which is dependent on initial solids concentration. the degree of feed <b>aeration,</b> and <b>drying</b> temperature. Powder flow ability, particle and bulk density, particle-size, particle friability, and the retention of volatiles bear a direct relationship to morphological structure. Morphologies of multicomponent mixtures were complex, but the respective migration rates of the solutes were dependent on drying temperature. Gas-film heat and SDSS transfer coefficients of single pure liquid droplets were also measured over a temperature range of 50 •C to 200 •C under forced convection. Balanced transfer rates were obtained attributed to droplet instability or oscillation within the airflow, demonstrated in associated work with single free-flight droplets. The results are of relevance to drier optimisation and to the optimisation of product characteristics, e. g.; particle strength and essential volatiles-retention, in convective drying...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} assess the {{temporal}} variability of the conditions for the microbial oxidation of methane in landfill cover soils and their driving variables, gas composition at non-emissive and strongly emissive locations (hotspots) was monitored on a seasonal, daily and hourly time scale on an old, unlined landfill in northern Germany. Our study showed {{that the impact of}} the various environmental factors varied with the mode of gas transport and with the time scale considered. At non-emissive sites, governed by diffusive gas transport, soil gas composition was subject to a pronounced seasonal variation. A high extent of aeration, low methane concentrations and a high ratio of CO(2) to CH(4) were found across the entire depth of the soil cover during the warm and dry period, whereas in the cool and moist period aeration was less and landfill gas migrated further upward. Statistically, variation in soil gas composition was best explained by the variation in soil temperature. At locations dominated by advective gas transport and showing considerable emissions of methane, this pattern was far less pronounced with only little increase in the extent of <b>aeration</b> during <b>drier</b> periods. Here, the change of barometric pressure was found to impact soil gas composition. On a daily scale under constant conditions of temperature, gas transport at both types of locations was strongly impacted by the change in soil moisture. On an hourly scale, under constant conditions of temperature and moisture, gas migration was impacted most by the change in barometric pressure. It was shown that at diffusion-dominated sites complete methane oxidation was achieved even under adverse wintry conditions, whereas at hotspots, even under favorable dry and warm conditions, aerobic biological activity can be limited to the upper crust of the soil.

40|$|Despite recent {{developments}} in fixed-film combined biological nutrients removal (BNR) technology; fixed-film systems (i. e., biofilters), are still at {{the early stages of}} development and their application has been limited to a few laboratory-scale experiments. Achieving enhanced biological phosphorus removal in fixed-film systems requires exposing the micro-organisms and the waste stream to alternating anaerobic/aerobic or anaerobic/anoxic conditions in cycles. The concept of cycle duration (CD) as a process control parameter is unique to fixed-film BNR systems, has not been previously investigated, and can be used to optimise the performance of such systems. The CD refers to the elapsed time before the biomass is re-exposed to the same environmental conditions in cycles. Fixed-film systems offer many advantages over suspended growth systems such as reduced operating costs, simplicity of operation, absence of sludge recycling problems, and compactness. The control of nutrient discharges to water bodies, improves water quality, fish production, and allow water reuse. The main objective {{of this study was to}} develop a fundamental understanding of the effect of CD on the transformations of nutrients in fixed-film biofilter systems subjected to <b>alternating</b> <b>aeration</b> I no-aeration cycles A fixed-film biofilter system consisting of three up-flow biofilters connected in series was developed and tested. The first and third biofilters were operated in a cyclic mode in which the biomass was subjected to aeration/no-aeration cycles. The influent wastewater was simulated aquaculture whose composition was based on actual water quality parameters of aquacuture wastewater from a prawn grow-out facility. The influent contained 8. 5 - 9 : 3 mg!L a 111 monia-N, 8. 5 - 8. 7 mg/L phosphate-P, and 45 - 50 mg!L acetate. Two independent studies were conducted at two biofiltration rates to evaluate and confirm the effect of CD on nutrient transformations in the biofilter system for application in aquaculture: A third study was conducted to enhance denitrification in the system using an external carbon- source at a rate varying from 0 - 24 ml/min. The CD was varied in the range of 0. 25 - 120 hours for the first two studies and fixed at 12 hours for the third study. This study identified the CD as an important process control parameter that can be used to optimise the performance of full-scale fixed-film systems for BNR which represents a novel contribution in this field of research. The CD resulted in environmental conditions that inhibited or enhanced nutrient transformations. The effect of CD on BNR in fixed-film systems in terms of phosphorus biomass saturation and depletion has been established. Short CDs did not permit the establishment of anaerobic activity in the un-aerated biofilter and, thus, inhibited phosphorus release. Long CDs resulted in extended anaerobic activity and, thus, resulted in active phosphorus release. Long CDs, however, resulted in depleting the biomass phosphorus reservoir in the releasing biofilter and saturating the biomass phosphorus reservoir in the up-taking biofilter in the cycle. This phosphorus biomass saturation/depletion phenomenon imposes a practical limit on how short or long the CD can be. The length of the CD should be somewhere just before saturation or depletion occur and for the system tested, the optimal CD was 12 hours for the biofiltration rates tested. The system achieved limited net phosphorus removal due to the limited sludge wasting and lack of external carbon supply during phosphorus uptake. The phosphorus saturation and depletion reflected the need to extract phosphorus from the phosphorus-rich micro-organisms, for example, through back-washing. The major challenges of achieving phosphorus removal in the system included: (I) overcoming the deterioration in the performance of the system during the transition period following the start of each new cycle; and (2) wasting excess phosphorus-saturated biomass following the aeration cycle. Denitrification occurred in poorly aerated sections of the third biofilter and generally declined as the CD increased and as the time progressed in the individual cycle. Denitrification and phosphorus uptake were supplied by an internal organic carbon source, and the addition of an external carbon source (acetate) to the third biofilter resulted in improved denitrification efficiency in the system from 18. 4 without supplemental carbon to 88. 7...|$|R

Comparative analysis of the coupled nitrification-denitrification reactions was carried out to investigate the two different alternating aerobic-anoxic processes of 3 -h aerobic digestion and 6 -h anoxic time and 3 -h aerobic digestion and 3 -h anoxic time.

40|$|Extra virgin {{avocado oil}} (EVAO) is {{extracted}} from avocado fruit with minimal processing. It contains {{a wide range}} of non-lipid compounds that have a profound affect on oil stability. The deterioration of oil quality is due to autoxidation and photooxidation reactions that occur during oil storage. The objectives of this research were to determine the effect of prooxidant factors (light, temperature, oxygen level) on oil oxidation and quality; make recommendations for oil processing and packaging procedures to minimise oxidation; predict the shelf life of the oil and to determine the effect of commercial antioxidants on oil oxidation. An accelerated oxidation reactor was developed to test the effects of fluorescent light, elevated temperature and varying oxygen levels on the peroxide value (PV) (initially 0. 96 ± 0. 03 meq/kg oil) and chlorophyll content (initially 16. 2 ± 0. 1 ppm) of EVAO. The production and packaging processes of Olivado NZ. were analysed for exposure to oxidation promoting factors. EVAO was exposed to dark storage at 50 °C and 60 °C in order to determine Q 10 values for oil oxidation. Several commercial antioxidants were evaluated by examining their affect on EVAO using the Rancimat oil stability index analysis and hot air oven testing. It was found that fluorescent light at 4500 lux and <b>aeration</b> with <b>dry</b> air strongly accelerated the oxidation (determined by PV) and reduced the chlorophyll content of EVAO. The average effect of 4500 lux fluorescent light compared to 0 lux over seven hours was a PV increase of 4. 5 ± 1. 4 meq/kg oil and decrease in chlorophyll content by 0. 9 ± 0. 3 ppm. The average effect of aerated EVAO compared to EVAO stored at ambient oxygen levels over seven hours was a PV increase of 3. 5 ± 1. 7 meq/kg oil and a chlorophyll content decrease of 0. 3 ± 0. 2 ppm. Exposure to an elevated temperature of 60 °C for seven hours did not cause a significant increase in PV. Recommendations were made to minimise the exposure of the oil to light, aeration, water and fruit sediment during production and packaging in order to minimise oxidation of the oil. Due to the breakdown of natural antioxidants and alternative side reactions that occurred at elevated test temperatures but not at ambient temperatures, the shelf life of the oil could not be defined. EVAO containing ascorbyl palmitate at a level of 100 ppm had a peroxide value 80 % less than control EVAO with no antioxidants after 500 hours storage at 60 °C. Ascorbyl palmitate has GRAS status and was concluded to be the most effective antioxidant of those tested in EVAO...|$|R

The studies demonstrate {{that there is a}} gradual process of an increase of the number of components, which virtually exclude the significance of positive results of self-purification by natural way, in water mass of transformed riverine systems. Spontaneous fluctuation of water level, which is caused by volumes of daily discharges, often instantly changes water levels on spawning areas.

Ecological situation of transformed hydroecosystems demonstrates coupling of negative effect of hydrological regime autostaticity in time and space, deterioration of water chemical composition. There is a permanent trend of saturation of water with components, which are not natural that results in doubtfulness of effective reproduction puts in question the possibility of stable state of valuable commercial fish stocks. At the same time, transformed water areas of riverine hydroecosystems have high bioproductive potential, which having its own food resource, is ineffectively transformed into food base for valuable commercial fish species. Against the background of noted changes, the considered water areas lost their suitability of providing effective reproduction. As a consequence, primary valuable fish species form low-yield generations and this is reflected on qualitative indices of commercial fishing.

40|$|AbstractThe {{problems}} of water quality {{are related to}} the decrease in the dissolved oxygen content, particularly in the lower layers. These lower layers may deteriorate significantly if the dissolved oxygen consummated in biochemical processes is not renewed by surface aeration or photosynthesis. Thermal stratification of lakes and reservoirs can result in substantial hypolimnetic oxygen depletion, which may {{have a negative impact on}} the cold-water fisheries, the drinking- water treatment process, and water quality downstream of hydropower reservoirs. The main purpose of this study is to show the effect of hypolimetic aeration and destratification mode to improve the concentration of oxygen dissolved and level of phosphorus in the depths of the lake. The 10. 3 km 2 of the water of Hallwil lake are an important tourist center for the canton of Lucerne (Switzerland). Before its restoration in the winter of the year 1985 / 1986, this lake eutrophication showed significant disruption of aquatic activities, and pollution damage to its various uses, and thus inhibited the development of tourism in the region. Thus, the long periods of stratifications, associated to an important amount of an organic material (principally phosphorus), were originally caused by frequent anoxic phases of the deep layers. This anoxia could be noted beyond 3 m of depth. For this, the Swiss Federal Institute for Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag) in Switzerland, to address the eutrophication of Hallwil lake, put into service in the winter of 1985 / 1986, an installation of a aeration system in two <b>alternate</b> modes of <b>aeration</b> namely by a aeration system in winter by destratification mode and aeration hypolimnetic in summer (air / pure oxygen). Through the exhibition of the different results of the chemical parameters (dissolved oxygen, total phosphorus) in the two aeration modes, we were able to ensure an improvement of the lake water quality As a result, the average value of oxygen dissolved and the amount of phosphorus is found in the range of allowed values are: -Winter Season: [O 2]min ≥ 8 g/m 3; [P 2]max ≤ 0. 15 g/m 3 - Summer Season: (30 m ≥H ≥ 15 m) : [O 2]min ≥ 5 g/m 3; [P 2]max ≤ 0. 13 g/m 3 Consequently, we can conclude that both techniques aeration method has contributed radically in valuable way to improve the amount of dissolved oxygen and decrease the concentration of phosphorus in the deep layers of the lake...|$|R

L'alternance de phases aérées et anoxiques suivie d'une période de décantation conduit en théorie à l'élimination quasi totale des ions nitrate formés lors de la phase de nitrification aérobie. Cependant, selon la charge appliquée, le carbone totalement dégradé lors de la phase préliminaire d'aération ne peut servir de source de carbone pour la dénitrification exogène. Afin d'accélérer la dénitrification, plusieurs solutions sont possibles : l'une consiste à allonger la deuxième phase d'anoxie suffisamment longtemps pour traiter les ions nitrate résiduels au cours d'un processus de dénitrification endogène, l'autre à diminuer {{le temps}} de réaction aérobie tout en augmentant la fréquence des séquences aérobie/anoxie afin de conserver du carbone résiduel lors de la dénitrification. Une troisième solution réside dans l'ajout d'une source de carbone exogène suite à l'étape de nitrification de manière à permettre une assimilation plus rapide et plus efficace des ions nitrate formés (dénitrification exogène). L'article compare les résultats d'abattement sur le carbone et l'azote d'une eau usée urbaine en utilisant les trois types de fonctionnement. Il en résulte la définition d'une stratégie globale de contrôle du procédé, chacun des scénarii pouvant être privilégié en fonction de la qualité de l'effluent de départ et des contraintes de traitement. Wastewater treatment by a Sequencing Batch Reactor (SBR) provides an alternative solution to activated sludge treatment, by carrying out carbon treatment, liquid-solid separation and nutrient removal {{in a single}} tank, thanks to the appropriate management of the temporal reaction cycles. <b>Alternating</b> the <b>aeration</b> and anoxic phases, followed by a decantation period, leads, in theory, to the almost total removal of nitrate ions formed during the aerobic nitrification phase. However, depending on the applied load, the carbon that is totally degraded during the preliminary aeration phase, cannot {{be used as a}} source of carbon for exogenic denitrification. Several solutions are possible in order to accelerate denitrification: one consists of lengthening sufficiently the second anoxic phase to treat the residual nitrate ions during the endogenous denitrification process; another strategy involves reducing the aerobic reaction time, while increasing the frequency of aerobic/anoxic sequences in order to preserve residual carbon during denitrification. A third solution lies in the addition of a source of exogenic carbon after the nitrification stage, to allow a quicker and more efficient assimilation of the nitrate ions that are formed (exogenic denitrification). This article compares the results of reducing carbon and nitrogen in wastewater, using three types of operation. The cycle of reference has been established starting from previous bibliographical results (WUN JERN and DROSTE, 1989) and simulations using the model ASM 1 (HENZE et al., 1986). It consists of an anoxic feeding, followed by an anoxic phase, then an aerobic phase and another anoxic phase. The cycle ends by the settling and decanting phases. The lengths of these different phases are: 1 h, 0. 5 h, 4. 5 h, 3. 25 h, 1 h, 1 h. This reference cycle, carried out at the laboratory, leads to the elimination of 90 % of the Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), 95 % of the Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD 5) and more than 80 % of total nitrogen, i. e. with residual concentrations of 60 mg×L- 1 for the Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC), 5 mg×L- 1 for the Biological Oxygen Demand, and 10 mg×L- 1 for total nitrogen. These results are comparable with those in the literature (IRVINE et al., 1987, MELCER et al., 1987, YANG et al., 1999). The results obtained during the reference cycle enabled us to reach a rate of total nitrogen removal of 85 % and a global nitrogen concentration in the effluent of 11 mg×L- 1. Nitrification and denitrification rates yielded values of 0. 8 mg N-NH 4 +×gMVS- 1 ×h- 1 and 0. 8 mg N-NO 3 -×gMVS- 1 ×h- 1 respectively. Total nitrogen removal was not completely achieved {{because of the lack of}} available carbon. This lack of carbon favours endogenic denitrification, characterized by a slow denitrification rate 0. 8 mg N-NO 3 -×mgMVS- 1 ×h- 1, compared to exogenic denitrification characterized by a higher nitrogen reduction rate (about 2 mg N-NO 3 -×mgMVS- 1 ×h- 1). This fact was experimentally confirmed with carbon addition in the form of acetate at the beginning of the second anoxic phase. In this case, carbon addition significantly improves the denitrification rate compared to the same experiment without exogenic carbon addition: 2 mg N-NO 3 -×mgMVS- 1 ×h- 1 versus 0. 8 mg N-NO 3 -×mgMVS- 1 ×h- 1. However, this method raises operating costs for the process. In order to reach complete nitrogen removal without the addition of synthetic carbon, it is possible to increase the anoxic phase time scale from 3 hours to 15 hours. Although the results in term of carbon and nitrogen removal are satisfactory when the anoxia phase is lengthened, the concentration in the discharged effluent is 0. 33 mg total N×L- 1, and thus this technique decreases the productivity of the SBR. The feeding cycles of a biological reactor being variable, a regulation based on the use of the evolution of the pH, or the redox potential, can be considered (PAVELJ et al., 2001; ANDREOTTOLA et al., 2001). This regulation would make it possible to adapt the duration of the phases of anoxia to the necessary treatment. To overcome this drawback, a possible approach consists in replacing the aerobic / anoxic phase in the reference cycle by five aerobic / anoxic phases during the same time. Unfortunately, this method leads to a decrease in nitrogen removal and in the nitrification rate, compared to classical cycle (65 % versus 85 %, and 0. 4 mg N-NO 3 - ×mgMVS- 1 ×h- 1 versus 0. 8 mg N-NO 3 -×mgMVS- 1 ×h- 1, respectively). The nitrification rate is, in this case, half that obtained in the reference cycle, probably due to delays related to the induction of nitrification and denitrification. This strategy, consisting of increasing the aeration / no aeration frequency, has to be optimized in term of nitrification and denitrification ratios. A better solution from the economic and productivity points of view is the addition of wastewater at the beginning of anoxic phase. This strategy implies the modification of the cycle. First, after the anoxic feeding, an aerobic phase allows carbon and nitrogen oxidation. In order to supply an available carbon source for exogenic denitrifcation, a second feeding is introduced at the beginning of the second anoxic phase. This addition also contains ammonium ions and implies new nitrification and denitrification steps. This last denitrification phase is then endogenic. Carbon addition in the form of wastewater leads to an improvement in nitrogen removal. The exogenic denitrification rate is twice the value for endogenous denitrification for the same cycle of operation (1. 6 mg N-NO 3 -×gMVS- 1 ×h- 1 versus 0. 9 mg N-NO 3 -×gMVS- 1 ×h- 1 respectively). This strategy yields a final concentration of 3 mg N×L- 1 and the nitrification and denitrification rates are similar to those of the traditional processes. In conclusion, the addition of synthetic carbon in the form of acetate must be preserved as a means of acting quickly in the event of dysfunction (that can be detected by monitoring the redox potential or the pH), although this technique significantly increases the cost of operation. Although the best economic solution to improve denitrification is carbon addition in the form of wastewater, other strategies can be undertaken according to the goals of the treatment process. When the wastewater load is sufficiently weak (night period), the endogenous phase of denitrification can be lengthened. In the event of an important load, carbon addition (in synthetic form or as waste water) makes it possible to eliminate the nitrate ions exogenically...|$|R
