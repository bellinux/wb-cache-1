500|$|In {{the same}} interview, Sapochnik was also asked {{about how he}} went about {{creating}} a sense of emotion in the 'King in the North' scene, saying [...] "It wasn't hard. I think as fans we'd been waiting for it for so long. That said, {{it was a very}} difficult scene to shoot. Mainly because it was unusually hot over the two days we shot it, everyone was wearing heavy furs and armor, Kit was <b>actually</b> <b>pretty</b> ill and everyone was crammed into this space full of plates of sheep's tongues and chicken carcasses so it got quite smelly and sticky. It's also quite a long scene and yet Bella did it probably more than a hundred times, only forgetting a line once in the entire time. When we finished the scene she got a standing ovation from all the cast and crew." ...|$|E
500|$|Michael Cragg of The Guardian {{wrote that}} it is [...] "a ridiculous {{collection}} of sound effects (police sirens, gunshots) and imposing menace that's <b>actually</b> <b>pretty</b> fun {{in a kind of}} slightly unhinged way." [...] Neil McCormick of The Telegraph wrote that the song is [...] "a solid techno groove and one of the album's odder and most interesting tracks." [...] Stern commented that the song [...] "is not only the highlight of the record, but a highlight of Madonna's career." [...] Matthew Perpetua of Pitchfork Media wrote that [...] "it's the album's boldest, most experimental track, and it's marred only by a just-off vocal performance that renders her very familiar voice a bit anonymous, and a halfhearted attempt at a dub-step bass drop." [...] Nick Levine of BBC Music called it [...] "a preposterous piece of pop schlock." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{one song}} {{that did not}} come from the musical was [...] "Uptown Girl". Votta said the {{performance}} by the Dalton Academy Warblers, with [...] "leads by minor Warbler Nick, played by Curt Mega", was [...] "refreshing and nostalgic all at once, a bright pop musical spot in an episode devoted to Broadway and a reminder of the dominant Dalton presence last season". Bell wrote that the [...] "Warblers were totally born to sing 'Uptown Girl, and Goldberg called it [...] "among the young season’s best" [...] performances. Flandez said it was a [...] "terrific performance", though Benigno was more restrained, and gave it a [...] "B+" [...] despite there being [...] "less innovation" [...] in the a cappella [...] "gimmick", and noted that [...] "the barbershop-quartet finish is <b>actually</b> <b>pretty</b> good". Slezak, however, said the song was the only musical [...] "weak link" [...] in the episode, and Canning called it [...] "too polished". Futterman thought the lead singers were [...] "grating and over-the-top", and Poniewozik characterized the performance as [...] "unfortunate".|$|E
500|$|Sir Lucious Left Foot: The Son of Chico Dusty {{received}} {{rave reviews}} from contemporary music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 90, which indicates [...] "universal acclaim", based on 33 reviews. AllMusic editor Andy Kellman called it [...] "one of the loosest, most varied, and entertaining albums of its time". Entertainment Weeklys Simon Vozick-Levinson called the album [...] "a stunningly realized solo debut". Alexis Petridis of The Guardian praised its [...] "kaleidoscopic range of musical influences" [...] and Big Boi's lyrics. Rob Harvilla of The Village Voice called it [...] "fantastic, by turns triumphant, defiant, and gleefully crass [...] it feels triumphant and relieved and epic {{even if you}} discount the tortured backstory". Seth Colter Walls of Newsweek stated [...] "Big Boi makes the contemporary trappings of hip-hop sound funkier than just about anyone". Adam Downer of Sputnikmusic called it [...] "a brilliant record" [...] and commented that [...] "the beats are killer, the verses sick, the pacing perfect, and the skits are <b>actually</b> <b>pretty</b> funny".|$|E
500|$|Discussing the {{workplace}} flirtation between Will and Emma, Gilsig deemed Terri [...] "a woman of conviction", {{willing to do}} [...] "whatever it takes" [...] to keep Will from leaving her, [...] "even if that means finding this woman and hunting her down". She explained that Will and Terri's communication is weak and that Terri is [...] "missing {{a lot of the}} skills for the marriage", and commented that Terri feels threatened by Will's commitment to the glee club, worried that it will pull him away from her. Gilsig characterized Terri as emotionally still being in high school, and explained: [...] "I think Terri still lives in that world, where I can move the pieces in such a way to create a picture, and that will make it real. I don't think she's learned that you can actually just have open conversations and talk about your fears and ask for your needs to be met in a direct, compassionate way. I think she's still in high school and thinking whatever you do, just don't let anybody know that you don't know what you're doing." [...] Discussing Terri's relationship with her sister Kendra, Gilsig commented: [...] "When Kendra tells Terri to do something, Terri does it. As crazy as Terri might be, she's <b>actually</b> <b>pretty</b> normal in the face of her sister. This [...] is Kendra's brainchild, and she just trusts her implicitly." ...|$|E

5000|$|Ritter {{went on to}} say, [...] "Thankfully manager pushed us to our wits' end, {{because the}} last two songs we wrote for our second record were 'Move Along' and 'It Ends Tonight', which were both top ten hits.

[...] He said that Buckley [...] "delivered a charming performance {{in what was}} effectively a supporting role.

Andrew Billen from The Times described Bright's portrayal of Joan as [...] "winsome", said Lyndhurst [...] "produced a detailed performance" [...] and that [...] "Rock & Chips was better than the sequel that preceded it." [...] Keith Watson in the Metro also praised the performances of Buckley and Bright, saying [...] "They deserved a show all to themselves." [...] Although he found the period detail [...] "squeaky clean" [...] and [...] "unconvincing", he closed his review by saying: [...] "Somehow it made me care about the Trotters in a way decades of Only Fools and Horses never came close to." ...|$|E
500|$|Before 20th Century Fox gave Alien vs. Predator the greenlight, Aliens writer/{{director}} James Cameron {{had been}} working on a story for a fifth Alien film. Alien director Ridley Scott had talked with Cameron, stating [...] "I {{think it would be a}} lot of fun, but the most important thing is to get the story right." [...] In a 2002 interview, Scott's concept for a story was [...] "to go back to where the alien creatures were first found and explain how they were created"; this project eventually became Scott's film Prometheus (2012). On learning that Fox intended to pursue Alien vs. Predator, Cameron believed the film would [...] "kill the validity of the franchise" [...] and ceased work on his story, [...] "To me, that was Frankenstein Meets Werewolf. It was Universal just taking their assets and starting to play them off against each other...Milking it." [...] After viewing Alien vs. Predator, however, Cameron remarked that [...] "it was <b>actually</b> <b>pretty</b> good. I think of the five Alien films, I'd rate it third. I actually liked it. I actually liked it a lot." [...] Conversely, Ridley Scott had no interest in the Alien vs. Predator films. When asked in May 2012 if he had watched them, Scott laughed, [...] "No. I couldn't do that. I couldn't quite take that step." [...] Director Neill Blomkamp would eventually go on to pitch his sequel to Aliens.|$|E

The Guardian writer Jordan Hoffman gave the film two stars, writing that [...] "it is bad, but it isn't THAT bad", and said: [...] "for a would-be cult [...] classic, this could have been much more". Robert Abele of the Los Angeles Times was {{critical}} of [...] The Boy Next Door, calling it [...] "breathless, uninspired (...) junk that feels like the iffiest bits of a Lifetime movie and late-night cable schlock slapped together", calling Guzman's character boring. Entertainment Weeklys Leah Greenblatt similarly wrote that the film was a [...] "few deliciously bonkers bons mots dot the Lifetime-grade dialogue", while calling its script [...] "too timid to fully dive into the high camp it hints at". Despite negative reviews, Lopez has received praise. Richard Lawson from Vanity Fair wrote: [...] "Given the material, Lopez is <b>actually</b> <b>pretty</b> darn good in [...] the movie, taking it seriously enough that it's not irksomely arch camp, but also plenty aware that she's not doing Shakespeare. She's a joy to watch throughout." [...] Claudia Puig from USA Today stated that the movie was an improvement on her previous romantic comedies, calling Lopez [...] "believably powerful in moments of physical conflict".|$|E

[...] Chloe is a [...] "bitchy" [...] stylist who is hired at Jabot Cosmetics as a fashion consultant. Explaining her initial portrayal of Chloe, Hendrickson stated, [...] "I {{was the one who}} wanted to make her edgy and funny. Most of the people I know who are in the fashion business are a little bitchy. I wanted to make Chloe interesting, instead of just playing her like some girl who was putting on fancy clothes. There was no conflict there. The writers definitely gave me that in the writing, and I tweaked it a little. They seemed to enjoy it. Each day, Chloe kept getting funnier and bitchier." [...] She first works with young model Lily Winters (Christel Khalil), the new face of Jabot whom she treats harshly. According to Hendrickson, Chloe [...] "takes her job very seriously. [...] is used to working with more professional models and is very hard on Lily regarding, you know, keeping up some sort of appearance if you will, regarding the fashion industry, which is weight. So [...] starts to give [...] a little weight complex because she is constantly throwing in her face that either she doesn't fit into things or they have to make things larger for her, etc." ...|$|E

If you're about to talk about rape as anything other than a brutal and horrible crime, stop". Anti-abortion groups, such as the Susan B.

[...] Paste Magazine said the album, [...] "after a few listens, is <b>actually</b> <b>pretty</b> {{good if you}} forgive the total banality of its content.

Ailie's heart leapt with an emotion of tender delight as she observed that the baby monkey's face was white and sweet-looking; yes, we might even go the length of saying that, for a monkey, it was <b>actually</b> <b>pretty.</b> But it had a subdued, sorrowful look that was really touching to behold. It seemed as though that infantine monkey had, in the course of its brief career, been subjected to every species of affliction, to every imaginable kind of heart-crushing sorrow, and had remained deeply meek and humble under it all. Only for one brief instant did a different expression cross its melancholy face. That was when it first caught sight of the canoe. Then it exposed its very small teeth and gums after the fashion of its mother; but repentance seemed to follow instantly, for the sad look, mixed with a dash of timidity, resumed its place, and it buried its face in its mother's bosom.|$|E
