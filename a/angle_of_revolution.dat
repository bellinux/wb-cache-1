This usage is generally discouraged, since it can lead to confusion as to whether a given quantity expressed in newton metres is a torque or a quantity of energy.

Though {{often referred to as}} "Cartesian grid" methods, they are equally well-suited to axisymmetric problems. This paper describes a formulation of the discrete ordinates method for radiative transfer calculations with embedded boundaries. The method uses diamond-difference stencils in the interior with a conservative extension to boundary cells based on a volume-of-fluid approach.

In the FBEM formulation for acoustics, some integrals over the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>revolution</b> arise, which need to be calculated for every Fourier term. These integrals were formerly treated for each Fourier term separately. In this paper a new method is proposed to calculate these integrals using fast Fourier transform techniques. The advantage of this integration method is that the integrals are simultaneously computed for all Fourier terms in the boundary element formulation. The improved efficiency of the method compared to a Gaussian quadrature based integration algorithm is illustrated by some example calculations.

The stability lobes for constant spindle speeds are calculated exactly. By using the approximate perturbation analysis, the gain in stability is calculated for variable spindle speeds.
