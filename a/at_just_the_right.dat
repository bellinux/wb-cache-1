This procedure also increased Banner's mental capacity, which gave him the intelligence to tweak the Extremis virus within him and unleash a new persona for the Hulk: the super-intelligent Doc Green.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} one cord (called the {{retention}} cord) a finger-loop is formed. At the end of the other cord (the release cord,) it is a common practice to form a knot or a tab. The release cord will be held between finger and thumb to be released <b>at</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> moment, and may have a complex braid to add bulk to the end. This makes the knot easier to hold, and the extra weight allows the loose end of a discharged sling to be recovered with a flick of the wrist.|$|E

25|$|Socrates {{praises the}} Spartans {{as the best}} {{people in the world}} not only because of their fierceness in battle but because of their wisdom and {{philosophical}} skills. This is contrary to the common belief that the Spartans lacked in these issues and devoted themselves exclusively to physical training but Socrates claims that they are masters at concealing their skills. While they appear to be unimpressive speakers, <b>at</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> moment, they can provide pithy phrases of wisdom (342e). He adds that Laconic brevity was the earliest characteristic of philosophy (343b).|$|E
25|$|In June 2013, Gleeson {{made his}} {{comeback}} to basketball after signing a three-year deal {{to be the}} Head Coach of the Perth Wildcats – the NBL's most successful franchise with five championships. In the months prior to joining the Wildcats, Gleeson was inches from turning his back on basketball for good. Feeling refreshed after his AFL stint, but unsure of his coaching future long-term, the chance to join the Wildcats in 2013 came <b>at</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> time. Gleeson took over from coach Rob Beveridge, who had developed a winning-culture at the Wildcats (one championship and three grand finals in four years) behind a core group consisting of Shawn Redhage, Damian Martin, Jesse Wagstaff, Matthew Knight and Greg Hire.|$|E
25|$|In {{ammunition}} manufacture, swaged bullets are bullets {{manufactured by}} compressing metal {{at room temperature}} into a die to form it {{into the shape of}} a bullet. The other common manufacturing method is casting, which uses molten metals poured into a mold. Since metals expand when heated and contract when cooled, cast bullets must be cast with a mold slightly larger than the desired finish size, so that as the molten metal cools, it will harden <b>at</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> point to shrink to the desired size. In contrast, swaged bullets, since they are formed at the temperature at which they will be used, can be formed in molds of the exact desired size. This means that swaged bullets are generally more precise than cast bullets. The swaging process also leads to fewer imperfections, since voids commonly found in casting would be pressed out in the swaging process. The swaging process in reference to cold flow of metals into bullets is the process not of squeezing the metals into smaller forms but rather pressing smaller thinner items to form into shorter and slightly wider shapes.|$|E

25|$|Australia dug {{themselves}} out of the hole, however, Michael Clarke and Michael Hussey slowly accumulating to increase the rate. England clearly lacked a fifth bowler, opting instead for Vikram Solanki to bat down the order, so they used a combination of Michael Vaughan, Solanki and Collingwood to get through their ten required overs. That let Australia off the hook, with Clarke and Hussey adding 105, before Jon Lewis – who had been taken to the cleaners earlier on – dug out Michael Clarke with an inside edge onto the stumps, taking the fifth wicket of the game <b>at</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> time. Shane Watson accumulated well with Hussey, however, hitting six an over as Lewis was smashed about again, but Harmison got his revenge by completing his first five-wicket haul in ODIs as Hussey was beaten by a slower ball – the first time Hussey had been dismissed in One Day Internationals, for a batting average of 229. Then, Andrew Flintoff was brought back, getting a splendid yorker in for Watson, who was out for 25 just as the Aussies were preparing to hit out – the score 220 for 7 after 44.1 overs. Jason Gillespie and Brad Hogg survived a couple of overs from Flintoff and Harmison – meaning that Harmison finished with five for 33 off ten overs. Towards the end, Australia built up again, before losing Gillespie to a top edge, but 244 for 8 with seven balls remaining still looked difficult for England to chase. Gough dug out Michael Kasprowicz with a yorker with two balls to spare, and four legbyes ended the innings to take Australia to 252 for 9.|$|E

Rock and dance music had been dominating the airwaves and charts {{for quite some time}} by that point.

500|$|Voormann, a {{close friend}} of Harrison's since 1960, found the {{atmosphere}} at the sessions unpleasant; he later cited the heavy drug use typical of the LA music scene, in particular, but also the ex-Beatle's [...] "frame of mind when he was doing this album". Keltner, who described his own friendship with Harrison as [...] "like brothers", has similarly spoken of Los Angeles as an unsuitable environment for Harrison during this period, while commenting that Arias [...] "came into the picture <b>at</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> time, a crazy, dark time". With Voormann choosing to absent himself, Harrison played some of the album's bass parts himself, using either ARP or Moog synthesizer.|$|E
500|$|All Saladin's {{best efforts}} could not {{dislocate}} the Crusader column, or halt its {{advance in the}} direction of Arsuf. [...] Richard was determined to hold his army together, forcing the enemy to exhaust themselves in repeated charges, with the intention of holding his knights for a concentrated counter-attack <b>at</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> moment. [...] There were risks in this, because the army was not only marching under severe enemy provocation, but the troops were suffering from heat and thirst. [...] Just as serious, the Saracens were killing so many horses that some of Richard's own knights began to wonder if a counter-strike would be possible.

500|$|The British relegated the Malays {{to their}} [...] "traditional" [...] peasant {{lifestyle}} {{as far as}} possible, restricting movement, economic enterprises and education. This policy was maintained {{in the belief that}} education of Bengalis in India had led to discontent and rebellion. They involved only the Malay ruling class in government and administrative issues. Despite the exclusion of non-Malays from positions of ostensible authority, much of the civil service rank and file comprised non-Malays, many of them Indians who were specifically brought in for this purpose. A number of historians have described the pro-Malay policies as designed merely to preserve the position of the British, rather than to strengthen that of the Malays; many characterised the British approach as one of [...] "divide and rule", keeping [...] "the races <b>at</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> distance from each other to have the disparate elements of Malaya work in remote harmony".|$|E

500|$|Van Duyn praised Metroid II visual detail, {{writing that}} the foregrounds and the enemies are {{detailed}} so players can identify them easily. Weiss {{noticed that the}} game's backgrounds were more detailed. Jones considered the graphics average, and noted that the walls appeared mostly the same, which confuses players when wandering through identical tunnels. Parish complained that aside from Samus, the visuals for the environment are [...] "bland and repetitive, full of monotonous rocks and sand with few details to differentiate the various areas, and the enemies are mostly simple and boxy." [...] Parish also found the music [...] "downright painful", which he contrasted with the [...] "moody, atmospheric compositions" [...] the series was known for. Van Duyn similarly commented that the music is the only negative point in the game, {{and said that the}} ambient sounds tend to get annoying after hearing them frequently. In contrast, Jones highlighted the music positively, stating that [...] "the lack of aesthetic detail boosts the game's distinctive atmosphere no end, the music playing <b>at</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> times." [...] Jones was also pleased with its sound effects.|$|E
500|$|Maurice Tan of Destructoid {{highlighted}} the pacing and combat intensity, which requires players {{to pay attention}} to the flow of the battle more than usual. Kevin VanOrd of GameSpot stated similar pros, especially during the second portion of the mission. According to him, [...] "enemies attack <b>at</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> pace, so individual battles never drag on too long, nor are they over so quickly that they end up being unsatisfying." [...] He also {{highlighted the}} vehicle chase scene, comparing it favorably to Blade Runner and The Fifth Element, but criticize the controls in the Xbox 360 version for not being very precise. The bosses received similar praise, with Steimer stating that both of them [...] "have unique traits that make them a formidable opponent." [...] The Shadow Broker's base was highlighted as a valuable addition to the game. Whitehead noted that marking mineral-rich planets alleviates the scanning, which was seen as a tedious feature in the main game. VanOrd concluded that [...] "Lair of the Shadow Broker" [...] is [...] "worthy of your time (more than two hours) and your money." [...] The pack was nominated for Best DLC (downloadable content) at the 2010 Spike Video Game Awards, but lost to [...] It won the Inside Gaming Award for Best DLC.|$|E
500|$|Rick Porter of Zap2it said Parks {{was at the}} [...] "top of its game". Porter praised {{that the}} final scenes {{presented}} so many changes for the characters but never felt out of control, which he attributed to [...] "the cast's ability to play things <b>at</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> level and the writers for knowing just how cartoonish Pawnee can be without tipping too far". New York magazine writer Steve Kandell said although the episode felt like a [...] "somber affair" [...] and less momentous than the previous episode [...] "Harvest Festival", he said the cliffhangers were suspenseful and on par with major drama shows like the ABC series Desperate Housewives. Nick McHatton of TV Fanatic praised the episode, and said he found particularly hilarious the scene about Leslie and Ben accidentally pocket dialing Ron during their sexual roleplaying. However, McHatton {{said he did not}} believe Tom's decision to start an entertainment company had [...] "much of a traction past the first five minutes of next season". Joel Keller of TV Squad felt the major changes the characters undergo {{at the end of the}} episode felt [...] "rushed", but admitted they were [...] "natural outcropping of the characters and what we've seen of them this year".|$|E
