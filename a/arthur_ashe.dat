5|$|Ryan White {{was one of}} {{a handful}} of highly visible people with AIDS in the 1980s and early 1990s who helped change the public {{perception}} of the disease. Ryan, along with actor Rock Hudson, was one of the earliest public faces of AIDS. Along with later public figures who became associated with HIV/AIDS, such as the Ray brothers, Magic Johnson, <b>Arthur</b> <b>Ashe,</b> The Brady Bunch's Robert Reed, Tim Richmond, Elizabeth Glaser, Liberace, Freddie Mercury and Charlie Sheen, Ryan White helped to increase public awareness that HIV/AIDS was a significant epidemic.|$|E
5|$|Before Ryan White, AIDS was {{a disease}} stigmatized as an illness {{impacting}} the gay community, {{because it was}} first diagnosed among gay men. That perception shifted as Ryan and other prominent HIV-infected people such as Magic Johnson, <b>Arthur</b> <b>Ashe</b> and the Ray brothers appeared in the media to advocate for more AIDS research and public education to address the epidemic. The U.S. Congress passed a major piece of AIDS legislation, the Ryan White CARE Act, shortly after White's death. The Act has been reauthorized twice; Ryan White Programs are the largest provider of services for people living with HIV/AIDS in the United States.|$|E

40|$|Student Number : 9305365 T - MEd {{research}} report - School of Education - Faculty of HumanitiesPrevious {{studies have examined}} the issue of assessing university students and relating their performance on the assessment measures to their academic performance in South Africa (Butler & Van Dyk, 2004; Nel, Dreyer, & Kopper, 2004). Nel et al (2004) used a comprehensive assessment battery whereas Butler and Van Dyk (2004) used a single test, the ELSA-PLUS. However, there is very little research on the relationship between reading and academic performance (Onwuebuzie, Mayes, <b>Arthur,</b> Johnson, Robinson, <b>Ashe,</b> Elbedous & Collins, 2004). The Stanford Diagnostic Reading Test (SDRT) Blue Level was administered to 380 first year students in the one of the schools in an English medium university in South Africa at the beginning of 2005. 67 students volunteered to have their results used in the study of which 22 were English second language (L 2) speakers and 43 were English first language (L 1) speakers. The results showed that there were significant differences between the L 1 and L 2 students, where the performance of the L 2 students was significantly weaker than that of the L 1 students on the Reading Comprehension, Vocabulary, Word Parts and Structural Analysis subtests of the SDRT. However, it emerged that the SDRT is not a good predictive test for academic achievement for either L 1 or L 2 students...|$|R
