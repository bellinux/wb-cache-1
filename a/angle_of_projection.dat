50|$|Plastic {{surgeons}} categorize ptosis by {{evaluating the}} position of the nipple relative to the inframammary crease (where the underside of the breast meets the chest wall). This is determined by measuring {{from the center of the}} nipple to the sternal notch (at the top of the breast bone) to gauge how far the nipple has fallen. The standard anthropometric measurement for young women is 21 cm. This measurement is used to assess both breast ptosis and breast symmetry. The surgeon will assess the breast's <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>projection.</b> The apex of the breast, which includes the nipple, can have a flat <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>projection</b> (180 degrees) or acute <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>projection</b> (greater than 180 degrees). The apex rarely has an angle greater than 60 degrees. The angle of the breast apex is partly determined by the tautness of the suspensory Cooper's ligaments. For example, when a woman lies on her back, the angle of the breast apex becomes a flat, obtuse angle (less than 180 degrees) while the base-to-length ratio of the breast ranges from 0.5 to 1.0.|$|E

The subjects (N= 12) were members of 1979 - 80 University of Alberta Volleyball Team. The research design employed a repeated measures technique with two variables, the on-hand and off-hand spikes.

In these cases of expertise, the use of a 3 -D reconstruction processing technique can be very useful.

40|$|Abstract. Single {{particle}} {{analysis is}} one of the methods for structural studies of protein and macromolecules developed in image analysis on electron microscopy. Reconstructing 3 D structure from microscope images is not an easy analysis because of the low resolution of images and lack of the directional information of images in 3 D structure. To improve the resolution, different projections are aligned, classified and averaged. Inferring the orientations of these images is so difficult that the task of reconstructing 3 D structures depends upon the experience of researchers. But recently, a method to reconstruct 3 D structures is automatically devised [6]. In this paper, we propose a new method for determining Euler <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>projections</b> by applying Genetic Algorithms (i. e., GAs). We empirically show that the proposed approach has improved the previous one in terms of computational time and acquired precision. ...|$|R

Recovering an initial bulk of data (medical, astronomy, seismology, quality control, etc.) from a set <b>of</b> <b>projections</b> {{has been an important}} vector of progress during the last fifty years. However, for a specific implementation the tomographist has to study three different kinds of problems. The first one is the geometry of acquisition (dimension of the initial data, number and <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>projections,</b> spatial position <b>of</b> the bins) and the way to represent it in an adequate manner on the computer. This leads to the expression of a specific discrete Radon operator which (generally) has lost its properties of linearity and shift-invariance; at most, it would tends to the continuous operator if you had an infinite number <b>of</b> <b>projections,</b> pixels, bins. Second, the acquisition device has to be modeled and all kind of new non-linearities have {{to be taken into account}} (blur of the detector, attenuation process, mismatch <b>of</b> the <b>projection</b> <b>of</b> the center of rotation, etc.). Third, noise appears. Then things are going from bad to worse. Effectively, if the first step has not been made correctly, the discrepancy between the continuous and discrete (implemented) inverse Radon transform will be responsible for a significant amount of errors into the pixel reconstructed value. Even if this error is low (say 5 %), since the radiations that you are giving to a patient (respectively receiving from stars) are low, the contrast sensibility on the image where the medical doctor (resp. the astronomer) want to perform a given task of tumor (resp. double stars) detection of is low. Thus, the first step in this overall process is to perform the computer imagery as better than you can since it is the parameter that you have in hands...|$|R

Inspired by the Bourbaki Panorama, the intention was to create an inhabitable frame which orientated the frame to revise notions of discontent, to breach inertia through the contingency of pressure and tension. Using the frame as a heuristic tool, the installation allows free movement of people within the work, transforming/returning what we perceive to be a two-dimensional plane into a three-dimensional space. This was formulated as a demonstration of asynchronous perception. Two observations were key to the way we developed this project, firstly the perception of layers created as the landscape recedes from a single viewing point, and secondly, the distortion required by the Bourbaki Panorama to create the illusion of the real.

40|$|The {{first part}} of this thesis {{presents}} a convenient and flexible calibration method to estimate the relative rotation and translation among multiple cameras. A simple planar pattern is used for accurate calibration and is not required to be simultaneously observed by all cameras. Thus the method is especially suitable for widely spaced camera array. In order to fairly evaluate the calibration results for different camera setups, a novel accuracy metric is introduced based on the deflection <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>projection</b> rays, which is insensitive to a number of setup factors. The objective of this thesis is to develop a multiview system that can synthesize photorealistic novel views of the scene captured by sparse cameras distributed in a wide area. The system cost is largely reduced due to the small number of required cameras, and the image capture is greatly facilitated because the cameras are allowed to be widely spaced and flexibly placed. The key techniques to achieve this goal are investigated in this thesis. Cui, Chunhui. "November 2010. "Adviser: Ngan King Ngi.
