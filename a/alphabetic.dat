5|$|Chinese {{characters}} {{are also used}} within China to write non-Han languages. The largest non-Han group in China, the Zhuang, have for over 1300 years used Chinese characters. Despite both the introduction of an official <b>alphabetic</b> script in 1957 and lack of a corresponding official set of Chinese characters, more Zhuang people can read the Zhuang logograms than the <b>alphabetic</b> script.|$|E
5|$|Applying ROT13 to a {{piece of}} text merely {{requires}} examining its <b>alphabetic</b> characters and replacing each one by the letter 13 places further along in the alphabet, wrapping back to the beginning if necessary.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that Ottawa speakers were among the groups that used the Great Lakes Algonquian syllabary, a syllabic writing system derived from a European-based <b>alphabetic</b> orthography, but supporting evidence is weak.|$|E
5|$|Some Chinese {{characters}} {{have been adopted}} {{as part of the}} writing systems of other neighbouring East Asian languages, but are currently used only in Japanese and Korean, as Vietnamese is now written using <b>alphabetic</b> scripts.|$|E
5|$|English writing also {{includes}} a system of punctuation {{that is similar to}} the system of punctuation marks used in most <b>alphabetic</b> languages around the world. The purpose of punctuation is to mark meaningful grammatical relationships in sentences to aid readers in understanding a text and to indicate features important for reading a text aloud.|$|E
5|$|Signed as a northsouth route, it {{lies that}} way at the {{southern}} end, but about midway along its length the road turns and thence travels eastwest. Excluding its termini, {{there are only two}} junctions with other roadways along the entire route. It is the only instance in New York of a route designated without an <b>alphabetic</b> suffix that terminates at both ends at suffixed routes.|$|E
5|$|The ISO 3166/MA updates ISO 3166-1 when necessary. A {{country is}} usually {{assigned}} new ISO 3166-1 codes if it changes its name or its territorial boundaries. In general, new <b>alphabetic</b> codes are assigned if a country changes {{a significant part}} of its name, while a new numeric code is assigned if a country changes its territorial boundaries. Codes for formerly used country names that were deleted from ISO 3166-1 are published in ISO 3166-3.|$|E
5|$|The International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) is an <b>alphabetic</b> {{system of}} phonetic {{notation}} {{based primarily on}} the Latin alphabet. It was devised by the International Phonetic Association in the late 19th century as a standardized representation of the sounds of spoken language. The IPA is used by lexicographers, foreign language students and teachers, linguists, speech-language pathologists, singers, actors, constructed language creators and translators.|$|E
5|$|The <b>alphabetic</b> {{country codes}} were first {{included}} in ISO 3166 in 1974, and the numeric country codes were first included in 1981. The country codes {{have been published}} as ISO 3166-1 since 1997, when ISO 3166 was expanded into three parts, with ISO 3166-2 defining codes for subdivisions and ISO 3166-3 defining codes for former countries.|$|E
5|$|While {{studying}} the Clarke Codex of Plato's dialogues at Oxford, Martin Schanz noticed that isolated {{letters in the}} margins of two dialogues formed an <b>alphabetic</b> series and marked every hundredth standard line (alpha = 100, beta = 200, etc.). He was able to show that other manuscripts had similar marginal markings. His 1881 article named this kind of line-counting 'partial stichometry' and contrasted it to 'total stichometry' studied by Graux.|$|E
5|$|Period Brak E {{witnessed}} {{the building of}} the city's walls, and Tell Brak expansion beyond the mound to form a lower town. By the late 5th millennium BC, Tell Brak reached the size of c. 55 hectares. Area TW of the tell (Archaeologists divided Tell Brak into areas designated with <b>Alphabetic</b> letters. See the map for Tell Brak's areas) revealed the remains of a monumental building with two meters thick walls and a basalt threshold. In front of the building, a sherd paved street was discovered, leading to the northern entrance of the city.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} no {{well-established}} writing system for ASL, written sign language dates back almost two centuries. The first systematic writing system for a sign language {{seems to be that}} of Roch-Ambroise Auguste Bébian, developed in 1825. However, written sign language remained marginal among the public. In the 1960s, linguist William Stokoe created Stokoe notation specifically for ASL. It is <b>alphabetic,</b> with a letter or diacritic for every phonemic (distinctive) hand shape, orientation, motion, and position, though it lacks any representation of facial expression, and is better suited for individual words than for extended passages of text. Stokoe used this system for his 1965 A Dictionary of American Sign Language on Linguistic Principles.|$|E
5|$|The Ottawa {{writing system}} is a minor {{adaptation}} of a very similar one used for other dialects of Ojibwe in Ontario and the United States, and widely employed in reference materials and text collections. Sometimes {{referred to as the}} Double Vowel system because it uses doubled vowel symbols to represent Ottawa long vowels that are paired with corresponding short vowels, it is an adaptation attributed to Charles Fiero of the linguistically oriented system found in publications such as Leonard Bloomfield’s Eastern Ojibwa. Letters of the English alphabet substitute for specialized phonetic symbols, in conjunction with orthographic conventions unique to Ottawa. The system embodies two basic principles: (1) <b>alphabetic</b> letters from the English alphabet are used to write Ottawa, but with Ottawa sound values; (2) the system is phonemic in nature, in that each letter or letter combination indicates its basic sound value, and does not reflect all the phonetic detail that occurs. Accurate pronunciation cannot be learned without consulting a fluent speaker.|$|E
5|$|The {{basic unit}} of Maya hieroglyphic text is the glyph block, which transcribes {{a word or}} phrase. The block is {{composed}} {{of one or more}} individual glyphs attached to each other to form the glyph block, with individual glyph blocks generally being separated by a space. Glyph blocks are usually arranged in a grid pattern. For ease of reference, epigraphers refer to glyph blocks from left to right alphabetically, and top to bottom numerically. Thus, any glyph block in a piece of text can be identified: C4 would be third block counting from the left, and the fourth block counting downwards. If a monument or artefact has more than one inscription, column labels are not repeated, rather they continue in the <b>alphabetic</b> series; if there are more than 26 columns, the labelling continues as A', B', etc. Numeric row labels restart from 1 for each discrete unit of text.|$|E
5|$|The {{sound of}} speech can be {{analyzed}} into a combination of segmental and suprasegmental elements. The segmental elements are those that follow each other in sequences, which are usually represented by distinct letters in <b>alphabetic</b> scripts, such as the Roman script. In free flowing speech, there are no clear boundaries between one segment and the next, nor usually are there any audible pauses between words. Segments therefore are distinguished by their distinct sounds which {{are a result of}} their different articulations, and they can be either vowels or consonants. Suprasegmental phenomena encompass such elements as stress, phonation type, voice timbre, and prosody or intonation, all of which may have effects across multiple segments.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} no {{standard}} or official writing system for Ottawa, a widely accepted system is used in a recent dictionary of Ottawa and Eastern Ojibwe, a collection of texts, and a descriptive grammar. The same system is taught in programs for Ojibwe language teachers. One of its goals is to promote standardization of Ottawa writing so that language learners are able {{to read and write}} in a consistent way. By comparison, folk phonetic spelling approaches to writing Ottawa based on less systematic adaptations of written English or French are more variable and idiosyncratic, and do not always make consistent use of <b>alphabetic</b> letters. While the modern orthography is used in a number of prominent publications, its acceptance is not universal. Prominent Ottawa author Basil Johnston has explicitly rejected it, preferring to use a form of folk spelling in which the correspondences between sounds and letters are less systematic. Similarly, a lexicon representing Ottawa as spoken in Michigan and another based on Ottawa in Oklahoma, use English-based folk spellings distinct from that employed by Johnson.|$|E
25|$|Some {{shorthand}} systems {{attempted to}} ease {{learning by using}} characters from the Latin alphabet. Such non-stenographic systems have often been described as <b>alphabetic,</b> and purists might claim that such systems are not 'true' shorthand. However, these <b>alphabetic</b> systems do have value for students who cannot dedicate the years necessary to master a stenographic shorthand. <b>Alphabetic</b> shorthands cannot be written at the speeds theoretically possible with symbol systems—200 words per minute or more—but require {{only a fraction of}} the time to acquire a useful speed of between 60 and 100 words per minute.|$|E

25|$|Some scripts, however, {{are truly}} ambiguous. The semi-syllabaries of ancient Spain were syllabic for {{plosives}} such as p, t, k, but <b>alphabetic</b> for other consonants. In some versions, vowels were written redundantly after syllabic letters, conforming to an <b>alphabetic</b> orthography. Old Persian cuneiform was similar. Of 23 consonants (including null), seven were fully syllabic, thirteen were purely <b>alphabetic,</b> {{and for the}} other three, there was one letter for /Cu/ and another for both /Ca/ and /Ci/. However, all vowels were written overtly regardless; as in the Brahmic abugidas, the /Ca/ letter was used for a bare consonant.|$|E
25|$|Non-stenographic systems often {{supplement}} <b>alphabetic</b> characters {{by using}} punctuation marks as additional characters, giving special significance to capitalised letters, and sometimes using additional non-alphabetic symbols. Examples of such systems include Stenoscript, Speedwriting and Forkner shorthand. However, {{there are some}} pure <b>alphabetic</b> systems, including Personal Shorthand, SuperWrite, Easy Script Speed Writing and Keyscript Shorthand which limit their symbols to a priori <b>alphabetic</b> characters. These have the added advantage that {{they can also be}} typed—for instance, onto a computer, PDA, or cellphone. Early editions of Speedwriting were also adapted so that they could be written on a typewriter, and therefore would possess the same advantage.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, the {{following}} phonetic letters have Unicode representations separate from their Greek <b>alphabetic</b> use, either because their conventional typographic shape is too {{different from the}} original, or because they also have secondary uses as regular <b>alphabetic</b> characters in some Latin-based alphabets, including separate Latin uppercase letters distinct from the Greek ones.|$|E

25|$|The {{history of}} <b>alphabetic</b> writing {{goes back to}} the consonantal writing system used for Semitic {{languages}} in the Levant in the 2nd millennium BCE. Most or nearly all <b>alphabetic</b> scripts used throughout the world today ultimately go back to this Semitic proto-alphabet. Its first origins {{can be traced back to}} a Proto-Sinaitic script developed in Ancient Egypt to represent the language of Semitic-speaking workers in Egypt. This script was partly influenced by the older Egyptian hieratic, a cursive script related to Egyptian hieroglyphs.|$|E

25|$|From this, it {{has been}} {{concluded}} that the system must have been invented {{at a time and}} place when digamma and koppa were still either in use or at least still remembered as parts of the <b>alphabetic</b> sequence, whereas san had either already been forgotten, or at least was no longer remembered with its original <b>alphabetic</b> position. In the latter case, according to a much debated view, sampi itself may in fact have been regarded as being san, but with a new position in the alphabet.|$|E
