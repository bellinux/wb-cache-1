Badd followed by covering Gilberti for the pinfall.|$|E
5|$|After {{the rest}} day came the race's {{individual}} time trial. It was won by Dumoulin, {{who was more}} than a minute ahead of all the other riders in the race. His time was good enough to put him into the overall race lead. Aru rode strongly, and was only three seconds behind Dumoulin in the general classification after the stage. Rodríguez lost over three minutes to Dumoulin. Majka also lost significant time to Aru and Dumoulin <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> fourth place.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the event}} began, a thirty-minute pre-show aired with a match between The Naturals (Andy Douglas and Chase Stevens) and Mikey Batts and Jerrelle Clark.

5|$|The 2008 {{season in}} the ACC was {{described}} as chaotic, and for Maryland, there was no exception. The Terrapins were within grasp of the ACC Atlantic Division championship {{at the end of}} Week 12, but lost their final two games <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> a four-way tie for third place. Maryland closed the regular season with a 7–5 record—including four wins against Top 25-ranked teams—which was enough to secure bowl eligibility. In the postseason, Maryland defeated Nevada of the Western Athletic Conference in the Humanitarian Bowl.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{developed into}} a tropical depression near Tobago on August7. The system then passed through the Windward Islands just south of Carriacou and Petite Martinique. Upon entering the Caribbean Sea early on August8, the tropical depression strengthened into a tropical storm. On August9, the storm strengthened to {{the equivalent of a}} Category1 hurricane, while positioned south of Dominican Republic. The next day, the hurricane peaked with winds of 90mph (150km/h). After striking the Tiburon Peninsula of Haiti, the cyclone began weakening <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> tropical storm intensity on August12. By midday on the following day, the storm made landfall near Cienfuegos, Cuba. Upon emerging into the Straits of Florida, the storm began to re-strengthen. Early on August13, it struck Big Pine Key, Florida, as a strong tropical storm. Weakening slowly while moving north-northwestward, the system made another landfall near St. George Island. After moving inland, the tropical storm slowly deteriorated, falling to tropical depression intensity on August15 and dissipating over West Virginia on August17.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved through}} the West Indies between November3 and November4. The wave reached the vicinity of Turks and Caicos Islands on November 5, where it developed into a tropical storm at 0000 UTC. The storm moved north-northwestward and then westward across the southern Bahamas. A ridge aloft blocked the storm's westward progress and caused it to re-curve west-southwestward on November 6. The system strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane at 1200 UTC on the modern day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Around 1800 UTC on November 6, the storm made landfall on Cayo Romano in Camagüey Province with winds of 80 mph (130 km/h). The system quickly weakened while crossing the mountainous terrain of Cuba <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> tropical storm intensity early on November 7, shortly before emerging into the northwestern Caribbean Sea. Later that day, the storm re-intensified into a Category 1 hurricane and continued on a southwestward path.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{struggled}} {{against the new}} ball in the first {{hour of the day}} three. Miller played and missed three times in one over before being trapped lbw for 31; the tourists added only nine runs in the first hour. Four runs later, Morris reached 51 <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> Bedser, leaving Australia at 5/139. It had been a slow morning for Morris—he took 21 minutes to add a single to his overnight total and reached 50 after taking another 24 minutes to register his second run of the day. Australia fell for 221, narrowly avoiding the follow on, and England declared at 3/174 on the last morning after many rain delays. This left Bradman’s team with a victory target of 317, but the rain kept falling and the entire morning was lost.|$|E

5|$|CSKA kicked-off {{the first}} half of extra-time. Five minutes into the half, Liverpool {{substitute}} Sinama Pongolle was booked. With two minutes of the half remaining, the ball was played into the centre of the CSKA half; Ignashevich misjudged the flight of the ball, which went over his head <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> Cissé. His subsequent shot was saved by Akinfeev, but the ball rebounded to Cissé who scored to give Liverpool a 2–1 lead. The half was brought to an end with Liverpool leading {{for the first time in}} the match. Liverpool kicked-off the second half of extra-time. CSKA had the first chance of the half, but Vágner Love's effort was easily saved by Reina. Liverpool responded midway through the half; Cissé's cross from the right side of the pitch was met by García, who scored. No further goals were scored and the referee blew for full-time with the final score 3–1 to Liverpool.|$|E
5|$|Due to Paula's small size, {{impact in}} Mexico was minor, mainly limited to light {{rainfall}} and winds. However, an American tourist drowned offshore Cozumel. After Paula attained its peak intensity on October13, wind shear began to increase, causing the storm to weaken. The storm turned north-northeastward <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> tropical storm intensity on October14. Shortly thereafter, Paula made landfall in the Cuban province of Pinar del Río. Early on October15, Paula weakened to a tropical depression while moving eastward over Cuba, before degenerating into a remnant {{low pressure area}} about six hours later. In Cuba, rainfall was mostly beneficial. Strong winds, with gusts reaching 68mph (109km/h), left power outages in Pinar del Río and Artemisa provinces. In the Havana area, a few homes were deroofed, while falling trees blocked many roads. Impact in the Florida Keys was minimal, limited to light rainfall and increased tides.|$|E
5|$|During the series, Barnett {{made two}} notable errors. With Australia leading the series 10 {{going into the}} Fifth Test at The Oval, Barnett dropped Len Hutton and Maurice Leyland when both were on 40. Leyland went on to post 187 while Hutton set a Test world record of 364. In effect, England were gifted an extra 461runs as they set a world record score of 7/903. Bradman injured himself during the {{marathon}} innings in a rare stint at the bowling crease after the specialist bowlers had failed to break the Englishmen. With opener Jack Fingleton also injured, Australia were down to nine men <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> the heaviest defeat in Test history (an innings and 579 runs) and the series was drawn.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Chantal was one {{of three}} {{tropical}} cyclones to make landfall in Texas during the 1989 Atlantic hurricane season. The third named storm and the first hurricane of the season, Chantal slowly developed on July 30 in the southern Gulf of Mexico from a tropical disturbance that was previously within Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) while near Trinidad and Tobago. While heading north-northwestward, the depression steadily intensified and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Chantal on the following day. Thereafter, Chantal quickly strengthen and became a hurricane on August1. After intensifying slightly further, Chantal made landfall near High Island, Texas later that day. The storm quickly weakened upon moving inland <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> tropical storm intensity a few hours after landfall. Early on August2, Chantal weakened to a tropical depression and dissipated over Oklahoma by August4.|$|E
5|$|Menchov was fifth after Alpe di Siusi, but rose {{to second}} before stage 12, the {{very long and}} hilly {{individual}} time trial in Cinque Terre. There, he claimed a convincing victory; only Levi Leipheimer finished within a minute of Menchov's winning time. Di Luca was nearly two minutes slower than him, finished sixth on the stage, <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> second overall, with Menchov assuming the race lead. Di Luca tried repeatedly to shed Menchov during the remaining mountain stages {{to make up the}} time difference, which was never more than a minute. The two riders were involved in sprints for time bonuses at the finish line in stages 16 and 17, as well as an intermediate sprint in stage 20. Menchov was consistently quicker than Di Luca in these sprints. With his superior time-trial skills providing the difference in the final stage, the Russian was able to emerge as Giro champion, despite a dramatic fall in the final kilometre before the finish line.|$|E
5|$|Squads {{from the}} larger group broke off and moved up the hill toward coal pit number three. One squad took up a {{position}} at the pit number three coal shed; another, at the pump house. A warning party was sent ahead of the squads into Chinatown. They warned the Chinese they had one hour {{to pack up and}} leave town. After only 30 minutes, the first gunshots were fired by the squad at the pump house, followed by a volley from those at the coal shed. Lor Sun Kit, a Chinese laborer, was shot <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> the ground. As the group at coal pit number three rejoined them, the crowd pressed on toward Chinatown, some men firing their weapons as they went. The smaller group of white miners at the plank bridge divided itself into squads and surrounded Chinatown. One squad stayed at the plank bridge to cut off any Chinese escape.|$|E

5|$|Stage 14 was the {{individual}} time trial, which was won by Vasil Kiryienka (Sky). Contador finished {{third on the}} stage, nearly three minutes ahead of Aru. Contador therefore moved back into the race lead. Contador passed Landa on the road, despite starting three minutes after him; Landa lost over four minutes <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> seventh place overall. Movistar's Andrey Amador moved up into third. Stage 15 was {{the final stage of}} the second week and was the climb to Madonna di Campiglio. Landa won the stage after Astana rode hard on the final climb; he finished five seconds ahead of Contador and moved back up to fourth place. Contador finished a second ahead of Aru and extended his lead further due to bonus seconds for his third-place finish. Porte, who had lost over 30 minutes during the weekend following the crash in stage 13, withdrew from the race after the stage.|$|E
5|$|The Canadiens {{played the}} Chicago Black Hawks in Montreal on January 28, 1937.

Morenz lost his balance <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> the ice, {{crashing}} into the boards and catching his left skate in the wooden siding. Seibert, unable to stop, landed on him with full force. The resulting impact snapped Morenz's left leg, creating a noise heard throughout the rink. Helped to the Canadiens bench by his teammates, Morenz was taken to Hôpital St-Luc, where {{it was found that}} his leg was fractured in four places.|$|E
5|$|The Jets snapped their {{losing streak}} in a 27–13 {{victory over the}} St. Louis Rams in which Sanchez {{completed}} 15 of his 20 passes for 178 {{yards and a touchdown}}. However, his struggles continued in a rematch against New England on Thanksgiving night. Despite completing 26 of 36 of his pass attempts for 301 yards and a touchdown and interception, the Jets lost to the Patriots 49–19 <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> 4–7 as Sanchez turned the ball over twice—each turnover led to Patriots touchdowns. The Jets surrendered 21 points within a 53-second span on 3 turnovers. The play that earned Sanchez the most criticism was a second-quarter fumble where he ran into the backside of lineman Brandon Moore and the Patriots scored on the resulting fumble; this play, becoming widely known as the butt fumble, was mocked in the media.|$|E
