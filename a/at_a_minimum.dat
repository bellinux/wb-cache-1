5|$|Abercrombie {{made two}} notable errors of {{judgment}} during the battle. One {{was a failure}} to recognize after {{the first wave of}} attacks that his chosen method of attack was unlikely to work. Instead of ordering additional waves of troops to the slaughter, he should have retreated to a safe distance and considered alternative actions. The second failure was that he apparently never considered ordering a flanking maneuver against the French right. <b>At</b> <b>a</b> <b>minimum</b> this would have stretched the French defenses, allowing his attackers elsewhere to find weak points. In fact, the French twice in the battle sent companies of militia out of their works on the right to enfilade the British attackers.|$|E
5|$|Ancient {{authors have}} implicated Domitian {{in the death}} of his brother, either by {{directly}} accusing him of murder, or implying he left the ailing Titus for dead, even alleging that during his lifetime, Domitian was openly plotting against his brother. It is difficult to assess the factual veracity of these statements given the known bias of the surviving sources. Brotherly affection was likely <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>minimum,</b> but this was hardly surprising, considering that Domitian had barely seen Titus after the age of seven.|$|E
5|$|Any {{baseball}} game involves {{one or more}} umpires, who make rulings {{on the outcome of}} each play. <b>At</b> <b>a</b> <b>minimum,</b> one umpire will stand behind the catcher, to have {{a good view of the}} strike zone, and call balls and strikes. Additional umpires may be stationed near the other bases, thus making it easier to judge plays such as attempted force outs and tag outs. In Major League Baseball, four umpires are used for each game, one near each base. In the playoffs, six umpires are used: one at each base and two in the outfield along the foul lines.|$|E

5|$|The {{object of}} the game is to get the highest score. There are two play modes: Zen and Core. There is a 90-second time limit in Zen mode. In Core mode, players play until the screen fills with poorly placed tetrominos, similar to Tetris. Core has two difficulties. On the easiest difficulty, three-letter words suffice, but harder modes require five-letter words <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>minimum.</b> A score {{multiplier}} grows as players maintain a combo of multiple words created in succession, and resets if players are too slow. Scores are uploaded to Game Center.|$|E

5|$|Zeta Tucanae is a yellow-white main {{sequence}} star of spectral type F9.5V and an apparent magnitude of 4.20 located 28 light-years {{away from the}} Solar System. Despite having a slightly lower mass, this star is more luminous than the Sun. The composition and mass of this star {{are very similar to}} the Sun, with a slightly lower mass and an estimated age of three billion years. The solar-like qualities make it a target of interest for investigating the possible existence of a life-bearing planet.

The problems facing the monarchy were complex and daunting but Catherine was able to keep the monarchy and the state institutions functioning even <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>minimum</b> level. At first, Catherine compromised and made concessions to the rebelling Protestants, or Huguenots, as they became known. She failed, however, to grasp the theological issues that drove their movement. Later she resorted, in frustration and anger, to hard-line policies against them. In return, she came to be blamed for the excessive persecutions carried out under her sons' rule, in particular for the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre of 1572, in which thousands of Huguenots were killed in Paris and throughout France.|$|E
5|$|Following the war, one {{important}} research avenue {{was trying to}} increase the design bandwidth of wide-band filters. The approach used at the time (and still in use today) was {{to start with a}} lumped element prototype filter and through various transformations arrive at the desired filter in a distributed element form. This approach appeared to be stuck <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>minimum</b> Q of five (see Band-pass filters below for an explanation of Q). In 1957, Leo Young at Stanford Research Institute published a method for designing filters which started with a distributed element prototype. This prototype was based on quarter wave impedance transformers and was able to produce designs with bandwidths up to an octave, corresponding to a Q of about 1.3. Some of Young's procedures in that paper were empirical, but later, exact solutions were published. Young's paper specifically addresses directly coupled cavity resonators, but the procedure can equally be applied to other directly coupled resonator types, such as those found in modern planar technologies and illustrated in this article. The capacitive gap filter (figure 8) and the parallel-coupled lines filter (figure 9) are examples of directly coupled resonators.|$|E
5|$|For a {{transmission}} line carrying sinusoidal waves, {{the phase of}} the reflected wave is continually changing with distance, {{with respect to the}} incident wave, as it proceeds back down the line. Because of this continuous change there are certain points on the line that the reflection will be in phase with the incident wave and the amplitude of the two waves will add. There will be other points where the two waves are in anti-phase and will consequently subtract. At these latter points the amplitude is <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>minimum</b> and they are known as nodes. If the incident wave has been totally reflected and the line is lossless, there will be complete cancellation at the nodes with zero signal present there despite the ongoing transmission of waves in both directions. The points where the waves are in phase are anti-nodes and represent a peak in amplitude. Nodes and anti-nodes alternate along the line and the combined wave amplitude varies continuously between them. The combined (incident plus reflected) wave appears to be standing still on the line and is called a standing wave.|$|E

5|$|In 1851 the Supreme Court was reorganized {{under the}} new state constitution. The {{position}} of justice was changed from an appointed position to an elected one. Judicial terms were changed to six years and the Court's size was set to {{a minimum of three}} members and not more than five. The Court's judges quickly became overwhelmed by an ever-increasing caseload. In 1853 the minimum was increased to four members and in 1872 it was increased to five. The Court has remained <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>minimum</b> of five justices since that time. In 1867 the general assembly transferred all the law books in the Indiana State Library to the Court to create a Supreme Court Law Library. The library grew to become the primary legal library for the state and includes more than seventy-thousand volumes.|$|E
5|$|Its {{by-product}} status {{means that}} indium production is {{constrained by the}} amount of sulfidic zinc (and copper) ores extracted each year. Therefore, its availability needs to be discussed in terms of supply potential. The supply potential of a by-product is defined as that amount which is economically extractable from its host materials per year under current market conditions (i.e. technology and price). Reserves and resources are not relevant for by-products, since they cannot be extracted independently from the main-products. Recent estimates put the supply potential of indium <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>minimum</b> of 1,300 t/yr from sulfidic zinc ores and 20 t/yr from sulfidic copper ores. These figures are significantly greater than current production (655 t in 2016). Thus, major future increases in the by-product production of indium will be possible without significant increases in production costs or price. The average indium price in 2016 was $US240/kg, down from $US705/kg in 2014.|$|E
5|$|On 9 and 10 October 1946, the {{telescope}} {{was used to}} observe the ionisation in the atmosphere caused by meteors in the Giacobinids meteor shower.

Shortly after this, {{the telescope}} {{was used to determine}} the radiant points for meteors. This was possible as the echo rate is <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>minimum</b> at the radiant point, and a maximum at 90 degrees to it. The telescope, as well as other receivers on the site, was also used to study auroral streamers that were visible at the site in early August 1947.|$|E
