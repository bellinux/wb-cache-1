40|$|Pre-slaughter {{live weight}} taken {{directly}} off pasture and hot standard <b>carcase</b> <b>weight</b> {{data was collected}} from 7, 849 lambs produced at 8 sites across Australia over a 4 year period (2007 - 2010) {{as part of the}} Sheep Cooperative Research Centre’s information nucleus flock experiment. These lambs were the progeny of 363 Terminal, Maternal, and Merino sires divergent for post-weaning eye muscle depth breeding values (PEMD). Dressing percentage was calculated by dividing hot standard <b>carcase</b> <b>weight</b> by pre-slaughter weight expressed as a percentage, and all three of these terms were analysed using a linear mixed effects models. The base model included fixed effects for site, year of birth, kill group, sex, birth-rear type, sire type and dam breed, with sire and darn identification included as random terms. Sire post-weaning fat depth, weight, and PEMD breeding values were included as covariates. The PEMD breeding value was found to have no effect on pre-slaughter weight, however it did increase (P< 0. 01) hot standard <b>carcase</b> <b>weight</b> by 1 kg across the 7 unit PEMD range. This increase was attributable to the impact of sire PEMD on dressing percentage which increased (P< 0. 01) by 1. 7 dressing percentage units across the PEMD range. This represents a clear production advantage for producers using high PEMD sires, the progeny of which will have a similar live weight to low PEMD sires, but will deliver heavier <b>carcase</b> <b>weights</b> {{on the basis of their}} improved dressing percentage. Although live growth rate does not appear to be impacted, the implications for feed efficiency due to reduced fat deposition are currently being explored...|$|R
40|$|The {{commercial}} {{harvest of}} kangaroos in Australia is regulated by various state government agencies. They control {{the number of}} kangaroos that can be harvested annually with the view to ensuring that the harvest remains ecologically and economically sustainable. In addition to controlling the harvest quotas, some agencies impose minimum weight restrictions on harvested animals, which may assist with maintaining viable breeding populations. However, harvesting usually occurs in remote regions and carcases may be stored refrigerated for up to 10 - 14 d before being inspected for compliance with minimum weight restrictions. Consequently, there is concern that weight loss during cold storage, particularly in small carcases close to the minimum limit, could lead to harvesters being wrongly prosecuted or fined for breaching the minimum <b>carcase</b> <b>weight</b> licence condition. We found that for two species of kangaroo, the large eastern grey kangaroo (Macropus giganteus; liveweight 30 - 70 kg) and the smaller red-necked wallaby (M. rufogriseus; liveweight 10 - 24 kg), <b>carcase</b> <b>weight</b> loss after 10 days cold storage was negligible.

40|$|In vivo {{measures}} of carcase quality can aid selection. Muscle density, (measured by computer tomography) has strong negative genetic and phenotypic correlations with intramuscular fat. The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate growth and carcase parameters of lambs, sired by five high and low muscle density Terminal sire rams, using three different covariates. Progeny (n= 394) were recorded for live weight at: birth; 8 weeks, 16 weeks and immediately pre-slaughter. Ultrasonic measurements were made at the third lumbar vertebrae, pre-slaughter. Carcase records include <b>carcase</b> <b>weights,</b> EUROP classification scores for fatness and conformation. Data were analysed using GENSTAT 15, using a sire nested within muscle density ANOVA design model, fitting sex; dam age (slaughter batch for carcase traits); birth/rear type and MyoMaxTM carrier status. The model was adjusted for the covariates, age at measurement (age) : live weight at slaughter (Slwt); or slaughter fat grade (fat). Low muscle density sired lambs were heavier at 8 weeks (age P= 0. 022; Slwt P= 0. 043 : fat P= 0. 04) and 16 weeks (age 0. 014; Slwt P= 0. 05; fat P= 0. 036). However high muscle density sired lambs had increased ultrasonic muscle depth (age 0. 0 19 : Slwt P= 0. 017; and fat P= 0. 017), heavier hot <b>carcase</b> <b>weight</b> (age P= 0. 004; Slwt P< 0. 001; fat P= 0. 004), 48 h cold <b>carcase</b> <b>weight</b> (age P= 0. 027; Slwt P< 0. 001 : fat P= 0. 013), higher killing out percentages (age, Slwt and fat P< 0. 001), and improved carcase conformation (age, Slwt and fat P< 0. 001).

50|$|Ireland {{has a low}} {{density of}} pig {{production}} {{when compared to the}} larger pig producing regions across Europe.Irish pig producers finish their pigs at lower <b>carcase</b> <b>weights</b> compared to most countries across Europe. As a result, Irish producers do not castrate their male pigs. Castration is carried out across most of Europe as male pigs are generally brought to heavier <b>carcase</b> <b>weights</b> and, without castration, 'boar taint' may become an issue. Boar taint refers to the unpleasant odour and flavour characteristics noted in pork derived from males boars as they reach sexual maturity. Taint is only found in a small minority of boars and can be found in sows as it is actually caused by two different chemicals, one produced in the male testes and the other produced in the intestines. As the castration of pigs has also become an animal welfare issue across Europe, non-castration is considered a double advantage, as it benefits the welfare of the animal and entire boars produce leaner and better quality meat. Taint can be controlled through breeding away from the few lines that have it (genetics), feed management (higher fibre) and housing management (out on pasture instead of confinement).|$|R

40|$|This paper {{summarise}} six studies {{undertaken by}} the Sheep CRC to elucidate certain aspects of confinement feeding of sheep. A review of confinement feeding highlighted the variability of growth rate and feed conversion of sheep and revealed that {{little is known about}} the use of sorghum for feeding sheep. The review indicated that the main factors responsible for variation of growth rate and feed conversion were adaptation to grain and feeding system, including the preparation and presentation of feed. The importance of social and physiological adaptation to grain feeding was confirmed. Factors identified as responsible for safe induction and uniform growth rates included prior exposure to grain as lambs, gradual introduction of grain and, when concentrate was provided ad libitum from the first day, the use of either virginiamycin, a pelleted feed, a total mixed ration or a step-wise increase of high-starch grain components. Separate feeding of hay and grain resulted in performance comparable with that of a pelleted diet and that of a total mixed ration. Sorghum-based concentrate diets resulted in growth rates and <b>carcase</b> <b>weights</b> similar to that for winter cereal grains or pellets. Steam flaking or expanding of sorghum had no significant effect on growth rates or <b>carcase</b> <b>weights.</b> These results can be used to determine the profitability of various feedlotting options...|$|R

40|$|Increased {{growth rate}} and carcass lean meat yield % are key profit drivers for the lamb industry, however redistributing lean tissue to more highly priced {{parts of the}} carcase will also {{increase}} its value. Faster growing lambs {{are known to be}} leaner and less mature at slaughter. Therefore we hypothesised that selection for growth using the Australian Sheep Breeding Value (ASBV) for greater post weaning weight (PWWT) would increase whole <b>carcase</b> lean <b>weight,</b> when animals are compared at the same <b>carcase</b> <b>weight.</b> Lamb <b>carcases</b> (n= 1, 218) from the Sheep CRC Information Nucleus were scanned in sections (fore, saddle, and hind) using Computed Tomography (CT) to determine fat lean and bone weights. Data was analysed using the log-linearised allometric equation logy = log a + b. logx. Fixed effects were site-year, sex sire type, birth-type rear-type and kill group within site-year, with random terms sire and dam by year. For the same carcass weight PWWT caused no composition differences, except in female lambs which had 3. 3 % more carcase lean (P< 0. 01) across the 25 unis PWWT range. Alternatively for the same fat, lean or bone weight these tissues were all proportionately heavier in the saddle region of the high PWWT lambs by 3 %, 7 %, and 16 % across the PWWT range. Aligning with our hypothesis, PWWT was associated with increased total carcase lean, although only in females. Unexpectedly, PWWT caused a redistribution of carcass tissues to the saddle region, particularly for bone and lean, implying an altered conformation in these high growth lambs. Conflicting with the premise of our hypothesis, these effects appear to be independent of maturity as there was no whole body increase in bone weight. Furthermore loin muscle myoglobin concentration in the high PWWT lambs was increased (by 0. 03 ± 0. 018 mg/g tissue) rather than decreased as would be expected in a less mature animal, In conclusion, PWWT redistributes <b>carcase</b> <b>weight</b> to the saddle region of lambs...|$|R

At a given <b>carcase</b> <b>weight</b> the lean tissue was 4. 2 % heavier (P< 0. 01), and fat 8. 7 % lighter in the whole carcase (P< 0. 05) across the 7 unit PEMD range.

The mechanistic reason for this redistribution is not clear, and will be investigated with more extensive sampling from tissues across the carcase. In contrast to our hypothesis, PEMD was associated with increased total carcase lean, and reduced fat.

Live weight was recorded and faecal samples were collected on three sampling occasions; weaning (approximately 12 weeks of age), post-weaning (approximately 19 weeks) and pre-slaughter (approximately 29 weeks). Hot standard <b>carcase</b> <b>weight</b> (HSCW) and dressing% were measured at slaughter. Faecal samples were screened for presence and concentration of Cryptosporidium, Giardia and Haemonchus oocysts using a quantitative PCR. Trichostrongylid eggs were quantified with modified McMaster faecal worm egg count (WEC). Protozoan shedding intensity was categorised as high (above median oocyst concentration in positive sheep), low (below median oocyst concentration in positive sheep) or not detected. Shedding was also categorised for shedding type (no shedding, single Giardia infection, single Cryptosporidium infection, concurrent Giardia and Cryptosporidium infection) and lambs were categorised for frequency of shedding (shedding identified on 0, 1, 2 or 3 occasions). Associations of parasite shedding intensity category, shedding type, shedding frequency, WEC and Haemonchus status (positive or negative) with lamb production were assessed using general linear models (HSCW and dressing%) and linear mixed effects models (live weight). High Cryptosporidium parvum shedding was associated with lower live weight, ranging 2. 31 – 4. 52 kg over the 3 sampling occasions. Cryptosporidium parvum shedding was associated with less HSCW in high (3. 22 kg less) and low (3. 22 kg less) shedding lambs post-weaning, and high (2. 21 kg less) and low (2. 60 kg less) shedding lambs pre-slaughter as well as lower dressing% (2. 7 % lower in high shedding lambs post-weaning). Cryptosporidium (all species) shedding pre-slaughter was associated with reduced dressing% in both high (1. 25 % lower) and low (1. 21 % lower) shedding lambs. Giardia shedding pre-slaughter was associated with 0. 59 kg less HSCW in high shedding lambs. Increased frequency of C. parvum and Giardia shedding in a specific animal (repeated detection) were associated with reduced HSCW and dressing%.

40|$|The aim of diploma thesis was {{to analyze}} an {{ecological}} farm in South Bohemia region {{with the system}} of beef farming with the exclusion of market milk production, and evaluation of selected reproductive and meat production parameters. Meat hybrids of aberdeen angus, galloway, charolais and hereford breed were kept on this farm. Years from 2010 to 2015 were analyzed and then following parameters were evaluated: number of births during the year and in individual months, length of gestation and calving interval, service period, insemination index and calf losses. Meat production indicators were evaluated including the resulting class of carcase classification in SEUOP system, <b>carcase</b> <b>weight</b> {{and the age of}} animals at the time of slaughtering. Subsequently, comparison with neighboring organic farm and conventional farms were made. Although it is a small farm the results of the analysis shows that the reproductive parameters are above the average compared to the conventional aberdeen angus farms. Comparing conventional farms meat production results are relatively the same...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{explored}} whether {{the use of}} group medication with antibiotics in a Danish pig herd was reduced after vaccination of the pigs against proliferative enteropathy (PE) caused by Lawsonia intracellularis. 7900 pigs originating from a single commercial sow herd were vaccinated against L. intracellularis, whereas 7756 pigs were kept as non-vaccinated controls. The pigs were included batch-wise in the study with every second batch being vaccinated. In the vaccinated batches, the consumption of oxytetracykline to treat PE was reduced by 79 %, with a significantly lower number of pigs being treated (P < 0. 0001). Vaccination also resulted in a highly significant improvement of average daily weight gain (+ 46 g/day; P = 9. 55 × 10 - 31) and <b>carcase</b> <b>weight</b> (+ 1. 25 kg; P = 4. 54 × 10 - 05) {{as well as a}} shortened fattening period (- 8 days; P = 2. 01 × 10 - 45) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{current study}} {{examined}} the effect of supplementing lambs with algae. Forty, three month old lambs were allocated to receive a control ration based on oats and lupins (n= 20) or the control ration with DHA-Gold™ algae (~ 2 % of the ration, n= 20). These lambs came from dams previously fed a ration based on either silage (high in omega- 3) or oats and cottonseed meal (OCSM: high in omega- 6) at joining (dam nutrition, DN). Lamb performance, <b>carcase</b> <b>weight</b> and GR fat content were not affected by treatment diet (control vs algae) or DN (silage vs OSCM). Health claimable omega- 3 fatty acids (EPA+DHA) were significantly greater in the LL of lambs fed algae (125 ± 6 mg/ 100 g meat) compared to those not fed algae (43 ± 6 mg/ 100 g meat) and this effect was mediated by DN. Supplementing with algae high in DHA provides a means of improving {{an aspect of the}} health status of lamb meat...|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} paper discusses many of {{the factors}} that have influenced the profitability of commercial and opportunistic feedlotting systems nationally The development and use of a Lamb Feedlotting Cost/Benefit Calculator to analyse variables that impact on lamb feedlotting systems profitability is outlined. Infrastructure cost, depreciation and interest are not discussed but must be considered prior to undertaking a feedlotting program. Lamb Feedlotting Overview Lamb feedlots may be defined as ’on-farm controlled space and environment systems where all feed, health, water and animal welfare requirements are met by the feedlot program manager and staff for the purpose of increasing <b>carcase</b> <b>weight</b> and quality’. Historically, a few lambs have been grown in feedlots, often by grain producers utilising some surplus or damaged grain (Thatcher 1994). Consumer pressure for a more consistent supply and quality of lamb has renewed interest in intensive grain feeding (McIntyre et al 2004) as have current drought conditions across NSW. (Duddy 2005). Feedlotting enables producers to meet specific market specifications, control feed availability, limit soil erosion and seed contamination and improve stock condition (Ano...|$|R
40|$|Times for the {{progressive}} breakdown of 95 lamb carcases were recorded {{to determine the}} impact of <b>carcase</b> <b>weight</b> and GR tissue depth on the time and therefore cost to produce value added retail cuts. Further analysis also assessed the potential to use these carcase traits as predictors of fabrication times. Regression modeling demonstrated there was a limited ability to predict the difference in time to fabricate mid value-added (R 2 = 0. 18) and extreme value-added (R 2 = 0. 12) cuts compared to traditional cuts, suggesting that other factors need to be considered. However, this study highlighted the significant increases in time required to fabricate more value-added cuts and to breakdown heavier carcases. Furthermore, this study demonstrated the changes to the saleable meat yield as the degree of fabrication increased, such that the average product prices increased ($ 20. 64 /kg for mid value added and $ 28. 72 /kg for extreme value added) compared to traditional retail cuts ($ 15 /kg) to offset the increased labour of fabricating value-added cuts...|$|R

40|$|The {{experiment}} evaluated barley and barley/field pea mix (60 : 40), as diets for lot-fed lambs, fed daily, or ad libitum. The diets fed were: barley 800 g/hd. day; barley ad libitum; barley/field pea mix 800 g/hd. day; and barley/field pea mix ad libitum. Pasture hay {{was available}} ad libitum throughout the trial. The grain was introduced over 14 days, and then fed {{for a further}} 56 days. There {{was no significant difference}} in lamb growth rate between treatments (P>O. O 5), but barley/field pea mix ad libitum tended to produce higher growth rate than the other rations (166 vs 143 - 15 1 g/day). Daily dry matter (DM) intake of barley/field pea mix ad libitum was significantly higher than barley ad libitum (7 19 vs 622 g/day), but there was no significant difference (P~ 0. 05) in DM intake:liveweight (LW) gain ratio. Lambs fed barley/field pea mix ad libitum had significantly higher <b>carcase</b> <b>weight</b> (CW) gain (6. 3 vs 5. 0 kg), dressing percentage (45. 5 vs 43. 9 %), and significantly lower DM intake:CW gain ratio (12. 5 : 1 vs 14. 6 : 1) compared to lambs fed barley ad libitum...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} the prevalence and geographical distribution of hydatidosis and investigate factors {{that might be}} expected to influence the prevalence of hydatids in cattle in Queensland north of the Tropic of Capricorn. To {{determine the}} effect of natural levels of infection on <b>carcase</b> <b>weight</b> and subsequent economic loss. Procedure: An abattoir survey conducted in 1981 provided information on the distribution, prevalence and viability of hydatid cysts in cattle from all shires north of the Tropic of Capricorn in Queensland. Livers, lungs and spleens from 10, 382 cattle were palpated at abattoirs in Cairns, Townsville and Rockhampton to detect hydatid cysts. Prevalence of infection in cattle in each shire was estimated from results of the abattoir study together with reports of infection in a further 22, 185 cattle obtained from abattoir records. Linear modelling was used to define the effect of geographical origin, age, breed and sex on prevalence of infection. Differences in the <b>weights</b> of <b>carcases</b> between infected and non-infected cattle of the same age, sex, breed and property of origin were examined. The economic loss to the beef industry in the region surveyed was estimated. Results: Cattle infected with hydatids originated almost entirely from regions to the east of the Great Dividing Range. The mean prevalence inside this zone was 28...|$|R
