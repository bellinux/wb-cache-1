40|$|Received 7 January 2015, Revised 29 June 2016, Accepted 1 July 2016, Available online 9 July 2016 I analyze quantitatively a {{model of}} labor search with {{unemployment}} insurance (UI), savings, voluntary quits and various labor <b>attachment</b> <b>requirements.</b> In particular, I study welfare consequences of a powerful reform giving UI entitlement to workers quitting their jobs voluntarily in order to search for another one. Results of the model calibrated to the US labor market show {{that there may be}} significant welfare gains associated with pursuing a generous entitlement policy for quitters as compared to the US status-quo. Moreover, I employ the assumption of monetary search costs and show that it can explain the empirically documented unemployed worker search behavior. Finally, by inducing different unemployment benefit eligibility requirements, the model identifies a concrete policy that could help us understand differences in the unemployment rate, match quality and income inequality between the US and Europe...|$|E
40|$|Immediately before liftoff, {{ignition}} of the Space Shuttle {{main engines}} places a significant bending {{moment on the}} filament wound cases of the solid rocket booster motors. This results in substantial compressive loading of the aft end of the composite case which, because of <b>attachment</b> <b>requirements,</b> has a complicated design including inserted broadgoods and helical ply dropoffs. To investigate {{the performance of the}} filament wound cases during the prelaunch load environment, a comprehensive study was initiated which included both testing and analysis. The results of the test program, which included testing of several full-scale and over three hundred subscale articles, will be described. The test program began with a short development effort to establish appropriate subscale test specimens for determining the material compressive strengths. Once these were established, a more comprehensive test program was initiated to determine the effects on strength of both processing and design changes. Full-scale cases were tested in a simulated prelaunch bending environment in order to validate the analysis predictions. In all tests, special attention was given to observation of the failure sequence which involved a complex process of load transfer from the region of helical ply dropoffs to the broadgood termination region...|$|E

Upon questioning, he stated that he [...] "subscribed 'to the philosophy and principles of Socialism as manifested in the writings of Lenin'" [...] but [...] "denied that he ... advocated the overthrow of the Government of the United States by force" [...] and [...] "considered membership in the Party compatible with the obligations of American citizenship, believing that [...] "socialism could be achieved here by democratic processes." ...|$|R

5000|$|More skilled {{immigrants}} {{should come}} to Denmark. The party wants to abolish the so-called [...] "24 year rule" [...] and the <b>attachment</b> <b>requirement,</b> thus {{making it easier to}} take up residence in Denmark. However, immigrants should only gain free access to benefits such as healthcare after a length of time and should always respect Danish values.|$|R
30|$|At {{the same}} time, two 2016 European court {{decisions}} ruled {{two of the}} Danish rules discriminatory – the rule requiring that any child over age eight with one parent in the home country and whose Danish-resident parent had been eligible to bring family in {{for more than two}} years must be subjected to a ‘potential for integration’ evaluation (European Court of Justice, Genc C- 561 / 14); and the rule that the <b>attachment</b> <b>requirement</b> only be applied to couples where one spouse had been a citizen for 26 or more years (European Court of Human Rights, Biao v. Denmark) – this second decision on the grounds that it constituted ethnic discrimination. The Danish government respondent to these rulings by dropping those distinctions, and applying the rules more broadly – to all children eight or older with a parent in the home country, and to all couples who apply for spousal reunification (Immigration & Denmark/Udlændingestyrelsen, 2016 a, 2016 b).|$|R
30|$|Over the {{following}} eight years, that government increased the <b>attachment</b> <b>requirement</b> to demand ‘a much greater attachment to Denmark, and introduced a ‘point system’ whereby incoming partners must qualify for entry {{with a combination}} of qualifications including longer educations, job experience, and competence in the Nordic languages, English, French, German or Spanish. Partners under 24 could enter provided they scored extremely high on this scale (The Danish Government and Danish People’s Party, 2010). They also required that the resident partner pass an intermediate Danish language exam (Danskprøve 2, European level B 1 /B 2), be actively employed, and not having received public assistance in the previous three years. The required bank guarantee was increased to 100 000 DKK. These requirements increasingly subjugated Danish residents’ right to family life to their own and their incoming partners’ potential for contributing actively to the Danish tax base (rather than being welfare recipients) (Bech & Mouritsen, 2013).|$|R
5000|$|The {{court held}} that the {{government}} had not proved that the man failed to satisfy the <b>attachment</b> <b>requirement.</b> The opinion's broad language emphasized the compatibility of dissident political views with attachment to the constitution. [...] "The constitutional fathers, fresh from a revolution, did not forge a political strait-jacket for the generations to come", wrote Justice Frank Murphy. The Court observed that Article V of the United States Constitution provides an amendment process without specifying a limit on the scope of amendments and that [...] "the many important and far-reaching changes made in the Constitution since 1787 refute the idea that attachment to any particular provision or provisions is essential, or that one who advocates radical changes is necessarily not attached to the Constitution." [...] It further cautioned that [...] "sincerity of desires to improve the constitution should not be judged by conformity to prevailing thought", because the freedom of thought is the utmost Constitutional value.|$|R
30|$|After 10  years of steepening restrictions, the Social Democratic-led, center-left {{government}} in power 2011 – 15 eased the sharpest rules. Most significantly, they removed the competence-based point system for entering spouses, removed application fees, and decreased the required language competence for resident partners to lower-intermediate (Danskprøve 1, A 2 /B 1). They also changed the <b>attachment</b> <b>requirement</b> {{back to the}} former (2002) language of ‘greater attachment’ to Denmark, made that requirement apply to spouses {{of those who had}} been citizens for 26 rather than 28  years, and returned the bank guarantee requirement to 50 000 DKK. The 24 -year rule remained unchanged, as did the requirements for self-support, employment record and housing. Relating to entry of children, in 2014 the center-left government adjusted the requirement for integration potential to be applied to children age eight or above, rather than all (as before, in cases when a resident parent had qualified for family entry {{for more than two years}} and when another parent remains in the home country). Taken together, the center-left government kept most of the previous government’s restrictions at levels on or about what they were in 2009. A minority Liberal government took power after the June 2015 election, with parliamentary support from the Danish People’s Party, the Liberal Alliance Party and the Conservatives. At the time of this writing, that government has made a several changes to family migration policy, and plans more. It has re-introduced an application fee of 6000 DKK (€ 805) and the higher bank guarantee requirement for spousal entry. It has also once again increased requirements for permanent residence – which affect when resident foreigners qualify to bring in family members – by requiring a higher language exam (B 1 /B 2 level), and a full-time work record, and more years of residence (8 for permanent status, and thus 11 for family entry - though fulfillment of extra requirements allow acquisition in 6  years; The Danish Government/Regeringen, 2016).|$|R

40|$|Tractors {{provide the}} primary source of power for most farming operations. Their {{mobility}} makes them adaptable to different production practices. However, they have two major disadvantages: soil compaction resulting from multiple passes of heavy power units, and inefficiency in transmitting power through tractive means. Cable farming systems were developed to overcome those disadvantages. Most, however, are used only for tillage operations, and employ a limited number of implements. A cable drawn farming system (CDFS) was developed which utilizes a modified linear move irrigation structure as its main frame. The system consists of a mobile truss, carriage, endless cable and controller. A multipurpose carriage system was designed for the CDFS. Finite element analysis was used to determine carrier frame and <b>attachment</b> structural <b>requirements.</b> An implement carrier of the carriage system was designed to be drawn by an endless cable, and to accommodate most three-point hitch implements, including PTO driven implements. An automatic cable gripping device was developed to connect the carriage to the cable. An electrical system was developed to provide power to the carrier through an electric trolley. A rail was designed to guide the carrier and support the electric lines. Potential harvesting scenarios were examined to identify material handling solutions. Evaluation suggested material handling requirements of vegetables could be best met with a conveyor system, while other crops might utilize trailers. A programmable logical controller (PLC) was selected and a control sequence is provided to accommodate the field operations. This research defined design parameters for a CDFS compatible with linear move irrigation system operations. Analytical results provide support for the concept of multipurpose use of a linear move irrigation system...|$|R
40|$|In the 2010 - 11 Budget, the Government {{announced}} {{changes to}} improve the accountability of public ancillary funds and give Australians more certainty that their donations are being used wisely. The changes will provide trustees of public ancillary funds with greater certainty as to their philanthropic obligations and provide donors and the charitable sector with greater confidence that donations are being used effectively. The Assistant Treasurer has released for public consultation a Discussion Paper on improving the integrity of public ancillary funds which aims to increase {{public confidence in the}} philanthropic sector. A public ancillary fund is an ancillary fund to which the public can make tax deductible donations, for the purpose of disbursing funds to a range of non-ancillary or ‘doing’  deductible gift recipients.   These funds are generally used as vehicles for community fund raising. The proposed changes introduce a new regulatory framework similar to that introduced on 1 October 2009 for private ancillary funds. The new rules will apply to public ancillary funds as from 1 July 2011. Making a submission Interested parties are invited to comment on the discussion paper. While submissions may be lodged electronically or by post, electronic lodgement is preferred. For accessibility reasons, please submit responses sent via email in a Word or RTF format.

40|$|The {{neutronics}} {{and radiation}} shielding issues were assessed for the ARIES-RS power plant. The assessment addresses the breeding level, service lifetime, radiation damage, shielding requirements and design, and personnel protection. Major efforts {{were devoted to}} fulfil the top-level requirements which include the demonstration of a closed tritium fuel cycle, generation of no radioactive waste greater than Class C, and production of electricity at a competitive cost. The material optimization {{was one of the}} themes of this study as it influences the neutronics results and helps meet the requirements while minimizing cost. An important outcome of the neutronics and shielding analyses is the specification of the radial builds that contain key component parameters in terms of sizes and optimal compositions. The shielding system comprises a major element of the fusion power core (FPC). The primary function of the shield is radiation protection: protection of superconducting magnets, vacuum vessel, workers and the public. As an element of the power core, the bulk shield meets other requirements for power production and service lifetime. In addition, it serves as a heat sink for the FW:blanket decay heat during a loss-of-coolant accident. All shielding elements are integrated with the remainder of the FPC to meet the assembly, mechanical support and <b>attachments,</b> and maintenance <b>requirements.</b> The system requirements developed for the shield stem from these essential shielding functions. The work reported herein illustrates the strong impact of numerous factors (such as service lifetime, blanket segmentation, shield optimization, radial builds, and unit costs of materials) on the economics of power production...|$|R
40|$|The {{isolation}} of islets by collagenase digestion can cause damage and impact {{the efficiency of}} islet engraftment and function. In this study, we assessed the basement membranes (BMs) of mouse pancreatic islets as a molecular biomarker for islet integrity, damage after isolation, and islet repair in vitro {{as well as in}} the absence or presence of an immune response after transplantation. Immunofluorescence staining of BM matrix proteins and the endothelial cell marker platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule- 1 (PECAM- 1) was performed on pancreatic islets in situ, isolated islets, islets cultured for 4 days, and islet grafts at 3 - 10 days posttransplantation. Flow cytometry was used to investigate the expression of BM matrix proteins in isolated islet ߭cells. The islet BM, consisting of collagen type IV and components of Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm (EHS) tumor laminin 111, laminin a 2, nidogen- 2, and perlecan in pancreatic islets in situ, was completely lost during islet isolation. It was not reestablished during culture for 4 days. Peri- and intraislet BM restoration was identified after islet isotransplantation and coincided with the migration pattern of PECAM- 1 + vascular endothelial cells (VECs). After islet allotransplantation, the restoration of VEC-derived peri-islet BMs was initiated but did not lead to the formation of the intraislet vasculature. Instead, an abnormally enlarged peri-islet vasculature developed, coinciding with islet allograft rejection. The islet BM is a sensitive biomarker of islet damage resulting from enzymatic isolation and of islet repair after transplantation. After transplantation, remodeling of both peri- and intraislet BMs restores ߭cell-matrix <b>attachment,</b> a recognized <b>requirement</b> for ߭cell survival, for isografts but not for allografts. Preventing isolation-induced islet BM damage would be expected to preserve the intrinsic barrier function of islet BMs, thereby influencing both the effector mechanisms required for allograft rejection and the antirejection strategies needed for allograft survival.

40|$|U prošlosti su mnogi različiti psihodinamički pristupi pokušavali objasniti odnos prema Bogu u razdoblju odraslosti s obzirom na odnos prema ocu i majci. Ti pristupi tumačenju u većini su bili samo teoretskoga karaktera, nisu imali značajne empirijske potpore i zbog toga su doživjeli neke opravdane znanstvene kritike. U posljednje vrijeme u tim tumačenjima prevladava teorija privrženosti koja svoje razumijevanje pokušava i odgovarajuće metodološko-empirijski potkrijepiti. Dosadašnji empirijski rezultati glede povezanosti odnosa prema roditeljima i vjernosti u razdoblju odraslosti do sada nisu sasvim jasni. Ovo istraživanje koje u empirijskom dijelu unaprjeđuje naše ranije pilotsko istraživanje doprinos je dosadašnjim istraživanjima o odnosu između vrste rane privrženosti ocu i majci te vrste privrženosti Bogu i Mariji u kasnijim životnim razdobljima. U istraživanju je sudjelovalo 120 sudionika - pripadnika različitih katoličkih skupina. Slično kao što je pokazalo i naše pilotsko istraživanje, koje je imalo manji broj sudionika i manje reprezentativnih za opću populaciju katolika, prema rezultatima, najviše ih ostvaruje prema Bogu i Mariji sigurnu privrženost. Privrženost ocu ili majci u djetinjstvu može djelomično objasniti privrženost Bogu i Mariji u razdoblju odraslosti, osobito kod nesigurnih značajki privrženosti (sklonost izbjegavanju, ambivalentnost) kod kojih, kako izgleda, postoji i više značajnih povezanosti, kao što smo zaključili u našem pilotskom istraživanju. Ipak, treba istaknuti kako rezultati također pokazuju da je potrebno razlikovati sigurne od nesigurnih privrženosti i da privrženosti Bogu i Mariji u značajnoj mjeri ne ovise o ranim odnosima s roditeljima već o drugim čimbenicima. There {{have been}} many psychodynamic {{approaches}} that tried to explain the connection between early relationship with {{the mother and father}} and later religious experience. Many of the »traditional« psychodynamic approaches to religion were subject to criticism, since they have many theoretical, empirical and methodological problems. Attachment theory presents an alternative to them, as it fulfils some important scientific <b>requirements.</b> <b>Attachment</b> theory and its studies suggest, that the quality of early relationships with primary caregivers (usually the mother and father), especially emotional security, seems to have an important impact on the characteristics of interpersonal relationships in later stages of life. We can also consider the relationship with God and Mary from the perspective of early relationships, especially from the perspective of attachment theory, {{which is one of the}} leading theories in the field of child and human development. These relationships meet the criteria (maintaining proximity, secure base, haven of safety, separation anxiety) of an attachment relationship. Attachment theory generally uses two basic categories when assessing the quality of attachment, security (that has the most positive impact on later healthy relationships) and insecurity, which has more subcategories. Recently, some researchers have spoken in favour of a more dimensional model of attachment characteristics rather than a categorical one. The purpose of this study, which is empirically an improvement of our previous pilot study, was to contribute to existing research work about the relationship between early attachment to father and mother and the attachment to God and Mary in later stages of life. In literature and in some studies, this relationship is not quite clear, two hypotheses exist: the correspondence hypothesis (the relationship with God is similar or corresponds to the attachment to early caregivers) and the compensation hypothesis (the lack of quality in an early relationship is substituted with a quality relationship with God). Appropriate research about other religious beings (like Mary) is also lacking. In our study, 120 participants from different groups with a Catholic background were included. Similar to as our previous pilot study, that had smaller sample and participants that were less representative of the general catholic population in our cultural environment, this study suggest that according to the results, the majority of participants established a secure attachment with God and Mary. In the part where participants classified themselves in one attachment category we did not find any important correlation between the attachment to the father and mother on the one hand and the attachment to God and Mary on the other. Where participants assessed how much each attachment style (characteristic) holds for them, the results suggest that the attachment to one 2 ̆ 7 s father and mother in childhood can partly explain the attachment to God and Mary in adulthood. This is the case in some insecure (avoidant, ambivalent/anxious) characteristics of attachment. In these attachments there seems to be even more important connections, as we concluded from our pilot study. The results suggest that there is a trend that participants form a similar attachment relationship with God and Mary as the kind of attachment they had in their childhood. Generally there are little higher correlations with the relationship with one 2 ̆ 7 s mother than with one 2 ̆ 7 s father. The highest correlations are between avoidant characteristics of attachment to the mother and all insecure characteristics of attachment to God and Mary, ranging from 0. 191 to 0. 358 (all six statistically significant). The correlations between avoidant characteristics of attachment to one 2 ̆ 7 s father and all insecure characteristics of an attachment to God and Mary range from 0. 040 to 0. 336 (three of them statistically significant). The results also suggest that attachment bonds to God and Mary are importantly independent from early relationships with parents and dependent also on other factors. According to the results, the characteristics of an attachment to God and the characteristics of an attachment to Mary are partly independent. The results further suggest that the answer to the question of correspondence or compensatory function of relations with God and Mary, is more complex and it is necessary to distinguish different types of attachments...|$|R
