The mallets, called balu, are wrapped tightly with strips of rubber <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>end</b> and are considered lighter and smaller than those balu used for the agung. The rubber ends of the balu are held between the opposing knobs of the gandingan and the player would use them to strike the knobs to achieve a sound.|$|E

The molecular structure characterization is consistent with data from elemental and spectroscopic analysis. The materials thermal behaviour and phase characterization have been investigated by differential scanning calorimetry and polarizing microscopy. All the compounds exhibit a wide-ranging monotropic nematic phase...|$|R
5|$|The spores are 4–7 by 2–3µm, oblong-elliptical, smooth, and {{embedded}} in the gleba. A 1982 study revealed that spores of species in the Phallaceae family, including Mutinus elegans, have a hilar scar (0.2–0.3µm diameter) that is observable with scanning electron microscopy. The hilar scar is a circular indentation <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>end</b> of the spore, and it most likely results during {{the separation of the}} attachment of the spore to the sterigma of the basidium.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} {{a number of small}} items of {{uncertain}} function, described as toiletry pieces. Some are picks, others perhaps scrapers, and three have empty sockets <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>end,</b> which probably contained organic material such as bristle, to make a brush. The size of these would be appropriate for cleaning the teeth or applying cosmetics, among other possibilities.|$|E
5|$|Wynnea {{americana}} {{is distinguished}} from other {{species in the}} genus Wynnea by the pustules (small bumps) on the outer surface, and microscopically by the large asymmetrical longitudinally ribbed spores with a sharply pointed tip. The spores are made in structures called asci, which have thickened rings <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>end</b> that are capped by a hinged structure known as the operculum—a lid that is opened when spores are {{to be released from}} the ascus.|$|E

5|$|A delayed or {{deployable}} surface {{marker buoy}} (DSMB) is a soft inflatable tube which {{is attached to}} a reel or spool line <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>end,</b> and is inflated by the diver under water and released to float to the surface, deploying the line as it ascends. This provides information to the surface that the diver is about to ascend, and where he is. This equipment is commonly used by recreational and technical divers, and requires a certain level of skill to operate safely. They are mostly used to signal the boat that the diver has started ascent or to indicate a problem in technical diving.|$|E
5|$|A helical {{resonator}} {{is similar}} to a stub, in that it requires a distributed element model to represent it, but is actually built using lumped elements. They are built in a non-planar format and consist of a coil of wire, on a former and core, and connected only <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>end.</b> The device is usually in a shielded can with a hole in the top for adjusting the core. It will often look physically very similar to the lumped LC resonators used for a similar purpose. They are most useful in the upper VHF and lower UHF bands whereas stubs are more often applied in the higher UHF and SHF bands.|$|E
5|$|A more {{traditional}} Serbian nightlife experience, accompanied by traditional music known as Starogradska (roughly translated as Old Town Music), typical of northern Serbia's urban environments, is most prominent in Skadarlija, the city's old bohemian neighborhood where the poets and artists of Belgrade {{gathered in the}} 19th and early 20th centuries. Skadar Street (the centre of Skadarlija) and the surrounding neighbourhood are lined with some of Belgrade's best and oldest traditional restaurants (called kafanas in Serbian), which date back to that period. <b>At</b> <b>one</b> <b>end</b> of the neighbourhood stands Belgrade's oldest beer brewery, founded {{in the first half}} of the 19th century. One of the city's oldest kafanas is the Znak pitanja("?").|$|E

5|$|Budd built 361 Amfleet I coaches; 90 were {{configured}} for long-distance use (60 seats) and 271 for short-distance use (84 seats). All 125 Amfleet II {{coaches were}} designed for long-distance service and contained 59 seats. In all standard Amfleet coaches seating is 2×2; in the Amfleet II a single accessible seat accounted for the odd number. Amfleet seats have swing-down tray-tables for at-seat food service, as well as overhead and underseat luggage storage. There are two restrooms <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>end</b> of the car. There is a baggage rack {{at the end of}} the car. On some cars these have been replaced with a bicycle rack.|$|E
5|$|Butterfly {{eggs are}} {{protected}} by a hard-ridged outer layer of shell, called the chorion. This is lined with a thin coating of wax which prevents the egg from drying out before the larva has had time to fully develop. Each egg contains a number of tiny funnel-shaped openings <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>end,</b> called micropyles; {{the purpose of these}} holes is to allow sperm to enter and fertilize the egg. Butterfly eggs vary greatly in size and shape between species, but are usually upright and finely sculptured. Some species lay eggs singly, others in batches. Many females produce between one hundred and two hundred eggs.|$|E
5|$|I {{loved the}} Spitfire {{in all of}} her many versions. But I {{have to admit that}} the later marks, {{although}} they were faster than the earlier ones, were also much heavier and so did not handle so well. You did not have such positive control over them. One test of manoeuvrability was to throw her into a flick-roll and see how many times she rolled. With the Mark II or the Mark V one got two-and-a-half flick-rolls but the Mark IX was heavier and you got only one-and-a-half. With the later and still heavier versions, one got even less. The essence of aircraft design is compromise, and an improvement <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>end</b> of the performance envelope is rarely achieved without a deterioration somewhere else.|$|E

The treaty itself was probably signed in a campaign tent. The current bridge was built in 1836, replacing the earlier bridge which was also alongside King John's Castle. The bridge now forms part of the R445 (formerly N7), carrying traffic on the Northern Relief Road.|$|R
