40|$|SAW {{devices have}} found wide {{application}} in sensors for detection in gas and liquid environment [1, 2]. In liquid environment, Rayleigh surface waves have a displacement component {{perpendicular to the}} substrate where exist a compressional waves leading to a strong radiation loss [3]. For this reason, shear horizontal (SH) polarized waves are preferred {{because they do not}} couple elastically with ideal liquids and make no radiation loss [3 - 5]. SH modes can be converted into Love modes by means of a layer acting as a guide. The basic structure of Love wave devices is illustrated in Fig. 1. Due to the waveguide effect, Love waves will be very sensitive to surface perturbations and high sensitivity to surface loading can be achieved. The condition for the existence of Love wave modes is that the shear velocity of the overlay material is less than that of the substrate [3]. Leaky waves of 64 ° YX-LiNbO 3 [6] have been utilized as substrates because of the large electromechanical coupling coefficient (k 2 = 11. 3 %), fast shear velocity (4478 m/s) and negative temperature coefficient of frequency (TCF) [7].

40|$|Two {{innovative}} fan-noise reduction concepts {{developed by}} NASA are presented - soft vanes and over-the-rotor metal foam liners. Design methodologies are described for each concept. Soft vanes are outlet guide vanes with internal, resonant chambers that {{communicate with the}} exterior aeroacoustic environment via a porous surface. They provide <b>acoustic</b> <b>absorption</b> via viscous <b>losses</b> generated by interaction of unsteady flows with the internal solid structure. Over-the-rotor metal foam liners installed {{at or near the}} fan rotor axial plane provide rotor noise absorption. Both concepts also provide pressure-release surfaces that potentially inhibit noise generation. Several configurations for both concepts are evaluated with a normal incidence tube, and the results are used to guide designs for implementation in two NASA fan rigs. For soft vanes, approximately 1 to 2 dB of broadband inlet and aft-radiated fan noise reduction is achieved. For over-the-rotor metal foam liners, up to 3 dB of fan noise reduction is measured in the low-speed fan rig, but minimal reduction is measured in the high-speed fan rig. These metal foam liner results are compared with a static engine test, in which inlet sound power level reductions up to 5 dB were measured.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a model to}} predict the <b>acoustic</b> <b>absorption</b> of Enhanced Porosity Concrete (EPC). The <b>acoustic</b> <b>absorption</b> coefficient was determined experimentally using an impedance tube, while an electro-acoustic analogy was implemented to develop the predictive model, considering the pore structure of EPC {{as a series of}} resistors and inductors. The physical features of the pore network were experimentally characterized using image analysis and a pore volume characterization technique. A parameter termed “structure factor ” was introduced to account for the increased density of air that is not displaced by the acoustic wave pressure.

40|$|The {{current study}} is a bibliographic {{observation}} on prevailing tendencies {{in the development of}} <b>acoustic</b> <b>absorption</b> by natural fiber composites. Despite having less detrimental environmental effects and thorough availability, natural fibers are still unsuitable for wide implementation in industrial purposes.

The review indicates the importance of the pretreatment of fresh natural fiber to overcome these shortcomings.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This work {{is concerned with the}} fluid dynamic processes and the associated loss of acoustic energy produced by circular apertures within noise absorbing perforated walls. Although applicable {{to a wide range of}} engineering applications particular emphasis in this work is placed on the use of such features within a gas turbine combustion system. The primary aim for noise absorbers in gas turbine combustion systems is the elimination of thermo-acoustic instabilities, which are characterised by rapidly rising pressure amplitudes which are potentially damaging to the combustion system components. By increasing the amount of acoustic energy being absorbed the occurrence of thermo-acoustic instabilities can be avoided. The fundamental acoustic characteristics relating to linear <b>acoustic</b> <b>absorption</b> are presented. It is shown that changes in orifice geometry, in terms of gas turbine combustion system representative length-to-diameter ratios, result in changes in the measured Rayleigh Conductivity. Furthermore in the linear regime the maximum possible <b>acoustic</b> energy <b>absorption</b> for a given cooling mass flow budget of a conventional combustor wall will be identified. An investigation into current Rayleigh Conductivity and aperture impedance (1 D) modelling techniques are assessed and the ranges of validity for these modelling techniques will be identified. Moreover possible improvements to the modelling techniques are discussed. Within a gas turbine system absorption can also occur in the non-linear operating regime. Hence the influence of the orifice geometry upon the optimum non-linear <b>acoustic</b> <b>absorption</b> is also investigated. Furthermore the performance of non-linear <b>acoustic</b> <b>absorption</b> modelling techniques is evaluated against the conducted measurements. As the amplitudes within the combustion system increase the <b>acoustic</b> <b>absorption</b> will transition from the linear to the non-linear regime. This is important for the design of absorbers or cooling geometries for gas turbine combustion systems as the propensity for hot gas ingestion increases. Hence the relevant parameters and phenomena are investigated during the transition process from linear to non-linear <b>acoustic</b> <b>absorption.</b> The unsteady velocity field during linear and non-linear <b>acoustic</b> <b>absorption</b> is captured using particle image velocimetry. A novel analysis technique is developed which enables the identification of the unsteady flow field associated with the <b>acoustic</b> <b>absorption.</b> In this way an investigation into the relevant mechanisms within the unsteady flow fields to describe the <b>acoustic</b> <b>absorption</b> behaviour of the investigated orifice plates is conducted. This methodology will also help in the development and optimisation of future damping systems and provide validation for more sophisticated 3 D numerical modelling methods. Finally a set of design tools developed during this work will be discussed which enable a comprehensive preliminary design of non-resonant and resonant acoustic absorbers with multiple perforated liners within a gas turbine combustion system. The tool set is applied to assess the impact of the gas turbine combustion system space envelope, complex swirling flow fields and the propensity to hot gas ingestion in the preliminary design stages...|$|R

This study presents an experimental investigation on pure porous from Date Palm Fibre (DPF). The effectiveness of sound absorbers depends on structural architecture of this material. This study was conducted to examine the potential of using date palm fibre as sound absorber. The effects of porous layer thicknesses, densities and compression on <b>Acoustic</b> <b>Absorption</b> Coefficient (AAC) of sound absorber using date palm fibre were studied. Approach: Rigid frame Johnson-Allard Model for various sample thicknesses was used in this study. The measurements were conducted in impedance tube on normal incidence <b>acoustic</b> <b>absorption.</b> The date palm fibre was mixed with latex which used for physical treatment on this material. <b>Acoustic</b> <b>absorption</b> behaviour of a porous material with different thicknesses was studied as well as samples with same thickness but different densities. In addition, samples with same properties but different period of compression time were inspected. The tests were in accordance to ISO 10534 - 2 and ASTM E 1050 - 98 international standards for <b>Acoustic</b> <b>Absorption</b> Coefficient (AAC). Results: The experimental data indicates that two peak values of AAC is 0. 93 at 1356 Hz for sample with 50 mm thickness, also the AAC at high frequency for same thickness is 0. 99 at 4200 - 4353 Hz that means able to improve <b>acoustic</b> <b>absorption</b> coefficient at low and high frequencies with significant increasing. Meanwhile, another experimental results were acquired for AAC of date palm fibre, with samples thicknesses of 35 mm at different densities. The results show that denser sample (11 Kg m - 3) has higher AAC value of 0. 83 at 1934 - 2250 Hz as compared to less dense sample (9. 92 Kg m - 3) with AAC value 0. 84 at 2443 - 2587 Hz. Conclusion: <b>Acoustic</b> <b>absorption</b> coefficient AAC of date palm fibre was increased at all frequencies when the thickness of sample was increased, particularly at low frequencies less than 1200 Hz. The introduction of latex on the samples adds stiffness, so that sound can be dissipated significantly as it travels through material.
