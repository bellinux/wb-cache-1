5|$|Due to the {{cancellation}} of Sonic X-treme, the Saturn lacks an exclusive Sonic the Hedgehog platformer, containing only a graphically enhanced port of the Genesis title Sonic 3D Blast, the compilation Sonic Jam, and a racing game called Sonic R. The platformer Bug! received attention for its eponymous main character being a potential mascot for the Saturn, but it failed to catch on as the Sonic series had. Considered {{one of the most}} important Saturn releases, Sonic Team developed Nights into Dreams, a score attack game that attempted to simulate both the joy of flying and the fleeting sensation of dreams. The gameplay of Nights involves steering the imp-like androgynous protagonist, Nights, as it flies on a mostly 2D plane across surreal stages broken into four segments each. The levels repeat for as long as an in-game time limit allows, while flying over or looping around various objects in rapid succession earns additional points. Although it lacked the fully 3D environments of Nintendo's Super Mario 64, Nights emphasis on unfettered movement and graceful acrobatic techniques showcased the intuitive potential of <b>analog</b> <b>control.</b> Sonic Team's Burning Rangers, a fully 3D action-adventure game involving a team of outer-space firefighters, garnered praise for its transparency effects and distinctive art direction, but was released in limited quantities late in the Saturn's lifespan and criticized for its short length.|$|E

The US has also announced its intent to supply an unspecified number of Ravens to the Ukrainian armed forces. Ukrainian operators criticized the Raven's <b>analog</b> <b>control</b> system that made them vulnerable to jamming and hacking by sophisticated Russian-backed separatists.|$|E
25|$|Stepper motors {{were and}} still are often used in {{computer}} printers, optical scanners, and digital photocopiers to move the optical scanning element, the print head carriage (of dot matrix and inkjet printers), and the platen or feed rollers. Likewise, many computer plotters (which since the early 1990s have been replaced with large-format inkjet and laser printers) used rotary stepper motors for pen and platen movement; the typical alternatives here were either linear stepper motors or servomotors with closed-loop <b>analog</b> <b>control</b> systems.|$|E

25|$|Nintendo {{released}} Super Mario 64 in 1996. Before then, {{there was}} no established paradigm for bringing platform games into 3D. Mario 64 set a new standard, and it was imitated by many subsequent 3D platformers. Its gameplay allowed players to explore open 3D environments with greater freedom than any previous attempt at a 3D platform game. To aid this, Nintendo added an <b>analog</b> <b>control</b> stick to its Nintendo 64 controller, something which had not been included in a standard console controller since the Vectrex, and which has since become standard on other controllers. This allowed for the finer precision needed for a free perspective. Players no longer followed a linear path {{to the ends of}} levels, either, with most levels providing objective-based goals. There were a handful of boss levels that offered more traditional platforming.|$|E
25|$|In March 1999, Game Art's Japanese {{publisher}} ESP Software showcased a PlayStation {{version of}} Grandia at that year's Tokyo Game Show expo, along with confirmation {{that the game}} would be released in English {{for the first time}} in North America by Sony Computer Entertainment America. Working Designs, which had previously worked with Game Arts on bringing their Lunar games to the region, had expressed interest in publishing the game, but were ultimately unable to secure the rights. New features for the PlayStation version included support for the system's DualShock <b>analog</b> <b>control</b> sticks and vibration function, as well as compatibility with Sony's Japanese-only PocketStation peripheral, which allows players to download game data on a portable device for use in a special mini-game. Although the company had expressed interest in bringing the game to the PlayStation as early as 1998, technical problems originally prevented the title from being ported to the system. Game Arts was later able to release the game with a slight loss in frame rate and a marginal decrease in video effects the following June. The North American version was originally announced by Sony as a summer release during the 1999 Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles, but was pushed back to the following October. Grandia was later released for the PlayStation in Europe in 2000 by Ubisoft.|$|E
500|$|After {{its initial}} release for the PlayStation in January 1998, Resident Evil 2 was reissued and ported to other systems, often gaining new {{features}} in the process. The first re-release was the Dual Shock Ver., which incorporated support for the vibration and <b>analog</b> <b>control</b> functions of the PlayStation's DualShock controller. Other additions include a new unlockable minigame called [...] "Extreme Battle", and a [...] "Rookie" [...] mode that enables the player to start the main story with a powerful weapon that features infinite ammunition. The Japanese release of the Dual Shock Ver. contained a [...] "U.S.A. Version" [...] mode based on the difficulty level of Resident Evil 2s Western versions.|$|E
50|$|Also of note is {{that for}} the first time in the Armored Core series, <b>analog</b> <b>controls</b> are supported. While Armored Core 2 did use the analog stick buttons (L3 and R3) on the DualShock 2, player control was still based on the D-pad and {{whatever}} other buttons were mapped to view/motion control.|$|R
50|$|In the past, most {{adjustments}} on TV {{sets were}} performed with <b>analog</b> <b>controls</b> such as potentiometers and switches. This was used more recently also in monochrome portable TVs. After remote controls were invented, digital adjustments became common. They needed an external display, which was LED, LCD, or VFD based.

500|$|Croc: Legend of the Gobbos was {{programmed}} using {{a proprietary}} BASIC-like language called the Argonaut Strategy Language, while the levels and mechanics were created using an in-house level editor titled [...] "CrocEd" [...] which was run using MS-DOS. The engine for Croc {{went on to}} be repurposed by Argonaut for several of their other games, including , Disney's Aladdin in Nasira's Revenge, and Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. Although Croc supported use of the DualShock controller's analog stick for movement, the controller wasn't released until late into the game's production and the game was mostly developed with directional pad control in mind; {{as a result of}} this, <b>analog</b> <b>control</b> was implemented into the game fairly late in its development.|$|E
500|$|Other {{criticism}} {{focused on}} the game's controls and multiplayer mode. Theobald felt {{the lack of an}} analog stick made the controls more difficult than the original game and required a short period of adjustment. He further stated that the digital pad and touchscreen's virtual <b>analog</b> <b>control</b> were [...] "tricky" [...] and required practice. Harris echoed similar comments and noted the touchscreen does not provide physical feedback like an analog stick. He added the game was never intended to be played without proper analog controls. Gerstmann referred to the multiplayer mode as [...] "uneventful" [...] and considered it lacking longevity, but commented {{that it was a good}} extra that demonstrated the system's wireless multiplayer capabilities. Theobald agreed it was a nice addition, but considered it a [...] "diversion" [...] that players would tire of quickly.|$|E
500|$|Reviews for {{the first}} {{versions}} of the game that did not use a touch-screen, the PlayStation 3/PSP version and the Windows version, have also been positive, but with some disagreement over the different interfaces. Will Greenwald of PC Magazine, in his review of the PlayStation Network version, said that the control scheme on these platforms is good, [...] "but they're not nearly as satisfying as the touch-screen controls found on smartphone versions", and that the PlayStation 3 version appeared [...] "blocky and unpleasant, like a smartphone screen blown up to HDTV size". Conversely, Greg Miller of IGN preferred the <b>analog</b> <b>control</b> setup of the PSP version, saying it [...] "offered me tiny variances in control that I don't feel like I get with my fat finger on a screen". While giving the game a positive review, Miller concluded, [...] "There's no denying that Angry Birds is fun, but it could use polish – such as sharper visuals, a better price and smoother action." [...] Damien McFerrin of British website Electric Pig reviewed the PC version, saying [...] "the mouse-driven control method showcases many distinct advantages over its finger-focused counterpart".|$|E

GameSpot praised the game's art design {{in a time}} when three-dimensional computer graphics were becoming more prominent, stating [...] "he title's relaxed and flowing tones are a pleasant breeze of creativity when compared with most titles' CG, polygons, and pixel-perfect graphics. The unique presentation is SaGa Frontier 2s greatest strength, triumphantly stating: There is still a place for two-dimensional graphics." [...] However, the website felt that the game may alienate fans of the original SaGa Frontier for taking too many liberties with gameplay and style, and that while players were still free to explore scenarios at their own pace, the game's story itself was more linear than the average SaGa title. SaGa Frontier 2s graphics were also praised by IGN who called the game [...] "beautiful" [...] with a [...] "romantic soundtrack that is of the utmost quality. But it isn't too memorable." [...] IGN's biggest problem with the title was its low replay value and weak presentation, which the website felt didn't take full advantage of the PlayStation's CD format by including an opening movie or character voices, ultimately calling it a [...] "slightly above average game". GamePro magazine called attention to the game's [...] "well organized" [...] menu system and responsive control which took advantage of the PlayStation's DualShock <b>analog</b> <b>control</b> sticks, as well as [...] "a solid story that is sure to please role-players and strategy fans alike." ...|$|E
500|$|The Legend of Zelda {{has been}} re-released on {{multiple}} platforms since its original {{domestic and international}} releases.
