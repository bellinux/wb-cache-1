40|$|Introductions to {{research}} articles (RAs) {{have become an}} important site {{for the analysis of}} academic writing. However, analysts have apparently not considered whether RA introductions typically include statements of principal findings. In contrast, this issue is often addressed in the manuals and style guides surveyed, most advocating the desirability of <b>announcing</b> <b>principal</b> <b>findings</b> (APFs) in RA introductions. Therefore, a study of actual practice in two leading journals from two different fields (physics and educational psychology) was undertaken. In the Physical Review 45 % of the introductions sampled contained APFs (with some increase in percentage over the last 40 years), while in the Journal of Educational Psychology the percentage fell to under 7 %. These figures are at variance with the general trend of recommendations in primary and secondary sources. Thus preliminary evidence points to (a) a mismatch between descriptive practice and prescriptive advice and (b) diversity in this rhetorical feature between the two fields...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{following}} studies was to explore the effect of systemic vascular and endothelial dysfunction upon the ocular circulation and functionality of the retina. There are 6 principal sections to the present work. Retinal vessel activity in smokers and non-smokers: the <b>principal</b> <b>findings</b> of this work were: chronic smoking affects retinal vessel motion at baseline and during stimulation with flickering light; chronic smoking leads to a vaso-constrictory shift in retinal arteriolar reactivity to flicker; retinal arteriolar elasticity is decreased in chronic smokers. The effect of acute smoking on retinal vessel dynamics in smokers and non-smokers: the <b>principal</b> <b>finding</b> of this work was that retinal reactivity in chronic smokers is blunted when exposed to clicker light provocation immediately after smoking one cigarette. Ocular blood flow in coronary artery disease: The <b>principal</b> <b>findings</b> of this work were: retrobulbar and retinal blood flow is preserved in CAD patients, despite a change pulse wave transmission; arterial retinal response to flickering light provocation is significantly delayed in CAD patients; retinal venular diameters are significantly dilated in CAD patients. Autonomic nervous system function and peripheral circulation in CAD: The <b>principal</b> <b>findings</b> in this work were: CAD patients demonstrate a sympathetic overdrive during a 24 period; a delay in peripheral vascular reactivity (nail-fold capillaries) as observed in patients suffering from CAD could be caused by either arteriosclerotic changes of the vascular walls or due to systemic haemodynamic changes. Visual function in CAD: The <b>principal</b> <b>findings</b> in this work were: overall visual function in CAD patients is preserved, despite a decrease in contrast sensitivity; applying a filtering technique selecting those with greater coefficient of variance which in turn represents a decrease in reliability, some patients appear to have an impaired visual function as assessed using FDT visual field evaluation. Multiple functional, structural and biochemical vascular endothelial dysfunctions in patients suffering from CAD: relationships and possible implications: The <b>principal</b> <b>findings</b> of this work were: BMI significantly correlated with vWF (a marker of endothelial function) in CAD patients. Retinal vascular reactivity showed a significant correlation with peripheral reactivity parameters in controls which lacked in the CAD group and could reflect a loss in vascular endothelial integrity; visual field parameters as assessed by frequency doubling technology were strongly related with systemic vascular elasticity (ambulatory arterial stiffness index) in controls but not CAD patients.
