25|$|Meanwhile, the Hollandic army {{building}} a fortress at Ter Luine had {{the city of}} Groningen worried. In {{the first week of}} June the city asked the bishop of Utrecht and the IJssel cities of Deventer, Kampen, and Zwolle for military assistance. Furthermore, Groningen allied itself with the Schieringers in Hunsingo, Fivelgo and Oldambt, who were <b>afraid</b> <b>they</b> would be driven from their lands if the Hollanders - and with them the Vetkopers - won the day.|$|E
25|$|Even after {{crowning}} himself Emperor Wu, Liu Yu remained frugal. However, he did {{not care}} for education and trusted unsavory people. He felt that the nobility had too much power, so he tended to appoint the lower classes to government positions and gave military power to imperial kinsmen. Ironically, because the imperial kinsmen stabilized their military power and wished to gain political power, Emperor Wu was <b>afraid</b> <b>they</b> would have thoughts of usurping the throne. Thus, he also frequently killed his kinsmen.|$|E
25|$|The battle went on {{for some}} time with no clear victor, but the Syracusans {{eventually}} pushed the Athenian ships toward the coast, and the Athenian crews fled to the camp behind their wall. Demosthenes suggested that they man the ships again and attempt to force their way out, as now both fleets had lost about half their ships and Nicias agreed. The men themselves did not want to board the ship because they were <b>afraid.</b> <b>They</b> then decided to retreat by land. Hermocrates sent some supposed informers to the Athenians to falsely report that there were spies and roadblocks further inland, so the Athenians would be safer if they did not march away. Gylippus used this delay to build the roadblocks that did not yet exist, and the Syracusans burned or towed away the Athenian ships on the beach, so that they had no way off the island.|$|E

25|$|Dholes produce {{whistles}} {{resembling the}} calls of red foxes, sometimes rendered as coo-coo. How this sound is produced is unknown, {{though it is}} thought to help in coordinating the pack when travelling through thick brush. When attacking prey, they emit screaming KaKaKaKAA sounds. Other sounds include whines (food soliciting), growls (warning), screams, chatterings (both of which are alarm calls) and yapping cries. In contrast to wolves, dholes do not howl or bark. Dholes have a complex body language. Friendly or submissive greetings are accompanied by horizontal lip retraction and the lowering of the tail, as well as licking. Playful dholes open their mouths with their lips retracted and their tails held in a vertical position whilst assuming a play bow. Aggressive or threatening dholes pucker their lips forward in a snarl and raise the hairs on their backs, as well as keep their tails horizontal or vertical. When <b>afraid,</b> <b>they</b> pull their lips back horizontally with their tails tucked and their ears flat against the skull.|$|E
25|$|Adult sloth bears may {{travel in}} pairs, with the males being gentle with cubs. They may fight for food. They {{walk in a}} slow, shambling motion, with their feet being set down in a noisy, {{flapping}} motion. They are capable of galloping faster than running humans. Although they appear slow and clumsy, both young and adult sloth bears are excellent climbers. They climb to feed and to rest, though not to escape enemies, as they prefer to stand their ground. Sloth bear mothers carry cubs up to 9 months old on their backs instead of sending their cubs up trees as the primary defense against attacks by predators, such as tigers, leopards, and other bears. They are capable of climbing on smooth surfaces and hanging upside down like sloths. They are good swimmers, and primarily enter water to play. To mark their territories, sloth bears scrape trees with their forepaws, and rub against them with their flanks. Sloth bears have a great vocal range. Gary Brown, in his Great Bear Almanac, lists over 25 different sounds in 16 different contexts. Sounds such as barks, screams, grunts, roars, snarls, whickers, woofs, and yelps are made when angered, threatening, or when fighting. When hurt or <b>afraid,</b> <b>they</b> shriek, yowl, or whimper. When feeding, sloth bears make loud huffing and sucking noises, which can be heard over 100 m away. Sounds such as gurgling or humming are made by bears resting or sucking their paws. Sows emit crooning sounds to their cubs. The species is the most vociferous when mating, and make loud, melodious calls when doing so. Sloth bears do not hibernate. They make their day beds out of broken branches in trees, and rest in caves during the wet season. Sloth bears are the most nocturnal of bears, though sows become more active in daytime when with cubs.|$|E

500|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} in a new recording studio built in a warehouse in Northridge, California, named Studio 606 West {{in contrast to the}} original Studio 606 in Grohl's basement in Alexandria, Virginia. Development for In Your Honor took nine months with three and a half months installing equipment in the studio, and songs being written throughout 2004. While waiting for 606 to get finished, the band rehearsed on North Hollywood's Mates Rehearsal Studios, where [...] "we ended up with three or four different versions of about 30 songs", according to Raskulinecz who added that [...] "it {{got to the point where}} I didn't want them to play the rock songs anymore.

500|$|Sam Dotson, {{chief of}} the St. Louis Police Department, coined the term [...] "Ferguson effect" [...] to {{describe}} what he believed was a change in enforcement behavior following the shooting of Michael Brown and subsequent unrest. According to Dotson, his officers were less active in enforcing the law because they were <b>afraid</b> <b>they</b> might be charged with breaking the law. FBI Director James Comey suggested that the Black Lives Matter movement is partly leading to a national rise in crime rates because police officers have pulled back from doing their jobs. A study published by the Justice Department, said {{there was an increase}} in homicides in 56 large cities over the course of 2015, and examined the [...] "Ferguson effect" [...] as one of three plausible explanations. Other researchers have looked for this [...] "Ferguson effect" [...] in the rise in crime rates and failed to find evidence for it on a national level. A report over the increased homicide rate in St. Louis concluded there was an [...] "absence of credible and comprehensive evidence" [...] for the Ferguson effect being responsible for that city's homicide increase.|$|E
500|$|... is a 14-year-old boy who is {{an exile}} {{at the start of}} Final Fantasy XIII. At the {{beginning}} of the game, Hope and his mother Nora, on vacation in the town of Bodhum, are selected for the Purge. Under Snow's leadership, Nora joins the resistance in the Hanging Edge, but falls to her death during the battle while trying to protect Hope and after saving Snow's life: this event angers Hope greatly. After he becomes a l'Cie, and being separated from the main party, Hope follows Lightning while plotting his assassination attempt on Snow. Despite Lightning's objections, Hope tries to kill Snow once he gets him alone, but after coming to the realization that he had just been blaming Snow to cope with his mother's death, they settle their differences. When Hope returns home to his father, Bartholomew, he tells him what happened to Nora and repairs their relationship. When on Gran Pulse, he tells the others to leave him, <b>afraid</b> <b>they</b> will get hurt because of him, but inadvertently summons his Eidolon Alexander. After the defeat of Orphan, Hope tells Lightning that Fang and Vanille had changed their fate by fulfilling their Focus of transforming into Ragnarok to save Cocoon rather than destroying it.|$|E

500|$|Jim calls Wallace {{to pitch}} for the CEO {{to invest in}} Athlead. Dwight puts the {{conversation}} on speaker phone, allowing him to hear Wallace first tell Jim his salary {{is going to be}} cut to reflect his part-time status, and then bluntly shoot down the idea of investing in Athlead. Dwight, though praising his friends' outlandish delinquent behavior to the cameras, gradually comes to realize his professional integrity will not allow him to hire any of them, and sadly notes that he outgrew all of his friends in just three hours. <b>Afraid</b> <b>they</b> will hate him if he does not pick one of them, he asks Jim to pretend to take over the hiring decision and make the call to hire no one. Being willing to do anything to save Pam from being stuck with an unbearable deskmate, Jim agrees. However, when Jim announces the decision, Rolf immediately intuits that Dwight is using Jim as a scapegoat. Dwight's friends storm off to play paintball without him, later sending an e-mail with a photo of their paintball outing and the message [...] "Glad you're not here". Clark gets the salesman job. Pam is grateful to Jim for arranging this but says she still misses her [...] "old deskmate", i.e. Jim. Pam briefly lifts Dwight's spirits by suggesting they [...] "haze the new guy", though she makes Dwight stop that plan when he nearly suffocates Clark with shrink wrap. It is also hinted that Brian (Chris Diamantopoulos), the boom mike operator for the documentary crew, has developed a crush on Pam.|$|E

After Jesus entered the ship, the wind ceased, and they arrived at land.|$|E

[...] However many mothers skipped meals or did odd jobs to cover those expenses. According to Edin, for [...] "most welfare-reliant mothers food and shelter alone cost almost as much as these mothers received from the government.
