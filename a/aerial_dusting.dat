40|$|An {{experimental}} {{approach has}} been used to establish whether medieval ironworking activity could be identified in peat bogs using mineral magnetic measurements. The research project comprised three elements. First, magnetic susceptibility and remanence properties were obtained for materials from an experimental iron smelt, in a furnace of medieval design, and from material collected during the excavation of the medieval bloomery at Llwyn Du in Coed y Brenin, Snowdonia. Materials sampled and measured included charcoal, <b>aerial</b> <b>dust,</b> roasted bog ore and furnace dust. A second experiment determined whether small amounts of <b>aerial</b> <b>dust</b> released from the furnace could be detected in accumulating peat samples. This was achieved by sprinkling small quantities of dust on to a constructed ’peat core’ that had no detectable magnetic signature prior to the addition of the dust. The application rates used were within the range expected to fall on a peat bog located close to a medieval furnace. Thirdly, mineral magnetic measurements were made on a peat core collected close to the Llwyn Du bloomery. The results confirm that roasted bog ore, <b>aerial</b> <b>dust</b> released from and dust accumulating in the furnace after a smelt, are magnetically detectable. The <b>aerial</b> <b>dust</b> and roasted bog ore produced enhanced susceptibility and remanence signatures in the constructed ’peat core’ experiments. Peaks in IRM(0. 88 T) and HIRM were measured in the Llwyn Du peat monolith and appear to correlate with a time when the medieval bloomery was operational. The results presented here suggest {{that it is possible to}} identify evidence of past ironworking in peat bogs using mineral magnetic measurements and that the signatures remain well preserved in the peat record even after burial for several hundred year...|$|R
40|$|Eleven {{finishing}} {{units were}} surveyed {{to study the}} characteristics of <b>aerial</b> <b>dust</b> and factors that influence dust concentrations. Feed dust was the major portion of the total dust mass and can be minimized with feed additives, less feed wastage, enclosed feed delivery, and periodic cleaning. Ventilation was the primary method for dust removal. Naturally ventilated buildings had higher dust concentrations than mechanically ventilated buildings because of lower average airflow rates, especially during cold weather. Swine workers can minimize respiratory symptoms by wearing face masks...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. <b>Aerial</b> <b>dust</b> {{originating}} from feed {{is a major}} contributor to poor air quality in swine confinement buildings. Studies have shown that addition of fats and oils to swine feed reduces its dustiness. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effectiveness of several high–oil corn (HOC) varieties on reducing aerodynamic dust segregation (ADS) as compared with conventional or normal corn (NC) as ground corn only and also as the base ingredient of typical feed rations. Comparisons were also made between HOC–based feed with NC–based feed with 0. 5 % to 2. 0 % soybean oil. Experiments were conducted using a laboratory apparatus designed to measure ADS based on both mass (ADSm) and number (ADSn). The ADSm was defined as the percentage of mass lost by entrainment into the air by dropping a sample through a vertical tube. The ADSn was defined as the particle number concentration in a 235 –mL air sample drawn from the tube 100 s after dropping the ground corn or feed sample. One of the single–cross HOC varieties produced only 19 % (P < 0. 05) of the ADSn of a NC variety and only 27 % to 28 % of the TopCross HOC varieties. Feed with the single–cross HOC was significantly less dusty than NC–based feed. The ADSn of feed with HOC was not significantly different from that of feed with NC amended with soybean oil...|$|R

The number concentration of aerial particles {{was measured using}} a counter which sizes the total numbers in 5 categories: from 0. 3 - 0. 5 mum to > 5 mum. The mean dust concentrations were significantly higher in the farrowing houses than in the fattening houses (179 +/- 91 vs 97 +/- 65 particles/ml). Over a 24 -h period, the ratio between the highest and the lowest hourly concentrations was 3 +/- 1 in the farrowing houses and 5 +/- 4 in the fattening houses; {{the difference between the}} 2 types of houses is significant. The smallest particles were the most numerous; 82 % of the aerial particles were in the size range 0. 3 - 0. 5 mum, with less than 1 % being 5 mum or larger. During the most polluted hours, there was proportionally more particles in the size range 0. 5 - 1 mum and significantly less particles in the size ranges 1 - 2 mum and 2 - 5 mum, as compared to the less polluted hours. This study shows that most of the aerial particles in piggeries are smaller than 5 mum, the size below which deposition is regarded to occur in the lower respiratory tract, the farrowing houses being more polluted than the fattening houses.

5000|$|Delta's origins can {{be traced}} to a {{decision}} by B. R. Coad and Collett E. Woolman. Coad was an employee of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's field laboratory in Tallulah, Louisiana; Woolman was with its extension service. They worked on finding a solution to the boll weevil infestation of cotton crops and concluded that the [...] "dusting" [...] of an insecticide powder from the air would be the most effective form of treatment. From this decision, Huff Daland Dusters Incorporated was born. It was founded on May 30, 1924, in Macon, Georgia, and became the world's first <b>aerial</b> crop <b>dusting</b> company. The company moved to Monroe, Louisiana, in 1925. Woolman left his position with the extension service and in the off-season traveled with the company to Peru, where they helped to establish crop-dusting and passenger services. With this experience, Woolman returned to the United States and in 1928 raised the capital to buy Huff Daland, purchasing it on September 13, 1928, and renaming the company Delta Air Service, with its headquarters in Monroe. The name Delta, referring to the Mississippi Delta, was suggested by Catherine Fitzgerald, a secretary who later would rise to the rank of an executive in the company.|$|R

40|$|Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) {{is still}} used in Africa for the indoor control of malaria {{and it may}} {{represent}} a potential hazard for wildlife. The littoral sediments of two alkaline-saline lakes, Natron (Tanzania) and Bogoria (Kenya), in the Eastern Rift Valley, supporting large populations of lesser flamingos (Phoeniconaias minor), were analysed for DDT residues. Physical–chemical analyses (temperature, conductivity, pH and dissolved oxygen) were also performed on {{the water of the}} two lakes and in the tributaries of Lake Natron, to evaluate the influence of the environmental variables on pollutant occurrence. At Lake Natron, around 1 km from the sediment collection sites, tree leaves ofAcacia tortiliswere also collected. The main metabolite found in all sediment samples was pp’DDE, whilst equal concentrations of pp’DDT and pp’DDE were measured in acacia leaves. The levels of DDTs measured in the sediments were within 5. 9 – 30. 9 ngg− 1 d. w., reaching the maximum value in a tributary of Lake Natron. On the whole, the contamination of Lake Natron and Lake Bogoria basins seems to be quite moderate. Nevertheless, the pp’DDE/pp’DDT ratio equals 1 in theAcacia tortilisleaves, which makes one suppose that the input of the parent compound was rather recent and could have been from <b>aerial</b> transport or <b>dust</b> from relatively close-by old pesticides storage sites...|$|R
40|$|M. Sc. The main aim of {{this study}} is to give input {{concerning}} the compilation of the Environmental Management Programme (EMP) as part of the requirements by the Department of Minerals and Energy (DME) to develop a Standard EMP for the quarrying of aggregate resources. This study is based on first hand experience gained from the compilation of EMPs for the N- 3 Toll Road aggregate quarry operations, with specific reference to the Vlakfontein Quarry. This study is important because the quarrying of aggregate resources has been identified as a mining activity which requires a different approach to that of the established Environmental Management Programme Report (EMPR) procedures, based on the Aide-Mernoire for the preparation of EMPRs. The provision of specific and detailed management requirements in the proposed Generic EMP, aims at the prevention or pro-active minimisation of the impacts associated with the quarrying of aggregate resources and subsequently ensures a common standard in environmental management, acknowledging activity-specific circumstances. It must be stressed however, that the study should not be viewed as a guideline document, isolated from other accepted guidelines for the compilation of EMPs for the mining industry. It is indeed based on the same objectives and principles as, inter alia the Aide-Memoire and the Mining Environmental Management Guideline for Planning and Authorization, and should form part of the guidelines for the preparation, compilation and implementation of EMP's for the mining industry. Furthermore, the Generic EMP for the quarrying of aggregate resources as proposed in this study should only be used in the following instances: where the exploitation of aggregate resources (minerals) are by means of the open-cast mining method; and in circumstances where not more than 600 000 tons of ore are removed per annum (including the overburden) and/or when the total area disturbed by mining activities is restricted to approximately 10 hectare at closure. The Generic EMP was developed from aspects identified in the Environmental Assessment for the Vlakfontein Quarry, which were conducted during the planning phase of the N- 3 Toll Road Project, and impacts identified through extensive literature studies. The Generic EMP was compiled around the following: Visual Intrusion Take of land Solid Waste Disposal <b>Aerial</b> And <b>Dust</b> Pollution Water Pollution, and Noise and Vibration. Shortcomings concerning the guidelines for the compilation of EMPs were analysed and studied, and guidelines in the form of a Generic EMP for the quarrying of aggregate resources were prescribed. The compilation and implementation of the methods and guidelines in this study, thus plays an important role in the future compilation of EMPs for the quarrying of aggregate resources and the environment related to such quarries...|$|R
