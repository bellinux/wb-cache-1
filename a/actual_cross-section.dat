40|$|Rock glaciers are dynamic landforms and, as such, exhibit {{interesting}} and welldeveloped structural features, which translate to surface morphology {{in the form}} of ridges and furrows. These distinguishing features have led researchers to study the physics behind the movement and internal deformation of rock glaciers. For years researchers had no access to the internal makeup of rock glaciers. Thus, proposed models and discussion have been based on theoretical concepts of electromagnetic (EM) wave propogation. With the application of ground penetrating radar (GPR) to provide a view of the interior structure of a rock glacier, researchers had ?real? data to verify their models. However, no comparison has been made between a GPR profile and an <b>actual</b> <b>cross-section</b> of a rock glacier. The purpose of this thesis is to validate the fidelity of GPR in showing the actual structure of a rock glacier. A trench that was excavated through the toe of a rock glacier on Mount Mestas in south central Colorado provided a view of the actual structure of the landform. The structure in the trench was compared with GPR and EM data. The GPR study was conducted using a PulsEKKOTM 100 A subsurface imaging radar with 25, 50, and 100 MHz antennas, to detect dielectric contrasts within the rock glacier. A frequency domain EM 34 by Geonics LtdTM was also used to supplement the GPR data by measuring the rock glacier?s conductivity at various depths. This thesis proved, by utilizing statistics, that GPR is a useful tool in visualizing the interior structure of rock glaciers. The 100 MHz antennas clearly show small scale reflection horizons caused by changes in clast orientation and subsurface material composition. These events coincide with structures seen in the trench. Individual clasts greater than 0. 375 m were also recognized as point sources in the GPR profiles. Large continuous bedding layers were observed with the 25 and 50 MHz antennas, which reflect the structure seen in the trench. A large scale thrust fault was also located with the GPR.

Flight is no exception though our conventional methods of flight seem to be completely devoid of any flapping modes commonly seen in insects and birds. This is because the unsteady characteristics of natures keen flight capabilities is very difficult to study. However, as our computational and experimental methods of investigation have improved, our imagination again begins to turn to this one aspect of flight that has eluded man thus far. Birds and more specifically insects are capable of flying at such slow speeds and on such small scales that man 2 ̆ 7 s understanding of aerodynamics begins to breakdown and fails to account for the force necessary for insects to fly. This has led to serious complications in the design of a small semi-autonomous flying robot or Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) that the military as well as a few civilian organizations have high interest in for multiple purposes. This thesis uses a user-defined computational Navier Stokes solver, called Vicar 3 d for reasons discussed within this thesis, as well as information from an experimental facility to test some basic concepts inherent to flapping foils such as the ability of the angle of attack to predict either interaction with the airfoil and the wake and/or the loads history. Also, whether the selection of the airfoils has any effect on the wake or loads history as well, mainstream flapping foil literature has mainly concentrated on using conventional airfoils commonly employed in fixed wing aircraft. It was the intention of the author of this thesis to test airfoils that were shaped from <b>actual</b> <b>cross-sections</b> of <b>actual</b> insect species as these foils have shown greater performance in static testing. Additionally, some interesting phenomena was discovered along the course of these studies and an unconventional type of flapping motion resulted that was studied to determine possible applications to MAVs with the motions 2 ̆ 7 higher performance capabilities. It was found that the existing definition of the effective angle of attack for a flapping foil is either erroneous or simply insufficient information to predict either wake interaction or loads history with no obvious relationship between the angle of attack and loads time traces. Finally, the proper selection of airfoil, most notably those inspired by wing cross sections from specific insect species has very little effect on the wake interaction, but oddly enough seems {{to have an impact on}} the lift generated. Comparing performance from these cross-sections to the performance of more conventional cross-sections showed considerable increases making them excellent candidates for future MAVs. Also the unconventional 2 ̆ 2 limp wrist 2 ̆ 2 motion that was discovered by doubling the frequency of the pitch over the plunge displayed favorable performance characteristics give an intelligent selection of the pivot point. Pivot points closer to the leading edge of the airfoil showed remarkable averaged thrust and lift coefficients and pivot points closer to the trailing edge of the airfoil showed very high values of lift, unfortunately also showed high values of drag as well. All conclusions seem to point to the fact that there is still much to be learned in this area of unsteady aeronautics as there seems to be hundreds of parameters and options to exercise...|$|R
40|$|Investigation {{works for}} the design of the Konjsko Tunnel with two pipes, part of the Split-Zagreb Motorway, {{provided}} relevant data on rock mass and soil properties for construction of the prognose engineering-geological longitudinal sections. West tunnel portals are situated in tectonically deformed and partly dynamically metamorphosed Eocene flysch marls, while east ones are located in Senonian limestones. There is an overthrust contact between flysch marls and limestones. With the beginning of the excavations, rock mass characteristics were regularly registered after each blasting and <b>actual</b> longitudinal engineering-geological <b>cross-sections</b> were constructed as well as cross-sections of the excavation face. There were some differences between prognosticated and registered sections since it was infeasible to accurately determine the dip of the overthrust plane that was at shallow depth below the tunnel grade line and also due to the occurrence of transversal faults that intersected the overthrust. Data collected before and during the tunnel construction complemented the knowledge on geological structure of the surroundings and physical-mechanical characteristics of strata (the paper is published in Croatian) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We aim to {{investigate}} {{the problem of the}} impact of lane occupation on urban road traffic capacity and vehicle queuing length. We successfully solve the degrees of impact of different lane occupation on the actual road capacity, the relationship among the vehicle queuing length and the <b>cross-section</b> <b>actual</b> capacity and traffic flow on upstream by the theories of speed-flow model and improved traditional cumulative reach-leaving model. Through the analysis of examples, we conclude that the model presented in this paper is reasonable and can be used in practice to solve the relevant problems. The lane occupation means the cross section of the traffic road becomes narrow because of the traffic accident, temporary roadside parking, work and other factors, which always lead to traffic jams. Because of the characteristics of traffic flow density, strong continuity on the city road, if a lane is occupied, it may reduce the road all the lanes of traffic capacity. Even though the time is very short, it may also be caused by traffic jams. If it is treated inappropriately, traffic jams would become terrible. In China, lane occupation is very common. To estimate correctly the influence degree of the city road traffic capacity due to the lane occupation, it will provide a theoretical basis for the traffic administrative department, on the correct guide vehicle, reasonable examination and approval work, set the curb parking and setting non harbor shaped bus station etc...|$|R
