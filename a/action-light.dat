5000|$|The film {{received}} {{a rating of}} 86% on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes. [...] Marc Savlov of The Austin Chronicle rated it 3/5 stars and called it [...] "a fine introduction to the Jackie Chan phenomenon" [...] that is less emotionally charged than the first film and less outlandish than the sequel. TV Guide rated it 4/5 stars and wrote that the film makes up for its lack of story and eye-opening stunts with better pacing and more action. They concluded that this film [...] "remains among Chan's best". [...] In {{a review of the}} Shout! Factory double-bill, Calum Marsh of Slant Magazine rated it 3.5/5 stats and wrote, [...] "This isn't so much exemplary filmmaking as it is bravura stunt work, but Police Story is a veritable case study {{in the value of the}} latter." [...] On reviewing the Police Story series, Kim Newman wrote in Sight & Sound that [...] "a rare instance of a sequel that takes criticism of the original into account, but not to the benefit of the series" [...] as Chan [...] "actually does tone down the destruction, making for an oddly <b>action-light</b> action movie with the amiable Chan out of his depth as the story tries to turn serious." ...|$|E
