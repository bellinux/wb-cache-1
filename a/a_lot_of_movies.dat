[...] "And what's really funny about that is, all the parts of A.I. that people assume were Stanley's were mine. And all the parts of A.I. that people accuse me of {{sweetening}} and softening and sentimentalizing were all Stanley's. The teddy bear was Stanley's. The whole last 20 minutes of the movie was completely Stanley's. The whole first 35, 40 minutes of the film– all the stuff in the house– was word for word, from Stanley's screenplay. This was Stanley's vision." [...] "Eighty percent of the critics got it all mixed up. But I could see why. Because, obviously, I've done <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>movies</b> where people have cried and have been sentimental. And I've been accused of sentimentalizing hard-core material. But {{in fact it was}} Stanley who did the sweetest parts of A.I., not me. I'm the guy who did the dark center of the movie, with the Flesh Fair and everything else. That's why he wanted me to make the movie in the first place. He said, 'This is much closer to your sensibilities than my own.|$|E

2500|$|The {{film has}} also been {{described}} as pro-choice because of its portrayal of abortion.

Conwell auditioned for the role because her [...] "entire family watches the show", she explained [...] "the character was one that I really wanted to play. When I went to the audition, I just really felt it and I think it came off in the audition. I really enjoy working with the cast. They are such great actors which I don’t {{think a lot of people}} realize. The whole experience has been just great". Conwell prepared for the role by researching characteristics of lawyers. Additionally, she said, [...] "I also watched <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>movies</b> where actors or actresses I admire played lawyers. I then added my own spin on it which I think is very important. I had been a fan of the show, so I had an idea of the role. But thank goodness for the internet."

2500|$|Among critics, Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times, {{gave the}} film two {{stars in a}} mostly {{negative}} review, saying the film lacked a science fiction theme and was more akin to a police murder revenge flick, musing [...] "they've just taken the standard cop-buddy-drug lord routine and changed some of the makeup. The Newcomers have no surprises." [...] Regarding the fictional alien culture, he expressed disappointment saying [...] "a feeble attempt is made to invest the Newcomers with interest, by having them get drunk on sour milk instead of booze, and depriving them of any sense of humor." [...] However, on a slightly complimentary note, Ebert mentioned [...] "the makeup took trouble, the photography looks good, the cast and technical credits are top-drawer." [...] But overall, he summed it up by declaring [...] "Alien Nation feels like a movie made {{by people who have}} seen <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>movies,</b> but don't think the audience has." [...] In agreement with Ebert over the originality of the buddy cop genre with the aliens inserted in as just a new rendition, Rita Kempley of The Washington Post said, [...] "Alien Nation wants to be [...] "In the Heat of the Night" [...] as science fiction, but it's neither morally instructive nor prophetic. It proves a lumbering marriage of action and sci-fi that alienates both audiences. It's too dull for one and too dumb for the other." [...] Kempley did find the first half hour to be suspenseful, though: [...] "... well paced, brawny and intense, looks like it was made by another director. But the rest is the cinematic equivalent of overcooked asparagus." [...] However, the more enthusiastic staff of Variety found originality in the extraterrestrial–injected plot saying, [...] "Solid performances by leads James Caan and his humanoid buddy-cop partner Mandy Patinkin move this production beyond special effects, clever alien makeup and car chases." [...] while also adding the film was a [...] "compelling human-humanoid drama." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{appearing}} as oil tycoon Adam Steiffel in 1980's The Formula, which was poorly received critically, Brando {{announced his retirement}} from acting. However, he returned in 1989 in A Dry White Season, based on André Brink's 1979 anti-apartheid novel. Brando agreed to do the film for free, but fell out with director Euzhan Palcy over how the film was edited; he even made a rare television appearance {{in an interview with}} Connie Chung to voice his disapproval. In his memoir, he maintained that Palcy [...] "had cut the picture so poorly, I thought, that the inherent drama of this conflict was vague at best." [...] Brando received praise for his performance, earning an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor and winning the Best Actor Award at the Tokyo Film Festival. Brando also scored enthusiastic reviews for his caricature of his Vito Corleone role as Carmine Sabatini in 1990's The Freshman. In his original review, Roger Ebert wrote, [...] "There have been <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>movies</b> where stars have repeated the triumphs of their parts—but has any star ever done it more triumphantly than Marlon Brando does in The Freshman?" [...] Variety also praised Brando's performance as Sabatini and noted, [...] "Marlon Brando's sublime comedy performance elevates The Freshman from screwball comedy to a quirky niche in film history." [...] Brando also starred alongside his friend Johnny Depp in the box office hit Don Juan DeMarco (1995) and in Depp's controversial The Brave (1997), which was never released in the United States. Later performances, such as his appearance in [...] (1992) (for which he won a Raspberry as [...] "Worst Supporting Actor"), The Island of Dr. Moreau (in which he was nominated for another [...] "Worst Actor" [...] Raspberry) (1996), and his barely recognizable appearance in Free Money (1998), resulted in some of the worst reviews of his career. However, his last completed film, The Score (2001), was received generally positively. In the film, in which he portrays a fence, he starred with Robert De Niro, who had portrayed Vito Corleone in The Godfather Part II.|$|E
