5|$|Aristotle, {{a student}} of Plato, {{observed}} an occultation of Mars by the Moon in 365 BCE. From this he concluded that Mars must lie further from the Earth than the Moon. He noted that other such occultations of stars <b>and</b> <b>planets</b> had been observed by the Egyptians and Babylonians. Aristotle used this observational {{evidence to support the}} Greek sequencing of the planets. His work De Caelo presented a model of the universe in which the Sun, Moon, <b>and</b> <b>planets</b> circle about the Earth at fixed distances. A more sophisticated version of the geocentric model was developed by the Greek astronomer Hipparchus when he proposed that Mars moved along a circular track called the epicycle that, in turn, orbited about the Earth along a larger circle called the deferent.|$|E
5|$|During the 18–19th centuries, {{the study}} of the three body problem by Euler, Clairaut, and D'Alembert led to more {{accurate}} predictions about the motions of the Moon <b>and</b> <b>planets.</b> This work was further refined by Lagrange and Laplace, allowing the masses of the planets and moons to be estimated from their perturbations.|$|E
5|$|Han-era astronomers {{adopted a}} geocentric {{model of the}} universe, theorizing that it was shaped like a sphere {{surrounding}} the earth in the center. They assumed that the Sun, Moon, <b>and</b> <b>planets</b> were spherical and not disc-shaped. They also thought that the illumination of the Moon <b>and</b> <b>planets</b> was caused by sunlight, that lunar eclipses occurred when the Earth obstructed sunlight falling onto the Moon, and that a solar eclipse occurred when the Moon obstructed sunlight from reaching the Earth. Although others disagreed with his model, Wang Chong accurately described the water cycle of the evaporation of water into clouds.|$|E

The {{mechanics}} {{models of}} electromechanical integrated toroidal drive in magnetic meshing between stator <b>and</b> <b>planet</b> or between worm <b>and</b> <b>planet</b> are established {{on the base}} of electromagnetic theory in this paper. Equivalent current model of permanent magnetic body of planet tooth is founded too. The calculated formulas for magnetic field force between stator <b>and</b> <b>planet</b> or between worm <b>and</b> <b>planet</b> are deduced. <b>And</b> the calculated formulas of output torque of electromechanical integrated toroidal drive are obtained too. The output torque of drive is calculated and analyzed, summarized the influence factors and regulars of output torque, which is the base of design...|$|R

5|$|The Han-era Chinese {{discussed}} the illumination and shapes of heavenly bodies: were they flat and circular, {{or were they}} rounded and spherical? Jing Fang wrote in the 1st century BCE that Han astronomers believed the Sun, Moon, <b>and</b> <b>planets</b> were spherical like balls or crossbow bullets. He also wrote that the Moon <b>and</b> <b>planets</b> produce no light of their own, are viewable to people on Earth only because they are illuminated by the Sun, and those parts not illuminated by the Sun would be dark on the other side. For this, Jing compared the Moon to a mirror illuminating light. In the 2nd century CE, Zhang Heng drew a similar comparison to Jing's by stating that the Sun is like fire and the Moon <b>and</b> <b>planets</b> are like water, since fire produces light and water reflects it. He also repeated Jing's comment that {{the side of the}} moon not illuminated by the Sun was left in darkness. However, Zhang noted that sunlight did not always reach the Moon since the Earth obstructs the rays during a lunar eclipse. He also noted that a solar eclipse occurred when the Moon and Sun crossed paths to block sunlight from reaching earth.|$|E
5|$|What is {{the origin}} of the stellar mass spectrum? That is, why do astronomers observe the same {{distribution}} of stellar masses– the initial mass function– apparently regardless of the initial conditions?

5|$|Although {{observations}} using {{adaptive optics}} in late 1997 and early 1998 showed a double {{peak in the}} brightness of the nucleus, controversy still exists over whether such observations can only be explained by a binary nucleus. The discovery of the satellite was not confirmed by other observations. Also, while comets have been observed to break up before, no case has previously been found of a stable binary nucleus. Given the very small mass of this comet, the orbit of the binary nucleus would be easily disrupted by the gravity of the Sun <b>and</b> <b>planets.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Burroughs {{established}} {{a set of}} conventions that were followed fairly closely by most other entries in the sword <b>and</b> <b>planet</b> genre. The typical first book in a sword <b>and</b> <b>planet</b> series uses {{some or all of}} the following plot points: ...|$|R
5|$|Heavy metals {{condense}} in planets as {{a result}} of stellar evolution and destruction processes. Stars lose much of their mass when it is ejected late in their lifetimes, and sometimes thereafter {{as a result}} of a neutron star merger, thereby increasing the abundance of elements heavier than helium in the interstellar medium. When gravitational attraction causes this matter to coalesce and collapse new stars <b>and</b> <b>planets</b> are formed.|$|E
5|$|However, over time, the {{cumulative}} {{probability of a}} chance encounter with a star increases, and disruption of the planets becomes all but inevitable. Assuming that the Big Crunch or Big Rip scenarios {{for the end of}} the Universe do not occur, calculations suggest that the gravity of passing stars will have completely stripped the dead Sun of its remaining planets within 1quadrillion (1015) years. This point marks the end of the Solar System. Although the Sun <b>and</b> <b>planets</b> may survive, the Solar System, in any meaningful sense, will cease to exist.|$|E
5|$|It is {{a common}} {{misconception}} that this collision will disrupt the orbits of the planets in the Solar System. Although {{it is true that}} the gravity of passing stars can detach planets into interstellar space, distances between stars are so great that the likelihood of the Milky Way–Andromeda collision causing such disruption to any individual star system is negligible. Although the Solar System as a whole could be affected by these events, the Sun <b>and</b> <b>planets</b> are not expected to be disturbed.|$|E

5|$|Some comets meet a more {{spectacular}} end – either {{falling into the}} Sun or smashing into a planet or other body. Collisions between comets <b>and</b> <b>planets</b> or moons were common in the early Solar System: {{some of the many}} craters on the Moon, for example, may have been caused by comets. A recent collision of a comet with a planet occurred in July 1994 when Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 broke up into pieces and collided with Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|The Moon {{may have}} {{dramatically}} affected {{the development of}} life by moderating the planet's climate. Paleontological evidence and computer simulations show that Earth's axial tilt is stabilized by tidal interactions with the Moon. Some theorists think that without this stabilization against the torques applied by the Sun <b>and</b> <b>planets</b> to Earth's equatorial bulge, the rotational axis might be chaotically unstable, exhibiting chaotic changes over millions of years, as {{appears to be the}} case for Mars.|$|E
5|$|The triple {{system is}} {{just outside the}} core of the {{globular}} cluster Messier 4. The age of the cluster has been estimated to be about 12.7 billion years, and because all stars in a cluster form at about the same time, <b>and</b> <b>planets</b> form together with their host stars, it is likely that PSR B1620-26 b is also about 12.7 billion years old. This is much older than any other known planet, and nearly three times as old as Earth. It has been undergoing many stages through its lifetime.|$|E

5|$|There is {{evidence}} that Emanuel Swedenborg first proposed parts of the nebular hypothesis in 1734. Immanuel Kant, familiar with Swedenborg's work, developed the theory further in 1755, publishing his own Universal Natural History and Theory of the Heavens, wherein he argued that gaseous clouds (nebulae) slowly rotate, gradually collapse and flatten due to gravity, eventually forming stars <b>and</b> <b>planets.</b>|$|E
5|$|Before {{tools such}} as the {{telescope}} were invented, early study of the stars was conducted using the naked eye. As civilizations developed, most notably in Mesopotamia, Greece, Persia, India, China, Egypt, and Central America, astronomical observatories were assembled, and ideas {{on the nature of}} the Universe began to be explored. Most of early astronomy actually consisted of mapping the positions of the stars <b>and</b> <b>planets,</b> a science now referred to as astrometry. From these observations, early ideas about the motions of the planets were formed, and the nature of the Sun, Moon and the Earth in the Universe were explored philosophically. The Earth was believed to be the center of the Universe with the Sun, the Moon and the stars rotating around it. This is known as the geocentric model of the Universe, or the Ptolemaic system, named after Ptolemy.|$|E
5|$|Despite its {{relative}} brightness (it {{is about a}} fifth as bright as Pluto), Makemake was not discovered until after many much fainter Kuiper belt objects. Most searches for minor planets are conducted relatively close to the ecliptic (the region of the sky that the Sun, Moon <b>and</b> <b>planets</b> appear to lie in, as seen from Earth), due to the greater likelihood of finding objects there. It probably escaped detection during the earlier surveys due to {{its relative}}ly high orbital inclination, {{and the fact that}} it was at its farthest distance from the ecliptic at the time of its discovery, in the northern constellation of Coma Berenices.|$|E

5|$|Favorinus {{argued that}} it was absurd to imagine that stars <b>and</b> <b>planets</b> would affect human bodies {{in the same way as}} they affect the tides, and equally absurd that small motions in the heavens cause large changes in people's fates. Sextus Empiricus {{argued that it}} was absurd to link human {{attributes}} with myths about the signs of the zodiac. Carneades argued that belief in fate denies free will and morality; that people born at different times can all die in the same accident or battle; and that contrary to uniform influences from the stars, tribes and cultures are all different.|$|E
5|$|Here {{we can see}} how {{important}} the exemplary function of the primitive scientific structure is. In order to use the Euclidean system of geometry {{as a model for}} the development of astronomical theory, Ptolemy first had to select hypotheses which could serve as axioms. He naturally regarded circular motion as fundamental and then used the circular motion of deferents and epicycles in his earth-centered theory. Although Zhang Heng understood that the sun, moon <b>and</b> <b>planets</b> move in circles, he lacked a model for a logically structured theory and so could not establish a corresponding astronomical theory. Chinese astronomy was most interested in extracting the algebraic features of planetary motion (that is, the length of the cyclic periods) to establish astronomical theories. Thus astronomy was reduced to arithmetic operations, extracting common multiples and divisors from the observed cyclic motions of the heavenly bodies.|$|E
5|$|In general, in the Solar System, {{planetary}} {{formation is}} thought to have occurred via a process comparable to the long-standing nebular hypothesis: a cloud of interstellar dust and gas collapsed under the influence of gravity to form a rotating disc of material that then further condensed to form the Sun <b>and</b> <b>planets.</b> During the first few million years of the Solar System's history, an accretion process of sticky collisions caused the clumping of small particles, which gradually increased in size. Once the clumps reached sufficient mass, they could draw in other bodies through gravitational attraction and become planetesimals. This gravitational accretion {{led to the formation of}} the planets.|$|E
