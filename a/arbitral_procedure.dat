40|$|This article explores an {{overlooked}} dynamic between arbitration and {{the more}} formal court system. As developed in more detail below, this article 2 ̆ 7 s thesis is that arbitration can help define and reinforce due process norms applicable in court, and a due process-like norm regarding discovery is beginning to develop. Courts often review arbitration agreements for fairness, and through this judicial review, courts have developed a body of law discussing and defining whether certain procedures (or the lack thereof) violate fairness norms {{in connection with the}} resolution of a particular dispute. Through this body of law exploring procedural fairness, one can identify emerging procedural norms, such as a right to discovery in certain situations. Through the procedural creativity and experimentation that occurs in arbitration, and through the judicial review of such <b>arbitral</b> <b>procedures,</b> arbitration creates countless opportunities to explore and define what constitutes the minimum bundle of procedures required for a fair hearing. Part II of this article provides a general overview of arbitration and arbitration procedures.

Part IV concludes with a discussion of how this judicial review of arbitration procedures helps define and reinforce due process norms applicable in courts, particularly with respect to an emerging due process right to discovery...|$|R
40|$|The present thesis {{argues that}} the current legal {{framework}} regulating online cross-border business-to-consumer arbitration reduces the consumer confidence in online arbitration. The analysis focuses on the law applying to online cross-border business-to-consumer arbitration in England and on the U. S. Federal level, as these are identified as main emerging legal systems in this field. The main points {{in support of the}} above argument are as follows: First, the current rules do not oblige the business to notify the consumer about the existence of the arbitration clause in the B 2 C e-commerce contract. Second, the current choice of law rules applicable to online cross-border B 2 C arbitration do not ensure the consumer that he will enjoy the protection awarded to him under the law of his country of domicile. Third, the current jurisdiction rules applicable to online B 2 C arbitration do not give the consumer the right to litigate disputes related to online arbitration agreements and processes in the Courts of his country of domicile. Fourth, the current rules governing the online <b>arbitral</b> <b>procedures</b> do not promote the consumer perception of fairness. Finally, this thesis concludes that consumer confidence is essential for the success of this form of electronic dispute resolution, and that it can be increased by the adoption of an international convention which resolves all the above mentioned problems.

40|$|Supreme Court {{decisions}} establish {{two separate}} {{lines of analysis}} concerning whether arbitration agreements should pre-empt judicial remedies for parties already covered by employment and labor legislation. First, in cases like Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Corp., the Supreme Court espouses a procedural analysis: the Court considers {{the extent to which}} the arbitration procedures reflect judicial processes. In Alexander v. Gardner-Denver and its successors, on the other hand, the Court examines whether the applicable statutes explicitly pre-empt the arbitration agreement. This article argues that neither approach is helpful. Rather, 2 ̆ 7 courts should consider whether the relevant statute applies standards derived essentially from 2 ̆ 2 inside 2 ̆ 2 the institutions the statutes regulate or from 2 ̆ 2 outside 2 ̆ 2 those institutions. Arbitration, Professor Gudridge argues, is plainly appropriate under statutes which reveal an 2 ̆ 2 inside 2 ̆ 2 orientation, and not appropriate under statutes with an 2 ̆ 2 outside 2 ̆ 2 orientation. The author uses the 1991 Civil Rights Act to reach conclusions concerning the applicability of arbitration agreements in the Title VII context. This amendment added a right to injunctive relief in the 2 ̆ 2 mixed motive 2 ̆ 2 Title VII action. The author uses a constitutional analysis of the 1991 amendment as a starting point for thinking about arbitration within Title VII generally.

40|$|The {{increase}} {{in international trade}} creates {{a growing number of}} disputes between parties from different countries. International arbitration is the most preferred mechanism to solve disputes in international trade. If the failing party does not voluntarily comply with the award, the successful party must apply for recognition and enforcement of the award in order to obtain the remedies. Since China {{is one of the major}} business markets in the world, several of the companies committed to <b>arbitral</b> <b>procedures</b> are likely to have assets in China. This means that, if a party fails to honour an award, an enforcement procedure may begin within a Chinese court. The enforcement procedures in China are said to be insufficient and not to comply with international standards. International conventions and treaties provide for a high level of security in the recognition and enforcement <b>procedure</b> of the <b>arbitral</b> award. The most used and important instrument for recognition and enforcement is the United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards of 1958, to which China as well as Sweden are Contracting States. According to the Convention, an international arbitral award may only be refused under certain grounds laid down in the Convention. An analysis of the legal situation in China confirms that there are problems associated with the enforcement of arbitral awards. These problems are not, however, connected with the concept of international arbitral awards, but rather with the entire judicial system in China. Even though an enforcing party can do little to overcome these problems, certain measures can be taken in order to ease the enforcement procedure...|$|R
40|$|Under {{specific}} circumstances, the <b>arbitral</b> tribunal constitution <b>procedure</b> {{may come}} to an impasse, due to divergences between the parties or to the mere innaction {{of one of them}} or even of a third party.

40|$|Despite {{a general}} {{harmonization}} of international arbitration law and <b>arbitral</b> <b>procedure,</b> {{there is no}} international consensus on how the applicable substantive law in arbitration should be ascertained and applied. In Swedish law, this issue – often {{discussed in terms of}} whether jura novit curia applies to international arbitration or not – is uncertain. This thesis makes a comparative analysis of English, French, Swedish and Swiss law in order to recommend a solution to this uncertainty. In national courts, two basic approaches exist in how to ascertain and apply the substantive law. In civil law jurisdictions, the judge is generally obliged to research the law and apply the correct legal basis ex officio under the legal maxim jura novit curia. This is the case in Sweden, France and Switzerland. The freedom of the judge to apply the law ex officio is however limited to some extent by the parties’ right of disposition and right to be heard. In common law jurisdictions, the parties are generally responsible for researching the law and presenting legal arguments. Under the adversarial principle, the judge must refrain from conducting legal research and from raising legal issues ex officio. Such is the case, for example, in England. When foreign law is applied in national courts, however, the differences between the common and civil law jurisdictions appear less drastic. In England as well as in France, Sweden and Switzerland, it is generally the parties who are responsible for ascertaining the content of the applicable foreign law. Yet, in Sweden and France, the court still has a secondary responsibility for ascertaining the content of foreign law. In international arbitration, the arbitral tribunal generally enjoys considerable liberty in ascertaining and applying the applicable substantive law. Rules applied in national courts are rarely imposed in international <b>arbitral</b> <b>procedure.</b> In Sweden, however, this issue is uncertain. In England, France and Switzerland, at least two factors are common: (1) the parties are generally responsible for ascertaining the content of the applicable substantive law, and (2) the arbitral tribunal enjoys a discretionary power to research the law and raise legal issues ex officio, this authority is limited by the parties’ right to be heard on points of law. The underlying principle is that the arbitral tribunal may not take the parties by surprise when it applies the law; the parties must be afforded an opportunity to comment if the arbitral tribunal considers application of legal rules, principles, sources or arguments, to which the parties have not referred. This deference to a discretionary power of the arbitral tribunal and the parties’ right to be heard on points of law is also supported in other key sources of international arbitration law. This thesis suggests that the principles based on commonalities in the examined jurisdictions should also be applied in international <b>arbitral</b> <b>procedure</b> in Sweden. Consequently, jura novit curia, as it is understood in Swedish civil litigation, should not be applied in international commercial arbitration...|$|E

For this reason, this writer intends to examine ways by which the various procedural laws can actually be harmonised.

40|$|In {{appreciation}} of the technical and technological developments during the last decades, the international commerce of cotton is gradually moving from the manual and visual classification to classification based on results from instrumental testing. Now, going from one technique to the next requires studying their respective modalities and possibilities of application. Thus, commercial practices based on manual and visual classing came out onto {{the use of an}} arbitration process and onto the of arbitral tolerances allowing the settlement of possible litigations between sellers and buyers. It is then necessary {{to do the same for}} instrumental classing data, in particular in the cotton production conditions in Africa. The variability study of the fiber technological characteristics is a crucial step forward in the definition of the conditions of good realization of instrumental testing in order to limit the litigation risk between cotton producers in Africa and their international customers. It is also required to be more specific and to adapt the actual <b>arbitral</b> <b>procedures</b> to the instrumental classing. To perform these within-bale and between bales variability studies, Dr. Everina LUKONGE, post-doc employee, in Eastern and South-Eastern Africa, and Modeste ABOE, at that time a PhD student, in West and Central Africa were involved. These two persons were taking hundreds of samples in several ginning mills per country in fourteen African countries, while the same ginning mills were continuing to sample bales on the long-run during two crop seasons. All collected samples were tested in the laboratories of the respective Regional Technical Centers (RTCs) in Tanzania and in Mali. Thousands of results of samples tests from SITC were and are statistically looked at. The objective is to define operating methods for bale sampling and for testing collected cotton samples in order to warrant gained results and thus to limit the litigation risk between seller and buyer of the produced fibres. These instructions / recommendations are adding up to the ones which were given by the RTCs during the training sessions according to the best laboratory practices during the CFC/ICAC/ 33 Project duration (2007 - 2012).

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{challenges}} encountered by parties seeking to have arbitral awards recognised and enforced within the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Specifically, this thesis critically assesses {{the impact of}} Shariah on the enforcement of international awards within the Kingdom and aims to suggest actionable reforms to further develop the Saudi arbitration framework, and build on the modernisation efforts initiated through the Saudi Arbitration Law and Enforcement Law, both issued in 2012. This study aims to examine issues around the treatment and enforcement of domestic and international awards under the Saudi legal system and dispute settlement machinery. Particular focus will be directed to {{the differences between the}} enforcement of domestic and foreign awards, and the challenges that arise therein. By way of critical analysis, this thesis explores the history and development of arbitration law and procedure in Saudi Arabia, focusing on the role of Shariah principles in contract construction and dispute resolution. By bringing Saudi arbitration procedures into greater alignment with international standards and practices, and curtailing the power of local courts, the New Arbitration Law has been widely welcomed as establishing a more hospitable arbitration environment for commercial actors, foreign and domestic. While the New Saudi Arbitration Regime aimed to bring much-needed certainty and predictability to Saudi-based commercial arbitration awards, the Saudi legal system {{is still in its infancy}} and struggling to balance its Shariah roots with secular practices. As this thesis explores, the Saudi model of contract construction and dispute resolution is not yet embedded in a settled or ‘gapless’ body of legal principles, in large part because of on-going contestation among Islamic scholars over the scope and meaning of Shariah principles. While the new law significantly curtails the review power of local courts, judicial authorities in Saudi Arabia continue to enjoy broad discretion to reopen a final non-localised arbitral award issued elsewhere and to subject it to review on the merits. The grounds for annulment, revision or refusal to enforce include any agreement deemed to contravene Shariah law, Saudi public policy and prior Saudi court decrees, in addition to other public policy related defences. In the final analysis, the proposed thesis will consider the potential impacts of Shariah on arbitral award enforcement proceedings initiated in Saudi Arabia. At the level of conceptual analysis, the proposed research reflects on the familiar tension between international regulations, which is principally achieved through harmonisation of applicable <b>arbitral</b> <b>procedures</b> and the domestic enforcement of applicable national (substantive) laws on arbitration. From these premises, the proposed thesis will critically evaluate the extent to which Saudi arbitration law has reconciled the modernising ambitions of an ‘commerce friendly’ arbitration regime and where progress is still needed to achieve efficient and effective award enforcement...|$|R

40|$|While {{international}} {{commercial arbitration}} {{is widely regarded}} as an alternative dispute resolution mechanism to litigation in national courts, those courts are frequently engaged in the review arbitral awards in the context of annulment as well as recognition and enforcement. A key purpose of this review is to ensure that the <b>arbitral</b> <b>procedure</b> is consistent with the fundamental principles of natural justice. These principles find their origin in the general principles of law common to civilised nations, and their application is mandated by both the New York Convention and the UNCITRAL Model Law.

That is, it is both appropriate and desirable that domestic courts, irrespective of the jurisdiction in which they happen to be sitting, apply the basic rules of natural justice in uniform way.

40|$|Arbitration {{proceedings}} as a {{means of}} dispute resolution in international law with regard to the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards Resumé Arbitration as a method of settlement of disputes settlement has enjoyed growing popularity in recent several years. Arbitration stands between other alternative means of dispute settlement and the common court trial as a alternative dispute resolution. Although negotiation, good offices, mediation, conciliation, inquiry, mini-trial, medarb or meadaloa are often used forms of the dispute settlement their awards cannot be enforced by the state authority. Those means are popular mainly in the business field where the parties are interested in the cooperation and where they aim to clear up some misunderstanding or technical problems rather than solve major disputes between them. While the dispute should be solved by the binding way the parties would choose the arbitration as a legally framed <b>procedure.</b> <b>Arbitral</b> awards are then able to be enforced and the parties also have more exact boundaries for the whole procedure. However, there is no unified definition of the arbitration, it could be described as a legal technique where the parties bring claim before one or more neutral persons (arbiters or arbitral tribunal) by whose award the parties agree to be [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} establishes {{that the}} conflict of laws in international commercial arbitration – concerning the substantive law governing {{the merits of the}} dispute – should be the subject of reform. It proposes the introduction of a bright-line test, based on the concept of the closest connection. Its specific recommendation is for the adoption, in international commercial arbitration, of {{a modified version of the}} conflicts rule contained in Art. 4 Rome Convention. That provision incorporates a closest connection test, subject to a characteristic performance presumption. This dissertation’s recommendation includes the adoption of modifications to the original Art. 4 Rome Convention text. These modifications are necessitated by the arbitration context, and are also prompted by better understandings of the original text’s limitations that have been obtained through its application in case law and its consideration in scholarly analysis since the instrument was first opened for signature on 19 June 1980. This dissertation is situated at the intersection of international commercial arbitration and the conflict of laws. It is essentially a study of the tension in the law between certainty and flexibility – and more specifically, between provisions described by law and economics scholarship as rules and standards. Though this dissertation is concerned with a very specific subject-matter, its analysis is broad-ranging and contextual. It draws upon the law, practice and literature concerning conflicts of laws relating to both arbitration and State court proceedings. It also takes into consideration the way in which its analysis affects, and is affected by, other features of international commercial arbitration, and other aspects of <b>arbitral</b> <b>procedure.</b> This dissertation’s analysis incorporates consideration of the way in which conflicts questions are currently regulated in an extensive sample of instruments. These include the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration, the arbitration laws of Switzerland, France and the United Kingdom, and 102 sets of past and present arbitration rules promulgated by key arbitral institutions and other interested bodies. It also takes the New York Convention as an essential baseline reference point. This dissertation recognises that the reform of <b>arbitral</b> <b>procedure</b> is always ongoing, and must be directed at meeting the needs of the commercial parties who are the true users of international commercial arbitration. To this end, its proposal is intended to contribute to the ongoing improvement of the law and practice of international commercial arbitration – an important form of commercial dispute resolution – and ultimately the promotion of international trade, and international economic wellbeing...|$|E
