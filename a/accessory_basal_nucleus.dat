40|$|GABAergic interneurons in the basolateral complex (BLC) of the {{amygdala}} {{are a part}} of the emotional-learning circuitry of the brain and receive excitatory inputs from all sensory modalities via cortex and thalamus. Although the BLC, which is made up of the lateral amygdala (LA), basal amygdala (BA) and <b>accessory</b> <b>basal</b> <b>nucleus,</b> is under the influence of a strong inhibition brought about by local interneurons, little is known about the diversity, characteristics and functioning of these interneurons. In this study, I have characterised the BLC interneuron population using a transgenic mouse model in which enhanced green fluorescent protein has been tagged to the GAD 67 promoter. This promoter is specifically expressed in all GABAergic interneurons, enabling us to visualise interneurons under UV light. Whole-cell recordings were made from GAD 67 interneurons in the BLA to study their membrane and synaptic properties. On the basis of their firing properties, interneurons in the BLC were classified into six distinct groups. The calcium-binding proteins calbindin, calretinin and parvalbumin were found to be expressed differently in the LA and BA interneurons, with the majority of the interneurons in the LA expressing calretinin, whereas those in the BA mostly expressed parvalbumin. We also found diversity in the expression of postsynaptic glutamate receptors in the BLC. Long-term potentiation induced at the interneurons was specific to the cortical inputs in the LA. LTP was expressed only in interneurons that either lacked NMDA receptors or had NMDA receptors with fast decay kinetics. This form of LTP was mediated by calcium-permeable AMPA receptors and required a postsynaptic calcium rise for its induction This study shows that the interneurons in the BLC are a heterogenous population with respect to the expression of calcium-binding proteins, axonal morphology, synaptic and membrane properties. This heterogeneity in interneuron population may be essential for the specialised roles various types of interneurons play in the functioning of {{the amygdala}} and in emotional learning...|$|E
40|$|Opioids such as heroin {{are highly}} {{addictive}} illicit drugs. The μ opioid receptor (MOR) plays {{a central role}} in mediating the effects of opiates and related opioid. The interaction between opioids and MOR activate and regulate multiple cell signaling pathways associated with expression of a number of genes which in rum lead to acute and chronic disturbances in central neuronal system (CNS). The opioid system including, proenkephlin (PENK) and prodynorphin (PDYN), are highly expressed in mesolimbic circuits and striatum, which are key neural systems implicated in opiate dependence. The aim of this thesis was to investigate the effect of opiates on the opioid system in both cellular models and post-mortem human brain specimens in an attempt to understand specific opioid system events induced by opioid exposure. Rat pheochromocytoma (PC 12) recombinant cell line was found to express MORs, which were predominantly located in the plasma membrane. Potential interactions between MOR receptors and cell signaling were determined using cAMP assays. Forskolin-induced cAMP formation was inhibited by DAMGO, a specific MOR agonist, whereas naloxone, a specific MOR antagonist, completely abolished this effect. Using cDNA arrays, changes in gene expression were detected after cellular treatment with DAMGO (3 h). Annexin V, an apoptosis-induced gene and RGS 4 were prominently up-regulated in this cell line. Cultured rat adult hippocampal progenitors (AHPs) were shown to release beta-endorphin and express MOR and delta-opioid receptors (DOR). Incubation with MOR and DOR antagonists for 48 hours (h) reduced signaling of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Cultures incubated with naloxone for 10 days resulted in an approximately threefold increase in neurogenesis which suggest an impairment of cellular functioning after long-term effect of opiate on opioid system. To investigate the possible effect of heroin on the PENK and PDYN systems, post-mortem amygdala and caudal putamen specimens from human heroin abusers were studied. Heroin abusers had significantly reduced PDYN mRNA expression in the periamygdaloid cortex. PENK mRNA expression was found to be significantly elevated in the central nucleus. MOR agonist-stimulated [35 S]GTPγS binding studies revealed reduced MOR coupling in the cortical amygdala region, but elevated binding in the <b>accessory</b> <b>basal</b> <b>nucleus</b> of heroin subjects. These findings suggest impairment in PDYN/KOR and PENK systems in discrete amygdala neuronal populations in association with heroin abuse. In the caudal putamen, although a similar reduction of the opioid gene expression was observed in this study, differential regulation and potential imbalance of MOR and KOR function existed in the caudal putamen of heroin abusers. Finally, the relevance of human MOR gene polymorphism (OPRMI) was investigated since approximately 90 % of our heroin subjects carried the 11 8 G allele. The findings suggest that the OPRMI genotype significantly influenced the PDYN/KOR system in amygdala of heroin abuser in this study. The nociceptin (N-OFQ) /opioid receptor like- 1 (ORL- 1) system belong also to the opioid system and counteract the effects of opioids such as morphine. Based on the limited information known about the anatomical organization of the NOFQ/ORL- 1 system in the human CNS, the regional mRNA expression and receptor localization were analyzed in the postmortem human brain. The results, demonstrated a specific presence of the N-OFQ/ORL- 1 system in the cerebral cortex, central and medial amygdala, discrete ventral thalamic nuclear group and paraventricular hypothalamus. The anatomical distribution N-OFQ/ORL- 1 pattern in the human brain resembles the general pattern observed in other species and substantiates a potential role in functions related to cognition and stress/anxiety that can be explored in opiate abusers. Overall, these finding indicate that opiates produce impairments in different aspects of the opioid system in the brain. Specific alterations in amygdala dynorphinergic and enkephalinergic systems may underlie disturbances in mood and anxiety disorders apparent in opiate abusers...|$|E

40|$|It is well {{established}} that the amygdala plays {{an essential role in}} Pavlovian fear conditioning, with the lateral nucleus serving as the interface with sensory systems that transmit the conditioned stimulus and the central nucleus as the link with motor regions that control conditioned fear responses. The lateral nucleus connects with the central nucleus directly and by way of several other amygdala regions, including the <b>basal,</b> <b>accessory</b> <b>basal,</b> and medial <b>nuclei.</b> To determine which of these regions is necessary, and thus whether conditioning requires the direct or one of the indirect intra-amygdala pathways, we made lesions in rats of the lateral, central, <b>basal,</b> <b>accessory</b> <b>basal,</b> and medial <b>nuclei,</b> as well as combined lesions of the <b>basal</b> and <b>accessory</b> <b>basal</b> <b>nuclei</b> and of the entire amygdala. Animals subsequently underwent fear conditioning trials in which an auditory conditioned stimulus was paired with a footshock unconditioned stimulus. Animals that received lesions of the lateral or central nucleus, or of the entire amygdala, were dramatically impaired, whereas the other lesions had little effect. These findings show that only the lateral and central nuclei are necessary for the acquisition of conditioned fear response to an auditory conditioned stimulus. The neural circuits underlying Pavlovian fear conditioning are believed to involve transmission of the conditioned stimulus (CS) to the lateral nucleus of the amygdala (LA) and the control of conditioned fear responses by way of projec-tions from the central nucleus of the amygdala (CE) to brain...|$|R
40|$|The {{amygdala}} {{is part of}} a {{neural network}} that contributes to the regulation of emotional behaviors. Rodents, especially rats, are used extensively as model organisms to decipher the functions of specific amygdala nuclei, in particular in relation to fear and emotional learning. Analysis {{of the role of the}} nonhuman primate amygdala in these functions has lagged work in the rodent but provides evidence for conservation of basic functions across species. Here we provide quantitative information regarding the morphological characteristics of the main amygdala nuclei in rats and monkeys, including neuron and glial cell numbers, neuronal soma size, and individual nuclei volumes. The volumes of the lateral, <b>basal,</b> and <b>accessory</b> <b>basal</b> <b>nuclei</b> were, respectively, 32, 39, and 39 times larger in monkeys than in rats. In contrast, the central and medial nuclei were only 8 and 4 times larger in monkeys than in rats.

40|$|The afferent {{projections}} to the primate amygdala {{were studied}} using horseradish peroxidase. The potential advantages {{of this technique}} are discussed compared with those previously used to determine amygdaloid afferents. The findings indicate that certain agranular or dysgranular cortical regions may project directly to the amygdala: in particular, the orbital frontal cortex, anterior cingulate gyrus, subcallosal gyrus, temporal pole and anterior insula. These projections probably terminate predominantly in either the lateral or <b>accessory</b> <b>basal</b> <b>nuclei.</b> Other cortical projections from the inferotemporal and superior temporal gyri are described. Evidence was found for a heavy projection from the superior temporal sulcus to the lateral nucleus. Subcortical afferents were found from the hypothalamus, substantia innominata, diagonal band, thalamus, periaqueductal central gray, peripeduncular nucleus and from a band of cells extending medially from the peripeduncular nucleus to the midline, just ventral to the thalamus. In the thalamus, labelled cells were restricted to the non-specific nuclei, and were common in the rostral midline nuclei. No projection was observed from the dorsomedial nucleus of the thalamus.

40|$|SummaryThe social {{behavior}} of {{both human and}} nonhuman primates relies on specializations for the recognition of individuals, their facial expressions, and their direction of gaze [1 – 5]. A broad network of cortical and subcortical structures has been implicated in face processing, yet {{it is unclear whether}} co-occurring dimensions of face stimuli, such as expression and direction of gaze, are processed jointly or independently by anatomically and functionally segregated neural structures. Awake macaques were presented with a set of monkey faces displaying aggressive, neutral, and appeasing expressions with head and eyes either averted or directed. BOLD responses to these faces as compared to Fourier-phase-scrambled images revealed widespread activation of the superior temporal sulcus and inferotemporal cortex and included activity in the amygdala. The different dimensions of the face stimuli elicited distinct activation patterns among the amygdaloid nuclei. The basolateral amygdala, including the lateral, <b>basal,</b> and <b>accessory</b> <b>basal</b> <b>nuclei,</b> produced a stronger response for threatening than appeasing expressions. The central nucleus and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis responded more to averted than directed-gaze faces. Independent behavioral measures confirmed that faces with averted gaze were more arousing, suggesting the activity in the central nucleus may be related to attention and arousal...|$|R
50|$|The pallial {{amygdala}} contains {{mainly the}} so-called basolateral amygdala, encompassing the lateral, basolateral (<b>basal)</b> and basomedial (<b>accessory</b> <b>basal)</b> <b>nuclei,</b> plus the anterior, amygdalopiriform and posterolateral corticoid areas at its surface. The medial pallium also {{may contribute to}} the pallial amygdala, forming the amygdalohippocampal nucleus and the posteromedial corticoid area. It has been postulated that the neurons forming the nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract derive from the dorsal pallium and migrate tangentially into its final position caudal to the olfactory tuberculum. Situated ventral to the pallium in the basic vertebrate forebrain plan (though representing a topologically rostral field in neural plate fate maps) is another region of telencephalic gray matter known as the subpallium, which is the progenitor area for the basal ganglia, a set of structures that {{play a crucial role in}} the executive control of behavior. The subpallium region has distinct striatal, pallidal, diagonal and preoptic subregions, which are stretched obliquely between the septal midline and the amygdala at the posterior pole of the telencephalon. At least the striatum, pallidum and diagonal domains extend into the amygdala, representing there the subpallial amygdala, forming its central and medial nucleis, as well as the amygdaloid end of the bed nucleus stria terminalis complex.|$|R
40|$|A {{combination}} of anterograde and retrograde tracing techniques {{was used to}} study the projections to the nucleus accumbens from the amygdala, the hippocampal formation (including the entorhinal cortex), and the perirhinal cortex in two species of macaque monkey. To help identify possible subregions within the nucleus accumbens, the distribution of calbindin was examined in two additional monkeys. Although this revealed evidence of “core”- and “shell”-like regions within the accumbens, these different regions could not consistently be related to cytoarchitectonic features. The rostral amygdala sent nearly equivalent projections to both the medial and the lateral portions of nucleus accumbens, whereas projections arising from the middle and caudal amygdala terminated preferentially in the medial division of <b>nucleus</b> accumbens. The <b>basal</b> <b>nucleus</b> was {{the major source of}} these amygdala efferents, and there was a crude topography as parts of the <b>basal</b> and <b>accessory</b> <b>basal</b> <b>nuclei</b> terminated in different parts of nucleus accumbens. The subiculum was the major source of hippocampal projections to the nucleus accumbens, but some hippocampal efferents also originated in the parasubiculum, the prosubiculum, the adjacent portion of CA 1, and the uncal portion of CA 3. These hippocampal projections, which coursed through the fornix, showed a rostrocaudal gradient as more arose in the rostral hippocampus. Hippocampal efferents terminated most densely in the medial and ventral portions of nucleus accumbens, along with light label in the adjacent olfactory tubercle. The entorhinal projections were more evenly distributed between the medial nucleus accumbens and the olfactory tubercle, whereas the perirhinal projections were primarily to the olfactory tubercle. These cortical inputs were less reliant on the fornix. Amygdala and subicular (hippocampal) projections overlapped most completely in the medial division of nucleus accumbens...|$|R
40|$|Abnormal {{development}} of the amygdala {{has been linked to}} several neurodevelopmental disorders, including schizophrenia and autism. However, the postnatal {{development of}} the amygdala is not easily explored at the cellular level in humans. Here, we performed a stereological analysis of the macaque monkey amygdala in order to characterize the cellular changes underlying its normal structural development in primates. The lateral, <b>basal</b> and <b>accessory</b> <b>basal</b> <b>nuclei</b> exhibited the same developmental pattern, with a large increase in volume between birth and three months of age, followed by slower growth continuing beyond one year of age. In contrast, the medial nucleus was near adult size at birth. At birth, the volume of the central nucleus was half of the adult value; this nucleus exhibited significant growth even after one year of age. Neither neuronal soma size, nor neuron or astrocyte numbers changed during postnatal development. In contrast, oligodendrocyte numbers increased substantially, in parallel with an increase in amygdala volume, after three months of age. At birth, the paralaminar nucleus contained a large pool of immature neurons that gradually developed into mature neurons, leading to a late increase in the volume of this nucleus. Our findings revealed that distinct amygdala nuclei exhibit different developmental profiles and that the amygdala is not fully mature for some time postnatally. We identified different periods during which pathogenic factors might lead to the abnormal development of distinct amygdala circuits, which may contribute to different human neurodevelopmental disorders associated with alterations of amygdala structure and functions...|$|R

Studies of the ontogeny of fear behaviors reveal the emergence of distinct fear responses at different postnatal ages. Here, we performed a stereological analysis of the rat amygdala to characterize the cellular changes underlying its normal structural development. Distinct amygdala nuclei exhibited different patterns of postnatal development, which were largely similar to those we have previously shown in monkeys. The combined volume of the lateral, <b>basal,</b> and <b>accessory</b> <b>basal</b> <b>nuclei</b> increased by 113 % from 1 to 3 weeks of age and by an additional 33 % by 7 months of age. The volume of the central nucleus increased only 37 % from 1 to 2 weeks of age and 38 % from 2 weeks to 7 months. At 1 week of age, the medial nucleus was 77 % of the 7 -month-old's volume and exhibited a constant, marginal increase until 7 months. Neuron number {{did not differ in}} the amygdala from 1 week to 7 months of age. In contrast, astrocyte number decreased from 3 weeks to 2 months of age in the whole amygdala. Oligodendrocyte number increased in all amygdala nuclei from 3 weeks to 7 months of age. Our findings revealed that distinct amygdala nuclei exhibit different developmental profiles and that the rat amygdala is not fully mature for an extended period postnatally. We identified different periods of postnatal development of distinct amygdala nuclei and cellular components, which are concomitant with the ontogeny of different fear and emotional behaviors...|$|R
40|$|The basolateral {{amygdala}} complex (BLA), {{including the}} lateral (LA), <b>basal</b> (BA) and <b>accessory</b> <b>basal</b> (AB) <b>nuclei,</b> {{is involved in}} acquisition of contextual and auditory fear conditioning. The BA {{is one of the}} main targets for hippocampal information, a brain structure critical for contextual learning, which integrates several discrete stimuli into a single configural representation. Congruent with the hodology, selective neurotoxic damage to the BA results in impairments in contextual, but not auditory, fear conditioning, similarly to the behavioral impairments found after hippocampal damage. This study evaluated the effects of muscimol-induced reversible inactivation of the BA during a simultaneous contextual and auditory fear conditioning training on later fear responses to both the context and the tone, tested separately, without muscimol administration. As compared to control rats micro-infused with vehicle, subjects micro-infused with muscimol before training exhibited, during testing without muscimol, significant reduction of freezing responses to the conditioned context, but not to the conditioned tone. Therefore, reversible inactivation of the BA during training impaired contextual, but not auditory fear conditioning, thus confirming and extending similar behavioral observations following selective neurotoxic damage to the BA and, in addition, revealing that this effect is not related to the lack of a functional BA during testing...|$|R
40|$|In {{human and}} nonhuman primates, the {{amygdala}} {{is known to}} play critical roles in emotional and social behavior. Anatomically, individual amygdaloid nuclei are connected with many neural systems that are either differentially expanded or conserved {{over the course of}} primate evolution. To address amygdala evolution in humans and our closest living relatives, the apes, we used design-based stereological methods to obtain neuron counts for the amygdala and each of four major amygdaloid <b>nuclei</b> (the lateral, <b>basal,</b> <b>accessory</b> <b>basal,</b> and central <b>nuclei)</b> in humans, all great ape species, lesser apes, and one monkey species. Our goal was to determine whether there were significant differences in the number or percent of neurons distributed to individual nuclei among species. Additionally, regression analyses were performed on independent contrast data to determine whether any individual species deviated from allometric trends. There were two major findings. In humans, the lateral nucleus contained the highest number of neurons in the amygdala, whereas in apes the <b>basal</b> <b>nucleus</b> contained the highest number of neurons. Additionally, the human lateral nucleus contained 59 % more neurons than predicted by allometric regressions on nonhuman primate data.

40|$|The loop {{enables the}} {{comparison}} of two competing signals. One signal urges to execute a suggested motor action to gain a reward, whereas the other urges to avoid it to spare the effort it takes. For high rewards and low efforts, the proposed motor action is executed and the amygdalar fearful reaction is inhibited. For low rewards and high efforts, the proposed motor action is not executed, and the amygdalar response is reinforced. The loop should reach a decision within {{a limited amount of}} time, even when the expected reward and effort are both high or low. As illustrated in figure 1, voluntary movements are initiated by cingulate motor areas (CMA) in the ACC, which project both to the primary motor cortex and to the ventral horn of the spinal cord [27, 29]. These motor pathways are suggestively used by the ACC to elicit exploratory actions, in order to acquire more information about the environment and the potential reward [29]. The resulting sensory information is fed both to the lateral nucleus of the amygdala (La), and to the OFC. The OFC projects directly to the ACC, whereas the lateral nucleus projects to the <b>basal</b> (B) and <b>accessory</b> <b>basal</b> (AB) <b>nuclei,</b> which project to the ACC. The B and AB nuclei play a role in evaluating the expected efforts and rewards associated with the suggested action.

40|$|The basolateral {{amygdala}} complex (BLA) {{is involved}} in acquisition of contextual and auditory fear conditioning. However, the BLA {{is not a single}} structure but comprises a group of nuclei, including the lateral (LA), <b>basal</b> (BA) and <b>accessory</b> <b>basal</b> (AB) <b>nuclei.</b> While it is consensual that the LA is critical for auditory fear conditioning, there is controversy on the participation of the BA in fear conditioning. Hodological and neurophysiological findings suggest that each of these nuclei processes distinct information in parallel; the BA would deal with polymodal or contextual representations, and the LA would process unimodal or elemental representations. Thus, it seems plausible to hypothesize that the BA is required for contextual, but not auditory, fear conditioning. This hypothesis was evaluated in Wistar rats submitted to multiple-site ibotenate-induced damage restricted to the BA and then exposed to a concurrent contextual and auditory fear conditioning training followed by separated contextual and auditory conditioning testing. Differing from electrolytic lesion and lidocaine inactivation, this surgical approach does not disturb fibers of passage originating in other brain areas, restricting damage to the aimed nucleus. Relative to the sham-operated controls, rats with selective damage to the BA exhibited disruption of performance in the contextual, but not the auditory, component of the task. Thus, while the BA seems required for contextual fear conditioning, it is not critical for both an auditory-US association, nor for the expression of the freezing response. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Anatomically, the {{amygdala}} and its 13 component nuclei integrate higher order {{perceptual information from}} the neocortex with subcortical neuroendocrine and autonomic centers. Functionally, it is a central constituent in the neural circuits subserving social and emotional behavior. An increasingly influential hypothesis posits that primate intelligence has arisen in response to challenges in the social milieu. However, structures associated with emotion processing, i. e., "limbic" structures, have been historically construed as primitive. Given these competing claims, this dissertation seeks to assess {{the amygdala}}'s role in human brain evolution by quantifying and comparing volumes and neuron counts for the amygdala and four of its major <b>nuclei</b> (the lateral, <b>basal,</b> <b>accessory</b> <b>basal,</b> and central <b>nuclei)</b> in a large sample comprising humans and all ape genera. Analyses revealed three core findings. First, human amygdala volume has tripled in size, but neuron numbers have been maintained in great ape ranges, suggesting that changes in neuron number and volume may be decoupled in human amygdala evolution. Second, the intrinsic organization of the human amygdala is unique compared with ape amygdala. Specifically, the human lateral nucleus is 37 % larger and contains 59 % more neurons than expected, departing from the organization of ape amygdala which emphasize the <b>basal</b> <b>nucleus.</b> Conversely, the central nucleus was three times smaller in the human amygdala than expected. As the lateral nucleus is the major recipient of neocortical, especially temporal lobe, input and the central nucleus is {{the major source of}} autonomic output, human amygdala reorganization may reflect the expansion and conservation of these interconnected anatomical regions, respectively. Third, the human lateral nucleus {{is one of the most}} expansive structures in the human limbic system, second only to the hippocampus. Volumetric increases in the lateral nucleus and amygdala also outpace expansion in the dorsal frontal cortex, a region associated both with executive and motor, but not emotional, function, indicating that emotion processing is not uniquely or especially de-emphasized in human brain evolution. Overall, it may be speculated that increases in the human lateral nucleus arose in response to a heightened need to process the emotional salience of stimuli in the complex human social environmen...|$|R

In this study, we examined the contribution of individual amygdaloid nuclei to contextual and auditory fear conditioning in rats. Prior to fear conditioning, rats received a large electrolytic lesion of the amygdala in one hemisphere, and a nucleus-specific neurotoxic lesion in the contralateral hemisphere. Neurotoxic lesions targeted either the lateral nucleus (LA), basolateral and basomedial <b>nuclei</b> (<b>basal</b> <b>nuclei),</b> or central nucleus (CE) of the amygdala. LA and CE lesions attenuated freezing to both contextual and auditory conditional stimuli (CSs). Lesions of the <b>basal</b> <b>nuclei</b> produced deficits in contextual and auditory fear conditioning only when the damage extended into the anterior divisions of the basal nuclei; damage limited to the posterior divisions of the <b>basal</b> <b>nuclei</b> did not significantly impair conditioning to either auditory or contextual CS.

NHP comparisons {{at the level of}} individual amygdaloid nuclei have not been carried out in non-ape species. Chapter I summarizes what we currently know about the structure of the AC in NHP and reviews the functions of individual nuclei. Thirteen Old and New World primates, representing five species, were analyzed using standard stereological methods for nuclei volume and neuron number in 26 AC subdivisions. Chapter II explains the methods used to evaluated volumes and measure cell numbers. This paper focuses specifically on four AC <b>nuclei</b> (<b>accessory</b> <b>basal,</b> basal, central, and lateral).

40|$|Aims: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA 2) {{belongs to}} the CAG repeat or polyglutamine diseases. Along with a large variety of motor, {{behavioural}} and neuropsychological symptoms the clinical picture of patients suffering from this autosomal dominantly inherited ataxia may also include deficits of attention, impairments of memory, as well as frontal-executive and visuospatial dysfunctions. As the possible morphological correlates of these cognitive SCA 2 deficits are unclear we examined the cholinergic <b>basal</b> forebrain <b>nuclei,</b> which {{are believed to be}} crucial for several aspects of normal cognition and may contribute to impairments of cognitive functions under pathological conditions. Methods: We studied pigment-Nissl-stained thick tissue sections through the cholinergic <b>basal</b> forebrain <b>nuclei</b> (that is, medial septal nucleus, nuclei of the diagonal band of Broca, <b>basal</b> <b>nucleus</b> of Meynert) of four clinically diagnosed and genetically confirmed SCA 2 patients and of 13 control individuals according to the pathoanatomical approach. The pathoanatomical results were confirmed by additional quantitative investigations of these nuclei in the SCA 2 patients and four age-and gendermatched controls. Results: Our study revealed a severe and consistent neuronal loss in all of the cholinergic <b>basal</b> forebrain <b>nuclei</b> (medial septal nucleus: 72 %; vertical nucleus of the diagonal band of Broca: 74 %; horizontal limb of the diagonal band of Broca: 72 %; <b>basal</b> <b>nucleus</b> of Meynert: 86 %) of the SCA 2 patients studied. Damage to the <b>basal</b> forebrain <b>nuclei</b> was associated with everyday relevant cognitive deficits only in our SCA 2 patient with an additional Braak and Braak stage V Alzheimer's disease (AD) -related tau pathology. Conclusions: The findings of the present study: (1) indicate that the mutation and pathological process underlying SCA 2 play a causative role for this severe degeneration of the cholinergic <b>basal</b> forebrain <b>nuclei</b> and (2) may suggest that degeneration of the cholinergic <b>basal</b> forebrain <b>nuclei</b> per se is not sufficient to cause profound and global dementia detrimental to everyday practice and activities of daily living. ...|$|R
