5|$|Liquor {{was another}} {{profitable}} private industry nationalized {{by the central}} government in 98 BC. However, this was repealed in 81 BC and a property tax rate of two coins for every 0.2L (0.05 gallons) was levied for those who traded it privately. By 110 BC Emperor Wu also interfered with the profitable trade in grain when he eliminated speculation by selling government-stored grain at <b>a</b> <b>lower</b> <b>price</b> than demanded by merchants. Apart from Emperor Ming's creation of a short-lived Office for Price Adjustment and Stabilization, which was abolished in 68 AD, central-government price control regulations were largely absent during the Eastern Han.|$|E
5|$|The iPhone 5 {{was officially}} {{discontinued}} by Apple on September 10, 2013 with {{the announcement of}} its successors, the iPhone 5S and the iPhone 5C. While the 5C shared almost the same internal hardware as the iPhone 5, the 5C used a lower-cost poly-carbonate plastic case {{in place of the}} original 5's aluminum form. The introduction of the 5C deviated from Apple's previous market strategy, where the previous iPhone model would remain in production, but sold at <b>a</b> <b>lower</b> <b>price</b> point below the new model.|$|E
5|$|The mix of {{engraving}} styles was criticised; {{line engraving}} {{was considered the}} superior form and artists and subscribers disliked the mixture of lesser forms with it. Moreover, Boydell's engravers fell behind schedule, delaying the entire project. He was forced to engage lesser artists, such as Hamilton and Smirke, at <b>a</b> <b>lower</b> <b>price</b> to finish the volumes as his business started to fail. Modern art historians have generally concurred {{that the quality of}} the engravings, particularly in the folio, was poor. Moreover, the use of so many different artists and engravers led to a lack of stylistic cohesion.|$|E

5|$|A MaK-built DB Class 240 {{locomotive}} was test-run in Norway during 1990. On 23 November 1992, NSB's board {{decided to}} order ten similar units. The order was later expanded with another two units because NSB was offered <b>a</b> <b>lower</b> <b>price</b> than originally stipulated. The Di6 would have motors from Siemens, who had bought MaK, {{and would be}} optimized for Norwegian conditions and standards. The contract was worth NOK380 million, or NOK32 million per unit. At the same time, NSB also made an order for 20 smaller diesel-electric locomotives from MaK, the Di8. Between the two new classes, they were to replace all the Di3s.|$|E
5|$|In July 2003, Linx {{reduced the}} number of daily {{services}} from Gothenburg to Copenhagen from ten to four. The company stated that this was because of insufficient ridership. Linx had offered tickets with <b>a</b> <b>lower</b> <b>price</b> than Scandinavian Airlines, who operated the airline service between Oslo Airport, Gardermoen and Stockholm-Arlanda Airport. Ryanair also provided an airline service, but with fewer departures and with the same center-to-center transport time because it flew from the secondary Sandefjord Airport, Torp and Stockholm-Skavsta Airport. From 1 September 2003, Norwegian Air Shuttle started services from Gardermoen to Arlanda, and became a more direct competitor to Linx. From 27 October, Nordic Airlink (later FlyNordic) also started a flight between the same airports. With shorter travel time from center to center and comparable fares, Norwegian and Nordic started taking market shares away from Linx.|$|E

5|$|Like the Berlina, the Calais {{retains the}} {{features}} of the outgoing model but at <b>a</b> <b>lower</b> <b>price</b> point. Offering a blend of luxury and sporting character, it pairs the High Output Alloytec V6 engine of the SV6 with the five-speed automatic transmission. Unlike the previous model Calais which featured a semi-sport suspension setup known as FE1.5, the VE shares the Commodore SS/SS V stiff sports suspension. Like the SS, an upscale V-Series edition is available. Being the flagship of the Commodore range, it comes with everything the VE has to offer and serves as a stepping stone to the luxury long-wheelbase Statesman/Caprice range based on the VE. The Calais (as well as Berlina) are the only models in the range to feature larger tail-lights.|$|E
5|$|Sega {{was able}} to outsell Nintendo four Christmas seasons in a row due to the Genesis' head start, <b>a</b> <b>lower</b> <b>price</b> point, and a larger library of games when {{compared}} to the Super Nintendo at its release. Sega had ten games for every game on SNES, and while the SNES had an exclusive version of Final Fight, one of Sega's internal development teams created Streets of Rage, which had bigger levels, tougher enemies, and a well-regarded soundtrack. ASCII Entertainment reported in the spring of 1993 that Genesis had 250 titles versus 75 for Super Nintendo, but limited shelf space meant that stores typically offered 100 Genesis and 50 Super Nintendo titles. The NES was still the leader, with 300 titles and 100 on shelves.|$|E
5|$|The main {{harvesting}} {{season for}} coffee in Rwanda is during the major rainy season, running from March {{to the end}} of May. At harvest time, farmers spend most of the day picking cherries by hand. In the evening, they carry them in traditional baskets woven from banana leaves to the washing station, which may be several hours away. Technicians hand-sort the beans to pick out the best cherries, those with a deep red colour, and return the remainder to the grower to be sold on to markets outside the Maraba process at <b>a</b> <b>lower</b> <b>price.</b> The technicians pay the grower US$0.10 per kilogram. This money accumulates, and the association pays it each fortnight into farmers' bank accounts.|$|E

5|$|After the Super Bowl XLVIII halftime show, which {{featured}} Mars as the headline act and the Red Hot Chili Peppers as the special guests, tickets for Mars second North American tour experienced high demands. He became the fastest entertainer {{to sell out}} three concerts at the Blaisdell Arena in Hawaii. Since the morning of February 3, 2014, many shows were sold out {{and only a few}} tickets were available on the primary market, the average price of a ticket was around $500 (US) on the secondary market. Ticketmaster also struggled to keep with demand, having to switch from their interactive seating maps for most events. The price for tickets on the primary market ranged from $49 (US) to $100 (US), however in bigger cities the price was between $70 (US) and $181 (US). On the secondary market, tickets for big venues had a wider price range of between $150 (US) to $600 (US). At these prices, Mars tour ranked amongst the most expensive in the U.S. during the summer of 2014, ahead of One Direction and Jason Aldean shows, which had the highest prices for an American tour on the same period. Two months after the Super Bowl, 27 of the 48 dates booked for the second leg on North America were sold out on the primary market. The only tickets left for those shows were available on the secondary market for <b>a</b> <b>lower</b> <b>price</b> than after the game. Nevertheless, the tour {{became one of the most}} expensive of 2014 due to the latter market.|$|E
5|$|In September 2010, a teaser website was {{revealed}} by Sega, hinting {{at a new}} Valkyria Chronicles game. In its September issue, Famitsu listed that Senjō no Valkyria 3 would be arriving on the PlayStation Portable.
