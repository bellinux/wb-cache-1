40|$|Background and Aim: Self-reported and questionaire {{method for}} hearing {{impairment}} assessment {{allow us to}} study and to detect the invisible related issues, while They {{can not be done}} by traditional audiometry procedures. The {{purpose of this study is}} to compare measurement of hearing handicap using self-reported and staff version of NHHI <b>and</b> <b>hearing</b> thresholds in nursing home residents. Materials and Method: The study participants were 43 individuals, 23 males and 20 females, aged 45 - 95 years. Pure tone average were calculated after conventional Pure tone audiometry. the self- and staff- reported questionnaire were also fulfilled. Results: Nine (20. 9 %) individuals have normal hearing, 6 (14 %) have slight, 10 (23. 3 %) mild, 7 (16. 3 %) moderate, 6 (16. 3 %) moderate to severe, 4 (9. 3 %) severe, and 1 (2. 3 %) profound hearing loss. Mean score of self and of staff reported versions were 32. 22 % + 29. 31 and 32. 67 % + 30. 98, respectively. According to Kruskal-wallis test, there were significant correlation between self-reported <b>and</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>level</b> <b>and</b> between staff-reported <b>and</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>level.</b> The Pierson coefficient variation test between self and staff-reported, <b>and</b> self-reported <b>and</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>level,</b> staff-reported <b>and</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>level</b> showed significant correlation. Conclusion: The NHHI self assessment associated with other equipments significantly improved the identification and assessment of adults <b>and</b> elderly <b>hearing</b> handicap in nursing home residents. According to the study condition, it may be concluded that the self and staff version of NHHI questionnaire are significantly identical and can be used instead...|$|R

Research suggests that learning-disabled children have problems associated with hearing. Poor performance by these children on tasks of auditory discrimination, auditory memory, auditory-visual integration, and auditory figure-background differentiation have been reported. Forty learning-disabled elementary school children and a control group of children not identified as having learning problems were given pure-tone air-conduction audiometric tests. Comparison of the two groups showed no significant differences in <b>hearing</b> <b>levels</b> on any of the eleven frequencies tested. Although results of this study did not establish a relationship between auditory acuity and learning problems, the slightly better performance of the learning disabled group suggests that further investigation with more favorable testing conditions might yield different findings. The current research into the role of higher levels of the sensory system in audition might guide future researchers in discovering auditory factors contributing to learning disability...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{etiology}} of sudden {{sensorineural hearing loss}} (SSNHL) is still unclear and is most probably diverse. Objective: To determine the relationship between vertebrobasilar circulation <b>and</b> <b>hearing</b> in patients with SSNHL treated with pentoxifylline. Design: Case-control study of 32 consecutive patients with SSNHL. Methods: Patients with onset of SSNHL within 72 hours were treated with pentoxifylline infusions for 10 days. Transcra-nial Doppler (TCD) ultrasonography of vertebrobasilar circulation <b>and</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>levels</b> were examined {{at the onset of}} SSNHL (before treatment), after 10 days of therapy, and after 3 months. Main Outcome Measures: <b>Hearing</b> <b>levels</b> <b>and</b> TCD ultrasonographic findings at the onset of SSNHL, after 10 days, and after 3 months. Results: Patients with SSNHL had more frequent pathologic TCD ultrasonographic findings compared with a normal popu-lation. Thirteen patients with SSNHL had normal TCD ultrasonographic findings, eight had borderline findings, and six had pathologic findings, and in five patients, initially, pathologic TCD ultrasonographic findings improved during therapy.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the clinical utility of measuring the external ear resonance (EER) amplitude peak as a screening test for detecting hearing loss in children with otitis media with effusion (OME). The peak EER amplitude and frequeney of 180 ears in 100 children at risk of hearing loss related to OME was recorded. A relationship was found to exist between peak EER amplitude <b>and</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>level,</b> in particular at low frequencies, or the pure tone average (500, 1000 and 2000 Hz). However, the correlation was not strong and a wide scatter of results was apparent. Using a criterion of > 15 dB HL three-frequeney average for failure, the ears were divided into normal <b>hearing</b> <b>and</b> <b>hearing</b> loss groups. The two groups differed significantly with regard to peak EER amplitude but the sensitivity and specificity levels of the EER test suggest it is of limited benefit {{as an indication of}} OME-related hearing loss in screening situations. An alternate hearing loss criterion, ≤ 25 dB HL, did not give improved predictive levels. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|The neural {{basis of}} {{tinnitus}} is unknown. Recent neuroimaging studies point towards involvement of several cortical and subcortical regions. Here we demonstrate that tinnitus {{may be associated}} with structural changes in the auditory cortex. Using individual morphological segmentation, the medial partition of Heschl's gyrus (mHG) was studied in individuals with and without chronic tinnitus using magnetic resonance imaging. Both the tinnitus and the non-tinnitus group included musicians and non-musicians. Patients exhibited significantly smaller mHG gray matter volumes than controls. In unilateral tinnitus, this effect was almost exclusively seen in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the affected ear. In bilateral tinnitus, mHG volume was substantially reduced in both hemispheres. The tinnitus-related volume reduction was found across the full extent of mHG, not only in the high-frequency part usually most affected by hearing loss-induced deafferentation. However, there was also evidence for a relationship between volume reduction <b>and</b> <b>hearing</b> loss. Correlations between volume <b>and</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>level</b> depended on the subject group as well as the asymmetry of the hearing loss. The volume changes observed may represent antecedents or consequences of tinnitus <b>and</b> tinnitus-associated <b>hearing</b> loss <b>and</b> also raise the possibility that small cortical volume constitutes a vulnerability factor...|$|R

40|$|Background: Lead {{still remains}} an {{important}} problem for poor, inner-city, ethnic minority children, {{with a particular}} emphasis on lead paint and dust. In Egypt, there is no national survey about the prevalence of elevated blood lead level among children. Objective: To assess the environmental lead level {{as well as to}} determine blood lead level among primary school children and find out its relationship with their intelligent quotient (IQ), hemoglobin <b>level,</b> <b>hearing</b> impairment <b>and</b> school performance. Methods: 190 primary school children from rural and urban areas were selected and their blood lead levels (BLL), hemoglobin concentrations, IQ, <b>hearing</b> threshold <b>and</b> school performance were measured. Also, environmental lead level was measured in the school and home. Results: The mean value of environmental lead (μg/m 3) in urban schools air was significantly higher than that in rural areas. BLL had a significant negative correlation with hemoglobin level and IQ; it was positively correlated with the hearing threshold. With increasing BLL, the school performance of children decreased significantly. Conclusion: Exposure to lead would deteriorate IQ, school performance <b>and</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>level</b> of school children. Even in the absence of overt clinical manifestations of lead toxicity, lead intoxication should be among differential diagnosis in children presenting anemia, intellectual impairment, poor academic performance <b>and</b> <b>hearing</b> impairment. </p...|$|R

Aim: The aim of the authors {{was to assess the}} status of eardrum, the function of Eustachian tube <b>and</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>level</b> 10 years after the use of tympanostomy tube. Method: Patients filled up a questionnaire and microscopic examination of tympanic membrane, tympanometry, Eustachian tube function examination, and audiometry tests were performed. Results: In the period of 2003 - 2004, ventilation tube insertion was performed in 711 patients in the ENT Department of Pediatric Health Center of University of Szeged. In 349 patients adenotomy and tympanostomy tube insertion, in 18 cases tonsillectomy and grommet insertion and in 344 patients only typmanostomy tube insertion were performed. Due to objective difficulties (address change, no phone number) 453 patients were asked for control test and 312 persons accepted the invitation. Normal <b>hearing</b> <b>level</b> was found in 84. 6 % of patients and normal tympanometry result occurred in 82 %. Tympanic ventilation disorder, perforation of tympanic membrane, sensorineural <b>hearing</b> loss <b>and</b> sensorineural <b>hearing</b> loss due to noise exposure were diagnosed. Conclusions: Application of tympanostomy tube is effective in the treatment of serous otitis media resulting from ventilation disorder.

40|$|There is {{increasing}} {{demand in the}} hearing research community {{for the creation of}} laboratory environments that better simulate challenging real-world listening environments. The hope is that the use of such environments for testing will lead to more meaningful assessments of listening ability, and better predictions about the performance of hearing devices. Here we present one approach for simulating a complex acoustic environment in the laboratory, and investigate the effect of transplanting a speech test into such an environment. Speech reception thresholds were measured in a simulated reverberant cafeteria, and in a more typical anechoic laboratory environment containing background speech babble. The participants were 46 listeners varying in age <b>and</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>levels,</b> including 25 hearing-aid wearers who were tested with <b>and</b> without their <b>hearing</b> aids.

A monocentric retrospective review of medical charts of patients followed for an intratemporal facial nerve schwannoma between 1988 and 2013 was performed. Twenty-two patients were included. Data were extracted pertaining to the following variables: patient demographics, tumor localization, clinical and imaging features, facial nerve function <b>and</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>levels,</b> <b>and</b> details of surgical intervention. The majority of tumors were located at the geniculate ganglion. Initial symptoms were mainly facial palsy <b>and</b> <b>hearing</b> loss. The average follow-up was 4. 8 ± 4. 5 years. Nineteen patients underwent surgery, and three patients were observed. After surgery, 11 patients had a stable or improved facial nerve function (57. 9 %), and 8 patients had a worsened facial nerve function (42. 1 %). Facial nerve function was in the majority of cases a HB grade III, depending on surgical strategy. No patient presented a postoperative HB grade V or VI. Regarding the hearing, it remained stable after surgery in 52. 6 % of cases, and improved in 10. 5 % of cases.

40|$|Objective: The {{high energy}} demand of the {{auditory}} and visual pathways render these sensory systems prone to diseases that impair mitochondrial function. Primary open-angle glaucoma, a neurodegenerative {{disease of the}} optic nerve, has recently been associated with a spectrum of mitochondrial abnormalities. This study sought to investigate auditory processing in individuals with open-angle glaucoma. Design/Study sample: Twenty-seven subjects with open-angle glaucoma underwent electrophysiologic (auditory brainstem response), auditory temporal processing (amplitude modulation detection), and speech perception (monosyllabic words in quiet and background noise) assessment in each ear. A cohort of age, gender <b>and</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>level</b> matched control subjects was also tested. Results: While the majority of glaucoma {{subjects in this study}} demonstrated normal auditory function, there were a significant number (6 / 27 subjects, 22 %) who showed abnormal auditory brainstem responses and impaired auditory perception in one or both ears. Conclusions: The finding that a significant proportion of subjects with open-angle glaucoma presented with auditory dysfunction provides evidence of systemic neuronal susceptibility.

Patient and tumor related parameters, pre- <b>and</b> postoperative <b>hearing</b> <b>level,</b> intraoperative findings, <b>and</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>and</b> tinnitus handicap inventory scores were analyzed. Results. Cochlear nerve integrity was achieved in 44 % corresponding to preservation of preoperatively serviceable hearing in 47 % <b>and</b> useful <b>hearing</b> in 21 %. Main prognostic factors of hearing preservation were grade/size of tumor, preoperative <b>hearing</b> <b>level,</b> intraoperative neuromonitoring, tumor consistency, and adhesion to neurovascular structures. Microsurgery led to elimination of tinnitus in 66 % but also new-onset of the symptom in 14 % of cases. Preservation of useful <b>hearing</b> <b>and</b> neurectomy of the eighth cranial nerve were main prognostic factors of tinnitus elimination. Preservation of cochlear nerve but loss of preoperative hearing emerged as the main factor for tinnitus persistence and new onset tinnitus. Decrease of THI scores was observed postoperatively.

DESIGN: Clinical investigation. SETTING: Tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: Family members from a large 5 -generation pedigree with sensorineural hearing impairment segregating as an autosomal dominant trait. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses of pure-tone audiometric data, and cross-sectional analyses of speech audiometry data. RESULTS: Overall, a flat to gently downsloping audiometric configuration was observed with a progression rate of approximately 0. 8 dB/y across most frequencies. Speech recognition scores remained fairly good in relation to age <b>and</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>level</b> compared {{with a group of}} patients with presbycusis.

Study sample: Maximum <b>hearing</b> <b>level,</b> total harmonic distortion (THD), frequency response, and electrical impedance were measured for six devices of each bone vibrator type on an artificial mastoid. Results: It was found that B 81 reaches 10. 7 - 22. 0 dB higher maximum (@ THD. 6 % or V-in. 6 V-RMS) <b>hearing</b> <b>levels</b> than B 71 for frequencies below 1500 Hz, and had significantly lower THD up to 1000 Hz. There was no statistically significant difference between their frequency response, except a deviation at the mid frequencies (alpha = 0. 01) where B 81 was more efficient and the electrical impedances were practically the same. Conclusions: In general, B 81 had an improved electro-acoustic performance compared to B 71 and is compatible with same audiometers.

The whole subjects of this study were 414 ears with inner ear hearing loss, 278 ears with normal hearing, 113 ears of neonates, 62 ears of the patients who were administered cis-platin, and 15 ears with functional hearing loss. At first, 5 studies described below were performed to examine the characters and reliability of DPOAE as a clinical test: 1) The average DPOAE-gram of norrnal hearing ears. 2) The comparison between DPOAE <b>levels</b> <b>and</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>levels.</b> 3) The reproducibility of DPOAE on the different examinations in the same subjects. 4) The influences of respiratory noises on DPOAE levels. 5) The detection of fine cochlea damages using DPOAE which can not be detected by pure tone audiometry. Then the following 2 clinical studies were performed: 6) The utility of DPOAE in neonates and children. 7) The utility of DPOAE in functional deafness cases. From these studies, the following characters of DPOAE were comfirmed. Since DPOAE levels have correlations with <b>hearing</b> <b>levels</b> at the same frequencies, normal hearing could be determined by the DPOAE level. DPOAE is useful for following chronological changes of hearing, because of its reproducibility in a same subject at different times. The early and fine damages on the cochlea that could not be detected by conventional pure tone audiometry might be detected by DPOAE in some cases. Considering these results, I concluded that DPOAE could be a new objective hearing test which would help the conventinal examinations. Especially in infants who can't be examined with pure tone audiometry, DPOAE is thought to be a very useful examination...|$|R
40|$|The {{longitudinal}} {{relationship between}} central plastic changes and clinical presentations of peripheral hearing impairment remains unknown. Previously, we reported a unique plastic pattern of "healthy-side dominance" in acute unilateral idiopathic sudden {{sensorineural hearing loss}} (ISSNHL). This study aimed to explore whether such hemispheric asymmetry bears any prognostic relevance to ISSNHL along the disease course. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG), inter-hemispheric differences in peak dipole amplitude and latency of N 100 m to monaural tones were evaluated in 21 controls and 21 ISSNHL patients at two stages: initial and fixed stage (1 month later). Dynamics/Prognostication of hemispheric asymmetry were assessed by the interplay between <b>hearing</b> level/hearing gain <b>and</b> ipsilateral/contralateral ratio (I/C) of N 100 m latency and amplitude. Healthy-side dominance of N 100 m amplitude was observed in ISSNHL initially. The pattern changed with disease process. There is {{a strong correlation between}} the <b>hearing</b> <b>level</b> at the fixed stage and initial I/C(amplitude) on affected-ear stimulation in ISSNHL. The optimal cut-off value with the best prognostication effect for the hearing improvement at the fixed stage was an initial I/C(latency) on affected-ear stimulation of 1. 34 (between subgroups of complete and partial recovery) and an initial I/C(latency) on healthy-ear stimulation of 0. 76 (between subgroups of partial and no recovery), respectively. This study suggested that a dynamic process of central auditory plasticity can be induced by peripheral lesions. The hemispheric asymmetry at the initial stage bears an excellent prognostic potential for the treatment outcomes <b>and</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>level</b> at the fixed stage in ISSNHL. Our study demonstrated that such brain signature of central auditory plasticity in terms of both N 100 m latency and amplitude at defined time can serve as a prognostication predictor for ISSNHL.

40|$|Background: People’s {{devotion to}} music and the {{proliferation}} of personal listening devices (PLDs) has become a cultural phenomenon, yielding concerns from researchers and media that noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is increasing substantially in the 21 st century. Research has indicated that young adults, more than ever, are engaging in risky listening behaviors. There is a lack of audiological evidence in regards to NIHL and studies do not include history of otitis media (OM) in their research. Purpose: To identify whether there is a correlation between NIHL and preferred listening levels on PLDs, to determine the percentage of those engaged in risky listening habits, and to identify if a positive history of OM is linked to increased hearing thresholds in young adults. Method: 52 participants, aged 21 - 34 years, completed a questionnaire specifying medical history <b>and</b> <b>hearing</b> habits. Audiological assessments including pure tone audiometry and gap detection were incorporated. Participants PLD listening levels were measured. Results: 4 - 8 % of participants were found to engage in potentially risky listening behavior using PLDs for 4 - 6 hours per day at 60 % volume. 6 % of participants presented with moderate NIHL, while 23 % fell above the 25 dB threshold, indicating mild NIHL. There was no significant relationship found between listening habits or history of OM and NIHL/hearing thresholds. Conclusion: According to the findings in this study; the majority of users in this population are not at risk for NIHL and only a few engage in risky listening behaviors. Additionally, no significant relationship was found between OM in childhood <b>and</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>levels</b> in adulthood...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} propose an ototoxicity grading system {{sensitive}} {{to the effect of}} ototoxicity on specific daily life situations like speech intelligibility and the perception of ultra-high sounds and to test its feasibility compared to current criteria. Pure tone averages (PTAs) for speech perception (1 - 2 - 4 kHz) and ultra-high frequencies (8 - 10 - 12. 5 kHz) were incorporated. Threshold shift <b>and</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>level</b> posttreatment were taken into account. Criteria were tested on head and neck cancer patients treated with (chemo-) radiotherapy ([C]RT) and compared with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4 (CTCAEv 4) and the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association criteria (ASHA). Grades 1 and 2 were based on threshold shifts from baseline (in dB) and subjective complaints. Grades 3 and 4 were defined as treatment-induced hearing loss of ≥ 35 dB at PTA 1 - 2 - 4 kHz and ≥ 70 dB at PTA 1 - 2 - 4 kHz, respectively. In high-dose cisplatin CRT incidences by the new criteria, CTCAEv 4 and ASHA were comparable (78 %- 88 %). In RT and low-dose cisplatin CRT, incidences were 36 % to 39 % in the new criteria versus 22 % to 53 % in CTCAEv 4 and ASHA. The new criteria show an increased sensitivity to ototoxicity compared to CTCAEv 4 and ASHA and provide insight into the effect of hearing loss on certain daily life situations. The new grading system seems feasible for clinic and research purpose...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the combined effect of noise exposure and additional risk factors on permanent hearing threshold shift. Three additional risk factors were: exposure to organic solvents, smoking and elevated blood pressure. The data on exposure and health status of employees were collected in 24 facto-ries. The study group comprised of 3741 noise male exposed workers of: mean age 39 ± 8 years, mean tenure 16 ± 7 years and LEX, 8 h = 86 ± 5 dB. For each subject, <b>hearing</b> <b>level</b> was measured with pure tone audiometry, blood pressure and noise exposure were assessed from the records of local occupational health care and oblig-atory noise measurements performed by employers. Smoking and solvent exposure were assessed with questionnaire. The study group was divided into subgroups with respect to the considered risk factors. In the analysis, the distribution of <b>hearing</b> <b>level</b> of each subgroup was compared to the predicted one which the standard cal-culation method described in ISO 1999 : 1990. For each of the considered risk factors, the difference between measured <b>and</b> calculated <b>hearing</b> <b>level</b> distribution was used to establish, by the least square method, a noise dose related correction square func-tion for the standard method. The considered risk factors: solvent exposure, smoking and elevated blood pressure combined with noise exposure, may increase degree of hearing loss...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the association of noise sensitivity with self-reported <b>hearing</b> disability <b>and</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>levels,</b> with consideration of the role of self-reported history of noise exposure <b>and</b> use of <b>hearing</b> protectors. The study is based on the Finnish Twin Cohort. In 1988, a noise questionnaire was sent to 1005 twin pairs, 1495 individuals (688 men, 807 women) replied. The age range was 31 - 88 years. Information on some potential confounders was obtained from the questionnaire in 1981 for the same individuals. A subsample of thirty-eight elderly women with noise sensitivity response from 1988 had audiometry data from 2000 to 2001. Noise sensitivity was associated with self-reported hearing disability among all subjects [odds ratio (OR) 1. 55, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 14 - 2. 12] and among women (OR 1. 90, 95 % CI 1. 19 - 3. 04), but no-more significantly among men (OR 1. 31, 95 % CI 0. 86 - 1. 98). The association was primarily seen among younger subjects (50 years or less). The difference between noise sensitive and non-noise sensitive elderly women in the average of thresholds at frequencies of 0. 5 - 4 kHz in the better ear was not significant (Pr = 0. 18). Noise sensitivity did not modify the association of hearing disability with the self-reported history of occupational noise exposure. Noise sensitivity was associated with the use of hearing protectors at work. The study shows the importance of recognizing the noise sensitive in noise effect studies, since sensitivity in annoyance has implications in most of the effect categories...|$|R

AimTo investigate the correlation between auditory steady-state response (ASSR) with other tests in children with sensorineural hearing loss. MethodsProspective cross-sectional contemporary cohort study. Twenty-three children (ages 1 to 7; mean, 3 years old) were submitted to ASSR, behavioral audiometry, click audiometry brain stem response (ABR), tone burst ABR, <b>and</b> predicting <b>hearing</b> <b>level</b> from the acoustic reflex. Resultsthe correlation between behavioral thresholds and ASSR was (0. 70 - 0. 93), for the ABR tone burst it was (0. 73 - 0. 93), for the ABR click it was (0. 83 - 0. 89) only at 2 k and 4 kHz. The match between the ASSR <b>and</b> the <b>hearing</b> threshold prediction rule was considered moderate. Conclusionthere was a significant correlation between the ASSR and audiometry, as well as between ABR click (2 k and 4 kHz) and for the ABR tone burst.

40|$|Noise {{exposure}} {{may result}} in production of auto-antibodies against heat shock proteins (Hsps), which might be of significance in the pathogenesis or prognosis (or both) of auto-immune ear diseases. However, {{it is not known}} whether these antibodies are associated with noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) in workers exposed to noise in occupational settings. Using immunoblotting with human recombinant Hsps, audiological assessment, and multivariate logistic regression models, we investigated the presence of antibodies against Hsp 60 and Hsp 70 <b>and</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>levels,</b> <b>and</b> analyzed their associations with NIHL in 399 workers exposed to noise between 75 and 115 dB. Our findings showed that the prevalence of positive anti-Hsp 70 was significantly higher in the workers with slight <b>and</b> moderate high-frequency <b>hearing</b> loss than in normal workers (P < 0. 05). Furthermore, the prevalence of positive anti-Hsp 60 in workers with moderate low-frequency NIHL was significantly higher than in the normal (P < 0. 01). The levels of anti-Hsp 70 and anti-Hsp 60 seemed correlated, and the level of anti-Hsp 70 better predicted the level of anti-Hsp 60. An elevated plasma level of anti-Hsp 70 was associated with a nonsignificantly increased risk of high-frequency NIHL (adjusted OR = 1. 45; 95 % CI = 0. 89 – 2. 36) and an elevated plasma level of anti-Hsp 60 was associated with a nonsignificantly increased risk of the low-frequency NIHL (adjusted OR = 2. 25; 95 % CI = 0. 85 – 5. 96). These results suggest that the production of anti-Hsp 60 and anti-Hsp 70 {{may play a role in}} the pathogenesis of NIHL, and that anti-Hsps may be a risk factor. The precise mechanisms for the elevation of antibodies against Hsps caused by noise exposure and their possible role in the development of NIHL warrant further investigations...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Inflammaging, a {{state of}} chronic {{inflammation}} in the elderly, is now {{thought to be a}} key element of the ageing process and contributor to age-related disease. In a previously published study, we identified a significant association between inflammation levels and severity of presbycusis among individuals aged 63 to 73 ('younger old") within an available audiometric range 0. 5 to 4 kHz. Our aim was to see if this association would be identified among participants in the MRC national study of <b>hearing,</b> <b>and</b> whether the strength of the association would increase with greater age, or for very low or very high audiometric frequencies. Design: Cross-sectional analysis of cohort data. Study sample: Three hundred and sixty community-dwelling adults age 60 years and over, representing all those with white blood cell count and audiometric data available. Results: A significant independent association between (higher) WBC <b>and</b> (worse) <b>hearing</b> <b>level</b> was identified. This effect increased with age. The strongest association was among those over 75, for whom average <b>hearing</b> threshold <b>levels</b> among those with lower WBC was 17 dB better than those with higher WBC.

40|$|The {{goals of}} this study were to {{estimate}} the risk for lowered speech-language outcomes associated with early recurrent otitis media with effusion (OME) with <b>and</b> without <b>hearing</b> loss <b>and</b> to develop a preliminary descriptive-explanatory model for the findings. Three statistical approaches were used to assess associations among OME, <b>hearing</b> loss, <b>and</b> speech-language outcomes. Participants were a subsample of 70 children followed prospectively in the Dallas Cooperative Project on Early <b>Hearing</b> <b>and</b> Language Development (Friel-Patti & Finitzo, 1990). Findings indicated that <b>hearing</b> <b>levels</b> at 12 – 18 months were significantly associated with speech delay and low language outcomes at 3 years of age. The risk for subclinical or clinical speech delay at 3 years of age was 2 % for children with less than 20 dB average <b>hearing</b> <b>levels</b> at 12 – 18 months and 33 % for children with greater than 20 dB average <b>hearing</b> <b>levels</b> at 12 – 18 months. A structural equation model (Jöreskog & Sörbom, 1993) indicated that the significant and substantial effects of <b>hearing</b> <b>levels</b> at 12 – 18 months on speech status at 3 years were significantly mediated by language status at 3 years.

40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} {{the differences between}} acoustic trauma (AT) {{and other types of}} acute noise-induced hearing loss (ANIHL), we performed a literature search and case reviews. Methods: The literature search based on online databases was completed in September 2016. Articles on ANIHL and steroid treatment for human subjects were reviewed. The source sounds and treatment sequelae of our accumulated cases were also reviewed. Hearing loss caused by gun-shots and explosions was categorized into the AT group, while hearing loss caused by concerts and other noises was categorized into the ANIHL group. Results: Systemic steroid treatment {{did not appear to be}} effective, at least in the AT group, based on both the literature and our case reviews. However, effective recovery after treatment including steroids was observed in the ANIHL group. The difference in hearing recovery between the AT and ANIHL groups was statistically significant (p[*]=[*]. 030), although differences in age, days from the onset to treatment <b>and</b> pretreatment <b>hearing</b> <b>levels</b> were not significant. Conclusions: Hearing recovery from AT is very poor, whereas, ANIHL is recoverable to some extent.

40|$|Aging is {{associated}} with increased risk of cardiovascular and neurodegenerative disorders {{and an increase in}} their risk factors, such as decreased concentrations of folate and increased concentrations of homocysteine. The association of folate and homocysteine with age-related disease and, most importantly, the causality needs to be assessed for effective public health policy. The pathogenic mechanisms, which link these risk factors to age-related diseases may include non-specific disease mechanisms such as inflammation.   We investigated the association of folate and homocysteine with cardiovascular disease risk, cognitive performance on a battery of neuropsychological tests <b>and</b> <b>hearing</b> thresholds in middle-aged and elderly men and post-menopausal women using cross-sectional data obtained from the baseline measurements of the FACIT trial. FACIT is an acronym for Folic Acid and Carotid Intima-media Thickness. The FACIT trial investigates the effects of daily folic acid supplementation (0. 8 mg/d) for three years on age-related parameters, carotid artery wall thickness and arterial stiffness, cognitive performance <b>and</b> <b>hearing.</b> Furthermore, we investigated whether supplementation with folic acid after one year will lead to a reduction in plasma concentrations of inflammation markers in the final 530 participants of the FACIT trial. Low folate status and high concentrations of homocysteine were associated with increased carotid intima-media thickness, a marker of cardiovascular disease risk. However, the relationships were explained to a great part by conventional risk factors (mean difference between first vs. fourth quartile of erythrocyte folate 0. 03 mm, 95 % confidence interval - 0. 002 to 0. 06 mm). Neither folate nor homocysteine were associated with carotid distension, a measure of arterial stiffness. Decreased concentrations of erythrocyte folate and increased concentrations of homocysteine were independently associated with poor cognitive performance. The cognitive domains with the greatest variability with age, like memory and speed-related functions, were also the domains with the strongest relation with low folate levels. Unexpectedly, folate, not homocysteine, was directly associated with hearing impairment; however, this association was confined to subjects with the 5, 10 -methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) 677 C allele. Subjects with the MTHFR 677 TT genotype had better cognitive performance <b>and</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>levels</b> than subjects with the CC or CT genotype. Finally, inflammation markers did not respond to one-year folic acid supplementation, despite a 25 % decrease in homocysteine concentrations. Conclusions and implications; mso-ansi-language:EN-US;font-style:normal'>Increased concentrations of folate, independent of its role in homocysteine-lowering, are weakly associated with decreased risk of cardiovascular disease and better cognitive function, but not with hearing acuity. Further research is required to establish whether these relationships are causal and the mechanism responsible for disease. If faced with the decision whether to fortify the national food chain with folic acid, public health policy makers should wait for the large trials to report their findings on the effects of folic acid—alone or in combination with other B vitamins—on cardiovascular disease and dementia...|$|R
