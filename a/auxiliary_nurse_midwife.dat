40|$|Background: Effective {{monitoring}} and supervision {{of health care}} programs depend on complete, accurate, and timely flow of data. Mother and Child Tracking System (MCTS) is a centralized information technology (IT) -based application launched in 2009 for improving the delivery of {{maternal and child health}} care services through name-based tracking. There is minimal evidence in the literature evaluating the operational aspects of such a name-based tracking system even after 5 years of its implementation. Objective: The present study was thus conducted to understand the opportunities and challenges in the operationalization of MCTS strategy in a district in Haryana and to understand the stakeholder′s perspectives. Materials and Methods: Performance of Routine Information System Management (PRISM) framework was used. This cross-sectional study was conducted in Shahzadpur block of Ambala district, Haryana, India involving in-depth interviews of health care providers and clients in 12 subcenters (SCs) and two primary health centers (PHCs). Results: Lack of appropriate training, overburdened data entry operator (DEO) and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>nurse</b> <b>midwife</b> (ANM), poor Internet connectivity, slow server speed, and frequent power failures were revealed as major limitations for the effective implementation of MCTS.

A village level community health worker “Accredited Social Health Activist” (ASHA) ’ acts as an interface between the community and the public health system. Therefore present study was conducted to access the socio-demographic profile of ASHA workers and to assess the knowledge, awareness and practice of their responsibilities. Methodology- The study was conducted in the rural field practice area of the department of community medicine, MMIMSR, Mullana. All 105 ASHA workers in the area were included in the study and were interviewed using a self designed semi-structured questionnaire. Data was analyzed using SPSS and valid conclusions were drawn. Results- Majority of ASHA workers were aware about helping in immunization, accompanying clients for delivery, providing ANC and family planning services as a part of responsibility. Only 17 - 19 % of ASHAs knew about registration of births and deaths, assisting <b>Auxiliary</b> <b>Nurse</b> <b>Midwife</b> (ANM) in village health planning, creating awareness on basic sanitation and personal hygiene.

40|$|Background: Despite the {{existence}} of Registration of Birth and Death Act (1969), Civil Registration System (CRS) in India registered only 68. 3 % of the births and 63. 2 % of the deaths. Hence, National Population Policy (2000) emphasized {{the need to improve}} registration of vital events. In 2005, Haryana initiated policy changes to enhance registration of vital events. We evaluated the impact of these policy changes on CRS in 2009. Materials and Methods: Records and reports of CRS were reviewed. On the basis of the birth and deaths reported by the Sample Registration System, the proportion of births and deaths registered by CRS were estimated using the projected population from 2001 Census. Results: Before 2005, Police Stations were the registration centers in rural Haryana. On 1 st January 2005, the birth and death registration was made the responsibility of Primary Health Centers (PHCs). Medical Officers at PHCs were designated as Registrar and Pharmacists as Sub-Registrar of Births and Deaths. <b>Auxiliary</b> <b>Nurse</b> <b>Midwife</b> and Anganwadi Workers facilitated the registration. Till 2004, the registration of births was stagnant at the level of 70 % for several years, which increased to 95 % by 2009. Similarly registration of death events increased from 73. 5 % to 92. 1 %.

40|$|India {{with its}} one billion people {{contributes}} to about 20 % of all maternal {{deaths in the}} world. Even though infant mortality has declined in India maternal mortality has remained high at about 540 per 100, 000 live births. Recent scientific evidence shows that access and use of high quality emergency obstetric care {{is the key to}} reducing maternal mortality and that high risk approach in ante natal care do not help in reducing maternal mortality significantly. This paper analyzes the policy level barriers, which restrict access of rural women to life saving emergency obstetric care in rural India. The paper is based on study of policies, research reports and experience of working in the area of maternal health over last several years. The paper describes how policies restrict basic doctors from performing obstetric surgical procedures including cesarean section even in remote areas where there is no specialist obstetrician available. The para-medical staff such as the <b>Auxiliary</b> <b>Nurse</b> <b>Midwife</b> is also not allowed to manage obstetric emergencies in rural areas. The policy also does not allow nurses or basic doctors to give anesthesia. As there is limited number of anesthetists in rural areas, this further reduces access to life saving emergency surgery. New blood banking rules are very utopian, requiring many unnecessary things for licensing of a blood bank. Due to this, already limited access to blood transfusion in rural area has further reduced. Thus many restrictive polices of the government have made emergency obstetric care inaccessible in rural areas leading to continued higher maternal mortality in India. ...|$|E

Methods: We undertook an economic costing of health services delivered by CHWs, from a health system perspective. Bottom-up costing method was used {{to collect data on}} resources spent in 50 randomly selected sub-centres selected from 4 districts. Mean unit cost along with its 95 % confidence intervals were estimated using bootstrap method. Multiple linear regression model was used to standardize cost and assess its determinants. Results: Annually it costs INR 1. 03 million (USD 19, 381), or INR 187 (USD 3. 5) per capita per year, to provide a package of preventive, curative and promotive services through community health workers. Unit costs for antenatal care, postnatal care, DOTS treatment and immunization were INR 525 (USD 10) per full ANC care, INR 767 (USD 14) per PNC case registered, INR 974 (USD 18) per DOTS treatment completed and INR 97 (USD 1. 8) per child immunized in routine immunization respectively.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In India, the {{hypertensive}} disorders {{of pregnancy}} and postpartum haemorrhage {{are responsible for}} nearly 40 % of all maternal deaths. Most of these deaths occur in primary health settings which frequently lack essential equipment and medication, are understaffed, and have limited or no access to specialist care. Community health care workers are regarded as essential providers of basic maternity care; {{and the quality of}} care they provide is dependent on the level of knowledge and skills they possess. However, there is limited research regarding their ability to manage pregnancy complications. This study aims to describe the current state of knowledge regarding pre-eclampsia and eclampsia among community health care workers (<b>auxiliary</b> <b>nurse</b> <b>midwives,</b> accredited social health activists, staff nurses) in northern Karnataka, India. Furthermore, this study describes the treatment approaches used by various cadres of community health workers for these conditions. The findings of this study can help plan focussed training sessions to build upon their strengths and to address the identified gaps. METHODS: Data were collected {{as part of a larger}} study aimed at assessing the feasibility of community-based treatment for pre-eclampsia. Eight focus group discussions were conducted in 2012 - 2013 in northern Karnataka State: four with staff <b>nurses</b> and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>nurse</b> <b>midwives</b> and four with accredited social health activists. In addition, twelve <b>auxiliary</b> <b>nurse</b> <b>midwives</b> and staff <b>nurses</b> completed questionnaires to explore their competence and self-efficacy in managing pre-eclampsia. Qualitative data were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and translated for thematic analysis using NVivo 10. RESULTS: Community health workers described their understanding of the origins of hypertension and seizures in pregnancy. Psychological explanations of hypertension were most commonly reported: stress, tension, and fear. The most common explanation for eclampsia was not receiving a tetanus vaccination. Despite some common misperceptions regarding aetiology, these community health workers demonstrated a good grasp of the potential consequences of hypertension in pregnancy. According to <b>auxiliary</b> <b>nurse</b> <b>midwives</b> and staff <b>nurses,</b> if hypertension was detected they encouraged rest, decreased salt intake, iron supplementation and tetanus vaccination. In addition, some staff nurses administered antihypertensives, MgSO 4, or other anticonvulsants. All <b>auxiliary</b> <b>nurse</b> <b>midwives</b> had some awareness of MgSO 4, but none had administered it themselves. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that knowledge regarding the aetiology of pre-eclampsia was limited. Nevertheless, their basic knowledge and skills could be strengthened to more effectively manage the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy in their communities. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT 01911494...|$|R

40|$|Background: In India, an {{estimated}} four million deaths occur {{each year in}} the neonatal period. Effective intervention at primary care level can prevent a large proportion of these deaths. Objective: To assess the impact of training on knowledge and skill regarding newborn care among <b>Auxiliary</b> <b>Nurse</b> <b>Midwife</b> (ANM). Methods: A total of 180 ANMs who attended skilled birth attendant training program under RCH were included in the study. The study was conducted over a period of 2 years from May 2013 to June 2015. A 14 training sessions each lasting for 15 days were conducted in 2 years and each session had a batch of 12 - 15 ANMs. They were assessed for the impact of training at the end of training on semi-structured and pretested schedule. Results: The knowledge of health workers related to the care of a newborn at birth was not adequate. An average of 94. 8 ANMs responded correctly to pre-test questions whereas after training there was a significant improvement in the post-test score. After training an average of 160. 5 ANMs (p= 0. 001) responded correctly. A mean of 84 ANMs had adequate knowledge related to danger signs in the neonatal period before training. After training significant number of ANMs (mean= 156, p= 0. 002) responded correctly. Baseline knowledge related to feeding of the newborn was also inadequate (mean= 120), but after training there was a significant improvement, 164 ANMs respond correctly (p= 0. 02).

40|$|The {{problem of}} child {{mortality}} in India {{is one of}} the biggest that today 2 ̆ 7 s developing nation is dealing with. A complex matrix of different societal and behavioral forces is present at the root of this problem. Not only are absolute numbers of child deaths high in India, but the Child Mortality Rate (CMR) is also substantially higher among developing nations. Different sources of information at national as well as at state levels give feedback to the Indian Government on this nationwide issue. Looking closely at the west coast of India, the State of Maharashtra is having systematic problems in recording each child death. The way of operation of information sources and their accountability raises some serious issues about their efficiency, and the state governments are completely reliant on these sources to make decisions that save a child 2 ̆ 7 s life.

40|$|Background: Uttar Pradesh (UP) is {{the most}} populous state in India. The {{maternal}} mortality ratio, infant mortality rate, and fertility rates are all {{higher than the national}} average. Sixty percent of UP inhabitants live in rural communities. The reasons behind the poor state of health and services in many areas of UP are inadequate knowledge and availability in communities of healthy behaviors, and information on available government health services. Methods: World Vision, Inc. implemented a three-and-half year mobilizing plan for maternal and neonatal health through a birth spacing and advocacy project (MOMENT), partnering with local organizations in rural Hardoi and urban slums of Lucknow districts in UP. World Vision used print, audio, visual media, and house-to-house contacts to educate communities on timing and spacing of pregnancies; and the benefits of seeking and using maternal and child health services (MCH) including immunization and family planning (FP). This paper focuses on World Vision’s social accountability strategy – Citizen Voice and Action (CVA) and interface meetings – used in Hardoi that helped educate and empower Village Health Sanitation and Nutrition Committees (VHSNCs) and village leaders to access government untied funds to improve community social and health services. Results: Forty VHSNCs were revived in 24 months. Nine local leaders accessed government untied funds. In addition, increased knowledge of the benefits of timing and spacing of pregnancies, maternal child health, family planning services, and access to community entitlements led the community to embrace and contribute their time to rebuild and re-open 17 non-functional <b>Auxiliary</b> <b>Nurse</b> <b>Midwife</b> (ANM) sub-centers. Seventeen ANMs received refresher training to provide quality care. Sub-center data showed that 1, 121 and 3, 156 women opted for intra-uterine contraceptive device and oral pills, respectively, and 29, 316 condoms were distributed. Conclusion: In Hardoi, UP, education using CVA and interface meetings are contributing to {{an increase in the number}} of government sub-centers that integrate contraceptive services with other services such as immunization and antenatal care. This brings care closer and makes it more accessible to women and children, reducing travel time and cost to families who would have otherwise sought these services from higher level facilities.

40|$|Introduction There exist several {{barriers}} to maternal health service utilization in developing countries. Most {{of the previous}} studies conducted in India have focused on demand-side barriers, while only a few have touched upon supply-side barriers. None of the previous studies in India have investigated the factors that affect maternal health care utilization at health sub-centers (HSCs) in India, {{despite the fact that}} these institutions, which are the geographically closest available public health care facilities in rural areas, {{play a significant role in}} providing affordable maternal health care. Therefore, this study aims to examine the supply-side determinants of maternal service utilization at HSCs in rural India. Data and Methods This study uses health facility data from the nationally representative District-Level Household Survey, which was administered in 2007 – 2008 to examine the effect of supply-side variables on the utilization of maternal health care services across HSCs in rural India. Since the dependent variables (the number of antenatal registrations, in-facility deliveries, and postnatal care services) are count variables and exhibit considerable variability, the data were analyzed using negative binomial regression instead of Poisson regression. Results The results show that those HSCs run by a contractual <b>auxiliary</b> <b>nurse</b> <b>midwife</b> (ANM) are likely to offer a lower volume of services when compared to those run by a permanent ANM. The availability of obstetric drugs, weighing scales, and blood pressure equipment is associated with the increased utilization of antenatal and postnatal services. The unavailability of a labor/examination table and bed screen is associated with a reduction in the number of deliveries and postnatal services. The utilization of services is expected to increase if essential facilities, such as water, telephones, toilets, and electricity, are available at the HSCs. Monitoring of ANM’s work by Village Health and Sanitation Committee (VHSC) and providing in-service training to ANM appear to have positive impacts on service utilization. The distance of ANM’s actual residence from the sub-center village where she works is negatively associated with the utilization of delivery and postnatal services. These findings are robust to the inclusion of several demand-side factors. Conclusion To improve maternal health care utilization at HSCs, the government shouldensure the availability of basic infrastructure, drugs, and equipment at all locations. Monitoring of the ANMs’ work by VHSCs could play an important role in improving health care utilization at the HSCs; therefore, it is important to establish VHSCs in each sub-center village. The relatively low utilization of maternity services in those HSCs that are run solely by contractual ANMs requires further investigation...|$|E

40|$|Maternal {{mortality}} in Nepal {{is estimated to}} be around 540 deaths per 100, 000 births. 1 One major factor is low use of maternal health care, despite government efforts to improve services, including an expanded network of rural clinics and the training of <b>auxiliary</b> <b>nurse</b> <b>midwives.</b> 2 Fewer than 40 % of women receive any antenatal care from a trained provider, and fewer than 10 % of births take place in a health facility. 3 In seeking to explain these low levels of health care use, most research has focused on the provision and geograph-ic accessibility of services. However, no studies have looked at how sociocultural factors, such as inequitable gender roles and women’s position within the household, have influenced use of services. Earlier work in South Asia has suggested various ways in which gender roles and relations may operate to restric...|$|R

The national implementation of CBM follows an extensive pilot project in nine of India’s 22 states from May 2007 onwards.Village Health and Sanitation Committees (VHSCs) are composed of (a) members of local government (Gram Panchayat), (b) community health workers (Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs)) (c) outreach functionaries of the public health system (<b>Auxiliary</b> <b>Nurse</b> <b>Midwives</b> (ANMs), Multi-Purpose Workers (MPWs), and preschool/nutrition workers (Anganwadi workers)) and (d) representatives from community groups.|$|R
40|$|Background: In India, the {{practice}} of breastfeeding is almost universal, but initiation of breastfeeding is generally quite late and colostrum is discarded. Integrated Management of Neonatal and Childhood Illness (IMNCI) strategy recommended systematic assessment of breastfeeding and emphasized counseling of the mother on proper positioning and attachment of infant to the breast. Objective: To assess breastfeeding among mothers of below six months children in rural Wardha. Materials and Methods: The present cross-sectional study was undertaken in surrounding 23 villages of Kasturba Rural Health Training Center (KRHTC), Anji. Two <b>Auxiliary</b> <b>Nurse</b> <b>Midwives</b> (ANMs) trained in IMNCI paid house visits to 99 mothers {{during the study period}} and undertook the assessment of breastfeeding using IMNCI assessment form for young infants. <b>Auxiliary</b> <b>Nurse</b> <b>Midwives</b> observed and recorded the positioning and attachment of infant to the breast as per IMNCI guidelines. The data were entered and analyzed using Epi_Info (version 6. 04 d) software package. Results: Most of the deliveries 94 (94. 9 &#x 0025;) took place in the healthcare facilities. Majority 61 (61. 6 &#x 0025;) newborn babies had received breastfeeding within half an hour. About half of the mothers had any of the feeding problems like feeding less than eight times in 24 h, giving any other food or drinks or is low weight for age. Significantly more mothers with feeding problems had problems in positioning and attachment of infant to the breast as compared with those mothers who did not have any feeding problems. Conclusions: In the settings, where practice of institutional delivery is high, the staff of healthcare facility should ensure education of the mothers regarding position and attachment of infant to the breast before discharge from the healthcare facility. At the village level, Village Health Nutrition Day (VHND) can be utilized for health education of future mothers and support for the breastfeeding mothers. The IMNCI assessment form for young infant should also include assessment of positioning of infant...|$|R
