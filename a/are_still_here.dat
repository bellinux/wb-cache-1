25|$|In {{the center}} of {{downtown}} is the Church of San Francisco, finished {{at the beginning of}} the 18th century and from then on the most important in town, serving as the cathedral until the 20th century. It and the attached cloister is all that is left of a large complex that included several chapels and an orchard that extended for blocks to the east and south. On the facade, there is a depicting of Saint James fighting the Moors, cutting the head off of one. The main altar is Neoclassic, and replaced what reputedly was a masterpiece of Baroque design. This has happened frequently in the city; those Baroque altars not plundered over the course of Mexican history were replaced by newer designs. Older Baroque side altarpieces <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>here,</b> and are covered in gold leaf. Other notable pieces here include a large Baroque music stand and the seating of the choir section both done by architect Francisco Eduardo Tresguerras of Celaya in the 18th century. There are also sculptures done by Mariano Montenegro and Mariano Arce.|$|E

We refuse {{to be a part of}} your sick game. You might think that you have won now, but you are mistaken. You have not broken us. You have shown us what we have the strength to do.

2500|$|As an {{isolated}} island, Isle Royale initially had neither wolves nor moose. The moose {{are believed to}} have either swam across Lake Superior from Minnesota in the early 1900s or were stocked on the island by man for the purpose of recreational hunting. [...] In 1949 a pair of wolves crossed an ice bridge from Ontario to the island during a harsh winter. But because only one pair of wolves migrated to the island, they have suffered from severe inbreeding. According to Rolf Peterson, a professor at Michigan Technological University and the lead wolf-moose researcher, [...] "Moose were isolated here 100 years ago. Most of the genes <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>here,</b> but they have enough population (to compensate). There are so few wolves that they have lost genetic variability. The scientific dogma suggests that {{they are not going to}} make it." [...] In fact, all of the wolves' DNA on Isle Royale can be traced back to one ancestor. [...] Inbreeding leads to mutations and fitness problems, often accompanied by violent social rejection by other wolves.|$|E
