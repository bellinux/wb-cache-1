5|$|The Mexican Constitution of 1824 liberalized the country's {{immigration}} policies, allowing {{foreigners to}} settle in border regions such as Mexican Texas. People flocked to the area; an 1834 census estimated the Texas population at 7,800Mexicans and 30,000English-speaking people primarily from the United States. Among the immigrants was William Barret Travis, an Alabama native who had variously worked as a teacher, a newspaper publisher, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>lawyer.</b> An avid reader, Travis often devoured a novel in a single day. His taste ran primarily to romantic adventure and history, especially the novels of Sir Walter Scott and Benjamin Disraeli and the historical works of Herodotus. Historians have speculated that Travis's choice of reading material may have affected his behavior—Travis {{was known for his}} melodramatic ways.|$|E
5|$|Macdonald {{continued}} {{to expand his}} practice while being appointed director of many companies, mainly in Kingston. Macdonald became both a director of <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>lawyer</b> for the new Commercial Bank of the Midland District. Throughout the 1840s, Macdonald invested heavily in real estate, including commercial properties in downtown Toronto. Meanwhile, {{he was suffering from}} some illness, and in 1841, his father died. Sick and grieving, he decided to take a lengthy holiday in Britain in early 1842. He left for the journey well supplied with money, as he spent the last three days before his departure gambling at the card game loo and winning substantially. Sometime during his two months in Britain, he met his first cousin, Isabella Clark. As Macdonald did not mention her in his letters home, the circumstances of their meeting are not known. In late 1842, Isabella journeyed to Kingston to visit with a sister. The visit stretched for nearly a year before John and Isabella Macdonald married on 1 September 1843.|$|E
5|$|Gray became {{engaged to}} Jane Lathrop Loring of Boston in May 1847. Two of Gray's younger brothers, George and Joseph, were {{students}} at Harvard {{in the late}} 1840s and lived with Gray. During his junior year, George caught typhoid fever in late 1847 and died on January9, 1848, in the Loring house in Boston. This {{is part of the}} reason Gray's marriage was delayed from fall 1847 to spring 1848. Gray and Jane Loring married on May4, 1848. Her parents were Charles Greely Loring, a member of the Harvard Corporation <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>lawyer,</b> and Anna Pierce (Brace) Loring. Her family was Unitarian, like most faculty and staff of Harvard at the time. Both of them kept to their separate religious denominations yet seem to have had no difficulties over it. They had no children. Jane Gray accompanied her husband on most of his expeditions. Gray was a devout Presbyterian and was a member of First Church in Cambridge, a Congregational church, where he served as a deacon. He was also an ardent empiricist in the tradition of John Locke and John Stuart Mill. When the congregation moved into its present building in 1872, at 11Garden Street, Gray planted two Kentucky yellowwood trees, Cladrastis kentukea, in front of the church. They stood until October 2014.|$|E

25|$|Thus, {{any work}} of art that existed prior to 1945 has a {{potential}} provenance problem. This is a serious obstacle for anyone who currently collects pre-1945 European art. To avoid wasting thousands or even millions of dollars, they must verify (normally {{with the assistance of}} an art historian <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>lawyer</b> specializing in art law) that potential acquisitions were not stolen by the Nazis from a Holocaust victim. The highest-profile legal case arising from this problem is the U.S. Supreme Court decision of Republic of Austria v. Altmann (2006), in which the Court held that U.S. courts could retroactively apply the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 to Austria for torts that allegedly occurred before 1976.|$|E

State senator Louis Louaillier had written an anonymous piece in the New Orleans newspaper, challenging Jackson's refusal to release the militia after the British ceded the field of battle. Jackson did not relent his campaign of suppressing dissent until after ordering the arrest of a Louisiana legislator, a federal judge, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>lawyer,</b> and after the intervention of State Judge Joshua Lewis. Lewis was simultaneously serving under Jackson in the militia, and also had signed a writ of habeas corpus against Jackson, his commanding officer, seeking Judge Hall's release.|$|E

Ben explains that as {{heir to the}} entire exploration party, Smith is extremely wealthy, and following a legal precedent set during the colonisation of the Moon, he could be considered owner of Mars itself. His arrival on Earth has prompted a political power struggle that puts his life in danger. Ben persuades her to bug Smith's room and then publishes stories to bait the government into releasing him. Ben is seized by the government, and Gillian persuades Smith to leave the hospital with her. When government agents catch up with them, Smith makes the agents vanish, then is so shocked by Gillian's terrified reaction that he enters a semblance of catatonia.

Sex-Pol stood for the German Society of Proletarian Sexual Politics. Reich offered a mixture of [...] "psychoanalytic counseling, Marxist advice and contraceptives," [...] Danto writes, and argued for a sexual permissiveness, including for young people and the unmarried, that unsettled other psychoanalysts and the political left.
