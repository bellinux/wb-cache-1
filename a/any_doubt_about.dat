In December 2008, the Tanzania Civil Aviation Authority (TCAA) withdrew Air Tanzania's Air Operator Certificate because the airline {{had failed to}} meet the standards of the International Civil Aviation Organization. Two weeks later, the International Air Transport Association banned the air carrier from all aviation transactions and informed all travel agencies and other aviation companies to stop all transactions with Air Tanzania until further notice.

Hoehling Jr. of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, to forestall any questions about the authority of a state official to administer a federal oath. This second oath taking remained a secret until it was revealed by Harry M. Daugherty in 1932, and confirmed by Hoehling. [...] When Hoehling confirmed Daugherty's story, he indicated that Daugherty, then serving as United States Attorney General, asked him to administer the oath without fanfare at the Willard Hotel. [...] According to Hoehling, he did not question Daugherty's reason for requesting a second oath taking, but assumed it was to resolve <b>any</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> whether the first swearing in was valid.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the absence}} of such assurances from {{religious}} authority, Weber argued that Protestants began to look for other [...] "signs" [...] that they were saved. Calvin and his followers taught a doctrine of double predestination, in which from the beginning God chose some people for salvation and others for damnation. The inability to influence one's own salvation presented a very difficult problem for Calvin's followers. It became an absolute duty to believe that one was chosen for salvation, and to dispel <b>any</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> that: lack of self-confidence was evidence of insufficient faith and a sign of damnation.

In October 1976, a group of members of the Concerned Jewish Youth organization took over the headquarters of the National Council of Churches building, as a protest against the refusal of the organization to oust Trifa.

2500|$|After {{crossing}} the Thai frontier at Melamao Pass, the Burmese marched towards Phitsanulok, capturing Phichai and Sukhothai on the way. In his interrogation of two Phichai officials, Azaewunky referred to Chao Phraya Surasih {{who was the}} Governor of Phitsanulok as [...] "Phraya Sua" [...] or [...] "The Tiger", thus testifying to his boldness and decisiveness. The Burmese then besieged Phitsanulok which was defended by the brother generals, Chao Phraya Chakri and Chao Phya Surasih, and {{as the result of}} the stubborn resistance on the part of Thai soldiers, they were checked outside the city ramparts for about 4 months. Hearing about Chao Phraya Chakri's successful assaults which drove back the Burmese to their well fortified camp, Azaewunky arranged a meeting with him, in the course of which he extolled his generalship and advised him to take good care on himself. He prophesied that General Chakri would certainly become king. Was he really honest in his prediction? No definite answer has been found for it. Anyhow he was at that time seventy two years of age, while his opponent was only thirty nine. <b>Any</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> Azaewunky's stratagem to sow discord between King Taksin and Chao Phraya Chakri should be dismissed, since they collaborated closely in subsequent military expeditions.|$|E
2500|$|The {{storm of}} {{controversy}} {{that was created}} by Velikovsky's works, especially Worlds in Collision, may have helped revive the Catastrophist movements {{in the last half}} of the 20th century; it is also held by some working in the field that progress has actually been retarded by the negative aspects of the so-called Velikovsky Affair. The assessment of Velikovsky's work by tree-ring expert Mike Baillie is instructive: [...] "But fundamentally, Velikovsky did not understand anything about comets … As if to comfort his readers, at one point he says that no planet at present has a course which poses a danger to this planet: '…only a few asteroids—mere rocks, a few kilometres in diameter—have orbits which cross the path of the earth.' … He did not know about the hazard posed by relatively small objects, and, just in case there is <b>any</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> his mistake, he repeats the notion by noting that a possibility exists of some future collision between planets, 'not a mere encounter between a planet and an asteroid'. This failure to recognize the power of comets and asteroids means that it is reasonable to go back to Velikovsky and delete all the physically impossible text about Venus and Mars passing close to the earth." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Gemara deduced {{from the}} words, [...] "About midnight I {{will go out}} into the midst of Egypt," [...] in [...] that even Moses did not know exactly when midnight fell. The Gemara {{reasoned}} that [...] could not say [...] "about midnight" [...] because God told Moses [...] "about midnight," [...] for God cannot have <b>any</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> when midnight falls. Thus the Gemara concluded that God told Moses [...] "at midnight," [...] and then Moses told Pharaoh [...] "about midnight" [...] because Moses was in doubt as to the exact moment of midnight.. Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 1997[...] See also Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael, Tractate Pisha, chapter 13. Reprinted in, e.g., Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael. Translated by Jacob Z. Lauterbach, volume 1, page 67. But Rav Zeira argued that Moses certainly knew the exact time of midnight, but said [...] "about midnight" [...] because he thought that Pharaoh's astrologers might make a mistake as to the exact moment of midnight and then accuse Moses of being a liar. And Rav Ashi argued that in [...] Moses spoke at midnight of the night of the thirteenth of Nisan as it became the fourteenth of Nisan, and thus Moses said: [...] "God said: ‘Tomorrow at the hour like the midnight of tonight, I will {{go out into the}} midst of Egypt.'".|$|E

2500|$|In March 2013, CBS News {{broadcast}} a 60 Minutes {{critique of the}} doctrinal assessment, and interview of Farrell and Sartain. Sartain described his role as follows: [...] "In {{the context of the}} Church, we're always going to have the concern about being faithful to Christ. And all I can say to you [...] is I don't have <b>any</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> the reason why the Holy Father has asked me to do this, which is his genuine love and concern for religious women." [...] On the other hand, Farrell noted that there is disagreement over the meaning of vows of obedience for nuns: [...] "Well I think there is one of the areas of misunderstanding and difference. Our first obedience is to God. What we obey is God and God's call to us as expressed in so many different sources, it's not just the teaching authority of the Church, although that is certainly a legitimate part of it." [...] "We have never wanted the men to tell us what to do." [...] She added that the motivation of the inquisition by men in the Vatican appeared to be motivated by their fears rather than the love and concern Sartain cited. Farrell commented: [...] "I don't know, but it feels to me like fear. What would happen if women really were given a place of equality in the Church?" [...] The Holy See says [...] "good works aren't the issue, its annual meetings" [...] are the issue. [...] "It doesn't make sense," [...] Sartain reasoned about the speakers selected by the LCWR, [...] "that a conference of Women Religious would want to give a platform to somebody who would espouse ideas antithetical to what the Church teaches." ...|$|E

[...] Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode a 7.5 out of 10, citing it as another example of Futurama's [...] "smart takes" [...] on time travel. He felt that [...] "it showed that there's still a lot of thought going into plotting out these time trips", although he also stated that the episode did not have enough laughs. Merrill Bar of Film School Rejects praised the episode, describing it as [...] "very joke hits, every line was sweet, every emotion is true, every visual was eye popping, this episode is Futurama at its finest. If there is any complaint, it's that it took this long for the show to regain this level of quality." [...] He concluded that [...] "his combined with last week's episode has restored my full confidence in the production team". Sean Gandert of Paste rated the episode a 9.4 out of 10, writing: [...] "'Late' was definitely the best episode of the season so far, and ranks with the best the show's ever done.
