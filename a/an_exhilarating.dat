25|$|Harris {{was soon}} moving again, sailing to Portugal to {{participate}} in the opening actions of the British involvement in the Peninsular War. Harris was at the very first action, a skirmish at the town of Óbidos, where he saw Lieutenant Ralph Bunbury fall, the first British casualty of the war. On 17 August 1808 he was in the hotly contested skirmish line at Battle of Rolica, and saw serious opposition for the first time, reporting it as <b>an</b> <b>exhilarating</b> and terrifying experience. Many of his companions were killed at this action and the ensuing Battle of Vimeiro, but Harris remained unhurt, continuing the march to Salamanca before becoming trapped in northern Spain with the rest of Sir John Moore's army. The Light Brigade of Robert Craufurd, which included the 2nd/95th, did not march {{with the rest of the}} army to Corunna but marched to Vigo. The sights and horrors of the march remained with him for decades to come, and he was lucky to escape, claiming to be the very last man collected from the beaches at Vigo, and embarking for England in a severely weakened state.|$|E
500|$|Joel Taylor from Amusement Business {{praised the}} ride saying, [...] "In all, it's <b>an</b> <b>exhilarating</b> 2 1/2 minutes {{from start to}} finish." [...] He was also {{impressed}} with the ride's smoothness and overall excitement, stating that the ride is, [...] "smooth and comfortable while delivering twisting, stomach-churning excitement." ...|$|E
500|$|Michael Phillips of the Los Angeles Times {{called the}} show [...] "wholly revised and gleefully self-aware... a few tons {{short of a}} mega-musical – no fake {{helicopters}} here, no power ballads saccharine enough to stop Communism in its tracks." [...] The Hollywood Reporter thought the revival was, [...] "while not perfect, <b>an</b> <b>exhilarating</b> accomplishment". [...] Variety called it [...] "a bold theatrical operation, an artistic success".|$|E

500|$|During {{his time}} in America, Szigeti took to writing; his memoirs, With Strings Attached: Reminiscences and Reflections were {{published}} in 1947. The New York Times reviewed it favorably: although in their description the book was [...] "constructed along utterly anarchistic lines, with each episode and anecdote left pretty much on its own", they asserted that [...] "It also has the flavor of life in it, and it is marked by <b>an</b> <b>exhilarating</b> revolt against the custom of arranging catastrophes and triumphs under neat chapter headings".|$|E
500|$|Bradman {{then decided}} to bring Miller back in place of Toshack. Two runs later, Compton was bowled {{attempting}} a leg sweep against Miller, his leg stump knocked {{out of the ground}} as he moved across his wickets. Five English wickets had fallen with only 48 runs on the board after 100 minutes of play; three batsmen had been dismissed in just ten minutes. O'Reilly said [...] "There was nothing whatsoever to suggest that the pitch had been instrumental in the English debacle. It was purely and simply <b>an</b> <b>exhilarating</b> display of splendid bowling fit to be classed with any match-winning bowling performance in the story of Test cricket." ...|$|E
500|$|Desson Thomson of The Washington Post {{praised the}} art {{direction}} and set design. [...] "Willis and Pitts's performances, Gilliam's atmospherics and <b>an</b> <b>exhilarating</b> momentum easily outweigh such trifling {{flaws in the}} script", Thomson reasoned. Peter Travers from Rolling Stone magazine cited the film's success on Gilliam's direction and Willis' performance. Internet reviewer James Berardinelli believed the filmmakers took an intelligent and creative motive for the time travel subplot. Rather than being sent to change the past, James Cole is instead observing it {{to make a better}} future. Richard Corliss of Time magazine felt the film's time travel aspect and apocalyptic depiction of a bleaker future were clichés. [...] "In its frantic mix of chaos, carnage and zoo animals, 12 Monkeys is Jumanji for adults", Corliss wrote.|$|E

500|$|The Ramones' debut LP {{was greeted}} by rock critics with glowing reviews. The Village Voices Robert Christgau wrote, [...] "I love this record—love it—even though I know these boys flirt with images of {{brutality}} (Nazi especially)... For me, it blows everything else off the radio". In Rolling Stone, Paul Nelson described it as [...] "constructed almost entirely of rhythm tracks of <b>an</b> <b>exhilarating</b> intensity rock & roll has not experienced since its earliest days." [...] Characterizing the band as [...] "authentic American primitives whose work has to be heard to be understood", he declared, [...] "It is time popular music followed the other arts in honoring its primitives." [...] Newsdays Wayne Robbins simply anointed the Ramones as [...] "the best young rock 'n' roll band in the known universe." ...|$|E
500|$|Mr. Pound has shaken {{the dust}} of London from his feet with not too {{emphatic}} a gesture of disgust, but, at least, without gratitude to this country.... has been <b>an</b> <b>exhilarating</b> influence for culture in England; he has left his mark upon {{more than one of}} the arts, upon literature, music, poetry and sculpture, and quite a number of men and movements owe their initiation to his self-sacrificing stimulus... With all this, however, Mr. Pound, like so many others who have striven for advancement of intelligence and culture in England, has made more enemies than friends... Much of the Press has been deliberately closed by cabal to him; his books have for some time been ignored or written down; and he himself has been compelled to live on much less than would support a navvy. His fate, as I have said, is not unusual... Taken by and large, England hates men of culture until they are dead.|$|E
500|$|In 1989, Rolling Stone {{magazine}} ranked [...] "Instant Karma!" [...] the 79th best single of {{the previous}} 25 years. In NME Originals: Beatles – The Solo Years 1970–1980, David Stubbs lists the song second among Lennon's [...] "ten solo gems" [...] (behind [...] "Cold Turkey"), with the comment: [...] "'Instant Karma!' epitomises the Lennon paradox, melding hippie idealism and rock'n'roll primal energy in <b>an</b> <b>exhilarating</b> mix." [...] Matt Melis of Consequence of Sound placed it third on his 2009 list of [...] "Top Ten Songs by Ex-Beatles". According to the website Acclaimed Music, [...] "Instant Karma!" [...] has also appeared in the following critics' best-songs lists and books, among others: Dave Marsh's The 1001 Greatest Singles Ever Made (1989; at number 638), 1000 Songs that Rock Your World by Dave Thompson (2011; number 56), the NMEs [...] "The 100 Best Songs of the 1970s" [...] (2012; number 77), and Q magazine's [...] "The 1001 Best Songs Ever" [...] (2003; number 193).

500|$|The {{process of}} hunting the Monster was praised. Ingenito {{thought that the}} hunting process was as tense as the actual {{confrontation}} and combat between the Hunters and the Monster. The four classes was also applauded by him, as he considered that the distant class abilities have successfully made players co-operate {{with each other in}} order to achieve success, as well as making the decision of choosing the correct character important and tactical. This was also contradicted by Strom, who felt that the hunter gameplay up until finding the monster was [...] "hollow", and generally just consisted of going around in circles. Marchiafava thought that Evolve had successfully delivered a compelling experience while playing with other players. He was also surprised by the game's balance between the Monster and the Hunters. Meikleham thought that playing the game with other players can be <b>an</b> <b>exhilarating</b> experience, but only when players communicate with each other using microphones. Rowan thought that Evolve could only deliver an enjoyable experience when all players play cooperatively, and the overall experience would crumble if one of these players failed to do so. Lathi liked Evolves resources management, singling out the need for the Hunters to manage and conserve the energy for their jetpacks.|$|E
500|$|The San Jose Mercury News and the Connecticut Post both {{gave the}} show a mixed review, {{with the former}} saying it was [...] "decidedly subpar" [...] and latter saying [...] "the concert itself wasn't as {{captivating}} as past visits to the state." [...] The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and The Philadelphia Inquirer were unreserved in their praise, with the former saying Springsteen [...] "deliver a show that proves boomer-oriented rock 'n' roll can still tear it up" [...] and the latter saying Springsteen adapted to circumstances [...] "with an altered game plan that wisely plays to his strengths". [...] The Greensboro, North Carolina News & Record said that [...] "Springsteen and the E Street Band were received like conquering heroes during <b>an</b> <b>exhilarating</b> three-hour show that repeatedly drove the adoring, near-sellout crowd into fist-thrusting, sing-along frenzies." [...] The Globe and Mail said of the tour's sole Canadian show, [...] "an evening with Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band still ranks as the epitome of the rock concert experience." [...] Rolling Stone said of the first leg's concluding New Jersey shows, [...] "Springsteen tours don’t usually hit highs like this until the end, but the band has essentially {{been on the road}} since September of 2007." ...|$|E

5000|$|Halliwell's Film and Video Guide {{describes}} it as [...] "sentimental non-realism" [...] and quotes a Monthly Film Bulletin review (possibly contemporary with its British release), which claims that [...] "the sententious script sounds {{as if it has}} been written by a zealous Sunday school teacher after <b>a</b> particularly <b>exhilarating</b> boycott of South African oranges".|$|R

2500|$|The British Museum in London has the Lion Hunt of Ashurbanipal, <b>an</b> <b>exhilarating</b> set of Assyrian palace reliefs {{from the}} North Palace of Ashurbanipal, also {{excavated}} at Nineveh, depicting the king hunting and killing Mesopotamian lions. In Assyria, the lion hunt {{was seen as}} a royal sport; the depictions were seen {{as a symbol of the}} king’s ability to guard the nation. [...] The “Garden Party” relief shows the king and his queen having a banquet celebrating the Assyrian triumph over Tuemman in the campaign against Elam. [...] The fine carvings serve as testimony to Ashurbanipal’s high regard for art, but also communicate an important message meant to be passed down for posterity.|$|E
2500|$|Cruyff {{was noted}} {{by many as}} one of the few truly great players who made the {{transition}} to being a great coach/manager as well. His greatness was summed up by the former Dutch international Johan Neeskens, [...] "If you look at the greatest players in history, most of them couldn’t coach. If you look at the greatest coaches in history, most of them were not great players. Johan Cruyff did both – and in such <b>an</b> <b>exhilarating</b> style." [...] Cruyff is undisputedly regarded {{as one of the}} greatest and most influential managers in history of the game, despite his top-level coaching career only lasted 11 years with two clubs. In July 2011, website Football Pantheon included him on its list of the top 50 greatest managers of all time. However, Cruyff's coaching legacy was about not just trophies and records but also the style and identity.|$|E

The USA Today described it as <b>an</b> <b>exhilarating</b> display of China's thousands of years of traditions of art and culture, and the Art Daily stated it was a celebration of China's ancient history, along with sumptuous costumes from different imperial dynasties. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times commented that [...] "the scope, precision and beauty of the production was, you will agree, astonishing." [...] The Spanish media were impressed by the opening ceremony, with Antena 3 describing the ceremony as [...] "an astonishing effort," [...] while Cuatro called it [...] "awesome and impressive."
