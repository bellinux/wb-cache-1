2500|$|Isabel Fitton, a viola pupil of Elgar. Elgar explained, [...] "It may {{be noticed}} that the opening bar, a phrase made use of {{throughout}} the variation, is <b>an</b> 'exercise' <b>for</b> crossing the strings – <b>a</b> difficulty <b>for</b> beginners; on this is built <b>a</b> pensive <b>and,</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> romantic movement." ...|$|R

A Belgian may not have won but there were seven Belgians in the first ten.|$|R
50|$|Although neither {{understand}} it, {{there is}} a strange affinity between this old man - who has lost his daughter - and the young boy who never knew his mother.

2500|$|The {{commander}} of the 50th Tennessee emerged from the woods ahead of his skirmishers, and his heart sank. [...] To his right, a line of blue stretched {{as far as he}} could see. [...] To the left, he could hear Logan's two reserve regiments moving past his flank. [...] General Gregg had made a grave miscalculation. [...] The federal infantry brigade he had been ordered to rout from the field had somehow turned into an entire federal division. [...] The Confederate force withdrew across the creek with haste, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> was too stunned to do anything but stand in formation waiting for orders.|$|R
5|$|At first, {{the balance}} of power {{appeared}} to move slightly in Matilda's favour. Robert of Gloucester besieged Stephen in 1143 at Wilton Castle, <b>an</b> assembly point <b>for</b> royal forces in Herefordshire. Stephen attempted to break out and escape, resulting in the Battle of Wilton. Once again, the Angevin cavalry proved too strong, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> it appeared that Stephen might be captured <b>for</b> <b>a</b> second time, before finally managing to escape. Later in the year Geoffrey de Mandeville, the Earl of Essex, rose up in rebellion against Stephen in East Anglia. Geoffrey based himself from the Isle of Ely and began a military campaign against Cambridge, with the intention of progressing south towards London. Ranulf of Chester revolted once again in the summer of 1144.|$|R
60|$|Norgate's {{expression}} was almost one of stupefaction. He {{looked at the}} slim {{young man who had}} entered his sitting-room a little diffidently <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>he</b> was speechless.|$|E

Police reported she died at the scene. She was 29 years old. The stolen vehicle was later abandoned in southwest Moscow. The carjacker has not been found. She left one child behind. Loginova had previously been successful in thwarting attempts to steal her car by using martial arts against a car thief. She was buried in the Ulybyshevo cemetery in Vladimir.|$|R

25|$|The Battle of La Marfée {{took place}} during Thirty Years' War near Sedan, France, on 6 July 1641, between a Royal army of Louis XIII under Marshall Gaspard III de Coligny, and French malcontents led by Prince Louis de Bourbon, Count of Soissons, and Duke Frédéric Maurice de La Tour d'Auvergne, duc de Bouillon, who were {{supported}} by an Imperial-Spanish army under general Guillaume de Lamboy sent from the Spanish Netherlands by the Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand of Austria. The French malcontents and the Habsburg forces dealt a serious defeat to the French Royal Army, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> Cardinal Richelieu feared that the rebels, supported by the Spanish forces, would advance on Paris. Shortly after, however, Soissons fell dead, either murdered by an assassin or killed by himself accidentally, and the rebellion vanished.|$|R
50|$|Having {{wandered into}} the city, Inugami finds himself in an {{abandoned}} building which Fumiki, an aspiring poet, frequents. After listening to Fumiki's poetry for some time, Inugami befriends the aspiring poet and eventually learns to speak, much to Fumiki's surprise. Through their friendship, Inugami realizes that not all humans are bad. Unfortunately a pharmaceutical corporation soon learns of Inugami's existence. Realizing that Inugami's regenerating cells could lead to immortality, the corporation attempts and succeeds at acquiring Inugami's gene's. Soon, the company ends up creating terrifying monsters. Soon, Inugami ends up {{in a fight with}} one of these monsters <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> questions the goodness of humans, who have created these monsters. In that fleeting <b>moment</b> of doubt, <b>a</b> different Inugami, with the intent to kill humans, appears.|$|R
5|$|The {{war between}} the two sides in England reached a {{stalemate}} in the mid-1140s, while Geoffrey of Anjou consolidated his hold on power in Normandy. 1143 started precariously for Stephen when he was besieged by Robert of Gloucester at Wilton Castle, <b>an</b> assembly point <b>for</b> royal forces in Herefordshire. Stephen attempted to break out and escape, resulting in the battle of Wilton. Once again, the Angevin cavalry proved too strong, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> it appeared that Stephen might be captured <b>for</b> <b>a</b> second time. On this occasion, however, William Martel, Stephen's steward, made a fierce rear guard effort, allowing Stephen to escape from the battlefield. Stephen valued William's loyalty sufficiently to agree to exchange Sherborne Castle for his safe release—this {{was one of the few}} instances where Stephen was prepared to give up a castle to ransom one of his men.|$|R
60|$|Dick managed, by {{the aid of}} a {{knife and}} fork, to extract a towel from under a muslin dress without wetting the latter; <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>he</b> ventured to assume a tone of criticism.|$|E

5|$|The {{situation}} on the Muslim left wing which Yazid commanded was considerably more serious. Whilst the Muslim right wing enjoyed assistance from the mobile guard, the left wing did not and the numerical advantage the Byzantines enjoyed caused the Muslim positions to be overrun, with soldiers retreating towards base camps. Here the Byzantines had broken through the corps. The testudo formation that Gregory's army had adopted moved slowly but also had a good defense. Yazid used his cavalry regiment to counterattack but was repulsed. Despite stiff resistance, the warriors of Yazid on the left flank finally fell back to their camps <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> Vahan's plan appeared to be succeeding. The centre of the Muslim army was pinned down and its flanks had been pushed back. However, neither flank had broken, though their morale was severely damaged.|$|R
25|$|Once in the match, Sakuraba {{was able}} to sneak in a double leg {{takedown}} after Funaki committed heavily to a missed right cross. Funaki closed guard around Sakuraba before opening it up to spin <b>for</b> <b>a</b> kneebar, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> Funaki appeared to secure Sakuraba's leg, but he was thwarted {{by a combination of}} Sakuraba's submission acumen and their position against the ring ropes. Sakuraba then maneuvered to Funaki's back, only for the Pancrase founder to roll back into the guard position. Breaking away momentarily from the grappling contest, Sakuraba stood up and began to assault Funaki's legs with a series of kicks, which Funaki answered with an upkick of his own, cutting Sakuraba's eye. Kazushi then returned himself to the ground, where Funaki immediately attempted to sweep him, but Sakuraba blocked the attempt and secured a Kimura lock or double wristlock, eventually forcing Funaki to submit.|$|R
2500|$|In [...] (2003), Boromir {{appears in}} the {{theatrical}} version during a brief flashback as Pippin remembers his heroic self-sacrifice.

25|$|Colin had {{a health}} scare during {{the autumn of}} 1988 <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> it looked like EastEnders might have been about to do an AIDS storyline. The press speculated that Colin was showing early signs {{of the disease and}} the {{possibility}} was even briefly indicated to on-screen when Colin himself began to fear that his symptoms were AIDS related. In fact giving Colin AIDS was never the programme's intention — it was felt that the most simplistic and unhelpful message that the programme could give out would be to have its only homosexual character become HIV positive — particularly as it happened at a time when misconceptions and fear about AIDS were rife. Colin was eventually diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, although this fact was kept from him by his doctor {{for the remainder of the}} year and he lived out 1988 with the belief that he was in perfect health.|$|R
2500|$|Confederate Brig. Gen. Hamilton P. Bee, {{with two}} regiments in columns of four rode swiftly down the Pleasant Hill {{road toward the}} enemy lines. The Confederate forces were {{suddenly}} attacked at close range by Federals concealed behind a fence.
