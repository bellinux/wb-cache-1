5|$|The Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles {{was founded}} in 1977 by Rabbi Marvin Hier using large {{donations}} from philanthropists Samuel Belzberg and Joseph Tennenbaum. Hier's organisation paid Wiesenthal an honorarium {{for the right to}} use his name. The center helped with the campaign to remove the statute of limitations on Nazi crimes and continues the hunt for suspected Nazi war criminals, but today its primary activities include Holocaust remembrance, education, and fighting antisemitism. The center's Holocaust museum, the largest in the United States, opened in 1993. Moriah Films, the center's media division, has won two Academy Awards, including one for the documentary Genocide (1982). Wiesenthal was not <b>always</b> <b>happy</b> with the way the center was run. He thought the museum was not dignified enough and that he should have a larger say in the overall operations. He even wrote to the Board of Directors requesting Hier's removal, but in the end had to be content with being a figurehead.|$|E

5000|$|Greenwood is a multi-instrumentalist {{and plays}} {{instruments}} including guitar, piano, synthesisers, viola, glockenspiel, harmonica, recorder, organ, and banjo. He said in 2014: [...] "Im <b>always</b> <b>happiest</b> trying new instruments - and honestly enjoy playing, say, the glockenspiel with Radiohead {{as much as}} I do the guitar ... I enjoy struggling with instruments I cant really play." ...|$|R
25|$|The third book, which {{contains}} 290 verses, is by a much inferior hand. The writer calls himself Lygdamus {{and the love}} that he sings of Neaera. He has little poetical power, and his style is meagre and jejune. He has a good many reminiscences and imitations of Tibullus, Propertius and Ovid (iii. 5, 15-20, and Ovid, Ars. am. ii. 669 seq.; Tr. iv. 10, 6: and Am. xi. 14, 23 seq.); {{and they are not}} <b>always</b> <b>happy.</b> It is unknown when his poems were added to the genuine poems of Tibullus.|$|E

500|$|Dickinson {{wrote in}} a letter to Colonel John Nielson on January23, [...] "I have the {{pleasure}} to inform you that on Monday last with about 450 men chiefly our militia I attacked a foraging party near V. Nest Mills consisting of 500 men with 2 field pieces, which we routed after an engagement of 20 minutes and brought off 107 horses, 49 wagons, 115 cattle, 70 sheep, 40 barrels of flour - 106 bags and many other things, 49 prisoners." [...] General Washington, who was not <b>always</b> <b>happy</b> with the performance of the militias, wrote, [...] "Genl Dickinsons behaviour reflects the highest honour upon him, for tho' his Troops were all raw, he lead them thro' the River, middle deep, and gave the Enemy so severe a charge, that, altho' supported by three field pieces, they gave way and left their Convoy", and only reported the taking of nine prisoners.|$|E

Regression results show that Republicans are <b>always</b> <b>happier</b> than Democrats, but members of both parties tend to be happier during a Democratic presidential administration. We do not find compelling evidence that Americans are happier when their own political party is in power. ...|$|R

500|$|The episode {{originally}} {{aired in}} the United States on Comedy Central on July 14, 2011. According to Nielsen Media Research, it was watched by 814,000 viewers and acquired a 0.4 rating in the 18–49 demographic. The episode slightly dropped {{in terms of}} total viewership from the previous episode, [...] "Callie and Her Sister", which was watched by 980,000 viewers. [...] "Ride Me to Hell" [...] received a positive review from Ology's Josh Harrison, who commented that it [...] "successfully redeemed" [...] the character Grimes, who was his least-favorite character up until this episode. Harrison wrote, [...] "I'm thrilled to see Grimes shine in his starring role. Admittedly this episode was a bit light on isolated funny incidents ... but Randall's director-speak was a solid throughline, and I'm <b>always</b> <b>happy</b> to see more demon politics." [...] Harrison graded the episode 8.7 out of 10 and remarked that [...] "it was a cut above its predecessors this season, but still a bit shy {{of the very best}} UA [...] ".|$|E
500|$|The {{province}} of Alberta in Canada {{is named after}} her. Although the name [...] "Louise" [...] was originally planned, the Princess wished to honour her dead father, so {{the last of her}} given names was chosen. Lake Louise in Alberta is also named after her, as is Mount Alberta. Although her time in Canada was not <b>always</b> <b>happy,</b> she liked the Canadian people and retained close links with her Canadian regiments. Back at home, she gained a reputation for paying unscheduled visits to hospitals, especially during her later years. Her relationship with her family was generally close. Although at times she bickered with the Queen, and her sisters Helena and Beatrice, the relations did not remain strained for long. She retained a lifelong correspondence with her brother, Prince Arthur, and was one of King Edward VII's favourite sisters. Of all her siblings, she was closest to Prince Leopold, later Duke of Albany, and she was devastated by his death in 1884.|$|E
500|$|Potemkin's Black Sea Fleet was {{a massive}} {{undertaking}} for its time. By 1787, the British ambassador reported twenty-seven battleships. It put Russia on a naval footing with Spain, though far behind the British Navy. The period represented the peak of Russia's naval power relative to other European states. Potemkin also rewarded {{hundreds of thousands of}} settlers who moved into his territories. It is estimated that by 1782 the populations of Novorossiya and Azov had doubled during a period of [...] "exceptionally rapid" [...] development. Immigrants included Russians, foreigners, British convicts diverted from Australia, Cossacks and controversially Jews. Though the immigrants were not <b>always</b> <b>happy</b> in their new surroundings, on at least one occasion Potemkin intervened directly to ensure families received the cattle to which they were entitled. Outside of Novorossiya he drew up the defensive Azov-Mozdok line, constructing forts at Georgievsk, Stavropol and elsewhere and ensured that the whole of the line was settled.|$|E

500|$|Frusciante {{developed}} serious drug habits while touring {{with the}} band during the previous four years. He {{said that when he}} [...] "found out that Flea was stoned out of his mind at every show, that inspired me to be a pothead". Not only was Frusciante smoking large amounts of marijuana, but he began to use heroin and {{was on the verge of}} full-scale addiction. Upon returning to California in the summer of 1992, Frusciante entered a deep depression, feeling that his life was over and that he could no longer write music or play guitar. For a long time, he focused on painting, producing 4-track recordings he had made while working on Blood Sugar Sex Magik, and writing short stories and screenplays. To cope with his worsening depression, Frusciante increased his heroin use and spiraled into a life-threatening dependency. His use of heroin to medicate his depression was a clear decision: [...] "I was very sad, and I was <b>always</b> <b>happy</b> when I was on drugs; therefore, I should be on drugs all the time. I was never guilty—I was always really proud to be an addict." [...] Frusciante openly admitted to being a [...] "junkie", believing that drugs were the only way of [...] "making sure you stay in touch with beauty instead of letting the ugliness of the world corrupt your soul." ...|$|E
500|$|Over {{the course}} of the show (roughly 8 years), Monk overcomes many of his phobias and some aspects of his OCD. Though he hasn't been cured of many of them, if any at all, {{he has been able to}} put them in the back of his mind when {{involved}} in case work. His most notable breakthrough is shown in the season 8 episode [...] "Mr. Monk Goes to Group Therapy", when Adrian is locked in a car trunk with his fellow OCD patient and personal rival, Harold Krenshaw. During the terrifying trip, both men overcome their longstanding case of claustrophobia (fear of small spaces), as well as their own differences, resulting in them becoming friends. Possibly due to this, as well as the many cases Monk has solved over the years, he is reinstated as detective first class by Stottlemeyer in the season 8 episode [...] "Mr. Monk and the Badge". Though he is very excited about his reinstatement initially, Monk realizes that becoming a detective again didn't mean that he would be happier. In a session with Dr. Bell, Monk realizes he was <b>always</b> <b>happy</b> as a private detective and consultant to the SFPD as his own boss. After overcoming his fear of heights and singlehandedly capturing a killer window-washer, Monk turns in his badge. In the series finale, he learns that his late wife, Trudy, had given birth to a daughter before they had met. The knowledge and events of the episode lead to positive changes in his personality.|$|E
500|$|By mid-2000s, the Ballymun towers were in {{the process}} of being torn down, and the Ballymun area was the target of a €1.8billion {{regeneration}} scheme intended to create a self-sustaining community of 30,000 people that would be more successful than the original 1960s plan. [...] Despite their failure as housing, the towers had left a long cultural legacy, of which [...] "Running to Stand Still" [...] was the first and perhaps best-known exemplar; the link between the towers and the song was mentioned in some tourist books about Dublin. [...] Former towers residents were not <b>always</b> <b>happy</b> with the song. [...] Lynn Connolly, whose 2006 memoir The Mun: Growing Up in Ballymun detailed her raising there in the 1970s and 1980s, readily acknowledged the problems there and also wanted to get out at the time. [...] But she later came to realize that there had been much that was good at the towers – in terms of a collective wit among residents and a helping sense of community – which had been ignored by the media. [...] She thus wrote, [...] "regardless of what U2 say in their song, 'Running to Stand Still', there was certainly more than one way out." [...] In a newspaper interview, Connolly suggested that the song might have had a deleterious effect: [...] "It doesn't take a lot of imagination to picture an unemployed person, living alone in a flat in Ballymun, listening to that song and agreeing with what their hero was saying." [...] She further noted that some websites erroneously state that Bono grew up in Ballymun itself, and said, [...] "Perhaps it gave him a sort of street-cred to associate himself with the estate he could see from his bedroom window in nice, safe, respectable Cedarwood Road in Glasnevin." ...|$|E

He conducted George White's Scandals in 1919, Funny Face in 1927 and Treasure Girl in 1929.

2500|$|Arranged royal {{marriages in}} the Middle Ages were not <b>always</b> <b>happy,</b> but {{available}} {{evidence indicates that}} Eleanor and Edward were devoted to each other.

[...] The couple were rarely apart; she accompanied him on military campaigns in Wales, famously giving birth to their son Edward on 25 April 1284 at Caernarfon Castle, either in a temporary dwelling erected for her amid the construction works, or in the partially constructed Eagle Tower.|$|E

[...] The statement also said that [...] "I voted to give the president the authority to use force in Iraq; that doesn't mean I'm <b>always</b> <b>happy</b> with what I see, but I can think of nothing worse for our troops or our prospects for success than having 435 members of Congress second-guessing our commanders." ...|$|E

40|$|Using {{happiness}} as a well-being {{measure and}} comparative {{data from the}} European social survey we focus in this paper on the link between happiness and childbearing across European countries. The analysis motivates from the recent lows in fertility in many European countries and that economic wellbeing measures are problematic when considering childbearing. We find significant country differences, though the direct association between happiness and childbearing is modest. However, partnership status {{plays an important role}} for both men and women. Working fathers are <b>always</b> <b>happier,</b> whereas working mothers are not, though mothers' happiness tends to increase with household income...|$|R

2500|$|Although {{he managed}} to produce work {{throughout}} his life, his mental health was fragile and failing. His character was described as [...] "innocent as a child", imbued with a mystic romanticism, and by common consent, he had no vices, but always preserved a gentility of deportment, was inoffensive, and always mild, <b>always</b> <b>happy.</b> He was a regular attendant at the fashionable Episcopal Grace church on Broadway. His oddities, as his friend Fitz-Greene Halleck stated, were all amiable. Nevertheless, after the breakdown of his marriage his behavior became wilder and could give rise to alarm, particularly when he became fixated on and followed young women around the city. [...] "His whole life {{was in fact a}} restless seeking for other half", according to biographer Lydia Maria Child.|$|E
