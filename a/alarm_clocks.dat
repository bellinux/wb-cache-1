5|$|At bedtime on Christmas Eve, {{the family}} makes last-minute {{preparations}} at home, Marge tells everyone {{that no one}} can open presents until 7 AM and confiscates all of the <b>alarm</b> <b>clocks.</b> However, Bart drinks 12 glasses of water to wake up early and secretly unwraps his gifts, one of which is a remote-controlled fire truck. Bart plays with it until it sprays water on an overloaded electrical socket, causing a fire that engulfs and melts the plastic Christmas tree and all of the presents beneath it. Bart hides the evidence outside beneath the snow in the front yard.|$|E

Although Wake does not remember writing this book, its storyline {{seems to be}} becoming real around him. These readable manuscript pages are scattered around the game world, out of chronological order; they often describe scenes {{that have yet to}} occur and act as warning and instructions for proceeding through upcoming challenges. Other optional collectibles include coffee thermoses scattered around the game world (100 in all), as well as discovering television sets which show different episodes of the fictional Night Springs series, radios airing talk and music from Bright Falls' local radio station, and textual signs around the town. The radio shows and signs provide {{a deeper understanding of the}} town's history and culture.

So the phone wakes up the <b>alarm</b> <b>clock,</b> so it can wake Bosko up. The <b>alarm</b> <b>clock</b> also has trouble waking up Bosko.

25|$|By {{the time}} {{those who have}} DSPD seek medical help, they usually have tried many times to change their {{sleeping}} schedule. Failed tactics to sleep at earlier times may include maintaining proper sleep hygiene, relaxation techniques, early bedtimes, hypnosis, alcohol, sleeping pills, dull reading, and home remedies. DSPD patients who have tried using sedatives at night often report that the medication makes them feel tired or relaxed, but that it fails to induce sleep. They often have asked family members to help wake them in the morning, or they have used multiple <b>alarm</b> <b>clocks.</b> As the disorder occurs in childhood and is most common in adolescence, it is often the patient's parents who initiate seeking help, after great difficulty waking their child in time for school.|$|E
25|$|In Greece, a water {{clock was}} known as a clepsydra (water thief). The Greeks {{considerably}} advanced the water clock by tackling the problem of the diminishing flow. They introduced several types of the inflow clepsydra, one of which included the earliest feedback control system. Ctesibius invented an indicator system typical for later clocks such as the dial and pointer. The Roman engineer Vitruvius described early <b>alarm</b> <b>clocks,</b> working with gongs or trumpets. A commonly used water clock was the simple outflow clepsydra. This small earthenware vessel had a hole in its side near the base. In both Greek and Roman times, this type of clepsydra was used in courts for allocating periods of time to speakers. In important cases, when a person's life was at stake for example, it was filled. But, for more minor cases, it was only partially filled. If proceedings were interrupted for any reason, such as to examine documents, the hole in the clepsydra was stopped with wax until the speaker was able to resume his pleading.|$|E

The merchandise was highly successful, generating an estimated US$750 million in revenue {{during the first year}} of sales. As commented by AllMusic reviewer Jason Ankeny, [...] "an LP proved inevitable" [...] when, after the series premiere, [...] "the characters' licensed images were everywhere from T-shirts to action figures". In 1990, David Geffen, founder of the record label Geffen Records, decided to record an album featuring characters from The Simpsons. His idea was approved by Fox and The Simpsons creator Matt Groening, and the show's writers were assigned to write original, humorous lyrics for the cast members to perform. The finished result became the hip-hop blues album The Simpsons Sing the Blues, released in December 1990. It peaked at number three on the US Billboard 200 and was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America in February 1991.|$|E

500|$|Krusty is {{a multimillionaire}} who amassed his fortune mostly by {{licensing}} {{his name and}} image {{to a variety of}} substandard products and services, from Krusty <b>alarm</b> <b>clocks</b> to Krusty crowd control barriers. Many of these products are potentially dangerous, such as Krusty's brand of cereal, Krusty-O's, which in one episode boasted a jagged metal Krusty-O in each box. One of many lawsuits regarding these products was launched by Bart, who ate a jagged metal Krusty-O and had to have his appendix removed. The [...] "Krusty Korporation", the company responsible for Krusty's licensing, has also launched a series of disastrous promotions and business ventures, such as sponsoring the 1984 Summer Olympics with a rigged promotion that backfired when the Soviet Union boycotted the games, causing Krusty to lose $44 million. In the TV series and comic books Krusty is also the mascot and owner of the restaurant Krusty Burger. He has been shut down by the health board many times for everything from overworking employees to stapling together half-eaten burgers to make new ones, as well as using beef infected with Mad Cow Disease to save money. Krusty wastes money almost as fast as he earns it: lighting his cigarettes with hundred-dollar bills, eating condor-egg omelettes, spending huge sums on pornographic magazines and call girls, and losing a fortune gambling on everything from horse races to operas and betting against the Harlem Globetrotters.|$|E
