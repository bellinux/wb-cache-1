5|$|The second 28cm shell struck {{near the}} <b>aircraft</b> <b>hangar</b> {{and started a}} major fire. As the fire spread, it detonated {{explosives}} carried for the infantry, hindering firefighting efforts. The explosion {{set fire to the}} two Arado seaplanes on board: one on the catapult and the other in one of the hangars. The explosion also probably punched a hole in the armored deck over turbine room 1. Turbine 1 and generator room 3 stopped for lack of steam and only the outboard shafts from turbine room 2/3 were operational.|$|E
5|$|Three {{weeks of}} filming were {{spent in the}} Hotel Earle, a set created by art {{director}} Dennis Gassner. The film's climax required a huge spreading fire in the hotel's hallway, which the Coens originally planned to add digitally in post-production. When they decided to use real flames, however, the crew built a large alternate set in an abandoned <b>aircraft</b> <b>hangar</b> at Long Beach. A series of gas jets were installed behind the hallway, and the wallpaper was perforated for easy penetration. As Goodman ran through the hallway, a man on an overhead catwalk opened each jet, giving {{the impression of a}} fire racing ahead of Charlie. Each take required a rebuild of the apparatus, and a second hallway (sans fire) stood ready nearby for filming pick-up shots between takes. The final scene was shot near Zuma Beach, as was the image of a wave crashing against a rock.|$|E

25|$|A large new 60,378 sq ft VC10 {{flight shed}} hangar {{was ready to}} house the {{prototype}} VC10 airliner by 1962 and a second even larger (98,989 sq ft) flight shed was added alongside this by 1964. The latter was probably the largest <b>aircraft</b> <b>hangar</b> in Europe {{at the time and}} became known locally as 'The Cathedral' hangar while the smaller shed was called 'The Abbey'. The huge factory at Brooklands went on to design and build the BAC TSR.2, One-Eleven and major assemblies for Concorde. The Labour government's cancellation of TSR-2 in 1965 and the disappointing lack of significant orders for VC10s and Concorde saw the factory contract from the early 1970s. It became part of the newly formed British Aerospace in 1977 but closure was announced on 29 July 1986, finally closing on Christmas Day 1989. BAe's successor, BAE Systems, still retain a logistics centre at Brooklands today.|$|E
25|$|The Ben-my-Chree {{was fitted}} with a large <b>aircraft</b> <b>hangar</b> aft and a smaller one forward, with a flying-off {{platform}} also fitted to the forward end of the ship. Cranes were fitted for hoisting the seaplanes back on board, and a workshop for the repair and servicing of the aircraft was fitted in the deck below the main hangar. Commissioned on 3 March 1915, her first base was Harwich, where she arrived on 28 April. HMS Ben-my-Chree was fitted with four 12-pounder and four anti-aircraft guns and carried four Short Type 184 seaplanes. When The Ben was fitted up as a carrier, {{it was assumed that}} the Short 184s could get airborne using the tilted forward trackway. In practice their weight was against them, so that they then had to be lowered into the sea, which meant that the ship would have to be almost stationary – a serious problem whilst in action.|$|E
25|$|Much of {{the serial}} was filmed on {{location}} in Aldbourne, Wiltshire. The location shoot was awarded two weeks' filming, {{more than double the}} usual amount at the time, leading {{to a lot of the}} finished story being set outside, rather than in studio. Membury airfield in Berkshire and Bridge Farm, Ramsbury, were also used briefly as locations. Filming began on 19 April 1971 and saw pleasant, sunny weather for the first week, leading to sudden overnight snow in the second week - causing filming to be delayed. Some episode one scenes were filmed at night - a rarity for the show, although some of these scenes were filmed during daylight with a dark filter put over the camera lens. Other dark indoor scenes were filmed in a disused <b>aircraft</b> <b>hangar</b> at Bridge Farm, Ramsbury. Filming for the serial caused great excitement in Aldbourne, with a lot of the village residents appearing as extras, as well as the Headington Quarry Morris dancers performing a routine in episode four.|$|E

25|$|The Air Ambulance Service of NSW was {{established}} in 1967 with a single Beechcraft Queen Air. More Queen Airs were gradually added so that by 1978 four were operational; these aircraft were {{owned and operated by}} East-West Airlines on behalf of the Service. One aircraft was destroyed by fire at Dubbo in 1982 and a fifth Queen Air was added to replace it. In 1985 a fleet modernisation programme began when the first two of four Beechcraft B200C Super King Airs were purchased to replace the Queen Airs. In 2003 one of the B200Cs was written off following an accident at Coffs Harbour Airport. The aircraft was involved in a CFIT accident; briefly impacting the sea during an instrument approach before making an emergency landing on two remaining wheels. By that time a second re-equipment programme was underway; the remaining three aircraft were replaced that year and in 2004 with four modified B200 King Airs. The latest re-equipment programme in 2012 saw the fixed wing fleet upgraded to seven aircraft comprising both Beechcraft B200 and B350 King Air aircraft. The Air Ambulance base facility is located at Sydney Airport and consists of an <b>aircraft</b> <b>hangar</b> with a light maintenance facility, road ambulance bay, patient care facilities, administration and an area for aircraft parking.|$|E
25|$|Profile sought {{no input}} or consent from Thorpe before doing this, and this aggravated the already troubled {{relationship}} between Thorpe and Profile Records and indirectly spurred legal disagreements surrounding {{the ownership of}} the Robot Wars concept. The legal proceedings surrounding these would last until 6 February 2002. Mentorn used Thorpe as a Consultant on the series, however, and the initial series of Robot Wars in the UK was broadcast over six weeks in February and March 1998. It was an immediate hit, with more than 2 million viewers, and a further 18 episodes were commissioned by the BBC that year. 155 episodes were produced in total, and the show was seen in 26 countries. Two series were produced in the US for the TNN (now Spike) network, and a version was also shown on Nickelodeon. Series were also produced in many European countries. Although the series had various directors and producers, all were produced in the UK by Mentorn, and executive produced by Tom Gutteridge and Steve Carsey. The initial series were staged in various film studios around London but the stage and pit area became too large to fit {{into any of the}} conventional studios, so filming was later moved to an <b>aircraft</b> <b>hangar</b> at RAF Newton.|$|E
500|$|In total, nine battlecruisers {{survived the}} Washington Naval Treaty, {{although}} HMS Tiger {{later became a}} victim of the London Naval Conference of 1930 and was scrapped. Because their high speed made them valuable surface units in spite of their weaknesses, most of these ships were significantly updated before World War II. [...] and [...] were modernized significantly in the 1920s and 1930s. Between 1934 and 1936, Repulse was partially modernized and had her bridge modified, an <b>aircraft</b> <b>hangar,</b> catapult and new gunnery equipment added and her anti-aircraft armament increased. Renown underwent a more thorough reconstruction between 1937 and 1939. Her deck armour was increased, new turbines and boilers were fitted, an <b>aircraft</b> <b>hangar</b> and catapult added and she was completely rearmed aside from the main guns which had their elevation increased to +30 degrees. The bridge structure was also removed and a large bridge similar to that used in the [...] battleships installed in its place. While conversions of this kind generally added weight to the vessel, Renowns tonnage actually decreased due to a substantially lighter power plant. Similar thorough rebuildings planned for Repulse and Hood were cancelled due to the advent of World War II.|$|E
