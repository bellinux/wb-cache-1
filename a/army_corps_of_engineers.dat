5|$|In February 2000, the Turnpike Authority {{gave in to}} {{the orders}} from the U.S. <b>Army</b> <b>Corps</b> <b>of</b> <b>Engineers</b> to have Route 92 undergo an {{environmental}} impact study, which could go up to two years, to help see if they should award the contract for construction. Opponents of the Route 92 project hailed this decision for {{the thought that the}} environmental impact statement (EIS) would back up their beliefs. Four months later, the <b>Army</b> <b>Corps</b> <b>of</b> <b>Engineers</b> held a meeting to decide what to take into account for the impact statement and held opinions from both the supporters and opponents of the freeway. Around this time, locals sent an editorial to News 12 New Jersey to say that Middlesex County Route 522, already a four-lane freeway, should become the primary freeway across the portion of Middlesex County. However, the Turnpike Authority replied citing that Route 522 would be inadequate to handle the amount of traffic by 2015 that Route 92 was to handle. In December 2003, the <b>Army</b> <b>Corps</b> <b>of</b> <b>Engineers</b> approved the statement and although agencies still disagreed on the wetlands issues, held public hearings in 2004.|$|E

5|$|In the 1920s, the U.S. <b>Army</b> <b>Corps</b> <b>of</b> <b>Engineers</b> widened, straightened, and deepened the canal.

The new route along George Street and Lock Street, which became part of US 213 in 1927 and is now MD 285 and MD 537, entirely bypassed what is now MD 284.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this effort was to improve the description of self-aerated flow. Because entrained air contributes greatly to absorption of oxygen and the transfer of other gases and can significantly reduce cavitation damage, being able to estimate the amount of air entrained in spillway flows is important. To achieve this objective, the conceptual descriptions of the aeration process, proffered by past researchers,were closely examined. New concepts were proposed regarding the conceptual definition of entrained air. Data from selected past efforts were analyzed within this new framework to estimate the air entrainment at <b>Corps</b> <b>of</b> <b>Engineers</b> (CE) spillways.
