5|$|In 1980, Monster Cable Products {{moved out}} of Lee's garage and into a San Francisco facility. It also {{introduced}} its second <b>audio</b> <b>cable,</b> Interlink. The company grew through word-of-mouth and {{an increasing number of}} retailers that carried Monster products. It attempted to enter the market for audio devices for automotive briefly, but withdrew to focus on home entertainment. Its first product intended for the mass-market was introduced in 1987.|$|E
25|$|Essentially, amplifying an {{electric}} violin {{is exactly the}} same as amplifying a guitar. They both produce an audio output which is transferred through an <b>audio</b> <b>cable</b> into an amp or PA. For this reason, there are few amps that are specifically for violin, and even those can be repurposed for guitar. Most electric violinists use standard guitar amplifiers. The advantage with using guitar amps is that they have been used for years and their sound is reliable, though not all guitar amps will give a desired tone. Some prefer the more mellow tone of tube amps over solid state amps and digital PA's for violins.|$|E
500|$|Lee {{called the}} 12-gauge <b>audio</b> <b>cable</b> he created [...] "Monster" [...] {{due to its}} size. According to Vision Magazine, the first Monster cable was [...] "a low-resistance twin-axial {{stranded}} design." [...] Lee manufactured the cable by hand on a ping pong table and sold it door-to-door. According to Lee, Pacific Stereo was the first electronics retailer {{to give him a}} chance to sell Monster cables in their store.|$|E

500|$|In 1922, the {{publication}} Radio World {{stated that the}} cable's {{first two years of}} operation had been successful. [...] Also in 1922, Radio Broadcast boasted about the money saved by the cable as well as the ease of using it. [...] The cable itself was paid for using public funds, but it was the responsibility of ship owners to outfit their vessels with receiving equipment. Installation of the cable cost roughly $50,000 and the listening apparatus installed on each ship using the channel cost $1,200, compared with hourly costs of delays that ranged from $500 to $4,000. [...] Radio Broadcast expressed the belief that navigation cables would become common for both ships and aircraft: [...] "...there is a future for the <b>audio</b> <b>cable...</b> Its fullest usefulness at American ports and elsewhere waits, however, on that large appreciation of radio devices for sea as well as air navigation which pilots, both on the sea and in the air, expect, but do not as yet demand." ...|$|E
500|$|Noel Lee is {{credited}} with turning the <b>audio</b> <b>cable</b> market into a [...] "profitable cottage industry" [...] and with changing the consumer mindset to see audio cables {{as a way to}} improve sound quality. He was awarded the Plus X Lifetime Achievement Award for his role in shaping a market and was named Northern California Entrepreneur of the Year by Ernst & Young. The company he founded became a household name and market-share leader. Monster does not disclose its financials, but industry analysts estimate the company is [...] "hugely profitable." [...] Lee calls himself the [...] "Head Monster" [...] and calls the company culture the [...] "Monster Attitude." [...] The company, while still best known for audio wiring, now carries 6,000 different products, such as headphones and home theater components. Its products are sold in more than 15,000 stores and it owns over 375 patents. Monster became one of the largest employers in the Bay Area.|$|E
500|$|In October, after {{realizing he}} lacked the funds to pursue the {{projects}} he wanted to, he decided instead {{to work on the}} Voldo video project using the song [...] "Hot in Herre". However, the only partner he had to create the video with was his roommate, who wished to be credited anonymously as [...] "Msr. M." [...] and initially {{wanted nothing to do with}} it. After seeing Brandt work on the concept by himself however, M. decided to help under the stipulation that the project's schedule fit around his drinking habit. Development of the choreography was completed the next day, and the following five days were devoted to producing the video at five-hour intervals for each day, while the music played through the television via a PlayStation 2's <b>audio</b> <b>cable.</b> However, by the fifth day, both realized that the music was actually distracting, and Brandt recorded himself counting out the beat of the song. Using this as the audio track, they were able to complete the project easily, and after editing the video Brandt released two versions online, with the latter utilizing the song [...] "Kiss" [...] by Prince.|$|E
500|$|Monster {{manufactures}} 6,000 different products, including headphones, speakers, surge protectors, televisions, {{and accessories}} for cars and mobile devices. The company {{is best known}} for its speaker cable. [...] It created the market for high-end <b>audio</b> <b>cables</b> in the 1980s. According to a reporter from SoundStage Network, it [...] "has retained a huge lead" [...] for high-end <b>audio</b> <b>cables</b> ever since.|$|R
500|$|Initial {{sales were}} slow, {{because at the}} time {{electronics}} retailers provided low-cost lamp cords to consumers for free or at low prices and audiophiles didn't believe <b>audio</b> <b>cables</b> made a difference in the sound. Monster is credited with creating the market for high-end <b>audio</b> <b>cables</b> in the 1980s through Lee's [...] "marketing prowess". He did demonstrations comparing the <b>audio</b> of standard <b>cables</b> to Monster cables for retailers and trained their salespeople {{to do the same for}} customers.|$|R

2500|$|The tighter {{specifications}} for video cable tends {{to produce a}} substantially constant characteristic impedance over a wide band (usually nominally 75Ω). [...] On the other hand, <b>audio</b> <b>cable</b> may be nominally 600Ω (300Ω and 150Ω are also standard values), but it will only actually measure this value at 800Hz. [...] At a lower frequencies {{it will be much}} higher and at higher frequencies will be lower and more reactive.|$|E
2500|$|The three-pin XLR {{connector}} {{is commonly}} used for DMX512, on lighting and related control equipment., particularly at the budget / DJ end of the market. [...] However, using three-pin XLR connectors for DMX512 is specifically prohibited by section 7.1.2 of the DMX512 standard. [...] Use of the three-pin XLR in this context firstly presents a risk of damage to the lighting equipment should an <b>audio</b> <b>cable</b> carrying 48 volt phantom power be accidentally connected, and secondly encourages the use of cable following analogue audio specifications for DMX, {{which can lead to}} signal degradation and unreliable operation of the DMX network.|$|E

5000|$|An <b>audio</b> {{multicore}} <b>cable</b> (often colloquially {{referred to}} in the US and Canada as a snake cable or just a snake) is a thick cable which contains from four to 64 individual <b>audio</b> <b>cables</b> inside a common, sturdy outer jacket. <b>Audio</b> multicore <b>cables</b> are widely used whenever multiple audio signals, for example from a number of microphones, need to be conveyed between common locations. Typical professional audio applications include audio recording, sound reinforcement, PA systems and broadcasting. The [...] "snake" [...] is typically used {{to make it easier to}} route many signals from the location of the microphones or other input transducers, to the location of the audio console and sound recording, broadcasting and/or sound reinforcement equipment is located.|$|R
5|$|Monster {{was founded}} in 1979 by Noel Lee as Monster Cable Products. Lee, an audiophile and engineer, was experimenting with {{different}} copper qualities, wire constructs and winding methods of <b>audio</b> <b>cables</b> in his family's garage and comparing them while listening to Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture. He became convinced that <b>audio</b> <b>cables</b> could be engineered to improve audio quality by conducting electricity more efficiently. Using a borrowed portion of somebody's booth at the 1978 Consumer Electronics Show, he did demonstrations of his cables in comparison to standard wires. After a positive reception at CES, he quit his job at Lawrence Berkeley Lab and started Monster Cable Products with $250,000 in bank financing. Monster's first cables were manufactured by Lee by hand and sold door-to-door.|$|R

Its catologue included work by Charles Fambrough, Victor Lewis, James Newton, Edward Simon, and Larry Willis.|$|E
5000|$|Capacitance occurs {{between any}} two {{conductors}} separated by an insulator. In an <b>audio</b> <b>cable,</b> capacitance occurs between the cable's two conductors; the resulting losses are called [...] "dielectric losses" [...] or [...] "dielectric absorption". Capacitance also occurs between the cable's conductors and any nearby conductive objects, including house wiring and damp foundation concrete; {{this is called}} [...] "stray capacitance".|$|E
5000|$|Next, Church {{turned his}} {{attention}} to the way audio was distributed around the broadcast plant. At that time, the infrastructure of analog radio plants consisted of miles of multiconductor <b>audio</b> <b>cable</b> wired to walls full of punch blocks at each end. Installation and maintenance was time consuming and expensive. Church set out to find a better way.|$|E
50|$|In sound {{recording}} and reproduction, ground lift or earth lift {{is a technique}} used to reduce or eliminate ground-related noise arising from ground loops in <b>audio</b> <b>cables.</b> It may also increase or decrease noise from other sources. Activating the ground lift on a particular piece of equipment opens {{the connection between the}} equipment ground and the shielding conductor of <b>audio</b> <b>cables</b> attached to the equipment, leaving those cables grounded only at their opposite end.If all pieces of equipment are tied to a common ground reference without establishing ground loop, no current flows in the ground conductors and cable shields, and no noise is introduced into signal circuits. In applications such as sound reinforcement for a concert, however, it is difficult to ensure all equipment shares a common ground reference.|$|R
50|$|Nordost {{was founded}} in 1991 to {{manufacture}} <b>audio</b> <b>cables</b> for the high-end market. Their original Flatline cable was the first loudspeaker cable to use FEP (Fluorinated Ethene Propylene). All Nordost cables use a flexible FEP insulation originally developed by DuPont.
