5|$|Josephine {{grew up in}} a well-to-do and {{politically}} connected progressive family which helped develop in her a strong social conscience <b>and</b> <b>firmly</b> held religious ideals. She married George Butler, an Anglican divine and schoolmaster, and the couple had four children, the last of whom, Eva, died falling from a bannister. The death was a turning point for Josephine, and she focused her feelings on helping others, starting with the inhabitants of a local workhouse. She began to campaign for women's rights in British law. In 1869 she became involved in the campaign to repeal the Contagious Diseases Acts, legislation that attempted to control the spread of venereal diseases—particularly in the British Army and Royal Navy—through the forced medical examination of prostitutes, a process she described as surgical or steel rape. The campaign achieved its final success in 1886 with the repeal of the Acts. Josephine also formed the International Abolitionist Federation, a Europe-wide organisation to combat similar systems on the continent.|$|E
5|$|There {{were five}} of them, a {{somewhat}} exceptional number: William P. Halliday, Samuel B. Halliday, Edwin W. Halliday, Henry L. Halliday, and Thomas W. Halliday. Of them all, I may {{be permitted to}} say that while they all differed from each other, they all exhibited features of character and conduct {{that would have given}} them prominence anywhere in the business world. No doubt in some one or two important respects, each one excelled the others. This was shown in those matters and things to which they gave their chief attention. Speaking of them and their families, so well represented here with us and elsewhere, {{it can be said that}} they have always stood for better things, not with assumption or pharisaically, but openly <b>and</b> <b>firmly.</b> They pushed their business enterprises with diligence, and had there been more of such men it would have been better for the city and for them also, I have no doubt.|$|E

25|$|In marked {{contrast}} with the FNLA, the FLEC’s efforts to mobilize international support for its government in exile met with little success. In fact, the majority of Organization of African Unity (OAU) members, concerned that this could encourage separatism elsewhere on the continent, committed to the sanctity of state borders <b>and</b> <b>firmly</b> rejected recognition of the FLEC’s government in exile.|$|E
25|$|By the dynasty's end, a very {{different}} state had emerged: medieval Byzantium, a chiefly agrarian, military-dominated society that was engaged in a lengthy struggle with the Muslim Caliphate. However, this state was also far more homogeneous, being reduced to its mostly Greek-speaking <b>and</b> <b>firmly</b> Chalcedonian core territories, which enabled it to weather these storms and enter a period of stability under the successor Isaurian Dynasty.|$|E

Al-Atrash supported the political union of Egypt and Syria in 1958, <b>and</b> <b>firmly</b> opposed the process of separation in 1961. He is also known for his contributions to social life and development in the Druze Mountain.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{this period}} there were {{continued}} Mongol interventions in Tibet and a reciprocal spread of Tibetan Buddhism in Mongolia.

Further afield, military campaigns against Nepalese and Gurkhas forced these peoples to submit and send tribute.|$|E

25|$|The Byzantine–Bulgarian {{conflict}} {{reached its}} apex in 1003, when Hungary became involved. Since {{the beginning of}} the 9th century, the Bulgarian territory had stretched beyond the Carpathian Mountains as far as the Tisza River and the middle Danube. During the reign of Samuel, the governor of these northwestern parts was duke Ahtum, the grandson of duke Glad, who had been defeated by the Hungarians in the 930s. Ahtum commanded a strong army <b>and</b> <b>firmly</b> defended the northwestern borders of the Empire. He also built many churches and monasteries through which he spread Christianity in Transylvania.|$|E
25|$|Her first novel, Castle Rackrent (1800) {{was written}} and {{submitted}} for anonymous publication in 1800 without her father's knowledge. It {{was an immediate}} success <b>and</b> <b>firmly</b> established Edgeworth's appeal. The book is a satire on Anglo-Irish landlords, before the year 1782, showing {{the need for more}} responsible management by the Irish landowning class. The story follows four generations of an Irish landholding family, the Rackrents. It is narrated by an Irish catholic worker on the estate, named Thady Quirk, and portrayed the rise of the catholic-Irish middle class.|$|E

25|$|Saint Catherine {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} saints in the religious culture of the late Middle Ages, and arguably considered the most important of the virgin martyrs, a group including Saint Agnes, Margaret of Antioch, Saint Barbara, Saint Lucy, Valerie of Limoges and many others. Her power as an intercessor was renowned <b>and</b> <b>firmly</b> established in most versions of her hagiography, in which she specifically entreats Christ at the moment of her death to answer the prayers of those who remember her martyrdom and invoke her name.|$|E
25|$|For introduction, {{the woman}} is to sit down, so to say, on her heels, with her legs spread apart, which will bring the womb down as low as possible. Then taking the womb veil into the right hand with the cavity looking upward and {{compressed}} from side to side, giving it thus {{the shape of an}} ellipse, she has to push it up the vagina as far as it will go. It will then spread out of its own accord and apply itself closely <b>and</b> <b>firmly</b> to the neck of the womb.|$|E
25|$|The Voice of Free Libya (Arabic: Sawt Libya al-Hurra) or {{sometimes}} Radio Free Libya (Arabic: Idha'at Libya al-Hurra) are the names used by several radio stations {{aligned with the}} Libyan rebels.

They all carry material strongly supportive of the rebels <b>and</b> <b>firmly</b> critical of Gaddafi. Output is in Arabic, with the Nalut station also said to use Berber (Tamazight).|$|E
