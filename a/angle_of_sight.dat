Heavier raids against Swansea began on 4/5 January 1941, when a bomb {{put all the}} GOR telephone lines out of action, but 248 Bty at S and T sites was able to continue with 'Ball of Fire' barrages controlled by T site's GL radar with Effie providing <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight.</b> 248 Battery's S and T sites were heavily engaged again on 17/18 January as the German aircraft bombed systematically across the town.

5000|$|Bridgman's {{theory was}} criticized because we measure [...] "length" [...] {{in various ways}} (e.g. it's {{impossible}} to use a measuring rod {{if we want to}} measure the distance to the Moon), [...] "length" [...] logically isn't one concept but many, some concepts requiring knowledge of geometry. Each concept is to be defined by the measuring operations used. Another example is the radius of a sphere, obtaining different values depending on the way it is measured (say, in metres and in millimeters). Bridgman said the concept is defined on the measurement. So the criticism is that we could potentially end up with endless concepts, each defined by the things that measured the concept, such as <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>sighting,</b> day <b>of</b> the solar year, angular subtense of the moon, etc. which were gathered together, some astronomical observations taken over a period of thousands of years.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the number}} of charges and its compact turret, the Abbot did not have {{calibrating}} sights. Instead, the sight mount had both Tangent Elevation (TE) and <b>Angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sight</b> Scales and a separate Gun Rule to convert range into TE, corrected for the muzzle velocity variation from standard. The dial sight had all scales internal, illuminated and viewed through a single eyepiece.|$|E
5000|$|In World War II, {{a height}} finder was an optical {{rangefinder}} {{used to determine}} the altitude of an aircraft (actually the slant range from the emplacement which was combined with the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight,</b> in a mechanical computer, to produce altitude), used to direct anti-aircraft guns. [...] Examples of American and Japanese versions exist, in the Soviet Union it was usually combined with optical rangefinders, certainly a German version exist.|$|E
50|$|Grazing fire is {{when the}} cone of fire does not exceed 1.8 meters (the average height of a man) above the ground. When each bullet is fired, it will leave {{the barrel of the}} weapon at the axis of bore set from the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> desired to strike the target area. The {{trajectory}} of the round should be constant as well as maximum ordinate. Maximum ordinate is the highest point of the trajectory, which is usually 2/3 the distance to the target from the weapon. Depending on the caliber of the round being fired and the slope of the terrain, as well as the distance to the target, the bullet will maintain a semi-flat trajectory. With 7.62×51mm NATO ammunition, which is most commonly used with, for example, the M240 machine gun, the bullet will reach a distance of 600 meters traveling at 900 meters per second or 2,800 feet per second, before it begins a pronounced downward trajectory to the earth. Any distance beyond that range will be considered plunging fire due to the arc (axis of bore + <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight)</b> needed to impact the target area.|$|E

5000|$|A milliradian, {{often called}} a mil or mrad, is an SI derived unit for angular {{measurement}} which {{is defined as}} a thousandth of a radian (0.001 radian). Mils are used in adjustment <b>of</b> firearm <b>sights</b> by adjusting the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> the <b>sight</b> compared to the barrel (up, down, left or right). Mils are also used for comparing shot groupings, or to compare the difficulty of hitting different sized targets at different distances. Using optics with mil markings in the reticle one can make a range estimation of a known size target, or vice versa to determine a target size if the distance is known, a practice called [...] "milling".|$|R

This allowed it to be mounted to the side of aircraft like the Supermarine Walrus, or to the floor of dedicated bomber aircraft like the Bristol Blenheim. As the most common change in angle is due to changes in aircraft trim with changes in airspeed, earlier models featured a prominent setting for correcting the fore-aft <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> the <b>sight,</b> which can be seen {{on the left side of}} pre-Mk.

50|$|Even a tiny {{error in}} the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> {{alignment}} results in a trajectory that diverges from the target on a trajectory directly relative to {{the distance from the}} target, causing the bullet to miss the target; for example, with a 10 meter air rifle shooter trying to hit the 10 ring, which is merely a 0.5 mm diameter dot on the target at 10 m and with a 4.5 mm diameter pellet, an error of only 0.2 mm in sight alignment can mean a complete miss (a 3 mm point of impact miss). At 1000 m, that same misalignment would be magnified 100 times, giving an error of over 300 mm, 1,500 times the sight misalignment. Increasing the distance between the front and rear sights, called the sight radius or sighting line, helps to reduce eventual angle errors and will, in case the sight has an incremental adjustment mechanism, adjust in smaller increments when compared to a further identical shorter sighting line. With the front sight on {{the front end of the}} barrel, sight radius may be increased by moving the rear sight from the barrel onto the receiver or tang.|$|E

This symmetrical two- storeyed structure consists of a raised concrete platform, with buttressed supports, on which the six inch gun was fixed facing east.

The western side of the platform is enclosed, with a shell handling facility on the northern side which accessed the storage area below.

The platform is roofed by heavy timber logs, cantilevered to the east, with timber boarding and concrete above and cement filled hessian bag infill. Large timber post and beam support members are located on the exterior walls. Remnants of painted camouflage are visible on the northern wall. The ground floor contains a room at the southwest with the remains of a duty roster on the northern wall, with another room to the east of this.

Since the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> guidance law is to make the UAV flight path angle and <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> be proportional to the rate of change, flight path angle can be tracked by controlling the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight.</b> That taking the guidance law into use can reduce the sensitivity of UAV motion on the ship parameters change, thereby to obtain more stable trajectory.

The primary environmental characteristics were layout orthogonality (using paths that intersected at either oblique or 90 ° <b>angles),</b> lines <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> (controlled using computer-generated “fog”), a visually defined perimeter and global landmarks. Participants travelled less far in orthogonal than oblique environments, even when fog was used to make the distance that participants could see equivalent.

30|$|Delivering {{worldwide}} interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX) {{services in}} the 3.5 [*]GHz band from HAPs is {{an effective way to}} provide wireless broadband communications. HAPs, recently proposed novel aerial platforms operating at an altitude of 17 – 22 [*]km, have been suggested by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) for providing communications in mm-wave broadband wireless access (BWA) and the third-generation (3 G) communication frequency bands [1 – 3]. Investigations on HAPs have therefore been mainly concentrated in mm-wave band and code division multiple access (CDMA) schemes delivered from HAPs. HAP systems have many characteristics including high receiver elevation <b>angle,</b> line <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> (LOS) transmission, large coverage area, and mobile deployment. These characteristics make HAPs to be competitive to conventional terrestrial and satellite systems, and furthermore contribute to a better overall system performance, greater system capacity and cost-effective deployment.|$|R
