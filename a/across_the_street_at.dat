There are two main buildings, the Civic Center housing government offices and the Plaza Building housing retail space.

5|$|Madison Avenue {{is part of}} the {{cross-country}} US Route 20, and at four lanes wide it is {{the busiest}} street in the district. Roughly 90 buildings on Madison Avenue face the park. East of the intersection with Robin Street, Madison is more urban with 19th-century rowhouses; west of Robin Street is dominated by large detached residences, many of which have been converted to medical offices. A few buildings, such as 694 and 710 Madison predate park improvements that occurred <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>at</b> the Taylor property, which later became basketball and tennis courts. 682 Madison was formerly the home of the Academy of Holy Names. It is currently administrative offices for the Albany Medical Center Annex.|$|E
5|$|There is {{a railway}} {{station on the}} Gjøvik Line also called Nydalen, that is served by NSB Gjøvikbanen {{as part of the}} Oslo Commuter Rail. It is located many hundred meters from the metro station, and the two do not offer inter{{connection}}s. There is a shorter connection to the Gjøvik Line at Storo (that connects with Grefsen Station). Nydalen also serves several bus routes. Line 37 via the city center to Helsfyr operates from <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>at</b> Nydalen, while additional buses are located somewhat further away. They consist a feeder service to Lillo Terrasse (line 55) as well as lines 30 to Bygdøy, 51 to Maridalen and 58 to Helsfyr.|$|E

5000|$|On {{his return}} to England he retired from active service and settled at Lowestoft, where he died on 31 August 1737. A {{monument}} in Lowestoft church still keeps alive his memory, which, throughout the last century, was further distinguished by a local custom now obsolete. 'It is customary,' wrote Gillingwater in 1790, 'at Lowestoft to hang flags <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>at</b> weddings. <b>The</b> colours belonging to the Royal Philip taken by Lieutenant Arnold have frequently been made use of upon these occasions.' ...|$|R

25|$|Trinity College is {{believed}} {{by many to}} be the setting of Robertson Davies’ novel The Rebel Angels. Evidence includes the similarities between Trinity and the fictional College described in the text; the fact that Davies taught at Trinity for 20 years while living <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>at</b> Massey College; and that a picture of Trinity's central tower (Episkopon tower) is prominently featured on the cover of the novel's first edition.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Blood {{knocked the}} ashes from his pipe, and drew back {{to close his}} window. As he did so, his glance {{travelling}} straight <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> met <b>at</b> last <b>the</b> glance of those hostile eyes that watched him. There were two pairs, and they belonged to the Misses Pitt, two amiable, sentimental maiden ladies who yielded to none in Bridgewater in their worship of the handsome Monmouth.|$|R
25|$|From August 2017 {{through early}} 2020, the Main Branch {{is set to}} host an interim library at 42nd Street.

25|$|Sculptor Brenda Putnam {{was hired}} in May 1930 to design a {{sculpture}} of Puck for a garden {{on the west side}} of the building. Decades of exposure weakened the statue, and after Puck's right hand was found <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>at</b> the Library of Congress in 2000, the original piece was moved. It now sits above the entrance to the Elizabethan Theatre, and an aluminum statue replaced the original in the garden.|$|E

6000|$|Mr. Fotheringham {{could see}} no one--could not be of any service.

5000|$|At the {{statehood}} convention, Peabody nominates Stoddard as the territory's {{delegate to}} Washington, but his [...] "unstatesmanlike" [...] conduct is challenged by a rival candidate. Stoddard decides that he cannot be entrusted with public service after killing {{a man in}} a gunfight. Doniphon takes him aside and, in an inception flashback, confides that he, Doniphon, actually killed Valance from an alley <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> firing <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same time as Stoddard. Reinspired, Stoddard returns to the convention, accepts the nomination, and is elected to the Washington delegation.|$|R
25|$|With the {{construction}} of Union Station in 1906, hotel development was stimulated. The Elmira Hotel, now located at 1804 Front Street, was built in 1905 just before Union Station was completed. In 1910 the Terminal Hotel was constructed <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>at</b> 1902 Front Street. Both hotels provided rooms for travelers passing through Union Station. Since Union Station was expanded and restored in 1997, these two hotels have been rehabilitated, {{along with many other}} downtown buildings in the following years.|$|E
25|$|The {{building}} was targeted for another bomb threat in October 1995, but no bomb was found. On the one year {{anniversary of the}} Oklahoma City bombing, a piece from the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building was added to a memorial <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>at</b> Terry Schrunk Plaza, which includes an underground parking structure for the Green-Wyatt Building. That structure was the planned assassination site of Charles H.

Col Chambers had been {{recommended}} for the award on April 7, 1945 following his evacuation, seriously wounded, from Iwo Jima. He had initially received the Navy Cross for his actions, but upon re-examination of the original recommendation with additional evidence, his award was upgraded to the Medal of Honor a few years later.|$|E

For reasons unknown, Stine drove one block past Maple to Cherry Street; the passenger then shot Stine once {{in the head with a}} 9mm, took Stine's wallet and car keys, and tore away a section of Stine's bloodstained shirt tail. This passenger was observed by three teenagers <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>at</b> 9:55p.m., who called the police while the crime was in progress. They observed a man wiping the cab down before walking away towards the Presidio, one block to the north.|$|E
500|$|In June 2000, a {{need for}} more {{performance}} space became apparent; the school's music groups used small, crowded rehearsal rooms and drama students performed in the old chapel or <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>at</b> Sacred Heart Monastery. Benet began construction of a new [...] performing arts center at the east end of the campus to replace the 190-seat Assembly Hall {{on the third floor of}} St. Joseph Hall, originally a chapel for the St. Joseph Bohemian Orphanage.

[...] As soon as he entered Inside Administration, he was yanked through the doorway. [...] His escort realized something was wrong and retreated, escaping back through Tower 7. [...] The guards on top of this tower knew something was wrong and had tried to warn the warden, but the blustery spring wind had obliterated their words.|$|E
60|$|Gently she {{released}} her hands, {{and she did}} not answer at once. She went to the window, and stared <b>across</b> <b>the</b> sloping <b>street</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> grilled railing before the big house opposite, thinking. Her reason told her that he should not come, but her spirit rebelled against that reason. It was a pleasure to see him, so she freely admitted to herself. Why should she not have that pleasure? If the truth be told, she had argued it all out before, when she had wondered whether he would come. Mrs. Merrill, she thought, would not object to his coming. But--there was the question she had meant to ask him.|$|R

5000|$|No {{one noticed}} the slight {{rustling}} {{of the corn}} blades. Not one saw the hand that parted them skillfully {{to make way for}} the gun which accomplished its deadly work.
