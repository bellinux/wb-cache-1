40|$|In this work, a {{wind turbine}} shrink disk {{is used as}} the {{research}} object to investigate load-carrying performance of a multi-layer interference fit, and the theoretical model and finite element model are constructed. According to those models, a MW-level turbine shrink disk is designed, and a test device is developed to apply torque to this turbine shrink disk by hydraulic jack. Then, the circumferential slip between the contact surfaces is monitored and the slip of all contact surfaces is zero. This conclusion verifies the reasonability of the proposed models. The effect of the key influencing factors, such as machining deviation, <b>assembly</b> <b>clearance</b> and propel stroke, were analyzed. The contact pressure and load torque of the mating surfaces were obtained by building typical models with different parameters using finite element analysis (FEA). The {{results show that the}} minimum <b>assembly</b> <b>clearance</b> and the machining deviation within the machining range have little influence on load-carrying performance of multi-layer interference fit, while having a greater influence on the maximum <b>assembly</b> <b>clearance</b> and the propel stroke. The results also show that the load-carrying performance of a multiple-layer interference fit can be ensured only if the key factors are set within a reasonable design range. To avoid the abnormal operation of equipment caused by insufficient load torque, the propel stroke during practical assembly should be at least 0. 95 times the designed propel stroke, which is significant in guiding the design and assembly of the multi-layer interference fit...|$|E

In order to apply appropriate torque, the relationship between tightening torque and initial load should be determined. In this study, a detailed three-dimensional finite element model of bolted joints was established with consideration of helix angle, pitch, thread type, tooth-type angle, and other details. The process of pre-tightening of bolted joints was simulated to validate the finite element model. The curves for the relationship between the torque and initial load obtained from finite element analysis agree well with those calculated from theoretical equations. Then, the influence of the friction coefficient, pitch, elastic modulus, <b>assembly</b> <b>clearance,</b> and strain-hardening exponent on the relationship was studied. The results show that the friction coefficient between nut and joint has great influence on the relationship between torque and initial load, that is, the larger the friction coefficient, the smaller the initial load of bolt at the same tightening torque. In contrast, the pitch, <b>assembly</b> <b>clearance,</b> Young’s modulus, and strain-hardening exponent have little influence on torque–initial load relation.

A novel concept and process chain is the assembly of piezoceramic micro parts into local microstructures of metal sheets and subsequent joining by forming.

The machine is unique, with two open-faced centrifugal compressor impellers in the center, three steam turbine stages overhanging {{on one end of}} the rotor and a radial hot gas expander overhanging on the other end, all connected with curviccouplings. The machine operates at 18, 500 rpm and is used in the production of 300 tons per day of nitric acid. The plant has two identical units, one serving as a spare unit while the other is in service. The two modules are designated as serial number 1 (SN- 1) and serial number 2 (SN- 2). Ever since their first acquisition in 1978, SN- 1 has proven to be more reliable than SN- 2. While SN- 1 has suffered four failures, SN 2 has suffered 13 failures, six of which have been while the rotor was being field balanced and/or passing through its first bending critical. The other failures can be attributed to various system failures at the plant. Each failure was followed by an overhaul, the extent of which depended upon the amount of damage caused, but no serious consideration was ever given to improving the overall reliability of the machine. By the end of 1992, it was decided that the condition of the machine had deteriorated to the point where it could not be returned to service with a regular overhaul. Additionally, the reliability of the machine had to be improved. A detailed rotordynamic analysis was considered imperative to understanding the nature of the machine. Critical rotor components were manufactured to replace existing ones. A detailed balancing procedure was adopted, and a mock-assembly was performed to set <b>assembly</b> <b>clearances</b> accurately prior to the final assembly. A shop balancing and assembly manual was written to closely control the entire overhaul. The rotordynamic study and procedures adopted to improve the reliability of the machine are described. Also included are the actual startup data. The repair procedures have proven extremely successful, as can be seen from a comparison of the startup data before and after the overhaul. Vibration amplitudes at startup, as the machine passes through its first bending critical speed, are lower than seen previously. The machine was installed in November 1993, and has been shut down and started numerous times. Each time the machine has come up to operating speed without any problems, indicating that the overall mechanical reliability of the machine has been significantly improved.

The folding of Aβ into neurotoxic oligomeric, protofibrillar, and fibrillar assemblies is hypothesized to be the key pathologic event in AD. Aβ is formed through cleavage of the Aβ precursor protein by two endoproteinases, β-secretase and γ-secretase, that cleave the Aβ N-terminus and C-terminus, respectively. These facts support the relevance of therapeutic strategies targeting Aβ production, <b>assembly,</b> <b>clearance,</b> and neurotoxicity. Currently, no disease-modifying therapeutic agents are available for AD patients. Instead, existing therapeutics provide only modest symptomatic benefits for a limited time.

The rotations between two geometric features are linearized, i. e. displacements are transformed into small displacements. An ideal surface is a surface, which can be characterized by a finite number of geometric features: point, centerline, part face, etc. A nominal surface is an ideal surface by definition. By modeling fabricated surfaces in ideal surfaces, it is possible to compute the limits of small displacements of a fabricated surface inside a tolerance zone.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{deals with}} the class of robotic {{assemblies}} where position uncertainty far exceeds <b>assembly</b> <b>clearance,</b> and visual assistance is not available to resolve the uncertainty. Specifically, {{we focus on the}} assembly of a key in a lock, with uncertainty in the position of the lock in (x, y, z). Under this scenario, we implement a localization strategy that resolves the uncertainty using a pre-acquired map of key-lock contact configurations. Prior to assembly, the strategy explores the contact configuration space (C-space) by using the key to probe the stationary (fixtured) lock-surface at various different positions and matching the contact configurations thus recorded with the map. Thus, the strategy is progressively able to localize the lock-position in (x, y, z) and achieve assembly. However, with a sampled map of the contact C-space, discretization errors are introduced, and implementing deterministic matching (at the fine-grained level necessary for assembly) would soon become prohibitively expensive in terms of computation. Additionally, with global initial uncertainty, multiple solutions abound in our localization problem. Here, we use a particle filter implementation, which can not only handle the discretization errors in map-matching, but also track multiple solutions simultaneously. The particle filter implementation was highly successful in localizing the lock-position, reducing the uncertainty by more than 95 % and making it easy for a compliant strategy to achieve assembly. Results from 50 trials of the lock-key assembly are reported. I...|$|E

We consider peg-in-hole problems {{in which a}} needle-like peg has a {{single point of contact}} with the object that contains the hole, and in which the initial uncertainty in the relative pose (3 D position and 3 D angle) between the peg and the object is much greater than the required accuracy (<b>assembly</b> <b>clearance).</b> We solve this 6 degree-of-freedom (6 -DOF) localization problem using a Rao-Blackwellized particle filter, in which the probability distribution over the peg’s pose is factorized into two components: The distribution over position (3 -DOF) is represented by particles, while the distribution over angle (3 -DOF) is approximated as a Gaussian distribution for each particle, updated using an extended Kalman filter. This factorization reduces the number of particles required for localization by orders of magnitude, enabling real-time online 6 -DOF pose estimation. Each measurement is simply the contact position obtained by randomly repositioning the peg and moving towards the object until there is contact. To compute the likelihood of each measurement, we use a map a mesh model of the object that is based on the CAD model but also explicitly models the uncertainty in the map. The mesh uncertainty model makes our system robust to cases in which the actual measurement is different from the expected one. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach over previous methods using simulations as well as physical experiments with a robotic arm and a metal peg and object...|$|E

In a pin and hole assembly, as the pin diameter increases, for a given percent clearance, assembling low clearance features becomes difficult. An empirical equation is developed to guide the designer in selecting an appropriate voxel size based on feature size. These results advance the effort to improve manual assembly operations via haptic feedback in the virtual environment...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this dissertation aims to create a virtual assembly environment capable of simulating the constant and subtle interactions (hand-part, part-part) that occur during manual assembly, and providing appropriate feedback to the user in real-time. A virtual assembly system called SHARP 2 ̆ 2 System for Haptic Assembly and Realistic Prototyping 2 ̆ 2 is created, which utilizes simulated physical constraints for part placement during assembly.;The first approach taken in this research attempt utilized Voxmap Point Shell (VPS) software for implementing collision detection and physics-based modeling in SHARP. A volumetric approach, where complex CAD models were represented by numerous small cubic-voxel elements was used to obtain fast physics update rates (500 [...] 1000 Hz). A novel dual-handed haptic interface was developed and integrated into the system allowing the user to simultaneously manipulate parts with both hands. However, coarse model approximations used for collision detection and physics-based modeling only allowed <b>assembly</b> when minimum <b>clearance</b> was limited to ∼ 8 - 10...|$|R
40|$|International audienceProductivity and {{industrial}} product quality improvements entail a rational tolerancing process {{to be applied}} as early as product design. Once functional conditions are defined, an optimal specification for each component in a mechanical system is to be developed. Despite numerous studies in this area, the problem is still far from solved. It may be decomposed into two stages: development of specifications based on standards, or qualitative synthesis, and calculation of tolerances. To the extent that these two sets of problems are related, we propose to address them in parallel. In this paper, we present an original method that enables us to solve these two problems for the case of serial <b>assembly</b> (stacking) without <b>clearances.</b> This method {{is based on the}} use of influence coefficients to obtain the relationship between the functional tolerance and the tolerances associated with the geometry of the mechanism's interface surfaces. We will describe a calculation algorithm that helps obtain influence coefficients solely from the assembly's geometric definition. Then, we will show that under our working hypothesis, this relationship is piecewise linear...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} the temporal order of recruitment of transcription factors, cofactors and basal transcriptional components {{and the consequent}} biochemical events that lead to activation of the major histocompatibility class II (MHCII) DRA gene transcription by IFN-γ. We found that the gene is ‘poised’ for activation since both the activators and {{a fraction of the}} basal transcriptional machinery are pre-assembled at the enhancer and promoter prior to IFN-γ treatment. The class II transactivator is synthesized following IFN-γ treatment and it is recruited to the enhanceosome leading to the subsequent recruitment of the CBP and GCN 5 coactivators. This is followed by histone acetylation and recruitment of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. CIITA also recruits the CDK 7 and CDK 9 kinases and enhances the ability of CDK 7 to phosphorylate Pol II at Ser 5 leading to initiation of mRNA synthesis. Thus, the gene-specific class II transactivator selects the target genes for expression by coordinating a multiple set of biochemical activities ranging from chromatin alterations and pre-initiation complex <b>assembly</b> to promoter <b>clearance...</b>|$|R
