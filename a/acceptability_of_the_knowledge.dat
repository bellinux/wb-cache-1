40|$|Purpose: Participation {{throughout}} one’s life plays {{a significant}} role for development and emotional well-being. For this reason, {{there is a need to}} identify ways to facilitate participation in family activities for children and adolescents with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities (PIMD). Methods: The study design was qualitative and explorative, based on semi structured interviews with 11 parents and 9 personal assistants of children with PIMD. Results: The interviews revealed participation-facilitating strategies relating to the children’s/adolescent’s proximal environment, such as “Availability and <b>acceptability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> activity”, “Good <b>knowledge</b> about <b>the</b> child” and a “A positive attitude of people close to the child”, as well as strategies related to the children/adolescents themselves: “Sense of belonging”, “Possible for the child/adolescent to understand”, “Opportunities to influence” and “Feeling of being needed”. Conclusions: Children and adolescents with PIMD are dependent on support obtained through their environment. The identified strategies, individually adapted through awareness and <b>knowledge</b> by <b>the</b> parents and the personal assistants, provide important evidence to assist our understanding in gaining understanding about how to improve participation in family activities of children and adolescents with PIMD...|$|R

30|$|We {{will first}} examine the {{estimates}} under the [+animacy contrast] condition. As expected, in both groups, <b>the</b> <b>acceptability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> canonical SVO sentences {{was very close}} to <b>the</b> highest score <b>of</b> 7 (younger 6.73, 95 % CI [6.45, 7.01]; older 6.47, [6.20, 6.73]).

Also, the estimate did not deviate significantly from that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ‘SOV’ sentences in the same group (estimated ‘SOV’ − ‘OSV’ difference in the older group: 0.11, [−[*] 0.51, 0.73], t(59.9)[*]=[*] 0.42, p. adj[*]=[*]. 908).

40|$|This {{descriptive}} study aimed to determine <b>the</b> utilization and <b>acceptability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two learning guides designed for Field Study 1 and Field Study 2. The 112 {{teachers and students}} were surveyed and interviewed to gather the pertinent data. <b>The</b> <b>acceptability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> learning guides were determined based on four elements – target competency, learning plan, reflections, and technical aspect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> material.

40|$|<b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the sensory and texture attributes of ice cream enriched with lupin concentrate and omega- 3 fatty acids, and to evaluate <b>the</b> <b>acceptability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> products.

30|$|In summary, {{regardless}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conditions <b>of</b> animacy, <b>the</b> <b>acceptability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SVO sentences {{was close}} to the highest score in both groups, which was not surprising because SVO is the canonical word order in Chinese. Under the [−animacy contrast] condition, the non-canonical ‘SOV’ and ‘OSV’ sentences (i.e., the AAV strings) were generally not acceptable in both groups. Under the [+animacy contrast] condition, <b>the</b> <b>acceptability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ‘SOV’ sentences (i.e., the AIV strings) was neutral in both groups. However, <b>the</b> <b>acceptability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ‘OSV’ sentences (i.e., the IAV strings) was significantly different in the two groups. In the older group, <b>the</b> <b>acceptability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ‘OSV’ sentences was as neutral as the ‘SOV’ sentences. In the younger group, by contrast, the ‘OSV’ sentences were biased to be acceptable, and the acceptability was significantly higher than that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ‘SOV’ sentences in the same group. Furthermore, a between-group difference for the ‘OSV’ sentences under the [+animacy contrast] condition was confirmed, with the acceptability in the younger group being significantly higher than that in the older group. It can be concluded that the older native speakers showed lower acceptance toward the ‘OSV’ sentences under the [+animacy contrast] condition (i.e., the IAV strings) than the younger speakers.|$|R

There was significant relationship between <b>the</b> educational background <b>of</b> <b>the</b> respondents and level <b>of</b> <b>acceptability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sweet potato drinks (χ 2 = 1. 033 and P = 0. 05).

40|$|Translating Indonesian reduplications into English {{is not an}} easy matter due to the {{difference}} in morphological form, syntactic function and semantic meaning of reduplications in both languages.

Thus, in assessing <b>the</b> <b>acceptability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> translation, those three factors should be considered.

30|$|Let us {{continue}} {{to examine the}} estimates under the [−animacy contrast] condition. <b>The</b> patterns <b>of</b> <b>the</b> estimated <b>acceptability</b> were similar between the two groups. In general, <b>the</b> <b>acceptability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> canonical SVO sentences was near <b>the</b> highest score <b>of</b> 7, and <b>the</b> <b>acceptability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> non-canonical ‘SOV’ and ‘OSV’ sentences was below <b>the</b> neutral score <b>of</b> 4. Recall that the nouns in the [−animacy contrast] sentences were both human names, and consequently, the derived non-canonical ‘SOV’ and ‘OSV’ sentences were both animate-animate-verb (AAV) strings. Thus, they were merely two variants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same kind, i.e., the AAV strings. Therefore, in principle, no difference should be found in <b>the</b> <b>acceptability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ‘SOV’ and ‘OSV’ sentences. This was confirmed by the analysis. In the younger group, the estimated difference between <b>the</b> <b>acceptability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ‘SOV’ and ‘OSV’ sentences was −[*] 0.06, 95 % CI [−[*] 0.63, 0.52], t(126.2)[*]=[*] 0.23, p. adj[*]=[*]. 971. In the older group, the estimated difference was 0.08, [−[*] 0.32, 0.48], t(99.7)[*]=[*] 0.47, p. adj[*]=[*]. 887. Neither of these differences reached statistical significance. Furthermore, {{there was no significant}} between-group difference found in the ‘SOV’ or ‘OSV’ sentences.
