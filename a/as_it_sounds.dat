Some, like Pigg (1066), Hogg (1079) and Hoggard, Hogarth (1279) are metonyms for a swineherd, while Oxer (1327) similarly denotes an oxherd and Shepherd (1279 onwards) means <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> a herder of sheep.|$|E
5|$|The {{music in}} Final Fantasy Tactics Advance was {{primarily}} composed by Hitoshi Sakimoto, with additional music contributed by Kaori Ohkoshi and Ayako Saso; Nobuo Uematsu provided the main theme. The Final Fantasy Tactics Advance Original Soundtrack album {{was released by}} DigiCube on February 19, 2003. It spans 74 tracks and has a duration of 2:05:27. The first disk includes every song from the game, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> through the Game Boy Advance hardware. The second disk contains fully orchestrated versions of 32 of the same 42 tracks. A new age arrangement album entitled White: Melodies of Final Fantasy Tactics Advance, a selection of musical tracks from the game arranged by Yo Yamazaki, Akira Sasaki, and Satoshi Henmi, was released by SME Visual Works on February 26, 2003. White spans 11 tracks and has a duration of 46:10. Within the game, the classical-themed soundtrack is compressed into MIDI file format. Simple sound effects are used during battles, {{and there are no}} voices or speech within the game.|$|E

25|$|For Hitchcock, the actors, {{like the}} props, {{were part of}} the film's setting, as he said to Truffaut:In my opinion, the chief {{requisite}} for an actor is the ability to do nothing well, which is by no means as easy <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds.</b> He should be willing to be utilised and wholly integrated into the picture by the director and the camera. He must allow the camera to determine the proper emphasis and the most effective dramatic highlights.|$|E
25|$|His {{reputation}} as a philosopher was established by his first book, Philosophy of the Unconscious (1869; 10th ed. 1890). This success was {{largely due to the}} originality of its title, the diversity of its contents (von Hartmann professing to obtain his speculative results by the methods of inductive science, and making plentiful use of concrete illustrations), its fashionable pessimism and the vigour and lucidity of its style. The conception of the Unconscious, by which von Hartmann describes his ultimate metaphysical principle is, fundamentally, not as paradoxical <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds,</b> being merely a new and mysterious designation for the Absolute of German metaphysicians.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} achieve this effect, a seam bowler usually {{delivers}} the ball with the seam held upright, with rotation about a horizontal axis. This keeps the seam aligned vertically as it travels towards the batsman, making it likely that the ball will bounce with the seam on the pitch. Of course, consistently hitting the seam is not as easy <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds.</b> The seam has to be held upright between the index finger and the middle finger {{at the time of}} the delivery of the ball and, most importantly, the wrist has to be dead straight when the ball is delivered. The seam and wrist position of Australia's Glenn McGrath are arguably a perfect example.|$|E

25|$|The summit {{area is a}} ridge running north–south {{with the}} final pyramid near the {{south-west}} corner and crags on three sides. The southern face is formed by Bowfell Links, an impressive wall of crag scarred by nine vertical gullies and with corresponding tongues of scree at its foot. A climb up these is neither pleasurable nor safe as they are extremely active loose rock channels. The eastern face carries a wealth of features including Flat Crag, Cambridge Crag and the Bowfell Buttress, the latter two providing good climbing. Flat Crag includes the Great Slab, a remarkable tilted sheet of rock which looks exactly <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds.</b> Below these faces runs the Climber's Traverse, a narrow path providing an excellent high-level walking route to the summit from the highest point of The Band. This largely horizontal line contours around beneath many of Bowfell's most dramatic crags, finally reaching the summit via a rocky route known as the River of Boulders, running parallel to the Great Slab. Finally on the north- east corner of the summit ridge is Hanging Knotts, a complex series of faces and outcrops looking down upon Angle Tarn.|$|E

500|$|Changes in the {{approach}} and storytelling of the show {{in the second and}} subsequent seasons led to more positive critical reception and made it a media favorite. Entertainment Weekly stated, [...] "The best new show of the year took a few weeks to grow on me, but now it's a full-blown addiction." [...] The Los Angeles Times called Walter Bishop one of the best characters of 2008, noting, [...] "the role of the modern-day mad scientist could so easily have been a disaster, but the 'Fringe' writers and the masterful John Noble have conspired to create a character that seems, as trite <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds,</b> more Shakespearean than sci-fi." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Vic Fontaine was received with mixed reviews by both critics and the public. While Keith DeCandido disliked {{the idea of}} the Fontaine program in his review of [...] "His Way" [...] for Tor.com, saying that [...] "It's silly, it's frivolous, it raises all kinds of ethical conundrums that the show never shows the remotest interest in investigating", he said that he enjoyed Darren's performance, which caused him to smile every time Darren spoke. Zack Handlen praised the 1960s scenes in [...] "His Way" [...] for The A.V. Club, saying that it [...] "isn't as entirely ridiculous <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds,</b> {{and the fact that it}} works even remotely is a testament to the actors and the script".|$|E
500|$|According to Rolling Stone, Marquee Moon was a post-punk album, while Jason Heller from The A.V. Club {{described}} it as [...] "elegantly jagged" [...] art punk. Robert Christgau regarded it {{as more of a}} rock record because of Television's formal and technical abilities as musicians: [...] "It wasn't punk. Its intensity wasn't manic; it didn't come in spurts." [...] Both sides of the album began with three shorter, hook-driven songs, which Stylus Magazines Evan Chakroff said veered between progressive rock and post-punk styles. The title track and [...] "Torn Curtain" [...] were longer and more jam-oriented. [...] "As peculiar <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds,</b> I've always thought that we were a pop band", Verlaine later told Select. [...] "You know, I always thought Marquee Moon was a bunch of cool singles. And then I'd realise, Christ, [...] is ten minutes long. With two guitar solos." ...|$|E

500|$|Altdorfer was {{not only}} a pioneer of landscape, but also a {{practitioner}} of early incarnations of the Romanticism and expressionism which impacted the arts so greatly in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Kenneth Clark writes of Altdorfer and contemporaries Grünewald and Bosch, [...] "They are what we now call 'expressionist' artists, a term which is not as worthless <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds,</b> because, in fact, the symbols of expressionism are remarkably consistent, and we find in the work of these early 16th-century landscape painters not only the same spirit but the same shapes and iconographical motives which recur in the work of such recent expressionists as van Gogh, Max Ernst, Graham Sutherland and Walt Disney." [...] According to art critic Pia F. Cuneo, [...] "Altdorfer's construction of landscape on a cosmic scale" [...] in the Battle of Alexander at Issus, and his [...] "spiritual and aesthetic affinities with Romanticism and Modern art (in particular, German Expressionism)", [...] "have been especially singled out for praise".|$|E

May, however, regards Bertie as very much of a joke, and {{is in love with}} Jack Mace, who is her ideal of manly beauty. May's father has no objection to Jack personally, but he does not propose that the daughter he idolizes shall wed a weakling or a ne'er do well. Therefore, he tells May in a letter that if 'that young man wants to marry you, he must show his ability by earning his own living during vacation.' Unfortunately for Bertie, he sees the letter, and egotistically jumps to the conclusion that he is the person referred to. He starts out to make his own living, but soon finds that it is not as easy <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds.</b> He is successfully a writer, a billposter, a village constable, and a living target in the baseball show, but fails to shine in any one sphere. And then to cap the climax, when he returns to claim his bride, he finds that May is married to Jack." ...|$|E

Nissim gave the song {{three out of}} five stars and wrote that {{although it is not}} good as Take That's previous singles, [...] "Patience", [...] "Back for Good" [...] and [...] "Pray", [...] "it sounds awfully sweet and, more importantly, absolutely genuine." [...] Sean Egan of BBC Music stated that the single, [...] "is as good <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> on paper, Barlow's sumptuous melodic skills allied to a lyrical prowess we never suspected Williams had in the Take That days as the two engage in a sweetly regretful dialogue with each other about their past feuds." [...] A reviewer for CBBC described it as a [...] "really sweet" [...] and [...] "meaningful" [...] song that has [...] "cheeky" [...] sense of humour and words that can make the listener happy. USA Todays Jerry Shriver noted that [...] "Shame" [...] confirms Williams as a [...] "former boy wonder" [...] who [...] "is in no danger of losing his mojo". Katie Boucher of The National called the single [...] "a bouncy reconciliatory duet" [...] with a sound more similar to Take That, rather than Williams's solo material.|$|E

He further commented that it had strong radio potential, {{and that it would be}} {{successful}} if it were to be released in the United States, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> like a [...] "clone" [...] of [...] "Bleeding Love". Digital Spy critic Lewis Corner felt that the song was reminiscent of [...] "Bleeding Love" [...] as well as [...] "Better in Time". Although he noted that Lewis' vocal performance on [...] "Lovebird" [...] is very impressive, as with all her material, he was unsure of why it was included on the final cut of the album due to Glassheart having [...] "bigger" [...] songs on it, which were likely to chart better. [...] The Mirrors Clemmie Moodie thought that although the recording is a [...] "catchy" [...] song, it does not compare to [...] "Bleeding Love", but noted that it does contain [...] "lyrical gems", including “Your lovebird's flyin’ away, ’cos my heart's been stuck in a cage". Hermoine Hoby, writing on behalf of The Observer, wrote that Lewis appears to be following in the footsteps of singer-songwriter Adele, due to the inclusion of [...] "big heartfelt ballads" [...] such as [...] "Lovebird" [...] and [...] "Fireflies" [...] on Glassheart. For Hoby, Lewis' vocals are just as [...] "technically irreproachable" [...] as Whitney Houston's and Mariah Carey's.|$|E
