Graham, Simonovits <b>and</b> <b>Sós</b> gave the exact value ofN 0. Fork≥ 2, Simonovits <b>and</b> <b>Sós</b> determined the asymptotic behavior ofNk. In this paper we prove a conjecture of Simonovits <b>and</b> <b>Sós</b> concerning the asymptotic value ofN 1. We show thatN 1 =n 22 +O(n 5 / 3 log 3 n). Moreover, we slightly improve the best-known construction, thus disproving their conjecture {{on the exact}} extremal system...|$|R
