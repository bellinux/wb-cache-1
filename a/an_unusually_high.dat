50|$|Hercules-Corona Borealis Great Wall or the Great GRB Wall is {{a massive}} galactic {{superstructure}} in a region of the sky seen in the data set mapping of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) that {{has been found to}} have <b>an</b> <b>unusually</b> <b>higher</b> concentration of similarly distanced GRBs than the expected average distribution. It was discovered in early November 2013 by a team of American and Hungarian astronomers led by István Horváth, Jon Hakkila and Zsolt Bagoly while analyzing data from the Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission, together with other data from ground-based telescopes. It is the largest known formation in the universe, exceeding the size of the prior Huge-LQG by about two times.|$|R

With the assistance of Admiral Smith, Wallin was able to assemble a large salvage force which included submarine rescue ships, special salvage ships, divers, and pontoons to add additional buoyancy for the tug boats when the time came to move Missouri.|$|E

5|$|Early on September9, Luis turned {{towards the}} north and {{weakened}} to a Category2 hurricane, with winds of 110mph (165km/h). Several hours later, the hurricane made its closest approach to Bermuda, passing about 200mi (320km) west of the island. Later that day, the storm began to accelerate as it traveled northeast ahead of a strong trough located to the northwest of Luis. During the afternoon of September10, Hurricane Luis began to undergo an extratropical transition as it rapidly approached the Canadian coastline. Due to the rapid movement of the storm, significant weakening did not occur until Luis was at <b>an</b> <b>unusually</b> <b>high</b> latitude.|$|E

Also, Alberto is the third farthest-travelling in the Atlantic (travelling 6,500miles), only behind Hurricane Faith and Hurricane Carrie, being able to retain tropical characteristics at <b>an</b> <b>unusually</b> <b>high</b> latitude, up to 53˚N. The last storm to do so was Hurricane Frances in 1980.|$|E

40|$|Miranda has <b>a</b> <b>unusually</b> <b>high</b> {{inclination}} (I= 4. 338 ^∘), and {{its surface}} reveals signs of past endogenic activity. Investigations of the dynamical aspects of its orbital evolution suggest probable resonant processes, {{in particular with}} Umbriel, as {{an explanation for the}} present high inclination of Miranda. The tidal heating induced by gravitational interactions can lead to the rise of eccentricities and, consequently, to the increased dissipation of energy inside the satellite and higher internal temperatures. We study here the possible increase in eccentricities caused by orbital resonances and the resulting endogenic heating on Miranda taking into account its temperature dependent rheology. The coupled orbital-thermal evolution model was run with different rheological models and the thermal parameters starting form a cold thermal state, in radiative equilibrium with the environment. For the nominal parameters of the evolution scenarios studied, the resonances were not sufficient to rise neither the eccentricities nor the internal temperatures significantly. Lowest dissipation function Q of around 100 and final eccentricity of e≈ 0. 02 were obtained during the resonance 3 : 1 with Umbriel. Comment: 20 pages, 6 figure...|$|R

Finally, a simple anion-metathesis reaction was conducted to replace the acetate anion with dicyanamide, and the thermal properties of the main-chain polyimidazoliums before and after anion exchange were studied in detail, which demonstrated chain cross-linking by the counterion and <b>a</b> coupled <b>unusually</b> <b>high</b> carbonization yield of up to 66 wt% at 900 oC.

5|$|A {{number of}} student {{deaths in the}} late 1990s and early 2000s {{resulted}} in considerable media attention focussing on MIT's culture and student life. After the alcohol-related death of Scott Krueger in September 1997 as a new member at the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, MIT began requiring all freshmen {{to live in the}} dormitory system. The 2000 suicide of MIT undergraduate Elizabeth Shin drew attention to suicides at MIT and created a controversy over whether MIT had <b>an</b> <b>unusually</b> <b>high</b> suicide rate. In late 2001 a task force's recommended improvements in student mental health services were implemented, including expanding staff and operating hours at the mental health center.

40|$|International audienceAbundant evidences {{have shown}} that ghrelin, by its binding to GHS-R 1 a, plays an {{important}} role for fundamental physiological functions. Increasing attention is given to the GHS-R 1 <b>a</b> <b>unusually</b> <b>high</b> constitutive activity and its contribution to downstream signaling and physiological processes. Here, we review recent lines of evidences showing that the interaction between ligand-binding pocket TM domains and the ECL 2 could be partially responsible for this high constitutive activity. Interestingly, GHSR- 1 a constitutive activity activates in turn the downstream PLC, PKC, and CRE signaling pathways and this activation is reversed by the inverse agonist [D-Arg(1), D-Phe(5), D-Trp(7, 9), Leu(11) ]-substance P (MSP). Noteworthy, GHSR- 1 a exhibits a C-terminal-dependent constitutive internalization. Non-sense GHS-R 1 a mutation (Ala 204 Glu), first discovered in Moroccan patients, supports the role of GHSR- 1 a constitutive activity in physiological impairments. Ala 204 Glu-point mutation, altering exclusively the GHSR- 1 a constitutive activity, was associated with familial short stature syndrome. Altogether, these findings suggest that GHS-R 1 a constitutive activity could contribute to GH secretion or body weight regulation. Consequently, future research on basic and clinical applications of GHS-R 1 a inverse agonists will be challenging and potentially rewarding...|$|R

Because Triceratops teeth, horn fragments, frill fragments, and other skull fragments are such abundant fossils in the Lancian faunal stage of the late Maastrichtian (late Cretaceous, 66mya) Period of western North America, it is regarded as among the dominant herbivores of the time, if not the most dominant herbivore.

The storm later reached hurricane strength and formed a well-defined eye that lasted only 12hours before the eye rapidly lost organization for unknown reasons, though the post-season report on the storm mentions the possibility that its high speed caused the eye to dissipate. The storm moved west-southwestward, weakening before making landfall {{on the island of}} Grenada. The storm lost its circulation and became a tropical wave on August 12.

40|$|Famine {{has been}} a {{recurrent}} problem in human evolutionary history. The onset of famine brings with it a sharp decrease in fertility, while the aftermath reliably includes <b>a</b> period of <b>unusually</b> <b>high</b> fertility. This phenomenon, in conjunction with female preferences for mates slightly older than themselves, eventually yields a population with low (male/female) operational sex ratio. The skewed sex ratio, in turn, leads to increased female intrasexual competition, diminished choosiness, more sexually permissive attitudes, and higher male reproductive success. Therefore, those males born or conceived during <b>a</b> famine have <b>unusually</b> <b>high</b> reproductive value. Parents who are biased either toward the production of male as opposed to female offspring during famine (granting that production of any offspring during a famine is rare) or who show favoritism toward sons born or conceived during a famine will consequently be selectively advantaged compared to parents with no such bias. Historical reports of five famines––Ireland (1845 - 1850), China (1935), Holland (1944 - 1945), Bangladesh (1974 - 1975), and Ethiopia (1984 - 1985) ––provide moderate support for the sex-biased parental investment hypothesis...|$|R
50|$|The {{engines of}} the F103 series were a {{development}} of Daimler-Benz {{for a military}} project that never came into being.
