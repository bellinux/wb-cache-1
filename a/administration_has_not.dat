5|$|The {{project was}} {{presented}} {{as part of the}} original proposal of the Bergen Line when approved by Parliament in 1894, but due to the narrow gauge on the Drammen Line at the time, a temporary solution via Roa was chosen instead. Later proposals have been launched, and parliament has voted over it in 1954, 1978, 1984 and 1992; only the last being passed, but not followed up by funding, and the Norwegian National Rail <b>Administration</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> allocated any date to start construction; detailed plans have however been produced.|$|E
25|$|Oral {{nicotinamide}} {{has been}} promoted as an over-the-counter drug {{for the treatment of}} Alzheimer's dementia. Conversely, no clinically significant effect has been found for the drug, as nicotinamide <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> been found to promote memory functions in patients with mild to moderate dementia of either Alzheimers', vascular, or fronto-temporal types. This evidence suggests that nicotinamide may treat dementia as related to pellegra, but administration does not effectively treat other types of dementia.|$|E
25|$|The Review Commission held {{hearings}} on Guam in December 2003 to take testimony of {{survivors of the}} Japanese occupation concerning their wartime and post-war experiences, and in February 2004 it held a conference in Washington, DC, to hear opinions and insights of legal experts {{on a variety of}} war claims-related issues. These efforts eventually culminated in an 82-page written report, with numerous appendices, which the Review Commission submitted on June 9, 2004, to the Secretary of the Interior, the House Committees on Resources and the Judiciary, and the Senate Committees on Energy and Natural Resources and the Judiciary. As provided by law, the Review Commission then went out of existence on July 10, 2004. It is the FCSC's understanding that the <b>Administration</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> taken a position on any of the findings and recommendations contained in the Review Commission's report.|$|E

25|$|No single {{agency is}} {{responsible}} for all food safety regulations and enforcement in China, and the departments' duties often overlap. There are also local and regional food safety agencies, {{but there is no}} clear hierarchy of agencies at the local or national levels. In response to complexity of numerous agencies monitoring and regulating food safety, the National People's Congress established the State Food and Drug Administration in 2003. The State Food and Drug Administration was supposed to oversee the all aspects of food safety regulations and unify food safety controls. However, the State Food and Drug <b>Administration</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> become the main governing department as the government had intended, and the other national agencies have continued to regulate and monitor food safety. This unclear division of duties has created conflict and confusion when citizens have sought to complain or when a major crisis needed to be resolved.|$|E
25|$|In November 2014 U.S. President Obama {{expanded}} the original role of U.S. Armed Forces in Afghanistan for 2015. Originally {{they were supposed}} to advise, train and assist the Afghan Forces and to hunt the remnants of Al Qaeda. Under the president’s order U.S. forces can carry out missions against the Taliban and other militant groups threatening American troops or the Afghan government while American jets, bombers and drones can support Afghan troops on combat missions. By the end of 2015, half of the 9,800 American troops would leave Afghanistan. The rest would be consolidated in Kabul and Bagram, and then leave by the end of 2016, allowing Obama to say he ended the Afghan war before leaving office. The United States could still have military advisers in Kabul after 2016 who would work out of an office of security cooperation at the United States Embassy. But the Obama <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> said how large that contingent might be and what its exact mission would be.|$|E

[...] But the following month, the NHTSA opened a preliminary evaluation to determine [...] "the potential risks associated with undercarriage strikes on model year 2013 Tesla Model S vehicles". On March 28, 2014, NHTSA closed its investigation, claiming that the new titanium underbody shield and aluminum deflector plates, along with increased ground clearance, [...] "should reduce both the frequency of underbody strikes and the resultant fire risk".|$|E
