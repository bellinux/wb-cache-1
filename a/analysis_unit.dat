500|$|Bundy also {{confided in}} Special Agent William Hagmaier of the FBI Behavioral <b>Analysis</b> <b>Unit.</b> Hagmaier {{was struck by}} the [...] "deep, almost mystical satisfaction" [...] that Bundy took in murder. [...] "He said that after a while, murder is not just a crime of lust or violence", Hagmaier related. [...] "It becomes possession. They are part of you ... becomes a part of you, and you [...] are forever one ... and the grounds where you kill them or leave them become sacred to you, and you will always be drawn back to them." [...] Bundy told Hagmaier that he {{considered}} himself to be an [...] "amateur", an [...] "impulsive" [...] killer in his early years, before moving into what he termed his [...] "prime" [...] or [...] "predator" [...] phase at about the time of Lynda Healy's murder in 1974. This implied that he began killing well before 1974—though he never explicitly admitted doing so.|$|E

2500|$|In February 2003, in {{an effort}} to {{identify}} and direct resources to Indian gaming matters, the FBI and NIGC created the Indian Gaming Work Group (IGWG). The IGWG's purpose is to identify resources needed to address the most pressing criminal violations in the area of Indian gaming. This group consists of representatives from a variety of FBI subprograms (i.e. Economic Crimes Unit, Money Laundering Unit, LCN/Organized Crime Unit, Asian Organized Crime Unit, Public Corruption/Government Fraud Unit, Cryptographic Racketeering <b>Analysis</b> <b>Unit,</b> and Indian Country Special Jurisdiction Unit) and other federal agencies, which include Department of Interior Office of Inspector General (DOI-OIG), NIGC, Internal Revenue Service Tribal Government Section (IRS-TGS), Department of Treasure Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FINCEN), Department of Justice (DOJ), Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), US Department of the Treasury, and Bureau of Indian Affairs Office of Law Enforcement Services (BIA-OLES). The IGWG meets monthly to review Indian gaming cases deemed to {{have a significant impact on}} the Indian gaming industry. As a result of these meetings, several investigations have been initiated. [...] The IGWG through its member agencies has provided financial resources, travel funds, liaison assistance, personnel resources, coordination assistance and consultation.|$|E
