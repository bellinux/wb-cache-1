5|$|The Leaf's {{electric}} warning sound had to {{be removed}} for cars delivered in the U.K., as the country's law mandates that any hazard warning sound must be capable of being disabled between 11:00 pm and 6:00 am, and the Leaf's audible warning system does not allow for such temporary deactivation. For the 2014 UK model of the car, the VSP system is enabled by default, though <b>a</b> <b>button</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> dash permits drivers to disable the system until the next time the car is switched on.|$|E
5|$|The game is {{displayed}} on a black-and-white television screen, and the tanks are controlled by two joysticks each. Pushing both joysticks moves the player's tank forward, and pulling them both back causes the tank to stop. Pulling them in different directions or amounts causes the tank to turn in place or while moving, respectively. <b>A</b> <b>button</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> top of the right joystick fires a shell.|$|E
5|$|The 2011 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid is {{the first}} mass {{production}} car manufactured by Hyundai to include the warning sound system. In 2010 the carmaker decided to have <b>a</b> <b>button</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Sonata Hybrid's instrument panel to turn the VESS on and off, but after {{the enactment of the}} Pedestrian Safety Enhancement Act of 2010, signed into law by President Obama in early 2011, and learning that the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration would not allow such switches to avoid the noise device to be turned off, Hyundai decided not to install the button, and the first Sonata Hybrids destined for the U.S. market had to be altered to remove the switch.|$|E

5|$|The rapid {{introduction}} of new types of radars working on different frequencies meant the IFF system had to respond to an ever-increasing list of signals, and the direct response of the Mk. II required an ever-increasing number of sub-models, each turned to different frequencies. By 1941 {{it was clear that}} this was going to grow without bound, and a new solution was needed. The result was a new series of IFF units which used the indirect interrogation technique. These operated on a fixed frequency, different from the radar. The interrogation signal was sent from the aircraft by pressing <b>a</b> <b>button</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> radar, which caused the signal to be sent out in pulses synchronized to the radar's main signal. The received signal was amplified and mixed into the same video signal as the radar, causing the same extended blip to appear.|$|E
25|$|Some {{models have}} a hush or {{temporary}} silence feature that allows silencing, typically by pressing <b>a</b> <b>button</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> housing, without removing the battery. This is especially useful in locations where false alarms can be relatively common (e.g. near a kitchen), or users might remove the battery permanently {{to avoid the}} annoyance of false alarms, preventing the alarm from detecting a fire should one break out.|$|E
25|$|An épitoge (epitoga): A {{piece of}} cloth with white fur stripes (three for doctors) {{attached}} by <b>a</b> <b>button</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left shoulder, with a rectangular, long, thin tail {{in the front and}} a triangular, shorter, broad tail in the back (both tails carry the fur stripes); its colour is that of the relevant academic field. The epitoga has evolved from the academic hood, which explains why the French academic dress does not include a hood.|$|E

25|$|Another {{option to}} share music files is to burn CDs. To do this the user needs {{to create a}} {{playlist}} with the songs the user wishes to share. If the playlist exceeds roughly twenty songs it is likely {{they will need to}} make multiple CDs. By inserting a disk into the disk drive <b>a</b> <b>button</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bottom of the window should give the option to burn a disk. The files are automatically downloaded to the disk and may be uploaded onto another computer or saved as a backup for the user’s computer.|$|E
25|$|Al-Alamiah {{produced}} {{other common}} models, including AX100, AX123, AX150, AX170, AH200, AX200, AX230, AX235, AX250, AX330, AX350-I, AX350-II, AX355, AX370, AX500, AX550, AX660, and AX990. The only MSX console with a Famicom game {{slot in the}} MSX computer is AX330. The user can switch between MSX and Famicom modes by pressing <b>a</b> <b>button</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> back of the computer. The other variants, which are compatible with the Sega Mega Drive, are the AX660 and AX990. Sega Master System Pal cartridges are playable with AX660, and AX990 if together the TV Game Computer Cartridge Converter and Master System Converter are attached {{at the same time}} to the MSX AX660 or AX990 consoles, connecting the Sega Master System cartridge to the game inlet in the computer. Attaching only the Master System Converter to play Sega Master Cartridges on the AX660, or AX990 is not possible because of the inlet depth and the physical shape of the Master System Converter that prevent the converter from being attached correctly to the AX660 and AX990 computers.|$|E
25|$|Within most scenes, {{the player}} {{can control the}} main {{character}} by moving them around the environment; they can also hold down a button to see what thoughts are going through the character's mind, and trigger them to hear an internal monologue on that thought. When the player is near an object or another character they can interact with, they will be presented with a context sensitive icon that represents what control they need to do. These controls include pressing <b>a</b> <b>button</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> DualShock controller, moving the analogue sticks in a specific manner, or rotating the motion-sensitive controller in a specific way; in the version with PlayStation Move support, further actions based on the Move controllers are also present. These actions may lead to additional actions to fully complete the interaction. Some scenes impose a timer on the player, requiring them to complete the necessary actions in time to avoid the death or incapacitation of that character. In other scenes, the player does not have full control of the character but must instead be prepared to respond to these icons {{in the manner of}} quick time events, such as during a hand-to-hand fight or while driving frantically {{on the wrong side of}} the road.|$|E

500|$|Sinclair {{took the}} view that an {{electric}} vehicle needed to be designed from the ground up, completely rethinking the principles of automotive design rather than simply dropping electric components into an established model. He believed that the motor {{was the key to}} the design. Sinclair and Curry developed a wafer-thin motor that was mounted on a child's scooter, with <b>a</b> <b>button</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> handlebars to activate it. The research got no further, however, as Sinclair's development of the first [...] "slimline" [...] pocket calculator – the Sinclair Executive and its successors – took precedence. No further work on electric vehicles took place for {{most of the rest of}} the 1970s.|$|E
500|$|During missions, players {{navigate}} {{a series}} of linear linked areas fighting off multiple enemies. Items can be picked up during missions, such as grenades and medical kits. Aya has access to multiple guns for use in combat, including handguns, assault rifles and shotguns. By holding down <b>a</b> <b>button</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> controller, Aya automatically aims at an enemy and can fire at will. Taking cover behind objects or shields, or standing idle outside of battle, allows Aya to regenerate health. While in combat, an energy meter is charged and can be activated when full. When activated, Aya entered [...] "Liberation Mode", a state enabling her to move around the battlefield at high speed {{for a short period}} of time.|$|E
500|$|Cyber Danganronpa VR is {{a virtual}} reality game in which the player plays through the fourth [...] "class trial" [...] from the {{adventure}} game , where the player aims to uncover who was behind the murder of Sakura Ogami; unlike the original game, which uses 2D cutouts for characters, Cyber Danganronpa VR uses 3D models. The player character's classmates give testimonies, which appear as words; if the player notices something in the testimony that seems suspicious, they can refute the words by shooting them with [...] "truth bullets". To do this, the player needs to turn their head toward the character who testified, and press <b>a</b> <b>button</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> DualShock 4 controller. The game takes around ten minutes to play through, and ends with a first-person sequence where the character Monokuma punishes the player.|$|E
50|$|The {{theme of}} the blog has become an Internet meme. On occasion, some {{businesses}} will correct their signs after being featured <b>on</b> <b>the</b> blog.

50|$|Another {{difference}} of the M1C was the chinstraps (this was seen <b>on</b> <b>the</b> M2). <b>The</b> chinstraps found <b>on</b> <b>the</b> M2 and M1C both had <b>a</b> <b>button</b> snap <b>on</b> <b>the</b> end {{so as to}} be fastened to the liner.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to having <b>a</b> reset <b>button</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> front of the computer, the Explorer 85 had <b>an</b> interrupt <b>button.</b> This allow the user to interrupt a locked up program {{and return to the}} debugger, without resetting the computer and losing all of their work.|$|R
500|$|The {{gameplay}} of Spacewar involves two monochrome spaceships called [...] "the needle" [...] and [...] "the wedge", each {{controlled by}} a player, attempting to shoot one another while maneuvering on a two-dimensional plane in the gravity well of a star, set {{against the backdrop of}} a starfield. The ships fire torpedoes which are not affected by the gravitational pull of the star. The ships have a limited number of torpedoes and a limited supply of fuel, which is used when the player fires his thrusters. Torpedoes are fired one at a time by flipping a toggle switch on the computer or pressing <b>a</b> <b>button</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> control pad, and there is a cooldown period between launches. [...] The ships follow Newtonian physics, remaining in motion even when the player is not accelerating, though the ships can rotate at a constant rate without inertia.|$|E
500|$|The Simpsons creator Matt Groening made a minor cameo in the episode, {{though his}} {{appearance}} is {{not mentioned in}} the closing credits. In the episode, a robot examines the health of Maggie's fetus. Maggie's band is present, and one of the band members presses <b>a</b> <b>button</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> robot's [...] "face", which is a screen showing its facial expressions, and a soccer game comes on instead. A sports commentator, voiced by Groening, gives a long [...] "goal!" [...] shout that is heard over the game. According to The Simpsons music editor Chris Ledesma, as the episode was being recorded, [...] "there were only sounds of crowd cheering during that shot and Matt said we needed to spice it up somehow." [...] After going through some different ideas, the staff settled on a commentator shouting [...] "goal!". The staff members wanted Groening to provide the voice and he finished the recording in two takes.|$|E
500|$|The player {{controls}} a rapid-fire main cannon, {{which can}} either be upgraded or changed to other types of weapons by collecting various numbered power-ups and purple orbs called [...] "gel capsules." [...] Players can collect optional power-ups to help fight through the game such as [...] "multibodies" [...] that shadow their actions, homing missiles, shields, and enhanced firing capabilities known as [...] "full fire". The player carries a limited supply of [...] "cluster bombs" [...] that can be deployed, destroying large quantities of enemies and bosses within the player's vicinity. Players have the function of selecting {{the speed of the}}ir ship, which can be toggled by pressing <b>a</b> <b>button</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> gamepad, among five different speeds (the button cycles between them in order). The number of triangles that appear below the player's score designate the speed of the player's ship. This allows players to customize the behavior of their ship at any time, trading off freedom of movement against ease of control: a faster ship is more agile, while a slower ship can be maneuvered more precisely.|$|E
50|$|By design, some alarms will bypass {{some or all}} of the inputs at times. Other alarms can bypass some {{of their}} inputs via <b>a</b> <b>button</b> {{combination}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> remote, or when remote starting (if the alarm supports this feature).|$|R

500|$|In {{alignment}} with {{the expansion of}} the console series to include drums and vocal parts in Guitar Hero World Tour, Guitar Hero World Tour Mobile adds in the option to play the drum track for all of the included songs in addition to lead guitar. While drums are played similarly to guitar, the game also includes the bass drum kick, marked as a horizontal line across the on-screen fretboard, requiring the player to hit <b>a</b> <b>button</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> phone's keypad below the row they are using for normal drum hits. The game, when played on advanced phones that recognize simultaneous keypresses, support the playing of chords on guitar or simultaneous drum hits. Guitar Hero World Tour Mobile also supports a two-player competitive mode {{in a manner similar to}} the [...] "boss battles" [...] introduced in a player may be able to collect power-ups that can be triggered in the same manner as Star Power to affect their opponent's ability to play for a brief period of time. No major gameplay additions were made for Guitar Hero 5.|$|E
500|$|The guitar {{interface}} remains relatively unchanged in World Tour. [...] As {{with previous}} Guitar Hero titles, the guitar and bass player must {{hold down the}} correct fret button(s) on the controller while strumming {{in time with the}} notes as they scroll on-screen. One addition to the guitar gameplay is the ability to play notes while holding a sustained note. [...] Additionally, the bass guitar player is required to play notes representing an open E string, which is shown on-screen as a solid line across their note track. [...] To play these notes, the bass guitar player strums the controller without pressing any fret button keys. The drum interface is similar to the guitar's interface, with each on-screen note track equivalent to a colored drum head on the controller, with the bass drum indicated by a line across the note track. [...] The drum player only needs to hit the correct drum pads simultaneously to the note gems to successfully play their track. There are also marked sections indicating drum fills wherein the player may play any notes they wish in a 'solo' to gain points. The vocal track requires the player to match the pitch of the notes {{in a manner similar to}} Karaoke Revolution to be successful. Special sections of each player's note track are marked with glowing notes, which, if completed successfully, builds up Star Power. Once enough Star Power is accumulated, it can be released via various means to double the band's current score multiplier. For guitar and bass, this is done by lifting the guitar controller vertically or (though not in bass) by pressing <b>a</b> <b>button</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> guitar face; for drums, by striking both cymbal pads on the controller at the same time; for vocals, by tapping the microphone or making a similarly quick sound. Star Power's use has been modified over previous Guitar Hero entries in that Star Power can now be accumulated even when Star Power is in use by successfully completing additional Star Power phrases, which extends the Star Power's duration.|$|E
2500|$|Pressing <b>a</b> <b>button</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rear of {{the reel}} {{disengages}} the line pickup, and the button is then released during the forward cast to allow the line to fly off the spool. The button is pressed again to stop the lure at the position desired. [...] Upon cranking the handle, the pickup pin immediately re-engages the line and spools it onto the reel.|$|E
