5|$|In a {{retrospective}} review, the J-Man of Just Games Retro said {{the game is}} overly slow, as the player must produce <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>basic</b> buildings and peasants in order to gather resources, and then start building combat units, while the enemy starts with more buildings {{and the ability to}} immediately send out offensive units to undo the player's efforts. He also criticized that the basic units of the two sides are essentially identical and that the interface is clunky, but praised the resource system and effective enemy AI.|$|E
5|$|Kiedis {{knew that}} the band's sound would inevitably change when Navarro joined. In June 1994, the band entered The Sound Factory, a {{recording}} studio in Los Angeles, to record the album. The band completed <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>basic</b> tracks, when Kiedis began having difficulty singing. He had been through a dental procedure in which an addictive sedative, Valium, was used; this caused him to relapse, and he once again became dependent on drugs. Kiedis had slipped from five years of sobriety and began reusing narcotics he'd sworn never to use again. The band took a short break from recording to perform at Woodstock '94, {{which was the first}} show Navarro played with the Red Hot Chili Peppers.|$|E

5|$|Metabolism {{involves}} {{a vast array}} of chemical reactions, but most fall under <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>basic</b> types of reactions that involve the transfer of functional groups of atoms and their bonds within molecules. This common chemistry allows cells to use a small set of metabolic intermediates to carry chemical groups between different reactions. These group-transfer intermediates are called coenzymes. Each class of group-transfer reactions is carried out by a particular coenzyme, which is the substrate for a set of enzymes that produce it, and a set of enzymes that consume it. These coenzymes are therefore continuously made, consumed and then recycled.|$|E
5|$|Deir al-Balah was {{captured}} by the British Army following the surrender of Khan Yunis on 28 February 1917. By April an aerodrome and an army camp were established there and Deir al-Balah became a launching point for British forces against Ottoman-held Gaza and Beersheba {{to the north and}} northeast, respectively. Of the 25 British war cemeteries dating from World War I, one of the six largest was built in Deir al-Balah in March 1917. It continued to be used until March 1918 and contains a total of 724 graves. Deir al-Balah became a part of the British Mandate of Palestine starting in 1922. A municipal council to administer the town was established by the British authorities in 1946, but it had limited jurisdiction over civil affairs and provided <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>basic</b> services.|$|E

25|$|Compared to {{estimating}} performance {{which is}} very cost effective (thus useful in design), testing, while costly, {{is still the most}} precise method. Further, testing centrifugal compressor performance is very complex. Professional societies such as ASME (i.e. PTC–10, Fluid Meters Handbook, PTC-19.x), ASHRAE (ASHRAE Handbook) and API (ANSI/API 617-2002, 672-2007) have established standards for detailed experimental methods and analysis of test results.

Owing to the smaller lots employed in modern developments (especially in the Western US), Tudor Revival may be placed directly next to an unrelated style such as French or Italian Provincial, resulting in an eclectic mix.|$|E
25|$|Observing that {{philosophers}} often seek {{to deduce}} their total view from <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>basic</b> principles, showing how everything follows from their intuitively based axioms, Nozick compares {{such an approach}} to building a tower by piling one brick on top of another: if the brick at the bottom crumbles or is removed, everything collapses, and even the insights that were independent of the starting point are lost. He suggests instead that the Parthenon should be the model for philosophy, and advocates an explanatory model of philosophical activity rather than an argumentative or coercive one.|$|E

Admitted to the Dutch Reformed Church and married by its ministers, their children could be baptized. Slaves could testify in court, sign legal documents, and bring civil actions against whites. Some were permitted to work after hours earning wages equal to those paid to white workers. When the colony fell, the company freed the first slaves and some others, establishing early on a nucleus of free negros.|$|E

25|$|When {{the service}} {{initially}} launched with Diablo in November 30, 1996, Battle.net offered only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>basic</b> services like chatting and game listings. Players could {{connect to the}} service, talk with other gamers and join multiplayer games of Diablo. Besides user account data, no game data was stored on the Battle.net servers. When a player connected to a game, they would be connecting directly to the other players in the game. No data was sent through the Battle.net servers. While this made the service quick and easy to use, it quickly led to widespread cheating since players using cheats could modify their game data locally. However, since there was an option to create private games, many players ended up playing with people they knew.|$|E
25|$|Structuralism {{rejected}} {{the concept of}} human freedom and choice and focused instead on the way that human experience and thus, behaviour, is determined by various structures. The most important initial work on this score was Claude Lévi-Strauss's 1949 volume The Elementary Structures of Kinship. Lévi-Strauss had known Jakobson during their time together at the New School in New York during WWII and was influenced by both Jakobson's structuralism {{as well as the}} American anthropological tradition. In Elementary Structures he examined kinship systems from a structural point of view and demonstrated how apparently different social organizations were in fact different permutations of <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>basic</b> kinship structures. In the late 1950s he published Structural Anthropology, a collection of essays outlining his program for structuralism.|$|E
25|$|Every {{version of}} Microsoft Windows for {{personal}} computers has included a command line interpreter (CLI) {{for managing the}} operating system.

They also include a basic scripting language (batch files), {{which can be used}} to automate various tasks. However, they cannot be used to automate all facets of graphical user interface (GUI) functionality, in part because command-line equivalents of operations are limited, and the scripting language is elementary. In Windows Server 2003, the situation was improved, but scripting support was still unsatisfactory.|$|E

25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, each taekwondo {{club and}} school is different therefore {{there is not}} single way to teach taekwondo. However, there are <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>basic</b> training techniques that can help students achieve certain skills in tae kwon do. Forms are usually practiced through repetition. Learning {{one half of the}} form and then {{moving on to the next}} half is the technique that is most often used. Then of course, even after students complete the form, it is necessary to critique them on the specifics. Students should master all of the stances in the current form before moving on to the next form. Chambering should be emphasized and it is helpful to explain why chambering is necessary and how each initial position helps execute force. For kicking, teaching snapping is extremely important for learning how to do proper kicks. Students typically line up against a wall or something they can place their hand on for balance, lift their knee up, and repeatedly practicing bending the leg in and snapping it out. This helps students gain the necessary muscles to have stronger, clean, and more accurate kicks. This general strategy can also be used for different kicks. Students can lean against the wall, lift their legs up close to their belly button and repeatedly shoot their leg out to practice side kick or they can shift the angle of their hips downwards and repeat the same thing to practice back kick. This type of practice is about building the muscle and carefully practicing the proper technique. By using targets, students can practice the accuracy of their kicks as well as transitioning from one kick to the other. You can either do target training to practice one kick over and over and carefully critique it so to get the proper technique or you can do a combination of kicks to improve balance and transitioning. It is also important to practice agility and endurance.|$|E
