40|$|Systematic {{surgical}} staging is {{the primary}} treatment, for most patients with endometrial cancer and includes: total hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy and complete resection of all disease. Especially in patients with type II endometrial cancer, systematic surgical staging includes additional omentectomy, appendectomy and biopsy of any suspected lesion. Although pelvic washings are no longer part of FIGO surgical staging system for endometrial cancer, they should be reported separately. Especially in endometrial cancer patients with increased risk for recurrence or <b>at</b> <b>advanced</b> <b>stage</b> disease, it is necessary a more aggressive treatment approach with postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy. Postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy in endometrial cancer patients includes vaginal brachytherapy and external radiotherapy. Vaginal brachytherapy is the adjuvant treatment of choice for intermediate risk endometrial cancer patients. External pelvic radiotherapy is the adjuvant treatment of choice only in high risk endometrial cancer patients. Postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy has very important role for endometrial cancer patients with advanced stage disease. The combination of adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy is promising in high risk endometrial cancer patients or in endometrial cancer patients <b>at</b> <b>advanced</b> <b>stage</b> disease. Molecular targeted therapies have only modest effect in unselected endometrial cancer patients. Especially the role of ErbBtargeted therapies in selected EC patients, should be further investigated...|$|E

40|$|Pancreatic {{cancer is}} a highly {{aggressive}} and notoriously difficult to treat.

Although gemcitabine-based chemotherapy is typically offered as standard of care, most patients do not survive longer than 6 months. Thus, new therapeutic approaches are needed. Pancreatic cancer cells that develop gemcitabine resistance would still be suitable targets for immunotherapy. Therefore, one promising treatment approach may be immunotherapy that is designed to target pancreatic-cancer-associated antigens. In this paper, we detail recent work in immunotherapy and the advances in concept of combination therapy of immunotherapy and chemotherapy.

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} the immunological repertoire in the peritoneal cavity of gastric cancer patients. METHODS: The peritoneal cavity is a compartment in which immunological host-tumor interactions can occur. However, {{the role of}} lymphocytes in the peritoneal cavity of gastric cancer patients is unclear. We observed 64 patients who underwent gastrectomy for gastric cancer and 11 patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy for gallstones and acted as controls. Lymphocytes isolated from both peripheral blood and peritoneal lavage were analyzed for surface markers of lymphocytes and their cytokine production by flow cytometry. CD 4 +CD 25 high T cells isolated from the patient&#x 2019;s peripheral blood were co-cultivated for 4 d with the intra-peritoneal lymphocytes, and a cytokine assay was performed. RESULTS: At gastrectomy, CCR 7 - CD 45 RA- CD 8 + effector memory T cells were observed in the peritoneal cavity. The frequency of CD 4 + CD 25 high T cells in both the peripheral blood and peritoneal cavity was elevated in patients <b>at</b> <b>advanced</b> <b>stage</b> [control vs stage IV in the peripheral blood: 6. 89 (3. 39 - 10. 4) vs 15. 34 (11. 37 - 19. 31), P < 0. 05, control vs stage IV in the peritoneal cavity: 8. 65 (5. 28 - 12. 0) vs 19. 56 (14. 81 - 24. 32), P < 0. 05]. On the other hand, the suppression was restored with CD 4 + CD 25 high T cells from their own peripheral blood. This study {{is the first to}} analyze lymphocyte and cytokine production in the peritoneal cavity in patients with gastric cancer. Immune regulation <b>at</b> <b>advanced</b> <b>stage</b> is reversible at the point of gastrectomy. CONCLUSION: The immunological milieu in the peritoneal cavity of patients with advanced gastric cancer elicited a Th 2 response even at gastrectomy, but this response was reversible...|$|E
