25|$|The {{ship was}} {{equipped}} with her own waterworks, capable of heating and pumping water to {{all parts of the}} vessel via a complex network of pipes and valves. The main water supply was taken aboard while Titanic was in port, but in an emergency the ship could also distil fresh water from seawater, though this was not a straightforward process as the distillation plant quickly became clogged by salt deposits. A network of insulated ducts conveyed warm <b>air,</b> <b>driven</b> by electric fans, around the ship, and First Class cabins were fitted with additional electric heaters.|$|E
500|$|The first {{engineering}} work {{to take place}} was a compressed <b>air</b> <b>driven</b> pilot tunnel, which was drilled between 1936 and 1938. Work on the tunnel was delayed due to World War II, and resumed in 1959, using a Greathead Shield, similar to {{the work on the}} Blackwall Tunnel some 60 years earlier. The delay in work due to the war allowed the tunnel's design to be improved, which included a better ventilation system. After negotiations with the Ministry of Transport, Kent and Essex County Councils obtained government approval to charge tolls in 1960, before opening. The two-lane bore tunnel opened to traffic on 18 November 1963; the total project cost was £13 million (£ million as of [...] ) and it initially served approximately 12,000 vehicles per day.|$|E

500|$|Subcutaneous {{emphysema}} is {{a common}} result of certain types of surgery; for example {{it is not unusual}} in chest surgery. [...] It may also occur from surgery around the esophagus, and is particularly likely in prolonged surgery. Other potential causes are positive pressure ventilation for any reason and by any technique, in which its occurrence is frequently unexpected. It may also occur as a result of oral surgery, laparoscopy, and cricothyrotomy. [...] In a pneumonectomy, in which an entire lung is removed, the remaining bronchial stump may leak air, a rare but very serious condition that leads to progressive subcutaneous emphysema. Air can leak out of the pleural space through an incision made for a thoracotomy to cause subcutaneous emphysema. [...] On infrequent occasions, the condition can result from dental surgery, usually due to use of high-speed tools that are <b>air</b> <b>driven.</b> [...] These cases result in usually painless swelling of the face and neck, with an immediate onset, the crepitus (crunching sound) typical of subcutaneous emphysema, and often with subcutaneous air visible on X-ray.|$|E

A torpedo-boat caught {{in one of the}} returning gales was hurled forward almost on her beam ends until she was under the edge of one of the vast masses of descending water. The flood which, from even the outer limits of this falling-sea, poured upon and into the unlucky vessel nearly swamped her, and when she was swept back by the rushing waves into less stormy waters, her officers and crew leaped into their boats and deserted her. By rare good-fortune their boats were kept afloat in the turbulent sea until they reached the nearest torpedo-vessel.|$|E

50|$|In 1953 {{a project}} for the {{engineering}} company and bolt manufacturer GKN took the North Bar Tool Company in a new product direction. GKN had designed a bolt called 'Prolong' that had a splined section above the nut. By gripping the splined section of the bolt and counter rotating the nut, the fastener could be tightened {{without the need for}} any external reaction device. In a further development, a shear groove was placed below the spline, so designed that the bolt would fail at the groove when the pre-determined torque had been achieved. This bolting method was known as 'Torshear'. GKN required an <b>air</b> <b>driven</b> tool capable of high torque output to sell with their 'Prolong' bolts. Probably Britain's best known gearbox designer of the time was Dr. Henry Edward Merritt and so Dr. Merritt was contracted to design a suitable range of <b>air</b> <b>driven</b> gearboxes for the Torshear application.|$|E
50|$|The Torshear bolting {{method was}} not a {{commercial}} success so 'North Bar' added reaction arms to their gearboxes and called them 'Pneutorque' {{in the case of}} the <b>air</b> <b>driven</b> versions and the hand operated versions were named 'Handtorque'. Evolutions of these products still form part of the company's range today. Dr. Merritt's book 'Gears' remains a reference for gearbox designers.|$|E

30|$|Reducing the {{concentration}} of carbon dioxide (CO 2) in the air can effectively alleviate climate change. Air capture, which captures CO 2 directly from the air in an industrial process, is an alternative option to address climate change. The results of recent studies on the energy demand in CO 2 capture process {{and the costs of}} CO 2 transport and CO 2 storage in air capture are analyzed in this paper. Considering renewable energy will not produce additional CO 2 in the process of utilization, the electric energy in CO 2 capture process of <b>air</b> capture <b>driven</b> by wind energy is different from that of carbon capture and storage. Taking externalities of renewable energy into account, the trading price of CO 2 emission is taken to assess the cost of electric energy in CO 2 capture of <b>air</b> capture <b>driven</b> by wind energy. Finally, the total cost and the total cost savings of <b>air</b> capture <b>driven</b> by wind energy under different scenarios are analyzed.|$|R

Researchers recognise challenges in applying the temperature-gradient theory to global circulation. For example, the ascent of warm <b>air</b> <b>drives</b> the process, but as this air rises, other air must descend (the system circulates). But as air descends it warms and thus gains buoyancy resisting this circulation. Estimates of heat loss imply that this resistance should prevent circulation (Goody 2003).
