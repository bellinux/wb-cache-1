5|$|There are {{two main}} game modes in Day of Defeat: Source: {{territorial}} control and detonation. In territorial control maps, players must fight for control of all strategic points on the map. The strategic points take various forms, such as a destroyed tank in a street or fields and buildings, and are designated by a flag in its vicinity, which displays the army colors of the team who controls the point. Points are captured by {{a certain number of}} team members surrounding the point, with it either capturing instantly or after <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>seconds.</b> Players on the other side can disrupt a capture by placing themselves within the capture area during the process or by killing the enemy players at the point. The first side to hold all the points simultaneously wins the round.|$|E
5|$|Vocalisations are {{frequent}} as the juveniles disperse, {{and again as}} they congregate in the morning. Nearby adults, presumably the parents, also give signals warning of predators or alerting the youngsters {{to the presence of}} food. The range and quantity of vocalisations vary between species. Alligators are the noisiest, while some crocodile species are almost completely silent. Adult female New Guinea crocodiles and Siamese crocodiles roar when approached by another adult, while Nile crocodiles grunt or bellow in a similar situation. The American alligator is exceptionally noisy; it emits a series of about seven throaty bellows, each <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>seconds</b> long, at ten second intervals. It also makes various grunts and hisses. Males create vibrations in the water to send out infrasonic signals that serve to attract females and intimidate rivals. The enlarged boss of the male gharial may serve as a sound resonator.|$|E
5|$|Strong {{performances}} {{continued to}} follow in the 2011–12 season, with the club beginning the following season in commanding form, including beating Tottenham 5–1 at White Hart Lane and humbling Manchester United by a 6–1 scoreline in United's own stadium. Although the strong form waned halfway through the season, and City at one point fell eight points behind their arch rivals with only six games left to play, a slump by United allowed the blue side of Manchester to draw back level with two games to go, setting up a thrilling finale to the season with both teams going into the last day equal on points. Despite City only needing a home win against a team in the relegation zone, they fell a goal behind by the end of normal time, leading some of United's players to finish their game celebrating in the belief that they had won the league. Two goals in injury time – including one scored almost five minutes after normal time had elapsed – resulted in an almost-literal last-minute title victory, City's first in 44 years, and became only the fifth team to win the Premier League since its creation in 1992. In the aftermath that followed, the event was described by media sources from the UK and around the world as the greatest moment in Premier League history. The game was also notable for former player Joey Barton's sending off, where he committed three separate red card-able incidents on three different players in the space of only <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>seconds,</b> resulting in a 12-match ban.|$|E

The trap door leads to a narrow earthen pathway about 100 metres long with high guard rails, open at the other end. When a judge gives a signal, the calf is set loose and starts running. <b>A</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>seconds</b> later, the riders are released and they race to grab the calf by its tail.

25|$|The {{change in}} the MR signal from {{neuronal}} activity is called the hemodynamic response (HDR). It lags the neuronal events triggering it by <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>seconds,</b> since {{it takes a while}} for the vascular system to respond to the brain's need for glucose. From this point it typically rises to a peak at about 5seconds after the stimulus. If the neurons keep firing, say from a continuous stimulus, the peak spreads to a flat plateau while the neurons stay active. After activity stops, the BOLD signal falls below the original level, the baseline, a phenomenon called the undershoot. Over time the signal recovers to the baseline. There is some evidence that continuous metabolic requirements in a brain region contribute to the undershoot.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} {{the feasibility of}} a new circuit for the conversion of binary phase-shift keying signals into amplitude-shift keying signals. In its simplest form, the converter circuit is composed by a power divider, <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>second</b> harmonic injection-locked oscillators, and a power combiner. The operation of the converter circuit relies on the frequency synchronization of both oscillators and the generation of an interference pattern by combining their outputs, which reproduces the original phase modulation. Two prototypes of the converter have been implemented. The first one is a hybrid version working in the 400 - 530 -MHz frequency range. The second one has been implemented using multichip-module technology, and is intended {{to work in the}} 1. 8 - 2. 2 -GHz frequency range...|$|R

There are several second order models but most are for explaining traffic flow. Only <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>second</b> order models were {{developed for}} traffic control purpose. The most popular one is the Payne-Papageorgiou model. Due to point sensor detection limit in highways such as inductive loops, flow estimation is easy and reasonably accurate while density estimation is very difficult. This is the motivation for us {{to have a look at}} flow dynamics in place of density. It turns out that flow dynamics of first order cannot be well-defined contrasted to the Cell Transmission Model. However, a flow-speed dynamics can be obtained which is equivalent to the density-speed dynamics of the Payne-Papageorgiou model...|$|R

However, when the findings were detailed, we observed that they did not match completely any of the syndromes in a discernable way. The MECP 2 gene mutation was analysed because of mental retardation, poor neurological evolution and large ears, but no mutation was found.
