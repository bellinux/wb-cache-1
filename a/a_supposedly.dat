5|$|Moravec's paradox: Proving theorems {{and solving}} {{geometry}} problems is comparatively easy for computers, but <b>a</b> <b>supposedly</b> simple task like recognizing a face or crossing a room without bumping into anything is extremely difficult. This {{helps explain why}} research into vision and robotics had made so little progress by the middle 1970s.|$|E
5|$|After {{weeks of}} exchanging taunts and each side {{predicting}} victory for their side, {{the two teams}} faced off at SummerSlam. Jesse Ventura had been appointed as <b>a</b> <b>supposedly</b> impartial guest referee by Jack Tunney. It was strongly hinted leading up the event that Ventura, who provided commentary for many WWF events and was a strong critic of Hulk Hogan but yet was a supporter of Randy Savage even (if only to a somewhat lesser extent) during his face days, had been paid an undisclosed amount by DiBiase.|$|E
5|$|In this episode, Q (John de Lancie) allows <b>a</b> <b>supposedly</b> {{deceased}} Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) to re-visit {{a pivotal}} event {{in his youth}} that he since regrets. Picard changes the past, but upon returning to the present he finds that it made him the man he became. He returns once more {{to the past and}} returns it to the way it originally took place. Picard wakes up in the present, unsure if the events took place or if it was {{as a result of his}} injury.|$|E

5|$|The police arrest Nick, Dale and Kurt, but the navigation-system operator, Gregory, {{reveals that}} it is his company's policy to record all conversations for quality assurance. Gregory plays the tape that has Harken confessing he murdered Pellitt. Harken is sentenced to 25 years to life in prison, while the friends get their charges waived. Nick is {{promoted}} to {{president of the company}} under a sadistic CEO, Kurt retains his job under a new boss, and Dale blackmails Julia into ending her harassment by convincing her to sexually harass <b>a</b> <b>supposedly</b> unconscious patient, while Jones secretly records the act.|$|E
5|$|Jeffrey Jowell proposes two {{justifications}} for limiting parliamentary sovereignty: legitimacy {{and the current}} hypothesis of constitutionalism. The argument from legitimacy highlights that Parliament's supremacy depends on the democratic and accountable nature of legislature; anything that undermines this status would invalidate {{the applicability of the}} doctrine. Jowell suggests that this view was expressly supported by Lord Hope and impliedly supported in other opinions that legislation limiting Parliament's accountability would be challenged by the judiciary. The argument based on the current hypothesis of constitutionalism reasons that no authority should be allowed to violate fundamental rights in a democratic society: they are essential features that cannot be removed, even by <b>a</b> <b>supposedly</b> sovereign Parliament. This view was also expressly endorsed in Jackson by Lord Hope, who regarded Parliament's sovereignty as subject to the rule of law.|$|E
5|$|Most of them {{unscrewed}} at {{once and}} 530kilograms (1170lb) of rope were lost, while the three explorers could simultaneously be seen to dump 210kilograms of sand overboard to get the basket clear of the water. Seven hundred and forty kilograms (1630lb) of essential weight was thus lost {{in the first few}} minutes. Before it was well clear of the launch site, the Eagle had turned from <b>a</b> <b>supposedly</b> steerable craft into an ordinary hydrogen balloon with a few ropes hanging from it, {{at the mercy of the}} wind; its crew had no means to direct it to any particular goal and had too little ballast for stability. Lightened, the balloon rose to 700meters (2300ft), an unimagined height, where the lower air pressure made the hydrogen escape all the faster through the eight million little holes.|$|E

5|$|Shepard then {{recruits}} former squad member Tali'Zorah, Thane Krios, and Samara (later optionally {{replaced by}} Morinth), before {{being sent to}} explore <b>a</b> <b>supposedly</b> disabled Collector ship. There, Shepard learns that the Collectors were originally Protheans that were turned into slaves of the Reapers. With EDI's help, Shepard also finds out how to bypass the Omega-4 Relay before being ambushed by the Collectors. Although Shepard's squad escape, his/her relationship with the Illusive Man is strained due to his prior knowledge of the trap. After optionally earning the loyalty of the squad, Shepard visits a derelict Reaper and acquires an IFF necessary to safely travel through the Omega-4 Relay. Shepard may also acquire a disabled geth that, if activated, voluntarily joins the squad and is named Legion.|$|E
5|$|While {{they are}} filming in <b>a</b> <b>supposedly</b> safe Capitol neighborhood, Boggs, the team's commander, is killed. Before he dies, he puts Katniss in charge. She decides {{on her own}} to try to {{infiltrate}} the Capitol and kill Snow. Her team follows her. In the intense urban warfare that ensues, most of Katniss's comrades, including Finnick, are killed. Katniss perseveres alone. As she reaches Snow's mansion, a hoverplane drops parachutes carrying bombs, some of which explode {{among a group of}} children being used as human shields around the mansion. Rebel medics (including Katniss's sister Prim) rush in to help the injured children, but in a calculated move, the rest of the bombs go off, taking a heavy toll on the medics. Prim is killed and Katniss sustains severe burns, but the rebels succeed in taking the Capitol.|$|E
5|$|Playing {{away from}} Merton at <b>a</b> <b>supposedly</b> {{temporary}} home, Wimbledon {{set a record}} for the lowest-ever English top-flight attendance on 22 August 1992 with 3,759 watching the clash with Coventry City, before breaking it twice more: 12 December 1992 against Oldham Athletic with 3,386, and finally on 26 January 1993, drawing only 3,039 fans to a Tuesday-night match against Everton, with reportedly 1,500 travelling from Liverpool. All ten of the Premier League's lowest attendances were Wimbledon home matches in the 1992–93 and 1993–94 seasons. However the general trend {{was one of a}} sharp rise—the club's average home attendance more than doubled at Selhurst Park from around 8,000 during the last years at Plough Lane to a peak of over 18,000 during the 1998–99 Premier League season. Wimbledon's fans were a blend between locals who had supported the club since its non-League days and supporters who had defected from other London teams. According to statistics compiled in 2000, 56% of Wimbledon season-ticket holders were locally born (the second lowest in the Premier League), and only 12% had fathers who were Wimbledon fans. Many attended Wimbledon matches as it was cheaper and safer than other clubs in the capital—Wimbledon had more women and children at their games than any other top-flight club. In 2000, 23% of Wimbledon season-ticket holders earned over £50,000 a year, the second-highest in the division after Chelsea (33%).|$|E

25|$|The {{next step}} in the {{initiation}} ceremony was the lecture given by the master of ceremonies, called Mabalasig/Mabalasik (terrible brother), who informed the neophyte to withdraw if he lacked courage since he would be out of place in the patriotic society. If the neophyte persisted, he was presented to the assembly of the brethren, who subjected him to various ordeals such as blindfolding him and making him shoot <b>a</b> <b>supposedly</b> a revolver at a person, or forcing him to jump over <b>a</b> <b>supposedly</b> hot flame. After the ordeals came to final rite–the pacto de sangre or blood compact–in which the neophyte signed the oath with blood taken from his arm. He was then accepted as a full-pledged member, with a symbolic name by which he was known within Katipunan circles. Bonifacio's symbolic name was Maypagasa; Jacinto was Pingkian and Artemio Ricarte was Vibora.|$|E
