5|$|As Alcibiades had suspected, {{his absence}} emboldened his enemies, {{and they began}} to <b>accuse</b> <b>him</b> of other sacrilegious actions and {{comments}} and even alleged that these actions were connected with a plot against the democracy.

When the fleet arrived in Catana, it found the state trireme Salaminia waiting to bring Alcibiades and the others indicted for mutilating the hermai or profaning the Eleusinian Mysteries back to Athens to stand trial.

His property was confiscated and a reward of one talent was promised to whoever succeeded in killing any who had fled. Meanwhile, the Athenian force in Sicily, after a few early victories, moved against Messina, where the Generals expected their secret allies within the city to betray it to them.
