40|$|STUDY DESIGN: Analysis of {{the effect}} of <b>antifibrinolytics</b> on in vitro bone {{formation}}. OBJECTIVE: As the direct effect of <b>antifibrinolytics</b> on bone formation is unknown, we examined whether <b>antifibrinolytics</b> routinely used in spine surgery, namely, aprotinin and aminocaproic acid, affect osteoblast function in vitro. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: <b>Antifibrinolytics</b> are used in spine surgery to prevent intraoperative blood loss and decrease the need for transfusion. They are either delivered systemically or included as a component of most tissue sealants. Although the role of the fibrinolytic system in wound healing is well established, reports of indirect effects on normal bone biology are emerging. This suggests that the pharmacological targeting of this system may also influence skeletal mass and integrity. METHODS: Osteoblast progenitor cells were cultured with therapeutic doses of aprotinin and aminocaproic acid. The effect of the <b>antifibrinolytics</b> on osteoblast development was determined by measuring cellular viability and proliferation, quantification of matrix mineralization, and genetic analysis of osteoblast differentiation markers. Protease inhibition profiles of the <b>antifibrinolytics</b> were determined by amidolytic chromogenic assays. RESULTS: Therapeutic concentrations of aprotinin dose-dependently inhibited plasmin's proteolytic activity, stimulated osteoblast proliferation, and inhibited osteoblast differentiation and matrix mineralization. Aprotinin inhibition of osteoblast differentiation and matrix mineralization could be recovered by removing aprotinin from culture or stimulating cells with bone morphogenetic protein- 2 or plasmin. Conversely, aminocaproic acid inhibited plasmin's proteolytic activity significantly less than aprotinin and had no effect on osteoblast proliferation, differentiation, or matrix mineralization in its therapeutic range. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that the <b>antifibrinolytics</b> have drastically different effects on osteoblasts due in part to different efficacies of protease inhibition. Further, this work suggests that the fibrinolytic proteases and their inhibitors have great potential to regulate bone by affecting the processes that control osteoblast growth and differentiation...|$|R

25|$|While {{traditional}} thromboelastography is {{a global}} assay for blood clotting disorders and drug effects, TEM is primarily used in combination with appropriate differential assays.

TEM detects both hypo- and hyperfunctional stages of the clotting process and is probably the only reliable rapid test for the diagnosis of hyperfibrinolysis. In contrast to standard clotting tests, the fibrin stabilizing effect of factor XIII contributes to the result. The rapid availability of results helps to discriminate surgical bleeding from a true haemostasis disorder and improves the therapy with blood products, factor concentrates, anticoagulants and protamine, hemostyptic and <b>antifibrinolytic</b> drugs.

40|$|Review {{question}} We {{evaluated the}} evidence about whether giving <b>antifibrinolytics</b> (tranexamic acid or epsilon-aminocaproic acid) {{to people with}} a low platelet count prevents bleeding and whether these <b>antifibrinolytics</b> are associated with side effects. Our target population was people with haematological disorders who have a low platelet count and would usually be treated with platelet transfusions. We did not include people with immune thrombocytopenia {{because they are not}} usually treated with platelet transfusions. Background People with haematological (blood) cancers and other blood disorders (for example, aplastic anaemia) are frequently at risk of severe or life-threatening bleeding from having low platelet counts (thrombocytopenia). This may be from bone marrow failure due to an underlying blood disorder but also from the toxic effect of treatment (chemotherapy) on the bone marrow. These people can be given prophylactic platelet transfusions (from donations) to prevent bleeding if their own platelet counts are too low. These transfusions are not without risks, ranging from mild reactions like fevers to more serious, or even life-threatening, consequences such as infections transmitted to the patient from the transfused platelets, despite stringent attempts to prevent this. Clearly, ways to safely prevent bleeding in people with thrombocytopenia whilst also minimising exposure to transfused platelets would be welcome. One possible way of achieving these goals is the use of <b>antifibrinolytics,</b> known as lysine analogues: tranexamic acid (TXA) and epsilon aminocaproic acid (EACA). These medications help to stabilise the clots that form after bleeding, therefore reducing the chances of further bleeding as well as the need for transfusing platelets. There may be risks {{associated with the use of}} TXA and EACA; the most important being an increased risk of forming unwanted blood clots (such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which could be potentially life-threatening.

Key results In people with haematological disorders who have a low platelet count and would usually be treated with platelet transfusions, we are uncertain whether <b>antifibrinolytics</b> decrease the risk of bleeding and the use of platelet transfusions.

This is despite the routine use of prophylactic platelet transfusions (PlTx) to prevent bleeding once the platelet count falls below a certain threshold.

A possible adjunct to prophylactic PlTxs is the use of <b>antifibrinolytics,</b> specifically the lysine analogues tranexamic acid (TXA) and epsilon aminocaproic acid (EACA). Objectives To determine the efficacy and safety of <b>antifibrinolytics</b> (lysine analogues) in preventing bleeding in patients with haematological disorders. Search methods We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL Issue 12, 2012), MEDLINE (1948 to 10 January 2013), EMBASE (1980 to 10 January 2013), CINAHL (1982 to 10 January 2013), PubMed (e-publications only) and the Transfusion Evidence Library (1980 to January 2013). We also searched several international and ongoing trial databases to 10 January 2013 and citation-tracked relevant reference lists. Selection criteria RCTs involving patients with haematological disorders, who would routinely require prophylactic platelet transfusions to prevent bleeding. We only included trials involving the use of the lysine analogues TXA and EACA. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently screened all electronically derived citations and abstracts of papers, identified by the review search strategy, for relevancy. Two authors independently assessed the full text of all potentially relevant trials for eligibility, completed the data extraction and assessed the studies for risk of bias using The Cochrane Collaboration's 'Risk of bias' tool. We requested missing data from one author but the data were no longer available. The outcomes are reported narratively: we performed no meta-analyses because of the heterogeneity of the available data. Main results Of 470 articles initially identified, 436 were excluded {{on the basis of the}} title and abstract. We reviewed 34 full-text articles from which four studies reported in five articles were eligible for inclusion. We did not identify any RCTs which compared TXA with EACA. We did not identify any ongoing RCTs. One cross-over TXA study (eight patients) was excluded from the outcome analysis because data from this study were at a high risk of bias. Data from the other three studies were all at unclear risk of bias due to lack of reporting of study methodology. Three studies (two TXA (12 to 56 patients), one EACA (18 patients)) reported in four articles (published 1983 to 1995) were included in the narrative review. All three studies compared the drug with placebo. All studies reported bleeding, but it was reported in different ways. All three studies suggested <b>antifibrinolytics</b> reduced the risk of bleeding. The first study showed a difference in average bleeding score of 42 in placebo (P) versus three (TXA). The second study only showed a difference in bleeding episodes during consolidation chemotherapy, with a mean of 2. 6 episodes/patient (standard deviation (SD) 2. 2) (P) versus a mean of 1. 1 episodes/patient (SD 1. 4) (TXA). The third study reported bleeding on 50 % of days at risk (P) versus bleeding on 31 % of days at risk (EACA). Two studies (68 patients) reported thromboembolism and no events occurred. All three studies reported a reduction in PlTx usage. The first study reported a difference of 222 platelet units (P) versus 69 platelet units (TXA). The second study only showed a difference in total platelet usage during consolidation chemotherapy, with a mean of 9. 3 units (SD 3. 3) (P) versus 3. 7 (SD 4. 1) (TXA). The third study reported one PlTx every 10. 5 days at risk (P) versus one PlTx every 13. 3 days at risk (EACA). Two studies reported red cell transfusion requirements and one study found a reduction in red cell transfusion usage. One study reported death due to bleeding as an outcome measure and none occurred. Only one study reported adverse events of TXA as an outcome measure and none occurred. None of the studies reported on the following pre-specified outcomes: overall mortality, adverse events of transfusion, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or quality of life (QoL). Authors' conclusions Our results indicate that the evidence available for the use of <b>antifibrinolytics</b> in haematology patients is very limited.

40|$|Abstract Hereditary {{angioedema}} (HAE) {{resulting from}} the deficiency of the C 1 inhibitor (C 1 -INH) is a rare, life-threatening disorder. It is characterized by attacks of angioedema involving the skin and/or the mucosa of the upper airways, {{as well as the}} intestinal mucosa. In approximately 50 per cent of cases, clinical manifestations may appear during childhood. The complex management of HAE in pediatric patients is in many respects different from the management of adults. Establishing the diagnosis early, preferably before the onset of clinical symptoms, is essential in cases with a positive family history. Complement studies usually afford accurate diagnosis, whereas molecular genetics tests may prove helpful in uncertain cases. Appropriate therapy, supported by counselling, suitable modification of lifestyle, and avoidance of triggering factors (which primarily include mechanical trauma, mental stress and airway infections in children) may spare the patient unnecessary surgery and may prevent mortality. Prompt control of edematous attacks, short-term prophylaxis and intermittent therapy are recommended as the primary means for the management of pediatric cases. Medicinal products currently used for the treatment of children with hereditary angioedema include <b>antifibrinolytics,</b> attenuated androgens, and C 1 -INH replacement therapy. Current guidelines favour <b>antifibrinolytics</b> for long-term prophylaxis because of their favorable safety profile but efficacy may be lacking. Attenuated androgens administered in the lowest effective dose are another option. C 1 -INH replacement therapy is also an effective and safe agent for children.
