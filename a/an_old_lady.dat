A monk {{from the}} Kii Province, Tōkōbō Yūkei was journeying in Adachigahara when the sun was about to set, and {{requested}} {{to be allowed to}} stay in a cave for lodging. <b>An</b> <b>old</b> <b>lady</b> lived in that cave.

25|$|On Saturday, February 23, 1985 {{during a}} game at Bloomington between Purdue and Indiana, just five minutes into the game, a {{scramble}} for a loose ball resulted in a foul call on Indiana's Marty Simmons. Immediately after the resumption of play, a foul was called on Indiana's Daryl Thomas. Knight, irate, insisted {{the first of the}} two calls should have been for a jump ball and ultimately received a technical foul. Purdue's Steve Reid stepped to the free throw line to shoot the resulting free throws, but before he could, Knight grabbed a red plastic chair from Indiana's bench and threw it across the floor toward the basket in front of Reid. Knight was charged with second and third technical fouls and was ejected from the game. He apologized for his actions the next day and was given a one-game suspension and two years probation from the Big Ten. Since the incident, Knight has occasionally joked about throwing the chair by saying that he saw <b>an</b> <b>old</b> <b>lady</b> standing on the opposite sideline and threw her the chair so she could sit down.|$|E
