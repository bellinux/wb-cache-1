25|$|The Mistel project, a {{composite}} <b>aircraft</b> <b>configuration,</b> was advocated by Peltz at the time.

40|$|The paper {{introduces}} an automation {{process of}} generating a tetrahedral mesh for {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) analysis of <b>aircraft</b> <b>configurations</b> in early conceptual design.

40|$|High-lift {{systems are}} highly complex {{subsystems}} of aircraft, composed {{of hundreds of}} components working together in synergy. Designing new concepts for new <b>aircraft</b> <b>configurations</b> and requirements (e. g. multi-functional flight control systems) for more efficient flight is a complex and demanding task, thus designers are prone to using existing system solutions with slight modifications. Hence, new flight control system architectures are based on solutions mainly optimized for different (old) aircraft. This inhibits the complete capture of the benefits that come with systems optimized for present <b>aircraft</b> <b>configurations</b> and requirements. As a first step towards generating innovative architectures driven by the new requirements, this paper applies a stochastic design structure matrix clustering algorithm within the pre-design process, to generate alternative system architectures. With this approach, near-optimal system architectures for novel <b>aircraft</b> <b>configurations</b> and requirements can be analysed and alternatives can be evaluated for system level impact...|$|R
25|$|The program {{aimed at}} {{producing}} a technology demonstrator aircraft to explore the various challenges which the radical design entails. The proposed aircraft would be a purely flying wing (an aircraft with no other auxiliary surfaces such as tails, canards or a fuselage) where the wing is swept with {{one side of the}} aircraft forward, and one backwards in an asymmetric fashion. This <b>aircraft</b> <b>configuration</b> is believed to give it a combination of high speed, long range and long endurance. The program entailed two phases. Phase I explored the theory and result in a conceptual design, while Phase II would have resulted in the design, manufacture and flight test of an aircraft. The outcome of the program would have resulted in a dataset that could then be used when considering future military aircraft designs.|$|E
500|$|Another {{class of}} {{inherent}} errors {{is that of}} position error. [...] A position error is produced by the aircraft's static pressure being different from the air pressure remote from the aircraft. [...] This error {{is caused by the}} air flowing past the static port at a speed different from the aircraft's true airspeed. [...] Position errors may provide positive or negative errors, depending on one of several factors. [...] These factors include airspeed, angle of attack, aircraft weight, acceleration, <b>aircraft</b> <b>configuration,</b> {{and in the case of}} helicopters, rotor downwash. [...] There are two categories of position errors, which are [...] "fixed errors" [...] and [...] "variable errors". [...] Fixed errors are defined as errors which are specific to a particular model of aircraft. [...] Variable errors are caused by external factors such as deformed panels obstructing the flow of air, or particular situations which may overstress the aircraft.|$|E
500|$|The NTSB {{also cited}} the pilot's {{inability}} {{to land on}} his first attempt as contributing to the crash. The investigation revealed that wind shear was {{a significant factor in}} the failed approach but that other factors probably contributed. The report cited recurring maintenance problems with the airplane's autopilot as a possible factor. If the pilot had been forced to fly manually from Medell√≠n, investigators believed this might have added to exhaustion and stress in the cockpit. For evidence, the NTSB pointed to nine instances where the captain asked the copilot to repeat the ATC instructions or to confirm the <b>aircraft</b> <b>configuration.</b> This stress, investigators asserted, would have degraded the flight crew's performance on final approach. [...] Investigators also looked at the traffic management by the Central Flow Control Facility (CFCF). The CFCF, in communication with NY TRACON, established an airport acceptance rate of 28 aircraft landings per hour that morning. Later, a CFCF supervisor contacted NY TRACON and requested a higher rate of 33 landings per hour. This acceptance rate, investigators concluded, was based on inaccurate weather conditions. The report concluded that these traffic management problems contributed to the conditions that led to the accident but did not lead directly to the accident.|$|E

Woodward, under {{contract}} to the NASA Langley Research Center, has recently formulated a distributed vortex aerodynamic singularity and developed an improved unified subsonic-supersonic potential flow computer program employing this singularity.

40|$|The {{development}} of a new transonic code to predict unsteady flows about realistic <b>aircraft</b> <b>configurations</b> are described. An approximate factorization algorithm for solution of the unsteady transonic small disturbance equation is first described. Because of the superior stability characteristics of the AF algorithm, a new transonic aeroelasticity code was developed which is described in some detail. The new code was very easy to modify to include the additional aircraft components, so in {{a very short period of}} time the code was developed to treat complete <b>aircraft</b> <b>configurations.</b> Finally, applications are presented which demonstrate many of the geometry capabilities of the new code...|$|R

40|$|A joint European {{initiative}} to develop hybrid grid based CFD-technology {{with a short}} problem-turnaround time applicable to complex <b>aircraft</b> <b>configurations</b> has been undertaken. In {{the context of the}} Brite-Euram fourth framework programme two projects have been executed, namely FASTFLO I (1996 - 1998) and FASTFLO II (1998 - 2000). The practical outcome of the joint development has been CFD technology with inviscid (FASTFLO I) and viscous (FASTFLO II) flow modelling for complex <b>aircraft</b> <b>configurations</b> (see figure 1 for an example). The resulting CFD technology is based on the hybrid grid approach (Ref. 7); this approach combines prismatic grid generation in a layer near aerodynamic surfaces with tetralhedral grid generation in the remainder of the flow domain. It has been concluded that the hybrid grid based CFD technology (both viscous, and inviscid flow models) meets the following two industrial requirements: 1. The CFD problem-turnaround time is within the order of a week for geometrically complex <b>aircraft</b> <b>configurations</b> and, 2. The CFD technology is able to provide a sufficient accuracy of the aerodynamic entities (like pressure, lift, drag and moments) ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{primary test}} {{objective}} was to study the aeroelastic effects on the aft wing of the forward wing's rotors and establish a baseline <b>aircraft</b> <b>configuration.</b> Alan Ewing, Bell's QTR program manager, reported that [...] "Testing showed those loads from that vortex on the rear rotor [...] same as the loads we see on the front ," [...] and [...] "Aeroelastic stability of the wing looks {{exactly the same as}} the conventional tiltrotor".

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1920s, {{the idea of}} the {{interceptor}} fighter was forming. [...] To deal with the faster and higher flying bombers, fighters had both to be fast at height and quick to get there. The Air Ministry was keen to determine the best <b>aircraft</b> <b>configuration</b> and sought, under Air Ministry specification F.20/27, manufacturers to build biplanes and both low- and high-wing monoplanes. [...] Vickers were asked for a prototype low-wing fighter and this became (somewhat unofficially) called the [...] "Jockey", or sometimes the Jockey I. [...] The name covered Vickers Types 151 and 171; the Jockey II was an early name for the later Venom.|$|E
2500|$|Although Braniff {{had been}} one of the first U.S. {{operators}} of the British-built BAC One-Eleven (and the first U.S. airline to order the British Aircraft Corporation twin jet), in 1965 Lawrence ordered twelve new US-built Boeing 727-100s and cancelled most of the remaining One-Eleven orders. The 727s had been selected before Lawrence's arrival, but no orders had been placed. These planes were the [...] "quick change" [...] (B727-100QC) model, which had a large freight loading door located on one side of the aircraft just aft of the flight deck. This allowed Braniff to begin late-night cargo service, while the aircraft carried passengers during the day. This doubled the 727 utilization rate and allowed Braniff to open a new cargo business, AirGo. The new 727s could also be outfitted in a mixed cargo/passenger Combi <b>aircraft</b> <b>configuration</b> if needed and Braniff did operate [...] "red eye" [...] overnight services carrying cargo in the forward section with seating for 51 passengers in the rear coach compartment of the jetliner.|$|E
40|$|A Time-dependent Functional Pooling Nonlinear AutoRegressive with eXogenous {{excitation}} (TFP-NARX) {{methodology for}} aircraft virtual sensor design is introduced. The methodology {{is unique in}} establishing a single but global nonlinear dynamical model, referred to as TFP-NARX, from data obtained from several individual flights, each corresponding to different flight conditions and <b>aircraft</b> <b>configurations.</b> This model structure is demonstrated {{to be capable of}} accurately representing the aircraft nonlinear dynamics under various flight conditions and <b>aircraft</b> <b>configurations</b> in terms of aircraft weight and center-of-gravity. Based on this model structure, three individual designs are postulated: A ‚Äúfixed ‚Äù design pertaining to a single aircraft weight and center-of-gravity configuration, as well as two more involved designs, a ‚Äúbasic ‚Äù and an ‚Äúextended ‚Äù one, that account for various <b>aircraft</b> <b>configurations.</b> The three designs are subsequently employed for the development of angle-of-attack virtual sensors for the main flight regimes (landing, take-off, clean flight) of a small commercial aircraft. The performance of the developed virtual sensors is examined via a number of validation flights within a nonlinear simulation environment and are shown to meet the requirements of low mean and peak error...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} recent {{progress in}} developing meta-models for efficiently predicting the aerodynamic loads acting on industrial <b>aircraft</b> <b>configurations.</b> We introduce a physics-based approach to reduced-order modeling based on proper orthogonal decompostition of snapshots of the full-order CFD model, and a mathematical approach to variable-fidelity modeling that aims at combining many low-fidelity CFD results with as few high-fidelity CFD results as possible using bridge functions and variants of Kriging and Cokriging. In both cases, {{the goal is}} to arrive at a model that can be used as an efficient surrogate to the original high-fidelity or full-order CFD model but with significantly less evaluation time and storage requirements.
