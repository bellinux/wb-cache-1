500|$|In 1960, Charles Harvard Gibbs-Smith, {{aviation}} {{historian at}} the Science Museum in London, {{reacted to the}} mid-1950s assertion that Coandă built and flew the first jet engine aircraft. Gibbs-Smith wrote that [...] "there has recently arisen some controversy about this machine, designed by the Rumanian-born and French-domiciled Henri Coanda, which was exhibited at the Paris salon in October 1910. Until recently it has been accepted as an all-wood sesquiplane, with cantilever wings, powered by a 50hp Clerget engine driving a 'turbo-propulseur' {{in the form of}} a large but simple ducted <b>air</b> <b>fan.</b> This fan was fitted right across the machine's nose and the cowling covered the nose and part of the engine: the resulting 'jet' of plain air was to propel the aeroplane." [...] He wrote that [...] "no claims that it flew, or was even tested, were made at the time", and that the story of it flying suddenly appeared in the 1950s—the aircraft was thus [...] "disinterred from its obscurity." [...] He wrote that the airfield at Issy-les-Moulineaux, a former military exercise ground where the test supposedly took place, was under the constant observation of the French Army who owned it, by French aviation reporters and photographers, and by aviation experts from other countries. He said that the airfield was the [...] "most famous, most used, most observed, and most reported-on 'airfield' in Paris", and that all events, let alone an exciting crash and destruction by fire, would have been carried in local papers and described in military reports, but no contemporary accounts exist of the Coandă-1910 being tested, flown or destroyed. Gibbs-Smith countered the Coandă assertions point by point, saying that the aircraft did not have a retractable undercarriage, did not have leading or trailing edge wing slots, did not have a fuel tank overhead in the wing, and did not have fuel injected into any turbine. Gibbs-Smith pointed out that the pilot would have been killed by the heat if any combustion had been initiated in the engine's air stream.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to experimentally investigate the influence of <b>air</b> mixing <b>fans</b> on <b>air</b> temperature and humidity distribution in an arched roof greenhouse. The greenhouse was occupied by a tomato crop and equipped with two side roll-up openings for ventilation, a PVC pipe heating system and a fan coil heater. Furthermore, for air mixing purposes, an <b>air</b> mixing <b>fan</b> was used. <b>Air</b> temperature and relative humidity was simultaneously recorded in 17 positions equally distributed inside the greenhouse. Concerning the effects of <b>air</b> mixing <b>fan</b> on microclimate distribution, {{it was found that}} the mixing fan increased microclimate homogeneity. On the other hand, the use of fan-coil heater was found to increase microclimate heterogeneity. The maximum absolute air temperature and relative humidity difference (observed above the crop) between the centre of the greenhouse and the different measuring positions at the same level, was about 1 °C and 4 % respectively when the <b>air</b> mixing <b>fan</b> was not used and about 0. 4 °C and 1 % respectively, when the <b>air</b> mixing <b>fan</b> was used. The use of a fan-coil heater increased the above mentioned differences to the level of about 1. 7 °C and 6 % respectively when the <b>air</b> mixing <b>fan</b> was not used and about 1 °C and 3 % respectively, when the <b>air</b> mixing <b>fan</b> was used. Finally, it was observed that the use of an <b>air</b> mixing <b>fan</b> and/or a fan-coil heater reduced the greenhouse air relative humidity...|$|R

Ismaïl has spared Turnavitu a life of near constant rotation, remunerating his services: the seed-bed interviews, the ritualized apologizes to the leashed badgers, the praise of Ismaïl's fashion sense, and the swabbing of canola over Ismaïl's gowns. Their relationship breaks down as Turnavitu, returning from the Balearic Islands in the form of a jerrycan, passes the common cold to Ismaïl's badgers. Sacked from his job, he contemplates suicide ("not before seeing to the extraction of four canines in his mouth"), and hurls himself into a pyre made up of Ismaïl's dresses; the patron falls into depression and [...] "decrepitude", retreating to his seed-bed for the rest of his own life.|$|E
2500|$|Prima Games' {{guide to}} Shaolin Monks states she is [...] "quick enough for {{moderate}} damage, and {{has some of}} the most potent special moves in the game," [...] but her limitation is she needs to be fighting at close range to make an use of it.

She was rated overall only 4/10 for this game. Prima's official guide for Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe, on the other hand, called her [...] "one of the more dangerous characters in the game due to her speed and extremely effective move-set." [...] Their official guide for 2011's Mortal Kombat deemed Kitana a capable fighter who once again [...] "is at her deadliest in the corner" [...] and is also especially good if played against Baraka and Cyber Sub-Zero. Prima observed Kitana in MK2011 as her [...] "cheapest" [...] incarnation so far, stating [...] "Kitana is not only one of the most damaging characters in the game, but in addition to the Fan Lift and Square Wave Punch, she can combo her <b>Air</b> <b>Fan</b> almost any time an opponent is airborne." [...] According to Prima's guide to MKX, [...] "Kitana {{is one of the more}} unique characters in the game" [...] due to her inheriting many of Jade's special moves, and she [...] "is a zoning character at heart, but she can play offensively or defensively" [...] depending of a variation chosen. The guide recommended the [...] "Mournful" [...] variant for former Jade players, and the [...] "Assassin" [...] variant, which [...] "tries to take the generally defensive style Kitana has in Mortal Kombat X and add some offensive firepower to it," [...] for veteran Kitana players.|$|E

6000|$|When {{everything}} was still once more, I crept out of bed, sick and feeble, and lit the gas {{with a hand}} that trembled {{as if it were}} aged with a hundred years. The light brought some little cheer to my spirits. I sat down and fell into a dreamy contemplation of that great footprint in the ashes. By and by its outlines began to waver and grow dim. I glanced up and the broad gas-flame was slowly wilting away. In the same moment I heard that elephantine tread again. I noted its approach, nearer and nearer, along the musty halls, and dimmer and dimmer the light waned. The tread reached my very door and paused--the light had dwindled to a sickly blue, and all things about me lay in a spectral twilight. The door did not open, and yet I felt a faint gust of <b>air</b> <b>fan</b> my cheek, and presently was conscious of a huge, cloudy presence before me. I watched it with fascinated eyes. A pale glow stole over the Thing; gradually its cloudy folds took shape--an arm appeared, then legs, then a body, and last a great sad face looked out of the vapor. Stripped of its filmy housings, naked, muscular and comely, the majestic Cardiff Giant loomed above me! ...|$|E

Eyethorne took her some distance out of her way; and at the small country station where they alighted, which was two and a half miles from the village, she found from the time-table that her interview with the Churtons {{would have to be a}} short one, as there was only one train which would take her to Salisbury so as to arrive there at a reasonably early hour in the evening. At the station they took a fly, and the drive to Eyethorne brought before Fan's eyes a succession of charming scenes-- green hills, broad meadows yellow with buttercups, deep shady lanes, and old farm-houses. The spring had been cold and backward; but since the beginning of May there had been days of warm sunshine with occasional gentle rains, and the trees, both shade and fruit, had all at once rushed into leaf and perfect bloom. Such vivid and tender greens as the foliage showed, such a wealth of blossom on every side, such sweet fragrance filling the warm <b>air,</b> <b>Fan</b> had never imagined; and yet how her prophetic heart had longed for the sweet country! ...|$|E
