HIT denied this; Yim reiterated that no members of top management of Hutchison Whampoa, Hutchison Port Holdings Trust or HIT are board members of any of the contractors. Yim said that the name of Sakoma – the HIT subsidiary that previously dealt with out-sourcing contracts – still appears on the entry passcards, and acknowledged it was <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> <b>for</b> that name to be there. Yim said the Hutchison Logistics, replacing Sakoma, is now responsible for management of out-sourcing.|$|E

25|$|Voltaire's famous {{quotations}} about New France {{were for}} the most part written between 1753 and 1763, shortly before, and then during, the Seven Years' War. Voltaire was living in Switzerland during most of this period. During the war, he sometimes appeared to favor the Prussian king Frederick II (allied to Britain against France), with whom he was maintaining a regular personal correspondence during the war (the two men being again in better terms after their quarrel of 1753). Voltaire was also {{at the same time in}} correspondence with some French ministers. He thus corresponded with both sides of the belligerents in the war, although mostly on a personal and literary level more than a political level. He thought that the war was <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> <b>for</b> France and he used several opportunities to ask the French ministers to simply quit the war. Boundary disputes in their American colonies had been an early casus belli (1754) between Britain and France in this war, which was later (1756) further complicated by purely European considerations and ended seven years later (1763). Voltaire's position that France should let go of its North American colonies was in accord with his position about the war in general. For him, handing over New France would appease Britain. His position about the European war likely increased his tendency to paint New France as being of little value.|$|E

After this false ending, the song returns with a 45-second coda, which MacDonald identifies as a [...] "Maori finale – <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> <b>for</b> 'Hawaiian' (aloha)".

This tint was considered important enough that Lynch sent a representative to the network to ensure they understood it was deliberate and not <b>a</b> <b>mistake,</b> <b>for</b> fear that they might correct the saturation to be more [...] "realistic" [...] before broadcasting it.|$|E

500|$|The East Anglian {{pedigree}} in the Anglian collection {{brings the}} descent down to Ælfwald, indicating {{that it was}} compiled during his reign, possibly by around 726. Showing Ælfwald as son of Ealdwulf, the pedigree continues back through Ethelric, Eni, Tytla, Wuffa, Wehha, Wilhelm, Hryp, Hrothmund, Trygil, Tyttman and Caser (Caesar) to [...] Woden. The Historia Brittonum, which was probably compiled in the early 9th century, also has a version (the de ortu regum Estanglorum) in descending order, showing: [...] "Woden genuit ('begat') Casser, who begat Titinon, who begat Trigil, who begat Rodmunt, who begat Rippan, who begat Guillem Guechan. He first ruled in Britain over the race of East Angles. Guecha begat Guffa, who begat Tydil, who begat Ecni, who begat Edric, who begat Aldul, who begat Elric". It is not certain whether the last name, Elric, is <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> <b>for</b> Ælfwald or is referring to a different individual.|$|E

[...] Five doves fly into the sky to Mao's right. [...] Before him on Tiananmen Square, honor guards and members of patriotic organizations are assembled in orderly ranks, with some holding banners. [...] Qianmen, the gate {{at the south end of}} the square, is visible, as is Yongdingmen gate (seen to the left of Mao). [...] Beyond the old city walls that at the time enclosed the square (they were torn down in the 1950s), the city of Beijing is visible, and in green is represented the nation of China, with those further scenes under bright sunlight and sharply defined clouds. [...] October 1 had been an overcast day in Beijing; Dong took artistic license with the weather.|$|E
500|$|On September 15, 2017, Douglas Elmendorf, {{dean of the}} Kennedy School, {{announced}} that Chelsea Manning {{had been invited to}} spend only one day at the school, and that her title of visiting fellow did not convey a special honor. [...] "We did not intend to honor her in any way," [...] Elmendorf wrote, [...] "or to endorse any of her words or deeds…. However, I now think that designating Chelsea Manning as a Visiting Fellow was <b>a</b> <b>mistake,</b> <b>for</b> which I accept responsibility. … Therefore, we are withdrawing the invitation to her to serve as a Visiting Fellow—and the perceived honor that it implies to some people—while maintaining the invitation for her to spend a day at the Kennedy School and speak in the Forum. I apologize to her and to the many concerned people from whom I have heard today for not recognizing upfront the full implications of our original invitation." [...] When Elmendorf phoned Manning, a member of her support team challenged him to explain why Harvard was so concerned about the title [...] "visiting fellow." [...] The team was alienated by his response, which they inferred suggested she had nothing to contribute. Manning then hung up on the dean.|$|E

500|$|The last {{details of}} the plot were {{finalised}} in October. [...] Guy Fawkes would light the fuse and then escape across the Thames, while simultaneously a revolt in the Midlands would help to ensure the capture of Princess Elizabeth. Late on Monday 4 November, Bates set out with Catesby and John Wright for the planned revolt. [...] The following day while at Dunstable re-shoeing Catesby's horse, they were met by Rookwood, who delivered the devastating news that Fawkes had been discovered guarding the gunpowder and arrested. [...] As those conspirators still in London fled the city, the group soon integrated Christopher Wright and Thomas Percy. [...] They rode toward Dunchurch, on horses sent from Everard Digby by prearrangement. [...] They met Robert Wintour (brother to Thomas) at Ashby St Ledgers, and Digby at Dunchurch. On 6 November they stole horses from Warwick Castle, and collected stored weapons from Norbrook, near Stratford-upon-Avon. [...] As they continued toward Huddington, and as the government issued a proclamation for the fugitives' arrest (Catesby's servant was listed as Robert Ashfield, probably <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> <b>for</b> Bates), Catesby ordered Bates to deliver a letter to Father Garnet at Coughton Court, asking for his support. [...] Bates's news proved momentous for the Jesuits; he overheard Tesimond exclaim [...] "we are all utterly undone". [...] Garnet's reply to Catesby begged them to stop their [...] "wicked actions", and {{to listen to the}} pope's teachings.|$|E

In analogy with [...] "child sexual abuse images" [...] being the preferred term for child pornography, McGlynn and Rackley proposed [...] "image-based sexual abuse". Along with journalist Sarah Jeong, they have argued that it is harmful to associate revenge porn with pornography which revolves around consent.
