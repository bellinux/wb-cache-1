The types of control {{measures}} depend on the setting (such as epidemiologic, ecologic, and cultural factors). Strict control of the growth and sale of watercress and other edible water plants is important. Individual people can protect themselves by not eating raw watercress and other water plants, especially from endemic grazing areas. Travelers to areas with poor sanitation should avoid food and water that might be contaminated (tainted). Vegetables grown in fields, {{that might have been}} irrigated with polluted water, should be thoroughly cooked, as should viscera from potentially infected animals.|$|R

Acknowledging this situation {{and its potential}} effect {{on the ability to}} respond to vector-borne diseases, the U. S.

The programs, assisted by quality improvement (QI) experts, used the assessment results to prioritize improvement areas that were addressed with QI projects intended to increase effectiveness and efficiency in the delivery of services such as responding to mosquito complaints and educating the public about vector-borne disease prevention. This article describes the initiative as a process LHD vector <b>control</b> <b>programs</b> may adapt to meet their performance management needs.

These programs have evolved considerably over the past 10 to 15 years in North America. In the past only a few animals, other than those suffering from clinical parasitism, were treated. As producers realized the benefits of parasite control they began administering anthelmintics to coincide with other management practices. Parasite control strategies today should be formulated on the epidemiology of the parasites {{as well as the}} management practices followed in a particular <b>area.</b> Such <b>control</b> <b>programs</b> are designed to strategically remove helminths from the host and to prevent contamination of the pasture with nematode eggs. Outside of the avermectin and milbemycin classes of compounds, most anthelmintics have a maximum activity period of 2 - 3 days, after which the animals are readily reinfected. For parasite control under normal management practices, strategic anthelmintic treatment should be administered before moving cattle onto pastures that were of relatively low infectivity in order to prevent or at least delay reinfection. This type of program benefits from the use of a broad spectrum anthelmintic where the majority of adult and larval nematodes, including inhibite...|$|R

40|$|Originally from {{southeast}} Asia, the day-time biting mosquito Aedes albopictus, {{has become}} established throughout {{the eastern and}} southern U. S. and Hawaii. This mosquito is an important vector of several diseases, including dengue virus. New shipments of this mosquito were discovered in California in 2001 in packages of “lucky bamboo ” plants (Dracaena sanderiana). Thirty importers of “lucky bamboo ” plants were inspected and 40 % {{were found to be}} infested. Nursery employees and nearby residents in several counties were being bitten. Immediately a control protocol including insecticide applications, monitoring, and import restrictions was employed. Follow-up monitoring during the summer of 2004 found more Ae. albopictus populations and immediate action was taken to eradicate these populations. Continued monitoring and if necessary rapid control action will continue to prevent the establishment of Ae. albopictus in CA.

40|$|The {{disadvantages}} of the acute, fast-acting, rodenticides are well {{understood by the}} specialist. However, despite poison-shyness and consequent short-lived, low efficacy rodent control, many users prefer 2 ̆ 2 acutes 2 ̆ 2 such as zinc phosphide to 2 ̆ 2 first-generation 2 ̆ 2 anticoagulants of the warfarin type. The techniques necessary for efficient use of the first-generation anticoagulants are often inappropriate, particularly in agriculture. High labour and bait inputs required are unacceptable and are, together {{with the need for}} <b>area</b> coordinated <b>control</b> <b>programs,</b> significantly responsible for lack of widespread use of anticoagulants, even in those countries with a long history both of disastrous rodent damage to crops and rodent damage research and training centers. There are other problems, too, including widespread antithesis to prophylactic rodent control, perhaps in part due to the inherent low efficacy of acutes and the impractical nature (often leading to low efficacy) of first-generation anticoagulant baiting procedures. The advent of a highly potent but slow-acting rodenticide molecule, brodifacoum, has allowed the development of the pulsed baiting technique. This practical technique is highly effective and offers very significant savings both in bait and labour compared to first-generation anticoagulants, with excellent levels of control. Single applications are more effective than single applications of acute toxicants. Now used in agricultural and urban <b>control</b> <b>programs,</b> the technique is proving to be very cost-effective and highly acceptable, both to educated campaign organizers and uneducated users.

30|$|Insecticides {{have been}} widely used for decades, and human {{exposure}} to these insecticides always causes public health concern. Malathion is an organophosphate insecticide widely used in agriculture, residential areas, public recreation <b>areas,</b> and pest <b>control</b> <b>programs,</b> and it is also used for the treatment of the head and body lice (Stone et al. 2014). The compounds of organophosphorus are broadly utilized as acaricides and insecticides in agriculture. They are likewise often utilized in drug and industry. Residues of organophosphate (OP) insecticides have been recognized in the food products, grains, vegetables, water bodies, and soil (Poet et al. 2004). In addition, because of the extensive accessibility of organophosphorus pesticides, toxicity is widespread (Garcia et al. 2003). Previous researches have reported that the male reproductive system have been affected by some OP insecticides (Farag et al. 2000). Malathion is an organophosphorus insecticide that affects the reproductive system. Humans, birds, and other animals are in contact to increased levels of this insecticide (malathion), due to its common utilization and the rising rates of food contamination (Babu et al. 2006).|$|R
40|$|Fifty {{years of}} {{residual}} insecticide spraying to control Triatoma infestans in the Gran Chaco region of northern Argentina, Paraguay and Bolivia shows that vertically coordinated interventions aiming at full coverage have limited effects and are unsustainable. We quantified the {{spatial distribution of}} T. infestans domestic infestation at the district level, identified environmental factors associated with high infestation and then explored the usefulness of risk maps for the spatial stratification of interventions. We performed spatial analyses of house infestation data collected by the National Chagas Service in Moreno Department, northern Argentina (1999 - 2002). Clusters of high domestic infestation occurred in the southwestern extreme of the district. A multi-model selection approach showed that domestic infestation clustered in areas of low elevation, with few farmlands, high density of rural houses, high mean maximum land surface temperature, large NDVI, and high percentage of degraded and deforested lands. The best model classified 98. 4 % of the communities in the training dataset (sensitivity, 93. 3 %; specificity, 95. 4 %). The risk map evidenced that the high-risk area only encompassed 16 % of the district. By building a network-based transportation model we assessed the operational costs of spatially contiguous and spatially targeted interventions. Targeting clusters of high infestation would have reached - 80 % of all communities slated for full-coverage insecticide spraying, reducing in half the total time and economic cost incurred by a spatially contiguous strategy. In disperse rural <b>areas</b> where <b>control</b> <b>programs</b> can accomplish limited coverage, consideration of infestation hot spots {{can contribute to the}} design and execution of cost-effective interventions against Chagas disease vectors.

40|$|Autumn olive (Elaeagnus umbellata) is {{an exotic}} and {{invasive}} species {{that was used}} extensively as an erosion control plant along many highways in the Midwestern United States during the last century. Due to its invasive and strong nitrogen-fixing abilities, it aggressively spread outside its intended use <b>area.</b> Unfortunately, <b>control</b> management <b>programs</b> by many organizations have failed to control its spread. Currently, it exists in dense patches over vast areas in the Midwest. A by-product of its nitrogen-fixing is nitrate. Nitrate is regulated in drinking water for its known toxicity to human and animal infants. This study assesses the leaching of nitrate from autumn olive infested areas into its surrounding environment. Soil and groundwater samples were collected from areas infested with autumn olive and from paired nearby grass plots in Indiana and Michigan between 2009 and 2014. The samples were analyzed for nitrate, ammonia, and total nitrogen {{in addition to other}} relevant chemical and physical soil and water parameters.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a generic programming paradigm, called the control plan paradigm, based on Nested Finite State Machines (NFSMs) and event-driven mechanisms. In this paradigm, a <b>control</b> <b>program</b> {{can be divided}} into two non-overlapping parts: behavior and operation specifications. This division allows machine-dependent and machineindependent <b>control</b> <b>programs</b> to be designed and implemented independently of each other, and integrated when an application program is constructed. Our evaluation on an open-architecture machine controller testbed shows that such programming paradigm improves significantly the reconfigurability and reusability of <b>control</b> <b>programs.</b> KEYWORDS: Open-architecture <b>control,</b> <b>programming</b> paradigm, software integration. INTRODUCTION An open-architecture controller (OAC) requires <b>control</b> <b>programs</b> to be reusable and reconfigurable [3, 6]. However, <b>control</b> <b>programs</b> developed using current <b>control</b> <b>programming</b> paradigm are difficult to meet this requirement due to their hard-coded machine-dependent information that cannot be applied to different configurations. As a result, significant time and costs are required to design, implement and test <b>control</b> <b>programs.</b> In this paper, we propose a generic programming paradigm, called the control plan paradigm, which is based on Nested Finite State Machines (NFSMs) and event-driven mechanisms. This programming paradigm distinguishes machine-dependent specifications and machine-independent specifications in <b>control</b> <b>programs,</b> and localizes the machinedependent behaviors and operations. Such machine-dependent programs can be reused when a new application requires the same configuration, while the machine-independent programs can be reused when an application requires the same high-level behaviors. Localization of machine-dependent programs further enables integration of vendor-neutral products. A <b>control</b> <b>program</b> in the <b>control</b> plan paradigm can also be constructed bottomup by integrating the <b>control</b> <b>programs</b> of different subsystems. The NFSM model, as an extended formal method, facilitates the verification of <b>control</b> <b>programs...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe World Health Organization, World Heart Federation, {{and other}} {{organizations}} recommend comprehensive <b>control</b> <b>programs</b> for rheumatic fever (RF) and rheumatic heart disease (RHD). However, advice on components of <b>control</b> <b>programs</b> are simple lists, with little guidance on program structure or priorities. In particular, there are limited recommendations on “stepwise” implementation and few guidelines on which program components should take temporal priority. An evidence-based framework for describing, prioritizing, and implementing comprehensive RF/RHD <b>control</b> <b>programs</b> is needed. A literature review of existing RF/RHD <b>control</b> <b>program</b> recommendations generated a list of program components. Descriptions and analysis of RF/RHD <b>control</b> <b>programs</b> informed temporal prioritizing of component parts. Relevant programmatic research from other vertical disease <b>control</b> <b>programs</b> was reviewed for generalizable implementation experiences. Twenty-five individual components of comprehensive RF/RHD <b>control</b> <b>programs</b> were identified. These fell into “baseline” program requirements (including burden of disease data, treatment guidelines, and human resources) and requirements for providing primary, secondary, and tertiary interventions. Primordial prevention and research priorities were overarching themes. These components were developed into a conceptual framework schema. Existing literature contains valuable lessons on the design and implementation of comprehensive RF/RHD <b>control</b> <b>programs.</b> Fashioning these guidelines and programmatic experiences into a conceptual framework schema benefits clinicians, policy makers, and RHD advocates...|$|R
