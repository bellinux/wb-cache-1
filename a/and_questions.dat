40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the problem of question search. In question search, given a question as query, we are to return questions semantically equivalent or close to the queried question. In this paper, we propose to conduct question search by identifying <b>question</b> topic <b>and</b> <b>question</b> focus. More specifically, we first summarize questions in a data structure consisting of <b>question</b> topic <b>and</b> <b>question</b> focus. Then we model <b>question</b> topic <b>and</b> <b>question</b> focus in a language modeling framework for search. We also propose to use the MDLbased tree cut model for identifying <b>question</b> topic <b>and</b> <b>question</b> focus automatically. Experimental results indicate that our approach of identifying <b>question</b> topic <b>and</b> <b>question</b> focus for search significantly outperforms the baseline methods such as Vector Space Model (VSM) and Language Model for Information Retrieval (LMIR). ...|$|R

Pearse reported that the issue of conflict of interest applied to the Schindlers as well since, had Michael divorced Terri as they wanted him to, they would have inherited the remainder of Mrs. Schiavo's estate upon her death.|$|E
