5|$|The {{exoskeleton}} {{is generally}} blue above, with spots that coalesce, and yellow below. The red colour associated with lobsters only appears after cooking. This occurs because, in life, the red pigment <b>astaxanthin</b> {{is bound to}} a protein complex, but the complex is broken up by the heat of cooking, releasing the red pigment.|$|E
5|$|The soft, dense {{feathers}} {{are kept}} in good condition by preening. The red waxy tips are the extended and flattened ends of feather shafts, pigmented with <b>astaxanthin</b> and enclosed in a transparent sheath. A study of the cedar waxwings showed that the red tips are few or absent until {{the third year of}} life for that related species. All adult waxwings have a complete moult annually between August and January. Juveniles moult at the same time but retain their flight and some other wing feathers.|$|E
25|$|The crab's blue hue {{stems from}} a number of {{pigments}} in the shell, including alpha-crustacyanin, which interacts with a red pigment, <b>astaxanthin,</b> to form a greenish-blue coloration. When the crab is cooked, the alpha-crustacyanin breaks down, leaving only the <b>astaxanthin,</b> which turns the crab to a bright purple.|$|E
25|$|Farm-raised salmon are fed the {{carotenoids}} <b>astaxanthin</b> and canthaxanthin {{to match}} their flesh colour to wild salmon to improve their marketability.|$|E
25|$|In most cases, the <b>astaxanthin</b> is made chemically; {{alternatively}} it {{is extracted}} from shrimp flour. Another possibility {{is the use}} of dried red yeast or microalgae, which provide the same pigment. However, synthetic mixtures are the least expensive option. <b>Astaxanthin</b> is a potent antioxidant that stimulates the development of healthy fish nervous systems and enhances the fish's fertility and growth rate. Canthaxanthin may have negative effects on the human eye, accumulating in the retina at high levels of consumption.|$|E
25|$|Farm raised {{salmonids}} {{are also}} fed the carotenoids <b>astaxanthin</b> and canthaxanthin, {{so that their}} flesh colour matches wild salmon, which also contain the same carotenoid pigments from their diet in the wild.|$|E
25|$|The radioles of {{different}} species of Canalipalpata vary widely in color. Those of the serpulid tubeworms are typically red, pink, or orange in color, with white transverse bands. <b>Astaxanthin,</b> a carotenoid pigment, {{is responsible for the}} bright red color of the crown of Serpula vermicularis.|$|E
25|$|Salmon {{flesh is}} {{generally}} orange to red, although white-fleshed wild salmon with white-black skin colour occurs. The natural colour of salmon results from carotenoid pigments, largely <b>astaxanthin,</b> but also canthaxanthin, in the flesh. Wild salmon get these carotenoids from eating krill and other tiny shellfish.|$|E
25|$|Cooks boil or steam live lobsters. When {{a lobster}} is cooked, its shell's colour changes from blue to orange because {{the heat from}} cooking breaks down a protein called crustacyanin, which {{suppresses}} the orange hue of the chemical <b>astaxanthin,</b> which {{is also found in}} the shell.|$|E
25|$|The {{egg mass}} (roe) is usually green, {{but may also}} have yellow, red, or brown coloration. Pigment {{components}} present in the eggs include bilin and carotenoids such as idoxanthin, crustaxanthin, and vitamin A2 aldehyde (3-dehydroretinal). The bilin and retinal produces the base green color, {{and the amount of}} relative idoxanthin content is the key determinant of the color variation. Study of its prey (such as the amphipods) or the fish's stomach contents reveal negligible traces of idoxanthin and crustaxanthin, which means the fish must be internally converting other carotenoid substances such as <b>astaxanthin</b> that are abundant in their food into idoxanthin and crustaxanthin, given that fish in general cannot build their own carotenoid wholly out of building block materials. Researchers hypothesize that the intake of <b>astaxanthin</b> influences the idoxanthin concentration in the body, which result in the egg color change.|$|E
25|$|When extended, these heavily ciliated radioles trap {{particles}} {{of organic matter}} and transport it towards the mouth. While they are primarily feeding structures, the radioles also serve as respiratory organs. The radioles of different Serpula species are typically red, pink, or orange in color, with white transverse bands. <b>Astaxanthin,</b> a carotenoid pigment, {{is responsible for the}} bright red color of the crown of S. vermicularis. There are usually about 40 radioles in an adult.|$|E
500|$|<b>Astaxanthin</b> is {{the main}} {{carotenoid}} in marine crustaceans (and fish). [...] It {{has been shown that}} adding <b>astaxanthin</b> to the feed can improve the skin and muscle colour of marine organisms and thereby increase their commercial and ornamental value.|$|E
500|$|The {{color and}} {{flavor of the}} flesh depends on the diet and {{freshness}} of the trout. [...] Farmed trout and some populations of wild trout, especially anadromous steelhead, have reddish or orange flesh {{as a result of}} high <b>astaxanthin</b> levels in their diets. <b>Astaxanthin</b> is a powerful antioxidant that may be from a natural source or a synthetic trout feed. [...] Rainbow trout raised to have pinker flesh from a diet high in <b>astaxanthin</b> are sometimes sold in the U.S. with labeling calling them [...] "steelhead". [...] As wild steelhead are in decline in some parts of their range, farmed rainbow are viewed as a preferred alternative. [...] In Chile and Norway, rainbow trout farmed in saltwater sea cages are sold labeled as steelhead.|$|E
2500|$|Salmon - {{flesh is}} {{generally}} orange to red, {{although there are}} some examples of white-fleshed wild salmon. The natural colour of salmon results from carotenoid pigments, largely <b>astaxanthin</b> but also canthaxanthin, in the flesh. Wild salmon get these carotenoids from eating krill and other tiny shellfish. Because consumers have shown a reluctance to purchase white-fleshed salmon, <b>astaxanthin</b> (E161j), and very minutely canthaxanthin (E161g), are added as artificial colourants to the feed of farmed salmon, because prepared diets do not naturally contain these pigments.|$|E
2500|$|Today, the {{concentration}} of carotenoids (mainly canthaxanthin and <b>astaxanthin)</b> exceeds 8 mg/kg of flesh, and all fish producers try to reach a level that represents a value of 16 on the [...] "Roche Colour Card", a colour card used to show how pink the fish will appear at specific doses. This scale is specific for measuring the pink colour due to <b>astaxanthin</b> and {{is not for the}} orange hue obtained with canthaxanthin. The development of processing and storage operations, which can be detrimental on canthaxanthin flesh concentration, has led to an increased quantity of pigments added to the diet to compensate for the degrading effects of the processing. In wild fish, carotenoid levels of up to 25mg are present, but levels of canthaxanthin are, in contrast, minor.|$|E
2500|$|Flesh {{from these}} animals is often commercially sold in {{restaurants}} as [...] "langostino" [...] or sometimes dishonestly called [...] "lobster" [...] when incorporated in seafood dishes. As {{well as being}} used for human consumption, there is demand for squat lobster meat to use as feed in fish farms and shrimp or prawn farms. This is {{in part because they}} contain <b>astaxanthin,</b> a pigment that helps to colour the meat of farmed salmon and trout.|$|E
50|$|<b>Astaxanthin</b> has two chiral centers, at the 3- and 3&prime;-positions. Therefore, {{there are}} three stereoisomers; (3R,3&prime;R), (3R,3&prime;S) (meso), and (3S,3&prime;S). Synthetic <b>astaxanthin</b> {{contains}} a mixture of the three, in approximately 1:2:1 proportions. Naturally occurring <b>astaxanthin</b> varies considerably from one organism to another. The <b>astaxanthin</b> in fish is of whatever stereoisomer the fish ingested. The <b>astaxanthin</b> produced by Haematococcus pluvialis, which is commonly used in the feed of animals that are in turn consumed by humans, is the (3S,3&prime;S) stereoisomer.|$|E
50|$|Phaffia yeast Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous {{exhibits}} 100% free, non-esterified <b>astaxanthin,</b> {{which is}} considered advantageous because it is readily absorbable and need not be hydrolysed in the digestive tract of the fish. In contrast to synthetic and bacteria sources of <b>astaxanthin,</b> yeast sources of <b>astaxanthin</b> consist mainly of the (3R, 3’R)-form, an important <b>astaxanthin</b> source in nature. Finally, the geometrical isomer, all-E, is higher in yeast sources of <b>astaxanthin,</b> as compared to synthetic sources. This contributes to greater efficacy because the all-E (trans) isomer has greater bio-availability than the cis isomer.|$|E
5000|$|Nearly all {{commercial}} <b>astaxanthin</b> for aquaculture {{is produced}} synthetically, {{with an annual}} turnover of over $200 million and a selling price of roughly $5000-6000 per kilo as of July 2012. [...] However, synthetic production of <b>astaxanthin</b> is not preferred in some cases because synthetic <b>astaxanthin</b> contains a mixture of stereoisomers. <b>Astaxanthin</b> is fairly abundant and obtainable from natural sources, and some consumers prefer natural products over synthetic ones.|$|E
50|$|Algae are {{the primary}} natural source of <b>astaxanthin</b> in the aquatic food chain. Currently, the primary {{industrial}} source for natural <b>astaxanthin</b> is the microalgae Haematococcus pluvialis. Haematococcus pluvialis seems to accumulate {{the highest levels of}} <b>astaxanthin</b> in nature. Commercially, more than 40 g of <b>astaxanthin</b> can be obtained from one kg of dry biomass. Haematococcus pluvialis has the advantage of the population doubling every week, which means scaling up is not an issue. However, it does require some expertise to grow the algae with a high <b>astaxanthin</b> content. Specifically, the microalgae are grown in two phases. First, in the green phase, the cells are given an abundance of nutrients to promote proliferation of the cells. In the subsequent red phase, the cells are deprived of nutrients and subjected to intense sunlight to induce encystment (carotogenesis), during which the cells produce high levels of <b>astaxanthin</b> as a protective mechanism against the environmental stress. The cells, with their high concentrations of <b>astaxanthin,</b> are then harvested.|$|E
50|$|The cost of <b>astaxanthin</b> production, high {{commercial}} {{price and}} lack of a leading fermentation production systems, combined with the shortfalls of chemical synthesis mean that research into alternative fermentation production methods has been carried out. Metabolic engineering offers the opportunity to create biological systems {{for the production of}} a specific target compound. The metabolic engineering of bacteria (Escherichia coli) recently allowed production of <b>astaxanthin</b> at >90% of the total carotenoids, providing the first engineered production system capable of efficient <b>astaxanthin</b> production. <b>Astaxanthin</b> biosynthesis proceeds from beta-carotene via either zeaxanthin or canthaxanthin. Historically, it has been assumed that <b>astaxanthin</b> biosynthesis proceeds along both routes. However, recent work has suggested that efficient biosynthesis may, in fact, proceed from beta-carotene to <b>astaxanthin</b> via zeaxanthin. The production of <b>astaxanthin</b> by metabolic engineering, in isolation, will not provide a suitable alternative to current commercial methods. Rather, a bioprocess approach should be adopted. Such an approach would consider fermentation conditions and economics, as well as downstream processing (extraction). Carotenoid extraction has been studied extensively, for example, the extraction of canthaxanthin (a precursor to <b>astaxanthin)</b> was studied within an E. coli production process demonstrating that extraction efficiency was increased substantially when two solvents, acetone and methanol, were used sequentially rather than as a combined solution.|$|E

50|$|While <b>astaxanthin</b> is {{a natural}} dietary component, {{it can also be}} used as a food {{supplement}}. The supplement is intended for human, animal, and aquaculture consumption. The industrial production of <b>astaxanthin</b> comes from both natural and synthetic sources.|$|E

50|$|<b>Astaxanthin</b> {{is found}} in microalgae, yeast, salmon, trout, krill, shrimp, crayfish, crustaceans, and the {{feathers}} of some birds. It provides the red color of salmon meat and the red color of cooked shellfish. Professor Basil Weedon's group {{was the first to}} prove the structure of <b>astaxanthin</b> by synthesis, in 1975.|$|E
50|$|<b>Astaxanthin</b> {{is present}} in most red-coloured aquatic organisms. The content varies from species to species, but also from {{individual}} to individual as it is highly dependent on diet and living conditions. <b>Astaxanthin,</b> and other chemically related asta-carotenoids, has also been found {{in a number of}} lichen species of the arctic zone.|$|E
50|$|Director of the institutes, Avigad Vonshak, made {{headlines}} for his discovery, together with Prof. Sammy Boussiba (also of the institutes) of <b>astaxanthin</b> accumulation in green algae. <b>Astaxanthin</b> {{is an extremely}} valuable poly-unsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) which is valued for its use as a pigment, nutritional value, and possible use in bio-diesel.|$|E
50|$|In April 2009, the United States Food and Drug Administration {{approved}} <b>astaxanthin</b> as an additive {{for fish}} feed {{only as a}} component of a stabilized color additive mixture. Color additive mixtures for fish feed made with <b>astaxanthin</b> may contain only those diluents that are suitable. The color additives <b>astaxanthin,</b> ultramarine blue, canthaxanthin, synthetic iron oxide, dried algae meal, Tagetes meal and extract, and corn endosperm oil are approved for specific uses in animal foods. Haematococcus algae meal (21 CFR 73.185) and Phaffia yeast (21 CFR 73.355) for use in fish feed to color salmonoids were added in 2000.|$|E

5000|$|The primary natural {{sources for}} {{commercial}} production of <b>astaxanthin</b> comprise the following: ...|$|E
50|$|A common {{carotenoid}} {{in animals}} is <b>astaxanthin,</b> which gives off a purple-blue and green pigment. Astaxanthin’s color is formed by creating complexes with proteins {{in a certain}} order. For example, the crustochrin has approximately 20 <b>astaxanthin</b> molecules bonded with protein. When the complexes interact by exciton-exciton interaction, it lowers the absorbance maximum, changing the different color pigments.|$|E
5000|$|The {{primary use}} of {{synthetic}} <b>astaxanthin</b> today is as an animal feed additive to impart coloration, including farm-raised salmon and egg yolks. [...] Synthetic carotenoid pigments colored yellow, red or orange represent about 15-25% {{of the cost}} of production of commercial salmon feed. Today, almost all commercial <b>astaxanthin</b> for aquaculture is produced synthetically from petrochemical sources.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Astaxanthin</b> [...] is a keto-carotenoid. It {{belongs to}} a larger class of {{chemical}} compounds known as terpenes (in Asthaxanthin's case, a tetraterpenoid); terpenes are built from five carbon precursors; isopentenyl diphosphate (or IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (or DMAPP). <b>Astaxanthin</b> is classified as a xanthophyll (originally derived from a word meaning [...] "yellow leaves" [...] since yellow plant leaf pigments were the first recognized of the xanthophyll family of carotenoids), but currently employed to describe carotenoid compounds that have oxygen-containing moities, hydroxyl (-OH) or ketone (C=O), such as zeaxanthin and canthaxanthin. Indeed, <b>astaxanthin</b> is a metabolite of zeaxanthin and/or canthaxanthin, containing both hydroxyl and ketone functional groups.|$|E
