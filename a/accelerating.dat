The fidelity of the non <b>accelerated</b> information increases as the entanglement of the initial quantum channel increases, while the accelerations of the quantum channel has a little effect.

In the EM case, the dipole radiation reaction field can exert a force on an <b>accelerated</b> monopole charge associated with the <b>accelerated</b> dipole. The radiation reaction of an <b>accelerated</b> charge does not exert a torque on an <b>accelerated</b> magnetic dipole, but an <b>accelerated</b> dipole does exert a force on the charge.

40|$|To {{determine}} if an abnormality {{exists in the}} sympathetic nervous system of patients with <b>accelerated</b> hypertension, we recorded muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) from the tibial nerve by microneurography in eight benign essential hypertensives and seven <b>accelerated</b> essential hypertensives. Basal MSNA, plasma renin activity, and plasma angiotensin II levels were significantly higher in <b>accelerated</b> hypertensives than in benign hypertensives (P < 0. 05). To clarify {{the relationship between the}} renin-angiotensin axis and sympathetic nervous system in the <b>accelerated</b> hypertensives, we measured the MSNA after 7 d of oral administration of captopril (75 mg/d) for antihypertensive treatment in the benign hypertensives and <b>accelerated</b> hypertensives. After administering captopril, the arterial pressure decreased significantly in the benign hypertensives and <b>accelerated</b> hypertensives with decreases in plasma angiotensin II levels, and the decreases in arterial pressure were greater in the <b>accelerated</b> hypertensive than in the benign hypertensives. After captopril administration, the MSNA decreased significantly in the <b>accelerated</b> hypertensives but did not change in the benign hypertensives. Thus, in <b>accelerated</b> hypertensives, sympathetic tone is elevated, and the elevated sympathetic tone is closely related to the activated renin-angiotensin axis tone...|$|R

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of tripartite entanglement of fermionic system in noninertial frames through linear contraction criterion when {{one or two}} observers are <b>accelerated</b> is investigated. In one observer <b>accelerated</b> case the entanglement measurement is not invariant {{with respect to the}} partial realignment of different subsystems and for two observers <b>accelerated</b> case it is invariant. It is shown that the acceleration of the frame does not generate entanglement in any bipartite subsystems. Unlike the bipartite states, the genuine tripartite entanglement does not completely vanish in both one observer <b>accelerated</b> and two observers <b>accelerated</b> cases even in the limit of infinite acceleration. The degradation of tripartite entanglement is fast when two observers are <b>accelerated</b> than when one observer is <b>accelerated.</b> It is shown that tripartite entanglement is a better resource for quantum information processing than the bipartite entanglement in noninertial frames.

40|$|We {{show that}} {{standard}} Relativistic Dynamics Equation F=dp/dτ is only partially covariant. To achieve full Lorentz covariance, we replace the four-force F by a rank 2 antisymmetric tensor {{acting on the}} four-velocity. By taking this tensor to be constant, we obtain a covariant definition of uniformly <b>accelerated</b> motion. We compute explicit solutions for uniformly <b>accelerated</b> motion which are divided into four types: null, linear, rotational, and general. For null acceleration, the worldline is cubic in the time. Linear acceleration covariantly extends 1 D hyperbolic motion, while rotational acceleration covariantly extends pure rotational motion. We use Generalized Fermi-Walker transport to construct a uniformly <b>accelerated</b> family of inertial frames which are instantaneously comoving to a uniformly <b>accelerated</b> observer. We explain the connection between our approach and that of Mashhoon. We show that our solutions of uniformly <b>accelerated</b> motion have constant acceleration in the comoving frame. Assuming the Weak Hypothesis of Locality, we obtain local spacetime transformations from a uniformly <b>accelerated</b> frame K' to an inertial frame K. The spacetime transformations between two uniformly <b>accelerated</b> frames with the same acceleration are Lorentz. We compute the metric at an arbitrary point of a uniformly <b>accelerated</b> frame. We obtain velocity and acceleration transformations from a uniformly <b>accelerated</b> system K' to an inertial frame K. We derive the general formula for the time dilation between <b>accelerated</b> clocks. We obtain a formula for the angular velocity of a uniformly <b>accelerated</b> object. Every rest point of K' is uniformly <b>accelerated,</b> and its acceleration {{is a function of}} the observer's acceleration and its position. We obtain an interpretation of the Lorentz-Abraham-Dirac equation as an acceleration transformation from K' to K. Comment: 36 page...|$|R
