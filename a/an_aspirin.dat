5|$|While Walter and Agent Astrid Farnsworth (Jasika Nicole) {{ensure that}} the witness is safe at the hospital, Olivia takes Peter back to the lab. Peter, {{suffering}} from a headache, takes <b>an</b> <b>aspirin</b> and drinks out of what he believes to be an ordinary bottle of milk from the fridge. In reality, the milk contains a serum developed by Walter {{in order to help}} him recover his full mental function. However, the serum was incorrectly prepared, which causes Peter to begin convulsing. Over the phone, Walter directs Olivia to inject Peter with the correct compounds in order to save his life. Walter realizes that the serum would have killed him if he had consumed it, and that this was another step in the Observer's plot. Later that evening, September meets with another Observer, and identifies the fact that Walter was able to let Peter go, despite believing that he may not survive, and that when the time comes, they can expect Walter to do it again.|$|E

Holding <b>an</b> <b>aspirin</b> tablet next to a painful tooth in an attempt to relieve pulpitis (toothache) is common, and leads to epithelial necrosis. Chewable aspirin tablets should be swallowed, with the residue quickly cleared from the mouth.|$|E

500|$|There {{are many}} causes of {{toothache}} and its diagnosis is a specialist topic, meaning that attendance at a dentist is usually required. Since {{many cases of}} toothache are inflammatory in nature, over the counter non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may help (unless contraindicated, such as [...] with a peptic ulcer). [...] Generally, NSAIDs are as effective as aspirin alone or in combination with codeine. However, simple analgesics may have little effect on some causes of toothache, and the severe pain can drive individuals to exceed the maximum dose. For example, when acetaminophen (paracetamol) is taken for toothache, an accidental overdose {{is more likely to}} occur when compared to people who are taking acetaminophen for other reasons. Another risk in persons with toothache is a painful chemical burn of the oral mucosa caused by holding a caustic substance such as aspirin tablets and toothache remedies containing eugenol (such as clove oil) against the gum. Although the logic of placing a tablet against the painful tooth is understandable, <b>an</b> <b>aspirin</b> tablet needs to be swallowed to have any pain-killing effect. Caustic toothache remedies require careful application to the tooth only, without coming into excessive contact with the soft tissues of the mouth.|$|E

40|$|Dual {{effects of}} aspirin were {{demonstrated}} in guinea-pig lungs: (<b>a)</b> <b>aspirin</b> (3. 3 mg/kg i. v.) antagonized bronchoconstriction induced by slow reacting substance of anaphylaxis (SRS-A); (b) aspirin produced bronchoconstriction when injected {{in the presence}} of propranolol into guinea-pigs in vivo at 330 mg/kg, or into guinea-pig isolated lungs in vitro as a 4 % solution (40 mg/ml). 2 The severity of bronchoconstriction following administration of aspirin was directly related to the degree of beta-adrenoceptor blockade and to the age of the guinea-pigs. Aspirin-induced bronchoconstriction was prevented in vivo and in vitro by atropine and it could be reversed in vivo by atropine. Aspirin-induced bronchoconstriction was not inhibited by vagotomy or phenoxybenzamine. 3 These data suggest that the mechanism involved in aspirin-induced bronchoconstriction may be local cholinergic stimulation and that reduced beta-adrenergic drive may be a predisposing factor...|$|R

5000|$|According to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), [...] "ibuprofen can {{interfere}} with the antiplatelet effect of low-dose aspirin, potentially rendering aspirin less effective when used for cardioprotection and stroke prevention." [...] Allowing sufficient time between doses of ibuprofen and immediate-release (IR) aspirin can avoid this problem. The recommended elapsed time between a dose of ibuprofen and <b>a</b> dose of <b>aspirin</b> depends on which is taken first. It would be 30 minutes or more for ibuprofen taken after IR aspirin, and eight hours or more for ibuprofen taken before IR aspirin. However, this timing cannot be recommended for enteric-coated aspirin.
