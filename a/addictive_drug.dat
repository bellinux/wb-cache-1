5|$|Methamphetamine (meth), {{a highly}} <b>addictive</b> <b>drug</b> that {{produces}} {{a dramatic increase in}} energy and euphoria, can have negative health effects that include serious dental problems. , it is the most discussed illegal drug in dental literature. The most notable effect of long-term use of methamphetamine on dental health is the development of caries (tooth decay); the teeth of some drug users appear to be dark and in the process of disintegrating. Caries often occur in the cervical regions of teeth, where the tooth surface narrows at the junction of the crown and the root. It is usually found on the buccal (cheek) side of the teeth and on tooth surfaces that are adjacent to incisors and canines; eventually, the coronal tooth area, near the crown, can be affected by the decay and erosion. The dental caries of meth mouth often progress slowly, perhaps because their advancement is hindered by intermittent hygienic practices. The decay can lead to tooth fractures and severe pain. In some cases, teeth are permanently damaged and must be removed. Along with malnutrition and weight loss, the dental effects of methamphetamine use contribute to the appearance of premature aging seen in some users. The effects of meth mouth {{are similar to those of}} Sjögren's syndrome, an autoimmune disease that causes a lack of saliva, which results in tooth decay.|$|E

40|$|How do <b>addictive</b> <b>drugs</b> hijack the brain's reward system? This review speculates how normal, {{physiological}} reward processes may {{be affected}} by <b>addictive</b> <b>drugs.</b> <b>Addictive</b> <b>drugs</b> affect acute responses and plasticity in dopamine neurons and postsynaptic structures. These effects reduce reward discrimination, increase the effects of reward prediction error signals, and enhance neuronal responses to reward-predicting stimuli, which may contribute to compulsion. <b>Addictive</b> <b>drugs</b> steepen neuronal temporal reward discounting and create temporal myopia that impairs the control of drug taking. Tonically enhanced dopamine levels may disturb working memory mechanisms necessary for assessing background rewards and thus may generate inaccurate neuronal reward predictions. Drug-induced working memory deficits may impair neuronal risk signaling, promote risky behaviors, and facilitate preaddictive drug use. Malfunctioning adaptive reward coding may lead to overvaluation of drug rewards. Many of these malfunctions may result in inadequate neuronal decision mechanisms and lead to choices biased toward drug rewards...|$|R

500|$|In {{the reward}} system, reward is the {{attractive}} and motivational property of a stimulus that induces appetitive behavior [...] (also known as approach behavior) – and consummatory behavior. A rewarding stimulus {{is one that}} has the potential to cause an approach to it and a choice to be made to consume it or not. Pleasure, learning (e.g., classical and operant conditioning), and approach behavior are the three main functions of reward. As an aspect of reward, pleasure provides a definition of reward; however, while all pleasurable stimuli are rewarding, not all rewarding stimuli are pleasurable (e.g., extrinstic rewards like money). The motivational or desirable aspect of rewarding stimuli is reflected by the approach behavior that they induce, whereas the pleasurable component of intrinstic rewards is derived from the consummatory behavior that ensues upon acquiring them. [...] A neuropsychological model which distinguishes these two components of an intrinsically rewarding stimulus is the incentive salience model, where [...] "wanting" [...] or desire (less commonly, [...] "seeking") corresponds to appetitive or approach behavior while [...] "liking" [...] or pleasure corresponds to consummatory behavior.}} In human drug addicts, [...] "wanting" [...] becomes dissociated with [...] "liking" [...] as the desire to use an <b>addictive</b> <b>drug</b> increases, while the pleasure obtained from consuming it decreases due to drug tolerance.|$|E

2500|$|Chronic <b>addictive</b> <b>drug</b> use causes {{alterations}} in gene {{expression in the}} mesocorticolimbic projection. [...] The most important transcription factors that produce these alterations are ΔFosB, cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB). ΔFosB {{is the most significant}} biomolecular mechanism in addiction because the overexpression of ΔFosB in the D1-type medium spiny neurons in the nucleus accumbens is necessary and sufficient for many of the neural adaptations and behavioral effects (e.g., expression-dependent increases in drug self-administration and reward sensitization) seen in drug addiction. ΔFosB expression in nucleus accumbens D1-type medium spiny neurons directly and positively regulates drug self-administration and reward sensitization through positive reinforcement while decreasing sensitivity to [...] Specific drug addictions in which ΔFosB has been implicated in addictions to alcohol, amphetamine, cannabinoids, cocaine, methylphenidate, nicotine, phenylcyclidine, propofol, opiates, and substituted amphetamines, among others.

Increases in nucleus accumbens ΔJunD expression (via viral vector-mediated gene transfer) or G9a expression (via pharmacological means) reduces, or with a large increase can even block, many of the neural and behavioral alterations seen in chronic drug abuse (i.e., the alterations mediated by ΔFosB).|$|E
2500|$|Positive and {{negative}} reinforcement play central {{roles in the}} development and maintenance of addiction and drug dependence. An <b>addictive</b> <b>drug</b> is intrinsically rewarding; that is, it functions as a primary positive reinforcer of drug use. The brain's reward system assigns it incentive salience (i.e., it is [...] "wanted" [...] or [...] "desired"),An important dimension of reinforcement highly relevant to the addiction process (and particularly relapse) is secondary reinforcement (Stewart, 1992). Secondary reinforcers (in many cases also considered conditioned reinforcers) likely drive the majority of reinforcement processes in humans. In the specific case of drug , cues and contexts that are intimately and repeatedly associated with drug use will often themselves become reinforcing... A fundamental piece of Robinson and Berridge's incentive-sensitization theory of addiction posits that the incentive value or attractive nature of such secondary reinforcement processes, in addition to the primary reinforcers themselves, may persist and even become sensitized over time in league with the development of drug addiction (Robinson and Berridge, 1993)....Negative reinforcement is a special condition associated with a strengthening of behavioral responses that terminate some ongoing (presumably aversive) stimulus. In this case we can define a negative reinforcer as a motivational stimulus that strengthens such an “escape” response. Historically, in relation to drug addiction, this phenomenon has been consistently observed in humans whereby drugs of abuse are self-administered to quench a motivational need in the state of withdrawal (Wikler, 1952).}} so as an addiction develops, deprivation of the drug leads to craving. [...] In addition, stimuli associated with drug use– e.g., the sight of a syringe, and the location of use– become associated with the intense reinforcement induced by the drug. These previously neutral stimuli acquire several properties: their appearance can induce craving, and they can become conditioned positive reinforcers of continued use. Thus, if an addicted individual encounters one of these drug cues, a craving for the associated drug may reappear. For example, anti-drug agencies previously used posters with images of drug paraphernalia as an attempt to show the dangers of drug use. However, such posters are no longer used because of the effects of incentive salience in causing relapse upon sight of the stimuli illustrated in the posters.|$|E
