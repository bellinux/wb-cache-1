5|$|Mr. Burns and Smithers take a train back to Springfield after {{attending}} the annual Harvard-Yale football game. The train makes an unexpected stop {{and a man}} named Larry comes up to the train and tries to sell merchandise. He sees Mr. Burns and takes out an old picture {{of a man who}} looks similar and compares the two. Suddenly the train pulls away, leaving Larry behind. Meanwhile, the Simpson family are on their way home from visiting a cider mill and see Larry hitchhiking. After much discussion, the family picks up the hitchhiker. Larry asks the Simpsons <b>about</b> <b>Mr.</b> Burns and they agree to take Larry to his house. In Springfield, Larry visits Mr. Burns' estate and reveals that he is Burns' son.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Mr. Glowery, {{a bitter}} New York City {{journalist}} and writer {{who believes that}} a rival author is sabotaging his literary career, arrives in Tyburn where he is to speak at a fiction workshop being held at the Admiral Benbow Inn. He is immediately tasered by one of Castro's detectives, who mistakenly confuses him for Picasso. Back at the Admiral Benbow Inn, the innkeeper, George Hawthorne, worries <b>about</b> <b>Mr.</b> Briscoe, a cross-dressing contract worker who is stranded in the abandoned lighthouse just off the coast because of the raging nor'easter, while his unhappy wife, Magdalene Hawthorne, threatens to leave him. The next morning, Mr. Glowery is stuck in a restaurant where he is being coerced by a psychotic cook to peddle his novel {{in order to pay}} off a debt he incurred during the night. When Professor Eggman, the director of the fiction workshop, comes across Mr. Glowery, he rescues him and brings him back to the inn. However, few people show up for the fiction workshop because of the storm. Hawthorne's wife returns from a spa with Picasso; Mr. Hawthorne informs her that he is trying to procure a prostitute for his new arrival, Jesus Castro, who has registered under the false name of Mr. Wassermann. Mr. Hawthorne asks Picasso if he has had sex with his wife and Picasso meekly admits to it.|$|E

25|$|A second {{investigation}} {{was led by}} former Ohio Attorney General, Betty Montgomery.

25|$|At {{the end of}} the war, he was {{a member}} of the small force which escorted Jan Smuts to the peace negotiations. He then {{disguised}} himself as an Afrikaans-speaking Boer, taking a job as a wagon driver working for the German colonial forces in South West Africa. This intelligence work ended unsuccessfully when he was identified, but managed to escape. This escapade later led to claims that he became the model for Richard Hannay, a character in the novels of John Buchan; Ironside was always amused by these novels when reading <b>about</b> <b>Mr</b> Standfast in the implausibly romantic setting of the passenger seat of an open-cockpit biplane flying from Iraq to Persia.|$|E

Meanwhile, Wilf tries his schemes to stop Pat, not realising that Pat going around Greendale {{is in fact a}} robot. The more Pat's family and friends become concerned, the more Pat feels guilty about coming on the contest in the first place. And despite Pat's efforts to tell his wife the truth about why he entered the competition, he fails and starts to become fearful that he might have pushed his family away. It isn't until shortly after Pat's departure that some people in Greendale discover that there appears to be more than one Pat and Edwin Carbunkle's true intent is exposed.

500|$|New York Times critic Frank Rich {{said of the}} 1992 London production: [...] "What is {{remarkable}} <b>about</b> <b>Mr.</b> Hytner's direction, aside from its unorthodox faith in the virtues of simplicity and stillness, {{is its ability to}} make a 1992 audience believe in Hammerstein's vision of redemption, which has it that a dead sinner can return to Earth to do godly good." [...] The Hytner production in New York was hailed by many critics as a grittier Carousel, which they deemed more appropriate for the 1990s. [...] Clive Barnes of the New York Post called it a [...] "defining Carousel—hard-nosed, imaginative, and exciting." ...|$|E

500|$|Beck {{submitted}} a supplemental filing {{in the case}} on October 13, 2009. In the supplemental filing, his attorneys argued that the joke of the Eiland-Hall website was not obvious; therefore, the website's domain name was misleading. The filing asserted: [...] "While there is absolutely nothing humorous or amusing about the statement made by Respondent in his domain name that 'Glenn Beck Raped and Murdered a Young Girl in 1990,' the average Internet user finding the domain name GlennBeckRapedAndMurderedAYoungGirlin1990.com ("Disputed Domain Name") in a search would have {{no reason not to}} believe that they will be directed to a website providing factual information (as opposed to protected criticism or similar protected speech) <b>about</b> <b>Mr.</b> Beck." ...|$|E

Thompson also said, [...] "the 'social commentary' on this album is akin to a sociopath's discharging his AK-47 into a crowded schoolyard, with the machine gun bursts interrupted by Pee-wee Herman's views on politics".|$|E

500|$|Ian Maxtone-Graham {{wrote the}} episode {{and it was}} his first writing credit for The Simpsons, {{although}} he had served as a consultant on the show for several months. Maxtone-Graham had previously worked with showrunners Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein on a game show and the two had wanted to hire him as a writer on The Simpsons. The episode started out as a story <b>about</b> <b>Mr.</b> Burns and Grampa both being stationed in Paris during World War II and falling in love with the same woman, who had a love child. Maxtone-Graham had wanted this episode to be about Burns having a child, which is where it went. The other episode idea became 'Raging Abe Simpson and His Grumbling Grandson in [...] "The Curse of the Flying Hellfish"', which aired in the previous season. The episode opens with the family visiting Mt. Swartzwelder Historic Cider Mill because the writers had wanted to do something involving autumn and a cider mill seemed like a good setting for that.|$|E
500|$|Critics were {{generally}} unimpressed with the series premiere. Mike Hale of the New York Times critically panned the episode, writing, [...] "An interesting drama {{could be made}} <b>about</b> <b>Mr.</b> Hefner's success in fusing sex, privilege and pseudo-cool into a wildly successful commercial empire during a conservative time, but The Playboy Club sets out to do much less, and succeeds." [...] Similarly, Seth Amitin of IGN gave the episode a 4.5 out of ten, signifying a [...] "bad" [...] rating. Amitin stated that he was disappointed with its delivery, opining that while there were some potential in the show, it would [...] "take a lot more work to get this show off the ground." [...] Meredith Blake of The A.V. Club reacted mildly to the episode, expressing that it was [...] "glossy" [...] but dull and mediocre. Fellow writer Phil Nugent echoed similar sentiments, writing, [...] "The only outrageous thing about The Playboy Club is the scale of its miscalculated reverence for the sanctimonious mythology it's trying to peddle." [...] In conclusion, Blake and Nugent gave the episode a 'C' grade.|$|E
500|$|Unbeknownst to {{the rest}} of town, Mr. Garrison relives a {{traumatic}} childhood memory in which a young Gifford defeated him in a national talent show.

Meanwhile, Cartman is excited to appear on live television, and Mayor McDaniels instructs him to get into shape for Gifford's visit. Seeing a television commercial for a bodybuilding supplement called [...] "Weight Gain 4000", Cartman asks his mother to buy it for him. Cartman becomes extremely fat from the product, although he believes he is in excellent shape and the excess weight is strictly muscle. Back at the school, Wendy looks through Mr. Garrison's papers and confirms Cartman indeed cheated on the contest by writing his name on a copy of Walden by Henry David Thoreau. Wendy also learns <b>about</b> <b>Mr.</b> Garrison's assassination plan, and enlists the help of her friend Stan to stop him.|$|E

500|$|Sesame Street head writer Norman Stiles {{was chosen}} to write the {{segments}} <b>about</b> <b>Mr.</b> Hooper's death. [...] The episode focused on {{the life cycle of}} birth and death by also mentioning the birth of a baby, and by remembering Mr. Hooper. [...] Stiles said, [...] "We decided to say that while Mr. Hooper was not here anymore, we will always have that part of him that lives within the heart, that we have our love and that it will always stay". [...] Stiles wanted to convey that expressing grief for someone who had died was difficult for both adults and children. [...] Instead of providing an explanation, the adults of Sesame Street tell Mr. Hooper's friend Big Bird, when he asked why Mr. Hooper had died, that there was no real reason, that it happened, as Gordon tells Big Bird, [...] "Just because". [...] The show's outside experts advised Stiles and the producers to remove the line because they were concerned that an open-ended explanation would not be enough for children, but Stiles kept the line because it was an acknowledgement, as Gikow stated, that there is never a good explanation about why people die.|$|E
500|$|Similar to {{what they}} had done with other social issues and in {{developing}} their curriculum, the CTW researched the topic of death and how preschoolers understand it. [...] The first step in their research process was to assemble a team of experts, led by CTW research director Lewis Bernstein, in the fields of child psychology, child development, and religion. [...] The team advised the show's writers and producers how to handle the topic, in what they called [...] "a curriculum bath"; Bernstein described it in this way: [...] "We bring in the experts to allow the writer to soak in expertise. [...] We in Research bring in people to provide the information, and then the artistry of the writer takes over, as they integrate what they've heard". [...] The experts advised the producers to provide their viewers with a sense of closure <b>about</b> <b>Mr.</b> Hooper's death. [...] They decided not to focus on how Mr. Hooper died, since explaining that he was old and ill might increase children's fears about death. [...] They chose to deal with his death in a single episode, and convey simple messages like: [...] "Mr. Hooper is dead; Mr. Hooper will not be coming back; and Mr. Hooper will be missed by all". [...] Gikow stated that the episode they created was an example of the writers and producers' skills as educators as well as entertainers.|$|E
500|$|According to Davis, Sesame Streets second decade {{was spent}} [...] "turning inward, {{expanding}} its young viewers' world". [...] The show's curriculum grew {{to include more}} [...] "affective" [...] teaching—relationships, ethics, and positive and negative emotions. [...] Many of the show's storylines {{were taken from the}} experiences of its writing staff, cast, and crew. [...] In 1982, Will Lee, who had played Mr. Hooper since the show's premiere, died. [...] For the 1983 season, the show's producers and research staff decided they would explain Mr. Hooper's death to their preschool audience, instead of recasting the role: the writer of that episode, Norman Stiles, said, [...] "We felt we owed something to a man we respected and loved". [...] They convened a group of psychologists, religious leaders, and other experts in the field of grief, loss, and separation. [...] The research team conducted a series of studies before the episode to ascertain if children were able to understand the messages they wanted to convey <b>about</b> <b>Mr.</b> Hooper's death; the research showed most children did understand. [...] Parents' reactions to the episode were, according to the CTW's own reports, [...] "overwhelmingly positive". [...] The episode, which won an Emmy, aired on Thanksgiving Day in 1983 so parents could be home to discuss it with their children. [...] Author David Borgenicht called the episode [...] "poignant"; Davis called it [...] "a landmark broadcast" [...] and [...] "a truly memorable episode, one of the show's best". [...] Caroll Spinney, who played Big Bird and who drew the caricatures prominently used in the episode, reported the cast and crew were moved to tears during filming.|$|E
