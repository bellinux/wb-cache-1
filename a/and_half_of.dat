5|$|About 150 {{million people}} {{developed}} a {{urinary tract infection}} each year. They are more common in women than men. In women, {{they are the most}} common form of bacterial infection. Up to 10% of women have a urinary tract infection in a given year <b>and</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> women having at least one infection at some point in their lives. They occur most frequently between the ages of 16 and 35years. Recurrences are common. Urinary tract infections have been described since ancient times with the first documented description in the Ebers Papyrus dated to c. 1550 BC.|$|E
5|$|By 18 March, Jourdan {{had formed}} his {{headquarters}} at Pfullendorf, on the heights above Ostrach. In {{front of him}} stood the largest part of his cavalry <b>and</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> his infantry. The center, including the 4th Regiment of Hussars, the 1st of Chasseurs à Cheval, and two squadrons of the 17th Dragoons, lay behind Ostrach, under command of General Klein. Jourdan distributed them in three columns, the strongest on the post road by Saulgau, another {{on the road in}} the direction of Altshausen, and a third at the hamlet of Friedberg.|$|E
5|$|In 1754, William Skrimshire {{purchased}} Great Gilwell, Little Gilwell, <b>and</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> Osborne's estate, including Osborne Hall. Skrimshire demolished Osborne Hall {{and built}} a new residence, which he also called Osborne Hall. That building is now called the White House. Timbers in the White House can be dated to this time, but not to any previous era. Leonard Tresilian (?–1792) bought the estate in 1771 and expanded the land holdings {{and size of the}} residence.|$|E

5|$|In October 2012, an ICSID {{tribunal}} {{awarded a}} judgment of $1.8 billion for Occidental Petroleum {{against the government}} of Ecuador. Additionally, Ecuador had to pay $589 million in backdated compound interest <b>and</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> {{the costs of the}} tribunal, making its total penalty around $2.4 billion. The South American country annulled a contract with the oil firm {{on the grounds that it}} violated a clause that the company would not sell its rights to another firm without permission. The tribunal agreed the violation took place but judged that the annulment was not fair and equitable treatment to the company.|$|E
5|$|Jerome had a {{post office}} by 1883. It added a schoolhouse in 1884 and a public library in 1889. After four major fires between 1894 and 1898 {{destroyed}} much of the business district <b>and</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the community's homes, Jerome was incorporated as a town in 1899. Incorporation {{made it possible to}} collect taxes to build a formal fire-fighting system and to establish building codes that prohibited tents and other fire hazards within the town limits. Local merchant and rancher William Munds was the first mayor.|$|E
5|$|September 21, 1938– The New England Hurricane of 1938 {{passes to}} the east of the state, causing strong winds of up to 100mph (160km) and {{powerful}} waves along the coastline.

5|$|Some 5,000,000 half dollars were struck, {{far beyond}} the actual demand, <b>and</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> them were melted. The {{appropriation}} did not cure the fair's financial woes, as fewer than 400,000 were sold at the premium price, and some 2,000,000 were released into circulation, where they remained {{as late as the}} 1950s. The pieces can be purchased in circulated condition for less than $20; coins in near-pristine state sell for about $1,000, far less than the $10,000 the makers of the Remington Typewriter paid as a publicity stunt in 1892 for the first specimen struck.|$|E
5|$|The A-10 is {{exceptionally}} tough, {{being able}} to survive direct hits from armor-piercing and high-explosive projectiles up to 23mm. It has double-redundant hydraulic flight systems, and a mechanical system as a back up if hydraulics are lost. Flight without hydraulic power uses the manual reversion control system; pitch and yaw control engages automatically, roll control is pilot-selected. In manual reversion mode, the A-10 is sufficiently controllable under favorable conditions to return to base, though control forces are greater than normal. The aircraft is designed to fly with one engine, one half of tail, one elevator, <b>and</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> a wing missing.|$|E
5|$|The {{isolation}} of the island and its diversity of habitats and microclimates have favoured the diversification of a highly endemic flora: Of the 850 known native plant species, 230 are endemic, <b>and</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> those are endangered. This native flora is found at various altitudes. Nearly as many exotic plants as native ones, 830, have become naturalised on the island, and 50 are considered invasive, threatening native flora and habitats.|$|E

5|$|The {{spandrel}} {{plates were}} welded to the columns {{to create the}} modular pieces off-site at the fabrication shop. The modular pieces were typically 52inches (1.3m) deep, and extended for two full floors <b>and</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> two more floors. Adjacent modules were bolted together, with the splices occurring at mid-span of the columns and spandrels. The spandrel plates were located at each floor, transmitting shear stress between columns, allowing them {{to work together in}} resisting lateral loads. The joints between modules were staggered vertically, so the column splices between adjacent modules were not at the same floor.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{programme}} evaluations {{have found that}} many resettled refugees have been the victims of verbal or physical attacks in the UK. The Home Office's 2009 evaluation notes that between one-quarter <b>and</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> each of four groups of Liberian and Congolese refugees resettled under the programme had suffered verbal or physical harassment. An evaluation undertaken by academics at Sheffield Hallam University for the Home Office in 2011 found that one-fifth of the refugees surveyed for the evaluation (who {{had been in the}} UK for a year) had been the victims of verbal or physical attacks in their first six months in the UK, and just over a fifth had been attacked in the second six months of their resettlement. Many of the victims of this abuse had not reported it to the authorities, and the authors of the evaluation suggest that this is a reason why there was a gap between the perceptions of refugee and service providers, who generally suggested that community relations were good. Verbal and physical attacks against refugees were also noted in the 2013 Motherwell evaluation.|$|E

5|$|Another refit {{followed}} on 12 December 1925– 11 July 1927. The {{elevation of}} the main battery guns was again increased, the bow section of the belt armor was removed, <b>and</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> her boilers were converted to oil-firing models. A third and final modernization began on 20 September 1931 and lasted until 20 August 1934. The rest of the coal-fired boilers were replaced with six Indret oil-fired boilers, new turbines and main battery guns were installed, along with eight new 75mm anti-aircraft guns. After emerging from the refit, Provence and Bretagne {{were assigned to the}} 2nd Squadron in the Atlantic. There, they joined fleet exercises off the Azores, Madeira, and Morocco. The two ships took part in a cruise to Africa in 1936. In August, they were involved in non-intervention patrols after the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War; these patrols lasted until April 1937.|$|E
5|$|Because sea {{conditions}} were so rough, {{the decision was}} made for the 116th RCT to carry the DD tanks of the 743rd tank battalion {{all the way to the}} beach, after 27 of the initial 29 DD tanks of the 741st tank battalion swamped while wading to shore. Coming in opposite the heavily defended Vierville draw, Company B of the 743rd Tank Battalion lost all but one of its officers <b>and</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> its DD tanks. The other two companies landed to the left of B/743 without initial loss. On the 16th RCT front, the two DD tanks from the 741st tank battalion that had survived the swim ashore were joined by three others that were landed directly onto the beach because of their LCT's damaged ramp. The remaining tank company managed to land 14 of its 16 tanks (although three of these were quickly knocked out).|$|E
5|$|Cortés {{arrived in}} Honduras in 1525, {{bringing}} livestock with him. Cortés claimed jurisdiction over Honduras, although its extent was still unknown. He rapidly imposed his {{authority over the}} rival Spanish factions there, {{as well as some}} native groups. He founded the settlement of Natividad de Nuestra Señora near Puerto de Caballos, settled fifty colonists there, and placed Diego de Godoy in charge. Cortés then sailed on to Trujillo. Conditions in Natividad were unhealthy, <b>and</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the Spanish settlers rapidly succumbed to disease. With the permission of Cortés, the rest moved inland to the fertile Naco Valley, where Sandoval had securely established a Spanish presence.|$|E

5|$|He quickly formed another {{band called}} Sahara Dust, which later {{developed}} into the symphonic metal band Epica. His place {{was taken by}} Bas Maas, {{who had been the}} guitar technician for After Forever during the tours of 2001 and 2002. August and September 2002 were dedicated to a European tour, supporting Finnish act Nightwish and attending some rock festivals, which exposed the band to larger audiences and gained them even more favourable press. Further media exposure came from Floor Jansen's collaboration with Dutch multi-instrumentalist and composer Arjen Anthony Lucassen, for the recording of Star One's album Space Metal and the subsequent tour in late 2002. Jansen's activities, as well as the regular jobs and studies of the After Forever band members, reduced the band's live performances for the rest of 2002 <b>and</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> 2003. It was known that the band was working at a new album from the beginning of 2003, but their first release was the EP Exordium in October 2003, containing an instrumental track, three new songs and two covers.|$|E
5|$|However, if a {{preference}} set is non-convex, then some prices determine a budget-line that supports two separate optimal-baskets. For example, {{we can imagine}} that, for zoos, a lion costs {{as much as an}} eagle, and further that a zoo's budget suffices for one eagle or one lion. We can suppose also that a zoo-keeper views either animal as equally valuable. In this case, the zoo would purchase either one lion or one eagle. Of course, a contemporary zoo-keeper does not want to purchase half of an eagle <b>and</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> a lion (or a griffin)! Thus, the zoo-keeper's preferences are non-convex: The zoo-keeper prefers having either animal to having any strictly convex combination of both.|$|E
5|$|In the 1830s, the Whigs {{split from}} the Democratic-Republicans in {{response}} to national policies. The Whigs held a strong majority in the General Assembly in that decade. In 1843, {{the remnants of the}} old slavery party had strengthened into the Democratic Party and swept into power, the Whigs never regained their majority and the Democrats maintained power until the middle of the American Civil War. In 1836 the General Assembly passed the Mammoth Internal Improvement Act and set plans into motion to modernize the state's infrastructure. The wilderness of northern and central Indiana was slowly developed as the General Assembly approved the construction of roads, canals, railroads, and numerous other infrastructure projects. This led the state to near bankruptcy in the late 1830s, but it was avoided when the General Assembly spun off the failing canals, <b>and</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> their debts, to private companies in 1841. The failure of the projects was the main factor in the Whig's loss of power.|$|E
