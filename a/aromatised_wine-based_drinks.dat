2500|$|The Regulation {{laying down}} general rules on the definition, {{description}} and presentation of aromatised wines, <b>aromatised</b> <b>wine-based</b> <b>drinks</b> and aromatised wine-product cocktails (No1601/91) institutes {{a system of}} protected denominations for aromatised drinks which {{is very similar to}} that for spirits. The association of general names with specific countries is weaker: a drink labelled simply [...] "Sangria" [...] must have been produced in Spain or Portugal, for example, but it is permissible to label a drink [...] "Sangria produced in the United Kingdom: aromatised wine-based drink" [...] if the drink meets the other requirements to be described as sangria. Similarly, the denomination [...] "Clarea" [...] on its own is reserved for drinks produced in Spain. The protected geographical designations are: ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Aromatised</b> <b>wine-based</b> aperitifs are a {{range of}} {{beverages}} related to vermouth but can be flavoured with many botanicals including cinchona bark (the source of quinine), gentian root and fruit, and typically don't contain wormwood, or flavours of wormwood, that vermouths historically have. Two types include Quinquina and Americano.|$|R
5000|$|Byrrh is an <b>aromatised</b> <b>wine-based</b> apéritif made of red wine, mistelle, and quinine. Created in 1866 and a {{trademark}} since 1873, it was popular as a French apéritif. With its marketing and {{reputation as a}} [...] "hygienic drink", Byrrh sold well in the early 20th century. It was even exported, despite the similarity of its name to [...] "beer", complicating sales in English- and German-language speaking regions.|$|R

5000|$|Dubonnet is a sweet, <b>aromatised</b> <b>wine-based</b> {{aperitif}} with 15% alcohol by volume. It is a {{blend of}} fortified wine, herbs, and spices (including a small amount of quinine), with fermentation being stopped by the addition of alcohol. The brand is currently produced in France by Pernod Ricard, and in the USA by Heaven Hill Distilleries of Bardstown, Kentucky. The company says it is the [...] "number-one selling aperitif brand in the United States". The beverage is famous in the UK for having been the favourite drink of the Queen Mother.|$|R
50|$|The apéritif was {{introduced}} in France in 1846 when a French chemist, Joseph Dubonnet, created his eponymous <b>wine-based</b> <b>drink</b> {{as a means of}} delivering malaria-fighting quinine. The medicine was a bitter brew, so he developed a formula of herbs and spices to mask quinine's sharp flavor, and it worked so well that the recipe has remained well-guarded ever since. French Foreign Legion soldiers made use of it in mosquito-infested Northern Africa. Dubonnet's wife was so fond of the drink that she had all her friends try it, and its popularity spread.|$|R
50|$|Romans called breakfast jentaculum (or ientaculum). It {{was usually}} {{composed}} of everyday staples like bread, cheese, olives, salad, nuts, raisins, and cold meat {{left over from}} the night before. They also <b>drank</b> <b>wine-based</b> <b>drinks</b> such as mulsum, a mixture of wine, honey, and aromatic spices. First-century Latin poet Martial said that jetaculum was eaten at 3:00 or 4:00 in the morning, while 16th-century scholar Caludius Saumaise wrote that it was typically eaten at 9:00 or 10:00 a.m. It seems unlikely that any fixed time was truly assigned for this meal.|$|R
5000|$|Tinto de verano (literally [...] "red wine of summer") is a cold, <b>wine-based</b> <b>drink</b> {{similar to}} sangria. It is popular in Spain. [...] The drink is simpler than sangria, {{normally}} {{made up of}} 1 part of table red wine and 1 part gaseosa. Gaseosa is a general term for sodas and carbonated drinks, but the preferred mixer is a mild-flavored, low-sugar, carbonated lemonade, of which La Casera is the best known brand. Proportions vary according to taste. Traditional-flavored gaseosa can be replicated by mixing Sprite or 7-Up with carbonated water.|$|R
