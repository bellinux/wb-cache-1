5|$|The {{ruins of}} St Peter's Church are a {{memorial}} to the civilians and auxiliary personnel killed in the aerial bombing of Bristol, and a plaque on its wall lists their names. Adjoining the church is a sensory herb garden and The Normandy Garden of Peace, which was opened on 5 November 1995, with five Silver Birch trees, managed by Bristol's D-Day veterans, {{in memory of the}} five D-Day beaches.

5|$|After a punitive {{operation}} {{was conducted in}} the surrounding villages, during which 422males were shot and four villages burned down, another 70male Jews and communists who had been arrested in Kragujevac were shot. Simultaneously, males {{between the ages of}} 16and 60, including high school students, were assembled by German troops and local collaborators, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> were selected from amongst them. The selected males were then marched to fields outside the city, shot with heavy machine guns, and their bodies buried in mass graves. Contemporary German military records indicate that 2,300hostages were shot. After the war, inflated estimates ranged as high as 7,000deaths, but German and Serbian scholars have now agreed on the figure of nearly 2,800killed, including 144high school students. As well as Serbs, other massacre victims included Jews, Romani people, Muslims, Macedonians, Slovenes and members of other nationalities.|$|E

According to the most recent accounts included also in The Black Book of Communism (Harvard University Press, 1999), 12,578 people were put to death from 29 August to 5 September 1924. About 20,000 people were deported to Siberia and Central Asian deserts.|$|E

All had their throats slit from ear to ear, with such great force that they were nearly decapitated. Thousands of dollars' worth of marijuana and money were left covering their mutilated bodies, and $5,000 was left at the scene. The local district attorney said that it appeared that the killer <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> knew each other, and that the murders were not random.|$|E

Only sometime later, with the beginning of twilight, could they see the aircraft <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> on the sea surface. They rushed to the accident site by boat, rescuing some passengers, including flight attendant Rospars, who held a five-month old infant girl Roxane on her lap, and the baby's mother, to the island shore. Meanwhile, crew members and some passengers tried to swim the distance to the island in order to call for relief. Alerted by the lighthouse keeper, customs officers and fishermen sailed towards the scene, picking survivors on the water.|$|E
25|$|The {{disaster}} gained {{attention from}} the national media. Offers of assistance came {{in from all over}} the country. Several funds were established to handle donations, particularly the Texas City Relief Fund, created by the city's mayor Curtis Trahan. One of the largest fundraising efforts for the city <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> of the disaster was organized by Sam Maceo, one of the two brothers who ran organized crime in Galveston at the time. Maceo organized a large-scale benefit on the island featuring some of the most famous entertainers of the time including Phil Harris, Frank Sinatra, and Ann Sheridan. In the end, the Texas City Relief Fund raised more than $1 million ($ in today's terms). Payouts for fire insurance claims reached nearly $4 million ($ in today's terms).|$|E
25|$|Not all {{procedures}} {{before the}} Hof had an adversarial character. The Hof could act as arbiter {{in cases of}} voluntary arbitration {{at the request of}} parties. Also, in a number of cases there was just one party, without an adversary, who needed a particular judicial or executive action performed. Examples of the latter were the conveyancing of titles of real estate, both voluntary (in case of sale) and involuntary (in case of foreclosure). The Hof acted then as Notary. Another example was the remissiebrief of people who had received a pardon in criminal cases. This remissiebrief was the certificate stating the pardon and this had to be endorsed (interineerd) by the Hof (after a procedure in which the validity of the pardon was tested, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> in the crime were asked if they had been adequately indemnified by the pardoned criminal).|$|E

30|$|As {{described}} earlier, as {{the number}} of hops between a router in <b>the</b> attack path <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> increases, <b>the</b> mark information of that specific router is less likely to survive; so from the perspective of <b>the</b> <b>victim,</b> <b>the</b> farthermost router has the lowest chance to deliver its mark in the attack path. One solution to cancel this problem is to use variable marking probability for each router, based on the distance between <b>the</b> current router <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> [30]. However, <b>the</b> hard part is how to find the number of hops between two ends.|$|R
