5|$|Individuals {{infected}} with H. pylori have a 10 to 20% lifetime {{risk of developing}} peptic ulcers and a 1 to 2% risk of acquiring stomach cancer. Inflammation of the pyloric <b>antrum</b> {{is more likely to}} lead to duodenal ulcers, while inflammation of the corpus (body of the stomach) is more likely to lead to gastric ulcers and gastric carcinoma. However, H. pylori possibly plays a role only in the first stage that leads to common chronic inflammation, but not in further stages leading to carcinogenesis. A meta-analysis conducted in 2009 concluded the eradication of H. pylori reduces gastric cancer risk in previously infected individuals, suggesting the continued presence of H. pylori constitutes a relative risk factor of 65% for gastric cancers; in terms of absolute risk, the increase was from 1.1% to 1.7%.|$|E
5|$|The stomach has the {{characteristic}} pattern of sigmodontines (unilocular-hemiglandular); {{it is not}} split in two chambers by an incisura angularis and the front part (<b>antrum)</b> is covered by a glandular epithelium. The gall bladder is absent, a synapomorphy (shared-derived character) of Oryzomyini. The karyotype includes 56chromosomes and a fundamental number of 60chromosomal arms (2n=56, FN=60). The form of the sex chromosomes {{has been used to}} distinguish the marsh rice rat from Oryzomys couesi, but may be too variable among Oryzomys species to be useful in differentiating them. X chromosome inactivation occurs in the marsh rice rat, though the animal lacks LINE-1 retrotransposons, which have been suggested as components of the inactivation process. Mutants with fused or additional molars and with light fur have been recorded in laboratory colonies; the abnormal molars are apparently the result of a single autosomal recessive mutation. At about 50%, hematocrit (the proportion of red blood cells in the blood) is high in the marsh rice rat compared to other rodents; this may be an adaptation that enables the rice rat to increase oxygen capacity while swimming under water.|$|E
25|$|Gastric outlet {{obstruction}} is a {{narrowing of}} the pyloric canal by scarring and {{swelling of the}} gastric <b>antrum</b> and duodenum due to peptic ulcers. The person often presents with severe vomiting without bile.|$|E
25|$|An {{increase}} in cumulus cell number causes a concomitant {{increase in}} <b>antrum</b> fluid volume that can swell the follicle to over 20mm in diameter. It forms a pronounced bulge {{at the surface}} of the ovary called the blister.|$|E
25|$|The pylorus is {{the furthest}} {{part of the}} stomach that connects to the duodenum. It {{is divided into two}} parts, the <b>antrum,</b> which connects to the body of the stomach, and the pyloric canal, which connects to the duodenum.|$|E
25|$|The inner oblique layer: This {{layer is}} {{responsible}} for creating the motion that churns and physically breaks down the food. It is the only layer of the three which is not seen {{in other parts of}} the digestive system. The <b>antrum</b> has thicker skin cells in its walls and performs more forceful contractions than the fundus.|$|E
500|$|The {{inflammatory}} response caused by bacteria colonizing near the pyloric <b>antrum</b> induces G {{cells in the}} <b>antrum</b> to secrete the hormone gastrin, which travels through the bloodstream to parietal cells in the fundus. Gastrin stimulates the parietal cells to secrete more acid into the stomach lumen, and over time increases the number of parietal cells, as well. [...] The increased acid load damages the duodenum, which may eventually result in ulcers forming in the duodenum.|$|E
500|$|In people {{producing}} {{large amounts}} of acid, H. pylori colonizes near the pyloric <b>antrum</b> (exit to the duodenum) to avoid the acid-secreting parietal cells at the fundus (near {{the entrance to the}} stomach). [...] In people producing normal or reduced amounts of acid, H. pylori can also colonize the rest of the stomach.|$|E
500|$|The {{karyotype}} {{has been}} recorded in various populations of the marsh rice rat and O.couesi and is apparently stable [...] within the genus at 56chromosomes, with the fundamental number of chromosomal arms ranging from 56 to 60 (2n=56, FN=56–60). In both species, the stomach has the characteristic pattern of sigmodontines (unilocular-hemiglandular): it is not split in two chambers by an incisura angularis and the front part (<b>antrum)</b> is covered by a glandular epithelium. Furthermore, the gall bladder is absent, a synapomorphy of Oryzomyini.|$|E

The gall bladder is absent, a synapomorphy (shared-derived character) of Oryzomyini. The karyotype includes 56chromosomes and a fundamental number of 56 autosomal arms (2n=56, FNa=56). The autosomes include 26 pairs of acrocentric chromosomes, with a long and a very short arm, and one medium-sized submetacentric pair, with one arm shorter than the other. [...] The X chromosome is either acrocentric, with a long and a short arm, or subtelocentric, with a long and a vestigial arm. The form of the sex chromosomes {{has been used to}} distinguish the marsh rice rat from Oryzomys couesi, but there are no consistent differences between the two.|$|E
2500|$|The pyloric <b>antrum</b> is {{the initial}} {{portion of the}} pylorus. It is {{near the bottom of}} the stomach, {{proximal}} to the pyloric sphincter, which separates the stomach and the duodenum. [...] It may temporarily become partially or completely shut off from the remainder of the stomach during digestion by peristaltic contraction of the prepyloric sphincter; it is demarcated, sometimes, from the pyloric canal by a slight groove.|$|E
2500|$|The pylorus ( [...] or [...] ), or pyloric part, {{connects the}} stomach to the duodenum. The pylorus is {{considered}} as having two parts, the pyloric <b>antrum</b> (opening {{to the body}} of the stomach) and the pyloric canal (opening to the duodenum). The pyloric canal ends as the pyloric orifice, which marks the junction between the stomach and the duodenum. The orifice is surrounded by a sphincter, a band of muscle, called the pyloric sphincter.|$|E
2500|$|For {{persistent}} {{symptoms and}} disease {{in patients who}} have failed medical and the functional endoscopic approaches, older techniques {{can be used to}} address the inflammation of the maxillary sinus, such as the Caldwell-luc antrostomy. [...] This surgery involves an incision in the upper gum, opening in the anterior wall of the <b>antrum,</b> removal of the entire diseased maxillary sinus mucosa and drainage is allowed into inferior [...] or middle meatus by creating a large window in the lateral nasal wall.|$|E
2500|$|Mucous gland metaplasia, the {{reversible}} {{replacement of}} differentiated cells, {{occurs in the}} setting of severe damage of the gastric glands, which then waste away (atrophic gastritis) and are progressively replaced by mucous glands. Gastric ulcers may develop; it is unclear if they are the causes or the consequences. [...] Intestinal metaplasia typically begins in response to chronic mucosal injury in the <b>antrum,</b> and may extend to the body. Gastric mucosa cells change to resemble intestinal mucosa and may even assume absorptive characteristics. Intestinal metaplasia is classified histologically as complete or incomplete. With complete metaplasia, gastric mucosa is completely transformed into small-bowel mucosa, both histologically and functionally, with the ability to absorb nutrients and secrete peptides. In incomplete metaplasia, the epithelium assumes a histologic appearance closer to that of the large intestine and frequently exhibits dysplasia.|$|E

60|$|Lucian [168] lets us {{know that}} Europa the mother of Minos was worshipped {{by the name of}} Rhea, the form of a woman sitting in a chariot drawn by lions, with a drum in her hand, and a Corona turrita on her head, like Astarte and Isis; and the Cretans [169] anciently shewed the house where this Rhea lived: and [170] Apollonius Rhodius tells us, that Saturn, while he Reigned over the Titans in Olympus, a {{mountain}} in Crete, and Jupiter was educated by the Curetes in the Cretan cave, deceived Rhea, and of Philyra begot Chiron: and therefore the Cretan Saturn and Rhea, were but one Generation older than Chiron, and by consequence not older than Asterius and Europa, the parents of Minos; for Chiron lived 'till after the Argonautic Expedition, and had two grandsons in that Expedition, and Europa came into Crete above an hundred years before that Expedition: Lucian [171] tells us, that the Cretans did not only relate, that Jupiter was born and buried among them, but also shewed his sepulchre: and Porphyry [172] tells us, that Pythagoras went down into the Idæan cave, to see sepulchre: and Cicero, [173] in numbering three Jupiters, saith, that the third was the Cretan Jupiter, Saturn's son, whose sepulchre was shewed in Crete: and the Scholiast upon Callimachus [174] lets us know, that this was the sepulchre of Minos: his words are, Εν Κρητη επι τωι ταφωι του Μινωος επεγεγραπτο, ΜΙΝΩΟΣ ΤΟΥ ΔΙΟΣ ΤΑΦΟΣ. τωι χρονωι δε του Μινωος απηλειφθη, ‛ωστε περιλειφθηναι, ΔΙΟΣ ΤΑΦΟΣ. εκ τουτου ουν εχειν λεγουσι Κρητες τον ταφον του Διος. In Crete upon the Sepulchre of Minos was written Minois Jovis sepulchrum: but in time Minois wore out so that there remained only, Jovis sepulchrum, and thence the Cretans called it the Sepulchre of Jupiter. By Saturn, Cicero, who was a Latine, understood the Saturn so called by the Latines: for when Saturn was expelled his Kingdom he fled from Crete by sea, to Italy; and this the Poets exprest by saying, that Jupiter cast him down to Tartarus, that is, into the Sea: and because he lay hid in Italy, the Latines called him Saturn; and Italy, Saturnia, and Latium, and themselves Latines: so [175] Cyprian; <b>Antrum</b> Jovis in Creta visitur, & sepulchrum ejus ostenditur: & ab eo Saturnum fugatum esse manifestum est: unde Latium de latebra ejus nomen accepit: hic literas imprimere, hic signare nummos in Italia primus instituit, unde ærarium Saturni vocatur; & rusticitatis hic cultor fuit, inde falcem ferens senex pingitur: and Minutius Felix; Saturnus Creta profugus, Italiam metu filii sævientis accesserat, & Jani susceptus hospitio, rudes illos homines & agrestes multa docuit, ut Græculus & politus, literas imprimere, nummos signare, instrumenta conficere: itaque latebram suam, quod tuto latuisset, vocari maluit Latium, & urbem Saturniam de suo nomine. * * Ejus filius Jupiter Cretæ excluso parente regnavit, illic obiit, illic filios habuit; adhuc <b>antrum</b> Jovis visitur, & sepulchrum ejus ostenditur, & ipsis sacris suis humanitatis arguitur: and Tertullian; [176] Quantum rerum argumenta docent, nusquam invenio fideliora quam apud ipsam Italiam, in qua Saturnus post multas expeditiones, postque Attica hospitia consedit, exceptus ab Jano, vel Jane ut Salii volunt. Mons quem incoluerat Saturnius dictus: civitas quam depalaverat Saturnia usque nunc est. Tota denique Italia post Oenotriam Saturnia cognominabatur. Ab ipso primum tabulæ, & imagine signatus nummus, & inde ærario præsidet. By Saturn's carrying letters into Italy, and coyning money, and teaching agriculture, and making instruments, and building a town, you may know that he fled from Crete, after letters, and the coyning of money, and manual arts were brought into Europe by the Phœnicians; and from Attica, after agriculture was brought into Greece by Ceres; and so could not be older than Asterius, and Europa, and her brother Cadmus: and by Italy's being called Oenotria, before it was called Saturnia, you may know that he came into Italy after Oenotrus, and so was not older than the sons of Lycaon. Oenotrus carried the first colony of the Greeks into Italy, Saturn the second, and Evander the third; and the Latines know nothing older in Italy than Janus and Saturn: and therefore Oenotrus was the Janus of the Latines, and Saturn was contemporary to the sons of Lycaon, and by consequence also to Celeus, Erechtheus, Ceres, and Asterius: for Ceres educated Triptolemus the son of Celeus, in the Reign of Erechtheus, and then taught him to plow and sow corn: Arcas the son of Callisto, and grandson of Lycaon, received corn from Triptolemus, and taught his people to make bread of it; and Procris, the daughter of Erechtheus, fled to Minos the son of Asterius. In memory of Saturn's coming into Italy by sea, the Latines coined their first money with his head on one side, and a ship on the other. Macrobius [177] tells us, that when Saturn was dead, Janus erected an Altar to him, with sacred rites as to a God, and instituted the Saturnalia, and that humane sacrifices were offered to him; 'till Hercules driving the cattle of Geryon through Italy, abolished that custom: by the human sacrifices you may know that Janus was of the race of Lycaon; which character agrees to Oenotrus. Dionysius Halicarnassensis tells us further, that Oenotrus having found in the western parts of Italy a large region fit for pasturage and tillage, but yet for the most part uninhabited, and where it was inhabited, peopled but thinly; in a certain part of it, purged from the Barbarians, he built towns little and numerous, in the mountains; which manner of building was familiar to the ancients: and this was the Original of Towns in Italy.|$|E
