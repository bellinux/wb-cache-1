50|$|About 35-50% {{of humans}} possess C. albicans {{as part of}} their normal oral microbiota. With more {{sensitive}} detection techniques, this figure is reported to rise to 90%. This candidal carrier state is not considered a disease, since there are no lesions or symptoms of any kind. Oral carriage of Candida is pre-requisite for the development of oral candidiasis. For Candida species to colonize and survive as a normal component of the oral microbiota, the organisms must be capable of adhering to the epithelial surface of the mucous membrane lining the mouth. This adhesion involves adhesins (e.g., hyphal wall protein 1), and extracellular polymeric materials (e.g., mannoprotein). Therefore, strains of Candida with more <b>adhesion</b> <b>capability</b> have more pathogenic potential than other strains. The prevalence of Candida carriage varies with geographic location, and many other factors. Higher carriage is reported during the summer months, in females, in hospitalized individuals, in persons with blood group O and in non-secretors of blood group antigens in saliva. Increased rates of Candida carriage are also found in people who eat a diet high in carbohydrates, people who wear dentures, people with xerostomia (dry mouth), in people taking broad spectrum antibiotics, smokers, and in immunocompromised individuals (e.g., due to HIV/AIDS, diabetes, cancer, Down syndrome or malnutrition). Age also influences oral carriage, with the lowest levels occurring in newborns, increasing dramatically in infants, and then decreasing again in adults. Investigations have quantified oral carriage of Candida albicans at 300-500 colony forming units in healthy persons. More Candida is detected in the early morning and the late afternoon. The greatest quantity of Candida species are harbored on the posterior dorsal tongue, followed by the palatal and the buccal mucosae. Mucosa covered by an oral appliance such as a denture harbors significantly more candida species than uncovered mucosa.|$|E

The {{objective of this}} study was to investigate the effect of aflatoxin B 1 on <b>adhesion</b> <b>capability</b> of Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain GG using a Caco- 2 adhesion model. Removal of aflatoxin B 1 by L. rhamnosus strain GG reduced the <b>adhesion</b> <b>capability</b> of this strain from 30 % to 5 %. It is therefore concluded that aflatoxins may influence the adhesion properties of probiotics able to sequester them, and subsequently these bacteria may reduce the accumulation of aflatoxins in the intestine via increased excretion of an aflatoxin-bacteria complex. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Purpose. The {{purpose of}} this study is to compare the <b>adhesion</b> <b>capabilities</b> of the most {{important}} etiologic agents of microbial ocular infection to the recently available silicone–hydrogel lenses with those to a conventional hydrogel lens. Methods. In vitro static adhesion assays of Pseudomonas aeruginosa 10, 145, Staphylococcus epidermidis 9142 (biofilm-positive), and 12, 228 (biofilm-negative) to two extended-wear silicone–hydrogel lenses (balafilcon A and lotrafilcon A), a daily wear silicone–hydrogel lens (galyfilcon A) and a conventional hydrogel (etafilcon A) were performed. To interpret the adhesion results, lens surface relative hydrophobicity was assessed by water contact angle measurements. Results. P. aeruginosa and S. epidermidis 9142 exhibited greater <b>adhesion</b> <b>capabilities</b> to the extended wear silicone–hydrogel lenses than to the daily wear silicone – and conventional hydrogel lenses (p < 0. 05). No statistical differences were found between the adhesion extent of these strains to galyfilcon A and etafilcon A.

Total hemocyte count (THC), hemocyte volume, phagocytic activity, lysozyme-like activity in both hemocyte lysate (HL) and cell-free hemolymph (CFH) were measured. As unexpected alterations in hemocyte <b>adhesion</b> <b>capability</b> were observed in short-term hemocyte cultures for phagocytosis assays after a 1 -day exposure, an adhesion test (not included in the original experimental setup) was performed after 7 and 12 days of exposure only. The survival-in-air test was carried out to evaluate general stress conditions in B(a) P-exposed clams. No alterations in THC was observed, whereas exposure for 7 and 12 days to B(a) P significantly decreased phagocytic activity and <b>adhesion</b> <b>capability</b> when compared with controls. Significant decreases in lysozyme activity were observed in CFH and HL, with respect to controls. B(a) P was also shown to alter the resistance to air exposure of clams.

Determination of growth limits indicated that all seven strains were able to grow in up to 11 % NaCl in rain heart infusion and 3 g l(- 1) yeast extract-glucose at 20 degrees C, but no growth was detected at 15 % NaCl. Adhesion of L. monocytogenes was estimated after 4 -h incubation at 20 degrees C in 96 -well microtitre plates. Statistical results revealed {{no significant difference between}} adhesion to polystyrene and stainless steel although surface properties were different. Adhesion between 0 % and 6 % NaCl was not different, whereas adhesion at 11 % NaCl was significantly lower.

The two filters were compared with colony counts of bacteria in the filters and bottles. At the same time, the filters and adhered bacteria were monitored by scanning electron microscope. RESULTS: Electron microscopic examination of filters showed that the Portex filter had a granular and the Rusch filter fibrillary structure. Colony counting from the catheter and bottle showed that both of the filters have significant bacterial <b>adhesion</b> <b>capability</b> (p < 0. 001).

It is also closely connected to many biological activities of cancer cells, such as growth, invasion, adhesion, hematogenous metastasis, and lymphatic metastasis. Fucoidan derived from Undaria pinnatifida sporophylls (Ups-fucoidan) is a sulfated polysaccharide with more biological activities than other fucoidans. However, there is no information on the effects of Ups-fucoidan on tumor invasion and metastasis. We used the mouse hepatocarcinoma Hca-F cell line, which has high invasive and lymphatic metastasis potential in vitro and in vivo, to examine the effect of Ups-fucoidan on cancer cell invasion and metastasis. Ups-fucoidan exerted a concentration- and time-dependent inhibitory effect on tumor metastasis in vivo and inhibited Hca-F cell growth, migration, invasion, and <b>adhesion</b> <b>capabilities</b> in vitro.

Flow cytometry was used to determine MUC 1 expression on ZR- 75 - 1 and MCF 7 cells, while immunofluorescence microscopy was used to confirm the aberrant form of MUC 1 and MUC 1 :ICAM- 1 interactions. Each cell line was then perfused through combined E-selectin and ICAM- 1 coated microtubes, as a model of the microvascular endothelium.

In this study, CNS recovered from patients with bloodstream infections (BSIs) or prosthetic-device-associated infections (PDAls) were compared in terms of biofilm formation, antimicrobial resistance, clonal distribution, and carriage of adhesin and toxin genes. A total of 226 CNS isolates (168 S. epidermidis and 58 S. haemolyticus) recovered from hospital inpatients with BSIs (100 isolates) or PDAls (126 isolates) were tested for biofilm formation, antimicrobial susceptibility, and mecA, ica operon, adhesin (aap, bap, fnbA, atlE, fbe) and toxin (tst, sea, sec) genes. The selected CNS were classified into pulsotypes by PFGE and assigned to sequence types by multilocus sequence typing. In total, 106 / 226 isolates (46. 9 %) produced biofilm, whereas 150 (66. 4 %) carried the ica operon. Most isolates carried mecA and were multidrug resistant (90. 7 %). CNS recovered from BSIs {{were significantly more likely}} to produce biofilm (P= 0. 003), be resistant to antimicrobials and carry mecA (P 0. 05). Although PFGE revealed genetic diversity, especially among S. epidermidis, analysis of representative strains from the main PFGE types by multilocus sequence typing revealed three major clones (ST 2, ST 5 and ST 16). A clonal relationship was found with respect to antimicrobial susceptibility and ica and aap gene carriage, reinforcing the premise of clonal expansion in hospital settings. The results of this study suggest that the pathogenesis of BSIs is associated with biofilm formation and high-level antimicrobial resistance, whereas PDAls are related to the <b>adhesion</b> <b>capabilities</b> of S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus strains...|$|R
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, the ompC gene, which codifies for the outer {{membrane}} porin C, lpxC, which {{is required for}} lipid A expression, and murA, which is important for external wall synthesis, are not regulated upon interaction with the nanostructured substrates. Also, the fliC gene that codifies for a flagella subunit, as well as cpxR, which is an effector of the two-component system CpxR-A pathway, is not regulated in the treated samples. In this respect, we can envisage that, although nanostructured Au substrates strongly impact the bacterial <b>adhesion</b> <b>capability,</b> the genes codifying for the biofilm expression[27] seem to be unregulated in the early stage of the adhesion event. Further and more systematic studies are {{required in order to}} evaluate any possible influence of nanotopographies on biofilm formation after longer incubation periods. On the other hand, our data suggest that the mechanosensing machinery of E. coli feels the change in surface nanotopography as a physical stress signal. Hence, the bacteria focus their molecular activities on regulating and triggering specific pathways, which are important for recovery from stress conditions.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In this work, {{we studied}} the {{antimicrobial}} properties of a nanocomposite {{system based on}} a lactose-substituted chitosan and silver nanoparticles: Chitlac-nAg. Twofold serial dilutions of the colloidal Chitlac-nAg solution were both tested on Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans, and Streptococcus oralis planktonic phase and biofilm growth mode {{as well as on}} saliva samples. The minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations of Chitlac-nAg were evaluated together with its effect on sessile cell viability, as well as both on biofilm formation and on preformed biofilm. In respect to the planktonic bacteria, Chitlac-nAg showed an inhibitory/bactericidal effect against all streptococcal strains at 0. 1 % (v/v), except for S. mitis ATCC 6249 that was inhibited at one step less. On preformed biofilm, Chitlac-nAg at a value of 0. 2 %, was able to inhibit the bacterial growth on the supernatant phase {{as well as on the}} mature biofilm. For S. mitis ATCC 6249, the biofilm inhibitory concentration of Chitlac-nAg was 0. 1 %. At sub-inhibitory concentrations, the Streptococcal strains <b>adhesion</b> <b>capability</b> on a polystyrene surface showed a general reduction following a concentration-dependent-way; a simila...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to compare the ability of eight Staphylococcus {{epidermidis}} strains to adhere to acrylic and silicone, two polymers normally used in medical devices manufacture. Furthermore, it was tried to correlate that with the surface properties of substrata and cells. Therefore, hydrophobicity and surface tension components were calculated through contact angle measurements. Surface roughness of substrata was also assessed by atomic force microscopy (AFM). No relationship was found between microbial surface hydrophobicity and <b>adhesion</b> <b>capability.</b> Nevertheless, Staphylococcus epidermidis IE 214 showed very unique adhesion behaviour, with cells highly aggregated between them, which is a consequence of their specific surface features. All strains, determined as being hydrophilic, adhered at a higher extent to silicone than to acrylic, most likely due to its more hydrophobic character and higher roughness. This demonstrates the importance of biomaterial surface characteristics for bacterial adhesion. Copyright © 2009 Cláudia Sousa et al.

40|$|Enterococcus faecium {{has emerged}} as a major {{opportunistic}} pathogen for two decades, with the spread of hospital-adapted multidrug-resistant clones. Members of the intestinal microbiota, they are subjected to numerous bacterial stresses, including antibiotics at subinhibitory concentrations (SICs). Since fluoroquinolones are extensively prescribed, SICs are very likely to occur in vivo with potential effects on bacterial metabolism with subsequent modulation of opportunistic traits. The aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate globally the impact of subinhibitory concentrations (SICs) of ciprofloxacin on antimicrobial resistance and pathogenicity of E. faecium Transcriptomic analysis was performed by RNA-seq (HiSeq 2500, Illumina) using the vanB-positive reference strain E. faecium Aus 0004 in the absence or presence of ciprofloxacin SIC (0. 38 mg/L, i. e. MIC 1 / 8). Several genetic and phenotypic tests were used for validation. In the presence of ciprofloxacin SIC, 196 genes were significantly induced whereas 286 were significantly repressed, meaning that 16. 8 % of the E. faecium genome was altered. Amongst upregulated genes, EFAU 004 _ 02294 (fold change of 14. 3) encoded a protein (EfmQnr) homologue of Qnr proteins involved in quinolone resistance in Gram-negative bacilli. Its implication in intrinsic and adaptive FQ resistance in E. faecium was experimentally ascertained. Moreover, EFAU 004 _ 02292 coding for the collagen adhesin Acm was also induced by SIC of ciprofloxacin (fold change of 8. 2), and higher <b>adhesion</b> <b>capabilities</b> were demonstrated phenotypically. Both Efmqnr and Acm determinants may play an important role in the transition from a commensal to a pathogenic state of E. faecium that resides in the gut of patients receiving a fluoroquinolone therapy...|$|R
40|$|The {{composition}} of the gut microflora of Atlantic salmon {{is dependent on the}} environmental conditions such as water temperature and diet. Our recent studies indicate that these bacteria reach their minimum level during the warmer period of the year where opportunistic pathogens such as Vibrios overgrow. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) have been shown to confer many health benefits to the health of fish including exclusion and displacement of pathogenic bacteria in the gut and production of bacteriocins. In this study we isolated and characterised a total of 160 LAB strains from the hindgut of Atlantic salmon from two commercial fish farms and fed either two different diets (farm 1) or four trial diets (farm 2). These strains were sequenced using 16 S rRNA gene universal primers and typed using the PhPlate-LB system. The LAB strains belonged to nine species of which Enterococcus, Pediococcus and Weissella species accounted for 49. 4 % of the total population. Strains found in more than one sampling occasion or in more than one diet were further tested for production of bacteriocin, their <b>adhesion</b> <b>capabilities</b> and potential cytotoxicity to fish cell line ASK. Most of the strains showed low adhesitivity ranging from 2 to 10 CFU/cell) with some strains being also cytotoxic to ASK cells. However, certain strains belonging to E. casseliflavus and W. hellenica showed a high adhesion (19 and 21 CFU/cell respectively). These strains did not produce any cytoxic effect on this fish cell line. Bacteriocin production varied among the strains and their inhibition effect was strain specific. The importance of these strains as probiotic candidates will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|Heparin-binding {{epidermal}} {{growth factor}}-like growth factor (HB-EGF) is an EGF family member expressed by numerous cell types that binds to EGF receptor 1 (HER- 1) or 4 (HER- 4) inducing mitogenic and/or chemotactic activities. Membrane-bound HB-EGF retains growth activity and <b>adhesion</b> <b>capabilities</b> and the unique property {{of being the}} receptor for diphtheria toxin (DT). The interest in studying HB-EGF in acute leukemia stems from these mitogenic, chemotactic, and receptor functions. We analyzed the expression of HB-EGF in L 428, Raji, Jurkat, Karpas 299, L 540, 2 C 8, HL- 60, U 937, THP- 1, ML- 3, and K 562 cell lines and in primary blasts from 12 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases, by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Northern blot and by the evaluation of sensitivity to DT. The release of functional HB-EGF was assessed by evaluation of its proliferative effects on the HB-EGF-sensitive Balb/c 3 T 3 cell line. HB-EGF was expressed by all myeloid and T, but not B (L 428, Raji), lymphoid cell lines tested, {{as well as by}} the majority (8 of 12) of ex vivo AML blasts. Cell lines (except for the K 562 cell line) and AML blasts expressing HB-EGF mRNA underwent apoptotic death following exposure to DT, thus demonstrating the presence of the HB-EGF molecule on their membrane. Leukemic cells also released a fully functional HB-EGF molecule that was mitogenic for the Balb/c 3 T 3 cell line. Factors relevant to the biology of leukemic growth, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), 1 alpha, 25 -(OH) 2 D 3, and especially all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), upregulated HB-EGF mRNA in HL- 60 or ML- 3 cells. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) induced HB-EGF mRNA and acquisition of sensitivity to DT in one previously HB-EGF-negative leukemia case. Moreover, the U 937 and Karpas 299 cell lines expressed HER- 4 mRNA. This work shows that HB-EGF is a growth factor produced by primary leukemic cells and regulated by ATRA, 1 alpha, 25 -(OH) 2 D 3, and GM-CSF...|$|R
