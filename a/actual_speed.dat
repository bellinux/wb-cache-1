5|$|Current {{commonly}} accepted physical theories imply or {{assume the}} photon to be strictly massless. If the photon {{is not a}} strictly massless particle, it would not move at the exact speed of light, c in vacuum. Its speed would be lower and depend on its frequency. Relativity would be unaffected by this; the so-called speed of light, c, would then not be the <b>actual</b> <b>speed</b> at which light moves, but a constant of nature which is the upper bound on speed that any object could theoretically attain in space-time. Thus, {{it would still be}} the speed of space-time ripples (gravitational waves and gravitons), but it would not be the speed of photons.|$|E
5|$|There are {{different}} ways to determine the value of c. One way is to measure the <b>actual</b> <b>speed</b> at which light waves propagate, which {{can be done in}} various astronomical and earth-based setups. However, it is also possible to determine c from other physical laws where it appears, for example, by determining the values of the electromagnetic constants ε0 and μ0 and using their relation to c. Historically, the most accurate results have been obtained by separately determining the frequency and wavelength of a light beam, with their product equalling c.|$|E

In vehicle-mounted systems, {{detection}} equipment and cameras can be mounted {{to the vehicle}} itself, or simply tripod mounted inside the vehicle and deployed out a window or door. If the camera is fixed to the vehicle, the enforcement vehicle does not necessarily have to be stationary, and can be moved either with or against the flow of traffic. In the latter case, depending on the direction of travel, the target vehicle's relative speed is either added or subtracted from the enforcement vehicle's own speed to obtain its <b>actual</b> <b>speed.</b> The speedometer of the camera vehicle needs to be accurately calibrated.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAccelerometers {{are used}} in most robot {{navigation}} systems as sensors for robot speed and localization. Normally, these accelerometers sense the body acceleration, which is integrated to determine the robot velocity, and cumulatively the robot position relative to the starting position. When the robot is moving on a horizontal surface, the computed speed will in general reflect the actual robot speed; however, when the robot is moving on an inclined surface, such as uphill or downhill motions, then the measured speed will include components due to gravity, which {{are not part of}} the <b>actual</b> robot <b>speed.</b> Therefore the computed speed will not reflect the <b>actual</b> robot <b>speed.</b> These gravity components must be compensated for in the speed computations to capture the <b>actual</b> robot <b>speed.</b> This paper proposes a computational approach for elimination of the gravity components from the accelerometer measurements using a 3 -axis accelerometers combined with 3 -axis gyro on tilted surfaces. The compensated accelerometer speed results were compared to simulated robot speed results on inclined surfaces, and were found to accurately reflect the <b>actual</b> robot <b>speed.</b> By using these compensated accelerometer results it becomes possible to determine the robot speed even under wheel slip conditions...|$|R
