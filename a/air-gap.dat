25|$|The {{continuous}} {{torque density}} of conventional electric machines {{is determined by}} the size of the <b>air-gap</b> area and the back-iron depth, which are determined by the power rating of the armature winding set, the speed of the machine, and the achievable <b>air-gap</b> flux density before core saturation. Despite the high coercivity of neodymium or samarium-cobalt PMs, continuous torque density is virtually the same amongst electric machines with optimally designed armature winding sets. Continuous torque density relates to method of cooling and permissible period of operation before destruction by overheating of windings or PM damage.|$|E
25|$|When optimally {{designed}} {{within a}} given core saturation constraint and for a given active current (i.e., torque current), voltage, pole-pair number, excitation frequency (i.e., synchronous speed), and <b>air-gap</b> flux density, all categories of electric motors or generators will exhibit virtually the same maximum continuous shaft torque (i.e., operating torque) {{within a given}} <b>air-gap</b> area with winding slots and back-iron depth, which determines the physical size of electromagnetic core. Some applications require bursts of torque beyond the maximum operating torque, such as short bursts of torque to accelerate an electric vehicle from standstill. Always limited by magnetic core saturation or safe operating temperature rise and voltage, the capacity for torque bursts beyond the maximum operating torque differs significantly between categories of electric motors or generators.|$|E

30|$|Currently, {{there are}} large number of papers on the closed-core CT modeling. The {{advantages}} and disadvantages of different models and their application ranges are introduced in detail in [1]. However, {{there are only a few}} studies have been accomplished on modeling <b>air-gapped</b> CT. In [2], the real-time magnetization curve is generated by hysteresis loop compressing method, and the real-time excitation inductance is calculated by using the arc tangent function to fit the limiting hysteresis loop, in which way the <b>air-gapped</b> CT model is established on the PSCAD/EMTDC platform. This model can simulate the saturation characteristics of <b>air-gapped</b> CT, but the simulation of the core is not accurate enough. In [3], the <b>air-gapped</b> CT model is established based on Jiles-Atherton (JA) Theory. This model can accurately simulate the effect of air gap on the magnetization process. However, the parameters such as regional coupling coefficient, thermal coefficient, regional flexibility, direction coefficient, which are required for the JA theoretical model, are often hard to accurately obtained and can only be approximated. Theoretical model of <b>air-gapped</b> CT given in [4] is established by deducing the relationship between the equivalent excitation inductance of an <b>air-gapped</b> CT and that of a closed-core CT, using principles of circuits and magnetic circuits. The model can be used to deduce the performance of <b>air-gapped</b> CT, to demonstrate the role of air gap, but cannot give the specific value of the excitation inductance; hence, it cannot be used for simulation. According to [4], using the finite element analysis software ANSYS to calculate the real-time excitation inductance, CT equivalent equation is solved for numerical solution [5], but the process is complex, and it is not conducive to simulation either.|$|R
25|$|The air-wedge {{shearing}} interferometer {{is probably}} the simplest type of interferometer designed to visualize the disturbance of the wavefront after propagation through a test object. This interferometer is based on utilizing a thin wedged <b>air-gap</b> between two optical glass surfaces {{and can be used}} with virtually any light source, even with non-coherent white light.|$|E
25|$|An air-wedge {{shearing}} interferometer {{is described}} in and was employed in set of experiments described in. This interferometer consists of two optical glass wedges (~2-5deg), pushed together and then slightly separated {{from one side to}} create a thin <b>air-gap</b> wedge. This <b>air-gap</b> wedge has a unique property- it is very thin (micrometer scale) and it has perfect flatness (~λ/10). There are four nearly equal intensity Fresnel reflections (~4% for refraction coefficient 1.5) from the air-wedge interferometer (Fig.1): 1-2 from the first glass wedge, and 3-4 from the second one. The angle between beams 1-2 and 3-4 is non adjustable and depends only on the glass wedge. The angle between beams 2-3 is easily adjusted by varying the air-wedge angle. The distance between the air-wedge and an image plane should be long enough to spatially separate reflections 1 from 2 and 3 from 4. The overlap of beams 2 and 3 in the image plane creates an interferogram.|$|E

30|$|In Fig.  18, {{the dotted}} line and the solid line are changes of {{magnetic}} flux {{in the core of}} the closed-core CT and the <b>air-gapped</b> CT, respectively. According to Fig.  18, for <b>air-gapped</b> CT, the remanence of iron core decreases continuously with the increase of running time, and decreases to 0.127  T at 0.5  s, which is about 7.1 % of the saturation magnetic flux density; and for closed-core CT, the remanence is stable after the fault is removed, the minimum value of which is 1.312  T, which is much larger than the <b>air-gapped</b> CT. When the subsequent fault occurs, if magnetic flux generated at fault occurring time is positive, it superimposes on the initial value of remanence, so the closed-core CT saturates easily. In the same condition, <b>air-gapped</b> CT core magnetic flux density will increase from the smaller value, 0.127  T, more difficult to reach saturation. This phenomenon has been verified in the simulations below, as shown in Fig.  14.|$|R
30|$|Current Transformer (CT) modeling, {{by which}} CT’s {{characteristics}} {{can be studied}} has a significant importance in CT selection and design. In spite of numerous studies about closed-core CT model, only a few works have been conducted on <b>air-gapped</b> ones with the following problems: models of which required data is easily-accessible, have poor simulations of magnetization process; on the contrary, models which have satisfactory simulations, are hard to be established because of the hard-to-get required data. Therefore, based on Preisach Theory, a novel <b>air-gapped</b> CT model is deduced from the closed core CT model. The proposed model is accurate and can be established easily. The saturation and remanence properties of closed-core CT and <b>air-gapped</b> CT are simulated and compared.|$|R

2500|$|This {{secondary}} {{assembly device}} contained the lithium deuteride fusion fuel in a stainless-steel canister. Running {{down to the}} center of the secondary was a ~1.3cm thick hollow cylindrical rod of plutonium, nested in the steel canister. This was the sparkplug, a tritium-boosted fission device, which had an aperture of about 0.5cm at its center. The sparkplug was charged with about 4 grams of tritium and, imploding together with the secondary's compression, was timed to detonate by the first generations of neutrons that arrived from the primary. Timing was defined by the geometric characteristics of the sparkplug (its uncompressed annular radius), which detonated when its criticality, or k, transcended 1. Its purpose was to compress the fusion material around it from its inside, equally applying pressure with the tamper. The compression factor of the fusion fuel and its adiabatic compression energy determined the minimal energy required for the sparkplug to counteract the compression of the fusion fuel and the tamper's momentum. The sparkplug weighed about 18kg, and its initial firing yielded [...] Then it would be completely fissioned by the fusion neutrons, contributing about [...] to the total yield. The energy required by the sparkplug to counteract the compression of the fusion fuel was lower than the primary's yield because coupling of the primary’s energy in the hohlraum is accompanied by losses due to the difference between the X-ray fireball and the hohlraum temperatures. The neutrons entered the assembly by a small hole through the ~28cm thick U blast-heat shield. It was positioned in front of the secondary assembly facing the primary. Similar to the tamper-fusion capsule assembly, the shield was shaped as a circular frustum, with its small diameter facing the primary's side, and with its large diameter locked by a type of mortise and tenon joint to the rest of the secondary assembly. The shield-tamper ensemble can be visualized as a circular bifrustum. All parts of the tamper were similarly locked together to provide structural support and rigidity to the secondary assembly. Surrounding the fusion-fuel–spark-plug assembly was the uranium tamper with a standoff <b>air-gap</b> about 0.9cm wide that was to increase the tamper's momentum, a levitation technique used as early as Operation Sandstone and famously quoted by Ted Taylor as hammer-on-the-nail-impact. Since there were also technical concerns that high-Z tamper material would mix rapidly with the relatively low-density fusion fuel, leading to unacceptably large radiation losses the stand-off gap also acted as a buffer to hinder to some extent the unavoidable and undesirable Taylor mixing.|$|E

The dotted box is the trajectory of the ending part of simulation and the solid box is the trajectory of the beginning part of simulation. Enlarging the ending part gets Fig.  20 b. According to Fig.  20, the <b>air-gapped</b> CT’s hysteresis loops are narrow, compared to the closed-core one. When the line fault is cleared, the core magnetic flux density continues to decline in an approximately spiral way, does not form a stable hysteresis loop. The core remanence value is gradually approaching zero. It {{can also be seen}} that the remanence of <b>air-gapped</b> CT can be gradually digested and, after the clearance it becomes lower than a certain level, usually 10 % of saturation flux density.|$|R

30|$|Current {{transformer}} is {{a bridge}} between the primary and secondary equipment in power system, utilized for transferring large currents proportionally to currents with small amplitudes for secondary measuring and monitoring equipment and relay protective equipment. In case of a short-circuit incident, as the power system capacity and the voltage level increase, the short-circuit current will reach tens of times or even hundreds of times of CT rated current, leading to CT saturation. In that situation, CT cannot transfer the primary current correctly, which causes mis-operation or mal-operation of protection equipment and greater errors of fault location equipment. In response to this, manufacturers open a small air gap on the core of CT, which is about one-thousandth of the total length of the magnetic circuit. Among the CTs that have been widely put into use, the PR-type and the TPY-level of the TP-type are those who have <b>air-gaps</b> in their cores. The <b>air-gapped</b> CT can guarantee that the errors are within the permissible range of the relay protection in the steady state and the transient state. Establishing the simulation model of <b>air-gapped</b> CT and studying its transient characteristics will help to understand the role of air gap more accurately, and to guide the selection and design of <b>air-gapped</b> CT.|$|R

40|$|<b>Air-gapped</b> {{computers}} are {{disconnected from the}} Internet physically and logically. This measure is taken {{in order to prevent}} the leakage of sensitive data from secured networks. In the past, {{it has been shown that}} malware can exfiltrate data from <b>air-gapped</b> computers by transmitting ultrasonic signals via the computer's speakers. However, such acoustic communication relies on the availability of speakers on a computer. In this paper, we present 'DiskFiltration,' a covert channel which facilitates the leakage of data from an <b>air-gapped</b> compute via acoustic signals emitted from its hard disk drive (HDD). Our method is unique in that, unlike other acoustic covert channels, it doesn't require the presence of speakers or audio hardware in the <b>air-gapped</b> computer. A malware installed on a compromised machine can generate acoustic emissions at specific audio frequencies by controlling the movements of the HDD's actuator arm. Digital Information can be modulated over the acoustic signals and then be picked up by a nearby receiver (e. g., smartphone, smartwatch, laptop, etc.). We examine the HDD anatomy and analyze its acoustical characteristics. We also present signal generation and detection, and data modulation and demodulation algorithms. Based on our proposed method, we developed a transmitter on a personal computer and a receiver on a smartphone, and we provide the design and implementation details. We also evaluate our covert channel on various types of internal and external HDDs in different computer chassis and at various distances. With DiskFiltration we were able to covertly transmit data (e. g., passwords, encryption keys, and keylogging data) between <b>air-gapped</b> computers to a smartphone at an effective bit rate of 180 bits/minute (10, 800 bits/hour) and a distance of up to two meters (six feet) ...|$|R
30|$|Since {{the core}} {{material}} {{and structure of}} both current transformer model are the same, so the critical saturation flux densities are also equal. As {{can be seen from}} Fig.  13, the core magnetic flux density does not reach a critical saturation value of 1.787  T at all time, and the magnetic flux density falls faster in the falling portion of each cycle than that of the closed-core CT, thereby causing the rising portion to always fail in reaching the saturation threshold. The magnetic flux density in the <b>air-gapped</b> CT model reaches a maximum value of 1.657  T after the second cycle of the fault, and then the amplitude of the flux density gradually becomes smaller due to the decay of the DC component, and the transformer does not saturate. Even though the <b>air-gapped</b> CT shown in Fig.  13 suppresses the saturation due to the existence of the air gap, it also has the larger transmission error. This is {{because of the fact that}} the equivalent inductance of <b>air-gapped</b> core is smaller, resulting in fault current having a larger diversion in the excitation branch.|$|R

30|$|Based on the Preisach core {{magnetization}} theory, the <b>air-gapped</b> core CT {{model is}} established, {{in which the}} data required for the core modeling is the descending branch of limiting hysteresis loop.

The proposed modeling method can be utilized in CT selection and design, especially in CT design to analyze the necessary length of air gap in iron core. The correctness of the proposed method is based on the experimental validation of many existing papers and the theoretical deducing and simulation of this paper, so the expectation of this method is, if possible, conducting an experiment with CT manufactures to measure the hysteresis trajectory of an iron core before and after opening an air gap in it. As a result, the proposed method can be validated in a further step.|$|R
