5|$|Titanium {{can catch}} fire when a fresh, non-{{oxidized}} surface {{comes in contact}} with liquid oxygen. Fresh metal may be exposed when the oxidized surface is struck or scratched with a hard object, or when mechanical strain causes a crack.

5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, {{following}} {{the launch of}} the wide-body 747, Boeing began considering further developments of its narrow-body 727 trijet. Designed for short and medium length routes, the three-engined 727 was the best-selling commercial jetliner of the 1960s and a mainstay of the U.S. domestic airline market. Studies focused on improving the 189-seat , the most successful 727 variant. Two approaches were considered: a stretched , and an all-new aircraft code-named 7N7. The former was a cheaper derivative using the 727's existing technology and tail-mounted engine configuration, while the latter was a twin-engine aircraft which made use of new materials and improvements to propulsion technology which had become available in the civil <b>aerospace</b> <b>industry.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century the region {{gave birth to}} some of the state's {{earliest}} oil fields and refineries as the Texas Oil Boom took hold. Refining and manufacturing grew rapidly in the area, particularly around Baytown, Pasadena, and Texas City. The opening of the Port of Texas City, and later Barbours Cut and Bayport, gradually established the region as an important shipping center. As wealth increased in southeast Texas, resorts and other tourist draws developed in the Bay Area. During the 1960s the area became home of the Johnson Space Center, headquarters for the nation's manned space program, which helped diversify the regional economy and began the development of an <b>aerospace</b> <b>industry,</b> and later other high-tech industries.|$|E

5|$|The F-22 {{cannot be}} {{exported}} under American federal law {{to protect its}} stealth technology and other high-tech features. Customers for U.S. fighters are acquiring earlier designs such as the F-15 Eagle and F-16 Fighting Falcon or the newer F-35 Lightning II, which contains technology from the F-22 but {{was designed to be}} cheaper, more flexible, and available for export. In September 2006, Congress upheld the ban on foreign F-22 sales. Despite the ban, the 2010 defense authorization bill included provisions requiring the DoD to prepare a report on the costs and feasibility for an F-22 export variant, and another report on the effect of F-22 export sales on U.S. <b>aerospace</b> <b>industry.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force Phantoms saw heavy {{action in}} the Iran–Iraq War in the 1980s and are kept {{operational}} by overhaul and servicing from Iran's <b>aerospace</b> <b>industry.</b> Notable operations of Iranian F-4s during the war included Operation Scorch Sword, an attack by two F-4s against the Iraqi Osirak nuclear reactor site near Baghdad on 30 September 1980, and the attack on H3, a 4 April 1981 strike by eight Iranian F-4s against the H-3 complex of air bases in the far west of Iraq, which resulted in many Iraqi aircraft being destroyed or damaged for no Iranian losses.|$|E
5|$|Although {{assembled}} in the United States, the UK's Phantoms were a special batch built separately and containing {{a significant amount of}} British technology as a means of easing the pressure on the domestic <b>aerospace</b> <b>industry</b> in the wake of major project cancellations. Two variants were initially built for the UK: the F-4K variant was designed from the outset as an air defence interceptor to be operated by the Fleet Air Arm from the Royal Navy's aircraft carriers; the F-4M version was procured for the RAF to serve in the tactical strike and reconnaissance roles. In the mid-1980s, a third Phantom variant was obtained when a quantity of second-hand F-4J aircraft were purchased to augment the UK's air defences following the Falklands War.|$|E

5|$|During the investigation, the Royal Navy {{conducted}} recovery operations. The first {{pieces of}} wreckage were discovered on 12 February 1954 {{and the search}} continued until September 1954, by which time 70 percent by weight of the main structure, 80 percent of the power section, and 50 percent of the aircraft's systems and equipment had been recovered. The forensic reconstruction effort had just begun when the Abell Committee reported its findings. No apparent fault in the aircraft was found, and the British government decided against opening a further public inquiry into the accident. The prestigious nature of the Comet project, particularly for the British <b>aerospace</b> <b>industry,</b> and the financial impact of the aircraft's grounding on BOAC's operations, both served to pressure the inquiry to end without further investigation. Comet flights resumed on 23 March 1954.|$|E
5|$|The Canadian Space Agency {{operates}} a highly active space program, conducting deep-space, planetary, and aviation research, and developing rockets and satellites. Canada {{was the third}} country to design and construct a satellite after the Soviet Union and the United States, with the 1962 Alouette 1 launch. Canada is {{a participant in the}} International Space Station (ISS), and is a pioneer in space robotics, having constructed the Canadarm, Canadarm2 and Dextre robotic manipulators for the ISS and NASA's Space Shuttle. Since the 1960s, Canada's <b>aerospace</b> <b>industry</b> has designed and built numerous marques of satellite, including Radarsat-1 and 2, ISIS and MOST. Canada has also produced one of the world's most successful and widely used sounding rockets, the Black Brant; over 1,000 Black Brants have been launched since the rocket's introduction in 1961. In 1984, Marc Garneau became Canada's first male astronaut, followed by Canada's second and first female astronaut Roberta Bondar in 1992.|$|E
5|$|Partly as a {{means of}} guaranteeing {{employment}} in the British <b>aerospace</b> <b>industry,</b> agreement was reached that major portions of the UK's Phantoms would be built domestically. The F-4J variant, which was then the primary version in service with the US Navy, was taken {{as the basis for the}} UK aircraft, subject to major redesign. The most significant change was the substitution of the larger and more powerful Rolls-Royce Spey turbofan for the GE J79 turbojet to allow operations from the Royal Navy's carriers. Although several had received major upgrades, all of the UK carriers were smaller than the US carriers from which the J79-GE-8 and −10 powered Phantoms operated. To accommodate the larger engines, BAC redesigned and built the entire rear fuselage section. The Westinghouse AN/AWG-10 radar carried by the F-4J was to be procured and built under licence by Ferranti as the AN/AWG-11 for FAA aircraft and AN/AWG-12 for those of the RAF. The changes to the aircraft led to the two variants being given their own separate series letters, with the FAA version being designated as the F-4K and the RAF version as the F-4M.|$|E
