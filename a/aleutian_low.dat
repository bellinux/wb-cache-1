5|$|The {{existence}} of such transients are also {{closely related to the}} formation of the Icelandic and <b>Aleutian</b> <b>Low</b> — the two most prominent general circulation features in the mid- to sub-polar northern latitudes. The two lows are formed by both the transport of kinetic energy and the latent heating (the energy released when water phase changed from vapor to liquid during precipitation) from the extratropical cyclones.|$|E
5|$|Numerous climatological factors {{influence}} {{the formation of}} hurricanes in the Pacific basins. The North Pacific High and <b>Aleutian</b> <b>Low,</b> usually present between January and April, cause strong wind shear and unfavorable conditions {{for the development of}} hurricanes. During its presence, El Niño results in increased numbers of powerful hurricanes through weaker wind shear, while La Niña reduces the number of such hurricanes through the opposite. Global warming may also {{influence the}} formation of tropical cyclones in the Pacific basin. During a thirty-year period with two sub-periods, the first between 1975 and 1989 and the second between 1990 and 2004, an increase of thirteenCategory4 or 5 storms was observed from the first sub-period.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of a semi-permanent high-pressure area known as the North Pacific High in the eastern Pacific is a dominant factor against formation of tropical cyclones in the winter, as the Pacific High results in wind shear that causes environmental conditions for tropical cyclone formation to be unconducive. Its effects in the central Pacific basin are usually related to keeping cyclones away from the Hawaiian Islands. Due to westward trade winds, hurricanes in the Pacific nearly never head eastward, although several storms have defied the odds and headed eastward. A second factor preventing tropical cyclones from forming during the winter is the occupation of a semi-permanent low-pressure area designated the <b>Aleutian</b> <b>Low</b> between January and April. Its presence over western Canada and the northwestern United States contributes to the area's occurrences of precipitation in that duration. In addition, its effects in the central Pacific near 160°W causes tropical waves that form {{in the area to}} drift northward into the Gulf of Alaska and dissipate. Its retreat in late-April allows the warmth of the Pacific High to meander in, bringing its powerful clockwise wind circulation with it. The Intertropical Convergence Zone departs southward in mid-May permitting the formation of the earliest tropical waves, coinciding with the start of the eastern Pacific hurricane season on May15.|$|E

For instance, the Icelandic and <b>Aleutian</b> <b>Lows</b> shift longitudinally and latitudinally (Dima and Lohmann 2007; Georgieva et al. 2007) on decadal-plus timescales, influencing, among other things, dominant basin-scale wind flow.

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of Pacific-born storms that cause upwelling along the Beaufort Sea conti-nental slope, the oceanographic response, and the modulation {{of the response}} due to sea-ice are investigated. In fall 2002 a mooring array located near 152 ◦Wmeasured 11 significant upwelling events that brought warm and salty Atlantic water to shallow depths. Comparing the storms that caused these events to other <b>Aleutian</b> <b>lows</b> that did not induce upwelling, interesting trends emerged. Upwelling occurred most frequently when storms were located in a region near {{the eastern end of}} the Aleutian Island Arc and Alaskan Peninsula. Not only were these storms deep, but they generally had northward tending trajectories. While the steering flow aloft aided this northward progression, the occurrence of lee cyclogenesis due to the orography of Alaska seems to play a role as well in expanding the meridional influence of the storms. In late-fall and early-winter both the intensity and frequency of the upwelling diminished significantly at the array site. It is argued that the reduction in amplitude was due to the onset of heavy pack-ice, while the decreased frequency was due to two different upper-level atmospheric blocking patterns inhibiting the far field influence of the storms. ...|$|R
50|$|The 2006 {{storms in}} Vancouver were {{a series of}} storms {{beginning}} with the remnants of Typhoon Cimaron November 5th and then followed by another on November 15th that caused landslides into Vancouver's three main reservoirs.

Although no dangerous bacteria levels were observed, the water was still considered unclean and unsafe to drink, wash vegetables or brush teeth with, without boiling it first for at least 1 minute. Bottled water was in high demand and became scarce in many areas. The storms were caused by an <b>Aleutian</b> <b>Low's</b> steering current, which allowed low pressure areas from the central subtropics of the North Pacific Ocean to track northeast and near areas of British Columbia, sometimes bringing more than 100 mm (4 in) of rain from each low.|$|R

2500|$|On December 15, the <b>Aleutian</b> <b>Low</b> {{opened up}} a large {{atmospheric}} river (the Pineapple Express) again, over California, which fed the storm system moisture, allowing it to strengthen significantly. This in turn brought torrents of rain and occasional gusts of wind, while the main storm itself slowly strengthened while stalling in the Gulf of Alaska. By December 15, a powerful Kona low (which would later become Tropical Storm Omeka) had also set up near Hawaii, feeding additional moisture into the Pineapple Express, which in turn strengthened the storm system even further. The favorable weather pattern allowed the storm to retain its intensity, even while it slowly moved down towards the West Coast. The massive storm complex slowly looped westward and then southward towards the West Coast, undergoing explosive intensification once more on December 19. The system stalled {{off the coast of}} the Pacific Northwest, and weakened slightly. However, the system fully opened up the Pineapple Express over California beginning on December 19, triggering flash floods, mudslides, and landslides across much of the Western States, particularly in California. The Pineapple Express system channeled large amounts of moisture into California, ravaging much of the state from December 15 through December 22, bringing with it as much as 20 inches of rain to the San Gabriel Mountains and San bernardinos and over 13 feet of snow in the Southern California mountains and [...] Sierra Nevada. Although the entire state was affected, the Southern California counties of San Bernardino, Orange, San Diego, and Los Angeles bore the brunt of the system of storms as coastal and hillside areas were impacted by mudslides and major flooding. During the time that the storm stalled off the West Coast, the system brought significant rain, snow, and mudslides California the Southwest region. On December 21, the storm complex's central circulation fell apart, as it began to interact with another storm in the Gulf of Alaska. On December 22, after stalling off the West Coast for 5 days, the weakened system finally approached Southern California and began moving ashore, making landfall early on December 23, which finally put a temporary end to the Pineapple Express event. Later on the same day, the winter storm weakened into a small, 1011 mbar storm, after moving eastward into the Four Corners region. On December 23, the winter storm interacted with another frontal system, causing the storm to weaken even further, {{to the point where the}} storm lost its circulation. By the time the winter storm reached southern Texas later in December 2010, almost all of the system's convection had dissipated.|$|E

40|$|The {{greenhouse}} scenario {{assumes that}} sea level will rise worldwide at uniform rates because of near-polar ice melting {{or because of}} thermal expansion of ocean waters. This view ignores the natural variability of existing sea-level behaviour that occurs globally over time. It also {{ignores the fact that}} some of this variability is related to changes in climatic parameters such as precipitation, barometric pressure and temperature that will be influenced by the greenhouse effect. This paper presents existing evidence on sea-level variability across the globe and links it to changes in atmospheric pressure, air temperature and precipitation for the period 1933 - 1980. Rapid fluctuations in rates of sea-level change occur over distances as little as 200 km. Additionally, sea-level directly responds to changes in climatic variables near areas of greatest seasonal climatic change, namely the coastlines affected by the Asian monsoon and beneath the path of the polar jet stream in the northern hemisphere. Aseasonal effects are greatest along coastlines bordering the <b>Aleutian</b> and Icelandic <b>lows.</b> The current postulated worldwide rise in sea-level of 1. 0 - 1. 5 mm y may be occurring concomitantly with increasing climatic trends in temperature, precipitation, surface pressure and intensity of pressure cells. These results will have a significant impact within the greenhouse scenario. An accelerated worldwide rise in sea-level will be difficult to detect because of the inherent variability that exists over time and space. Seasonal and inter-annual variability in tropical regions can exceed 40 cm and already poses a natural hazard that will only be exacerbated by the effects of a global rise due to greenhouse warming in these locations. In some temperate locations, rates of sea-level rise already exceed rates proposed within the scenario, while in parts of Scandinavia and northwestern North America negative rates will locally reduce the impact. Because of the linkages in behaviour between sea-level and climatic variables, negative and positive feedback will be superimposed at regional levels upon any global sea-level rise induced by the green¬house effect. This will add a degree of uncertainty to sea-level predictions at many locations...|$|R

40|$|The {{absorption}} and fluorescence {{properties of}} chromophoric {{dissolved organic matter}} (CDOM) are reported for the inner shelf, slope waters and outer shelf regions of the eastern Bering Sea {{during the summer of}} 2008, when a warm, thermally stratified surface mixed layer lay over a cold pool (< 2 °C) that occupied the entire middle shelf. CDOM absorption at 355 nm (a g 355) and its spectral slope (S) in conjunction with excitation–emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence and parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) revealed large variability in the characteristics of CDOM in different regions of the Bering Sea. PARAFAC analysis aided in the identification of three humic-like (components one, two and five) and two protein-like (a tyrosine-like component three, and a tryptophan-like component four) components. In the extensive shelf region, average absorption coefficients at 355 nm (a g 355, m − 1) and DOC concentrations (μM) were highest in the inner shelf (0. 342 ± 0. 11 m − 1, 92. 67 ± 14. 60 μM) and lower in the middle (0. 226 ± 0. 05 m − 1, 78. 38 ± 10. 64 μM) and outer (0. 185 ± 0. 05 m − 1, 79. 24 ± 18. 01 μM) shelves, respectively. DOC concentrations, however were not significantly different, suggesting CDOM sources and sinks to be uncoupled from DOC. Mean spectral slopes S were elevated in the middle shelf (24. 38 ± 2. 25 μm − 1) especially in the surface waters (26. 87 ± 2. 39 μm − 1) indicating high rates of photodegradation in the highly stratified surface mixed layer, which intensified northwards in the northern middle shelf likely contributing to greater light penetration and to phytoplankton blooms at deeper depths. The fluorescent humic-like components one, two, and five were most elevated in the inner shelf most likely from riverine inputs. Along the productive "green belt" in the outer shelf/slope region, absorption and fluorescence properties indicated the presence of fresh and degraded autochthonous DOM. Near the Unimak Pass region of the <b>Aleutian</b> Islands, <b>low</b> DOC and a g 355 (mean 66. 99 ± 7. 94 μM; 0. 182 ± 0. 05 m − 1) and a high S (mean 25. 95 ± 1. 58 μm − 1) suggested substantial photobleaching of the Alaska Coastal Water, but high intensities of humic-like and protein-like fluorescence suggested sources of fluorescent DOM from coastal runoff and glacier meltwaters during the summer. The spectral slope S vs. a g 355 relationship revealed terrestrial and oceanic end members along with intermediate water masses that were modeled using nonlinear regression equations that could allow water mass differentiation based on CDOM optical properties. Spectral slope S was negatively correlated (r 2 = 0. 79) with apparent oxygen utilization (AOU) for waters extending from the middle shelf into the deep Bering Sea indicating increasing microbial alteration of CDOM with depth. Although our data show that the CDOM photochemical environment of the Bering Sea is complex, our current information on its optical properties will aid in better understanding of the biogeochemical role of CDOM in carbon budgets in relation to the annual sea ice and phytoplankton dynamics, and to improved algorithms of ocean color remote sensing for this region...|$|R
40|$|The basic {{problems}} {{involved in}} the investigation of the effects of “blocking action” upon the circulation pattern of the northern-hemisphere westerlies are defined and the mode of attack outlined. By application of turbulence principles seasonal variations in lateral mixing and northward heat transport across the westerlies are related to variations in the extent of blocking action. Evidence is presented indicating that blocking action, lateral mixing, and northward heat transport are all greater in the winters of years when strong north–south thermal gradients exist and vice versa. The year-to-year variations in these quantities exhibit a long-period and relatively large amplitude climatic swing with a period of roughly 12 – 14 years. Considerable year-to-year variation in the radiative properties of the earth's surface and atmosphere, or in incoming radiation, is thus implied. An analysis of heat convergence through the lateral turbulence process shows in general the heart of the westerlies losing heat, particularly from the east coasts of the continents to the <b>Aleutian</b> and Icelandic <b>Lows.</b> This mechanism is apparently the means by which the large amount of heat picked up by the air from the oceans off the east coasts is dispersed. A distinction is made between the turbulent eddy sizes identified with unstable, migratory systems and those of blocking action, the latter representing dynamically quasistable systems capable of producing effects upon the general circulation of the westerlies at great distances both upstream and downstream and over a period of many days. Effects resulting from the intrusion of stable, persistent high-pressure cells into the normal westerly flow of the general circulation of the atmosphere in the characteristic manner of blocking action are investigated by means of empirical, semi-statistical procedures. These processes are found to cause the development of long stable wave patterns in the atmosphere downstream from the point of inception. These stationary patterns may occasionally exist for periods of as long as a month. The wave lengths are found to be longer than those generally considered representative of stationary wave patterns. Presumably this difference is due to the distorting effect of the larger amplitude of the long waves associated with the blocking action process. A theory of the formation of these blocking high cells is suggested based on the accumulation of heat in low latitudes and the necessity for the readjustment of the general circulation to redistribute this heat. One means of dissipation of the blocking cells is shown to be the formation of a wave pattern in the atmosphere which is out of phase with the stable wave pattern formed by the blocking high...|$|R
