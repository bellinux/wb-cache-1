The loss of oxytocic activity did {{not differ}} significantly from that of milk-ejecting activity in oxytocin, nor the loss of pressor activity from that of antidiuretic activity in vasopressin. Oxytocin was inactivated less rapidly at pH 6. 6 than <b>at</b> <b>pH</b> <b>7.</b> <b>5.</b> At pH 3. 9 neither oxytocin nor vasopressin was inactivated. Analogues of oxytocin and vasopressin, in which tyrosine is replaced by phenylalanine, were not inactivated by the tyrosinase preparation used. On incubation of bradykinin with two different tyrosinase preparations, there was no loss of oxytocic activity <b>at</b> <b>pH</b> <b>7.</b> <b>5</b> but an almost total loss at pH 3. 9.

40|$|The cowpea {{chlorotic}} mottle virus (CCMV) is {{a versatile}} building block {{for the construction}} of nanoreactors and functional materials. Upon RNA removal, the capsid can be reversibly assembled and disassembed by adjusting the pH. At pH 5. 0 the capsid is in the native assembled conformation, while <b>at</b> <b>pH</b> <b>7.</b> <b>5</b> it disassembles into 90 capsid protein dimers. This special property enables the encapsulation of various molecules, such as protein and enzymes, but only at low pH. It is possible to stabilize the capsid <b>at</b> <b>pH</b> <b>7.</b> <b>5</b> by addition of negatively charged polyelectrolytes or negatively charged particles, but these methods all fill the interior of the capsid, leaving little or no space for other cargo molecules. This pH restriction therefore severely limits the range of enzymes that can be encapsulated, and hampers the investigation of the CCMV capsid as a nanoreactor for the study of enzymes in confined spaces.

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{examined}} both the pH dependence of cathepsin B (cath B) activity and its stability at physiological pH of 7. 5 in lung tumours and normal lung tissue by means of fluorogenic assays with Z-Arg-Arg-AMC as specific substrate. Specificity was verified with the cath B blocking inhibitors E- 64 and CA- 074. With respect to pH dependence of activity, we found a deviation from a normal-shaped pH- activity curve. Besides the typical activity peak at pH 6. 0, there were shoulders at pH 4. 5 - 5. 5 and at pH 7. 0 - 7. 5. This heterogeneity was found in both tumour and normal tissue. To test the stability of cath B at physiological pH of 7. 5, homogenates were kept <b>at</b> <b>pH</b> <b>7.</b> <b>5</b> for 60 min. Altogether, 82 - 100 % of residual cath B activity was found at pH 5. 0 - 5. 5, whereas activity in the range between 5. 5 and 7. 4 dropped drastically to 26 - 42 %. <b>At</b> <b>pH</b> <b>7.</b> <b>5,</b> there was still 20 - 34 % residual cath B activity detectable. To test the hypothesis whether the cath B fraction active <b>at</b> <b>pH</b> <b>7.</b> <b>5</b> is more abundant in tumour tissues compared with the normal counterparts, we determined this fraction in 91 pairs of lung tumour and normal lung tissue. We found a 2. 3 -fold increase of median cath B fraction active <b>at</b> <b>pH</b> <b>7.</b> <b>5</b> in tumour tissue, although this fraction represented {{only a small part}} (about 16 %) of the native, acidic (pH 6. 0) cath B activity.

40|$|Phage TP- 8 lysates of Bacillus stearothermophilus 4 S or 4 S(8) contain lytic {{activity}} exhibiting two pH optima, one at pH 6. 5 and {{the other}} <b>at</b> <b>pH</b> <b>7.</b> <b>5.</b> Using a variety of fractionation procedures, the two lytic activities could not be separated. <b>At</b> <b>pH</b> <b>7.</b> <b>5</b> the lytic enzyme is an endopeptidase which hydrolyzes the l-alanyl-d-glutamyl linkage in the peptide subunits of the cell wall peptidoglycan and at pH 6. 5 it exhibits N-acetylmuramidase activity. Endopeptidase activity is inhibited by NaCl and neither lytic activity was significantly affected by divalent cations or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. Crude lysates contain 2. 5 to 3. 0 times more endopeptidase activity than N-acetylmuramidase activity. The ratio of the two lytic activities (endopeptidase/N-acetylmuramidase) changes to 1. 3 to 1. 7 {{during the course of}} purification, to 1. 0 after isoelectric focusing, and 3. 9 and 6. 00 after exposure for 2 h at 60 and 65 C, respectively. We conclude that the two lytic activities may be associated with a single protein or a lytic enzyme complex composed of two enzymes. Lytic activity <b>at</b> <b>pH</b> <b>7.</b> <b>5</b> is more effective in solubilizing cells or cell walls than the lytic activity at pH 6. 5. LiCl extracts of 4 S and 4 S(8) cells contain lytic activity exhibiting endopeptidase activity <b>at</b> <b>pH</b> <b>7.</b> <b>5</b> and N-acetylmuramidase activity at pH 6. 5. Lytic activity in these LiCl extracts also has a number of other properties in common with those in lysates of phage TP- 8. We proposed that the lytic enzyme(s) are not coded for by the phage genome but are part of the host autolytic system...|$|E

Controlling the <b>pH</b> <b>at</b> <b>7</b> < <b>5</b> in stirred batch cultures showed that cell-associated and secreted protein concentrations were increased during late exponential and stationary phase by 68 % and 125 %, respectively, compared with similar cultures without pH control. The expression of five glycosidase and eight peptidase activities were examined using fluorogen-labelled synthetic substrates. Enzyme activities were significantly down-regulated during exponential growth, increasing during stationary phase (PT 0 < 01) whether the culture <b>pH</b> was controlled <b>at</b> <b>pH</b> <b>7</b> < <b>5</b> or allowed to fall naturally to pH 4 < 4.

These interactions were registered both on macroscopic and on molecular levels: the BCCs spontaneously adsorbed on the agarose gel <b>at</b> <b>pH</b> >= <b>7.</b> <b>5,</b> with adsorption increasing with pH. Agarose particles and yeast cells stained with Procion Red HE- 3 B formed stable, monolayer-like structures <b>at</b> <b>pH</b> 8. 0, whereas <b>at</b> <b>pH</b> <b>7.</b> 0 - 7. 8 the structures on the copolymer-grafted supports were less stable and more random. <b>At</b> <b>pH</b> 9. 0, 50 % saturation of the surface with adhering cells was attained in 2 min. Stained cells formed denser and more stable layers on the copolymer-grafted supports than they did on supports modified with self-assembled organosilane layers derivatized with low-molecular-weight boronate, presumably due to a higher reactivity of the grafted BCCs. Quantitative detachment of adhered particles and cells could be achieved by addition of 20 mm fructose - a strong competitor for binding to boronates - <b>at</b> <b>pH</b> <b>7.</b> 0 - 9. 0.

40|$|When intact {{cells of}} the acidophilic red alga Cyanidium caldarium, grown at pH 1. 9 with nitrate as sole {{nitrogen}} source, are transferred to pH 7. 5, they actively reduce nitrate to nitrite which accumulates in the external medium. <b>At</b> <b>pH</b> <b>7.</b> <b>5</b> nitrite is not further reduced to ammonia. Formation of nitrite from nitrate occurs in the light or in the dark, either in the presence or {{in the absence of}} oxygen. In cell suspensions supplied with ammonia in addition to nitrate, the formation of nitrite <b>at</b> <b>pH</b> <b>7.</b> <b>5</b> is strongly prevented.

It is proposed that the inhibition by ammonia of nitrate reduction to nitrite is based on the latent state that nitrate reductase exhibits in the presence of ammonia.

40|$|An ammonia-oxidizing bacterium, strain D 1 FHS, was enriched into {{pure culture}} from a {{sediment}} sample retrieved in Jiaozhou Bay, a hyper-eutrophic semi-closed water body hosting {{the metropolitan area}} of Qingdao, China. Based on initial 16 S rRNA gene sequence analysis, strain D 1 FHS was classified in the genus Nitrosococcus, family Chromatiaceae, order Chromatiales, class Gammaproteobacteria; the 16 S rRNA gene sequence with highest level of identity to that of D 1 FHS was obtained from Nitrosococcus halophilus Nc 4 T. The average nucleotide identity between the genomes of strain D 1 FHS and Nitrosococcus halophilus strain Nc 4 is 89. 5 %. Known species in the genus Nitrosococcus are obligate aerobic chemolithotrophic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria adapted to and restricted to marine environments. The optimum growth (maximum nitrite production) conditions for D 1 FHS in a minimal salts medium are: 50 mM ammonium and 700 mM NaCl <b>at</b> <b>pH</b> of <b>7.</b> <b>5</b> to 8. 0 and at 37 °C in dark.
