During the escape from the city, the troupe is joined by Vivi, who is looking to explore, and Steiner, who decides to travel with Garnet for her protection rather than take her back against her will.

5|$|Unlike {{the stereotypical}} {{portrayal}} of television angels, Castiel {{does not always}} help people, <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> kill innocents if needed. Collins originally read for {{the part of a}} demon, as series creator Eric Kripke did not want fans to find out that angels were being introduced to the series. Collins prepared for the role by reading the Book of Revelation, and based his portrayal on his younger brother. Critics and fans have responded highly favorably to the character. In response, the show's creators expanded his role in the series, upgrading him to a main cast member in the fifth and sixth seasons. After being a special guest star in the seventh and eighth seasons, Collins was upgraded once again to regular cast member status for the ninth, tenth and eleventh seasons.|$|E

No regulatory agency has yet endorsed headways below one second, although proponents believe that regulators {{may be willing to}} reduce headways as operational experience increases.|$|E

His presence on the show illustrates the commonalities between Islamic and Anglican faiths and the similar problems the priests of each faith must face.|$|E
25|$|As the Railway minister, he has {{advocated}} instituting a rail regulator to fix rail fares, {{a policy}} that is diametrically opposite to the one by earlier railway ministers. He has also advocated de-politicizing the Railways {{and would like to}} restructure the Indian Railway Board, which lacked synergy before he joined. Trivedi believes that the Indian Railways can add 2% to India's GDP <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> go against his party's line of not hiking the fares. However, he believes the government must modernize the railways, for which a fare hike {{would not be able to}} generate adequate funds, and has publicly criticized the Prime Minister for not providing funds.. Trivedi is pushing for a national policy on railways, that would continue irrespective of political changes in the government. He has also said that the ministry is also open to the idea of privatization, which would allow more funds to be allocated to help the system cope with capacity. He stepped down as the Railway Minister on 18 March 2012, a couple of days after presenting his first ever Railway Budget in which he increased passenger fare. This did not go down well with his political party, Trinamool Congress and in particular its head West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.|$|E
