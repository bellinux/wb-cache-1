5|$|A typical protein-coding gene {{is first}} copied into RNA as an {{intermediate}} {{in the manufacture of}} the final protein product. In other cases, the RNA molecules are the actual functional products, as in the synthesis of ribosomal RNA and transfer RNA. Some RNAs known as ribozymes are capable of enzymatic function, and microRNA has <b>a</b> <b>regulatory</b> role. The DNA sequences from which such RNAs are transcribed are known as non-coding RNA genes.|$|E
5|$|Knockout mice {{have been}} created for a kidney-cancer causing {{mutation}} of BHD; heterozygotes develop kidney cysts and tumors that lead to renal failure within three weeks of birth. In these mice, the mTOR pathway was inappropriately activated, indicating that the mouse homolog of FLCN plays <b>a</b> <b>regulatory</b> role in this pathway. Rapamycin partially rescued the phenotype by regulating mTOR. Homozygotes die in utero.|$|E
5|$|Many prokaryotes have CRISPR RNAs, <b>a</b> <b>regulatory</b> system {{similar to}} RNA interference. Antisense RNAs are widespread; most {{downregulate}} a gene, {{but a few}} are activators of transcription. One way antisense RNA can act is by binding to an mRNA, forming double-stranded RNA that is enzymatically degraded. There are many long noncoding RNAs that regulate genes in eukaryotes, one such RNA is Xist, which coats one X chromosome in female mammals and inactivates it.|$|E

5|$|A third protein can {{sometimes}} be involved in type II toxin-antitoxin systems. In {{the case of the}} aforementioned MazEF addiction module, in addition to the toxin and antitoxin there is <b>a</b> <b>regulatory</b> protein involved called MazG. MazG protein interacts with E. colis Era GTPase and is described as a 'nucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase,' which hydrolyses nucleoside triphosphates to monophosphates. Later research showed that MazG is transcribed in the same polycistronic mRNA as MazE and MazF, and that MazG bound the MazF toxin to further inhibit its activity.|$|E

5|$|Amnesic {{shellfish}} poisoning (ASP) {{was first}} reported in eastern Canada in 1987. It {{is caused by}} the substance domoic acid found in certain diatoms of the genus Pseudo-nitzschia. Bivalves can become toxic when they filter these microalgae out of the water. Domoic acid is a low-molecular weight amino acid that is able to destroy brain cells causing memory loss, gastroenteritis, long-term neurological problems or death. In an outbreak in the western United States in 1993, finfish were also implicated as vectors, and seabirds and mammals suffered neurological symptoms. In the United States and Canada, <b>a</b> <b>regulatory</b> limit of 20µg/g of domoic acid in shellfish meat is set.|$|E
5|$|Enzymes can {{be either}} {{activated}} or inhibited by other molecules. For example, the end product(s) of a metabolic pathway are often inhibitors {{for one of the}} first enzymes of the pathway (usually the first irreversible step, called committed step), thus regulating the amount of end product made by the pathways. Such <b>a</b> <b>regulatory</b> mechanism is called a negative feedback mechanism, because the amount of the end product produced is regulated by its own concentration. Negative feedback mechanism can effectively adjust the rate of synthesis of intermediate metabolites according {{to the demands of the}} cells. This helps with effective allocations of materials and energy economy, and it prevents the excess manufacture of end products. Like other homeostatic devices, the control of enzymatic action helps to maintain a stable internal environment in living organisms.|$|E

5|$|Following the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834, Chadderton formed {{part of the}} Oldham Poor Law Union, an inter-parish unit {{established}} to provide social security.

5|$|Paralytic {{shellfish}} poisoning (PSP) {{is primarily}} {{caused by the}} consumption of bivalves that have accumulated toxins by feeding on toxic dinoflagellates, single-celled protists found naturally in the sea and inland waters. Saxitoxin is the most virulent of these. In mild cases, PSP causes tingling, numbness, sickness and diarrhoea. In more severe cases, {{the muscles of the}} chest wall may be affected leading to paralysis and even death. In 1937, researchers in California established the connection between blooms of these phytoplankton and PSP. The biotoxin remains potent even when the shellfish are well-cooked. In the United States, there is <b>a</b> <b>regulatory</b> limit of 80µg/g of saxitoxin equivalent in shellfish meat.|$|E

5|$|Restrictive N-terminal truncation: The {{approximately}} 30 {{amino acids}} N-terminal extension of cTnI is an adult heart-specific structure. The N-terminal extension contains the PKA phosphorylation sites Ser23/Ser24 and {{plays a role}} in modulating the overall molecular conformation and function of cTnI. A restrictive N-terminal truncation of cTnI occurs at low levels in normal hearts of all vertebrate species examined including human and significantly increases in adaptation to hemodynamic stress and Gsα deficiency-caused failing mouse hearts.

5|$|Substrate {{and product}} {{inhibition}} is where either the substrate or {{product of an}} enzyme reaction inhibit the enzyme's activity. This inhibition may follow the competitive, uncompetitive or mixed patterns. In substrate inhibition there is a progressive decrease in activity at high substrate concentrations. This may indicate the existence of two substrate-binding sites in the enzyme. At low substrate, the high-affinity site is occupied and normal kinetics are followed. However, at higher concentrations, the second inhibitory site becomes occupied, inhibiting the enzyme. Product inhibition is often <b>a</b> <b>regulatory</b> feature in metabolism and can {{be a form of}} negative feedback.|$|E

The New York Public Service Commission, <b>a</b> <b>regulatory</b> agency founded in 1907, ruled in May 1911 that the new Springtown station was adequate. The Springtown station had no station agent or freight house. In 1925, sparks shooting off a passing train caused a fire in Springtown that burned down six buildings, causing $7,000 in damage. The prominence of the New Paltz station, as well as the growth of SUNY New Paltz in the village, caused the decline of Springtown as a community.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} the {{molecular}} cues involved in the correct targeting of the migrating precursors remains a question. The secretion of a chemoattractant factor by the OB appears as a possibility. Chemoattractants and repellants act on the migrating neurons by inducing changes in the growth cone to direct them. Nevertheless, tissue derived from this structure had no directive influence on the migration. On the other hand, a septum-derived secreted factor showed a repulsive effect on the SVZ cells. More recently, {{it has been shown}} that the secreted molecule SLIT shows such a repelling effect on SVZ-derived precursors. Furthermore, integrins have been demonstrated to have <b>a</b> <b>regulatory</b> influence on precursor cell chain-migration and regulation of their divisions.|$|E
