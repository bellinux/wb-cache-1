5000|$|The <b>African</b> <b>{{oystercatcher}}</b> or [...] African {{black oystercatcher}} (Haematopus moquini), {{is a large}} charismatic wader resident to the mainland coasts and offshore islands of southern Africa. This near-threatened oystercatcher {{has a population of}} over 6,000 adults, which breed between November and April. The scientific name moquini commemorates the French naturalist Alfred Moquin-Tandon who discovered and named this species before Bonaparte.|$|E
50|$|The {{lifespan}} of an <b>African</b> <b>oystercatcher</b> {{is about}} 35 years, {{of which they}} are known to pair up for 25 years. Although adults are rarely predated most mainland egg and chick fatalities are due to disturbance by people, off-road vehicles, dog attacks and predation by the kelp gull (Larus dominicanus) and other avian preditors. Off shore pairs experience similar avian predation although most chicks perish due to starvation.|$|E
50|$|The black {{oystercatcher}} {{is the only}} representative of the oystercatcher family (Haematopodidae) over most of its range, overlapping slightly with the American oystercatcher (H. palliatus) {{on the coast of}} Baja California.

40|$|We studied prefledging growth, energy {{expenditure}} and time budgets of <b>African</b> Black <b>Oystercatcher,</b> Haematopus moquini, chicks on Robben Island, Western Cape, South Africa. The {{aim of the}} study was to investigate the effect of parental feeding on the growth and energetics of semi-precocial shorebird chicks. Chicks reached mean fledging mass, 463 g, in 40 days. The growth rate coefficient of <b>African</b> Black <b>Oystercatcher</b> chicks was 2 % below the predicted value for a shorebird species of their body mass, but it was smaller than that of other precocial and semi-precocial shorebirds to date. Resting metabolic rate (RMR, measured through respirometry), daily metabolisable energy (DME), defined as daily {{energy expenditure}} (DEE, measured with doubly labelled water) plus energy deposited into tissue (E-tis), and total metabolisable energy (TME) of <b>African</b> Black <b>Oystercatcher</b> chicks were similar to those expected for a species of their body size. DEE was not influenced by weather (ambient temperature, operative temperature and wind speed), therefore, variations in DEE may be explained by body mass alone. The relative RMR of the <b>African</b> Black <b>Oystercatcher</b> was greater, their TME was approximately the same, their average daily metabolisable energy (ADME) was less, and they spent less time foraging (short periods of parental feeding) and more time inactive than three precocial species in the Western Cape. Therefore, the semi-precocial mode of development of <b>African</b> Black <b>Oystercatcher</b> chicks reduced energy costs from thermoregulation and activity, and they were able to grow relatively faster than precocial, self-feeding shorebird species in similar climatic conditions. The growth rate coefficient of <b>African</b> Black <b>Oystercatcher</b> chicks was smaller than that of Eurasian Oystercatcher, Haematopus ostralegus, chicks, which may be a consequence of differences in body size and latitudinal effects.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. <b>African</b> Black <b>Oystercatchers</b> (Haematopus moquini) have a modal clutch size of two eggs but {{occasionally}} lay one or three eggs. It {{has been noted}} that an increase in frequency of larger threeand even four-egg clutches has occurred {{over the last few}} decades. By analysing extensive historical nest records dating back five decades I verified the occurrence of this increase in three-egg clutches over many of the sites within their breeding range. As <b>African</b> Black <b>Oystercatchers</b> are very territorial, co-operative polygyny was rejected as a sole cause (through observations). As eggs were found to be significantly similar (through intra-clutch egg shape comparisons) within clutches egg-dumping as a cause was also rejected. It was thus established that the increase in three-egg clutch frequency was indicating an increase in breeding effort. On further analysis of this increase, it was discovered that three-egg clutches offer no benefit to species fitness or breeding success as they do not result in an increased fledgling output to those of the smaller two-egg clutches. This is primarily due to inefficient incubation {{as a result of the}} extra egg, and the inability to maintain and feed a larger brood size. This study validates previous assertions that three-egg clutch frequency is increasing for <b>African</b> Black <b>Oystercatchers...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Larvae of Scutellastra longicosta tend {{to settle}} on the shells of larger limpets and the juveniles graze the encrusting alga that grows there. When they are large enough they move onto the rocks and graze on coralline algae before {{eventually}} setting up their own gardens. These are established by grazing hard to remove any algae growing on a rock surface and allowing settlement of R. verrucosa, this limpet's favoured food. The algal growth is then regularly grazed and maintained as turf, being fertilised by the limpet's faeces and by mucus. The garden is defended from other herbivores which the limpet pries off the surface with its spines. A 7 cm limpet can [...] "farm" [...] an area of about 150 cm2, occupies a scar near the centre, and seldom moves out of this area. Gardens seldom overlap {{and even though the}} limpet is encouraging the growth of a single species of alga, there may be greater algal diversity in the area than might otherwise occur. This is because, while defending their gardens, the limpets drive off herbivores from the patches of rock between their gardens, giving algae settling there a greater chance of flourishing. Limpets experimentally removed from their territories and transplanted to nearby locations were found to have homing abilities and find their way back to their original gardens. Various predators feed on this limpet, especially the <b>African</b> <b>oystercatcher.</b>|$|E

40|$|In 1980 and 1981 {{more than}} 50 pairs of kelp gulls Lams dominicanus, 70 of Cape {{cormorants}} Phalacrocorax capensis and 20 of whitebreasted cormorants P. carbo nested in the Tsitsikamma Coastal National Park.

50|$|The Canary Islands {{oystercatcher}} was {{of similar}} size as its relatives, the <b>African</b> and Eurasian <b>oystercatchers,</b> or about 40-45 cm (around 16.5 in); comparing with the non-migratory African species, it probably weighed between 600-800 grams in life, with females being slightly heavier.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. The <b>African</b> Black <b>Oystercatcher</b> is {{currently}} classified as Near-threatened {{by virtue of}} the fact that the population size is small « 10 000) and numbers have decreased or were previously recorded as decreasing. Aspects considered to be of conservation concern to the species are (a) its inherently low and variable breeding success; (b) its ground-nesting habit, making it vulnerable to numerous direct and indirect impacts of human disturbance; (c) its susceptibility to mass mortalities, particularly of adult birds in high-density breeding populations. Inherent factors which may of benefit to the species' persistence are its considerable longevity and, potentially, a degree of connectivity between local populations, although current evidence suggests that this is very low. However, in addition to these considerations, over the past 25 + years the variety and intensity of potential threats and benefits to the species have also changed and this may have changed the species' conservation status. While human activity has increased in many areas of the species' breeding range, <b>African</b> Black <b>Oystercatcher</b> populations may be benefiting from and increase in the number of Marine Protected Areas as well as an improved food supply in the form of an invasive alien mussel species, Mytilus galloprovincialis. In light of the key factors outlined above and the territorial nature of the species, all of which are considered to be of importance to the species' population dynamics and conservation, the main aims of this study were to: (a) reassess the global population and, where changes have occurred, to provide an explanation for these changes; (b) assess the importance of, and manner in which human disturbance may impact breeding populations; (c) assess levels of natal site philopatry and adult site fidelity in local populations; (d) assess the long-term population viability of the species; and (e) assess the potential importance of territorial behaviour in governing the population dynamics of local oystercatcher populations...|$|R
40|$|The <b>African</b> Black <b>Oystercatcher</b> (Haematopus moquini) is a shorebird {{endemic to}} {{southern}} Africa, and is internationally listed as "Near-threatened''. Its population is increasing following protection measures and {{the invasion of}} the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis. Although adults of the species are sedentary, dispersal up to 2800 km by immature birds was discovered in 1998. To ensure that conservation programs address the species' needs throughout its life cycle, this project determines the locations of importance to oystercatchers between the start and end points of their dispersal. [...] Young <b>African</b> Black <b>Oystercatchers</b> disperse to a range of traditional locations along the coasts of South Africa and Namibia. Dispersal roosts along the Atlantic coast allow young birds to avoid competition for food with adults. Of the total number of South African-bred birds (n = 1 06) whose dispersal endpoints were confirmed, 65 % dispersed to Namibia, 11 % to north-western South Africa, 19 % within south-western South Africa, and 5 % dispersed along the south coast of South Africa. At least 22 % of resighted birds departed in their first year of life, and 25 % returned to the vicinity of their natal sites in their third or fourth year of life. At least 4 % dispersed later than their first year. Body condition, sex and relative hatch date did not differ significantly between immature oystercatchers dispersing different distances. [...] Roosts were mostly, but not exclusively, located in wave-sheltered areas containing both rocky and sandy substrata and with wide visibility angles allowing for vigilance against predators. The birds fed in the immediate vicinity of the roost sites at low tide. The largest roosts were in sheltered areas near river mouths; these sites were characterized by lower limpet numbers than smaller roosts. All but one roost checked also contained other shorebird and seabird species. [...] Because these sites are traditional and used by several species for various purposes during a sensitive time of the oystercatchers' life cycle, they are important for conservation. However, several roost sites are located in areas zoned for diamond mining or development. Diamond mining can, at least temporarily, reduce the local abundance of oystercatcher prey, thereby eliminating the area as foraging habitat. Ribbon development on the coast should be discouraged to maintain undisturbed habitats, and coastal mining and mining-related activities should not be allowed in areas used by roosting or foraging shorebirds...|$|R
40|$|Morphometric {{differences}} {{between males and}} females are a common feature among oystercatcher species (Hockey 1996), although breeding partners often appear similar when observed from a distance. Combinations of different biometric parameters such as bill size and shape, body mass, wing and tarsus lengths have been used to discriminate males and females in the field in European Oystercatchers Haematopus ostralegus (Zwarts et al. 1996), American Black Oystercatchers Haematopus bachmani (Guzzetti et al. 2008) and the three oystercatcher species present in New Zealand (Baker 1973). Sexual dimorphism also occurs in the <b>African</b> Black <b>Oystercatcher</b> Haematopus moquini, an endemic species living on the coasts of Namibia and South Africa. In this species, females tend to have longer and sharper bills than males (Hockey 1981, Hockey 2005). However, sex determination based solely on this parameter can be inaccurate because the ranges of bill size {{between males and females}} overlap. Variations in bill morphology between sites and/or regions may also occur in relation to feeding habits and prey assemblages (Hulscher 1996). Another way to sex oystercatchers is checking for cloacal distension in females during the period immediately after egg laying. Although molecular markers remain the most reliable tool for sexing non-ratite birds (Fridolfsson and Ellegren 1999), these techniques require capturing the birds, are relatively expensive and the 25 between the CHD 1 W and CHD 1 Z introns located on the sex chromosomes (Fridolfsson and Ellegren 1999) ...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} small-medium (1 - 300 km) scale {{variation in}} the foraging ecology of the <b>African</b> Black <b>Oystercatcher</b> during its breeding season, using traditional diet analysis coupled with carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis. Fieldwork was conducted between January and March 2006 and 2007, on rocky shores on the south-east coast of South Africa at East London, Kenton and Port Elizabeth. Middens of shelled prey left by adults feeding their chicks were collected from five territories and the abundances of the collected prey on the foraging areas were estimated using quadrats. Blood samples from 45 birds (16 females, 10 males and 19 chicks) and tissues from the predominant prey species on the territory of each breeding pair were collected for isotope analysis. The Manly-Chesson selectivity index revealed that adults feed their chicks preferentially with the limpet Scutellastra cochlear and the Mediterranean mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis, if available. A slight enrichment in the 15 N stable-carbon isotope signature was observed towards the west in both prey and oystercatchers. Differences in isotope signatures {{between males and females}} from the same breeding pair indicate sex-related differences in the diet. Both had signatures indicating a mixed diet, but with males exhibiting a signature closer to that of limpets and females closer to that of mussels. In the single case where mussels were rare on the feeding territory, the two members of a pair showed carbon signatures which were identical and very similar to that of limpets. These results indicate dietary partitioning between genders in breeding pairs...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographies. Rocky {{islands in}} Saldanha Bay, southwestern Cape, South Africa, support aggregations of seabirds. Guano {{produced}} by the seabirds washed off the islands into intertidal and nearshore waters,where it provides a source of inorganic and organic nutrients. The concentrations of nutrients in intertidal rockpools at island and mainland sites in the Saldanha Bay area were measured,and the biological structures of intertidal communities at these sites were compared {{in the light of}} differences in intertidal nutrient status. Monthly measurements were made of algal production and of the growth, density, reproductive condition and mortality of the dominant intertidal herbivore, Patella granularis. The rate of intertidal algal production was enhanced on shores washed by nutrient-rich waters, and the growth rates and life-history patterns of populations of P. granularis were, in turn, modified by the increased availability of algal food. On unenriched shores rates of algal production and limpet growth and reproduction were slow. Seabirds thus influence trophic relationships between intertidal organisms, without themselves being components of the community. Islands in Saldanha Bay also support dense populations of <b>African</b> Black <b>Oystercatchers</b> Haematopus moqu. ini, which forage intertidally. Predation by oystercatchers on P. granular is resulted in a modification of limpet densities and population size structures, and a reduction in the intensity of grazing. The impact of predation was, however, modified by the presence, in intertidal waters, of nutrients from seabird guano, and the consequences thereof. It is proposed that differences in the structures of communities on rocky shores, and in the roles of processes influencing structure, might •be due, in part, to differences in the nutrient status of intertidal waters...|$|R
