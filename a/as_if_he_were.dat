5|$|In a {{nationwide}} Fox News/Opinion Dynamics poll of 900 registered voters conducted in July 2001, 44 percent of American respondents thought that Condit {{was involved in}} Levy's disappearance and 27 percent felt that he should resign. Fifty-one {{percent of the respondents}} believed that he was acting <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> guilty; 13 percent felt that he should run again for office. A poll sample taken from Condit's congressional district held a more favorable view of Condit. On March 5, 2002, Condit lost the Democratic primary election for his Congressional seat to his former aide, then-Assemblyman Dennis Cardoza, with the Levy controversy being cited as a contributing factor. He was subpoenaed to appear on April 1, 2002, before a District of Columbia grand jury investigating the disappearance. The date was kept a carefully guarded secret to avoid further leaks. Condit left Congress {{at the end of his}} term on January 3, 2003.|$|E
5|$|Don Vito {{brought the}} {{organization}} to its highest perfection without undue recourse to violence. The Mafia leader who scatters corpses all over the island {{in order to achieve}} his goal is considered as inept as the statesman who has to wage aggressive wars. Don Vito ruled and inspired fear mainly by the use of his great qualities and natural ascendancy. His awe-inspiring appearance helped him. … His manners were princely, his demeanour humble but majestic. He was loved by all. Being very generous by nature, he never refused a request for aid and dispensed millions in loans, gifts and general philanthropy. He would personally go {{out of his way to}} redress a wrong. When he started a journey, every major, dressed in his best clothes, awaited him at the entrance of his village, kissed his hands, and paid homage, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> a king. And he was a king of sorts: under his reign peace and order were observed, the Mafia peace, of course, which was not what the official law of the Kingdom of Italy would have imposed, but people did not stop to draw too fine a distinction.|$|E

Her eight potential love interests in the original version of the game, who together form the rest of the main cast, are Ryouta Kawara, a rock dove and the protagonist's sickly but hardworking childhood friend; Sakuya Le Bel Shirogane, a fantail pigeon and snobbish French aristocrat; Sakuya's older half-brother Yuuya Sakazaki, a popular and flirtatious but strangely secretive fantail pigeon; Nageki Fujishiro, a quiet, bookish mourning dove who never seems to leave the library; San Oko, an athletic, hyperactive fantail pigeon who is obsessed with pudding; Anghel Higure, an eccentric Luzon bleeding-heart who behaves <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> in some kind of fantasy role-playing game; Kazuaki Nanaki, a kind but narcoleptic button quail and the protagonist's homeroom teacher; and Shuu Iwamine, a creepy, antisocial chukar partridge who serves as the school's doctor.

5|$|The {{year after}} he left office as mayor, Armstrong began work with the Edmonton post office. After being {{recommended}} for the position by city notables, he was named postmaster of the city on November 12, 1913. In the same year he oversaw {{the construction of a}} new building on Namayo Avenue, the Fairbairn Block, mainly for use by his business but with additional space for offices and housing in the upper levels. In 1920, Armstrong was involved in a legal case involving his office as postmaster when he was accused in the 1919 disappearance of a sum of $50,000 from the post office. Although exonerated in 1920, he would again be arrested in 1923 and charged with theft. During the trial, it was testified that a witness had seen Armstrong on the day of the robbery, with only a paper in his hand <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> heading out. Armstrong, who had proclaimed his innocence, and provided evidence for the trial was eventually acquitted and found not guilty of the charges in a decision made on May 29, which was followed by an eruption of applause. Later in 1923, Armstrong was appointed postmaster of the Strathcona (south side) Post Office. He remained with the post office until he retired in January 1937. At the time of his retirement he was serving as postmaster of the south post office. In his years with the post office, he served a total of 14 years as postmaster. The Armstrong Drug Store would later go through multiple owners until its closing on December 10, 1993.|$|E

5000|$|According to Peter Gidal {{the film}} {{distances}} the viewer {{from the experience}} it purportedly depicts, [...] "Sometimes the young actor looks bored, sometimes <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> thinking, sometimes <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> aware of the camera, sometimes <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> not." [...] Douglas Crimp states that {{after a few minutes}} [...] "it becomes clear that we will see nothing more than the repetition, with slight variations, of what we've already seen". This frees the mind to look in a different way. Likewise the sexual act has the effect of distracting the actor from the presence of the camera, creating a unique kind of unself-consciousness. The film becomes [...] "a lesson in how to produce a really beautiful portrait without saying 'cheese'!" ...|$|R
