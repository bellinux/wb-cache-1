50|$|Since Easter Sunday 1998, {{there have}} been six episodes a week from Sunday to Friday, <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>summary</b> at around 19:02. All except the Friday evening episode are {{repeated}} the following day at 14:02. The six episodes are re-run unabridged in the Sunday morning omnibus at 10:00.

50|$|BBC Scotland {{started using}} their own {{continuity}} announcers for all evening and weekend afternoon junctions around 1977; before this period, announcers only covered opt-outs, {{which resulted in the}} London announcer being heard most of the time. From 1979, their duties were expanded to cover <b>the</b> lunchtime <b>news</b> bulletin at 12:40, just before the network Midday News at 12:45. There was one announcer who was never seen: Robert Logan, who was also a Conservative councillor. Consequently, he never read <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>summaries,</b> nor did he ever give his name at closedown. From 1985, the announcing team started doing a <b>news</b> <b>summary</b> just before children's programmes at around 15:53, and within a few weeks, additional <b>news</b> <b>summaries</b> at 21:25 were introduced. From 31 October 1988, newsroom staff started to read <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>summaries</b> instead of <b>the</b> announcers.|$|R

50|$|On October 2 {{the series}} moved to Thursdays, and on January 8 {{the show was}} reduced to 55 minutes for the network to present a five-minute <b>news</b> <b>summary</b> at 9:25 PM. Quiz moved to Mondays on February 2 and was now preceded by a civilian-defense program (later an American Red Cross program), which along with <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>summary</b> {{required}} <b>the</b> show itself to decrease to 50 minutes. The Red Cross program ended on March 30, allowing Quiz to re-expand to 55 minutes.|$|R
50|$|The {{show would}} {{open with a}} 10-minute CBC News summary, usually read by Sheldon Turcott in <b>the</b> <b>news</b> studio, and then move to another studio — the same studio, in fact, that was used for The Journal — for the main segment of the program. Following the launch of CBC Newsworld in 1989, <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>summary</b> became a {{simulcast}} of that network's hourly news update that was live for each time zone.|$|R
50|$|From Tuesday 8 January 2008, former BBC Breakfast anchor Dermot Murnaghan {{replaced}} Julie Etchingham as main presenter of the show. Etchingham {{moved to}} ITV News {{to present the}} relaunched News at Ten with Sir Trevor McDonald. Likewise Emma Crosby took over <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>summaries</b> from Colin Brazier who moved to Afternoon Live to work alongside Kay Burley. However, shortly <b>after</b> taking up <b>the</b> headline post, Crosby moved to Sky's business news department, and then onto GMTV.|$|R

In order to save this problem, we propose a method which collects original news text from on-line information and extracts summary sentences from them automatically.

50|$|Bliss was {{considered}} one of the best of all news scriptwriters. During his 25 years at CBS radio and television, Bliss wrote and edited <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>summary</b> for Edward R. Murrow's broadcasts, worked on the investigative TV series CBS Reports with Fred W. Friendly, and was executive assistant to CBS News president Richard S. Salant. In 1963, Bliss became Walter Cronkite's <b>news</b> editor when <b>the</b> CBS Evening News became TV's first half-hour news broadcast. Bliss was <b>news</b> editor on <b>the</b> broadcast that announced the death of President John F. Kennedy; he had been monitoring the wire reports and gave Cronkite <b>the</b> <b>news</b> when he returned from lunch.|$|R

40|$|Wikipedia’s Current Events Portal (WCEP) is {{a special}} part of Wikipedia that focuses on daily <b>summaries</b> of <b>news</b> events. <b>The</b> WikiTimes project {{provides}} structured access to WCEP by extracting and in-dexing all its daily news events. In this paper we study this part of Wikipedia and {{take a closer look}} into its content and the community behind it. First, we provide descriptive analysis of <b>the</b> collected <b>news</b> events. Second, we compare between <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>summaries</b> created by <b>the</b> WCEP crowd and the ones created by professional journalists on the same topics. Finally, we analyze the revision logs of <b>news</b> events over <b>the</b> past 7 years in order to characterize the WCEP crowd and their activities. The results show that WCEP has reached a stable state in terms of the volume of contributions as well as the size of its crowd, which makes it an important source of <b>news</b> <b>summaries</b> for <b>the</b> public and the research community...|$|R
