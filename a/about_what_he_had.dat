25|$|When Pettigrew's troops {{approached}} Gettysburg on June 30, {{they noticed}} Union cavalry under Brig. Gen. John Buford arriving south of town, and Pettigrew returned to Cashtown without engaging them. When Pettigrew told Hill and Heth <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> seen, neither general {{believed that there}} was a substantial Federal force in or near the town, suspecting that it had been only Pennsylvania militia. Despite General Lee's order to avoid a general engagement until his entire army was concentrated, Hill decided to mount a significant reconnaissance in force the following morning to determine the size and strength of the enemy force in his front. Around 5 a.m. on Wednesday, July 1, two brigades of Heth's division advanced to Gettysburg.|$|E
25|$|Apart of {{the court}} order, NBC News also {{reported}} one former Penn State assistant coach witnessed an incident in the late 1970s, and three other coaches —who {{have gone on to}} work in pro level and other colleges— allegedly saw inappropriate conduct between Sandusky and boys in the early and mid-1990s. Risk management expert Raymond Williams identified both the three incidents with some of the assistant coaches on the Penn State staff at the time, and three others that were reported to university officials; and whether key university officials should have had knowledge about child sex-assault allegations involving Sandusky in each of the six different cases dating to 1976. Mike McQueary claimed former fellow Penn State assistant coaches Greg Schiano and Tom Bradley also knew about Sandusky’s transgressions in a key testimony in a deposition among the documents related to the insurance coverage case, in which he claims that when he told Bradley <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> seen, Bradley was not shocked, and that Bradley went on to tell him a story about a time Schiano had witnessed Sandusky abusing a child some time during the ‘90s. Both of the former Penn State assistants have denied McQueary's testimony.|$|E
500|$|Shen wrote {{extensively}} <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> learned {{while working}} for the state treasury, including mathematical problems posed by computing land tax, estimating requirements, currency issues, metrology, and so forth. Shen once computed the amount of terrain space required for battle formations in military strategy, and also computed the longest possible military campaign given the limits of human carriers who would bring their own food and food for other soldiers. [...] Shen wrote about the earlier Yi Xing (672–717), a Buddhist monk who applied an early escapement mechanism to a water-powered celestial globe. By using mathematical permutations, Shen described Yi Xing's calculation of possible positions on a go board game. Shen calculated the total number for this using up to five rows and twenty five game pieces, which yielded the number 847,288,609,443.|$|E

500|$|A {{number of}} {{literary}} theorists have approached the Devotions as politically themed. Richard Strier, in particular, identifies the Devotions as an [...] "Arminian polemic", {{arguing that it}} was highly atypical of Donne to actually publish works, rather than merely let them circulate amongst friends. Both before and after ordination, Donne actively resisted publication, normally only publishing works {{that had been the}} result of a commission, such as The Anniversaries or Pseudo-Martyr. The Devotions, however, were [...] "literally rushed" [...] into print, with the volume being handed to the printers a month after he had recovered from his disease. Strier argues that Donne's rationale for publishing the Devotions matches his rationale for publishing a sermon, the Encaenia, the same year, to assert the importance of [...] "places, and of dayes, and of all outward meanes", because he felt some sense of urgency <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> to say. This is coupled with Devotion XVI, in which Donne explicitly comes out against Puritanism and is simultaneously [...] "purposely militant", deliberately frustrating the other extreme from Puritanism, where [...] "the Arminianism and the polemical anti-puritanism of the volume becomes explicit".|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with a correspondent from The Washington Post, Truitt confirmed the Enquirers account, stated that Meyer had told him of the affair, and that he had kept notes <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been told. According to Truitt, Meyer and Kennedy met approximately 30 times — frequently when Jackie Kennedy was out of town — from January 1962 until the time of the President's death in November 1963. Truitt stated that the two would occasionally have drinks or dinner with one of Kennedy's aides, whom he identified as David Powers and Timothy J. Reardon Jr.. Contradicting his earlier account with the Enquirer, Truitt said Kennedy gave the marijuana to Meyer. Truitt acknowledged that he received payment from the Enquirer, but did not disclose the amount of payment.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the fall}} of 1915, Rogers {{began to appear in}} Florenz Ziegfeld's Midnight Frolic. The variety revue began at midnight in the top-floor night club of Ziegfeld's New Amsterdam Theatre, and drew many influential—and regular—customers. By this time, Rogers had refined his act. His monologues on {{the news of the day}} {{followed}} a similar routine every night. He appeared on stage in his cowboy outfit, nonchalantly twirling his lasso, and said, [...] "Well, what shall I talk about? I ain't got anything funny to say. All I know is what I read in the papers." [...] He would make jokes <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> read in that day's newspapers. The line [...] "All I know is what I read in the papers" [...] is often incorrectly described as Rogers's most famous punch line, when it was his opening line.|$|E

2500|$|In 1977, {{following}} {{the resignation of}} Finance Minister Donald MacDonald, Chrétien succeeded him. He was the first francophone Minister of Finance, and remains {{one of only three}} francophones to have held that post. Chrétien's time at Finance highlighted his [...] "enforcer" [...] status, namely as someone who often helped to execute Trudeau's policies, but who rarely helped Trudeau to make policy. During his time at Finance, Trudeau completely excluded Chrétien from any role in making financial policy, instead expecting Chrétien to simply carry out the policies that he and his advisors at the PMO had decided beforehand without consulting Chrétien at all. Trudeau was extremely close to the West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, and during the 1978 G-7 summit in Bonn, Trudeau had extensive discussions with his friend Schmidt about how best to win re-election in 1979. Schmidt suggested to Trudeau that he respond to criticism of the deficits he had been running by bringing in some big cuts to spending, an idea that Trudeau took up. In 1978 Trudeau announced in a press statement $2 billion in cuts without bothering to inform Chrétien beforehand <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> decided to do, who was left looking clueless in the resulting press interview. Chrétien found this experience so humiliating that he seriously considering resigning in protest. Chrétien was especially humiliated by the fact that Chancellor Schmidt was better informed of about {{what was going to happen}} than he was, which underlined that he was not a member of Trudeau's inner circle.|$|E
