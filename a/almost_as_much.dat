5|$|This defeat infuriated the Caliph, who {{prepared}} a new expedition. Intended {{as a show}} of force and a clear display of the Caliphate's superiority, it was the largest army sent against Byzantium {{in the second half of}} the 8th century: it allegedly comprised 95,793 men, about twice the total Byzantine military establishment present in Asia Minor, and cost the Abbasid state some 1.6 million nomismata, <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as the Byzantine Empire's entire annual income. Harun was the nominal leader, but the Caliph took care to send experienced officers to accompany him.|$|E
5|$|Within the conch fisheries, one of {{the threats}} to {{sustainability}} {{stems from the fact}} that there is <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> meat in large juveniles as there is in adults, but only adult conchs can reproduce, and thus sustain a population. In many places where adult conchs have become rare due to overfishing, larger juveniles and subadults are taken before they ever mate. On a number of islands, subadults provide the majority of the harvest.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the most}} {{circulated}} coins in the United States {{at the time}} were Spanish currency, Hamilton proposed that minting a United States dollar weighing <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as the Spanish peso would be the simplest way to introduce a national currency. Hamilton differed from European monetary policymakers in his desire to overprice gold relative to silver, {{on the grounds that the}} United States would always receive an influx of silver from the West Indies. Despite his own preference for a monometallic gold standard, he ultimately issued a bimetallic currency at a fixed 15:1 ratio of silver to gold.|$|E
50|$|The {{finished}} tractor weighed 2340 lb, {{and initially}} sold for US$585. This was an advantage, as tractors from other manufactures cost <b>almost</b> twice <b>as</b> <b>much.</b>|$|R

50|$|Reed's early lead in {{fund-raising}} evaporated by December 31, 2005, when disclosure reports showed Cagle raising <b>almost</b> twice <b>as</b> <b>much</b> money <b>as</b> Reed in {{the last}} six months of the year.|$|R
5|$|In 2013, China led {{the world}} in {{renewable}} energy production, with a total capacity of 378 GW, mainly from hydroelectric and wind power. As of 2014, China leads {{the world in}} the production and use of wind power, solar photovoltaic power and smart grid technologies, generating <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> water, wind and solar energy as all of France and Germany's power plants combined. China's renewable energy sector is growing faster than its fossil fuels and nuclear power capacity. Since 2005, production of solar cells in China has expanded 100-fold. As Chinese renewable manufacturing has grown, the costs of renewable energy technologies have dropped. Innovation has helped, but the main driver of reduced costs has been market expansion.|$|E
5|$|In {{the period}} {{immediately}} after the war, many teams in Europe were forced to wear unusual kits due to clothing restrictions. England's Oldham Athletic, who had traditionally worn blue and white, spent two seasons playing in red and white shirts borrowed from a local rugby league club, and Scotland's Clyde wore khaki. In the 1950s kits worn by players in southern Europe and South America became much more lightweight, with V-necks replacing collars on shirts and synthetic fabrics replacing heavy natural fibres. The first boots to be cut below the ankle rather than high-topped were introduced by Adidas in 1954. Although they cost {{twice as much as}} existing styles the boots were a huge success and cemented the German company's place in the football market. Around the same time Adidas also developed the first boots with screw-in studs which could be changed according to pitch conditions. Other areas were slower to adopt the new styles – British clubs again resisted change and stuck resolutely to kits little different from those worn before the war, and Eastern European teams continued to wear kits that were deemed old-fashioned elsewhere. The FC Dynamo Moscow team that toured Western Europe in 1945 drew <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> comment for the players' long baggy shorts as for the quality of their football. With the advent of international competitions such as the European Cup, the southern European style spread {{to the rest of the}} continent and by the end of the decade the heavy shirts and boots of the pre-war years had fallen entirely out of use. The 1960s saw little innovation in kit design, with clubs generally opting for simple colour schemes which looked good under the newly adopted floodlights. Designs from the late 1960s and early 1970s are highly regarded by football fans.|$|E

50|$|Availability of {{cartridge}} {{software was}} very limited: The cost was <b>almost</b> twice <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> {{the same game}} on cassette tape, and each cartridge could only hold 16 KiB, making it <b>almost</b> immediately obsolete <b>as</b> the majority of Spectrums sold were 48K-models, which the software publishers targeted.|$|R
