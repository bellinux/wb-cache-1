5|$|Before Peter is {{preparing}} to leave for jury duty, the family is seen watching a television sitcom entitled How Henry Kissinger Met Your Mother, a parody of the CBS sitcom How I Met Your Mother, which features Henry Kissinger, whose heavy accent makes his speech unintelligible. Once Peter is dressed for court, he explains that even the vending machines at the courthouse are out of order, with Brian then being shown dressed <b>and</b> <b>laughing</b> {{in a similar manner}} as the Hanna-Barbera cartoon character Muttley.|$|E
5|$|Costello {{picks up}} the trenchcoat and shoots more {{subordinates}} who get in his way. Fung is finally the last surviving member, so he attempts to walk nonchalantly by Costello, relying on the Frenchman's inability to recognize him without the coat, but as he is walking by, Costello sees a sticker on Fung's tie. Both men shoot at each other. Fung is hit and Costello demands that he put the coat on, which Fung refuses, so Costello shoots him in the leg. Fung puts the coat on, Costello checks the bullet holes in the coat and sees that they align with the bullets stuck in the bullet-proof vest he was wearing. Costello then stands up and fires a round into Fung's head killing him. Costello is last seen eating <b>and</b> <b>laughing</b> with the woman and children.|$|E
5|$|Picard confronts Q, {{who tells}} him that {{although}} the bout with the Nausicaan nearly cost him his life, it also gave him a sense of his mortality. It taught him that life was too precious to squander by playing it safe. Picard realizes that his attempts to suppress and ignore {{the consequences of his}} indiscretions have resulted in him losing a part of himself. Picard then declares that he would rather die as captain of the Enterprise than live as a nobody. Q sends him back to the bar fight and events unfold as they did originally, with Picard being stabbed through the heart <b>and</b> <b>laughing</b> as he collapses to the floor. In the present, Picard awakens in sickbay, a Captain again. As Picard recovers from his injury, he wonders if his journey into the past was one of Q's tricks or merely a dream. Nevertheless, he is grateful for the insight the experience gave him.|$|E

5|$|Doink the Clown had annoyed Bam Bam Bigelow {{throughout}} October and November {{with such}} pranks as throwing water and confetti {{on him and}} dumping a pail of water on Bigelow's on-screen girlfriend Luna Vachon. He also tied a tripwire across the aisle during one of Bigelow's matches; after Bigelow fell over the wire, Doink attacked him with a broom. Bigelow responded by coming to the ring during one of Doink's matches and destroying Doink's toy wagon. The character of Doink was played by several wrestlers, who occasionally appeared at the same time. The match booked for Survivor Series advertised Bigelow teaming with Bastion Booger, who portrayed an overweight and dirty glutton, and The Headshrinkers (Samu and Fatu), a team of Samoans who were portrayed as savages, to face four Doinks. To promote the match, Doink appeared on the video wall {{that was part of}} the set during Bigelow's matches leading up to the event. The wall used a split screen to show multiple Doinks talking <b>and</b> <b>laughing</b> at the same time.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} a blonde Spears sitting <b>and</b> <b>laughing</b> in a bar with two female friends, but stops {{to look at a}} brunette Spears calling out to her on a small stage in front of them, wearing a leather vest, a studded belt, panties and fishnet {{stockings}} while sporting a tattoo on her biceps. She dances erotically around a pole and up against a mirror. Throughout the video, she continues to dance and flip her hair while special effects lights flash around her as the camera moves slightly in and out of focus to the beat of the song. The video's light systems change from black and white with aura-like blue and pink hues to full blown color. Around the middle of the video, she is joined by two alter egos of her female friends, who also dance around the pole. The blonde Spears and her friends, while watching the dancing, later draw their attention to an attractive man sitting with his friends at a table across the bar.|$|E
5|$|The video {{opens with}} an empty room with a fish painting, and then shows Madonna holding to {{what looks like a}} baby, but is {{actually}} a big bag of water. Alternating scenes shows her in a red and black kimono dancing to the song. Then, a scene features a group of people of Asian heritage, who walk down a dark hallway. As Madonna sings the song in a black kimono, she grips onto the bag of water. When the chorus starts, it features Madonna in a red kimono continuing to dance. This scene carries on {{through the rest of the}} song. There are multiple scenes of Japanese people performing butoh dance moves coached by Swedish choreographer Su-En. These scenes were shot in a decommissioned R1 Reactor below the Royal Institute of Technology in central Stockholm. The ending scene has Madonna sitting while someone is painting her back and slowly rests her body on the group. As the song fades, Madonna is in her red kimono walking <b>and</b> <b>laughing</b> towards the camera and then the screen rapidly fades to black.|$|E

25|$|Most of {{the reports}} in the media tended to be {{critical}} of Patriarch Kirill <b>and</b> <b>laughing</b> at the claims that the dust was harmful, saying that it was just sand {{and it would have been}} far more efficient to just hire a maid to vacuum it up.

25|$|The {{evolutionary}} theory proposed by Darwin states {{that only the}} fittest will survive and by lying, we aim to improve other's perception of our social image and status, capability, and desirability in general. Studies have shown that humans begin lying at a mere age of 6 months, through crying <b>and</b> <b>laughing,</b> to gain attention. Scientific studies have also shown the presence of gender differences in lying.|$|E

25|$|The knives were {{reportedly}} purchased {{two days before}} the attack from a military supply shop in Fukui at about 12:40p.m. Katō spent about 20 minutes in the store, purchasing a telescopic baton and a pair of leather gloves while the store closed-circuit television captured him talking to <b>and</b> <b>laughing</b> with the salesman and demonstrating stabbing motions.

25|$|Commissioner Phiyega of the ANC {{came under}} further {{criticism}} as being insensitive and uncaring {{when she was}} caught smiling <b>and</b> <b>laughing</b> during the Farlam Commission's video playback of the 'massacre'.

Nor did they forget to apply to Forgier's leg some fat chenin grapes, and so handsomely dressed it and bound it up that he was quickly cured.|$|E
25|$|One {{informant}} who {{was close}} to DeStefano described him as a highly emotional, temperamental individual, extremely egotistical and concerned with his personal appearance.

He was described as being of such a temperament {{that he could be}} crying at one moment <b>and</b> <b>laughing</b> the very next. DeStefano would often state if he had not been framed for rape at age 17, he would have been the president of the United States.|$|E

60|$|We {{turned and}} ran. We dashed {{across the open}} spaces and down the slopes unmindful of {{possible}} snakes in the grass, until we reached the woods.

And then, and not till then, in the security of a great fork, we paused, looked at each other, <b>and</b> began to <b>laugh.</b> We held on to each other, arms and legs, our eyes streaming tears, our sides aching, <b>and</b> <b>laughed</b> <b>and</b> <b>laughed</b> <b>and</b> <b>laughed.</b>|$|R
