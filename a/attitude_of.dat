40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{descriptive}} {{study was to examine}} the influence of a clinical practice on the <b>attitudes</b> <b>of</b> diploma nursing students toward the elderly. A pretest-posttest approach, using Kogan's Old People Scale, provided data on the <b>attitudes</b> <b>of</b> nursing students upon entry to the diploma nursing program, and the effect of a clinical practice on those attitudes. A comparison was made of the effect of a clinical practice in special care homes and in acute care institutions on the <b>attitudes</b> <b>of</b> the nursing students toward the elderly. Analysis <b>of</b> the <b>attitudes</b> <b>of</b> nursing students toward the elderly and the demographic characteristics was made. The demographic characteristics examined were age, level of education, previous social contact with the elderly, previous work or volunteer experience with the elderly, religiosity and location <b>of</b> residence. The <b>attitudes</b> <b>of</b> the nursing students upon entry to the nursing program were found to be positive. Of the 181 respondents to the pretest, 98. 3 % had positive attitudes toward the elderly according to the Kogan's Old People Scale. No significant change in the <b>attitudes</b> <b>of</b> the nursing students toward the elderly was found following the clinical practice. There was no significant difference in the <b>attitudes</b> <b>of</b> the students who had a clinical practice in a special care home and those who had a clinical practice in an acute care institution. A significant difference in the <b>attitudes</b> <b>of</b> the nursing students toward the elderly was found according to age of the student and the previous social contact the student had had with the elderly. As the age and the amount of social contact with the elderly increased the <b>attitudes</b> <b>of</b> nursing students toward the elderly became more positive. However, students who had lived with an elderly person were less positive in their attitudes toward the elderly. Recommendations for further research were made based on the findings of the study and the research methodology used in this study. These recommendations have significance for persons involved in the education of health care workers, particularly nursing students...|$|R

Although less than half (40%) of the physicians reported any educational exposure to MM and less than one-quarter (20%) have administered MM in their practice, most (71%) respondents endorsed desiring more instruction in MM. Another small study examined the interest and ability of M.D. residents in learning osteopathic principles and skills, including OMT.

At the same time a change in geo-political orientation towards Europe, coupled with the advent of containerisation meant the whole docking system in the city of Liverpool suffered as newer, stronger ports emerged elsewhere in the UK. Nonetheless the architectural and technological value of the docks was recognised in 1952 when the Albert Dock was granted Grade I listed building status.|$|E

Runciman, a member of the Liberal National Party, was thought by Chamberlain to be lazy. Soon after taking office, Chamberlain instructed his ministers to prepare two-year policy programmes.
