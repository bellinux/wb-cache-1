Johnson Jr. dismissed the report as the product of “Socialist-minded senators.” He also told journalist Bill Minor, “all the Negroes I’ve seen <b>around</b> <b>here</b> are so fat they shine.” Following the publication in June of a particularly severe report complied by the Field Foundation of New York, Governor Johnson quietly commissioned a statewide study about children's nutrition. Its findings concurred with those of the Field Foundation.|$|E
5|$|Some {{critics have}} noted {{similarities}} between names in Septimus Heap {{and those in}} Harry Potter, such as Petroc Trelawney (Jenna's pet rock) and Sybill Trelawney (a professor in Harry Potter); also both series feature Boggarts (which are intelligent Marsh creatures in Septimus Heap and shape-shifters in Harry Potter). In response, British author Phil Knight has commented: The Petroc Trelawney in the Septimus Heap books is {{nothing at all to}} do with Professor Trelawney. He is a Radio 3 presenter who may well be known to Angie Sage personally, but otherwise will be known over the air. Think: why would Jenna call a pet rock 'Trelawney'? To a Radio 3 listener like me, it's perfectly logical... And as for Boggarts, they've been <b>around</b> <b>here</b> in the North of England for a long time. Manchester has Boggart Hole Clough, for example. They're not really like either Sage's or Rowling's creatures, but pre-exist either of them.|$|E

After a loss against Dallas, Tolliver regained his starting job during the game two against the Cincinnati Bengals.

I don’t think as a Christian that it’s right for me to say, ‘I wish you could’ve stayed here,’ because truthfully, we’re getting the raw end of the deal if we really believe what we say that heaven is as great as we want it to be. The whole idea is that we’re the ones who have to wait.” Millard has also noted, [...] "The difference with ‘Homesick’ [...] is that it talks about those who are stuck <b>around</b> <b>here</b> after someone passes away.

A writer of The Independent wrote, [...] "Showing Gaga {{in a number of}} guises (as a Beatnik performance artist, her face smeared with clown make-up, sporting David Bowie-esque androgyny while wearing a bra made of black, leather gloves and as various winged creatures), the high energy accompaniment to her new track is a hotch-potch of imagery that seems to highlight the pop princess' ever changing appearance." [...] Chris Rovzar of Vanity Fair described the video as a moving photo shoot for Interview magazine [...] "except with more sanity". Rovzar concluded that it also featured [...] "the standard Gaga nonsense" [...] and praised Gaga's smile during several scenes of the video as a highlight. James Montgomery of MTV News saw the video as Gaga [...] "pulling the curtain back on her creative process, showing the viewer how she's willing to do anything to please the public."
