5|$|A 2004 {{analysis}} of data from 53 studies involving 83,000 women with breast cancer reported no increased risk among women who had had either an induced or spontaneous abortion. The relative {{risk of breast cancer}} for women who had a spontaneous abortion in this analysis was 0.98, and that for induced <b>abortion</b> <b>was</b> 0.93.|$|E
5|$|Agnes Mary Mansour (April 10, 1931 – December 17, 2004) was an American Roman Catholic nun who {{was given}} a choice from the Vatican in 1983 to end her {{religious}} vows or to resign from her position {{as the director of}} the Michigan Department of Social Services which required her to support and allocate public funding for abortions. The controversy involved her belief that <b>abortion</b> <b>was</b> tragic but should be legal, despite her vows as a religious and the teachings of the Catholic Church.|$|E
5|$|In practice, Russian women saw mixed {{gains in}} their rights under Communism. Women's {{suffrage}} was granted, though voting meant little in Soviet society {{owing to the}} Communist Party's monopoly on power. This monopoly also meant that many independent feminist organizations and journals were shut down. <b>Abortion</b> <b>was</b> legalized in 1920, making the Soviet Union the first country to do so; however, it was banned again between 1936 and 1955. Generous maternity leave was legally required, and a national network of child-care centers was established. The country's first constitution recognized the equal rights of women.|$|E
50|$|Therapeutic <b>abortion</b> <b>is</b> <b>abortion</b> induced {{following}} {{a diagnosis of}} medical necessity. Such <b>abortions</b> <b>are</b> carried out {{in order to avoid}} the risk of substantial harm to the mother. In many countries therapeutical <b>abortion</b> <b>is</b> legal, including some where induced <b>abortion</b> <b>is</b> illegal.|$|R
50|$|In 2004, there <b>were</b> 185,415 <b>abortions</b> in England and Wales. 87% of <b>abortions</b> <b>were</b> {{performed}} at 12 weeks or less and 1.6% (or 2,914 abortions) occurred after 20 weeks. <b>Abortion</b> <b>is</b> free to residents, 82% of <b>abortions</b> <b>were</b> {{carried out by}} the public tax-paid National Health Service.|$|R
50|$|Women who {{consider}} <b>abortion</b> <b>are</b> referred to two doctors. Each doctor then advises her whether <b>abortion</b> <b>is</b> a suitable {{decision based on}} the conditions listed below. An <b>abortion</b> <b>is</b> granted only when the doctors reach a unanimous decision that the woman may terminate her pregnancy. An <b>abortion</b> that <b>is</b> performed without this decision or under any other circumstances is considered unlawful.|$|R
5|$|In the 1990s, {{a number}} of {{activities}} which are or were illegal in other Australian states were legalised in the ACT. These include the sale of X-rated pornographic materials (1989) and prostitution in brothels (1992), although brothels are only permitted {{to operate in the}} suburbs of Hume, Mitchell and Fyshwick. The personal use of cannabis was decriminalised in 1992 and <b>abortion</b> <b>was</b> decriminalised in 2002. In 2006, the ACT Government attempted to introduce a law recognising civil unions, but it was overturned by the federal government.|$|E
5|$|With {{the end of}} Playford's tenure, the LCL {{had brought}} younger, more {{progressive}} members into its ranks. The Hall Government continued many of the social reforms that the Walsh/Dunstan governments had initiated; most of these at the instigation of Hall or his Attorney-General, Robin Millhouse. <b>Abortion</b> <b>was</b> partially legalised, and planning for the Festival Centre began. The conservative and rural factions of the League, notably in the Legislative Council dominated by the landed gentry, were bitterly opposed to some reforms, and more than once Hall was forced to rely on Labor support to see bills passed. The LCL began to break apart; {{what had once been}} a united party was now factionalised—four distinct groups across the political spectrum appeared within the party. The economy of South Australia began to pick up under Hall, returning to full employment. During the term in opposition, Des Corcoran became Dunstan's deputy, and the pair worked together well despite any rift that may have been caused by the struggle to succeed Walsh.|$|E
25|$|<b>Abortion</b> <b>was</b> {{also made}} legal without arousing much public attention, by {{removing}} the penalty for performing the operation embodied in a law dealing with medical malpractice. 	All labor laws and regulations were revised to eliminate sex discrimination and incorporate equal pay for equal work. Women were encouraged to run for political office.|$|E
25|$|<b>Abortion</b> <b>is</b> {{illegal in}} Brazil {{except for the}} case of rape or when the mother's life is in danger. Though <b>abortions</b> <b>are</b> against the law, it is {{estimated}} that over one million <b>abortions</b> <b>are</b> performed in Brazil each year, though data on <b>abortion</b> incidence <b>is</b> not systemically collected. Over two hundred thousand women <b>are</b> treated for <b>abortion</b> complications each year in Brazilian hospitals. The punishment for a woman performing an abortion on herself or consenting to an <b>abortion</b> <b>is</b> one to three years of imprisonment. The punishment for those performing <b>abortions</b> <b>is</b> one to four years of imprisonment, and this number increases by one-third if harm is caused to the women or one-half if the abortion leads to the death of the woman.|$|R
5000|$|According to Archbishop Jose Antonio Eguren in Peru, {{indirect}} <b>abortion</b> <b>is</b> not {{the same}} as a therapeutic abortion. Eguren asserts that indirect <b>abortion</b> <b>is</b> an extraordinary moral case which has nothing to do ‘therapeutic abortion’ in Catholic doctrine, therapeutic abortion simply does not exist, since <b>abortion</b> <b>is</b> never a cure for anything.|$|R
5000|$|In many places, where <b>abortion</b> <b>is</b> {{illegal or}} carries a heavy social stigma, medical {{reporting}} of <b>abortion</b> <b>is</b> not reliable. [...] For this reason, {{estimates of the}} incidence of <b>abortion</b> must <b>be</b> made without determining certainty related to standard error.|$|R
25|$|The English law on <b>abortion</b> <b>was</b> first codified in {{legislation}} under sections 1 and 2 of Malicious Shooting or Stabbing Act 1803. The Bill {{was proposed}} by the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, Edward Law, 1st Baron Ellenborough to clarify the law relating to abortion {{and was the first}} law to explicitly outlaw it. The Act provided that it was an offence for any person to perform or cause an abortion. The punishment for performing or attempting to perform a post quickening <b>abortion</b> <b>was</b> the death penalty (section 1) and otherwise was transportation for fourteen years (section 2). In 19th-century America, there was little regulation of abortion, in the tradition of English common law, pre quickening abortions were considered at most a misdemeanor. These cases proved difficult to prosecute as the testimony of the mother was usually the only means to determine when quickening had occurred.|$|E
25|$|The {{character}} was initially {{the subject of}} a controversial and landmark abortion storyline back in the early 1970s, having been the fetus in which the <b>abortion</b> <b>was</b> centered. When the abortion storyline was rewritten to not have been an abortion after all, controversy ensued again, as viewers felt that it was an undoing of a groundbreaking event in television history.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} birth control, {{also known as}} {{contraception}} and fertility control, refers to the methods or devices that have been historically used to prevent pregnancy. Planning and provision of birth control is called family planning. In some times and cultures, abortion had none of the stigma which it has today, making birth control less important; <b>abortion</b> <b>was</b> in practice a means of birth control.|$|E
50|$|Abortion: <b>Abortion</b> <b>is</b> the willful {{taking of}} {{innocent}} human life. Human life begins at conception {{because there is}} simply no other point that it can begin. Therefore, <b>abortion</b> <b>is</b> not acceptable under any circumstance except in the rare and unusual instance where {{the life of the mother}} is at real risk. Only then should an <b>abortion</b> <b>be</b> considered.|$|R
50|$|The pro-life {{movement}} {{is concerned that}} there are no legal restrictions against abortion in Canada, and that <b>abortions</b> <b>are</b> funded by provincial health care programs, even if the <b>abortion</b> <b>is</b> not for therapeutic reasons. A medical reason for obtaining an <b>abortion</b> <b>is</b> no longer required in Canada (except in Prince Edward Island) since the 1988 removal of abortion from the Criminal Code.|$|R
50|$|In Hinduism, it is a woman’s human duty {{to produce}} offspring, thus having an <b>abortion</b> <b>is</b> a {{violation}} of that duty. The Vedas, which is an age-old sacred Hindi text, suggests that <b>abortion</b> <b>is</b> more sinful than killing a priest or one’s own parents. The practice of a woman having an <b>abortion</b> <b>is</b> deemed as unacceptable in the Hindu community, both socially and morally.|$|R
25|$|In {{subsequent}} issues OZ {{made several}} {{investigations into the}} murky realms of Sydney's underworld. One celebrated feature delved into the illegal abortion rackets which were then flourishing in Sydney (and around Australia), because at that time <b>abortion</b> <b>was</b> still illegal {{for all but the}} most exceptional cases, and corrupt police were widely believed to be running lucrative protection rackets that netted them substantial sums.|$|E
25|$|A list {{of plants}} which cause <b>abortion</b> <b>was</b> {{provided}} in De viribus herbarum, an 11th-century herbal {{written in the}} form of a poem, the authorship of which is incorrectly attributed to Aemilius Macer. Among them were rue, Italian catnip, savory, sage, soapwort, cyperus, white and black hellebore, and pennyroyal. Physicians in the Islamic world during the medieval period documented the use of abortifacients, commenting on their effectiveness and prevalence.|$|E
25|$|Abortion {{remains one}} of the most {{controversial}} topics in the United States. Roe v. Wade was passed in 1973, and <b>abortion</b> <b>was</b> utilized by many antifeminists to rally supporters. Antiabortion views helped further several right-wing movements, including explicit antifeminism, and helped right-wing politicians rise to power. Antiabortion writings, as well as conservative commentary in the late 20th century criticized the selfishness and self-centeredness of the feminist movement regarding abortions.|$|E
50|$|A medical <b>{{abortion}}</b> <b>is</b> {{a type of}} non-surgical {{abortion in}} which abortifacient pharmaceutical drugs are used to induce abortion. An oral preparation for medical <b>abortion</b> <b>is</b> {{commonly referred to as}} an abortion pill.|$|R
50|$|Since <b>{{abortion}}</b> <b>is</b> {{illegal in}} Nigeria, many women resort to unsafe abortion methods, leading to abortion-related complications and increasing mortality and morbidity {{rates in the}} country. According to research done by the Guttmacher Institute, an estimated 456,000 unsafe <b>abortions</b> <b>are</b> done in Nigeria every year. In a joint study {{carried out by the}} Society of Gynecologists and Obstetricians of Nigeria and Nigeria's Ministry of Health, estimates of women who engage in unsafe <b>abortion</b> <b>were</b> put at about 20,000 each year. Research has revealed that only 40% of <b>abortions</b> <b>are</b> performed by physicians with improved health facilities while the remaining percentage are performed by non-physicians.|$|R
25|$|<b>Abortion</b> in Australia <b>is</b> {{a subject}} of state law rather than {{national}} law. The grounds on which <b>abortion</b> <b>is</b> permitted in Australia {{vary from state to}} state. In every state, <b>abortion</b> <b>is</b> legal to protect the life and health of the woman, though each state has a different definition.|$|R
25|$|Although <b>abortion</b> <b>was</b> {{accepted}} in Rome, attitudes {{changed with the}} spread of Christianity and around 211 AD emperors Septimius Severus and Caracalla banned abortion as infringing on parental rights; temporary exile was the punishment. Punishment for abortion in the Roman Republic was generally inflicted {{as a violation of}} the father's right to dispose of his offspring. Because of the influence of Stoicism, which did not view the fetus as a person, the Romans did not punish abortion as homicide.|$|E
25|$|In {{reproductive}} rights, feminists {{sought the}} right to contraception and birth control, which were almost universally restricted until the 1960s. Feminists hoped to use the first birth control pill to free women to decide the terms under which they will bear children. They felt that reproductive self-control was essential for full economic independence from men. Access to <b>abortion</b> <b>was</b> also widely demanded for these reasons, but was more difficult to secure due to existing, deep societal divisions over the issue.|$|E
25|$|Although <b>abortion</b> <b>was</b> illegal, it was {{nevertheless}} {{the most}} widespread form of birth control in use. Used predominantly by working-class women, the procedure was used {{not only as a}} means of terminating pregnancy, but also to prevent poverty and unemployment. Those who transported contraceptives could be legally punished. Contraceptives became more expensive over time and had a high failure rate. Unlike contraceptives, abortion did not need any prior planning and was less expensive. Newspaper advertisements were used to promote and sell abortifacients indirectly.|$|E
50|$|<b>Abortion</b> <b>is</b> {{illegal in}} the Philippines. Unsafe abortions render women {{vulnerable}} {{not only to}} infections and other health complications, but even to death. Because these <b>abortions</b> <b>are</b> carried out in illegal <b>abortion</b> clinics there <b>is</b> no record of how many women and children, if any, die each year as a result.|$|R
50|$|<b>Abortion</b> <b>is</b> {{legal in}} nearly every European country {{although}} there is a wide variation in the restrictions under which it is permitted. Restrictions on <b>abortion</b> <b>are</b> most stringent in countries that are more strongly observant of the Catholic faith.|$|R
50|$|In {{a written}} answer to Jim Allister the Northern Ireland health {{minister}} Edwin Poots disclosed that 394 <b>abortions</b> <b>were</b> {{carried out in}} Northern hospitals for the period 2005/06 to 2009/10 with the footnote that reasons for <b>abortions</b> <b>were</b> not gathered centrally.|$|R
25|$|Official {{results of}} the {{referendum}} showed that 59.24% of the Portuguese approved the proposal put on ballot, while 40.76% rejected it. However, only 43.61% of the registered voters turned out to vote. Since abstention was over 50%, according to the Portuguese Constitution, these results are not legally binding, and parliament can legally decide to disregard them. Prime Minister Sócrates nevertheless confirmed that he would expand {{the circumstances under which}} <b>abortion</b> <b>was</b> allowed, since a majority of voters had been in favour.|$|E
25|$|In the 1970s de Beauvoir became {{active in}} France's women's liberation movement. She wrote and signed the Manifesto of the 343 in 1971, a {{manifesto}} {{that included a}} list of famous women {{who claimed to have}} had an abortion, then illegal in France. Some argue most of the women had not had abortions, including Beauvoir, but given the secrecy surrounding the issue, this cannot be known. Signatories were diverse as Catherine Deneuve, Delphine Seyrig and de Beauvoir's sister Poupette. In 1974, <b>abortion</b> <b>was</b> legalised in France.|$|E
25|$|Hoxha's {{governance}} {{was also}} distinguished by his encouragement {{of a high}} birthrate policy. For instance, a woman who bore an above-average number of children would be given the government award of Heroine Mother (in Albanian: Nënë Heroinë) along with cash rewards. <b>Abortion</b> <b>was</b> essentially restricted (to encourage high birth rates), except if the birth posed {{a danger to the}} mother's life, though it was not completely banned; the process being decided by district medical commissions. As a result, the population of Albania tripled from 1 million in 1944 to around 3million in 1985.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Abortions</b> <b>are</b> {{considered}} haram because Islam {{does not}} allow violence to be done once the pregnancy has occurred. [...] However, this excludes the situation when {{the life of the}} mother is in jeopardy; then the <b>abortion</b> <b>is</b> no longer considered haram.|$|R
50|$|Most South American {{countries}} grant unconditional {{birthright citizenship}} and allow dual citizenship, but their strict abortion laws make them risky birth-tourism destinations {{in case of}} complications during the pregnancy. In Argentina, <b>abortion</b> <b>is</b> restricted to cases of maternal life, mental health, health, or rape. In Brazil, <b>abortion</b> <b>is</b> restricted to cases of maternal life, mental health, health, rape, or fetal defects. In Chile, <b>abortion</b> <b>is</b> forbidden completely, even if the pregnant woman's life is in danger.|$|R
50|$|Persons {{performing}} illegal <b>abortions</b> <b>are</b> {{subject to}} payment of a monetary penalty or imprisonment {{of up to}} five years. A woman who procures an illegal <b>abortion</b> <b>is</b> subject to a payment of a monetary penalty or imprisonment of up to three years.|$|R
