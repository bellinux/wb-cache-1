In order to sell a product that claims to be organic, it must be certified. If there are specific ingredients in a product that are certified organic, this may be specified on the packaging.

40|$|Pests and grapevine {{diseases}} in organic production are suppressed by preventive measures {{with a view}} to reducing the impact of the attack. <b>Allowed</b> <b>substances</b> acting on patogenous fungi, insects, mites and other harmful organisms are used, if appropriate. Insecticides of plant origin are used in the organic production of grapevine, as well as vegetable oils, powders and insecticidal soaps that are selective, with a narrow range of effects and of lower toxicity, as well as biological products. As a rule, such plant protection products require a more frequent application. Copper-based and sulphur-based fungicides are still leading products in suppressing grapevine diseases. Researches are directed to decrease the quantity of application and to find their replacement by also efficient fungicides. A special emphasis is put on researching the efficient fungicides for suppressing Botrytis bunch rot and factors causing grapevine wood diseases (Esca and Eutypa) in organic production. Along with copper and sulphur, different substances such as bicarbonates, plant extracts and oils, biological products being parasites, patogenous or diseases agent antagonists, and natural products such as milk and whey are applied in the organic production of grapevine...|$|E

500|$|In epilepsy, the {{resistance}} of excitatory neurons to fire during this period is decreased. This may occur due to changes in ion channels or inhibitory neurons not functioning properly. This then results in a specific area from which seizures may develop, known as a [...] "seizure focus". Another mechanism of epilepsy may be the up-regulation of excitatory circuits or down-regulation of inhibitory circuits following an injury to the brain.

50|$|All {{living cells}} {{have the ability}} to receive and process signals that {{originate}} outside of their walls, which they do by means of proteins called receptors, usually found on a cell's surface. When such signals bind to a receptor, they effectively direct the cell to do something, such as dividing, dying, or <b>allowing</b> <b>substances</b> to be created, or to enter or exit the cell. A cell's ability to respond to a chemical message depends on the presence of receptors tuned to that message. The more receptors a cell has that are tuned to the message, the more the cell will respond to it.|$|R

40|$|The USDA {{established}} the National Organic Program (NOP) to develop {{national standards for}} organically produced agricultural products and establish an organic certification program {{as required by the}} Organic Foods Production Act (OFPA) passed by Congress in 1990. Organic crop production excludes conventional pesticides, petroleum – based fertilizers, and sewage sludge based fertilizers with some notable exceptions. OFPA also required the establishment of the “National List of <b>Allowed</b> and Prohibited <b>Substances</b> ” for use in organic agriculture. The National List includes <b>allowed</b> synthetic <b>substances</b> and prohibited non-synthetic (natural) materials. The NOP crop standards require that soil fertility and crop nutrients be managed through tillage and cultivation practices, crop rotations and cover crops, supplemented with animal and crop waste materials, <b>allowed</b> mined <b>substances,</b> and synthetic materials allowed on the National List. Similarly, crop pests, weeds, and diseases are required to be controlled primarily through cultural practices such as tillage and cultivation, hand weeding, crop rotations, sanitation, and the introduction of predators or parasites.

50|$|The outer {{membrane}} {{complex is}} made up largely by the secretin GspD. Secretins are β-barrels that are found in membrane where they form channels that <b>allow</b> <b>substances</b> to move {{in or out of}} cells. In the type II secretion system GspD creates a pore in the outer membrane of the bacterial cell through which proteins can be secreted. As a result, GspD is essential for the correct function system because without it secretory proteins cannot exit the cell. GspD is transported into the periplasm via the Sec translocon and is then inserted into the outer membrane. This insertion is not spontaneous however and is often reliant upon the β-barrel assembly machinery which ensures β-barrel proteins are folded correctly before insertion into the membrane.|$|R

50|$|An ISFET's {{source and}} drain are {{constructed}} {{as for a}} MOSFET. The gate electrode is separated from the channel by a barrier which is sensitive to hydrogen ions and a gap to <b>allow</b> the <b>substance</b> under test to {{come in contact with}} the sensitive barrier.

50|$|To put {{the above}} simply, cells do not usually allow {{certain types of}} {{substances}} into their interior space.

40|$|Measurement of hepatic blood {{perfusion}} and of {{the exchange}} of substances between blood and cells is a challenge. Long before the development of PET, multiple indicator data were analysed using models based on elaborate capillary theories. Today, PET is a unique modality that allows external quantitative measurements of the regional distribution of intravenously injected radiotracers and their metabolites in tissues, but dynamic PET data are analysed using less physiologically based schemes. The standard compartment model is an inlet equilibration model that does not naturally incorporate blood flow, and a single-uptake model that does not <b>allow</b> <b>substances</b> to re-enter the capillaries. These deficiencies lead to paradoxes when modelling fast blood-cell exchange. We have combined compartmental and capillary theory and developed microvascular models that account for blood flow and concentration gradients in capillaries. The microvascular models {{can be regarded as}} revisions of the input function which include more physiological realism and provide a superior description and interpretation of dynamic PET data when compared to the standard compartmental scheme...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSubstance P and {{selective}} neurokinin receptor agonists {{have been tested}} {{for their ability to}} induce shape change in rabbit platelets. Substance P and the NK 1 receptor agonist Ac [Arg 6,Sar 9,Met(O 2) 11]-substance P (6 – 11) induced shape change (EC 50 = 3 and 6 nM, respectively), whereas the selective NK 2 agonist [Nle 10]-Neurokinin A (4 – 10) and the selective NK 3 agonist [MePhe 7]-Neurokinin B did not show any effect. Moreover, the specific NK 1 receptor antagonist CP- 96, 345 selectively and dose-dependently counteracted the effect of substance P or of the NK 1 receptor agonist (IC 50 = 2 and 0. 8 nM, respectively), whereas the selective NK 2 receptor antagonist, SR 48968, had no effect. Unlike for serotonin or low doses of ADP, epinephrine did not <b>allow</b> <b>substance</b> P or the NK 1 receptor agonist to become a proaggregating substance. These data therefore show that the NK 1 receptor is solely involved in the neurokinin-induced shape change of rabbit platelets...|$|R
50|$|In 2004, {{along with}} two British trade associations, ANH had a legal {{challenge}} to the European Union's Food Supplements Directive referred to the European Court of Justice by the High Court in London. The European Court of Justice's Advocate General said that the EU's plan to tighten rules {{on the sale of}} vitamins and nutritional supplements should be scrapped but was overruled by the European Court, which decided that the measures in question were necessary and appropriate for the purpose of protecting public health. ANH interpreted the ban as applying only to synthetically produced supplements - and not to vitamins and minerals normally found in or consumed as part of the diet.

50|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} how blood is delivered to cranial tissues, {{it is important to}} understand the vascular anatomy of the space itself. Large cerebral arteries in the brain split into smaller arterioles, also known as pial arteries. These consist of endothelial cells and smooth muscle, and as these pial arteries further branch and run deeper into the brain, they associate with glial cells, namely astrocytes and pericytes. The intracerebral arterioles and capillaries are unlike systemic arterioles and capillaries in that they do not readily <b>allow</b> <b>substances</b> to diffuse through them; they are connected by tight junctions in order to form the blood brain barrier (BBB). Endothelial cells, smooth muscle, neurons, astrocytes, and pericytes work together in the brain order to maintain the BBB while still delivering nutrients to tissues and adjusting blood flow in the intracranial space to maintain homeostasis. As they work as a functional unit, alterations in their interactions at the cellular level can impair HR in the brain and lead to deviations in normal nervous function.|$|R
5000|$|As {{compared}} to inhalation, intratracheal instillation allows {{greater control over}} the dose and location of the substance, is cheaper and less technically demanding, allows lower amounts of scarce or expensive substances to be used, <b>allows</b> <b>substances</b> to be tested that can be inhaled by humans but not small mammals, and minimizes exposure to laboratory workers and to the skin of laboratory animals. Disadvantages include its nonphysiological and invasive nature, the confounding effects of the delivery vehicle and anesthesia, {{and the fact that}} it bypasses the upper respiratory tract. Instillation results in a less uniform distribution of the substance than inhalation, and the substance is cleared from the respiratory tract more slowly. [...] Their results provide a quick screen of potential toxicity and can be used to test its mechanism, but may not be directly applicable to occupational exposure that occurs over an extended period. [...] Some of these difficulties are overcome by another method, pharyngeal aspiration, which is less technically difficult and causes less trauma to the animal, and has a pulmonary deposition pattern more similar to inhalation.|$|R

40|$|The fixed-dose {{procedure}} (FDP) {{was introduced}} as OECD Test Guideline 420 in 1992, {{as an alternative}} to the conventional median lethal dose (LD 50) test for the as-sessment of acute oral toxicity (OECD Test Guideline 401). The FDP uses fewer animals and causes less suffering than the conventional test, while providing information on the acute toxicity to <b>allow</b> <b>substances</b> to be ranked according to the EU hazard classification system. Recently the FDP has been revised, with the aim of providing further reductions and refinements, and classification according to the criteria of the Globally Harmonized Hazard Classification and Labelling scheme (GHS). This paper describes the revised FDP and analyses its properties, as determined by a statistical modelling approach. The analysis shows that the revised FDP classifies substances for acute oral toxicity gener-ally in the same, or a more stringent, hazard class as that based on the LD 50 value, according to either the GHS or the EU classification scheme. The likelihood of achieving the same classification is greatest for sub-stances with a steep dose±response curve and median toxic dose (TD 50) close to the LD 50. The revised FDP usually requires five or six animals with two or fewer dying as a result of treatment in most cases. Human &...|$|R
40|$|Terahertz {{radiation}} {{has many}} unique properties that {{lends itself to}} applications not possible elsewhere in the electromagnetic spectrum. The wavelength is long enough to pass through many materials that are opaque in the visible spectrum but short enough to form sub-millimetre resolution images. The frequency band also contains the rotational and vibrational spectra of many molecules due to intra- and inter-molecular resonances <b>allowing</b> <b>substances</b> to be identified by their spectral signature. Potential applications for terahertz technology range from security to medicine to communications. Current terahertz imaging systems [1] are limited to acquiring {{one or a few}} pixels at a time leading to impractically long image acquisition times. Large terahertz imaging arrays are therefore needed to fully realise the potential of terahertz technology. To address this need a focal plane array of antennas is being investigated for terahertz imaging (Fig. 1). Dielectric rod antennas were chosen as the array elements as they are broadband, perform well in an array and have the potential for compatibility with superconducting detectors [2] and bulk micromachining fabrication processes. This paper examines a number of different schemes for exciting the dielectric rod antennas using planar sources. To assess the excitation efficiency of the different schemes the fields are decomposed into their guided, leaky and radiation components [3]: (1) radiatio...|$|R
