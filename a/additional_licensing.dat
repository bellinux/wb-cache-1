5000|$|When a song is {{cleared for}} usage on a TV show, {{historically}} to save money, the clearance typically {{applies only to}} television airings of the show in question. Thus, when the show is considered for DVD distribution to the home video market, {{the rights to the}} song must be renegotiated in order for the song in question to be included on the DVD.

5000|$|Click-wrap license {{agreements}} {{refer to}} website based contract formation (see iLan Systems, Inc. v. Netscout Service Level Corp.). A common {{example of this}} occurs where a user must affirmatively assent to license terms of a website, by clicking [...] "yes" [...] on a pop-up, in order to access website features. This is therefore analogous to shrink-wrap licenses, where a buyer implied agrees to license terms by first removing the software package's shrink-wrap and then utilizing the software itself. In both types of analysis, {{focus is on the}} actions of end user and asks whether there is an explicit or implicit acceptance of the <b>additional</b> <b>licensing</b> terms.|$|E

50|$|The licence {{usually has}} two {{separate}} functions: To allow a DJ to copy and digitise music {{from other sources}} to a computer's hard drive, and to allow playing of music bought from an online music store. In the first case, a licence is needed because {{a copy of the}} original recording is used, and in the second, because the copyright collecting agencies of the countries which require licensing hold, that music bought from online music stores such as iTunes or Beatport requires <b>additional</b> <b>licensing</b> before it can be played publicly, thus making downloaded music not comparable to cds and vinyl, which do not require an additional licence on the DJ's part to be played, as the venue where the music is played usually pays for a music licence which allows recorded music to be played. The reasoning for this is that music from online music stores is usually licensed solely for private use.|$|E

Development plans include [...] "a solid, high quality, Linux and Mac build, and then eventually PC" [...] and beta releases for existing Humble Store and Humble Bundle customers to evaluate and test. He also mentions that the development is still experimental and that there will not be any Steam or other build replacements until the team are satisfied with the quality of this port. In another blog post, on 11 March 2014, announcing his employment with Valve Corporation, Robert also mentions that the bulk of the port has been completed, with just a little of the back-end and scripting development remaining and that {{he should be able to}} finish the port in his spare time with ease.|$|E
