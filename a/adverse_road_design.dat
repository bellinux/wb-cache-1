40|$|Many of the speed, {{flow and}} density {{relationships}} postulated in different literatures {{are based on}} empirical evidences collected under favourable conditions. Those that veered into comparative analysis under contrast-ing conditions often use forced curves to describe the relationship between speed and flow mainly because the graph is not a function. However, the paper {{is an attempt to}} postulate that dynamic speed-flow, speed-density and flow-density functions have similar behavioural pattern. In the study, speed and flow relationship under <b>adverse</b> <b>road</b> surface condition depicted with potholes and edge subsidence among others was investigated. The study was carried out in Nigeria where <b>adverse</b> <b>road</b> surface condition on principal roads is prevalent under day-light, dry weather and off-peak conditions. It is based on the hypothesis that <b>adverse</b> <b>road</b> surface condition has significant impact on otherwise uninterrupted traffic stream. The paper compared empirical survey data from 11 locations on roadway segments with control and adverse sections. Optimum speeds for control and <b>adverse</b> <b>road</b> sections were estimated and compared. The study found 50 % reduction in optimum speed and concluded that significant speed reduction will occur under <b>adverse</b> <b>road</b> surface condition...|$|R

40|$|Proper <b>road</b> <b>design</b> {{is crucial}} to prevent human errors in traffic and less human errors will result in less accidents. Three safety {{principles}} have to be appJied in a systematic and consistent manner to prevent human errors: prevent unintended use of roads and streets; prevent large discrepancies in speed, direction and mass at moderate and high speed; prevent uncertainty amongst road users, i. e. enhance the predictability of the road's course and people's behaviour on the road. It {{is to be expected}} that proper <b>road</b> <b>design,</b> according to these safety principles, could reduce considerably the number of accidents and accident rates in Europe. <b>Road</b> <b>design</b> standards play a vita! role in <b>road</b> <b>design.</b> However, the unavailability and the non-accordance of <b>road</b> <b>design</b> standards in Europe increase risks and therefore contribute to the actual size of the road safety problem.

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the results of}} a study carried out for the European Union. The report uses the safety principle that: (i) proper <b>road</b> <b>design</b> is crucial to prevent human errors in traffic; and (ii) less human errors will result in less accidents. The study contains the following parts: (1) gathering information about existing knowledge on the <b>design</b> of <b>road</b> infrastructure elements by: (a) drawing an inventory of international treaties and recommendations, with information about their legal status; and (b) drawing an inventory of national <b>road</b> <b>design</b> standards and the underlying knowledge; (2) analysing the role road safety arguments have played, when <b>road</b> <b>design</b> standards were compiled; and (3) drawing a `best practice' for <b>road</b> <b>design</b> standards. Detailed studies were only carried out into: (i) cross-sections including medians, shoulders and verges; (ii) motorway exits and entries; (iii) curves in two-lane roads; and (iv) bicycle facilities at intersections. Preliminary considerations are given, for instance, to: the status of the standards, assumptions underlying the standards, and road classification. The study also summarizes the research methods to be used, when quantifying the relationship between <b>road</b> <b>design</b> standards, accidents and road user behaviour. The study reveals that existing national standards in Europe hardly contain information on the safety effects of the required <b>road</b> <b>designs.</b> For the annexes, see ST 951585 - ST 951596.

40|$|In the Netherlands, the Sustainable Safety {{vision is}} an {{important}} guide in improving road safety. In this vision, a central principle is 'predictability'. This principle builds {{on the idea that}} the <b>road</b> <b>design</b> should conform to the expectations of road users in order to prevent errors that could lead to road crashes. To study the effect of a predictable <b>road</b> <b>design</b> on driver behaviour, we examined speed and lateral position at rural roads that varied in their predictability. These behaviours were examined in light of general safety effects and a more specific hypothesis thatuunderlies the predictability principle: does a predictable <b>road</b> <b>design</b> lead to more homogenous road user behaviour (and thus to more predictable and safer behaviour) ?uThe results of this study showed that the more 'predictable' <b>road</b> <b>designs</b> induced more homogeneous lateral positions between vehicles, whereas speed distribution remained unchanged. The more 'predictable' roads also resulted in lower (and thus safer) mean speeds and lateral positions that were closer to the shoulder of the road and. Because of the potential safety effects of <b>road</b> <b>design</b> on behaviour, these effects should be examined as a whole, before implementation of the design. (Author/publisher) ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{whether you}} can achieve the same positive effect regarding traffic safety, while also increasing the capacity and level of service of the road by building a narrow 2 + 2 lane road instead of a 2 + 1 lane road, with minimal increase in construction costs. While the safety, costs and traffic operations aspects of the different <b>road</b> <b>designs</b> {{are the most important}} to evaluate, the non-monetized impacts like landscape, local surroundings and outdoor activities, biodiversity, cultural heritage and natural resources are also considered, as is standard in Norwegian consequence analysis methodology. An extensive literature review was carried out for evaluating different aspects of the 2 + 1 lane <b>road</b> <b>design</b> and the narrow 2 + 2 lane <b>road</b> <b>design</b> regarding design, safety, capacity and level of service, monetized impacts and non-monetized impacts. In addition, the methods in Highway Capacity Manual are applied for calculation and evaluation of the level of service, and the program EFFEKT is used to estimate the monetized impacts, in connection with a case study of a project in Norway where a narrow 2 + 2 lane road configuration has been used. The overall impression is that the 2 + 1 lane <b>road</b> <b>design</b> has a slight advantage over the narrow 2 + 2 lane <b>road</b> <b>design</b> regarding traffic safety because of wider lanes and shoulders, assumed lower mean speed and possibly less rutting. The size of the presumed safety advantage is not possible to quantify from the content of this thesis. Based on the findings presented in this thesis the capacity and level of service provided by the narrow 2 + 2 lane <b>road</b> <b>design</b> is higher than what the 2 + 1 lane <b>road</b> <b>design</b> can offer. Whether the higher capacity and level of service make the narrow 2 + 2 lane <b>road</b> <b>design</b> more economical beneficial than the 2 + 1 lane <b>road</b> <b>design</b> seems to depend on the expected amount of traffic. As long as the average travel speed for the 2 + 1 lane road was not significantly lower than for the narrow 2 + 2 lane road, the 2 + 1 lane <b>road</b> <b>design</b> scored the highest benefit-cost ratio for the case scenarios. When it comes to the non-monetized impacts it seems to be so small differences between the two designs that there is no basis to distinguish them. Other elements like location of the road and route alignment {{are more likely to have}} a bigger impact when less than two meters separates the cross section widths...|$|R

Both programs proved to be similar in many ways, but some of the functions and the structure of the programs themselves make them quite different. I found that Civil 3 D is a great choice due to the function Design Criteria, which allows you to create <b>roads</b> with <b>design</b> standards {{in the early stages of}} the <b>road</b> <b>designing</b> process. I also made the conclusion that Novapoint is a great program for learning the basics in <b>road</b> <b>designing,</b> due to being more user friendly and easier to learn for inexperienced people.
