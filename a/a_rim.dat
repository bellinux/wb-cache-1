5|$|The name first {{appears in}} Saxon {{charters}} in around AD 880 as Cantuctun and two centuries {{later in the}} Domesday Book as Cantoctona and Cantetone. The name means settlement by <b>a</b> <b>rim</b> or circle of hills; Cantuc is Celtic for <b>a</b> <b>rim</b> or circle, and -ton or -tun is Old English for a settlement. The highest point of the hills is called Will's Neck meaning ridge of the Welshman, probably referring {{to a time when}} the hills marked the boundary between the expanding Saxon kingdom of Wessex and the lands of the Britons or 'Welsh' to the West. A battle was fought locally at that time.|$|E
5|$|Thyroid follicles {{are small}} spherical groupings of cells 0.02–0.9mm in {{diameter}} that play the main role in thyroid function. They consist of <b>a</b> <b>rim</b> {{that has a}} rich blood supply, nerve and lymphatic presence, that surrounds a core of colloid that consists mostly of thyroid hormone precursor proteins called thyroglobulin, an iodinated glycoprotein.|$|E
5|$|Dorsally, {{the color}} pattern {{consists}} of a deep yellow, tan, or brown ground color, with three series of dark brown spots that run {{the length of the}} body. Each of these spots has a black ring around it, the outer border of which is intensified with <b>a</b> <b>rim</b> of white or yellow. The dorsal spots, which usually number 23–30, may grow together, while the side spots may break apart. The head has a pair of distinct dark patches, one on each temple, together with a pinkish, salmon, or brownish V or X marking that forms an apex towards the snout. Behind the eye is a dark streak, outlined in white, pink, or buff. The venter is white, whitish, yellowish, or pinkish, often with an irregular scattering of dark spots.|$|E
50|$|Glaze <b>A</b> bowl <b>rims</b> are in-curving {{and of a}} {{consistent}} thickness. The lips are rounded or squared. Glaze A is often dated from AD 1315 to 1425 (Wilson 2005:47), but the end date applies only from the Albuquerque area north. In {{the southern part of}} the range, bowls with Glaze <b>A</b> <b>rims</b> were made until AD 1500 or later (Franklin 2007).|$|R
50|$|Although most Glaze <b>A</b> <b>rims</b> {{were quite}} simple, one {{contemporary}} variant has <b>a</b> slightly flaring <b>rim</b> (Honea 1966). Examples with one slip color {{are classified as}} Sanchez Glaze-on-red or Sanchez Glaze-on-yellow. Examples with contrasting white (interior) and red (exterior) slips, and with black glaze paint, are termed Sanchez Glaze Polychrome (Wilson 2005:52 - 54).|$|R
50|$|There {{was only}} one piece of jarlet. It had <b>an</b> out-turned <b>rim,</b> <b>a</b> short neck plus <b>an</b> {{ellipsoidal}} body. <b>Rim</b> diameter {{was measured to be}} 6.8 cm, maximum body width is 10 cm and height is 6.5 cm. Horizontal markings caused by wiping at the rim and neck were identified as well.|$|R

25|$|It is {{possible}} to ride a bicycle with a buckled wheel if it has disk brakes, where {{it would not be}} possible with <b>a</b> <b>rim</b> brake because the buckled wheel would bind on the brake pads.|$|E
25|$|Pattern IV : The scar {{presents}} sharp {{borders and}} oligodendrocyte degeneration, with <b>a</b> <b>rim</b> of normal appearing white matter. There {{is a lack}} of oligodendrocytes {{in the center of the}} scar. There is no complement activation or MAG loss.|$|E

50|$|This is a {{circular}} crater with <b>an</b> outer <b>rim</b> that has <b>an</b> uneven form due to multiple small outward bulges. The perimeter {{is only slightly}} worn, and retains <b>a</b> sharp <b>rim</b> that projects above the surroundings. Two notable craters {{are attached to the}} outer rim: Chaffee F to the west and Chaffee W along the northwest. Chaffee actually intrudes somewhat into the former crater, and the two share <b>a</b> common <b>rim.</b> There is also a tiny craterlet exactly on the rim to the south-southeast.|$|R
25|$|Occasionally, the {{hardware}} is used percussively as well, {{the most common}} example being <b>a</b> <b>rim</b> shot. John Morrison is noted for his drum solos played entirely on a hi-hat stand (and occasionally also on {{other parts of the}} kit hardware, adjacent furniture, and audience).|$|E
25|$|The chasma has {{a rather}} complex {{structure}} {{consisting of two}} narrow branches towards the south. Its exterior walls are made of multiple sub-parallel scarps and terraces. At some places the chasma has <b>a</b> <b>rim</b> standing as high as 0.5km about the surrounding cratered planes. Its width varies from only a few kilometers at some places to more than 100km.|$|E
25|$|Classic male-pattern {{hair loss}} begins above the temples and vertex (calvaria) of the scalp. As it progresses, <b>a</b> <b>rim</b> of {{hair at the}} sides and rear of the head remains. This has been {{referred}} to as a 'Hippocratic wreath', and rarely progresses to complete baldness. The Hamilton-Norwood scale has been developed to grade androgenic alopecia in males.|$|E
30|$|Alberton et al. [12] {{reported}} a 3.8 % dislocation rate after acetabular components revised with <b>an</b> elevated <b>rim</b> liner compared to 8.4 % of dislocations after acetabular components revised with <b>a</b> standard <b>rim.</b> Similar results were achieved by Kosashvili et al. [9] although {{were not statistically}} significant.|$|R

50|$|<b>A</b> green <b>rim</b> {{is present}} at every sunset {{but it is}} too thin to be seen with the naked eye. Often <b>a</b> green <b>rim</b> changes to <b>a</b> green flash and back again during the same sunset. The best time to observe <b>a</b> green <b>rim</b> is about 10 minutes before sunset. That is too early to use any {{magnification}} like binoculars or a telescope to look directly at the Sun without potential harm to the eyes. (Of course, a magnified image might be projected onto a sheet of paper for safe viewing.) As the sun gets closer to the horizon, the green rim becomes fainter due to atmospheric reddening. According to the above, it is probably correct to conclude that although <b>a</b> green <b>rim</b> is present during every sunset, a green flash is rarer because of the required mirage.|$|R
25|$|During the Interwar period these {{countries}} were {{sometimes referred to}} as limitrophe states between the two World Wars, from the French, indicating their collectively forming <b>a</b> <b>rim</b> along Bolshevik Russia's, later the Soviet Union's, western border. They were also part of what Clemenceau considered a strategic cordon sanitaire, the entire territory from Finland in the north to Romania in the south, standing between Western Europe and potential Bolshevik territorial ambitions.|$|E
25|$|Tian Jian Wu Zhu has {{an inner}} rim on obverse. At {{the start of}} the Liang Dynasty, money was only used around the capital. Elsewhere grain and cloth were used for trade. In the south, {{everyone}} used gold and silver. Therefore, in the 1st year of the Tian Jian period (502), the Emperor Wu cast Wu Zhu coins with an outer and inner rim. He also cast another sort without <b>a</b> <b>rim</b> called the female coin. The two sorts circulated together.|$|E
25|$|The Ronde, in {{its first}} decades, {{followed}} the general rule that each racer was responsible for his own problems. Help from others was banned and riders carried spare tyres looped round their shoulders to cope with punctures. It could take {{two or three minutes}} to change and inflate a tyre, longer if it was cold or there were other problems. Tyres weighed around 500g (compared to currently around 200g). <b>A</b> <b>rim</b> or any other part of the bike that broke spelled the end of the race and still left the rider with the problem of getting to the finish.|$|E
500|$|A lemon drop is {{typically}} prepared straight up, {{meaning that it}} is shaken or stirred with ice, strained, and served in a stemmed glass, such as a martini glass. The glass may be prepared with <b>a</b> sugared <b>rim,</b> performed by dipping {{the rim of the}} glass in water or lemon juice and then dipping it into <b>a</b> <b>rimmer</b> (<b>a</b> shallow tray used in bartending), filled with sugar. Superfine sugar (also called [...] "bar sugar", [...] "caster sugar", [...] "castor sugar" [...] and [...] "ultrafine sugar"), which is more finely ground compared to standard granulated sugar, is sometimes used for this purpose.|$|R

25|$|However, at finer scales {{than this}} the {{distribution}} of the valleys where present is highly patchy and discontinuous. Within the highlands, it is not unusual to find heavily dissected slopes immediately adjacent to almost entirely unmodified surfaces, both at valley and catchment scales. The valleys are also regionally clustered, with little dissection in Northwest Arabia and southwest and southeast of Hellas, but much in Terra Cimmeria and just south of the equator from 20°E to 180°E. They are also much more prominent on steeper slopes, for example on crater rims, but again may only be present on one side of such <b>a</b> <b>rim.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>rim</b> band brake, as {{implemented}} on the Yankee bicycle by Royce Husted in the 1990s, {{consists of}} a stainless-steel cable, wrapped in a kevlar sheath, that rides in a u-shaped channel {{on the side of}} the wheel rim. Squeezing the brake lever tightens the cable against the channel to produce braking friction. A return spring slackens the cable when the brake lever is released, no adjustment is required, and the brake becomes more forceful when wet. Husted said his inspiration was the band brake used on industrial machinery. The Yankee bicycle only included a rear brake, but that met U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission standards.|$|E
25|$|Instruments {{that have}} a five-string banjo neck on a wooden body (for example, a guitar, bouzouki, or dobro body) have also been made, such as the banjola. A 20th-Century Turkish {{instrument}} similar to the banjo is called the cümbüş—which has been made into eight different hybrid instruments, including guitar, mandolin, ukulele, and oud. At {{the end of the}} twentieth century, a development of the five-string banjo was the BanSitar. This features a bone bridge, giving the instrument a sitar-like resonance. A recent innovation is the patented Banjo-Tam, invented by Frank Abrams of Asheville North Carolina combining a traditional five string banjo neck with a tambourine as <b>a</b> <b>rim</b> or pot.|$|E
50|$|The rim of this crater {{is broken}} {{in the south}} and the {{interior}} is flooded with lava.

25|$|Amphorae, or amphoras, {{were used}} during Roman times to {{transport}} food on {{long and short}} distances. The content was generally liquid, olive oil or wine in most cases, but also , the popular fish sauce, and fruit sauce. As a container, an amphora {{was supposed to be}} strong, not too heavy, shaped in a way suitable for easy storage in the ship, and, at the same time, convenient for handling once arrived to its final destination. Usually, amphorae are two-handled terracotta containers with a globular/cylindrical body, <b>a</b> <b>rim</b> of various shapes, and a spiked or, less commonly, flat base. The spike was suited for a stable storage arrangement in the ship and it worked as a third handle in the process of emptying the container.|$|E
25|$|Rim brakes require regular maintenance. Brake pads {{wear down}} {{and have to be}} replaced. And before they wear out completely, their {{position}} may need to be adjusted as they wear. Because the motion of most brakes is not perfectly horizontal, the pads may lose their centering as they wear, causing the pads to wear unevenly. Over longer time and use, rims become worn. Rims should be checked for wear periodically as they can fail catastrophically if the braking surface becomes too worn. Wear is accelerated by wet and muddy conditions. Rim brakes require that the rims be straight (not out-of-round or warped). If <b>a</b> <b>rim</b> has a pronounced wobble, then the braking force may be intermittent or uneven, and the pads may rub the rims even when the brake is not applied.|$|E
25|$|Competition {{shooters}} {{also often}} sort bullets by weight, often down to 0.10 grain (6.5mg) increments. The bullet {{is placed in}} the case mouth by hand, and then seated with the press. At this point, the expanded case mouth is also sized back down. A crimp can optionally be added, either by the seating die or with a separate die. Taper crimps are used for cases that are held in the chamber by the case mouth, while roll crimps may be used for cases that headspace on <b>a</b> <b>rim</b> or on the cartridge neck. Roll crimps hold the bullet far more securely, and are preferred in situations, such as magnum revolvers, where recoil velocities are significant. A tight crimp also helps to delay the start of the bullet's motion, which can increase chamber pressures, and help develop full power from slower burning powders (see internal ballistics).|$|E
