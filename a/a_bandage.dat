5|$|At {{the start}} of the 2010–11 season, Tasci {{attracted}} interest from clubs around Europe. Stuttgart's league rival Hamburger SV as well as foreign clubs such as Tottenham Hotspur and Juventus reportedly expressed their desire to sign him. This move was denied by his agent; he said that Tasci would stay at Stuttgart only. On 15 July 2010, Tasci expressed his desire to stay at the club. After being excluded from the opening game of the season, he made his first appearance in a 3–2 loss against Borussia Dortmund. He scored his first goal for the club in the Europa League group stage matchday one in a 3–0 win over Young Boys. He then suffered a thigh problem that kept him out for a long time. In late November, Tasci returned to training with <b>a</b> <b>bandage</b> on his right knee. Once again, he was on the sideline after experiencing ongoing problems with his thigh injury despite reporting himself fit. He returned to the field on 19 December 2010 in the match against Bayern Munich, which Stuttgart lost 5–3. Despite his injury, Tasci would go on to make 26 league appearances. He continued to attract interest from Zenit Saint Petersburg, Tottenham, Málaga and Arsenal.|$|E
5|$|Manchester United's {{starting}} right-winger {{from the}} 2008 final, Owen Hargreaves, missed the match {{as he was}} still in rehabilitation after a double knee operation to cure his tendinitis problems that had seen him play little part in the 2008–09 Champions League campaign. It had been expected that defender Wes Brown would also miss the match after suffering a recurrence of a foot injury, but he returned to training quicker than expected and was involved in United's match against Hull City on 24 May, although he picked up a slight knock during the game. Rio Ferdinand was also a doubt following a calf injury that has kept him out of the United side since the semi-final second leg against Arsenal; Alex Ferguson had said that Ferdinand might not start in Rome if he was not fit to play against Hull, but he later admitted that Ferdinand was on course to recover in time to play in the match. Second-choice goalkeeper Ben Foster also missed the match after requiring surgery to repair a ruptured ligament in his right thumb in May 2009. On the other hand, following John O'Shea's winning goal in Manchester United's semi-final first leg victory over Arsenal, United manager Alex Ferguson suggested that the Irish utility player would be guaranteed a place in the starting line-up were United to reach the final. O'Shea's place in the team was confirmed at Manchester United's media day the week before the final. South Korean midfielder Park Ji-sung was also promised a place in the team after he missed the 2008 final, finally making him the first Asian to appear in a European Cup final. Cristiano Ronaldo suffered a slight injury scare in training the night before the final, requiring <b>a</b> <b>bandage</b> on his lower right leg, but he was eventually fit enough to play in the match.|$|E

25|$|Turner won the byelection, {{increasing}} the Conservative majority from 3,606 to 7,198. In his maiden speech, {{he spoke of}} the need for better supply of metals to the factories of his constituency. Later that year, Turner spoke on behalf of fellow former prisoners of war in support of a motion calling for compensation. He declared that he was lucky to survive, had never seen <b>a</b> <b>bandage</b> issued by the Japanese, and that prisoners had never received any Red Cross supplies.|$|E
25|$|Soft lenses {{are often}} used in the {{treatment}} and management of non-refractive disorders of the eye. <b>A</b> <b>bandage</b> contact lens protects an injured or diseased cornea from the constant rubbing of blinking eyelids thereby allowing it to heal. They {{are used in the}} treatment of conditions including bullous keratopathy, dry eyes, corneal abrasions and erosion, keratitis, corneal edema, descemetocele, corneal ectasis, Mooren's ulcer, anterior corneal dystrophy, and neurotrophic keratoconjunctivitis. Contact lenses that deliver drugs to the eye have also been developed.|$|E

25|$|To prevent {{spread of}} {{impetigo}} {{to other people}} the skin and any open wounds should be kept clean. Care {{should be taken to}} keep fluids from an infected person away from the skin of a non-infected person. Washing hands, linens, and affected areas will lower the likelihood of contact with infected fluids. Sores should be covered with <b>a</b> <b>bandage.</b> Scratching can spread the sores; keeping nails short will reduce the chances of spreading. Infected people should avoid contact with others and eliminate sharing of clothing or linens.|$|E
25|$|University {{students}} in Shanghai also {{took to the}} streets to commemorate the death of Hu Yaobang and protest against certain policies of the government. In many cases, these were supported by the universities' Party committees. Jiang Zemin, then-Municipal Party Secretary, addressed the student protesters in <b>a</b> <b>bandage</b> and 'expressed his understanding', as he was a former student agitator before 1949. At the same time, he moved swiftly to send in police forces to control the streets and to purge Communist Party leaders who had supported the students.|$|E
25|$|Patients {{are usually}} given {{a course of}} {{antibiotic}} and anti-inflammatory eye drops. These are continued in the weeks following surgery. Patients are told to rest and are given dark eyeglasses to protect their eyes from bright lights and occasionally protective goggles to prevent rubbing of the eyes when asleep and to reduce dry eyes. They also are required to moisturize the eyes with preservative-free tears and follow directions for prescription drops. Occasionally after the procedure <b>a</b> <b>bandage</b> contact lens is placed to aid the healing, and typically removed after 3–4 days. Patients should be adequately informed by their surgeons {{of the importance of}} proper post-operative care to minimize the risk of complications.|$|E

25|$|Dilawar kept wickets for India {{in three}} Test matches. On his debut, Dilawar {{was made to}} open the innings against England on a green wicket in Calcutta in 1933/34. He was hit on the head by Morris Nichols and retired. He {{returned}} with <b>a</b> <b>bandage</b> over his head, was hit on the thumb by Nobby Clark, but top scored with 59.

His last appearance came about in the 1936 Indian tour of England; Dilawar was in Cambridge at the time and joined the team in England.|$|E
25|$|Braies {{were usually}} {{fitted with a}} front flap that was buttoned or tied closed. This codpiece allowed men to urinate without having to remove the braies completely. Codpieces were also worn with hose when very short {{doublets}} – vest- (UK: waistcoat-) like garments tied together {{in the front and}} worn under other clothing – were in fashion, as early forms of hose were open at the crotch. Henry VIII of England began padding his codpiece, which caused a spiralling trend of larger and larger codpieces that only ended {{by the end of the}} 16th century. It has been speculated that the King may have had the sexually transmitted disease syphilis, and his large codpiece may have included <b>a</b> <b>bandage</b> soaked in medication to relieve its symptoms. Henry VIII also wanted a healthy son and may have thought that projecting himself in this way would portray fertility. Codpieces were sometimes used as a pocket for holding small items.|$|E
25|$|When the 1918 Spanish flu {{pandemic}} reached Toronto, Earhart {{was engaged in}} arduous nursing duties that included night shifts at the Spadina Military Hospital. She became a patient herself, suffering from pneumonia and maxillary sinusitis. She was hospitalized in early November 1918, owing to pneumonia, and discharged in December 1918, about {{two months after the}} illness had started. Her sinus-related symptoms were pain and pressure around one eye and copious mucus drainage via the nostrils and throat. While staying in the hospital during the pre-antibiotic era, she had painful minor operations to wash out the affected maxillary sinus, but these procedures were not successful and Earhart subsequently suffered from worsening headaches. Her convalescence lasted nearly a year, which she spent at her sister's home in Northampton, Massachusetts. She passed the time by reading poetry, learning to play the banjo and studying mechanics. Chronic sinusitis significantly affected Earhart's flying and activities in later life, and sometimes even on the airfield she was forced to wear <b>a</b> <b>bandage</b> on her cheek to cover a small drainage tube.|$|E

500|$|... "Drug Testing" [...] {{was written}} by Jennifer Celotta and {{directed}} by show runner and executive producer Greg Daniels. Fischer noted that the subplot featuring Jim unable to talk was important because [...] "Pam and Jim can say a lot to one another without any words at all", {{a reference to the}} [...] "27 seconds of silence" [...] the two shared in the earlier episode [...] "Booze Cruise". Michael has <b>a</b> <b>bandage</b> around his finger in this episode because Steve Carell hurt his finger during the week and was unable to remove his wedding ring due to the swelling.

500|$|According to Suetonius, {{a number}} of omens had foretold Domitian's death. Several days prior to the assassination, Minerva had {{appeared}} to the emperor in a dream.

[...] According to an auspice he had received, the Emperor believed that his death would be at midday. [...] As a result, he was always restless around that time. On the day of the assassination, Domitian was distressed and repeatedly asked a servant to tell him what time it was. The servant, who was himself one of the plotters, lied to the emperor, telling him that it was already late in the afternoon.

500|$|Long's {{theories}} about animal surgery garnered negative {{attention from the}} scientific {{community as well as}} the literary; biologist William Morton Wheeler wrote to Science in February 1904 that Long's story was [...] "a series of anecdotes which for rank and impossible humanization of the animal can hardly be surpassed." [...] Other scientists agreed about the dubiousness of Long's claims, and publicly rebuked him for not providing evidence as to his observations in a scientifically-accepted format. Long responded in turn, insisting that [...] "If scientists and comparative-psychologists are honestly looking for new facts in the animal world, I have enough to fill several regular editions of Science, every one of which is supported not only by my own personal observation, but by the testimony of other honest men whose word can be taken without hesitation." [...] As to the woodcock story, Long provided several accounts from other men who had witnessed as much; an Ohio man, for example, reportedly found upon shooting a similar bird that it [...] "had evidently broken its leg above the knee joint. There was <b>a</b> <b>bandage</b> around it, composed of a hard clay-like substance, interwoven with grass or a woody fiber of some kind. The bone seemed to have been set properly and had knit perfectly." [...] None of Long's witnesses were able to provide specimens for study, however, and Science followed Long's essay with the note, [...] "We Hope that this discussion will not be carried further." ...|$|E
