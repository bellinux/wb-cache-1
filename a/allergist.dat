40|$|Background: Patch testing (PT) is {{the gold}} {{standard}} test to detect allergic contact dermatitis. Despite its usefulness, it is not universally performed in allergy practices. Objectives: To determine obstacles in performing PT and to evaluate the differences in perception of these obstacles between community <b>allergists</b> and directors of training programs. Methods: Two anonymous Web-based questionnaires were distributed to 65 program directors (PDs) across the United States and to 200 community <b>allergists</b> in the mid-Atlantic region. Program directors and community <b>allergists</b> were categorized based on PT performance. Community <b>allergists</b> were categorized based on type of practice. Comparisons between categories were made using the ? 2 test. Results: Perceived obstacles among community <b>allergists</b> and PDs were similar; this remained unchanged regardless of performing PT. When community <b>allergists</b> in solo practice were compared with those in group private practice, the difference in perception was significant (P <. 01). Previous training in PT among PDs and community <b>allergists</b> {{was associated with a}} higher likelihood of performing PT. Conclusions: Previous training in PT among PDs and community <b>allergists</b> was associated with a higher likelihood of performing PT. We recommend that training in the application and interpretation of PT for diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis should {{be an integral part of}} the curriculum of allergy fellowship training programs and should also be incorporated into the continuing medical education program of practicing <b>allergists.</b> Furthermore, although <b>allergists</b> may continue to rely on dermatologists for more comprehensive PT, use of the thin-layer rapid use epicutaneous test is a simple screening tool that should be available to all allergy practices...|$|R

40|$|Ambrosia artemisiifolia (ragweed) is an {{invasive}} weed with pollen representing one of {{the most}} potent seasonal aeroallergenes. Romania is considered a ragweed infested country, based on field observations performed in different regions, pollen counts done in the West region and some clinical reports from <b>allergists</b> in the West and South parts. The aim {{of this paper is to}} evaluate the situation of allergies induced by Ambrosia artemisiifolia from the perspective of <b>allergists</b> practice in Romania and to draw some conclusions regarding consequences and possible measures to reduce this burden. The study was based on a questionnaire addressed to <b>allergists</b> attending the national annual allergology conference in 2013. The answers showed that part of the <b>allergists</b> are aware of the importance of allergies induced by Ambrosia pollen. We concluded that research projects in this field, application of eradication measures and public information are important for increase awareness of people about health impact of Ambrosia pollen in Romania...|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{describe}} {{atopic dermatitis}} (AD) management patterns in children ≤ 36 months old {{as reported by}} pediatricians, dermatologists, and <b>allergists</b> in the US. Study designA nationally-representative survey was administered to pediatricians (n = 101), dermatologists (n = 26), and <b>allergists</b> (n = 26). Main outcomes included referrals to health care professionals, suggested/ordered laboratory tests, management approach (dietary, pharmacologic, or combination of both) by age, AD location, and severity. ResultsSignificant differences were observed in referrals to healthcare professionals (P 80 % of physicians. ConclusionsSignificant and distinct differences in AD treatment approach exist among physicians surveyed. Most pediatricians and <b>allergists</b> use formula change as a management strategy in some patients, whereas dermatologists favor a pharmacologic approach. This diversity may result from inadequate evidence for a standard approach. Consistent methods for managing AD are needed...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the {{management}} of patients with a history of penicillin allergy between <b>allergists</b> and non-allergists in Thailand. A questionnaire was distributed to Thai physicians by online survey. The answers from 205 physicians were analyzed. The discrepancy of penicillin allergy management between <b>allergists</b> and non-allergists was clearly demonstrated in patients with a history of an immediate reaction in the presence of penicillin skin test (P< 0. 01) and in patients with a history of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (P< 0. 05) from penicillin. <b>Allergists</b> are more willing to confirm penicillin allergic status, more likely to carefully administer penicillin even after negative skin test, but less concerned for the potential cross-reactivity with 3 rd and 4 th generation cephalosporins, compared to non-allergists. The lack of penicillin skin test reagents, the reliability of penicillin allergy history, and medicolegal problem were the main reasons for prescribing alternate antibiotics without confirmation of penicillin allergic status. In summary, the different management of penicillin allergy between <b>allergists</b> and non-allergists was significantly demonstrated in patients with a history of severe non-immediate reaction and in patients with a history of an immediate reaction when a penicillin skin test is available...|$|R

40|$|Since 1990, {{food allergy}} has {{become synonymous with}} anaphylactic {{reactions}} associated with shellfish, milk and, especially, peanut allergy.

Food allergy is not new, but the seriousness with which it is treated is. For much of the twentieth century, however, food allergy was a perplexing, dubious and controversial concept that both divided and threatened <b>allergists.</b> I suggest this was due to: the theoretical, diagnostic and therapeutic challenges raised by food allergy; the claims made by food <b>allergists</b> about the scope and extent of their subject; and the threat food allergy and food <b>allergists</b> posed to the scientific legitimacy of allergy...|$|R
