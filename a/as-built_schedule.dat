40|$|The thesis {{presents}} the construction {{process of the}} pipeline R 25 D Šentrupert-Šoštanj with emphasis on project schedule analysis. The presented case is a challenging project and its execution depends upon several factors. The thesis also proposes possible solutions to mitigate the problems and delays. The first part is dedicated to systematical overview of all procedures, processes and documents required in construction of the structure under consideration. The overview reflects {{the current state of}} Slovenian construction legislation. The core of the thesis is presented in the second part, where the case study – pipeline construction is presented. The planned schedule is compared to <b>as-built</b> <b>schedule.</b> Contractual relations and supply chain are presented and discussed. The analysis shows that quality schedule plan is of key importance if successful completion of the project is desired. Further, the results show that during execution of works, a large number of factors causing delays are present. The factors can be attributed to various causes of both external and internal nature...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the {{preparation}} of a detailed time schedule and financial plan, as well as detailed cost analysis of planned and as-built construction works during execution of the building under consideration. The first part consists of 4 chapters that deal with theoretical background which is used in subsequent chapters where the cost analysis is performed. The introduction presents the fundamentals of project management. Further, phases and special features of a construction project are described. Project planning and relevant techniques for resource, time and cost planning are outlined. In {{the second part of}} the thesis, cost analysis of the project under investigation is presented. Causes for inadequate financial outcome at the project completion are explained. The analysis of data obtained from the existing documentation and comparison of the initial plan with the <b>as-built</b> <b>schedule</b> results in identification of discrepancies and related causes. The results show that the major reason for the cost increase was incomplete project documentation that forced the client to modify the original specifications during construction...|$|E
40|$|Risks are {{inherent}} in construction projects. If the project is to be completed successfully, risk management has {{to be included in}} project preparation, execution and follow-up in an appropriate way. The thesis presents a possible approach to project management and incorporation of risk management into the project by combined computer support of MS Project and MS Access. Capabilities of both programs were joined, and as a consequence, project follow-up was enabled by using the delay estimation method in a user friendly way. The parameters required for the project follow-up were acquired by the application of MS Access, and then transferred into the MS Access. A form for entering causes for discrepancies between the planned and <b>as-built</b> <b>schedule</b> into a database was prepared together with a pivot chart {{that can be used for}} immediate delay analysis. The presented way of the project follow-up can be used in the risk identification, enables the determination of project and activities delays and may lead to a fair final allocation of delay responsibilities...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} was conducted to (1) analyze earthmoving productivity, (2) develop detailed schedules for urban interchange reconstruction for the Iowa Department of Transportation (Iowa DOT), and (3) determine whether expediting urban interchange construction is a possible solution for shortening duration for the reconstruction of Interstate 235 (I- 235). The following projects were used as case studies in this research: (1) interchange reconstruction projects for the 14 th Street, 19 th Street, and 42 nd Street in Des Moines, and 35 th Street in West Des Moines. (2) bridge demolition projects for the 19 th Street, Martin Luther King Street, and 42 nd Street in Des Moines in the reconstruction of I- 235. The analysis results based on site observation and statistical analysis were described in these case studies. In earthmoving analysis, factors influencing earthmoving production rates, such as bucket capacity, number of passes, and hauling distance in urban interchange construction were significant. For the <b>scheduling</b> part, the <b>as-built</b> <b>schedules</b> for 35 th Street in West Des Moines and 42 nd Street in Des Moines were developed and compared with the contractor 2 ̆ 7 s original schedule. The actual urban interchange construction schedule resulted in a later completion date than originally estimated by the contractors. Even if earthwork, utility work, and paving processes were expedited based on the <b>as-built</b> <b>schedules,</b> the activities could be expedited aggressively to reduce the construction duration more. Expedited urban interchange construction is an alternative method to reduce total duration of the I- 235 corridor work. Moreover, duration, costs, resources, and sequences for urban bridge demolition were influenced by traffic control and bridge type...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the development of}} the Virtual Construction Simulator (VCS) 3 - a simulation game-based educational tool for teaching construction schedule planning and management. The VCS 3 simulation game engages students in learning the concepts of planning and managing construction schedules through goal driven exploration, employed strategies, and immediate feedback. Through the planning and simulation mode, students learn the difference between the as-planned and <b>as-built</b> <b>schedules</b> resulting from varying factors such as resource availability, weather and labor productivity. This paper focuses on {{the development of the}} VCS 3 and its construction physics model. Challenges inherent in the process of identifying variables and their relationships to reliably represent and simulate the dynamic nature of planning and managing of construction projects are also addressed. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Project {{managers}} today rely on scheduling tools {{based on}} the Critical Path Method (CPM) to determine the overall project duration and the activities’ float times. Such data provide important information about the degree of flexibility {{with respect to the}} project schedule as well as the critical and noncritical activities, which leads to greater efficiency in planning and control of projects. While CPM has been useful for scheduling construction projects, years of practice and research have highlighted a number of serious drawbacks that limit its use as a decision support tool. The traditional representation of CPM lacks the ability to clearly record and represent detailed as-built information such as slow/fast progress and complete representation of work interruptions caused by the various parties involved. In addition, CPM is based on two unrealistic assumptions: that the project deadline is not restricted and that resources are unlimited. With CPM, therefore, the most cost-effective corrective actions needed in order to recover delays and overruns cannot be determined. This research is {{based on the}} view that many of the drawbacks of CPM stem from the rough level of detail at which progress data is represented and analyzed, where activities’ durations are considered as continuous blocks of time. To overcome CPM drawbacks, this research presents a new Critical Path Segments (CPS) mechanism, with its mathematical formulation, that offers a finer level of granularity by decomposing the duration of each activity into separate time segments. The CPS mechanism addresses the problems with CPM in three innovative ways: (1) the duration of an activity is represented as a series of separate time segments; (2) the representation of the progress of an activity is enhanced; and (3) an optimization mechanism to incorporate project constraints into the CPS analysis. To demonstrate the ability of the CPS to provide better analysis than the traditional CPM, a number of case studies are used to show its ability to (1) simplify network relationships and accurately calculate floats and critical path(s); (2) achieve better resource allocation and facilitate accurate delay analysis; and (3) overcome problems {{associated with the use of}} multiple resource calendars. This research represents a change from well-known CPM techniques and has the potential to revolutionize and simplify the analysis of ongoing and <b>as-built</b> <b>schedules.</b> The developed CPS technique is expected to help project managers achieve a better level of control over projects and their corrective actions because it offers better visualization, optimization, and decision support for meeting project goals within the specified constraints...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{presents}} the construction process {{on a case}} of road crossover over the railway, where special attention is placed to specific requirements that appear when different infrastructure systems intersect, and {{to the analysis of}} deficiencies that were identified during final check of the structure. The first part describes the general features of the the construction process. Construction phases, roles and responsibilities of various participants, and extensive documentation required for the project execution from the initial feasibility study to the final delivery to the client are presented. The key legal documents that regulate all construction phases (from the conceptual phase to commissioning) are discussed. The second part of the thesis {{presents the}} case study, the application of guidelines specified {{in the first part of}} the thesis that relate to the specific requirements (intersection of two different infrastructure systems), construction details and the comparison of the planned and <b>as-built</b> <b>schedule.</b> The last part of the thesis presents the results of the analysis of the deficiencies that were identified during the final check. The analysis shows that the main factor causing the deficiencies is lack of communication between participants during the construction of the road crossover over the railway...|$|E
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{recognized}} that construction industry is information intensive and complex industry. However, present trend and proliferations towards multi-participant mega projects have heightened {{the need for}} an effective and efficient evaluation and monitoring by stakeholders. A persistent problem in construction has been in documenting changes, which occur in the field, and preparing the <b>as-built</b> <b>schedule.</b> Combining computer vision technology with 3 D CAD to produce as-built drawing offers a potential solution. However a recent investigation indicated that {{there is a lack of}} systematic and automated evaluation and monitoring in construction projects. The aim of this research is to identify techniques which are used in the construction industry for monitoring and evaluating the actual physical progress and to establish how the current computer technology can be used for monitoring the construction physical progress on site. 3 D CAD is increasingly being used as a design tool for construction projects and digital images can be used to provide accurate information needed to document as-built construction schedule. The DCM provides a bridge for storing structural design information in an integrated construction relational database management system that can be shared by a range of computer applications. The DCM model is a part of developing the Tele-Construction base site management system, which retrieves the status of construction work in progress and develop the actual progress bar chart. A pilot study of Car Parking for Larkin Mosque is conducted to check the validity of DCM. The application of DCM model in monitoring the progress enables project management teams to better track and controls the productivity and provides better mechanism for management of projec...|$|E
40|$|A {{considerable}} amount of digital data is being collected by State Highway Agencies (SHAs) to aid project-planning activities, support various project level decision-making processes, and effectively maintain and operate constructed highway assets. However, the highway construction industry has been significantly lagging behind utilizing the growing digital data to support business decisions compared to other industry sectors {{such as health care}} and energy. The significant lack of understanding on the linkage between raw data collected and various decisions, proper computational methodologies, and effective guidance is considered as major barriers to the full utilization of the digital data. This study uses digital datasets that are now commonly available in SHAs, to demonstrate the smart utilization of existing digital data to support and enhance decision-making processes using data analytics and visualization methods. This study will a) develop an advanced computational methodology to generate multidimensional highway construction cost indexes (HCCIs) using two new concepts of i) dynamic item basket and ii) multidimensional HCCI, b) develop an enhanced framework for collection and utilization of digital Daily work Report (DWR) data, c) develop an automated methodology to generate as-built schedules using data collected from existing DWR systems, and d) analyze as-built schedules to develop a knowledge base of frequent precedence relationships of activities. The study achieves those objectives by utilizing three digital datasets: bid data, DWR data, and project characteristics data. Further, two standalone prototype systems, namely, Dyna-Mu-HCCI and ABSS are developed to automate computational methodologies for multidimensional HCCI calculation and <b>as-built</b> <b>schedule</b> development respectively. This study will aid SHAs to utilize currently unused datasets for informed budgeting and project control decisions. It demonstrates the importance of data analytics and visualization to obtain more value from the investment made in collecting construction data. Overall, this study serves as a step in making a transition from experience driven to data driven decision making in the construction industry...|$|E
40|$|A {{persistent}} {{problem in}} construction is to document changes which {{occur in the}} field and to prepare the <b>as-built</b> <b>schedule.</b> In current practice, deviations from planned performance can only be reported after significant time has elapsed and manual monitoring of the construction activities are costly and error prone. Availability of advanced portable computing, multimedia and wireless communication allows, even encourages fundamental changes in many jobsite processes. However a recent investigation indicated that {{there is a lack of}} systematic and automated evaluation and monitoring in construction projects. The aim of this study is to identifytechniques that can be used in the construction industry for monitoring and evaluating the physical progress, and also to establish how current computer technology can be utilised for monitoring the actual physical progress at the construction site. This study discusses the results of questionnaire survey conducted within Malaysian Construction Industry and suggests a prototype system, namely Digitalising Construction Monitoring (DCM). DCM prototype system integrates the information from construction drawings, digital images of construction site progress and planned schedule of work. Using emerging technologies and information system the DCM re-engineer the traditional practice for monitoring the project progress. This system can automatically interpret CAD drawings of buildings and extract data on its structural components and store in database. It can also extract the engineering information from digital images and when these two databases are simulated the percentage of progress can be calculated and viewed in Microsoft Project automatically. The application of DCM system for monitoring the project progress enables project management teams to better track and controls the productivity and quality of construction projects. The use of the DCM can help resident engineer, construction manager and site engineer in monitoring and evaluating project performance. This model will improve decision-making process and provides better mechanism for advanced project management...|$|E
40|$|The {{documentation}} of complete and timely as-built {{information related to}} construction projects is essential for tracking progress, planning corrective action, and analyzing the schedule. The collection of site information, however, is currently a challenging, time-consuming, and error-prone manual process. To improve the tracking of as-built information, this research focused {{on the development of}} a low-cost voice-visual framework that utilizes commonly available communication tools such as email and interactive voice response (IVR). The goal of this research was to create project-wide bidirectional communication between site personnel and head office to automate the tracking of daily site information. The research involved an in-depth analysis of the possible site events and progress-tracking needs related to construction activities. Accordingly, activity-specific email forms and logical-flow diagrams were developed as a means of facilitating site data collection. A framework was then developed that integrates several components: the developed tracking forms; a cloud-based IVR service; a customized scheduling application; and an email application. During construction, the automated system identifies eligible activities to be tracked; collects as-built details from the relevant supervisors; and uses the daily time segments of the schedule as an integrated depository for all as-built details, including progress information, events by all parties, and requests for information (RFIs), quality/safety issues, and other video/audio/drawing-markup notes. The developed system generates detailed <b>as-built</b> <b>schedule</b> that clearly show the evolution of all as-built events and their accurate timing on the daily segments for each activity. The project schedule is thus converted from a static report into information-rich, visualization media, and decision-support tool that provides decision makers with timely progress details so that they can easily follow the project progress, facilitates schedule updates, facilitates accurate schedule forensics, delay analysis,, and the planning of appropriate corrective action. The developed framework was validated though a number of case studies that demonstrated its usefulness and practicality. This research contributes to construction efficiency through the facilitation of bidirectional communication between site personnel and head office and the provision of timely and legible as-built data for decision-making. Ultimately, the research will assist construction firms to have better control over construction projects and more effective decisions during construction through improved communication...|$|E
