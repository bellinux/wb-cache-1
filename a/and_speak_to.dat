25|$|God's {{word came}} to Jeremiah {{a second time}} to ask what he saw, he replied that he saw a seething pot tipping from the north, and God said {{that out of the}} north evil would break forth upon all Israel. For God would call all the kingdoms of the north to come, and they would set their thrones at Jerusalem's gate, against its walls, and against the cities of Judah. God would utter God's {{judgments}} against Judah, as its people had forsaken God and worshipped the work of their own hands. God thus directed Jeremiah to gird his loins, arise, <b>and</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> the Judean people all that God commanded, for God had made Jeremiah a fortified city, an iron pillar, and brazen walls against the land of Judah, its rulers, its priests, and its people.

25|$|Harold is aghast, worried if {{the foreign}} police will believe the story {{both he and}} Elsie have to tell and that their 'relationship' is innocent.

Harold agrees {{to give it a}} try and wires for money but aside from that, and unable to speak the local language, leaves Mrs Rice to carry out the negotiations. All seems to go well and the next day Harold sees Mrs Rice speaking with a police officer and she tells him that the death has been declared as being from natural causes and that they are all in the clear. That is until the two Polish women approach Mrs Rice <b>and</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> her. She translates for Harold and tells him that they know what really happened (their room being next to Elsie's) and that they are blackmailing the English people.|$|E
500|$|Deal got {{the idea}} for the album's name from a {{painting}} that she saw in Boston. Pods cover was designed by Vaughan Oliver with photography by Kevin Westenberg. Oliver attached a belt of dead eels over his underwear, and performed a fertility dance while Westenberg took pictures of him, using a long exposure. Oliver's inspiration included the need for [...] "a strong male response" [...] (via the [...] "phallic" [...] eels) to the music of the mostly female Breeders. Another motivation was his attempt to charm Kim Deal, <b>and</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> her sense of humor, as he had become enamored with her.|$|E

[...] However, having just killed his leading male character, Billy Bigelow, onstage in Carousel, he was {{reluctant}} to kill off another. [...] In the end, he took his protagonist from birth to age35. [...] He envisioned a simply staged work like Our Town which after its initial run would lend itself to college productions. [...] Allegro was conceived as taking place in an open space, using props and projections to convey scenery to the audience. [...] In addition to the usual singing chorus, there would be a speaking chorus, {{in the manner of a}} Greek chorus, which would comment on the action, <b>and</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> both characters and audience.|$|E
500|$|Evans {{published}} {{instructions for}} local Klan leaders that detailed {{how to run}} meetings, recruit new members, <b>and</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> local gatherings. He advised leaders to avoid [...] "raving hysterically" [...] in favor of [...] " [...] scientific ... presentation of facts". In addition, he urged them to forbid members from bringing their Klan regalia home from meetings and to perform background checks on applicants. He instructed Klan members to shun vigilantism but to assist police and attempted, with some success, to recruit police officers into the Klan. Emphasizing the difference between his organization and the more violent 19th-century Ku Klux Klan, Evans formed Klan-themed groups for children. As the Klan attempted to portray itself as a movement led by cultured, well-educated people, its leaders spoke about education in the U.S. Evans believed that public schools could create a homogeneous society and saw education advocacy as an effective form of public relations.|$|E

Korda—with Churchill's support and involvement—directed That Hamilton Woman, with Olivier as Horatio Nelson and Leigh in the title role. Korda saw that the relationship between the couple was strained. Olivier was tiring of Leigh's suffocating adulation, and she was drinking to excess. The film, in which the threat of Napoleon paralleled that of Hitler, was seen by critics as [...] "bad history but good British propaganda", according to the BFI.|$|E
