25|$|The Foxes were {{replaced}} in January 1931 with the Hawker Hart, after which much work {{was put into}} formation flying in cloud, instrument flying, pattern bombing and <b>aircraft</b> <b>icing</b> trials. The purpose of these trials was to enable Royal Air Force aircraft to bomb an enemy ship successfully, regardless of weather. To this end, 12 Squadron dropped several practice bombs on an obsolete battleship, HMS Centurion, which was a radio-controlled target off the south coast. On 6 July 1935, King George V performed the first Royal Review of the Royal Air Force, in which 12(B) Squadron led the Light Bomber Wing flypast at RAF Mildenhall. Several home-based squadrons, including 12 Squadron, were re-deployed in October 1935, to the Middle East and Aden in preparation for action being taken by the League of Nations against Italy for invading Abyssinia. 12 Squadron returned to RAF Andover in August 1936, and on its return took delivery of the Hawker Hind. It was around this time {{that the majority of}} B Flight were taken to form the nucleus of the newly formed No. 63 Squadron RAF. In February 1938, the Squadron was re-equipped with Fairey Battles, the squadron leaving RAF Andover in May 1939.|$|E

An investigation found the <b>aircraft's</b> <b>ice</b> protection system was ineffective because the engine bleed air valves were closed during the flight; ice therefore built up on the aircraft causing it {{to go out of}} control.|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} using {{microwave}} energy to provide <b>aircraft</b> <b>ice</b> protection, specifically an anti-icing system, and {{the feasibility of}} such a system are discussed. In a microwave anti-icing system impinging supercooled water droplets are heated to above freezing by the resonant absorption of microwave energy located upstream of the aircraft. This process is inherently more efficient than existing anti-icing devices due to the saving of the {{latent heat of fusion}} (a substantial 334 joules/gm (80 cal/gm)) and the fact that only the droplets are heated, thereby reducing convective losses to the air...|$|R
50|$|These {{three types}} occur also when ice forms {{on the surface}} of an {{aircraft}} when it flies through a cloud made of supercooled water liquid droplets.

50|$|<b>Aircraft</b> <b>icing</b> {{accidents}} {{result from}} a combination of increased weight, increased drag, decrease or loss of lift, and decrease or loss of thrust from ice accumulation on the airframe, airfoil(s), propellers (if present) and or wings, {{depending on the type of}} ice that forms (e.g. rime ice, clear ice, etc.), which is a function of the specific meteorological conditions. Also, induction ice can cause power losses in icing conditions either externally at air intakes (either turbine or piston aircraft), or locally in the induction system within the engine (e.g. the carburetor of a non-fuel injected reciprocating engine).|$|E

50|$|The {{accident}} was {{investigated by the}} National Transportation Safety Board. Investigators determined that the airplane was flying well above the glideslope for an ILS approach. From the plane's last recorded position, investigators determined that Flight 2415 would need to follow a 7 degree glidepath in order to descend rapidly enough to reach the runway threshold. This {{is more than twice}} the glidepath angle for an ILS approach and would have required a high descent rate of 2,000 to 3,000 feet per minute. Investigators also determined that ice had likely built up on the plane's wings during the flight, creating a higher risk of a stall at low speeds. According to radar data, Flight 2415 had slowed to 110 knots as it attempted to descend. The combination of an excessively steep descent, low speed, and <b>aircraft</b> <b>icing</b> likely resulted in loss of control of the aircraft.|$|E

However, all the supplies of fuel, bombs and spare parts {{needed to support}} operations from the forward bases in China had to be flown in from India over [...] "The Hump" [...] (the name given by Allied pilots to {{the eastern end of}} the Himalayan Mountains), since Japanese control of eastern China and the Chinese coast made seaborne supply of China impossible. Also, the forward bases were located in Szechaun Province in south central China far from the coast, with no roads or railroads into the area from Allied-controlled territory. Supplies had to be delivered to China by the B-29s themselves or by the C-47s and C-46s of Air Transport Command. For this role, one aircraft from each squadron was stripped of combat equipment and used as a flying tanker.

5000|$|In 1943, {{the focus}} of Schaefer's and Langmuir's {{research}} shifted to precipitation static, <b>aircraft</b> <b>icing,</b> ice nuclei, and cloud physics, {{and many of their}} experiments were carried out at Mount Washington Observatory in New Hampshire. In the summer of 1946 Schaefer found his experimental [...] "cold box" [...] too warm for some laboratory tests he wanted to perform. Determined to get on with his work, he located some [...] "dry ice" [...] (solid CO2) and placed it {{into the bottom of the}} [...] "cold box." [...] Creating a cloud with his breath he observed a sudden and heretofore unseen bluish haze that suddenly turned into millions of microscopic ice crystals that dazzled him in the strobe lit chamber. He had stumbled onto the very principle that was hidden in all previous experiments—the stimulating effect of a sudden change in heat/cold, humidity, in supercooled water spontaneously producing billions of ice nuclei. Through scores of repeated experiments he quickly developed a method to [...] "seed" [...] supercooled clouds with dry ice. In November 1946 he conducted a successful field test seeding a natural cloud by airplane—with dramatic ice and snow effect. The resulting publicity brought an abundance of new correspondence, this time from people and businesses making requests for snow and water as well as scientists around the world also working on weather modification to change local weather conditions for the better. Schaefer's discovery also led to debates over the appropriateness of tampering with nature through cloud seeding. In addition, the successful field test enabled Langmuir to obtain federal funding to support additional research in cloud seeding and weather modification by the GE Research Laboratory. Schaefer was coordinator of the laboratory portion of Project Cirrus while the Air Force and Navy supplied the aircraft and pilots to carry out field tests and to collect the data used at the Research Laboratory. Field tests were conducted in the Schenectady area as well as in Puerto Rico and New Mexico.|$|E

50|$|A typical annual {{training}} programme for 12 Squadron consisted of individual {{training in the}} autumn, working up to Squadron training in the summer consisting of bombing, formation flying, navigation exercises and gunnery.

This involved a number of practice jumps being performed by observers, who would {{climb out of the}} aircraft onto a small ladder and await a signal from the pilot as the aircraft flew over the airfield at 2000 ft. The observers carried no reserve parachutes, and the silk material from which the parachutes were constructed had a tendency to build up a static charge whilst in storage, such that when the ripcord was pulled, the silk stuck together. 12 Squadron was also tasked with further trials work, experimenting with oxygen systems, high altitude photography, and low temperature trials work, particularly in respect to lubricants.
