50|$|The Arecont Vision MegaDome® {{series of}} IP cameras include a 1.3 MP to 5 MP camera, lens and IP66 dome housing. The MegaDome®2 Series {{comprises}} H.264 cameras, lenses and housings, with remote focus, zoom and <b>auto-iris</b> and relatively high frame rates.|$|E
50|$|Although the Nikon F-mount back-focus at 46.5mm is {{well above}} the 44mm of the SD14, there is no adapter for the {{infinity}} focusing possible as, unlike with Canon EOS, the Nikon bayonet of roughly the same diameter will not fit inside the SA-PK bayonet. The M42 thread does, as {{taken care of by}} Asahi when introducing K mount in the 1970s, and therefore all M42 lenses work as is without problems with the SA/M42 converter. Lenses with equal or shorter back-focus (pre-EOS Canon, Minolta, Konica, Miranda) can only be adapted by discarding the old bayonet, milling off extra metal from the lens barrel and adding an SA = PK bayonet flange. Due to the good quality viewfinder (for a crop-DSLR) of the SD14 the missing <b>auto-iris</b> is not a problem, and primes from 45mm up focus comfortably on the screen down to f/5.6. The camera meters automatically via the AV setting with anything mounted on it or being mounted on, such a microscope or a telescope. For this, the camera should be set to a virtual aperture of 1.0. The SD14's solid construction and decent size make it a desirable platform for laboratory and technical photography.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} <b>auto-iris</b> compensation. <b>Auto-iris</b> can {{be really}} troublesome for motion detection and tracking techniques based on background or frame differencing,since it can change quickly the average intensity of thecurrent frame. To cope with this, we introduced a two-step autoiris compensation approach in our traffic monitoring system. First, the <b>auto-iris</b> detection {{is based on the}} computation of the average of the luminance difference obtained by background suppression. Then, if an <b>auto-iris</b> is detected, the compensation phase is started. In this phase, the auto-iris’ behaviour is empirically modelled and, thus, compensated. Experimental results demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed approach, with both quantitative measures and visual analysis...|$|E
40|$|Coding a projector’s {{aperture}} plane with adaptive patterns together with inverse filtering allow the depth-of-field of projected imagery to be increased. We present two prototypes and corresponding algorithms for static and programmable apertures. We also explain how these patterns can be computed at interactive rates, by {{taking into account}} the image content and limitations of the human visual system. Applications such as projector defocus compensation, high quality projector de-pixelation, and increased temporal contrast of projected video sequences can be supported. Coded apertures are a step towards next-generation <b>auto-iris</b> projector lenses...|$|E
40|$|The MMT all-sky {{camera is}} a low-cost, {{wide-angle}} camera system that takes {{images of the}} sky every 10 seconds, day and night. It {{is based on an}} Adirondack Video Astronomy StellaCam II video camera and utilizes an <b>auto-iris</b> fish-eye lens to allow safe operation under all lighting conditions, even direct sunlight. This combined with the anti-blooming characteristics of the StellaCam’s detector allows useful images to be obtained during sunny days as well as brightly moonlit nights. Under dark skies the system can detect stars as faint as 6 th magnitude as well as very thin cirrus and low surface brightness zodiacal features such as gegenschein. The total hardware cost of the system was less than $ 3500 including computer and framegrabber card, {{a fraction of the cost}} of comparable systems utilizing traditional CCD cameras...|$|E
40|$|Consider {{a static}} scene and fixed center of projection, about which a camera {{is free to}} zoom, pan, tilt, and rotate about its optical axis. With an ideal camera, the {{resulting}} images {{are in the same}} orbit of the projective group-action, and each pixel of each image provides a measurement of a ray of light passing through a common point in space. Unfortunately, most modern cameras have a built in automatic gain control (AGC), automatic shutter, or <b>auto-iris,</b> which, in many cases cannot be turned off. Many modern digitizers to which cameras are connected have their own AGC which also cannot be disabled. With AGC, the characteristic response function of the camera varies, making it impossible to accurately describe one image as a projective coordinate transformed version of another. This paper proposes not only a solution to this problem, but a means of turning AGC into an asset, so that even in cases where AGC could be disabled, pencigraphers of the future will be turning AGC on. 1 INTR [...] ...|$|E
