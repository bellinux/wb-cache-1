500|$|Mike Joseph, {{in review}} of Thriller 25 for PopMatters, {{described}} the track {{listing of the}} reissue as [...] "pleasant" [...] but West's [...] "lazy" [...] remix was the only exception. He added, [...] "You've been {{given the opportunity to}} remix the most iconic single from one of the most iconic albums of all time, and <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> stick a drum machine on top of the song's original arrangement?". Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone disliked the removal of the original bassline, and compared it to [...] "putting Bobby Orr on the ice without a hockey stick". IGN's Todd Gilchrist praised West's remix and stated that it was a [...] "pretty great track". He added, [...] "it almost overplays the track's originally understated drama, his additions enhance the song and demonstrate that in a contemporary context." ...|$|E
500|$|The National Wildlife Federation {{described}} her as [...] "a passionate, articulate, and tireless {{voice for the}} environment". Chairman of the Florida Audubon Society Ed Davison remembered her, saying, [...] "She kept a clear vision of the way things ought to be, and she didn't {{give a lot of}} credibility to excuses about why they're not like that. She would give these wonderful, curmudgeonly speeches to which there was no response. You can't holler back to grandmotherly scolding. <b>All</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> shuffle your feet and say, 'Yes, Ma'am.'" [...] She was aware of it; she was reported saying, [...] "People can't be rude to me, this poor little old woman. But I can be rude to them, poor darlings, and nobody can stop me." [...] Her ashes were scattered over the [...] of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Wilderness Area in Everglades National Park.|$|E
500|$|Follow the Leader {{received}} generally positive reviews. Stephan Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic {{gave the}} album {{four out of}} five stars, saying that it [...] "is an effective follow-up to their first two alt-metal landmarks." [...] Erlewine also said that the songs were [...] "vehicles for the metal grind". Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B–. Reviewer Jim Farber said that the lyrics [...] "provide a new blend of metal and remnants of alt-rock." [...] Jon Pareles from The New York Times said the album was [...] "choppy", and also said that lead singer Jonathan Davis was [...] "wrestling with self-hatred, violent impulses, parental execration, and a confused sexual identity..." [...] Robert Christgau of The Village Voice said that, although Korn [...] "deny they're metal", they [...] "nevertheless demonstrate that the essence of metal ... is self-obliterating volume and self-aggrandizing display." [...] Rolling Stone gave the album {{four out of five}} stars, while saying that Korn [...] "have an ideal record for those long, black days when <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> say 'What the Fuck! What the Fuck! What the Fuck!' at bloody murder volume". The album is featured in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.|$|E

5000|$|On May 21, 2014, {{during one}} of his Watsky Wednesday vlogs, he {{announced}} that the title of his new album would be <b>All</b> <b>You</b> <b>Can</b> <b>Do,</b> as well as explaining that he wanted to keep his family ties in the album (announcing that his father would be on the cover and that he would like his mother to be on an alternate cover) and that the album would be released in August. [...] He had tweeted earlier in the month that the first single from <b>All</b> <b>You</b> <b>Can</b> <b>Do</b> would be released on June 10, 2014.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said reassuringly, [...] "no one {{can tell}} exactly how a game of this kind will go. <b>All</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> to hold tight and keep your eyes open." ...|$|E
6000|$|HAROLD. I can't stand your sort, John. When a {{thing like}} this happens, <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> to cry out: Why didn't he--? Why didn't she--? What's to be done--that's the point! ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Don’t you trouble about me," [...] said Fraser; [...] "you’ve got <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> to {{look after}} yourself. I’ve come out {{to look for a}} policeman; at least, that’s what I told them." ...|$|R
60|$|You would {{cultivate}} a taste at the impressionable age?--Especially {{in the education}} of children, that being just the first question, I suppose, which lies at the root of <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> for the workman.|$|R
6000|$|... "'It is,' says I heartily, 'and let's have a {{diagnosis}} of the case right away, for in two weeks' time <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> to hold an autopsy and I don't want to be amputated if I can help it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Poor lad!' {{she said}} kindly. 'I'll tell you what, Harold, <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> put him into your bed at once.--Here, Ellen, you run up first, and {{bring me a}} shirt to warm for him. Then we'll get his own clothes dried.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No! But we don't {{throw the}} helve after the hatchet, my lad! <b>All</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> {{to take this}} epistle to the French Consul, who might {{find it hard to}} {{understand}} without your explanations. At any rate, my orders are to bring you safe on board again.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you mean}} business, your {{work will be}} the same as hers," [...] he said; [...] "you're not qualified. <b>All</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> will be visiting, noting the state of the houses and the {{condition}} of the children." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, thank <b>you.</b> You'll have <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> to {{keep from}} freezing." [...] She studied his thin coat and worn gloves with keen glance. He could see only her pink cheeks, strong nose, and dark, smiling eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Toc, Toc!" [...] cried Adams, with a remonstrative look, such as martyrs {{are said}} to give when their heads are not {{properly}} cut off; [...] "is that <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> with your big strong arms? Fie, man, fie!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, that's true," [...] {{replied the}} Ork musingly. [...] "Your bodies are built very poorly, {{it seems to}} me, since <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> crawl upon the earth's surface. But you may ride upon my back, {{and in that way}} I can promise you a safe journey to the tunnel." ...|$|E
6000|$|Without {{putting our}} {{conviction}} into words, we all {{realized that my}} aunt's departure was but {{a matter of a}} few days. [...] "There is nothing to do," [...] the doctor said. [...] "She will go like a person falling asleep. <b>All</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> wait--" [...] And so the days passed.|$|E
60|$|In {{football}} you are vouchsafed fewer chances. Practically <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> {{to shout}} 'off-side' whenever an opponent scores, which affords but meagre employment {{for a really}} critical mind. In cricket, however, nothing can escape you. Everything must be done in full sight of everybody. There the players stand, without refuge, simply inviting criticism.|$|E
50|$|On May 30, 2015, Watsky {{announced}} {{through social}} media {{that he would}} be releasing <b>All</b> <b>You</b> <b>Can</b> Do: Live From The Regency Ballroom, the live album that he recorded during the <b>All</b> <b>You</b> <b>Can</b> <b>Do</b> tour, on June 2 on BitTorrent, Bandcamp, Spotify, iTunes & Soundcloud. He also announced {{that he would be}} embarking on a monthlong club tour, called the Meaner Than The Average tour, with Créme Fraîche, A-1, and Mikos Da Gawd in late July and August. The focus of the tour would be to hit cities that he didn't get to on the <b>All</b> <b>You</b> <b>Can</b> <b>Do</b> tour. He also said that many of the shows would be in various Canadian cities that he's never performed in.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, John, {{you are too}} old, and <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> now is to {{sit here}} and--and take care of me. <b>You</b> knew <b>all</b> about it quite clearly this morning. We stood {{together}} upstairs by the window listening to the aircraft guns.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Bugger {{all means}} [...] "nothing" [...] as in You {{may not like}} paying taxes, but there's bugger <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> about it. and The police are doing bugger all about all this aggro that's going on See also fuck all, sweet FA, and Llareggub.|$|R
6000|$|... "Be-cause no {{one else}} thinks as you do. Your wheels make you help-less to in-jure an-y one. For you have no fists and can not scratch or e-ven pull hair. Nor have you an-y feet to kick with. <b>All</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> to yell and shout, {{and that does not}} hurt an-y one at all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then, my dear, I think <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> to pray {{not only}} for {{protection}} from lightning and tempest, but {{that you may be}} guarded from the fright that makes you forget to watch yourself, and so renders the danger greater! You could not well have been drowned where you fell; but {{if it had been a}} river--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Sure it's a swell game. You cow-headed gents think beef an' brawn {{ought to}} hev the call over skill an' gray matter. You'll all hev {{to back up}} an' get down. Go out an' learn the game. You don't know a baffy from a Chinee sandwich. <b>All</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> waggle with a club an' fozzle the ball.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And is that <b>all</b> <b>YOU</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> for me? I {{expected}} {{more from}} you, Mrs. Osmond," [...] said {{the young man}} in a tone of fine general reference. [...] "You know our acquaintance goes back very far--quite into the days of our innocent childhood." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{hard to tell}} you, my dear. You have to feel {{first that}} you have a Saviour,--that you've given your whole heart to him,--that he <b>can</b> save <b>you,</b> and that no one else can,--that <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> {{yourself}} won't help you. It's an experience." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You jabber and jaw and burble, and that's about <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do.</b> What's {{the good}} of it? King's house'll only gloat because they've drawn you, and King will gloat, too. Besides, that {{resolution}} of Orrin's is chock-full of bad grammar, and King'll gloat over that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know what}} it is," [...] she accused him, [...] "you've been {{listening}} to the doctors. Never should. What do they know? Nothing at all--or just enough to make them dangerous. I ought to know--my own father was a doctor. That little Wilkins is about the greatest fool that even I have ever seen. Heart seizure! Sort of thing he would say. Anyone with any sense could see at once that her husband had poisoned her. I always said he'd murder her in her bed, poor soul. Now he's done it. And <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> to murmur silly things about 'heart seizure' and 'inquest on Friday.' You ought to be ashamed of yourself, John Cavendish." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come," [...] {{she said}} brusquely; [...] "now you're in for it you must {{play the game}} out. He trusts you; if he sees you can't trust yourself, he'll shoot you on sight. That don't frighten you? Well, perhaps this will then! He'll SAY your {{religion}} is a sham and you a hypocrite--and everybody will believe him. How do you like that, Brother Wayne? How will that help the Church? Come! You're a pair of cranks together; but he's got the whip-hand of you this time. <b>All</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> to keep up to his idea of you. Put a bold face on it, and come here {{as often as you}} can--the oftener the better; the sooner you'll both get sick of each other--and of ME. That's what you're both after, ain't it? Well! I can tell you now, you needn't either of you be the least afraid of me." ...|$|E
60|$|In forgetting this, in my humble opinion, lay {{the error}} of the early, or laissez faire School of Political Economy. It was too much {{inclined}} to say to men: 'You are the puppets of certain natural laws. Your own freewill and choice, if they really exist, exist merely as a dangerous disease. <b>All</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> {{to submit to the}} laws, and drift whithersoever they may carry you, for good or evil.' But not less certainly was the same blame to be attached to the French Socialist School. It, though based on a revolt from the Philosophie du neant, philosophie de la misere, as it used to term the laissez faire School, yet retained the worst fallacy of its foe, namely, that man was the creature of circumstances; and denied him just as much as its antagonist the possession of freewill, or at least the right to use freewill on any large scale.|$|E
60|$|So the beardless one {{began to}} lie {{with all his}} might, {{and when he was}} tired of inventing new lies the boy said to him, 'My good fellow, if THAT is <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> it is not much! Listen to me, and I will tell you a true story.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It means,' said he, 'that {{in eight}} days we must promise {{that at some}} future date we will begin to make {{preparations}} {{for something to happen}} in the future. That is about the meaning of it. <b>All</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> now is to be perfectly philosophic, and leave the rest to me.' ...|$|R
50|$|On August 18, 2016, the {{day before}} the albums {{scheduled}} release, lyric annotation site Genius premiered the song Dont Be Nice, along with the lyrics for the entire album. This {{is not the first time}} Watsky premiered music right before the album through Genius; a similar promotion was done for the release of Cardboard Castles and <b>All</b> <b>You</b> <b>Can</b> <b>Do.</b>|$|R
