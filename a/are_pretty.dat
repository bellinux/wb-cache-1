Kaplan drew on about 12 of these special castings during his development program and two were eventually (much later) sold to customers.|$|E
25|$|Lights can be powered through {{electromagnetic}} induction. Reelight, a Danish company, is {{well known}} for this and claims as much as one third of all bikes in Denmark feature it. The lights are mounted on the bike wheels and powered every time a magnet on the wheel spoke passes, eliminating the need for batteries. The advantages <b>are</b> <b>pretty</b> much the same as with dynamo lighting while incurring less resistance to the rider than traditional dynamos and eliminating the noise and wear of the tire.|$|E
25|$|The {{next most}} {{important}} fishery by value is American lobster and Atlantic sea scallop. The Port of New Bedford, Massachusetts is America's #1 Fishing Port with fish landings valued at $369 million. Each year, {{there are nearly}} 50 million pounds of sea scallops landed there. The striped bass was driven to low levels early in the 1980s. Catch restrictions were applied in the mid 1980s, and by 1995 this species of fish had recovered. The region has valuable mollusk fisheries too. Offshore are sea scallops, surfclams, American lobsters and ocean quahog. Inshore are oysters, blue mussels, blue crabs, and clam fisheries. These fisheries <b>are</b> <b>pretty</b> much fully exploited.|$|E

25|$|In {{spite of}} its name, The Maritimes has a humid {{continental}} climate of the warm-summer subtype. Especially in coastal Nova Scotia, differences between summers and winters <b>are</b> <b>pretty</b> narrow compared with most of Canada. The inland climate of New Brunswick is in stark contrast during winter, resembling more continental areas. Summers are somewhat tempered by the marine influence throughout the provinces, but due to the southerly parallels still remain similar to more continental areas further west. Yarmouth in Nova Scotia has significant marine influence to have a borderline oceanic microclimate, but winter nights are still cold even in all coastal areas. The northernmost areas of New Brunswick are only just above subarctic with very cold continental winters.|$|E
25|$|English {{is taught}} {{throughout}} China's secondary {{schools and the}} English language section is a required component of the Gaokao, China's college entrance examination. Many Chinese teenagers thus acquire English names, which they may keep and use as nicknames even in Chinese-language contexts. Chinese may adopt English names {{for a variety of}} reasons, including foreigners' difficulty with Chinese tones and the modern Chinese tendency to regard foreign names as modern or egalitarian. The freedom associated with choosing a Chinese given name sometimes leads to choosing English names which seem bizarre to native English speakers. Names like Chlorophyll, Candy, Devil or Whale <b>are</b> <b>pretty</b> common, and even the real English names chosen by Chinese often tend to be rarely used by native English speakers.|$|E

Anarky as a character—and as a broader idea—is much more radical than Ollie." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1994, {{two years}} after the {{publication}} of PIHKAL, the DEA raided his lab. The agency requested that Shulgin turn over his license for violating the license's terms, and he was fined $25,000 for possession of anonymous samples sent to him for quality testing. In the 15 years preceding the publication of PIHKAL, two announced and scheduled reviews failed to find any irregularities. Richard Meyer, spokesman for DEA's San Francisco Field Division, has stated that, [...] "It is our opinion that those books <b>are</b> <b>pretty</b> much cookbooks on how to make illegal drugs.

Rockfeedback's Thomas Hannan stated, [...] "It's all very clever, but the most intelligent thing about it is that it makes you think about the original in a completely altered way." [...] Pitchfork Media's Nitsuh Adebe was impressed with the album and indicated that it is [...] "surprisingly good, and surprisingly often".|$|E

500|$|Regarding the band's reunion, Lytle noted, [...] "The bargain I {{made myself}} {{regarding}} the 'brief reunion and couple of shows' situation was that I wasn't gonna {{talk too much}} about it.

There are just going to be a few shows. Festival-type thingies. Perhaps the odd 'warm up gig' in someone's hair salon or something.

[...] Robert Christgau called the song [...] "orgiastic". MuuMuse gave a positive review for [...] "Throb", defining it as [...] "a '90's purist's house track, featuring classic dance rhythms and beat breaks". The reviewer continued saying the song is [...] "a much grittier experience than the slinky seduction" [...] of Madonna's [...] "Erotica" [...] single released the year before, and finished saying [...] "Surprisingly however, the track has aged brilliantly, and listening to it now is still an overly enjoyable experience".|$|E
