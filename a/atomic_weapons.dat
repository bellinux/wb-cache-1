5|$|Okinawa was {{declared}} secure by Allied forces on 21 June 1945, after an intense and costly battle. Japan surrendered in August 1945, after being bombed twice with <b>atomic</b> <b>weapons.</b> The apparent willingness of Japan to sacrifice {{so many of}} its people using suicidal tactics such as Operation Ten-Go and in the Battle of Okinawa reportedly {{was a factor in}} the American decision to employ <b>atomic</b> <b>weapons</b> against Japan.|$|E

5|$|After {{the bombings}} at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, {{a number of}} Manhattan Project {{physicists}} founded the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, which began as an emergency action undertaken by scientists who saw urgent need for an immediate educational program about <b>atomic</b> <b>weapons.</b> In {{the face of the}} destructiveness of the new weapons and in anticipation of the nuclear arms race several project members including Bohr, Bush and Conant expressed the view that it was necessary to reach agreement on international control of nuclear research and <b>atomic</b> <b>weapons.</b> The Baruch Plan, unveiled {{in a speech to the}} newly formed United Nations Atomic Energy Commission (UNAEC) in June 1946, proposed the establishment of an international atomic development authority, but was not adopted.|$|E

5|$|The Nuclear Weapons Storage Area at Loring once {{operated}} as a separate, {{top secret}} facility. Originally called the North River Depot, the remote {{area to the}} northeast of Loring's property was the first U.S. operational site specifically constructed for the storage, assembly, and testing of <b>atomic</b> <b>weapons.</b>|$|E
5|$|From June 1951 to May 1953, Hayward {{was head}} of the Military Applications Division of the Atomic Energy Commission, where he {{conducted}} <b>atomic</b> <b>weapons</b> laboratory work at Los Alamos National Laboratory. He also worked on the foundation of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory program in 1952 in close collaboration with Edward Teller. The culmination of this was working on the Ivy Mike nuclear test.|$|E
5|$|During the 1940s RAF Aldermaston {{was created}} on the parkland at the {{southern}} end of the parish, with XIX Tactical Air Command stationed at the manor house. After World War II, the manor was returned to AEI who built the MERLIN reactor on part of the land. The reactor was opened on 6 November 1959 by The Duke of Edinburgh. With the opening of the <b>Atomic</b> <b>Weapons</b> Research Establishment (AWRE) in 1950, Aldermaston became synonymous with a number of CND marches.|$|E

5|$|Following a {{domestic}} {{debate over the}} permanent management of the nuclear program, the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) {{was created by the}} Atomic Energy Act of 1946 to take over the functions and assets of the Manhattan Project. It established civilian control over atomic development, and separated the development, production and control of <b>atomic</b> <b>weapons</b> from the military. Military aspects were taken over by the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project (AFSWP). Although the Manhattan Project ceased to exist on 31 December 1946, the Manhattan District would remain until it too was abolished on 15 August 1947.|$|E
5|$|In 1887 the {{population}} of the parish was 528. By 1896, {{the population}} had grown to 585. The population fluctuated steadily around 550 until the 1950s and 1960s, when a population explosion resulted in the 1961 UK census reporting 2,186 residents in the parish. This coincides {{with the opening of the}} <b>Atomic</b> <b>Weapons</b> Establishment in the early 1950s, and the majority of this figure counts residents in the parts of Tadley within the parish of Aldermastonâ€”between 1901 and 1961, 368 houses were built in the parish.|$|E
5|$|On 17 December 1954, the North Atlantic Council {{approved}} MC 48, a key {{document in}} the evolution of NATO nuclear thought. MC 48 emphasized that NATO would have to use <b>atomic</b> <b>weapons</b> from the outset of a war with the Soviet Union whether or not the Soviets chose to use them first. This gave SACEUR the same prerogatives for automatic use of nuclear weapons as existed for the commander-in-chief of the US Strategic Air Command.|$|E

He returned to Glasgow in 1959 as principal the Royal College of Science and Technology. When it became the University of Strathclyde in 1964, the first new university in Scotland in 384 years, he became its first Principal and Vice Chancellor. While her husband was Principal, Joan founded the Strathclyde Women's Group and became its president.|$|E
5|$|The Allied bombing {{campaign}} {{was one of}} the main factors which influenced the Japanese government's decision to surrender in mid-August 1945. However, there has been a long-running debate over the morality of the attacks on Japanese cities, and the use of <b>atomic</b> <b>weapons</b> is particularly controversial. The most commonly cited estimate of Japanese casualties from the raids is 333,000 killed and 473,000 wounded. There are a number of other estimates of total fatalities, however, which range from 241,000 to 900,000. In addition to the loss of mostly civilian life, the raids contributed to a large decline in industrial production.|$|E
5|$|The {{proceedings}} {{were initiated}} after Oppenheimer refused to voluntarily {{give up his}} security clearance while working as an <b>atomic</b> <b>weapons</b> consultant for the government, under a contract due to expire {{at the end of}} June 1954. Several of his colleagues testified at the hearings. As a result of the two to one decision of the hearing's three judges, he was stripped of his security clearance one day before his consultant contract was due to expire. The panel found that he was loyal and discreet with atomic secrets, but did not recommend that his security clearance be reinstated.|$|E

50|$|The {{predecessor}} to the FCDA, the Office of Civilian Defense was abolished in June 1945 {{with the}} end of World War II. In the period between the end of the World War and 1949, when the Soviet Union detonated their first <b>atomic</b> <b>weapon,</b> little was given to the topic of civil defense. After the Soviets demonstration of their first <b>atomic</b> <b>weapon</b> there was a feeling of the need to do something throughout both the American public and government. This led to, among many actions, the creation of the Federal Civil Defense Administration by President Harry S. Truman in 1950.|$|R
50|$|The Los Alamos, V-Site was {{the site}} of {{assembly}} for the Trinity device, the first <b>atomic</b> <b>weapon</b> ever detonated. In October 2006, the AHF co-hosted several days of events to commemorate the successful restoration of the High Bay building.|$|R
5|$|Truman's second inauguration was {{the first}} ever {{televised}} nationally. His second term was grueling as his opponents controlled Congress and his policy of rollback in Korea failed. The Soviet Union's atomic bomb project progressed much faster than had been expected and they detonated their first bomb on August 29, 1949. In response, on January 7, 1953, Truman announced the detonation of the first U.S. hydrogen bomb, which was much {{more powerful than the}} Soviets' <b>atomic</b> <b>weapons.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 12 July Ward {{reported}} on the weekend's events to MI5. He told Woods that Ivanov and Profumo had met and that the latter had shown considerable interest in Keeler. Ward also stated {{that he had been}} asked by Ivanov for information about the future arming of West Germany with <b>atomic</b> <b>weapons.</b> This request for military information did not greatly disturb MI5, who expected a GRU officer to ask such questions. Profumo's interest in Keeler was an unwelcome complication in their plans to use her in a honey trap operation against Ivanov, to help secure his defection. Woods therefore referred the issue to MI5's director-general, Sir Roger Hollis.|$|E
5|$|On 16 October, Kennedy was {{informed}} that U-2 flights over Cuba had discovered what were most likely medium-range missile sites, and though he and his advisors considered approaching Khrushchev through diplomatic channels, {{could come up with}} no way of doing this that would not appear weak. On 22 October, Kennedy addressed his nation by television, revealing the missiles' presence and announcing a blockade of Cuba. Informed in advance of the speech but not (until one hour before) the content, Khrushchev and his advisors feared an invasion of Cuba. Even before Kennedy's speech, they ordered Soviet commanders in Cuba that they could use all weapons against an attackâ€”except <b>atomic</b> <b>weapons.</b>|$|E
50|$|His final {{military}} {{assignment was}} to Headquarters Field Command, Defense Atomic Support Agency, Sandia Base, New Mexico, as deputy commander for weapons and training {{where he was}} responsible for managing <b>atomic</b> <b>weapon</b> development and training activities and the nuclear weapons stockpile.|$|R

5|$|The {{discovery}} of nuclear fission by German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in 1938, and its theoretical explanation by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch, made {{the development of}} an atomic bomb a theoretical possibility. Fears that a German atomic bomb project would develop <b>atomic</b> <b>weapons</b> first, especially among scientists who were refugees from Nazi Germany and other fascist countries, were expressed in the Einstein-Szilard letter. This prompted preliminary research in the United States in late 1939. Progress was slow until the arrival of the British MAUD Committee report in late 1941, which indicated that only 5â€“10 kilograms of isotopically enriched uranium-235 was needed for a bomb instead of tons of un-enriched uranium and a neutron moderator (e.g. heavy water).|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of the neutron by James Chadwick in 1932, followed by that of nuclear fission by German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in 1938, and its theoretical explanation (and naming) by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch soon after, opened up {{the possibility of a}} controlled nuclear chain reaction using uranium. At the time, few scientists in the United States thought that an atomic bomb was practical, but the possibility that a German atomic bomb project would develop <b>atomic</b> <b>weapons</b> sufficiently concerned scientists who were refugees from Nazi Germany and other fascist countries, that they drafted the Einsteinâ€“Szilard letter to warn President Franklin D. Roosevelt. This prompted preliminary research in the United States, beginning in late 1939.|$|E
