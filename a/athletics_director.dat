5|$|Demand {{for tickets}} by Alabama fans {{was so great}} that the Alabama ticket office accidentally {{oversold}} its allotment of tickets. The office neglected to limit purchases on the forms sent to season-ticket holders, and the office received more than 25,000 orders for its 12,500-ticket allotment. An additional 2,000 tickets were given to Alabama, but the school still had to send out more than 10,000 refunds. Alabama's <b>athletics</b> <b>director</b> was heavily criticized for overselling the ticket allotment and for limiting ticket distribution to fans who had contributed large amounts of money to the athletics department. A group of fans disgruntled at the ticket distribution process eventually levied a class-action lawsuit against the athletic director, claiming contract violations.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze the moral {{reasoning}} of university presidents and <b>athletics</b> <b>directors</b> in sport settings, an area into which few initiatives have been undertaken. Electronic surveys were used to collect data from leaders of institutions currently participating in Division I intercollegiate athletics. Respondents were asked to complete an on-line survey consisting of the Hahm-Beller Values Choice Inventory (HBVCI- 16) and demographic questions related to their prior undergraduate athletic involvement, occupational tenure, and gender. Eighty-six useable responses were collected. A series of ANOVAs were used to assess differences between university presidents and <b>athletics</b> <b>directors</b> on measures of moral reasoning. Results of the analysis showed no statistical significance indicating that presidents and <b>athletics</b> <b>directors</b> reason from a moderate deontological level and the conventional level of Kohlberg's hierarchy of moral reasoning. A series of additional ANOVAs found significant interactions for the variables leadership position, football division, and tenure. Findings show stakeholders involved in managing Division I athletics programs have similar ethical views in sport settings; however, variables influencing administrators' views include length of occupational tenure and the presence of a football program. These findings contribute to the body of knowledge on moral reasoning in sport settings, yet additional research should be conducted to further investigate the impact of tenure and football. Ed.

500|$|At the team's annual awards night, Farmer won {{the award}} for fewest {{turnovers}} per minute played (32 in 705 minutes), but the free throw award [...] won by Farmer the previous three years [...] went to Gimel Martinez. <b>Athletics</b> <b>director</b> C.
