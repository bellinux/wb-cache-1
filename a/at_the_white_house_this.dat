2500|$|The NBC {{telecast}} of the game, with play-by-play announcer Dick Enberg {{and color}} commentators Merlin Olsen and Bob Griese (who {{was not in}} the booth with Enberg and Olsen), garnered the third highest Nielsen rating of any Super Bowl to date, a 48.3 but it ended up being the first Super Bowl to garner over 90 million viewers the highest to date up to that point. While Dick Enberg, Merlin Olsen and Bob Griese called the game, Bob Costas and his NFL '85 castmates, Ahmad Rashad and Pete Axthelm anchored the pregame, halftime and postgame coverage. Other contributors included Charlie Jones (recapping Super Bowl I) and Bill Macatee. Also, the pregame coverage included what became known as [...] "the silent minute"; a 60-second countdown over a black screen (a concept devised by then-NBC Sports executive Michael Weisman); a skit featuring comedian Rodney Dangerfield and an interview by NBC Nightly News anchor Tom Brokaw of United States President Ronald Reagan <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> (<b>this</b> would not become a regular Super Bowl pregame feature until Super Bowl XLIII; when Today show host Matt Lauer interviewed U.S. President Barack Obama).|$|E

50|$|With the {{collapse}} of discussions about extending the stay of U.S. troops, President Obama announced the full withdrawal of troops from Iraq, as previously scheduled, on 21 October 2011. The U.S. retained an embassy in Baghdad with some 17,000 personnel, consulates in Basra, Mosul and Kirkuk, which have been allocated more than 1,000 staff each, and between 4,000 and 5,000 defense contractors. President Obama and al-Maliki outlined a broad agenda for post-war cooperation without American troops in Iraq during a joint press conference on 12 December 2011 <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House.</b> <b>This</b> agenda included cooperation on energy, trade and education as well as cooperation in security, counter-terrorism, economic development and strengthening Iraq's institutions.

5000|$|Throughout Nixon's {{presidency}} {{he referred}} to the Wilson desk hundreds of times in official speeches, such as the [...] "Silent majority" [...] speech, and in talks with high ranking visitors. During official White House tours, guides wrongly told of how Woodrow Wilson used the desk. This misconception was first discovered to be untrue by an assistant curator <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House.</b> <b>This</b> assistant curator came to yet another incorrect conclusion about who had previously used the desk. This curator wrongly stated that the desk was not used by Woodrow Wilson, but instead by Vice President Henry Wilson, under President Ulysses S. Grant's administration. The assistant curator enlightened Cecilia Bellinger, a chief researcher in the writing operation at the White House, about the mistake who in turn told William Safire, one of Nixon's speech writers. It fell to Safire to inform Nixon about the mistake in the provenance of the Wilson Desk.|$|E
50|$|Similar to {{the above}} {{quotation}} was another quotation that, while real, was widely misinterpreted in the US press. Yamamoto, when once asked his opinion on the war, pessimistically said {{that the only way}} for Japan to win the war was to dictate terms in the White House. Yamamoto's meaning was that military victory, in a protracted war against an opponent with as much of a population and industrial advantage as the United States possessed, was completely impossible—a rebuff to those who thought that winning a major battle against the US Navy would end the war. However, in the US, his words were recast as a jingoistic boast that he would literally dictate peace terms <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House.</b> <b>This</b> deliberate mistranslation became famous when read by narrator Walter Huston over stock footage of Yamamoto and his men on parade, in Frank Capra's Why We Fight propaganda films, and spread by word of mouth all over the nation.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the sixth}} and seventh seasons, The West Wing explores a leak of top-secret {{information}} by a senior staffer <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House.</b> <b>This</b> leak {{has been compared to}} events surrounding the Valerie Plame affair. In the storyline, the International Space Station is damaged and can no longer produce oxygen for the astronauts to breathe. With no other methods of rescue available, the President is reminded of the existence of a top-secret military space shuttle. Following the President's inaction, the shuttle story is leaked to a White House reporter, Greg Brock (analogous to Judith Miller), who prints the story in The New York Times. Brock will not reveal his source and goes to jail for failing to do so, as did Miller. In order to stop the investigation, in which authorities suspect Chief of Staff C.J. Cregg, Toby Ziegler admits to leaking the information, and the President is forced to dismiss him. In comparison, the Plame affair resulted in the arrest and conviction of [...] "Scooter" [...] Libby, the Vice President's chief of staff. However, Libby was convicted of perjury in testimony to a grand jury. No one was convicted for [...] "blowing the cover" [...] of Plame. (Richard Armitage, an official in the Bush State Department, acknowledged leaking information about Plame to reporters but was never charged with a crime.) Libby's two and a half-year prison sentence was later commuted by President Bush, though the other facet of his sentence ($250,000 fine) stood and was duly paid. In the series finale, President Bartlet, as his last official act, pardons Ziegler.|$|E
40|$|Everybody {{wants to}} be a king, to be free to do what they want. Presidents {{particularly}} want to be kings. After successfully negotiating the gauntlet of the modern presidential campaign, they arrive at the White House profoundly determined to realize their visions for the country. The framers would have expected no less. They understood all about this “monarchial” view of human nature. They designed a government to restrain it. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>this</b> design of American government becomes, at least from a presidential perspective, a presidential problem. To succeed, Presidents must act “unkingly. ” Usually they conform {{in one way or another}} to this rule, but sometimes they don’t. They act in a kingly fashion. They ignore constitutional restraints and the law. The Bush administration provides the most recent and the most expansive example. A compliant legislature and public has made this possible. Such compliance is a product of both anxiety and civic ignorance. Anxiety has been a product of 9 / 11 and the on-going war on terrorism. Civic ignorance has been the consequence of a school system that no longer sees its mission as teaching students, as William Galston wrote, to be willing and able “to engage in public discourse and evaluate the performance of those in office. ” A citizenry lacking this capacity opens the door to expanding monarchial behavior, undermining American democracy...|$|E
