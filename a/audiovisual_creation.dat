It analyzes, based on theoretical and methodological references of discourse semiotics, three episodes of the cartoon Sponge Bob Square Pants, in regards to effects of meaning produced in the interrelation of the different languages that constitute them, and the meanings children attribute to them. To know the meaning the children gave to the cartoon, a focal group was constituted from a 4 th grade Elementary School class that, after watching each of the episodes, expressed their readings of them. By reading these productions, the children related to facts from their daily routine, turning them into themes. The findings show the importance of reflecting on contemporary visuality in school, seeking to gather both the effects of meaning and what the children mean when they interact with such productions, and signal to possibilities of reading of <b>audiovisual</b> <b>creations...</b>|$|R

40|$|In iTV {{and online}} video, {{narrative}} interaction {{has long been}} a Holy Grail for both audiences and creators of these digital audiovisual works. On the one hand, interactive digital narrative promises interactors some exciting opportunities: to enter the world of the story, to affect the story and perhaps even to control its outcome, and in the process to gain a transformative self-revelation. On the other hand, this new medium changes the role and craft of the author and entails a host of technological, conceptual, and institutional challenges. The authors describe these opportunities and challenges in detail, before examining various projects that have attempted to realize this vision and grapple with the challenges. Works discussed span several decades, from the late 1960 s to 2015. They also span a variety of forms, including interactive cinema, online video, interactive television, and both video- and animation-based games. Particular emphasis is given to contemporary interactive documentaries (iDocs). The chapter further discusses current research directions, such as explorations of the increasing incorporation of the interactor’s body and affects as well as second-screen and cross-device integration, and concludes with a fresh look at the original vision in light of conceptual and design approaches, current technological developments, their implications on the changing landscape of <b>audiovisual</b> content <b>creation</b> and consumption, and the new creative space of opportunities that they open up...|$|R

40|$|This study {{discusses}} how audiovisual content {{can influence}} brand quality perceptions. The {{purpose of this}} study is to explore how <b>audiovisual</b> content <b>creation</b> can increase brand quality perceptions. This research problem is addressed with three sub questions, which aim at clarifying the role of emotions between content marketing and brand quality perception, explaining how different functions of audiovisual content can increase brand quality perception, and by identifying and comparing the key differences in content creation in business-to-consumer and business-to-businesscontexts. The theoretical background of the study is in brand personality, consumer emotions, consumerbrand relationships, content marketing and B 2 B branding literature. The empirical research part includes a single-case study. The case company was a Swiss startup that wished to build a highquality brand for both B 2 C and B 2 B segments. The empirical data was collected in September 2014. Eight interviews were conducted; seven with target segment representatives and one with an existing customer of the case company. The empirical findings were analyzed with thematic analysis and finally a 5 -stage framework was created based on the findings of the research, offering a guideline for high-quality content creation. This study finds that emotions play an important role in brand quality perceptions. Psychological processes, emotion, cognition and conation, influence the engagement process of the target segment which ultimately can lead to activation and electronic word-of-mouth. Brand quality perception is the result of the overall emotion of the brand. The overall emotion derives from brand personality, brand concept, product attributes and utilitarian benefits of the brand. The entertaining and educational functions of the audiovisual content can target and evoke these emotional processes, and result in increased quality perceptions. In the B 2 B context, emotions are found to play a relatively smaller role in the quality perception processes. However, the significance of emotions cannot be ignored, since they can emphasize the value for the buying organization, and build on the trust and loyalty among the potential customers. The final framework presents five stages of content creation that ultimately improve brand quality perceptions. These stages help marketers to design and implement their content and evoke positive emotions in their target segment as part of a quality-based marketing strategy. Further research is warranted to quantitatively test the generalizability of the framework. Further research is also suggested to make the framework adaptable to different stages of the brand life cycle...|$|R

Although, at some point, this strategy still becomes a problem in Indonesian film fields. Sang Pencerah film that was directed by Hanung Bramantyo is one of Indonesian films that attempted to deliver local identity in its storytelling. This research is an endeavour to identify Indonesian cultural identity that has been represented through Sang Pencerah film. By applying cultural studies and interdisciplinary as their methods, the researchers acquired some interesting findings. Firstly, aesthetic and thematic elements in the film narrative had a significant relation to traditional and cultural values of Javanese society. Secondly, the meaning of cultural identity also had a linear proportion to spiritual values in life, such as determination, peacefulness, gloriness, tolerance, as well as social understanding.
