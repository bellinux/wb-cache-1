Inside the packaging, there is an oil-on-canvas of the band dressed as mop-top skinheads in a tube train.

[...] Peter Paterson of the Daily Mail praised the series for breaking away from the [...] "dreary sameness" [...] of Casualty, and for presenting [...] "a less hopeless view of the NHS." [...] His only concern about the series was its continuation of patient storylines from Casualty, writing: [...] "if that happens too often, the new programme will soon lose its freshness and sparkle." [...] The Mirror Charlie Catchpole wrote that he was [...] "sick of the sensitive, hand–wringing, non–judgmental do–gooders who mope around the A department in Casualty", praising in comparison the [...] "pushy, ambitious, cynical and generally thoroughly unpleasant surgeons" [...] in Holby City.|$|E

We described our MARIE system that interprets English queries directing the fetch of media objects. it is novel {{in the extent}} to which it exploits previously interpreted and indexed English captions for the media objects. Our routine filtering of queries through descriptively-complex captions (as opposed to keyword lists) before retrieving data can actually improve retrieval speed, as media data are often bulky and time consuming to retrieve, difficult upon which to perform content analysis, and even small improvements to query prevision can often pay off. Handling the English of captions and queries about them is not <b>as</b> difficult <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>seems,</b> <b>as</b> the matching does not require deep understanding, just a comprehensive type hierarchy for caption concepts. An important innovation of MARIE is supercaptions describing sets of captions, which can minimize caption redundancy. Databases, Natural-language, Captions, Multimedia[URL]...|$|R

The National Archives states that [...] "beds and other pieces of household furniture were often the sole bequest to a wife" [...] and that, customarily, the children would receive the best items and the widow the second-best. In Shakespeare's time, the beds of prosperous citizens were expensive affairs, sometimes equivalent in value to a small house. The bequest was thus not as minor <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>seem</b> in modern times. In Elizabethan custom the best bed {{in the house was}} reserved for guests. If so, then the bed that Shakespeare bequeathed to Anne could have been their marital bed, and thus not intended to insult her.|$|E
2500|$|In Classical Hebrew transliteration, vowels can be long (gāḏōl), short (qāṭān) or ultra short (ḥăṭep̄), and are transliterated as such. Ultra short vowels {{are always}} one of šəwā nāʻ ְ, ḥăṭep̄ səḡōl ֱ, ḥăṭep̄ páṯaḥ ֲ or ḥăṭep̄ qāmeṣ ֳ. Šəwā ְ is always always šəwā nāʻ (pronounced) if it's {{immediately}} after the word's first consonant, or after a consonant after a long vowel and before another pronounced consonantotherwise, šəwā is realized as šəwā nāḥ (silent).

The vowels ḥīreq ִ, səḡōl ֶ, páṯaḥ ַ, qāmeṣ ָ, qibbūṣ ֻ and šūreq [...] are always long if they are the stressed syllable, or {{if they are in}} a syllable before only one consonant and another vowel, and in these cases they are transliterated as long.

2500|$|Yet the {{cross-cultural}} Hafsid {{alliance with}} Spain {{was not as}} unusual <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>seem,</b> given the many Muslim-Christian treaties—despite recurrent hostilities. Indeed, during the early 16th century, France allied with the Ottomans against the Spanish King Carlos. As an indirect result of Spain's Africa policy, a few Muslim rulers encouraged Turkish forces to enter the region to counter the Spanish presence. Yet the Hafsid rulers of Tunis {{came to see the}} Turks and their corsair allies as a greater threat and entered a Spanish alliance, as also did the Sa'dids of Morocco. Nonetheless many Maghriban Muslims strongly preferred Islamic rule, and the Hafsid's decades-long Spanish alliance was not generally popular, indeed anathema to some. The author earlier had attributed this Maghriban mood of intolerance, both popular and scholarly, to the 1492 fall of Granada to Spanish forces and its consequences (immigration of Moorish Andalusians, loss of the 'buffer state' of Granada). Abun-Nasr (1971) at 157–158. [...] "his situation infused into Magriban theology an uncompromising strain comparable to the strictness of the Kharijite doctrine. [...] went to the extent of pronouncing infidels the Andalusians who were of the opinion that life in Spain was preferable to... the Magrhib, on the grounds that a true Muslim should always prefer to live under a Muslim prince. These standpoints would have been condemned by Muslim theologians during periods of strength and prosperity." [...] This enmity continued due to a bitter combination of European attacks, corsair raiding, and [...] "by linking it to Ottoman championing of the cause of Islam." [...] Abun-Nasr (1971) at 158. On the other hand, the Saadi dynasty sultans of Morocco successfully played off Iberian against Turk, thus managing to remain both Muslim ruled and independent of the Ottoman grasp.|$|E

Nonetheless, the correct implementation of risk management by public entities might be a difficult task to accomplish. The Dutch case is an interesting example, since municipalities in the Netherlands have a special bylaw for risk management. However <b>as</b> innovative <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>seems</b> for the public context, {{there would be some}} evidence of the difficulties that municipalities in the Netherlands have faced in the implementation of risk management practices (Boorsma and Haisma, 2005). Although there would be no accepted methodologies for impartially measure management practices across different industries, we consider that maturity models could contribute on the task of assessing the implementation of risk management practices. However taking to account the fundamental and practical difficulties found in current risk maturity models, we have made significant efforts to explain and also adapt this method to the characteristics of these entities. Accordingly, we state that Organizational Change and Organizational Learning theory would assist us on the explanation of the evolutionary logic assumed by risk maturity models. When applying the improved risk maturity model to a sample of municipalities in the Netherlands, we found interesting findings and empirical support for the construct validity of our proposed model. Although we still considered this risk maturity model a developing method that needs additional enhancements, we strongly believe that it could be a pertinent instrument for the assessment of risk management process in Dutch municipalities, influencing also the implementation of best risk management practices by these organizations. On the other hand, our principal scientific contribution has been to study and interpret the logic of risk maturity models, identifying theories that could explain their reasoning. We have also incorporated in our model the different stages of the risk management cycle as the main forces for this evolutionary learning process. As a result, we believe that we have fulfilled the gaps found in the literature, making a relevant contribution to the field...|$|R
