50|$|Re MC Bacon Ltd 1991 Ch 127 is a UK {{insolvency}} law case relating {{specifically to the}} recovery the legal costs of the liquidator in relation to an <b>application</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> a floating charge as a unfair preference.|$|E
5000|$|Observing {{that the}} {{defendant}} did not exhibit or tender any proposed defence to the action, Justice Atkinson concluded that it did [...] "not {{appear to have a}} plausible defence such as would cause the court to exercise its discretion to set aside the default judgment". As a result, her Honour dismissed the defendant's <b>application</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> default judgment.|$|E
50|$|Adfin (Pty) Ltd v Durable Engineering Works (Pty) Ltd is an {{important}} case in South African law, particularly {{in the area of}} civil procedure. An <b>application</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> the respondent's combined summons as an irregular proceeding, it was heard in the Cape Provincial Division by Berman J on 16 February 1990. Judgment was handed down on 2 March. The applicant's attorneys were Saacks & Jaffe; the respondent's were Bornman & Hayward. E. Sakinofsky appeared for the applicant and LM Olivier for the respondent.|$|E
5000|$|The {{case was}} a review of a {{decision}} by the Master to reject an objection to the liquidator's account. Proceedings were initiated by way of combined summons. The <b>application</b> was <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> the combined summons as an irregular proceeding {{on the grounds that the}} provisions of Rule 53 of Uniform Rules of Court (providing that proceedings on review [...] "shall be by way of notice of motion") and of section 407(4)(a) of the Companies Act (providing that a person aggrieved by the Master's direction may [...] "apply to Court") required that proceedings be brought by way of notice of motion. The court dismissed application on the grounds that neither Rule 53 nor section 407(4)(a) rendered proceedings by way of notice of motion peremptory.|$|R
50|$|In law, {{a motion}} <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> {{judgment}} is an <b>application</b> <b>to</b> overturn or <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> a court's judgment, verdict or other final ruling in a case. Such a motion is proposed by a party who is {{dissatisfied with the}} end result of a case. Motions may be made at any time after entry of judgment, and in some circumstances years after the case has been closed by the courts. Generally the motion cannot be based on grounds which were previously considered when deciding a motion for new trial or on an appeal of the judgment, thus the motion can only be granted in unusual circumstances, such as when the judgment was procured by fraud which could not have been discovered {{at the time of the}} trial, or if the court entering the judgment lacked the jurisdiction to do so.|$|R
40|$|In Hill v Robertson Suspension Systems Pty Ltd [2009] QDC 165 McGill DCJ {{considered}} the procedural {{requirements for the}} service of originating process on a company, and for proving that service {{for the purpose of}} obtaining default judgment. The judge’s views adopt a strict and technical construction of the requirements for an affidavit of service under r 120 (1) (b). Though clearly obiter, they may well affect the approach taken on <b>applications</b> <b>to</b> enter or <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> default judgments in the lower courts. Pending further judicial consideration of the issue, it is suggested the prudent course is to ensure that the deponent of an affidavit for service effected under s 109 X(1) (a) of the Act deposes not only to the location of the registered office of the company but also, at a minimum, provides the source of that information...|$|R
50|$|In {{practice}} an <b>application</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> Default Judgment {{is almost}} always granted. This fact is seized upon by so-called 'credit repair' companies. A person whose credit record is adversely affected by a registered judgment pays a credit repair company who advises them how to apply to have it set aside. This is usually of little effect: the judgment will be re-entered very quickly {{if there is no}} actual defense, and there are usually other records which affect a person's credit rating, not just the judgment.|$|E

In upholding the lower court's original order, the High Court began its analysis of the issue by noting that, as a result of Dow Jones & Co. Inc. v Gutnick, it is [...] "...well settled now that an internet publication takes place in any jurisdiction where the relevant words are read or downloaded." ...|$|E
50|$|Piatco (and its German partner, Fraport) have instituted {{arbitration}} proceedings before different international bodies to recover a fair settlement. Piatco sued the government before the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) in Singapore. Fraport separately sued the Philippine {{government at the}} International Center for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) in Washington. In 2007, the ICSID case was decided {{in favor of the}} Philippine government because of a violation of Philippine law by Fraport. However, this decision was annulled in 2010 due to a violation of Fraport's right to be heard. A new proceeding before the ICSID is ongoing. Piatco formally withdrew its second <b>application</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> the earlier ICC ruling that dismissed its claims against the Philippine government on December 2011. The ICC ruling in favor of the Philippine government became final and executory in 2012.|$|E
5000|$|In late November {{or early}} December 1781 {{the captain and}} crew of the English slave ship, Zong, threw various African slaves into the sea off the island of Hispaniola, ostensibly to {{save the lives of}} the {{remaining}} slaves as provisions were short. The shipowners then sought to claim under policies of insurance, arguing that jettisoning the cargo constituted a recoverable loss, even though it necessarily resulted in the murder of the slaves. In the first round of legal proceedings a jury initially held for the shipowners and upheld the claim. On a subsequent <b>application</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> that judgment <b>aside,</b> Lord Mansfield indicated that the jury in the initial trial [...] "had no doubt (though it shocks one very much) that the Case of Slaves was the same as if Horses had been thrown over board ... [...] That finding was overturned and fresh trial ordered, but in both legal actions it was accepted in principle by the court that the killing of the negro slaves was permissible, and did not thereby invalidate the insurance by virtue of being an unlawful act. [...] Shortly afterwards provisions in the Slave Trade Act 1788 made it unlawful to insure against similar losses of slaves.|$|R

50|$|The Applicant, D Arbili {{represented}} by Dominic Levent Solicitors, and the Respondent, his ex-wife C Arbili, {{represented by}} Howard Kennedy {{at the time}} of the hearing; had been married for 7 years before divorcing and engaging in financial proceedings to split the family’s assets. At the initial hearing an order was made for the assets to split whereby the Respondent, Mrs Arbili, received the equity from the family home (a £1m grade-II listed barn in Essex), one of two French villas held in the Applicants name and a £140,000 lump sum, taking the total received to over £600,000 - allowing her to purchase a new home. However, the Applicant thereafter instructed agents to delve into the Respondent's finances and found that Mrs Arbili was in line to receive a share of her parents £2.1m property on the French Riviera. The information was obtained by hacking into the Respondents emails and the Applicant sought to rely on this information to set aside the financial order as the Respondent had not complied by providing full disclosure whilst financial proceedings were ongoing. The Respondent argued that given the Respondents interest in her parent's property, he would not have included his French villa in considering the original financial proceedings. The Applicant's <b>application</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> was refused and he thereafter appealed.|$|E
5000|$|After {{rejecting the}} defendant’s {{argument}} that judgment had been irregularly entered, her Honour discussed {{the circumstances in}} which the court will set aside a regularly obtained judgment, reiterating that the defendant providing a satisfactory explanation for the failure to appear and the length of delay for making the application are both factors that the court will consider. However, citing the Australian Capital Territory case of Sue Oclee Pty Ltd v Bak (1979) 29 ACTR 8, her Honour went on to emphasise the requirement for the defendant to have a prima facie defence on the merits::The decision whether or not to set aside a default judgment is discretionary. An affidavit in support of an <b>application</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> judgment entered into in default of appearance to a writ of summons must set out all the defences on which the defendant intends to rely and briefly set out the facts by which the defendant seeks to establish such defences. A mere statement by the defendant that he or she has a good defence is not sufficient to justify a review of the exercise of judicial discretion. The defendant must demonstrate [...] "a very compelling reason" [...] for the failure to appear and that it has a plausible defence either in law or in fact. Before allowing a defendant to come in and defend, the court should have before it material which enables it to say how it came about that the defendant found itself bound by a judgment regularly entered; that the defendant genuinely desires to be allowed to come in and present its case; and that issues are raised in such a form as to require serious consideration of the defence put forward.|$|E

40|$|The {{application}} {{before the}} court in Millerview Constructions Pty Ltd v Palmer Plumbing Pty Ltd [2008] QSC 005 raised a significant question regarding the appropriate construction of s 459 G of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (the Act). The decision emphasises the importance of ensuring that any <b>application</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> a statutory demand must be served in a timely way on the creditor at the creditor’s address for service {{as stated in the}} statutory demand, or in strict compliance with another manner authorised by the Act...|$|E
40|$|The next {{critical}} {{step in the}} judicial process after issue of originating process is service of that process. In order to be valid, service {{must be carried out}} in accordance with the rules or in exceptional cases in accordance with an express agreement between the parties ('consensual service'). If service is not properly effected, the impact on the plaintiff may be significant. Any default judgment he has obtained will usually be classified as an 'irregular' judgment and the defendant will be entitled to have the judgment set aside by the court, without an inquiry into the merits of the defendant's defence. The costs of the <b>application</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> will be borne by the plaintiff. The {{issue of whether or not}} service has been properly effected is topical in Hong Kong, as reflected by the recent spate of cases on this subject. This article (a) examines the procedural rules regulating service of originating process upon an individual within the jurisdiction, and (b) identifies some of the more common difficulties that have arisen in effecting proper service in light of the relevant case law. The article also considers whether the Hong Kong courts have adopted a consistent approach in applying the procedural rules. published_or_final_versio...|$|E

40|$|In {{this report}} microeconometric methods {{are applied to}} explain the {{voluntary}} <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> of arable land of Austrian farms. The descriptive {{analysis of the data}} shows {{that the majority of the}} small scale farms do not <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> arable land. But if they do <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> land, they <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> substantial shares. The microeconometric estimations confirm that the decision <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> consists of two steps. The first step is whether <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> at all and the second step is how much <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>aside.</b> The type of a farm has the biggest effect on the decision. Soil quality, the distribution of the soil quality, off farm work and the participation in the ÖPUL-program have significant, but generally small, influence as well. The results vary somewhat for different major production areas. If the two step model is used to calculate the expected <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> of a farm, it generally is low as farms have low probabilities <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>aside.</b> Most of the farms under the general regulation <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> small shares of arable land. That is due to the fact that every <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> that is more than the mandatory 10 percent is defined a voluntary <b>set</b> <b>aside.</b> Therefore, unfortunately, the statistical estimations are almost impossible to render and hence <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> is not as well explained by the model for farms under the general regulation as for the small scale farms. The main conclusion of the research is that there were no factors that lead <b>to</b> massive <b>set</b> <b>aside.</b> This can be interpreted as a sign that cultivating arable land generally still pays in Austria. ...|$|R
