5|$|If used as <b>a</b> <b>space</b> <b>for</b> rituals, the Hampton Down circle {{would have}} only been able to {{accommodate}} a few individuals standing within it at any given time. It was also not the site of any cremation deposits, unlike some stone circles in Northern Britain. Burl suggested that the Hampton Down Stone Circle may never {{have been part of}} the prehistoric stone circle tradition, but that the stones were actually once the kerbstones of a round barrow. To support this suggestion, he noted that round barrows were known at Poole, around 20 miles (32 kilometres) to the east of the site.|$|E
5|$|The Cummer Museum {{acquired}} the Barnett {{building in the}} early 1990s, remodeling the first floor into the museum’s education center, Art Connections, and using the second floor for administrative offices. The two buildings were connected by the Barnett Concourse, and two more major galleries were added. This expansion was completed in 1992. In early 2002, the museum {{acquired the}} adjacent Woman's Club of Jacksonville, a Tudor-style residential building which would serve as <b>a</b> <b>space</b> <b>for</b> programs and events for the museum. The museum also acquired the Jacobsen Gallery of American Art in 2005, and the Mason Gallery in 2006.|$|E
5|$|The Glidden barn is of {{pole and}} beam construction. The second-floor {{interior}} {{is dominated by}} two large transverse wooden beams.

It is constructed of red brick and stands on a foundation of limestone. Glidden's barn took {{full advantage of the}} term vernacular; the brick was locally manufactured and the limestone locally quarried.|$|E

5|$|Contemporary annals {{began to}} be kept in Wessex during the 7th century. The {{material}} compiled in Alfred's reign included annals relating to Kentish, South Saxon, Mercian and, particularly, West Saxon history, but, {{with the exception of the}} Cynewulf entry, does not gather momentum until it comes to the Nordic invasions of the late 8th century onwards. The Chronicle grew out of the tradition of the Easter Tables, drawn up to help the clergy determine the dates of feasts in future years: a page consisted of a sequence of horizontal lines followed by astronomical data, with <b>a</b> <b>space</b> <b>for</b> short notes of events to distinguish one year from another. As the Chronicle developed, it lost its list-like appearance, and such notes took up more space, becoming more like historical records. Many later entries, especially those written by contemporaries, contained a great deal of historical narrative under the year headings.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, {{a studio}} theatre was {{built at the}} rear of the {{building}} on Monmouth Street, called the Ustinov Studio, named after the actor Peter Ustinov. The front of the building is decorated with a bronze winged figure which was designed by his son, Igor Ustinov, entitled Hopefully. The 150-seat auditorium was originally <b>a</b> <b>space</b> <b>for</b> the youth theatre and small-scale touring productions, but the Ustinov programme soon expanded to encompass classical concerts, stand-up comedy (including high-profile acts such as Bill Bailey, Stewart Lee and Lucy Porter) and in-house productions. To accommodate the technical needs of these productions, a refurbishment was planned to take place throughout 2007, improving the backstage & technical facilities, the foyer, bar and auditorium. The Ustinov Studio re-opened in February 2008, with their own production of Breakfast With Mugabe, starring Joseph Marcell, Miles Anderson and Nicholas Bailey.|$|E

5|$|Itzam K'an Ahk II {{constructed}} {{at least}} five known stelae: 9, 10, 11, 22, and 40. Stelae 9, 10, and 11 were all erected in front of or near Structure J-3. Stela 11, which was erected in August of 731 AD, is of the niche variety, meaning it depicts the ruler seated in a small hollow, or niche, and it was erected to commemorate the accession {{of the individual to}} the position of ajaw. The monument shows the ajaw flanked by subjects, witnesses to the ceremonies explored {{on the face of the}} stela. The expanse in front of the stone slab is designated as <b>a</b> <b>space</b> <b>for</b> offerings, denoted by the depiction of a sacrificed human near the bottom of the monument. The monument was discovered by Teoberto Maler in two pieces on the ground; the front was in good condition, and some pigment was still visible. The glyphs on the upper right have been weathered, but the sides are largely intact. In the 1960s, looters cut the fallen monument into two halves for easier removal. The top portion is currently housed in the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston, Texas, whereas the bottom half is in a private collection in Switzerland.|$|E
5|$|Selke {{retired in}} 1964 and was succeeded by Sam Pollock. Often named the best general manager in NHL history, Pollock led the Canadiens to nine Stanley Cup championships in his 14 {{years at the}} helm of the team. One of his key tactics was trading aging stars to {{expansion}} teams for draft picks, which led to the team drafting future Hall of Famers Guy Lafleur, Larry Robinson and Ken Dryden. The Canadiens won consecutive titles in 1965 and 1966, and entered the 1967 Stanley Cup Final against Toronto as a heavy favourite. The City of Montreal was so confident in the Canadiens that they had already built <b>a</b> <b>space</b> <b>for</b> the Stanley Cup on the Expo 67 site, but the Canadiens fell to the Maple Leafs, in the last NHL finals of the Original Six era.|$|E

5|$|The Danebod Gym Hall {{was erected}} in 1904 {{and is a}} {{cruciform}} clapboard building. The {{two sides of the}} entrance arm project forward to the eaves, and the sides plus a small roof enclose the entrance. It was originally built as <b>a</b> <b>space</b> <b>for</b> Danish gymnastics, folk dancing, music, theatrical performances, larger social gatherings, and worship for the Folk School students and other locals. Every year in the Gym Hall, the Danebod Lutheran Church upholds the Danish tradition of dancing around the Christmas tree. The basement is also commonly used for crafts such as stained glass and woodworking. In 1928 it was enlarged with a stage, basement and furnace. Many home talent plays were presented there, and it is still used for an occasional play, and is also used by the camps and retreats for folk dancing. Points of interest are the statue with an original canvas curtain with advertising, bars used years ago by gymnasts (on the south wall), and the original wainscoting on the walls.|$|E
5|$|The {{practice}} of marking sacred areas began in Japan {{as early as}} the Yayoi period (from about 500BC to 300AD) originating from primal religious beliefs. Features in the landscape such as rocks, waterfalls, islands, and especially mountains, were places believed to be capable of attracting kami, and subsequently were worshiped as yorishiro. Originally, sacred places may have been simply marked with a surrounding fence and an entrance gate or torii. Later, temporary structures similar to present day portable shrines were constructed to welcome the gods to the sacred place, which eventually evolved into permanent buildings that were dedicated to the gods. Ancient shrines were constructed according to the style of dwellings (Izumo Taisha) or storehouses (Ise Grand Shrine). The buildings had gabled roofs, raised floors, plank walls, and were thatched with reed or covered with hinoki cypress bark. Such early shrines did not include <b>a</b> <b>space</b> <b>for</b> worship. Three important forms of ancient shrine architectural styles exist: taisha-zukuri, shinmei-zukuri and sumiyoshi-zukuri. They are exemplified by Izumo Taisha, Nishina Shinmei Shrine and Sumiyoshi Taisha, respectively, and date from before 552AD. According to the tradition of , the buildings or shrines were faithfully rebuilt at regular intervals adhering to the original design. In this manner, ancient styles have been replicated through the centuries to the present day.|$|E
5|$|The tower has {{a three-story}} {{observation}} deck, located on floors 100–102, {{in addition to}} existing broadcast and antenna facilities. Similar to the Empire State Building, visitors are separated from the tenants, having their own separate entrance next to the museum, descending down to a below-ground security screening area. On the observation deck, the actual viewing space is on the 100th floor, {{but there is a}} food court on the 101st floor and <b>a</b> <b>space</b> <b>for</b> events for the 102nd floor. To show visitors the city, and give them information and stories about New York, an interactive tool called City Pulse is used by Tour Ambassadors. The admission fee is $32 per person, but admission discounts are available for children and seniors, and the deck is free for 9/11 responders and families of 9/11 victims. When it opens, the deck is expected to have about 3.5 million visitors per year. Tickets went on sale starting on April 8. However, the Manhattan District Attorney probed the Port Authority about the firm to which it awarded a contract to operate the deck. It officially opened on May 28, 2015, one day ahead of schedule.|$|E
