In A Private Sphere (Polity 2010) she argues that digital technologies are shifting the site of civic engagement to the private realm and hence changing the practices of public participation. She further develops this thesis in her latest book, Affective Publics: Sentiment, Technology and Politics (Oxford University 2014), arguing that social movements sustained by digital media should not be defined by their political efficacy but rather by their affective intensities or how they help publics “feel their way into” an event or issue. Affective Publics won Best Book award for the Human Communication and Technology Division of the National Communication Association in 2015 and was widely praised by critics. In a review of the book for Journal of Communication, Lilie Chouliaraki writes that Affective Publics is [...] "a significant statement in its own right <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>ontology</b> of digital communication. The ways we think about digitality, affect, and politics in the early 21st century cannot from now on be divorced from the conceptual language introduced in the field by this groundbreaking work.” She has also edited two collections, A Networked Self: Identity, Community and Culture on Social Network Sites (Routledge, 2011) and Journalism and Citizenship: New Agendas (Routledge, 2009).|$|E

40|$|Over <b>the</b> past decades, <b>ontologies</b> {{have become}} key {{components}} of information systems [1, 2] and have found various applications such as natural language processing [3], software engineering [4] and knowledge management in the Semantic Web [5]. <b>The</b> use of <b>ontologies</b> also spans many domains including biomedicine, geography and e-commerce. In the biomedical domain – our focus in this special issue – ontologies {{play an important role}} in research [6], healthcare [7] and translational biomedicine [8], supporting tasks including knowledge management, data integration and decision support [9]. A large number of biomedical ontologies have been created by individual researchers, academic consortia, institutions and companies. Most ontologies are created for a given purpose (e. g., to annotate gene products) and independently of existing ontologies. As a consequence, although ontologies are ideally created for sharing and reusing knowledge [10], their impact can be limited to a small audience by lack of diffusion. <b>The</b> abundance of <b>ontologies</b> should be good news to biomedical researchers, as they can in theory select <b>the</b> best <b>ontology</b> for their application.

Creating mappings among ontologies by identifying similar concepts is a critical step in integrating data and applications that use different ontologies.
