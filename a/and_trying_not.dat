Bannon witnessed a younger sorority sister's unabashed infatuation with the older sister. She recalls it was an awkward situation, even though the older sorority sister was [...] "unfailingly gracious" [...] to the younger one. In recognizing the younger woman's attractions, she began to suspect her own sexuality. She said, [...] "I {{saw a lot of}} it happening and I didn't {{know what to make of}} it. I don't even know how to put it—I was absolutely consumed with it, it was an extraordinary thing." [...] Another sorority sister was physically remarkable, very tall—almost , with a husky voice and boyish nickname, that Bannon imagined was a blend of Johnny Weissmuller and Ingrid Bergman. She recalled entering the communal restroom and seeing the sister, [...] "both of us in underwear, and experienc(ing) a sort of electric shock", <b>and</b> <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> to stare at her. In 1954, she graduated with a degree in French and soon married an engineer whose job made them relocate frequently.|$|E

60|$|The other junior Britling {{danced in}} front of the hero, who was walking beside Mrs. Britling <b>and</b> <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> to be too aggressively a soldierly figure. He looked a very man in khaki and more of a boy than ever. Mrs. Teddy came behind, quietly elated.|$|E
60|$|Dr. Alec was {{basking in}} the warmth of the study fire, after his drive, when the sound of a stifled sob made him hurry to the door and look anxiously into the hall. Rose lay in a {{shivering}} bunch near the register, with her things half off, wringing her hands, <b>and</b> <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> to cry with the pain returning warmth brought to her half-frozen fingers.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very patiently I {{waited in}} the dark little hole, {{listening}} to the steady 'tick-tock!' of the machinery behind me <b>and</b> <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> to be nervous. After awhile I heard the old man {{come into the room}} and exclaim sorrowfully because his captive cuckoo had escaped from its cage. He could not imagine what had become of me, and I kept still and laughed to myself to think how I would presently surprise him.|$|E

60|$|He groaned aloud, so {{that the}} Italians noticed it, and doubtless spoke of it among themselves. He could not {{understand}} their dialect, but he feigned them saying respectfully compassionate things. Then he gnashed his teeth again, and cursed his folly. When the bell rang for supper he found himself very hungry, and ate heavily. After that he went {{out in front of}} the cabin, and walked up and down, thinking, <b>and</b> <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> to think. The turmoil in his mind tired him like a prodigious physical exertion.|$|E
60|$|What else in {{the world}} could she say? He would not get it till he woke about eleven. With the {{instinct}} to take all the respite she could, and knowing no more than before how she would receive his return, she went out in the forenoon and wandered about all day shopping <b>and</b> <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> to think. Returning at tea-time, she went straight up to her baby, and there heard from Betty that he had come, and gone out with his violin to the music-room.|$|E
60|$|Holding fast, lest a rash motion {{should set}} him {{bounding}} further down, {{like a living}} ball, Corny took an observation as rapidly as possible, for the red light was fading, and the mist rising from the valley. All he could see was a narrow ledge where the tree stood, and anxious to reach a safer bed for the night, he climbed cautiously down to drop on the rock, so full of gratitude for safety that he could only lie quite still for a little while, thinking of mother, <b>and</b> <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> to cry.|$|E

6000|$|She {{found herself}} {{alone in the}} train asking herself what she must do next, <b>and</b> <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> to think of herself as cut off from home or any refuge {{whatever}} from the world she had resolved to face. She felt smaller and more adventurous even than she had expected to feel. [...] "Let me see," [...] she said to herself, trying to control a slight sinking of the heart, [...] "I am {{going to take a}} room in a lodging-house because that is cheaper.... But perhaps I had better get a room in an hotel to-night and look round....|$|E
60|$|One afternoon, {{just before}} dinner, {{she felt so}} tired of doing nothing, that she slipped out for a run. It had been a dull day; but the sun was visible now, setting brightly below the clouds. It was cold but still and Polly trotted down the smooth, snow-covered mall humming to herself, <b>and</b> <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> to feel homesick. The {{coasters}} were at it with all their might, and she watched them, till her longing to join the fun grew irresistible. On the hill, some little girls were playing with their sleds, real little girls, in warm hoods and coats, rubber boots and mittens, and Polly felt drawn toward them {{in spite of her}} fear of Fan.|$|E
6000|$|For {{a week or}} {{more the}} {{stricken}} financier confined himself mostly to his rooms, where he sat smoking cigarettes, gazing at Japanese prints, <b>and</b> <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> to think about [...] "props" [...] and [...] "rehl." [...] Then, gradually, the almost maternal yearning to see his brain-child once more, which can never be wholly crushed out of a young dramatist, returned to him--faintly at first, then getting stronger by degrees till it could no longer be resisted. Otis Pilkington, having instructed his Japanese valet to pack a few simple necessaries in a suit-case, took a cab to the Grand Central Station and caught an afternoon train for Rochester, where his recollection of the route planned for the tour told him [...] "The Rose of America" [...] would now be playing.|$|E
50|$|Ray {{initially}} {{agrees to}} keep Shiloh until he recovers, <b>and</b> <b>tries</b> <b>not</b> to grow attached to Shiloh. That night, when Ray thinks Marty is asleep {{he gives the}} dog a treat, and soon his heart softens toward granting Marty's wish.|$|R

6000|$|Directly the gunboat {{had been}} made out {{emerging}} from her ambush, Schultz, of the fascinating voice, had given signs of strange agitation. All that day, ever since leaving the Malay town up the river, he had shown a haggard face, going about his duties {{like a man with}} something weighing on his mind. Jasper had noticed it, but the mate, turning away, as though he had not liked being looked at, had muttered shamefacedly of a headache and a touch of fever. He must have had it very badly when, dodging behind his captain he wondered aloud: [...] "What can that fellow want with us?" [...] . A naked man standing in a freezing blast <b>and</b> <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> to shiver could not have spoken with a more harshly uncertain intonation. But it might have been fever--a cold fit.|$|E
60|$|The girls {{seemed in}} great spirits, {{particularly}} {{after they were}} joined by a short gentleman with such a young face that Polly would have called him a boy, if he had not worn a tall beaver. Escorted by this impressive youth, Fanny left her unfortunate friends to return to school, and went to walk, as she called a slow promenade down the most crowded streets. Polly discreetly fell behind, and amused herself looking into shop-windows, till Fanny, mindful of her manners, even at such an interesting time, took her into a picture gallery, and bade her enjoy the works of art while they rested. Obedient Polly went through the room several times, apparently examining the pictures with the interest of a connoisseur, <b>and</b> <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> to hear the mild prattle of the pair on the round seat. But she could n't help wondering what Fan found so absorbing in an account of a recent German, and why she need promise so solemnly not to forget the concert that afternoon.|$|E
6000|$|Biography and {{exploration}} were her favourite reading, for choice {{the biography of}} {{men who had been}} good to their mothers, and she liked the explorers to be alive so that she could shudder at the thought of their venturing forth again; but though she expressed a hope that they would have the sense to stay at home henceforth, she gleamed with admiration when they disappointed her. In later days I had a friend who was an African explorer, and she was in two minds about him; {{he was one of the}} most engrossing of mortals to her, she admired him prodigiously, pictured him at the head of his caravan, now attacked by savages, now by wild beasts, and adored him for the uneasy hours he gave her, but she was also afraid that he wanted to take me with him, and then she thought he should be put down by law. Explorers’ mothers also interested her very much; the books might tell her nothing about them, but she could create them for herself and wring her hands in sympathy with them when they had got no news of him for six months. Yet there were times when she grudged him to them—as the day when he returned victorious. Then what was before her eyes was not the son coming marching home again but an old woman peering for him round the window curtain <b>and</b> <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> to look uplifted. The newspaper reports would be about the son, but my mother’s comment was ‘She’s a proud woman this night.’ ...|$|E
60|$|The weary hours roll on. Too {{tired to}} stand longer, {{he sits down}} on the shafts of a cart, <b>and</b> <b>tries</b> <b>not</b> to think. It is not difficult. Body and mind are alike worn out, and his brain seems filled with uniform dull mist.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I think,' added Lady Merrifield, with a smile, 'that Dolores {{has been}} in the way of seeing more clever people, and getting {{superior}} teaching of some kind, but we will {{do the best we can}} for her, <b>and</b> <b>try</b> <b>not</b> to let her miss many advantages.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All luck to you, King Tom," [...] {{he heard}} her say in the {{darkness}} in which he seemed now to perceive the gleam of her hair. [...] "I will take my chance. <b>And</b> <b>try</b> <b>not</b> to come near me again for I am weary of you." ...|$|R
