5|$|The Witches, 2013, by Martin Wallace, {{published}} by Treefrog Games. This {{is a game}} aimed at younger or more family oriented players. They must move around the town of Lancre and its surrounds, dealing with 'problems' ranging from <b>a</b> <b>sick</b> pig, to an invasion by vampires. Each player has a one-use special power. It is a semi-cooperative game, in that all players can lose if the game wins, but if they resolve all the problems, then {{one of them will}} win.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe aim of {{the present}} study is to {{investigate}} the relationship between health behavior and general health status. MethodsWe used data from the 2011 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Mental health was measured by stress recognition and depression. Dietary habit was measured by mixed grain diet. Life pattern was measured by sleeping time and working pattern. Physical activity was measured by walking and exercise. We defined general health status as Euro Quality of Life- 5 Dimension (EQ- 5 Dindex), Euro Quality of Life Visual Analogue Scale (EQ- 5 Dvas), number of people experienced lying in <b>a</b> <b>sickbed</b> for the last one month, number of days lying in <b>a</b> <b>sickbed</b> for the last one month, and activity limitations. ResultsMental health, dietary habit, life pattern, and physical activity have seven factors. Most of the factors have a significant correlation with EQ- 5 Dindex, EQ- 5 Dvas, number of people experienced lying in <b>a</b> <b>sickbed</b> for the last one month, number of days lying in <b>a</b> <b>sickbed</b> for the last one month, and activity limitations. ConclusionHealth behavior and general health status have a positive correlation...|$|R

5|$|A notable {{incident}} that occurred was {{the assassination of}} Lord Mayo, the Viceroy of India who had visited the islands on an inspection tour.

5|$|During his {{childhood}} Downey had minor roles in his father's films. He made his acting debut {{at the age}} of five, playing <b>a</b> <b>sick</b> puppy in the absurdist comedy Pound (1970), and then at seven appeared in the surrealist Greaser's Palace (1972). At the age of ten, he was living in England and studied classical ballet {{as part of a larger}} curriculum. He attended the Stagedoor Manor Performing Arts Training Center in upstate New York as a teenager. When his parents divorced in 1978, Downey moved to California with his father, but in 1982 he dropped out of Santa Monica High School and moved back to New York to pursue an acting career full-time.|$|E

5|$|In some legends, Marko's wonder {{horse was}} a gift from a vila. A Serbian story says that {{he was looking for a}} horse who could bear him.

He bought (and cured) the foal, naming him Šarac. He became an {{enormously}} powerful horse and Marko's inseparable companion.

Principe met McIlrath in Indianapolis while attending <b>a</b> <b>Sick</b> of It All concert, and recalled seeing him perform with his previous band Baxter.

5|$|The {{original}} {{insurance system}} devised by McGivney gave a deceased Knight's widow a $1,000 death benefit. Each member was assessed $1 upon a death, {{and when the}} number of Knights grew beyond 1,000, the assessment decreased according to the rate of increase. Each member, regardless of age, was assessed equally. As a result, younger, healthier members could expect to pay more over the course of their lifetimes than those men who joined when they were older. There was also <b>a</b> <b>Sick</b> Benefit Deposit for members who fell ill and could not work. Each sick Knight was entitled to draw up to $5 a week for 13 weeks (roughly equivalent to $125.75 in 2009 dollars). If he remained sick after that, the council to which he belonged determined the sum of money given to him.|$|E

5|$|Highly gregarious, western jackdaws are {{generally}} seen in flocks of varying sizes, though {{males and females}} pair-bond for life and pairs stay together within flocks. Flocks increase in size in autumn and birds congregate at dusk for communal roosting, with up to several thousand individuals gathering at one site. At Uppsala, Sweden, 40,000 birds have been recorded at a single winter roost with mated pairs often settling together for the night. Western jackdaws frequently congregate with hooded crows or rooks, the latter particularly when migrating or roosting. They have been recorded foraging with the common starling (Sturnus vulgaris), Northern lapwing (Vanellus vanellus), and common gull (Larus canus) in northwestern England. Flocks are targets of coordinated hunting by pairs of lanner falcons (Falco biarmicus), although larger groups are more able to elude the predators. Western jackdaws sometimes mob and drive off larger birds such as European magpies, common ravens, or Egyptian vultures (Neophron percnopterus); one gives an alarm call which alerts its conspecifics to gather and attack as a group. Occasionally, <b>a</b> <b>sick</b> or injured western jackdaw is mobbed until it is killed.|$|E

5|$|Magical healing spells, {{which were}} used by Egyptians of all classes, are the source for an {{important}} portion of the myth, in which Horus is poisoned or otherwise sickened, and Isis heals him. The spells identify <b>a</b> <b>sick</b> person with Horus so {{that he or she}} can benefit from the goddess's efforts. The spells are known from papyrus copies, which serve as instructions for healing rituals, and from a specialized type of inscribed stone stela called a cippus. People seeking healing poured water over these cippi, an act that was believed to imbue the water with the healing power contained in the text, and then drank the water in hope of curing their ailments. The theme of an endangered child protected by magic also appears on inscribed ritual wands from the Middle Kingdom, which were made centuries before the more detailed healing spells that specifically connect this theme with the Osiris myth.|$|E
5|$|Orr {{was born}} in the town of Parry Sound on the shores of Georgian Bay in Ontario, Canada. His grandfather, Robert Orr, was a top-tier soccer pro player who emigrated from Ballymena, Northern Ireland to Parry Sound early in the 20th century. Orr's father, Doug Orr, had once been a hockey {{prospect}} and was invited to join the Atlantic City Seagulls in 1942 but turned down the offer. Doug Orr instead joined the Royal Canadian Navy, serving during the Second World War. He returned after the war to Parry Sound and Arva Steele, whom he had married before he left for war, and to a job in the CIL dynamite factory. Doug and Arva had five children together: Patricia, Ronnie, Bobby, Penny and Doug Jr. Bobby was born on March 20, 1948 at St. Joseph's Hospital, where his grandmother Elsie Orr was a nurse. Bobby was <b>a</b> <b>sick</b> baby at birth and his survival was tenuous.|$|E
