500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} is about a desire to view people as God would, and was [...] "inspired by people-watching at an airport". Heath has said, [...] " [...] a song <b>about</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> {{convictions}} for wanting {{to see the world}} with compassionate eyes." ...|$|E
500|$|Many of the album's {{lyrics are}} {{narrative}} and diaristic in nature, and were heavily drawn from Love's {{personal life and}} experiences in her teenage and young adult years. In a press release promoting the album, Love said: [...] "These songs are <b>about</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> weaknesses and impurities; things about myself that I hate... paranoias, petty concerns, and pithy, pathetic things that are inside of me." [...] The songs are often lyrically abstract and describe shocking scenes of violence, and, particularly, violence against women. Prominent themes discussed in the lyrics include elitism, beauty and self-image, abortion, prostitution, suicide, murder, [...] "red lights", and self-destructiveness. Q Magazine described the lyrics on the record as [...] "confrontational" [...] and [...] "genuinely uninhibited." ...|$|E

500|$|When Heseltine {{returned}} to London {{at the end}} of August 1918 he sent seven of his new songs to Rogers for publication. Because of the recent contretemps over van Dieren, Heseltine submitted these pieces as [...] "Peter Warlock". They were published under this pseudonym, which he thereafter adopted for all his subsequent musical output, reserving his own name for critical and analytical writings. At around this time the composer Charles Wilfred Orr recalled Heseltine as [...] "a tall fair youth of <b>about</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> age", trying without success to convince a sceptical Delius of the merits of van Dieren's piano works. Orr was particularly struck by Heseltine's whistling abilities which he describes as [...] "flute-like in quality and purity".|$|E
500|$|David Sims of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode an A, {{calling it a}} [...] "classic" [...] and writing that it [...] "is so damn clever in how it bonds Jerry's fears about social niceties with larger fears about mortality"; he also praised Louis-Dreyfus's acting, saying that Elaine [...] "has an amusingly stark little bit of {{dialogue}} about death midway through the episode: [...] "You know, funerals always make me think <b>about</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> mortality and how I'm actually going to die someday. Me, dead. Imagine that!" [...] I think it's probably Louis-Dreyfus' best moment of the show so far, because she's really starting to nail Elaine's declarative, vaguely imperious, self-centered tone." [...] He also admired [...] "the estimable Barney Martin in his first appearance as Jerry's irascible dad." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{first song}} she wrote was [...] "Objection (Tango)" [...] {{and in an}} {{interview}} with Faze, she revealed that writing songs in English proved to be challenging for her: [...] "I prayed and asked God to send me a good song today, and I remember I started writing the song [...] a couple of hours after. I wrote the music and lyrics at the same time, and when that happens it's really magical to me." [...] After completing [...] "Objection (Tango)", Shakira decided to write ten more songs and began setting up portable recording studios in the rural region of Uruguay. She wrote various songs with a [...] "dictionary {{in one hand and a}} thesaurus in the other." [...] During the songwriting process, Shakira wrote [...] "Underneath Your Clothes" [...] as a love song for de la Rúa. She explained that, [...] "If you check the subject of my songs, most of them talk <b>about</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> experiences and feelings and what I was actually going through in my life." ...|$|E
5000|$|Dances, Pt. 2" [...] is the anthem of {{the soul}} in solitary confinement. It's a feeling like a feeling in jail. The face that I sing <b>about</b> is <b>my</b> <b>own.</b> I wrote the lyrics while I was looking in a mirror! ...|$|R

2500|$|Oral {{subjects}} proved {{unwilling to}} analyze themselves. When asked [...] "what {{sort of person}} are you?"

I myself can’t say anything." ...|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Corgan {{was also}} {{going through his}} own problems. He would admit in 2011 that {{throughout}} the recording process he had been planning his own suicide. Stating that he had gotten rid of most of his things and was [...] "fantasising <b>about</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> death, I started thinking what my funeral would be like and what music would be played" ...|$|E
2500|$|Entertainment Weekly {{gave the}} DVD a [...] "B+" [...] rating and wrote, [...] "While you may enjoy {{watching}} My Own Private Idaho, whether {{you choose to}} view this two-disc Criterion edition in its entirety {{depends on how much}} you enjoy watching people talking <b>about</b> <b>My</b> <b>Own</b> Private Idaho", and concluded, [...] "But with all the various interpretations and influences, this is definitely a film worth talking about".|$|E

I refer you, sir, to the History for examination.|$|R
2500|$|In a February 1977 interview, Cosier {{admitted}} [...] "I've got doubts <b>about</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> ability. I'm {{not convinced}} I"m a test batsman yet. I've {{got a long}} way to go... At the moment I'm playing one good innings and then three bad ones. I don't know why. Maybe I need to relax myself more of perhaps it's got something to do with attitude. All I know is I'm trying to work on it... I've heard about the things they say about me outside the off stump and to an extent I go along with them... I admit I'm a bit overweight." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "This {{does not}} reduce history to {{something}} arbitrary or capricious. It remains genuine knowledge. How can this be, if my thoughts about Julius Caesar differ from Mommsen's? Must {{not one of}} us be wrong? No, because the object differs. My historical [...] is <b>about</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> past, not about Mommsen's past. Mommsen and I share in a great many things, and in many respects we share in a common past; but in so far as we are different people and representatives of different cultures and different generations we have different pasts. ... ur views of Julius Caesar must differ, slightly perhaps, but perceptibly. This difference is not arbitrary, for I can see—or {{ought to be able to}} see—that in his place, apart (once more) from all questions of error, I should have come to his conclusions." ...|$|E
2500|$|Soros {{has been}} accused of saying that both Jews and Israel are {{partially}} responsible for antisemitism, in response to his statement that the administrations of G.W. Bush in the U.S. and Ariel Sharon in Israel were stoking antisemitism. He has also said that Jews can't overcome antisemitism without [...] "giv up on the tribalness." [...] On November 5, 2003, at a Jewish forum in New York City, Soros partially attributed a recent resurgence of antisemitism to the policies of Israel and the United States, and the role of wealthy and influential individuals:There is a resurgence of anti-Semitism in Europe. The policies of the Bush administration and the Sharon administration contribute to that. It's not specifically anti-Semitism, but it does manifest itself in anti-Semitism as well. I'm critical of those policies... If we change that direction, then anti-Semitism also will diminish. I can't see how one could confront it directly... I'm also very concerned <b>about</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> role because the new anti-Semitism holds that the Jews rule the world... As an unintended consequence of my actions... I also contribute to that image.|$|E

2500|$|During the {{sessions}} for [...] "Sunday Bloody Sunday", Lillywhite encouraged drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. {{to use a}} click track, but Mullen was firmly against the idea. [...] A chance meeting with Andy Newmark (of Sly & the Family Stone) – a drummer who used a click track religiously – changed Mullen's mind. [...] Mullen used the click track to stay in time for other songs on the album. Mullen said of the album in a 1983 interview, [...] "I think the drumming has always been pretty simple, I don't think {{it needs to be}} flashy. For War I use a click track, something I haven't used before, it's a way of keeping time in my headphones. When I listened to the music in time with the click track I knew I had to bring it down to the real basics. Hopefully for the next LP it will be more complicated, I'll move on. I {{think of it as a}} musical progression for myself because I learned a lot recording this album, just <b>about</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> style and that's what I wanted to do. I think there is a definite style on War where there isn't on the previous albums." ...|$|E
2500|$|They {{have three}} adult children: {{two daughters and}} a son. His elder daughter, Seon-yong, was born in 1972 and now works for the Korea Foundation in Seoul. Her spouse {{is a native of}} India. His son Woo-hyun was born in 1974 in India. He {{received}} an MBA from Anderson School of Management at University of California, Los Angeles, and works for an investment firm in New York. His younger daughter, Hyun-hee (born 1976), is a field officer for UNICEF in Nairobi. After his election as Secretary-General, Ban became an icon in his hometown, where his extended family still resides. Over 50,000 gathered in a soccer stadium in Chungju for celebration of the result. In the months following his election, thousands of practitioners of geomancy went to his village to determine how it produced such an important person. Ban himself is not a member of any church or religious group and has declined to expound his beliefs: [...] "Now, as Secretary-General, it will not be appropriate at this time to talk <b>about</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> belief in any particular religion or god. So maybe we will have some other time to talk about personal matters." [...] His mother is Buddhist.|$|E
2500|$|McKee {{continued}} {{working on}} the song the following days. She explained, [...] "I thought <b>about</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> adolescent years, my own first love. I thought about watching Baz Luhrmann's 'Romeo and Juliet' and putting on a little mini disco ball light and just dreaming of Leo. I thought about me and my friends sitting around at slumber parties in the 90's, giddy even just THINKING about boys..... I thought about what Benny said and I listened to the song again, and I was like The Teenagers..... that's such a great word, Teenager. It is a very descriptive word; it packs a lot of emotion and imagery into three syllables..... I couldn't believe after all of our agonizing over 'youth' themes, that we had overlooked such an obvious one – the teenage condition." [...] The following week, Perry invited McKee, Luke, and Martin to write at her hometown of Santa Barbara, California. McKee tried to approach Luke about her idea, but he was upset {{about the amount of}} time he had spent working in the chorus, so he banned them from changing it. They started {{working on the}} verses, where Perry had already prepared most of the imagery.|$|E

2500|$|The {{isolation}} and boredom of Casanova's last years {{enabled him to}} focus without distractions on his Histoire de ma vie, without which his fame would have been considerably diminished, if not blotted out entirely. He {{began to think about}} writing his memoirs around 1780 and began in earnest by 1789, as [...] "the only remedy to keep from going mad or dying of grief". The first draft was completed by July 1792, and he spent the next six years revising it. He puts a happy face on his days of loneliness, writing in his work, [...] "I can find no pleasanter pastime than to converse with myself <b>about</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> affairs and to provide a most worthy subject for laughter to my well-bred audience." [...] His memoirs were still being compiled {{at the time of his}} death, his account having reached only the summer of 1774. A letter by him in 1792 states that he was reconsidering his decision to publish them, believing that his story was despicable and he would make enemies by writing the truth about his affairs. But he decided to proceed, using initials instead of actual names and toning down the strongest passages. He wrote in French instead of Italian because [...] "the French language is more widely known than mine".|$|E
2500|$|On a few occasions, Obama has {{joked about}} the {{conspiracy}} theories surrounding his birth certificate and citizenship. At the 2010 White House Correspondents' Dinner, Obama {{said there are}} few things in life harder to find and more important to keep than love, and then added, [...] "Well, love and a birth certificate." [...] At the 2011 Gridiron Dinner, Obama referred to Bruce Springsteen's song, [...] "Born in the U.S.A.", and commented, [...] "Some things just bear repeating." [...] On March 17, 2011 (Saint Patrick's Day), Obama said, [...] "Now, speaking of ancestry, {{there has been some}} controversy <b>about</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> background. Two years into my presidency, some are still bent on peddling rumors about my origins. So today, I want to put all those rumors to rest. It is true my great-great-great-grandfather really was from Ireland. It’s true. Moneygall, to be precise. I can’t believe I have to keep pointing this out." [...] On January 17, 2012, during a televised tribute to actress Betty White on her 90th birthday, Obama taped a segment in which he wrote White a letter saying that, given her appearance and vitality, he not only could not believe she was 90, he did not believe her, and requested to see her birth certificate.|$|E
2500|$|While {{promoting}} Keep Your Head Down, Yunho and Changmin {{spoke up}} for the first time about their 2010 hiatus and breakup with JYJ. According to Yunho, JYJ had [...] "exceedingly deep conflicts" [...] with their agency and the members had irreconcilable differences about their career. Changmin added that the team had worked so hard {{to the point where they}} felt like they could finally [...] "harvest the fruits of [...] labor", yet instead of being happy they had to perform their final stage with heavy hearts. JYJ responded by saying that they did not regret their decision in leaving S.M. Entertainment. The lyrics of [...] "Keep Your Head Down" [...] also came under media scrutiny, with claims that they were directed at JYJ; however, TVXQ clarified that [...] "Keep Your Head Down" [...] was not a diss track, and that similar claims would still happen even if they were to release a different song with different lyrics. Yunho said, [...] "The song is about a man's mind towards a woman who had left him. We can sometimes find out that a certain song seems to talk <b>about</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> story. In this way it totally depends on the interpretation using our own thoughts." ...|$|E
