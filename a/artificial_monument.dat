5000|$|Monuments are {{categorized}} {{into two}} groups which are known as natural and artificial. Natural monuments are things such as trees, large stones, and other substantial, naturally occurring objects that were in place before the survey was made. An <b>artificial</b> <b>monument</b> is anything within the regulations which marks the property boundary [...] - [...] having been placed by landowners, surveyors, engineers, or others. They may {{be referred to as}} iron pins or pipes, stakes, trees, concrete monuments, or whatever the surveyor decides to use at the time, within the regulations for the area. The courts have held that natural monuments take precedence over artificial monuments, because they are more certain in identification and less likely to be disturbed.|$|E
50|$|Some {{courts have}} {{established}} a list of priorities to resolve inconsistent descriptions of corners. In descending order starting with the most reliable: (1) natural <b>monuments,</b> (2) <b>artificial</b> <b>monuments</b> such as roads and marked or surveyed lines, (3) adjacent tracts or boundaries, (4) courses or directions, (5) distances, and (6) area or quantity.|$|R

Jan Pohunek Abstract: This thesis discusses contemporary folklore interpretations of meanings of abandoned and decaying buildings {{and other types}} of <b>artificial</b> immovable <b>monuments.</b> Mutual relations between these interpretations and modes of place usage are also being observed. The research is based on ethnographic survey focused on Czech republic and including primarily interviews with various respondents and crtitical analysis of written, electronic and audiovisual resources. Aside from general part of the research, several sites were chosen as a more in-depth example of formation of meanings belonging to an archaeologizing place, a complex proces influenced by the history of the site, its physical appearance and other attributes. An attached catalogue includes collected contemporary legends related to abandoned places and a system of categorization of their motifs is offered. This collection is further discussed, especially with regard to ways how character of a location and activities that take place here influence appearance of various motifs. In general, {{it can be said that}} different abandoned places are also perceived differently and there are groups of motifs that are more characteristic for certain categories of places [...] . ...|$|R
40|$|When I {{was young}} I {{was obsessed with}} {{collecting}} photos my family had because I knew that the moment wouldn’t last forever, if we didn’t have those photos we would be left with nothing to hold onto. After time has passed, I look back at these photographs and notice nothing is always how I remember it, yet I do not wish the images to be anything else. It is this change am confronting. It is the distortion of both the image and memory that I am confronting. I {{have always been a}} bit of a control freak. I want to maintain my family. I want to keep us together. My grandmother once told me she wondered {{what would happen to the}} family after she and Joe Joe passed; I wonder/ed that too. They were the glue that held us together. How would we still be connected? I took this on as a personal responsibility, to maintain our connection, which why I have saves materials and images of us, in order to preserve our memories. There is no clear way to preserve the past, and because of this a layer of separation forms when the memories are no longer the same. Documentation photography tries to control how you view something. It makes an effort to show the truth of a moment/memory, but in its efforts to do so, it too, is confronted with change. Time doesn’t wait for any of us; it always changes the way you look at something, or the way it looks. Because time distorts both the physical image and the imagery within our mind this layer of separation forms again, between reality and the imagery, and thus creates a feeling of dissociation. This is what I am interested in, the layer of separation one feels from a memory after time takes its course. I show this by rephotographing photographs to amplify the reprocessing that occurs in our minds, and that also occurs in the distortion of an image. In my sculpture I also show this reproduction of memory by repurposing both personal and universal symbols/materials like: dryer lint, birthday cakes, fabric, headstones, flowers, etc. I have a connection to all of the materials I use, but they are such familiar objects that people can connect with them as well. With these symbols/materials I create <b>artificial</b> <b>monuments</b> that stand in for the image home. By making these artificial stand ins for the home I’m eluding back to the separation that forms around a memory over time. How I create this artificial look is by distorting the functionality of the symbols/materials used in the sculpture. I also use video or sound to help amplify the distortion of the piece. An artist who I’ve been looking at recently is Jennifer Loeber, specifically her project “Left Behind” which she paired old photographs of her mom, who recently passed, with photographs of items of hers she kept. There is the presence of time as the two photographs differ in look. The way she uses saved materials and photographs to talk about a loss of a loved one is what started me to think about the connection between the two...|$|R

Living <b>monuments</b> on the other hand permits its citizens to live a contemporary life style while conserving and maintaining the physical fabric of the city and environment. To minimize the extra burden of maintenance and not to create dead spaces in a city the conservationists have identified the reuse of conserved spaces and monuments. The prime aim of this is to keep the monuments in use while proclaiming its significance to society. Yet the human mutilation and the enforcement of conservation policies, regulations have failed to proclaim the heritage cities of its "living" significance and is a recurring *dilemma in conservation and reuse of monuments. It is the human participation which makes the physical context alive. For to keep a city as a living monument this dilemmatic situation has to be resolved. It is needed to facilitate the citizens to fulfill their spatial needs out of their environment. Negligence of this has caused degradation of city life in conserved cities. The study notes, the need to develop an approach that is more responsive to the living patterns. The capacity of Urban space to support dwelling that is reflected in place making is to be reinforced. Having faced this current problem of degradation of city life the heritage city of Galle -Fort is to be protected in order to facilitate it as a living monument...|$|R
