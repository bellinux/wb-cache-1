40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) -specific monoclonal antibodies with extraordinary potency and breadth {{have recently been}} described. In humanized mice, combinations of monoclonal antibodies {{have been shown to}} suppress viraemia, but the therapeutic potential of these monoclonal antibodies has not yet been evaluated in primates with an intact immune system. Here we show that administration of a cocktail of HIV- 1 -specific monoclonal antibodies, as well as the single glycan-dependent monoclonal antibody PGT 121, resulted in a rapid and precipitous decline of plasma viraemia to undetectable levels in rhesus monkeys chronically infected with the pathogenic simian–human {{immunodeficiency virus}} SHIV-SF 162 P 3. A single monoclonal antibody infusion afforded up to a 3. 1 log decline of plasma viral RNA in 7 [*]days and also reduced proviral DNA in peripheral blood, gastrointestinal mucosa and lymph nodes without the development of viral resistance. Moreover, after monoclonal antibody <b>administration,</b> <b>host</b> Gag-specific T-lymphocyte responses showed improved functionality. Virus rebounded in most animals after a median of 56 [*]days when serum monoclonal antibody titres had declined to undetectable levels, although, notably, a subset of animals maintained long-term virological control in the absence of further monoclonal antibody infusions. These data demonstrate a profound therapeutic effect of potent neutralizing HIV- 1 -specific monoclonal antibodies in SHIV-infected rhesus monkeys as well as an impact on host immune responses. Our findings strongly encourage the investigation of monoclonal antibody therapy for HIV- 1 in humans. National Institutes of Health (U. S.) (AI 055332) National Institutes of Health (U. S.)

50|$|The Interagency Resources Management Conference (TIRMCO) was {{a federal}} {{executive}} {{conference of the}} General Services <b>Administration,</b> <b>hosting</b> about 300 federal and industry leaders each year. The Interagency Resources Management Conference began in 1961 as the ADPCO conference. In 1979, the Department of Commerce, GSA and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) jointly sponsored a conference for Senior Executive Service (SES) officials at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. At the same time, the National Archives hosted a small records management conference for senior executives, also located in Gettysburg. These two conferences merged with ADPCO and became The Interagency Resources Management Conference. Over the years, the conference has evolved its focus from highly specialized to integrated. In 1996, when U.S. Congress mandated the role of Chief Information Officer (CIO), these new federal executives were invited to attend The Interagency Resources Management Conference.|$|R

Innovation is discussed as the heart of entrepreneurial processes occurring in today's capitalist economic systems, including transition economies like China and Vietnam, which underscores economic competitiveness of firms and economies. But the innovation effort and process also face dilemma of "entrepreneurial curse of innovation". Advantages and disadvantages are weighed for a more balanced view, especially {{in the context of}} outnumbering SMEs and given existence of pitfalls and traps along the innovation path of development. Toward the end, the value of the market is once again stressed amid the concern of subjective assumption and illusion about availability of market opportunities in the mind of innovators, which may contrast totally with the dismal outcome the actual market realities may show ex post. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

50|$|Aquino's {{government}} was mired by coup attempts, high inflation and unemployment, and natural calamities, but introduced land reform and market liberalization.

As the 1992 election grew closer, Aquino declined to run even though she could do so, and instead supported Ramon Mitra; she later backtracked and threw her support to Fidel V. Ramos, who later won albeit under controversial circumstances. Ramos had to face an ongoing energy crisis which had started during the Aquino administration which was resolved when Ramos issued contracts favorable to power producers. The Ramos <b>administration</b> <b>hosted</b> the 1996 APEC summit, reinstated the death penalty, signed a peace agreement with the Moro National Liberation Front, and bore {{the brunt of the}} 1997 Asian financial crisis. He wanted to amend the constitution, but Aquino and other sectors opposed the measure and backed off. Ramos' vice president Joseph Estrada defeated the former's partymate Jose de Venecia and several others in the 1998 election in a comfortable margin; meanwhile de Venecia's running mate Gloria Macapagal Arroyo was elected vice president.|$|R
