My mail is so screwed up yet that I cannot determine which method is more rapid, <b>air</b> <b>mail</b> or V-Mail. One of these days I should find out, however. I got a “kick” from your dislike of mustaches. Sweetheart, out here personal vanity doesn’t mean a thing. Should I retain the mustache by the time I come home, I shall allow you to march me {{to the bathroom and}} watch me “whack” it off. It shall be a pleasure on my part. It’s so good that you are being kept constantly occupied. Darling, you can fiddle away time just like me—an old family trait. There are times when I put aside time to do a particular thing but I’ll be doggone if the time doesn’t pass without my doing what I wanted to do. Your article concerning Jap-American relations reflects in a small part some of the racial problems which will manifest themselves greatly after the war. I pity those people—it is not their fault. Thus far, darling, I have not received the camera but remain on the constant lookout for it. Tell me, too, if you received the money order and the box containing film and sundry items. Darling, I don’t ever want you to feel morbid. Promise me that you’ll always try and be as cheerful as possible—O. K. ? Before I forget, send me a box of stationery, will you, dear? It’s a critical item around here and very difficult to procure. V-Mail stationery is issued and we can get as much as we want. You say you sent me a cablegram on the 2 nd of November. To date I have not received your cablegram. They are pretty useless when you send them to me, but are quite good when I send them to you. I’m glad to hear that you enjoy Lt. Embry’s company as her husband is a “purty” regular guy and very much in love with his wife. A quality that we both have in common. “Winkie” Luddecke sent Doc a picture of their baby and herself. Gee, but I’m jealous, but don’t you worry, my precious, we’ll have our day, too. And what a day that will be!!! We’re getting along O. K. in the battery and having our good times as they present themselves. It’s a funny situation hearing all these broadcasts of the latest news with towns mentioned that are within [a] stone’s throw of you. Imagine it, darling, I’m in an outfit that’s making history. As soon as censorship lifts you’ll be hearing all about us in detail. I love you, my baby, Vic [Transcription ends...|$|R

The children were very happy to see their father and I imagine he was happy to see them. His wife told him that the soldiers burned a lot of coal that they had stored up in the basement. I replied “When you come to visit us in the United States, you can burn as much of our coal as you lie. ” All these people seem abashed at the good treatment the Americans give the Nazis [sic] prisoners. I told them it was because we are still an ultra-humane people and will take our retributions later. Darling, I’m glad that you and Miss Ingram “hit it off. ” It makes it so much more pleasant to work with an assistant who is cooperative and cheerful. I’m sorry to hear that Ukie was ill and I sincerely hope that she is well at this time. By the way, I haven’t heard from Mother and Dad for a while. Dad is excused—he just doesn’t write but I’m a little bit disappointed in mother. I really like to hear from her and she writes excellent letters. You know, sweetheart, {{there was a time when}} I was indifferent to babies in the same way like I was indifferent to marriage, etc., but now I know that the reason I want babies is because I love you so intensly [sic] and our love has reached a point where it is capable of attaining new horizons. Do you know what I mean? No guesswork in our relationship whatsoever—our marriage has a foundation of solid granite and now we are ready to build upon that foundation. Eadie, Honey, ask Ukie to please let you have those letters in French that this Belgian woman wrote to her. I’d like to keep them among our memoirs if it’s O. K. with Ukie. Don’t you worry your little head about that 25 bond for September. I understand all the bonds were cancelled as of Aug. 31 and my new one didn’t go into effect until Oct. 1. I’ll check up anyways [sic] and see if the above is correct, sweets. I’m glad to see that you’re corresponding with the other wives. Yes, I agree with you Karla is a nice name. According to [D]oc, they wanted a girl for the first one but he was ready to accept a boy, too. [?], please take care of your health and see that you get sufficient recreation. Every month or so take a visit to a friend in another city (if rail facilities permit and you’re not denying a soldier a place on the train). I’ve read and re-read the poem that Alma 2 ̆ 6 Harold sent you entitled “GI [?]” and feel that the poet has “hit the nail on the head” when he expresses himself and the feelings of the American soldier thusly: “Although on my violent hands is blood In my mind is a garden of beauty. ” I think you have gathered the same theme in my letters when you find me speaking vehemently about the Nazis and in the next breath extolling the charm of Mimi and Joseph (the Belgian kids). The American soldier has not lost his perspective and will not present any psychological problem when he returns home to his loved one. I admit there may be some exceptions, but I am speaking for the majority. Darling, you won’t have any problem, I assure you. This morning we had a brief glimpse of snow flurries but they did not stay with us very long. Tell me, dear, has Sanford spoken to you about any prospects of marriage? I’m speaking like my [?] Goldberg now, but seriously, I wish he found [sic] a swell wife like I have and got [sic] himself married. Do you ever hear about the rest of the Goldbergs? (I mean from a casual source.) Bubsie, doll, I’ll close this letter by kissing your nose, your eyes, and... O. K. if you want me to—a real passionate kiss on your lips. Forever, Vic [Transcription ends...|$|E
40|$|Transcription begins] 18 December, 1944 Somewheres [sic] in Germany My darling, Today I {{received}} your <b>air</b> <b>mail</b> <b>letter</b> {{written the}} 8 [th of] Dec. Sweetheart, I’m afraid you’re working too hard! Please darling, {{take care of}} yourself and above all watch your health. If I’m willing to take care of myself the least you can do is {{take care of yourself}}. Believe it or not, but after I finished reading your letters, I, too, felt exhausted. I suppose it’s because I feel and experience each and every emotion that is yours. After reading your letter I wanted to carry you tenderly to bed, put my arms around you and kiss your forehead, your temples, your eyes, your cute little nose, your neck, and then to be “mean,” plant a passionate kiss on your lips. Mmmm! I hate like “heck” to leave the previous subject but I suppose you would like to hear about other things, too. Darling, mail every 10 days isn’t bad at all. I only hope it continues that way. Don’t bother with the P. D. subscription if it takes {{as long as it does}} to reach me. Shelton is receiving papers from Abilene, Texas, dated 22 Sept. which are of little or no value at this late date. I received a notice from Coronet stating that I was to receive a copy but to date the magazine has failed to put in an appearance. I’ll get it one of these days, I suppose. Your sweetheart is becoming a real onion sandwich eater. I found an onion associate in the person of Doc so we have our daily onion sandwiches. He says they are very healthful and as long as we don’t have to create impressions around here, we are enjoying our sandwiches. Doc laughed when I told him that you ate onions too, whenever, I got into an onion eating mood so that I wouldn’t drive you out from bed with onion breath. Bubsie, don’t bother with the clippings from the 9 th Army. As long as you save the Stars 2 ̆ 6 Stripes we should have a pretty good account of it anyway. Ahem! So the boys have a “crush” on teacher? So would I if I were on of the boys! Don’t be so cruel to the boys—after all, they do appreciate charm and you can’t blame them for that, can you? I’m interested to learn how your Revue is progressing? When do you plan to put on your show? Darling, I love you madly and I’m happy in the thought that you feel the same way about me. Goodnight darling. “God” bless you, my dear. Vic [Transcription ends...|$|E
