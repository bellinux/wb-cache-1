The permeability class and efflux potential were ascertained by comparing test drug results with standard compounds (metoprolol, atenolol, labetalol, and rhodamine- 123).

Using intratracheal instillation of liposome-encapsulated clodronate to deplete AM of rat lungs, we studied the pulmonary absorption of hGH in AM-depleted versus normal animals.

The focus of present study is to report bioavailability, pharmacokinetics, dose linearity and permeability of lumefantrine in rats. Methods A single dose of 10, 20 or 40 mg/kg of lumefantrine was given orally to male rats (N = 5 per dose level) to evaluate dose proportionality. In another study, a single intravenous bolus dose of lumefantrine was given to rats (N = 4) at 0. 5 mg/kg dose following administration through the lateral tail vein in order to obtain the <b>absolute</b> oral <b>bioavailability</b> and clearance parameters. Blood samples were drawn at predetermined intervals and the concentration of lumefantrine and its metabolite desbutyl-lumefantrine in plasma were determined by partially validated LC-MS/MS method. In-situ permeability study was carried in anaesthetized rats. The concentration of lumefantrine in permeability samples was determined using RP-HPLC. Results For nominal doses increasing in a 1 : 2 : 4 proportion, the C max and AUC 0 -∞ values increased in the proportions of 1 : 0. 6 : 1. 5 and 1 : 0. 8 : 1. 8, respectively. For lumefantrine nominal doses increasing in a 1 : 2 : 4 proportion, the C max and the AUC 0 -t values for desbutyl-lumefantrine increased in the proportions of 1 : 1. 45 : 2. 57 and 1 : 1. 08 : 1. 87, respectively. After intravenous administration the clearance (Cl) and volume of distribution (Vd) of lumefantrine in rats were 0. 03 (± 0. 02) L/h/kg and 2. 40 (± 0. 67) L/kg, respectively. <b>Absolute</b> oral <b>bioavailability</b> of lumefantrine across the tested doses ranged between 4. 97 % and 11. 98 %.

Their volume-surface diameters ranged from 1. 77 ± 0. 06 μm (DCH) to 3. 47 ± 0. 05 μm (MCD); the aerodynamic diameters were about 1. 1 μm and their drug content was about 30 %. In comparison with DCH, MCD enhanced the in vitro DFO permeation across lipophilic membranes, similarly as shown by ex vivo permeation studies across porcine nasal mucosa. Moreover, MCD were able to promote the DFO permeation across monolayers of PC 12 cells (neuron-like), but like DCH, it did not modify the DFO permeation pattern across Caco- 2 monolayers (epithelial-like).

The results, indicate that T- 2, has a low <b>absolute</b> oral <b>bioavailability</b> of 2. 17 +/- 1. 80 %. For T 2 -G, an absorbed fraction of the dose and <b>absolute</b> oral <b>bioavailability</b> of 10. 4 +/- 8. 7 % and 10. 1 +/- 8. 5 % were observed, respectively. This slight difference is caused by a minimal (and neglectable) presystemic hydrolysis of T 2 -G to T- 2, that is, 3. 49 +/- 1. 19 %. Although low, the absorbed fraction of T 2 -G is 5 times higher than that of T- 2. These differences in toxicokinetics parameters between T- 2 and T 2 -G clearly indicate the flaw in assuming equal bioavailability and/or toxicity of modified and free mycotoxins in current risk assessments...|$|R
