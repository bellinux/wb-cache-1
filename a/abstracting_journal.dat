He was Professor of Botany (1937-1955) and {{director}} of the Morris Arboretum (1939-1954) at the University of Pennsylvania, and previously taught at Washington University and Cornell. Following his retirement from Pennsylvania he was appointed Research Scholar of Botany at Indiana University. He helped found the <b>abstracting</b> <b>journal</b> Botanical Abstracts, and served as editor-in-chief of it and of its successor, Biological Abstracts. He served as vice-president and president of the Botanical Society of America and as vice-president of the American Philosophical Society, which awarded him its Franklin Medal in 1958.|$|E

They were abstracts of mostly magazine (journal) or conference articles, but books and patents were also included as well as unpublished [...] "deposited" [...] articles. The articles they abstracted included 66 different languages from 130 different countries of the world. [...] But a more recently (2012) these figures are reported to be 40 languages from 70 countries.The name of each <b>abstracting</b> <b>journal,</b> (which were published once every month (some every 2 months) begins with [...] "Referativny Zhurnal" [...] (Реферативный жупнал).

One could subscribe to just one of these 5 parts separately, or subscribe to all 5 parts bound together as a [...] "сводный том" [...] = [...] "combined volume". there are over 24 different [...] "combined volumes" [...] plus 41 more titles consisting of only one part (not combined into a combined volume) with a total of 235 parts altogether, issued monthly (or bi-monthly). The meaning of the term [...] "Referativny Zhurnal" [...] may mean abstracting journals in general, including pre-Soviet and non-Russian ones.

(Information Studies) Traditionally {{it is part}} of {{the library}} or {{information}} service to provide clients with access to current and relevant information through current awareness services. It is part of the information professional's task to apply new technology and necessary services to the advantage of the clients. The purpose of this study was to establish, by means of empirical research, the effectiveness of CoMIC - an <b>abstracting</b> <b>journal</b> service currently provided to the mining industry. Other institutions providing a similar <b>abstracting</b> <b>journal</b> service should be able to use this methodology as a basis when evaluating their own service. Both a literature survey (to gain basic information about current awareness services in general and more specifically abstracting journals) and a postal questionnaire (to establish clients' opinions about the CoMIC service) were used during the study. From the literature survey it was established that the use of an effective current awareness service holds a variety of advantages. There are however also a few problems associated with the provision of current awareness services. These problems are surpassable providing the necessary precautions are taken in time. The criteria to which abstracting journals are to adhere were established. The purpose of the questionnaire was to give clients the oportunity to express their personal views with regard to the CoMIC service. The most important information extrapolated from the questionnaire was that respondents were satisfied with most aspects of the service. Recommendations with regard to alleviating a few minor problems were provided. After an analysis of the research results, it was concluded that CoMIC should be classified as an effective <b>abstracting</b> <b>journal</b> service...|$|E

40|$|Introduction. /strong>. The invisibility of {{research}} on information needs from the East and Central Europe in the West suggested {{an exploration of the}} published research output from Lithuania and Russia from 1965 to 2003. Method. The data were collected from the <b>abstracting</b> <b>journal</b> Informatika- 59. The publications were retrieved from Lithuanian and Russian libraries or the Internet. Analysis. The texts and, in cases when full-texts were not available, the abstracts were used for qualitative analysis assessing the relevance, content, concepts used and their change over time. Comparison with the Western (English language or Anglo-American) literature was carried out. Results. /strong>. The development of the concept of information user needs in Russia and Lithuania is followed through several decades as well as the understanding of its origins, structure and typologies. The parallel concepts and similar ideas are traced in the Western information behaviour literature. A context of related research (reading studies and information literacy) is revealed. Conclusion.. Despite the isolation of two bodies {{of research}} (Western and East European) in the area of information needs the common development and similarities in the understanding of the basic concept of information need, its origin and structure as well as typologies are revealed. Basic differences lie in understanding the contexts of the formation of information needs, their influence and, consequently, attention to the roles of contexts in research. It also seems that the everyday, non-work related information needs are totally excluded from the horizons of Russian researchers...|$|E
