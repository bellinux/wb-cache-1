The poem is his <b>artistic</b> <b>creed,</b> it asks who would save the important and beautiful things in life even during times of crisis, if poets couldn't? ...|$|E
5000|$|... “Schilling has expounded his new ars poetica {{which he}} has {{followed}} since 2008 not only in practice but also in his writings, interviews, essays and articles concerning the Escapologist-project. His <b>artistic</b> <b>creed</b> is based on two principles: {{on the one hand}} it is to question traditional theatrical functions (spectator, actor, director, scriptwriter, space), on the other hand it sets a new goal, which is not primarily directed to the aesthetic role of the theatre, but more to its social role.” (Anikó Orosz) ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1965 Volkonsky founded {{an early}} music {{ensemble}}, [...] "Madrigal", with Davydova as its soloist. The ensemble has pioneered performance of Renaissance and Early Baroque vocal {{music in the}} USSR. After Volkonsky had emigrated to France in 1972, Davydova directed “Madrigal” until 1983 and again returned as the ensemble’s artistic director in 1992. During performances of the ensemble she often accompanied other soloists on a harpsichord. Davydova remained the follower {{and one of the}} principal keepers of Volkonsky's <b>artistic</b> <b>creed</b> in Russia.|$|E

40|$|Behind the eminently {{recognisable}} farrago of Dalian hallmarks {{which includes}} melting watches, flimsy crutches and lobster telephones there lurks a mercurial wit at once capricious and apocryphal, having frequently resisted appropriation or annexation to any <b>artistic</b> style or <b>creed.</b> It is the elusive wit of Salvador Dali {{which has made}} him a master of display and disguise and frequently confounded critics by perpetuating extravagant yet highly implausible claims and wilfully provocative viewpoints...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} how {{a number of}} artists, music producers and translators of song lyrics contributed in different ways to the musical style known as bossa nova in the United States, in the period between 1962 and 1974. The case studies it encompasses are motivated by the central question of how these creative individuals have understood, and subsequently represented, bossa nova [...] which is treated here as a cultural constellation including both sound and social connotations [...] {{as they tried to}} make it suitable for understanding, appreciation and consumption in U. S. contexts. Drawing on fields ranging from postcolonial studies, popular music studies and literary theory, the case studies discuss the considerations of these individual actors in this process of cultural translation in close detail. The first case study focuses on the production and packaging of bossa nova recordings by Verve Records, under the <b>artistic</b> direction of <b>Creed</b> Taylor, in the years 1962 - 1967. The second case study describes the engagement of U. S. jazz musicians with the style, and offers an analysis of Horace Silver's "Song for My Father," a jazz composition inspired by the encounters with bossa nova musicians in Rio de Janeiro. The final case study concentrates on the practice of translating bossa nova song lyrics for Anglophone audiences, and concludes, by way of culturally specific readings, that the English-language adaptation of Antônio Carlos Jobim's "Águas de março" ("Waters of March") was specifically written to appeal to non-Brazilian listeners. The case studies demonstrate that bossa nova should be seen as a discursive formation rather than a coherent tradition, and that considerations of recognizability, adaptability, comprehensibility and marketability eventually determined how the musical idiom and its meanings were transformed in the U. S...|$|R
5000|$|Scholars have {{suggested}} that the Mass in B minor belongs in the same category as The Art of Fugue, as a summation of Bach's deep lifelong involvement with musical tradition—in this case, with choral settings and theology. Bach scholar Christoph Wolff describes the work as representing [...] "a summary of his writing for voice, not only in its variety of styles, compositional devices, and range of sonorities, but also in its high level of technical polish... Bach's mighty setting preserved the musical and <b>artistic</b> <b>creed</b> of its creator for posterity." ...|$|E
5000|$|After Vaughan Williams's death, The Times {{summed up}} his legacy in a leading article: Historically his {{achievement}} was {{to cut the}} bonds that from the times of Handel and Mendelssohn had bound England hand and foot to the Continent. He found in the Elizabethans and folk-song {{the elements of a}} native English language that need no longer be spoken with a German accent, and from it he forged his own idiom. The emancipation he achieved thereby was so complete that the composers of succeeding generations like Walton and Britten had no longer need of the conscious nationalism which was Vaughan Williams's own <b>artistic</b> <b>creed.</b> There is now an English music which can make its distinctive contribution to the comity of nations.|$|E
50|$|In 1910 Ginner went to London, {{to serve}} on the Hanging Committee of the Allied Artists Association's third exhibition. Harold Gilman and Spencer Gore became his friends and persuaded him to settle in London. He lived at first in Battersea, but {{afterwards}} in Camden Town, where he was a neighbor of Gilman and Gore and regularly attended the Saturday afternoons at 19 Fitzroy Street, meeting Robert Bevan, John Nash, Albert Rothenstein, Christopher R. W. Nevinson, Jacob Epstein, Walter Bayes, Walter Sickert and Lucien Pissarro. In 1911, he {{became a member of the}} Camden Town Group; in 1913 of the London Group; in 1914 of the Cumberland Market Group. In 1914 in the New Age he spelt out the <b>artistic</b> <b>creed</b> known as New Realism. In the same year he showed jointly with Gilman at the Goupil Gallery.|$|E
5000|$|The ‘AndoDrom’ band {{travelled}} {{the world}} and was a regular participant in the most important international folk-festivals. 3 albums were made at that time: Kaj Phirel O Del (1995) Gypsy Life On The Road (1997) and Phari Mamo (1997). As a result, others discovered Mónika’s unusual, unique voice. She was cast for several international movies, theatres and plenty of other music productions asked her for collaboration. That is when she first experienced that her voice and the culture she represents have the ‘raison d'etre’ (the most important reason or purpose for someone or something's existence) when it is grabbed out of its traditionalist comfort-zone and is mixing with the culture of other countries, origins, and the impacts of present age ‘trends’.The mid-90’s pop-music culture has also most influenced her e.g. Björk, Massive Attack or Portishead. That is when she first had the idea of starting her own band, that could mix all these artistic influences. In 2000, she quit AndoDrom and she looked for new musicians from the most varied musical backgrounds and genres (Etno, Jazz, Classical and ElectronicMusic). That is how Mitsoura was born. Mónika Miczura says: [...] "My <b>artistic</b> <b>creed,</b> my Ars Poetica is that 'Everything alters me, but nothing changes me.' (Salvador Dalí) and also that 'the mixing of cultures is a useful thing' (Béla Bartók) that is why I am not afraid to mix clean traditions with even contemporary, urban culture, {{because this is not}} the dilution of traditions but rather a way to make them alive. In my view, traditions are not museum-wise understood, dusty imprints of a bygone era, but rather possibilities for existing and current forms of expression." [...] The band Mitsoura had released two albums in this spirit: Mitsoura (2003) and DuraDuraDura (2008). They had performed in significant international festivals and concert-theatres (WOMAD, WOMEX, Royal Opera House London, Grand Théâtre de Bordeaux, Fete de la Misique Paris etc.). 2011 was their last time on stage, but after 3 years of creative pause, the Mitsoura is working on a new album-material.|$|E
40|$|Gnomic {{formulae}} {{are one of}} the {{instances in}} which doxa is expressed. They have a number of specific implications – such as the belief in the existence of authority, in the possibility of gaining and phrasing universal truths – which make them particularly interesting for an analysis of texts which came to being {{in the context of an}} <b>artistic</b> <b>creed</b> that questions such presuppositions. This article takes a closer look at the presence and functioning of such formulae in three texts from around 1900 by liberal Flemish writers that have been associated with naturalism: Madeleine by Virginie Loveling, ‘Het populierken op den heuvel’ by Herman Teirlinck and ‘Op het kleine gehucht’ by Cyriel Buysse. The analysis of the gnomic formulae in these three cases uncovers different interpretations of notions such as fate, authority and insight and allows for a more nuanced view on the literature of this period. This approach thus seems to be a promising one for a far broader research...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{the influence of}} the personal and intellectual friendship between John Ruskin and Edward Burne-Jones on the artist's work, and argues that the friendship was instrumental in Burne-Jones's transition from Victorian to modern aesthetics. Chapter 1 deals with the wide range of critical responses elicited by Burne-Jones's work; it also highlights the difficulty of appreciating Burne-Jones fully without an awareness of his relations with Ruskin. In Chapter 2 I discuss Ruskin's early critical theories and his position in the aesthetic debate of the mid-nineteenth century. This is particularly relevant to Burne-Jones's development because he started his artistic career in total agreement with Ruskin. Chapter 3 addresses those experiences in Burne-Jones's life prior to meeting Ruskin, which led the artist to embrace the work of the critic. At the end of the chapter I touch on Burne-Jones's friendship with Rossetti, whose mid- 1850 s influence suggested to Burne-Jones a path pointing in a different direction from Ruskin. With his mature work Burne-Jones revisited and explored Rossetti's early ideas on 'design', and developed an <b>artistic</b> <b>creed</b> which both acknowledges Ruskin's teaching and departs from it. Ruskin took an interest in Burne-Jones's career as soon as they met. They became friends, and Ruskin commissioned work from him, gave him practical advice and made demands on his style. But the strongest influence Ruskin exercised was by his writing, as Burne-Jones read Ruskin all his life. Chapter 4 explores the emergence of those of Rusk in's critical ideas which had the greatest impact on Burne-Jones's art. The last chapter deals with Burne-Jones's response to Ruskin's critical theories and personal experiences. This response crystallised at its clearest in the four series of The Briar Rose, on which Burne-Jones worked between 1864 and 1895. The pictures, I conclude, present themselves as a continued emotional and intellectual dialogue with Ruskin and formulate an aesthetic pointing towards the twentieth century.
