40|$|In {{this work}} we aimed to {{evaluate}} the thermoregulatory traits of crossbred cattle Holstein x Gir under climatic influence during the morning and <b>afternoon</b> <b>shifts</b> of the raining season of the year, in southern of Piaui state. This study was carried out at the experimental farm of the Federal University of Piaui (UFPI), Campus Professora Cinobelina Elvas (CPCE), situated in Bom Jesus city, in Piaui state. Ten cows in lactation were used and respiratory and cardiac frequencies, rectal temperature and sweating rate were measured. The physical analysis of the thermal environment of the install was acquired in the weather station of the UFPI’s campus, which registered the temperature and air relative humidity. The wet bulb globe temperature index (WBGTI) was obtained by a thermometer inserted into a black globe. There was significant difference (P< 0. 05) for all the weather variables, highlighting the air temperature, which had higher value in the <b>afternoon</b> <b>shift</b> (30. 41 °C). A significant effect (P< 0. 05) was observed for the physiological variables respiratory rate and sweating rate, in which higher values were measured during the <b>afternoon</b> <b>shift,</b> being respectively 51. 59 mov. /min. and 104. 69 g/m/h, probably because this shift {{showed the highest values}} for air temperature.

40|$|Abstract: Objective: To {{evaluate}} sleep, alertness, salivary cortisol {{levels and}} autonomic {{activity in the}} <b>afternoon</b> and morning <b>shifts</b> of a sample of short distance bus drivers. Methods: A sample of 47 bus drivers was evaluated. Data regarding subjects and working characteristics, alertness (psychomotor vigilance task), sleep habits (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Actigraphy), endocrine stress response (salivary cortisol) and autonomic activity (heart rate variability) were collected. Results: Sleep restriction was highly prevalent. Drivers in the morning shift slept one hour less {{than those in the}} <b>afternoon</b> <b>shift,</b> showed lower reaction time performance, a flattening of cortisol morning-evening difference, and higher overweight prevalence. Conclusions: The differences found between morning and <b>afternoon</b> <b>shifts</b> point out to the need of the implementation of educational strategies to compensate the sleep loss associated with an early work schedule...|$|R
