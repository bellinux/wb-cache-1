On top of criticizing, {{he wanted to}} make good use of the New Culture Movement (新文化運動) to publicize and promote new social ideals for the Chinese future development. Chen Duxiu suggested that Xin Shehui could be edited with a more <b>approachable</b> <b>style</b> accepted by the general public. The magazine was finally published on 1 November 1919 throughout China, arousing tides of attention from the public, especially amongst the young readers. However, as Zheng and his co-editors were still inexperienced in editing by that time, the magazine was thought to be immature in editing and too sloganeered. On the hand, the content of the magazine upset the military side of the government. Thus, in one month's time, the government called the publication to a halt.|$|E
50|$|Songs of Our Days, Op. 76 (Песни наших дней), is a rarely {{performed}} cantata for mezzo-soprano and baritone soloists, chorus {{and orchestra}} composed by Sergei Prokofiev in 1937, {{during the height}} of Stalin's regime. With rousing marches and text extolling (somewhat unrealistically) Russian virtues and Stalin's magnanimity, the work is composed in a much more <b>approachable</b> <b>style</b> than one would expect in Prokofiev's music during this period.|$|E

50|$|Floyd {{was often}} {{referred}} to as “E-Flo” for his <b>approachable</b> <b>style</b> with students. The nickname was given to him originally by the University of Missouri student newspaper, The Maneater.

He gave out his personal cell phone number to any student who asked for it - once famously to an entire group of student reporters at the WSU student newspaper, The Daily Evergreen, during a meeting with them.|$|E

In {{the first show}} of 2010 the Mandogs announced a format change away from highly planned, pre-recorded content to a more relaxed and casual style. The Mandogs have suggested multiple reasons for this, including demands by Radio Monash administration for a more <b>approachable</b> <b>style,</b> or because the hosts were [...] "spending multiple hours of preparation for 5 minutes of content". Whereas previously The Mandogs' shows would be fast paced with multiple breaks, the shows are now more relaxed, based around comedic observations and general banter.|$|E

5000|$|The book {{received}} largely positive {{reviews in}} the UK, US and Australian press, on the blogosphere and bookseller sites. Most often praised were the book's breadth (Wired's Geek Dad called it [...] "a very coherent and entertaining {{journey through the}} world of future technology"), balance (The Guardian described the book as [...] "a measured effort {{to take stock of}} the reasons for hope, and to keep faith with the enlightenment project"), <b>approachable</b> <b>style</b> (Brainpickings.org wondered if the book might be [...] "our generation’s version of Bill Bryson’s iconic A Short History of Nearly Everything") and the author's ability to take often complex scientific research and render it understandable to the non-science literate ("an ability to express even the most complex scientific problems in terms easily understood by a layperson" [...] said The Sydney Morning Herald).|$|E
50|$|Difficult to {{describe}} but generally {{in the broad}} category of Neoromanticism (music), St. Clair's music runs the gamut of pure tonality to avant-garde atonality. His early Piano Pieces no. 1 and no.2 are intensely atonal and show the influence of Karlheinz Stockhausen. Since then, however, he has turned to a more <b>approachable</b> <b>style</b> following the tradition of 20th-century masters including Igor Stravinsky, Dmitri Shostakovich, Béla Bartók and Arnold Schoenberg, the latter who taught his teachers Earl Kim and Leon Kirchner. His Love-Canzonettes and other works for chorus and his many ragtime works for piano are completely tonal and classically conceived, as is his Symphony in A and his chamber opera, Taema. His string quartets and much of his other music including his Concertino for Wind Band are tonally more challenging and structurally freer. For instance, his First String Quartet is structured freely around the octatonic scale, while his Second String Quartet employs a twelve-tone row.|$|E
5000|$|Many reviewers {{have noted}} Phillips’ <b>approachable</b> writing <b>style.</b> In his Reel Music review, Alan Rogers observes that Phillips “writes {{in a style}} that is very inclusive; there is no “I” or “you” but rather “we” and “us”, as though the reader is {{accompanying}} Phillips on a journey of discovery. This makes for a very enjoyable tour through all aspects of video game music composing.” ...|$|R

To achieve these goals anthropologists must write in accessible styles for diverse audiences. In this paper, we review the work of five popular nonfiction writers {{to determine the extent}} to which their <b>approachable</b> writing <b>styles</b> are compatible with anthropological rigor and nuance. While none of these authors meets all of our hopes for anthropological analysis, each does manage to blend some elements of scholarship with a readable style. We therefore highlight some of their stylistic approaches in the hope that these might help anthropologists engage more effectively in public debate...|$|R
5000|$|Sherman was {{the author}} of several books and more than a hundred {{academic}} papers. Sherman is most known for popular science books about microbiology with particular emphasis on malariology. In 2005 Sherman edited a textbook, Molecular approaches to malaria, noted for its inclusion of material following the 2002 complete genomic mapping of Plasmodium falciparum. Sherman's 2007 book Twelve Diseases that Changed Our World has been commented upon for its <b>approachable</b> <b>style,</b> having been written for novices and casual readers rather than academic audiences. Similarly, his 2009 The Elusive Malaria Vaccine has been reviewed as being engaging for the lay audience as it describes the history of malaria, particularly in the search for a vaccine. Described by one reviewer as [...] "a story for all curious readers", Sherman's 2011 Magic Bullets to Conquer Malaria was criticized for a lack of either scientific or historical rigor although the book tells interesting stories of malariology.|$|E
5000|$|Appignanesi {{has written}} four novels, {{the first three}} of which were {{published}} as a fiction trilogy, Italia Perversa, consisting of the novels Stalin’s Orphans, The Mosque, and Destroying America, originally drafted in1967, saw light in the early 1980s. The trilogy is epic in the scale of its locations - Vienna, Zagreb, Italy while its Quebecois protagonist's travels are ultimately fated to ominous disillusionment through his separatist terrorism. However, Appignanesi's demanding and highly literate prose, {{in contrast to the}} generally well received <b>approachable</b> <b>style</b> of the illustrated texts, produced ambivalent reviews. It has been described as [...] "A tour of twentieth century European culture with inescapable echoes of Musil, Svevo and Kafka[...] [...] [...] A fretful, nervous brilliance playing over much of the book a piece of infinite fascination, the sort of novel which, for all its faults, jerks us out of our provincialism." [...] And [...] "Literary devices and ambitions almost bury this 1967 saga [...] [...] [...] but [...] [...] [...] discussions are interesting and Mr. Appignanesi's descriptive skills are considerable." ...|$|E
5000|$|From {{there he}} began a {{collaboration}} with Webb Miller of the United Press in New York. While working for the United Press he learned to write for the lay public in an uncomplicated style that would distinguish him {{within the realm of}} Italian journalism. One lesson he took to heart from Miller was to [...] "always write as if writing to a milkman from Ohio". This open and <b>approachable</b> <b>style</b> was something he never forgot and he'd often recall that very quote during his long life. Another indelible American moment occurred while teaching a course. Someone had asked him to explain the composition that Montanelli had just read. Montanelli told him he'd repeat it since he clearly didn't understand... Hitting the table, the red-faced student cut him off and angrily told him, as a matter of fact, that if he hadn't understood Montanelli's composition, then it was Montanelli who was the imbecil! needed to change it. It was then that he realized that he, who had come from the authoritarian regime of fascist Italy, had just had a confrontation with democracy. During this time Montanelli conducted his first interview with a celebrity: Henry Ford - who surprised him by admitting {{he did not have a}} driver's license. During the interview, surrounded by American art depicting pastoral and frontier subjects, Ford began to reverentially talk about the Founding Fathers. Looking at the decor, Montanelli astutely asked him how he felt about having destroyed their world. Puzzled, Ford asked what he meant. Undaunted, Montanelli pressed on that the automobile and Ford's revolutionary assembly line system had forever transformed the country. Ford looked shocked, and Montanelli realized that, like all geniuses, Ford hadn't had the slightest idea of what he'd really done.|$|E
40|$|Introduction to Cosmology {{provides}} a rare {{combination of a}} solid foundation of the core physical concepts of cosmology {{and the most recent}} astronomical observations. The book is designed for advanced undergraduates or beginning graduate students and assumes no prior knowledge of general relativity. An emphasis is placed on developing the readers' physical insight rather than losing them with complex math. An <b>approachable</b> writing <b>style</b> and wealth of fresh and imaginative analogies from "everyday" physics are used to make the concepts of cosmology more accessible. The book is unique in that it not only includes recent major developments in cosmology, like the cosmological constant and accelerating universe, but also anticipates key developments expected in the next few years, such as detailed results on the cosmic microwave background...|$|R

30|$|Information sharing {{is another}} {{responsibility}} of the coach (Lyle 2002). Leadership literature indicates that follower performance, satisfaction, and retention are all influenced by relation with his/her immediate supervisor (Goleman et al. 2002). Student-athletes look to their coach for cues and information regarding {{what to do and}} how to do it. Coaching skills are firmly grounded in communication abilities including listening, feedback, and information sharing (Goleman et al. 2002). Communication is necessary for establishing and sustaining trust, and establishment of psychological contracts (Rousseau and Greller 1994). Information sharing reflects the extent to which coaches participate in the mentoring/coaching role to foster each student-athlete’s learning and development. At the heart of this facilitative coaching is an <b>approachable</b> communication <b>style</b> that fosters learning and development through clarifying expectations, providing relevant and up-to-date information, and enabling the student-athlete to obtain the relevant information (Sullivan and Gee 2007).|$|R

40|$|How did the biological, {{brain and}} {{behavioural}} structures underlying human language evolve? When, why {{and where did}} our ancestors become linguistic animals, and what has happened since? This book provides a clear, comprehensive but lively introduction to these interdisciplinary debates. Written in an <b>approachable</b> <b>style,</b> it cuts through the complex, sometimes contradictory and often obscure technical languages used in the different scientific disciplines involved {{in the study of}} linguistic evolution. Assuming no background knowledge in these disciplines, the book outlines the physical and neurological structures underlying language systems, and the limits of our knowledge concerning their evolution. Discussion questions and further reading lists encourage students to explore the primary literature further, and the final chapter demonstrates that while many questions still remain unanswered, there is a growing consensus as to how modern human languages have arisen as systems by the interplay of evolved structures and cultural transmission...|$|E
40|$|Abstract In this paper, we outline {{findings}} from an innovative action research project in an English police force that aimed to enhance community engagement in four neighbourhood policing teams. We describe {{the principles that}} {{lie at the heart}} of neighbourhood policing and how, for a variety of reasons, these were often seen to be peripheral rather than essential to the teams ’ activities. We describe how a lack of understanding about the role of neighbourhood policing, limited knowledge about communities and their differing needs, narrow methods of engagement and consultation, as well as the perception that community engagement was ‘nice to do but not essential ’ all reduced the potential benefits of neighbourhood policing. We then discuss the ways we sought to tackle these issues using action research. What do we want from our local police? Extensive research exists on what the public want from their local police including visibility, responsiveness, reassurance, and an <b>approachable</b> <b>style</b> (see Lloyd and Foster, 2009 for a review of the literature). Local policing has been an integral element of British police reform agendas in recent years with the national introduction of neighbourhood policing teams and efforts to give the public a greater voice in deciding what their local police do (see fo...|$|E

50|$|Programming Perl, {{best known}} as the Camel Book among programmers, is a book about writing {{programs}} using the Perl programming language, revised as several editions (1991-2012) to reflect major language changes since Perl version 4. Editions have been co-written by the creator of Perl, Larry Wall, along with Randal L. Schwartz, then Tom Christiansen and then Jon Orwant. Published by O'Reilly Media, the book is considered the canonical reference work for Perl programmers. With over a thousand pages, the various editions contain complete descriptions of each Perl language version and its interpreter. Examples range from trivial code snippets to the highly complex expressions for which Perl is widely known.

He was persuaded to study the parietal eyes of reptiles by his colleague Robert C. Stebbins, and the two published several articles on the parietal eye of western fence lizards. Eakin, alone or with colleagues, published many other papers on the anatomy and function of reptilian parietal eyes and similar structures in amphibians. Eakin's 1973 monograph, The Third Eye, was received as comprehensive and detailed enough for biologists, yet in a <b>style</b> <b>approachable</b> to non-scientists or undergraduates. He also studied amphibian development and was recognized as a skilled and early practitioner of electron microscopy. Eakin received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1953, and the Boston Museum of Science's Walker Prize in 1976. He authored or co-authored over 200 scientific papers, was elected president of the Western Society of Naturalists in 1949 and American Society of Zoologists in 1975, and was a fellow of the California Academy of Sciences for 52 years.|$|R
