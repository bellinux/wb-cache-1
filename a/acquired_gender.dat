30|$|Indeed, {{compared}} to noun cues, {{the gender of}} German monomorphemic nouns {{appears to be more}} reliably indicated by syntactic cues in the morphosyntactic environment of the noun, such as the definite and indefinite determiners and other gender-marking morphemes (e.g., pronouns) (MacWhinney et al., 1989; Schwichtenberg & Schiller, 2004). This is consistent with syntactic-context models, according to which the morphosyntactic context plays a pivotal role when <b>acquiring</b> <b>gender</b> (Maratsos & Chalkley, 1980; Taraban, 2004). According to these models, gender categories are learnable through the combination of the noun with small sets of associated marker morphemes (e.g., the articles in the German masculine singular form (der, des, dem, den; see Table  1) plus the associated masculine singular pronouns er (‘he’), sein (‘his’), ihm (‘him’), ihn (‘him’)). Note, however, that in German individual markers, such as “il” or “la” in the Italian case, may be misleading gender assignment cues: some markers feature across gender subclasses, as shown in Table  1 for the case of German definite articles. While each gender subclass is associated with a distinct case marking paradigm of definite articles, the full set of 12 grammatical functions (three genders by four cases) is served by only six different forms; “der”, for instance, occurs in two different genders and three different cases.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2004 This study investigates how English-speaking 5 [...] 7 {{year olds}} in a Spanish {{immersion}} program <b>acquire</b> the Spanish <b>gender</b> system. Perez-Pereira (1991) {{has shown that}} native Spanish-speaking children do not attend to semantic cues (reference to a male or female entity) nearly {{to the extent that}} they attend to phonological cues (word endings). Similar research by Karmiloff-Smith (1979), Levy (1983), and Mills (1986) support Perez-Pereira's findings that children attend to language-internal cues to grammatical gender, not language-external cues. However, learners of second languages may use different strategies in <b>acquiring</b> <b>gender</b> systems than first language learners do. Taylor-Brown (1984) showed that English-speaking 3 rd [...] 9 th graders in a Canadian French immersion program were unable to use French phonological cues in the same way that native French-speaking children do. Instead, they relied on consciously employed "rules of thumb" to remember noun genders. The question here is whether younger children follow the acquisition pattern of their older L 2 counterparts, or of L 1 learners of +gender language. In this study, kindergartners and first graders in a Spanish immersion program looked at pictures of people and animals, and listened to two puppets using masculine and feminine articles to refer to the entities in the pictures. They were then asked to decide which puppet was using the correct article. Results indicate that kindergartners and boys were more successful at correctly assigning gender when they heard a morpho-phonological cue that corresponded to the correct gender than when they only saw a semantic cue to grammatical gender. Results also show that children were better at assigning gender when they had two converging cues to gender, rather than a single cue. This suggests that, like L 1 learners of a +gender language, the kindergartners and boys use the linguistic gender cue to a greater extent than they use the semantic (sex) cue, and to a greater extent than first graders and girls. These results contribute to our understanding of how age, cognitive development, and first language may influence acquisition of a +gender L 2...|$|R

In the space of twenty years we have seen the decriminalisation of homosexuality and the introduction of a sophisticated equality infrastructure, with the Employment Equality Act 1998 and the Equal Status Act 2000 having been at the forefront internationally in naming sexual orientation as a specific equality ground and in extending its scope outside the field of employment.

This provision was given effect in the UK through the enactment of the Human Rights Act 1998, which incorporated ECHR rights, allowing domestic litigants to rely on them before the British courts. The express referral to "national laws" in art. 12 indicates that States may legitimately impose restrictions on the exercise of this right, such as bars on marriage between persons who fall within the prohibited degrees of a relationship, a minimum marriageable age, and the requirement to comply with certain formalities for the valid celebration of marriages. The Convention institutions maintain, nevertheless, the power to scrutinise any such restrictions, and ensure that domestic law strikes a fair balance between the prevention of objectionable marriages and the protection of individual rights against social prejudice. Controversial issues in this area include same-sex marriage, polygamous, underage and religious marriage within ethnic minority communities, transsexuals' right to marry according to the newly <b>acquired</b> <b>gender,</b> the suspension of the exercise of the right in circumstances involving deprivation of liberty, the right to re-marry, and the right to divorce and re-acquire the capacity to marry...|$|E

Overall, our findings show that gender is vulnerable in both SLI and L 2 groups. More particularly, they suggest that all child groups basically make {{the same type of}} errors and that they all differ from the adult group. It is suggested that any differences between the child learners can best be understood in terms of factors that influence intake (in both SLI and L 2) rather than in terms of access to grammatical principles: SLI children have a (major) processing deficit and L 2 children have received less input to Dutch, both factors causing poorer intake. That problems with the intake are crucial is further supported by the clear cumulative effect of bilingualism and SLI: the L 2 -SLI group not only differs from the child L 2 controls but also from the Dutch L 1 -SLI group...|$|R

Aim: This study aims to explore the distribution and proportion of major comorbidities among psoriatic patients of King Abdulaziz Medical City (KAMC). Methods: A case series study was conducted in KAMC in Riyadh. It targeted psoriatic patients of all age groups from both genders. Data were collected by retrieving psoriatic patients' medical files to <b>acquire</b> age, <b>gender,</b> weight, blood pressure and different laboratory profiles from their charts. Results: A total of 81 psoriatic patients were included (45 males, 36 females). The mean age was 50 ± 20 years. The proportion of psoriatic patients having hypertension was found to be 48 % (n = 39).

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} {{a test of the}} {{validity}} of Pienemann's (1998) Processability Theory (PT). This theory predicts that certain morphological and syntactic phenomena are acquired in a fixed sequence. Three phenomena were chosen for this study: attributive adjective morphology, predicative adjective morphology, and subordinate clause syntax (placement of negation). These phenomena are located at successive developmental stages in the hierarchy predicted by PT. We test whether they actually do appear in this predicted hierarchical order in the L 2 of Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish learners. The three languages mentioned are very closely related and have the same adjective morphology and subordinate clause syntax. We can, therefore, treat them as one language {{for the purposes of this}} study. Three analyses have been carried out: The first follows Pienemann's theory and is concerned only with syntactic levels; the second is a semantic analysis of the acquisition of number versus that of gender; the third analysis studies the various kinds of mismatches between the inflection of the noun, the controller, and the adjective. The results are the following: The first test supports PT as it has been described by Pienemann. The second analysis shows that there is an acquisitional hierarchy such that number is <b>acquired</b> before <b>gender</b> (in adjectives), and the mismatch analysis raises questions about the fundamental assumptions of the theory...|$|R

40|$|The present thesis investigates {{grammatical}} gender processing in French {{as a first}} and second language. It focuses mainly on whether non-native speakers can achieve native-like representation and processing of gender, and whether the native language (L 1) influences the acquisition of the second language (L 2). Theoretical linguistic models have made two contrasting assumptions concerning the ability of late bilinguals to <b>acquire</b> grammatical <b>gender</b> in their L 2. While some models propose that grammatical features, such as gender, are no longer available for L 2 acquisition {{if they are not}} present in L 1 (Hawkins & Chan, 1997), others assume that these features are still available via the universal grammar if required in the L 2 (Schwartz & Sprouse, 1996; White, 1989, 2003). These assumptions, however, are supported only by off-line studies and do not provide a comprehensive account for gender representation and processing. The present thesis uses online techniques to address these questions both in language comprehension and language production. The first chapters are devoted to comprehension processes and examined French native speakers, English-French and German-French bilinguals’ performance during the processing of correct and syntactically anomalous sentences, using ERPs and eye-movements to record behaviour. We concluded that, like native speakers, English-French bilinguals are sensitive to gender agreement violations. Thus, we argue that late bilinguals are able to <b>acquire</b> the <b>gender</b> system of their L 2 even if this grammatical feature is not present in their L 1. On the other hand, the performance of the German speakers we tested suggests that the presence of a competing gender system in the native language may hamper gender acquisition in L 2. The influence of the native language may vary, however, according to both proficiency and how gender systems map across languages, as suggest the results we obtained with Spanish bilinguals tested in language production. In a second series of experiments, we examined determiner selection in French to further investigate gender representation and processing, but in language production. Using a picture-word interference paradigm, we compared the production of simple and complex noun phrases (NP) in French native speakers, English-French and Spanish-French bilinguals. From our results, we argue that gender representation is similar in L 1 and L 2, but that gender processing is less incremental in non-native speakers in that they do not compute agreement between the noun and other elements of the NP as automatically as native speakers do. The absence of interference between the two gender systems of the Spanish-French bilinguals we tested suggests that the gender systems of the two languages may be autonomous in highly proficient bilinguals. Our results suggest that highly proficient bilinguals can reach native-like representation and processing of gender in their L 2 and that such is not constrained by either the age of onset of learning or the grammar of the learners L 1.

40|$|We {{describe}} the "double zipper" mechanism of human male urethral formation, where the distal zipper opens the urethral groove through canalization of the urethral plate, {{and a second}} closing zipper follows behind and closes the urethral groove to form the tubular urethra. Anonymous human fetal genital specimens were <b>acquired</b> and <b>gender</b> was determined by polymerase chain reaction of the Y chromosome. Specimens were processed for optical projection tomography, stained with E-cadherin, Ki 67 and caspase 3, and imaged. Eight developing male fetal specimens from 6. 5 to 16. 5 weeks of gestation were analyzed by optical projection tomography, and an additional 5  specimens by serial sections. Phallus length ranged from 1. 3 to 3. 7 mm. The urethral plate canalized into a groove with 2 epithelial edges that subsequently fused. Ki 67 staining was localized to the dorsal aspect of the urethral plate. In contrast, caspase 3 staining was not observed. The entire process was completed during a 10 -week period. The human male urethra appears to form by 2 mechanisms, an initial "opening zipper" that facilitates distal canalization of the solid urethral plate to form the urethral groove, which involves {{a high rate of}} epithelial proliferation (apoptosis not observed), and a "closing zipper" facilitating fusion of the 2 epithelial surfaces of the urethral groove, and thus extending the penile urethra distally. Improved knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of these processes is critical to understanding mechanisms of abnormal urethral development, such as hypospadias...|$|R
