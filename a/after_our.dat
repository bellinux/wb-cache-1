25|$|Rudolf Steiner, {{who founded}} the esoteric spiritual {{movement}} anthroposophy, used the concept of Ahriman to name one of two extreme forces which pull humanity away from the centering influence of Christ. Steiner associated Ahriman, the lower spirit, with materialism, science, heredity, objectivity and soul-hardening. He thought that contemporary Christianity was subject to Ahrimanic influence, since it tended towards materialistic interpretations. Steiner predicted that Ahriman, as a supersensible Being, would incarnate into an earthly form, 'some little time <b>after</b> <b>our</b> present earthly existence, in fact in the third post-Christian millennium'.|$|E

25|$|A {{collaboration}} {{is like a}} good conversation, Nicola came to my studio {{a couple of times}} and I went to hers; we initially chatted about her music, the forthcoming album and how this related to her vision for the shoes. I went away and started designing my response to this. <b>After</b> <b>our</b> first meeting I was excited by her ideas and collaborating with people who have a strong vision is really fantastic. Nicola considers everything she does really carefully and has a totally clear view of what she wants to achieve. While the shoes are just a small part of this, I knew it would be interesting and fun to work together.|$|E
25|$|In particular, I {{shall never}} forget the Barbarians game at Cardiff Arms Park to end our Grand Slam tour of 1984. We weren't in such good shape – our {{discipline}} had surrendered to celebration after beating Scotland and we knew {{this was to be}} Europe's game of retribution against us. We seemed to be constantly counter-attacking to get out of trouble and then Campese struck. He made a break from within his own half, the defence came at him and he stepped left and right with remarkable speed. And in the twinkling of an eye, the try line was his. But he had one defender to beat, the Welsh centre Robert Ackerman. Ackerman, unfortunately, had criticised the Australian victory <b>after</b> <b>our</b> crushing victory in the Test against Wales and Campo didn't have the words to retaliate then. But he retaliated now, with his feet and hands. He turned Ackerman inside out, threatening to go past, then changing direction, offering himself to be tackled then accelerating away until the crowd erupted, first in disbelief, then in sheer amusement and joy at what they were seeing. One yard from the line, Campo passed to Michael Hawker, and I'm sure, to this day, the pass was forward, but the referee knew he had seen artistry of incomparable dimension at work and the only reward he could offer was a try, which he duly did. It's an image I'll always associate with Campese. It remains for me the metaphor of his career.|$|E

[...] Exodus' lead guitarist Gary Holt says that is a compliment that the band has named themselves after Bonded by Blood. [...] "Could I have imagined that all these years later a band was going to name themselves <b>after</b> <b>our</b> first album? Probably not.

500|$|There was {{controversy}} as {{to whether}} the document should be published, but the Department of Justice headed by Attorney General Janet Reno, along with FBI Director Louis Freeh, recommended publication out of concern for public safety and in hopes that a reader could identify the author. Bob Guccione of Penthouse volunteered to publish it, but Kaczynski replied that, since Penthouse was less [...] "respectable" [...] than the other publications, he would in that case [...] "reserve the right to plant one (and only one) bomb intended to kill, <b>after</b> <b>our</b> manuscript has been published."

In 2008, McCaw told the IRB:"My main role as a flanker is, defensively, to tie in with the back line to ensure that the defence works well. On attack I think my primary role at first phase is to look <b>after</b> <b>our</b> ball. You attack the back line and I'm usually the first person there to make sure we secure that ball. Thirdly I put pressure on break downs and make sure I disturb their ball and try to turn their ball over." ...|$|E

500|$|Thatcher defined her own {{political}} philosophy {{in a major}} and controversial break with the one-nation conservatism of Edward Heath and her Conservative predecessors in an interview published in Woman's Own magazine, three months after her victory in the 1987 general election:I think we have gone through a period when too many children and people {{have been given to}} understand [...] "I have a problem, it is the Government's job to cope with it!"

[...] and so they are casting their problems on society and who is society? There is no such thing! There are individual men and women and there are families and no government can do anything except through people and people look to themselves first. It is our duty to look after ourselves and then also to help look <b>after</b> <b>our</b> neighbour and life is a reciprocal business and people have got the entitlements too much in mind without the obligations.|$|E
500|$|A day later, {{producer}} David Kahne stated on {{the same}} site that the leaked listing was bogus. In an interview with Billboard magazine in May 2007, McCartney said that the album's material was [...] "in some ways a little bit retrospective. Some of them are of now, some of them hark back to the past, {{but all of them}} are songs I'm very proud of." [...] McCartney played mandolin on the song [...] "Dance Tonight". He comments that [...] "In searching the instrument to try and find chords, which I did with the guitar when I was 14, probably, that freshness was brought back." [...] "Ever Present Past", which McCartney called [...] "personal", originally started out as a song called [...] "Perfect Lover". [...] "Ever Present Past" [...] also includes references to the Beatles. In June 2007, McCartney revealed that [...] "See Your Sunshine" [...] "is pretty much an out-and-out love song for Heather. A lot of the album was done before, during and <b>after</b> <b>our</b> separation. I didn't go back and take out any songs to do with her." [...] "You Tell Me" [...] is about McCartney's memories of his previous wife, Linda.|$|E
500|$|On {{the night}} of the Enchant release party, Autumn learned that Courtney Love had invited her to record an album, America's Sweetheart, and embark on the tour to promote it. Contributing violin and vocals, Autumn {{appeared}} in Love's backing band The Chelsea—Radio Sloan, Dvin Kirakosian, Samantha Maloney, and Lisa Leveridge—on the 2004 tour. Much of Autumn's violin work did not get released on the album; she commented: [...] "This had to do entirely with new producers taking over the project <b>after</b> <b>our</b> little vacation in France, and carefully discarding all of our sessions." [...] She performed live with Love and The Chelsea on Late Show with David Letterman on March 17, 2004, and at Bowery Ballroom the next day. In September 2004, her father died from lung cancer, even though he had quit smoking twenty years earlier. Near the end of 2004, she was filmed for an appearance on an episode of HGTV's Crafters Coast to Coast, showing viewers how to create faery wings and sushi-styled soap—both products she sold in her online [...] "web design and couture fashion house", WillowTech House.
