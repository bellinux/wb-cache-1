40|$|Abstract—Current {{military}} {{communication network}} is a gen-eration old {{and is no}} longer effective in meeting the emerging requirements imposed by the next generation military embedded applications. A new communication network based upon Full Duplex Switched Ethernet is proposed in this paper to overcome these limitations. To allow existing military subsystems to be easily supported by a Switched Ethernet network, our proposal consists in keeping their current centralized communication scheme by using an optimized master/slave transmission control on Switched Ethernet thanks to the Flexible Time Triggered (FTT) paradigm. Our main objective is to assess the performance of such a proposal and estimate the quality of service we can expect in terms of latency. Using the Network Calculus formalism, schedulability analysis are determined. These analysis are illustrated {{in the case of a}} realistic military embedded application extracted from a real military <b>aircraft</b> <b>network,</b> to highlight the proposal’s ability to support the required time constrained communications...|$|E

40|$|Comprehensive {{understanding}} {{and analysis of}} the more electric <b>aircraft</b> <b>network</b> architecture (MEA) usually require a powerful simulation framework, which allows modelling, simulation and post-processing of aircraft electric power systems. Since the electric power network in the MEA typically covers several physical domains such as electrical systems, magnetic systems, mechanical systems and control, a modelling language to be selected for the design framework has to be capable of modelling multi-domain systems. In this regard, Modelica - an object oriented, equation based modelling language has been chosen as a candidate for modelling the extended electric network in JTI SGO project. By hand of some study cases at supplier level and airframer level, the capability of the Modelica technique based design framework was tested, demonstrated and improved.

40|$|International audienceIn {{aircraft}} applications, {{ensuring the}} power {{quality of the}} electrical system {{is one of the}} critical constraints during network equipment design. This task must be done in accordance with additional constraints like the global weight, cost and volume. In order to prevent high level disturbances in <b>aircraft</b> <b>networks,</b> international standards have fixed the conducted EMI levels that power converters are allowed to emit. On the other hand, respecting these standards at the design step requires analytical and semi-analytical models that are able to achieve a real system analysis and to develop optimized equipments adapted to the network requirements. In this paper we paved the way towards an anticipatory estimation of low frequency harmonics in a typical electrical actuator topology (Filter+Converter+Motor+Reductor).

40|$|Over {{the last}} thirty years, the MIL-STD 1553 B data bus {{has been used in}} many {{embedded}} systems, like aircrafts, ships, missiles and satellites. However, the increasing number and complexity of interconnected subsystems lead to emerging needs for more communication bandwidth. Therefore, a new interconnection system is needed to overcome the limitations of the MIL-STD 1553 B data bus. Among several high speed networks, Full Duplex Switched Ethernet is put forward here as an attractive candidate to replace the MIL-STD 1553 B data bus. However, the key argument against Switched Ethernet lies in its non-deterministic behavior that makes it inadequate to deliver hard timeconstrained communications. Hence, our primary objective in this paper is to achieve an accepted QoS level offered by Switched Ethernet, to support diverse " 1553 B"-based applications requirements. We evaluate the performance of traffic shaping techniques on Full Duplex Switched Ethernet with an adequate choice of service strategy in the switch, to guarantee the real-time constraints required by these specific 1553 B-based applications. An analytic study is conducted, using the Network Calculus formalism, to evaluate the deterministic guarantees offered by our approach. Theoretical analysis are then investigated {{in the case of a}} realistic " 1553 B"-based application extracted from a real military <b>aircraft</b> <b>network.</b> The results herein show the ability of profiled Full Duplex Switched Ethernet to satisfy 1553 B-like real-time constraints...|$|E
40|$|Studies diverge {{substantially}} on {{the actual}} magnitude of the North American carbon budget. This {{is due to the}} lack of appropriate data and also stems from the difficulty to properly model all the details of the flux distribution and transport inside the region of interest. To sidestep these difficulties, we use here a simple budgeting approach to estimate land-atmosphere fluxes across North America by balancing the inflow and outflow of CO 2 from the troposphere. We base our study on the unique sampling strategy of atmospheric CO 2 vertical profiles over North America from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/Earth System Research Laboratory <b>aircraft</b> <b>network,</b> from which we infer the three-dimensional CO 2 distribution over the continent. We find a moderate sink of 0. 5  ±  0. 4  PgC y- 1 for the period 2004 – 2006 for the coterminous United States, in good agreement with the forest-inventory-based estimate of the first North American State of the Carbon Cycle Report, and averaged climate conditions. We find that the highest uptake occurs in the Midwest and in the Southeast. This partitioning agrees with independent estimates of crop uptake in the Midwest, which proves to be a significant part of the US atmospheric sink, and of secondary forest regrowth in the Southeast. Provided that vertical profile measurements are continued, our study offers an independent means to link regional carbon uptake to climate drivers...|$|E
40|$|A {{persistent}} {{problem for}} Aircraft Manufacturers {{has been the}} difficulty in carrying out accurate and robust simulations of the complete aircraft power network, while including numerous models {{from a variety of}} individual equipment suppliers. Often the models are of variable or low quality, with ill-defined parameters or behavior, and in many cases of the wrong level of abstraction to be appropriate for large scale network simulations. In addition, individual equipment suppliers often provide poor models for network integration, with a common issue being low robustness of models leading to lack of convergence, excessive simulation times and delays in development due to the need for rework and extensive testing of these models. In order to address this specific issue a complete library of power electronic system models for Aerospace applications has been developed that encompasses the range of functions from elementary components (passives, devices, switches and magnetic components), intermediate building blocks (rectifiers, inverters, motors, protection devices) and finally complete system models (variable frequency starter generators, power converters, battery and storage elements, transformers). These models have been developed in partnership with several key aircraft equipment suppliers and in partnership with Airbus to ensure that the resulting models are complete and robust. Specific equipment models were also developed in this library including permanent magnet generators, synchronous machines, environmental control systems, wing ice protection systems, power electronic modules and advanced power protection systems. The specific models have been validated against reference and measured data to ensure that they are consistent and accurate. This paper will describe the techniques used to achieve more robust models, using model based engineering, the integration of specific equipment models into the complete <b>aircraft</b> <b>network</b> and the validation of the behavior against measured results.

40|$|In {{preparation}} for {{a study on the}} potential impact of a space-borne Doppler wind lidar on the quality of NWP products, a series of assimilations and forecasts were conducted to estimate the potential benefit of conventional wind and temperature profile measurements over North America to numerical weather forecasts for the Northern Hemisphere and specifically, Europe. A comparison of the forecast quality of a control run, using all available observations, to experiments omitting wind and temperature data from specific instruments (radiosondes, pilot stations and aircraft) makes it possible to estimate the importance of the omitted data, and clarify whether winds derived from the geostrophic relation are sufficient or whether observed wind profiles result in a more realistic definition of the initial state for numerical weather prediction systems in the extra-tropic regions. Very little impact on forecast quality was noted when wind or temperature observations from radiosondes and pilots were excluded from the assimilation process. However, a clear deterioration in forecast quality was observed when additionally all available wind or temperature measurements from aircraft were also withheld. Comparisons of the relative utility of wind and temperature observations over North America show that assimilations and forecasts derive more benefit from wind data than from temperature data. The greatest deterioration could be observed if both wind and temperature observations were omitted from the assimilation cycle. By tracing the differences between the control forecasts and the experimental forecasts to their initial difference, the regions around Hudson Bay, Novia Scotia, Buffin Bay and Northern Canada could be identified as sensitive areas, i. e. those where a missing observation could have a substantial effect on the forecast for the Northern Hemisphere and Europe.
