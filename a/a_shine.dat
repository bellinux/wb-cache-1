5|$|During the 1930s, The Beverly Hills Hotel became {{increasingly}} popular with Hollywood film stars. Fred Astaire took <b>a</b> <b>shine</b> to the hotel, and enjoyed reading the Daily Variety and The Hollywood Reporter by the pool. Cesar Romero and Carole Lombard were pictured {{together at the}} hotel in 1937. In 1938, the Sand and Pool Club was established at the hotel. It proved extremely popular, with white sand imported from Arizona, which made the pool area look like a beach. The following year, it began hosting fashion shows sponsored by local department stores such as Bullock's Wilshire. In 1940, one of the hotel's long-time patrons, Marlene Dietrich, was instrumental in bringing about a change in policy in the Polo Lounge, which had made it compulsory for women to don skirts which she refused to wear.|$|E

However, Marge challenges Homer that while she appreciates Adil's good behavior, part of being good parents is that they have the same respect for their natural children, in that is Homer being concerned for Bart while he is abroad. Unbeknown to the family, Adil is actually a spy sent by his government to obtain blueprints of the Springfield nuclear plant's reactor. Homer unwittingly takes him {{on a tour of the}} power plant and thinks nothing of the many photographs Adil takes, which Adil sends home by a secret fax machine in Bart's tree house.|$|E

25|$|Most pottery {{produced}} in central Mexico is fired at low temperatures (low-fire) {{and covered with}} a glaze made with lead and other minerals. This is because lead will fuse and produce <b>a</b> <b>shine</b> at a firing temperature of less than 800C, while alternatives require temperatures twice as high. The use of lead in these wares has produced health warning in both Mexico and the United States, with the risks being known as early as the late 19th century. Lead from the glaze tends to leach into foods after repeated use. Use of this type of ware has been linked to elevated blood levels in children in Mexico City, Oaxaca and other places and severely high levels in children of potters. The lead content is highest in Oaxacan pottery. This lead content has blocked most rurally produced ceramics from the United States market, where they could fetch much higher prices.|$|E

500|$|Reviewers {{commented on}} the {{differences}} between Free and Office of Strategic Influence. Rosenberg described Free as [...] "heavier, darker, more experimental {{and a lot more}} consistent" [...] than the first album. Stewart Mason of Allmusic described the album as [...] "downright commercial in a way that none of the duo's previous projects have been". He regarded the album as less like the [...] "standard-issue epic metal" [...] of the first album and more like [...] "Evanescence's gothy metal-pop crossed with late-era Radiohead's fondness for electronic interference". He considered the songwriting as [...] "catchy enough that it's not unthinkable that unadventurous rock radio programmers could take <b>a</b> <b>shine</b> to the title track or 'Go'", although noted that [...] "Fates Warning and Dream Theater fans might be less impressed". Rosenberg considers Free as musically [...] "a more progressive version of Nine Inch Nails. Instead of creating their darkness with angst and depression, OSI creates their darkness with sheer indifference." [...] Begrand compared the album to Head Control System, [...] "in that it tends to stray from the typical metal template in an attempt at something a little more electronic influenced". Although not considering Free to be as [...] "enthralling" [...] as Head Control System, he noted that the album [...] "still has its moments".|$|E
500|$|Battle ‚Äì In battle mode, {{the player}} fights against up to 3 (or up to 15 with LAN) human-controlled opponents using items {{scattered}} throughout a battle arena. There {{is the traditional}} balloon-popping battle game, in which the player must use items to pop an opponent's three balloons while defending their own. Players can also steal items from one another by speeding towards them with a mushroom or star. In Co-op battles, the player {{in the back of}} the kart can perform a slide-attack on another driver, which can also steal balloons. Additionally, two new games have been implemented: the first involves capturing <b>a</b> <b>Shine</b> Sprite and maintaining possession of it for a certain amount of time, usually starting out with 55 to 60 seconds. Each time the Shine Sprite is lost, the counter will somewhat reset the time. For instance, if a player is able to keep possession of the Shine Sprite for only 30 seconds, the counter would reset to 40 instead of 60. The other mode involves throwing Bob-ombs at each other to collect points. With two players, 3 points are needed to win, but when playing with 3 or 4, 4 points are required to win. If two or more players throw a bomb at each other in unison, no points will be awarded to anybody. In a way, it's similar to a tie. As in previous installments, the battle arenas are enclosed (the exception being Tilt-A-Kart), with a varying layout and a replenishing arsenal of items. (2P-16P only) ...|$|E

500|$|... "Three Little Birds" [...] {{taken from}} Over the Rainbow, was {{released}} as Talbot's first single on 10 June 2008 in the UK, {{and was released}} alongside the album in the US on 14 October. Bedi, writing for the Malaysian newspaper The Star, said that [...] "Three Little Birds" [...] was her favourite song on Over the Rainbow. The single peaked at number 3 on the Independent Singles Charts in the United Kingdom, and entered the Billboard Hot Singles Sales chart at number 2, dropping to 3 the next week. It then raised back to number 2, and, on the sixth week, reached number 1. Talbot received attention from the British press because of the single's success, with the Daily Mail and Daily Telegraph attributing her success in America to her appeal to the Christian market, and {{to the success of}} her videos on YouTube. Talbot's father, Gavin, spoke about the song reaching number one, saying [...] "When we received the phone call we were driving back from doing a round of radio interviews in London and Connie was asleep {{in the back of the}} car.

It is a big achievement ‚Äì people have just taken <b>a</b> <b>shine</b> to her." [...] He also said it was [...] "a big shock to hear she was number one. It is tremendous." [...] As of November 2008, the single has sold more than 250,000 copies worldwide.|$|E

2500|$|Modern [...] "Terra sig" [...] {{should be}} clearly {{distinguished}} from the close reproductions of Roman wares made by some potters deliberately recreating and using the Roman methods. [...] The finish called 'terra sigillata' by studio potters {{can be made from}} most clay, mixed as a very thin liquid slip and settled to separate out only the finest particles to be used as terra sigillata. When applied to unfired clay surfaces, [...] "terra sig" [...] can be polished with a soft cloth or brush to achieve <b>a</b> <b>shine</b> ranging from a smooth silky lustre to a high gloss. The surface of ancient terra sigillata vessels did not require this burnishing or polishing. Burnishing was a technique used on some wares in the Roman period, but terra sigillata was not one of them. [...] The polished surface can only be retained if fired within the low-fire range and will lose its shine if fired higher, but can still display an appealing silky quality.|$|E
