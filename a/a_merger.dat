30|$|The above result {{indicates}} that <b>a</b> VV <b>merger</b> arise in more situations {{when the number}} of firms increase, being the only one expected for a sufficiently large n. The pattern found in Proposition 1 is repeated {{when the number of}} firms is bellow 11, that is, when composite goods are very differentiated <b>a</b> second vertical <b>merger</b> is formed, while the horizontal one is added when composite goods are closer, the threshold for finding <b>a</b> second horizontal <b>merger</b> increases with then number of firms. Regarding SW and CS, the effect of <b>a</b> HH <b>merger</b> is always to reduce them with respect to either the initial situation or with respect to the H merger. The effect of <b>a</b> VV <b>merger</b> is to improve welfare and consumer surplus in case of rather differentiated composite goods. The effect of <b>a</b> VH <b>merger</b> is to improve welfare and consumer surplus with respect to either the initial situation or with respect to <b>a</b> H <b>merger</b> if composite products are very differentiated. However, when compared to <b>a</b> V <b>merger,</b> social welfare and consumer surplus always decrease. As a final comment, the proposal of <b>a</b> new horizontal <b>merger</b> in the market will be always blocked while the proposal of a vertical one will be always cleared.|$|R

40|$|We re-examine {{the common}} wisdom that {{cross-border}} mergers {{are the most}} effective merger strategy for firms facing powerful unions. In contrast, we obtain <b>a</b> domestic <b>merger</b> outcome whenever firms are sufficiently heterogeneous (in terms of productive efficiency and product differentiation). <b>A</b> domestic <b>merger</b> unfolds <b>a</b> wage-unifying effect which limits the union's ability to extract rents. When asymmetries among fims vanish, then cross-border mergers are the unique equilibrium. However, they may be either between symmetric or asymmetric firms. Social welfare is never higher under <b>a</b> domestic <b>merger</b> outcome than under <b>a</b> cross-border <b>merger</b> outcome...|$|R
