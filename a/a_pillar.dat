5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that human {{resources}} are <b>a</b> <b>pillar</b> of any research and innovation policy, the Medium Term Plan 2011–2015 did not discuss any explicit policy for promoting postgraduate studies {{in science and engineering}}. The scarcity of new PhDs in science and engineering fields from the University of Zimbabwe in 2013 was symptomatic of this omission.|$|E

5|$|St. Illtyd's church predates the Age of the Saints {{in early}} Welsh Christianity and thus {{by its very}} {{existence}} provides evidence of continuity with sub-Roman Christianity. The churchyard contains three ancient relics, <b>a</b> <b>pillar</b> and two inscribed stones; one dates from Saint Samson's time. The grounds also include a 13th-century gatehouse, a monks' pigeon-house, ruined walls in a garden area, and mounds near the vicarage.|$|E
5|$|The Harpy Tomb is {{a marble}} chamber from <b>a</b> <b>pillar</b> tomb {{that stands in}} the {{abandoned}} city of Xanthos, capital of ancient Lycia, a region of southwestern Anatolia {{in what is now}} Turkey. Dating to approximately 480–470BC, the chamber topped a tall pillar and was decorated with marble panels carved in bas-relief. It may be the tomb of Kybernis, a king of Xanthos.|$|E
5|$|Flambeau C (b. 1971) became <b>a</b> <b>pillar</b> of the French show jumping {{team in the}} 1980s.

The 1980s also saw the rise of Jappeloup (1975–1991), a small black horse with a {{conformation}} and gaits that were considered disadvantageous for show jumping. Despite this, he had an impressive jumping style, and won two French championships in 1982 and 1986, a European championship in 1987, several team medals at the European and World Championships, and a {{gold medal at the}} 1988 Summer Olympics with rider Pierre Durand, Jr.|$|E

40|$|A unique {{circumstance}} {{created by}} monitoring a pre-driven longwall recovery room permitted measuring {{the stresses of}} <b>a</b> coal <b>pillar</b> throughout its entire life cycle {{in less than a}} week. <b>A</b> fender <b>pillar,</b> created in approximately the middle of a longwall panel at a depth of 650 ft, transformed from <b>a</b> solid barrier <b>pillar</b> - to <b>a</b> yielding <b>pillar</b> - to <b>a</b> residual <b>pillar</b> as 3 ft slices were methodically removed with the longwall shearer. The complete transformation, or life cycle, took place in less than 12 hours. The stresses were quickly transferred from the pillar onto the standing pumpable concrete supports and into the outby pillars. Roof to floor closure measurements, combined with the timing of the <b>pillar</b> behavior, provides <b>a</b> detailed look at the uncontrollable convergence of underground mine openings. Pillars remain the most important form of primary support and understanding these life cycles is vital for safe and efficient mine design, in both room and pillar and longwall panel extractions...|$|R
5|$|Graves was <b>a</b> <b>pillar</b> of the Los Alamos community. He was {{an active}} member of the non-denominational Protestant Community Church. With the {{encouragement}} of Elizabeth, who played the violin, he learned to play the cello, hoarding his petrol ration stamps so that he could travel to Santa Fe, New Mexico, for lessons. He played in the Los Alamos Symphony, accompanying local performances of Gilbert and Sullivan and Handel's Messiah. He was chairman of the board of the local bank, and a member of the local school board.|$|E
5|$|Herodotus, {{the ancient}} Greek historian, {{documented}} women carrying large phallic shaped monuments and ornaments {{the size of}} a human body in villages in ancient Dionysia. On the island of Delos <b>a</b> <b>pillar</b> supports a colossal phallus, the symbol of Dionysus. Phallus reliefs on buildings on such sites are also believed to have been apotropaic devices to ward off evil. The elaborate use of phallic architecture and sculpture in ancient Greek society can also be seen in sites such as Nea Nikomedeia in northern Greece. Archaeologists excavating the ancient town discovered clay sculptures of plump women with phallic heads and folded arms.|$|E
5|$|At the Fountain, Blackbeard's crew {{is confronted}} by Barbossa {{and his men}} and they battle while Barbossa and Blackbeard fight. The Spanish {{suddenly}} arrive, intending to destroy the Fountain, believing its power an abomination against God. They crush the chalices and throw them in the swamp. When Barbossa stabs Blackbeard with a poisoned sword, Angelica pulls it out but is cut and poisoned. Jack notices Angelica is poisoned and begins frantically searching the swamp for the chalices. Barbossa obtains Blackbeard's magic sword and gains control of the Queen Anne's Revenge and her crew. Despite resistance from Blackbeard's crew, the Spanish successfully pull down <b>a</b> <b>pillar,</b> crushing the Fountain of Youth. The Spanish army leaves once the fountain is in ruins. Philip is mortally wounded, but he returns to free Syrena. She helps Jack retrieve the missing chalices and gives them to him, telling him not to waste her tear. Syrena {{goes back to the}} dying Philip. She says she can save him if he asks her to. When he asks for her forgiveness, she kisses him and takes him underwater.|$|E

5|$|Elements of the {{committee}} met with Lutyens in January 1919 to discuss options for the memorial. Lutyens argued against {{the committee}}'s initial proposed location on Asylum Green in favour of Watts Park, which the committee agreed to. Lutyen's initial design consisted of a large ceremonial pillar with a substantial archway on either side, each archway supporting a soldier lying on a sarcophagus. This was rejected due to the likely cost and instead Lutyens suggested a single empty sarcophagus or cenotaph, supported by a plinth on top of <b>a</b> <b>pillar,</b> with pine cones mounted on urns standing on each side. This was agreed to at a public meeting in September and detailed work on the project began. The London firm of Holloway Brothers were selected as the contractor for the memorial; the project was completed to time at a total cost of £9,845.|$|E
5|$|Even though Champollion {{was appalled}} by the rampant looting of ancient {{artefacts}} and destruction of monuments, the expedition {{also contributed to the}} destruction. Most notably, while studying the Valley of the Kings, he damaged KV17, the tomb of Seti I, by removing a wall panel of 2.26 x 1.05m in a corridor. English explorers attempted to dissuade the destruction of the tomb, but Champollion persisted, stating that he had the permission of the Muhammad Ali Pasha. Champollion also carved his name into <b>a</b> <b>pillar</b> at Karnak. In a letter to the Pasha recommended that tourism, excavation and trafficking of artefacts be strictly controlled. Champollion's suggestions may have led to Muhammad Ali's 1835 ordinance prohibiting all exports of antiquities and ordering the construction of a museum in which to house the ancient artifacts.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} millennium, the boar was worshipped {{as a symbol}} of virility. The Chalukya dynasty (543–753) was the first dynasty to adopt Varaha in their crest and minted coins with Varaha on it. The Gurjara-Pratihara king Mihira Bhoja (836–885 CE) assumed the title of Adi-varaha and also minted coins {{depicting}} the Varaha image. Varaha was also adopted as a part of royal insignia by the Chola (4th century BCE–1279 CE) and Vijayanagara Empires (1336–1646 CE) of South India. In Karnataka, a zoomorphic image of Varaha is found in a carving on <b>a</b> <b>pillar</b> in Aihole, which is interpreted as the Vijayanagara emblem, as it is seen along with signs of a cross marked Sun, a disc and a conch.|$|E

5|$|Liebknecht and Bernstein, {{like the}} left wing of the party, felt the general strike {{should not be used}} to provoke the state but rather to defend {{political}} rights (especially the right to vote) should the state seek to abolish them. The more conservative faction in the party was opposed to this concept. In 1904, Friedeberg, speaking for the FVdG, advanced the view that the general strike must be a weapon {{in the hands of the}} proletariat and would be the last step before the socialist revolution. In 1905, his speech on the topic was even more radical. He claimed that historical materialism, <b>a</b> <b>pillar</b> of Marxism, was to blame for social democracy's alleged powerlessness, and introduced the alternative concept of historical psychism—which held that human psychology was more significant for social development than material conditions. He also recommended the anarchist literature especially Kropotkin's writings rather than Marx's works, which were most influential in the SPD.|$|E
5|$|The Air Force tracks {{a larger}} UFO as it hovers over Townsend. The {{invisible}} alien enters Max's trailer and abducts him. When the agents visit the trailer and find Max missing, an Army radio transmission reveals {{that he has}} been transported to a waterfront. They race to save Max as Henderson's men scour the area searching for him. The alien kills two soldiers who encounter Max, causing him to flee into a warehouse. As Mulder finds Max inside, the building is surrounded by Henderson's forces. Mulder tries to comfort Max, but is attacked and injured by the alien. Mulder then sees Max floating in <b>a</b> <b>pillar</b> of light before vanishing. When Henderson finds that Max is missing, he orders Mulder arrested.|$|E
5|$|The game {{opens with}} {{a vision of the}} player's {{character}} wielding a blade of light to strike down a masked man in black robes. The vision is a dream the player has while on a carriage ride to their chosen starting city—Gridania, Ul'dah, or Limsa Lominsa. Players returning from the original release appear in a forest in <b>a</b> <b>pillar</b> of light—Louisoix's final spell to save their lives from the devastation at Carteneau. Through undertaking various odd jobs, the player character ingratiates him or herself with the local Adventurer's Guild and earns comparisons with the fabled Warriors of Light, brave adventurers who participated in the Battle of Carteneau whose identities have been mysteriously erased from the memories of all who knew them. A pattern emerges amid these quests involving a series of attacks by masked men, as well {{as a member of the}} Scions of the Seventh Dawn who claims to know the origin of the player's visions. The adventurer meets the leader of this secret society, Minfilia, who reveals that the visions are a manifestation of the Echo and mark the player as a chosen representative of Hydaelyn, the Mothercrystal.|$|E

5|$|This Amazon {{is famous}} in their traditions: her house or dairy of stone is yet extant; {{some of the}} {{inhabitants}} dwell in it all summer, though it be some hundred years old; the whole is built of stone, without any wood, lime, earth, or mortar to cement it, and is built in form of a circle pyramid-wise towards the top, having a vent in it, the fire being always in {{the centre of the}} floor; the stones are long and thin, which supplies the defect of wood; the body of this house contains not above nine persons sitting; there are three beds or low vaults that go {{off the side of the}} wall, <b>a</b> <b>pillar</b> betwixt each bed, which contains five men apiece; at the entry to one of these low vaults is a stone standing upon one end fix’d; upon this they say she ordinarily laid her helmet; there are two stones on the other side, upon which she is reported to have laid her sword: she is said to have been much addicted to hunting, and that in her time all the space betwixt this isle and that of Harries, was one continued tract of dry land.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{previous}} {{games in}} the series, which were more typical action role-playing games, Children of Mana is a dungeon crawler, {{and the majority of}} the gameplay takes place in selected locations rather than on an open world map. The player selects these areas on the world map to reach them. The primary objective in each location is to clear the dungeon of monsters. Each dungeon is divided into different randomly generated floors, and to progress between each zone, the player must find an item called a Gleamdrop, then carry it to <b>a</b> <b>pillar</b> of light called a Gleamwell. The player must repeat this process on each floor of the dungeon until the last floor is reached, where a boss monster lies. The player can not return to previous floors unless they die or leave the dungeon; upon returning, they start the dungeon over at the beginning. When not clearing dungeons, the player stays in the Mana Village, which contains shops to purchase equipment. Dungeons can be returned to later by accepting quests from townsfolk in the Dudbear shop. During these quests, the dungeon itself is slightly altered: the player's starting position may be different, the number of floors can change, and the monsters and boss monster contained may change. Like the main quests, Dudbear quests involve clearing the dungeon of monsters, sometimes to acquire an item {{from the end of the}} dungeon.|$|E
