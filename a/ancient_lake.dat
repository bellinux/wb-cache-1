5|$|The Red River had {{a history}} of {{seasonal}} flooding, aggravated by the broad <b>ancient</b> <b>lake</b> bed that formed the Red River Valley. The 1997 Red River Flood caused extensive damage in the city. Fargo was upstream from the bulk of the flood waters that season, and Winnipeg had built an extensive system of flood control structures in the 1960s. In 1997 Grand Forks suffered the most damage of any major city in the Red River Valley. During the height of the flooding, a major fire destroyed eleven buildings in the downtown area. The government began developing a new levee system to protect the city, which was completed ten years later. It required the relocation of numerous residents as some neighborhoods were emptied for this construction.|$|E

5|$|The oldest part of {{the temple}} was built in 652 by Songtsen Gampo. To find a {{location}} for the temple, the king reportedly tossed his hat (a ring in another version) ahead of him with a promise to build a temple where the hat landed. It landed in a lake, where a white stupa (memorial monument) suddenly emerged over which the temple was built. In another version of the legend, Queen Bhrikuti founded the temple to install the statue she had brought and Queen Wencheng selected the site according to Chinese geomancy and feng shui. The lake was filled, leaving a small pond now visible as a well fed by the <b>ancient</b> <b>lake,</b> and a temple {{was built on the}} filled area. Over the next nine centuries, the temple was enlarged; its last renovation was carried out in 1610 by the Fifth Dalai Lama.|$|E
5|$|As {{the first}} of these names indicates, the path was {{partially}} wooded, as its southern reaches crossed the transition zone between the western prairies and eastern woodland. From Fort Garry, southbound cart trains followed {{the eastern edge of the}} Red River's Great Plains, crossing the Roseau River and the international border. In Minnesota, the trail was joined by a route coming from Pembina to the northwest, and continued south on a level prairie in the former lakebed of prehistoric Lake Agassiz. It ascended to and followed a firm gravelly ridge which was once among the higher beaches or strandlines of that <b>ancient</b> <b>lake,</b> forded the Red Lake River at the Old Crossing near modern Huot, and angled south by southeast to the fur post at White Earth. At Otter Tail Lake, the route left the plains and turned east into a forest in the Leaf Mountains on the continental divide. Taking a difficult but scenic path east through the woods, the trail crossed the Mississippi River at Old Crow Wing. It then went south down the east bank of that river on a smooth and open glacial outwash sandplain to Sauk Rapids and East Saint Cloud.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAncient lakes {{are ideal}} model systems for {{evolutionary}} studies, as they hold hundreds of endemic species. The {{vast majority of}} these still occur in the cradle of their origin. We distinguish three different modes of speciation (allo-, para- and sympatric) which have occurred in these habitats. Although radiations from <b>ancient</b> <b>lakes</b> are generally assumed to be adaptive, we cannot fully support this point of view, because non-adaptive radiations also appear to be common, for example through chromosomal changes, hybridization or sexual selection. Even in supposedly adaptive cladogenesis, e. g. as concerns the presumed trophic adaptations of cichlid (Pisces) mouth and tooth shapes, both adaptive and non-adaptive components are acting. Distribution patterns of non-marine ostracods (Crustacea) within and outside of <b>ancient</b> <b>lakes</b> indicate that sexual reproduction might be an additional requirement for successful radiations in <b>ancient</b> <b>lakes,</b> at least in certain groups. This can best be understood by invoking ecology-based hypotheses on the evolutionary superiority of sexual reproduction such as Fisher–Muller accelerated evolution and the Tangled Bank...|$|R
25|$|Dog Canyon {{was carved}} into the basin fill {{materials}} of sand, silt and clay by heavy runoffs of earth and water from the surrounding mountains. The heavy rocks and fast moving waters carved the canyon out over millions of years. Lake Otero was formed by heavy snowmelt and rains during the late Pleistocene.

25|$|Baikal's age is {{estimated}} at 25 million years, making it the most <b>ancient</b> <b>lake</b> in geological history. It is unique among large, high-latitude lakes, as its sediments have not been scoured by overriding continental ice sheets. Russian, U.S., and Japanese cooperative studies of deep-drilling core sediments in the 1990s provide a detailed record of climatic variation over the past 6.7 million years. Longer and deeper sediment cores are expected in the near future. Lake Baikal is the only confined freshwater lake in which direct and indirect evidence of gas hydrates exists.|$|E
25|$|The {{location}} and terrain of Kathmandu {{have played a}} significant role in the development of a stable economy which spans millennia. The city is in an <b>ancient</b> <b>lake</b> basin, with fertile soil and flat terrain. This geography helped form a society based on agriculture. This, combined with its location between India and China, helped establish Kathmandu as an important trading center over the centuries. Kathmandu's trade is an ancient profession that flourished along an offshoot of the Silk Road which linked India and Tibet. From centuries past, Lhasa Newar merchants of Kathmandu have conducted trade across the Himalaya and contributed to spreading art styles and Buddhism across Central Asia. Other traditional occupations are farming, metal casting, woodcarving, painting, weaving, and pottery.|$|E

40|$|Food webs may be {{affected}} by evolutionary processes, and effective evolutionary time ultimately affects the probability of species evolving to fill the niche space. Thus, ecosystem history may set important evolutionary constraints on community composition and food web structure. Food chain length (FCL) has long been recognized as a fundamental ecosystem attribute. We examined historical effects on FCL in large lakes spanning > 6 orders of magnitude in age. We found that food chains in the world’s <b>ancient</b> <b>lakes</b> (n =  8) were significantly shorter than in recently formed lakes (n =  10) and reservoirs (n =  3), {{despite the fact that}} <b>ancient</b> <b>lakes</b> harbored much higher species richness, including many endemic species. One potential factor leading to shorter FCL in <b>ancient</b> <b>lakes</b> is an increasing diversity of trophic omnivores and herbivores. Speciation could simply broaden the number of species within a trophic group, particularly at lower trophic levels and could also lead to a greater degree of trophic omnivory. Our results highlight a counter-intuitive and poorly-understood role of evolutionary history in shaping key food web properties such as FCL...|$|R

25|$|Amphipods {{are found}} in almost all aquatic environments, from fresh water to water with twice the {{salinity}} of sea water. They are almost always {{an important component of}} aquatic ecosystems, often acting as mesograzers. Most species in the suborder Gammaridea are epibenthic, although they are often collected in plankton samples. Members of the Hyperiidea are all planktonic and marine. Many are symbionts of gelatinous animals, including salps, medusae, siphonophores, colonial radiolarians and ctenophores, and most hyperiids are associated with gelatinous animals during some part of their life cycle. Some 1,900 species, or 20% of the total amphipod diversity, live in fresh water or other non-marine waters.

25|$|The {{creation}} of the Lake Superior basin reflects the erosive power of continental glaciers that advanced and retreated over Minnesota {{several times in the}} past 2 million years. Lake Superior was shaped by the geology of the Midcontinent Rift. The mile-thick ice sheets easily eroded the loosely cemented sandstone that filled the axis of the rift valley, but encountered more resistance from the igneous rocks forming the flanks of the rift, now the margins of the lake basin. In the final retreat of the ice from the Lake Superior basin about 11,000 years ago, meltwaters filled the rift's scoured-out sandy core. As the last glacier retreated, meltwaters filled the lake to as high as 500 feet above the current level; the Skyline Parkway roughly follows one of {{the highest levels of the}} <b>ancient</b> <b>Lake</b> Superior, Glacial Lake Duluth.|$|E
25|$|Western Utah {{is mostly}} arid desert with a basin and range topography. Small {{mountain}} ranges and rugged terrain punctuate the landscape. The Bonneville Salt Flats are an exception, being comparatively {{flat as a}} result of once forming the bed of <b>ancient</b> <b>Lake</b> Bonneville. Great Salt Lake, Utah Lake, Sevier Lake, and Rush Lake are all remnants of this ancient freshwater lake, which once covered most of the eastern Great Basin. West of the Great Salt Lake, stretching to the Nevada border, lies the arid Great Salt Lake Desert. One exception to this aridity is Snake Valley, which is (relatively) lush due to large springs and wetlands fed from groundwater derived from snow melt in the Snake Range, Deep Creek Range, and other tall mountains to the west of Snake Valley. Great Basin National Park is just over the Nevada state line in the southern Snake Range. One of western Utah's most impressive, but least visited attractions is Notch Peak, the tallest limestone cliff in North America, located west of Delta.|$|E

40|$|The Balkans are justifiably {{famous for}} being natural {{hotspots}} of floral and faunal biodiversity and endemism. Much of this biological diversity is witnessed in the <b>ancient</b> <b>lakes</b> that exist (or previously existed) in the region, which have provided stable, long-lived arenas within which evolutionary processes {{have been able}} to operate. One group that ably demonstrate such diversity are the gastropod molluscs. Their wide dispersal, morphological variability and relative ease of identification make them ideal candidates for addressing questions concerning patterns and processes of biodiversity and evolution over time (e. g. Michel, 1996). Furthermore, {{the fact that they are}} often well preserved in fossil sequences means that they can provide a temporal dimension to evolutionary investigation, something that is often difficult to resolve when using groups more traditionally associated with this kind of work, such as the cichlid fishes. The molluscan faunas of the Balkans (and Greece in particular) have been the subject of study for at least the last two centuries (e. g. Butot & Welter-Schultes 1994). Isolated <b>ancient</b> <b>lakes</b> from the region, and in particular Ohrid, have often been a focus for detailed investigation, because of their remarkable endemic faunas (e. g. Hadzisce, 1956; Hubendick & Radoman, 1959; Stankovic, 1960; Meier-Brook, 1983; Stankovic, 1985; Schtt, 1987; Sattmann & Reischtz, 1988; Dhora & Welter-Schultes, 1996). Despite this, the malacology of many other key localities from the area still remains poorly documented. In this paper we first briefly review the main controls thought to influence the radiation of gastropods in <b>ancient</b> <b>lakes</b> and then present the modern and fossil aquatic molluscan fauna from a typical but previously poorly known site: Lake Pamvotis, located in the Ioannina Basin in NW Greece. Comparisons are then drawn with the gastropod fauna derived from other extant and fossil <b>ancient</b> <b>lakes</b> from across the Balkan region (bivalves are considered by Korniushin elsewhere in this volume), before highlighting some common patterns and providing some thoughts on the implications for speciation in <b>ancient</b> Balkan <b>lake</b> systems...|$|R
25|$|The {{main part}} of the Muisca {{civilisation}} was concentrated on the Bogotá savanna, a flat high plain in the Eastern Ranges of the Andes, far away from the Caribbean coast. The savanna was an <b>ancient</b> <b>lake,</b> that existed until the latest Pleistocene and formed a highly fertile soil for their agriculture. The Muisca were a deeply religious civilisation with a polytheistic society and an advanced astronomical knowledge, which was represented in their complex lunisolar calendar. Man and women had specific and different tasks in their relatively egalitarian society; while the women took care of the sowing, preparation of food, the extraction of salt, and the elaboration of mantles and pottery, the men were assigned to harvesting, warfare and hunting. The guecha warriors were tasked with the defence of the Muisca territories, mainly against their western neighbours; the Muzo ("Emerald People") and the bellicose Panche. To impress their enemies, the Muisca warriors wore mummies of important ancestors on their backs, while fighting. In their battles, the men used spears, poisoned arrows and golden knives.|$|E
