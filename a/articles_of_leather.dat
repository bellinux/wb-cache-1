40|$|ABSTRACT Relating the {{collected}} customs {{duty to the}} value of imports enables the estimation of a rate of applied duty that takes into account all pricing components and their use. Indeed, this ad valorem equivalent integrates the complex dimensions of customs duties, the measures of exemption and suspension, and those concerning preferential regimes. Processing collected duties for all the products reveals that the 1. 5 per cent rate of duty actually applied in 2003 is the same for the EU and the US. Nevertheless, it appears that the US taxes more the least developed countries (LDCs) and developing countries than does the EU. Thus, setting aside those products which enter free of duty, the rate of taxation applied by the US is 15 per cent and 6. 2 per cent respectively with regards to LDCs and developing countries, whereas in the EU it is only 3. 7 per cent and 4. 1 per cent. In the US market the sectors that are the most highly taxed upon importation are textiles, apparel and clothing, cotton and <b>articles</b> <b>of</b> <b>leather,</b> whereas in the EU it is more agricultural and food products (fruits and preserves, meats, sugars and cereals).

The most of discovered masonry was founded on massive wooden stilts and beams. The extant cutting of one of the stilts was sent to dendrochronological analysis (discover date 1328 +x). Altogether 268 archaeological finds were discovered.

The main Herero group in central Namibia (sometimes called Herero proper) was heavily influenced by Western culture during the colonial period, creating a whole new identity. The Herero proper and their southern counterparts the Mbanderu, for instance, wear garments similar to those worn by colonial Europeans (see photo at top <b>of</b> <b>article).</b> Traditional <b>leather</b> garments are worn by northwestern groups, such as the Himba, Kuvale, and Tjimba, who are also more conservative in other aspects such as not buying bedding, but rather sleep in bedding made of cow skin. The Kaokoland Herero and those in Angola have remained isolated and are still pastoral nomads, practicing limited horticulture.|$|R

50|$|After the Hebrews had {{acquired}} {{the art of}} tanning, which must have been at an early date, leather came {{to be used for}} a number of other purposes. Among <b>articles</b> <b>of</b> clothing it was employed chiefly for sandals. Leather girdles are also mentioned (II Kings i. 8 et al.). The warrior had a leather Helmet to protect his head, and his Shield also was usually <b>of</b> <b>leather.</b> For utensils in daily use leather is principally employed among nomads, as it was among the ancient Israelites, since receptacles <b>of</b> <b>leather</b> are not liable to be broken and are easily carried about. The original form of a table, as the word indicates, was a piece <b>of</b> <b>leather,</b> which was spread upon the ground. Pails and all other vessels for holding liquids were made <b>of</b> <b>leather.</b> The leather bucket for drawing water out of a well and the <b>leather</b> flask—consisting <b>of</b> a single skin removed from the animal's carcass as intact as possible—for holding wine or for transporting water have remained in common use in the Orient down to the present day. Skins of goats and sheep were generally used for these various purposes; more seldom, those of oxen. Concerning tanning, although it was probably familiar to the Hebrews from the oldest times, nothing is said in the Old Testament. Not once is a tanner mentioned.|$|R

40|$|The {{vegetable}} tanned leather is {{very famous}} for the its wonderful and unmistakable odour. In general terms the odour {{can be defined as}} any emanation perceived by sense of smell; practically the odorous substances have to be sufficiently volatile for being inhaled and for coming to be counted with the receptors of the nasal mucosa. In other words, the odour is connected to the emanation of volatile substances, therefore the knowledge of such substances can contribute to define the responsible components of the perceived odour. In a previous research, it has been demonstrated that the gas-chromatography with a mass spectrometer detector (GC/MS), coupled to the Purge & Trap technique, is a valid analytical approach for the identification of volatile compounds in the leather. Therefore in this study, such technique bas been employed {{for the study of the}} volatile substances rising from vegetable tanned leathers.

40|$|Leather is {{a natural}} {{material}} with many applications: automotive, domestic upholstery, buildings, aviation, maritime, personal safety, etc. For each of these sectors, fire behavior is a field of particular interest. Unfortunately, there are many testing methods and different flammability standards depending on material application and end use.

In this work, different approaches for analyzing the fire resistance <b>of</b> <b>leather</b> are examined: (i) influence {{of the type of}} tannage, (ii) influence of the type <b>of</b> <b>leather,</b> (iii) influence <b>of</b> the type of retannage, (iv) influence of the type of fatliquor, and (v) influence of the use of flame retardants. The results indicate that leather presents natural fire resistance.
