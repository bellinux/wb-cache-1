5|$|The {{most common}} set of catabolic {{reactions}} in animals can be separated into three main stages. In the first stage, large organic molecules, such as proteins, polysaccharides or lipids, are digested into their smaller components outside cells. Next, these smaller molecules are taken up by cells and converted to smaller molecules, usually <b>acetyl</b> coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), which releases some energy. Finally, the <b>acetyl</b> group on the CoA is oxidised to water and {{carbon dioxide in the}} citric acid cycle and electron transport chain, releasing the energy that is stored by reducing the coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) into NADH.|$|E
5|$|In the first, the {{standard}} and more robust scheme (Figure), Bz (benzoyl) protection {{is used for}} A, dA, C, and dC, while G and dG are protected with isobutyryl group. More recently, Ac (<b>acetyl)</b> group is used to protect C and dC as shown in Figure.|$|E
5|$|In the second, mild {{protection}} scheme, A and dA {{are protected}} with isobutyryl or phenoxyacetyl groups (PAC). C and dC bear <b>acetyl</b> protection, and G and dG are protected with 4-isopropylphenoxyacetyl (iPr-PAC) or dimethylformamidino (dmf) groups. Mild protecting groups are removed {{more readily than}} the standard protecting groups. However, the phosphoramidites bearing these groups are less stable when stored in solution.|$|E
5|$|The name {{actinium}} originates {{from the}} Ancient Greek aktis, aktinos (ακτίς, ακτίνος), meaning beam or ray. Its symbol Ac {{is also used}} in abbreviations of other compounds {{that have nothing to}} do with actinium, such as <b>acetyl,</b> acetate and sometimes acetaldehyde.|$|E
5|$|The same triad {{has also}} convergently evolved in α/β hydrolases such as some lipases and esterases, however {{orientation}} of the triad members is reversed. Additionally, brain <b>acetyl</b> hydrolase (which has the same fold as a small G-protein) has also {{been found to have}} this triad. The equivalent Serine-Histidine-Glutamate triad is used in acetylcholinesterase.|$|E
5|$|As much as 80% of {{therapeutic}} doses of salicylic acid is metabolized in the liver. Conjugation with glycine forms salicyluric acid, and with glucuronic acid to form two different glucuronide esters. The conjugate with the <b>acetyl</b> group intact {{is referred to}} as the acyl glucuronide; the deacetylated conjugate is the phenolic glucuronide. These metabolic pathways have only a limited capacity. Small amounts of salicylic acid are also hydroxylated to gentisic acid. With large salicylate doses, the kinetics switch from first-order to zero-order, as metabolic pathways become saturated and renal excretion becomes increasingly important.|$|E
5|$|Generally, in {{cabinets}} or {{display cases}} that are entirely or partially made of wood, the hydrolysis of <b>acetyl</b> groups in the wood hemicelluloses creates acetic acid. The {{rate at which the}} acetic acid is produced is proportional to the concentration of esters in the wood, the humidity, the temperature, and the overall acidity of the environment. Acidic fumes can also be released from formaldehyde which can occur in wood as a degradation product of lignin. Acidic fumes can also be given off from ubiquitous formaldehyde resins (commonly urea-formaldehyde resins).|$|E
5|$|NAD is also {{consumed}} by sirtuins, which are NAD-dependent deacetylases, such as Sir2. These enzymes act by transferring an <b>acetyl</b> group from their substrate protein to the ADP-ribose moiety of NAD; this cleaves the coenzyme and releases nicotinamide and O-acetyl-ADP-ribose. The sirtuins mainly {{seem to be}} involved in regulating transcription through deacetylating histones and altering nucleosome structure. However, non-histone proteins can be deacetylated by sirtuins as well. These activities of sirtuins are particularly interesting because of their importance in the regulation of aging.|$|E
5|$|Nicotinamide adenine {{dinucleotide}} {{has several}} essential roles in metabolism. It {{acts as a}} coenzyme in redox reactions, as a donor of ADP-ribose moieties in ADP-ribosylation reactions, as a precursor of the second messenger molecule cyclic ADP-ribose, as well as acting as a substrate for bacterial DNA ligases {{and a group of}} enzymes called sirtuins that use NAD to remove <b>acetyl</b> groups from proteins. In addition to these metabolic functions, NAD+ emerges as an adenine nucleotide that can be released from cells spontaneously and by regulated mechanisms, and can therefore have important extracellular roles.|$|E
5|$|Polyketides are {{synthesized}} by polymerization of <b>acetyl</b> and propionyl subunits by classic enzymes {{as well as}} iterative and multimodular {{enzymes that}} share mechanistic features with the fatty acid synthases. They comprise {{a large number of}} secondary metabolites and natural products from animal, plant, bacterial, fungal and marine sources, and have great structural diversity. Many polyketides are cyclic molecules whose backbones are often further modified by glycosylation, methylation, hydroxylation, oxidation, or other processes. Many commonly used anti-microbial, anti-parasitic, and anti-cancer agents are polyketides or polyketide derivatives, such as erythromycins, tetracyclines, avermectins, and antitumor epothilones.|$|E
5|$|The <b>acetyl</b> group, {{formally}} {{derived from}} acetic acid, {{is fundamental to}} all forms of life. When bound to coenzyme A, it {{is central to the}} metabolism of carbohydrates and fats. Unlike longer-chain carboxylic acids (the fatty acids), acetic acid does not occur in natural triglycerides. However, the artificial triglyceride triacetin (glycerine triacetate) is a common food additive and is found in cosmetics and topical medicines.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} of ethylenediamine dihydroiodide, provided as a nutritional supplement for livestock, consumes {{a large portion}} of available iodine. Another significant use is a catalyst for the {{production of}} acetic acid by the Monsanto and Cativa processes. In these technologies, which support the world's demand for acetic acid, hydroiodic acid converts the methanol feedstock into methyl iodide, which undergoes carbonylation. Hydrolysis of the resulting <b>acetyl</b> iodide regenerates hydroiodic acid and gives acetic acid.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{is readily}} broken {{down in the}} body to {{salicylic}} acid, which itself has anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, and analgesic effects. In 2012, salicylic acid was found to activate AMP-activated protein kinase, which has been suggested as a possible explanation {{for some of the}} effects of both salicylic acid and aspirin. The <b>acetyl</b> portion of the aspirin molecule has its own targets. Acetylation of cellular proteins is a well-established phenomenon in the regulation of protein function at the post-translational level. Aspirin is able to acetylate several other targets in addition to COX isoenzymes. These acetylation reactions may explain many hitherto unexplained effects of aspirin.|$|E
5|$|Coenzymes {{are small}} organic {{molecules}} {{that can be}} loosely or tightly bound to an enzyme. Coenzymes transport chemical groups from one enzyme to another. Examples include NADH, NADPH and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Some coenzymes, such as flavin mononucleotide (FMN), flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), and tetrahydrofolate (THF), are derived from vitamins. These coenzymes cannot be synthesized by the body de novo and closely related compounds (vitamins) must be acquired from the diet. The chemical groups carried include the hydride ion (H−) carried by NAD or NADP+, the phosphate group carried by adenosine triphosphate, the <b>acetyl</b> group carried by coenzyme A, formyl, methenyl or methyl groups carried by folic acid and the methyl group carried by S-adenosylmethionine.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin, in {{the form}} of leaves from the willow tree, has been used for its health effects for at least 2,400 years. In 1853, chemist Charles Frédéric Gerhardt treated sodium {{salicylate}} with <b>acetyl</b> chloride to produce acetylsalicylic acid for the first time. In {{the second half of the}} nineteenth century, other chemists established the chemical structure and came up with more efficient methods to make it. In 1897, scientists at Bayer began studying acetylsalicylic acid as a less-irritating replacement for common salicylate medicines. By 1899, Bayer had named the drug Aspirin and was selling it around the world. The word Aspirin was Bayer's brand name; however, their rights to the trademark were lost or sold in many countries. Aspirin's popularity grew over the first half of the twentieth century leading to competition between many brands and formulations.|$|E
5|$|In 1853, chemist Charles Frédéric Gerhardt treated <b>acetyl</b> {{chloride}} with {{sodium salicylate}} to produce acetylsalicylic acid {{for the first}} time; {{in the second half}} of the nineteenth century, other academic chemists established the compound's chemical structure and devised more efficient methods of synthesis. In 1897, scientists at the drug and dye firm Bayer began investigating acetylsalicylic acid as a less-irritating replacement for standard common salicylate medicines, and identified a new way to synthesize it. By 1899, Bayer had dubbed this drug Aspirin and was selling it around the world. The word Aspirin was Bayer's brand name, rather than the generic name of the drug; however, Bayer's rights to the trademark were lost or sold in many countries. Aspirin's popularity grew over the first half of the twentieth century leading to fierce competition with the proliferation of aspirin brands and products.|$|E
5|$|In animals, {{when there}} is an {{oversupply}} of dietary carbohydrate, the excess carbohydrate is converted to triglycerides. This involves the synthesis of fatty acids from acetyl-CoA and the esterification of fatty acids in the production of triglycerides, a process called lipogenesis. Fatty acids are made by fatty acid synthases that polymerize and then reduce acetyl-CoA units. The acyl chains in the fatty acids are extended by a cycle of reactions that add the <b>acetyl</b> group, reduce it to an alcohol, dehydrate it to an alkene group and then reduce it again to an alkane group. The enzymes of fatty acid biosynthesis are divided into two groups, in animals and fungi all these fatty acid synthase reactions are carried out by a single multifunctional protein, while in plant plastids and bacteria separate enzymes perform each step in the pathway. The fatty acids may be subsequently converted to triglycerides that are packaged in lipoproteins and secreted from the liver.|$|E
5|$|Polymorphism, or {{the ability}} of a {{substance}} to form more than one crystal structure, is important in the development of pharmaceutical ingredients. Many drugs are receiving regulatory approval for only a single crystal form or polymorph. For a long time, only one crystal structure for aspirin was known. That aspirin might have a second crystalline form was suspected since the 1960s. The elusive second polymorph was first discovered by Vishweshwar and coworkers in 2005, and fine structural details were given by Bond et al. A new crystal type was found after attempted cocrystallization of aspirin and levetiracetam from hot acetonitrile. The form II is only stable at 100K and reverts to form I at ambient temperature. In the (unambiguous) form I, two salicylic molecules form centrosymmetric dimers through the <b>acetyl</b> groups with the (acidic) methyl proton to carbonyl hydrogen bonds, and in the newly claimed form II, each salicylic molecule forms the same hydrogen bonds with two neighboring molecules instead of one. With respect to the hydrogen bonds formed by the carboxylic acid groups, both polymorphs form identical dimer structures.|$|E
5|$|Phytochemistry is {{a branch}} of plant {{biochemistry}} primarily concerned with the chemical substances produced by plants during secondary metabolism. Some of these compounds are toxins such as the alkaloid coniine from hemlock. Others, such as the essential oils peppermint oil and lemon oil are useful for their aroma, as flavourings and spices (e.g., capsaicin), and in medicine as pharmaceuticals as in opium from opium poppies. Many medicinal and recreational drugs, such as tetrahydrocannabinol (active ingredient in cannabis), caffeine, morphine and nicotine come directly from plants. Others are simple derivatives of botanical natural products. For example, the pain killer aspirin is the <b>acetyl</b> ester of salicylic acid, originally isolated from the bark of willow trees, and {{a wide range of}} opiate painkillers like heroin are obtained by chemical modification of morphine obtained from the opium poppy. Popular stimulants come from plants, such as caffeine from coffee, tea and chocolate, and nicotine from tobacco. Most alcoholic beverages come from fermentation of carbohydrate-rich plant products such as barley (beer), rice (sake) and grapes (wine). Native Americans have used various plants as ways of treating illness or disease for thousands of years. This knowledge Native Americans have on plants has been recorded by enthnobotanists and then in turn has been used by pharmaceutical companies as a way of drug discovery.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanism}} for acetylation and deacetylation {{takes place on}} the NH3+ groups of Lysine amino acid residues. These residues are located on the tails of histones {{that make up the}} nucleosome of packaged dsDNA. The process is aided by factors known as Histone Acetyltransferases (HATs). HAT molecules facilitate the transfer of an <b>acetyl</b> group from a molecule of <b>Acetyl</b> Coenzyme-A (Acetyl-CoA) to the NH3+ group on Lysine. When a Lysine is deacetylated, factors known as Histone Deacetylases (HDACs) catalyze the removal of the <b>acetyl</b> group with a molecule of H2O.|$|E
25|$|The {{simplest}} {{acyl chloride}} is ethanoyl chloride or <b>acetyl</b> chloride; methanoyl chloride is not stable.|$|E
25|$|Homoserine is then {{activated}} with an phosphate, succinyl or <b>acetyl</b> {{group on}} the hydroxyl.|$|E
25|$|The Darzens–Nenitzescu {{synthesis}} of ketones (1910, 1936) involves the acylation of cyclohexene with <b>acetyl</b> chloride to methylcyclohexenylketone.|$|E
25|$|The {{pharmacology}} {{of heroin}} and morphine is identical except the two <b>acetyl</b> groups increase the lipid solubility of the heroin molecule, causing heroin {{to cross the}} blood–brain barrier and enter the brain more rapidly in injection. Once in the brain, these <b>acetyl</b> groups are removed to yield morphine, which causes the subjective effects of heroin. Thus, heroin may {{be thought of as}} a more rapidly acting form of morphine.|$|E
25|$|Salicylic acid has {{the formula}} C6H4(OH)COOH, where the OH group is ortho to the {{carboxyl}} group. It {{is also known}} as 2-hydroxybenzoic acid. It is poorly soluble in water (2 g/L at 20°C). Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid or ASA) can be prepared by the esterification of the phenolic hydroxyl group of salicylic acid with the <b>acetyl</b> group from acetic anhydride or <b>acetyl</b> chloride. Salicylic acid can also be prepared using the Kolbe-Schmitt reaction.|$|E
25|$|Ethanol can be {{oxidized}} to acetaldehyde {{and further}} oxidized to acetic acid, {{depending on the}} reagents and conditions. This oxidation is of no importance industrially, but in the human body, these oxidation reactions are catalyzed by the enzyme liver alcohol dehydrogenase. The oxidation product of ethanol, acetic acid, is a nutrient for humans, being a precursor to <b>acetyl</b> CoA, where the <b>acetyl</b> group can be spent as energy or used for biosynthesis.|$|E
25|$|The {{pyruvate}} {{produced by}} glycolysis {{is an important}} intermediary in the conversion of carbohydrates into fatty acids and cholesterol. This occurs via the conversion of pyruvate into acetyl-CoA in the mitochondrion. However, this <b>acetyl</b> CoA needs to be transported into cytosol where the synthesis of fatty acids and cholesterol occurs. This cannot occur directly. To obtain cytosolic acetyl-CoA, citrate (produced by the condensation of <b>acetyl</b> CoA with oxaloacetate) {{is removed from the}} citric acid cycle and carried across the inner mitochondrial membrane into the cytosol. There it is cleaved by ATP citrate lyase into acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate. The oxaloacetate can be used for gluconeogenesis (in the liver), or it can be returned into mitochondrion as malate. The cytosolic acetyl-CoA is carboxylated by <b>acetyl</b> CoA carboxylase into malonyl CoA, the first committed step in the synthesis of fatty acids.|$|E
25|$|This NatA complex can {{associate}} with the ribosome and catalyzes the transfer of an <b>acetyl</b> group to the Nα-terminal amino group of proteins as they emerge from the exit tunnel.|$|E
25|$|A {{chemical}} synthesis of captopril by treatment of L-proline with (2S)-3-acetylthio-2-methylpropanoyl chloride under basic conditions (NaOH), followed by aminolysis of the protective <b>acetyl</b> group to unmask the drug's free thiol, {{is depicted in}} the figure at right.|$|E
25|$|The {{resulting}} acetyl-CoA {{enters the}} citric acid cycle (or Krebs Cycle), where the <b>acetyl</b> {{group of the}} acetyl-CoA is converted into carbon dioxide by two decarboxylation reactions {{with the formation of}} yet more intra-mitochondrial NADH + H+.|$|E
25|$|Another {{implication}} of histone acetylation {{is to provide}} a platform for protein binding. As a posttranslational modification, the acetylation of histones can attract proteins to elongated chromatin that has been marked by <b>acetyl</b> groups. It has been hypothesized that the histone tails offer recognition sites that attract proteins responsible for transcriptional activation. Unlike histone core proteins, histone tails {{are not part of the}} nucleosome core and are exposed to protein interaction. A model proposed that the acetylation of H3 histones activates gene transcription by attracting other transcription related complexes. Therefore, the <b>acetyl</b> mark provides a site for protein recognition where transcription factors interact with the acetylated histone tails via their bromodomain.|$|E
25|$|In the {{citric acid}} cycle all the {{intermediates}} (e.g. citrate, iso-citrate, alpha-ketoglutarate, succinate, fumarate, malate and oxaloacetate) are regenerated during each {{turn of the}} cycle. Adding more {{of any of these}} intermediates to the mitochondrion therefore means that that additional amount is retained within the cycle, increasing all the other intermediates as one is converted into the other. Hence the addition of oxaloacetate greatly increases the amounts of all the citric acid intermediates, thereby increasing the cycle's capacity to metabolize <b>acetyl</b> CoA, converting its acetate component into CO2 and water, with the release of enough energy to form 11 ATP and 1 GTP molecule for each additional molecule of <b>acetyl</b> CoA that combines with oxaloacetate in the cycle.|$|E
25|$|Ferrocene {{undergoes}} many reactions {{characteristic of}} aromatic compounds, enabling {{the preparation of}} substituted derivatives. A common undergraduate experiment is the Friedel-Crafts reaction of ferrocene with acetic anhydride (or <b>acetyl</b> chloride) {{in the presence of}} phosphoric acid as a catalyst.|$|E
25|$|Glucose-6-phosphate enters glycolytic pathway and then, via the {{pyruvate}} carboxylase reaction, into the Krebs cycle, where multiple, high-energy ATP molecules {{are produced by}} the oxidation of <b>acetyl</b> CoA (the Krebs cycle substrate), leading to {{a rise in the}} ATP:ADP ratio within the cell.|$|E
25|$|Together {{with its}} {{auxiliary}} subunit Naa15, Naa10 constitutes the NatA (Nα-acetyltransferase A) complex that specifically catalyzes {{the transfer of}} an <b>acetyl</b> group from acetyl-CoA to the N-terminal primary amino group of certain proteins. In higher eukaryotes, 5 other N-acetyltransferase (NAT) complexes, NatB-NatF, have been described that differ both in substrate specificity and subunit composition.|$|E
25|$|In many {{industrial}} wastewater treatment plants, EDTA elimination {{can be achieved}} at about 80% using microorganisms. Resulting byproducts are ED3A and IDA – suggesting that both the backbone and <b>acetyl</b> groups were attacked. Some microorganisms have even been discovered to form nitrates out of EDTA but degrade optimally at moderately alkaline conditions of pH 9.0–9.5.|$|E
