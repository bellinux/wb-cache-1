5|$|Adams {{is home to}} {{the oldest}} {{building}} on the Gifford Pinchot National Forest, the Gotchen Creek Guard Station just south of the A. G. Aiken Lava Bed. Built in 1909, it served as the administrative headquarters of the Mount Adams District until 1916. It was built along a major grazing trail to allow for easy monitoring of the thousands of sheep grazed on the lower slopes. Later, in the 1940s, as the amount of grazing decreased, the station housed the Forest Guards responsible for the area. In 2008, it was wrapped in protective foil as a precautionary method to shield it from a large wildfire, the Cold Springs Fire, although the fire did not come near enough to burn it. Wildfires in 2012 (Cascade Creek Fire) and 2015 (Cougar Creek Fire) also required this precaution, <b>and</b> <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> them came close enough either.|$|E
5|$|As I {{was reading}} about Cope and Marsh, I ran across Knight as {{something}} of a bit player in their lives. As I got further into the Cope and Marsh story, and I liked the two less and less as people—which is different from liking them as characters, of course—I wanted to have a character in the book for the readers to root for, <b>and</b> <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> the scientists could fill that role. When I found out that Knight had met Cope just before Cope died, I became convinced that he was the character I needed.|$|E
5|$|Protected against double jeopardy, Bryant and Milam {{struck a}} deal with Look {{magazine}} in 1956 to tell their story to journalist William Bradford Huie for between $3,600 and $4,000. The interview took place in the law firm of the attorneys who had defended Bryant and Milam. Huie did not ask the questions; Bryant and Milam's own attorneys did. Neither attorney had heard their clients' accounts of the murder before. According to Huie, the older Milam was more articulate and sure of himself than the younger Bryant. Milam admitted to shooting Till <b>and</b> <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> them believed they were guilty or that they had done anything wrong.|$|E

5|$|In late 1959, James Lawson {{and other}} members of the NCLC's {{projects}} committee met with department store owners Fred Harvey and John Sloan, and asked them to voluntarily serve African Americans at their lunch counters. Both men declined, saying that they would lose more business than they would gain. The students then began doing reconnaissance for sit-in demonstrations. The first test took place at Harveys Department Store in downtown Nashville on November 28, followed by the Cain-Sloan store on December 5. Small groups of students purchased items at the stores and then sat at their lunch counters and attempted to order food. Their goal was to try to sense the mood and degree of resistance in each store. Although they were refused service at both lunch counters, the reactions varied significantly. At Harveys, they received surprisingly polite responses, while at Cain-Sloan they were treated with contempt. These reconnaissance actions were low-key <b>and</b> <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> the city's newspapers was notified of them.|$|E
5|$|The Duke of Kent died quite {{suddenly}} in 1820, followed quickly by his father, King George III. Victoria's uncle, the Prince Regent, ascended the throne as King George IV. Victoria was now third {{in line to}} the throne, after her uncles the Duke of York and the Duke of Clarence, {{both of whom were}} well past middle age <b>and</b> <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> whom had legitimate heirs. As the likely eventual heir, Victoria had to be educated accordingly. Feodora was now 14, and no longer required the services of a governess. After the dismissal of nursemaid Mrs. Brock, Lehzen – as she was always known in the household – took over five-year-old Victoria's care in 1824. The Duchess and her comptroller, John Conroy made the appointment not only because Lehzen was German (rather than English), but also because they believed she was unlikely to operate independently of their wishes.|$|E
25|$|Despite MacDonald's promise PR never {{received}} the necessary capital <b>and</b> <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> Pole's proposed lines was ever built by Palestine Railways. The only extension that Pole recommended and PR did build {{was a short}} extension for freight from Jaffa station to the harbour. Jaffa harbour was so constrained by hazardous rocks that only small vessels dared to enter it; ocean-going cargo ships would lie off-shore and transfer their freight to or from the docks by lighters. Pole's recommendation to rebuild the harbour was not implemented, so as a result PR's new freight line received little use.|$|E

Pang De later duelled with Guan Yu again and he feigned defeat and retreated after about 50 rounds. When Guan Yu pursued him, he suddenly turned around and fired an arrow, which hit Guan in the left arm. Pang De {{wanted to use the}} opportunity to attack but Yu Jin (who was his superior) stopped him.|$|E
25|$|Doven {{began to}} take on more {{influential}} film production roles in Cruise's movies – serving as Production Associate on the 1999 film Magnolia. He subsequently served in an increased capacity as Associate Producer on the 2000 film , the 2001 film Vanilla Sky, the 2002 film Minority Report, and the 2003 film The Last Samurai. Doven accompanied Cruise's family when they stayed in Taranaki, New Zealand during film production of The Last Samurai. Doven {{and his wife were}} not invited to Cruise's 2006 wedding to Katie Holmes in Rome, Italy, <b>and</b> <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> the Dovens have subsequently had film credits on movies relating to Cruise since the wedding.|$|E
25|$|Allen {{auditioned for}} the eighth season of American Idol in Louisville, Kentucky, with his brother Daniel, who {{did not make it}} to Hollywood. In {{the early stages of the}} season, he was among the finalists (along with Allison Iraheta) that {{received}} the least amount of screen time. Only several seconds of his first audition (<b>and</b> <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> his Hollywood Week solo performances) were shown, although his group performance with White Chocolate (including fellow finalist Matt Giraud) was aired in its entirety. The judges also asked him to participate in an un-aired sing-off with another contestant before they allowed him to enter the semifinals round.|$|E

25|$|The {{defeat of}} the crusaders allowed Kilij Arslan to {{establish}} his capital at Konya, and also proved to the Muslim world that the crusaders were not invincible, as {{they appeared to be}} during the First Crusade. The crusaders and Byzantines each blamed the other for the defeat, <b>and</b> <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> them were able to ensure a safe route through Anatolia now that Kilij Arslan had strengthened his position. The only open route to the Holy Land was the sea route, which benefitted the Italian maritime republics. The lack of a safe land route from Constantinople also benefitted the Principality of Antioch, where Tancred, ruling for his uncle Bohemond, was able to consolidate his power without Byzantine interference.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} form the 1ABTF {{airborne}} units were withdrawn from combat in Italy. These were the U.S. 509th Parachute Infantry Battalion and U.S. 517th Parachute Regimental Combat Team, and the British 2nd Independent Parachute Brigade. Added to them were the U.S. 550th Glider Infantry Battalion and U.S. 551st Parachute Infantry Battalion, both of which had previously been stationed in Panama, <b>and</b> <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> which had seen combat. Two Free French parachute battalions had originally been assigned in early July, but disagreements over their deployment with General de Gaulle meant that the troops were not made available, and so the British 2nd Parachute Brigade {{was assigned to the}} operation on the proviso that they would be returned to operations in Italy once the beachhead was firmly established.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, the {{insurance}} bet {{is susceptible to}} advantage play. It is advantageous to make an insurance bet whenever the hole card {{has more than a}} chance of one in three of being a ten. Advantage play techniques can sometimes identify such situations. In a multi-hand, face-up, single deck game, it is possible to establish whether insurance is a good bet simply by observing the other cards on the table after the deal; even if there are just 2 player hands exposed, <b>and</b> <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> their two initial cards is a ten, then 16 in 47 of the remaining cards are tens, which is larger than 1 in 3, so insurance is a good bet. This is an elementary example of the family of advantage play techniques known as card counting.|$|E

25|$|Hereditary peerages {{continued}} to be created after 1958 but when Harold Wilson, of the Labour Party, became prime minister in 1964 he ceased to recommend the creation of hereditary peerages <b>and</b> <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> his successors, Edward Heath (of the Conservative Party) and James Callaghan (of the Labour Party), recommended hereditary peerage creations. Since then, hereditary peerages have not been regularly created outside {{of members of the}} royal family. Margaret Thatcher, a Conservative, did revive the practice of creating hereditary peers while she was prime minister: Harold Macmillan became Earl of Stockton in 1984, George Thomas became Viscount Tonypandy, and William Whitelaw became Viscount Whitelaw, both in 1983. The peerages of the latter two became extinct upon their deaths; the Earldom of Stockton survives. Thatcher's husband received an hereditary baronetcy, but she herself was created a life baroness on recommendation of her successor, John Major.|$|E
25|$|In France, {{within a}} matter of hours, the French retake and then lose the city of Rouen. After the battle, Bedford dies, and Talbot assumes direct command of the army. The Dauphin is horrified at the loss of Rouen, but Joan tells him not to worry. She then persuades the {{powerful}} Duke of Burgundy, who had been fighting for the English, to switch sides, and join the French. Meanwhile, Henry arrives in Paris and upon learning of Burgundy's betrayal, he sends Talbot to speak with him. Henry then pleads for Richard and Somerset to put aside their conflict, and, unaware of the implications of his actions, he chooses a red rose, symbolically aligning himself with Somerset and alienating Richard. Prior to returning to England, in an effort to secure peace between Somerset and Richard, Henry places Richard in command of the infantry and Somerset in command of the cavalry. Meanwhile, Talbot approaches Bordeaux, but the French army swings around and traps him. Talbot sends word for reinforcements, but the conflict between Richard and Somerset leads them to second guess one another, <b>and</b> <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> them send any, both blaming the other for the mix-up. The English army is subsequently destroyed, and both Talbot and his son are killed.|$|E

500|$|Hundreds {{of actors}} sought the main {{roles in the}} film, {{including}} Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman and Richard Gere for Jacob, and Andie MacDowell, Julia Roberts and Madonna for Jezzie. Eventually, Tim Robbins and Elizabeth Peña were cast; both auditioned early <b>and</b> <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> them had starred in a feature film before. Robbins said the film presented for him [...] "a great opportunity {{to go in a}} different direction. I love doing comedy, but I know I can do other things as well." [...] The film's military advisor was Vietnam veteran Captain Dale Dye, who provided a five-day boot camp military training for the actors playing soldiers in the Vietnam storyline (including Robbins, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Eriq La Salle and Ving Rhames).|$|E
500|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1938 Formby began work on Trouble Brewing, {{released}} the following year with 19-year-old Googie Withers as the female lead; Kimmins again directed. Withers later recounted that Formby did not speak to her until, during a break in filming when Beryl was not present, he whispered {{out of the corner}} of his mouth [...] "I'm sorry, love, but you know, I'm not allowed to speak to you", something she thought was [...] "very sweet". His second release of 1939—shortly after the outbreak of the Second World War—was Come On George!, which cast Pat Kirkwood in the female lead; the pair disliked each other intensely, <b>and</b> <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> the Formbys liked several of the other senior cast members. Come On George! was screened for troops serving in France before being released in Britain.|$|E
500|$|On 22 June 1941, the Germans {{attacked}} the Soviet Union under the codename of Operation Barbarossa; {{on that date}} Marat was in Kronstadt and Oktyabrskaya Revolyutsiya was in Tallinn. The latter was soon forced to fall back to Kronstadt by {{the speed of the}} German advance <b>and</b> <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> the Baltic Fleet dreadnoughts participated in combat until 8 September when they fired on troops of the German 18th Army from positions near Kronstadt and Leningrad. Marat was lightly damaged by German [...] guns on 16 September and had her bow blown off on 23 September by two bomb hits. One of which was claimed by Lieutenant Hans-Ulrich Rudel of III./StG 2 flying a Junkers Ju 87B 'Stuka', that detonated her forward magazine. She sank in the shallow water from progressive flooding, but was raised and used as a floating artillery battery {{for the rest of the}} war using two, and later, three of her gun turrets. Marat reverted to her original name on 31 May 1943. Oktyabrskaya Revolyutsiya was badly damaged on 21 September 1941 by three bomb hits on her bow that knocked out two of her turrets. She was sent for repairs at the Ordzhonikidze Yard on 23 October, although she was hit by more bombs on two different occasions while under repair until November 1942. Her AA armament was further reinforced during this period and Oktyabrskaya Revolyutsiya returned to her mission of providing fire support during the Siege of Leningrad, the Leningrad–Novgorod Offensive in January 1944 and the Vyborg–Petrozavodsk Offensive in June 1944. She was the last Soviet battleship to fire shots in anger on 9 June 1944 during the latter offensive. On 22 July 1944, the ship was awarded the Order of the Red Banner. Oktyabrskaya Revolyutsiya received a Lend-Lease British Type 279 air-warning radar sometime during 1944.|$|E
