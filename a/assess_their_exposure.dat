An investigation was initiated to determine exposures among the local staff, and to describe animal bite surveillance {{in the affected}} district. MethodsWe interviewed lodge staff on circumstances surrounding the zebra's illness and <b>assessed</b> <b>their</b> <b>exposure</b> status. We reviewed animal bite report forms from the outpatient department at the district hospital. ResultsThe zebra was reported bitten by a dog on 31 st July 2011, became ill on 23 rdAugust, and died three days later. There were 22 employees working at the lodge during that time. Six (27 %) had high exposure due to contact with saliva (bottle feeding, veterinary care) and received four doses of rabies vaccine and one of immune-globulin, and 16 (73 %) had low exposure due to casual contact and received only four doses of rabies vaccine. From January 2010 to September 2011, 118 cases of animal bites were reported in the district; 67 (57 %) occurred among males, 65 (57 %) in children < 15 years old, and 61 (52 %) were inflicted in a lower extremity. Domestic and stray dogs accounted for 98 % of reported bites. ConclusionDog bites remains {{the main source of}} rabies exposure in the district, but exposure can result from wildlife.

A literature review shows a need for predeparture training that would enable participants to develop a strategy for recognising and resolving such problems. Methods: After reviewing global health ethics education and predeparture training resources, we organised multidisciplinary focus groups with global-health experts at our institution. These sessions identified key ethical issues that our training should address: scope of practice, informed consent, privacy or confidentiality, professional ethics, harm and benefit, and corruption. We then developed four scenarios focusing on these ethical issues. Each scenario was followed by a debriefing session led by a faculty facilitator. We piloted the simulation training with a multidisciplinary cohort (n= 27) of postgraduate trainees. All participants completed prestimulation and postsimulation evaluations that <b>assessed</b> <b>their</b> <b>exposure</b> to the scenarios' ethical issues and ability to deal with these {{ethical dilemmas}} and identify resources for help.

We measured size-resolved particle mass (PMC; 0. 25 - 32 μm) and number (PNC; 0. 2 – 1 μm) concentrations on a 2. 7 km route. The instruments were placed inside a baby pram. The route passed through 4 traffic intersections (TIs) and a bus stand. A total of ~ 87 km road length was covered through 64 trips, made during school drop-in (morning) and pick-up (afternoon) hours. The objectives were to assess PMC and PNC exposure to in-pram babies at different route segments, understand their physicochemical characteristics and exposure differences between in-pram babies and adults carrying them. Over 5 -fold variability (14. 1 – 78. 2 μg m- 3) was observed in PMCs. Small-sized particles, including ultrafine particles, were always higher by 66 % (PM 1), 29 % (PM 2. 5) and 31 % (PNC) during the morning than afternoon. Coarse particles (PM 2. 5 - 10) showed an opposite trend with 70 % higher concentration during afternoon than morning. TIs emerged as pollution hotspots for all the particle types. For example, PM 2. 5, PM 2. 5 - 10 and PNCs during the morning (afternoon) at TIs were 7 (10) %, 19 (10) % and 68 (62) % higher, respectively, compared {{with the rest of the}} route. Bus stand was also a section of enhanced exposure to PNC and PM 2. 5, although not so much for PM 2. 5 - 10. EDX analyses revealed Cl, Na and Fe as dominant elements. Road salt might be a source of NaCl due to de-icing during the measurements while Fe contributed by non-exhaust emissions from brake abrasion. The respiratory deposition rates imitated the trend of PMC, with higher doses of coarse and fine particles during the afternoon and morning runs, respectively.

This study aimed to investigate recall of exposure to, and reported impact on gamblers of, gambling promotions and marketing content on social media, {{with a focus on}} vulnerable users currently experiencing gambling problems. Gamblers who use social media (N = 964) completed an online survey <b>assessing</b> <b>their</b> <b>exposure</b> to and engagement with gambling operators on social media, their problem gambling severity, and the impact of social media promotions on their gambling. Gamblers at moderate risk and problem gamblers {{were significantly more likely to}} report having been exposed to social media gambling promotions and indicated actively engaging with gambling operators via these platforms. They were more likely to self-report that they had increased gambling as a result of these promotions, and over one third reported that the promotions had increased their problems. This research suggests that gamblers at moderate risk or those experiencing gambling problems are more likely to be impacted by social media promotions, and these may play a role in exacerbating disordered gambling. Future research should verify these self-reported results with behavioral data. However, the potential influence of advertisements via these new platforms should be considered by clinicians and policymakers, given their potential role in the formation of this behavioral addiction. © 2016 American Psychological Association.

Because pollen grains are not uniformly distributed on a leaf, some segments of the larval population will encounter pollen densities higher than average with a certain likelihood. To correctly <b>assess</b> <b>their</b> <b>exposure,</b> data on pollen distribution on leaves are needed, an aspect generally accepted in the risk assessment [7, 22]. Expressing pollen deposition in units of n/cm 2, Perry et al. [7] used a leaf area size of 0.03  cm 2 as a reference, as the feeding behaviour of young larvae is important. This leaf area size, {{which was based on}} laboratory-conducted toxicity studies of Felke et al. [36], ensured that a leaf with applied pollen was consumable in 1  day even by young larvae. To account for inhomogeneous deposition of pollen on leaves, including that of aggregation processes, Perry et al. [7] assumed a factor of 12 for a 99  % confidence interval (CI) around mean pollen densities; for worst-case field scenario assumptions, they estimated a mean pollen density of approximately 599  n/cm 2 on nettle leaves and a daily mean density of 85 n/(cm 2  day) [8, Appendix I]. The European Food Safety Authority further developed the original model in several stages: expert judgements on 11 sources of uncertainty were included and various exposure assessment scenarios were estimated, with resulting risks all ranging below those of the original model in each case [14].|$|E

The birds used were apparently healthy adults of both sexes (8 birds/species, comprising 3 – 5 from each sex) of quail (Coturnix coturnix), collard dove (Streptopelia decaocto) and rock dove (Columba livia gaddi), which were captured in Mosul, Iraq. The mean respective cholinesterase activities (Δ pH/ 30 minutes) in the plasma and whole brain of the birds were as follows: quail (0. 96 and 0. 29), collard dove (0. 97 and 0. 82) and rock dove (1. 44 and 1. 42). We examined the potential susceptibility of the plasma or whole brain cholinesterases to inhibition by selected insecticides. The technique of in vitro cholinesterase inhibition for 10 minutes by the organophosphate insecticides dichlorvos, malathion and monocrotophos (0. 5 and 1. 0 µM) and the carbamate insecticide carbaryl (5 and 10 µM) in the enzyme reaction mixtures showed significant inhibition of plasma and whole brain cholinesterase activities to various extents. The data further support {{and add to the}} reported cholinesterase activities determined electrometrically in wild birds in northern Iraq. The plasma and whole brain cholinesterases of the birds are highly susceptible to inhibition by organophosphate and carbamate insecticides as determined by the described electrometric method, and the results further suggest the usefulness of the method in biomonitoring wild bird cholinesterases...|$|E
40|$|Businesses are {{continuously}} {{exposed to}} a changing business environment which may either exert positive or negative influences on profitability. The banking industry, in particular, is highly competitive and bank failures can have significant consequences for customers. Commercial banks, therefore, {{have a responsibility to}} protect their customers by implementing sound risk management strategies. In light of the recent financial crises (since 2007), risk management has once again become a popular topic of discussion since adequate risk management should have prevented or minimised the impact of the risks faced by failed banks. The primary objective {{of this study was to}} develop a framework that could be used by South African commercial banks to investigate risk management. Qualitative research was conducted in this regard. From this, findings and recommendations were derived in order to provide banks with a tool by which they could <b>assess</b> <b>their</b> <b>exposure</b> to risk. Various journals, websites, newspapers, bank reports and textbooks were consulted in support of the literature. The literature provided background information on the history and development of the risk management process. Considerable attention was given to the categories of risk that an adequate risk management framework should address. Furthermore, the current models used to manage risk in commercial bank were provided, as well as the specific reasons for bank failures. The main findings of this study were the identification of the most significant reasons for banking failures. These were identified as capital inadequacy, credit risk due to non-performing loans and a lack of banking supervision. In addition to these reasons, several other contributing principles were identified as important factors to be included in a risk management framework. A risk management framework was thus constructed in Table 5. 1 based on the literature regarding global banking failures and the relevant conclusions made by the researcher...|$|E

Eligibility was since {{expanded to include}} all {{women of childbearing age}} (15 - 45 years old). Purpose of the Program People are most commonly exposed to mercury through consumption of fish and marine mammals. This program focuses on women of childbearing age, as the growing fetus is most vulnerable to the neurotoxic effects of mercury. Having their hair tested for mercury permits individual Alaskan women to <b>assess</b> <b>their</b> own mercury <b>exposures,</b> and to learn whether dietary changes are necessary.

40|$|For many pension schemes, a {{shortage}} of data limits their ability to use sophisticated stochastic mortality models to <b>assess</b> and manage <b>their</b> <b>exposure</b> to longevity risk. In this study, we develop a mortality model designed for such pension schemes, which compares the evolution of mortality rates in a sub-population with that observed in a larger reference population. We apply this approach to data from the CMI Self-Administered Pension Scheme study, using U. K. population data as a reference. We then use the approach to investigate the potential differences {{in the evolution of}} mortality rates between these two populations and find that, in many practical situations, basis risk is much less of a problem than is commonly believed...|$|R
40|$|Prolonged, {{extensive}} {{exposure to}} hand-transmitted vibration {{could cause a}} series of vibration-induced disorders in the vascular, sensorineural, and musculoskeletal structures of the human hand-arm system, which have been collectively called hand-arm vibration syndrome (HAVS). 1 To assess the risk of HAVS the international standard ISO 5349 - 1 (2001) 1 recommends using the root-mean-square (rms) acceleration of the measured vibration with a frequency weighting. While a few epidemiological studies have reported results consistent with the predictions made according to the recommendation, many other studies have reported results with large discrepancies. 2 This may be partially attributed to the time-averaging effect involved in calculation of the frequency components, especially for impact type tools. Because the spectral characteristics of impact tools change dramatically with time, a time-frequency (T-F) analysis can provide better characterizations of such highly transient vibrations. The analytic wavelet transform (AWT) is an ideal T-F analysis tool because it possesses the advantages of both the Fourier transform and the wavelet transform. 3 The objective {{of this study was}} to explore the application of the AWT method for characterizing the impact tool vibrations and <b>assessing</b> <b>their</b> <b>exposure</b> risk. Methods Five tools (two chipping hammers, two riveting hammers, and one concrete cutting saw) were used in this study. The saw vibration was measured when it was used to cut a section of road pavement during a repair. The vibrations on the other tools were measured by the procedure specified in ISO 8662 - 2 (1992). 4 A sampling rate of 16, 386 Hz was used in the measurement. The AWT and Fourier analysis were applied to these signals and to identify their characteristics. Results Figure 1 compares the T-F characteristics of the accelerations measured from the relatively steady concrete saw and a riveting hammer. The frequency weighting specified in ISO 5349 - 11 was applied in the calculations. The comparison clearly shows that the two tools have completely different T-F characteristics...|$|R
