40|$|The {{idea that}} a single {{subgrain}} is sufficient to produce a single recrystallised grain is the simplest explanation for the recrystallisation process. Likewise, a single Goss oriented grain arising from the primary recrystallisation process is the simplest unit which can {{give rise to a}} secondary Goss oriented grain. More complicated cluster models, for example subgrain coalescence is also considered feasible for primary recrystallisation, clusters of Goss oriented grains might be another mechanism for forming Goss oriented secondary grains. This paper examines the cluster theory using material which is produced by the <b>ARMCO</b> <b>process</b> which requires two stages of rolling. In order to achieve this aim it is necessary to destroy the connectivity between individual Goss oriented grains by using thin foils derived from sheet which gives a strong Goss texture on conventional annealing. The foils were sectioned from the subsurface which had a strong η fibre after primary recrystallisation, and ranged in thickness from 18 μm (the average grain size after primary recrystallisation) up to 80 μm, which is the approximate thickness of the η textured layer. The central layer, which had the classical { 111 }〈hkl〉 primary recrystallised texture, was similarly processed, but this did not produce secondary recrystallisation. The experiment followed the secondary recrystallisation process in the same area using sequential annealing in a vacuum furnace by a combination of EBSD and Channelling contrast microscopy, The data does not support the high energy boundary hypothesis nor the CSL explanation. But it is clear that connectivity is important, because when this is destroyed by the thin foil two dimensional morphology, {{as it is in the}} thinnest foil, secondary recrystallisation does not occur. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Plastic {{deformation}} of <b>ARMCO</b> iron <b>processed</b> by ECAP up {{to a maximum}} equivalent strain of sixteen (i. e., 1, 4, 8, and 16 ECAP passes) following route Bc was investigated by analyzing its microstructure and the stress-strain curves obtained after tensile tests {{at different levels of}} deformation. Three values of deformation (two in the plastic region taking into account the modified Crussard-Jaoul analysis and one after failure) were considered. Fractions of LAGB and HAGB, grain size and grain aspect ratio were calculated and compared for the different ECAP passes and tensile deformation levels. The dislocation density evolution calculated by the Bergström model for both the tensile curves and the ECAP curve showed a higher increase in the amount of dislocations during the initial stages of deformation than at higher values of deformation due to higher probabilities of dislocations annihilation. The strain hardening exponents calculated via the Bergström model for each ECAP pass shows that there is a continuous decrease in the strain hardening capacity until the eighth pass where a small increase with a subsequent stabilization was found. The dislocation densities calculated by the Estrin model presented a good correlation with values reported in bibliography for iron especially with those calculated by X-ray diffraction. This latter model predicted well the strain hardening evolution for stages III, IV and V for <b>ARMCO</b> iron <b>processed</b> by ECAP, where the main increments in hardening for stages IV and V were coming from the cell interiors.

5000|$|The program lasts {{two years}} (four semesters). Most courses are {{internally}} assessed with equal weight given to classroom assessment and written examination. University papers are weighted 40% internally and 60% through University examination. Nine resident faculty collaborate with about 66 visiting faculty drawn from industry and academia. The Institute provides elective courses such as International Relations, Comparative Philosophy, Comparative Religion, and Cross-cultrural Management. In January 2011 the Centre for Africa Studies {{was launched in}} association with Makerere University Business School in Uganda, East Africa. Summer placements with corporations are available, with 59 corporations listed in the 2015-2017 brochure. Firms that recruit XIMR students include Fortress Infrastructure Advisory Services, Crisil Limited, CMC Limited, HDFC Limited, <b>ARMCO</b> Chemical <b>Process</b> Systems, Axis Bank Limited, DraftfCB Ulka Group India. The Institute has maintained a 100% placement rate for graduates. [...] "Fast tract batch" [...] is a program which identifies the top students for special attention, including sending 10 each summer to Africa for their placement. XIMR is ranked 74th among the top 200 business schools in India.|$|R
40|$|The strain {{hardening}} behavior of an <b>ARMCO</b> iron <b>processed</b> by ECAP {{at room temperature}} up to sixteen passes following route Bc was investigated through Hollomon and differential Crussard-Jaoul models. Results indicate that the Hollomon analysis shows some deviations from the experimentally determined true stress – true strain curves while the differential Crussard-Jaoul analysis based on the Ludwik equation and the modified Crussard- Jaoul analysis based on the Swift equation fit better when two work hardening exponents are considered. As expected, {{the strength of the}} material increased with the number of ECAP passes. Indeed the ultimate tensile stress reached a maximum of ~ 900 MPa after 16 passes, which is more than three times higher than the UTS of the annealed material. Nevertheless, the {{strain hardening}} capacity of the material was reduced in comparison with the material without severe plastic deformation. For that reason the tensile ductility was also reduced at increasing ECAP passes. The increase in strength was attributed to the reduction of the grain size through refined sub-grains with high density of dislocations. After sixteenth passes the original grain size (namely 70 mm) was reduced down to 300 to 400 nm observing a good correspondence with the Hall-Petch relationship. The microstructural analysis, carried out by EBSD, showed an increasing amount in the fraction of high Angle Grain Boundaries (HAGB) after 1 pass due to the regeneration of the microstructure with a smaller grain sizePostprint (published version...|$|R
