5|$|Stealth {{is based}} on {{limiting}} the player character's visibility; hiding behind objects and buildings, avoiding the enemies' cone of vision, and avoiding lighted areas aid in reducing detection. When hiding behind an object, the player can lean around the sides to see the immediate area and eavesdrop, {{and as long as}} Corvo remains hidden, his enemies will not see him. The player can <b>also</b> <b>look</b> through keyholes to gain insight into closed rooms. Sneaking up behind enemies allows the player to silently subdue them, and unconscious or dead bodies can be moved and hidden.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have found}} that bipolar {{disorder}} has often been misdiagnosed as major depression. Its early diagnosis necessitates that clinicians {{pay attention to the}} features of the patient's depression and <b>also</b> <b>look</b> for present or prior hypomanic or manic symptomatology.|$|E

25|$|Individuals {{with higher}} reward {{dependence}} <b>also</b> <b>look</b> for more social approval, {{and are more}} inclined to succumb to peer-pressure. They often become overly concerned with their body image and maybe prone to eating disorders, such as Bulimia nervosa. Whereas restricting anorexia, in particular, tends to reflect low reward dependence.|$|E
25|$|A dental {{hygienist}} or dentist will {{check for the}} symptoms of gingivitis, and may also examine the amount of plaque in the oral cavity. A {{dental hygienist}} or dentist will <b>also</b> <b>look</b> for signs of periodontitis using X-rays or periodontal probing {{as well as other}} methods.|$|E

25|$|This is {{the most}} populous {{category}} of fancy cut, because the standard round brilliant can be effectively modified into {{a wide range of}} shapes. Because their facet counts and facet arrangements are the same, modified brilliants <b>also</b> <b>look</b> (in terms of brilliance and fire interplay) the most like round brilliants.|$|E
25|$|One can <b>also</b> <b>look</b> at {{this from}} the {{perspective}} of what the meaning of our existence is. Why suffer what humans have suffered, the pain and despair—what meaning can all of this have? For Kierkegaard, there is no meaning unless passion, the emotions and will of humans, has a divine source.|$|E
25|$|Centrifugal {{compressors}} <b>also</b> <b>look</b> {{very similar}} to their turbomachinery counterpart the radial turbine {{as shown in the}} figure. While a compressor transfers energy into a flow to raise its pressure, a turbine operates in reverse, by extracting energy from a flow, thus reducing its pressure. In other words, power is input to compressors and output from turbines.|$|E

In addition, the court may also imply a term; if price is excluded, the court may imply a reasonable price, {{with the exception of}} land, and second-hand goods, which are unique.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, Dale Warren Griffin, a {{microbiologist}} {{working at}} the United States Geological Survey noted that viruses are the most numerous entities on Earth. Griffin speculates that viruses evolved in comets and on other planets and moons may be pathogenic to humans, so he proposed to <b>also</b> <b>look</b> for viruses on moons and planets of the Solar System.|$|E
25|$|Dizygotic twins, {{like any}} other siblings, have an {{extremely}} small chance of having the same chromosome profile. Even if they happen {{to have the same}} chromosome profile, they will always have different genetic material on each chromosome, due to chromosomal crossover during meiosis. Like any other siblings, dizygotic twins may look similar, particularly given that they are the same age. However, dizygotic twins may <b>also</b> <b>look</b> very different from each other.|$|E

In each contribution cycle, the board will earmark up to US$10 million to finance private sector projects that are regional or sub-regional in scope. The CDF will <b>also</b> <b>look</b> to work with its development partners in leveraging the technical assistance it can provide.|$|E
25|$|Micropsia that is {{induced by}} macular {{degeneration}} {{can be treated}} in several ways. A study called AREDS (age-related eye disease study) determined that taking dietary supplements containing high-dose antioxidants and zinc produced significant benefits with regard to disease progression. This study was the first ever to prove that dietary supplements can alter the natural progression and complications of a disease state. Laser treatments <b>also</b> <b>look</b> promising but are still in clinical stages.|$|E

25|$|With the sonatas of 1915–1917 {{there is}} a sudden shift in the style. These works recall Debussy's earlier music in part, but <b>also</b> <b>look</b> forward, with leaner, simpler structures. Despite the thinner textures of the Violin Sonata (1917), there remains an undeniable {{richness}} in the chords themselves. This shift parallels the movement commonly known as neo-classicism, which became popular {{after his death in}} 1918. He planned a set of six sonatas, but had only completed three (cello, flute-viola-harp, and violin) before he died.|$|E
25|$|The Today's Game {{exhibit is}} {{built like a}} {{baseball}} clubhouse, with 30 glass-enclosed locker stalls, one for each Major League franchise.

A center display case holds objects donated to the Hall of Fame from {{the past year or}} two. Fans can <b>also</b> <b>look</b> into a room designed to look like a manager's office.
