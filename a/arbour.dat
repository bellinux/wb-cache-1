5|$|There {{have been}} 16 head coaches so far for the Islanders franchise. The team's first head coach was Phil Goyette, who coached {{the team for}} part of the 1972–73 season. Al <b>Arbour</b> is the franchise's all-time leader for the most regular-season games coached (1,500) and the most regular-season game wins (740); he is also the franchise's all-time leader for the most playoff games coached (198), and the most playoff-game wins (119). Goyette, Earl Ingarfield, Bill Stewart, Scott Gordon and Jack Capuano are the only coaches who spent their entire careers with the Islanders and have not been elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame. <b>Arbour</b> is the only coach to have been {{inducted}} into the Hockey Hall of Fame. He is also the only coach to have won the Jack Adams Award as the NHL's top coach. The franchise has participated in the Stanley Cup finals five times, coached by <b>Arbour</b> each time; they won Stanley Cup four of those times. <b>Arbour,</b> Terry Simpson, Peter Laviolette, Steve Stirling, Ted Nolan, and Jack Capuano are the only coaches to have coached the team into the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|Louise <b>Arbour</b> {{began her}} job as Chief Prosecutor of war crimes at the UN in October 1996. She was {{unexpectedly}} selected by her predecessor, Richard Goldstone, as he believed she processed the toughness to pursue war crime suspects and the bureaucratic and diplomatic skills to function at the UN. At the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, contrary to Goldstone's tactic of publicizing indictments, which allowed the accused to make their arrest a risk to the ceasefire, <b>Arbour</b> kept hers sealed allowing for surprise arrests. In Rwanda she achieved several high-profile prosecutions, including the first conviction for rape as a war crime. By time she left in Fall 1999, her office had Slobodan Milošević, a head of state, indicted and arrested.|$|E
5|$|Six {{players have}} had their numbers retired by the Islanders. Of them, five players have been elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame: Denis Potvin, Bryan Trottier, Mike Bossy, Billy Smith and Clark Gillies. Other {{management}} personnel who have been inducted include Al <b>Arbour,</b> who coached the Islanders from 1972 to 1986 and 1988 to 1994, and Bill Torrey, who held the general manager position from 1972 to 1992.|$|E

5|$|In the Introduction, Off {{explains}} the animal metaphors. Roméo Dallaire is the 'lion' because he acted courageously with {{an appearance of}} control and confidence. Lewis MacKenzie compared to a 'fox' because while he made a brave and dramatic defense of the airport, and was trusted by outside observers, his actions in recommending against intervention {{were based on the}} cunning logic that all sides were, at least, partly responsible for the conflict. Louise <b>Arbour</b> is portrayed as the 'eagle' for her pursuit of justice and her use of surprise SWAT-like arrests.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{identified}} two themes: morality and the UN effectiveness. Off characterized Dallaire and <b>Arbour</b> as morally correct and MacKenzie morally wrong. In Rwanda, Dallaire lobbied the UN to intervene {{to stop the}} genocide. In Yugoslavia, MacKenzie is accused of being an apologist for the Serbs. In an interview Off admitted that she would prefer MacKenzie to be her son's commander but would want Dallaire if her people were being attacked because one puts his soldiers before the mission and the other the mission before the soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Since Ankylosaurus {{and other}} Late Cretaceous North American ankylosaurids grouped with Asian genera (in a tribe the authors named Ankylosaurini), <b>Arbour</b> and Currie {{suggested}} that earlier North American ankylosaurids had gone extinct {{by the late}} Albian or Cenomanian ages of the Middle Cretaceous. Ankylosaurids thereafter recolonised North America from Asia during the Campanian or Turonian ages of the Late Cretaceous, and diversified there again, leading to genera such as Ankylosaurus, Anodontosaurus, and Euoplocephalus. This explains a 30 million year gap in the fossil record of North American ankylosaurids between these ages.|$|E

5|$|Canadian Broadcasting Corporation {{journalist}} Carol Off began {{research to}} write a biography of Louise <b>Arbour.</b> Following input from fellow journalist and author Stevie Cameron, she broadened the book's scope to include profiles of Roméo Dallaire and Lewis MacKenzie. Along with her research assistant Sian Cansfield, they compiled twenty binders of research and conducted over a hundred interviews, including with the three subjects. For the historical background on Rwanda, she consulted the works of Gérard Prunier, Philip Gourevitch, Alison Des Forges, and the Human Rights Watch. For background on the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia, she consulted, amongst others, the works of Noel Malcolm, David Rieff, Roy Gutman. Living in Toronto with husband Linden MacIntyre, the 45-year-old author wrote the book {{in the spring and}} summer of 2000.|$|E
5|$|Chiswick forms {{part of the}} Brentford and Isleworth Parliament constituency. The MP is Ruth Cadbury (Labour), elected at the May 2015 general {{election}} replacing Mary Macleod (Conservative). For elections to the London Assembly Chiswick is in the South West constituency, represented since 2000 by Tony <b>Arbour,</b> of the Conservative Party. For elections to Hounslow London Borough Council, Chiswick is represented by three electoral wards: Turnham Green, Chiswick Homefields and Chiswick Riverside. Each ward elects three councillors, who serve four-year terms. For 2010–14, all nine councillors were Conservatives. It was one of 35 major centres identified in the statutory planning document of Greater London, the London Plan of 2008.|$|E
5|$|When {{the house}} and gardens were {{inherited}} by Coplestone Warre Bampfylde (1720–91) in the 18th century, a Georgian landscape garden was laid out, containing ponds, a grand cascade, a gothick alcove, a Tuscan temple <b>arbour</b> (1786), and a folly mausoleum. Bampfylde was an amateur architect of talent and a friend and adviser to Henry Hoare who laid out the gardens at Stourhead. Bampfylde also designed a Doric temple for the grounds, which was built around 1786, with an ashlar tetrastyle prostyle fronted by Tuscan columns and a large modillioned pediment. A Victorian formal parterre was added near the house by Henry Hall in the 1870s.|$|E

5|$|While <b>Arbour</b> {{was pleased}} with her profile, MacKenzie was not. Reviewers noted Off's {{critical}} portrayal of MacKenzie as being excessive and MacKenzie considered suing Off for libel. Instead MacKenzie wrote a response in The Globe and Mail presenting {{his point of view}} concerning the mission and events. In 2008 he wrote an autobiography with a chapter dedicated to addressing the criticism he received as a result of Off's book. While Off condemns MacKenzie for not learning the conflict's history and telling American audiences that both sides were to blame for the conflict, MacKenzie defends himself by stating it was international decision-making, not his opinions, that led the UN to not intervene.|$|E
5|$|Like other ankylosaurids, Ankylosaurus had {{cervical}} half-rings (armor {{plates on}} the neck), {{but these are}} only known from fragments, making their exact arrangement uncertain. Carpenter suggested that when seen from above, the plates would have been paired, and created an inverted V-shape across the neck, with the midline gap probably being filled with small ossicles (round bony scutes) to allow for movement. He believed the width of this armor belt was too wide to have fitted solely on the neck, and that it covered {{the base of the}} neck and continued onto the shoulder region. Paleontologists Victoria M. <b>Arbour</b> and Philip J. Currie disagreed with Carpenter's interpretation, and pointed out that the cervical half-ring fragments of specimen AMNH 5895 did not fit together in the way proposed by Carpenter (though this could be due to breakage). They instead suggested that the fragments represented the remains of two cervical half-rings, which formed two semi-circular plates of armor around {{the upper part of the}} neck, as in the closely related Anodontosaurus and Euoplocephalus.|$|E
5|$|On 11 September 1926, Shamrock Rovers {{played their}} first game at Glenmalure Park, Milltown against Dundalk, having {{previously}} played at Ringsend Park, Shelbourne Park, Windy <b>Arbour</b> {{and a different}} pitch behind the famous Milltown one. The official opening took place on Sunday, 19 September 1926 as Belfast Celtic provided the opposition in an exhibition game. When the Cunninghams acquired the club in the 1930s, the stadium was named Glenmalure Park in honour of their ancestral home in Glenmalure. They completed the stadium {{with the addition of}} terraces, one of which was covered. The stadium remained essentially unaltered from then until its demolition in 1990, excluding the destruction of a small terrace and the erection of floodlights in the 1980s. Its capacity was approximately 20,000 for most of its existence, its largest recorded attendance being 28,000, set against Waterford in 1968. Larger, unreported, attendances were present at the venue before then.|$|E

5|$|Although a court roll of 1389 {{mentions}} two gardens, {{there is}} no record of where these were sited, nor is there any record of when the terraces were constructed. The basic layout as known today was certainly in place by about 1730, {{as can be seen in}} a portrait of the house from that period. Later in the 18th century, the space behind the great pilastered wall was infilled to make the top terrace, which has wide views across the valley to the Mendip Hills beyond. The Octagon, a garden pavilion, was built about the same time, as was the more rustic summer house which faces it down the long grassy walk of the Pretty Terrace. Further modifications involved facing the lower retaining wall with rosy pink bricks, which were also used to build a double flight of steps below the Octagon. The garden is still largely in its 18th-century form, though small ponds and fountains were added in the 19th century and the once open hillside behind is now thickly wooded. A single rose <b>arbour</b> remained from the Edwardian garden but was on the verge of collapse when it was replaced with a new one in 2009, marking 300 years of the Elton family's presence at Clevedon Court.|$|E
5|$|The {{city has}} been home {{to a number of}} famed authors. Most notably Charles Dickens– known for such works as Oliver Twist, A Tale of Two Cities, and The Pickwick Paperswas born in Portsmouth. Arthur Conan Doyle, author of the Sherlock Holmes stories, practised as a doctor in the city and played in goal for Portsmouth Association Football Club, an amateur team not to be {{confused}} with the later professional Portsmouth Football Club. Rudyard Kipling, poet and author of the Jungle Book, and H. G. Wells, author of War of the Worlds and The Time Machine, lived in Portsmouth during the 1880s. Sir Walter Besant, a novelist and historian, was born in Portsmouth, writing one novel set exclusively in the town, By Celia's <b>Arbour,</b> A Tale of Portsmouth Town. Sir Francis Austen, brother of Jane Austen, briefly lived in the area after graduating from Portsmouth Naval Academy. More contemporary Portsmouth literary figures include social critic, journalist, and author Christopher Hitchens, who was born in the city. Nevil Shute moved to Portsmouth in 1934 when he relocated his aircraft company to the city; his former home stands in the Eastney end of the island of Portsea. Fantasy author Neil Gaiman grew up in nearby Purbrook and the Portsmouth suburb of Southsea, and in 2013 had a Southsea road named after his novel The Ocean At The End Of The Lane. Olivia Manning's childhood was also spent in the city.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} 25head coaches for the Blues. The franchise's first head coach was Lynn Patrick, who coached for 16 games {{in his first}} term. Joel Quenneville is the franchise's all-time leader for the most regular-season games coached (593), the most regular-season game wins (307), the most regular-season points (709), the most playoff games coached (68), and the most playoff-game wins (34). Barclay Plager and Bob Plager are the only pair of {{brothers}} to have coached the Blues; Barclay coached for four seasons, and Bob coached for eleven games.
