5|$|Analysis of {{algorithms}} is {{a branch}} of computer science that studies the performance of algorithms (computer programs solving a certain problem). Logarithms are valuable for describing algorithms that divide a problem into smaller ones, <b>and</b> <b>join</b> the solutions of the subproblems.|$|E

5|$|Through this weaving process, aspect weavers {{allow for}} code {{which would have}} {{otherwise}} been duplicated across classes. By eliminating this duplication, aspect weavers promote modularity of cross-cutting concerns. Aspects define the implementation code which would have otherwise been duplicated and then use pointcuts <b>and</b> <b>join</b> points to define the advice. During weaving, the aspect weaver uses the pointcuts <b>and</b> <b>join</b> points, known as a pointcut designator, to identify the positions in candidate classes at which the implementation should be injected. The implementation is then injected into the classes at the points identified, thus permitting the code to be executed at the appropriate times without relying on manual duplication by the programmer.|$|E
5|$|A March 1779 {{letter from}} Washington to Scott, still on {{furlough}} in Virginia, {{ordered him to}} recruit volunteers in Virginia <b>and</b> <b>join</b> Washington at Middlebrook on May 1.

Reports of significant British troop movements toward Georgia had convinced Washington that the enemy was preparing an invasion from the south.|$|E

5|$|Aspect weavers take {{instructions}} {{known as}} advice specified {{through the use}} of pointcuts <b>and</b> <b>join</b> points, special segments of code that indicate what methods should be handled by aspect code. The implementation of the aspect then specifies whether the related code should be added before, after, or throughout the related methods. By doing this, aspect weavers improve modularity, keeping code in one place that would otherwise have been interspersed throughout various, unrelated classes.|$|E
5|$|Asser (died c. 909) was a Welsh monk from St David's, Dyfed, {{who became}} Bishop of Sherborne in the 890s.
