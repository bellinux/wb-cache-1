5|$|A {{large number}} of stone monuments {{were placed in the}} North Acropolis. By the 9th century AD these {{included}} 43 stelae and 30 altars; 18 of these monuments were sculpted with hieroglyphic texts and royal portraits. <b>A</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> monuments show the influence of the great city of Teotihuacan in the Valley of Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Besides the nucleolus, {{the nucleus}} {{contains}} {{a number of}} other non-membrane-delineated bodies. These include Cajal bodies, Gemini of coiled bodies, polymorphic interphase karyosomal association (PIKA), promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) bodies, paraspeckles, and splicing speckles. Although little is known about <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> domains, they are significant in that they show that the nucleoplasm is not a uniform mixture, but rather contains organized functional subdomains.|$|E
5|$|In 1922, Hunter {{began to}} make a series of trips to {{mainland}} Europe, where he visited Paris, Venice, Florence and the Riviera. Fergusson accompanied him on <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> visits. Hunter's visits abroad produced {{a large number of}} paintings and his style changed noticeably in this period of European travel as he began using dabs of colour placed instinctively to portray underlying form.|$|E

The RLM thought that because the E variant could outrun enemy fighters in Spain, {{there was no need to}} upgrade the defensive weaponry, which would prove to be a mistake in later years.|$|E

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> circles {{were built}} in the area around modern Dorset, {{typically}} being constructed from sarsen stone and being smaller than those found elsewhere. The Kingston Russell ring is the largest of those in Dorset, measuring 24 by 27 metres (79 feet by 89 feet) in diameter and containing eighteen sarsen stones arranged in an oval shape. The site has not been excavated or been subject to in-depth archaeological investigation.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> circles {{were built}} in the area around modern Dorset, {{typically}} being smaller than those found elsewhere. Most of these Dorset circles are made of sarsen stone, although the Rempstone circle is unique in being made from local sandstone. The southern half of the circle has been destroyed, with five upright and three recumbent stones remaining extant. Having been damaged by eighteenth century clay workings, the monument is at present situated within dense woodland. In 1957, a possible avenue of stones leading to the circle was discovered by ploughing but subsequently removed. Local folklore holds that the stones arrived in their position after being thrown at Corfe Castle by the Devil.|$|E
5|$|A {{previous}} {{analysis by}} Carlos and Raul de la Fuente Marcos of commensurabilities among the known ETNOs using Monte Carlo techniques revealed a pattern {{similar to that}} of the Kuiper belt, where accidental commensurabilities occur due to objects in resonances with Neptune. They find that this pattern would be best explained if the ETNOs were in resonance with an additional planetary-sized object beyond Pluto and note that <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> objects may be in 5:3 and 3:1 resonances if that object had semi-major axis of ≈700 AU.|$|E

5|$|As the {{tradition}} of classical Gaelic poetry declined, a new tradition of vernacular Gaelic poetry began to emerge. While Classical poetry used a language largely fixed in the twelfth century, the vernacular continued to develop. In contrast to the Classical tradition, which used syllabic metre, vernacular poets tended to use stressed metre. However, they shared with the Classic poets a set of complex metaphors and role, as the verse was still often panegyric. <b>A</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> vernacular poets were women, such as Mary MacLeod of Harris (c. 1615–1707).|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of Andriamasinavalona's reign, the {{highlands}} around Imerina were wracked with violent conflict among minor princedoms centered around fortified hill towns. Andriamasinavalona successfully united <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> principalities in the territory bordering his own, thereby expanding the boundaries of Imerina to include Fanongoavana to the west, Rangaina to the north, Ombifotsy {{to the east and}} Sahasarotra to the south. As he brought each territory under his control, he restricted the autonomy of its original rulers and imposed strict submission to his own authority. His diplomatic and political conquests enabled Andriamasinavalona to extend his kingdom to its fullest historical extent, making him the first Merina sovereign to rule over the entire province of Imerina.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the spring}} and early summer of 1921, the rebels {{experienced}} a series of defeats. In July 1921, Hananu's stronghold in Jabal Zawiya was captured by French forces. By this time, French forces proceeded to burn down villages where support for the rebels was high. <b>A</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> villages' inhabitants were arrested or executed, prompting some rebels to ultimately surrender. On 11 or 12 July, Hananu fled to British-held Transjordan, seeking refuge with nationalists from Syria, to avoid arrest by the French authorities. British intelligence officers arrested Hananu while he was visiting Jerusalem and extradited him to Syria in August.|$|E

5|$|During Edward's reign, Æthelwig {{worked to}} recover {{some of the}} abbey's estates that had been granted {{to others in the}} past but had not been {{returned}} to the abbey's custody. He managed to restore the abbey's possession of <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> lost estates. A large section of the description of the abbot's life in the Chronicon is concerned with a listing of estates that Æthelwig acquired or recovered. The estates listed were in the counties of Worcestershire, Warwickshire, and Gloucestershire.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1960s {{to the early}} 1980s, a number of German, Dutch and Swiss {{settlers}} were attracted to Banagher, mainly because of its proximity to the River Shannon and associated lifestyle. <b>A</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> are still resident in Banagher. As {{with the majority of}} towns and cities in Ireland, Banagher has seen an influx of foreign nationals, mostly of Eastern European origin, in recent years and these now make up just over 10% of the population.|$|E
5|$|Since 1953, Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma have {{commissioned}} {{a new work}} for wind band to be premiered at almost every National Intercollegiate Band concert. This program was begun {{to add to the}} wind repertoire under the direction of Grand President Hugh McMillen, and is the longest-running commissioning project in the United States. <b>A</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> commissioned compositions have garnered national acclaim, including Robert Russell Bennett's Symphonic Songs for Band and Karel Husa's Concerto for Trumpet and Wind Orchestra. In the years following the start of the national commissioning program, local chapters have begun to commission new band works themselves, such as Frank Ticheli's An American Elegy, commissioned by the Alpha Iota chapter in memory of the Columbine High School massacre.|$|E

5|$|TWR had {{manufactured}} <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> racing V12 engines {{during the}} 1980s {{and they had}} been raced competitively, with a 7-litre version of this engine featuring in the Le Mans winning Silk Cut Jaguar XJR-9. Five of these engines still existed, all of which were fitted with dry sump lubrication. These engines were chosen and considered to be especially useful as the dry sump would lower the vehicle's centre of gravity. The displacement of the V12 was set at 6.2 litres (6222cc) for the XJ220. The engine fitted to the XJ220 concept had titanium connecting rods.|$|E
5|$|After {{this the}} brigade {{continued}} to advance, moving through Ruddenburg and Greven before carrying out {{an attack on}} Osnabruck, which No. 3 Commando led, on 4 April 1945. The next day, they crossed the Weser River in assault boats and {{under the cover of}} darkness carried out a flanking manoeuvre on the Germans occupying the town of Leese. As other elements from the brigade attacked from the east, No. 3 Commando, now under the command of Peter Bartholomew after Komrower had been posted to the Commando Training Depot, carried out a follow-up operation to the north. The operation was an attack on a factory that had been producing V-2 rockets and after No. 3 Commando had captured it with the support of a number of tanks, a search found <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> weapons, along with about 100 scientists who had been working in the factory.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{repeated}} efforts, the French Navy {{failed to}} reinforce and resupply the garrison, as their ships were intercepted and defeated either in European waters {{or in the}} Caribbean itself. The British had intercepted <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> messages, and launched a series of successful invasions during 1809, until Guadeloupe was the only French colony remaining. A British expeditionary force landed on 28 January 1810, and found {{that much of the}} island's militia garrison had deserted. Advancing from two landing beaches {{on opposite sides of the}} island, they were able to rapidly push inland. It was not until they reached Beaupère–St. Louis Ridge outside the capital Basse-Terre that the expeditionary force faced strong opposition, but in a battle lasting for most of 3 February, the French were defeated and driven back. The island's commander, Jean Augustin Ernouf, began surrender negotiations the following day.|$|E
