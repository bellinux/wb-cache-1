Working with a number of collaborators on the album, Madonna encountered problems in keeping a cohesive sound and creative direction for Rebel Heart, since her previous efforts had been produced with only a small core group of people developing the music. She observed that a lot of the people she enlisted would not stay in one city at a time due to their different projects, resulting in Madonna not finishing her songs. [...] "So, I was just the person standing there with a clipboard in the headlights, going 'Ok!' <b>A</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> school teacher," [...] she admitted.|$|E

Do you know, I'm beginning to feel <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> stranger in Avonlea now? It makes me sorry--but it's true. It's quite appalling to see {{the number of children}} who have shot up into big boys and girls--really young men and women--these past two years. Half of my pupils are grown up. It makes me feel awfully old to see them in the places you and I and our mates used to fill." ...|$|E
50|$|The park is {{designed}} to look <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> farm complex from the outside. Augusta {{has long been the}} home of dairy farms, and the Cardinals wanted to make their stadium blend in.|$|E

5000|$|Director Steve Barron {{later said}} {{when he made the}} film there was a {{prejudice}} against video clip directors doing drama, and since Electric Dreams [...] "was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> extended music video...
