40|$|Purpose: Dose plans {{generated}} with optimization models hitherto used in HDR brachytherapy {{have shown}} a tendency to yield longer dwell times than manually optimized plans. Concern has been raised for the corresponding undesired hot spots and various methods to mitigate these have been developed. The hypotheses of this work are a) that one cause for the long dwell times {{is the use of}} objective functions comprising simple linear penalties and b) that <b>alternative</b> <b>penalties,</b> being piecewise linear, would lead to reduced length of individual dwell times. Methods: The characteristics of the linear penalties and the piecewise linear penalties are analysed mathematically. Experimental comparisons between the two types of penalties are carried out retrospectively for a set of prostate cancer patients. Results: While most dose-volume parameters do not differ significantly between the two types of penalties significant changes {{can be seen in the}} dwell times. On the average, total dwell times were reduced by 4. 2 %, with a reduction of maximum dwell times by 30 %, using the <b>alternative</b> <b>penalties.</b> Conclusion: The use of linear penalties in optimization models for HDR brachytherapy is one cause for undesired longer dwell times appearing in mathematically optimized plans. By introducing <b>alternative</b> <b>penalties</b> significant reduction in dwell times can be achieved for HDR brachytherapy dose plans. Although various constraints as to reduce the long dwell times have been developed our finding is of fundamental interest in showing the shape of the objective function to be one reason for their appearance...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Numerous studies {{confirmed}} {{personality traits}} as being important predictors of criminal behavior. The {{aim of this}} research was to determine which constellation of basic personality traits incarcerated individuals and those serving alternative sanctions differ, and which traits make the difference between the criminal and the non-criminal populations. In this research, the model of personality used is a cybernetic model of conative functioning, which assumes that conative regulation systems almost completely describe the structure of personality. Methods: The study sample consisted of 391 male respondents (152 offenders serving prison sentence, 91 convicts sentenced to <b>alternative</b> <b>penalties</b> and 148 non-offenders). Examined variables were: the regulator of activity (Extroversion), the regulator of organic functions (Hysteria), the regulator of defense reactions (Anxiety), the regulator of attack reactions (Aggressiveness), the system for coordination of regulatory functions (Psychoticism) and the system for integration of regulatory functions (Integration). Results: There were significant differences in all dimensions of personality between groups, except for the framework of Extraversion. The traits that contribute to the difference between individuals serving prison sentence and offenders sentenced to <b>alternative</b> <b>penalties</b> are Integration and Aggressiveness. The traits that contribute to the difference between non-offenders and offenders serving prison sentence are Psychoticism, Integration, Aggressiveness, and Anxiety. Among offenders sentenced to <b>alternative</b> <b>penalties</b> and the general population no difference in personality traits was found. Conclusion: Our findings may indicate the need for mandatory diagnostic psychological evaluation of persons who have committed minor offenses, to ensure the right decision is made when choosing between prison and an alternative method of punishment...|$|R

The bad performance is caused by estimation errors in the covariance matrix and in the expected return vector that can deposit unhindered in the portfolio weights. Recent studies show that imposing a penalty in form of a l 1 -norm of the asset weights regularizes the problem, thereby improving the out-of-sample performance of the optimized portfolios. Simultaneously, l 1 -regularization selects a subset of assets to invest in from a pool of candidates that is often very large. However, l 1 -regularization might lead to the construction of biased solutions. We propose to tackle this issue by considering several <b>alternative</b> <b>penalties</b> proposed in non-financial contexts.

This paper proposes a method to improve boosting-based {{ensemble learning}} with penalty profiles via an application of automatic unknown word recognition in Thai language. Treating a sequential problem as a non-sequential problem, the unknown word recognition is required to include a process to rank a set of generated candidates for a potential unknown word position. To strengthen the recognition process with ensemble classification, the penalty profiles are defined to make it more efficient to construct a succeeding classification model which tends to re-rank a set of ranked candidates into a suitable order. As an evaluation, a number of <b>alternative</b> <b>penalty</b> profiles are introduced and their performances are compared for the task of extracting unknown words from a large Thai medical text. Using the Naïve Bayes as the base classifier for ensemble learning, the proposed method with the best setting achieves an accuracy of 90. 19 %, which is an accuracy gap of 12. 88, 10. 59, and 6. 05 over conventional Naïve Bayes, non-ensemble version, and the flat-penalty profile...|$|E

40|$|The {{internal}} models {{amendment to the}} Basel Accord allows banks to use {{internal models}} to forecast Value-at-Risk (VaR) thresholds, which are {{used to calculate the}} required capital that banks must hold in reserve as a protection against negative changes in the value of their trading portfolios. As capital reserves lead to an opportunity cost to banks, it is likely that banks could be tempted to use models that underpredict risk, and hence lead to low capital charges. In order to avoid this problem the Basel Accord introduced a backtesting procedure, whereby banks using models that led to excessive violations are penalised through higher capital charges. This paper investigates the performance of five popular volatility models {{that can be used to}} forecast VaR thresholds under a variety of distributional assumptions. The results suggest that, within the current constraints and the penalty structure of the Basel Accord, the lowest capital charges arise when using models that lead to excessive violations, thereby suggesting the current penalty structure is not severe enough to control risk management. In addition, an <b>alternative</b> <b>penalty</b> structure is suggested to be more effective in aligning the interests of banks and regulators. ...|$|E

40|$|Nearest {{shrunken}} centroids (NSC) is {{a popular}} classification method for microarray data. NSC calculates centroids for each class and "shrinks" the centroids toward 0 using soft thresholding. Future observations are then assigned to the class with the minimum distance between the observation and the (shrunken) centroid. Under certain conditions the soft shrinkage used by NSC is equivalent to a LASSO penalty. However, this penalty can produce biased estimates when the true coefficients are large. In addition, NSC {{ignores the fact that}} multiple measures of the same gene are likely to be related to one another. We consider several alternative genewise shrinkage methods to address the aforementioned shortcomings of NSC. Three alternative penalties were considered: the smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD), the adaptive LASSO (ADA), and the minimax concave penalty (MCP). We also showed that NSC can be performed in a genewise manner. Classification methods were derived for each alternative shrinkage method or alternative genewise penalty, and the performance of each new classification method was compared with that of conventional NSC on several simulated and real microarray data sets. Moreover, we applied the geometric mean approach for the <b>alternative</b> <b>penalty</b> functions. In general the alternative (genewise) penalties required fewer genes than NSC. The geometric mean of the class-specific prediction accuracies was improved, as well as the overall predictive accuracy in some cases.

The introduction outlines the historical development of alternative sanctions and the reasons for their creation and implementation. The following chapters address alternative sentences as accounted for in the valid and effective Czech legislation. The community service sentence, as the most typical alternative punishment, is discussed in detail. Attention is also focused on suspended sentences, including suspended sentences with supervision, i. e. punishments which are definitely the ones that are imposed the most frequently in the Czech Republic. The sentence of pecuniary penalty, which is also often imposed as an alternative sanction, is dealt with thoroughly too. Other punishments, including forfeiture of an item, prohibition of a specific activity, prohibition of residence and deportation, whose alternative function is rather secondary, are paid less attention. The following part of the paper provides a comparison of alternative sentences according to Slovak legal regulations with <b>alternative</b> <b>penalties</b> envisaged by Czech legislation.

The study shows that {{the main reasons for}} the overcrowding of prisons are the immense increase of the probability that a detained offender is convicted together with the increase of the share of convicts receiving a prison sentence. These factors increased the number of prisoners by 3, 300 and 3, 100, respectively. Another less important reason for the growth of prison population is that the length of sentences has increased in the last two years. Furthermore, the prisoner numbers are affected by the declining crime rate. If crime did not decline in the previous years, the prisons would have to accommodate nearly 24, 000 inmates. The study concludes that the current crime policy will lead to even further increase of prisoners. This is because of the dynamics of prisoners’ arrival and release.
