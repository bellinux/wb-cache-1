40|$|Abstract — The {{power density}} of modern ICs {{continues}} to increase with each new process technology. Larger power density blocks result in higher temperatures which in turn decrease the reliability of chips and produce more leakage power. In this paper we present a method to help reduce the temperature of chips at the floorplan design level by <b>adjusting</b> <b>block</b> utilizations based on the available whitespace in a floorplan. We also briefly outline a method for fast and accurate thermal floorplanning. Our experimental results show that peak IC temperatures can be significantly reduced at the floorplan design stage by using the aforementioned methods without sacrificing significant increases in floorplanning run-time, or wirelength.

40|$|Direct {{implementations}} {{of bilateral}} filtering show O(r 2) computational complexity per pixel, where r is the filter window radius. Several lower complexity {{methods have been}} developed. State-of-the-art low complexity algorithm is an O(1) bilateral filtering, in which computational cost per pixel is nearly constant for large image size. Although the overall computational complexity does not go up with the window radius, it is linearly proportional {{to the number of}} quantization levels of bilateral filtering computed per pixel in the algorithm. In this paper, we show that overall runtime depends on two factors, computing time per pixel per level and average number of levels per pixel. We explain a fundamental trade-off between these two factors, which can be controlled by <b>adjusting</b> <b>block</b> size. We establish a model to estimate run time and search for the optimal block size. Using this model, we demonstrate an average speedup of 1. 2 – 26. 0 x over the pervious method for typical bilateral filtering parameters.

40|$|Supporting {{safe and}} {{resilient}} authentication {{and integrity of}} digital images is of critical importance {{in a time of}} enormous creation and sharing of these contents. This paper presents an improved digital image watermarking model based on a coefficient quantization technique that intelligently encodes the owner’s information for each color channel to improve imperceptibility and robustness of the hidden information. Concretely, a novel color channel selection mechanism automatically selects the optimal HL 4 and LH 4 wavelet coefficient blocks for embedding binary bits by <b>adjusting</b> <b>block</b> differences, calculated between LH and HL coefficients of the host image. The channel selection aims to minimize the visual difference between the original image and the embedded image. On the other hand, the strength of the watermark is controlled by a factor to achieve an acceptable tradeoff between robustness and imperceptibility. The arrangement of the watermark pixels before shuffling and the channel into which each pixel is embedded is ciphered in an associated key. This key is utterly required to recover the original watermark, which is extracted through an adaptive clustering thresholding mechanism based on the Otsu’s algorithm. Benchmark results prove the model to support imperceptible watermarking as well as high robustness against common attacks in image processing, including geometric, non-geometric transformations, and lossy JPEG compression. The proposed method enhances more than 4 dB in the watermarked image quality and significantly reduces Bit Error Rate in the comparison of state-of-the-art approaches...|$|E

40|$|In {{experimental}} trials, {{the success}} or failure of agricultural improvements is commonly evaluated on the agronomic response of crops, using proper experimental designs with sufficient statistical power. Since fine-scale variability of the experimental site can reduce statistical power, efficiency gains in the experimental design can be achieved if this variation is known and used to design blocking, or some proxy variable is used as a covariate. Near-surface geophysical techniques such as electromagnetic induction (EMI), which describes subsurface properties non-invasively by measuring soil apparent conductivity (ECa), may be one source of this information. The motivation of our study was to investigate the effectiveness of EMI-derived ECa measurements for planning and analysis of agricultural experiments. ECa and plant height measurements (the response variable) were taken from an agroforestry experiment in Western Thailand, and their variability was quantified to simulate multiple realizations of ECa and the residuals of the response variable from treatment means. These were combined to produce simulated data from different experimental designs and treatment effects. The simulated data were then used to evaluate the statistical power by detecting three orthogonal contrasts among the treatments in the original experiment. We considered three experimental designs, a simple random design (SR), a complete randomized block design (CRB), and a complete randomized block design with spatially <b>adjusted</b> <b>blocks</b> on plot means of ECa (CRBECa). Using analysis of variance (ANOVA), the smallest effect sizes could be detected with the CRBECa design, which indicates that ECa measurements could be used in the planning phase of an experiment to achieve efficiencies by improved blocking. In contrast, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) demonstrated that substantial power improvements could be gained when ECa was considered as a covariate in the analysis. We therefore recommend that ECa measurements should be used to characterize subsurface variability of experimental sites and to support the statistical analysis of agricultural experiments.
