5|$|Mount Saint Peter Church was {{magnificent}} {{and rose}} {{up on the}} hill, but to many, it seemed <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> not really belong to the congregation. It was much richer than Saint Peter Church and {{if it had not}} been labored upon by so many members of the congregation, none would have felt worthy to call it their parish. But since so much work, love, and faith had been spent on this place of worship, parishioners became proud to have the honor of attending Mass there every Sunday. As a construction site, it had held some dangers. On September 28, 1941, a group of teenage boys, just out of high school, were making concrete flooring for the church at the Burrell Construction Company. A large crane operating above them made an unusual movement, causing its bucket, which weighed several tons, to come down with a huge crash right in their midst. All the working tools were completely destroyed but none of the boys were hurt. The bronze door at the front entrance fell on a worker, and everyone believed he had been crushed to death. When ten men lifted the door, they found the worker unharmed underneath it. In another case, an 18-year-old was assigned a job on the tower of the church before it was roofed. No one realized that he had poor eyesight and he fell from the tower while working. On his way down, he was able to grab onto a pulley that was suspended from the tower.|$|E

Balanced Rock is perched atop a cliff alongside Great Trough Creek. It appears <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> tumble into the creek below with the slightest push, but it has held the same position for thousands of years. Balanced Rock is made up of a hard type of rock that did not erode like the rock surrounding it. As the mountains eroded away Balanced Rock remained.|$|E

A well-known poem in the Wen Xuan is attributed to her. Although most unlikely to actually be by her (especially since {{it is not in}} her grand-nephew Ban's biography of her), it is certainly written <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> have been written by her or someone in her position. It is an important early example of the secluded palace lady genre of poetry.|$|E

25|$|The EL {{brought with}} it {{improvements}} to braking and handling. Speed-sensitive power steering on the Fairmont Ghia made parking more straightforward, without compromising high-speed steering. With {{the introduction of the}} new model, buyers could now purchase a Falcon with standard (optional on GLi) anti-lock brakes featuring the latest Bosch 5.3 module. Perhaps the biggest advancement with the EL was the improvements to the handling woes of the EF, with improvements established to the suspension and steering. Engineers at Tickford had discovered that by lowering the pivot point of the Watt's linkages in the rear suspension by 20millimetres (0.8in), that the roll oversteer effect which plagued the EF could finally be eliminated. Previously on EF models, during hard cornering the rear end of the car often felt <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> not keep up with the front, due to the difference in roll rate between the front and rear suspension. The result of this produced unpredictable car handling at times, where the delayed weight transfer at the rear would seek to damage the integrity of the outside rear tyre grip. This was exaggerated even further in wet weather or on vehicles fitted with poor tyres. Although this problem was addressed to a degree in the EFII update, it was the EL that became the first base level Falcon to feature a rear suspension setup that would complement the precision of rack and pinion steering introduced in the EA Falcon eight years earlier. The improved suspension geometry allowed Ford to soften the spring rates on both front and rear on the EL for a more compliant ride, as the driver no longer had roll oversteer to contain.|$|E
500|$|In 2003, Beebe's Tetrapteryx {{hypothesis}} {{was supported by}} the discovery of Microraptor gui, a small feathered dinosaur which possessed asymmetrical flight feathers on both its front and hind limbs. Beebe's Tetrapteryx hypothesis is now regarded as prescient for its prediction of both the anatomy and likely gliding posture of Microraptor gui, which Richard O. Prum has described as [...] " [...] <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> have glided straight out of the pages of Beebe’s notebooks." [...] This animal's discovery has had the effect of resurrecting Beebe's theory that leg feathers {{played an important role in}} the origin of bird flight.|$|E
500|$|Kemp {{describes}} Tippett's central {{problem in}} composing A Child of Our Time as [...] integrating {{the language of}} the spirituals with his own musical style. Tippett was, in Kemp's view, entirely successful in this respect; [...] "O by and by", he says, sounds <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> almost have been composed by Tippett. To assist the process of integration the composer had obtained recordings of American singing groups, especially the Hall Johnson Choir, which provided him with [...] a three-part model for determining the relationships between solo voices and chorus in the spirituals: [...] chorus, soloists, chorus. [...] Tippett's instructions in the score specify that [...] "the spirituals should not be thought of as congregational hymns, but as integral parts of the Oratorio; nor should they be sentimentalised but sung with a strong underlying beat and slightly 'swung'".|$|E

500|$|Filming of Horrible Bosses {{took place}} in and around Los Angeles. The {{production}} team attempted to find locations [...] "that people haven't already seen a hundred times in movies and on TV", aiming for the film to appear <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> be taking place anywhere in America [...] "where {{people are trying to}} pursue the American dream but getting stopped by a horrible boss." [...] "Comnidyine" [...] was represented by an office building in Torrance, California, with the crew building the set on a vacant floor. For [...] "Pellitt Chemical", the production team found a [...] "perfect landscape of pipes and containers" [...] in Santa Fe Springs, surrounding an unoccupied water cleaning and storage facility. To take advantage of the surrounding imagery, the warehouse required an extensive series of overhauls, including cutting windows into concrete walls and creating new doorways to allow for visuals of the warehouse exterior and provide a setting for the final scene of Sutherland's character. A T.G.I. Friday's in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, was used as a bar frequented by Nick, Dale, and Kurt, while the bar scene where they meet with Jones was staged in downtown Los Angeles.|$|E
500|$|Rather than {{remaining}} {{limited to}} trying to convince traditional downmarket male buyers to switch to Honda from other brands with the macho approach of most motorcycle advertising at the time, Honda broke new ground. The ad campaign sought to improve the image of motorcycling in general and expand the overall size of the motorcycle market by attracting new riders. In a stroke of good fortune for Honda, Brian Wilson and Mike Love composed the 1964 song [...] "Little Honda", extolling the joys of riding the Honda 50, and even inviting the listener to visit their local Honda dealership, in language that sounded <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> have been written, or at least paid for, by Honda's advertising copywriters, yet {{it was not a}} commercial jingle. The song was released by The Hondells in 1964, followed by the release of the original recording by The Beach Boys. In 1965 The Hondells released [...] "You Meet the Nicest People on a Honda", another song promoting the Super Cub, which was actually used in Honda's TV spots, as a B side to their version of [...] "Sea Cruise." ...|$|E

Success in attracting funding and local authority approval rested in the end on re-styling the development a 'flagship project' rather than a 'civic theatre'. This was analysed in terms of the emerging middle-class discourse of the cultural regeneration of industrial urban centres, and an emerging instrumentalism whereby art, and its facilities, was regarded <b>as</b> worthy <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> be seen to be generating economic benefits.

40|$|Many {{traits of}} dairy cattle such as disease {{resistance}} and type breakdown scores {{may have an}} underlying distribution of values which are approximately normal but must be measured on {{a yes or no}} basis.

Data were generated from a pseudo-normal distribution to test this theory for estimates derived from parent-offspring correlation and paternal sib correlation. The adjustment from theory was quite satisfactory for the paternal sib correlation but would lead to substantial overestimates of heritability on the normal scale when p is small and normal heritability is actually large...|$|R
50|$|Because {{a ruling}} {{in favour of}} a plea of {{insanity}} was basically equated with a verdict of not guilty, it was generally very difficult to obtain.

[...] Soaplife said that the storyline {{may turn out to be}} a good mystery, but [...] "when it comes to affairs, we prefer ours with a heap-big dose of love". However, they later said the storyline was [...] "getting boring". In All About Soap, letters page editor Laura thought the affair would be [...] "the hottest thing in the Square this summer!" [...] Soaplife awarded the storyline a bronze medal in their [...] "2012 Soap Olympics" [...] for [...] "best storyline cycling", as Kat is [...] "cheating again. Round and round she goes."

Yes, it's a bit annoying when your other half is too busy to pay you much attention—but there should at least be an effort to sort out your issues before you decide cheating is the answer! We're finding it hard to have sympathy". The magazine later called the storyline [...] "unusual" [...] but said that [...] "Kat has been busy showing us how infidelity should be done". When the affair turned from lust to love, Soaplife said that it was [...] "what the affair needed right from the start in order to save Kat's reputation."
