5|$|In this bonus round, {{each member}} of the winning team plays the same {{question}} individually. While the first contestant is asked the question, the second is isolated offstage so that they cannot see or hear the question. The two teammates have a total of 40 seconds to <b>answer</b> (<b>in</b> seasons 1 and 2, the time limit was 30 seconds); the clock stops when the first contestant submits an answer, and resumes when the second contestant first sees the question. If one team member answers the question correctly, they receive an additional $1,000; if both answer correctly, their winnings are augmented to $10,000.|$|E

5|$|Like {{many other}} young physicists, Rabi was closely {{following}} momentous events in Europe. He was astounded by the Stern–Gerlach experiment, which convinced {{him of the}} validity of quantum mechanics. With Ralph Kronig, Francis Bitter, Mark Zemansky and others, he set out to extend the Schrödinger equation to symmetric top molecules and find the energy states of such a mechanical system. The problem was that none of them could solve the resulting equation, a second-order partial differential equation. Rabi found the <b>answer</b> <b>in</b> a book by the 19th-century mathematician Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi. The equation had the form of a hypergeometric equation to which Jacobi had found a solution. Kronig and Rabi wrote up their result and sent it to Physical Review, which published it in 1927.|$|E
5|$|Mahayana, writing elsewhere, sees Karman as {{undergoing}} {{an existential}} quest {{to establish his}} identity, seemingly finding an <b>answer</b> <b>in</b> the PKI but ultimately becoming trapped by them. Mahayana indicates that a religious message is evident beginning with the novel's opening, in which Tohari provides a four-line quote from an old Javanese text regarding faith and becoming more explicit later on. He finds Karman's dealing with the raftsman Kastagethek while escaping from the government the most explicit expression of Tohari's intent; unlike Karman, Kastagethek is a devout yet simple man who is happy in his poverty, leading Karman to question his own views before ultimately finding his identity in Islam. Mahayana thus argued that Kubah was meant as dawah, or Islamic preaching, with its message that humans should recognise their status as creatures of God conveyed through characters' dialogue and actions.|$|E

5|$|Bach was in {{his second}} year as Thomaskantor in Leipzig, where the feast was the only {{occasion}} during Lent when festive music was permitted. The theme of the hymn suits both the Annunciation and Palm Sunday, in a spirit of longing expectation of an arrival. An unknown poet retained, as in the other chorale cantatas of Bach's second cantata cycle, the hymn's first and last stanza unchanged, but paraphrased the themes of the inner stanzas to a sequence of alternating recitatives and arias. Bach scored the cantata for three vocal soloists, a four-part choir and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of two horns, two oboes da caccia, two solo violins, strings and continuo. All instruments play in the opening festive chorale fantasia, while the soprano carries the hymn tune and the lower voices <b>answer</b> <b>in</b> counterpoint of instrumental motifs. An oboe da caccia accents the first aria, the solo violins and strings return in the second aria, and an independent horn part crowns the closing chorale.|$|E
5|$|When {{seeking to}} explain this change in the {{complexity}} and style of castles, antiquarians found their <b>answer</b> <b>in</b> the Crusades. It seemed that the Crusaders had learned much about fortification from their conflicts with the Saracens and exposure to Byzantine architecture. There were legends {{such as that of}} Lalys– an architect from Palestine who reputedly went to Wales after the Crusades and greatly enhanced the castles in the south of the country– and it was assumed that great architects such as James of Saint George originated in the East. In the mid-20thcentury this view was cast into doubt. Legends were discredited, {{and in the case of}} James of Saint George it was proven that he came from Saint-Georges-d'Espéranche, in France. If the innovations in fortification had derived from the East, it would have been expected for their influence to be seen from 1100 onwards, immediately after the Christians were victorious in the First Crusade (1096–1099), rather than nearly 100years later. Remains of Roman structures in Western Europe were still standing in many places, some of which had flanking round-towers and entrances between two flanking towers.|$|E
