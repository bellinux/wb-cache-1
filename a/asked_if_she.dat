5|$|Chaplin {{had interviewed}} several actresses {{to play the}} blind flower girl but was unimpressed with them all. While seeing a film shoot with bathing women in a Santa Monica beach, he found a casual acquaintance, Virginia Cherrill. Cherrill waved and <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> would ever {{get the chance to}} work with him. After a series of poor auditions from other actresses, Chaplin {{eventually}} invited her to do a screen test. She was the first actress to subtly and convincingly act blind on camera due to her near-sightedness, and Cherrill signed a contract on November 1, 1928.|$|E
5|$|Lépine {{sat for a}} time in {{the office}} of the {{registrar}} on the second floor. He was seen rummaging through a plastic bag and did not speak to anyone, even when a staff member <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> could help him. He left the office and was subsequently seen in other parts of the building before entering a second floor mechanical engineering class of about sixty students at about 5:10p.m. After approaching the student giving a presentation, he asked everyone to stop everything and ordered the women and men to opposite sides of the classroom. No one moved at first, believing it to be a joke until he fired a shot into the ceiling.|$|E
5|$|The Wheeler family {{stayed at}} the ranch many a summer. In 1900, Wheeler invited his client Phoebe Hearst to visit Wheeler Ranch with his family for the summer. Hearst <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> could {{purchase}} the land, but Wheeler declined. Insistent, Hearst came to an arrangement whereby she would purchase a 99-year lease on part of the land, and she also purchased adjoining land held by Edward Clark, her financial adviser, who called it Wyntoon for the local Wintu tribe. Hearst applied the name Wyntoon to the combination of Clark's former holdings and her new lease, and in 1901 contracted for a magnificent seven-story house to be built. Wheeler was displeased with the extravagant plans, as he and Hearst had previously agreed her building would be modest. However, he did not stop her.|$|E
60|$|When we went {{again to}} the {{hospital}} we saw a nursing sister. She told us that Blanche seemed a little better, and she went in to <b>ask</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> would see her husband. We heard voices in the room in which she lay, and presently the nurse returned {{to say that the}} patient refused to see anyone. We had told her that <b>if</b> <b>she</b> refused to see Dirk the nurse was to <b>ask</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> would see me, but this she refused also. Dirk's lips trembled.|$|R

5|$|The {{sex scenes}} were choreographed by feminist writer and sex {{educator}} Susie Bright. The Wachowskis were fans of Bright {{and sent her}} {{a copy of the}} script with a letter asking her to be an extra in the film. When she read the script she loved it, particularly as it was about women enjoying having sex and not apologizing for it. Disappointed that they never described exactly {{what was happening in the}} sex scenes, she <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> could be a sex consultant for the film and they agreed. The main sex scene set in Corky's apartment was filmed in one long shot. The Wachowskis believed that this would look more realistic than several shots edited together. Although it should have been a closed set, there were actually many people present, moving the walls of the set in order to allow full movement of the camera around the actors.|$|E
5|$|Many {{songs on}} Graduation contain {{background}} vocals provided by Connie Mitchell of the Australian dance music group Sneaky Sound System. The collaboration came about when West met her bandmates Angus McDonald and Daimon Downey at a diner in Sydney while touring {{the country with}} U2 around November 2006. Seeking musical inspiration, West asked McDonald for ideas, who in turn suggested that he be introduced to Mitchell. Upon meeting Mitchell after she arrived at Studios 301 where he was recording music during the tour, West had her sing over a vocal track and quickly took a liking to her voice. U2 singer Bono and guitarist The Edge also complimented Mitchell's singing while visiting the studio. Some time later, Mitchell {{received a call from}} West who <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> could travel to The Record Plant in Los Angeles to begin recording tracks for his third studio album. Mitchell later admitted that while she previously didn't know who Kanye West was and never really cared for hip-hop music, the collaboration has changed her views.|$|E
5|$|Novakovic enjoyed {{filming the}} storyline {{because there was}} so much drama. When she was <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had any sympathy for Natasha during filming, she told Digital Spy that she had to because she needed to {{understand}} how her character is feeling. Novakovic also hoped viewers would have sympathy for Natasha too. The lie starts to grow out of control and Natasha is forced to make up stories about why she does not {{want to go to the}} doctor. She later buys fake ultrasound scan photos over the internet, but Summer becomes suspicious about them and discovers they are from overseas and are fake. Summer realises that Natasha has been lying about being pregnant and reveals the truth in front of Andrew and Natasha's father, shocking Natasha. Andrew does not take the news well and Michael blames himself for his daughter's actions. Novakovic hoped the experience would change Natasha and she would start to grow up. The actress added that Natasha cannot cope by herself and if she continues lying to everyone, they may turn against her.|$|E

5|$|Cisneros and Martínez {{were arrested}} and charged with capital murder, which in Texas is {{punishable}} with a life sentence or death by lethal injection. Cisneros was taken to the Cameron County jail. On her way there, reporters <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> was responsible for Fischer's murder, and she shook her head. Cisneros' husband also refused to comment. The police denied her bail, but her attorney said that she was a respected member of the Brownsville community and deserved bail. Cisneros's attorney told the press that the arrest was a mistake, and that he was confident the police had no solid evidence against her. Police responded by saying they were content with her arrest, but still needed to go after other people involved in the murder plot. Martínez' family also said they were shocked by the arrest, saying they hoped it was a mistake, and {{that they did not know}} the Fischers or Cisneros. On April 13, Cisneros was released from prison on a $300,000 bond, refusing to comment as she left. According to court documents, Cisneros did not go before a judge to obtain a bond. Her attorney reached an agreement with the Cameron County Court District after her bond was denied the week before. Martínez remained in prison, and her bond was set at the same amount the next day. Her lawyer stated that she deserved a bond as well because she was a senior citizen and had a clean criminal record.|$|E

On 17 June, DIMIA {{contacted the}} Australian Embassy in Berlin for assistance in identifying Rau.|$|E

When she had attended his practices, she had stayed out of sight, but enrolled in a class, she followed her parents advice and sat up front.

She was hired as an assistant coach to the varsity and the head coach of the JV.|$|E
25|$|Ángela Peralta {{died in the}} Hotel Iturbide in Mazatlán {{at the age of}} 38 on 30 August 1883. She {{married her}} lover Julián Montiel y Duarte on her deathbed. According to an {{eyewitness}} account of the marriage ceremony, she was already unconscious when it took place. One of the singers from her company, Lemus, supported her by the shoulders. When <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> took Montiel y Duarte as her husband, Lemus moved her head to make it appear that she was nodding her assent. Before her burial in Mazatlán, her body lay in state, dressed in one of her opera costumes and her best jewels. In 1937, her remains were disinterred and brought to the Rotunda de Hombres Ilustres (the Rotunda of Illustrious People) in Mexico City's Panteón de Dolores. Both Mazatlán and San Miguel de Allende have theatres named in her honour.|$|E
