5|$|Thick haze {{and smoke}} {{originating}} from burning biomass in northwestern India <b>and</b> <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> from large industrial cities in northern India often concentrate over the Ganges Basin. Prevailing westerlies carry aerosols {{along the southern}} margins of the sheer-faced Tibetan Plateau towards eastern India and the Bay of Bengal. Dust and black carbon, which are blown towards higher altitudes by winds at the southern margins of the Himalayas, can absorb shortwave radiation and heat the air over the Tibetan Plateau. The net atmospheric heating due to aerosol absorption causes the air to warm and convect upwards, increasing the concentration of moisture in the mid-troposphere and providing positive feedback that stimulates further heating of aerosols.|$|E

The volcanic gases that pose the greatest potential hazard to people, animals, agriculture, and property are sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide and hydrogen fluoride. Locally, sulfur dioxide gas can lead to acid rain <b>and</b> <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> downwind from the volcano. Globally, large explosive eruptions that inject a tremendous volume of sulfur aerosols into the stratosphere can lead to lower surface temperatures and promote weakening of the Earth's ozone layer. Because carbon dioxide gas is heavier than air, the gas may flow into low-lying areas and collect in the soil. The concentration of carbon dioxide gas in these areas can be lethal to people, animals, and vegetation.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, severe <b>and</b> {{persistent}} <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> {{episodes in}} China have drawn wide public concern. Based on ground monitoring air quality data collected in 2015 in Chinese cities above the prefectural level, this study identifies the spatiotemporal variations of <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> <b>and</b> its associated driving factors in China using descriptive statistics and geographical detector methods. The {{results show that}} the average <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> ratio <b>and</b> continuous <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> ratio across Chinese cities in 2015 were 23. 1 ± 16. 9 % and 16. 2 ± 14. 8 %. The highest levels of <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> ratio <b>and</b> continuous <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> ratio were observed in northern China, especially in the Bohai Rim region and Xinjiang province, and the lowest levels were found in southern China. The average and maximum levels of continuous <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> show distinct spatial variations when compared with those of the continuous <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> ratio. Monthly changes in both <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> ratio <b>and</b> continuous <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> ratio have a U-shaped variation, indicating that the highest levels of <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> occurred in winter and the lowest levels happened in summer. The results of the geographical detector model further reveal that the effect intensity of natural factors on the spatial disparity of the <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> ratio is greater than that of human-related factors. Specifically, among natural factors, the annual average temperature, land relief, and relative humidity have the greatest and most significant negative effects on the <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> ratio, whereas human factors such as population density, the number of vehicles, and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) witness the strongest and most significant positive effects on <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> ratio...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Tobacco smoking, passive smoking, <b>and</b> indoor <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> from biomass fuels {{have been}} implicated as {{risk factors for}} {{tuberculosis}} (TB) infection, disease, and death. Tobacco smoking <b>and</b> indoor <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> are persistent or growing exposures in regions where TB poses a major health risk. We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to quantitatively assess the association between these exposures {{and the risk of}} infection, disease, and death from TB. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies reporting effect estimates and 95 % confidence intervals on how tobacco smoking, passive smoke exposure, <b>and</b> indoor <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> are associated with TB. We identified 33 papers on tobacco smoking and TB, five papers on passive smoking and TB, and five on indoor <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> <b>and</b> TB. We found substantial evidence that tobacco smoking is positively associated with TB, regardless of the specific TB outcomes. Compared with people who do not smoke, smokers have an increased risk of having a positive tuberculin skin test, of having active TB, and of dying from TB. Although we also found evidence that passive smoking <b>and</b> indoor <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> increased the risk of TB disease, these associations are less strongly supported by the available evidence. CONCLUSIONS: There is consistent evidence that tobacco smoking is associated with an increased risk of TB. The finding that passive smoking and biomass fuel combustion also increase TB risk should be substantiated with larger studies in future. TB control programs might benefit from a focus on interventions aimed at reducing tobacco <b>and</b> indoor <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> exposures, especially among those at high risk for exposure to TB...|$|R
