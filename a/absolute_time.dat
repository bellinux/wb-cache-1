5|$|The {{phylogeny}} of the teleosts {{has been}} subject to long debate, without consensus on either their phylogeny or {{the timing of the}} emergence of the major groups before the application of modern DNA-based cladistic analysis. Near et al. (2012) explored the phylogeny and divergence times of every major lineage, analysing the DNA sequences of 9 unlinked genes in 232 species. They obtained well-resolved phylogenies with strong support for the nodes (so, the pattern of branching shown is likely to be correct). They calibrated (set actual values for) branching times in this tree from 36 reliable measurements of <b>absolute</b> <b>time</b> from the fossil record. The teleosts are divided into the major clades shown on the cladogram, with dates, following Near et al.|$|E

25|$|Since the {{classical}} Euclidean notion of 'fixed' absolute space explicitly informed the fictive 'moment' of <b>absolute</b> <b>time,</b> the Cubists jettisoned {{the idea of}} placing the observer at a privileged spatial position at a fixed moment in time. Now, according to the theoretical deliberations of Gleizes and Metzinger, artists were free to move around the subject matter, depicting multiple views 'simultaneously', whereby several successive moments in time could be captured and projected onto the canvas at once. In the process, the 'total image' produced {{over a period of}} time was more complete than a single instantaneous view.|$|E

Furthermore, mean teleseismic station residuals reflect the properties of the underlying crust and uppermost mantle.

25|$|Certain {{physical}} paradoxes defy {{common sense}} predictions about physical situations. In some cases, {{this is the}} result of modern physics correctly describing the natural world in circumstances which are far outside of everyday experience. For example, special relativity has traditionally yielded two common paradoxes: the twin paradox and the ladder paradox. Both of these paradoxes involve thought experiments which defy traditional common sense assumptions about time and space. In particular, the effects of time dilation and length contraction are used in both of these paradoxes to create situations which seemingly contradict each other. It turns out that the fundamental postulate of special relativity that the speed of light is invariant in all frames of reference requires that concepts such as simultaneity and <b>absolute</b> <b>time</b> are not applicable when comparing radically different frames of reference.|$|E
25|$|In the 20th century, the Newtonian {{concepts}} of <b>absolute</b> <b>time</b> and space were challenged by relativity. Einstein's {{principle of equivalence}} put all observers, moving or accelerating, on the same footing. This led to an ambiguity as to what exactly is meant {{by the force of}} gravity and weight. A scale in an accelerating elevator cannot be distinguished from a scale in a gravitational field. Gravitational force and weight thereby became essentially frame-dependent quantities. This prompted the abandonment of the concept as superfluous in the fundamental sciences such as physics and chemistry. Nonetheless, the concept remained important in the teaching of physics. The ambiguities introduced by relativity led, starting in the 1960s, to considerable debate in the teaching community as how to define weight for their students, choosing between a nominal definition of weight as the force due to gravity or an operational definition defined by the act of weighing.|$|E

The most unusual contribution is in showing that the proposed faster-than preorder coincides with two other preorders, one of which considers the <b>absolute</b> <b>times</b> at which actions occur in system runs.

2500|$|Isaac Newton [...] {{developed}} new mathematics, including calculus {{and several}} numerical {{methods such as}} Newton's method to solve problems in physics.
