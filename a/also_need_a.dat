500|$|There {{are three}} major {{divergent}} paths in the game's ending, {{depending on how}} the player resolves encounters with monsters: the Neutral run, the Pacifist run, and the Genocide run. The default Neutral run occurs if the player has killed some but not all of the monsters, or has not killed any monsters. The Neutral run has over twelve variations depending on which monsters were killed. In general, in the Neutral run ending, the human arrives at Asgore's castle and learns that they <b>also</b> <b>need</b> <b>a</b> monster's soul to cross the barrier, forcing them to fight Asgore. Sans stops the human before their confrontation, revealing that the human's [...] "LOVE" [...] is an acronym for [...] "Level Of ViolencE" [...] and [...] "EXP" [...] for [...] "EXecution Points." [...] Sans judges the human based on the combined resolution of the encounters. The human fights and defeats Asgore. However, Flowey sneaks in, kills Asgore, steals the human souls, and becomes a monstrous abomination. By calling out to the six souls for help, the human defeats Flowey, falls unconscious, and awakens on the human side of the barrier; they receive a phone call from Sans, explaining the state of the Underground after the human's departure.|$|E
