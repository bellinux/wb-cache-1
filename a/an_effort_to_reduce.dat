5|$|In north Somerset, mining in the Somerset {{coalfield}} was {{an important}} industry, and in <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> the cost of transporting the coal the Somerset Coal Canal was built; {{part of it was}} later converted into a railway. Other canals included the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal, Westport Canal, Grand Western Canal, Glastonbury Canal and Chard Canal. The Dorset and Somerset Canal was proposed, but very little of it was ever constructed.|$|E
5|$|NVC has {{reportedly}} been {{an element of}} a bundle of interventions that produced dramatic changes in forensic psychiatric nursing settings in which {{a high level of}} violence is the norm. NVC was adopted, in combination with other interventions, in <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> violence. The interventions were said to reduce key violence indicators by 90 percent over a three-year period in a medium security unit, and by around 50 percent in a single year in a maximum security unit.|$|E
5|$|In January 2011, Poole {{announced}} the deletion of the /r9k/ ("ROBOT9000") and /new/ (News) boards, saying that /new/ had become devoted to racist discussions, and /r9k/ no longer served its original purpose {{of being a}} test implementation of xkcd's ROBOT9000 script. During the same year, the /soc/ board was created in <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> the number of socialization threads on /b/. /r9k/ was restored on October 23, 2011, along with /hc/ ("Hardcore", previously deleted), /pol/ (a rebranding of /new/) and the new /diy/ board, {{in addition to an}} apology by Poole where he recalls how he criticized the deletion of Encyclopedia Dramatica, and realized that he had done the same.|$|E

5|$|In the König-class ships, each gun turret had {{a working}} chamber beneath it that was {{connected}} to a revolving ammunition hoist leading down to the magazine below. The turrets were electrically controlled, though the guns were elevated hydraulically. In <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> {{the possibility of a}} fire, everything in the turret was constructed of steel. This layout was also used in the preceding battleships. On the Derfflinger-class battlecruisers, the two forward and the superfiring rear turret used this configuration, although the rearmost gun turret had its magazine and shell room inverted.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 21st century, the {{population}} of Paris began to increase slowly again, as more young people moved into the city. It reached 2.25 million in 2011. In March 2001, Bertrand Delanoë became the first socialist mayor of Paris. In 2007, in <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> car traffic in the city, he introduced the Vélib', a system which rents bicycles {{for the use of}} local residents and visitors. Bertrand Delanoë also transformed a section of the highway along the Left Bank of the Seine into an urban promenade and park, the Promenade des Berges de la Seine, which he inaugurated in June 2013.|$|E
5|$|Like the SPARTAN-IIs, the SPARTAN-III {{candidates}} undergo radical cybernetic {{and biological}} enhancements and are outfitted with special armor {{to increase their}} abilities. The first SPARTAN-III company proves highly successful, but is wiped out when ordered to destroy a Covenant orbital shipyard in 2537. Shaken by the massacre of his troops, Kurt improves the training regimen for his next batch of SPARTAN-III recruits, but they too are all killed in action so Kurt, in <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> casualties, institutes illegal biological modifications on the third company of SPARTANs. While conducting a training exercise near Zone 67, UNSC personnel find themselves under attack by alien robotic drones.|$|E

5|$|On September 29, 2010, the U.S. House of Representatives {{approved}} the Rare Earths and Critical Materials Revitalization Act of 2010 (H.R.6160). The approved legislation {{is aimed at}} restoring the U.S. as a leading producer of rare-earth elements, and would support activities in the U.S. Department of Energy (US DoE) to discover and develop rare-earth sites inside of the U.S. in <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> the auto industry's near-complete dependence on China for the minerals. A similar bill, the Rare Earths Supply Technology and Resources Transformation Act of 2010 (S. 3521), is being discussed in the U.S. Senate.|$|E
5|$|Principe di Carignano {{took part}} in the Battle of Lissa on 20 July 1866, where she led the Italian line of battle, but was not heavily engaged. Rendered {{obsolescent}} by the advent of central battery and turret ships in the 1870s, the three Principe di Carignano-class ships did not have particularly long or active service lives. In <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> the maintenance budget to offset the cost of newer ships under construction, Principe di Carignano was stricken from the naval register in 1875; Messina and Conte Verde followed in 1880, the latter just nine years after completion.|$|E
5|$|The open {{nature of}} the New Forest means that ponies are able to wander onto roads. The ponies {{actually}} have right of way over vehicles and many wear reflective collars in <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> traffic fatalities, but despite this, many ponies, along with commoners' cattle, pigs, and donkeys are killed or injured in road traffic accidents every year. Human interaction with ponies is also a problem; well meaning but misguided visitors to the forest frequently feed them, which can create dietary problems and sickness (eg colic) and cause the ponies to adopt an aggressive attitude {{in order to obtain}} human food.|$|E

5|$|Camber Castle {{went through}} several {{changes at the}} start of the 17th century. In 1610, Peter Temple was {{appointed}} as captain of the castle, and between 1610 and 1614 the garrison was reduced to 14 soldiers, including only 4 gunners, either as <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> costs or as a result of the changing types of artillery kept at the castle. The north and south bastions were filled in to form solid gun platforms around approximately 1613 and 1615, and an earth rampart called the Rampire was built up against the south corner of the castle. These solid bastions would have sacrificed living space, less in demand with a smaller garrison, but been much cheaper to maintain. Longbows fell out of use in warfare as archery in England declined, and were replaced by arquebuses and muskets, 46 of which were kept at the castle in 1614.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to safety advice given in its publications, the RNLI offers safety advice to boat and beach users {{when the opportunity}} arises, and to at-risk groups such as anglers, divers and kayakers. The Institution runs sea and beach safety sessions for young people, particularly in inner-city areas; more than 6,000 children a week are spoken to by education volunteers about sea and beach safety, and over 800 children a week receive training. 500 children were taught to swim in 2014. In <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> the estimated 400,000 drownings a year worldwide, {{more than half of}} them children, the RNLI extends practical or strategic safety advice to lifesaver organisations overseas, in some cases providing training at the Lifeboat College.|$|E
5|$|Several {{street gangs}} {{operate in the}} Bay Area, {{including}} the Sureños and Norteños in San Francisco's Mission District. African-American street gangs familiar in other cities, including the Crips, have struggled to establish footholds in the city, although gangs with shotcallers in China, including Triad {{groups such as the}} Wo Hop To, have been reported active. In 1977, an ongoing rivalry between two Chinese gangs led to a shooting attack at the Golden Dragon restaurant in Chinatown, which left five people dead and eleven wounded. Five members of the Joe Boys gang were arrested and convicted of the crime. Oakland, which also sees organized gang violence, implemented Operation Ceasefire in 2012 in <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> the violence.|$|E
