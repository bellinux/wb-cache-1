40|$|The global {{structure}} of galaxy clusters and its evolution are tested within a large set of TREESPH simulations, so to allow <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> statistical comparison with available X-ray data. Structure tests {{are based on}} the "power ratios", introduced by Buote & Tsai. Cosmological models considered are CDM, LCDM (Omega_L= 0. 7) and CHDM (1 mass. neu., Omega_h = 0. 2). All models are normalized to provide <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> <b>number</b> density <b>of</b> clusters. For each model we run a P 3 M simulation in a large box, where we select the most massive 40 clusters. Going back to the initial redshift we run a hydro-TREESPH simulation for each of them. In this way we perform a statistical comparison of the global morphology of clusters, for each cosmological model, with ROSAT data, using Student t-test, F-test and K-S test. The last test and its generalization to 2 [...] D distributions are also used to compare the joint distributions of 2 or 3 power ratios. We find that, using DM distribution, instead of gas, as done by some authors, leads to biased results, as baryons are distributed in a less structured way than DM. We also find that the cosmological models considered have different behaviours in these tests: LCDM has the worst performance. CDM and our CHDM have similar scores. The general trend of power ratio distributions is already fit by these models, but a further improvement is expected either from a different DM mix or a non-flat CDM model.

40|$|This study investigates {{symbolic}} decoration {{arising from}} the house snake cult belief system, as evidenced in Kosovo’s vernacular (popular) architecture. This snake cult certainly has its place among the most unusual and important cults within {{the survival of the}} belief system surrounding the protecting house gods in Albanian popular belief. Among the issues raised in this study, it is posited from the very beginning that because of their character and their symbolism, the decoration {{arising from the}} snake cult has always been applied in the most exposed places or elements of composition since its use had a magic function of protection and bringing good luck. Furthermore, the use of this ornamentation, particularly in the artistic form of bas-relief, is notable for a compositional structure which is in organic harmony with the architectonic and structural aesthetic concept of vernacular building, or its structural elements.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{antinuclear antibody}} (ANA) tests in established cases of {{systemic lupus erythematosus}} (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy (F-ANA) and enzyme-immunoassays detecting antinucleosomal antibodies (ANSA-EIA). METHODS: Sera from 50 patients with SLE and 65 patients with RA were analyzed regarding abnormal concentrations of F-ANA (serum dilution >/= 1 : 200 = 95 th percentile among 300 healthy blood donors). The sera were also analyzed with 2 commercial ANSA-EIA kits. RESULTS: An abnormal F-ANA titer occurred in 76 % of the SLE sera compared to 23 % in RA, and {{was not related to}} present use of antirheumatic drugs. At dilution 1 : 50, 84 % of the SLE sera were F-ANA-positive compared to 20 % of healthy women. Forty percent and 56 %, respectively, of the SLE sera tested positive in the 2 ANSA-EIA kits. By the most sensitive assay, 96 % of the ANSA-positive SLE sera produced a homogenous (chromosomal) F-ANA staining pattern compared to 18 % of the ANSA-negative SLE sera. Ten of the 15 F-ANA-positive RA sera (63 %) generated homogenous F-ANA staining and 13 (20 %) tested positive in the most sensitive ANSA-EIA, but with no correlation to the F-ANA staining pattern. CONCLUSION: The sensitivity of F-ANA at an abnormal titer was surprisingly low (76 %) in established cases of SLE. ANSA occurred in 56 % of the SLE sera, but also in <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> <b>number</b> (20 %) <b>of</b> RA sera. Practically all ANSA-positive SLE sera were identified by chromosomal F-ANA staining.
