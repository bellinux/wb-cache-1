500|$|Director Mark Romanek {{has said}} that, {{as in the}} novel, {{everyone}} has to uncover their relationship to our own mortality; we have two options: either go against it, or {{try to figure out}} a way around it like the character Tommy does. Romanek hoped the audience of Never Let Me Go would be reminded of what is important: love, behaviour, and friendships. He recalled an email a person had written to him: [...] "I saw your film <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> cry and I haven't reacted to a film emotionally like that in years. And I called my father, cause I realized I hadn’t spoken to him in 3 weeks and I told him how much I love him and how much I appreciated what a good father he's been." ...|$|E
500|$|Coldplay vocalist Chris Martin {{revealed}} that the band wrote the first line and the first little melody of the song years prior but did not finish it until 2007. Martin told Rolling Stone magazine that lyrics from the song about [...] "a carnival of idiots on show" [...] and how a [...] "fox became God" [...] were a commentary on Fox News. [...] "One day I was watching Bill O'Reilly, and I was like, 'I know how to finish that song. My best friend, Tim... was having trouble with his boss, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> think {{that so many people}} spend their lives being told what to do by people that they just don't like. So it was that idea, and watching Bill O'Reilly, and all these words just came out." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{regard to}} the episode, Rhimes commented before it {{originally}} aired {{that it was difficult}} to write, largely because of the death of a main character. She compared it to writing the season six finale, by explaining that the former was [...] "more painful" [...] to write. After the episode aired, Rhimes repeated in a tweet that it was hard for her to write the finale, adding: [...] "I did not enjoy it. It made me sick <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> sad." [...] Rhimes also explained the departure of Leigh, whose character died after the plane crash, by saying that the two came to an agreement on the decision to kill Lexie, after extensive discussion. Speaking of Raver's departure whose character left Seattle Grace for MEDCOM, Rhimes elaborated that Raver was offered a contract renewal, but declined.|$|E

500|$|... "My mother {{growing up}} was really, really close friends with an Indian woman. She {{ended up having}} an {{arranged}} marriage oddly enough and I remember going to her wedding {{and it was one}} of the only weddings that I've EVER been to, besides my own mother's, and it was the biggest party, the most fun ever. So when I was doing 'Bounce', you know I don't actually drink or smoke so I thought I don't wanna do a video in a club like poppin' bottles and all this stuff, although the song's about partying. I [...] do a celebration... <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> think of that experience with my mother's friend going to an Indian wedding and having the most crazy and amazing time and I though I wanna do an Indian wedding!

500|$|Mariel Concepcion of Billboard {{wrote that}} she {{first saw the}} video for [...] "The Way You Love Me", it seemed like Hilson was trying a bit hard to her. However, part of her could {{appreciate}} that Hilson does what she wants and that she is confident enough to do it. Concepcion further stated: [...] "Then I watched the above interview she did with Perez Hilton, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> respect her even more. She stood her ground and made no excuses for her words or her visuals, and I can dig that." [...] Niki A. M. of Vibe wrote that Hilson [...] "made quite tails wag with her titillating video" [...] and that [...] "men reeled over the scantily clad vixen gyrating and shouting sexplicit phrases like [...] "fuck me" [...] while females seethed in disappointment over her crotch shots that went viral just days ago." [...] Becky Bain, writing for Idolator, stated that [...] "the stilted dialog between Hilson and Columbus Short {{near the end of}} the mini-movie as well as the former's delivery makes the scene come off like the beginning of a porn movie, and unsurprisingly, the scene ends much like a porn movie." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Ain't No Other Man" [...] {{was directed by}} Bryan Barber and choreographed by Jeri Slaugher. After seeing a trailer of Barber's film project, Idlewild, Aguilera {{wanted to make a}} video directed by him, explained: [...] "It intrigued me that this man, Bryan Barber, had been very locked into and had surrounded himself with this whole world of the '20s and '30s era, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> think that he could understand what I'm trying to do conceptually. I needed to get the right director who shared my vision". At first Aguilera planned to make a black-and-white video and shot it in her living room for Barber and Slaugher. [...] "I had acted out the entire video in my living room. I used my fireplace as a makeshift stage and the staircase as the pool table where I would stand", said Aguilera. According to Barber, Aguilera was very involved in the making of the videot. The whole team seemed like they were doing a movie more than a music video. On June 21, 2006, the music video for [...] "Ain't No Other Man" [...] was premiered on MTV's Total Request Live.|$|E

500|$|On 20 May, two {{flights of}} F-86 Sabres {{encountered}} multiple MiG-15s in MiG Alley, and through radio communications, two additional flights of F-86 Sabres joined the battle, including Jabara. In {{preparation for the}} oncoming battle, Jabara and the other F-86 Sabre pilots were ordered to jettison their auxiliary fuel tanks to improve their maneuverability. Jabara's fuel tank failed to separate from his wing, and protocol required he return to base as the aircraft would be impeded by the extra weight and imbalance, and limit his potential to match off with a MiG. However, Jabara decided to continue to the air battle, where {{he was able to}} still handle his aircraft well enough to be credited with shooting down two MiG-15s with [...]50 caliber machine gun fire. The first was in a group of three MiGs and the other was the last in a six-plane group. Jabara was able to see the first aircraft explode from his gunfire, but he only saw his second victory go into a tailspin as he was avoiding being targeted by another MiG. His fifth and sixth victories made Jabara the first American in history to use jet aircraft to become an ace. The Americans said the 20-minute air battle had included 36 F-86 Sabres against nearly 50 MiG-15s (Russian data shows 30 MiGs), and the American pilots recorded Jabara's two victories and another pilot's [...] "probable". While returning to base, Jabara's F-86 Sabre was so low on fuel, he turned off the engine and glided towards the base before turning it on prior to landing. Data-matching with Soviet records made available {{since the end of the}} Cold War has since shown that only one MiG was lost in the combat, and that Jabara's jet-versus-jet tally was four at best. Nevertheless, American military forces claimed that Jabara was the first jet-versus-jet ace. Jabara later stated in an interview, [...] "That was my bag for the day, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> feel pretty good to know that I was the first jet ace in the history of aerial warfare." [...] The mission was his 63rd Korean mission of an eventual 163; he was awarded a Distinguished Service Cross, the nation's second-highest decoration.|$|E
500|$|Television {{critics have}} responded {{positively}} to the pairing. Robert Canning of IGN {{said of the}} episode [...] "Silly Love Songs": [...] "The absolute best part of [...] "Silly Love Songs" [...] was Puckerman's unexpected longing for Lauren Zizes. Actress Ashley Fink has been fantastic in her small role, delivering great one-liners with ease. She was equally strong in this, the first episode to truly give Lauren a larger role and fill out her character more. Heck, {{it was nice to}} even see her smile a few times. The casting on Glee has either been very smart or very lucky since so many background characters have shined as they've been given bigger parts. The Lauren and Puck pairing came with a lot of laughs, but just as much heart. Puck singing Queen's [...] "Fat Bottomed Girls," [...] induced a chuckle at first, then some toe tapping. But it was Lauren's reaction that truly made the moment: 'That's the first song you've sung to me <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> feel like crap.' I can't decide if I want to root for this couple, but I certainly know I'm going to be rooting for Lauren." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club commented: [...] "For me, the episode's highlight was the very sweet, funny courtship between Puck and Lauren. This may be because the writers have trouble writing for a self-professed bad boy, even though his escapades are straight out of Archie comics and not actually all that “bad” at all. But it’s always fun to watch Salling sing, and it’s always fun to watch him be smitten. Fink ends up being a good match for him, chemistry-wise, as she projects a confidence and certainty that makes it immediately obvious just what Puck sees in Lauren. The storyline also played out like both characters had something approaching real feelings." [...] In the following episode, VanDerWerff found her relationship with Puck [...] "a lot less assured" [...] than before, but Entertainment Weekly Sandra Gonzalez deemed their scenes [...] "as endearing as they are unrealistic", and E! Online's Jenna Mullins wrote that [...] "the ice around [...] heart melted just a bit when Puck mouthed Lauren that little bit of encouragement at the start of her solo." ...|$|E

Myles auditioned on videotape in her home, performing her scenes as swiftly as she could before her child made noise or needed attention. Ten days after submitting her video audition, Myles learned she'd won the role. After being cast in series two, Myles received the script for the first episode. [...] "I kept it for bedtime; lights off, iPad out, cup of tea in bed," [...] she said. [...] "It was amazing, like watching a film, the writing is so good.

While Hall was an aggressive fast bowler, he was not one to set out to injure the batsman. The England cricketer Ted Dexter—himself hit several times by Hall—said [...] "there was never a hint of malice in [...] or in his bowling".

I never thought it would be on something called Zack and Miri Make a Porno. What? So I went and I read the script at his house and I was prepared to say no. I thought I have the perfect out.

2500|$|The [...] "Assembly Cut" [...] {{has several}} key plot {{elements}} {{that differ from}} the theatrical release. The alien gestates in an ox rather than a dog, {{and one of the}} inmates discovers a dead facehugger. Ripley's unconscious body washes up on the shore of the planet in the Assembly Cut instead of being found in the ship's wreckage as in the theatrical cut. Some scenes are extended to focus more on the religious views of the inmates. The inmates succeed in their attempt to trap the alien, but it is later released by the disturbed inmate Golic. In this version, the alien Queen does not burst from Ripley's chest as she falls into the furnace. There is also a scene in the prison's assembly hall in which one of the inmates suggests to Dillon that they lead the creature to the furnace so that they can incinerate it. One notable scene that was not restored for the DVD or Blu-ray extended versions was the full autopsy scene. Greg Cannom, who worked on the special make-up effects, said in the Alien Quadrilogy special features that, [...] "I saw the rough cut of the film, uncut, and there were some scenes in there that were pretty gross. There was an autopsy scene on the girl [...] and I like certain gore in the films. I do it , <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> sick. It really grossed me out and I remember people got up and left, walked out of the theatre and I was just thinking, 'This will never be in the film. They can't show this stuff.'
