The main contribution of our work is a fully <b>automatic</b> <b>mapping</b> <b>system</b> that operates {{without the use of}} active ranger sensors (such as laser or sonic transducers), can operate in real-time and can consistently produce accurate maps of large-scale environments. Our approach implements a Rao-Blackwellised particle filter (RBPF) to solve the simultaneous localization and mapping problem and uses efficient data structures for real-time data association, mapping, and spatial reasoning. We employ a hybrid map representation that infers 3 D point landmarks from image features to achieve precise localization, coupled with occupancy grids for safe navigation. This paper describes our framework and implementation, and presents our exploration method, and experimental results illustrating the functionality of the system. I...|$|E

We have designed a comprehensive framework called OntoGrate which combines a highly <b>automatic</b> <b>mapping</b> <b>system,</b> a logic inference engine, and several syntax wrappers that inter-operate with consistent semantics to answer ontology-based queries using the data from heterogeneous databases. There are several major contributions of our OntoGrate research: (i) we designed an ontology-based framework that provides a unified semantics for mapping discovery and query translation by transforming database schemas to Semantic Web ontologies; (ii) we developed a highly automatic ontology mapping system which leverages object reconciliation and multi-relational data mining techniques; (iii) we developed an inference-based query translation algorithm and several syntax wrappers which can translate queries and answers between relational databases and the Semantic Web. The testing results of our implemented OntoGrate system in different domains show that {{the large amount of}} data in relational databases can be directly utilized for answering Semantic Web queries rather than first converting all relational data into RDF or OWL...|$|E

40|$|International audienceAutomatic {{orientation}} mapping is an important: {{addition to}} standard capabilities of conventional {{transmission electron microscopy}} (TEM) as it facilitates investigation of crystalline materials. A number of different such <b>mapping</b> <b>systems</b> have been implemented. One of their crucial characteristics is the orientation resolution. The precision in determination of orientations and misorientations reached in practice by TEM-based <b>automatic</b> <b>mapping</b> <b>systems</b> is the main subject of the paper. The analysis is Focused on two methods: first, using spot diffraction patterns and `template matching', and second, using Kikuchi patterns and detection of reflections. In simple terms, for typical mapping conditions, their precisions in orientation determination with the confidence of 95 % are, respectively, 1. 1 degrees and 0. 3 degrees. The results are illustrated by example maps of cellular structure in deformed Al, the case for which high orientation sensitivity matters. For more direct comparison, a novel approach to mapping is used: the same patterns are solved by {{each of the two}} methods. Proceeding from a classification of the <b>mapping</b> <b>systems,</b> the obtained results may serve as indicators of precisions of other TEM-based orientation mapping methods. The findings are of significance for selection of methods adequate to investigated materials...|$|R

These events are usually dynamic and occur in short time duration. In this study, a real time volcanic activity mapping system, using single ground fixed digital camera, is developed. An <b>automatic</b> <b>mapping</b> <b>system</b> is designed for real time monitoring. This system produces orthophotos as final outputs from digital landscape images. Once a digital landscape image is obtained, the final output is generated concurrently. A digital landscape photo is rectified into 3 D computer graphics to obtain texture image with fixed location and attitude. This 3 D computer graphics is created from DEM and is used as a reference image. Rectification is done by skyline matching between the edge of a skyline in the digital landscape image and in the 3 D computer graphics. The rectified digital landscape image is converted to an orthophoto map using DEM. Through this system, volcanic activity is automatically mapped as orthophoto on real time basis. This system helps chronological change analysis {{of volcanic}} activity, especially for short time period. Volcanic activities mapped by this system would be analyzed by volcanologists to help people escape hazards from volcanic eruption. 1...|$|E

VisionMap A 3 system is a fully automated mapping system. The system is comprised of an airborne digital step-framing double lens metric camera and a ground processing system. During the flight a sequence of frames is exposed in a cross-track direction at a very high speed in order to provide a very wide angular coverage of the ground, thus acquiring both vertical and oblique images. The airborne system consists of dual CCDs with two 300 mm lenses, a fast compression and storage unit, and a dual frequency GPS. The scanning mechanism of the camera provides a FOV of up to 104 degrees. The post-processing system consists of a PC server configuration and software that processes the data obtained during the flight into mapping products in an automatic manner. The workflow normally carried out in a typical flight consists of the following: flight planning, aerial survey, copying images and meta-data from the camera storage unit, aerial triangulation block adjustment, digital surface model (DSM) creation, digital terrain model (DTM) creation, orthophoto and mosaic production. All the processes are executed in a fully automated mode. The technology is patent pending. 1...|$|E
40|$|An on-line <b>automatic</b> <b>mapping</b> <b>system</b> was {{developed}} for beat by beat display of epicardial activation during ventricular tachycardia induced {{at the time of}} cardiac surgery. A sock array of 110 button electrodes was used to record and display local activation on a video monitor at 8. 3 ins intervals. On instant replay in slow motion, epicardial pacing sites were accurately localized to the nearest electrode. Local unipolar electrograms were also recorded, first from the sock array, then from an array of 16 transmural needle electrodes. The epicardial display was verified by retrospective manually derived maps using the recorded epicardial electrograms. In four patients with coronary artery disease and recurrent inducible ventricular tachycardia, earliest epicardial activation was located on slow motion replay within 1 minute. Subendocardial sites of early activation were located within 10 minutes by replay of electrograms from the needle array before ventriculotomy. Transmural and endocardial resection of these sites prevented inducibility of the tachycardia on postoperative electrophysiologic study in three of the four patients. There has been no clinical recurrence of ventricular tachycardia after 3 to 14 months of follow-up despite cessation of antiarrhythmic therapy in three of the patients. This technique has unique advantages over existing mapping methods. It provides beat by beat display of activation sequences so that clinical tachycardias that are short in duration or pleomorphic in configuration now become amenable to mapping. In addition, it markedly shortens total time on cardiopulmonary bypass...|$|E

40|$|Real-time {{analysis}} of data reported by environmental monitoring networks poses a number of challenges, {{one of which is}} the conversion of point measurements of phenomena that display some spatial dependence into maps. This is the case for the many variables that cannot be monitored efficiently over large regions by satellites. Environmental pollutants, radiation levels, rainfall fields and seismic activity are but a few of these variables that are usually interpolated for the production of maps. These maps will then further serve as an essential support for decision-making. Ideally, in order to allow real-time assessments and minimize human intervention in case of hazards and emergencies that are frequently linked to the above mentioned variables (e. g. air pollution peaks, nuclear accidents, flash-floods, earthquakes), these maps should be established in near real-time and thus automatically. The ability of real-time <b>mapping</b> <b>systems</b> running in the routine mode to be able to cope with extreme events is not straightforward, and few systems are today used automatically for both monitoring the environment and triggering early warnings in case of necessity. Alternatively, adopting a decision-centered view of environmental monitoring and <b>mapping</b> <b>systems</b> allows us to re-formulate their final objective as a classification problem that consists of discriminating routine against emergency conditions, or background information against outliers.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{mapping of}} {{ventricular}} arrhythmias in humans using a minibasket 64 -electrode catheter {{paired with a}} novel <b>automatic</b> <b>mapping</b> <b>system</b> (Rhythmia) has not been evaluated. OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of mapping ventricular arrhythmias and clinical outcomes after ablation using this system. METHODS: Electroanatomic maps for ventricular arrhythmias were obtained during 20 consecutive procedures in 19 patients (12 with ventricular tachycardia [VT] and 2 with ventricular ectopy [VE]). High-density maps were acquired using automatic beat acceptance and automatic system annotation of electrograms. RESULTS: Forty-seven electroanatomic maps (including 3 right ventricular and 9 epicardial maps) were obtained. Left ventricular endocardial mapping by transseptal (n = 13) and/or transaortic (n = 11) access was safe with no complications related to the minibasket catheter. VT substrate maps (n = 14; median 10, 184 points) consistently demonstrated late potentials with high resolution. VT activation maps (n = 25; median 6401 points) obtained by automatic annotation included 7 complete maps (covering â‰¥ 90 % of the tachycardia cycle length) in 5 patients in whom the entire VT circuit was accurately visualized. VE timing maps (n = 8) successfully localized the origin of VEs in all, with all accepted beats consistent with clinical VEs. Over a median follow-up of 10 months, no arrhythmia recurrence was noted in 75 % after VT ablation and 86 % after VE ablation. CONCLUSION: In this first human experience for ventricular arrhythmias using this system, ultra-high-density maps were created rapidly and safely, with a reliable automatic annotation of VT and consistent recording of abnormal electrograms. Medium-term outcomes after ablation were encouraging. Further larger studies are needed to validate these findings...|$|E

40|$|In {{the case}} of a severe nuclear accident, {{radionuclides}} may be released into the atmosphere and contaminate large areas. Essential information for decision making and further modelling are maps that describe the radiological situation. Radiological maps are obtained after a spatial interpolation process that converts local measurements into information continuous in space. Ideally, the mapping process should be fully automatic and provide information in real time. It is {{the purpose of this paper}} to discuss results obtained from two statistical exercises that addressed the issue of automating the spatial interpolation step both in routine and emergency situations. The first exercise addressed mainly the current state of the art of mapping deposited radioactivity following an accident in wet conditions and explored the impact of human factors on the results obtained. The second exercise, conceptually similar to the first one, involved real gamma dose rate measurements to address specifically the automation issue. To further address the response of these mapping algorithms in emergency situations, simulated data have also been used to explore the impact of extreme values on the process. It is shown that if results tend to be similar in routine situations, independently of the choice of algorithms, many obstacles still remain before we can rely on fully <b>automatic</b> <b>mapping</b> <b>systems</b> in emergency situations, especially during the early and critical stage of an accident when measurements on the contamination are sparse.

The down loading of the simulation of the system has to be performed to verify that the simulation package will translate the simulation code into robot code. Also a simulation of this system has to be programmed for a gantry robot instead of the articulating robot that is presently in the system. It was discovered using the simulation package that the articulation robot cannot reach all the point {{on some of the}} panels, therefore when the system is ready for production, a gantry robot will be used. Also a hydrosensor system {{is being developed}} to replace the point-to-point contact probe. The hydrosensor will allow the robot to perform a non-contact continuous scan of the panel. It will also provide a faster scan of the panel because it will eliminate the in-and-out movement required for the present end effector. The system software is currently being modified so that the hydrosensor will work with the system. The hydrosensor consists of a Krautkramer-Branson transducer encased in a plexiglass nozzle. The water stream pumped through the nozzle is the couplant for the probe. Also, software is being written so that the robot will have the ability to draw the contour lines on the panel displaying the out-of-tolerance regions.

Labels are a key for {{the perception of the}} presented map. Comparing labeled map elements with airport signage enables the crew to constantly cross check their position. This reduces the risk of inadvertently entering a wrong taxiway or runway and the risk of related mishaps. The goal of this work is the development of an <b>automatic</b> <b>map</b> labeling <b>system</b> for airport moving maps. The development of the system is based on a thorough analysis of structure and contents of the most comprehensive aerodrome mapping database world-wide. The design focuses on a high quality and good legibility of the computed labeling solutions. Key aspects are the display of the right information at the right point in time, an unambiguous association of labels to their related map elements, and fully deconflicted labels. The completeness and correctness of data must be guaranteed in all processing steps in order to fulfill the strict requirements for aviation use. The target format as well as required source data and display parameters are defined by analyses of existing paper charts. An expert system is used to accomplish the necessary data conversion. A hierarchical data structure is generated with levels-of-detail fitting to different map scales. Position candidates for different label types are defined based on the hierarchical data structures.
