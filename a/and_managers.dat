5|$|Baseball writer-scorers usually {{worked at}} the games played at the home stadium of the team which they covered for their newspaper. The writer-scorers were tasked with making {{objective}} decisions that could impact the statistics of the team they were writing about.

5|$|Currently, {{all members}} (players, coaches, <b>and</b> <b>managers)</b> {{of the top}} three teams receive medals with an {{insignia}} of the World Cup Trophy; winners' (gold), runners-up' (silver), and third-place (bronze). In the 2002 edition, fourth-place medals were awarded to hosts South Korea. Before the 1978 tournament, medals were only awarded to the eleven players on the pitch {{at the end of the}} final and the third-place match. In November 2007, FIFA announced that all members of World Cup-winning squads between 1930 and 1974 were to be retroactively awarded winners' medals.|$|E

The 40 AL titles won by the Yankees places them 17 {{in front of the}} Cardinals for the most pennants won by an MLB team. The Giants and Dodgers are the only other clubs with 20 or more pennants. The Baseball Hall of Fame has inducted over 40 players <b>and</b> <b>managers</b> who have worn Yankees pinstripes.

5|$|In 2013, Corzine, <b>and</b> <b>managers</b> {{including}} Bradley Abelow and Henri Steenkamp, appealed a {{court ruling}} relating to repayments to customers of the bankrupt brokerage. A spokesman for Mr. Corzine {{made clear that}} the appeal was not an attempt to delay payments to customers, but due to a disagreement regarding how those claims would be handled by the trustee after they were paid. Mr. Corzine fully supported customers receiving 100 percent of their money and had no desire for this to be delayed. There was nothing preventing the trustee from making full distributions immediately and litigating the appeal after the fact. Ultimately all customers were paid in full.|$|E
5|$|The All-Star Game {{managers}} {{selected the}} entire lineups from 1933 to 1946. In 1947, the fans {{were given the}} ability to select the starting lineups. This continued until 1957, when Cincinnati Reds fans stuffed the ballot box and selected seven Reds and Stan Musial. This forced Baseball Commissioner Ford Frick {{to step in and}} replace Wally Post and Gus Bell with Willie Mays and Hank Aaron that season and to turn over the starting lineup selection to players, coaches <b>and</b> <b>managers</b> for several subsequent seasons. Since 1970, the fans have elected the starting lineup of one player for each baseball position (except the pitcher) for both the National League and American League teams.|$|E

5|$|The departures of Núñez and Louis van Gaal {{were hardly}} noticed by the fans when {{compared}} to that of Luís Figo, then club vice-captain. Figo had become a cult hero and was considered by Catalans to be one of their own. Barcelona fans, however, were distraught by Figo's decision to join arch-rivals Real Madrid, and, during subsequent visits to the Camp Nou with Madrid, Figo was given an extremely hostile reception. Upon his first return, a piglet's head and a full bottle of whiskey were thrown at him from the crowd. The next three years saw the club in decline, <b>and</b> <b>managers</b> came and went. Van Gaal was replaced by Llorenç Serra Ferrer who, despite an extensive investment in players in the summer of 2000, presided over a mediocre league campaign and a humiliating first-round Champions League exit, and was eventually dismissed late in the season.|$|E
5|$|The nomenklatura {{political}} elite developed. It comprised leaders, administrators <b>and</b> <b>managers</b> within {{the ruling party}} structure, in all branches of central and local government and in institutions of all kinds. The nomenklatura members were appointed by the party and exercised political control in all spheres of public life, for example economic development, industry management or education. For the party, the privileged nomenklatura layer was maintained to assure the proper placement {{of people who were}} ideologically reliable and otherwise qualified, but the revisionist dissidents Jacek Kuroń and Karol Modzelewski later described this system as a class dictatorship of central political bureaucracy for its own sake. The Polish public widely approved the many social undertakings of the communist government, including family apartment construction, child care, worker vacation and resorts, health care and full employment policies, but the special privileges granted nomenklatura and the security services were resented.|$|E
5|$|Vocally, {{the support}} from Stockport fans {{has often been}} cited by {{managers}} and players as inspirational and a huge boost to the team during play, with their influence likened to having a twelfth player on the field. Stockport supporters often receive praise from other players <b>and</b> <b>managers,</b> {{both at home and}} away, for their vocal support. Between the 2006–07 and 2009–10 seasons the squad number 12 was allocated to the 'Blue & White Army', in reference to the supporters being the team's 12th man on matchdays. However, for the 2010–11 season, the number reverted to one of the players.|$|E

5|$|While Shay was {{managing}} at Kansas City in early 1910, American Association president Thomas Chivington imposed new conduct {{rules for the}} league. The new system emphasized fines for players <b>and</b> <b>managers</b> rather than simply ejecting them when they behaved poorly. After Shay was ejected from three games in a four-game span, a Minnesota newspaper article questioned whether his behavior {{would be subject to}} additional disciplinary action. The next month, Shay released 48-year-old Jake Beckley, prompting his retirement after one of the longest careers in professional baseball history. The first baseman had tried to make the Kansas City team after 20 years in the National League.|$|E
5|$|A {{technically}} gifted, {{and creative}} supporting forward, {{who was also}} a free-kick specialist, Del Piero is widely regarded by players, pundits, <b>and</b> <b>managers</b> {{as one of the greatest}} players of his generation, and as one of the best Italian players of all time, winning the Serie A Italian Footballer of the Year award in 1998 and 2008. A prolific goal-scorer, he is currently the second highest all-time Italian top-scorer in all competitions, with 346 goals, behind only Silvio Piola, with 390 goals; he is also the joint ninth highest goalscorer in Serie A history, with 188 goals, alongside Giuseppe Signori and Alberto Gilardino. After beginning his career with Italian club Padova in Serie B in 1991, he moved to Juventus F.C. in 1993, where he played for 19 seasons (11 as captain), and holds the club records for most goals (290) and appearances (705). During his time at the club, he won six Serie A titles, the Coppa Italia, four Supercoppa Italiana titles, the UEFA Champions League, the UEFA Super Cup, the UEFA Intertoto Cup, and the Intercontinental Cup. After leaving the club in 2012, he also spent two seasons with Australian side Sydney FC; he retired after a season with Delhi Dynamos FC in the Indian Super League, in 2014.|$|E
5|$|Bath Rugby is a rugby union {{team in the}} Aviva Premiership league. It {{plays in}} black, blue and white kit at the Recreation Ground in the city, {{where it has been}} since the late 19th century, {{following}} its establishment in 1865. The team's first major honour was winning the John Player Cup, now sponsored as the LV Cup and also known as the Anglo-Welsh Cup, four years consecutively from 1984 until 1987. The team then led the Courage league in six seasons in eight years between 1988–89 and 1995–96, during which time it also won the renamed Pilkington Cup in 1989, 1990, 1992, 1994, 1995 and 1996. It finally won the Heineken Cup in the 1997–98 season, and topped the Zürich Premiership (now Aviva Premiership) in 2003–04. The team's squad includes several members who also play, or have played in the English national team, including Lee Mears, Rob Webber, Dave Attwood, Nick Abendanon and Matt Banahan. Colston's School, Bristol, has had a large input in the team over the past decade, providing several current 1st XV squad members. The former England Rugby Team Manager and former Scotland national coach Andy Robinson used to play for Bath Rugby team and was captain and later coach. Both of Robinson's predecessors, Clive Woodward and Jack Rowell, as well as his successor Brian Ashton, were also former Bath coaches <b>and</b> <b>managers.</b>|$|E
