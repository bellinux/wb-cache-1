5|$|In early December 2008, it was {{announced}} that Twilight director Catherine Hardwicke would not be returning to direct the sequel. Hardwicke cited time restrictions as the reason behind her leaving the project. Instead, Chris Weitz, director of The Golden Compass and co-director of <b>American</b> <b>Pie,</b> was hired to direct The Twilight Saga: New Moon. Filming for New Moon began in Vancouver in late March 2009, and in Montepulciano, Italy, in late May 2009.|$|E
5|$|Animal House {{was a great}} {{box office}} success despite its limited {{production}} costs and started an industry trend, inspiring other comedies such as Porky's, the Police Academy films, the <b>American</b> <b>Pie</b> films, Up the Academy (made by their rival magazine company: MAD), and Old School among others. Belushi became the most successful male comedy star in the world until his 1982 death; Bacon also became a star, and he, Matheson, and Allen are {{among those who have}} had lengthy acting careers. Reitman, Landis, and Ramis became successful filmmakers; Landis' use of dramatic actors and soundtrack to make the comedy believable became the traditional approach for film comedies.|$|E
50|$|In 2007 came American High School, a feature-comedy {{he wrote}} and directed, {{starring}} Laguna Beach alum Talan Torriero, with Danity Kane's Aubrey O'Day. The movie also stars Pirates of the Caribbean's Martin Klebba and <b>American</b> <b>Pie's</b> Nikki Ziering.|$|R

50|$|During the broadcast, Ryan's pie was {{identified}} as a key lime pie. However, it was made with ordinary limes rather than key limes, and thus was not a key lime pie. Moreover, the pies described as American-style were actually tarts. <b>American</b> <b>pies</b> are baked in a smooth, slant sides pie pan, not the fluted tart pans that were used.|$|R
5|$|Despite the cost, {{the album}} was an {{immediate}} commercial success. In America, it spent six weeks at number 2 on the Billboard Top LPs chart, kept from the top by Don McLean's <b>American</b> <b>Pie,</b> {{which was one of}} the top-selling albums there for 1972. On the other US charts, compiled by Cash Box and Record World, the live album peaked at number 2 and number 1, respectively. In the UK, The Concert for Bangladesh became Harrison's second number 1 album, after All Things Must Pass in early 1971. The album was certified gold by the RIAA on 4 January 1972 for sales of over 500,000 units.|$|E
5|$|As {{predicted}} {{through the}} actions of the boys in the film, there were numerous news reports of underage South Park fans engaging in unsuccessful attempts to gain entrance to the film at theaters. There were reports of adolescents purchasing tickets for WB's own Wild Wild West and instead sitting in to see South Park. This came {{as a result of a}} movie-industry crackdown that would make it tougher for children to sneak into R-rated films, as proposed by President Bill Clinton at the time in response to the moral panic generated by the Columbine High School massacre, which occurred two months before the film's release. South Park was cited, along with <b>American</b> <b>Pie,</b> as an explicit film released in the summer of 1999 tempting teens to sneak into theaters. When the film was released in the United Kingdom in August 1999, there were similar reports of the film drawing an underage crowd.|$|E

The canal now runs under the legs of an electricity pylon. The market hall closed on New Year's Eve 1999 and became the Civic Hall in 2001. Four years later, the area designated for retail space became exhibition space. There were plans to reopen the market and let the retail hall out to private contractors, though this came to naught. The town's cinema, the Palace, closed on 31 August 2003, with the last film being <b>American</b> <b>Pie</b> 3: The Wedding. The cinema has since been converted to become Rififi Nightclub and Amber Lounge Bar & Restaurant, which itself was closed down late in 2012 after two violent incidents on the same night.|$|E
25|$|UCLA has {{attracted}} filming for decades with {{its proximity to}} Hollywood. Much of the film Gotcha! (1985) was shot at UCLA, as well as John Singleton's Higher Learning (1995). Legally Blonde (2001), Old School (2003), The Nutty Professor (1995), Erin Brockovich (2000), How High (2001), National Lampoon's Van Wilder (2002), <b>American</b> <b>Pie</b> 2 (2001), and Bring It On Again (2004) were all mainly shot around campus. In January 2009, the Bollywood movie My Name is Khan (2010) was shot at UCLA. UCLA is also often cast as Stanford in television shows such as The Mindy Project and Chuck. Some of the exterior shots of the fictional UC Sunnydale in Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and ABC Family original series Greek were also filmed at UCLA. In response to the major demand for filming, UCLA has instated a policy to regulate filming and professional photography at the campus.|$|E

500|$|<b>American</b> <b>Pie</b> Presents: The Naked Mile, {{the second}} {{spin-off}} to the <b>American</b> <b>Pie</b> film series, was a commercial success, and Universal Pictures {{prepared for a}} sequel. The Naked Miles writer, Erik Lindsay, pitched the film by saying: [...] "Look, we're not going to top Animal House of course, but it's been 25 years. I was in a fraternity for six years. Let's just make a straight pledging movie." [...] Universal gave Lindsay {{the green light to}} write Beta House, and also hired Andrew Waller and The Naked Miles producer, W. K. Border, as the film's director and producer, respectively. The film's screenplay was based on characters by Adam Herz and on aspects of Lindsay's own life. Lindsay felt that Universal being unworried about making the film similar to Animal House provided [...] "more opportunities to keep the story organic," [...] which he found the challenge of writing a sequel.|$|E

[...] DVD Talk's Jeffrey Robinson writes that [...] "if anything, it will bore you and leave you wondering why you wasted {{an hour and a}} half of your life." [...] Writing in JoBlo.com, Adam Quigley poked fun at the film's themes, declaring that [...] "if there's a lesson to be taken from these films, it's that women are objects, and should always be treated as such." [...] IGNs Hock Teh gave the film 5/10, writing that it [...] "stays very close to the <b>American</b> <b>Pie</b> formula," [...] while criticizing the story as [...] "devoid of anything remotely semi-compelling or even noteworthy."

5000|$|Much of the {{animosity}} toward the team may derive from its high payroll (which was around $200 {{million at the}} start of the 2008 season, the highest of any American sports team), and the free agent superstars the team attracts in the offseason.

500|$|When {{originally}} {{submitted to}} the Motion Picture Association of America rating board, But I'm a Cheerleader received an NC-17 rating. In {{order to get a}} commercially viable R rating, Babbit removed a two-second shot of Graham's hand sweeping Megan's clothed body, a camera pan up Megan's body when she is masturbating, and a comment that Megan [...] "ate Graham out" [...] (slang for cunnilingus). Babbit was interviewed by Kirby Dick for his 2006 documentary film This Film Is Not Yet Rated. A critique of the MPAA's rating system, it suggests that films with homosexual content are treated more stringently than those with only heterosexual content, and that scenes of female sexuality draw harsher criticism from the board than those of male sexuality. It compares this movie to <b>American</b> <b>Pie</b> (also released in 1999), which features a teenage boy masturbating and was given an R rating (though <b>American</b> <b>Pie</b> also originally received an NC-17 rating and also required cuts to its masturbation scene to reduce its rating to R). Babbit says that she felt discriminated against for making a gay film. The film was rated as M (for mature audiences) in Australia and in New Zealand, 14A in Canada, 12 in Germany and 15 in the United Kingdom.|$|E

5000|$|Apple pie {{was brought}} to the colonies by the British, Dutch, and Swedes during the 17th and 18th centuries. The apple pie had to wait for the {{planting}} of European varieties, brought across the Atlantic, to become fruit-bearing apple trees, to be selected for their cooking qualities as there were no native apples except crabapples, which yield very small and sour fruit. In the meantime, the colonists were more likely to make their pies, or [...] "pasties", from meat, calling them coffins (meaning basket) rather than fruit; and the main use for apples, once they were available, was in cider. However, there are <b>American</b> apple <b>pie</b> recipes, both manuscript and printed, from the 18th century, and it has since become a very popular dessert. Apple varieties are usually propagated by grafting, as clones, but in the New World, planting from seeds was more popular, which quickly {{led to the development of}} hundreds of new native varieties.|$|R
