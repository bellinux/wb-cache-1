40|$|Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) {{belongs to}} the group of plants that produce {{agricultural}} raw material. Besides leaves, which are used to satisfy the passion for smoking, tobacco can be used for producing oil and biodiesel, because it contains 30 - 40 % of vegetable oil. Because of its content of citric <b>acid,</b> <b>tobacco</b> can be used for production of dyes and varnishes. Seed cake contains high percentage of proteins (35 - 44 %) and can be used as livestock feed. Because of the high contents of lignin (40 - 45 %) and cellulose (28 - 40 %), tobacco stems can be used for production of energy briquettes, which makes tobacco obtain a new usability value. The aim of the experimental researches presented in this paper is to define the possibilities for production of briquettes from tobacco stems and wood raw material and to evaluate the impact of this kind of raw material on briquettes properties. For this purpose five models were made: O-control model: 100 % wood raw material (BW); model T-I - 25 % tobacco stems (TS) : 75 % BW; model T-II - 50 % TS : 50 % BW; model T-III - 75 % TS : 25 % BW and model T-IV - 100 % TS. The results of the research show that density of the briquettes is within the limits of 526. 61 kg/m 3 for model T-IV, to 782. 73 kg/m 3 for control model-O. The ash content is a little lower than the standard values and it ranges from 0. 32 % for O-control model, to 2. 17 % for model T-IV. The sulphur content is much below permissible content (0. 08 %), and it ranges from 0. 003 to 0. 008 %. These briquettes, according to the low calorific value are classified in II and I class. In the smoke of the burned briquettes, minimal quantity (0. 005 %) of nicotine is identified...|$|E

5000|$|More unprotonated {{nicotine}} {{in tobacco}} smoke increases smoke [...] "strength", [...] "impact", or [...] "kick". However, the irritation and harshness of smoke at higher pH {{makes it harder}} for smokers to inhale it. Cigarette design ensures that the smoke has enough unprotonated nicotine to rapidly transfer nicotine into the brain but not so much of it as to be too harsh for the smoker. Variability in the acid-base nature of tobacco leaf is considerable. Flue-cured ("bright") tobacco typically produces acidic smoke, whereas air-cured ("burley") tobacco typically produces basic smoke. The natural <b>acids</b> in <b>tobacco</b> smoke (e.g., formic acid, acetic acid, and propionic acid) can protonate nicotine, while the natural bases (e.g., ammonia) tend to neutralize the acids and keep more nicotine in the unprotonated form.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a technique using microwave digestion and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), which makes possible {{the analysis of}} protein amino <b>acids</b> in <b>tobacco.</b> The technique involves first the measurement of free amino acids, a hydrolysis using microwave digestion, and a measurement of total resulting amino acids. The content of protein amino acids is determined from the difference of total and free amino acids.

The GC-MS analysis is performed after the amino acids are derivatized with N-methyl-N-(t-butyldimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide (MTBSTFA). The technique provides reliable results with less than 10 % relative standard deviation (RSD) for most amino acids. Only the determination of very low level amino acids is affected by larger errors. The method provides results for free amino acids that are in very good agreement with those obtained by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and also results for protein levels in tobacco in agreement with data previously reported in the literature.

The deduced protein sequences are homologous to E. coli ribosomal proteins L 12 (involved in GTP hydrolysis), L 24 (a ribosomal RNA binding protein) and L 27 (a constituent of peptidyltransferase). The full-length cDNA encoding tobacco chloroplast ribosomal protein L 12 is 773 nucleotides long, and encodes a mature protein of 133 amino acids and a transit peptide of 53 amino acids. The amino terminus of the mature protein was confirmed by protein sequencing of the first 12 amino acids.

The deduced amino <b>acid</b> sequence of <b>tobacco</b> L 24 protein has a high degree of identity with chloroplast ribosomal protein L 24 of pea (73 %) and E. coli (35 %). The fusion protein from the clone coding the tobacco L 24 ribosomal protein was bound to nitrocellulose filters and used as affinity matrix to purify the antibody to the L 24 protein. Monospecific antibody to L 24 was used to identify, by Western blotting, the L 24 ribosomal protein among purified proteins of the large subunit of the chloroplast ribosome. A full-length eDNA encoding tobacco ribosomal protein L 27 is 882 nucleotides long and encodes a mature protein of 128 amino acids and a putative transit peptide of 51 amino acids.

Large quantities of tobacco residuals are produced each year as waste materials from tobacco manufacturing, potentially providing an alternative commercial source of chlorogenic acid and other valuable compounds. In this paper, microwave and ultrasound extractions of chlorogenic acid with mixed solvent were studied. Total polyphenol concentrations in extract solutions obtained with different extraction methods were analyzed with the method of ferrous tartrate and UV-Vis spectrophotometry and compared. The extraction solutions were also characterised for polyphenol compositions with the method of HPLC. Experimental results indicated that high extract concentrations of chlorogenic acid were obtained with a mixed solvent of acetone and water (1 : 2 v/v).

The accumulation of the unidentified conjugates corresponded with the rise of ethylene production in the tobacco leaf discs. Reapplication of all the extracted IAA conjugates resulted in a great stimulation of ethylene production by tobacco leaf discs which was accompanied by decarboxylation of the IAA conjugates. The results suggest that in tobacco IAA-treated leaf discs the IAA conjugates could stimulate ethylene production by a slow release of free IAA. The inability of the exogenously supplied IAA to stimulate ethylene production in the sugar beet leaf discs was not due to a deficiency of free IAA within the tissue but rather to the lack of responsiveness of this tissue to IAA, probably because of an autoinhibitory mechanism existing in the sugar beet leaf discs...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} work {{multicomponent}} systems, {{in most cases}} natural samples were investigated {{with the purpose of}} identification, or determination of the chemical structure of the constituents. IR spectra of the samples were evaluated using the PRIMA (Pattern Recognition by Independent Multicategory Analysis) pattern recognition method. In the present report the application of the method to the identification of concrete additives, to the investigation of the degree of cross linking of dextran-based gel filters, and to studies on the chemical structure and composition of humic <b>acids</b> and <b>tobacco</b> plant parts is described. In some of the above cases the IR band positions are identical for all the samples, so new data, the relative absorbances calculated for some selected bands, have been introduced to quantitatively characterize the spectra. The method described is very simple and has proved to be very efficient in solving the problems outhived. The infrared (IR) spectrum of a mixture is a physical property which depends on the composition of the mixture and on the chemical structure of the individual constituents. The traditional or computerized evaluation of IR spectra is based on the positions of transmission minima (absorption maxima) and intensities referred to unit sample mass. The latter is obtained as the absorbance calculated using the base line method or as the integral absorbance divided by the sample mass. Our task has very often been to study multicomponent systems containing complicated constituents with the purpose of identification or investigation of changes in the composition. In the majority of cases the I...|$|R
40|$|Although {{considerable}} {{attention has been}} paid to the change of amino <b>acids</b> in <b>tobacco</b> leaves during the process of " c u r i n g ", comparatively little is known of the quantitative changes of individual amino acids, and nothing is known of the behaviors of such amino acids as proline, hydroxy-proline and 7 -aminobutyric acid during the process. The present study deals with the changes in content of amino acids and related compounds in tobacco leaves during the process of "flue-curing". In this method, which is now usually in practice in Japan, the tobacco leaves harvested from the farm are placed in a drying room (" burn ") under artificial con-trol of temprature and humidity. The temperature is adjusted at first at 37 ° and gradually raised up to 72 ° in about 90 hours which is required for the completion of the process. Materials used were well matured middle leaves taken from the to-bacco plants cultivated in the farm of Hatano Tobacco Experiment Sta-tion in 1959. At various stages of curing, aliquots of leaves were taken out and quickly extracted with hot 8 0 ^ ethanol. Amino acids were determined by the method of MOORE and STEIN (1, 2). The contents of asparagine and glutamine were determined as the differences in content of aspartic and glutamic acids, respectively, before and after the hydrol-ysis of the alcohol extract. The results obtained are summarized in Table I and II. Content of free amino nitrogen was found to increase almost 10 times during the process. Considerable increases were observed in proline, hydroxyproline, phenylalanine, 7 -aminobutyric acid, a-alanine, asparagine, glutamine, ammonia and some unknown fractions. In lesser amount...|$|R
