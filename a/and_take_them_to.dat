5|$|After a fight, Storm Shadow and the Baroness {{retrieve}} the warheads <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> Baron DeCobray, the Baroness's husband, {{for him to}} weaponize. Making their way to Paris, the Joes pursue the Baroness and Storm Shadow, but are unsuccessful in stopping them from launching one of the missiles. The missile hits the Eiffel Tower and releases the nanomites in it, destroying the tower {{and some of the}} surrounding area before Duke manages to hit the kill switch. However, in so doing, he is captured and taken to McCullen's base under the Arctic.|$|E
5|$|At this point, a Selenite (an insectoid alien {{inhabitant}} of the Moon, {{named after}} one of the Greek moon goddesses, Selene) appears, but it is killed easily by an astronomer, as the creatures explode if they are hit with force. More Selenites appear and it becomes increasingly difficult for the astronomers to destroy them as they are surrounded. The Selenites capture the astronomers <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> the palace of their king. An astronomer lifts the Selenite King off his throne and throws him to the ground, causing him to explode.|$|E
5|$|At {{this time}} many Christians {{performed}} daring feats to rescue captives from Seringapatnam <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> places of safety. A captive named Domingo Pinto (brother of Salvador Pinto, who rose to high {{rank in the}} services of Tipu), was particularly proficient in this. He rescued many people and took them secretly to Mangalore or Tellicherry. He proposed that those anxious to regain their liberty could be rescued on payment to him of a certain sum of money. He fixed the rescue price per captive at 8 hoons (Rs. 32) for a male, and 4 hoons (Rs. 16) for a female.|$|E

5|$|Montgomery began entrenching {{his troops}} around the fort on September 18, and {{constructing}} a mortar battery {{south of the}} fort. He ordered Brown to establish a position at La Prairie, one of the sites {{where there was a}} crossing of the Saint Lawrence River to Montreal. Ethan Allen went with a small company of Americans to collect Canadiens that Livingston had been recruiting, <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> monitor Longueuil, the other major crossing point. Livingston had established a base at Point-Olivier, below Fort Chambly, another aging fort at the base of some rapids in the Richelieu River, and was urging his compatriots to join him there. Some Loyalists attempted to dissuade others from joining with Livingston; Livingston's supporters sometimes violently opposed attempts by Loyalists to organize, and Carleton did nothing at the time to assist the Loyalists outside the city.|$|E
25|$|Someone sent {{a message}} to Odessa landing, and the steam launch Hornet came to pick up the passengers, <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> Klamath Falls, where they arrived at about 7:00a.m. on the morning of August 8.|$|E

During the Peace of Amiens, Hazard convoyed Dutch soldiers from Britain back to the Continent.|$|E
25|$|B.B. Kahane, Columbia Pictures' Vice-President of Business Affairs, {{stopped the}} show from being broadcast. Kahane warned the Stooges that a {{contract}} stipulation restricted them from performing in a TV series that might compete with their two-reel comedies. Columbia further threatened {{to cancel the}} boys' contract <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> court if they tried to sell the series. To avert a legal hassle, the pilot was shelved and the project abandoned. The kinescope film {{is now in the}} public domain and widely available.|$|E
25|$|They set off {{the next}} day and, among other goods plundered from Kuwait, find the gold, and stumble on the {{interrogation}} of Amir Abdullah. As they are leaving, Amir's wife pleads with them not to abandon the anti-Saddam dissidents, but she is executed by the Iraqi Republican Guard. The group decides to free the Iraqi prisoners, triggering a firefight. They pull out just as Iraqi reinforcements arrive, and {{as they try to}} evade a CS gas attack, they blunder into a minefield and get separated. Iraqi soldiers capture Troy while a group of rebels rescue the other Americans <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> their underground hideout. There, Conrad, Chief and Archie agree to help the rebels and their families reach the Iranian border, after they rescue Troy.|$|E

25|$|The main {{objective}} {{of the game is}} to pick up customers <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> their chosen destination as quickly as possible. Along the way, money can be earned by performing stunts such as near misses with other vehicles. The player is directed to a destination by a large green arrow {{at the top of the}} screen. The arrow does not adjust based on obstacles, but rather points in the general direction of the destination. Once the player arrives near the destination, they must stop within a specified zone. When the destination is reached, that customer's fare is added to the player's total money earned. Ratings are then awarded depending on how long the player took to complete the journey. If the customer's timer runs out before the player reaches the destination the customer jumps from the taxi without paying the driver.|$|E
25|$|After the attack, Hawk is {{made the}} leader of G.I. Joe, a special unit {{assembled}} {{for the purpose of}} taking down this terrorist organization, identifying itself as Cobra. G.I. Joe learns the truth about Cobra from both Mercer, a Cobra defector, and Wheeljack and Bumblebee, two alien robots who avoided being found when their ship was discovered by Cobra. With the help of an encrypted signal sent by Optimus Prime, the Joes discover the location of Cobra's hidden island base. As the Joes prepare for an assault on the island, Hawk receives orders to subdue the two alien robots that had allied with them, <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> Area 51 for study, while the Cobra base is nuked. When Wheeljack warns Hawk about the catastrophic reaction of a nuclear explosion with the Energon Cobra was stockpiling, Hawk defies his orders and goes with his original invasion plan.|$|E
25|$|Marden {{remained}} in {{use as a}} civil Emergency Landing Ground. On 27 October 1919, a Handley Page O/400 of Handley Page Transport landed at Marden due to strong winds preventing it reaching Croydon. On 13 August 1923, de Havilland DH.34 G-EBBW of Instone Air Line landed at Marden due to a broken oil pipe. The aircraft was repaired and returned to Croydon. One Wednesday in September 1927, an Air Union aircraft on a flight from Paris to Croydon landed at Marden due to engine trouble. Another aircraft was sent from Croydon to collect the 11 passengers <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> their destination. Marden was still in operation in 1934, when it was mentioned in Kelly's Directory for Kent. In August 1934, a de Havilland Leopard Moth on a flight from Heston to St Inglevert, France made a landing at Marden as a child passenger was suffering from airsickness. The flight was resumed after the child had recovered. Marden closed on 24 June 1935, and the land then reverted to farmland. A RAF wireless station {{was based on the}} site during the Second World War. The last aircraft to land at Marden was on 10 October 1940, during the Battle of Britain, when a Hawker Hurricane of 253 Squadron made a forced landing and overturned, the pilot escaping with a cut thumb.|$|E

500|$|In Sosnowiec, Vladek and Anja {{move from}} one hiding place to the next, making {{occasional}} contact with other Jews in hiding. [...] Vladek disguises himself as an ethnic Pole and hunts for provisions. [...] The couple arrange with smugglers to escape to Hungary, {{but it is a}} trick—the Gestapo arrest them on the train (as Hungary is invaded) <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> Auschwitz, where they are separated until after the war.|$|E
500|$|The concept {{stemmed from}} Brubaker's effort to channel his {{feelings}} {{about the state of}} the world <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> the extreme. Recent news reports made him feel [...] "that there is no justice. Everybody gets away with everything. The world being at the edge of falling apart is where the whole story sprang from." [...] He hopes the story taps into the [...] "generational anger" [...] he has observed. He describes the story as Death Wish meets Breaking Bad with the adventure of The Amazing Spider-Man comics from the 1970s.|$|E
500|$|The {{source of}} the virus is {{revealed}} to viewers. A bulldozer (coincidently, operating for the company Emhoff worked for) knocks down a palm tree disturbing some bats, with one finding shelter and food in a banana tree. That bat then flies over a pig pen, dropping a chunk of banana from its mouth, which is then eaten by a piglet. Chinese chefs later collect pigs from the pen <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> a Hong Kong casino. A chef is called away from his preparations of a piglet, and casually wipes {{his hands on his}} apron. [...] The chef then shakes hands with Beth Emhoff, giving her the mix of bat and pig viruses that makes her patient zero and the origin of the MEV-1 virus.|$|E

500|$|The {{plan was}} similar to the failed {{operation}} of three weeks previously. Weather dependent, under cover of a smoke screen, aerial bombardment and offshore artillery, the blockships would steam directly into the channel, turn sideways and scuttle themselves. Their advance would be covered by artillery fire against German shore positions from the heavy monitors at distance and at closer range by gunfire from the destroyers. This cover was vital because Ostend was protected by a very strong [...] gun position known as the Tirpitz battery, named for the admiral. Once the operation had been concluded, the motor launches would draw along the seaward side of the blockships, remove the surviving crews <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> the monitors for passage back to Britain. This operation was to thoroughly block the channel, and — coupled with the blockage at Zeebrugge (which the British authorities believed to be fully closed) — was to prevent use of Bruges by German raiding craft for months to come.|$|E
500|$|On 6 May {{she arrived}} in Saint Thomas. She {{thereafter}} made trips to Santiago de Cuba and San Juan. While in San Juan on 13–14 May, Geier witnessed an American squadron under Rear Admiral William T. Sampson bombard the city. The US government permitted Geier to cross the blockade line outside Havana to evacuate twenty civilians of various nationalities <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> Veracruz in Mexico, arriving on the 29th. There, {{the governor of the}} city and the artillery officer from the training ship [...] visited Geier for some practice torpedo launches. While Geier was in Mexico, the German ambassador invited her commander and 27 men to visit Mexico City, where they were received by President Porfirio Díaz. Geier thereafter returned to Cuba. On 16 June, the ship called on the port of Cienfuegos in Cuba. She passed through the American blockade of Santiago de Cuba twice, on 22–29 June and 1–4 August.|$|E
500|$|While outside combat, {{players can}} breed chocobos, {{recurring}} galliform {{birds in the}} Final Fantasy series. Players must capture two chocobos on the world map <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> a special ranch within the Peristylium: by pairing certain chocobos and adding specific items, a special chocobo can be bred for use. Players can visit the Peristylium Crystarium to review defeated enemies, character information, in-game lore and special video clips. Moogles, another recurring creature in the series, hand out missions to the player: the objectives of missions can change during gameplay. Items and new equipment can be bought from shops managed by non-player characters (NPCs) both within the Peristylium and across Orience. Towns liberated during missions give access to {{a wider range of}} shops. After completing the game once, players unlock a [...] "New Game+" [...] option: in this mode, players keep their stats and weapons from the previous playthrough, while also unlocking story scenes and character-specific missions. Type-0 features three difficulty levels; [...] "normal", [...] "hard", and [...] "impossible".|$|E
