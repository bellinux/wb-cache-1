5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{surcharge}} increases, the toll in 2012 will be $2.25, or 16 cents per mile. The toll increase proposal drew 221 public comments <b>and</b> <b>opponents</b> outnumbered supporters by about 3 to 1. However, as the cost estimate grew from $5.25 billion to $6.8 billion, no final decisions have been reached to address the projected shortfall.|$|E
5|$|Fighters Uncaged is a {{fighting}} video {{game for the}} Xbox 360 Kinect system. It was developed by AMA Studios and published by Ubisoft in November 2010. Fighters Uncaged {{was one of the}} first twelve games released for the Kinect. The game has the player control Simon, a man who is attempting to win an illegal fighting tournament to help get his father out of trouble with a crime lord. It has one game mode and features many different fighting moves and different settings <b>and</b> <b>opponents.</b> Simon is able to go up in leagues by obtaining certain numbers of points, which in turn unlock more scenarios <b>and</b> <b>opponents.</b> Following its release, Zuffa filed a lawsuit against Ubisoft for the usage of a trademarked term. Fighters Uncaged received poor reviews from critics, with many criticizing the tutorial and visuals, and citing its motion control system as the biggest issue they had with the game, which many considered to be broken.|$|E

5|$|While {{lacking in}} the social qualities common to politicians, one {{characteristic}} served Goebel well in the political arenahis intellect. Goebel was well-read, and supporters <b>and</b> <b>opponents</b> both conceded that his mental prowess was impressive. Cobb concluded {{that he had never}} been more impressed with a man's intellect than he had been with Goebel's.|$|E
5|$|A {{tall and}} thin off spinner, Trumble {{delivered}} the ball at a quicker pace than most spin bowlers, using his height and uncommonly long fingers to his greatest advantage. He was at his best on the softer pitches of England, but his accuracy and variations in pace enabled him to take wickets on the harder pitches of Australia. He was a dependable lower order batsman and a fine fielder in the slips. He was recognised as a shrewd thinker about the game and was popular with team-mates <b>and</b> <b>opponents,</b> {{with a penchant for}} practical jokes.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} June 1934, top {{officials}} of the SA <b>and</b> <b>opponents</b> of the regime, including Gregor Strasser, were arrested and killed in a purge later called the Night of Long Knives. Goebbels {{was present at the}} arrest of SA leader Ernst Röhm in Munich. On 2 August 1934, President von Hindenburg died.

5|$|Flotilla is a {{three-dimensional}} simultaneous turn-based strategy space combat video game {{set in a}} randomly generated galaxy. The player and computer-controlled opponents issue orders to their ships, which are carried in a simultaneous and real-time fashion {{over a period of}} 30 seconds. The game then freezes, and the player <b>and</b> <b>opponents</b> issue new orders to their ships, which are again performed for 30 seconds. This process repeats until one party is defeated. Orders are separated into three groups: attack move, flank move and focus fire. An attack move orders the ships to move and fire simultaneously; a flank move increases the ship's speed but deactivates weapons until the ship stops moving; and focus fire increases fire rate but significantly reduces the ship's speed.|$|E
5|$|From 1923 to 1958, {{conflicts}} erupted among Armenian {{political parties}} struggling to dominate and organize the diaspora. The ARF and Hunchakian parties struggled in 1926 {{for control of}} the newly established shanty-town of Bourj Hammoud in Lebanon; ARF member Vahan Vartabedian was assassinated. The assassination of Hunchakian members Mihran Aghazarian and S. Dekhrouhi followed in 1929 and 1931 respectively. In 1956, when Bishop Zareh was consecrated Catholicos of Cilicia, the Catholicos of Echmiadzin refused to recognize his authority. This controversy polarized the Armenian community of Lebanon. As a result, {{in the context of the}} Lebanese civil strife of 1958, an armed conflict erupted between supporters (the ARF) <b>and</b> <b>opponents</b> (Hunchakians, Ramgavars) of Zareh.|$|E
5|$|Hammond {{was married}} twice, divorcing {{his first wife}} in acrimonious circumstances, and had a {{reputation}} for infidelity. His relationships with other players were difficult; team-mates <b>and</b> <b>opponents</b> alike found him hard to get along with. He was unsuccessful in business dealings and failed to establish a successful career once he retired from cricket. He moved to South Africa in the 1950s in an attempt to start a business, but this came to nothing. As a result, he and his family struggled financially. Shortly after beginning a career as a sports administrator, he was involved in a serious car crash in 1960 which left him frail. He {{died of a heart attack}} in 1965.|$|E

5|$|Home was {{generally}} warmly regarded by colleagues <b>and</b> <b>opponents</b> alike, {{and there were}} few politicians who did not respond well to him. One was Attlee, but as their political primes did not overlap this was of minor consequence. More important was Iain Macleod's prickly relationship with Home. Macleod, Secretary of State for the Colonies from 1959–61, was, like Butler, on the liberal wing of the Conservative party; he was convinced, as Home was not, that Britain's colonies in Africa should have majority rule and independence as quickly as possible. Their spheres of influence overlapped in the Central African Federation.|$|E
5|$|In Germany, Emil {{had been}} {{dismissed}} from his academic post, and, disillusioned with the Lutheran Church's {{support of the}} NSDAP, had become a Quaker in 1933. He was arrested for speaking out against the government, but was only held for one month. Elisabeth married a fellow communist, Gustav Kittowski, {{with whom she had}} a child they named Klaus. Elisabeth and Kittowski were arrested in 1933, and sentenced to 18 months imprisonment, but were freed at Christmas. Gerhard and his wife Karin were arrested in 1934, and spent the next two years in prison. Gerhard, Karin, Elisabeth and Kittowski established a car rental agency in Berlin, which they used to smuggle Jews <b>and</b> <b>opponents</b> of the government out of Germany.|$|E
5|$|In September 2007 {{a public}} {{discussion}} between supporters <b>and</b> <b>opponents</b> {{of the mosque}} plan was held at Ithaca House in Stratford. Issues discussed included {{the legitimacy of the}} concerns about the mosque, the extent of the conservative view of Islam taught by Tablighi Jamaat, their unwillingness to engage in public discourse, the extent that racism plays a role in the mosque's opposition, and the demand for larger facilities in the West Ham area to support the needs of the community.|$|E

He was the state hurdling champion from under-10s through to the under-15s, and in one year held every running and jumping record at the Bendigo Sports Centre, except the 100metres sprint. Growing up with his older brothers, Selwood was accustomed to playing with bigger teammates <b>and</b> <b>opponents.</b> By {{the time he was}} eight years old, he had played his first competitive game of football, against children four years his senior, and had kicked three goals.|$|E
5|$|Sigismund, {{supported}} by Zamoyski {{and the former}} king's wife, Anna Jagiellon, was elected King of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth on 19 August 1587 and recognized as such by the interrex, the Primate Karnkowski. The election was disputed, however, by Maximilian <b>and</b> <b>opponents</b> of Sigismund chose not to respect the election outcome, decreeing that Maximilian was the rightful monarch three days later on 22 August. The Zborowski family called for the rokosz (legitimate right to rebel) and the election ended in chaos, with several killed and many wounded. For both Zamoyski and the Zborowski family, losing was not an option, as they knew the losing side would likely pay a severe price, from confiscations {{and a loss of}} prestige to a possible death sentence for treason.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} {{establishment}} of the revolutionary committee, however, a faction opposing Pan emerged and sought to remove him from power. Pan became involved in factional violence. He jailed people from the rival faction, including party members and ordinary people. His supporters <b>and</b> <b>opponents</b> fought each other in major armed conflicts, and Pan had serious disagreements with the local military leadership. In June 1971, the central government dismissed him from his posts and put him under investigation.|$|E
