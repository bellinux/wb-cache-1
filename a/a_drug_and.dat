5|$|The process upon being branded is {{a painful}} {{experience}} for the person as the body would either accept the seal or reject it. Once one's body accepts the seal, they can assume its First Level where the seal spreads from its point of application across the user's body, increasing their chakra supply and their physical abilities in the process. When the seal is deactivated, the user is left exhausted, having expended all their energy during its use. The Second Level of the Cursed Seal is achieved by allowing the seal to engulf the users entire body, ultimately causing the person to transform into a personalized parody of Sage Mode with various strengths and weakness. The means to achieve the Second Level is by being given <b>a</b> <b>drug</b> <b>and</b> entering a state of lifelessness.|$|E

25|$|Chris Rene's journey {{began in}} June 2011 when he auditioned for the debut {{season of the}} US version of The X Factor.

Rene's contract would reportedly be worth $150,000 to $500,000 with the label, which stands to reason since he finished in third place.|$|E
25|$|A model {{proposed}} by Naqvi et al. (see above) {{is that the}} insula stores {{a representation of the}} pleasurable interoceptive effects of drug use (e.g., the airway sensory effects of nicotine, the cardiovascular effects of amphetamine), and that this representation is activated by exposure to cues that have previously been associated with drug use. A number of functional imaging studies have shown the insula to be activated during the administration of drugs of abuse. Several functional imaging studies have also shown that the insula is activated when drug users are exposed to drug cues, and that this activity is correlated with subjective urges. In the cue-exposure studies, insula activity is elicited when there is no actual change in the level of drug in the body. Therefore, rather than merely representing the interoceptive effects of drug use as it occurs, the insula {{may play a role in}} memory for the pleasurable interoceptive effects of past drug use, anticipation of these effects in the future, or both. Such a representation may give rise to conscious urges that feel as if they arise from within the body. This may make addicts feel as if their bodies need to use <b>a</b> <b>drug,</b> <b>and</b> may result in persons with lesions in the insula reporting that their bodies have forgotten the urge to use, according to this study.|$|E
