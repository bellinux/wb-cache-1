50|$|Sale of Bexxar was {{discontinued}} {{and marketing}} <b>approval</b> was <b>withdrawn</b> in February 2014 {{due to the}} decline in usage (fewer than 75 patients in 2012) {{even though it had}} a 70% response rate; the lack of demand was {{due to the fact that}} oncologists could not sell it directly to patients but had to refer patients to third parties, and the emergence of other drugs that were as good and could be administered by the oncologists.|$|R
5000|$|In October 2008, the European Medicines Agency {{recommended}} {{the suspension of}} Acomplia after the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) had determined that the risks of Acomplia outweighed its benefits due {{to the risk of}} serious psychiatric problems, including suicide. In November 2008 an advisory committee in Brazil recommended suspension as well, and that month Sanofi-Aventis suspended sale of the drug worldwide.

5000|$|The use of gastric filling {{devices to}} induce weight loss is not new. DeBakey’s review in 1938 showed that bezoars led to weight loss. Free {{floating}} intragastric balloons {{were used by}} Neiben and Harboe in 1982. Percival presented a “balloon diet” in 1984 when he placed inflated mammary implants as gastric balloons. [...] In 1985 the Garren-Edwards Bubble was introduced as the first FDA-approved device, but the <b>approval</b> was <b>withdrawn</b> seven years later because of complications. Analysis of its problems led to recommendations for safer designs. While a number of further developed devices were used outside of the US, mostly in Europe and South America, the FDA did not approve any new devices until 2015.|$|R
5000|$|During 1987, 49 diseased hearts {{had been}} {{substituted}} by surgeons {{all over the}} world with a Jarvik-7 model. In January 1988 DeVries was close to perform his fifth implantation, when a human donor heart was found for the patient. In January 1990 the <b>approval</b> was <b>withdrawn,</b> and the FDA ended the program. Before his retirement, in 1999, doctor DeVries decided, in 1988, to go back to traditional cardiovascular surgery.

30|$|This new Japanese {{legislation}} will enable companies to initiate small pilot treatment studies with {{as few as}} 10 patients without having to perform traditional Phase III clinical trials. If some degree of efficacy {{is shown in the}} pilot study, then the therapy can be approved for commercial use for 5 to 7  years, with possible coverage through the national health system. Once permission for commercialisation has been granted all patient data must be captured in a treatment registry, and <b>approval</b> can be <b>withdrawn</b> if therapies prove unsafe or ineffective.|$|R
5000|$|Natalizumab was {{originally}} approved {{for treatment of}} multiple sclerosis in 2004, through the FDA's accelerated Fast Track program, due to the drug's efficacy in one-year clinical trials. In February 2005, four months after its <b>approval,</b> natalizumab was <b>withdrawn</b> voluntarily by the manufacturer after two cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. Groups representing individuals with MS lobbied to have the drug returned to the US market and in June, 2006, after recommendation by an advisory committee and a review of two years of safety and efficacy data, the FDA re-approved natalizumab for patients with all relapsing forms of MS (relapse-remitting, secondary-progressive, and progressive-relapsing) as a first-line or second-line therapy. Patients taking natalizumab must enter into a registry for monitoring. [...] Natalizumab is the only drug after alosetron withdrawn for safety reasons that returned to the US market.|$|R
50|$|It is {{also the}} first drug to be granted {{parallel}} track status in 1992 by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which allowed for the agency to make Stavudine available to patients before being approved. Stavudine was submitted under the FDA’s accelerated approval process. Through this process, Stavudine’s effectiveness was measured by {{its effect on the}} surrogate marker, CD4, instead of clinical endpoints. The FDA concluded that an increase in CD4 cell counts was an indicator of how effective the drug would be against AIDS and HIV infection. Stavudine was the fourth drug to be approved for the treatment of AIDS and HIV infection by the FDA on June 27, 1994. Even after approval, studies were continued to evaluate the clinical benefit of the drug. If there is no indication of clinical benefits, the accelerated <b>approval</b> may be <b>withdrawn.</b>|$|R
500|$|Soon {{after its}} <b>approval</b> {{natalizumab}} was <b>withdrawn</b> {{from the market}} by its manufacturer after it was linked with three cases of the rare but hazardous neurological condition called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). PML is an opportunistic infection with neurological progressive symptoms caused by the replication of the JC virus in the glial cells of the brain. All 3 initial cases were taking natalizumab in combination with interferon beta-1a. After a safety review the drug was returned to the market in 2006 as a monotherapy for MS under a special prescription program. As of May 2011, over 130 cases of PML had been reported, all [...] in patients who had taken natalizumab {{for more than a}} year. While none of them had taken the drug in combination with other disease-modifying treatments, previous use of MS treatments increases the risk of PML between 3 and 4-fold. The estimated prevalence of PML is 1.5 cases per thousand natalizumab users. Around 20% of MS patients with PML die, while most of the remaining are importantly disabled.|$|R

AICTE decided subsequently to transfer the then students of Amity Business School to neighbouring institutions. The decision was taken up after several visits by an AICTE Expert Committees to the Amity Business School in Noida, which found [...] "serious deficiencies and violation of Norms and Standards". The institution was found conducting a [...] "large number of unapproved courses in the same premises," [...] some that required mandatory AICTE approval. A Live Mint-Wall Street Journal report in 2008 confirmed that [...] "AICTE was accurate in observing facilities and infrastructure intended for AICTE-approved courses were being utilized for other unapproved courses." [...] The institute had contravened building laws and also {{did not have the}} required [...] "built-up area" [...] as required by AICTE norms. Additionally, the lack of transparency in the institution's admission process and charging of [...] "exorbitant fees" [...] were also quoted as reasons for the withdrawal of the approval.|$|R
