5|$|The {{storytelling}} {{tends to}} be melodramatic, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> {{tend to focus on}} struggles against social oppression in which characters are silenced by economic, political, and other social forces.

5|$|Besides {{the many}} {{literary}} sources, Eliot also draws {{on his personal}} feelings and experience, especially on the great stress that he felt while composing the poem. Similarly, Eliot used the image of pilgrims coming to America <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> of them that were common throughout his childhood. In particular, his mother wrote poems about the pilgrims arriving in New England, and Eliot found information related to his family's history in a book called Sketch of the Eliot Family. The location, East Coker, was where Andrew Eliott, T. S. Eliot's ancestor, left when joining the pilgrimage.|$|E
