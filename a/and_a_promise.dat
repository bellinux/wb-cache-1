5|$|The Labour party {{conference in}} Manchester on 21–24 September {{occurred}} {{days after the}} Scottish referendum result. Miliband's conference speech was criticised, particularly after he missed sections on the deficit and immigration, after attempting to deliver the speech without notes. At the conference, Miliband pledged to focus on six national goals for Britain until 2025, including boosting pay, apprenticeships and housing; a mansion tax and levy on tobacco companies to fund £2.5 billion a year 'time to care' fund for the NHS; a commitment to {{raise the minimum wage}} to £8 or more by 2020; <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>promise</b> to lower the voting age to 16 ready for elections in 2016.|$|E
5|$|Arafat {{was finally}} {{allowed to leave}} his {{compound}} on 2 May 2002 after intense negotiations led to a settlement: six PFLP militants, including the organization's secretary-general Ahmad Sa'adat, wanted by Israel, who had been holed up with Arafat in his compound, would be transferred to international custody in Jericho. After the wanted men were handed over the siege was lifted. With that, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>promise</b> that he would issue {{a call to the}} Palestinians to halt attacks on Israelis, Arafat was released. He issued such a call on 8 May. On 19 September 2002, the IDF largely demolished the compound with armored bulldozers in order to isolate Arafat. In March 2003, Arafat ceded his post as Prime Minister to Mahmoud Abbas amid pressures by the US.|$|E

25|$|In 1795, Ireland became bolder and {{produced}} a whole new play – Vortigern and Rowena. After extensive negotiations, Irish playwright Richard Brinsley Sheridan acquired rights for the first production of the play at London's Drury Lane Theatre for £300, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>promise</b> of half of all profits to the Irelands.|$|E
25|$|Henry left Rome {{carrying}} the pope with him.

The coronation ceremony accordingly took place on 13 April, after which the emperor returned to Germany, where he sought to strengthen his power by granting privileges to {{the inhabitants of the}} region of the upper Rhine.|$|E
25|$|Public outcry {{meant the}} {{government}} had to twice revise the budget {{in an attempt to}} satisfy the pensioners and unions, and indeed the backbenchers. Lenihan was not present at the press conference, which included Brian Cowen, John Gormley and Mary Harney, to announce the removal of minimum wage employees from the 1 per cent income levy <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>promise</b> that 95 per cent of senior citizens would keep the medical card.|$|E
5000|$|Labor {{succeeded in}} winning back the {{electorate}} {{with a strong}} campaign opposing Fightback and its GST, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>promised</b> focus on creating jobs {{coming out of the}} recession.

50|$|In Philosophy <b>and</b> Law <b>a</b> <b>promise</b> {{is often}} viewed as {{something}} that leads to <b>an</b> obligation. <b>Promise</b> Theory rejects that point of view.

5000|$|The {{parliamentary}} quota {{for women}} was removed without debate <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>promised</b> female vice-president failed to materialise, amid what political commentator Moushira Khattab called [...] "a radical anti-feminist sentiment".

25|$|Drumdoe was looted {{early in}} 1923, for which French {{received}} an apology <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>promise</b> of an armed guard {{for the place}} from Governor-General T.M. Healy. Despite a gift of £50,000 in 1916, and receiving field marshal's half pay, owning two properties in Ireland which he could not use left French again short of money, {{although he did not}} improve matters by staying often at the Hôtel de Crillon in Paris. He left £8,450 (net total) in his will.|$|E
25|$|While in Rome, Tzigara was reputedly offered {{membership}} in the Freemasonry's Grand Orient de France, to whom many of Romanian colleagues belonged (see Freemasonry in Romania). The offer, Tzigara later claimed, was made by sculptor Ettore Ferrari, and included various perks <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>promise</b> that he would soon become a Masonic Grand Master. Although widely rumored to have taken up the offer, Nastasă writes, Tzigara was probably never a Freemason. Also in 1911, he was briefly President of a newly created professional association, the Romanian Writers' Society.|$|E
25|$|Due to Newfoundland's high debt load, {{arising from}} World War I and {{construction}} of the Newfoundland Railway, and decreasing revenue, due {{to the collapse of}} fish prices, the Newfoundland legislature voted itself out of existence in 1933, in exchange for loan guarantees by the Crown <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>promise</b> it would be re-established. On February 16, 1934, the Commission of Government was sworn in, ending 79 years of responsible government. The Commission consisted of seven persons appointed by the British government. For 15 years no elections took place, and no legislature was convened.|$|E

50|$|When Bolesław {{was engaged}} in {{hostilities}} with Wołodar, prince of Przemyśl, Włostowic used subterfuge to gain Wołodar's trust, staging a pretended revolt against Bolesław, and joining Wołodar's court. Some time later, when he found himself alone with Wołodar during a hunt, he captured him and led Wołodar before Bolesław, who released him only after Wołodar paid <b>a</b> large ransom <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>promised</b> to ally himself with the Duke.|$|R

25|$|The first North American airline to use {{turboprop}} {{aircraft was}} Trans-Canada Air Lines (TCA), {{with a small}} fleet of Type 700 Viscounts. Initially, TCA was cautious of the Viscount due to the turboprop engine being a new technology, {{and there had been}} a preference for acquiring the piston-engined Convair CV-240 instead; praise of the Viscount from pilots <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>promise</b> from Vickers to make any design changes desired by TCA persuaded it to procure the Viscount instead. On 6 December 1954, the first Viscount was delivered to Canada in a large media event which included an improvised aerial display.|$|E
25|$|Again {{the siege}} was prosecuted with {{increased}} fury, shot and shell being poured daily into the House, {{and many of}} the defenders falling, while famine was at the same time reducing their strength and energy. Some time previously a messenger had been despatched to the King for succour, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>promise</b> was received that assistance should arrive on the 4 September, with a view to which arrangements were made to co-operate from the House, {{but it was not until}} 11 September 1644 that welcome intelligence was received by the garrison that the reliefs were marching towards them, and had already reached Aldermaston.|$|E
25|$|In the {{following}} {{months after the}} creation of provisional government in Thessaloniki in late August, negotiations between the Allies and king intensified. The Allies wanted further demobilisation of the Greek army as a counterbalance of the unconditional surrender of Fort Rupel by the royalist government and military evacuation of Thessaly to insure {{the safety of their}} troops in Macedonia. On the other hand, the king wanted assurances that the Allies would not officially recognise Venizelos' provisional government or further support it, guarantees that Greece's integrity and neutrality would be respected, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>promise</b> that any war material surrendered to the Allies would be returned after the war.|$|E

Two minor technical patches were later released by a skeleton crew of staff kept on the project, but Interplay had effectively ended their support.|$|R
25|$|Instructed by Rhodes {{to hurry}} east, Selous {{met with the}} Manica chief, Mtassa, on 14 September 1890, and agreed with him a {{concession}} whereby Mtassa promised not to ally with any other foreign power, and granted the Company exclusive rights to mine within his territory, {{as well as to}} build railways, bridges, canals and other projects typical of colonial settlement. In return, the Company gave Mtassa rifles and other equipment (worth £100 in total), <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>promise</b> of protection against attacks by the Portuguese or the neighbouring Shangaan (or Tsonga) people. Portugal despatched a small force to militarily overwhelm Mtassa and reclaim the area in early November 1890.|$|E
25|$|The butler’s mosaic {{dating from}} the middle of the 3rd century CE {{features}} a drinking scene. Two characters are serving two others, who are much smaller, from amphoras on their shoulders. The two amphoras bear the letters PIE (“Drink!” in Ancient Greek) and ZHCHC (“You will live” in Ancient Greek). The amphora bearers are flanked by another two characters, one of whom is carrying another amphora, the other of whom is carrying a branch of laurel and a basket of roses. This depiction is a greeting to all guests <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>promise</b> of hospitality. The same is true of another mosaic held at the museum which bears the phrase Omnia tibi felicia (May everything please you).|$|E
25|$|However, others {{attribute}} {{the decline of}} deaf clubs {{to the end of}} World WarII and a change in the job market. During WWII there was high demand for factory laborers <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>promise</b> of high pay. Many deaf Americans left their homes to move to bigger cities with the hope of obtaining a factory job. This huge influx of workers into new cities created the need for deaf clubs. When World WarII ended and the civil rights movement progressed, the federal government started offering more jobs to deaf men and women. People began switching from manufacturing jobs to service jobs, moving away from solitary work with set hours. Today, deaf clubs are rare, but deaf advocacy centers and other deaf organizations have become widespread and popular.|$|E

25|$|During the {{communist}} era, travelling to the West {{was a long}} process for Hungarian citizens. The {{first step was to}} obtain an invitation, preferably from a relative in the country to be visited, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>promise</b> of full financial support. With such an invitation, and assuming he could get a passport, a Hungarian could travel westwards once a year. However, in the absence of such an invitation, he could travel to the West only once every three years. The Communist-era visa restrictions restricted Hungarian artists and musicians since it hindered their ability to travel abroad. As a result, many chose to leave Hungary and settle in the West, such as famed cellist János Starker, who emigrated to the United States in 1948 because it was impossible for him to tour abroad with a Hungarian passport.|$|E
25|$|On 9 September 1941, the {{parliament}} of the Slovak Republic – a Nazi puppet state – ratified the Jewish Codex, {{a series of}} laws and regulations that stripped Slovakia's 80,000 Jews of their civil rights and all means of economic survival. The fascist Slovak leadership was so impatient {{to get rid of}} Jews that it paid the Nazis DM 500 in exchange for each expelled Jew <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>promise</b> that the deportees would never return to Slovakia. The decision by Slovakia to initiate and pay for the expulsion was unprecedented among the satellite states of Nazi Germany. They paid 40 millions RM to the SS for it. Some 83 percent of the Jewish population perished in two waves of deportations to Auschwitz, Belzec, and Majdanek; the second wave after the Uprising of 28–29 August 1944.|$|E

Later that month on 12 January it was announced that the All India Football Federation had called for an executive meeting on the 15th to discuss the proposal of handing select companies direct spots into the 2013–14 I-League. This news came following the uncertainty over the participation of institutional clubs, Air India FC and ONGC and the temporarily banned side Mohun Bagan for the 2013–14 season.|$|E
