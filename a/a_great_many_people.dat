Many observers agree that bullying is often a repetitive behaviour. However, some experts who have dealt with <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> who report abuse also categorize some once-only events as bullying, for example with cases where there appear to be severe sequelae. Expanding the common understanding of bullying to include single, severe episodes also parallels the legal definitions of sexual harassment in the US.|$|E
25|$|The Japanese {{had been}} active on the seas {{and across the}} region for centuries, {{traveling}} for commercial, political, religious and other reasons. The 16th century, however, saw {{a dramatic increase in}} such travel and activity. The internal strife of the Sengoku period caused <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>many</b> <b>people,</b> primarily samurai, commoner merchants, and Christian refugees to seek their fortunes across the seas. Many of the samurai who fled Japan around this time were those who stood on the losing sides of various major conflicts; some were ronin, some veterans of the Japanese invasions of Korea or of various other major conflicts. As Toyotomi Hideyoshi and later the Tokugawa shoguns issued repeated bans on Christianity, many fled the country; a significant portion of those settled in Catholic Manila.|$|E

Financial controls were lax. Hubbard himself withdrew large sums with no explanation of what he was doing with it. On one occasion, van Vogt saw Hubbard taking a lump sum of $56,000 (equivalent to $0.5 million at 2010 prices) out of the Los Angeles Foundation's proceeds. One of Hubbard's employees, Helen O'Brien, commented that at the Elizabeth, N.J. branch of the Foundation, the books showed that [...] "a month's income of $90,000 is listed, with only $20,000 accounted for".|$|E

[...] The bishops wanted the discussion to make clear that living in accordance with the Church's teachings is an achievable goal for ordinary people.

2500|$|... "Deconstruction and {{breakthrough}} in Nietzsche and Nāgārjuna" [...] is an essay by Glen T. Martin. Martin compares {{the philosophy of}} Nietzsche to the philosophy of Nāgārjuna, aiming to illuminate the relationship between their respective attempts to develop [...] "spiritual break-throughs", by considering each thinker in turn. First he looks at Nietzsche's distinct rejection of traditional values, and, subsequently, considers Nietzsche's answer to the problem. Second, Martin looks to Nāgārjuna, tracing his line of thought to the [...] "emptiness" [...] and [...] "ultimate truth", and then to his conception of [...] "liberation". Martin then compares Nietzsche and Nāgārjuna's thought directly, with reference to Nishitani, and concludes that Nietzsche's articulation of nihilism means that the [...] "emptiness" [...] spoken of by Nāgārjuna {{is something that can}} now be seen by <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>many</b> <b>people.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Schwarz {{profiled}} how Waters, {{the former}} Philadelphia Eagles safety who {{had committed suicide}} two months before, {{had been diagnosed with}} chronic traumatic encephalopathy (C.T.E.) – the brain disease more commonly known as pugilistica dementia, or [...] "punch-drunk syndrome". With each new player diagnosed with C.T.E., and as more players and families went public with retirees’ early-onset dementia, the N.F.L. and its committee of doctors insisted in Schwarz’s stories and elsewhere that there was no evidence to connect football with later cognitive disease. One example came in January 2009, when Tom McHale, a former N.F.L. lineman who had recently died at 45, became the sixth player to be diagnosed with C.T.E. High-ranking league executive Jeff Pash said in Schwarz’s story in the Times: [...] "There are <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> who have played football and other contact sports for many years and at high levels who do not appear to have suffered these types of deficits.
