40|$|An indigenously {{developed}} threonine {{chemical dosimeter}} {{was used for}} dosimetry of ISOMED <b>auxiliary</b> <b>conveyor.</b> This conveyor {{would be used for}} irradiation of dried fruits viz. : raisins and dates. The results obtained were confirmed using a reference standard dosimeter such as alanine ESR pellet dosimeters. The maximum variation between the results of threonine and the standard dosimeter was within Â± 10 %...|$|E
5000|$|A recent large model, {{weighing}} approximately 500 kg and 23 m long, {{was built}} in September 2009 by TV presenter James May {{and a team of}} volunteers from the engineering department of the University of Liverpool, who created a Meccano bridge spanning the Leeds and Liverpool Canal in Liverpool. As with other models of this size and weight some non-Meccano parts were used. It was built from [...] "about 100,000 pieces of real Meccano", taking 1,100 hours, and consisted of a 9-metre (29.5 ft) [...] "swing bridge" [...] section, and a 12-metre (39.4 ft) [...] "drawbridge" [...] section. A contender for the largest model on record {{was built in}} 2014 by Graham Shepherd of Grahamstown, South Africa. The fully motorized Krupp 288 Bucket Wheel Excavator (as used on large opencast mining) is complete with <b>auxiliary</b> <b>conveyors.</b> Construction utilised Meccano parts as well as replica and strengthened parts (thickened profile plates and high tensile bolts in areas carrying large loads). Shepherd reports the model as being 1,335 kilograms (2,943 pounds) in mass and 17 ft tall. It required substantial timber support frames to facilitate final assembly.|$|R
