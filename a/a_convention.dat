5|$|In October 1849 the {{southern}} interests held <b>a</b> <b>convention</b> to discuss railroads in Memphis, {{in response to}} <b>a</b> <b>convention</b> in St. Louis earlier that fall which discussed a northern route. The Memphis convention overwhelmingly advocated {{the construction of a}} route beginning there, to connect with an El Paso, Texas to San Diego, California line. Disagreement arose only over the issue of financing. The convention president, Matthew Fontaine Maury of Virginia, preferred strict private financing, whereas John Bell and others thought that federal land grants to railroad developers would be necessary.|$|E

In May 1798, 9,188 of the 16,388 votes {{were in favor of}} calling <b>a</b> <b>convention.</b> Again, almost 5,000 of the ballots contained no vote either way. On November 21, 1798, the House of Representatives voted 3615 in favor of <b>a</b> <b>convention,</b> and the Senate provided its requisite two-thirds majority days later. No official tally of the Senate's vote was published. The Assembly's vote rendered moot any doubts about the popular vote.|$|E

5|$|As {{his term}} neared expiration, Laffoon removed Ben Johnson {{from his post}} as highway commissioner, {{replacing}} him with Tom Rhea. This move was made in order to groom Rhea {{to be the next}} governor. Due to the influence of Laffoon and Rhea, the Democratic Party again chose a nominating convention in lieu of a primary to choose their gubernatorial candidate. Because Laffoon supporters controlled the state Democratic Central Committee and most of the county political organizations, <b>a</b> <b>convention</b> would favor Laffoon's choice of gubernatorial nominee. The convention was scheduled for May 14, 1935 in Lexington.|$|E

Twenty-seven states had called for a constitutional convention on the subject, with 31 states needed to reach the threshold; Arizona and New Mexico each achieved statehood that year (bringing the total number of states to 48), and were expected to support the motion. Alabama and Wyoming, already states, had passed resolutions in favor of <b>a</b> <b>convention</b> without formally calling for one.|$|E

5|$|During his term, Marshall focused {{primarily}} on advancing the progressive agenda. He successfully advocated {{the passage of a}} child labor law and anti-corruption legislation. He supported popular election of U.S. Senators, and the constitutional amendment to allow it was ratified by the Indiana General Assembly during his term. He also overhauled the state auditing agencies and claimed to have saved the government millions of dollars. He was unsuccessful in passing the rest of the progressive platform agenda items or persuading the legislature to call <b>a</b> <b>convention</b> to rewrite the state constitution to expand the government's regulatory powers.|$|E
5|$|During these {{periods of}} {{redevelopment}} to Hampden, Ibrox also hosted the 1997 Scottish Cup Final, and the 1994 and 1997 Scottish League Cup Finals. Ibrox {{was on the}} approved UEFA list to host major European finals in the 1990s, but it lost out {{in a bid to}} host the 1996 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final because <b>a</b> <b>convention</b> threatened a shortage of hotel rooms in Glasgow. Ibrox continued to hold the top UEFA rating, but the Scottish Football Association put forward the redeveloped Hampden for European finals in the 2000s.|$|E
5|$|In 1789 Marshall {{was elected}} again to <b>a</b> <b>convention</b> to {{consider}} separation from Virginia. After Kentucky's separation from Virginia in 1792, {{he was elected}} to represent Woodford County in the Kentucky House of Representatives. The most notable piece of legislation he authored was an act that simplified the classification and taxation of land. He was reelected to his position in 1794. He opposed allocating men or supplies for George Rogers Clark's proposed attack upon the Spanish at New Orleans. The attack was promoted by Edmond-Charles Genêt, and Marshall accused sitting governor Isaac Shelby of complicity in the matter.|$|E

Although Mallory had held no statewide offices, he was regarded as sufficiently powerful in the state Democratic Party to be chosen as an alternate delegate to the convention. Personal considerations kept him from attending, but he expressed his agreement with the purposes of the convention in a letter that was widely reprinted in the Florida newspapers.|$|E
5|$|In January 1861, Missouri called <b>a</b> <b>convention</b> to {{determine}} whether it would follow the lead of other pro-slavery states and secede from the Union. Knott was sympathetic to the southern cause, but opposed the methods of the secessionists. The Unionist position carried the convention by an 80,000-vote majority. Knott resigned his position as attorney general rather than take an oath of allegiance required by the federal government. As a result of his refusal, he was disbarred from practice in the state of Missouri and imprisoned for a short time.|$|E
5|$|In Tucson between April 2 and April 5, 1860, <b>a</b> <b>convention</b> of {{settlers}} {{from the}} southern half of the New Mexico Territory drafted a constitution for a provisional Arizona Territory, three years before the United States would create such a territory. This proposed territory consisted of the part of New Mexico Territory south of 33° 40' N. On April 2, they elected a governor, Lewis Owings. The provisional territory was to exist {{until such time as}} an official territory was created, but that proposal was rejected by the U.S. Congress at the time.|$|E

Wickliffe's political opponents, including Thomas F. Marshall, claimed this showed Wickliffe's political inconsistency, a charge that Wickliffe denied. The following year, Wickliffe was appointed to a committee charged with revising the state's code of laws. On January 8, 1861, he chaired the state Democratic convention in Louisville.|$|E
