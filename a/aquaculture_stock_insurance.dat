50|$|A mutual {{insurance}} company is an insurance company owned entirely by its policyholders. Any profits earned by a {{mutual insurance}} company are either retained within the company or rebated to policyholders {{in the form of}} dividend distributions or reduced future premiums. In contrast, a <b>stock</b> <b>insurance</b> company is owned by investors who have purchased company stock; any profits generated by a <b>stock</b> <b>insurance</b> company are distributed to the investors without necessarily benefiting the policyholders.|$|R
40|$|Genetic {{introgression}} of <b>aquaculture</b> <b>stocks</b> {{in local}} forms {{is well documented}} in many fish species but their evolutionary consequences for the local populations have not been thoroughly explored. Due to its wide geographical range, the existence of many locally adapted forms and the frequent occurrence of introgression of <b>aquaculture</b> <b>stocks</b> in local forms, brown trout represents the ideal system to {{study the effects of}} such introgressions. Here, we focus on a group of rivers and streams in Sicily (Italy), and, by using molecular tools, we show that autochthonous populations are probably derived from the Southern Atlantic clade, which is present in the Iberian peninsula and North Africa. Three out of the four studied rivers reveal signs of genetic introgression of domestic stocks. Finally, by using advanced geometric morphometric analyses, we show that genetic introgression produces a higher degree of morphological variability relative to that observed in non-introgressed populations...|$|R
25|$|During winter, when reduced feeds are {{administered}} to <b>aquaculture</b> <b>stock,</b> ammonia levels can be higher. Lower ambient temperatures reduce {{the rate of}} algal photosynthesis so less ammonia is removed by any algae present. Within an aquaculture environment, especially at large scale, there is no fast-acting remedy to elevated ammonia levels. Prevention rather than correction is recommended to reduce harm to farmed fish and in open water systems, the surrounding environment.|$|R

In <b>aquaculture,</b> <b>stocking</b> density is the concentration which fish are stocked into a system (Gomes et al. 2006; de Oliveira et al. 2012). Generally, increases in stocking density results in directly increase on the stress condition, causing a reduction in growth rate and food utilization (Sharma and Chakrabarti 1998). On the other hand, in very low densities, fishes may not form shoals and may feel unprotected.|$|R

40|$|Alternative {{theories}} imply differential compensation levels between {{executives of}} mutual and <b>stock</b> <b>insurance</b> companies.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{investigates the}} impact of natural catastrophes and the 9 - 11 attacks on (1) the {{volatility}} of <b>insurance</b> <b>stocks</b> and (2) the correlation of <b>insurance</b> <b>stocks</b> with the market. We find that natural catastrophes increase the volatility of <b>insurance</b> <b>stocks.</b> They also {{have a tendency to}} reduce the correlation of <b>insurance</b> <b>stocks</b> and the market. Investors can, consequently, diversify natural catastrophe risk by additionally holdings of a market portfolio. This does not hold for 9 - 11. These events led to increases in volatility and, simultaneously, to an increase in correlation.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{valuation}} impact on 148 <b>insurance</b> <b>stocks</b> caused by 25 {{of the largest}} catastrophic events that occurred in recent history.

However, {{we have to realize}} that <b>insurance</b> <b>stock</b> investors behave not less rational than the market does under these conditions.

40|$|ABSTRACT Infectious {{disease is}} a major {{constraint}} for all species produced via aquaculture. The majority of farmed fish and shellfish production is based on stocks with limited or no selective breeding. Since disease resistance is almost universally heritable, there is huge potential to select for improved resistance to key diseases. This short review discusses the current methods of breeding more resistant <b>aquaculture</b> <b>stocks,</b> with success stories and current bottlenecks highlighted. The current implementation of genomic selection in {{breeding for disease resistance}} and routes to wider-scale implementation and improvement in aquaculture are discussed. Future directions are highlighted, including the potential of genome editing tools for mapping causative variation underlying disease resistance traits and for breeding aquaculture animals with enhanced resistance to disease...|$|R

Formal regulation of the insurance industry began in earnest when the first state commissioner of insurance was appointed in New Hampshire in 1851.

40|$|One unusual {{feature of}} the U. S. property-casualty {{insurance}} industry is the coexistence of stock and mutual companies. This paper explores the performance of these forms in the industry through a dynamic assessment of how mutual and <b>stock</b> <b>insurance</b> companies respond to differences in their underwriting environment. Agency theories suggest that the stock company may be more 'opportunistic' and less obligated to their insureds than mutuals. This article assesses the responses by stock and mutual firms {{to changes in the}} underwriting environment from 1984 to 1991, using measures of individual firms' performance, by state and by line, in eight different lines of <b>insurance.</b> <b>Stock</b> companies are more likely than mutuals to reduce their business in unprofitable situations, and have higher losses than mutuals for a given amount of premiums. ...|$|R

The empirical shares are computed from recent aggregate Canadian data. The theoretical shares are constructed from a flexible specification of both investors' preferences and investment opportunities. Our results reveal that the theoretical shares statistically match observed consumption and aggregated assets, but not disaggregated assets.

40|$|The {{previous}} literature {{documents that}} insurance {{initial public offerings}} (IPOs) are less underpriced than those of noninsurance firms. This difference is usually attributed to lower information asymmetry for regulated firms. However, we find that once one controls for the file price adjustment <b>insurance</b> IPOs, both <b>stock</b> and mutual, are no less underpriced than other noninsurance offerings suggesting the book-building process resolves any such information asymmetries. We also find that mutual IPOs appear more underpriced than <b>stock</b> <b>insurance</b> IPOs, but this difference {{is related to the}} differences in pre-issue managerial ownership.

40|$|Aquaculture is {{predicted}} {{to play a major}} and ever increasing role in meeting human needs for protein. In terrestrial animal and plant species genetic improvement programs have made a substantial contribution to productivity and viability.

Hence, there is ample justification for the planning, design and implementation of genetic improvement programs for aquatic animal species. A range of methods of varying complexity is available for selection purposes, but their suitability for different circumstances is not always clear. Bentsen and Gjerde (1994) give a very lucid account of the situation and their diagnostic and recommendations remain valid to date.

40|$|The first {{contribution}} {{of this article}} is to provide a framework, a model together with a corresponding equilibrium notion, suitable for the study of the interaction between insurance and dynamic financial markets. Our central result is that in equilibrium risk-averse agents purchase full insurance coverage, despite unfair insurance prices. We identify three conditions that explain this result: (1) insurance contracts are priced competitively, (2) financial prices include a risk premium only for undiversifiable risk, and (3) financial markets are effectively complete. An implication is that in this model disasters can be insured by fully assessable <b>stock</b> <b>insurance</b> companies. Copyright (c) The Journal of Risk and Insurance, 2008. ...|$|R
