5|$|The third contest had Shane McMahon against Eric Bischoff in a {{standard}} match. McMahon and Bischoff began by brawling on the arena ramp, as Jonathan Coachman appeared from the backstage area and hit McMahon with a steel chair. Bischoff grabbed a microphone and announced that the match would be contested under no disqualification, falls count anywhere regulations; as a result, Bischoff could not be disqualified for Coachman's interference. Coachman and Bischoff performed double-team attacks on McMahon until Steve Austin interfered by performing a Stone Cold Stunners on Coachman and Bischoff. After Austin's interference, McMahon positioned Bischoff on the television commentators' table, performed <b>a</b> <b>Leap</b> of Faith onto Bischoff's chest, thereby breaking the table and covered Bischoff for the pinfall.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of construction, the {{railways}} provided <b>a</b> <b>leap</b> in transport for the communities it passed through. NSB saw beautiful and grandeur stations {{as a way to}} draw patronage, and chose, in addition to impressive architecture, to build a park adjacent each stations. As construction went by, funding for stations were reduced, resulting in less grandeur further north. Most stations had two stories and an attic, although some of the stations serving lesser places had smaller buildings. From Steinkjer to Skogn, the ground floors were built in random rubble. As construction continued, budgets were reduced and station costs were cut. From Rinnan to Sparbu, the ground floors were instead built in brick, and from Mære and north, the stations have wooden ground floors. In addition to a station buildings, stations consisted of an outhouse and a freight house; selected stations also featured a water tower and motive power depot.|$|E

5|$|The {{structure}} of the feet and legs varies greatly among frog species, depending in part on whether they live primarily on the ground, in water, in trees or in burrows. Frogs {{must be able to}} move quickly through their environment to catch prey and escape predators, and numerous adaptations help them to do so. Most frogs are either proficient at jumping or are descended from ancestors that were, with much of the musculoskeletal morphology modified for this purpose. The tibia, fibula, and tarsals have been fused into a single, strong bone, as have the radius and ulna in the fore limbs (which must absorb the impact on landing). The metatarsals have become elongated to add to the leg length and allow frogs to push against the ground for a longer period on take-off. The illium has elongated and formed a mobile joint with the sacrum which, in specialist jumpers such as ranids and hylids, functions as an additional limb joint to further power the leaps. The tail vertebrae have fused into a urostyle which is retracted inside the pelvis. This enables the force to be transferred from the legs to the body during <b>a</b> <b>leap.</b>|$|E
25|$|Mostly, {{a year is}} <b>a</b> <b>leap</b> year if it is evenly {{divisible}} by four. A year divisible by 100, however, is not <b>a</b> <b>leap</b> year in the Gregorian calendar {{unless it}} is also divisible by 400. For example, 1600 was <b>a</b> <b>leap</b> year, but 1700, 1800 and 1900 were not. Some programs may have relied on the oversimplified rule that a year divisible by four is <b>a</b> <b>leap</b> year. This method works fine for the year 2000 (because it is <b>a</b> <b>leap</b> year), and will not become a problem until 2100, when older legacy programs will likely have long since been replaced. Other programs contained incorrect leap year logic, assuming for instance that no year divisible by 100 could be <b>a</b> <b>leap</b> year. An assessment of this leap year problem including a number of real life code fragments appeared in 1998. For information on why century years are treated differently, see Gregorian calendar.|$|E
25|$|The NTP packet {{includes}} <b>a</b> <b>leap</b> second flag, which {{informs the}} user that <b>a</b> <b>leap</b> second is imminent. This, among other things, allows {{the user to}} distinguish between a bad measurement that should be ignored and a genuine leap second that should be followed. It {{has been reported that}} never, since the monitoring began in 2008 and whether or not <b>a</b> <b>leap</b> second should be inserted, have all NTP servers correctly set their flags on a December 31 or June 30. This is one reason many NTP servers broadcast the wrong time for up to a day after <b>a</b> <b>leap</b> second insertion, and {{it has been suggested that}} hackers have exploited this vulnerability.|$|E

25|$|Secondly, some programmers had {{misunderstood}} the Gregorian calendar {{rule that}} determines whether years that are exactly divisible by 100 are not leap years, and assumed the year 2000 {{would not be}} <b>a</b> <b>leap</b> year. Years divisible by 100 are not leap years, except for years that are divisible by 400. Thus the year 2000 was <b>a</b> <b>leap</b> year.|$|E
25|$|Moreover, Chulasakarat uses three {{similar but}} not {{identical}} types of lunar years {{used by the}} Burmese calendar.

However, whereas the Burmese calendar adds the intercalary day only in <b>a</b> <b>leap</b> cycle according to its Metonic cycle, the Siamese calendar adds the intercalary day to a regular year.

25|$|The Microsoft Excel {{spreadsheet}} program {{had a very}} elementary Y2K problem: Excel (in both Windows and Mac versions, when they are set to start at 1900) incorrectly set the year 1900 as <b>a</b> <b>leap</b> year for compatibility with Lotus 1-2-3. In addition, the years 2100, 2200, and so on, were regarded as leap years. This bug was fixed in later versions, but since the epoch of the Excel timestamp was set to the meaningless date of 0 January 1900 in previous versions, the year 1900 is still regarded as <b>a</b> <b>leap</b> year to maintain backward compatibility.|$|E
25|$|On {{the day of}} <b>a</b> <b>leap</b> second event, ntpd {{receives}} notification {{from either}} a configuration file, an attached reference clock, or a remote server. Because of the requirement that time must appear to be monotonically increasing, <b>a</b> <b>leap</b> second is inserted with the sequence 23:59:59, 23:59:60, 00:00:00. Although the clock is actually halted during the event, any processes that query the system time cause it to increase by a tiny amount, preserving the order of events. If a negative leap second should ever become necessary, it would be deleted with the sequence 23:59:58, 00:00:00, skipping 23:59:59.|$|E
