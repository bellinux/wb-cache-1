5|$|Agaricus hondensis {{mushrooms}} are toxic, and consuming the fruit bodies causes gastroenteritis. Some fruit bodies smell of creosote, <b>an</b> <b>odor</b> that {{becomes even more}} prevalent if the {{mushrooms are}} cooked. Cooking also introduces an unpleasant soapy-metallic flavor. The fruit bodies are used as food by the vagrant shrew (Sorex vagrans) and the American shrew mole (Neurotrichus gibbsii). Relatively high levels of the chemical hydroquinone are present in fruit bodies.|$|E
5|$|About 20 {{minutes before}} the plane landed, on its final descent, he {{secretly}} ignited a small explosive device consisting of a mix of plastic explosive powder and acid. Abdulmutallab apparently had a packet of the plastic explosive sewn to his underwear, and injected liquid acid from a syringe into the packet to cause a chemical reaction. While {{there was a small}} explosion and fire, the device failed to detonate properly. Passengers heard popping noises resembling firecrackers, smelled <b>an</b> <b>odor,</b> and saw the suspect's pants, leg and the wall of the plane on fire.|$|E
5|$|During {{an autopsy}} on Susan Snow, Assistant Medical Examiner Janet Miller {{detected}} {{the scent of}} bitter almonds, <b>an</b> <b>odor</b> distinctive to cyanide. Tests verified that Snow had died of acute cyanide poisoning. Investigators examined {{the contents of the}} Snow-Webking household and discovered the source of the cyanide: the bottle of Extra-Strength Excedrin capsules that both Snow and Webking had used the morning of Snow's death. Three capsules out of those that remained in the 60-capsule bottle were found to be laced with cyanide in toxic quantities.|$|E

40|$|Visual {{experience}} is information rich, {{but only a}} small proportion is available for later access. We tested for this distinction in olfaction. In two experiments (E 1 & 2), participants undertook trials rating <b>an</b> <b>odor's</b> features (e. g., how banana-like?), the during-smelling-profile, followed by an after-smelling-profile, upon the odor's removal. On some trials during and after-smelling-profiles were identical and on others they were different. Each trial with <b>a</b> particular <b>odor</b> was repeated. For half the odors both trials were identical (congruent) and for the remainder, one was different and the other identical (incongruent). Crucially, the after-smelling-profile {{was always the same}} for each odor, allowing reliability to be measured. E 1 & 2 revealed that incongruent profiles were the least reliable. Attempting to access particular <b>odor</b> features in <b>an</b> <b>odor's</b> absence is harder if those features were not attended during smelling. This suggests more information is available during smelling, than can be accessed after the odors removal. 10 page(s...|$|R
5|$|Kalapuya brunnea is {{a species}} of truffle in the {{monotypic}} fungal genus Kalapuya. The truffle occurs only in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States, in western Oregon and northern California. Known locally as the Oregon brown truffle, it was formerly thought to be an undescribed species of Leucangium until molecular analysis demonstrated that it was distinct from that genus. The truffle is reddish brown with a rough and warty outer skin, while the interior spore-producing gleba is initially whitish before developing greyish-brown mottling as it matures. Mature truffles have <b>an</b> <b>odor</b> resembling garlicky cheese, similar to mature Camembert. The species has been harvested for culinary purposes in Oregon.|$|E
5|$|The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame paid $6,000 to {{taxidermist}} Sergio Vigilato {{to preserve}} the dress. It had been frozen following the two television appearances, although Vigilato discovered signs of decomposition on the dress which had occurred prior to it being frozen, and noted it was emitting <b>an</b> <b>odor</b> once it was defrosted. It was treated with bleach, formaldehyde and detergent to kill any bacteria which had formed, and was reconditioned by being dyed dark red once it was preserved so {{to give it the}} same appearance as when first worn. However, after the preservation there were several pieces of beef left over and not included in the reworked dress.|$|E
5|$|Cockroaches {{are social}} insects; {{a large number}} of species are either gregarious or {{inclined}} to aggregate, and a slightly smaller number exhibit parental care. It used to be thought that cockroaches aggregated because they were reacting to environmental cues, but it is now believed that pheromones are involved in these behaviors. Some species secrete these in their feces with gut microbial symbionts being involved, while others use glands located on their mandibles. Pheromones produced by the cuticle may enable cockroaches to distinguish between different populations of cockroach by odor. The behaviors involved have only been studied in a few species, but German cockroaches leave fecal trails with <b>an</b> <b>odor</b> gradient. Other cockroaches follow such trails to discover sources of food and water, and where other cockroaches are hiding. Thus, cockroaches have emergent behavior, in which group or swarm behavior emerges from a simple set of individual interactions.|$|E
50|$|An aroma compound, {{also known}} as an odorant, aroma, fragrance, or flavor, is a {{chemical}} compound that has <b>a</b> smell or <b>odor.</b> <b>A</b> chemical compound has <b>a</b> smell or <b>odor</b> when it is sufficiently volatile to be transported to the olfactory system in {{the upper part of}} the nose.|$|R

50|$|Odor: Candy caps have <b>a</b> {{distinctive}} <b>odor</b> (described above) {{that should}} not be present in other species of Lactarius. Note, however, that other species of Lactarius may have different, but also distinctive, odors. Also note that when fresh, candy caps (especially Lactarius rubidus) may not have <b>a</b> noticeable <b>odor,</b> limiting the utility of this characteristic.|$|R
5|$|Distinctive field {{characteristics}} used {{to distinguish}} Boletus rubroflammeus from similar boletes include the deep purple-red cap and the reticulated stem. B.flammans {{is similar in}} appearance, but has a more variable cap color, ranging from dark red to brick-red or reddish-brown, a yellow stem base and less prominently reticulate stem, and it grows under conifers. Rubroboletus rhodosanguineus is also very similar but has more variable cap color with brown to olive tones and its cut flesh has <b>an</b> <b>odor</b> of overripe fruit that intensifies when dry. The European species R.rhodoxanthus has a paler overall color. Another European species, B.permagnificus, has larger spores (13–16 by 5–6.5μm), weakly decurrent pores, and only associates with oak trees.|$|E
5|$|Carus's death, amid a {{successful}} war with Persia and in mysterious circumstances – he was believed (perhaps {{as a result}} of later Diocletianic propaganda) to have been struck by lightning – left his sons Numerian and Carinus as the new Augusti. Carinus quickly made his way to Rome from his post in Gaul as imperial commissioner and arrived there by January 284, becoming legitimate Emperor in the West. Numerian lingered in the East. The Roman withdrawal from Persia was orderly and unopposed. The Sassanid king Bahram II could not field an army against them as he was still struggling to establish his authority. By March 284, Numerian had only reached Emesa (Homs) in Syria; by November, only Asia Minor. In Emesa he was apparently still alive and in good health: he issued the only extant rescript in his name there, but after he left the city, his staff, including the prefect (Numerian's father-in-law, and as such the dominant influence in the Emperor's entourage) Aper, reported that he suffered from an inflammation of the eyes. He traveled in a closed coach from then on. When the army reached Bithynia, some of the soldiers smelled <b>an</b> <b>odor</b> emanating from the coach. They opened its curtains and inside they found Numerian dead. Both Eutropius and Aurelius Victor describe Numerian's death as an assassination.|$|E
25|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 28 April 2/3 Marines moved up Hill 861 with minimal opposition as the PAVN had withdrawn from the Hill. The Marines found 25 bunkers and numerous fighting positions and reported <b>an</b> <b>odor</b> of dead bodies across the hilltop.|$|E

25|$|Although all {{individuals}} with ORS {{believe they have}} <b>an</b> <b>odor,</b> {{in some cases the}} individual reports they cannot perceive the odor themselves. In the latter cases, the belief arises via misinterpretation of the behavior of others or with the rationale that a disorder of smell which prevents self detection of the odor (i.e. anosmia) exists. In the cases where the non-existent odor can be detected, this is usually considered as phantosmia (olfactory hallucination). Olfactory hallucination can be considered the result of the belief in <b>an</b> <b>odor</b> delusion, or the belief a result of the olfactory hallucination. In one review, the individual with ORS was unreservedly convinced that he or she could detect the odor themselves in 22% of cases, whilst in 19% there was occasional or intermittent detection and in 59% lack of self-detection was present.|$|E
25|$|It is {{not entirely}} clear whether the preorbital gland {{secretions}} of North American deer emit <b>an</b> <b>odor</b> that is significant in terms of chemical communication. Most of the time, the glands remain in the closed position, but {{they are capable of}} opening them in certain circumstances. For example, a rutting male may dilate its preorbital glands in order to signal aggression to another nearby male. Female deer often open their glands while caring for their young.|$|E
25|$|As {{with nearly}} all {{anesthetic}} drugs, thiopental causes cardiovascular and respiratory depression resulting in hypotension, apnea and airway obstruction. For these reasons, only suitably trained medical personnel should give thiopental {{in an environment}} suitably {{equipped to deal with}} these effects. Side effects include headache, agitated emergence, prolonged somnolence, and nausea. Intravenous administration of sodium thiopental is followed instantly by <b>an</b> <b>odor</b> and/or taste sensation, sometimes described as being similar to rotting onions, or to garlic. The hangover from the side effects may last up to 36 hours.|$|E
30|$|It {{was decided}} {{to focus on the}} outer theca, which showed high {{antioxidant}} and antibacterial activities. We also wanted to examine the deodorizing activity of the outer theca against various kinds of odor. Odorous gases used in the deodorization assays were ammonia and trimethylamine as basic odors, acetic acid as <b>an</b> acidic <b>odor,</b> and acetaldehyde as <b>a</b> neutral <b>odor.</b>|$|R

25|$|The flies {{also cause}} a huge {{economic}} problem in Asia, Africa, and the Pacific. In these areas sun-drying {{is the major}} method of preserving fish, as ice is typically unaffordable. However, blowfly larvae tend to infect these sun-dried fish {{when the weather is}} warm and humid. In an experiment, 95% of the infecting flies were found to be C. megacephala. The flies can be controlled by using <b>an</b> <b>odor</b> that the flies are attracted to trap them. Insecticides are also used, although this results in the development of resistance.|$|E
25|$|In 1920, Otto Hunziker {{authored}} The Butter Industry, Prepared for Factory, School and Laboratory, {{a well-known}} {{text in the}} industry that enjoyed at least three editions (1920, 1927, 1940). As part of {{the efforts of the}} American Dairy Science Association, Professor Hunziker and others published articles regarding: causes of tallowiness (<b>an</b> <b>odor</b> defect, distinct from rancidity, a taste defect); mottles (an aesthetic issue related to uneven color); introduced salts; the impact of creamery metals and liquids; and acidity measurement. These and other ADSA publications helped standardize practices internationally.|$|E
25|$|Various organic {{diseases}} {{may cause}} parosmias (distortion {{of the sense}} of smell). Also, since smell and taste are intimately linked senses, disorders of gustation (e.g. dysgeusia- taste dysfunction) can present as a complaint related to smell, and vice versa. These conditions, collectively termed chemosensory dysfunctions, are many and varied, and they may trigger a person to complain of <b>an</b> <b>odor</b> than is not present, however the diagnostic criteria for ORS require the exclusion of any such causes. They include pathology of the right hemisphere of the brain, substance abuse, arteriovenous malformations in the brain, and temporal lobe epilepsy.|$|E
