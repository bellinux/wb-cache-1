Once her magic mirror {{tells her}} that Snow White is fairer than she is, she immediately enlists Humbert the huntsman {{to kill her}} in the woods. After she discovers that Snow White did not die, she disguises herself as an old hag and uses a poisoned apple to remove Snow White from her path without killing her.|$|E
5|$|A common {{interpretation}} of Either/Or presents {{the reader with}} a choice between two approaches to life. There are no standards or guidelines which indicate how to choose. The reasons for choosing an ethical way of life over the aesthetic only make sense if one is already committed to an ethical way of life. Suggesting the aesthetic approach <b>as</b> <b>evil</b> implies one has already accepted {{the idea that there}} is a good/evil distinction to be made. Likewise, choosing an aesthetic way of life only appeals to the aesthete, ruling Judge Vilhelm's ethics as inconsequential and preferring the pleasures of seduction. Thus, existentialists see Victor Eremita as presenting a radical choice in which no pre-ordained value can be discerned. One must choose, and through one's choices, one creates what one is.|$|E
5|$|An Indian {{resistance}} movement against U.S. expansion {{had been growing}} through {{the leadership of the}} Shawnee brothers, Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa (The Prophet). The conflict became known as Tecumseh's War. Tenskwatawa convinced the native tribes that they would be protected by the Great Spirit and no harm could befall them if they would rise up against the white settlers. He encouraged resistance by telling the tribes to pay white traders only half of what they owed and to give up all the white man's ways, including their clothing, muskets, and especially whiskey, which was becoming known <b>as</b> <b>evil</b> for American Indians.|$|E

40|$|There is, I shall assume, {{such a thing}} <b>as</b> moral <b>evil</b> (more {{on which}} below). My {{question}} is whether is also such a thing <b>as</b> non-moral <b>evil,</b> and in particular whether there are such things <b>as</b> aesthetic <b>evil</b> and epistemic evil. More exactly, my question is whether {{there is such a}} thing <b>as</b> moral <b>evil</b> but not such a thing <b>as</b> non-moral <b>evil,</b> in some sense that reveals something special about the moral, as opposed to such would-be non-moral domains as the aesthetic and the epistemic. The philosophical issue at stake here is that of the nature of these different normative domains, and the nature and extent of their difference...|$|R

5|$|The Eye's {{aggression}} {{may even}} extend to deities who, unlike Apep, are not regarded <b>as</b> <b>evil.</b> Evidence in early funerary texts suggests that at dawn, Ra {{was believed to}} swallow the multitude of other gods, who in this instance are equated with the stars, which vanish at sunrise and reappear at sunset. In doing so, he absorbs the gods' power, thereby renewing his own vitality, before spitting them out again at nightfall. The solar Eye is said to assist in this effort, slaughtering the gods for Ra to eat. The red light of dawn therefore signifies the blood produced by this slaughter.|$|E
5|$|Within the Woods {{was later}} {{retooled}} by Raimi with a vastly higher production value and a full-length running {{time as the}} 1981 film The Evil Dead. The Evil Dead {{would go on to}} be the first installment of a film franchise spawning two sequels, Evil Dead II (1987), and Army of Darkness (1992), both of which were directed by Raimi and featured Campbell as Ash Williams. A remake, known <b>as</b> <b>Evil</b> Dead, was released in 2013 with Raimi and Campbell as producers and creative consultants. In 2015, the Starz television network began airing the ongoing comedy horror series Ash vs Evil Dead, which features Bruce Campbell returning as an older Ash Williams.|$|E
5|$|Earthsea {{itself is}} an {{archipelago}} {{or group of}} islands. In the fictional history of this world, the islands were raised from the ocean by Segoy, an ancient deity or hero. The world is inhabited by both humans and dragons, and several among the humans are sorcerers or wizards. The world is shown as being based on a delicate balance, which most of its inhabitants are aware of, but which is disrupted by somebody {{in each of the}} original trilogy of novels. The setting of Earthsea is preindustrial, and has many cultures within the widespread archipelago. Most of the characters of the story are of the Hardic peoples, who are dark-skinned, and who populate most of the islands. Some of the Eastern islands are populated by the white-skinned Kargish people, who see the Hardic folk <b>as</b> <b>evil</b> sorcerers: the Kargish, in turn, are viewed by the Hardic as barbarians. The far western regions of the archipelago are where the dragons live.|$|E

5|$|Since the Bronze Age of Comics, the Joker {{has been}} {{interpreted}} as an archetypal trickster, displaying talents for cunning intelligence, social engineering, pranks, theatricality, and idiomatic humor. Like the trickster, the Joker alternates between malicious violence and clever, harmless whimsy. He is amoral and not driven by ethical considerations, but by a shameless and insatiable nature, and although his actions are condemned <b>as</b> <b>evil,</b> he is necessary for cultural robustness. The trickster employs amoral and immoral acts to destabilize {{the status quo and}} reveal cultural, political, and ethical hypocrisies that society attempts to ignore. However, the Joker differs in that his actions typically only benefit himself. The Joker possesses abnormal body imagery, reflecting an inversion of order. The trickster is simultaneously subhuman and superhuman, a being that indicates a lack of unity in body and mind. In Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth, the Joker serves as Batman's trickster guide through the hero's own psyche, testing him in various ways before ultimately offering to cede his rule of the Asylum to Batman.|$|E

25|$|Chandogya Upanishad, {{in chapter}} 1.2, {{describes}} {{the battle between}} Devas and Asuras on various sensory powers. This battle {{between good and evil}} fails to produce a victor and simply manifests itself in the perceived universe, <b>as</b> good or <b>evil</b> sights witnessed by beings, <b>as</b> good or <b>evil</b> words shared between people, <b>as</b> good or <b>evil</b> smells of nature, <b>as</b> good or <b>evil</b> feelings experienced, <b>as</b> good or <b>evil</b> thoughts within each person. Finally, the Deva-Asura battle targets the soul, where Asuras fail and Devas succeed, because soul-force is serene and inherently good, asserts Chandogya Upanishad.|$|R
