5|$|In {{the sport}} of ferret-legging, {{competitors}} tie their trousers <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ankles</b> before placing two ferrets inside and securely fastening their belts to prevent the ferrets from escaping. Each competitor then {{stands in front of}} the judges for as long as he can. Competitors cannot be drunk or drugged, nor can the ferrets be sedated. In addition, competitors are not allowed to wear underwear beneath their trousers, which must allow the ferrets free access from one leg to the other, and the ferrets must have a full set of teeth that must not have been filed or otherwise blunted. The winner is the person who lasts the longest.|$|E

5|$|Heinrich Mallison from Berlin's Museum of Natural History also {{presented}} a theory in 2011, suggesting that Tyrannosaurus {{and many other}} dinosaurs may have achieved relatively high speeds through short rapid strides instead of the long strides employed by modern birds and mammals when running, likening their movement to power-walking. This, according to Mallison, would have been achievable irrespective of joint strength and lessened {{the need for additional}} muscle mass in the legs, particularly <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ankles.</b> To support his theory, Mallison assessed the limbs of various dinosaurs and found that they were different from those of modern mammals and birds; having their stride length greatly limited by their skeletons, but also having relatively large muscles at the hindquarters. He found a few similarities between the muscles in dinosaurs and race-walkers; having less muscle mass in the ankles but more at the hindquarters. John Hutchinson advised caution regarding this theory, suggesting that they must first look into dinosaur muscles to see how frequently they could have contracted.|$|E

25|$|The {{silhouette}} changed {{once again}} as the Victorian era drew to a close. The shape was essentially an inverted triangle, with a wide-brimmed hat on top, a full upper body with puffed sleeves, no bustle, and a skirt that narrowed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ankles</b> (the hobble skirt was a fad shortly {{after the end of}} the Victorian era). The enormous wide-brimmed hats were covered with elaborate creations of silk flowers, ribbons, and above all, exotic plumes; hats sometimes included entire exotic birds that had been stuffed. Many of these plumes came from birds in the Florida everglades, which were nearly made entirely extinct by overhunting. By 1899, early environmentalists like Adeline Knapp were engaged in efforts to curtail the hunting for plumes. By 1900, more than five million birds a year were being slaughtered, and nearly 95 percent of Florida's shore birds had been killed by plume hunters.|$|E

25|$|Santa Rosa Junior College art student Kim Wendy Allen, 19, {{was given}} a ride by two men on March 4, 1972, from her job at Larkspur Natural Foods to San Rafael. They last saw her at {{approximately}} 5:20 pm hitchhiking to school near the Bell Avenue entrance to Highway 101, northbound, carrying a large wooden soy barrel with red Chinese characters on it. Her body was found the following day down an embankment in a creek bed twenty feet off Enterprise Road in Santa Rosa. The victim had been bound <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ankles</b> and wrists, raped and slowly strangled with a cord for an estimated thirty minutes. Semen was recovered from the body and a single gold loop earring was found at the site. Markings {{at the top of}} the embankment and a possible leg impression in the loam indicated the assailant likely slipped or fell while throwing or transporting the body. The two men who gave her a ride, one of whom {{was given a}}nd passed a polygraph test, were ruled out as suspects.|$|E
25|$|After {{years of}} removal of {{artifacts}} by divers, little of value {{was thought to}} remain. Significant artifacts recovered include the statue of Genoese Admiral Andrea Doria, for whom the ship was named. It {{was removed from the}} first-class lounge, having been cut off <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ankles</b> to accomplish this. Examples of the ship's china have long been considered valuable mementos of diving the wreck. The ship's bell is normally considered to be the prize of a wreck. This ship carried three bells: one bell located on the bridge, and two much larger ceremonial bells located on the fore and aft decks. The ship's stern bell was retrieved in the late 1980s by a team of divers led by Bill Nagle. On June 26, 2010, a diver from New Jersey, Carl Bayer, discovered the bridge bell lying on the bottom at 241feet. He recovered it with assistance from Ernie Rookey, also from New Jersey. The bell, measuring 16inches tall and weighing 73.5pounds, was possibly used to signal fog {{on the night of the}} collision. The forward bell remains undiscovered. It has for years been thought to be in the ship's paint locker where it was stored during ocean crossings, but recent reports indicate that that part of the ship has collapsed in on itself and the forward bell may never be found.|$|E

500|$|Ganesha's {{earliest}} {{name was}} Ekadanta (One Tusked), {{referring to his}} single whole tusk, the other being broken. Some of the earliest images of Ganesha show him holding his broken tusk. The importance of this distinctive feature {{is reflected in the}} Mudgala Purana, which states that the name of Ganesha's second incarnation is Ekadanta. Ganesha's protruding belly appears as a distinctive attribute in his earliest statuary, which dates to the Gupta period (4th to 6th centuries). This feature is so important that according to the Mudgala Purana, two different incarnations of Ganesha use names based on it: Lambodara (Pot Belly, or, literally, Hanging Belly) and Mahodara (Great Belly). [...] Both names are Sanskrit compounds describing his belly (IAST: [...] ). The Brahmanda Purana says that Ganesha has the name Lambodara because all the universes (i.e., cosmic eggs; IAST: [...] ) of the past, present, and future are present in him. The number of Ganesha's arms varies; his best-known forms have between two and sixteen arms. Many depictions of Ganesha feature four arms, which is mentioned in Puranic sources and codified as a standard form in some iconographic texts. His earliest images had two arms. [...] Forms with 14 and 20 arms appeared in Central India during the 9th and the 10th centuries. The serpent is a common feature in Ganesha iconography and appears in many forms. [...] According to the Ganesha Purana, Ganesha wrapped the serpent Vasuki around his neck. Other depictions of snakes include use as a sacred thread (IAST: [...] ) wrapped around the stomach as a belt, held in a hand, coiled <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ankles,</b> or as a throne. [...] Upon Ganesha's forehead may be a third eye or the sectarian mark (IAST: [...] ), which consists of three horizontal lines. [...] The Ganesha Purana prescribes a tilaka mark as well as a crescent moon on the forehead. A distinct form of Ganesha called Bhalachandra (IAST: [...] "Moon on the Forehead") includes that iconographic element. Ganesha is often described as red in color. Specific colors are associated with certain forms. Many examples of color associations with specific meditation forms are prescribed in the Sritattvanidhi, a treatise on Hindu iconography. For example, white is associated with his representations as Heramba-Ganapati and Rina-Mochana-Ganapati (Ganapati Who Releases from Bondage). Ekadanta-Ganapati is visualized as blue during meditation in that form.|$|E

In rural Punjab, the shalwar is still called the suthan, which is a different garment that was popular in previous centuries, alongside the churidar and kameez combination (which is still popular). In Britain, South Asian women from the Punjab region have brought the dress to the mainstream, and even high-fashion, appeal. The Punjabi suit is popular in other regions of South Asia, such as Mumbai and Sindh. Punjabi suits are also popular among young women in Bangladesh and are especially popular amongst school girls in India. The outfit is also popular in Afghanistan, where it is called the Punjabi.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWhereas the acuity of <b>the</b> {{position}} sense <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ankle</b> can {{be disturbed}} by muscle fatigue, it recently {{also has been}} shown to be improved, under normal ankle neuromuscular state, through the use of an artificial tongue-placed tactile biofeedback. The underlying principle of this biofeedback consisted of supplying individuals with supplementary information about the position of their matching ankle position relative to their reference ankle position through electrotactile stimulation of the tongue. Within this context, the purpose of the present experiment was to investigate whether this biofeedback could mitigate the deleterious effect of muscle fatigue on joint position sense <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ankle.</b> To address this objective, sixteen young healthy university students were asked to perform an active ankle-matching task in two conditions of No-fatigue and Fatigue of <b>the</b> <b>ankle</b> muscles and two conditions of No-biofeedback and Biofeedback. Measures of the overall accuracy and the variability of the positioning were determined using the absolute error and the variable error, respectively. Results showed that the availability of the biofeedback allowed the subjects to suppress the deleterious effects of muscle fatigue on joint position sense <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ankle.</b> In <b>the</b> context of sensory re-weighting process, these findings suggested that the central nervous system was able to integrate and increase the relative contribution of the artificial tongue-placed tactile biofeedback to compensate for a proprioceptive degradation <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ankle...</b>|$|R
