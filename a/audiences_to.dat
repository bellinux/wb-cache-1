5|$|In 1983 FIG {{evolved into}} the European Women's Improvising Group (EWIG), bowing to {{pressure}} to tone down their name. FIG were influential on the second-generation improvisation scene and spawned a number of women-only improvising groups and events. FIG were also educational in that they exposed new <b>audiences</b> <b>to</b> improvisation and feminism.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, Nine Inch Nails {{began the}} Pretty Hate Machine Tour Series, {{in which they}} toured North America as an opening act for {{alternative}} rock artists such as Peter Murphy and The Jesus and Mary Chain. Reznor began smashing his equipment while on stage; Rockbeat interviewer Mike Gitter attributed the live band's early success in front of rock oriented <b>audiences</b> <b>to</b> this aggressive attitude. Nine Inch Nails then embarked on a world tour that continued through the first Lollapalooza festival in 1991.|$|E

40|$|Humans are {{vigilant}} against {{deception and}} misinterpretation {{thanks to a}} set of cognitive mechanisms that monitor their interlocutors’ benevolence, credibility, competence and preferences, as well as the plausibility and acceptability of the interpretative hypotheses constructed. This paper explores the role of these mechanisms in the comprehension of puns. Through purposeful ambiguity, these bias the <b>audience</b> <b>to</b> an interpretation which, despite initially receiving some credibility, must be dismissed in order for the <b>audience</b> <b>to</b> arrive at a less salient interpretation. In doing so, this paper suggests an approach to their comprehension that differs from previous relevance-theoretic ones, which regard optimal relevance as the criterion determining the acceptability of interpretative hypotheses. Vigilance mechanisms are here argued to be essential for the <b>audience</b> <b>to</b> consider additional interpretative hypotheses, as these mechanisms alert the <b>audience</b> <b>to</b> the punster’s jocular intention, which surfaces in the production of a text amenable to reinterpretation. They also trigger a sophisticated processing strategy that encourages the <b>audience</b> <b>to</b> backtrack in order to detect the reinterpretable part of the text. This involves metarepresentation, as the <b>audience</b> need <b>to</b> attribute to the communicator the intention to transmit a different message...|$|R
5|$|In February 2015, it was {{reported}} that Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan would be writing a new Halloween film, along with Malek Akkad and Matt Stein producing. On June 15, 2015, it was further reported that The Weinstein Company was moving ahead with another Halloween sequel, tentatively titled Halloween Returns with Dunstan directing. The film would've been a standalone film set to reintroduce <b>audiences</b> <b>to</b> Michael Myers years after his initial rampage. It would pit a new group of Haddonfield youngsters against Myers.|$|E
5|$|Initially the reopened theatre {{struggled}} to become profitable despite appearances by Henry Irving among others. In 1885 William Lewis {{took over as}} the lessee and was followed, in 1892, by his son Egbert Lewis. They redecorated the theatre in 1892 and attracted larger regular <b>audiences</b> <b>to</b> performances of melodrama and comedy while starting to put on Gilbert and Sullivan operas and other attractions.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} to use English-speaking actors was made early.

5|$|The film {{had its own}} {{share of}} controversies. A news report showcased the omnipresent piracy in the Telugu film {{industry}} by quoting the cheap prices at which the film was being sold. The film's lead actor, Siddharth even went on to request the <b>audiences</b> <b>to</b> buy the original audio CD. The film's producer, Dil Raju, ensured a special code on each distributed print to track piracy with a warning for copyright violation which would incur a fine or a jail term.|$|E
5|$|A modern {{review was}} given by University of York Professor Judith Buchanan. Buchanan recognizes that the film's acting was commended for its action and {{highlights}} the acting of the fool, placed prominently in the foreground, and says that {{it seems as if}} he has been imported from King Lear. This fool serves as an exaggerated proxy for the audience and filters a set of responses for the audience and goes on to steal the reunion scene with his expressions. Buchanan says that adapting the Shakespeare play to the one reel format required foreknowledge of the subject for <b>audiences</b> <b>to</b> intelligibly follow the subject. Buchanan also notes that this transitional period included lecturers who were hired to give supplementary lectures or commentary on the film being exhibited and the additional commentary for Shakespeare adaptations was desirable.|$|E
5|$|Although some nudes {{by foreign}} artists {{were held in}} private English collections, the country had no {{tradition}} of depicting unclothed figures and the display and distribution of such material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice. Etty was the first British artist to specialise in paintings of nudes, and the reaction of uneducated <b>audiences</b> <b>to</b> these paintings caused concern throughout the 19th century. Many critics condemned his repeated depictions of female nudity as indecent, although his portraits of males in a similar state of undress were generally well received.|$|E

5|$|Despite his {{resignation}} from the Senate, Pierce {{had no intention}} of leaving public life. The move to Concord had given him more opportunities for cases, and allowed Jane a more robust community life. Jane had remained in Concord with her young son Frank and her newborn Benjamin for the latter part of Pierce's Senate term, and this separation had taken a toll on the family. Pierce, meanwhile, had begun a demanding but lucrative law partnership with Asa Fowler during congressional recesses. Pierce returned to Concord in early 1842, and his reputation as a lawyer continued to flourish. Known for his gracious personality, eloquence, and excellent memory, Pierce would attract large <b>audiences</b> <b>to</b> hear him in court. He would often represent poor people for little or no compensation.|$|E
5|$|Grossman and Schafer brainstormed {{regularly}} to devise the time travel puzzles, and collaborated {{with members of}} the development team as well as other LucasArts employees. They would identify puzzle problems and work towards a solution similar to how the game plays. Most issues were addressed prior to programming, but some details were left unfinished to work on later. The staff conceived puzzles involving the U.S.'s early history based on their memory of their compulsory education, and using the more legendary aspects of history, such as George Washington cutting down a cherry tree to appeal to international <b>audiences.</b> <b>To</b> complete the elements, Grossman researched the period to maintain historical accuracy, visiting libraries and contacting reference librarians. The studio, however, took creative license towards facts to fit them into the game's design.|$|E
5|$|Havins was {{influenced}} in {{her decision to}} accept the part by her husband's appreciation of the series. Like Rex, Esther is used by executive producer Russell T Davies {{as a means of}} introducing new American <b>audiences</b> <b>to</b> the established mythos of Torchwood. Havins stated the character to have an unrequited love for Rex, but explained that he does not appear to notice. Response to the character varied; some critics praised her characterisation and portrayal whilst others felt her to display incompetency and to not have been taken to by the audience. The nature of her exit from the show was generally praised, though some reviewers felt it lacked the desired emotional impact.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1890s, Jane Addams and Smith had a {{disagreement}} over Hull House's Sunday concerts. Smith, a classically trained musician, {{felt that the}} purpose of the events should be to present educationally challenging programs. Addams, felt that the programs should feature more popular music to promote Hull House and recruit broad <b>audiences</b> <b>to</b> experience the environment which the settlement house offered. A compromise was finally reached at the turn of the decade, with Sunday concerts featuring music which had a more popular appeal, and weekday evening programs focusing on more challenging material. The disagreement over content was serious enough to lead to Smith's resignation in 1901. Though Addams did not relent on the Sunday content, she was able to persuade Smith to remain.|$|E

After its wide release in Japan on March 14, 2014, a similar sing-along version of Frozen {{was released in}} the country in select theaters on April 26. In Japanese-dubbed versions, Japanese lyrics of the songs appeared on screen for <b>audiences</b> <b>to</b> sing along with the characters.

Mahaleo was the first Malagasy band {{to be invited to}} perform at the historic Olympia venue in Paris. The band {{has been the subject of}} two books and one feature-length documentary film.

5|$|The film had regular showings in many theaters worldwide, {{with many}} as a monthly event. Fans {{interact}} with the film {{in a similar fashion}} to The Rocky Horror Picture Show; audience members dress up as their favorite characters, throw plastic spoons in reference to an unexplained framed photo of a spoon on a table in Johnny's living room, toss footballs to each other from short distances, and yell insulting comments {{about the quality of the}} film as well as lines from the film itself. Wiseau has claimed that it was his intent for <b>audiences</b> <b>to</b> find humor in the film, although viewers and some of the cast members generally have viewed it as a poorly-made drama.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} film resurfaced {{some four}} decades {{later at the}} 2005 Udine Far East Film Festival in the No Borders, No Limits: Nikkatsu Action Cinema retrospective. Mark Schilling curated the retrospective in order to expose international <b>audiences</b> <b>to</b> 1960s Nikkatsu Action films which, aside from the films of Seijun Suzuki, remained predominately unseen outside Japan. Schilling originally titled the film Season of Heat—a literal translation of the Japanese title—but it was retitled The Warped Ones for subsequent incarnations of the retrospective, which included runs in Austin and New York. It also appeared in a 12-film retrospective of Koreyoshi Kurahara's Nikkatsu films at the 2008 Tokyo Filmex International Film Festival in Japan. It was screened with English subtitles.|$|E
