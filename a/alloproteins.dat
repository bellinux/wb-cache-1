500|$|Twenty of the proteinogenic {{amino acids}} are encoded {{directly}} by triplet codons in {{the genetic code}} and are known as [...] "standard" [...] amino acids. The other two ("non-standard" [...] or [...] "non-canonical") are selenocysteine (present in many prokaryotes {{as well as most}} eukaryotes, but not coded directly by DNA), and pyrrolysine (found only in some archea and one bacterium). Pyrrolysine and selenocysteine are encoded via variant codons; for example, selenocysteine is encoded by stop codon and SECIS element. N-formylmethionine (which is often the initial amino acid of proteins in bacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts) is generally considered as a form of methionine rather than as a separate proteinogenic amino acid.

50|$|<b>Alloprotein</b> uses {{include the}} {{incorporation}} of unusual or heavy atoms for diffractive structure analysis, photo-reactive linkers (photocrosslinkers), fluorescent groups (used as labelled probes), and molecular switches for signaling pathways.|$|R
50|$|Modern <b>alloprotein</b> {{techniques}} were first {{developed in the}} late 1980s by Miyazawa and Yokoyama at the University of Tokyo to address limitations of existing methods: genetic manipulation {{was limited to the}} 20 standard amino acids, chemical synthesis was limited to small scale and low yield.|$|R
5000|$|An <b>alloprotein</b> {{is a novel}} {{synthetic}} protein containing one or more [...] "non-natural" [...] amino acids. Non-natural in {{the context}} means an amino acid either not occurring in nature (novel and synthesised amino acids), or occurring in nature but not naturally occurring within proteins (natural but non-proteinogenic amino acids).|$|R
50|$|In this context, the SPI method generates {{recombinant}} protein variants or <b>alloproteins</b> directly by substitution of natural amino acids with unnatural counterparts. An amino acid auxotrophic expression host is supplemented with an amino acid analog during target protein expression. This approach avoids {{the pitfalls of}} suppression-based methods and it is superior to {{it in terms of}} efficiency, reproducibility and an extremely simple experimental setup. Numerous studies demonstrated how global substitution of canonical amino acids with various isosteric analogs caused minimal structural perturbations but dramatic changes in thermodynamic, folding, aggregation spectral properties and enzymatic activity.|$|E

5000|$|One {{approach}} {{takes advantage}} of the redundancy of the 3 codons that encode a [...] "stop" [...] signal. If one of these can be substituted by another stop codon, then that codon can in principle be [...] "reassigned" [...] (along with requisite tRNA, release factor and enzyme modifications) to code for a novel amino acid without affecting other existing codings. Using this approach, <b>alloproteins</b> and novel amino acids can be created by techniques that [...] "expand" [...] the genetic code to include additional novel codings, using newly devised codons and related tRNA (transfer RNA) and tRNA synthetase enzymes (aminoacyl tRNA synthetase). The usual mechanisms, which produce amino acids and combine them into proteins, then produce novel or non-proteinogenic amino acids and incorporate them to make novel proteins the same way. In 2010 this technique was used to reassign a codon in the genetic code of the bacterium E. coli, modifying it to produce and incorporate a novel amino acid, without adversely affecting existing encodings or the organism itself.|$|E
50|$|There {{have been}} many studies that have {{produced}} protein with non-standard amino acids, {{but they do not}} alter the genetic code. These protein, called <b>alloprotein,</b> are made by incubating cells with an unnatural amino acid {{in the absence of a}} similar coded amino acid in order for the former to be incorporated into protein in place of the latter, for example L-2-aminohexanoic acid (Ahx) for methionine (Met).|$|R
40|$|Endeavoring {{to develop}} a method to biosynthesize {{proteins}} substituted with nonprotein amino acids, we attempted the incorporation of L- 2 -aminohexanoic acid (Ahx) into human epidermal growth factor (hEGF). Escherichia coli YK 537 strain harboring plasmid pTA 1522, which has the phoA promoter-phoA signal peptide-hEGF gene, was used. Cells were cultured first in high-phosphate medium and then, for induction of the hEGF-encoding gene, transferred to low-phosphate medium containing Ahx (0. 25 mg/ml). hEGF and Ahx-substituted hEGF, [Ahx 21]hEGF, secreted into the periplasm were recovered. After treatment with H 2 O 2, [Ahx 21]-hEGF was clearly separated from methionine-oxidized hEGF by one-step reverse-phase HPLC. Substitution of the methionine residue of hEGF with Ahx was confirmed by the amino acid analysis of [Ahx 21]hEGF. The three biological activities of [Ahx 21]hEGF {{were the same as}} those of hEGF. From the successful production of [Ahx 21]hEGF, a basic strategy was established for preparing proteins substituted with nonprotein amino acid (<b>alloprotein).</b> Induction of the phoA promoter of pho regulon and secretion of the product to the periplasm may depress heat shock-like responses and subsequent hydrolysis of the product by cytoplasmic protease...|$|R
40|$|Biosynthetic {{incorporation}} of tryptophan (Trp) analogues in recombinant proteins using an E. coli Trp auxotroph expression host {{is limited to}} analogues modified with a small substituent like a fluoro atom or a hydroxyl or amine group. We report here the efficient incorporation (> 89 %) of chloro- and bromo atoms containing Trp analogues in <b>alloproteins</b> at high expression levels using a Lactococcus lactis Trp auxotroph strain. This result was only obtained after coexpression of the enzyme tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (TrpRS) of L. lactis, an enzyme believed to show a more relaxed substrate specificity than TrpRS from E. coli. Chloro- and bromo-Trps are attractive intrinsic phosphorescence probes as these Trp analogues are much less sensitive for quenchers in the medium, like oxygen, than Trp. Coexpression of TrpRS was also essential for the biosynthetic incorporation (94 %) of the Trp analogue 5, 6 difluoroTrp. This makes our expression system ideally suited to generate a set of methyl- and fluoro-substituted Trp analogue-containing <b>alloproteins</b> in high yield for investigating {{the involvement of the}} Trp residue in cation-pi or pi-pi interactions. Taken together, the presented Trp auxotroph expression system features the most relaxed specificity for Trp analogue structures reported to date and gives a high alloprotein yield. ...|$|E
40|$|In all {{contemporary}} organisms, {{the active}} {{site of the}} ribosome—the peptidyl transferase center—catalyzes two distinct reactions, peptide bond formation between peptidyl-tRNA and aminoacyl-tRNA {{as well as the}} hydrolysis of peptidyl-tRNA {{with the help of a}} release factor. However, when provided with appropriate substrates, ribosomes can also catalyze a broad range of other chemical reaction, which provides the basis for orthogonal translation and synthesis of <b>alloproteins</b> from unnatural building blocks. Advances in understanding the mechanisms of the two ubiquitous reactions, the peptide bond formation and peptide release, provide insights into the versatility of the active site of the ribosome. Release factors 1 and 2 and elongation factor P are auxiliary factors that augment the intrinsic catalytic activity of the ribosome in special cases...|$|E
