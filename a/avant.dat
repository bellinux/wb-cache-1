Ernest <b>Avants,</b> a former Ku Klux Klan member, was accused of killing Ben Chester White in 1967. Kornblum testified <b>Avants</b> confessed to the crime, [...] "'Yeah, I shot that nigger,'", but <b>Avants</b> added that when he shot White, another man had already shot him several times. Kornblum noted Avants' attorney advised him he would be acquitted as [...] "you can't be convicted for killing a dead man." [...] <b>Avants</b> was convicted and later died in prison.|$|R

5|$|Blackout {{represents}} a musical departure from Spears' earlier work featuring a foreboding and atmospheric tone {{in terms of}} musical and lyrical direction. She collaborated with producers including Danja, Bloodshy & <b>Avant,</b> Sean Garrett, and The Neptunes in several recording studios around the United States, including Spears' home in Los Angeles, {{with the intention of}} creating uptempo, high-energy music. Their efforts resulted in a primarily dance-pop and electropop record, which sees additional influences from Euro disco, dubstep and funk. The lyrical themes revolve around love, fame, media scrutiny, sex, and clubbing.|$|E
5|$|Elements of Tristano's early playing – counterpoint, reharmonizing, {{and strict}} time – {{influenced}} Miles Davis' Birth of the Cool, and the playing of saxophonist Gerry Mulligan and pianist Dave Brubeck. Tristano's early, more feelings-based performances also influenced {{the style of}} pianist Bill Evans, who also used overdubbing and multitracking in his own recordings after Tristano had experimented with the techniques. <b>Avant</b> garde musician Anthony Braxton has often mentioned Tristano {{and some of his}} students as influences.|$|E
5|$|Even so, Christians {{have noted}} with concern the {{disintegration}} of traditional Huaorani culture and westernization of the tribe, beginning with Nate Saint's own journal entry in 1955 and continuing through today. However, many continue to view as positive both Operation Auca and the subsequent missionary efforts of Rachel Saint, mission organizations such as Mission Aviation Fellowship, Wycliffe Bible Translators, HCJB World Radio, <b>Avant</b> Ministries (formerly Gospel Missionary Union), and others. Specifically, they note the decline in violence among tribe members, numerous conversions to Christianity, and growth of the local church.|$|E

He also participated on the 2005 <b>avant</b> garde album Hymn to Sophia by the jazz saxophonist John Tchicai, where he improvised on pipe organ with Tchicai and the percussionist Peter Ole Jørgensen.|$|E
5|$|Nevinson {{studied at}} the Slade School of Art under Henry Tonks and {{alongside}} Stanley Spencer and Mark Gertler. When he left the Slade, Nevinson befriended Marinetti, {{the leader of the}} Italian Futurists, and the radical writer and artist Wyndham Lewis, who founded the short-lived Rebel Art Centre. However, Nevinson fell out with Lewis and the other 'rebel' artists when he attached their names to the Futurist movement. Lewis immediately founded the Vorticists, an <b>avant</b> garde group of artists and writers from which Nevinson was excluded.|$|E
5|$|The Commandos {{were divided}} into three groups: One and Two would travel in the MLs, while Three would be in Campbeltown. Under the command of Captain Hodgeson, Group One had the {{objectives}} of securing the Old Mole and eliminating the anti-aircraft gun positions around the southern quays. They were then {{to move into the}} old town and blow up the power station, bridges and locks for the new entrance into the basin from the <b>Avant</b> port. The capture of the mole was a major objective, as it was to be the embarkation point for the evacuation after the mission.|$|E

5|$|Goldfaden had an on-again off-again {{relationship}} with Zionism. Some of his earliest poetry was Zionist <b>avant</b> la lettre {{and one of}} his last plays was written in Hebrew; several of his plays were implicitly or explicitly Zionist (Shulamith set in Jerusalem, Mashiach Tzeiten?! ending with its protagonists abandoning New York for Palestine); he served as a delegate from Paris to the World Zionist Congress in 1900. Still, {{he spent most of his}} life (and set slightly more than half of his plays) in the Pale of Settlement and in the adjoining Jewish areas in Romania, and when he left it was never to go to Palestine, but to cities such as New York, London or Paris. This might be understandable when the number of his potential Jewish spectators in Palestine in his time was very small.|$|E
5|$|Lennon {{did much}} of his songwriting in the attic, where he had several Studer tape recorders. Little was done with them until fellow Beatle Paul McCartney came over and helped re-install them in sequence, so overdubs could be made. Lennon could thus record his own doubletracked song demos. (These demos, and some other, more <b>avant</b> garde sound {{recordings}} also made in the attic, have appeared on various bootlegs). The attic also contained a mellotron, an electronic organ, a piano, a Vox AC30 amplifier and several guitars (including his first Rickenbacker 325, a Hofner Senator, and his Rickenbacker 1996), {{all of which were}} used when songwriting. Lennon also wrote on an upright piano in the sunroom.|$|E

She made her 2016–17 Division 1 Féminine debut on January 14 during a 3–0 win against En <b>Avant</b> de Guingamp and recorded two assists. During a match against ASPTT Albi on March 17, she scored a brace {{in the second}} half to help lift the team to a 5–0 win. On May 7, she scored a brace during the team's 9–0 win over ASJ Soyaux after which the club was named league champions for the ninth consecutive season.

40|$|The {{first edition}} of Walker and <b>Avant’s</b> Strategies for The-ory Construction in Nursing was {{published}} in 1983, and ever since, it has remained a staple in the classic nursing develop-ment theory literature. It has been 10 years since the third edi-tion, so it is very encouraging to see an updated fourth edition. Along with Chinn and Kramer’s (2004) Integrated Knowl-edge Development in Nursing, Walker and <b>Avant’s</b> text is the only other theory book that focuses exclusively on the pro-cesses of theory development in nursing. What distinguishes these two important texts is the conceptual organization of each. While Chinn and Kramer (2004) organize theory devel-opment conceptually using Carper’s (1978) four fundamental patterns of knowing, Walker and <b>Avant’s</b> approach is less philosophic and conceptual but remains more pragmatic and procedural. Aimed primarily at master and doctoral students...|$|R
5|$|The Beatles {{hosted the}} orchestral session as a 1960s-style happening, with guests {{including}} Mick Jagger, Marianne Faithfull, Keith Richards, Brian Jones, Donovan, Pattie Boyd, Michael Nesmith, {{and members of}} the psychedelic design collective The Fool. Overseen by Tony Bramwell of NEMS Enterprises, the event was filmed for use in a projected television special that never materialised. Reflecting the Beatles' taste for experimentation and the <b>avant</b> garde, the orchestra players were asked to wear formal dress and then given a costume piece as a contrast with this attire. This resulted in different players wearing anything from fake noses to fake stick-on nipples. Martin recalled that the lead violinist performed wearing a gorilla paw, while a bassoon player placed a balloon on the end of his instrument.|$|E
5|$|The {{text of the}} {{document}} is rather vague and noncommittal. The signatories were concerned with guarding the king's honour {{and the rights of}} the Crown (garder son honeur et les dreits de sa Corounne). There was also a promise to address and correct both the things that had been done against that honour and those rights, as well as the past and present oppression of the people (les choses que sont feites <b>avant</b> ces houres countre soen honour et le droit de sa Coronne, et les oppressiouns que ount estre feit et uncore se fount de jour en jour a soen people). Nothing is said about what specifically these things were, but it must be assumed that the target was Gaveston. Bek was given the authority to excommunicate whoever broke the terms of the agreement.|$|E

Illustrator and creator of children's series Mr Benn and King Rollo, David McKee, was born and brought up in South Devon and trained at Plymouth College of Art. Jazz musician John Surman, born in nearby Tavistock, has close connections to the area, evidenced by his 2012 album Saltash Bells. The <b>avant</b> garde prepared guitarist Keith Rowe was born in the city before establishing the jazz free improvisation band AMM in London in 1965 and MIMEO in 1997. The musician and film director Cosmo Jarvis has lived in several towns in South Devon and has filmed videos in and around Plymouth. In addition, actors Sir Donald Sinden and Judi Trott.

5|$|His {{family had}} no {{theatrical}} connections, but Olivier's father, a clergyman, decided {{that his son}} should become an actor. After attending a drama school in London, Olivier learned his craft in a succession of acting jobs during the late 1920s. In 1930 he had his first important West End success in Noël Coward's Private Lives, and he appeared in his first film. In 1935 he played in a celebrated production of Romeo and Juliet alongside Gielgud and Peggy Ashcroft, {{and by the end}} of the decade he was an established star. In the 1940s, together with Richardson and John Burrell, Olivier was the co-director of the Old Vic, building it into a highly respected company. There his most celebrated roles included Shakespeare's Richard III and Sophocles's Oedipus. In the 1950s Olivier was an independent actor-manager, but his stage career was in the doldrums until he joined the <b>avant</b> garde English Stage Company in 1957 to play the title role in The Entertainer, a part he later played on film. From 1963 to 1973 he was the founding director of Britain's National Theatre, running a resident company that fostered many future stars. His own parts there included the title role in Othello (1964) and Shylock in The Merchant of Venice (1970).|$|E
5|$|In 1939 {{the museum}} began hosting the annual {{exhibitions}} of American Abstract Artists, a group devoted to expanding appreciation of non-objective art {{that had been}} formed in 1936. The show included more than 300 oils, watercolors, pastels, collages, drawings, constructions, and sculpture. That year it also began hosting exhibitions held by the New York Society of Women Artists, a group that had been founded in 1926 to promote the work of <b>avant</b> garde women artists. Other 1939 shows included contemporary works by artists from Poland, documentary photographs of child laborers by Lewis Hine, an international exhibition of works by women artists, and a large display of Pan-American art. Over {{the next few decades}} the museum would specialize in exhibitions by members of artists' groups. In addition to the two already named, these included the Silvermine Guild of Artists (a Connecticut summer art colony), the Manhattan Camera Club, the Photo-Engravers' Art Society, the Brooklyn Society of Artists, the Artists Equity Group, and USCO (a collective from the Woodstock, New York art colony and Garnerville, New York). The museum was organized as a unit of the Master Institute of United Arts. As it had previously done, the institute gave art classes, provided studio space, and sponsored lectures, concerts, poetry readings, art clinics, and other cultural events.|$|E
5|$|Literary critic Todd Garth {{argues that}} I, the Supreme is {{influenced}} by twentieth-century Argentine writer Macedonio Fernández, {{as well as other}} <b>avant</b> garde artists such as Jorge Luis Borges and Julio Cortázar. Garth suggests that Macedonio and Roa Bastos are similar in use of metaphysical language and techniques used to reconstruct reality, as Dr. Francia does in his dictated creation of the Supreme, the ruler of all reality. Macedonio's writing utilized characters that did not fit the archetype of Western fiction, each only having meaning through their interaction with others in a collective and often never experiencing growth or development in order to construct atemporal spaces of mythmaking that challenge reality. Roa Bastos borrows from these ideas yet situates them in existing political and social history to challenge perceived conceptions of the past's factuality. He dismantles national Paraguayan mythology which is so intimately intertwined with the life of Dr. Francia, elucidating the distinctions between mythic and mythological. The novel can only accomplish this task within the metaphysical space of mythmaking. Whereas Macedonio attacks the concept of the individual as subject while admitting the fact that to write makes oneself a subject, Roa Bastos recognizes this paradox and exploits it, utilizing it in concerns of political and social nature.|$|E
