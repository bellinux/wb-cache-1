The next challenge and goal is to measure the Earth's rotation variations to a precision that rivals that of the present space-geodesy techniques, thus providing an in-situ (and cost effective alternatives of Earth rotation measurement for geophysical research and geodetic applications. Aside from thermal and mechanical instabilities, "undesirable" ground motion and tilt that <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>signal</b> will need to be removed before any variation in Earth rotation can be detected. Removal of these signals, some of them are larger than the sought rotation signals, has been a typical procedure in many precise geophysical instruments, such as gravimeters, seismometers, and tiltmeters. The remaining Earth rotation signal resides in both the spin around the axis and in the orientation of the axis.

A manner to give two results from two {{different points of view}} (a kind of multi-expert results, such redundancy is desirable, particularly in biomedicine). This idea emerged from the fact that some biomedical experts are able to make a diagnosis from the observation of a signal or image biomedical results. More, usually in such biomedical applications, the knowledge representation signal is only used. In fact, the image representation offers benefit of a richer information representation than the signal one. Then, such combination (signal and image) approach will also take advantage from features which are unreachable from one-dimensional signal. In effect, the interest from the image knowledge representation (of the signal) is that some pertinent features appear in such representation which are new, and interesting to exploit, with regard to the features which <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>signal</b> knowledge representation. Some of these signal and image pertinent features could be competitive, but also complementary. Then, both of them should be exploited to reinforce or in contrary decrease a certain diagnosis which will be traduced also in different degrees of the confidence index (CI) which will be given with the associated final diagnosis result.|$|E
40|$|An {{apparatus}} for {{and method}} of eliminating single event upsets (or SEU) in combinational logic {{are used to}} prevent error propagation {{as a result of}} cosmic particle strikes to the combinational logic. The apparatus preferably includes a combinational logic block electrically coupled to a delay element, a latch and an output buffer. In operation, a signal from the combinational logic is electrically coupled to a first input of the latch. In addition, the signal is routed through the delay element to produce a delayed signal. The delayed signal is routed to a second input of the latch. The latch used in the apparatus for preventing SEU preferably includes latch outputs and a feature that the latch outputs will not change state unless both latch inputs are correct. For example, the latch outputs may not change state unless both latch inputs have the same logical state. When a cosmic particle strikes the combinational logic, a transient disturbance with a predetermined length may <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>signal.</b> However, a function of the delay element is to preferably provide a time delay greater than the length of the transient disturbance. Therefore, the transient disturbance will not reach both latch inputs simultaneously. As a result, the latch outputs will not permanently change state in error due to the transient disturbance. In addition, the output buffer preferably combines the latch outputs {{in such a way that}} the correct state is preserved at all times.

This restores the waveform to its proper shape, despite the amplifier having only a one-polarity supply. This {{is directly related to the}} second phenomenon: the waveform on the center frequency becomes less distorted. The residual distortion is dependent upon the bandwidth of the tuned load, with the center frequency seeing very little distortion, but greater attenuation the farther from the tuned frequency that <b>the</b> <b>signal</b> gets.|$|R

40|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> {{context of}} robust {{covariance}} matrix estimation, this paper proposes {{a new approach}} to understanding the behavior of scatter matrix M-estimators introduced during <b>the</b> 70 's <b>in</b> <b>the</b> statistics community. During the last decade, a renewed interest for robust estimators <b>appeared</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>signal</b> processing community, mainly due to their flexibility to the statistical model and their robustness to outliers and/or missing data. However, the behavior of these estimators still remains unclear and not understood well enough. A major disadvantage is that they are described by fixed-point equations that make their statistical analysis very difficult. To fill this gap, the main contribution of this work is to compare these estimators to the well-known sample covariance matrix (SCM) in order to infer more accurately their statistical behaviors. Indeed, under the Gaussian assumption, the SCM follows a Wishart distribution. However, when observations turn to be non-Gaussian, the SCM performance can be seriously degraded. In this article, we propose to use robust estimators, more adapted to the case of non-Gaussian models and presence of outliers, and to rely on <b>the</b> SCM properties <b>in</b> a Gaussian framework for establishing their theoretical analysis. To confirm our claims we also present results for a widely used function of $M$-estimators, the Mahalanobis distance.
