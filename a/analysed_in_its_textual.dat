No quadro da abordagem sistêmico-funcional, são analisadas as semelhanças e diferenças semânticas entre elas, tendo por base seu emprego em textos. O exame de ocorrências dessas estruturas em diferentes gêneros de textos jornalísticos - notícias, editoriais e artigos - revela diferenças de distribuição, com a quase inexistência de voz passiva sintética nas notícias. Partindo desse fato como uma evidência da não-equivalência funcional entre as duas estruturas, estuda-se o significado das ocorrências em contexto, visando a identificar a contribuição específica de cada tipo de estrutura para a realização dos significados do texto. O significado de cada estrutura é, assim, analisado em seus componentes textual, ideacional e interpessoal. No domíno textual, a voz passiva analítica, que se caracteriza pela conversão do participante paciente em Sujeito e, portanto, em Tema não-marcado, funciona primordialmente como um recurso para facilitar o posicionamento de informação dada antes de informação nova, na ordem dos constituintes oracionais. A voz passiva sintética, por sua vez, não apresenta essa propriedade de tematizar um participante, já que, na ordem não-marcada, é o Processo que ocupa a primeira posição oracional nessa estrutura. Na maioria das ocorrências de voz passiva sintética, o constituinte que seria o Sujeito da oração correspondente em voz passiva analítica representa informação nova. Sendo assim, as duas estruturas estudadas contribuem de modos diferentes para a organização do fluxo informacional do texto. No domínio ideacional, há, por um lado, uma diferença na distribuição dos tipos de processo entre as estruturas. A voz passiva sintética presta-se melhor à representação de processos mentais que a voz passiva analítica. Por outro lado, porém, é no âmbito ideacional que as duas estruturas apresentam um traço comum de significado, visto que ambas servem à representação de um processo sem a identificação do Agente. Finalmente, no domínio interpessoal, as estruturas se distinguem pelo fato de que a voz passiva sintética apresenta Sujeito indeterminado, ao contrário da voz passiva analítica. O Sujeito indeterminado, caracterizado pela indefinição máxima da categoria de pessoa, possibilita diferentes efeitos de sentido no que se refere ao envolvimento tanto do autor, quanto do leitor. Propõe-se, desse modo, uma caracterização da voz passiva analítica e da voz passiva sintética em termos de traços semânticos, na forma de um sistema de três parâmetros binários, correspondentes às três metafunções sistêmico-funcionais. Essa análise do significado em traços independentes permite compreender melhor a especificidade do potencial semântico de cada estrutura, bem como a funcionalidade de cada uma no discurso. The {{object of}} this work are the Portuguese {{grammatical}} structures traditionally known as analytical passive voice and synthetic (or pronominal) passive voice. Considering their use in texts, the semantic {{similarities and differences between}} them are analysed within a systemic- functional framework. The study of these structures in different journalistic genres - reports, editorials and articles - reveals distributional differences, as synthetic passive voice nearly does not occur in reports. Taking this fact as evidence of the functional nonequivalence between the two structures, the work studies the meaning of their occurrences in context, in order to identify the specific contribution of each type of structure to the realization of the text meanings. The meaning of each structure is thus <b>analysed</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>textual,</b> ideational and interpersonal components. In the textual domain, analytical passive voice, which is characterized by the conversion of the affected participant into Subject and, consequently, into unmarked Theme, functions primarily as a resource for placing given information before new information, in the order of clause constituents. Synthetic passive voice, on the contrary, does not bear this property of turning a participant into Theme, once it is the Process that occupies the clause first position in this structure. In most of the occurrences of synthetic passive voice, the constituent which would be the Subject of the correspondent clause in analytical passive voice represents new information. So, the two structures contribute in different ways to the organization of the informational flow of the text. In the ideational domain, there is, on the one hand, a difference in the distribution of process types between the structures. Synthetic passive voice is more suitable for the representation of mental processes than analytical passive voice. On the other hand, however, it is in the ideational component that the two structures share a semantic feature, as both of them allow representation of a process without identification of the Agent. Finally, in the interpersonal domain, the structures are distinguished by the fact that synthetic passive voice has indeterminate Subject, differently from analytical passive voice. Indeterminate Subject, characterized by a maximum indefiniteness of grammatical person, permits a variety of meaning effects concerning the author`s and the reader`s involvement. A characterization of analytical passive voice and synthetic passive voice is thus proposed in terms of semantic features, in a system of three binary parameters, correspondent to the three systemic- functional metafunctions. This analysis of meaning in independent features allows {{a better understanding of the}} specific semantic potential of each structure, as well as of the functionality of each one in discourse...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A {{number of}} investigative {{studies have been}} {{conducted}} on the meaning and function of מַשָּׂא in the prophetic literature of the Hebrew Scriptures, some of which include comprehensive reviews of previous attempts to explain the use of this term either lexically (cf. Sellin 1930; Procksch 1930; de Boer 1948; Lambert 1955; Tsevat 1958; Naudé 1969; Calvin & Owen 1989) or as a form-critical tag (cf. Weis 1992; Melugin & Sweeney 1994; Sweeney 1996; Floyd 2002) with the latest study conducted by M. J. Boda (2006 : 338 - 357), which classifies מַשָּׂא as an editorial marker. This article seeks to expand on previous attempts to explain the purpose of מַשָּׂא by categorizing the occurrence of מַשָּׂא <b>in</b> line with <b>its</b> various semantic domains. In the approach, a summative overview of the key suggestions of the term מַשָּׂא will provide a conceptual background for the investigation. Following this, the use of מַשָּׂא is systematically <b>analysed</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> various <b>textual</b> contexts throughout the Hebrew Scriptures to identify how this term was applied in popular speech, literature and translation. From this analysis, an attempt will be made to categorize מַשָּׂא into specific semantic domains and to determine how the sense in which מַשָּׂא is used in prophetic literature compares. The study concludes with a proposition that מַשָּׂא functions as a literary device to bind maśśā’-prophesies together intertextually into a virtual corpus...|$|R

Beyond that, differences appear: for example, in Mandarin a lexical item that is Given does not lose its newsworthiness (as shown by phonological prominence) when it occurs in clause-final position, {{as it does in}} English. More generally, in English the clausal Theme is strongly tied to the system of MOOD: the choice of Theme (that is, the way it is mapped on to other elements) signals the mood of the clause, as declarative, yes/no interrogative or Wh-interrogative. This is not so in Mandarin, where there is no correlation between mood and theme.|$|R

50|$|The play {{adopts a}} number of textual {{strategies}} that presuppose a relationship to performance, though it is performance conceived in a distinctly modernist way: as spatial meaning (like Artaud's mise en scène or Brecht's Gestus), self-referential (as Beckett's work increasingly became or as in Brechtian quotation), and unconstrained by any adherence to the conventions associated with traditional dramatic literature (from which each of these practitioners have displayed varying degrees of independence). Like Beckett, Stein is interested in an aesthetic of surfaces—of formal elements interacting in space—which do not serve the traditional purpose of the imitation of action. The aesthetic assumptions about performance embodied in Doctor Faustus Lights the Lights and the ambiguity <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>textual</b> composition produce elements unanchored from a referential process towards any reality other than its own occasion; it suggests a fully self-referential performance.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Although {{the native}} (tree-like) storage of XML data {{becomes more and}} more {{important}} there will be an enduring demand to manage XML data <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>textual</b> representation, for instance in relational structures or file systems. XML data has to be wellformed by definition and additionally, in many cases, it has to be valid according to a given XML schema. Because the XML column types are often derived from text types (e. g. CLOBs) guaranteeing well-formedness as well as validity is not trivial. And even worse, for frequently modified data it is usually too expensive to re-validate the whole XML data after each update – but waiving re-validation may lead to inconsistencies and malfunctions of applications. In this paper we present a schema-aware pushdown automaton (i. e. a stack machine) that validates an XML string/stream. Using an element/state-index, the pushdown automaton is able to re-validate local modifications of the data while guaranteeing overall validity. Update operations (e. g. SQLXML, XQuery updates) are validated before executing them. ...|$|R

While the show appears to make a relevant social commentary, supporting a righteous rebellion to overthrow the evil Urine Good Company, in the end, by proving that revolution does not always succeed, writers, Kotis and Hollman invalidate these commentaries, proving that despite its Brechtian appearance, the show <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>textual</b> form is much more simply a comedic parody. However, Pomona College’s production, in which I played Hope Cladwell, takes on a much more severe tone, creating legitimate commentary by replacing many of the comedic, two-dimensional characters with living breathing, realities.

The dynamics of a domain can be traced <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>textual</b> archives by {{keeping track of the}} terminological variation over a period of time. In recent years text-based terminology research has explored the linguistic representation of knowledge in texts with the aim of building high quality terminological resources.

Empirical evidence showed that terminological variation within a knowledge domain cannot be explained without insight in the origin and history of the terminology. We try and point out some parameters influencing the dynamics of understanding and the role of terminology creation therein, starting from a number of examples of evocative language and metaphor in the domain of finance, accounting and banking. Specialists have resorted to evocative language and imagery in their English language communication and this has resulted in the coinage of metaphorically motivated terminology. The issue of societal dynamics is looked at in a multilingual setting. Several examples of terminology creation based on metaphorical understanding and their (in) translatability are discussed. Finally, we tentatively investigate what can happen to metaphorical and evocative language in a translated European text on the financial crisis...|$|R
