5|$|Mulder {{meets with}} the Shooter again, who {{tells him that}} Gibson is a missing link. Mulder {{believes}} that Gibson has genes that are dormant in most humans. The Smoking Man dismisses the Well-Manicured Man's concerns about Mulder's actions. At the prison, the guard kills the Shooter. Diana Fowley, protecting Gibson in a hotel room, is shot shortly afterwards, and Gibson is captured by the Smoking Man's minions. Skinner tells Mulder of the Shooter's death, and that a flattened Morley cigarette box was found in his cell. Mulder confronts Spender, accusing him {{of working with the}} Smoking Man. The Smoking Man turns Gibson over to the Well-Manicured Man. Scully is informed by Skinner that the Justice Department is seeking to have the X-Files shut down. Mulder realizes that this was <b>all</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> plan. The Smoking Man takes Samantha's X-File from Mulder's office, and lights the room on fire. As he leaves, he meets Jeffrey, and tells him that he's his father. By the time Mulder and Scully arrive, the X-Files are completely destroyed.|$|E

25|$|Act Two follows {{immediately}} {{from the}} end of Act One. Rosie is suddenly confronted by two black-clad figures, Maurice Whickett and Tracy Taylor, the latter of whom is furious with her. When Sam returns, it is clear he knows these two strangers. It soon transpires that the three of them were <b>all</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sting: Joanna Rupelford does not actually exist, the flat has been set up for six months, there are cameras all over the flat (including the bedroom, which is some consolation to Rosie for earlier), and the operation to entrap a drugs courier is due to take place that night. Maurice is angry with Sam, who evidently does this sort of thing all the time, for disrupting the plan.|$|E

25|$|On May 13, 2009, Pakistan's {{ambassador}} to the United States Husain Haqqani revealed on The Daily Show to Jon Stewart that Pakistan's decision to strike a peace deal with Taliban militants earlier, which effectively ceded control of large swathes of the country's northwest, was <b>all</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cunning plan to fool the Taliban, which is now coming to fruition with the commencement of Operation Black Thunderstorm. The ambassador mentioned to Jon Stewart that President Asif Ali Zardari's signing of the Nizam-e-Adl Regulation, which was the Swat peace deal, {{was nothing more than}} a trick to lure the Taliban from the mountains and countryside to the main towns where it would be much easier for the Pakistani military to kill or capture them.|$|E
25|$|Whilst the {{passenger}} terminal remained an important transport hub {{in the decades}} subsequent to its completion, decline in cruise ship travel in the early 1980s meant that by 1983, the Overseas Passenger Terminal structure lay virtually empty and was derelict. As a result of this, the New South Wales Department of Public Works launched an ideas competition for the revitalisation and renovation of the terminal building. Eventually won by the conceptual work of Peter Tonkin (now of Tonkin Zulaikha Greer Architects), the project opened up the site to retail and restaurant opportunities, transforming {{the function of the}} terminal from purely infrastructure to a public place of meeting and entertainment. Introduction of these retail spaces, along with the opening of a new southern forecourt bounded by the bounding and surrounding heritage items were <b>all</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> re-imagining and transformation of the Circular Quay West precinct from an infrastructural and commercial transport hub into a public waterfront promenade. These major renovations including the structural re-cladding and partial demolition were made by Tonkin in collaboration with prominent Australian architect Lawrence Nield and completed in 1988 for the Australian Bicentenary.|$|E
25|$|Before Joseph can confront Michael, however, he is {{kidnapped by}} Pighead and is {{forced into a}} vise-trap which Michael must save him from. Joseph leaves the player and Michael is led to a factory, where the next victim is. In the factory, Henry attacks Michael to silence him but Michael escapes. He next saves Carla Song, a {{hospital}} intern from the first Saw film, from an elevator trap which would rip her in half. It is revealed she was smuggling drugs from the hospital to sell illegally. Michael's last victim is Solomon Bates, the third partner of John Kramer and Art Blank. Bates altered finances and forged books to cover for a larger group of criminals. Upon being saved by Michael, Bates reveals that Henry Jacobs, Joseph Poltzer, Sarah Blalock, Carla Song, and himself were <b>all</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> large drug operation. It was also revealed that David Tapp, Michael's father, discovered this operation while chasing Jigsaw but {{was more interested in}} pursuing him rather than corrupt cops. Michael also admits to stealing his father's files on Jigsaw, and using the files to advance his reporting career. The files, in which David admitted that his raid on Jigsaw's lair was without a warrant, was used as grounds by the corrupt Henry Jacobs to fire David to cover up his drug ring.|$|E

25|$|At Final Resolution, Nash and {{his partner}} Samoa Joe lost in a title match to TNA World Tag Team Champions A.J. Styles and Tomko after Nash {{abandoned}} and seemingly betrayed Joe. Yet on the following Impact, when Joe stormed into Nash's locker room looking for a fight, Nash was actually able to persuade Joe into accepting his Machiavellian mentorship. Nash lost to Kurt Angle in a one-on-one match on Impact! with the winner qualifying for the Three Ways to Glory match at No Surrender. On the September 11 episode of Impact, prior to No Surrender, he seemingly parted ways with Joe on good terms. One month later, Nash returned at Bound for Glory IV and in a swerve, struck Joe {{in the back with}} Sting's bat, helping Sting win the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, turning heel once again in the process. On October 23, he formally joined Sting, Booker T, and Kurt Angle to create a villainous stable called The Main Event Mafia. He explained that he never forgave Joe for his scathing comments directed at his best friend Scott Hall's no-show almost a year prior, and befriending him was <b>all</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> long term plan to screw him out of the title. He then went on to defeat Joe at Turning Point. Nash, however, was removed from the card for Genesis due to a staph infection, and was replaced by Cute Kip. Nash returned on the January 29 episode of Impact! when the Main Event Mafia took over the show. On Impact! on April 23, he began an on-screen relationship with Jenna Morasca, who subsequently began acting as his valet. At Slammiversary, he was reunited with Joe and helped Angle win the World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E

For the first time, he delivered a speech in Belarusian (rather than Russian, which most people use), in which he said, [...] "We are not Russian—we are Belarusians", and later encouraged the use of Belarusian.

Their views were influenced by opposition to a number of major social and political changes that had happened in recent years: the growth of internationalism, particularly the United Nations and its programs; the introduction of social welfare provisions, particularly the various programs established by the New Deal; and government efforts to reduce inequalities in the social structure of the U.S..|$|E
500|$|Quisling was {{interested}} in science, Eastern religions and metaphysics, eventually building up a library that included the works of Spinoza, Kant, Hegel, and Schopenhauer. He kept up with developments {{in the realm of}} quantum physics, but did not keep up with more current philosophical ideas. He blended philosophy and science into a new religion he called Universism, or Universalism, which was a unified explanation of everything. His original writings stretched to a claimed two thousand pages. He rejected the basic teachings of orthodox Christianity and established a new theory of life, which he called Universism, a term borrowed from a textbook which Jan Jakob Maria de Groot had written on Chinese philosophy. De Groot's book argued that Tao, Confucianism and Buddhism were <b>all</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> world religion that De Groot called Universism. Quisling described how his philosophy [...] "...followed from the universal theory of relativity, of which the specific and general theories of relativity are special instances."
