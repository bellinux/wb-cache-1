40|$|An {{inventory}} of the <b>alien</b> plant <b>species</b> in Indone sia based on the existing references and herbarium specimens concluded that 1936 <b>alien</b> plant <b>species</b> ar e found in Indonesia which belong to 187 families. Field studies {{should be done to}} get the complete figur es of <b>alien</b> plant <b>species</b> in Indonesia. Based on the existing figures of the plant <b>species,</b> the invasive <b>alien</b> plant <b>species</b> can be iden tified, followed by studies on the assessment of losses, biology, management and their possible utilizations. <b>Alien</b> plant <b>species</b> are imported to Indonesia for cultivation, collection of the botanical garden, as experimental plants or other curiosities. Aside from plants purposely imported, there are also introduced plant propagules conta-minating imported agricultural products. These <b>alien</b> plant <b>species</b> can be beneficial or have a potential of being invasive. The <b>alien</b> cultivated <b>species</b> consisted of 67 % of the total number. More than half of the cultivated plants are ornamental plants. Some of th e species are naturalized or escaped from cultivation and become wild and invasive. Some other natura lized species, adapted well without any problems of invasion. There are 339 species or 17 % of the species r ecorded as weeds. The highest record of weeds is found in the family of Poaceae (57 species), follo wed by Asteraceae (53 species) and Cyperaceae (35 species). There are 6 families having more than 10 species of weeds: Amaranthaceae, Asteraceae, Cyperaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Poaceae, and Rubiaceae. Three families have more than 100 species: Asteraceae 162 species, Poaceae 120 species, and Papillionaceae 103 species.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was {{assessment}} of the occurrence, distribution and 	abundance of selected invasive <b>alien</b> plant <b>species</b> along the Krka river from Otočec 	to the outflow to river Sava in Krška vas.

5|$|Critical {{response}} to the Kazon was generally negative. Some reviewers praised their ability to capture Voyager and maroon its crew on a desolate planet, while others felt they were poorly developed copies of Klingons and that the second season focused too much on them. The Kazon were included on several lists ranking the worst villains in Star Trek history, and were cited {{as an example of}} the racist implications in the franchise's <b>alien</b> <b>species.</b> During her re-watching of the series, TrekToday Michelle Erica Green provided extensive criticism of the <b>alien</b> <b>species,</b> questioning the decision to feature them as the primary antagonists instead of the Vidiians, and Captain Kathryn Janeway's refusal to share technology with them. The Kazon were also poorly received by the show's cast members, who did not find them to be strong villains or compelling additions to the narrative.|$|E

40|$|Many {{invasive}} <b>alien</b> plant <b>species</b> {{are already}} distributed in paddy landscape in Japan, and they affect agricultural production and ecosystem. New management systems, which are socially and environmentally acceptable, are necessary. This study analyzed distribution patterns and impacts of <b>alien</b> plant <b>species</b> around paddy fields by using RuLIS. Findings showed three major distribution patterns of alien plants: (1) strong species, {{which appeared in}} large area coverage; (2) generalist species, which appeared in many habitats; and (2) specialist species, which appeared in specific and major habitat. A new method for post border impact assessment of <b>alien</b> plant <b>species</b> in paddy landscape (PBAApaddy) was developed based on these distribution patterns, and the method was applied to 50 species. Results suggested that PBAApaddy is an effective tool for the assessment, and Alternanthera philoxeroides was evaluated as the most invasive alien plant in Japanese paddy landscape.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the occurrence of <b>alien</b> plant <b>species</b> in Gonarezhou National Park (GNP), Zimbabwe. We focused on two main habitat types, namely riparian areas of the major rivers and dry land areas. Sampling was carried out from 42 sampling plots in both habitat types. Variables studied included the numbers of <b>alien</b> plant <b>species</b> per plot, density, frequency and diversity. A total of 15 <b>alien</b> plant <b>species</b> were identified in GNP. Our results indicate a high density of forbs and shrubs in riparian areas as compared to dry land areas. Similarly, riparian areas had higher species diversity than dry land areas. Our study represents {{the first step to}} monitor alien plants which includes the identification of <b>alien</b> plant <b>species</b> and basic information on their distribution in GNP.

40|$|Predicting the {{influence}} of climate change on the potential distribution of naturalised <b>alien</b> plant <b>species</b> is an important and challenging task. While prioritisation of management actions for alien plants under current climatic conditions has been widely adopted, very few systems explicitly incorporate the potential of future changes in climate conditions to influence the distribution of <b>alien</b> plant <b>species.</b> Here, we develop an Australia-wide screening tool to assess the potential of naturalised alien plants to establish and spread under both current and future climatic conditions. The screening tool developed uses five spatially explicit criteria to establish the likelihood of alien plant population establishment and expansion under baseline climate conditions and future climates for the decades 2035 and 2065. Alien plants are then given a threat rating according to current and future threat to enable natural resource managers to focus on those species that pose the largest potential threat {{now and in the}} future. To demonstrate the screening tool, we present results for a representative sample of approximately 10 % (n = 292) of Australia's known, naturalised <b>alien</b> plant <b>species.</b> Overall, most <b>alien</b> plant <b>species</b> showed decreases in area of habitat suitability under future conditions compared to current conditions and therefore the threat rating of most <b>alien</b> plant <b>species</b> declined between current and future conditions. Use of the screening tool is intended to assist natural resource managers in assessing the threat of alien plant establishment and spread under current and future conditions and thus prioritise detailed weed risk assessments for those species that pose the greatest threat. The screening tool is associated with a searchable database for all 292 <b>alien</b> plant <b>species</b> across a range of spatial scales, available through an interactive web-based portal at [URL] page(s...|$|R
5|$|Although the prequel/sequel to Superstar Saga, the game's plot is {{completely}} unrelated {{to that of}} its predecessor with more emphasis on the time-traveling theme, which involves the protagonists traveling in between {{the past and present}} of the Mushroom Kingdom. The adventure follows Mario, Baby Mario, Luigi, and Baby Luigi while they search for Princess Peach, who has been abducted by an <b>alien</b> <b>species</b> only known as the Shroobs. The gameplay centers on the co-operation between the quartet, who must use their specific qualities and skills to solve puzzles to progress through and features multiple role-playing game elements, but with a turn-based battle system focused on timing accuracy. The game is considerably darker in tone than its predecessor, especially in its plot and themes.|$|E
5|$|Habitats {{change over}} time. This {{may be due}} to a violent event such as the {{eruption}} of a volcano, an earthquake, a tsunami, a wildfire or a change in oceanic currents; or the change may be more gradual over millennia with alterations in the climate, as ice sheets and glaciers advance and retreat, and as different weather patterns bring changes of precipitation and solar radiation. Other changes come {{as a direct result of}} human activities; deforestation, the ploughing of ancient grasslands, the diversion and damming of rivers, the draining of marshland and the dredging of the seabed. The introduction of <b>alien</b> <b>species</b> can have a devastating effect on native wildlife, through increased predation, through competition for resources or through the introduction of pests and diseases to which the native species have no immunity.|$|E
