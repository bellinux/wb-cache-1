40|$|The Philadelphia (Ph) {{chromosome}} breakpoints {{in chronic}} myelocytic leukaemia are clustered on chromosome 22 band q 11 in a 5. 8 -kilobase (kb) region designated bcr. The c-abl protooncogene is translocated from chromosome 9 band q 34 into bcr and the biochemical {{consequence of this}} molecular rearrangement is the production of an abnormal fusion protein bcr-abl p 210 with enhanced protein-tyrosine kinase activity compared to the normal p 145 c-abl protein. The Ph chromosome translocation is also seen in some <b>acute</b> <b>lymphoblastic</b> <b>leukaemias</b> with B-cell precursor phenotypes {{some of which have}} bcr rearrangement (bcr +) and some do not (bcr -). We present evidence that the Ph +, bcr - leukaemias are associated with a novel p 190 abl kinase. We propose that <b>acute</b> <b>lymphoblastic</b> <b>leukaemias</b> that are bcr +, p 210 + are probably lymphoid blast crises following a clinically silent chronic phase of chronic myelocytic leukaemia arising in multipotential stem cells whereas bcr -, p 190 + cases are de novo <b>acute</b> <b>lymphoblastic</b> <b>leukaemias</b> arising in more restricted precursors. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

25|$|In 1965, a major {{breakthrough}} in cancer therapy occurred. James F. Holland, Emil Freireich, and Emil Frei hypothesized that cancer chemotherapy should follow the strategy of antibiotic therapy for tuberculosis with combinations of drugs, each with a different mechanism of action. Cancer cells could conceivably mutate to become resistant to a single agent, but by using different drugs concurrently {{it would be more}} difficult for the tumor to develop resistance to the combination. Holland, Freireich, and Frei simultaneously administered methotrexate (an antifolate), vincristine (a Vinca alkaloid), 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and prednisone — together referred to as the POMP regimen — and induced long-term remissions in children with <b>acute</b> <b>lymphoblastic</b> <b>leukaemia</b> (ALL). With incremental refinements of original regimens, using randomized clinical studies by St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, the Medical Research Council in the UK (UKALL protocols) and German Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster clinical trials group (ALL-BFM protocols), ALL in children has become a largely curable disease.|$|E

40|$|It is {{suggested}} that most childhood <b>acute</b> <b>lymphoblastic</b> <b>leukaemias</b> and some other paediatric cancers are chemo-curable because they arise in stem cell populations that are functionally transient, chemosensitive and programmed for apoptosis.

40|$|This case {{discusses}} a 10 {{year old}} female {{patient with a}} late relapse of Ph-chromosome positive B-cell precursor <b>acute</b> <b>lymphoblastic</b> <b>leukaemias</b> (ALL) who had previously been treated with chemotherapy and allogeneic stem-cell transplantation. Treatment for relapse consisted of single-agent dasatinib, followed by 2 blocks {{of a combination of}} dasa-tinib and clofarabine as consolidation thera-py. Using this schedule both morphological and cytogenetic complete remission were obtained. This regimen was well tolerated, and no major toxicity concerns occurred. Subsequently, the patient received a 2 nd stem cell transplantation from a matched unrelat-ed donor. Unfortuna tely, the child died after complete molecular remission at day + 104 post-transplantation, due to a disseminated adenoviral infection. We conclude that dasa-tinib and clofarabine combination therapy was safe and effective in this patient, and should be further explored as a salvage regi-men in relapsed/refractory Philadelphia chro-mosome positive ALL patients...|$|R
40|$|Clonal rearrangements of {{immunoglobulin}} {{heavy chain}} genes {{as well as}} both T cell receptor (TCR) delta and gamma genes were found in four cases of blast crisis of Ph+ chronic myeloid leukaemia with unequivocal B cell precursor (common) immunophenotype.

Although the developmental sequence of TCR delta, gamma and beta rearrangements in T lymphocytes appeared to be respected, a full phenotypic effect, characteristic of T cell was not observed in these otherwise typical 'common' blast cells.

40|$|The {{development}} of the B-lymphoid cell lineage is tightly controlled by the concerted action {{of a network of}} transcriptional and epigenetic regulators. EBF 1, a central component of this network, is essential for B-lymphoid specification and commitment {{as well as for the}} maintenance of the B-cell identity. Genetic alterations causing loss of function of these B-lymphopoiesis regulators have been implicated in the pathogenesis of B-lymphoid malignancies, with particular regard to B-cell <b>acute</b> <b>lymphoblastic</b> <b>leukaemias</b> (B-ALLs), where their presence is frequently detected. The activity of the B-cell regulatory network may also be disrupted by the aberrant expression of inhibitory molecules. In particular, two multi-zinc finger transcription cofactors named ZNF 423 and ZNF 521 have been characterised as potent inhibitors of EBF 1 and are emerging as potentially relevant contributors to the {{development of}} B-cell leukaemias.

40|$|Chromosomal translocations {{involving}} the Mixed-Lineage Leukaemia (MLL) gene underlie many human leukaemias and MLL rearrangements {{are found in}} both acute myelogenous and <b>acute</b> <b>lymphoblastic</b> <b>leukaemias.</b> To assess the functionally relevant haematopoietic cell contexts for MLL fusions to be tumorigenic, we have generated different lines of mice in which de novo Mll-associated translocations occur. In these models, reciprocal chromosomal translocations occur by means of Cre-loxP-mediated recombination (translocator mice) in different cells of the haematopoietic system (namely haematopoietic stem cells, semi-committed progenitors or committed T or B cells). Translocations between Mll and Enl cause myeloid neoplasias, initiating in stem cells or progenitors while no tumours arose when the translocation was restricted to the B-cell compartment. Despite the absence of tumorigenesis, Mll-Enl translocations did occur and Mll-Enl fusion mRNA was expressed in B-cell-restricted translocators. A permissive cellular environment is therefore required for oncogenicity of Mll-associated translocations since the occurrence of Mll-Enl does not promote unrestricted proliferation in all haematopoietic cellular contexts, consistent with a specific instructive role of the MLL-fusion proteins in leukaemogenesis...|$|R

40|$|To {{determine}} {{the incidence of}} homozygous deletions of the newly identified tumour suppressor gene, CDK 4 I, molecular genomic DNA analyses by PCR technique were performed on primary neoplastic cells from 22 childhood acute leukaemias obtained at presentation. The blast cells derived in all the analysed cases from bone marrow. We found that none of acute myeloblastic leukaemias (four cases) showed the CDK 4 I alteration, whereas 6 / 13 (46 %) common <b>acute</b> <b>lymphoblastic</b> <b>leukaemias</b> (ALLs) displayed homozygous deletions. Moreover, and even more important, all the blasts purified from ALLs derived from early lymphoid precursors (three early-T ALLs and two pre-B ALLs) showed the absence of CDK 4 I gene. When the entire coding sequence of the CDK 4 I gene from samples without homozygous deletions was analysed by the single-strand conformational polymorphism method, no point mutations were identified. These results demonstrate that CDK 4 I gene deletions are very frequent and probably early events in childhood acute leukaemias of lymphoid origin and especially in early-T and pre-B ALLs. Moreover, the molecular mechanism {{of the loss of}} function of the gene is correlated, at least in childhood ALLs, almost exclusively to deletions and not to point mutations...|$|R
40|$|The FMS {{proto-oncogene}} encodes a polypeptide {{growth factor}} receptor expressed {{on the cell}} surface of monocytes and B lymphocytes within the haematological system. Mutations of the FMS gene at codons 301 and 969 have been detected {{in a number of}} haematological disorders. Mutations at these codons are thought to be important in the pathogenesis of leukaemia in cells expressing a mutant receptor. Following our finding that the colony stimulating factor- 1 receptor (CSF- 1 R) was expressed on B cells, we have assessed DNA from 17 patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), 15 with <b>acute</b> <b>lymphoblastic</b> <b>leukaemias</b> (ALL), two samples from patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (B-NHL), and 20 haematologically normal individuals for the presence of C-terminal mutations of the FMS gene. Using single stranded conformational polymorphism analysis (SSCP), a single band shift was detected resulting from a nucleotide insertion at codon 965 in the DNA isolated from a patient with B-NHL. These results indicate that mutations of the FMS gene in this region are rare in B-cell malignancy but may contribute to the pathogenesis of leukaemias and lymphomas in a small subset of patients. However, the presence of other mutations not detected using this type of analysis cannot be excluded...|$|R
