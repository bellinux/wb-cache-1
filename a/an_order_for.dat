5|$|A {{country that}} had been {{reported}} to be a likely early export customer for the modernized Su-35 was Venezuela. The Venezuelan government of Hugo Chavez in July 2006 placed <b>an</b> <b>order</b> <b>for</b> 24 Su-30MK2s to replace its fleet of F-16s that were subjected to a US arms embargo. The aircraft were delivered to the Venezuelan Air Force from 2006 to 2008. The country was expected to follow up with a second order for the same type, or make a purchase of the Su-35. Despite subsequent reports that the Venezuelan government were interested in the aircraft and had placed <b>an</b> <b>order</b> <b>for</b> the Su-35, the country was negotiating with Russia in 2016 for the Su-30 aircraft instead.|$|E
5|$|<b>An</b> <b>order</b> <b>for</b> {{review of}} {{detention}} directs someone holding {{a person in}} detention to produce the detainee before the High Court so that {{the legality of the}} detention can be established. The power of the Court to require that this be done is specifically mentioned in Article 9(2) of the Constitution of Singapore. While the other prerogative orders may only be applied for with the court's permission, <b>an</b> <b>order</b> <b>for</b> review of detention may be applied for without prior permission from the court.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{termination}} of the P.1154, the RAF then began studying a straightforward upgrade of the Kestrel as a production aircraft; accordingly, it issued Requirement ASR 384, which sought a V/STOL ground attack jet, known as the P.1127 (RAF). In late 1965, the RAF placed <b>an</b> <b>order</b> <b>for</b> six pre-production P.1127 (RAF) aircraft. On 31 August 1966, {{the first of these}} P.1127 (RAF) aircraft made its maiden flight. In early 1967, <b>an</b> <b>order</b> <b>for</b> 60 production aircraft was formally received by Hawker Aviation; at this time the aircraft received the Harrier GR.1 designation. The Harrier {{went on to become a}} successful aircraft in British service, and was exported to several nations, often seeing usage as a carrier-based aircraft.|$|E

5|$|The {{procedure}} for applying for <b>an</b> <b>order</b> <b>for</b> review of detention {{differs from that}} for obtaining a mandatory order, prohibiting order or quashing order because the latter orders are only available by leave of court, whereas <b>an</b> <b>order</b> <b>for</b> review of detention may be applied for without prior permission from the court. The {{procedure for}} doing so is set out in Order 54 of the Rules of Court. An application {{must be made to}} the High Court by way of an ex parte originating summons, supported, if possible, by an affidavit from the person being restrained which shows that the application is being made at his or her instance and explaining the nature of the restraint. If the person under restraint is unable to personally make an affidavit, someone may do so on his or her behalf, explaining the reason for the inability.|$|E
5|$|A MaK-built DB Class 240 {{locomotive}} was test-run in Norway during 1990. On 23 November 1992, NSB's board {{decided to}} order ten similar units. The order was later expanded with another two units because NSB {{was offered a}} lower price than originally stipulated. The Di6 would have motors from Siemens, who had bought MaK, and would be optimized for Norwegian conditions and standards. The contract was worth NOK380 million, or NOK32 million per unit. At the same time, NSB also made <b>an</b> <b>order</b> <b>for</b> 20 smaller diesel-electric locomotives from MaK, the Di8. Between the two new classes, they were to replace all the Di3s.|$|E
5000|$|A {{basis is}} just a linearly {{independent}} set of vectors with or without <b>a</b> given <b>ordering.</b> <b>For</b> many purposes it is convenient to work with <b>an</b> <b>ordered</b> basis. <b>For</b> example, when working with a coordinate representation of a vector it is customary {{to speak of the}} [...] "first" [...] or [...] "second" [...] coordinate, which makes sense only if <b>an</b> <b>ordering</b> is specified <b>for</b> the basis. For finite-dimensional vector spaces one typically indexes a basis {vi} by the first n integers. An ordered basis is also called a frame.|$|R

5|$|After {{basic design}} work was {{completed}} on the Tu-4 bomber, Tupolev decided {{to design a}} passenger variant with a pressurized fuselage, given the internal designation of Tu-70. It was intended to use as many Tu-4 components as possible to reduce cost and save development time. It was a low-wing, cantilever monoplane with tricycle landing gear, powered by four Shvetsov ASh-73TK radial engines. Design work on a mockup began in February 1946 and the Council of Ministers confirmed <b>an</b> <b>order</b> <b>for</b> a single prototype the following month. A production decision for the Tu-12, {{as it was to}} be known, would be made after testing.|$|E

When the government removed them from their homes in 1942, it housed them temporarily in the Livestock Exposition Center (Expo Center) in Kenton before sending them to internment camps further inland. They were not allowed to return until 1945.|$|E

5|$|Captain Samuel Walker of the Texas Rangers had {{acquired}} {{some of the}} first Colt revolvers produced during the Seminole War and saw first-hand their effective use as his 15-man unit defeated a larger force of 70 Comanche in Texas. Walker wanted to order Colt revolvers for use by the Rangers in the Mexican-American War, and traveled to New York City in search of Colt. He met Colt in a gunsmith's shop on January 4, 1847, and placed <b>an</b> <b>order</b> <b>for</b> 1,000 revolvers. Walker asked for a few changes; the new revolvers would have to hold 6 shots instead of 5, have enough power to kill either a man or a horse with a single shot and be quicker to reload. The large order allowed Colt to establish a new firearm business. Colt hired Eli Whitney Blake, who was established in the arms business, to make his guns. Colt used his prototype and Walker's improvements as the basis for a new design. From this new design, Blake produced the first thousand-piece order known as the Colt Walker. The company then received <b>an</b> <b>order</b> <b>for</b> a thousand more; Colt took a share of the profits at $10 per pistol for both orders.|$|E
5|$|Convair's {{proposal}} gained <b>an</b> <b>order</b> <b>for</b> two prototypes in late 1951. Twelve {{production aircraft}} were ordered before a prototype had even flown. No armament was ever fitted to any Sea Dart built, {{but the plan}} was to arm the production aircraft with four 20mm Colt Mk12 cannon and a battery of folding-fin unguided rockets. Four of this order were redesignated as service test vehicles, and an additional eight production aircraft were soon ordered as well.|$|E
5|$|During {{and after}} the debates over church government, the Assembly framed other {{documents}} which did not cause open rifts. The Directory for Public Worship, which was to replace the Book of Common Prayer, was swiftly written in 1644 and passed by Parliament on 3January 1645. The Directory, accepted by the Scots as well, took a middle course between the presbyterians and congregationalists. The presbyterians {{for the most part}} preferred a fixed liturgy while congregationalists favoured extemporaneous prayer. The Directory consisted of <b>an</b> <b>order</b> <b>for</b> services with sample prayers. The Assembly also recommended a psalter, translated by Francis Rous for use in worship.|$|E
