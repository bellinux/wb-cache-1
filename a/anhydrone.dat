5000|$|It is {{sold under}} the trade name <b>anhydrone.</b> Manufacture of this product on a semi-industrial scale was first {{performed}} by G. Frederick Smith {{in his garage}} in Urbana Illinois, but later at a permanent facility in Columbus, OH called G. Frederick Smith Chemical Co. He sold the magnesium perchlorate to A. H. Thomas Co., now Thomas Scientific, under the trade name Dehydrite.|$|E
30|$|Total {{organic carbon}} (TOC) {{includes}} biodegradable sugars, protein, and fat {{content of a}} material but does not include inorganic carbonate fractions such as calcium and magnesium carbonates. The TOC of milk dust powder was measured {{in accordance with the}} TMECC method 04.01 -A (2002), using a carbon analyzer (Model Vario MAX CN, Elementar Americas). Samples were briefly subjected to combustion in an oxygen-rich atmosphere in a resistance furnace at 1, 370 Â°C. The CO 2 produced was passed through an oxygen stream in <b>anhydrone</b> tubes to scrub water vapor out of the stream. The dehydrated CO 2 stream was then channeled into an infrared detector, which generates a signal proportionate to the amount of CO 2 detected. The resulting values are reported as percentage of TOC content (dry wt., w/w) in dried samples.|$|E
40|$|The Bureau of Mines Helium Field Operations has {{developed}} a method for determining the helium- 3 CHe) content of natural gas and mixtures eontaining 0. 5 % to 100 % helium. The helium is preconcentrated by passing samples through <b>anhydrone,</b> a liquid-nitrogen-cooled chareoal trap, and a titanium absorption trap. The mass spectrometer {{used to analyze the}} samples is tuned to 3 He at mle ::=; 3. 016. Hydrogen deuteride (HD+) interference is minimized by the titanium absorption trap and high instrument resolution. Sample measurements are compared with identically made measurements of a gravimetrically prepared primary standard. The method has a limit of detection of 0. 15 ppb with a relative deviation of 13 % below the 1 ~ppb level. The relative deviation is less than 7 % for gases eontaining over 100 ppb 3 He. The helium isotope ratios of natural gases from the Bureau's Tuck-Trigg Dome Red Cave, the Bush Dome Red Cave, and the Bush Dome Brown Dolomite Formations are distinguishable from one another and from the isotope ratio of crude helium produced from the Panhandle-Hugoton Gasfield...|$|E
