In addition, inhibition of the activity of histone deacetylases 4 (HDAC 4) has been shown to strongly reduce HSC activation in the context of liver fibrosis. In this study, we examined whether miR- 29 a was involved in the regulation of HDAC 4 and modulation of the profibrogenic phenotype in HSCs. We employed miR- 29 a transgenic mice (miR- 29 aTg mice) and wild-type littermates to clarify the role of miR- 29 a in cholestatic liver fibrosis, using the bile duct-ligation (BDL) mouse model. Primary HSCs from both mice were treated with a miR- 29 a mimic and <b>antisense</b> <b>inhibitor</b> in order to analyze changes in profibrogenic gene expression and HSC activation using real-time quantitative RT-PCR, immunofluorescence staining, western blotting, and cell proliferation and migration assays. After BDL, overexpression of miR- 29 a decreased collagen- 1 α 1, HDAC 4 and activated HSC markers of glial fibrillary acidic protein expression in miR- 29 aTg mice compared to wild-type littermates. Overexpression of miR- 29 a and HDAC 4 RNA-interference decreased the expression of fibrotic genes, HDAC 4 signaling, and HSC migration and proliferation. In contrast, knockdown of miR- 29 a with an <b>antisense</b> <b>inhibitor</b> increased HDAC 4 function, restored HSC migration, and accelerated HSC proliferation. Our results indicate that miR- 29 a ameliorates cholestatic liver fibrosis after BDL, at least partially, by modulating the profibrogenic phenotype of HSCs through inhibition of HDAC 4 function...|$|E

MBD 2 is an attractive anticancer target since MBD 2 -deficient mice were previously shown to be viable and fertile and knockdown of MBD 2 {{was reported to have}} no effect on cellular growth parameters of non-transformed cells. In this paper we test the hypothesis that pharmacological inhibition of MBD 2 inhibits cancer growth in vivo using human tumour lines implanted in mice as a model.

Incorporation of a single mismatch into the sequence of ISIS 5132 or CGP 69846 A resulted in reduced hybridization affinity toward C-raf RNA sequences and reduced inhibitory activity against C-raf expression in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Moreover, incorporation of additional mismatches resulted in further loss of in vitro and in vivo activity {{in a manner that}} correlated well with a hybridization-based (i. e., antisense) mechanism of action.

40|$|Introduction: Clusterin (CLU) is a stress-activated, ATP-independent {{molecular}} chaperone, normally secreted from cells, that is up-regulated in Alzheimer {{disease and}} in many cancers. It plays important roles in protein homeostasis/proteostasis, inhibition of cell death pathways, and modulation of pro-survival signalling and transcriptional networks. Changes in the CLU gene locus are highly associated with Alzheimer disease, and many therapy-resistant cancers over-express CLU. The extensive post-translational processing and heterogeneous oligomerization of CLU have so far prevented any definitive structure determination. This in turn has meant that targeting CLU with small molecule inhibitors is challenging. Therefore, inhibiting CLU at the gene-expression level using siRNA or antisense is a valid approach to inhibit its function. Areas covered: This article reviews recent advances regarding the role of CLU in proteostasis, cellular trafficking, human diseases, and signalling pathways involved in oncogenesis. It addresses the rationale for CLU as a therapeutic target in cancer, and {{the current status of}} pre-clinical and clinical studies using CLU <b>antisense</b> <b>inhibitor</b> OGX 011.

40|$|Abstract Background The small non-coding microRNAs play an {{important}} role in development by regulating protein translation, but their involvement in axon guidance is unknown. Here, we investigated the role of microRNA- 134 (miR- 134) in chemotropic guidance of nerve growth cones. Results We found that miR- 134 is highly expressed in the neural tube of Xenopus embryos. Fluorescent in situ hybridization also showed that miR- 134 is enriched in the growth cones of Xenopus spinal neurons in culture. Importantly, overexpression of miR- 134 mimics or <b>antisense</b> <b>inhibitors</b> blocked protein synthesis (PS) -dependent attractive responses of Xenopus growth cones to a gradient of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). However, miR- 134 mimics or inhibitors had no effect on PS-independent bidirectional responses of Xenopus growth cones to bone morphogenic protein 7 (BMP 7). Our data further showed that Xenopus LIM kinase 1 (Xlimk 1) mRNA is a potential target of miR- 134 regulation. Conclusions These findings demonstrate a role for miR- 134 in translation-dependent guidance of nerve growth cones. Different guidance cues may act through distinct signaling pathways to elicit PS-dependent and -independent mechanisms to steer growth cones in response to a wide array of spatiotemporal cues during development. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} alter microRNA (miRNA) {{abundance}} {{is crucial for}} studying miRNA function. To achieve this there is widespread use of both exogenous double-stranded miRNA mimics for transient over-expression, and single stranded antisense RNAs (antimiRs) for miRNA inhibition. The success of these manipulations is often assessed using qPCR, {{but this does not}} accurately report the level of functional miRNA. Here, we draw attention to this discrepancy, which is overlooked in many published reports. We measured the functionality of exogenous miRNA by comparing the total level of transfected miRNA in whole cell extracts to the level of miRNA bound to Argonaute following transfection and show that the supraphysiological levels of transfected miRNA frequently seen using qPCR do not represent the functional levels, because the majority of transfected RNA that is detected is vesicular and not accessible for loading into Argonaute as functionally active miRNAs. In the case of microRNA inhibition by transient transfection with <b>antisense</b> <b>inhibitors,</b> there is also the potential for discrepancy, because following cell lysis the abundant inhibitor levels from cellular vesicles can directly interfere with the PCR reaction used to measure miRNA level.

40|$|Background: The few {{available}} distinct {{classes of}} antimicrobials limits the scope for single and combination drug treatment of resistant infections. Objective: To evaluate antimicrobial effectiveness from combinations of protein-specific drugs and mRNA-specific <b>antisense</b> <b>inhibitors.</b> Methods: Interactions between conventional antimicrobial drugs and mRNA-specific translation inhibiting antisense {{peptide nucleic acids}} were assessed in Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus cultures using pairwise combinations in a chequerboard arrangement. Fractional inhibitory concentration indices (FICIs) were calculated and grouped according to the functional relationship between the <b>inhibitor</b> targets. <b>Antisense</b> specificity controls included different antisense sequences targeting the same mRNA, as well as biochemical quantification of active protein expressed from the essential fabI gene and from the lacZ reporter gene after single and combined inhibitor treatment. Results: FICIs were higher for inhibitor combinations with unrelated targets than for combinations with functionally related targets. Inhibitor combinations with shared genetic targets displayed the lowest FICIs, with several qualifying for the conservative definition ofantimicrobial synergy (FICI –< 0. 5). Furthermore, low FICIs arise as the hyperbolic dose–response curves for each separate inhibitor are maintained in com-bination.

We describe the specific down regulation of cell surface associated CD 40 protein expression by use of a peptide nucleic acid (PNA) <b>antisense</b> <b>inhibitor,</b> ISIS 208529, that is designed to bind to the 3 ′ end of the exon 6 splice junction within the primary CD 40 transcript. Binding of ISIS 208529 was found to alter constitutive splicing, leading to the accumulation of a transcript lacking exon 6. The resulting protein product lacks the transmembrane domain. ISIS 208529 -mediated CD 40 protein depletion was found to be sequence specific and dose dependent, and was dependent on the length of the PNA oligomer. CD 40 -dependent induction of IL- 12 in primary murine macrophages was attenuated in cells treated with ISIS 208529. Oligolysine conjugation to the PNA inhibitor produced an inhibitor, ISIS 278647, which maintained its specificity and displayed efficacy in BCL 1 cells and in primary murine macrophages in the absence of delivery agents. These results demonstrate that PNA oligomers can be effective inhibitors of CD 40 expression and hence may be useful as novel immuno-modulatory agents...|$|E

Coding sequences located upstream from the dicF-like feature in E. coli B are related to gene sieB of bacteriophage lambda, while sequences downstream of the S. flexneri elements are similar to the immunity region of satellite bacteriophage P 4. Under hybridization conditions in which only strong sequence homologies were detected in E. coli B and S. flexneri, the genomes of a large variety of microorganisms, including some gram-positive bacteria, hybridized to the dicF probe.

40|$|Abstract. The {{canonical}} Wnt {{signaling pathway}} is crucial for the regulation of bone mass in humans and for the devel-opment of osteoblasts. MicroRNAs (miRs) represent a class of non-coding RNAs, ~ 22 nucleotides in length, that regulate gene expression by targeting mRNAs for cleavage or transla-tional repression. Several previous studies have demonstrated the involvement of miRNAs in modulating gene expression in osteoblasts and regulating osteoblast differentiation. In the present study, microRNA profiling was conducted using Wnt 3 a-C 2 C 12 cells; C 2 C 12 cells were transfected with a Wnt 3 a expression plasmid to activate canonical Wnt signaling. miR‑ 34 b‑ 5 p and miR‑ 34 c were identified to be upregulated by the activation of canonical Wnt signaling in C 2 C 12 cells. Expression of mature miR- 34 b/c increased from low levels at day 0 to maximum levels at day 28 of MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cell differentiation.

Knockdown of miR 34 b/c enhanced osteocalcin mRNA expression; however, alkaline phosphatase mRNA expression and activity were decreased by miR 34 b/c inhibition. These results indicated that miR- 34 b/c regulates gene expression by targeting regulators of the osteogenic pathways and thereby contributes to osteo-blast differentiation...|$|E

FOXO 1 is a putative tumor suppressor, and the expression of this gene is dysregulated in some cancers, including prostate and endometrial cancers. However, the molecular mechanism resulting in aberrant expression of human FOXO 1 in cancer cells is poorly understood. We show here that FOXO 1 mRNA is down-regulated in breast tumor samples as compared with normal breast tissue.

We also identified functional and specific microRNA target sites in the FOXO 1 3 ′-untranslated region for miR- 27 a, miR- 96, and miR- 182, microRNAs that have previously been linked to oncogenic transformation. The three microRNAs, miR- 27 a, miR- 96 and miR- 182, were observed to be highly expressed in MCF- 7 breast cancer cells, in which the level of FOXO 1 protein is very low. <b>Antisense</b> <b>inhibitors</b> to each of these microRNAs led to a significant increase in endogenous FOXO 1 expression and to a decrease in cell number in a manner that was blocked by FOXO 1 siRNA.

40|$|Background: Low adiponectin, a well-recognized {{antidiabetic}} adipokine, {{has been}} associated with obesity-related inflammation, oxidative stress and insulin resistance. Globular adiponectin is an important regulator of the interleukin- 1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) /NFkB pathway in monocytes of obese subjects. It protects against inflammation and oxidative stress by inducing IRAK 3. microRNA (miR) - 146 b- 5 p inhibits NFkB-mediated inflammation by targeted repression of IRAK 1 and TNF receptor-associated factor- 6 (TRAF 6). Therefore, we measured the expression of miR- 146 b- 5 p in monocytes of obese subjects. Because it was low we determined the involvement of this miR in the anti-inflammatory, antioxidative and insulin signaling action of globular adiponectin. Methods: miR- 146 b- 5 p expression in monocytes of obese subjects was determined by qRT-PCR. The effect of miR- 146 b- 5 p silencing on molecular markers of inflammation, oxidative stress and insulin signaling and the association with globular adiponectin was assessed in human THP- 1 monocytes. Results: miR- 146 b- 5 p was downregulated in monocytes of obese persons. Low globular adiponectin decreased miR- 146 b- 5 p and IRAK 3 in THP- 1 monocytes, associated with increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS).

40|$|Background/Aims: Hypoxia {{is a basic}} {{pathological}} {{challenge that}} is associated with numerous cardiovascular disorders including aberrant cardiac remodeling. Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in mediating cardiac fibroblast (CF) function and cardiac fibrosis. Recent data suggested that microRNA- 101 a (miR- 101 a) exerted anti-fibrotic effects in post-infarct cardiac remodeling and improved cardiac function. This study aimed to investigate the potential relationship between hypoxia, miR- 101 a and TGF-β signaling pathway in CFs. Methods and Results: Two weeks following coronary artery occlusion in rats, the expression levels of both TGFβ 1 and TGFβRI were increased, but the expression of miR- 101 a was decreased {{at the site of the}} infarct and along its border. Cultured rat neonatal CFs treated with hypoxia were characterized by the up-regulation of TGFβ 1 and TGFβRI and the down-regulation of miR- 101 a. Delivery of miR- 101 a mimics significantly suppressed the expression of TGFβRI and p-Smad 3, CF differentiation and collagen content of CFs. These anti-fibrotic effects were abrogated by co-transfection with AMO-miR- 101 a, an <b>antisense</b> <b>inhibitor</b> of miR- 101 a. The repression of TGFβRI, a target of miR- 101 a, was validated by luciferase reporter assays targeting the 3 'UTR of TGFβRI. Additionally, we found that overexpression of miR- 101 a reversed the improved migration ability of CFs and further reduced CF proliferation caused by hypoxia. Conclusion: Our study illustrates that miR- 101 a exerts anti-fibrotic effects by targeting TGFβRI, suggesting that miR- 101 a plays a multi-faceted role in modulating TGF-β signaling pathway and cardiac fibrosis...|$|E

This report constitutes the first full study of the conformational features of a hybrid DNA-RNA duplex, which has been possible because of the unique stabilization of this rather small duplex by the tethered 3 '-Pzn moiety (Tm approximately 40 degrees C from NMR). In this study, a total of 252 inter- and intra-strand torsional and distance constraints along with the full NOE relaxation matrix, {{taking into account the}} exchange process of imino and amino protons with water, have been used. The 3 '-Pzn-promoted stabilization of the DNA-RNA hybrid duplex results in detailed local conformational characteristics such as the torsion angles of the backbone and sugar moieties that are close to the features of the other natural DNA-RNA hybrids (i. e. sugars of the RNA strand are 3 '-endo, but the sugars of the DNA strand are intermediate between A- and B-forms of DNA, 72 degrees < P < 180 degrees; note however, that the sugars of our DNA strand have a C 1 -exo conformation: 131 degrees < P < 154 degrees).

40|$|DNA methylphosphonates are {{candidate}} derivatives {{for use in}} antisense DNA therapy. Their efficacy {{is limited}} by weak hybridization. One hypothesis to explain this phenomenon holds that one configuration of the chiral methylphosphonate linkage, Rp, permits stronger base pairing than the other configuration, Sp. To test this hypothesis, four specific pairs of Rp and Sp diastereomers of the DNA methylphosphonate heptamer d(CpCpApApApCpA) were prepared by block coupling of different combinations of individual diastereomers of d(CpCpApA) and d(ApCpA). Each pair of the diastereomers of the heptamer was separated into individual diastereomes using affinity chromatography on a Lichrosorb-NH 2 silica column with a covalently attached complementary normal DNA octamer, d(pTpGpTpTpTpGpGpC). The stabilities of complementary complexes of phosphodiester d(TpGpTpTpTpGpGpC) with 8 individual diastereomers of methylphosphonate d(CpCpApApApCpA) were studied by measuring their melting temperatures (Tm). A direct correlation of Tm values {{with the number of}} Rp methylphosphonate centers in the heptamer was found: the more Rp centers, the higher the stability of the complex. Tm values for the diastereomers with 6 all-Rp or all-Sp methylphosphonate centers were found to be 30. 5 degrees and 12. 5 degrees C, respectively, in 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Na 2 HPO 4, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7. 0 with 15 microM of each oligomer. On the average, each substitution of one Rp-center to an Sp-center in the heptamer decreased the Tm by 3 degrees C. Under the same conditions, the Tm of the normal DNA heptamer with its complement was 21 degrees C. These results are consistent with the model that all-Rp methylphosphonate DNAs hybridize much more tightly to complementary normal DNA than do racemic methylphosphonate DNAs, and may therefore exhibit greater potency as <b>antisense</b> <b>inhibitors...</b>|$|R

Here we report a modified AMO approach in which multiple antisense units are engineered {{into a single}} unit that is able to simultaneously silence multiple-target miRNAs, the multiple-target AMO or MTg-AMO. We validated the technique with two separate MTg-AMOs: anti-miR- 21 /anti-miR- 155 /anti-miR- 17 - 5 p and anti-miR- 1 /anti-miR- 133. We first verified {{the ability of the}} MTg-AMOs to antagonize the repressive actions of their target miRNAs using luciferase reporter activity assays and to specifically knock down the levels of their target miRNAs using real-time RT-PCR methods. We then used the MTg-AMO approach to identify several tumor suppressors—TGFBI, APC and BCL 2 L 11 as the target genes for oncogenic miR- 21, miR- 155 and miR- 17 - 5 p, respectively, and two cardiac ion channel genes HCN 2 (encoding a subunit of cardiac pacemaker channel) and CACNA 1 C (encoding the α-subunit of cardiac L-type Ca 2 + channel) for the muscle-specific miR- 1 and miR- 133. We further demonstrated that the MTg-AMO targeting miR- 21, miR- 155 and miR- 17 - 5 p produced a greater inhibitory effect on cancer cell growth, compared with the regular single-target AMOs. Moreover, while using the regular single-target AMOs excluded HCN 2 as a target gene for either miR- 1 or miR- 133, the MTg-AMO approach is able to reveal HCN 2 as the target for both miR- 1 and miR- 133.

40|$|Phosphorothioate deoxyribonucleotides (PS-DNA) {{are among}} the most widely used <b>antisense</b> <b>inhibitors.</b> PS-DNA {{exhibits}} desirable properties such as enhanced nuclease resistance, improved bioavailability, and the ability to induce RNase H mediated degradation of target RNA. Unfortunately, PS-DNA possesses a relatively low binding affinity for target RNA that impacts on its potency in antisense applications. We recently showed that phosphodiester-linked oligonucleotides comprised of 2 ′-deoxy- 2 ′-fluoro-D-arabinonucleic acid (FANA) exhibit both high binding affinity for target RNA and the ability to elicit RNase H degradation of target RNA [Damha et al. (1998) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 120, 12976]. In the present study, we evaluated the antisense activity of phosphorothioate-linked FANA oligonucleotides (PS-FANA). Oligonucleotides comprised entirely of PS-FANA were somewhat less efficient in directing RNase H cleavage of target RNA as compared to their phosphorothioate-linked DNA counterparts, and showed only weak antisense inhibition of cellular target expression. However, mixed-backbone oligomers comprised of PS-FANA flanking a central core of PS-DNA were found to possess potent antisense activity, inhibiting specific cellular gene expression with EC 50 values of less than 5 nM. This inhibition was a true antisense effect, as indicated by the dose-dependent decrease in both target protein and target mRNA. Furthermore, the appearance of mRNA fragments was consistent with RNase H mediated cleavage of the mRNA target. We also compared a series of PS-[FANA-DNA-FANA] mixed-backbone oligomers of varying PS-DNA core sizes with the corresponding 2 ′-O-methyl oligonucleotide chimeras, i. e., PS-[2 ′meRNA-DNA- 2 ′meRNA]. Both types of oligomers showed very similar binding affinities toward target RNA. However, the antisense potency of the 2 ′-O-methyl chimeric compounds was dramatically attenuated with decreasing DNA core size, whereas that of the 2 ′-fluoroarabino compounds was essentially unaffected. Indeed, a PS-FANA oligomer containing a single deoxyribonucleotide residue core retained significant antisense activity. These findings correlated exactly with the ability of the various chimeric antisense molecules to elicit RNase H degradation of the target RNA in vitro, and suggest that this mode of inhibition is likely the most important determinant for potent antisense activity. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Recently, it was indicated that miRs act as key regulators in cell differentiation, cell growth, and cell death. In osteogenesis, several miRs (for example miR- 26 a, - 125 b, - 133, and - 135) regulate osteoblast cell growth or differentiation in human adipose tissue-derived stem cells, mouse mesenchymal ST 2 stem cells, and mouse premyogenic C 2 C 12 cells.

40|$|AbstractAntisense oligonucleotides act as {{exogenous}} inhibitors of {{gene expression}} by binding to a complementary sequence {{on the target}} mRNA, preventing translation into protein. Antisense technology is being applied successfully as a research tool and as a molecular therapeutic. However, a quantitative understanding of binding energetics between short oligonucleotides and longer mRNA targets is lacking, and selecting a high-affinity antisense oligonucleotide sequence from the many possibilities complementary to a particular RNA is a critical step in designing an effective <b>antisense</b> <b>inhibitor.</b> Here, we report measurements of the thermodynamics and kinetics of hybridization {{for a number of}} oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) complementary to the rabbit β-globin (RBG) mRNA using a binding assay that facilitates rapid separation of bound from free species in solution. A wide range of equilibrium dissociation constants were observed, and association rate constants within the measurable range correlated strongly with binding affinity. In addition, a significant correlation was observed of measured binding affinities with binding affinity values predicted using a thermodynamic model involving DNA and RNA unfolding, ODN hybridization, and RNA restructuring to a final free energy minimum. In contrast to the behavior observed for hybridization of short strands, the association rate constant increased with temperature, suggesting that the kinetics of association are related to disrupting the native structure of the target RNA. The rate of cleavage of the RBG mRNA in the presence of ribonuclease H and ODNs of varying association kinetics displayed apparent first-order kinetics, with the rate constant exhibiting binding-limited behavior at low association rates and reaction-limited behavior at higher rates. Implications for the rational design of effective antisense reagents are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Two core microRNA (miRNA) pathway proteins, Dicer and Argonaute, {{are found}} in Giardia lamblia, a deeply {{branching}} parasitic protozoan. There are, however, no apparent homologues of Drosha or Exportin 5 in the genome. Here, we report a 26 nucleotide (nt) RNA derived from a 106 nt Box C/D snoRNA, GlsR 2. This small RNA, designated miR 5, localizes to the 3 ' end of GlsR 2 and has a 75 nt hairpin precursor. GlsR 2 is processed by the Dicer from Giardia (GlDcr) and generated miR 5. Immunoprecipitation of the Argonaute from Giardia (GlAgo) brought down miR 5. When a Renilla Luciferase transcript with a 26 nt miR 5 antisense sequence at the 3 '-untranslated region (3 ' UTR) was introduced into Giardia trophozoites, Luciferase expression was reduced ∼ 25 % when synthetic miR 5 was also introduced. The Luciferase mRNA level remained, however, unchanged, suggesting translation repression by miR 5. This inhibition was fully reversed by introducing also a 2 '-O-methylated <b>antisense</b> <b>inhibitor</b> of miR 5, suggesting that miR 5 acts by interacting specifically with the antisense sequence in the mRNA. A partial antisense knock down of GlDcr or GlAgo in Giardia indicated that the former is needed for miR 5 biogenesis whereas the latter is required for miR 5 -mediated translational repression. Potential targets for miR 5 with canonical seed sequences were predicted bioinformatically near the stop codon of Giardia mRNAs. Four out of the 21 most likely targets were tested in the Luciferase reporter assay. miR 5 was found to inhibit Luciferase expression (∼ 20 %) of transcripts carrying these potential target sites, indicating that snoRNA-derived miRNA can regulate the expression of multiple genes in Giardia...|$|E

Recently an aptameric G-quartet inhibitory effect of PS oligos has been demonstrated. To determine whether PS oligos manifest non-G-quartet, non-sequence-specific effects on human aortic SMC, {{we examined the}} effects of S-dC 28, a 28 -mer phosphorothioate cytidine homopolymer, on SMC proliferation induced by several SMC mitogens. S-dC 28 significantly inhibited SMC proliferation induced by 10 % FBS as well as the mitogens PDGF, bFGF, and EGF without cytotoxicity. Moreover, S-dC 28 abrogated PDGF-induced in vitro migration in a modified micro-Boyden chamber. Furthermore, S-dC 28 manifested in vivo antiproliferative effects in the rat carotid balloon injury model. S-dC 28 suppressed neointimal cross-sectional area by 73 % and the intima/media area ratio by 59 %. Therefore, PS oligos exert potent non-G-quartet, non-sequence-specific effects on in vitro SMC proliferation and migration as well as in vivo neointimal formation...|$|R
40|$|Because of the {{importance}} of macrophages in the pathogenesis of the disease caused by HIV, we investigated the efficacy of various anti-HIV drugs in human primary macrophages acutely or chronically infected by this virus. The results obtained for acutely infected macrophages show that dideoxynucleosides (AZT, ddI, and ddC), interferon-alpha and -gamma, mismatched double-stranded RNA, Tat <b>inhibitor,</b> phosphorothioate <b>antisense,</b> and <b>inhibitors</b> of HIV protease, all significantly inhibit virus replication at concentrations far below those toxic for the cells. However, in macrophages in which proviral DNA is already integrated (chronically infected macrophages), only the three inhibitors of HIV protease induced significant virus inhibition at concentrations 100 or more times higher than those effective in acutely infected macrophages. Treatment of macrophages with macrophage colony-stimulating factor does not affect the anti-HIV efficacy of protease inhibitors. These results suggest that therapeutic strategies with activity for macrophages, including inhibitors of HIV protease, are worth pursuing in patients with HIV infection...|$|R

Mutations in PCSK 9 have been identified in familial autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia pa-tients, and gain-of-function mutations increase LDL chol-esterol concentration [1, 2]. The major molecular function of PCSK 9 in LDL cholesterol and lipid homeostasis is deg-radation of the LDL receptor (LDLR), VLDL receptor (VLDLR) and LDLR-related protein 8 (LRP 8) [3 - 5]. In addition, several studies in mice and non-human primates have shown that PCSK 9 is involved in HDL metabolism. Pcsk 9 KO male mice on a B 6 background fed a chow diet exhibited a 30 % reduction in HDL cholesterol concentra-tion [6].

40|$|The {{interaction}} between chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR 4) and its ligand, stromal cell-derived factor (SDF) - 1, {{plays an important}} role in stem cell mobilization and migration in ischemic tissues. MicroRNAs (miRs) are key regulators of stem cell function and are involved in regulation of stem cell survival and differentiation to adopt different cell lineages. In this study, we show that ischemia inhibits the expression of miR- 150 in BM-derived mononuclear cells (MNC) and activates its target Cxcr 4 gene. Our results show that miR- 150 /CXCR 4 cascade enhances MNC mobilization and migration. By using mouse acute myocardial infarction (MI) model, we found that MNCs in peripheral blood (PB) were increased significantly at day 5 after AMI as compared to control group and the number of CXCR 4 positive MNCs both in bone marrow (BM) and PB was also markedly increased after MI. Analysis by microarray-based miRNA profiling and real-time PCR revealed that the expression of miR- 150 which targets Cxcr 4 gene as predicted was significantly downregulated in BM-MNCs after MI. Abrogation of miR- 150 markedly increased CXCR 4 protein expression suggesting its target gene. To show that miR- 150 regulates MNC mobilization, knockdown of miR- 150 in BM-MNCs by specific <b>antisense</b> <b>inhibitor</b> resulted in their higher migration ability in vitro as compared to scramble-transfected MNCs. Furthermore, in vivo BM transplantation of MNCs lacking miR- 150 expression by lentiviral vector into the irradiated wild type mice resulted in the increased number of MNCs in PB after AMI as compared to control. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that ischemia mobilizes BM stem cells vi...|$|E
40|$|MicroRNA- 29 (miR- 29) {{is found}} to {{modulate}} hepatic stellate cells’ (HSCs) activation and, thereby, reduces liver fibrosis pathogenesis. Histone methyltransferase regulation of epigenetic reactions reportedly participates in hepatic fibrosis. This study is undertaken to investigate the miR- 29 a regulation of the methyltransferase signaling and epigenetic program in hepatic fibrosis progression. miR- 29 a transgenic mice (miR- 29 aTg mice) and wild-type littermates were subjected to bile duct-ligation (BDL) to develop cholestatic liver fibrosis. Primary HSCs were transfected with a miR- 29 a mimic and <b>antisense</b> <b>inhibitor.</b> Profibrogenic gene expression, histone methyltransferases and global genetic methylation were probed with real-time quantitative RT-PCR, immunohistochemical stain, Western blot and ELISA. Hepatic tissue in miR- 29 aTg mice displayed weak fibrotic matrix as evidenced by Sirius Red staining concomitant with low fibrotic matrix collagen 1 α 1 expression within affected tissues compared to the wild-type mice. miR- 29 a overexpression reduced the BDL exaggeration of methyltransferases, DNMT 1, DNMT 3 b and SET domain containing 1 A (SET 1 A) expression. It also elevated phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) signaling within liver tissue. In vitro, miR- 29 a mimic transfection lowered collagen 1 α 1, DNMT 1, DNMT 3 b and SET 1 A expression in HSCs. Gain of miR- 29 a signaling resulted in DNA hypomethylation and high PTEN expression. This study shines a new light on miR- 29 a inhibition of methyltransferase, a protective effect to maintain the DNA hypomethylation state that decreases fibrogenic activities in HSC. These robust analyses also highlight the miR- 29 a regulation of epigenetic actions to ameliorate excessive fibrosis during cholestatic liver fibrosis development...|$|E
40|$|A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation {{study was}} {{conducted}} to examine the,efficacy and safety of mipomersen (ISIS 301012), an <b>antisense</b> <b>inhibitor</b> of apolipoprotein B, when added to conventional lipid-lowering therapy for patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. A total of 44 patients were enrolled and were separated into 4 cohorts, with doses ranging from 50 to 300 mg (4 : 1 active treatment/placebo ratio). Patients received 8 doses subcutaneously during a 6 -week treatment period. Patients assigned to the 300 -mg dose continued for an additional 7 weeks with once-per-week dosing. The primary efficacy end point was the percentage of change from baseline to week 7 in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Safety was assessed using the laboratory test results and according to the incidence, severity, and relation of adverse events to drug dose. Mipomersen produced significant reductions in LDL cholesterol and other atherogenic apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins. After 6 weeks of treatment, the LDL cholesterol level was reduced by 21 % from baseline in the 200 -mg/week dose group (p < 0. 05) and 34 % from baseline in the 300 -mg/week dose group (p < 0. 01), with a concomitant reduction in apolipoprotein B of 23 % (p < 0. 05) and 33 % (p < 0. 01), respectively. Injection site reactions were the most common adverse event. Elevations in liver transaminase levels times the upper limit of normal) occurred in 4 (11 %) of 36 patients assigned to active treatment; 3 of these patients were in the highest dose group. In conclusion, mipomersen has an incremental LDL cholesterol lowering effect when added to conventional lipid-lowering therapy. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

40|$|Background Temporal lobe {{epilepsy}} is {{a common}} and frequently intractable seizure disorder. Its pathogenesis is thought to involve large-scale alterations to the expression of genes controlling neurotransmitter signalling, ion channels, synaptic structure, neuronal death, gliosis, and inflammation. Identification of mechanisms coordinating gene networks in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy will help to identify novel therapeutic targets and biomarkers. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of small non-coding RNAs that control the expression levels of multiple proteins by decreasing mRNA stability and translation, and could therefore be key regulatory mechanisms and therapeutic targets in epilepsy. Recent developments In the past 5 years, studies have found changes in miRNA levels in the hippocampus of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy and in neural tissues from animal models of epilepsy. Early functional studies showed that silencing of brain-specific miR- 134 using antisense oligonucleotides (antagomirs) had potent antiseizure effects in animal models, whereas genetic deletion of miR- 128 produced fatal epilepsy in mice. Levels of certain miRNAs were also found to be altered in the blood of rodents after seizures. In the past 18 months, functional studies have identified nine novel miRNAs that appear to influence seizures or hippocampal pathology. Their targets include transcription factors, neurotransmitter signalling components, and modulators of neuroinflammation. New approaches to manipulate miRNAs have been tested, including injection of mimics (agomirs) to enhance brain levels of miRNAs. Altered miRNA expression has also been reported in other types of refractory epilepsy and our understanding of how miRNA levels are controlled has grown, with studies on DNA methylation indicating epigenetic regulation. Biofluids (blood) of patients with epilepsy have shown differences in quantity of circulating miRNAs, implying diagnostic biomarker potential. Where next? Recent functional studies need to be replicated to build a robust evidence base. The specific cell types in which miRNAs execute their functions and their primary targets have to be identified, to fully explain the phenotypic effects of modulating miRNAs. Delivery of large molecules such as <b>antisense</b> <b>inhibitors</b> or mimics to the brain poses a challenge, and the multi-targeting effects of miRNAs create additional risks of unanticipated side effects. Potential genetic variation in miRNAs should be explored as the basis for disease susceptibility. The latest findings provide a rich source of new miRNA targets, but substantial challenges remain before their role in the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of epilepsy can be translated into clinical practice...|$|R
40|$|Effective therapies for the {{treatment}} of obesity, a key element of metabolic syndrome, are urgently needed but currently lacking. Stearoyl-CoA desaturase– 1 (SCD 1) is the rate-limiting enzyme catalyzing the conversion of saturated long-chain fatty acids into monounsaturated fatty acids, which are major components of triglycerides. In the current study, we tested the efficacy of pharmacological inhibition of SCD 1 in controlling lipogenesis and body weight in mice. SCD 1 -specific <b>antisense</b> oligonucleotide <b>inhibitors</b> (ASOs) reduced SCD 1 expression, reduced fatty acid synthesis and secretion, and increased fatty acid oxidization in primary mouse hepatocytes. Treatment of mice with SCD 1 ASOs resulted in prevention of diet-induced obesity with concomitant reductions in SCD 1 expression and the ratio of oleate to stearoyl-CoA in tissues and plasma. These changes correlated with reduced body adiposity, hepatomegaly and steatosis, and postprandial plasma insulin and glucose levels. Furthermore, SCD 1 ASOs reduced de novo fatty acid synthesis, decreased expression of lipogenic genes, and increased expression of genes promoting energy expenditure in liver and adipose tissues. Thus, SCD 1 inhibition represents a new target for {{the treatment}} of obesity and related metabolic disorders...|$|R
