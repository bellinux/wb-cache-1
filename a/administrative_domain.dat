30|$|Grid {{computing}} involves sharing heterogeneous resources {{which are}} located in geographically distributed places belonging to different <b>administrative</b> <b>domains</b> [1].

Each virtual organization comprises of users and their resources and any other services (S) joined by a common goal [2].
