Brezhnev's most notable snub {{was over the}} 1965 Soviet economic reform.|$|E

25|$|The 1996–97 season started just <b>as</b> <b>badly</b> <b>as</b> the last, {{with three}} {{straight}} losses. However, {{the introduction of}} young forward Andrew Fotiadis saw Luton burst into life, as they shot up {{the table with a}} run of eight wins and two draws in eleven games. Tony Thorpe, too, proved to be a revelation, scoring 28 goals to become the division's top scorer. Luton were nearly promoted, but finished in third place on goal difference and then lost to Crewe Alexandra in the play-offs.|$|E

25|$|At {{the next}} race in Belgium Trulli struggled, only {{being able to}} finish 16th, as his gearbox was damaged in a {{collision}} with Sébastien Bourdais' Toro Rosso on the first lap. Timo Glock, on the other hand, was doing <b>as</b> <b>badly</b> <b>as</b> Trulli until a few laps {{before the end of}} the race the rain came down. Glock changed to wet tyres, and was able to move up the order to 8th place. After the race, however, Glock was penalized 25-seconds for overtaking Mark Webber under yellow flags during the final lap of the race. The penalty pushed Glock to ninth place.|$|E
25|$|Al-Husayn's second {{campaign}} was to end <b>as</b> <b>badly</b> <b>as</b> the first. Once again the Turks defending the land between Baghdad and al-Anbar attacked the Baghdadi army. Al-Husayn {{was able to}} fight them off for several days, but eventually the Turks were able to outmaneuver him and rout the guards stationed on his flanks. When they attacked al-Husayn's army itself, they quickly defeated his men and overran his camp. Al-Husayn himself managed to escape on a river skiff, but a hundred of his men were killed and 170 had been taken prisoner, including several of the officers. Al-Husayn and the other survivors returned to Baghdad, {{and there were no}} further attempts to retake al-Anbar.|$|E
25|$|The Communist radical {{of today}} will be the {{administrator}} of tomorrow, and the Communist Society will need the radical <b>as</b> <b>badly</b> <b>as</b> the capitalist society needs him now. It will then be {{the business of the}} radical, as it is now, not to take an appointment as justice of the Supreme Court, not to perform any particular function {{as a part of the}} established order, but to stand apart and speak his mind about the established order.... A radical who wishes to continue being a radical cannot do so if he is an essential part of the existing order, for then he owes a certain fealty to his position. I have seen Socialists elected to office; they become, not critical functionaries, but administrators, and one cannot be both at the same time.|$|E

25|$|Torquay {{started their}} second {{season in the}} Conference Premier <b>as</b> <b>badly</b> <b>as</b> the first one had finished, picking up only 5 points from their opening 7 games. The {{following}} 3 months however were {{to be the best}} in years, as Torquay remained unbeaten from 7 September 2008 to 2 December 2008, setting a 17-game unbeaten record. They reached the FA Cup 3rd round with a 2–0 win over Oxford United at the end of November. The start of 2009 was shaky but on 3 January 2009 Torquay beat Blackpool 1–0 at home in the FA Cup 3rd round to reach the 4th round of the competition {{for the first time in}} 19 years where they faced Coventry City. They struggled for goals throughout January and against Coventry City with a sell out crowd of 6,018 they lost a game which they should have won; losing dramatically late on to an 87th-minute goal by Elliot Ward. At the end of the month they lost to Southport 3–0 in the FA Trophy 3rd round.|$|E
25|$|In {{collecting}} his testimony, Kennedy realised {{that women}} were being treated <b>as</b> <b>badly</b> <b>as</b> children and widened his scope to include them as well. Kennedy visited the area of Little Lever and interviewed several women and children working in the pits. The women lived in Outwood and were employed by Thomas Fletcher. Fletcher owned both Ladyshore and Outwood Collieries and the women moved from one pit to another {{depending on how much}} coal was being produced. Their testimonies showed that children as young as 5 or 6 were working in the pits. Married and mothers, Betty Wardle and Mary Hardman gave damning testimony to conditions underground. Wardle told Kennedy she started work at the age of 6 whilst Hardman said she started at the age of 7. Wardle later described how she was employed to 'draw with belt and chain'; that is pull the tubs along the underground rails by means of a leather waist belt to the back of which was attached a chain to the tub, used where the tunnels were too small for the use of ponies, (ponies were not used at Outwood, so this must refer to Ladyshore). She then went on to tell Kennedy that she was forced to work whilst pregnant and that she had one child of her four in the mine, the work had brought on labour and the newborn was carried out of the mine in her skirt.|$|E
500|$|All told, {{there was}} $3.5 billion USD in damages to Grand Forks and East Grand Forks, {{making it the}} eighth most {{expensive}} natural disaster in the U.S. since 1903. Across North Dakota and Minnesota, there were [...] of land covered in water. Thousands of people were relocated after the disaster. In May 1997, the Red Cross conducted a damage assessment of 8,000 North Dakota homes. The report indicated that 519 homes, 53 mobile homes, and 73 apartments had been destroyed by flood waters while 701 homes, 69 mobile homes, and 175 apartments sustained major damage. Inspectors reported that 5,959 homes, 166 mobile homes, and 497 apartments received minor damage. Over 5,200 businesses had been destroyed, damaged, or somehow affected by the winter and spring blizzards and the flood. In Grand Forks alone, 75% of the homes, 315 businesses, and 16 of 22 local schools had been flooded. East Grand Forks had over 500 condemned homes, with only eight homes not damaged by the flood. Grand Forks, losing only 3% of its population from 1997 to 2000, did not fare <b>as</b> <b>badly</b> <b>as</b> its sister city, which lost nearly 17% of its residents. Not a single person {{was killed in the}} flood itself.|$|E

500|$|In {{response}} to the first destruction, on 21 October 2015, Creative Commons started the New Palmyra project, an online repository of three-dimensional models representing the city's monuments; the models were generated from images gathered, and released into the public domain, by the Syrian internet advocate Bassel Khartabil between 2005 and 2012. About the destruction during the second ISIL occupation, Abdulkarim states “This time, they don’t seem to have damaged Palmyra <b>as</b> <b>badly</b> <b>as</b> we feared.” and states that [...] "approximately 80% of Palmyra’s antiquities are in fairly good condition and 15% of those more heavily damaged also can and will be restored." [...] Consultations with the UNESCO, UN specialized agencies, archaeological associations and museums produced plans to restore Palmyra; the work is postponed until the violence in Syria ends as many international partners fear {{for the safety of}} their teams as well as ensuring that the restored artifacts will not be damaged again by further battles. The general director of the Czech National Museum, Michal Lukeš, signed an agreement in June 2017 committing the institution to help Syria save, preserve and conserve much of its cultural and historical heritage damaged by war, including the ancient site of Palmyra; he met with Abdulkarim and discussed plans for the works that are said to last until 2019.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the early}} 1950s, Ellington's career {{was at a}} low point with his style being {{generally}} seen as outmoded, but his reputation did not suffer <b>as</b> <b>badly</b> <b>as</b> some artists. André Previn said in 1952: [...] "You know, Stan Kenton can {{stand in front of}} a thousand fiddles and a thousand brass and make a dramatic gesture and every studio arranger can nod his head and say, Oh, yes, that's done like this. But Duke merely lifts his finger, three horns make a sound, and I don’t know what it is!"

The failure of the mission marked {{a turning point in}} his political world-view from largely apolitical to strongly Reaganite, which was further reinforced by the September 11 attacks. Bannon has stated that, [...] "I wasn’t political until I got into the service and saw how badly Jimmy Carter f---ed things up. I became a huge Reagan admirer. Still am. But what turned me against the whole establishment was coming back from running companies in Asia in 2008 and seeing that Bush had f---ed up <b>as</b> <b>badly</b> <b>as</b> Carter.

2500|$|The Ghost Road, {{the final}} {{part of the}} trilogy, shows a side of Rivers not {{previously}} seen in the novels. As well as {{his relationship with his}} sisters and father, we also learn of his feelings for Charles Dodgson- or Lewis Carroll. Carroll was the first adult Rivers met who stammered <b>as</b> <b>badly</b> <b>as</b> he did and yet he cruelly rejected him, preferring to lavish attention on his pretty young sisters. In this novel the reader also learns of Rivers' visit to Melanesia; feverish with Spanish Flu, the doctor is able to recount the expedition and we are provided with insight both into the culture of the island and into Rivers' very different [...] "field trip persona".|$|E

James Green-Armytage tested four ranked-choice methods, and found the alternative vote to be the second-most-resistant to tactical voting, though it was beaten by a class of AV-Condorcet hybrids, and did not resist strategic withdrawal by candidates well. Some simulations of several classes of voting methods in non-scholarly publications found IRV performed <b>as</b> <b>badly</b> <b>as</b> plurality when voters are strategic and fully informed about other voter's full preferences, and was out-performed by Range, Approval, and Borda.|$|E
