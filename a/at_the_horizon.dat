In human life, it occupies roughly {{the latter half of the}} standard work and school day. It is also associated with a number of concerns related to health, safety, and economic productivity: generally, the early afternoon, after most people have eaten lunch, corresponds to decreased work performance, decreased alertness, and a higher incidence of motor vehicle accidents. It is usually from 12 PM to 6 PM, but during winter it may be from 12 PM to 4 PM and during summer it may be from 12 PM to 8 PM.|$|E

25|$|Seurat uses {{a variety}} of means to suggest the baking heat of a summer’s day at the riverside. A hot haze softens {{the edges of the}} trees in the middle-distance and washes out colour from the bridges and {{factories}} in the background—the blue of the sky <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>horizon</b> is paled almost to whiteness. A shimmering appearance at the surface of Bathers at Asnières subtly reinforces this saturating heat and sunlight. Writing about these effects, the art historian Roger Fry reported his view that, “no one could render this enveloping with a more exquisitely tremulous sensibility, a more penetrating observation or more unfailing consistency, than Seurat”.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{different}} spherical coordinate systems following other conventions are used outside mathematics. In a geographical coordinate system positions are measured in latitude, longitude and height or altitude. There are a {{number of different}} celestial coordinate systems based on different fundamental planes and with different terms for the various coordinates. The spherical coordinate systems used in mathematics normally use radians rather than degrees and measure the azimuthal angle counterclockwise from the -axis to the -axis rather than clockwise from north (0°) to east (+90°) like the horizontal coordinate system. The polar angle is often replaced by the elevation angle measured from the reference plane. Elevation angle of zero is <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>horizon.</b>|$|E
25|$|The trans-Planckian {{problem is}} {{nowadays}} mostly considered a mathematical artifact of horizon calculations. The same effect occurs for regular matter falling onto a white hole solution. Matter which {{falls on the}} white hole accumulates on it, but has no future region into which it can go. Tracing {{the future of this}} matter, it is compressed onto the final singular endpoint of the white hole evolution, into a trans-Planckian region. The reason for these types of divergences is that modes which end <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>horizon</b> {{from the point of view}} of outside coordinates are singular in frequency there. The only way to determine what happens classically is to extend in some other coordinates that cross the horizon.|$|E
40|$|Antoci et al. {{have argued}} that <b>the</b> <b>horizons</b> of <b>the</b> boost-rotation, Kerr and Schwarzschild {{solutions}} are singular, having shown that a certain invariantly-defined acceleration scalar blows up <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>horizons.</b> Their examples do not satisfy the usual definition of a singularity. It is argued that using the same term is seriously misleading and it is shown that such divergent functions are natural concomitants of regular horizons. In particular {{it is noted that}} the divergence is given by the special relativistic approximation to the overall metric. Earlier work on characterization of horizons by invariants is revisited, a new invariant criterion for them is proposed, and the relation of the acceleration invariant to the Cartan invariants, which are finite <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>horizons</b> and completely determine the spacetimes, is examined for the C-metric, Kerr and Schwarzschild cases.

25|$|Properties {{meaningful}} for {{projective geometry}} are respected by this new idea of transformation, {{which is more}} radical in its effects than can be expressed by a transformation matrix and translations (the affine transformations). The first issue for geometers {{is what kind of}} geometry is adequate for a novel situation. It is not possible to refer to angles in projective geometry as it is in Euclidean geometry, because angle {{is an example of a}} concept not invariant with respect to projective transformations, as is seen in perspective drawing. One source for projective geometry was indeed the theory of perspective. Another difference from elementary geometry is the way in which parallel lines can be said to meet in a point at infinity, once the concept is translated into projective geometry's terms. Again this notion has an intuitive basis, such as railway tracks meeting <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>horizon</b> in a perspective drawing. See projective plane for the basics of projective geometry in two dimensions.|$|E

500|$|Aries is home {{to several}} meteor showers. The Daytime Arietid meteor shower {{is one of the}} strongest meteor showers that occurs during the day, lasting from 22 May to 2 July. It is an annual shower {{associated}} with the Marsden group of comets that peaks on 7 June with a maximum zenithal hourly rate of 54 meteors. Its parent body may be the asteroid Icarus. The meteors are sometimes visible before dawn, because the radiant is 32 degrees away from the Sun. They usually appear at a rate of 1–2 per hour as [...] "earthgrazers", meteors that last several seconds and often begin <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>horizon.</b> Because most of the Daytime Arietids are not visible to the naked eye, they are observed in the radio spectrum. This is possible because of the ionized gas they leave in their wake. Other meteor showers radiate from Aries during the day; these include the Daytime Epsilon Arietids and the Northern and Southern Daytime May Arietids. The Jodrell Bank Observatory discovered the Daytime Arietids in 1947 when James Hey and G. S. Stewart adapted the World War II-era radar systems for meteor observations.|$|E

2500|$|An {{outgoing}} Hawking radiated photon, if {{the mode}} is traced back in time, has a frequency which diverges from that {{which it has}} at great distance, as it gets closer to the horizon, which requires the wavelength of the photon to [...] "scrunch up" [...] infinitely <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>horizon</b> of the black hole. In a maximally extended external Schwarzschild solution, that photon's frequency stays regular only if the mode is extended back into the past region where no observer can go. That region seems to be unobservable and is physically suspect, so Hawking used a black hole solution without a past region which forms at a finite time in the past. In that case, {{the source of all}} the outgoing photons can be identified: a microscopic point right at the moment that the black hole first formed.|$|E

We also analyses the GSL under non-equilibrium conditions and shows that the fulfillment of GSL <b>at</b> <b>the</b> apparent <b>horizon</b> implies that <b>the</b> temperature of the dark energy is greater than that of <b>the</b> <b>horizon.</b> Thus there occurs a flow of dark energy towards <b>the</b> apparent <b>horizon.</b> As a result the entropy of the dark energy decreases and that of horizon increases.

40|$|The {{internal}} {{structure of a}} charged spherical black hole is still a topic of debate. In a nonrotating but aspherical gravitational collapse to form a spherical charged black hole, the backscattered gravitational wave tails enter the black hole and are blueshifted <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Cauchy <b>horizon.</b> This has a catastrophic effect if combined with an outflux crossing the Cauchy horizon: a singularity develops <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Cauchy <b>horizon</b> and <b>the</b> effective mass inflates. Recently a numerical study of a massless scalar field in the background suggested that a spacelike singularity may form before <b>the</b> Cauchy <b>horizon</b> forms. We will show that there exists an approximate analytic solution of the scalar field equations which allows the mass inflation singularity <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Cauchy <b>horizon</b> to exist.
