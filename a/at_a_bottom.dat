In a small place such as a county, products can go directly from the regional general agent to retailers and then to patients, without the involvement of sub wholesalers.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the {{transformation}} of an internal solitary wave <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>bottom</b> step {{in the framework of}} two-layer flow, for the case when the interface lies close to the bottom, and so the solitary waves are elevation waves. The outcome is the formation of solitary waves and dispersive wave trains in both the reflected and transmitted fields. We use a two-pronged approach, based on numerical simulations of the fully nonlinear equations using a version of the Princeton Ocean Model on the one hand, and a theoretical and numerical study of the Gardner equation on the other hand. In the numerical experiments, the ratio of the initial wave amplitude to the layer thickness is varied up one-half, and nonlinear effects are then essential. In general, the characteristics of the generated solitary waves obtained in the fully nonlinear simulations are in reasonable agreement with the predictions of our theoretical model, which is based on matching linear shallow-water theory in the vicinity of a step with solutions of the Gardner equation for waves far from the step...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{describes}} the road towards and experiments with top-gating of the {{two-dimensional electron gas}} (2 DEG) at the interfaces between the complex oxides LaAlO 3 and SrTiO 3. These two materials are insulators, however their interface is conducting. It has been demonstrated that a back-gate (<b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>bottom</b> of the substrate) is able to globally tune {{the properties of the}} 2 DEG. In this work top-gating is used, since this technique allows for local control over the electron gas, since the top-gate is very close (less than 5 nm) to the electron gas. The work describe in the thesis shows that using e-beam evaporated gold as top-gate electrode leads to low leakage currents. This enables to apply a voltage to the gate to create an electric field across the LaAlO 3 layer. Thereby it is possible to switch the conductivity of the 2 DEG from conducting to insulating at room temperature. At low temperatures (T = 2 K) the mobility and the carrier density can be tuned. From magnetoresistance measurements at this temperature the spin-orbit coupling has been calculated and it is shown that this depends on the applied gate voltage to the top-gate. At temperatures between 37 mK and 250 mK the electron gas is superconducting. By applying a gate voltage it is possible to manipulate the critical temperature and critical current of the superconductivity...|$|E

40|$|Among the {{numerous}} taphonomic influences that can impact biological remains, agricultural activity {{has one of}} the most widespread effects. The present research examines the impacts of agricultural activities on buried skeletal remains, both in archaeological and medicolegal contexts. Juvenile pig (Sus scrofa) skeletons were utilized to simulate buried juvenile human aged 3 to 5 years to test the influence of original burial depths and different plowing intervals on the dispersal and the degree of damage caused by an offset disk plow. Ten juvenile pig skeletons were buried in relatively anatomical position, five <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>bottom</b> depth of 15 cmbs (cm below the surface) and five at 22 cmbs. They were subjected to different intervals of plowing with one burial at each depth subjected to a single, three, five, seven, or ten plow passes. The disturbed area was surveyed for surface material, and the plow furrows were excavated in 1 m by 1 m units. The excavated soil was screened using a ¼" mesh screen, except for two burials that were screened using a nested ¼" and ⅛" mesh screen to test the differences in recovery between the two screen sizes. The recovered skeletal material was inventoried and assessed for damage. The results of this research showed that while original burial depth had some effect on distribution of bone and the degree to which bone was damaged, the relationship was not statistically significant. The number of plowing intervals did have a significant effect on the distribution and degree of damage. The damage caused to bone by the offset disk plow would be distinguishable from perimortem trauma in dry bone. Comparison of the recovery rates of ¼" and ⅛" mesh found that ⅛" contributed to a higher recovery of juvenile remains at least 3 to 5 years of age in soil with a high gravel content...|$|E
40|$|The 7. 5 m long SK 13 {{sediment}} core, drilled at Lake Shkodra (Albania) <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>bottom</b> {{depth of}} 7 m {{in the central}} {{southern part of the}} lake, was selected for multidisciplinary analysis. The sediment core age spans from 4560 cal yr BP to present. The origin and the evolution of the lake are still debated and were never investigated in detail. In historical records, until the 15 th century Lake Shkodrawas nevermentioned as such, but as amarshland or as a confluence between two rivers. Our research aims to reconstruct the past biodiversity and the Middle-Late Holocene palaeoenvironmental and palaeoclimatic changes using Ostracods, Characeae, and comparing the micropaleontological data with pollens and stable isotope curves. Thirteen ostracod and five charophyte species were identified. Amongst the ostracods Candona montenigrina and Limnocythere scutariense are endemic of the lake; Candona meridionalis, Paralimnocythere georgevitschi, Metacypris cordata, Candona ex gr. bimucronata, and Cyclocypris sp. have been collected {{for the first time in}} Lake Shkodra; the last three taxa occurred only in the lower portion of the sediment core. Amongst the charophytes, Lychnothamnus barbatus and Nitella hyalina are recorded for the first time in the lake and occurs with high frequency throughout the lower portion of the core. A drastic change occurs between 1274 and 1197 cal yr BP, when 8 ostracod species out of 13 and all charophytes disappear, and the frequency of the remaining 5 species dramatically increases. The micropaleontological data suggest a decrease of the lake biodiversity since around 1200 cal yr BP linked to the transition between an ancient marshland to a lacustrine environment. This drastic event seems to be independent from any global or local climate change but linked to the complex hydrographic setting of the lake and of its only outlet, the River Bojana, discharging in the Adriatic Sea...|$|E
40|$|Scenario of {{formation}} of fast radio bursts (FRBs) is proposed. Just like radio pulsars, sources of FRBs are magnetized neutron stars. Appearance of strong electric field in a magnetosphere of {{a neutron star}} is associated with close passage of a dense body near hot neutron star. For the repeating source FRB 121102, which has been observed in four series of bursts, the period of orbiting {{of the body is}} about 200 days. Thermal radiation {{from the surface of the}} star (temperature is of the order of 10 ^ 8 K) causes evaporation and ionization of the matter of the dense body. Ionized gas (plasma) flows around the magnetosphere of the neutron star with the velocity u ≃ 10 ^ 7 cm / s, and creates electric potential ψ_ 0 ≃ 10 ^ 11 V in the polar region of the magnetosphere. Electrons from the plasma flow are accelerated toward the star, and gain Lorentz factor of ≃ 10 ^ 5. Thermal photons moving toward precipitating electrons are scattered by them, and produce gamma photons with energies of ≃ 10 ^ 5 m_e c^ 2. These gamma quanta produce electron-positron pairs in collisions with thermal photons. The multiplicity, the number of born pairs per one primary electron, is about 10 ^ 5. The electron-positron plasma, produced in the polar region of magnetosphere, accumulates in a narrow layer <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>bottom</b> of a potential well formed on one side by a blocking potential ψ_ 0, and on the other side by pressure of thermal radiation. The density of electron-positron plasma in the layer increases with time, and after short time the layer becomes a mirror for thermal radiation of the star. The thermal radiation in the polar region under the layer is accumulated during time ≃ 500 s, then the plasma layer is ejected outside. The ejection is observed as burst of radio emission formed by the flow of relativistic electron-positron plasma. Comment: 8 pages, 4 figure...|$|E
