5|$|In the 1940s and 50s, {{a handful}} of {{scientists}} {{from a variety of}} fields (mathematics, psychology, engineering, economics and political science) began to discuss the possibility of creating an artificial brain. The field of artificial intelligence research was founded as an <b>academic</b> <b>discipline</b> in 1956.|$|E
5|$|Academic reviewers {{were mostly}} positive, but several raised {{concerns}} over Berger's incorrect use of terminology. Reviewers noted the study's importance in developing Pagan studies as an <b>academic</b> <b>discipline</b> and helping further the wider sociological investigation into new religious {{movements in the}} United States. In the years following the study's publication, Berger continued to investigate the Pagan community, focusing her interest on the popularity of Wicca among teenagers.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} ten, Pei {{moved with}} his family to Shanghai after his father was promoted. Pei {{attended}} Saint Johns Middle School, run by Protestant missionaries. <b>Academic</b> <b>discipline</b> was rigorous; students were allowed only one half-day each month for leisure. Pei enjoyed playing billiards and watching Hollywood movies, especially those of Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin. He also learned rudimentary English skills by reading the Bible and novels by Charles Dickens.|$|E
50|$|While <b>academic</b> <b>disciplines</b> {{in and of}} {{themselves}} are more or less focused practices, scholarly approaches such as multidisciplinarity, interdisciplinarity, transdisciplinarity, and crossdisciplinarity integrate aspects from multiple <b>academic</b> <b>disciplines,</b> therefore addressing any problems that may arise from narrow concentration within specialized fields of study. For example, professionals may encounter trouble communicating across <b>academic</b> <b>disciplines</b> because of differences in language or specified concepts.|$|R

5|$|Establishment of {{sociology}} as an independent, recognized <b>academic</b> <b>discipline</b> is amongst Durkheim's {{largest and most}} lasting legacies. Within sociology, his work has significantly influenced structuralism or structural functionalism. Scholars inspired by Durkheim include Marcel Mauss, Maurice Halbwachs, Célestin Bouglé, Alfred Radcliffe-Brown, Talcott Parsons, Robert K. Merton, Jean Piaget, Claude Lévi-Strauss, Ferdinand de Saussure, Michel Foucault, Clifford Geertz, Peter Berger, Robert Bellah, social reformer Patrick Hunout and others.|$|E
5|$|Geology is {{the science}} and study of the solid and liquid matter that {{constitutes}} the Earth. The field of geology encompasses {{the study of the}} composition, structure, physical properties, dynamics, and history of Earth materials, and the processes by which they are formed, moved, and changed. The field is a major <b>academic</b> <b>discipline,</b> and is also important for mineral and hydrocarbon extraction, knowledge about and mitigation of natural hazards, some Geotechnical engineering fields, and understanding past climates and environments.|$|E
5|$|In astrophysical plasmas, Debye {{screening}} prevents electric fields from directly {{affecting the}} plasma over large distances, i.e., {{greater than the}} Debye length. However, the existence of charged particles causes the plasma to generate, and be affected by, magnetic fields. This can and does cause extremely complex behavior, such as the generation of plasma double layers, an object that separates charge over a few tens of Debye lengths. The dynamics of plasmas interacting with external and self-generated magnetic fields are studied in the <b>academic</b> <b>discipline</b> of magnetohydrodynamics.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, new <b>academic</b> <b>disciplines</b> such as {{education}} and psychology were added. In the 1970s and 1980s, {{there was an explosion}} of new <b>academic</b> <b>disciplines</b> focusing on specific themes, such as media studies, women's studies, and Africana studies. Many <b>academic</b> <b>disciplines</b> designed as preparation for careers and professions, such as nursing, hospitality management, and corrections, also emerged in the universities. Finally, interdisciplinary scientific fields of study such as biochemistry and geophysics gained prominence as their contribution to knowledge became widely recognized.|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, under the {{influence}} of the United States where photography had become an <b>academic</b> <b>discipline,</b> exhibitions such as New American Photography in Copenhagen's Bella Center presented top artistic photographers of the 1950s and 1960s including Harry Callahan, Jerry Uelsmann and Diane Arbus. This was followed in 1973 by the opening of Galleriet for Creativ Fotografi (Gallery for Creative Photography) in Copenhagen, to be followed in 1977 by the IMAGE gallery in Aarhus which encouraged experimental photography. Subsequent exhibitions involved the landscape photographer Kirsten Klein, the pioneers of staged photography Nanna Bisp Büchert and Lis Steincke, as well as the magic realist Per Bak Jensen.|$|E
5|$|As freshmen {{struggled}} with the Athenian curriculum, he reverted to classification by <b>academic</b> <b>discipline</b> and offered companion texts {{in the field of}} the current work studied. In their dorms, the college students were known for their lack of respect for property, with three times the breakage in dorm assets {{than the rest of the}} university. Meiklejohn saw this as desirable and indicative of abetting nonconformity, and did not attempt to curb it. Meiklejohn had full reign over the college, so the university and its disciplinary proceedings could not intervene. Upon their exit two years later, students transferred to a number of Ivy League and prominent state universities. By this time, the college was known throughout the nation and Europe.|$|E
5|$|Charles Sherrington {{published}} his influential 1906 work The Integrative Action of the Nervous System examining {{the function of}} reflexes, evolutionary development {{of the nervous system}}, functional specialisation of the brain, and layout and cellular function of the central nervous system. John Farquhar Fulton, founded the Journal of Neurophysiology and published the first comprehensive textbook on the physiology of the nervous system during 1938. Neuroscience during the twentieth century began to be recognized as a distinct unified <b>academic</b> <b>discipline,</b> with David Rioch, Francis O. Schmitt, and Stephen Kuffler playing critical roles in establishing the field. Rioch originated the integration of basic anatomical and physiological research with clinical psychiatry at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, starting in the 1950s. During the same period, Schmitt established the Neuroscience Research Program, an inter-university and international organisation, bringing together biology, medicine, psychological and behavioural sciences. The word neuroscience itself arises from this program.|$|E
