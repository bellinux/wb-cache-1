25|$|A {{vertical}} input {{goes to a}} frequency-compensated step <b>attenuator</b> {{to reduce}} large signals to prevent overload. The <b>attenuator</b> feeds a low-level stage (or a few), which in turn feed gain stages (and a delay-line driver {{if there is a}} delay). Following are more gain stages, up to the final output stage which develops a large signal swing (tens of volts, sometimes over 100 volts) for CRT electrostatic deflection.|$|E
25|$|Fiber {{connections}} have minimum cable lengths due {{to level}} requirements on received signals. Fiber ports designed for long-haul wavelengths require a signal <b>attenuator</b> if used within a building.|$|E
25|$|The {{microwave}} bridge contains {{both the}} microwave source and the detector. Older spectrometers used a vacuum tube called a klystron to generate microwaves however modern spectrometers use a Gunn diode. Immediately after the microwave source {{there is an}} isolator which serves to attenuate any reflections back to the source which would result in fluctuations in the microwave frequency. The microwave power from the source is then passed through a directional coupler which splits the microwave power into two paths, one directed towards the cavity and the other the reference arm. Along both paths there is a variable <b>attenuator</b> that facilitates the precise control {{of the flow of}} microwave power. This in turn allows for accurate control over the intensity of the microwaves subjected to the sample. On the reference arm, after the variable <b>attenuator</b> there is a phase shifter that sets a defined phase relationship between the reference and reflected signal which permits phase sensitive detection.|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{photoconductivity}} is utilized {{in a number}} of microwave applications such as switches and <b>attenuators.</b> Optically controlled microwave <b>attenuators</b> prove an alternative to the conventional <b>attenuators</b> due to their simplicity, easy of operation, and very narrow ranges of continuously varying attenuation levels available. This paper describes the design of such configurations of optically controlled <b>attenuators</b> on a microstrip line fabricated on a semiconductor substrate...|$|R

50|$|Basic {{circuits}} used in <b>attenuators</b> are pi pads (π-type) and T pads. These may {{be required}} to be balanced or unbalanced networks depending on whether the line geometry with which they are to be used is balanced or unbalanced. For instance, <b>attenuators</b> used with coaxial lines would be the unbalanced form while <b>attenuators</b> for use with twisted pair are required to be the balanced form.|$|R
25|$|An {{amplifier}} {{operating under}} linear (small signal) conditions {{is a good}} example of a non-reciprocal network and a matched <b>attenuator</b> is an example of a reciprocal network. In the following cases we will assume that the input and output connections are to ports 1 and 2 respectively which is the most common convention. The nominal system impedance, frequency and any other factors which may influence the device, such as temperature, must also be specified.|$|E

These technologies have revolutionized their respective markets. They have been adopted around the globe and produced major reductions {{in the number of}} serious injuries and fatalities along highways and race tracks.|$|E
25|$|A PSK31 {{operator}} typically uses a single-sideband (SSB) transceiver {{connected to}} the sound card of a computer running PSK31 software. When the operator enters a message for transmission, the software produces an audio tone that sounds, to the human ear, like a continuous whistle with a slight warble. This sound is then fed through either a microphone jack (using an intermediate resistive <b>attenuator</b> to reduce the sound card's output power to microphone levels) or an auxiliary connection into the transceiver, from which it is transmitted.|$|E
50|$|In {{electrical}} engineering and telecommunications, attenuation affects {{the propagation of}} waves and signals in electrical circuits, in optical fibers, and in air. Electrical <b>attenuators</b> and optical <b>attenuators</b> are commonly manufactured components in this field.|$|R
50|$|<b>Attenuators</b> {{are usually}} passive devices made from simple voltage divider networks. Switching between {{different}} resistances forms adjustable stepped <b>attenuators</b> and continuously adjustable ones using potentiometers. For higher frequencies precisely matched low VSWR resistance networks are used.|$|R
50|$|Optical <b>attenuators</b> {{can take}} a number of {{different}} forms and are typically classified as fixed or variable <b>attenuators.</b> What's more, they can be classified as LC, SC, ST, FC, MU, E2000 etc. according to the different types of connectors.|$|R
25|$|Voltage-controlled {{amplifier}} (VCA) – After {{the signal}} generated by one (or {{a mix of}} more) VCOs has been modified by filters and LFOs, and its waveform has been shaped (contoured) by an ADSR envelope generator, it then passes on {{to one or more}} voltage-controlled amplifiers (VCAs). A VCA is a preamp that boosts (amplifies) the electronic signal before passing it on to an external or built-in power amplifier, as well as a means to control its amplitude (volume) using an <b>attenuator.</b> The gain of the VCA is affected by a control voltage (CV), coming from an envelope generator, an LFO, the keyboard or some other source.|$|E
25|$|The {{classification}} of a laser {{is based on}} the concept of accessible emission limits (AEL) that are defined for each laser class. This is usually a maximum power (in W) or energy (in J) that can be emitted in a specified wavelength range and exposure time that passes through a specified aperture stop at a specified distance. For infrared wavelengths above 4 μm, it is specified as a maximum power density (in W/m2). It {{is the responsibility of the}} manufacturer to provide the correct {{classification of}} a laser, and to equip the laser with appropriate warning labels and safety measures as prescribed by the regulations. Safety measures used with the more powerful lasers include key-controlled operation, warning lights to indicate laser light emission, a beam stop or <b>attenuator,</b> and an electrical contact that the user can connect to an emergency stop or interlock.|$|E
25|$|To {{minimize}} loading, <b>attenuator</b> probes (e.g.,10X probes) are used. A typical probe uses a 9megohm {{series resistor}} shunted by a low-value capacitor {{to make an}} RC compensated divider with the cable capacitance and scope input. The RC time constants are adjusted to match. For example, the 9megohm series resistor is shunted by a 12.2pF capacitor for a time constant of 110microseconds. The cable capacitance of 90pF in parallel with the scope input of 20pF and 1megohm (total capacitance 110pF) also gives a time constant of 110 microseconds. In practice, {{there will be an}} adjustment so the operator can precisely match the low frequency time constant (called compensating the probe). Matching the time constants makes the attenuation independent of frequency. At low frequencies (where the resistance of R is much less than the reactance of C), the circuit looks like a resistive divider; at high frequencies (resistance much greater than reactance), the circuit looks like a capacitive divider.|$|E

500|$|It is {{possible}} to completely eliminate errors in the detector and meter if a precision variable <b>attenuator</b> {{is used in the}} test setup. [...] In this technique a minimum is first found and the <b>attenuator</b> adjusted so that the meter is indicating precisely some convenient mark. [...] A maximum is then found and the attenuation increased until the meter is indicating the same mark. [...] The amount the attenuation had to be increased is the VSWR of the standing wave. [...] Accuracy here depends on the accuracy of the <b>attenuator</b> and not at all on the detector.|$|E
500|$|The topologies {{shown in}} figure 1.7 are {{commonly}} used for filter and <b>attenuator</b> designs. [...] The L-section is identical topology to the potential divider topology. [...] The T-section is identical topology to the Y topology. [...] The Π-section is identical topology to the Δ topology.|$|E
500|$|Slotted lines {{can measure}} {{standing}} waves, wavelength, and, with some calculation or plotting on Smith charts, {{a number of}} other parameters including reflection coefficient and electrical impedance. [...] A precision variable <b>attenuator</b> is often incorporated in the test setup to improve accuracy. [...] This is used to make level measurements, while the detector and VSWR meter are retained only to mark a reference point for the <b>attenuator</b> to be set to, thus eliminating entirely the detector and meter measurement errors. [...] The parameter most commonly measured by a slotted line is SWR. This serves as a measure of the accuracy of the impedance match to the item under test. [...] This is especially important for transmitting antennas and their feed lines; high standing wave ratio on a radio or TV antenna can distort the signal, increase transmission line loss and potentially damage components in the transmission path, possibly even the transmitter.|$|E

500|$|A typical {{test setup}} with a {{waveguide}} slotted line {{is shown in}} figure 2. [...] Referring to this figure, power from a test equipment source (not shown) [...] enters the apparatus through the co-axial cable on the left and is converted to waveguide format by means of a launcher (1). [...] This is followed by a section of waveguide (2) providing a transition to a smaller size of guide. [...] An important component in the setup is the isolator (3) which prevents power being reflected back into the source. [...] Depending on the test conditions, such reflections can be large and a high-power source may be damaged by the returning wave. [...] The power entering the slotted line is controlled by a rotary variable <b>attenuator</b> (4). [...] This is followed by the slotted line itself (5) above which is the probe mounted on a movable carriage. [...] The carriage also carries the probe adjustements: (6) is the probe depth adjustment, (7) is a length of co-axial section with tuning adjustments, and (8) is a crystal detector. [...] The right-hand end of the slotted line is terminated in a matched load (9) which absorbs all the power exiting the end of the waveguide. [...] The load can be replaced by the component or system that it is desired to test. [...] It can also be replaced with a reference short-circuit (10) which is used to calibrate the slotted line. [...] The carriage can be moved along the slotted line by means of a rotary knob (11) which simultaneously moves a vernier gauge (12) for accurate measurement of the probes position along the line.|$|E
2500|$|It must be {{emphasised}} {{that these}} half sections {{are far from}} being constant resistance. [...] They have the same transfer function as a constant resistance network, but only when correctly terminated. [...] An equaliser will not give good results if a half-section is positioned facing the line since the line will have a variable (and probably unknown) impedance. [...] Likewise, two half-sections cannot be connected directly {{to each other as}} these both will have variable impedances. [...] However, if a sufficiently large <b>attenuator</b> is placed between the two variable impedances, this will have the effect of masking the effect. [...] A high value <b>attenuator</b> will have an input impedance [...] no matter what the terminating impedance on the other side. [...] In the example practical chain shown above there is a 22dB <b>attenuator</b> required in the chain. [...] This {{does not need to be}} at the end of the chain, it can be placed anywhere desired and used to mask two mismatched impedances. [...] It can also be split into two or more parts and used for masking more than one mismatch.|$|E
2500|$|A Zobel {{filter section}} can be {{implemented}} for low-pass, high-pass, band-pass or band-stop. [...] It is also possible to implement a flat frequency response <b>attenuator.</b> [...] This last is of some importance for the practical filter sections described later.|$|E

2500|$|The most {{significant}} effect {{that needs to}} be compensated for is that at some cut-off frequency the line response starts to roll-off like a simple low-pass filter. [...] The effective bandwidth of the line can be increased with a section that is a high-pass filter matching this roll-off, combined with an <b>attenuator.</b> [...] In the flat part of the pass-band only the <b>attenuator</b> part of the filter section is significant. [...] This is set at an attenuation equal {{to the level of the}} highest frequency of interest. [...] All frequencies up to this point will then be equalised flat to an attenuated level. [...] Above this point, the output of the filter will again start to roll-off.|$|E
2500|$|Bumps and dips in the {{passband}} can {{be compensated}} for with band-stop and band-pass sections respectively. [...] Again, an <b>attenuator</b> element is also required, but usually rather smaller than that required for the roll-off. [...] These anomalies in the pass-band {{can be caused by}} mismatched line segments as described above. [...] Dips can also be caused by ground temperature variations.|$|E
2500|$|In {{conventional}} re-amplification, a dry recorded {{signal is}} sent into a balanced XLR input. An unbalanced ¼" [...] (Tip-Sleeve) phone connector is typically {{used for the}} output, which {{is connected to the}} guitar amp rig. Some re-amping devices offer a pad (<b>attenuator)</b> switch to reduce a too-hot output level. Sometimes a guitar volume pedal or buffered effects pedal can work adequately for re-amping, depending on grounding, levels, and impedance. Another approach to simulating the high impedance of a guitar pickup is to use a passive DI and add a 10 K-ohm resistor in series with the signal connection inside a 1/4" [...] plug.|$|E
