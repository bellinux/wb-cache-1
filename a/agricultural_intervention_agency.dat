40|$|East Africa's {{smallholder}} {{agriculture is}} expected to be strongly affected by climate change, which, together with a growing population and pressure on natural resources, will result in an increasing challenge to achieve food security for households and regions. Policy makers need information on what works where for which farmers in order to guide their decision making and prioritise investment for <b>agricultural</b> <b>interventions</b> to increase food security. For this, we must better understand how smallholder farm strategies for achieving food security differ across regions and farm types and what drives these strategies. In this study we present new analyses at country and farm household level that quantify drivers of productivity and food security, and {{that can be used to}} prioritise <b>agricultural</b> <b>interventions.</b> Uganda was chosen as a case study because of data availability but the approach can be applied to other countries in sub-Saharan Africa. First, we quantified how food security and farm types varied across Uganda, and which key factors drive this variability. We used household level data from the Living Standard Measurement Study – Integrated Survey on Agriculture (LSMS-ISA) of the World Bank and developed an approach to map and quantitatively explain food security and agricultural land use across Uganda. The resulting maps showed where which crops and livestock activities are important for which types of farm households. Subsequently, the effects of <b>agricultural</b> <b>interventions</b> on food security of different farm types were assessed. Second, we used this information to select contrasting sites and farm households for detailed interviews, which aimed at identifying drivers of farmers' decision making, assessing farmers' vulnerability to climate change and how proposed interventions match with the farmers' socio-ecological niche. The spatial approach we developed is a novel way to use farm household level information to generate country-wide patterns in farming systems and their productivity. It generates useful information for a quantitative assessment of what might happen to the food security of smallholder farmers in Uganda under climate change and for a country-wide targeting of <b>agricultural</b> <b>interventions</b> that aim at mitigating the effects of climate change...|$|R

40|$|Agricultural {{research}} {{has existed for}} many decades at national and global levels and research-based <b>agricultural</b> <b>interventions,</b> often driven by the state, have taken place across Africa over an extended period. But, overall, these interventions have not generated the high potential and kinds of outcomes expected of {{them in terms of}} enhancing agricultural productivity amongst small-scale farmers and improving the quality of their agrarian lives. In the context of neoliberal restructuring globally, new forms of <b>agricultural</b> <b>interventions</b> have arisen which highlight the significance of more participatory methodologies in which non-governmental organisations become central. One such methodology rests on the notion of an agricultural innovation platform which involves bringing on board a diverse range of actors (or stakeholders) which function together to generate agricultural knowledge and practices suitable to the needs of a particular small-scale farming community, with the small-scale farmers expected to be key actors in the platform. Such platforms are now being implemented in specific rural sites in Zimbabwe, including in communal areas in the district of Hwedza where farming activities have for many years now being in large survivalist in character. The objective of this thesis is to critically analyse the agricultural innovation platforms in Hwedza, but not in the sense of assessing the impact of the platforms on agricultural productivity. Rather, the thesis examines the multi-faceted social interactions and relationships embodied in the innovation platform process. In pursuing this, I rely heavily – but in a critical manner – on interface analysis as set out by Norman Long. The fieldwork for the Hwedza involved an interpretative-qualitative methodology based on methods such as in-depth interviews, focus group discussions, questionnaires and observations. The major finding of the thesis is that the agricultural innovation platforms, at least as implemented in Hwedza, do challenge top-down approaches to <b>agricultural</b> <b>interventions</b> by unlocking the possibility of multiple pathways of inclusion and particularly for small-scale farmers but that, simultaneously, they also involve processes marked by divergences, exclusions, tensions and conflicts which may undermine the legitimacy and effectiveness of the platforms...|$|R

40|$|Soil {{health is}} {{presented}} as an integrative property that reflects the capacity of soil to respond to <b>agricultural</b> <b>intervention,</b> so that it continues to support both the agricultural production {{and the provision of}} other ecosystem services. The major challenge within sustainable soil management is to conserve ecosystem service delivery while optimizing agricultural yields. It is proposed that soil health is dependent on the maintenance of four major functions: carbon transformations; nutrient cycles; soil structure maintenance; and the regulation of pests and diseases. Each of these functions is manifested as an aggregate of a variety of biological processes provided by a diversity of interacting soil organisms {{under the influence of the}} abiotic soil environment. Analysis of current models of the soil community under the impact of <b>agricultural</b> <b>interventions</b> (particularly those entailing substitution of biological processes with fossil fuel-derived energy or inputs) confirms the highly integrative pattern of interactions within each of these functions and leads to the conclusion that measurement of individual groups of organisms, processes or soil properties does not suffice to indicate the state of the soil health. A further conclusion is that quantifying the flow of energy and carbon between functions is an essential but non-trivial task for the assessment and management of soil health...|$|R
40|$|Time {{is a vital}} {{input into}} {{nutritional}} outcomes, as {{it is necessary for}} the production, procurement and preparation of food, child feeding and childcare. Thus, <b>agricultural</b> <b>interventions</b> may fail to improve nutritional outcomes if they do not take account of time constraints, particularly of rural women who spend a considerable portion of their time in agriculture. Given the potential trade-offs pertaining to time in productive vs. reproductive activities and its implications for maternal and child nutrition, the goal of this review is to systematically map and assess the available evidence, both qualitative and quantitative studies, agriculture-time use-nutrition pathway. Through an analysis of 89 studies, identified through a systematic search, on rural areas of low and middle-income countries, we observe three findings. First, women {{play a key role in}} agriculture, as reflected in their time commitments. Second, evidence from a very limited set of studies suggests that <b>agricultural</b> <b>interventions</b> tend to increase time commitments in agriculture of the household members for whom impact is measured.

40|$|<b>Agricultural</b> {{development}} <b>interventions</b> {{and policies}} {{have an impact}} on the nutrition of individuals through changes in food availability, in food diversity, in food prices, and changes in farmers' income. Less straightforward, they also entail many changes in health environment and in time availability for care activities. They finally have impacts on the balance of power both at the intra-household, community, and global levels. The impact pathways are complex and interlinked, and many recent studies have primarily focused on their positive effects. However, some <b>agricultural</b> <b>interventions</b> might have a negative impact on nutrition in certain cases. This article sets out to identify them, through a review of the scientific and institutional literature, along with expert interviews. Six risk categories are proposed, relative to incomes, prices, types of products, women's social status and workload, the health environment, and inequalities. This review underlines the necessity to have an ex ante analysis of the nutrition impacts of any food or <b>agricultural</b> policy or <b>intervention</b> with “do not harm approach” regarding the nutrition outcomes. It gives clues to identify and mitigate the main negative outcome and advocate for more applied and well-documented research on that topic. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

40|$|Many rural Malawians {{experience}} food insecurity, {{attributed to}} a number of factors including poverty, climate change, structural adjustment, poor governance and the impacts of HIV/AIDS. The prevalence of HIV/AIDS is currently estimated at 11 % amongst adults. To address food insecurity in Northern Malawi, the Soils, Food and Health Communities (SFHC) agroecological project was implemented in 2000. In 2006, the project began to focus some of its program on farmers living with HIV/AIDS, but the impact of this shift has not been studied. There are few studies examining the potential for <b>agricultural</b> <b>interventions</b> to address the food security needs of AIDS-affected households. To fill this gap, this study examines how the SFHC agroecological intervention impacted HIV/AIDS-affected households. Using a feminist political ecology approach, I collected and analysed data from participant observation, visual diagramming with focus groups (n= 6) and in-depth interviews (n= 63). The findings suggest that SFHC agroecological methods contribute to increased crop yields, labour relief, income generation, networking and dietary diversity. Yet, household poverty, ongoing impacts of HIV/AIDS, gender inequalities and abuse, the high number of dependents per household, and other competing <b>agricultural</b> <b>interventions</b> undermine the intervention’s potential to improve food production and food security. In conclusion, I recommend gender equality advocacy, collaboration of competing interventions, HIV/AIDS burden-sensitive, and holistic program modifications aimed at addressing the factors that are inhibiting HIV/AIDS-affected households’ food security improvement...|$|R
