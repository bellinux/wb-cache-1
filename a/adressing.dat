While <b>adressing</b> Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu, Macron stated that, [...] "We will never surrender to the messages of hate; we will not surrender to anti-Zionism because it is a reinvention of anti-Semitism."

Students are allowed to work on either essay within this total time period. The section begins with a 15 minute reading period where students are advised to read both the documents for DBQ. However, students may begin writing during this time; most students take notes on the documents in order to plan out the DBQ. Students are advised to spend 45 minutes writing the DBQ and then 40 writing the LEQ, but there are no rules on when each essay must be worked on. There are three prompts for the LEQ, but only one needs to be chosen. Each LEQ prompt addresses a different period, with one addressing periods 1 & 2, another addressing periods 3 & 4, and a third <b>adressing</b> periods 5 & 6[...]|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the ability of}} the Azimuth Discrimination and Resynthesis algorithm (<b>ADRess)</b> to separate multiple speech signals from two mixtures in a simulation environment. <b>ADRess</b> exploits the spatial signature of each of the contributing speech sources to demix the mixtures. Speech sentences taken from the TIMIT database and noise signals from the NOISEX database were mixed synthetically to create pairs of mixtures. <b>ADRess</b> can exploit the spatial signature of noise and speech sources to remove or isolate them from a mixture. To simulate the spatial location of different sources the relative attenuation and phase difference of each source between the two mixtures were manipulated. This was performed for numerous different angles of arrival so as to robustly test the algorithm. Objective measures and promising informal listening test results show the suitability of <b>ADRess</b> for cleaning noisy speech mixtures and document the performance of <b>ADRess</b> for speech mixtures with different numbers of sources...|$|R

He was noted for <b>adressing</b> the concept of opening Communion under both kinds (e.g. bread and wine; the wine had previously been restricted to priests). Regarding the reception of wine through a common chalice, he raised concerns about health and women's lipstick, saying:"Today the faithful, especially men, can be seen not to come forward to kiss a sacred relic because, among other things, they fear their lips will be colored by the red marks left by women on {{the glass of the}} reliquary. What will happen now when so many hundreds and thousands of dyed lips of women or perhaps hundreds of lips of men which are not proper and pure and sometimes are infected with base sicknesses are applied to the rims of the chalice? The result will be that many of the faithful will abstain from Communion."Yves Congar, the French Dominican theologian, took notice of Xenopulos at the Council, writing in his book My Journey of the Council about Xenopulos, [...] "the name is Greek, but his pronunciation of Latin was typically and entirely Italian." ...|$|E

40|$|You are {{everywhere}} - A {{project on the}} journalistic use of you-adressations This production-thesis is {{an examination of the}} journalistic use of directly <b>adressing</b> recipients such as: 'Do you remember Preben Dalgaard?' 1 or 'Your cat doesn't care about you' 2. This narrative technique {{can be traced back to}} the business communication principle called The You-attitude, which was first described in 1916. Today it is widely used in all forms of written as well as oral communication. My examination of texts from seven Danish newspapers shows that direct <b>adressing</b> of readers can serve several different functions, and I have identified 13 different uses of you-adressations. I use these findings to reflect on my own radio productions in which I have experimented with different ways of <b>adressing</b> the listeners directly, by using 2. person narration such as: 'You are Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. You are 35 years old. You are a composer. ' These productions are inspired by the Ben Lewis documentary Poor Us: An animated History of Poverty which uses 2. person narration. In my analysis I draw on discourse analysts Norman Fairclough and Linda McLoughlin, Umberto Ecos literary theory of the Model Reader and on the journalistic concept identification. These theoretical approaches highlight the diversity and the implications of you-adressations, such as the risk of making false assumptions about the reader.
