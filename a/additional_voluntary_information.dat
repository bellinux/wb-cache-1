40|$|Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the Degree of Master of Business Administration at Strathmore UniversityThe study seeks to test the relationship between corporate employee disclosures and financial performance of the organization. In the recent {{years there has been}} a lot of dissatisfaction with stakeholders relying on mandatory financial disclosures in decision making. Many governing bodies as well as professional bodies have advocated for additional voluntary disclosures in the company’s annual reports. Listed companies are seen to disclose <b>additional</b> <b>voluntary</b> <b>information</b> in order to raise cheap source of capital. An organization that discloses additional information is seen to reduce the level of uncertainty and in turn is able to attract low cost capital from investors. Voluntary disclosures were supported in the study by two major theories that is Agency theory and Legitimacy theory. Most of the prior studies done have focused on the determinants of voluntary disclosures with a few linking the voluntary disclosures with the cost of capital. This study focused on the relationship between corporate employee disclosures and the firm’s financial performance. Employee disclosures were chosen because employees are a key resource to the organization and have an impact on the organization’s bottom line. The study utilized correlational study research design targeting 67 listed companies in the Nairobi Stock Exchange. A sample size of 47 listed companies was chosen for the study. The unit of analysis was the companies. Secondary data was sourced from the companies’ annual reports while the stock performance information was picked from the Nairobi Stock Exchange website and companies’ websites. The data was collected for a period of three years i. e. 2013, 2014 and 2015. The study utilized a multivariate model of analysis. The results of the study revealed that there was a positive and significant relationship between employee disclosures and financial performance of the listed companies. The disclosures varied across industries with the telecommunication and technology industry had the highest level of disclosures. The study contributes to the literature on the demand for employee disclosure as a determinant of financial performance in developing countries. It identifies the level of employee disclosure practices among listed companies in NSE. Moreover, it reveals significant differences among industry sectors. The authors theorized that in developing countries, legitimacy and agency theory have forced companies to embrace voluntary disclosure in order to enhance financial performance. The study was limited in terms of time, disclosures varied across companies and years and the possibility of the independent and dependent variables being measured by more than one variable...|$|E

40|$|Background: To {{maintain}} or increase the {{trust in the}} market, companies can disclose more <b>voluntary</b> <b>information</b> in the annual reports. According to prior research the annual report is {{the primary source of}} information for small shareholders and investors. Thus, it is of interest to investigate why companies chose to report the <b>voluntary</b> <b>information</b> inquired by this group. Purpose: We investigate some company-specific factors to decide whether these determine the extent of <b>voluntary</b> <b>information,</b> particularly inquired by small shareholders and investors, in the annual reports of listed Swedish companies. We also aim to discuss underlying causes for our result. Procedure: With statistical methods we have tested hypotheses on relations between company-specific factors and the extent of <b>voluntary</b> <b>information</b> in the annual reports. Results: It is significant that profitability, industry type and quotation status have relations with the extent of <b>voluntary</b> <b>information</b> inquired by small shareholders and investors. No relations have been found between the extent of voluntary disclosure and company-size, ownership dispersion, investments in tangible assets or share issues...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} if {{the level}} of voluntary disclosure affects the association between current returns and future earnings. Economic theory suggests that firms might find it advantageous to provide additional pieces of <b>information</b> (i. e., <b>voluntary</b> disclosure) to investors and analysts (Verrecchia 1983). Our results indicate that more voluntary disclosure does not improve the association between current returns and future earnings; i. e. current returns do not reflect more future earnings news. This finding raises the question whether <b>voluntary</b> <b>information</b> in the annual report contains value relevant information about future earnings or if investors are simply not capable of incorporating <b>voluntary</b> <b>information</b> in the firm value estimates.

40|$|This study {{examines}} if three hypothesized variables affect {{the extent of}} corporate strategic <b>information,</b> i. e. <b>voluntary</b> <b>information,</b> in corporate annual reports, specifically in Sweden {{in the year of}} 2012. The variables deemed appropriate to the Swedish environment, i. e. firm size, ownership dispersion and performance, were retrieved from previous disclosure research conducted in a Swedish context (Cook, 1989; Adrem, 1999), as well as relevant theoretical consideration. The statistical analysis conducted in this thesis suggests that firm size is significantly positively related to the extent of strategic corporate information in Swedish listed firms’ corporate annual reports. The result hence confirms the expectation that larger listed firms to a larger extent disclose strategic corporate <b>information,</b> i. e. <b>voluntary</b> <b>information,</b> in their corporate annual reports. No positive relation was found between the variables performance or ownership dispersion and the extent of strategic corporate information. The results of this thesis are interpreted to suggest that asymmetric information and agency costs are important determinants of the extent of strategic corporate <b>information,</b> i. e. <b>voluntary</b> <b>information,</b> in Swedish corporate annual reports. Larger firms seem to reduce agency costs and narrow the information asymmetry by increasing the level of information disclosed. ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This paper empirically {{investigates the}} factors that impact <b>voluntary</b> <b>information</b> {{disclosure}} level of Turkish manufacturing companies listed in the Istanbul Stock Exchange (ISE). Design/methodology/approach: The methodology {{of the study is}} content analysis of annual reports of the corporations listed on the ISE for the year 2010. Findings: The findings provide evidence of a positive association between <b>voluntary</b> <b>information</b> disclosure level and the variables such as firm size, auditing firm size, proportion of independent directors on the board, institutional/corporate ownership, and corporate governance. However, leverage and ownership diffusion were found to have negative significant association with the extent of voluntary disclosure. The remaining variables, namely, profitability, listing age, and board size were found to be insignificant. Research limitations/implications: Since this study was conducted solely on listed manufacturing companies, the results may not be generalizable to non-listed and non-manufacturing industries. The study has some implications for firms, auditors, investors, and regulators. All these parties {{play an important role in}} improving the transparency and disclosure practices of corporations.

40|$|Background: Resources {{that are}} hard to put a value on and cannot be {{classified}} as assets in the balance sheet as well as the development towards the information society has led to an increasing need and use for <b>voluntary</b> <b>information</b> in the annual reports. The increase of <b>voluntary</b> <b>information</b> can foremost be seen in the field of human resources. Purpose: The purpose of this thesis is to describe the development of <b>voluntary</b> <b>information</b> about human resources in the annual report of a number of Swedish quoted companies. The purpose is also {{to see if there is}} a difference in the development between manufacturing companies and service companies. Method: Six manufacturing companies and six service companies were chosen from the Stockholm exchange A-list. Using both a qualitative and quantitative research method the annual reports of the chosencompanies were studied for the years 1995, 1997, 1999, 2001, and 2003. A model consisting of seven categories; health, diversity, recruitment, staff turnover and comfort, benefits and motivation, education and competence development, was developed to clarify were the development took place. Conclusions: After finishing the study one can tell that the amount of <b>voluntary</b> <b>information</b> about human resources in the annual report has increased even though the percentage share of the total annual report only has increased appreciably for manufacturing companies. Manufacturing companies and service companies have in common that competence development is the most frequent disclosed information during the period. Information about health has increased, even though the increase is more considerable in the annual reports of manufacturing companies. Differences can be seen between manufacturing companies and service companies in the recruitment category, were manufacturing companies disclose more information. Service companies, on the other hand, disclose more on staff turnover and comfort, diversity and benefits and motivation...|$|R
