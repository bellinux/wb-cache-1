40|$|This paper {{presents}} a global proposal and methodology for developing digital printed electronics (PE) prototypes, circuits and application specific printed electronics circuits (<b>ASPECs).</b> We start from a circuit specification using standard Hardware Description Languages (HDL) and executing its functional simulation. Then we perform logic synthesis that includes logic gate minimization by applying state-of-the-art algorithms embedded in our proposed electronic design automation (EDA) tools {{to minimize the}} number of transistors required to implement the circuit. Later technology mapping is applied, {{taking into account the}} available technology, (i. e., PMOS only technologies) and the cell design style (either Standard Cells or Inkjet Gate Array). These layout strategies are equivalent to those available in application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) flows but adapting them to Printed Electronics, which vary greatly depending on the targeted technology. Then Place & Route tools perform floorplan, placement and wiring of cells, which will be checked by the corresponding layout versus schematic (LVS). Afterwards we execute an electrical simulation including parasitic capacitances and relevant parameters. Finally, we obtain the prototypes which will be characterized and tested. The most important aspect of the proposed methodology is that it is portable to different PE processes, so that considerations and variations between different fabrication processes do not affect the validity of our approach. As final results, we present fabricated prototypes that are currently being characterized and tested...|$|R

The manufacturing industry has recently made good progress nationally in terms of implementation of new environmental methods, but internationally it is still a slow process and requesting further development. The intention of this work was to use environmental methods to streamline and reduce the environmental impact of the production flow at the manufacturing unit of SWEA Electonics in Shanghai and see how useful these environmental methods are.    To meet the intent was conducted a case study of documents, processes and activities in the production line were examined for identification of environmental aspects and value stream analysis for the determination of the organization's current status situation. E-VSM is used to give a visible overview of all the operantions, so it would be easiler to identify the environmental <b>aspecs.</b> Green Performance Map was then used to gain deeper knowledge about the prioritize areas.   The environmental analytical methods proved to be of great use {{in the study of the}} manufacturing company.

40|$|This thesis conducts {{numerical}} {{and experimental}} studies of the nonlinear electrokinetic motion of heterogeneous particles in microfluidic systems and their corresponding applications in laboratory-on-a-chip (LOC) systems. Induced-charge electrokinetic (ICEK) phenomena flow is generated by applying an external electric field to a conducting particle immersed in an aqueous solution. As {{a result of this}} field, micro-vortices form around the conducting particle. Using this phenomenon, many shortcomings of classical electrokinetics (e. g. poor mixing, leakage, back flow problem) can be improved. This thesis proposes and investigates a complete 3 -D numerical multi-physics method to calculate the induced zeta potential on the conducting surface of a heterogeneous object. To model the ICEK motion of a heterogeneous particle in a DC electric field, the moving grid technique is used to conduct the particle-fluid simulation. It was numerically shown that the vortices form near the conducting surface of a particle. Both transitional and rotational motions of heterogeneous particles are investigated. A set of novel experiments are designed and conducted to investigate several <b>aspecs</b> of ICEK. It is demonstrated {{for the first time that}} four vortices form around a conducting sphere in contact with an aqueous solution while the DC electric field is applied. The motions of heterogeneous particles are experimentally studied. The speed of a heterogeneous particle is compared with the same size non-conducting particle under the same experimental conditions and it is shown that the heterogeneous particle moves significantly faster than the non-conducting particle. It is also shown that the micro-vortices on the conducting section of the heterogeneous particle act like an engine and push the particle to move faster. These experiments verify the results of our simulation studies. We introduce three applications for induced-charge electrokinetic phenomena in ths thesis: ICEK micro-valve, ICEK micro-mixer, and ICEK micro-motor, which can be used in microfluidics and lab-on-a-chip devises. This ICEK micro-valve significantly improves many shortcomings of other micro-valves reported in the literature (such as leakage, considerable dead volume and complicated fabrication processes). Our ICEK micro-mixers take the advantages of induced micro-vortices and boost the mixing process in a micro-channel. As a result well mixed homogeneous (100 %) mixture could be obtained at the downstream of the mixer. Our proposed no-contact ICEK micro-motor rotates as long as the DC electric field is being applied. This thesis develops a new understanding of several ICEK phenomena and applications related to heterogeneous particles. The 3 D numerical model developed in this thesis along with the experimental studies are capable of describing the ICEK motion of a heterogeneous particle and is a considerable step to calculate the ICEK phenomena for real-world applications. This thesis, for the first time, experimentally visualized and verified the induced micro-vortices around conducting particles under applied DC electric field. The proposed ICEK micro-mixers, valve and motor can be used in various LOC devices and applications...|$|R
