40|$|The general {{goal of this}} {{discussion}} paper is to contribute toward the further harmonization of human health risk assessment. It first discusses {{the development of a}} formal, harmonized set of <b>assessment</b> <b>factors.</b> The status quo with regard to <b>assessment</b> <b>factors</b> is reviewed, that is, the type of factors to be identified, the range of values assigned, as well as {{the presence or absence of}} a scientific basis for these values. Options are presented for a set of default values and probabilistic distributions for <b>assessment</b> <b>factors</b> based on the state of the art. Methods of combining default values or probabilistic distributions of <b>assessment</b> <b>factors</b> are also described. Second, the effect parameter, the no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL), is discussed. This NOAEL as selected from the toxicological database may be a poor substitute for the unknown, true no-adverse-effect level (NAEL). New developments are presented with respect to the estimation of the NAEL. The already widely discussed Benchmark Dose concept can be extended to obtain an uncertainty distribution of the Critical Effect Dose (CED). This CED distribution can be combined with estimated uncertainty distributions for <b>assessment</b> <b>factors.</b> In this way the full distribution of the Human Limit Value will be derived and not only a point estimate, whereas information on dose-response relations is taken into account. Finally, a strategy is proposed for implementation of the new developments into human health risk assessments...|$|R
50|$|A PNEC {{may also}} be {{statistically}} derived from a SSD which {{is a model of}} the variability in the sensitivity of multiple species to a single toxicant or other stressor. The hazardous concentration for five percent of the species (HC5) in the SSD is used to derive the PNEC. The HC5 is the concentration at which five percent of the species in the SSD exhibit an effect. The HC5 is typically divided by an <b>assessment</b> <b>factor</b> of 1-5. In many cases, SSDs may not exist {{due to the lack of}} data on a large number of species. In these cases, the <b>assessment</b> <b>factor</b> approach to derivation of a PNEC should be used.|$|E
50|$|The use of {{assessment}} factors allows for laboratory, single-species and {{short term toxicity}} data to be extrapolated to conservatively predict ecosystem effects and accounts for the uncertainty in the extrapolation. The value of the <b>assessment</b> <b>factor</b> {{is dependent on the}} uncertainty of the available data and ranges from 1-1000.|$|E
50|$|The Predicted No Effect Concentration (PNEC) is the {{concentration}} of a chemical which marks the limit at which below no adverse effects of exposure in an ecosystem are measured. PNEC values are intended to be conservative and predict {{the concentration}} at which a chemical will likely have no toxic effect. They are not intended to predict the upper limit of concentration of a chemical that has a toxic effect. PNEC values are often used in environmental risk assessment as a tool in ecotoxicology. A PNEC for a chemical can be calculated with acute toxicity or chronic toxicity single-species data, Species Sensitivity Distribution (SSD) multi-species data, field data or model ecosystems data. Depending {{of the type of}} data used, an <b>assessment</b> <b>factor</b> is used to account for the confidence of the toxicity data being extrapolated to an entire ecosystem.|$|E
30|$|For the {{characterisation}} of {{the hazard}} {{with respect to}} risk assessment, PNEC values are required. For conventional chemicals, uncertainty in hazard can be considered using <b>assessment</b> <b>factors</b> [28]. Currently, there are no indications that <b>assessment</b> <b>factors</b> differing from the existing ones are needed for ENMs. For risk assessment, the PNEC values have to be compared with environmental concentrations (PEC). The topic of risk assessment is addressed in the chapters “Overview on the test strategy” and “Risk assessment approaches”.|$|R

Risk assessment is based on NOEC and/or EC 50 values, which are reduced by <b>assessment</b> <b>factors</b> {{to compensate for the}} limited number of test organisms[26]. The use of <b>assessment</b> <b>factors</b> means that the consideration of test concentrations above environmental values is justified. Therefore, it is essential to develop procedures that allow the application of comparably high test concentrations for subsequent risk assessment.|$|R

5000|$|The {{debate about}} U.S. health care {{concerns}} questions of access, efficiency, and quality {{purchased by the}} high sums spent. The World Health Organization (WHO) in 2000 ranked the U.S. health care system first in responsiveness, but 37th in overall performance and 72nd by overall level of health (among 191 member nations included in the study). The WHO study has been criticized by the free market advocate David Gratzer because [...] "fairness in financial contribution" [...] {{was used as an}} <b>assessment</b> <b>factor,</b> marking down countries with high per-capita private or fee-paying health treatment. The WHO study has been criticized, in an article published in Health Affairs, for its failure to include the satisfaction ratings of the general public. The study found that there was little correlation between the WHO rankings for health systems and the stated satisfaction of citizens using those systems. Countries such as Italy and Spain, which were given the highest ratings by WHO were ranked poorly by their citizens while other countries, such as Denmark and Finland, were given low scores by WHO but had the highest percentages of citizens reporting satisfaction with their health care systems. WHO staff, however, say that the WHO analysis does reflect system [...] "responsiveness" [...] and argue that this is a superior measure to consumer satisfaction, which is influenced by expectations. Furthermore, the relationship between patient satisfaction and health care utilization, expenditures, and outcomes is complex and not well defined.|$|E
30|$|The {{size of an}} <b>assessment</b> <b>factor</b> that is used {{to derive}} a PNEC from these tests should cover several {{uncertainties}} such as intra- and interspecies variations, short- to long-term toxicity extrapolation, intra- and inter-laboratory variation or laboratory-to-field extrapolation [3, 14]. An <b>assessment</b> <b>factor</b> of 1000 is applied on the lowest effect value of acute tests from the three trophic levels of algae, invertebrates, and fish if only data from acute testing are available. This <b>assessment</b> <b>factor</b> can be refined to 100, 50, or 10 if the values of NOECs are available from long-term tests covering one, two, or three trophic levels, respectively [4, 7, 8]. Although not explicitly mentioned the procedure implies an acute-to-chronic extrapolation factor of 100 based on the difference of the <b>assessment</b> <b>factor</b> on the acute L(E)C 50 value (1000) and the chronic NOEC (10) if data are available for three trophic levels.|$|E

40|$|For human risk assessment, {{experimental}} data {{often have to}} be extrapolated for exposure duration, which is generally done by means of default values. The {{purpose of the present}} study was twofold. First, to derive a statistical distribution for differences in exposure duration that can be used in a probabilistic concept for combining <b>assessment</b> <b>factors</b> in risk characterization. Second, to obtain insight in the magnitude of the change in No-Observed-Adverse-Effect-Level (NOAEL) with exposure duration, which will lead to more science-based <b>assessment</b> <b>factors</b> for exposure duration. A large historical database, including 198 substances, was consulted. Ratios were calculated for pairs of NOAELs for systemic toxicity from oral toxicity studies with the same species (rats or mice, various strains) and different exposure duration categories. The Geometric Mean (GM), Geometric Standard Deviation (GSD), and the 90 th and 95 th percentile values were determined. The traditionally applied default factors for subacute to semichronic (10), for semichronic to chronic (10), and for subacute to chronic exposure (100) corresponded with the 93, 87, and 99 -percentiles of the respective distributions. Options are presented for a set of default values and probabilistic distributions for <b>assessment</b> <b>factors</b> for exposure duration based on data from the consulted historical database...|$|R
30|$|To {{account for}} {{uncertainties}} associated with extrapolating from testing plant {{individuals in the}} greenhouse to plant communities in the field, an <b>assessment</b> <b>factor</b> may be applied. However, {{the appropriateness of the}} <b>assessment</b> <b>factor</b> can be debated as currently there is no reference tier that would allow for calibration. Extending the standard ecotoxicological tests for non-target terrestrial plants under worst-case greenhouse conditions to more realistic field conditions or community level is not feasible. Not only reproducibility is a major constraint, but there is also the question of representativeness of higher tier studies for different landscapes under different climatic conditions. Additional data are needed to reduce uncertainty associated with predicting the potential long-term impacts on non-target terrestrial plant communities from short-term individual-level greenhouse studies.|$|E

RAPATAC In Gävle Level: Final {{assignment}} for Bachelor Degree in Business Administration Authors: Peiying Kuang and Zhonglv Song Supervisor: Dr. Maria Fregidou-Malama Examiner: Jonas Kågström  Date: 2013 May Aim: The {{purpose of this}} study is to investigate the factors that influence social enterprises to access funding. Method: This study has chosen a social enterprise as a single case study. We design the questions and collect the data based on five <b>assessment</b> <b>factors</b> from both the social enterprise and funders’ perspective. We use interview and questionnaires to investigate whether these five <b>assessment</b> <b>factors</b> influence funders’ decision.       Result and Conclusions: In our study, we found that five <b>assessment</b> <b>factors</b> could influence the funders’ decision. Social mission and the qualities of the leader are crucial factors influencing funding decisions. The performance of SE, financing sustainability and communication transparence influence social enterprise to maintain a long-term relationship with funders.   Suggestion for further studies: This investigation based on a single case study in Gavle, and we have collected data from a limited number of responders. Thus, we suggest using multiple case studies and collecting data from more responders. The further study should not be limited to one city. Contribution of the thesis: Our theoretical contribution is providing a model to complete theory. This model includes five factors which affecting funding of social enterprise. In managerial aspect, both current and potential social entrepreneurs can refer to these five <b>assessment</b> <b>factors</b> to improve their competence to attract funders. For the societal implication, this study shows the value and challenge of social enterprise to people and government, which enhance the public recognition of the social enterprise.

40|$|Risk {{assessment}} approaches {{within the}} regulatory framework of the European Union (EU) based on single species tests were compared to those using data from terrestrial model ecosystems (TMEs). In a case study with the fungicide carbendazim, single species data led to ratios of the predicted environmental concentration (PEC) and predicted no effect concentration (PNEC) of above 1000, depending on available data and related assessment factors, indicating concern for the terrestrial environment. Considering {{the high degree of}} realism of the TME studies with multiple endpoints measured, but also residual uncertainty related to higher variability of endpoints, an <b>assessment</b> <b>factor</b> of 5 was applied on TME data. The most sensitive reliable endpoint was earthworm biomass.

40|$|The Scientific Panel on Plant Health, Plant Protection Products {{and their}} Residues (PPR Panel) {{was asked by}} EFSA for an opinion on the {{possibility}} of refining the acute and chronic aquatic risk assessment of pesticides by lowering the <b>assessment</b> <b>factor</b> if additional species were tested. In particular, the PPR Panel was asked how these values could be reduced when additional singlespecies studies are available whilst still maintaining the same level of protection as foreseen in the Directive 91 / 414 /EEC. The current approach for acute and chronic risk assessment to protect the ecosystem against adverse effects of pesticides uses the lowest available toxicity value from laboratory standard toxicity tests, i. e. the most sensitive tested species, and divides this value by a fixed <b>assessment</b> <b>factor.</b> This results in an increase of conservatism when more species are tested and does not reflect the increased certainty that more data provide. To answer this question the PPR Panel reviewed existing literature, guidance documents, and data. Statistical calculations based on species sensitivity distributions were used to develop a range of options for adjusting the risk assessment when more species are tested. The PPR Panel assessed the current level of protection and found that it is not equal for different taxonomic groups and for different substances. On average, the level of protection provided by the current approach is, for example, markedly higher for fish than for crustaceans and insects. The PPR Panel identified a range of possible methods either to maintain at least the current unspecified level of protection, or to achieve any specified level of protection. For taxonomic groups where the legislation requires only one species (e. g. crustaceans), this effectively sets the level of protection in the effects assessment. When additional species are tested, the same average level of protection can be maintained by taking the geometric mean (rather than the lowest value) and dividing by the current <b>assessment</b> <b>factor.</b> For fish, where the legislation requires that at least two species are tested, this implies a higher level of protection in the effects assessment. In this case, a different procedure is required when additional species are tested. The minimum is then replaced by the second or third lowest toxicity value depending on the sample size available, and divided by the current <b>assessment</b> <b>factor.</b> The Panel described three further approaches that allow a particular level of protection to be achieved, provided such a level is specified. These methods involve using a modified <b>assessment</b> <b>factor</b> that incorporates an estimate of the variation between species, which can either be specific to the substance under consideration or derived from existing information on related substances. These three methods relate only to uncertainty due to variation between species. Any other uncertainties that are relevant to the assessment would need to be accounted for separately...|$|E

40|$|Current Technical Guidance Documents for {{preparing}} risk assessments, like the guidance {{for the implementation}} of REACH, have limited focus on chemical substances in the particulate form and generally do not focus on substances in the nanoform. Within the ENRHES project a comprehensive and critical scientific review of publicly available health and safety information on four types of nanoparticles was performed. Based on the identified exposure and hazard data, basic human health risk assessment appraisals were carried out for fullerenes, carbon nanotubes, nano-silver and nano-titanium dioxide. These risk assessment appraisals followed the structure of a regulatory risk assessment and if possible and relevant, it was attempted to derive indicative human no-effect levels from key studies by applying <b>assessment</b> <b>factors</b> as suggested in the technical guidance document for REACH.
