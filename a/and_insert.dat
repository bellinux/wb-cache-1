5|$|In contrast, Akira Iritani, at the Kyoto University in Japan, {{plans to}} fully clone a mammoth by somatic cell nuclear transfer. He intends {{to take a}} cell nucleus from {{the remains of a}} mammoth found in Yakutia, Russia, <b>and</b> <b>insert</b> it into an African {{elephant}}'s egg cell that have had their DNA removed, to create an embryo and then implant the embryo into a female African elephant for surrogate mother. However, nobody has yet found a viable mammoth cell with intact DNA, and most scientists doubt that any living cell could have survived freezing in the tundra.|$|E
5|$|Invertebrate predators include crabs, starfish and octopuses. Crabs {{crack the}} shells with their pincers and starfish use their water {{vascular}} system {{to force the}} valves apart and then insert part of their stomach between the valves to digest the bivalve's body. It has been found experimentally that both crabs and starfish preferred molluscs that are attached by byssus threads to ones that are cemented to the substrate. This was probably because they could manipulate the shells and open them more easily when they could tackle them from different angles. Octopuses either pull bivalves apart by force, or they bore a hole into the shell <b>and</b> <b>insert</b> a digestive fluid before sucking out the liquified contents.|$|E
5000|$|Pectoral muscles: {{there are}} 4 pectorals, {{and they all}} {{function}} in adduction of the limb. The pectoralis descendens (cranial superficial pectoral) originates from the cariniform cartilage of the sternum, <b>and</b> <b>inserts</b> into the humerus. The pectoralis transversus (transverse superficial pectoral) originates from the ventral side of the sternum <b>and</b> <b>inserts</b> on the proximal third of the horse's forearm. The largest of the pectorals, the pectoralis profundus (caudal deep pectoral), originates on the caudal side of the sternum, <b>and</b> <b>inserts</b> into the humerus and onto the tendon of the coracobrachialis muscle. The pectoralis ascendens (caudal superficial pectoral), or the subclavius, originates on the cranial side of the sternum, <b>and</b> <b>inserts</b> into the dorsal side of the supraspinatus muscle.|$|R

5|$|Nolan North, {{the voice}} actor who played Drake, {{had a large}} role in {{defining}} the character's physical and vocal reactions. In the Uncharted series, the actors were used for motion capture, and acted as if performing in a movie. Motion capture was done on a soundstage, and the dialog recorded during this process was used in the game. North was allowed to ad-lib dialog <b>and</b> <b>insert</b> aspects of his own personality into the character. In naming the character, the development team considered many different choices, including Ethan, Samuel, and John. Matthew Drake was seriously contemplated, but received a poor reaction from those it was presented to. Eventually, Naughty Dog settled on the name Nathan for its ability to be shortened to Nate, and the perception that it sounded historical. Drake's character design changed little between Drake's Fortune and Among Thieves.|$|E
5|$|The Red Wings brought Pronovost to Detroit at the {{conclusion}} of his USHL season. Gordie Howe had suffered a serious injury early in Detroit's 1950 Stanley Cup Playoff series against the Toronto Maple Leafs forcing the team to move Red Kelly to forward <b>and</b> <b>insert</b> Pronovost into the lineup at defence. He made his NHL debut on April 6, 1950, in the fifth game of the series. Pronovost appeared in nine playoff games as Detroit eliminated the Maple Leafs then came back from a 3–2 series deficit in the final and defeated the New York Rangers in the final two games of the series to win the Stanley Cup.|$|E
5|$|With the Indian Division committed, Montgomery {{decided to}} raise the stakes further by {{bringing}} the British 5th Infantry Division from the relatively tranquil XIII Corps front in the high mountains on the left wing of the 8th Army <b>and</b> <b>insert</b> them between the New Zealand and Indian Divisions. This would allow the Indian division to narrow and concentrate their attack and give Montgomery four divisions to continue the attack between Orsogna and the sea. By 12 December, the British 17th Infantry Brigade—the first of 5th Division's brigades—was in place and under the New Zealand division's command. Once 5th Division headquarters and its other brigades had arrived, these two left hand divisions were to be organised {{under the command of}} XIII Corps, commanded by Lieutenant-General Miles Dempsey.|$|E
