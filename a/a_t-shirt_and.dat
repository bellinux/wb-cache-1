5|$|Naughty Dog based Drake's {{appearance}} and personality on daredevil Johnny Knoxville, actor Harrison Ford, and {{the heroes of}} pulp magazines, novels and films. To make him relatable, the character was dressed in jeans and <b>a</b> <b>T-shirt,</b> <b>and</b> given an everyman persona; he is strong-willed, and often jokes and quips. The designers focused on giving him realistic reactions to his environment; for example, he stumbles while running, barely clears objects during leaps, and recognizes the absurdity of the situations in which he finds himself.|$|E
5|$|The visual {{is almost}} {{six and a}} half minutes long. As the video begins, waves are seen {{crashing}} on a night time beach. Nearly a minute later, Beyoncé appears; she is strolling on a beach at night and she seemingly carries a massive trophy while an eerie music is playing in the background. Sporting a sheer negligee that reveals her bra and panties beneath, she twists her body in the sand. The singer also dances seductively against a backdrop of smoke and mouths the song's lyrics, staring at the camera. Beyoncé is later joined by husband Jay-Z, who is wearing <b>a</b> <b>T-shirt</b> <b>and</b> a backwards baseball cap. He raps with his eyes down holding a glass with alcohol in his hand while Beyoncé mouths the words behind him, smiling. The last seconds of the video show Beyoncé dancing and it concludes with close-up shots of the singer's face.|$|E

25|$|The Battle of Saret Koheh {{made good}} on the threats of the “Night Letter” posted in Kamdesh {{beginning}} the campaign season of 2007. It also confronted Lieutenant Colonel Kolenda commanding American forces {{in the area in}} Naray, with the fact that COIN operations in Nuristan were facing a crisis. AAF operations in the area were expanding, involving a greater proportion of the local population, and were being supported by Taliban organizations in Pakistan. American forces were strung out in a thinly held and poorly supplied picket line from Naray to Kamdesh along the Landay-Sin River. The American forces were too outnumbered to survive in sustained combat with the local population. Something had to be done to put the Americans and the Afghans of Nuristan on the same side. The first effort in a new COIN campaign was made by First Lieutenant Dave Roller. He decided that the appearance of American soldiers in their “battle rattle” war gear gave the impression of soulless killing machines. Encased in armor, helmets, and weapons, Americans appeared to be looking for a fight. As a contrast Dave attended his next meeting with the Kamdesh village leaders dressed in <b>a</b> <b>T-shirt</b> <b>and</b> shorts. When he spoke to them he discussed their common values as leaders of families and communities working toward a better future for their children. Mawlawi Abdul Rahman of Kamdesh was a local elder much impressed with this new approach. He began building a consensus of village elders in support of the Afghan government. Through {{the rest of the summer}} and fall of 2008, Captain Joey Hutto, the new commander of COP Keating, and his troops expanded this initiative. Hutto had worked for years on COIN campaigns in Central America, and put his skills to good use in Nuristan.|$|E

Adverts for the game were also featured in several gaming magazines, including Sega Saturn Magazine and Electronic Gaming Monthly. In November 1997, a promotional sweepstakes contest was held by Electronic Gaming Monthly, in which contestants mailed in via postcard in order to win a copy of the game along with various different pieces of Croc-themed apparel, including a suede/wool jacket, a leather backpack, <b>a</b> <b>t-shirt,</b> <b>and</b> a baseball cap. An official strategy guide for the game, written by Anthony James, was published by Prima Games in 1997.|$|E

500|$|Creating the Kim Possible {{universe}} and environment {{was very much}} a collaborative process between Schooley and McCorkle, Disney Channel, the character designers and cast, who were also encouraged to contribute their own ideas. Although Schooley and McCorkle participated in designing Kim, the majority of that particular task was the combined efforts of Loter, inaugural season director Chris Bailey, art director Alan Bodner and character designer Stephen Silver, each of whom had worked together on previous animated projects. Due to their extensive animation experience, Schooley and McCorkle were aware that [...] "Kim had to be an appealing character", while Ron would be more-so [...] "goofy-appealing". Evolving dramatically over the course of three months, Kim, who had originally been designed to resemble a [...] "standard" [...] athletic-looking blonde heroine, underwent several changes. At one point, the character's appearance was based on that of video game character Lara Croft from the Tomb Raider franchise until Disney Channel abandoned this concept in favor of one more akin to that of a 14 year-old girl as opposed to a bombshell. Admitting that Kim would have been their dream girl in high school, the creators joked, [...] "She would have been way out of our class though." [...] A super suit designed for the character was introduced in earily Season 4 but quickly abandoned once the writers realized that the costume would detract from the character's established [...] "she can do anything" [...] reputation. However, her original mission outfit consisting of a crop top and cargo pants is permanently replaced by <b>a</b> <b>T-shirt</b> <b>and</b> pants. Meanwhile, the outfits of Team Impossible were influenced by the X-men's [...] "classic" [...] blue and gold uniforms.|$|E

Non-members who practice with ARMA study groups are encouraged to wear <b>a</b> white <b>T-shirt</b> <b>and</b> black sweatpants. ARMA members of Provost rank wear instead <b>a</b> black <b>T-shirt</b> with red pants. (Senior students may also assume this uniform when offering instruction at official seminars.) There is also a recognized but optional ARMA formal [...] "dress uniform," [...] which consists of period-style clothing in the same color scheme.|$|R

500|$|For Kilgrave, Maslansky used many suits {{created by}} {{designer}} Paul Smith, rather than custom-making {{them as she}} originally planned, as Smith [...] "was [...] about purple" [...] in the previous fashion season. On the suits, Maslansky added that the designers [...] "wanted {{to find a place}} where we could utilize clothing in shades of purple, but not go so over the top that it would look silly and that he would stop feeling ominous or menacing." [...] Expanding on this, Maslansky called purple a traditionally [...] "fairly friendly color, and he’s anything but friendly. So I had to find ways to make him be ominous and frightening and terrifying. I found that I needed the right proportion of shades of purple to other shades that were similar: navy, black, maroon." [...] Maslansky felt Luke Cage was also someone [...] "who wears his clothing like an armor," [...] with his wardrobe consisting of T-shirts, jeans, leather jackets or an army jacket. For a character like Trish Walker, who does not {{have the same kind of}} [...] "statement costume" [...] as Jones, Maslansky tried to create a certain character style. Maslansky said that Walker's uniform is fashion, so [...] "even when she was hanging around the house, she was wearing a pair of rag & bone jeans with a Chloé top, and this was her version of <b>a</b> <b>T-shirt</b> <b>and</b> jeans." [...] Maslansky added that Robin was [...] "a blast to dress" [...] because of her [...] "quirky" [...] personality, yet she was still able to [...] "put herself together aesthetically." [...] For Malcolm, as his story progressively became brighter throughout the season, so did his wardrobe, becoming [...] "a little brighter and a little more hopeful." ...|$|E
500|$|Aware of {{what does}} {{and does not}} work in {{television}} animation, Schooley and McCorkle knew that Kim needed to be a physically attractive character. Kim's appearance evolved dramatically {{over the course of}} three months. The character was originally designed to look like [...] "a pretty standard-looking athletic blonde", which was gradually changed in favor of a more distinctive appearance. At one point, Kim's design was based on that of video game character Lara Croft from Tomb Raider. However, the Disney Channel eventually determined that Lara [...] "is ... not a very real character." [...] Finally, the creators decided to give Kim a more realistic appearance akin to that of a 14-year-old girl as opposed to a bombshell, concluding, [...] "She has a nice, very appealing design, but we just wanted to keep it out of that realm of video game heroine." [...] The creators admitted that Kim would have been their [...] "dream girl" [...] in high school, joking, [...] "She would have been way out of our class though." [...] Director Chris Baily wanted Kim to be designed with [...] "graphic sensibilities" [...] {{similar to those of the}} show's backgrounds, creating a 3D character [...] "whose feet can be planted on the ground and communicate a sense of space." [...] For example, when the character is dressed in all-black, Kim was drawn without a white outline so that she virtually disappears when she moves in front of a black background, yet her [...] "simple design" [...] and flesh allows audiences to [...] "fill in where her body is" [...] naturally. The show's female characters are the only characters drawn with lips, only the upper of which is visible. Describing Kim as [...] "a mostly graphic heroine", Animation: A World History: Volume III: Contemporary Times author Giannalberto Bendazzi agreed that the character's [...] "limited animation" [...] was intentional. In the fourth season, the character's signature crop top and cargo pants are replaced by <b>a</b> <b>T-shirt</b> <b>and</b> pants because the former outfit was damaged during a fight with Shego. Some viewers noted that Kim's face appeared to be [...] "rounder" [...] than it had been drawn in previous seasons. Kim was animated by Rough Draft Korea.|$|E

2500|$|It {{has been}} speculated that Del Naja is {{responsible}} for creating the artwork attributed to the noted graffiti artist Banksy. In a 2017 segment on the Distraction Pieces podcast, guest DJ Goldie commented on Bansky's work: 'Give me a bubble letter {{and put it on}} <b>a</b> <b>T-shirt</b> <b>and</b> write “Banksy” on it and we’re sorted. We can sell it now... No disrespect to Robert, I think he is a brilliant artist. I think he has flipped the world of art over.' The last name of the 'Robert' mentioned was never given, but because of Goldie's friendship with Del Naja, it is highly possible Del Naja was being referenced.|$|E
2500|$|During {{that year}} they {{recorded}} a track, [...] "Headlines", {{which had been}} co-written by Cheney and Owen. The group sent <b>a</b> <b>T-shirt</b> <b>and</b> demo tape to Green Day guitarist and lead vocalist, Billie Joe Armstrong, and landed a support slot for the 1995 Australian tour by his band, Green Day. After that tour, The Living End recorded additional tracks for their debut extended play, Hellbound, which received moderate support from community radio stations. It was produced by the group and included [...] "Headlines" [...] from the previous year. Ed Nimmervoll, an Australian musicologist, described the EP's sound: [...] "they turned their back on '50s rock revivalism and adapted that instrumentation to original songs steeped in UK punk".|$|E
2500|$|According to Bhutto biographer Shyam Bhatia, Bhutto had {{a desire}} to be liked and to be popular, and for this reason [...] "was {{prepared}} to {{be all things to all}} people", having a [...] "chameleon-like" [...] quality to blend into her environment. He for instance noted that while in Pakistan she presented herself as a conservative Muslim [...] who always wore her head covered, while as a student in Oxford she adopted a more liberal lifestyle, tending to wear <b>a</b> <b>T-shirt</b> <b>and</b> jeans and occasionally drinking wine. Muñoz concurred, describing Bhutto as [...] "a woman of contradictions". As a politician, she was conscious of how her image was presented in Pakistan; she dressed modestly, was never photographed with a glass lest it be interpreted as containing alcohol, and would refuse to shake men's hands.|$|E

2500|$|Jeremy had the {{nickname}} [...] "The Hedgehog" [...] bestowed upon him by fellow porn actor Bill Margold in 1979 after a {{situation on the}} set of the porn film Olympic Fever. Jeremy flew in from New York to shoot the movie. Expecting warm California weather, he wore only <b>a</b> <b>T-shirt</b> <b>and</b> shorts and brought no additional clothing. During the long motorcycle ride to the set, located near Lake Arrowhead in the California mountains, the weather deteriorated to blizzard conditions, which chilled him to the point of near hypothermia. Upon arriving at the set, Jeremy was immediately whisked away to thaw out in a hot shower. When he finished, his skin had taken on a pinkish hue from the temperature extremes, and all the many hairs on his body were standing on end. Margold's comment upon seeing Jeremy at that moment was [...] "You are a hedgehog, my friend. A walking, talking hedgehog." ...|$|E
2500|$|Capaldi's costume has {{varied in}} some episodes. In [...] "Mummy on the Orient Express" [...] he dons a period-appropriate tuxedo. [...] In [...] "The Magician's Apprentice", he wears Ray-Ban {{sunglasses}} (later revealed in [...] "The Witch's Familiar" [...] to be a wearable {{version of his}} sonic screwdriver), <b>a</b> <b>T-shirt</b> <b>and</b> plaid baggy trousers along with the hoodie and Crombie coat. In [...] "Face the Raven", the Twelfth Doctor sports a red velvet variant of his Crombie coat. After briefly ditching it in [...] "Hell Bent", Clara comments that it made him look more 'doctory'. At {{the end of the}} episode, he dons the red coat in honour of her, and is given a new sonic screwdriver by the TARDIS. In the ending segment of [...] "The Husbands of River Song", the Doctor again dons the same tuxedo and period dress worn in [...] "Mummy on the Orient Express". In [...] "Thin Ice", the Doctor dons a dark blue velvet suit and a top hat while visiting London in 1814.|$|E
2500|$|On February 3, Bonin {{drove from}} Downey to Hollywood {{in the company}} of 18-year-old Gregory Matthews Miley with the {{specific}} intention of committing a further murder. The pair encountered a 15-year-old named Charles Miranda standing close to the Starwood nightclub, hitchhiking along Santa Monica Boulevard. According to Miley, Bonin and Miranda engaged in consensual sexual activity {{in the rear of the}} van as he drove, before Bonin then whispered to him (Miley), [...] "Kid's going to die." [...] Miranda was then overpowered and bound by Bonin, who then asked the youth how much money he had in his possession. When Miranda responded he had [...] "about $6", Bonin ordered Miley to take the youth's wallet, before raping his victim. Miley also attempted to rape the youth, but was unable to sustain an erection. In frustration, Miley assaulted Miranda with various sharp objects, before assisting Bonin in beating the youth. Bonin then strangled Miranda to death with <b>a</b> <b>T-shirt</b> <b>and</b> a tire iron as Miley repeatedly jumped on his (Miranda's) chest. His nude corpse was then dumped in an alleyway alongside East Second Street in Los Angeles.|$|E
