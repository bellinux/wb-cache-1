5|$|June 23, 2001: An {{isolated}} supercell produced three tornadoes in the state. The first, an F1, hit a {{golf course}} in Washington, demolishing <b>a</b> <b>storage</b> building and a tennis court, and injuring one person. The second tornado, rated an F2, touched down in Torrington near Torrington Middle School, damaging the roof and destroying bleachers and <b>a</b> <b>storage</b> shed. The final tornado, an F0, produced minor damage to the East Hartland fire station.|$|E

5|$|The {{basement}} of the house initially served as the wine storage area. In 1867, the family had a one-and-a-half-story brick winery constructed. After 1900, when wine grapes were no longer grown commercially, this building served as <b>a</b> <b>storage</b> room. Rübel later converted it to a museum for Ramona visitors, complete with Del Valle family artifacts. In the 21st century it is used for storage of farm equipment and automobiles.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} {{was also used}} as <b>a</b> <b>storage</b> facility for the park. During HalloWeekends, much of the original queue area was used to house a haunt attraction. It was first used in 1997 for the haunt, Cedar Point Cemetery. In 2000, it was transformed into the Egyptian themed, Pharaoh's Secret haunted house. In 2009, it was transformed into Happy Jack's Toy Factory, a haunted toy factory.|$|E

40|$|Distributed storage {{systems are}} {{becoming}} more and more popular with the rapidly increasing demand for large-scale data storage. To increase the capacity and I/O performance of <b>a</b> distributed <b>storage</b> system, scaling it up is a common method. Regenerating Codes are a class of distributed storage codes that offer good reliability through encoding and provide good bandwidth cost on failed nodes repairing. This paper studies the scaling problem of E-MSR codes based distributed storage systems with fixed number of redundancy codes. We generate the encoding matrices of <b>an</b> <b>storage</b> system carefully from the encoding matrices of <b>an</b> <b>storage</b> system to minimize the changes of encoded blocks when scaling. Therefore the system can be scaled up with relatively low bandwidth cost and computation cost...|$|R

5|$|According to Pfälzner, a final burial stage can be noticed, {{which he}} calls the {{quaternary}} burial. Tomb VII, which most probably contained remains {{taken out of the}} royal hypogeum, seems to have worked as <b>a</b> <b>storage</b> for the remains of individuals whose Kispu cycle came to an end; very few bowls were found in that tomb. The Kispu was important for demonstrating the legitimacy of the king, thus it needed to be public and visible to a large crowd; Pfälzner suggests that hall A in the royal palace was the place for the public Kispu and that the antechamber of the royal hypogeum was dedicated for private Kispu that included only the king and the spirits of his ancestors.|$|E

5|$|After being decommissioned, Coalhouse Fort was leased {{and used}} as <b>a</b> <b>storage</b> {{facility}} by Bata Shoes, which operated the nearby Bata shoe factory in East Tilbury. It was also used for a while for emergency housing for demobilised servicemen and their families. In 1959, the parade ground {{was used as a}} coal store during a miners' strike. Thurrock Urban District Council (now Thurrock Council) purchased the fort in 1962 and still own it. The council turned the area around the fort into a riverside park but the building itself decayed badly through neglect and vandalism.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} Cornell, O'Neill {{accepted}} {{a position as}} an instructor at Princeton University. There he started his research into high-energy particle physics. In 1956, his second year of teaching, he published a two-page article that theorized that the particles produced by a particle accelerator could be stored {{for a few seconds}} in <b>a</b> <b>storage</b> ring. The stored particles could then be directed to collide with another particle beam. This would increase the energy of the particle collision over the previous method, which directed the beam at a fixed target. His ideas were not immediately accepted by the physics community.|$|E
5|$|After {{the school}} closed in 1953, the larger, {{original}} room was {{converted into a}} bus garage by the Chana School District. A large garage door was cut into {{the building and the}} floor completely removed. The smaller, 1893 room became <b>a</b> <b>storage</b> area. In 1962, the Chana School District ran out of room and used the building as an overflow classroom. By the mid-1960s, the Chana District folded and was absorbed by the Oregon School District. Residents were allowed to remove any items from the school after the district shut down.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} implementation of <b>a</b> mobile <b>storage</b> system called <b>a</b> PersonalRAID. PersonalRAID manages a number of disconnected storage devices. At {{the heart of a}} PersonalRAID system is <b>a</b> mobile <b>storage</b> device that transparently propagates data to ensure eventual consistency. Using this mobile device, a PersonalRAID provides the abstraction of <b>a</b> single coherent <b>storage</b> name space that is available everywhere, and it ensures reliability by maintaining data redundancy on <b>a</b> number of <b>storage</b> devices. One central aspect of the PersonalRAID design is that the entire storage system consists solely of <b>a</b> collection of <b>storage</b> logs; the log-structured design not only provides an e#cient means for update propagation, but also allows e#cient direct I/O accesses to the logs without incurring unnecessary log replay delays. The PersonalRAID prototype demonstrates that the system provides the desired transparency and reliability functionalities without imposing any serious performance penalty on <b>a</b> mobile <b>storage</b> user...|$|R

The capital cost is higher, as such a system requires somewhat larger chillers than those from <b>a</b> partial <b>storage</b> system, and <b>a</b> larger ice <b>storage</b> system. Ice storage systems are inexpensive enough that full storage systems are often competitive with conventional air conditioning designs.|$|R

5|$|By {{the early}} 1990s, compact discs were making {{significant}} headway as <b>a</b> <b>storage</b> medium {{for music and}} video games. NEC {{had been the first}} to use compact disc technology in a video game console with their PC Engine CD-ROM² System add-on in October 1988 in Japan (launched in North America as the TurboGrafx-CD the following year), which sold 80,000 units in six months. That same year, Nintendo announced a partnership with Sony to develop its own CD-ROM peripheral for the Super NES. Commodore International released their CD-based CDTV multimedia system centered in early 1991, while long-in-waiting CD-i from Philips finally arrived towards the end of that year.|$|E
5|$|Charging {{an empty}} dive {{cylinder}} also causes a temperature rise as the gas inside the cylinder is compressed by the inflow of higher pressure gas, though this temperature rise may initially be tempered because compressed gas from <b>a</b> <b>storage</b> bank {{at room temperature}} decreases in temperature when it decreases in pressure, so at first the empty cylinder is charged with cold gas, but {{the temperature of the}} gas in the cylinder then increases to above ambient as the cylinder fills to the working pressure.|$|E

Badly worn out, she returned to Germany in March 1914 and was removed from service. In 1916, she was converted into <b>a</b> <b>storage</b> hulk for mines.
