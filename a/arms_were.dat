5|$|Notable arms {{attributed}} to biblical figures include {{the arms of}} Jesus based on the instruments of the Passion, and the shield of the Trinity. Medieval literature attributed coats of arms to the Nine Worthies, including Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar, and King Arthur. <b>Arms</b> <b>were</b> given to many kings predating heraldry, including Edward the Confessor and William I of England. These attributed <b>arms</b> <b>were</b> sometimes used in practice as quarterings {{in the arms of}} their descendants.|$|E
5|$|Some {{attributed}} <b>arms</b> <b>were</b> {{incorporated into}} the quarterings of their descendants' arms. The quarterings for the family of Lloyd of Stockton, for instance, include numerous arms originally attributed to Welsh chieftains from the 9th century or earlier (Neubecker, 94). In a similar vein, <b>arms</b> <b>were</b> attributed to Pope Leo IX based on the later arms of his family's descendants (Turner, 415).|$|E

A computer-controlled mechanical <b>arm</b> <b>is</b> called a robotic arm. However, a robotic <b>arm</b> <b>is</b> {{just one of many}} types of different mechanical arms.|$|R

5|$|Tyrannosaur {{arms are}} short when {{compared}} to other known predators. Horner argues that the <b>arms</b> <b>were</b> too short to make the necessary gripping force to hold on to prey.|$|E
5|$|A 2007 study {{suggested}} that Massospondylus {{may have used}} its short arms for defense against predators ("defensive swats"), in intraspecies combat, or in feeding, although its <b>arms</b> <b>were</b> too short to reach its mouth. Scientists speculate that Massospondylus could have used its large pollex (thumb) claw in combat, to strip plant material from trees, digging, or for grooming.|$|E

5|$|Both a {{small and}} large coat of arms existed from 1949 until 1957 based on {{representations}} of them prior to 1936. In 1957 both the large and small city coat of <b>arms</b> <b>were</b> newly arranged by the designer Eduard Ege. At the same time, the city council set the resolution on the December 17, 1957 that the large one was no longer for official use but only for particular representative purposes.|$|E

5|$|In 1938, Y.Kobayasi {{reported}} the form L.mokusin f. sinensis, {{which he said}} differed from the main species in having a head that was more angular and conical at the top; the form sinensis was also reported in Korea in 1995. Some authors have attempted to define forms of L.mokusin as new species based {{on the degree of}} separation of the apical arms. For example, to contrast with his concept of Lysurus in which the <b>arms</b> <b>were</b> either free or slightly fused, the genus Lloydia was created by Chow in 1935 to contain species in which the tips of the <b>arms</b> <b>were</b> fused. As a result of various differing interpretations of the limits of L.mokusin, and the desire of some authors to define new species based on perceived differences, the fungus has acquired a lengthy list of synonyms over the years.|$|E
5|$|In the 16th and 17th centuries, {{additional}} <b>arms</b> <b>were</b> {{attributed to}} {{a large number of}} saints, kings and popes, especially those from the 11th and 12th centuries. Pope Innocent IV (1243–1254) is the first pope whose personal coat of arms is known with certainty (Pastoreau 1997a, 283–284). By the end of the 17th century, the use of attributed arms became more restrained (Neubecker, 224).|$|E

5|$|Saint Michael the Archangel appears {{often in}} heraldic settings.

5|$|The <b>arms</b> <b>were</b> {{confirmed}} by the College of Arms on 19 June 1948, {{and at the same}} time the crest (a mermaid supporting an anchor and holding a cannonball) was granted. Following local government reorganisation in 1974, the 1948 <b>arms</b> <b>were</b> transferred to Poole Borough Council. In 1976, the council received the grant of supporters for the coat of arms. The supporters refer to important charters given to the town; to the left is a gold lion holding a long sword representing William Longespee who in 1248 granted the town's first charter; on the right is a dragon derived from the Royal Arms of Elizabeth I who granted Poole county corporate status in 1568. The Latin motto – Ad Morem Villae De Poole, means: According to the Custom of the Town of Poole, and derives from the Great Charter of 1568.|$|E
