5|$|The {{middle ear}} is {{supplied}} by the mastoid branch of either the occipital or posterior auricular arteries and the deep auricular <b>artery,</b> {{a branch of the}} maxillary <b>artery.</b> Other arteries which are present but play a smaller role include branches of the middle meningeal <b>artery,</b> ascending pharyngeal <b>artery,</b> internal carotid <b>artery,</b> and the <b>artery</b> of the pterygoid canal.|$|E
5|$|If the {{dissection}} of the <b>artery</b> {{extends to}} {{the part of the}} <b>artery</b> that lies inside the skull, subarachnoid hemorrhage may occur (1% of cases). This arises due to rupture of the <b>artery</b> and accumulation of blood in the subarachnoid space. It may be characterized by a different, usually severe headache; it may also cause a range of additional neurological symptoms.|$|E
5|$|In {{cases where}} {{the length of the}} thyroid ima <b>artery</b> is shorter, the <b>artery</b> ends by {{supplying}} the thymus gland and is known as thymica accessoria.|$|E
50|$|Radicular <b>arteries</b> can {{sometimes}} be replaced functionally by segmental medullary <b>arteries.</b> However, unlike those <b>arteries,</b> radicular <b>arteries</b> do not form anastamoses with the anterior or posterior spinal <b>arteries.</b> Radicular <b>arteries</b> are also generally smaller.|$|R
2500|$|The dorsal aortae, {{present on}} the [...] side of the embryo, are {{initially}} present {{on both sides of}} the embryo. They later fuse to form the basis for the aorta itself. Approximately thirty smaller <b>arteries</b> branch from this at the back and sides. These branches form the intercostal <b>arteries,</b> <b>arteries</b> of the arms and legs, lumbar <b>arteries</b> and the lateral sacral <b>arteries.</b> Branches to the sides of the aorta will form the definitive renal, suprarenal and gonadal <b>arteries.</b> Finally, branches at the front of the aorta consist of the vitelline <b>arteries</b> and umbilical <b>arteries.</b> The vitelline <b>arteries</b> form the celiac, superior and inferior mesenteric <b>arteries</b> of the gastrointestinal tract. After birth, the umbilical <b>arteries</b> will form the internal iliac <b>arteries.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{right and}} left main {{pulmonary}} <b>arteries</b> give off branches that roughly correspond to the lung lobes, and can in such cases be termed lobar <b>arteries.</b> The lobar <b>arteries</b> branch into segmental <b>arteries</b> (roughly 1 for each lobe segment), which in turn branch into subsegmental pulmonary <b>arteries.</b> These eventually form intralobular <b>arteries.</b>|$|R
5|$|The <b>artery</b> has a {{variable}} origin. It mostly {{arises from the}} brachiocephalic trunk, but may also originate from the aortic arch, the right common carotid, the subclavian, the pericardiacophrenic <b>artery,</b> the thyrocervical trunk, the transverse scapular or the internal thoracic <b>artery.</b> It ascends {{in front of the}} trachea in the superior mediastinum to {{the lower part of the}} thyroid gland.|$|E
5|$|The <b>artery</b> is only {{present in}} {{approximately}} 3–10% of the population. Thyroid ima <b>artery</b> is of surgical importance; {{due to its}} relatively small size and infrequent presence it can cause complications such as severe bleeding in surgery of the thorax, trachea, thyroid or parathyroid glands. Knowledge of occurrence of the <b>artery</b> is especially important during tracheostomy and thyroidectomy. Because the <b>artery</b> is smaller than the other thyroid vessels, and having an origin {{from one of the}} bigger vessels, a brisk cut while performing the surgery may cause complications such as severe hemorrhage and significant blood loss. The <b>artery,</b> if dissected, may draw back into the mediastinum and further complicate the condition by causing hemorrhage and clots in the thoracic cavity.|$|E
5|$|The {{inner ear}} is {{supplied}} by the anterior tympanic branch of the maxillary artery; the stylomastoid branch of the posterior auricular artery; the petrosal branch of middle meningeal artery; and the labyrinthine <b>artery,</b> arising from either the anterior inferior cerebellar <b>artery</b> or the basilar <b>artery.</b>|$|E
50|$|GCA {{is a form}} of vasculitis. It {{typically}} causes {{inflammation of}} the network of small vessels (vasa vasorum) that supplies the larger <b>arteries.</b> GCA affects <b>arteries</b> of the head and neck, including the three <b>arteries</b> that branch out from the arch of the ascending aorta, and their branches—the thoracic aorta, the axillary <b>arteries,</b> the vertebral <b>arteries,</b> and further on in the head in the ophthalmic and external carotid <b>arteries</b> (the temporal and occipital <b>arteries).</b> It can cause Vascular occlusion of the <b>arteries</b> and ischemia.|$|R
50|$|The paramedian <b>arteries</b> (posteromedial central <b>arteries)</b> {{referred}} to as paramedic pontine <b>arteries</b> are <b>arteries</b> which supply part of the thalamus and other structures in the region. Uncal herniation can cause compression of the paramedian <b>arteries</b> and {{can result in a}} Duret haemorrhage.|$|R
40|$|Isolated human, Japanese monkey and dog {{epicardial}} coronary <b>arteries</b> and dog renal and mesenteric <b>arteries</b> {{treated with}} phentolamine responded to isoproterenol with a concentration-related relaxation. The KB values of metoprolol, a beta-i antag-onist, in the coronary <b>arteries</b> from different mammals did not differ, but were appreciably smaller {{than those in}} the dog renal and mesenteric <b>arteries.</b> Treatment with butoxamine, a beta- 2 antagonist, inhibited the relaxation of dog mesenteric <b>arteries</b> {{to a greater extent than}} that of monkey and dog coronary <b>arteries.</b> Terbutaline, a beta- 2 agonist, produced a greater relaxation in monkey mesenteric and dog renal and mesenteric <b>arteries</b> than in human, monkey and dog coronary <b>arteries.</b> Norepinephnne relaxed the monkey and dog coronary <b>arteries</b> dose-dependently via mainly beta-i adrenoceptors, but elicited a contraction or...|$|R
5|$|The {{outer ear}} is {{supplied}} {{by a number}} of arteries. The posterior auricular <b>artery</b> provides the majority of the blood supply. The anterior auricular arteries provide some supply to the outer rim of the ear and scalp behind it. The posterior auricular <b>artery</b> is a direct branch of the external carotid <b>artery,</b> and the anterior auricular arteries are branches from the superficial temporal <b>artery.</b> The occipital <b>artery</b> also plays a role.|$|E
5|$|The thyroid ima <b>artery</b> is an {{embryonic}} <b>artery</b> and {{it occurs}} {{because of the}} failure of the vessel to close, remaining patent (open).|$|E
5|$|The thyroid ima <b>artery</b> {{was first}} defined by German anatomist Johann E. Neubauer {{in the year}} 1772. Hence, it was named the thyroid <b>artery</b> of Neubauer. The <b>artery</b> {{originates}} lower than the inferior thyroid arteries, so it {{is also known as}} the lowest thyroid <b>artery.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Interlobular <b>arteries</b> (or {{cortical}} radiate <b>arteries</b> [...] or cortical radial <b>arteries)</b> are renal {{blood vessels}} given off {{at right angles}} {{from the side of}} the arcuate <b>arteries</b> looking toward the cortical substance. The interlobular <b>arteries</b> pass directly outward between the medullary rays to reach the fibrous tunic, where they end in the capillary network of this part.|$|R

5|$|The thyroid is {{supplied}} with arterial {{blood from the}} superior thyroid <b>artery,</b> {{a branch of the}} external carotid <b>artery,</b> and the inferior thyroid <b>artery,</b> a branch of the thyrocervical trunk, and sometimes by an anatomical variant the thyroid ima <b>artery,</b> which has a variable origin. The superior thyroid <b>artery</b> splits into anterior and posterior branches supplying the thyroid, and the inferior thyroid <b>artery</b> splits into superior and inferior branches. The superior and inferior thyroid arteries join together behind the outer part of the thyroid lobes. The venous blood is drained via superior and middle thyroid veins, which drain to the internal jugular vein, and via the inferior thyroid veins. The inferior thyroid veins originate in a network of veins and drain into the left and right brachiocephalic veins. Both arteries and veins form a plexus between the two layers of the capsule of the thyroid gland.|$|E
5|$|Vertebral <b>artery</b> {{dissection}} (VAD) is a flap-like tear of {{the inner}} lining of the vertebral <b>artery,</b> which {{is located in the}} neck and supplies blood to the brain. After the tear, blood enters the arterial wall and forms a blood clot, thickening the <b>artery</b> wall and often impeding blood flow. The symptoms of vertebral <b>artery</b> dissection include head and neck pain and intermittent or permanent stroke symptoms such as difficulty speaking, impaired coordination and visual loss. It is usually diagnosed with a contrast-enhanced CT or MRI scan.|$|E
5|$|Vertebral <b>artery</b> {{dissection}} {{is one of}} the {{two types}} of dissection of the arteries in the neck. The other type, carotid <b>artery</b> dissection, involves the carotid arteries. Vertebral <b>artery</b> dissection is further classified as being either traumatic (caused by mechanical trauma to the neck) or spontaneous, and it may also be classified by the part of the <b>artery</b> involved: extracranial (the part outside the skull) and intracranial (the part inside the skull).|$|E

5|$|When present, {{the thyroid}} ima's chief supply is the thyroid gland, though it also {{supplies}} the trachea. The <b>artery</b> may extend and supply the parathyroid glands. An infrequently observed <b>artery,</b> {{it is more}} frequently reported {{in the context of}} enlarged parathyroid glands (parathyroid adenomas). The <b>artery</b> ends by supplying the thyroid gland, or the parathyroid glands, as a single unit or as multiple branches. The <b>artery</b> is also found to be the only supply of the parathyroid gland in rare cases.|$|E
5|$|Arteria thyroidea ima is the Latin {{name of the}} <b>artery.</b>|$|E
5|$|Coronary <b>artery</b> {{bypass surgery}} {{is one such}} operation. In this operation, one or more arteries {{surrounding}} the heart that have become narrowed are bypassed. This is done by taking blood vessels harvested from {{another part of the}} body. Commonly harvested veins include the saphenous veins or the internal mammary <b>artery.</b> Because this operation involves the heart tissue, a machine is used so that blood can bypass the heart during the operation.|$|E

5000|$|Arcuate <b>arteries</b> {{located in}} the uterus branch out and supply blood to {{different}} layers of the uterus. These <b>arteries</b> meet the myometrial-endometrial junction and lead to straight and endometrial <b>arteries.</b> The endometrium receives blood from endometrial <b>arteries</b> which are also called spiral <b>arteries.</b> Endometrial <b>arteries</b> proliferate rapidly and react to different hormones released. These hormones are progesterone and estrogen released by the ovaries and produced by the endocrine system. The endometrial <b>arteries</b> not only supply blood to the endometrium but are also important during pregnancy. They are the initial site of transportation of blood from the mother to the baby.|$|R
50|$|Most of the dorsal {{metacarpal}} <b>arteries</b> {{arise from}} the dorsal carpal arch and run downward on the second, third, and fourth dorsal interossei of the hand and bifurcate into the dorsal digital <b>arteries.</b> Near their origin, they anastomose with the deep palmar arch by perforating <b>arteries.</b> They also anastomose with common palmar digital <b>arteries</b> (from the superficial palmar arch), also via perforating <b>arteries.</b>|$|R
5|$|It may be {{possible}} to embolize vascular lesions through interventional radiology; this requires passing a catheter through a large <b>artery</b> and locating the maxillary <b>artery</b> under X-ray guidance, followed by the injection into the vessel of particles that occlude the blood vessels. The benefit from the procedure tends to be short-lived, and it may be most appropriate in episodes of severe bleeding.|$|E
