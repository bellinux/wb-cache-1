Though many designs for a miniaturised type B connector appeared on many peripheral devices, conformance to the USB 1.x standard was fudged by treating peripherals that had miniature connectors <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> had a tethered connection (that is: no plug or socket at the peripheral end). There was no known miniature type A connector until USB 2.0 (rev 1.01) introduced one.|$|E
5|$|The role of stay-at-home dad may be {{difficult}} for men who feel <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> had no option. It is hard for these men to adapt from being a financial provider in the family to being a homemaker. Men who willingly choose to become a stay-at-home dad are much more satisfied with their role in the family.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea {{travelled}} to White Hart Lane to face Tottenham Hotspur in {{the sixth}} round. The team finished the tie as comfortable 4–0 winners, never looking <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> would crumble once William Gallas scored inside 12 minutes. The one negative from their performance was the dismissal of Graeme Le Saux for a second bookable offence in the second half. Local rivals Fulham were Chelsea's semi-final opponents. A scrappy match, which saw Fulham dominate much of the play but creating little, was settled in Chelsea's favour. Terry scored just before half time, heading the ball through the legs of Louis Saha standing in Fulham's goal.|$|E

5|$|Falstaff {{had been}} of {{interest}} to Shakespearean commentators for years. Forty years earlier, a full-length book had appeared, An Essay on the Dramatic Character of Sir John Falstaff (1777), by Maurice Morgann, often taken {{as the beginning of}} that school of Shakespearean criticism which considers the characters of Shakespeare's plays <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> were real people. Hazlitt, who seems to have had little acquaintance with Morgann's work, is careful never to lose sight of Falstaff's status as a character in a play—three plays, in fact, though the two parts of Henry IV are examined in a single essay.|$|E
5|$|In {{northern}} and western Africa, the desiccation and humectation {{of the modern}} Sahara desert has led to very fruitful archaeological sites, followed by completely barren soil, only to once again show evidence of population when the aridity of the region was ameliorated. Preservation in these two regions are alternately superb and lamentable, yet the sites that have been uncovered document the adaptive nature of early hominins to climatically unstable environments. Researchers such as Marean and Assefa consider the historic distinction between northern Africa {{and the rest of}} Africa, <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> represent divergent cultural developments, an arbitrary and antiquated distinction.|$|E
5|$|McLachlan found {{success on}} the Fox {{television}} series Millennium, earning several awards {{for his work on}} the show. He was head-hunted for the series by its creator Chris Carter, who had seen his work on the series Strange Luck. McLachlan was initially offered a position shooting Carter's other active series, The X-Files, then in its third season, but was unable to start work in time. He developed a distinctive style for the series, shooting it with desaturated colours and lighting scenes <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> were to be filmed in black and white; he also made use of high-intensity strobe lighting usually employed for advertising and macro cinematography. McLachlan has noted that this style briefly became popular after the series' broadcast but that other cinematographers had difficulty adjusting to it.|$|E

5|$|Sardou's five-act play La Tosca {{contains}} {{a large amount}} of dialogue and exposition. While the broad details of the play are present in the opera's plot, the original work contains many more characters and much detail not present in the opera. In the play the lovers are portrayed <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> were French: the character Floria Tosca is closely modelled on Bernhardt's personality, while her lover Cavaradossi, of Roman descent, is born in Paris. Illica and Giuseppe Giacosa, the playwright who joined the project to polish the verses, needed not only to cut back the play drastically, but to make the characters' motivations and actions suitable for Italian opera. Giacosa and Puccini repeatedly clashed over the condensation, with Giacosa feeling that Puccini did not really want to complete the project.|$|E
5|$|Stories or {{descriptions}} of animal hybrids {{have appeared in}} many cultures worldwide. A 13th-century Persian work depicts a rabbit with a single horn, like a unicorn. In Europe, the horned rabbit appeared in Medieval and Renaissance folklore in Bavaria (the wolpertinger) and elsewhere. Natural history texts such as Historiae Naturalis de Quadrupetibus Libri (The History Book of Natural Quadrangles) by Joannes Jonstonus (John Jonston) in the 17th century and illustrations such as Animalia Qvadrvpedia et Reptilia (Terra): Plate XLVII by Joris Hoefnagel (1522–1600) in the 16th century included the horned hare. These early scientific texts described and illustrated the hybrids <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> were real creatures, {{but by the end}} of the 18th century scientists generally rejected the idea of horned hares as a biological species.|$|E
5|$|The {{lighting}} system is programmed to darken the set as the contestant progresses {{further into the}} game. There are also spotlights situated {{at the bottom of}} the set area that zoom down on the contestant when they answer a major question; to increase the visibility of the light beams emitted by such spotlights, oil is vaporized, creating a haze effect. Media scholar Dr. Robert Thompson, a professor at Syracuse University, stated that the show's {{lighting system}} made the contestant feel <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> were outside of prison when an escape was in progress.|$|E

5|$|The men {{inside them}} paddled fast on the treadmills, and the ships glided {{forwards}} <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> were flying, {{yet no one}} was visible on board. The enemy {{thought that they were}} made of paper. Then all of a sudden a thunderclap bomb was let off. It was made with paper (carton) and filled with lime and sulphur. (Launched from trebuchets) these thunderclap bombs came dropping down from the air, and upon meeting the water exploded with a noise like thunder, the sulphur bursting into flames. The carton case rebounded and broke, scattering the lime to form a smoky fog, which blinded the eyes of men and horses so that they could see nothing. Our ships then went forward to attack theirs, and their men and horses were all drowned, so that they were utterly defeated.|$|E

By the end of May the Mets had won three out of the four games they played against each other; however, the Phillies {{retained}} a half game lead. Both clubs struggled in June as the Phillies slumped and the New York became plagued with injuries. By the end of June the Phillies had increased their division lead, but only to two and a half games.|$|E
5|$|In late 1971, John Dean, the White House Counsel, {{pushed to}} expand the {{existing}} intelligence program ahead of the 1972 re-election campaign. Dean delegated the task to Jack Caulfield, {{a member of his}} staff who was a former New York police officer. According to Dean, Caulfield himself was interested in work outside of politics; he intended to create a private security company, and felt that if the Nixon cabinet were an early client, it would lead to lucrative future clients within the private sector. Fred Emery, a journalist for The Times and BBC, refutes this, claiming in his book Watergate: The Corruption & Fall of Richard Nixon that the idea of a private sector security firm was simply a front for a committed campaign of surveillance working Nixon and the Republican Party, with political donations to the re-election campaign able to be diverted through the company <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> were unrelated transactions.|$|E

5|$|Schutzstaffel ("Protection Squadron"; SS) was a {{personal}} protection squad for Hitler created in 1925. Whereas the SA numbered in the millions, the SS started {{with less than a}} hundred men. The SS uniform included a black tie and a black cap with a Totenkopf ("death's head") skull and bones symbol on it. After March 1927, the SS had stricter entry requirements than the general SA. Although subordinate to the SA until the summer of 1934, its members behaved <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> were the Nazi Party elite. From January 1929 forward, the SS was commanded by Heinrich Himmler in his capacity as Reichsführer-SS; later in 1936, Himmler was appointed chief of all German police. Within the SS main branches of the Allgemeine SS, SS-Totenkopfverbände and Waffen-SS, there further existed sub-branches, including the RSHA (which had as departments: the SD, Gestapo and the Kripo). After the war, pursuant to the judgments rendered at the Nuremberg trials, as well as many war crimes investigations and trials conducted since then, the SS was judged to be a criminal organization and determined to be responsible for the majority of Nazi war crimes. In particular, it was the primary organisation which carried out the Holocaust.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{returning}} to his hotel suite that night, Bond finds Romanova {{waiting for him in}} his bed and has sex with her; neither are aware that SPECTRE is filming them. The next day, Romanova heads off for a pre-arranged rendezvous at Hagia Sophia to drop off the floor plans for the consulate, with Grant ensuring Bond receives the plans by killing the other Bulgarian tail who attempts to intercept the drop. Using the plans, Bond and Kerim Bey successfully steal the Lektor and, together with Romanova, escape with the device onto the Orient Express. On the train, Kerim Bey quickly notices a Soviet security officer named Benz tailing them, prompting him and Bond to subdue him. When Bond leaves Benz and Kerim Bey alone together, Grant kills them and makes it appear <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> killed each other, preventing Bond from leaving the train with Romanova to rendezvous with one of Kerim's men.|$|E
