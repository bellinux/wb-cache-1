40|$|Abstract: Who {{would think}} of cooking a potato in boiling rosin? The origin and {{rationale}} for this interesting cooking behavior is lost in ethno-botanical lore but directions for the practice persisted until recent editions of The Joy of Cooking (Rombauer and Becker 1975). Indeed, the dish can still be obtained at Sweetie Pies Restaurant (Decatur, TX) one day a week. We obtained rosin (Pinerez 1277), produced by Hexion Specialty Chemicals, to duplicate the cooking recipe and to investigate the gustatory effects. The basic recipe involves heating the rosin to 275 0 F and carefully lowering the spud into the pot (see Figure 1). The potato initially sinks in the rosin, but after about 45 minutes, floats to the surface (Rombauer and Becker 1975). The potato is simmered a further 30 minutes, removed from the rosin, and wrapped in heavy brown paper with the ends twisted tightly. The rosin baked potato is cooled for 10 minutes and then slit and served with butter, salt, <b>and</b> <b>freshly</b> <b>ground</b> <b>pepper.</b> The cooking process must be done outside and the skin must not be eaten. The cooking in rosin provides a baked potato with an exceptional texture that is distinctively flaky. Figure 1.

50|$|The use {{of spices}} for both meat and {{vegetable}} dishes is quite extensive and includes many combinations. The combination of whole spices, fried and added {{at the start}} or finish of cooking as a flavoring is special to each dish. Whole black mustard seeds <b>and</b> <b>freshly</b> <b>ground</b> mustard paste form a typical combination. A pungent mustard sauce called kashundi is sauce for snacks or sometimes makes a base ingredient for fish dishes and vegetable dishes.|$|R
50|$|Pearà {{requires}} a long, slow cooking; for its thermal properties, a traditional terracotta pot {{is to be}} preferred. First off the bread crumbs are mixed in the pot to the melted marrow and butter; afterwards scalding hot stock is added with a ladle while stirring continuously. The pot is then left to simmer {{for at least two}} hours, to obtain the desired creamy and thick texture. The sauce's namesake abundant, <b>freshly</b> <b>ground</b> black <b>pepper</b> is added {{towards the end of the}} cooking.Some recipes also add olive oil and grated Parmigiano Reggiano or Grana Padano.|$|R
25|$|Fillings in {{pastries}} {{are sometimes}} made of finely ground poppy seeds mixed with butter or milk and sugar. The ground filling {{is used in}} poppy seed rolls and some croissants and may be flavored with lemon or orange zest, rum and vanilla with raisins, heavy cream, cinnamon, and chopped blanched almonds or walnuts added. For sweet baked goods, sometimes instead of sugar a tablespoon of jam, or other sweet binding agent, like syrup is substituted. The poppy seed for fillings are best when they are finely <b>and</b> <b>freshly</b> <b>ground</b> because this will {{make a big difference}} in the pastry filling's texture and taste. Some recipes for Mohnstriezel use poppy seed soaked in water for two hours or boiled in milk. A recipe for Ukrainian poppyseed cake recommends preparing the seeds by immersing in boiling water, straining and soaking in milk overnight.|$|R

40|$|Sound {{high density}} {{cylinders}} of graphite {{have been made}} by cold compacting finely ground artificial graphite at pressure of 60 t. s. i. Cylinders could be made only if the graphite used was 50 percent, finer than 10 microns <b>and</b> <b>freshly</b> <b>ground.</b> Storage of the powder in moist atmospheres or heating of the powder reduced its compacting properties. Uranium and thorium metal powder and uranium and thorium oxide up to 60 weight per cent, equivalent metals {{have been added to the}} graphite and sound cylinders made from the mixtures. The compacts have been heated to high temperatures (up to 2800 °C) to convert the metals or oxides to carbides which rapidly hydrolyse in moist air. Measurements of compressive strength and density changes and investigation of the properties of the compacts on thermal cycling have been made. Compacts made from metal powders are considered satisfactory for use fuel for a High Temperature Gas Cooled reactor system provided their irradiation stability is satisfactory.

50|$|Khaman is a food {{common in}} the Gujarat state of India made from soaked <b>and</b> <b>freshly</b> <b>ground</b> channa dal or channa flour (also called gram flour or besan). Generally eaten as a snack, it is mostly served with sev, fried {{chillies}} and chutney. In some shops it is also served traditionally in a large green leaf. Sometimes it is also garnished with scraped coconut. Khaman, often part of the Gujarati Thali (traditional dish containing various components of a full meal) {{is very similar to}} dhokla, in which the batter is made with a mixture of rice and lentil flour, resulting in a distinct texture and taste. Nonetheless, Khaman, Khaman-Dhokla and Dhokla are often used interchangeably and are synonymous with a steamed snack made with a batter composed of lentil flour or a mixture of lentil and rice flours. Although a Gujarati snack, it has become increasingly popular across India, as well as in other regions with a sizable Gujarati community.|$|R
40|$|This project {{investigated}} {{the feasibility of}} using ground corn stalks as the substrate to cultivate marigold (Tagetes erecta L.). Five treatments including peat moss, composted corn stalks <b>and</b> <b>freshly</b> <b>ground</b> corn stalks were tested for their effects on marigold seedling growth. Seedling quality was described by several morphological and physiological parameters. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance and GGE biplot analysis. There were significant differences among the treatments for several growth parameters, such as seedling biomass, root biomass, stem diameter, leaf area, seedling vigor, chlorophyll content, photosynthetic rate, root activity, stomatal conductance, and intercellular CO 2 concentration. Treatment T 3, which contained composted ground corn stalks, had the best effect on marigold seedling growth. The results showed that corn stalk was a good substrate for marigold seedlings. GGE biplot demonstrated the substrate effects on marigold seedling quality, and graphically displayed the interrelationships among morphological and physiological parameters. T 3 treatment was the best because four morphological parameters, including seedling biomass, roots biomass, stem diameter and seedling vigor, along with six physiological parameters fall into this sector. These results {{were consistent with the}} results analyzed by Statistical Analysis Software. For morphological parameters, the correlations are complicated. For physiological parameters, they were all positively correlated between each of two parameters...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{test whether}} or not dentin desensitizing or sealing methods {{influence}} the bond strength of universal resin cements. Materials and Methods: The bond strength of two universal resin cements (RelyXUnicem, Self-adhesive Prototype Cement) to human dentin was assessed after different dentin surface treatments (test). A conventional resin cement (Panavia 21) served as control. The influence of the following pretreatment methods was tested <b>and</b> compared to <b>freshly</b> <b>ground</b> dentin: dentin desensitizing by means of glutaraldehyde-containing primers (Gluma Desensitizer, Syntac Primer/Adhesive), or dentin sealing by means of bonding agents (Heliobond, ClearfilSE Bond). Additionally, the influence of provisional cement (Freegenol) was analyzed after its application and subsequent mechanical removal. Bond strength after thermocycling was measured in a shear test (n = 10). Data were analyzed with one-way ANOVA, followed by a post-hoc Tukey test (p < 0. 05). Results: Both test cements exhibited significantly lower bond strength to <b>freshly</b> <b>ground</b> dentin than the control cement. The desensitization methods {{did not affect the}} bond strength of the test cements. Furthermore, the sealing methods significantly increased the bond strength of both test cements as compared to <b>freshly</b> <b>ground</b> dentin. The application and subsequent removal of the provisional cement only had a minor influence on the bond strength of the test cements. The contamination with provisional cement, however, significantly affected the bond strength of the control cement compared to the values achieved on <b>freshly</b> <b>ground</b> dentin. Conclusion: Desensitization or sealing of dentin have a beneficial effect on the bond strength of universal resin cements. The application of a provisional cement prior to adhesive cementation exhibits no significant influence on the bond strength of the universal resin cements...|$|R
