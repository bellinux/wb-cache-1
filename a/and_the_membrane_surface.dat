40|$|Background and Objectives: Pomegranate juice (PJ) {{contains}} large {{particles that}} stick to evaporator walls causing off flavors in the concentrate due to burning. Microfiltration {{is used to}} clarify PJ. Fouling is a limiting phenomenon that can prevent the industrialization of membrane clarification. Changes in the geometry of the membrane module such as using baffles are useful to decrease this problem. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is a powerful numerical tool used in modeling membrane processing. Materials and Methods: The effect of baffle geometry on the efficiency of membrane clarification of pomegranate juice in a flat-sheet module was simulated using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The geometry of the membrane unit was plotted and meshed with Gambit software, and was solved using FLUENT software. A two-dimensional double-precision method at steady state was selected to simulate the membrane process. The convective terms were discretized with a standard first-order upwind scheme in computational solution. The RNG k-  model was used due to its high accuracy in eddy flows with a low Reynolds number. The effects on the process performance {{of the number of}} baffles, their angle and the distance between the baffles <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>surface</b> were evaluated. Results: The results showed that the configuration with the feed-channel height of 2 cm, the baffle angle of 90 o and the distance between the membrane surface and baffles of 2 mm had maximum permeate flux.

Research on the transport models, <b>the</b> separation performance, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> functionalization of GO membranes has been developed. However, many mechanisms of mass transport through GO membranes still remain debatable. In this work, GO was synthesized, and then functionalized with linear amine-terminated poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and aluminum ions (Al). <b>The</b> fabrication <b>and</b> characterizations of GO, PEG-GO, and Al-GO membranes were demonstrated in this work. Water and water/ethanol binary mixture transport through GO, PEG-GO, and Al-GO membranes were studied to investigate <b>the</b> permeation <b>and</b> <b>the</b> rejection rates of solvents through GO-based <b>membranes.</b> <b>The</b> total volumetric flux of water/ethanol mixture through GO membranes was inversely proportional to the viscosity of the solvent mixtures. The steric hindrance effect <b>and</b> <b>the</b> interactions between <b>the</b> solvent molecules <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>surfaces</b> dominated <b>the</b> rejection rate of ethanol through GO <b>membranes.</b> <b>The</b> functionalization of GO modified <b>the</b> pore size <b>and</b> <b>the</b> porosity of <b>the</b> <b>membranes,</b> resulting in faster permeation of solvents and reduced rejection rates of ethanol through PEG-GO and Al-GO membranes. Deformation of nanochannels within <b>the</b> functionalized GO <b>membranes</b> was observed when <b>the</b> <b>membranes</b> were operated under highly pressurized conditions. Diffusive transport of two charge equivalent and structurally similar ruthenium complex ions Ru(bpy) 32 + and iv Ru(phen) 32 + through GO, PEG-GO, and Al-GO membranes were also studied. Our data showed high similarity with the results reported previously in the literature, indicating that <b>the</b> GO <b>and</b> functionalized GO membranes used in this work were highly consistent. Due to the enlarged pore sizes <b>and</b> <b>the</b> reduced interactions between ions <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>surfaces,</b> <b>the</b> flux of ions through PEG-GO membranes was 300 % higher than that through GO membranes.

40|$|CLIC 1 is an {{intracellular}} {{membrane protein}} {{that has an}} unusual property distinct from typical membrane proteins. It is able to exist in both a soluble and membrane-bound form in cells. The membrane-insertion mechanism of soluble CLIC 1 is still unknown. However, it has been proposed that soluble CLIC 1 has to undergo unfolding and refolding processes to form its membrane-bound conformation. In this study, {{the focus is on}} the understanding of the unfolding mechanism of soluble CLIC 1 under the pH values typical of the cytosol <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>surface.</b> Equilibrium unfolding studies show that, at pH 7. 0, CLIC 1 unfolds via a two-state transition and the unfolding kinetics studies further confirms that there are no detectable transient intermediates. At pH 5. 5, CLIC 1 shows a three-state unfolding transition with a formation of an intermediate species at equilibrium in the presence of 3 4 M urea. The characterisation of this intermediate indicates that it has reduced secondary structural content and native-like tertiary structure with the exception of a more buried Trp 35 when compared to the native state. Moreover, this intermediate has more exposed hydrophobic surface than the native state. The unfolding kinetics studies demonstrate that there are hidden intermediates in the native-to-unfolded transition at pH 5. 5. The formation of the intermediate state involves, initially, a rapid partial unfolding followed by a slow repacking of the structure. The results from equilibrium unfolding and unfolding kinetics studies both suggest that the intermediate state is more stable than the native state at pH 5. 5, indicating that under this condition, the stability of native CLIC 1 is reduced and the intermediate is energetically favoured. The results from this study give information about the conformational stability and the different unfolding behaviours of soluble CLIC 1 under the conditions that simulate the environments of the cytosol <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>surface,</b> and further provide a possible interpretation for the in vivo membrane-insertion mechanism of the protein...|$|E

The concentration polarization creates an unwanted increase of the salt concentration between the bulk side <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>surface.</b> The polarization effect is due to the convective transport of salt molecules by the water flow to the boundary layer of the membrane, and their subsequent blockage by the membrane itself. A correct estimation of the concentration polarization is fundamental to predict the clean water flux, and finally, to be able to carry out a good design and control of the desalination plant. Several models have been proposed in the literature to calculate the concentration polarization (or the salt concentration on the membrane surface). This paper presents a new model, which aims to solve some of the disadvantages of the previous models...|$|E
40|$|In this study, we {{fabricated}} {{a composite}} membrane for membrane distillation (MD) by modifying a commercial hydrophobic polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane with a nanocomposite coating comprising silica nanoparticles, chitosan hydrogel and fluoro-polymer. The composite membrane exhibits asymmetric wettability, with the modified surface being in-air hydrophilic and underwater oleophobic, and the unmodified surface remaining hydrophobic. By comparing {{the performance of}} the composite membrane and the pristine PVDF membrane in direct contact MD experiments using a saline emulsion with 1000 ppm crude oil (in water), we showed that the fabricated composite membrane was significantly more resistant to oil fouling compared to the pristine hydrophobic PVDF membrane. Force spectroscopy was conducted for the interaction between an oil droplet <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>surface</b> using a force tensiometer. The difference between the composite membrane and the pristine PVDF membrane in their interaction with an oil droplet served to explain the difference in the fouling propensities between these two membranes observed in MD experiments. The results from this study suggest that underwater oleophobic coating can effectively mitigate oil fouling in MD operations, and that the fabricated composite membrane with asymmetric wettability can enable MD to desalinate hypersaline wastewater with high concentrations of hydrophobic contaminants...|$|E
40|$|Studies {{were carried}} out to {{identify}} transmembrane bridging proteins in <b>the</b> plasma <b>membrane</b> of mouse L- 929 cells. Cells grown in suspension culture were 125 I-labeled by lactoperoxidase and allowed to ingest latex particles to produce inside-out membrane phagosome preparations. Phagosomes were isolated <b>and</b> <b>the</b> inner <b>membrane</b> <b>surface</b> was labeled with N-(5 '-aminopentyl) - 5 -dimethylamino- 1 -naphthalenesulfonamide (dansylcadavarine) by a transglutaminase-catalyzed reaction. <b>The</b> phagosome <b>membrane</b> proteins were solubilized and dansylcadavarine-labeled proteins were isolated by anti-dansyl immunoadsorbent affinity chromatography. Dansylcadavarine-labeled proteins were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis <b>and</b> autoradiography for <b>the</b> presence of 125 I-labeled material. By this technique, two iodinated proteins with molecular weights of approximately 50, 000 and 80, 000 appear to be selectively retained by the anti-dansyl immunoadsorbent, suggesting that these proteins span <b>the</b> plasma <b>membrane...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{membrane}} bioreactor (MBR) and an activated sludge process (ASP) were operated {{side by side}} to evaluate the change of sludge supernatant characteristics <b>and</b> <b>the</b> evolution of the sludge fouling propensity. The MBR sludge had a higher organic concentration and more biopolymer clusters (BPC) in the supernatant compared with ASP. BPC increased in both concentration <b>and</b> size in <b>the</b> MBR. The {{results show that the}} change in the liquid-phase property {{had a profound effect on}} the sludge fouling propensity. MBR operation transformed typical activated sludge to MBR sludge with a higher fouling propensity. Distinct from <b>the</b> ASP, <b>membrane</b> filtration retained soluble microbial products (SMP) within <b>the</b> MBR, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> vast <b>membrane</b> <b>surface</b> provided a unique environment for the transformation of SMP to large size BPC, leading to further sludge deposition on <b>the</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>surface.</b> Thus, <b>membrane</b> filtration is <b>the</b> crucial cause of the inevitable fouling problem in submerged MBRs. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. postprin...|$|R
40|$|To {{generate}} polyethersulfone membranes with a biocatalytically active surface, pancreatin was covalently immobilized. Pancreatin is {{a mixture}} of digestive enzymes such as protease, lipase, <b>and</b> amylase. <b>The</b> resulting <b>membranes</b> exhibit self-cleaning properties after “switching on” the respective enzyme by adjusting pH <b>and</b> temperature. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>surface</b> can actively degrade a fouling layer on its surface and regain initial permeability. Fouling tests with solutions of protein, oil, and mixtures of both, were performed, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>membrane’s</b> ability to self-clean the fouled <b>surface</b> was characterized. <b>Membrane</b> characterization was conducted by investigation of the immobilized enzyme concentration, enzyme activity, water permeation flux, fouling tests, porosimetry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy...|$|R
