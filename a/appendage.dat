5|$|The {{heart has}} four chambers, two upper atria, the {{receiving}} chambers, and two lower ventricles, the discharging chambers. The atria open into the ventricles via the atrioventricular valves, {{present in the}} atrioventricular septum. This distinction is visible also {{on the surface of}} the heart as the coronary sulcus. There is an ear-shaped structure in the upper right atrium called the right atrial <b>appendage,</b> or auricle, and another in the upper left atrium, the left atrial <b>appendage.</b> The right atrium and the right ventricle together are sometimes referred to as the right heart. Similarly, the left atrium and the left ventricle together are sometimes referred to as the left heart. The ventricles are separated from each other by the interventricular septum, visible {{on the surface of the}} heart as the anterior longitudinal sulcus and the posterior interventricular sulcus.|$|E
5|$|The left atrium {{receives}} oxygenated blood {{back from}} the lungs via {{one of the four}} pulmonary veins. The left atrium has an outpouching called the left atrial <b>appendage.</b> Like the right atrium, the left atrium is lined by pectinate muscles. The left atrium is connected to the left ventricle by the mitral valve.|$|E

5|$|Bioluminescence {{is used by}} {{a variety}} of animals to mimic other species. Many species of deep sea fish such as the {{anglerfish}} and dragonfish make use of aggressive mimicry to attract prey. They have an <b>appendage</b> on their heads called an esca that contains bioluminescent bacteria able to produce a long-lasting glow which the fish can control. The glowing esca is dangled or waved about to lure small animals to within striking distance of the fish.|$|E
5|$|Bobby tells {{a fellow}} student, Lisa Baiocchi, {{that she must}} stand up to her {{overbearing}} father {{just as he had}} done with Phil.

5|$|The spores {{are roughly}} elliptical, or, less commonly, {{somewhat}} spherical, and have dimensions of 7.5–9.5 by 5–7μm. They are thin-walled, inamyloid, {{and have a}} smooth surface. Each features a prominent hilar <b>appendage.</b> The basidia (spore-bearing cells), measuring 32–42 by 6–9μm, are club-shaped and four-spored, with sterigmata up to 7μm long. Cheilocystidia (cystidia found on the gill edges) are abundant, and measure 15–40 by 3–6μm; no pleurocystida (cystidia on the gill faces) are present. The cap cuticle comprises {{a thin layer of}} 3–6μm-wide hyphae that are interwoven either loosely or tightly. All hyphae of O.nidiformis have clamp connections.|$|E
5|$|The larvae are {{generally}} whitish grubs, roughly oval and bluntly-pointed at both ends. They have fifteen segments and spiracles in each segment for breathing. They have no legs but {{are able to}} move {{within the confines of}} the cell, helped by tubercles on their sides. They have short horns on the head, jaws for chewing their food and an <b>appendage</b> on either side of the mouth tipped with a bristle. There is a gland under the mouth that secretes a viscous liquid which solidifies into the silk they use to produce their cocoons. The pupa can be seen through the semi-transparent cocoon and over the course of a few days, the insect undergoes metamorphosis into the form of the adult bee. When ready to emerge, it splits its skin dorsally and climbs out of the exuviae as a winged adult and breaks out of the cell.|$|E

5|$|The right atrium {{receives}} blood almost continuously {{from the}} body's two major veins, the superior and inferior venae cavae. A {{small amount of}} blood from the coronary circulation also drains into the right atrium via the coronary sinus, which is immediately above and {{to the middle of}} the opening of the inferior vena cava. In the wall of the right atrium is an oval-shaped depression known as the fossa ovalis, which is a remnant of an opening in the fetal heart known as the foramen ovale. Most of the internal surface of the right atrium is smooth, the depression of the fossa ovalis is medial, and the anterior surface has prominent ridges of pectinate muscles, which are also present in the right atrial <b>appendage.</b>|$|E
5|$|Mantises {{have two}} spiked, {{grasping}} forelegs ("raptorial legs") in which prey items are caught and held securely. In most insect legs, including the posterior four {{legs of a}} mantis, the coxa and trochanter combine as an inconspicuous base of the leg; in the raptorial legs, however, the coxa and trochanter combine to form a segment {{about as long as}} the femur, which is a spiky part of the grasping apparatus (see illustration). Located {{at the base of the}} femur is a set of discoidal spines, usually four in number, but ranging from none to as many as five depending on the species. These spines are preceded by a number of tooth-like tubercles, which, along with a similar series of tubercles along the tibia and the apical claw near its tip, give the foreleg of the mantis its grasp on its prey. The foreleg ends in a delicate tarsus used as a walking <b>appendage,</b> made of four or five segments and ending in a two-toed claw with no arolium.|$|E
5|$|The spores are white, smooth, roughly elliptical, {{and have}} {{dimensions}} of 7–8.5 by 5–6μm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are 17–23 by 7.5–10μm, and four-spored with sterigmata around 3 μm long. The paraphyses are 5–8μm wide, {{shorter than the}} basidia, more abundant and form a somewhat gelatinous layer. The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the cap edge) are 60 by 7–21μm, hyaline, conical or ventricose (inflated). The tips of the cheilocystidia are drawn out to a point, or have a short <b>appendage</b> measuring 15 by 2–3μm, which is sometimes branched, and is thin or slightly thick-walled. There are no cystidia on the gill face (pleurocystidia). Pileocystidia (cystidia {{on the surface of}} the cap) are club-shaped, measuring 25–60 by 13–25μm. They are somewhat thick-walled, and spiny on the exposed surface with short simple outgrowths extending up to 3μm long. The pileocystidia are joined together and form a continuous layer over the young cap, but break up as the cap expands. The caulocystidia (cystidia on the stem) are conical or lance-shaped, hyaline, and smooth, with walls that are thin or slightly thickened. They measure up to 300 by 10–25μm, but are shorter in the upper regions of the stem. Clamp connections are present in the hyphae of all tissues.|$|E

40|$|The {{nature and}} {{distribution}} of surface <b>appendages</b> morphologically distinct from pili were examined in three strains of gonococci. As reported previously by others, large <b>appendages</b> were seen emanating from colony type 1 gonococci when negatively stained preparations were examined by electron microscopy. Whereas the diameter of pili was 4 to 6 nm, the <b>appendages</b> varied from 8 to 40 nm in diameter with bulbous enlargements of up to 130 nm. However, in contrast to previous findings, the <b>appendages</b> were not limited to virulence-associated colonial types but occurred with almost equal frequency on organisms from colonial types 1 and 4. Thus, {{the presence of these}} <b>appendages</b> on gonococci was unrelated to colonial morphology, and there is currently no reason to associate them with gonococcal virulence. The large <b>appendages</b> were seldom seen if the organisms were suspended in isotonic fluid rather than in distilled water, which was used in previous studies. This suggests that the large <b>appendages</b> may occur infrequently in the isotonic environment of tissues or in slightly hypertonic purulent exudates. Nevertheless, we did observe small <b>appendages</b> or cell wall blebs on the surface of gonococci suspended in isotonic medium and noted similar structures as spheres free in the surrounding milieu. These findings suggest that the material of which the large <b>appendages</b> consist may form small <b>appendages</b> or cell wall blebs and be shed into the milieu under isotonic conditions. Such cell wall blebs have been demonstrated on meningococci and been shown to consist of endotoxin...|$|R
25|$|The first pair (<b>Appendage</b> I) are the chelicerae, small pincer-like arms {{used for}} tearing food apart (mastication) during feeding. After the chelicerae are {{three pairs of}} short legs (Appendages II, III, and IV). They are spiniferous, with {{predominantly}} two spines on each podomere and with the tipmost segment having a single spine. The last two segments are often indistinguishable and {{give the appearance of}} a single segment having three spines. They are used both for walking and for food capture. The next pair (<b>Appendage</b> V) is the most leg-like of all appendages, longer than the first three pairs and are mostly spineless except at the tipmost segments. The last pair (<b>Appendage</b> VI) are two broad paddle-like legs used for swimming. The coxae of <b>Appendage</b> VI are broad and flat, resembling an 'ear'.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] The sinus node {{is known}} to be {{duplicated}} in hearts with bilateral right <b>appendages,</b> but its site is uncertain when both <b>appendages</b> are of morphologically left pattern. OBJECTIVE [...] To determine the earliest site of activation of the atria, and to assess this site of activation relative to the anticipated location of the sinus node in patients with isomeric atrial <b>appendages.</b> STUDY DESIGN [...] Electrophysiological recordings by epicardial mapping during operations through a median sternotomy. PATIENTS [...] Since 1987, 44 consecutive patients with isomeric right <b>appendages</b> and 23 with isomeric left <b>appendages.</b> RESULTS [...] In 77 % of the patients with isomeric right <b>appendages,</b> the site of earliest activation was superiorly located at the junction of one or other atrium and a superior caval vein; in other words, in the anticipated site of a sinus node. In contrast, an inferior site of earliest activation at the junction of an atrium with an hepatic vein was most common in patients with isomeric left <b>appendages</b> (56 %). The site of earliest activation was not related to the veno-atrial junctions in six patients with isomeric right <b>appendages</b> (14 %), nor in five with isomeric left <b>appendages</b> (22 %). Moreover, in six patients with isomeric right <b>appendages</b> (13 %), and three with isomeric left <b>appendages</b> (13 %), additional sites of earliest activation were observed when the dominant site was suppressed. The locations of the earliest activation observed by epicardial mapping did not always accord with those expected from the preoperative electrophysiological examination, nor did they always match the anticipated site of the sinus node as documented by previous histological investigations. CONCLUSIONS [...] Epicardial mapping showed marked variation in functional arrangement of the earliest atrial activation. This information could be of future use when planning surgical procedures...|$|R
