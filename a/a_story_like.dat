500|$|Critics {{have also}} {{commented on the}} character's role in the printed adaptations of the franchise. A. E. Sparrow, {{reviewing}} the graphic novel King of Fighters 2003: Volume 4 for IGN, commented that K' is [...] "sufficiently heroic" [...] with the comic allowing the exploration of his motivations. His duel against Kyo's clone, Kusanagi, was referred by GenjisPress as [...] "fan-only territory" [...] {{due to the lack}} of context. His relationship with his partner Maxima is described as: [...] "hard to tell friend from rival in <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>like</b> this, especially for one who is unfamiliar with the game." ...|$|E
50|$|On its surface, Frank's Place was <b>a</b> fish-out-of-water <b>story,</b> <b>like</b> The Beverly Hillbillies or Green Acres. However, the series' {{story lines}} {{featured}} weightier {{topics such as}} race and class issues.|$|R
50|$|The Transall Saga (also {{known as}} Blue Light) is a 1998 novel by Gary Paulsen. It is <b>a</b> {{survival}} <b>story</b> <b>like</b> {{most of his}} other books, but also involves the science fiction genre.|$|R

500|$|Gordon {{claimed that}} {{he had wanted to}} write <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>like</b> [...] "Kaddish" [...] since the first season, but that the [...] "emotional basis" [...] had eluded him. The {{inspiration}} for Gordon was the communal ring featured in the episode. The ring was a real Jewish relic owned by a rabbi who survived the Holocaust. In fact, the rabbi had used it to wed two of Gordon's friends. During that wedding, Gordon developed a [...] "Romeo and Juliet-like" [...] story that revolved around themes of love and wanting to bring a loved one back from the dead.|$|E
500|$|... "The Pine Bluff Variant" [...] {{was written}} by John Shiban. For much of the show's fifth season, Shiban had an index card that simply read [...] "Mulder Undercover". He had long wanted to do <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>like</b> this, noting, [...] "It always seemed to fit to me—putting Mulder in a {{situation}} [...] don't know his allegiance." [...] Shiban argued that the concept also worked because the theme of Mulder questioning his beliefs was a major element of the fifth season. Shiban petitioned Frank Spotnitz several times about the idea until [...] "the right time and the right way" [...] presented itself.|$|E
500|$|This [...] "70/30 Law" [...] was {{not only}} applied to the visual designs for the film, {{but also for the}} sound effects and music. Sound {{designer}} Dane Davis mentioned that he and his team [...] "scoured hobby shops and junk stores for antique windup toys and old spinning mechanisms" [...] in order to create the sound effects for John Silver to [...] "avoid sounding slick or sci-fi". The team did some experimentation with the sound used in dialogues, especially with the robot B.E.N., but opted to keep Short's natural voice because everything they tried [...] "affected his comedy", and [...] "the {{last thing you want to}} do in <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>like</b> this is affect performances".|$|E
6000|$|... "But I mean to ask {{the same}} {{question}} that she asked, and you won't put me off with <b>a</b> cock-and-bull <b>story</b> <b>like</b> that." [...] But then, as she was going {{to ask the}} question, dinner was announced.|$|R
50|$|Journey to the West, by Wu Chengen, <b>a</b> quest <b>story</b> <b>like</b> Bridge of Birds, tells {{a tale of}} a long pilgrimage from China to India {{in search}} of enlightenment. Many {{obstacles}} like dragons, tigers, demons and monsters are faced along the way.|$|R
5000|$|This is <b>a</b> campaigning <b>story</b> <b>like</b> its {{predecessor}} <b>A</b> Christmas Carol, written {{with the intention}} of swaying readers towards Dickens' moral message.

500|$|The {{story for}} [...] "Release" [...] was {{developed}} by John Shiban and David Amann; the teleplay was written by Amann. Kim Manners helmed the directing of the episode. [...] "Release" [...] was originally going to be written by Shiban alone, but he later turned the script over to Amann because he was needed elsewhere at the time. Shiban had been desiring to write <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>like</b> [...] "Release" [...] for a while. The character of Hayes was crafted as an ambitious character, inspired by the works of Arthur Conan Doyle: he was written to be either a [...] "brilliant guy who's solving crimes with his amazing intuition", comparable to Sherlock Holmes, or [...] "a guy who's actually doing those crimes and playing a game", like Professor Moriarty. Shiban and Amman {{came up with a}} story wherein Scully encounters a [...] "genius" [...] from her classes at the FBI Academy at Quantico. Later on, they extrapolated on the story, allowing the [...] "genius" [...] crime solver to help John Doggett {{find out what happened to}} his son, Luke Doggett.|$|E
500|$|In October 2017, former New York Times {{reporter}} Sharon Waxman {{wrote on}} TheWrap that, {{when she looked}} into the allegations of sexual misconduct by Harvey Weinstein in 2004, Russell Crowe and Damon made direct phone calls to her to vouch for the head of Miramax Italy, Fabrizio Lombardo, whom she suspected of having [...] "no film experience" [...] and whose [...] "real job was {{to take care of}} Weinstein’s women needs" [...] in Europe. Damon responded in an interview with Deadline, [...] "For the record, I would never, ever, ever try to kill <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>like</b> that... It’s not something I would do, for anybody". He said that he had known Lombardo [...] "in a professional capacity" [...] while working on The Talented Mr. Ripley, so he called the reporter and relayed his experience with Lombardo at Weinstein's request. [...] "That was the extent of it....I’m sure I mentioned to her that I didn’t know anything about the rest of her piece, because I didn’t." [...] Waxman has since endorsed Damon’s statement on Twitter.|$|E
500|$|Jamahl Epsicokhan, at {{his website}} Jammer's Reviews, gave [...] "Hope and Fear" [...] {{two out of}} four. Prior to airing, he {{considered}} {{the possibility that the}} crew might actually return home and thus the series would go in a different direction. This was based on the involvement of Berman in the writing, the length of time for the crew returning home matching the summer hiatus and the possibility that the fifth series would cover the crew's reintegration into Federation society. After watching [...] "Hope and Fear", he said [...] "At its fundamental core, <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>like</b> [...] "Hope and Fear" [...] strikes me as almost completely pointless." [...] He said that once again, the status quo of the series was maintained and nothing of note changes. He called the score [...] "wonderous", the sets [...] "impressive" [...] and the direction of the episode [...] "stellar", but said that the plot was [...] "cobbled together out of unlikely coincidences and prior story events that have been twisted to fit the end result." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's your fodder. Draw up and set to. Pretty sleepy, are you? I'll {{tell you}} <b>a</b> <b>story.</b> J' <b>like</b> {{to hear about}} how Napoleon smashed the theory of divine rule, or about how me and Charlie Weems {{explored}} Tiburon? Well----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{understand}} it. What {{can there}} be in <b>a</b> simple little <b>story</b> <b>like</b> that to make people praise it so?" [...] she said, quite bewildered.|$|R
6000|$|Although John Adams had often, in {{the course}} of his {{residence}} on Pitcairn, jested and chatted and taken his share in relating many an anecdote, he had never up till that time resolved to [...] "go in," [...] as he said, [...] "for <b>a</b> regular <b>story,</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> book." ...|$|R
500|$|For Key's second visual novel Air, Maeda {{admitted}} {{he felt he}} was able to write what he wanted to for the game's scenario, but he later discovered that Air was difficult for players to receive and experience. Due to this, Maeda felt that for Key's next work Clannad, he had a sense of duty to make the game easier to receive for as many users as possible. In any case, he wanted to make it an entertaining game, and started planning on Clannad almost immediately after Airs completion. From the start of Clannads planning, Maeda did not want to write <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>like</b> in Air, but instead wanted to focus on writing a deep connection between the 'people and the town', and 'humanity'. Maeda noted that he exceeded his writing ability when writing most of the scenarios in Clannad, and equates Clannads writing process as a [...] "wall that I {{will never be able to}} get over again." [...] While at the beginning Maeda felt he was prepared, the entire game's story started to increase to a level Maeda never predicted, and Suzumoto noted that it approximately doubled in size from the original projected length. Suzumoto attributed the increase due to the lengthening structure of the game's base scenario which caused the 'branch' scenarios to increase as well.|$|E
500|$|Michael Fairman of On-Air On-Soaps {{said that}} the {{relationship}} [...] "hasn’t worked out or caught fire through the writing, or with the fans watching on-screen!" [...] In August 2012, Victor and Sharon married a second time, and when he disappeared shortly after, {{she thought he was}} abandoning her. Sharon later burned their prenuptial agreement, and took over this company. Talking about the situation, Case stated that the writers could have done this storyline [...] "a million other ways" [...] without [...] "marrying him [...] ". In another interview, she spoke thoroughly of the relationship, labeling it incestuous. She stated: [...] "Sometimes controversial storylines can work because you're bringing attention to a controversial issue that the nation is trying to decide on. But this was not one of those things. Everybody is universally against incest! It was just so upsetting to the audience. Whenever the actors went to do , the fans would bring it up. Literally, every actor in the building was coming up to me, giving me feedback that they were getting about it!" [...] When asked if the marriage was about [...] "daddy issues", Case said: [...] "That's usually the case in <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>like</b> that, but I don't think it's one most people want to watch!" [...] Victor later returned home and annulled their second marriage. During an interview with The Province, Michael Muhney, who portrays Victor's son Adam, said that Victor and Sharon's marriage was [...] "almost like an inside joke".|$|E
2500|$|The Associated Press {{called the}} book's {{cancellation}} [...] "an astonishing end to <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>like</b> no other," [...] noting that a publisher's withdrawing {{a book for}} its content [...] "is virtually unheard of." ...|$|E

5000|$|.....it's really {{intriguing}} {{to find a}} {{book that}} deals differently with Draupadi - not a Manushi article or a Gender Studies tract on 'Mythical Women and Agency', but <b>a</b> proper <b>story,</b> <b>like</b> Vyasa's epic, where Draupadi begins. ... The 'mysterious woman' style of narration is unmistakably Divakaruni's." [...] Renuka Narayanan, Hindustan Times ...|$|R
5000|$|Geoffrey Roberts says {{similarly}} of the agreement: [...] "It's <b>a</b> good <b>story</b> but, <b>like</b> {{so many of}} Churchill's tales, {{the lily}} was somewhat gilded." ...|$|R
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Elle Magazine on March 27, 2009, Ruth Halimi stated that [...] "The police were completely off the mark. They thought {{they were dealing with}} classic bandits, but these people were beyond the norm." [...] Halimi stated that she wrote the book to [...] "alert public opinion to the danger of anti-semitism which has returned in other forms, so that <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>like</b> this can never happen again".|$|E
2500|$|The final B-side [...] "Ringo Catalogue (Kuroko Jidai Saihen-san)" [...] is a {{new song}} created by {{compiling}} sounds from Sheena's first three albums by recording engineer Uni Inoue. The project was created after Inoue wondered if sound could be woven to create <b>a</b> <b>story,</b> <b>like</b> images are for films. The song's lyrics are based on B-sides from Sheena's previously released singles. The work took three weeks for Inoue to complete.|$|E
2500|$|He had the soldier's hat, {{the worn}} knapsack, the dented canteen. But when Darius Cobb {{set out in}} the 1870s to make a still-life {{lithograph}} of Civil War artifacts, he was missing one important element - a tin cup. So, tacked onto the wall in the trompe-l'œil rendering is a scrap of paper with a sketched outline and the words [...] "Dipper Missing". [...] "Each painting has <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>like</b> this," [...] said Susan Abele, curator of [...] "Rediscovering Newton Artists, 1850-1950", at the Newton History Museum at the Jackson Homestead.|$|E
50|$|My Summer Story, {{originally}} {{released in}} theaters as It Runs in the Family, is a 1994 film {{that follows the}} further adventures of the Parker family from <b>A</b> Christmas <b>Story.</b> <b>Like</b> the previous film, {{it is based on}} semi-autobiographical stories by Jean Shepherd, primarily from his book In God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash.|$|R

2500|$|Respectively {{equivalent}} to syntagmatic and paradigmatic are the terms [...] "diachronic" [...] and [...] "synchronic". Diachronic covers {{the sort of}} analysis that conveys a sense of traversing the highs and lows of <b>a</b> <b>story,</b> <b>like</b> riding the pattern of a sine wave. The second term, synchronic, is where the story is instead absorbed as a whole, like the pattern of a circle. Most literary analyses are synchronic, offering {{a greater sense of}} unity among the components of a story. Although both structural analyses convey partial information about the story, each angle of analysis delivers a different set of information.|$|E
2500|$|Gallagher states {{early in}} Megatokyo Volume 1 {{that he and}} Caston [...] "didn't want the humor ... to rely too heavily on what might be {{considered}} 'obscure knowledge.'" [...] An article in The New York Times insists that such scenarios were unavoidable, commenting that the comic [...] "sits {{at the intersection of}} several streams of obscure knowledge," [...] including [...] "gaming and hacking; manga ... the boom in Web comics over the past few years; and comics themselves." [...] The article also held that [...] "Gallagher doesn't mean to be exclusive ... he graciously offers translation of the strip's later occasional lapses into l33t ... explains why the characters are occasionally dressed in knickers or as rabbits." [...] The newspaper went on to argue that [...] "The pleasure of <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>like</b> Megatokyo comes not in its novelistic coherence, but in its loose ranginess." ...|$|E
2500|$|The writers {{felt that}} by killing Dixie, it was {{unexpected}} and went beyond [...] "just being {{about the women}} of Fusion". Killing Dixie was {{to send a message}} that anyone could be the next to die. [...] "In order for <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>like</b> this to have real impact, it's not just about the reaction of our environment {{to the people who are}} lost," [...] Carruthers said. [...] "You have to understand that it can affect anybody, you know? It's not just the girls in Fusion who you only see once a week. It's people who are pivotal to the environment, as well. I'm trying to say this in a way that doesn't undercut what the Fusion girls have meant to the canvas, particularly those three characters who've been attacked , but a character with as much history as Dixie.... It shows that nothing is sacred and nothing is safe. By jumping off that diving board, not knowing what's at the bottom of the pool, you've now taken the story to a whole new level." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{only woman}} {{among the four}} master automatons, she is the acrobat/rope walker of the circus.
