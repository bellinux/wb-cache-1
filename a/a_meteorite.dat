5|$|Other genre {{productions}} {{that have}} been compared with the serial include the 1970 Doctor Who story Spearhead from Space. This serial features an alien entity falling to Earth in <b>a</b> <b>meteorite</b> shower; a factory taken over {{for the growth of}} the alien creature, and governmental institutions being infiltrated by servants of the aliens.|$|E
5|$|Since the Cambrian {{explosion}} {{there have}} been five distinctly identifiable mass extinctions. The last mass extinction occurred some 66 million years ago, when <b>a</b> <b>meteorite</b> collision probably triggered the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs and other large reptiles, but spared small animals such as mammals. Over the past 66million years, mammalian life diversified.|$|E
5|$|A {{corporation}} called RX Tech excavates {{the crash}} site of <b>a</b> <b>meteorite</b> that impacted on Antarctica {{millions of years ago}} and finds strange Rapa Nui-like statues alongside the grave of one of HMS Beagle's sailors. Meanwhile, archaeologist-adventurer Lara Croft is searching for an artefact known as the Infada Stone in the ruins of an ancient Indian Hindu temple once inhabited by the Infada tribe. After taking the artefact from a researcher working for RX Tech, Lara is approached by RX Tech scientist Dr. Willard, who explains that polynesians came across <b>a</b> <b>meteorite</b> crater in Antarctica thousands of years ago and found that it held incredible power. Using rock from the meteorite, they crafted four crystalline artefacts, one of which is the Infada Stone. They then fled Antarctica for unknown reasons, but in the 19th century a group of sailors travelling with Charles Darwin came to Antarctica and rediscovered the artefacts. The four artefacts were then distributed across the globe. Dr. Willard has been able to track the artefacts by using the diary of one of the sailors. Lara agrees to help him find the other three.|$|E

50|$|The Tlacotepec <b>meteorite</b> is <b>an</b> iron <b>meteorite</b> {{classified}} as <b>an</b> IVB <b>meteorite.</b> It {{is the only}} meteorite of the IVB group that is an octahedrite.|$|R
50|$|Also in the museum's {{collection}} is the Nakhalite <b>meteorite,</b> <b>a</b> Martian <b>meteorite</b> that fell {{at the village}} of El Nakhla El Baharia village in 1911, {{and is one of}} <b>a</b> very few <b>meteorites</b> known to have their origin in the planet Mars.|$|R
5|$|Halley {{may have}} been {{recorded}} as early as 467BC, but this is uncertain. A comet was recorded in ancient Greece between 468 and 466 BC; its timing, location, duration, and associated meteor shower all suggest it was Halley. According to Pliny the Elder, that same year <b>a</b> <b>meteorite</b> fell {{in the town of}} Aegospotami, in Thrace. He described it as brown in colour and the size of a wagon load. Chinese chroniclers also mention a comet in that year.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{initially}} {{ruled out}} radiation {{as the cause}} of the illness. Renan Ramirez of the Peruvian Nuclear Energy Institute stated that the medical conditions could have been caused by sulfur, arsenic or other toxins that may have melted in the extreme heat produced by the meteorite strike. Some unnamed Peruvian sources stated soon after the event occurred that it was indeed <b>a</b> <b>meteorite.</b> Later on 18 September, a Peruvian vulcanologist stated that the impact was caused by a chondrite meteorite arrival.|$|E
5|$|After the impact, villagers who had {{approached}} the impact site grew sick from a then-unexplained illness, {{with a wide}} array of symptoms. Two days later, Peruvian scientists confirmed that there had indeed been <b>a</b> <b>meteorite</b> strike, quieting widespread speculation that {{it may have been a}} geophysical rather than a celestial event. At that point, no further information on the cause of the mystery illness was known. The ground water in the local area is known to contain arsenic compounds, and the illness is now believed to have been caused by arsenic poisoning incurred when residents of the area inhaled the vapor of the boiling arsenic-contaminated water.|$|E
50|$|There will be {{a number}} after the LL in <b>a</b> <b>meteorites</b> {{classification}} type, e.g. LL3, LL5, LL6. (Types range from 3 to 7) The number indicates the amount of alteration suffered by the chondrules in the meteorite.|$|R
50|$|Fragments from Gibeon {{were used}} for centuries by the Nama people.There are also reports of their use for {{manufacture}} of various items in Tibet (see Thokcha). The Iron Man, a statue of Vaiśravaṇa carved from <b>an</b> iron <b>meteorite.,</b> <b>a</b> purported Tibetan Buddhist statue, the Iron Man, was likely carved from <b>an</b> ataxite <b>meteorite.</b> It has been speculated {{that it may be}} made from a fragment of the Chinga meteorite.|$|R
50|$|The primary {{research}} use of kamacite is to {{shed light}} on <b>a</b> <b>meteorite's</b> history. Whether it is looking at the shock history in the iron structures or the conditions during the formation of the meteorite using the kamacite-taenite boundary understanding kamacite is key to understanding our universe.|$|R
5|$|Beads {{made from}} {{meteoric}} iron in 3500BC or earlier {{were found in}} Gerzah, Egypt by G. A. Wainwright. The beads contain 7.5% nickel, which is a signature of meteoric origin since iron found in the Earth's crust generally has only minuscule nickel impurities. Meteoric iron was highly regarded due to its origin in the heavens and was often used to forge weapons and tools. For example, a dagger made of meteoric iron {{was found in the}} tomb of Tutankhamun, containing similar proportions of iron, cobalt, and nickel to <b>a</b> <b>meteorite</b> discovered in the area, deposited by an ancient meteor shower. Items that were likely made of iron by Egyptians date from 3000 to 2500BC. Meteoritic iron is comparably soft and ductile and easily forged by cold working but may get brittle when heated because of the nickel content.|$|E
5|$|Command & Conquer {{is set in}} an {{alternate}} timeline, after <b>a</b> <b>meteorite</b> crashed near the river Tiber in Italy in 1995. The meteorite brings with it an extremely toxic alien substance called Tiberium, which becomes extremely valuable because {{of its ability to}} absorb and crystallize precious metals from the surrounding soil. An ancient, cultic secret society called the Brotherhood of Nod claims to have foreseen the potentials of this new substance, investing in the development of technology to harvest and refine Tiberium crystals ahead of the scientific community. Nod soon controls nearly half of the supply and uses these assets to sustain a rapidly growing army of followers worldwide. The group is led by a self-proclaimed messianic figure known only as Kane.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy V {{features}} five player characters, {{though only}} four of which are playable at a given time. Bartz Klauser is a traveling adventurer who becomes involved in the story when he investigates the site of <b>a</b> <b>meteorite</b> strike. Lenna Charlotte Tycoon is a princess of Tycoon who follows her father to investigate the Wind Shrine's Crystal. Early on, Bartz finds her unconscious and saves her from goblins. Galuf Doe is a mysterious old man who was discovered unconscious near the meteorite with a case of amnesia. Faris Scherwiz is a pirate captain who captures Bartz, Lenna, and Galuf {{when they try to}} steal her ship; she is revealed to be Sarisa Scherwill Tycoon in disguise. Krile Mayer Baldesion is the granddaughter of Galuf who journeys with him to the planet and receives his abilities.|$|E

5|$|Peter Parker {{plans to}} propose to Mary Jane Watson, {{who has just}} made her Broadway musical debut. <b>A</b> <b>meteorite</b> lands at Central Park, and an {{extraterrestrial}} symbiote follows Peter to his apartment. Harry Osborn, seeking vengeance after his father's death, attacks Peter with weapons based on his father's Green Goblin technology. The battle ends in a stalemate, with Harry crashing out and developing amnesia, wiping out his memory of Peter as Spider-Man. Meanwhile, police pursue escaped prisoner Flint Marko, who visits his wife and dying daughter before fleeing again, and falling into an experimental particle accelerator that fuses his body with the surrounding sand, transforming him into the Sandman.|$|E
5|$|The Shooting Star shared plot {{similarities}} with The Chase of the Golden Meteor, a 1908 {{novel by}} pioneering French science-fiction writer Jules Verne. As in Hergé's story, Verne's novel features {{an expedition to}} the North Atlantic to find <b>a</b> <b>meteorite</b> fragment containing a new element. In both stories, the competing expedition teams were led by an eccentric professor and a Jewish banker, and Verne's novel had a Doktor Schultze to Hergé's Professor Schulze—both from the University of Jena. Hergé denied deliberately copying Verne's story, {{saying that he had}} only read one of the French novelist's works; {{it is possible that the}} influence from Verne came via Jacques Van Melkebeke, Hergé's friend and assistant, who was a fan of the genre. The Swedish expedition member Eric Björgenskjöld physically resembles a real person: Auguste Piccard, who later became Hergé's inspiration for Professor Calculus.|$|E
5|$|The {{stone was}} venerated at the Kaaba in pre-Islamic pagan times. According to Islamic tradition, {{it was set}} intact into the Kaaba's wall by the prophet Muhammad in the year 605 AD, five years before his first revelation. Since then it has been broken {{into a number of}} {{fragments}} and is now cemented into a silver frame {{in the side of the}} Kaaba. Its physical appearance is that of a fragmented dark rock, polished smooth by the hands of pilgrims. Islamic tradition holds that it fell from heaven as a guide for Adam and Eve to build an altar. It has often been described as <b>a</b> <b>meteorite,</b> a hypothesis which is now uncertain.|$|E

5|$|This large {{collection}} of meteorites allows {{a better understanding}} of the abundance of meteorite types in the solar system and how meteorites relate to asteroids and comets. New types of meteorites and rare meteorites have been found. Among these are pieces blasted off the Moon, and probably Mars, by impacts. These specimens, particularly ALH84001 discovered by ANSMET, are at the centre of the controversy about possible evidence of microbial life on Mars. Because meteorites in space absorb and record cosmic radiation, the time elapsed since the meteorite hit the Earth can be determined from laboratory studies. The elapsed time since fall, or terrestrial residence age, of <b>a</b> <b>meteorite</b> represents more information that might be useful in environmental studies of Antarctic ice sheets.|$|E
5|$|Tomb Raider III: Adventures of Lara Croft, {{or simply}} Tomb Raider III, is an action-adventure video game {{developed}} by Core Design {{and published by}} Eidos Interactive. It was originally released for the PlayStation and Microsoft Windows platforms in 1998. Tomb Raider III is the third title in the Tomb Raider video game series and a sequel to Tomb Raider II. The story of the game follows archaeologist-adventurer Lara Croft as she embarks upon a quest to recover four pieces of <b>a</b> <b>meteorite</b> that are scattered across the world. To progress through the game, the player must explore five locations (India, South Pacific, London, Nevada, and Antarctica) and complete a series of levels that involve solving puzzles, jumping over obstacles, and defeating enemies.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, a young {{traveller}} named Bartz, {{resting in}} the woods near Tycoon, witnesses <b>a</b> <b>meteorite</b> plunge to the planet's surface just outside the castle. Bartz promptly investigates, discovering Lenna lying unconscious from attack. After rescuing her, they discover {{an old man in}} the debris with partial amnesia named Galuf. Lenna explains that she had been {{on her way to the}} Wind Shrine after her father. Galuf suddenly recalls that it was his original destination as well, opting to accompany her. Though the trio part ways, Bartz soon encounters Lenna and Galuf again assaulted by monsters in a quaking valley. The three travel together, finding all land routes blockaded by the upheavals caused by the meteorite's fall. Exploring an underground cavern, they encounter a den of pirates and their leader, Faris. With the help of the pirate captain, the group makes its way to the Wind Shrine to discover the shattered Crystal, but no sign of the missing king. The shards react to their presence, however, and an image of Tycoon appears, explaining to them that they must protect those Crystals that yet remain.|$|E
