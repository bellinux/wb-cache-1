500|$|The next scene {{takes place}} in the O.R. and became a {{defining}} moment in the series. As surgeons are working on wounded soldiers, Radar enters, visibly shaken and not wearing the required surgical mask. Trapper chides him for this, but Radar, too dazed to react (or care), delivers a shocking announcement (and quite possibly his most famous line): [...] "I have a message. Lieutenant Colonel... Henry Blake's plane... was shot down... over the Sea of Japan. It spun in... there were no survivors." [...] Radar leaves the O.R. as the camera pans the stunned and silent hospital staff, including Trapper and a teary-eyed Hawkeye, who continue to operate on the wounded, and even Majors Burns and Houlihan, who <b>are</b> <b>crying.</b>|$|E
500|$|Critics {{were also}} divided about the game's {{graphics}} and pacing. Destructoid stated that [...] "while detailed, most environments alternate between concrete gray and brick red." [...] GameSpot echoed {{criticism of the}} [...] "lack of visual variety." [...] IGN added that [...] "the world map and dungeons <b>are</b> <b>crying</b> for more detail." [...] Despite this, Destructoid allowed that [...] "the colorful clothing helps offset the game's otherwise limited palette." [...] IGN disliked the fact that [...] "large difficulty spikes are interjected every now and then" [...] and [...] "Resonance of Fate is built for those that enjoy the grind." [...] In contrast, the GameSpot reviewer liked {{this aspect of the}} game, [...] "You need to use every trick you have learned, and a few you may not have even realized yet, to tackle these treacherous monsters, but there is nothing quite as sweet as toppling something that has tormented you for so long." ...|$|E
500|$|Present {{throughout}} the songs background {{is the use}} of violins and a choir, as well as guitar, string instruments, congas and a cajon. [...] However it does make subtle use of synths and electronic sounds. Musically and lyrically, it is influenced by Contemporary Christian music, and has a gospel feel, while including standard pop and R. The song opens with Bieber singing, [...] "And I pray" [...] over a keyboard, while the song's chorus repeats one simple refrain, [...] "I close my eyes and I can see a better day/ I close my eyes and pray." [...] In the lyrics, Bieber [...] "recognizes the pain and suffering in the world" [...] and then offers [...] "a passive solution" [...] through lines such as [...] "Children <b>are</b> <b>crying</b> / soldiers are dying / Some people don't have a home," [...] before compromising, [...] "I know there's sunshine beyond that rain / good times beyond that pain." [...] Vocally, Bieber's vocals are sung in a lower key compared to previous singles.|$|E

6000|$|Sylvie <b>was</b> <b>crying</b> too by this time, and {{she said}} nothing but [...] "Bruno, dear!" [...] and [...] "I never was so happy before," [...] though why these two {{children}} {{who had never been}} so happy before should both <b>be</b> <b>crying</b> <b>was</b> a mystery to me.|$|R

500|$|The {{political}} fallout of the queen's actions led to citywide political rallies and meetings in Honolulu. Anti-monarchists, annexationists, and leading Reformist politicians including Lorrin A. Thurston formed the Committee of Safety {{in protest of}} the [...] "revolutionary" [...] action of the queen and conspired to depose her. In response, royalists and loyalists formed the Committee of Law and Order and met at the palace square on January16. White, Nāwahī, Bush, Wilcox, and Antone Rosa and other pro-monarchist leaders gave speeches in support for the queen and the government. However, {{in their attempts to}} be cautious and not provoke the opposition, they adopted a resolution stating that [...] "the Government does not and will not seek any modification of the Constitution by any other means than those provided in the organic law". In this mass meeting, White also gave a speech denying the violent charges printed in the press against him, claiming that [...] "the other fellows, meaning the Reformers, <b>are</b> <b>crying</b> out before they are hurt" [...] (another paraphrasing published in The Daily Bulletin). Minister Cornwell (one of the individuals the papers claimed he intended to harm) later stated in his testimony in the Blount Report: ...|$|E
500|$|The game's ending was so {{unexpected}} that UEFA President Lennart Johansson {{had left}} his seat in the stands before Sheringham's equaliser {{to make his way}} down to the pitch to present the European Cup trophy, already decorated with Bayern ribbons. When emerging from the tunnel at the final whistle, he was stunned. [...] "I can't believe it", he later said, [...] "The winners <b>are</b> <b>crying</b> and the losers are dancing." [...] When the two teams went to collect their medals, Matthäus received his runners-up medal but removed it from his neck almost immediately. He never won the competition, having moved to play in the United States for the MetroStars Major League Soccer team before Bayern next won the European Cup in 2001. Matthäus later commented that [...] "it was not the best team that won but the luckiest". As captain of Manchester United, Peter Schmeichel should have received his medal last, but instead he went up first before having to return {{to the back of the}} queue with Alex Ferguson; the pair then lifted the trophy together, surrounded by the rest of Manchester United's players, including David May, who memorably climbed the presentation podium to a position of prominence in the celebration photographs.|$|E

40|$|Bacillus thuringiensis is a ubiquitous, gram-positive and spore-forming bacterium. During sporulation, it {{produces}} intracellular crystal (<b>cry)</b> proteins, which <b>are</b> toxic to insects. The genetic diversity of B. thuringiensis strains shows regional differences. Thus, each habitat may contain novel strains with new insecticide. The {{aim of this}} study was to isolate B. thuringiensis strains from different environments of Mizoram, India, and to identify the cry gene content of the isolates using PCR. The universal primers specific to cry 1, cry 2, cry 3, cry 4 and <b>cry</b> 9 genes <b>were</b> used to detect the type of cry gene carried by each environmental isolate. Altogether, a total of 42 <b>cry</b> genes <b>were</b> detected out of which 12 <b>were</b> <b>cry</b> 1, 5 <b>were</b> <b>cry</b> 2, 3 <b>were</b> <b>cry</b> 3, 18 <b>were</b> <b>cry</b> 4 and 22 <b>were</b> <b>cry</b> 9 out of 45 selected strains.

2500|$|The victory sparked off wild celebrations, {{and many}} South African spectators {{broke down in}} tears of joy. Tony Greig himself sounded emotionally {{exhausted}} as he said, [...] "Look, there are tears, they <b>are</b> <b>crying</b> out there! The South Africans at the Bullring today have seen the best one day international ever played." ...|$|E
2500|$|One of the film's harshest reviews {{came from}} New Yorker {{magazine}} critic Pauline Kael: [...] "Everything {{in this movie}} is fudged ever so humanistically, in a perfunctory, low-pressure way.

2500|$|The song {{has also}} been remixed, with altered lyrics, for {{political}} purposes. It {{has been used in}} Argentina by Florencio Randazzo, Evert Van Tooren and Agustín Rossi for their respective TV advertisements for the 2017 midterm elections. Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro used it to call for voting in the controversial Constitutional Assembly election. Luis Fonsi, Daddy Yankee and Erika Ender showed their displeasure with the unauthorized use of the song for political purposes in Venezuela, criticizing Maduro's government and describing the use of the song as [...] "propaganda." [...] Fonsi said that he was never consulted or have he authorized the use of the song for political ends, [...] "less so {{in the context of the}} deplorable situation affecting a country that I love so much as Venezuela." [...] He also stated that his music is [...] "for all of those that want to listen to it and enjoy it, not to use it as propaganda that tries to manipulate the will of the people that <b>are</b> <b>crying</b> out for their freedom and a better future." [...] Despite the criticism by the artists, President Maduro continued to use the remix promoting the election, using it during a cadena. On August 16, 2017, English television host James Corden remixed the song to comment on American President Donald Trump during his talk show The Late Late Show with James Corden.|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, 16 {{years after}} her debut appearance, Kasumi was {{redesigned}} to look less cartoon-like and more realistic with a [...] "grown up" [...] appearance in DOA5. The game's art director Yuta Saito said, [...] "From DOA4 we wanted to evolve the characters in a slightly realistic direction. The most difficult, and you don't have to ask, is Kasumi. Kasumi {{is the face of}} DOA and the eternal heroine. And for such a popular character like Kasumi, to change her form we really needed a lot of courage and it really was a big challenge. But if we didn't do that, we couldn't make DOA5 and we wouldn't be able to show you anything." [...] Producer Yasuke Hayashi said the processn of remodeling Kasumi has sparked most disputes in the development team, especially since she is [...] "a character that is not so much out on the table, with [...] hidden feelings, and it's been difficult to express such a 'hidden look'." [...] GamesRadar noted that [...] "the manga influences on her facial featureswhile still apparenthave been scaled right back nd her boobs seem less ludicrously unmanageable." [...] Itagaki, who has left Team Ninja in 2008, said in 2014: [...] "Straightly speakin’, my daughter was totally ruined, spoiled. I can’t/shouldn’t avert my eyes from that fact. Many DOA fans here <b>are</b> <b>crying,</b> I will do something for DOA after I finished Devil's Third." ...|$|E
