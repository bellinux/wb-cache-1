40|$|A nonzero {{residual}} {{intersymbol interference}} (ISI) causes the symbol error rate (SER) to increase where the achievable SER may not answer any {{more on the}} system’s requirements. Recently, a closed-form approximated expression was derived by the same author for the residual ISI obtained by nonblind <b>adaptive</b> <b>equalizers</b> for the single-input single-output (SISO) case. Up to now, there does not exist a closed-form expression for the residual ISI obtained by nonblind <b>adaptive</b> <b>equalizers</b> for the single-input multiple-output (SIMO) case.

50|$|Communication {{systems that}} {{transmit}} data over bandlimited channels usually implement pulse shaping to avoid interference {{caused by the}} bandwidth limitation. If the channel frequency response is flat and the shaping filter has a finite bandwidth, {{it is possible to}} communicate with no ISI at all. Often the channel response is not known beforehand, and an <b>adaptive</b> <b>equalizer</b> is used to compensate the frequency response.|$|E
50|$|However, the Gaussian filter {{increases}} the modulation memory {{in the system}} and causes intersymbol interference, making it more difficult to differentiate between different transmitted data values and requiring more complex channel equalization algorithms such as an <b>adaptive</b> <b>equalizer</b> at the receiver.

40|$|When {{digital signals}} are {{transmitted}} through frequency selective communication channels, {{one of the}} problems that arise is inter-symbol interference (ISI). To compensate corruptions caused by ISI and to find the original information being transmitted, equalization process is performed at the receiver. Since communication channels are time varying and random in nature, <b>adaptive</b> <b>equalizers</b> must be used to learn and subsequently track the time varying characteristics of the channel. Traditional equalizers are based on finding the inverse of the channel and compensating the channel’s influence using inverse filter technique. There exists no equalizer for non-invertible channels. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) can be applied to this for achieving better performance than conventional methods. We have proposed a model of neural equalizer using MLP (multi layer perceptron), which reduces the mean square error to minimum and eliminates the effects of ISI.

50|$|Another {{added benefit}} for FPD-Link III is the {{adaptive}} equalization {{built into the}} deserializer. The input signal to the deserializer usually has diminished integrity. This typically results from the inter-symbol interference (ISI) due to cable loss. The <b>adaptive</b> <b>equalizer</b> can sense the poor signal and restore it to the original integrity. This feature is useful in every application where the cable can vary in length, operating temperature, and humidity because these variables affect the ISI resulting from the low-pass filter effect of the cable.|$|E

40|$|Fuzzy {{logic is}} the {{principles}} of imprecise knowledge. Fuzzy adaptive equalizers are adaptive equalizers that apply the concepts of fuzzy logic. The main merit of applying fuzzy adaptive equalizers in powerline channel equalization is that linguistic information (fuzzy IF-THEN rules) and numerical information (input-output pairs) can be combined into the equalizers. The adaptive algorithms adjust {{the parameters of the}} membership functions which characterize the fuzzy concepts in the IF-THEN rules, by minimizing some criterion function. In this paper, we introduce a new type of fuzzy <b>adaptive</b> <b>equalizer</b> using extended Kalman filter (EKF) algorithm for powerline channel equalization.

40|$|The use of <b>adaptive</b> <b>equalizers</b> at {{the front}} end of {{receivers}} is becoming a necessity as the data rates increase without channel improvements. <b>Adaptive</b> <b>equalizers</b> can be implemented using data-aided or non-data-aided schemes [1], with the latter requiring less area and power. Previous non-data-aided adaptive schemes [2 - 3] implement an asynchronous analog algorithm where the power spectrum of the received signal is checked for balance around a threshold frequency. Similarly, [4] proposes a digital adaptive algorithm which is based on the detection of specific 5 -bit patterns. In all three works [2 - 4], however, adaptation is provided only for equalizers with a single coefficient, which are suitable for well-behaved channels. In contrast, this paper presents a digital adaptive engine for an equalizer with two coefficients: one adjusting the equalizer gain at the Nyquist frequency (f N) and one at f N/ 2. Furthermore, the proposed engine is asynchronous; it can function when driven by a blind clock at the receiver. This is useful as it allows the adaptation process to start even when the CDR has not yet achieved lock. This also avoids a deadlock situation where the CDR an...|$|R
40|$|<b>Adaptive</b> <b>equalizers</b> remove signal {{distortion}} attributed to intersymbol interference in band-limited channels. The tap coefficients of <b>adaptive</b> <b>equalizers</b> are time-varying {{and can be}} adapted using several methods. When {{these do not include}} the transmission of a training sequence, it is referred to as blind equalization. The radius-adjusted approach is a method to achieve blind equalizer tap adaptation based on the equalizer output radius for quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) signals. Static circular contours are defined around an estimated symbol in a QAM constellation, which create regions that correspond to fixed step sizes and weighting factors. The equalizer tap adjustment consists of a linearly weighted sum of adaptation criteria that is scaled by a variable step size. This approach is the basis of two new algorithms: the radius-adjusted modified multitmodulus algorithm (RMMA) and the radius-adjusted multimodulus decision-directed algorithm (RMDA). An extension of the radius-adjusted approach is the selective update method, which is a computationally-efficient method for equalization. The selective update method employs a 2 ̆ 2 stop-and-go 2 ̆ 2 strategy based on the equalizer output radius to selectively update the equalizer tap coefficients, thereby, reducing the number of computations in steady-state operation.

We consider a simple BPSK Transmitter-Receiver system connected by a noisy band-limited channel. The data is first pulse shaped with a Raised Cosine filter which reduces the effect of Inter Symbol Interference (ISI) caused by finite channel bandwidth. The top level block diagram is shown below. The effects of noise and finite channel bandwidth are ignored for the initial simulation setup. Due to multipath propagation we have ISI. An <b>adaptive</b> <b>equalizer</b> is used to reduce the effects of ISI. The equalizer is a discrete time FIR filter. You are to implement an <b>adaptive</b> <b>equalizer.</b> The equalizer uses an LMS-based adaptive algorithm to train its coefficients and thereby produce a transfer function which approximates the inverse of the channel transfer function.
