On 18 and 19 September 1990, the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications visited the region <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> proposed areas of the Triangle Link, the Hardanger Bridge and the Folgefonna Tunnel. By then it had been established that the Triangle Link would not need state grants, as it could be entirely financed with tolls. Tore Haugen, Conservative parliamentarian from Akershus, proposed that the project be considered independent of the regular national road plans. However, Lars Gunnar Lie, Minister of Transport and Communications from the Christian Democratic Party, stated that he planned a single report to Parliament for all three projects.|$|E

25|$|Several years later, a king named Sagara magically {{acquired}} sixty thousand sons. One day, King Sagara {{performed a}} ritual of worship {{for the good}} of the kingdom. One of the integral parts of the ritual was a horse, which was stolen by the jealous Indra. Sagara sent all his sons all over the earth to search for the horse. They found it in the nether-world (or Underworld) next to a meditating sage Kapil tied by Lord Indra(the king of Swarg). Believing that the sage had stolen the horse, they hurled insults at him and caused his penance to be disturbed. The sage opened his eyes for the first time in several years <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sons of Sagara. With this glance, all sixty thousand were burnt to death.|$|E

He was the Emperor (Khagan) but not a dictator. Like all Mongols at his time, he was raised and educated as a warrior from childhood, and as the son of Genghis Khan, he was a part of his father's plan to {{establish}} a world empire. His military experience was notable for his willingness to listen to his generals and adapt to circumstances. He was an extremely pragmatic person, much like his father, <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end rather than the means. His steadiness of character and dependability were the traits that his father most valued, and that gained him the role of successor to his father, despite his two older brothers.|$|E
25|$|The task {{of making}} a {{recommendation}} for a permanent solution for the national airline was given to a new Civil Aviation Board, which had Falck as a board member. They came with their recommendation on 28 November 1945, which favored a single, privately owned Norwegian flag carrier, with a broad ownership, who would receive a concession for the operation of all domestic and international routes. Following the Norwegian parliamentary election, 1945 on 8 October, the Labor Party received a majority, with 76 of 150 seats. Also the Norwegian Communist Party did its best election ever, receiving 11 seats. A proposition {{was made by the}} Ministry of Defense on 18 January 1946, and sent to parliament. It discussed several options, such as creating a government agency or a state-owned limited company, permitting several airlines to operate the different routes, <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> possibility that the shipowners were purchasing DNL shares to hinder competition with their shipping lines. It concluded with a part private, part state-owned company was preferred, and that the state should purchase shares for NOK5 million. While the Labor Party at the time was in favor of nationalization, the proposition stated that this was a possibility to limit the state's spending of dearly needed capital.|$|E

500|$|The {{principal}} photography {{produced a}} high demand for extras as zombies. In {{an interview with}} MTV News, special effects artist Greg Nicotero stated that while anyone was welcome to audition, the producers of the show were looking specifically for people who possessed exceptional height and thin features. Casting for extras took approximately three days. Once accepted, the extras {{would be sent to}} [...] "zombie school" [...] for training and preparing for filming. Nicotero stated that [...] "it was interesting because I initially thought my experience with zombie movies is you just let them do whatever they want to do. George [...] always said, 'You show 50 people one movement, then you have 50 people doing all the same thing.' So we sort of just lined them up and said, 'Let's see what your zombie walk would look like,' and then they would do it and we would say, 'Try this or try that.' You know, sort of fine tuning everybody." [...] Alongside with Darabont, Nicotero had previously collaborated with Romero on several occasions, <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> structure of the zombies in his films for inspiration. [...] "It's not that I'm against [...] It's just not what I grew up with. It's interesting, too, because a couple takes we did, where a couple of the zombies kind of broke into a run, and after one take Frank's like, 'Did they run too fast? They shouldn't be running. Slow them down.' This is trying to be creepy and moody and, you know, you're building up all this kind of scary tension." ...|$|E

Getting There: Steps Towards a Green Society was {{published}} in 1990, <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> strategies of green politics. A Green Manifesto for the 1990s, also written in 1990, outlined the Green vision. In 1994, a book examining the roots of ecological politics, Green History: A Reader in Environmental Literature, Philosophy, and Politics and Weaving a Bower Against Endless Night: An Illustrated History of the Green Party as a Green Party publication appeared. Having taken a BSc in Archaeology at the University of London, he subsequently completed a PhD at the University of the West of England, later published in a revised form in 1999 as a book entitled Earth First! and the Anti-Roads Movement: Radical Environmentalism and Comparative Social Movements. Academic reviews for the book were mixed. One academic reviewer commented that the book offered [...] "valuable and often original information about the radical environmentalist movement" [...] but [...] "fails to provide a systematic analysis of the topic" [...] and uncritically {{paid little attention to}} possible personal agendas of the activists interviewed.|$|E

2500|$|Jerome Bruner {{is notable}} for {{integrating}} Piaget's cognitive approaches into educational psychology. He advocated for discovery learning where teachers create a problem solving environment {{that allows the}} student to question, explore and experiment. In his book The Process of Education Bruner stated that {{the structure of the}} material and the cognitive abilities of the person are important in learning. He emphasized the importance of the subject matter. He also believed that how the subject was structured was important for the student's understanding of the subject and it is the goal of the teacher to structure the subject {{in a way that was}} easy for the student to understand. [...] In the early 1960s Bruner went to Africa to teach math and science to school children, which influenced his view as schooling as a cultural institution. [...] Bruner was also influential in the development of MACOS, Man a Course of Study, which was an educational program that combined anthropology and science. The program explored human evolution and social behavior. [...] He also helped with the development of the head start program. He was interested in the influence of culture on education <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> impact of poverty on educational development.|$|E
2500|$|When Walcott {{got back}} to Liston <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{knockdown}} timekeeper, Francis McDonough, {{to pick up the}} count, Liston had fallen back on the canvas. Walcott never did pick up the count. He said he could not hear McDonough, who did not have a microphone. Also, McDonough did not bang on the canvas or motion a number count with his fingers. McDonough, however, claimed Walcott was looking at the crowd and never at him. After Liston arose, Walcott wiped off his gloves. He then left the fighters to go over to McDonough. [...] "The timekeeper was waving both hands and saying, 'I counted him outâ€”the fight is over,'" [...] Walcott said after the fight. [...] "Nat Fleischer [...] was sitting beside McDonough and he was waving his hands, too, saying it was over." [...] Walcott then rushed back to the fighters, who had resumed boxing, and stopped the fightâ€”awarding Ali a first-round knockout victory. [...] Strict interpretation of the knockdown/count rule states it is the referee's count and not the timekeeper's that is the official count. [...] Furthermore, that count cannot be started until the fighter scoring the knockdown goes to and remains in a neutral corner. [...] Ali did neither. [...] Walcott never began a count in the ring because of Ali's non-compliance and his physical struggle with getting Ali to go to that neutral corner. [...] The interference of ringside reporters regarding interpretation of the rules, the fight stoppage and the controversy after the fight had not been seen since the Long Count Fight between Champion Gene Tunney and challenger Jack Dempsey in 1927.|$|E
2500|$|Volney Mathison (chiropractor, radio engineer, psychologist, and hypnotist) {{built an}} EDA meter {{based on a}} Wheatstone bridge, a vacuum tube amplifier, and a large moving-coil meter that {{projected}} {{an image of the}} needle on the wall. He patented his device in 1954 as an electropsychometer or E-meter, and it {{came to be known as}} the [...] "Mathison Electropsychometer". In Mathison's words, the E-meter [...] "has a needle that swings back and forth across a scale when a patient holds on to two electrical contacts". Mathison recorded in his book, Electropsychometry, that the idea of the E-meter came to him in 1950 while listening to a lecture by L. Ron Hubbard:p.64In 1950 ... I next attended a series of lectures being given by a very controversial figure, who several times emphasized that perhaps the major problem of psychotherapy was the difficulty of maintaining the communication of accurate or valid data from the patient to the therapist. ... it appeared to me that the psychogalvanometer showed most promise.L. Ron Hubbard told of that encounter in a 1952 recorded lecture:This machine, the electropsychometer, has been acting as a pilot since about the first of January 1952. Very early I wanted a pilot; I had to have some method of metering preclears which was not dependent at all upon opinion or judgment. And I went out <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> existing lie detector equipment and I could not find anything which would do a job of work. Now, Volney Mathison out on the Coast heard a talk out there one day, and I mentioned this fact. ... I had one of the fanciest electroencephalographs made and it didnâ€™t do anything very much, police detectors didnâ€™t do anything very much, and Mathison went to work and he floated a current within a current. This machine is relatively simple, but itâ€™s a current floating inside another current [...]. And I am, by the way, very much indebted to Mathison just on this basis of all of a sudden having a pilot.Mathison began working with Hubbard in 1951 and that year filed application for his first E-meter patent, [...] [...] After the partnership broke up in 1954, Mathison continued improving his E-meters with additional patents ( [...] , [...] ), marketing them through his own company and publications, retaining many of the concepts and terms from his time with Hubbard.|$|E
