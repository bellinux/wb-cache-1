50|$|Pop-up {{satellite}} archival tags (PSATs), {{also known}} simply as pop-up archival tags (PATs), are just like archival tags, except {{they are designed to}} release at a preset time, like 30 days. They then float to the surface and send their data via an Argos satellite back to the laboratory for two weeks, which is the life of its battery. Even when the battery dies, the data are saved on the tag, so if it is ever recovered, the whole data set can be downloaded. This tag is useful for animals that do not {{spend a lot of time}} at the surface, and are not caught often. Numerous white sharks have been tagged with this tag. The tags are attached to white sharks by inserting a small surgical titanium anchor into it. On elephant seals, the tag is glued to the fur. Connecting the tag to the anchor is a thin line that loops around a metal pin at the base of the tag. This metal pin is connected to a battery. A clock in the tag turns the battery on at a preprogrammed time. When the battery turns on, the <b>attachment</b> <b>pin</b> dissolves. The tag floats to the surface and starts transmitting data to one of the Argos satellites.|$|E
50|$|The fin <b>attachment</b> <b>pins</b> and sleeves in the Convair 580 {{airliner}} were {{specified by}} the aircraft manufacturer to be hardened to a Vickers Hardness specification of 390HV5, the '5' meaning five kiloponds. However, on the aircraft flying Partnair Flight 394 the pins were later found to have been replaced with sub-standard parts, leading to rapid wear and finally loss of the aircraft. On examination, accident investigators found that the sub-standard pins had a hardness value of only some 200-230HV5.|$|R

5000|$|When {{a sailor}} is {{promoted}} to petty officer third class, it is traditional for sailors already holding that or a higher enlisted rank to [...] "tack on the crow." [...] Originally this custom involved a recently promoted sailor's fellow petty officers taking turns stitching the new rank insignia on the sailor's uniform, the rushed needlework {{referred to as}} [...] "tacking." [...] More recently the custom {{has taken on a}} different form, being done with a gesture ranging from a light tap to a hard punch over the new petty officer's sleeve insignia. This, however, has lately been deemed [...] "hazing," [...] and as such individuals involved in this practice can be subject to disciplinary action. This disciplinary action often includes the individual being demoted. The [...] "tacking on of the crow" [...] has also been known to cause serious injury. It is not just patches that are [...] "tacked on," [...] but also metal insignia in the chest area that have sharp <b>attachment</b> <b>pins,</b> such as the insignia for surface warfare or submarine service. A hard enough punch can cause the attachment points to pierce a sailor's skin. Commanding officers are also known to direct the ship corpsman to perform physical exams for possible abuse and to report all injuries to newly promoted personnel, so punishment cannot be avoided.|$|R

40|$|The {{technology}} {{and design of}} lower limb prosthetics have evolved greatly since their introduction. The current study proposed to compare {{the effects of a}} conventional <b>pin</b> socket <b>attachment</b> and a vacuum socket attachment for a transtibial amputee. Whereas traditional measurements of gait utilize force plates and camera systems, this study made use of a small tri-axial load cell located {{at the base of the}} socket to measure the forces and moments exerted during a regular gait cycle. The hypothesis tested stated that a vacuum pump socket attachment, when compared to a non-vacuum (pin) socket, will have a significant effect on the forces and moments developed during gait. The forces and moments load the residual limb and it is generally believed that a vacuum socket will produce a more favorable loading than a conventional <b>pin</b> <b>attachment</b> socket. If changes in forces or moments can be measured, this may provide clinical evidence supporting the use of vacuum pumps on prostheses. The hypothesis was tested using a Student-t -test which compared the maximum resultant force and moments during heel strike and toe-off between the vacuum and pin systems. Two subjects, S 1 and S 2, were tested with both vacuum and <b>pin</b> <b>attachment</b> sockets. S 1 exhibited a statistically significant effect on toe-off when wearing the vacuum socket. The rest of the variables showed no statistical significance due to the vacuum socket. S 2 did not exhibit a statistical significance due to the vacuum socket during heel-strike or toe-off. The beneficial effects were not established by the results alone, but the literature review and subject assessment of a vacuum pump prosthesis offered support for the general conclusion that vacuum pump sockets produce beneficial gait outcomes. Further analysis is needed to examine the effects on the forces and moments that occur on the sagittal, frontal, and transverse anatomical planes to determine whether use of a vacuum socket results in more or less force and moment when walking. Also needing further examination is whether a vacuum socket helps to stabilize the gait of a transtibial amputee...|$|R
40|$|High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) can be {{used for}} the {{localized}} heating of biological tissue through the conversion of sound waves into heat. Although originally developed for human medicine, HIFU may also be used to weaken the <b>attachment</b> of <b>pin</b> bones in fish fillets to enable easier removal of such bones. This was shown in the present study, where a series of experiments were performed on HIFU phantoms and fillets of cod and salmon. In thin objects such as fish fillets, the heat is mainly dissipated at the surfaces. However, bones inside the fillet absorb ultrasound energy more efficiently than the surrounding tissue, resulting in a “self-focusing” heating of the bones. Salmon skin was found to effectively block the ultrasound, resulting in a significantly lower heating effect in fillets with skin. Cod skin partly blocked the ultrasound, but only to a small degree, enabling HIFU treatment through the skin. The treatment of fillets to reduce the <b>pin</b> bone <b>attachment</b> yielded an average reduction in the required pulling force by 50 % in cod fillets with skin, with little muscle denaturation, and 72 % in skinned fillets, with significant muscle denaturation. Salmon fillets were treated from the muscle side of the fillet to circumvent the need for penetration through skin. The treatment resulted in a 30 % reduction in the peak pulling force and 10 % reduction in the total pulling work, with a slight denaturation of the fillet surface...|$|R
40|$|Hot pin {{pull test}} is {{frequently}} {{used for the}} pad crater evaluation. Although it carries several merits, it still has certain drawbacks such as time consuming and causing potential thermal impact on the PCB during the <b>pin</b> <b>attachment</b> process. In this paper, an innovative cold pin pull test method with pre-fabricated pin arrays is introduced. A set of fixture is designed and manufactured in advance. An array of pins can {{be attached to the}} test board at one time. With this fixture, instead of attaching the pin one by one, the test panel with pin arrays can be prepared after only two times of reflow without severe thermal impact. Compared with the conventional cold ball pull tests, this newly developed method cannot only equally exhibit the pad crater characteristics of the PCB, but also reduces the scattering in testing results. These conclusions are well proven by the experimental data generated in the present study. © 2013 IEEE...|$|R
50|$|The first orbiting, {{unmanned}} {{satellite to}} be repaired in space, SMM was notable in that its useful life compared with similar spacecraft was significantly increased by the direct intervention of a manned space mission. During STS-41-C in April 1984, the Space Shuttle Challenger rendezvoused with the SMM, astronauts James van Hoften and George Nelson attempted {{to use the}} Manned Maneuvering Unit to capture the satellite and to bring it into the orbiter's payload bay for repairs and servicing. The plan was to use an astronaut-piloted Maneuvering Unit to grapple the satellite with the Trunion <b>Pin</b> <b>Attachment</b> Device (TPAD) mounted between the hand controllers of the Maneuvering Unit, null its rotation rates, and allow the Shuttle to bring it into the Shuttle's payload bay for stowage. Three attempts to grapple the satellite using the TPAD failed. The TPAD jaws could not lock onto Solar Max because of an obstructing grommet on the satellite not included in its blueprints.|$|R
40|$|Pin bones {{represent}} {{a major problem}} for processing and quality of fish products. Development of methods of removal requires better knowledge of the <b>pin</b> bones’ <b>attachment</b> to the muscle and structures involved in the breakdown during loosening. In this study, pin bones from cod and salmon were dissected from fish fillets after slaughter or storage on ice for 5 days, and thereafter analysed with molecular methods, which revealed major differences between these species before and after storage. The connective tissue (CT) attaches the pin bone to the muscle in cod, while the pin bones in salmon are embedded in adipose tissue. Collagens, elastin, lectin-binding proteins and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are all components of the attachment site, and this differ between salmon and cod, resulting in a CT in cod that is more resistant to enzymatic degradation compared to the CT in salmon. Structural differences are reflected in the composition of transcriptome. Microarray analysis comparing the attachment sites of the pin bones with a reference muscle sample showed limited differences in salmon. In cod, on the other hand, the variances were substantial, and the gene expression profiles suggested difference in myofibre structure, metabolism and cell processes between the <b>pin</b> bone <b>attachment</b> site and the reference muscle. Degradation of the connective tissue occurs closest to the pin bones and not in the neighbouring tissue, which was shown using light microscopy. This study shows that the <b>attachment</b> of the <b>pin</b> bones in cod and salmon is different; therefore, the development of methods for removal should be tailored to each individual species...|$|R
50|$|In 1966, the US Air Force {{developed}} an Astronaut Maneuvering Unit (AMU), a self-contained rocket pack {{very similar to}} the MMU. This was planned to be tested during Project Gemini on an EVA by Eugene Cernan on Gemini 9A on June 5, 1966. However, the test had to be cancelled because Cernan, tired and overheated, sweated so profusely that his helmet visor fogged before he could get to the AMU mounted {{on the back of the}} spacecraft. Astronauts did not learn how to work during EVA without tiring until the final Gemini 12 mission, but no AMU was carried on that flight. Since there was no real need for self-contained astronaut EVA flight in the Apollo and Skylab programs, the idea had to wait for the advent of the Space Shuttle program, though several maneuvering device designs were tested inside Skylab.The MMU was used on three Shuttle missions in 1984. It was first tested on February 7 during mission STS-41-B by astronauts Bruce McCandless II and Robert L. Stewart. Two months later during mission STS-41-C, astronauts James van Hoften and George Nelson attempted to use the MMU to capture the Solar Maximum Mission satellite and to bring it into the orbiter's payload bay for repairs and servicing. The plan was to use an astronaut-piloted MMU to grapple the SMM with the Trunion <b>Pin</b> <b>Attachment</b> Device (TPAD) mounted between the hand controllers of the MMU, null its rotation rates, and allow the Shuttle to bring it into the Shuttle's payload bay for stowage. Three attempts to grapple the satellite using the TPAD failed. The TPAD jaws could not lock onto Solar Max because of an obstructing grommet on the satellite not included in the blueprints for the satellite. This led to an improvised plan which nearly ended the satellite's mission. The improvisation had the MMU astronaut use his hands to grab hold of an SMM solar array and null the rates by a push from MMU's thrusters. Instead, this attempt induced higher rates and in multiple axes; the satellite was tumbling out of control and quickly losing battery life. SMM Operations Control Center engineers shut down all non-essential SMM subsystems and with a bit of luck were able to recover the SMM minutes before total failure. The ground support engineers then stabilized the satellite and nulled its rotation rates for capture with the orbiter's robotic arm, the Shuttle Remote Manipulator System (SRMS). This proved to be a much better plan. Their successful work increased the lifespan of the satellite.|$|R
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) In the {{processing}} of ores, flotation is widely used for the separation of valuable mineral from the mixture of waste materials (gangue) and desired mineral. It {{is necessary for the}} force of attachment between the bubble and the particle to be sufficient to withstand to gravitational and hydrodynamic effects in the flotation cell. The magnitude of the capillary force depends upon the contact angle, the size, and shape of particle, and the surface tension of the gas-liquid interface. Early work in this field focused primarily on theoretical models for the prediction of the capillary force of attachment between a bubble and a spherical particle. In flotation however, the particles are rarely of spherical shape, having resulted from size reduction operation, which produce particles of arbitrary shape and surface composition. A characteristic of crushed ores is the formation of sharp-edged particles, which have cracked along grain boundaries, often forming regular crystalline shapes. Analysis of the literature showed that existing solution methodology cannot be used to find the equilibrium shape of the gas-liquid interface attached to an irregular particle, whenever the interface is pinned at a corner or sharp edge. This thesis describes a study in which the aim is to develop an improved solution methodology for the calculation of the capillary force of attachment between a bubble and a solid particle of arbitrary shape and surface composition. Computational modelling is of interest since it may help in investigating the behaviour of the rough composite particle on the bubble surface. In development of the modelling methods, chemically homogenous particles with sharp edges were firstly considered. A finite element method was used to solve the Young-Laplace (Y-L) equation for particles of polyhedral shape, in the absence of contact line pinning. The simulation shows that unless the contact angle is 90 degrees, the contact line is curved, leading to increases in the perimeter. However, when the contact line becomes pinned to an edge or a corner, {{it is not possible to}} provide the boundary conditions in the form required for the solution of the Young-Laplace equation. The angle of contact has different values at different points of the three-phase contact (TPC) line, and these angles are unknown. For the first time, the sequence of events when a cubical particle is detached from an interface has been observed experimentally. As the particle moves away from the interface, the contact line first detaches from the corners while remaining pinned to sharp edges. At the edges, the angle of contact is different to the contact angle. After the contact line detaches from the corner (or an edge), the angle of contact equals the advancing contact angle. Detachment at a corner or an edge takes place within the limits of the Gibbs inequality. As the particle moves further from the plane of the gas-liquid interface at infinity, the contact line contracts until it is pinned only at the centres of the edges of the cubical object. When the line finally detaches from the remaining pinning points, it rapidly collapses inward in the form of a circle, and detaches completely from the interface. To find the shape of the gas-liquid interface and the force of <b>attachment</b> when <b>pinning</b> occurs, an energy minimisation method was used. The method has been implemented in the Surface Evolver software of Ken Brakke. The predictions were compared with the results from the experiments in which the force of attraction on a glass slide partially immersed in a gas-liquid interface was measured. Excellent agreement was found. The simulation method was then applied to a number of situations to be found in mineral flotation, including the force on regular shapes such as cubes, as well as composites where cubic or cylindrical particles of a hydrophobic mineral are embedded in a hydrophilic matrix. In this study, a new solution methodology is developed for modelling the influence of sharp edges and corners on the equilibrium shape of the gas-liquid interface near a particle. Accurate prediction of the capillary force of attachment by this model is demonstrated by comparison to the experimental results. The method developed in this study is very effective and can be used for a particle of arbitrary shape for the given physical parameters such as surface tension of liquid, the size, and shape of particle and contact angle. Theoretical and experimental investigations revealed that the angle of contact increases at sharp edges, which also results in an increased capillary force. Thus for a given displacement with respect to the gas-liquid interface at infinity, the force of attachment is greater with pinned contact lines. The same methodology was extended to compute the capillary force between a bubble and a composite particle. It is generally seen that valuable mineral is distributed in patches over the surface of such particles. The availability of hydrophobic patches as well as their distribution over the surface of a composite particle is of importance in the attachment of a particle with a bubble. A code was developed to investigate the effect of the fractional surface liberation and the distribution of hydrophobic patches on the capillary attachment force. Results show that the distribution of valuable mineral increases the attachment force. A theoretical study was conducted in which a spherical particle was placed in the interface, in which the sphere was composed of two continuous parts, one hydrophilic and the other hydrophobic. The effect of the orientation of the sphere on the attachment force was investigated. The governing equations are solved including the pinning of the contact line at an edge of the hydrophobic patch. The predicted results show that the orientation of composite particle plays an important role in determining the stability of the particle at the interface...|$|R
