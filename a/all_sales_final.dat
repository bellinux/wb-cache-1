2500|$|India's {{retail and}} {{logistics}} industry, organised and unorganised in combination, employs about 40 million Indians (3.3% of Indian population). The typical Indian retail shops are very small. Over 14 million outlets {{operate in the}} country and only 4% of them being larger than [...] in size. India has about 11 shop outlets for every 1000 people. Vast majority of the unorganised retail shops in India employ family members, do not have the scale to procure or transport products at high volume wholesale level, have limited to no quality control or fake-versus-authentic product screening technology and have no training on safe and hygienic storage, packaging or logistics. The unorganised retail shops source their products from a chain of middlemen who mark up the product as it moves from farmer or producer to the consumer. The unorganised retail shops typically offer no after-sales support or service. Finally, most transactions at unorganised retail shops are done with cash, with <b>all</b> <b>sales</b> being <b>final.</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{treatment}} of charities under value added taxes (VATs) and retail sales taxes (RSTs) from both a normative and descriptive perspective. There is general agreement that an ideal VAT and an ideal RST would tax supplies or sales {{in the same way}} by imposing a uniform levy on <b>all</b> <b>sales</b> to <b>final</b> consumers and relieving businesses of any economic burden from the tax, except the burden of tax collection. Although it may appear desirable to relieve charities’ purchases or sales of a VAT or RST burden to encourage charitable undertakings, attempting to support charities through modification of the VAT or RST creates a number of problems. These include undermining economic neutrality, by distorting input choices, incentivizing self-supply, and frustrating the destination principle; producing negative revenue consequences; fostering “exemption” or “rate reduction” creep; and adding to the complexity of tax administration. Because of these concerns, “best practices” for charities under a VAT or an RST counsel against special treatment within the tax regime itself and favor support of charities through direct government subsidies. In practice, however, most VAT and RST regimes do seek to provide relief for charities within the tax regime. Most VAT regimes treat charities as exempt, imposing no tax on their sales but taxing their purchases without credit or refund for taxes paid. Under the American subnational RST, over half the states with RSTs relieve charities of the burden of paying sales tax and roughly one third exempt charities’ sales from taxation, although many charities’ sales fall outside the scope of the American RST, which generally does not apply to services. As a consequence, VATs and RSTs often give rise to the problems identified above. ...|$|R

40|$|When Cal Pacific was {{established}} it was imperative {{to establish a}} diverse customer base. This study proved through empirical evidence that Cal Pacific 2 ̆ 7 s establishment {{of a new and}} diverse customer base, after being founded, {{paved the way for the}} vast success of the company in past years. The sales reports, balance sheets, income statements, and depth interview responses exemplify the correlation of Cal Pacific 2 ̆ 7 s success to its customer base. As a result of the Company having many customers, sales increases were recorded and exemplified in the sales reports. Sales increases occurred over multiple one year periods. Overall firm value has been vastly expanded since the Company 2 ̆ 7 s establishment, and the analysis presented in this study highlighted how customer satisfaction will undoubtedly lead to repeat business and increased volume in terms of orders; as long as order specifications and requirements are met by Cal Pacific. Hypothesis two did not test true as a result of the calculations. The covariance of <b>all</b> <b>sales</b> in 2009 was greater than the covariance of <b>all</b> <b>sales</b> in 2004.
