2500|$|The show's other {{prominent}} pairing, Nathan and Haley, {{emerged as a}} supercouple. James Lafferty, Nathan's portrayer, said, [...] "I think Nathan and Haley... Well Schwahn always says that he had that sort of as an 'ace in the hole' the entire time. As he was writing the pilot script, he was planning on doing that, he really didn't know how it would pan out or what would happen. But, the fans have responded so passionately towards it, and I'm not really sure why." [...] However, Lafferty has said {{that there is a}} genuine relationship between Nathan and Haley: [...] "It started as something sort of based on betrayal and deceit. It then kind of transgressed over into something based on actual true love. So, I think that it's a transition that the fans really bought into, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> really enjoy to watch." [...] Schwahn called the couple [...] "gold" [...] and said, [...] "I love Nathan and Haley, and most of our audience does as well." [...] He explained that Nathan and Haley's fan base is strong because they have always been the most stable couple on the show, admitting that it confuses him when people ask when he is going to let them be happy. [...] "They have a lot of obstacles come their way," [...] said Schwahn, [...] "but I see them growing– especially with the jump [...] ahead and aging them a little bit– I see them growing into some really great places, not only as individuals, but as a family." ...|$|E

5000|$|At Ole Miss, Orgeron {{recorded}} {{only two}} wins against teams with winning records (the 2005 and 2007 Memphis teams, which both finished at 7-5)—the fewest among active SEC coaches at the time.

In a November 2006 article in The Clarion-Ledger, Khayat said of Orgeron and the poor win/loss record since he was hired (7-14, {{at the time of}} the interview), [...] "I think Coach Orgeron inherited a very difficult situation....I am 100 percent behind him, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> ought to understand that he has a big challenge." ...|$|E
5000|$|On Tuesday, June 13, 1939, Ilustrowany Kurier Codzienny {{published}} {{a list of}} volunteers, adding that new names were added to it on daily basis. In several previous issues of the paper, other lists were published, with hundreds of names altogether.

Bolesław Sobczyk from Gdynia wrote: [...] "At any given moment I am willing to give my life for Poland", while J.F. from Trembowla wrote: [...] "I am over 50 years old, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> like me are the best candidates".

40|$|The idea to use pet health {{insurance}} {{as the subject}} of my thesis came to me {{through a combination of}} my major in insurance and my dog Guen. I was watching her play one day when {{it occurred to me that}} if she were ever in an accident or in need of some type of emergency veterinary care, I would be unable to cover that expense. My next thought was that I wished I could get {{health insurance}} for her. The more I considered this idea, the better it sounded to me. It sounded so good in fact, that I began t wonder if this type of insurance was not already available and I was just unaware of it. When I began some research in the area and discovered that pet health insurance was available, I began asking other people I knew if they had been aware that this product existed. Most were not. After this I quickly concluded that this topic would be a good one for my thesis. It is one that relates to my area of study, many are unaware of its existence, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>people,</b> and their pets, could benefit from knowing more about it.
