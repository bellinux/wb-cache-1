500|$|A socialist {{from his}} {{undergraduate}} days, Childe was an atheist and critic of religion, viewing it as a false consciousness based in superstition. In History (1947) he commented that [...] "Magic {{is a way}} of making people believe they <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> what they want, whereas religion is a system for persuading them that they ought to want what they get." [...] Archaeologist Colin Renfrew noted that Childe was liberal minded on social issues, but thought that although Childe deplored racism, he did not entirely escape the pervasive 19th century view on distinct differences between different races.|$|E

500|$|... "Behind Blue Eyes" [...] {{featured}} three-part harmony by Daltrey, Townshend and Entwistle and {{was written}} for the main antagonist in Lifehouse, Brick. Moon, uncharacteristically, did not appear on {{the first half of}} the track, which was later described by Who biographer Dave Marsh as [...] "the longest time Keith Moon was still in his entire life." [...] The closing track, [...] "Won't Get Fooled Again", was critical of revolutions. Townshend explained, [...] "a revolution is only a revolution in the long run and a lot of people <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> hurt". The song features the Lowrey organ fed through an ARP synthesizer, which came from Townshend's original demo and was re-used for the finished track.|$|E

President Clinton spoke to the nation three days after the bombing, saying: [...] "I don't want our children to believe something terrible about life and the future and grownups in general because of this awful thing... most adults are good people who want to protect our children in their childhood and we <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> through this".

500|$|With Internationalist, Powderfinger {{first set}} their sights overseas, {{appearing}} at numerous music festivals in the U.S., including South by Southwest in Texas. While in the U.S., Powderfinger played several showcase performances to record-label representatives in Los Angeles and New York City. In a later interview in Australia, Fanning said these shows were difficult {{due to the}} lack of any homegrown fan support. [...] He also said the band were not focused at the shows, and thus they did not go as well as he had hoped. Coghill, however, described the showcases, and the performances in Austin, as [...] "worthwhile" [...] and [...] "fun". After performing in the United States, Powderfinger completed a tour of Canada. Fanning described the band's overseas outlook as a necessity for an Australian-based band, as [...] "people [...] <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> sick of you pretty quickly if you're going to do five tours a year, so that you can sustain yourself financially." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2010, Jacqui {{embarked}} on a [...] "surprise" [...] relationship with Rhys Ashworth (Andrew Moss). Moss first hinted at their romance months prior stating: [...] "I think Rhys is going {{to fall in love}} again. It's a character already in the village. It's quite surprising. It's a character who's been here for a while." [...] The relationship proved popular with viewers; during an interview with Digital Spy, Cooper spoke of her original lack of optimism towards the pairing, stating: [...] "When the relationship first started, we didn't know how they were going to gel and how it was going to work, because people were such fans of Jacqui and Tony. Some people still ask me if those two <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> back together, but people are really taken with Rhys and Jacqui." [...] Cooper believes it's her own working relationship with Moss that helps make the pairing a success stating: [...] "It's a nice collaboration and we try to make it funny, emotional, hard-hitting, three-dimensional and as interesting for the audience as possible." [...] She also adopted a [...] "couple name" [...] for the pair titled [...] "Ja-Rhys".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Brian Lowry of Variety said: [...] "Despite a pedigree that includes Arrested Development creator Mitch Hurwitz {{and many of}} that program's stars, Sit Down seldom rises above sniggering double entendre." [...] Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club graded the episode B, saying: [...] "I'm staying optimistic that the characters <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> fleshed out in upcoming episodes, because this is obviously {{going to be a}} character-based ensemble comedy." [...] Jonah Krakow of IGN was more positive about the episode, noting the [...] "familiar aspects" [...] of [...] Arrested Development, such as the [...] "deft wordplay, biting sarcasm and inappropriate humor". He concluded, saying: [...] "As long as the talented cast can continue to play to their strengths and the scripts can humorously tackle dicey subject matter, this should continue to be a very entertaining show." [...] Kona Gallagher [...] of TV Squad watched the episode twice, and said that it [...] "definitely grows on you." [...] She concluded, saying: [...] "In all, I think the first time you watch Sit Down, Shut Up, it's really easy to blow it off as another animated show that's trying too hard. However, it's actually worth sticking around and watching a couple of episodes." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the late}} {{afternoon}} of 7 November 1976, three insurgents {{from a group of}} seven were spotted by an Army observation post in the Mutema Tribal Trust Lands, just south-west of Birchenough Bridge in Manicaland province. Fireforce was called up and the Rhodesians readied themselves to fly out by helicopter and engage the guerrillas. There were eight four-man [...] "stops" [...] involved in a Fireforce, and on this occasion Lamb headed Stop 2. Just before they left, Lamb ran over to Lance-Corporal Phil Kaye, the leader of Stop 3, and shouted over the noise of the aircraft. [...] "They <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> me this time," [...] he yelled, sardonically; [...] "Just you watch, Phil Kaye!" [...] Kaye and his MAG gunner, Trooper Pat Grogan, waved away this comment and told Lamb to get moving. [...] "Go nail gooks!" [...] Kaye called after Lamb as he and the rest of Stop 2 took off aboard their Alouette III gunship. Lamb's men were an 18-year-old national service MAG gunner of Portuguese-Rhodesian extraction named Trooper Soares; Trooper Cornelius Olivier, a 20-year-old Rhodesian regular who carried an FN FAL battle rifle; and Trooper Tony Rok, an Australian Vietnam veteran, aged 28 and also equipped with an FN. Lamb carried the stick's radio on his back with his FN FAL ready in his hands.|$|E
500|$|... 1UP.com graded it A-, {{praising the}} {{gameplay}} and [...] "predictably slick" [...] looks, but criticized the [...] "divisive industrial hard-rock nonsense.... that sullied DMC3 [...] returns here" [...] and the game's [...] "overly frugal approach to level design". GameTrailers rated it an 8.6/10, and praised the voice acting while criticizing the corny dialogue. IGN gave it an 8.7 saying, [...] "Whether it's on the PS3 or the 360, action fans <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> one incredible {{experience with this}} game, and if you own either system, you'll have a great time." [...] However, the review also noted that, contrary to Kobayashi's claim, [...] "Dante simply doesn't have nearly as many weapons {{as he did in}} DMC3" [...] and found that [...] "the amount of backtracking and repetition makes the game feel somewhat half-heartedly finished in the design department." [...] GameSpy gave it 4 stars out of 5, stating that [...] "DMC4 succeeds on many levels because it fuses fan service with entertaining gameplay", finding that [...] "visually, DMC4 is a dynamo." [...] The review also praised Nero for [...] " [...] something fresh to the franchise" [...] and being [...] "as diverse as DMC3 SE's Vergil"; however, they also claim that [...] "it cheapens things a little to see that the team has opted to recycle assets in lieu of showing us more of this rich world" [...] and call out the [...] "annoying industrial-meets-butt-rock soundtrack". Hypers Dirk Watch commends the game for [...] "looking great, combos galore and being more fun than Devil May Cry 3". However, he criticized it for [...] "still playing like Devil May Cry 2 as well as choppy pacing and level design".|$|E

2500|$|During the South Carolina Democratic Debate in Myrtle Beach, Edwards {{sought to}} {{distinguish}} himself from Senators Obama and Clinton, and criticized {{them for their}} attacks and [...] "big city" [...] politics. As soon {{as he began to}} question how the attacks helped, he was widely cheered by the audience for in what many people thought was what distinguished Edwards from negative campaigning. Saying [...] "This kind of squabbling, how many children <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> healthcare? How many people <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> an education from this?
