5|$|The câmara {{municipal}} (town council) was {{the governing}} body in {{towns and cities}} and had existed in Brazil {{since the beginning of}} the colonial period in the 16th century. The Chamber was composed of vereadores (councilmen), the number of which depended on the size of the town. Unlike the Provincial General Council, the Constitution gave town councils great autonomy. However, when the Provincial Assembly replaced the Provincial General Council in 1834, many of the powers of town councils (including the setting of municipal budgets, oversight of expenditures, creation of jobs, and the nomination of civil servants) were transferred to the provincial government. Additionally, any laws enacted by the town council had to be ratified by the Provincial Assembly—but not by Parliament. While the 1834 Additional Act granted greater <b>autonomy</b> <b>to</b> the provinces from the central government, it transferred the towns' remaining <b>autonomy</b> <b>to</b> the provincial governments. There was no office of mayor, and towns were governed by a town council and its president (who was the councilman who won the most votes during elections).|$|E
5|$|After World War II, Croatia {{became a}} one-party Socialist federal {{unit of the}} Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Croatia was ruled by the Communists and enjoyed a degree of {{autonomy}} within the Yugoslav federation. In 1967, a group of Croatian authors and linguists published the Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Literary Language, demanding greater autonomy for the Croatian language. The declaration contributed to a national movement seeking greater civil rights and decentralization of the Yugoslav economy, culminating in the Croatian Spring of 1971, which was suppressed by Yugoslav leadership. The 1974 Yugoslav Constitution gave increased <b>autonomy</b> <b>to</b> federal units, essentially fulfilling a goal of the Croatian Spring and providing a legal basis for independence of the federative constituents.|$|E

Measurement used <b>to</b> measure <b>autonomy</b> level <b>to</b> fulfill local fiscal’s need by {{this research}} is proportion between PAD and DAU. While in terms of <b>autonomy</b> level <b>to</b> manage local potency, the measurement used is proportion between PAD and DBH. SiLPA in this research has no measurement since it is directly obtained from penerimaan pembiayaan. Whereas performance level of local public service as a dependent variable is measured by using proportion of capital expenditure and local expenditure. This research uses secondary data with population of all local governments in Indonesia which report its realizations of APBD in DJPK since 2006 until 2012. Purposive sampling is a method used {{in order to determine}} research’s sample. Whereas multiple regression is used as an analysis method. The result shows that <b>autonomy</b> level <b>to</b> fulfill local fiscal’s need (TKMKF) and <b>autonomy</b> level <b>to</b> manage local potency negatively (TKMP) affect performance level of local public service (TKPP) and the SiLPA positively affect performance level of public service (TKPP) ...|$|R

5|$|Since the 1970s, Yugoslavia's Communist regime became {{severely}} splintered into a liberal-decentralist nationalist faction led by Croatia and Slovenia {{that supported}} a decentralized federation to give greater <b>autonomy</b> <b>to</b> Croatia and Slovenia, versus a conservative-centralist nationalist faction led by Serbia that supported a centralized federation to secure Serbia's and Serbs' interests across Yugoslavia – {{as they were}} the largest ethnic group in {{the country as a}} whole. From 1967 to 1972 in Croatia and 1968 and 1981 protests in Kosovo, nationalist doctrines and actions caused ethnic tensions that destabilized Yugoslavia. The suppression by the state of nationalists is believed to have had the effect of identifying nationalism as the primary alternative to communism itself and made it a strong underground movement.|$|E
5|$|The ACLU {{played a}} major role in passing the 1932 Norris–La Guardia Act, a federal law which {{prohibited}} employers from preventing employees from joining unions, and stopped the practice of outlawing strikes, unions, and labor organizing activities with the use of injunctions. The ACLU also played a key role in initiating a nationwide effort to reduce misconduct (such as extracting false confessions) within police departments, by publishing the report Lawlessness in Law Enforcement in 1931, under the auspices of Herbert Hoover's Wickersham Commission. In 1934, the ACLU lobbied for the passage of the Indian Reorganization Act, which restored some <b>autonomy</b> <b>to</b> Native American tribes, and established penalties for kidnapping Native American children.|$|E

The government of Soviet Georgia created an autonomous administrative unit for Transcaucasian Ossetians in April 1922, called the South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast. Historians such as Stephen F.

5|$|Those {{parts of}} the {{memorandum}} that demanded Lithuanian autonomy and protested the possible attachment of Suwałki Governorate to autonomous Poland were reprinted in the Russian publication Pravitel'stvennyi Vestnik on November 23 (November 10 O.S.). The Russian government sought to demonstrate that granting <b>autonomy</b> <b>to</b> both Poland and Lithuania would be complicated, and would probably exacerbate national conflicts. On November 26 (November 13 O.S.) the memorandum was also reprinted in Vilniaus žinios. It was heavily criticized by non-Lithuanians for its position on minorities and by Lithuanians for making demands {{on behalf of the}} Lithuanian nation without waiting for the Seimas' resolutions.|$|E

On 21 December 2009, a pair of U.S. Apaches attacked a British-held base in a friendly fire incident, killing one British soldier. In 2006, Thomas Adams noted that Apaches often fought in small teams with little <b>autonomy</b> <b>to</b> react to threats and opportunities, requiring lengthy dialogue with command structures in an effort to centrally micromanage each unit.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to examine the concept of {{adolescent}} auton-omy. A conceptual analysis of different theoretical perspectives has resulted in an integrative model of attitudinal, emotional, and functional autonomy. Attitudinal <b>autonomy</b> refers <b>to</b> the cognitive process of choosing and defining a goal. Emo-tional <b>autonomy</b> refers <b>to</b> the affective process of feeling confident about one’s own choices and goals. Functional <b>autonomy</b> refers <b>to</b> the regulatory process of developing a strategy to achieve these goals. The empirical value of this model was tested by developing a questionnaire assessing adolescent autonomy. Subjects were 400 adolescents between 12 and 18 years old. Confirmatory factor analyses (LISREL 8) provided evidence for the 3 hypothesized dimensions...|$|R
5|$|Notably, {{during the}} 1960s, the Soviet General Secretary Nikita Khrushchev asked the {{communist}} leader of Albania Enver Hoxha about giving <b>autonomy</b> <b>to</b> the minority, but this initiative was without any result. The autonomy question {{remains one of}} the main issues on the diplomatic agenda in Albanian-Greek relations, {{after the collapse of the}} communist regime in Albania (1991). Moreover, a certain degree of autonomy, based on the terms of the Protocol of Corfu, is the main objective of the organization Omonoia, as well as the Unity for Human Rights Party, which represents the Greek minority in the Albanian government. Such proposals were rejected in 1991 by the Albanian government, thus spurring Omonoia's radical wing to call for Union with Greece. In another incident, in 1993, Omonoia’s chairman was immediately arrested by the Albanian police, after explaining in public that the goal of the Greek minority was autonomy inside the Albanian borders, based on the terms of the Protocol.|$|E
5|$|Some of the kingdoms paying {{tribute to}} the Tang dynasty {{included}} Kashmir, Nepal, Khotan, Kucha, Kashgar, Korea, Champa, and kingdoms located in Amu Darya and Syr Darya valley. Turkic nomads addressed the Emperor of Tang China as Tian Kehan. After the widespread Göktürk revolt of Shabolüe Khan (d. 658) was put down at Issyk Kul in 657 by Su Dingfang (591–667), Emperor Gaozong established several protectorates governed by a Protectorate General or Grand Protectorate General, which extended the Chinese sphere of influence as far as Herat in Western Afghanistan. Protectorate Generals were given {{a great deal of}} <b>autonomy</b> <b>to</b> handle local crises without waiting for central admission. After Xuanzong's reign, military governors (jiedushi) were given enormous power, including the ability to maintain their own armies, collect taxes, and pass their titles on hereditarily. This is commonly recognized as the beginning of the fall of Tang's central government.|$|E
5|$|The {{autonomy}} {{question remains}} on the diplomatic agenda in Albanian-Greek relations {{as part of the}} Northern Epirote issue. In 1925, Albania's borders were fixed by the Protocol of Florence, and the Kingdom of Greece abandoned all claims to Northern Epirus. In the 1960s, Soviet General Secretary Nikita Khrushchev asked his Albanian counterpart about giving <b>autonomy</b> <b>to</b> the Greek minority, with no results. In 1991, {{after the collapse of the}} communist regime in Albania, the chairman of Greek minority organization Omonoia called for autonomy for Northern Epirus, on the basis that the rights provided for under the Albanian constitution were highly precarious. This proposal was rejected, spurring the minority's radical wing to call for a union with Greece. Two years later, Omonoia’s chairman was arrested by the Albanian police after publicly stating that the Greek minority goal was the creation of an autonomous region inside the Albanian borders, based on the provisions of the Protocol of Corfu. In 1997, Albanian analysts stated that the possibility of a Greek minority-inspired breakaway Republic still exists.|$|E

5|$|The {{creation}} of a new state of Sikkim in 1975, along with the reluctance of the Government of India to recognise Nepali as an official language under the Constitution of India, brought the issue of a separate state of Gorkhaland to the forefront. Agitation for a separate state continued through the 1980s, included violent protests during the 1986–88 period. The agitation ceased only after an agreement {{between the government and the}} Gorkha National Liberation Front (GNLF), resulting in the establishment of an elected body in 1988 called the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council (DGHC), which received <b>autonomy</b> <b>to</b> govern the district. Though Darjeeling became peaceful, the issue of a separate state lingered, fuelled in part by the lack of comprehensive economic development in the region even after the formation of the DGHC. New protests erupted in 2008–09, but both the Union and State governments rejected Gorkha Janmukti Morcha's (GJM) demand for a separate state. In July 2011, a pact was signed between GJM, the Government of West Bengal and the Government of India which includes the formation of a new autonomous, elected Gorkhaland Territorial Administration (GTA), a hill council endowed with more powers than its predecessor Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council.|$|E
