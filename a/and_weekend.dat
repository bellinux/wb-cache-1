40|$|Graduation date: 2007 Generalizability {{theory was}} used to examine sources of {{variability}} in daily physical activity levels of secondary students with and without developmental disabilities (DD), and to determine minimum number of days required for monitoring their typical physical activity levels. Sixteen participants with DD (M = 16. 7 years, SD = 2. 7 years), and thirty-one (M = 12. 3 years, SD = 0. 5 years) children without DD participated in the study. They wore two pedometers and two accelerometers during 5 weekdays <b>and</b> 4 <b>weekend</b> days. Sources of variability were examined using a two-facet fully crossed design. Twelve separate two-way ANOVAs were employed for each population, physical activity device, and measurement periods (weekday, <b>weekends,</b> <b>and</b> weekdays <b>and</b> <b>weekends</b> combined). For participants with DD, variance components of the person, and the person by day interaction were the primary sources of variability in daily physical activity for pedometers and accelerometers across weekdays, <b>weekend</b> days, <b>and</b> weekdays <b>and</b> <b>weekends</b> combined. To determine the typical physical activity level with generalizability coefficients of. 80, at least 4, 6, and 8 days of measurement using a pedometer were required during weekdays, <b>weekend</b> days, <b>and</b> weekdays <b>and</b> <b>weekends</b> combined, respectively. Using an accelerometer, at least 4 days of measurements were needed across weekdays, <b>weekends,</b> <b>and</b> weekdays <b>and</b> <b>weekends</b> combined. For participants without DD, the primary sources of variability during weekdays <b>and</b> <b>weekends</b> were related to variance components of the persons and the person by day interaction for both pedometers and accelerometers. When weekdays <b>and</b> <b>weekends</b> were combined, relatively large percentages of variability were associated with the residual, indicating three way interaction, plus unexplained error. Using one pedometer, to achieve generalizability coefficients of. 80 in the measurement of daily physical activity, a minimum number of 5 and 9 days of measurements during weekday <b>and</b> <b>weekends</b> were estimated, respectively. Using one accelerometer, at least 4 days and 14 days of monitoring physical activity were required during weekdays, <b>and</b> weekdays <b>and</b> <b>weekends</b> combined, respectively. However, an estimation of typical physical activity levels during weekdays <b>and</b> <b>weekends</b> combined, using one pedometer as well as during weekends using one accelerometer was unfeasible due to the number of days required for measurement...|$|R
5|$|A 1,000-car {{above-ground}} parking garage, {{owned by}} the state, is located south of the stadium's center field entrance on Harrison Street between Fourth and Fifth Avenues. As the garage is used by state employees during the day, game attendees are only {{able to use it}} for evening <b>and</b> <b>weekend</b> games. Other state-owned free parking lots and paid private lots are located in the vicinity. The Metro Transit Authority's Music City Circuit provides bus service to and from a drop-off site at Fifth Avenue North and Harrison Street. Nashville BCycle, the city's bike-share program, has a station at First Tennessee Park.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, BART stated its {{intention}} to improve non-peak (night <b>and</b> <b>weekend)</b> headways for each line to 15 minutes. The current 20-minute headways at these times is a barrier to ridership. In mid-2007, BART temporarily reversed its position stating that the shortened wait times would likely not happen due to a $900,000 state revenue budget shortfall. Nevertheless, BART eventually confirmed {{the implementation of the}} plan by January 2008. Continued budgetary problems halted the expanded non-peak service and returned off-peak headways to 20 minutes in 2009.|$|E
5|$|On July 11, 2016, the MassDOT Board {{approved}} {{spending an}} additional $19 million {{to finish the}} station {{by the end of}} September, bringing the total cost of the extension to $93.3 million. The additional cost included replacement for several Pan Am Southern-owned bridges which were in poorer shape than originally thought, and night <b>and</b> <b>weekend</b> work to speed completion. Service to the station had to begin by September 30, or the state risked a revocation of the $59.2 million in federal funds. Limited service began on September 30, 2016, with two weekday round trips; full service began with the schedule change on November 21, 2016.|$|E

The Metro connects UM to {{downtown}} Miami, Brickell, Coconut Grove, Civic Center, and other Miami neighborhoods. The UM campus is about a 15-minute train ride from Downtown and Brickell. The Hurry 'Canes shuttle bus service operates two routes on campus (as {{well as to the}} University Station) <b>and</b> <b>weekend</b> routes to various off-campus stores and facilities during the school year; an additional shuttle route provides service to the RSMAS campus on Virginia Key and Vizcaya Station. Miami also has a Zipcar service. There is also a lake called Lake Osceola located at the center of campus. It contains a large fountain, which serves as a landmark to many university students.|$|E
5|$|The Dime Store was a {{short-lived}} restaurant in Portland, Oregon, in the United States. It {{was established by}} Dayna McErlean, with additional conceptual development from Jeremy Larter.

5|$|Metrorail begins {{service at}} 5 am Monday through Friday, 7 am on Saturdays, and 8 am Sundays; it ends service at 11:30 pm Monday through Thursday, 1:00 am Friday and Saturday, and 11:00 pm on Sundays, {{although}} the last trains leave the end stations inbound {{about half an}} hour before these times. Trains run more frequently during rush hours on all lines, with scheduled peak hour headways of 4 minutes on the Red Line and 9 minutes on all other lines. Headways are much longer during midday and evening on weekdays and all weekend. The midday six-minute headways are based on a combination of two Metrorail lines (Orange/Blue and Yellow/Green) as each route can run every 12 minutes; {{in the case of the}} Red Line, every other train bound for Glenmont terminates at Silver Spring instead. Night <b>and</b> <b>weekend</b> service varies between 8 and 24 minutes, with trains generally scheduled only every 20 minutes.|$|E
5|$|The Sognsvann Line {{is served}} by lines 4 and 5 of the Oslo Metro. Half of line 5 trains operate {{the full length of}} the Sognsvann Line, while line 4 and {{the other half of the}} line 5 trains branch off after Ullevål stadion and serve the Ring Line. All {{services}} operate with a fifteen-minute headway, except during late evenings <b>and</b> <b>weekend</b> mornings. This gives the stations Blindern, Forskningsparken and Ullevål stadion an average five-minute headway to the city center and all stations in the Common Tunnel, and an average ten-minute headway to Nydalen and Storo. On the east side of the city, Line 5 connects with the Ring Line, and makes a full loop before it leaves Oslo on the Grorud Line. Line 4 connects with the Lambertseter Line. Travel time from Stortinget to Sognsvann is 18 minutes. The Oslo Metro is operated by Oslo T-banedrift on contract with Ruter.|$|E

5|$|The group {{became a}} {{professional}} band in 1972, adding drummer Bennett Vartanian and changing their name to Wildcountry. During this time, the group accepted a position {{playing at the}} nearby Canyonland theme park. The park would bring in established stars, such as Jerry Wallace, Bobby Bare, and Narvel Felts, and the band would back them, afterwards performing a one-hour dance set. After a while, with opportunities for the band slimmed, a discouraged Cook took a government job in Anniston, Alabama. Owen was studying English at Jacksonville State University, and Cook had an electronics job. The trio shared at $56-a-month apartment in Anniston, working to keep the band afloat with night <b>and</b> <b>weekend</b> gigs. The group decided to become professional musicians in 1973, and began performing at bars throughout the Southeast. In March, the band relocated to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, performing six nights {{a week at a}} club named The Bowery for tips. They made their best money performing cover songs of Lynyrd Skynyrd and Merle Haggard. The group could not secure a record contract and began to self-finance recordings. The group borrowed $4,000 from a Fort Payne bank to record and release their own albums to sell at shows. Vartanian dropped out of the group, and following a rotation of four more drummers, they settled on Rick Scott in 1974.|$|E
