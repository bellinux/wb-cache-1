60|$|But Olive put her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> coaxed him for her sake to let {{the matter}} rest. And, finally, the captain, grumblingly, assented.|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{seems to}} be {{considerable}} hoist in it," [...] he said, directly. And then I put my <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> found that I could raise him from the ground.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, you dear ninny!" [...] Dora cried, {{throwing}} her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> hugging him. [...] "Then you saw it, too! I thought something was the matter, you were acting so strangely." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{held on to}} the bar, {{his legs}} {{wobbling}} under <b>him,</b> Martin's <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> supporting <b>him,</b> while he thought.|$|R
60|$|Feverish and excited, {{he tried}} {{in vain to}} sleep again; and after an hour's tossing, rose and dressed, and started for a bathe on his beloved old pebble ridge. As he passed his mother's door, he could not help looking in. The dim light of morning showed him the bed; but its pillow had not been pressed that night. His mother, in her long white night-dress, was {{kneeling}} {{at the other end of}} the chamber at her prie-dieu, absorbed in devotion. Gently he slipped in without a word, and knelt down at her side. She turned, smiled, passed her <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> went on silently with her prayers. Why not? They were for <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> he knew it, and prayed also; and his prayers were for her, and for poor lost John Oxenham, and all his vanished crew.|$|R
50|$|The {{season ends}} with Tommy, Lou, Sean, Michael Gavin (Tommy's Dad), and Uncle Teddy {{attending}} a Newark Bears {{minor league baseball}} game {{at the request of}} Tommy's dad. Tommy and his father take the close up seats {{while the rest of the}} crew take seats higher up in the same section. Lou explains to Garrity how Baseball is like life, waiting for something to come and not being awake for it to happen, but having enough time for a beer, a hot dog, and maybe a blowjob here and there. Also, Colleen is seen attending a picnic with Black Shawn. The last shot is of Tommy showing his father a hit, and his dad not responding or waking up. Tommy realizes that his father has died <b>and</b> puts his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> continues to watch the game.|$|R
6000|$|He {{had a fit}} of coughing. Winifred {{passed her}} <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> held him up. [...] "If you stay," [...] she whispered to Hefferom, [...] "you will kill him. He ought not to speak ever a sentence." ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Smithson made {{a strange}} moaning noise, and, {{snatching}} his hat from the table, clapped {{it on his}} head and made for the door. Mr. Clarkson flung his <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> dragged him back by main force.|$|E
60|$|The {{poor woman}} had {{suffered}} too much already to shrink from this last crushing blow. But she walked quietly {{to his side}} without a word or cry, knelt, placed her loving <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> I left them so together.|$|E
50|$|This Scef {{came in a}} {{light boat}} to an island of the ocean which is called Scani, <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> about <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> {{he was a very}} young boy, unknown to the dwellers in the land. But he was {{accepted}} by them and cared for like one of their own kind, and afterwards they chose him as king, from whose family descended King Æthelwulf.|$|R
50|$|The Ogre takes Violet to his cave {{near the}} top of a mountain, where she is raped and kept prisoner. One day while the Ogre is hunting, Violet spots a woman, who is an entertainer, {{on the other side of}} the cliff. She begs the woman for help. The woman tells her she will return {{tomorrow}} with her sons. The next day, the woman and her husband and sons try to save the Princess by tying a rope to the other side of the cliff, with one of the sons walking across it while carrying the Princess on his back. As the entertainers' son is walking across the tightrope, the Ogre notices the Princess's absence and is enraged that the Princess has been taken. However, they manage to cut the rope before the Ogre reaches them, and the Ogre falls to the depths below. However, the Ogre manages to survive, and finds the group, slaying the entertainers' entire family. He is about to kill the Princess, but she placates him with tender gestures. He relents and motions for the Princess to climb onto his back, so he can take her back to the cave. The Princess pretends to get on by placing an <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> slits his throat with her other arm.|$|R
5000|$|I was a Flower of the {{mountain}} yes when I put the rose in my hair like the Andalusian girls used or shall I wear a red yes and how he kissed me under the Moorish Wall and I thought well as well <b>him</b> as another <b>and</b> then I asked him with my eyes to ask again yes and then he asked me would I yes to say yes my mountain flower and first I put my <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him</b> yes <b>and</b> drew <b>him</b> down to me so he could feel my breasts all perfume yes and his heart was going like mad and yes I said yes I will Yes.|$|R
60|$|Old Mr Kennedy {{seemed to}} have lost his powers of speech. He gazed at his son {{for a few seconds}} in silence, then {{suddenly}} threw his <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> engaged in a species of wrestle which he intended for an embrace.|$|E
6000|$|As {{he climbed}} the steep, stony steps {{to the door of}} the Baron's house, old Ursela came running down to meet him. She flung her {{withered}} <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> hugged him close to her. [...] "My little child," [...] she cried, and then fell to sobbing as though her heart would break.|$|E
60|$|He {{reached for}} his hat {{and started for the}} door. He did not offer to kiss her--he never did on going out--but on this night she dared to kiss him, {{throwing}} her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> compelling him to bend down to her face. She looked quite small against the massive bulk of the man.|$|E
5000|$|On October 30, 2011, Trice {{made his}} debut for Michigan State in an {{exhibition}} game against Ferris State University, a Division II school {{in the field of}} basketball. The guard recorded 7 points and 4 rebounds in 18 minutes. After the Spartans topped the Bulldogs with a score of 85-58, coach Tom Izzo commented on his freshmen's play. About Trice, he said, [...] "Today I jumped Travis a little bit. I watched Draymond Green go right over <b>and</b> put his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> talk to him." [...] Trice made his first official appearance with the team on November 11, 2011, in a Carrier Classic showdown vs North Carolina. He was allowed 20 minutes on the court, but 1-of-8 shooting limited him to 4 points throughout the game. He went for 11 points and 5 rebounds off the bench the following week on November 18 against Texas Southern, the most he had scored in a single college basketball game until that point in time. However, on December 7 of the same year, in a home contest vs Central Connecticut, he broke that record, adding 20 points despite not being a starter. Izzo noted, [...] "When you really look at it, Trice looked good...give Travis credit." [...] He would hold the number as his season-high scoring performance. He suffered from an brain infection as a freshman that drained his energy <b>and</b> caused <b>him</b> to sleep 12 hours a day.|$|R
6000|$|And {{a sudden}} resolve {{came into the}} mucker's mind as he whispered those words {{over and over again}} to himself. [...] "I can't have her," [...] he said. [...] "She isn't for the likes of me; but if I can't live with her, I can live for her--as she'd want me to live, and, s'help me, those words'll keep me straight. If she ever hears of Billy Byrne again it won't be {{anything}} to make her ashamed that she had her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him,</b> kissing <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> telling <b>him</b> that she loved him." ...|$|R
60|$|When {{they were}} all gone she bent forward and, smiling sweetly, {{partially}} by signs and partially by exclamations {{made it clear to}} us that she was very anxious to know where we came from. The difficulty was how to explain, but at last an idea struck me. I had my large pocket-book in my pocket and a pencil. Taking it out, I made a little sketch of a lake, and then as best I could I drew the underground river and the lake at the other end. When I had done this I advanced to the steps of the throne and gave it to her. She understood it at once and clapped her hands with delight, and then descending from the throne took it to her sister Sorais, who also evidently understood. Next she took the pencil from me, and after examining it with curiosity proceeded to make a series of delightful little sketches, the first representing herself holding out both hands in welcome, and a man uncommonly like Sir Henry taking them. Next she drew a lovely little picture of a hippopotamus rolling about dying in the water, and of an individual, in whom we had no difficulty in recognizing Agon the High Priest, holding up his hands in horror on the bank. Then followed a most alarming picture of a dreadful fiery furnace and of the same figure, Agon, poking us into it with a forked stick. This picture perfectly horrified me, but I was a little reassured when she nodded sweetly and proceeded to make a fourth drawing -- a man again uncommonly like Sir Henry, and of two women, in whom I recognized Sorais and herself, each with one <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> holding a sword in protection over him. To all of these Sorais, who I saw was employed in carefully taking us all in -- especially Curtis -- signified her approval by nodding.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wetzel, wait, for God's sake, wait!" [...] screamed Nell. She {{had risen}} at Zane's call, and now saw the deadly resolve in the hunter's eyes. Fearlessly she flung herself {{in front of}} him; bravely she risked her life before his mad rush; frantically she threw her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> clung to his hands desperately.|$|E
60|$|It was a {{long time}} before the Countess came to herself, and when she did so, a {{considerable}} change seemed to have taken place in her emotions. She flung her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> with gasps of fear abjectly kissed him many times, at last bursting into tears. She had never wept in this scene before.|$|E
60|$|Clodd whispered it to him, {{together}} with information bringing history up to date. And then light fell upon the old lined face. He came towards Dick, meaning {{to take him}} by both hands, but, perhaps because he had become somewhat feeble, he seemed glad when the younger man put his <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> held him for a moment. It was un-English, {{and both of them}} felt a little ashamed of themselves afterwards.|$|E
60|$|Red-Eye rushed {{upon her}} and seized her. With his gnarly fingers twisted into {{the hair of}} her head, {{he stood up and}} roared in triumph and {{defiance}} at the awed Folk that watched from the trees. Then it was that I went mad. Caution was thrown to the winds; forgotten was the will to live of my flesh. Even as Red-Eye roared, from behind I dashed upon him. So unexpected was my charge that I knocked him off his feet. I twined my <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> legs <b>around</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> strove to hold him down. This would have been impossible to accomplish had he not held tightly with one hand to the Swift One's hair.|$|R
5000|$|The final episode {{consists}} of Molly Bloom's thoughts as she lies in {{bed next to}} her husband. The episode uses a stream-of-consciousness technique in eight sentences and lacks punctuation. Molly thinks about Boylan and Bloom, her past admirers, including Lieutenant Stanley G. Gardner, {{the events of the}} day, her childhood in Gibraltar, and her curtailed singing career. She also hints at a homosexual relationship, in her youth, with a childhood friend named Hester Stanhope. These thoughts are occasionally interrupted by distractions, such as a train whistle or the need to urinate. The episode famously concludes with Molly's remembrance of Bloom's marriage proposal, and of her acceptance: [...] "he asked me would I yes to say yes my mountain flower and first I put my <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him</b> yes <b>and</b> drew <b>him</b> down to me so he could feel my breasts all perfume yes and his heart was going like mad and yes I said yes I will Yes." [...] The episode is also concerned with the occurrence of Molly’s early menstrual period. She considers the proximity of her period following her extra marital affairs with Boylan, and believes her menstrual condition is the reason for her increased sexual appetite.|$|R
500|$|After President Nixon {{told his}} family he would resign {{the office of}} the presidency, she replied, [...] "But why?" [...] She {{contacted}} White House curator Clement Conger to cancel any further development of a new official china pattern from the Lenox China Company, and began supervising the packing of the family's personal belongings. On August 7, 1974, the family met in the solarium of the White House for their last dinner. Pat {{sat on the edge of}} a couch and held her chin high, a sign of tension to her husband. When the president walked in, she threw her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him,</b> kissed <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> said, [...] "We're all very proud of you, Daddy." [...] Later Pat Nixon said of the photographs taken that evening, [...] "Our hearts were breaking and there we are smiling." ...|$|R
60|$|The major sat {{himself by}} her side, {{and put his}} hand upon hers, and whispered some word to her about her daughter. Upon this she threw her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> kissed his face, and then his hands, and then looked up into his face through her tears. She murmured some few words, or {{attempted}} to do so. I doubt whether the major understood their meaning, but he knew very well what was in her heart.|$|E
60|$|The {{police for}} the moment had been swept away. Bill Totts leaped to the {{pavement}} {{and made his way}} to the woman on the sidewalk. Catherine Van Vorst saw her throw her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> kiss him on the lips; and Catherine Van Vorst watched him curiously as he went on down the sidewalk, one arm around the woman, both talking and laughing, and he with a volubility and abandon she could never have dreamed possible.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Stonehouse had no {{eyes but}} for her child, except for one other. When Harold leaped down from the rail she rushed at him, all those around instinctively making way for her. She flung her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> kissed him, and then before he could stop her sank to her knees at his feet, and taking his hand kissed it. Harold was embarrassed beyond all thinking. He tried to take away his hand, but she clung tight to it.|$|E
50|$|Boynton {{helped lead}} Buffalo to a 6-2-0 season, {{with a clear}} shot at the league title. However, the team's title chances ended with a 6-3 loss to the Milwaukee Badgers. During that game Badgers' quarterback Red Dunn broke through the line and headed downfield with Boynton in pursuit. On the Buffalo 10-yard line, Dunn tried to stiff-arm Boynton. Benny grabbed Dunn’s <b>arm,</b> swung <b>him</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> {{wrestled}} <b>him</b> to the ground. As the Buffalo players raced to congratulate Boynton on the tackle, coach Tommy Hughitt lectured Boynton on his tackle technique, stating {{that if he had}} pulled Dunn's arm off, Dunn still could have scored.|$|R
60|$|She {{crossed over}} {{to the back of}} his chair <b>and</b> put her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
60|$|She laughed suddenly, with a wild {{catch in}} her voice, <b>and</b> flung her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
60|$|For {{the first}} time in his life, Endymion felt some {{constraint}} in the presence of Myra. There was something changed in her manner. No diminution of affection, for she threw her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> pressed him to her heart; and then she looked at him anxiously, even sadly, and kissed both his eyes, and then she remained for some moments in silence with her face hid on his shoulder. Never since the loss of Lord Roehampton had she seemed so subdued.|$|E
60|$|Between {{two of the}} {{principal}} chiefs rode a young warrior who had distinguished himself in the battle. He was severely wounded, so as with difficulty to keep on his horse; but he preserved a serene and steadfast countenance, as if perfectly unharmed. His mother had heard of his condition. She broke through the throng, and rushing up, threw her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> wept aloud. He kept up the spirit and demeanor of a warrior to the last, but expired shortly after he had reached his home.|$|E
6000|$|Miles Hendon {{forgot all}} decorum in his delight; and {{surprised}} the King and wounded his dignity, by throwing his <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> hugging him. The woman made her grateful adieux and started {{away with her}} pig; and when the constable {{opened the door for}} her, he followed her out into the narrow hall. The justice proceeded to write in his record book. Hendon, always alert, thought he would like to know why the officer followed the woman out; so he slipped softly into the dusky hall and listened. He heard a conversation to this effect-- ...|$|E
60|$|For a {{few moments}} McMurdo and the girl stood in silence. Then she threw her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
60|$|She {{caught one}} <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>him,</b> as his was around herself; the tremor ran {{from him to}} her; both sat dumb.|$|R
60|$|I {{could not}} help laughing, and he stood {{looking at me with}} such a {{whimsical}} expression that I rose <b>and</b> flung my <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
