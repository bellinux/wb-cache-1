He {{appears to have been a}} descendant or relative of the famous war chief Waubojeeg. When he was about 10, Buffalo and his parents moved from La Pointe to the vicinity of what now is Buffalo, New York, and lived there until about he was about 12. The family relocated to the Mackinac Island area for <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>before</b> returning to La Pointe. In his youth, Kechewaishke was admired as a skilled hunter and athlete.|$|E
5|$|The {{black-throated blue warbler}} forages {{actively}} in low vegetation, sometimes hovering or catching insects in flight. It often forages in one area for <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>before</b> {{moving on to the}} next. It mainly eats invertebrates such as caterpillars, crane flies, and spiders. It may supplement its diet with seeds, berries, and fruit in the winter.|$|E
5|$|The zygote {{develops}} into a planula larva which swims {{by means}} of cilia and forms part of the plankton for <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>before</b> settling on the seabed and metamorphosing into a juvenile polyp. Some planulae contain yolky material and others incorporate zooxanthellae, and these adaptations enable these larvae to sustain themselves and disperse more widely. The planulae of the stony coral Pocillopora damicornis, for example, have lipid-rich yolks and remain viable {{for as long as}} 100days before needing to settle.|$|E

5|$|By 1938, with Amazings {{circulation}} down to only 15,000, Teck Publications {{was having}} financial problems. In January 1938 Ziff-Davis {{took over the}} magazine and shortly thereafter moved production to Chicago; the April issue was assembled by Sloane but published by Ziff-Davis. Bernard Davis, who ran Ziff-Davis's editorial department, attempted to hire Roger Sherman Hoar as editor; Hoar turned down the job but suggested Raymond A. Palmer, an active local science fiction fan. Palmer was hired that February, taking over editorial duties with the June 1938 issue. Ziff-Davis launched Fantastic Adventures, a fantasy companion to Amazing, in May 1939, also under Palmer's editorship. Palmer quickly managed to improve Amazing's circulation, and in November 1938, the magazine went monthly again, though this did not last throughout Palmer's tenure: between 1944 and 1946 the magazine was bimonthly and then quarterly for <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>before</b> returning to a longer-lasting monthly schedule.|$|E

Callie also left Arizona at therapy, telling {{her that she was}} the only one that needed to go. After being hit by a lawsuit, her father, Carlos, visits and tells Callie that he cheated on her mother but she took him back and Callie wouldn't be here if her mother didn't give Carlos a second chance. Callie goes to Arizona's apartment and invites her to come back home. Callie finds out during surgery that Arizona was sleeping with Leah, a second year resident, while separated. Although angry at Arizona, Callie still agrees to work things out.|$|E

At the Brixton show, Grant Nicholas announced that the band would be going away for <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> <b>before</b> deciding what to do next. Earlier on before the tour began, Nicholas was interviewed by website Mancunian Matters in which {{he told them that}} the band would take a break next year with no shows planned, although a follow-up album was mentioned alongside possible side-projects.|$|E

5|$|Letting bean dip sit for <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>before</b> serving can {{increase}} the intermingling of flavors in the dish. Bean dip can be served cold, at room temperature, or as a hot dish. Hot bean dip can be prepared ahead of time, refrigerated and then cooked at a later time, and can also be prepared using a slow cooker and served in the appliance. Bean dip can be prepared as a vegan and gluten-free dish. The dish is typically served with tortilla chips, and can also be served with crackers, crudités, breadsticks, pita bread and toasted bread such as baguette.|$|E

The state highway curves southeast and crosses over MD90 (Ocean City Expressway) with no access, then turns south through the hamlet of St. Martin before intersecting US50 (Ocean Gateway). MD346 turns southeast, paralleling US50 for <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>before</b> turning south toward the center of Berlin. Upon entering the town limits of Berlin, the state highway curves east to intersect MD818 (Main Street). MD346 has a grade crossing of the Maryland and Delaware Railroad's Snow Hill Line track, then intersects MD377 (Williams Street) immediately before an intersection with US113 (Worcester Highway). The state highway passes south of Atlantic General Hospital and veers northeast to its eastern terminus at a tangent intersection with US50.|$|E
5|$|Rupert {{then finally}} made a {{successful}} crossing into the Caribbean, landing first at Saint Lucia, before continuing {{up the chain}} of the Antilles to the Virgin Islands. There the fleet {{was hit by a}} terrible hurricane, which scattered the ships and sank the Defiance, this time with Prince Maurice on board. It was <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>before</b> Maurice's death became certain, which came as a terrible blow to Rupert. He was forced to return to Europe, arriving in France in March 1653 with a fleet of five ships. It became clear, as the profits and losses of the piracy campaign were calculated, that the venture had not been as profitable as hoped. This complicated tensions in the Royalist court, and Charles II and Rupert eventually split the spoils, after which Rupert, tired and a little bitter, returned to France to recuperate from the long campaign.|$|E

5|$|The video {{begins with}} Corgan reading {{a comic book}} dressed in an ice cream man uniform. A clip of the intro to the song is played and stopped {{repeatedly}} before the song begins. Groups {{of two or more}} people are kissing each other around Corgan as he drives in an ice cream van through a desert. Corgan picks up a dress-wearing Iha and the two drive for <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>before</b> stopping at a gas station, where Chamberlin and Wretzky appear as gas attendants. After Iha changes into a yellow and white cowboy outfit, the band paints the van in a multitude of colors. More people are shown kissing in the hills as the band drives away from the gas station in the van. However, Corgan is ultimately kicked out of the van, and the video ends with Corgan walking off the road wearing a cowboy hat as the van drives away. The video was filmed on August 29, 1993.|$|E
5|$|While at the discothèque, De Simone and Savage were {{together}} throughout the evening, and DeSimone did not consume any alcoholic drinks. They left the night club together, and Savage drove DeSimone {{back to the}} Tom Tackle car park, arriving sometime between 00:30 and 01:00 (12:30 and 1:00a.m.) on 5December. Savage testified that she drove into the covered parking area and that they sat chatting for <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>before</b> DeSimone made the short walk to her car, at which point Savage reversed out and drove away from the scene. Savage was the last witness to see DeSimone before she was killed.|$|E
5|$|After {{agreeing on}} an initial idea, Bushnell and Dabney {{began trying to}} design a {{prototype}} based on a Data General Nova. Initially {{they were joined by}} Larry Bryan, a computer programmer who also worked at Ampex. Bushnell and Dabney put US$100 each into a partnership, named Syzygy by Bryan. They soon ran into difficulties with their planned design; the computer was not powerful enough to refresh the monitors as fast as was needed to make the game playable. Bryan realized this early on, when trying to design the code needed to run the games, and left the project before Syzygy was formed without ever contributing any money, but Bushnell and Dabney continued working on the design for several more months. The pair attempted to reduce the load on the computer by replacing subroutines—such as displaying the background stars—with specialized hardware, but it proved insufficient; even reducing the number of monitors was not enough. By the end of November 1970, Bushnell decided to abandon the project as untenable, while Dabney had stopped working on the design <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>before.</b> It is unclear if the pair were aware that Data General had demonstrated a more powerful variant of the Nova, sold for US$8,000, running a single game of Spacewar at the Fall Joint Computer Conference in December 1968, though that solution would have been too expensive for an arcade game, which typically cost US$1,000 at the time. Unable to put the game idea out of his mind, however, Bushnell soon thought of a way to manipulate the video signal on the screen without a computer controlling it, and from there Syzygy {{came up with the idea}} of removing the computer altogether and building specialized hardware to handle everything for the game instead.|$|E

5|$|The match {{began as}} a scrappy affair, with plenty of {{challenges}} and little expansive football on show. The game's first notable chance went to Rooney, but Kolo Touré intervened and blocked his effort. Rooney then played in Giggs, whose shot was closed down by Sol Campbell. It took <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>before</b> Arsenal gained composure and played their usual passing game, and a move involving Edu and Fredrik Ljungberg in the 19th minute resulted in Rio Ferdinand carelessly tackling the latter. Ferdinand was not shown a card for his challenge – the first controversial decision referee Riley made during the match, which surprised Arsenal as the defender made a professional foul to prevent Ljungberg running clear on goal. Bergkamp exchanged passes with Reyes {{to open up the}} United defence, but the Dutchman's shot was saved by Roy Carroll. The United goalkeeper was on hand to save Henry's low shot three minutes before the break, after the striker was put through by Edu. During the first half action, both Neville brothers (Gary and Phil) were booked for fouling Reyes. Ashley Cole also received a yellow card for his tackle on Rooney. The Arsenal defender was {{on the receiving end of}} a challenge by Van Nistelrooy minutes after, as he attempted to shield the ball and hold on to possession. Television replays showed Van Nistelrooy ran his studs down Cole's shins, but the striker was not punished by Riley despite the action being in full view of his assistant at the touchline.|$|E
