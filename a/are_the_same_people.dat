They <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>people,</b> {{and they do not}} want to apologize for all their actions in the past." [...] Attorney Karen Nersisyan agrees: [...] "Serbsky is not an organ of medicine. It's an organ of power." [...] According to human rights activist and former psychiatrist Sofia Dorinskaya, the system of Soviet psychiatry has not been destroyed, the Serbsky Institute is standing where it did, the same people who worked in the Soviet system are working there. She says we have a situation like after the defeat of fascism in Germany, when fascism officially collapsed, but all governors of acres, judges and all people remained after the fascist regime.|$|E

2500|$|In 2000, Russia's {{political}} analyst Andrei Piontkovsky called Putinism [...] "the highest and culminating stage of bandit capitalism in Russia". He said: [...] "Russia is not corrupt.

2500|$|The plaintiffs' lawyer {{spent six}} days trying to {{convince}} the court that Islam should not be considered a religion and that the mosque was not entitled to religious land use zoning regulations [...] "because these <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>people</b> who flew jets into the World Trade Center on 9/11." [...] The lawyer, Joe Brandon Jr, called a series of non-expert witnesses, including anti-Islam activist Frank Gaffney, accused the ICM of being linked to terrorism, and claimed that its members wanted to impose Sharia law on the United States. The proceedings were criticized by the county's attorney as a [...] "circus". The media compared the case to the 1925 Scopes Monkey Trial, at which evolution was effectively put on trial, while Miami Herald columnist Leonard Pitts characterized the mosque's opponents as a [...] "clownish band of bigots".|$|E
2500|$|Joof (English {{spelling}} in the Gambia) or Diouf (French spelling in Senegal and Mauritania) is a surname typically Serer. This surname is also spelt Juuf or Juf (in the Serer language). They <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>people.</b> The {{differences in}} spelling is because Senegal was colonized by France, while the Gambia was colonized by Britain. Although spelt differently, they are pronounced the same way. The totem and {{symbol of the}} Joof family is the antelope, the symbol of grace, royalty, wisdom, hard work and protection in Serer mythology. The name of their clan is [...] "Njoofene" [...] variations: [...] "Njuufeen" [...] or [...] "Njufeen" [...] (in Serer). Members of this family had ruled over many of the pre-colonial kingdoms of Senegambia, including the Kingdom of Sine, the Kingdom of Saloum and the Kingdom of Baol. The royal princesses (Lingeers) from the Joof family were also given in marriage to the pre-colonial kings and princes of Senegambia. Some of these included the kings of Jolof, kings of Waalo, kings of Cayor and Baol (after 1549 following the Battle of Danki). From these marriages, they provided many heirs to the thrones of these kingdoms. Although usually associated with Serer royalty, the Joof family also figure prominently in Serer religious affairs.|$|E

Aurel Stein says that <b>the</b> Tukharas (Tokharoi/Tokarai) <b>were</b> {{a branch of the}} Yuezhi. [...] P. C. Bagchi holds that the Yuezhi, Tocharioi and Tushara were identical.

2500|$|In September 2016, {{during the}} first presidential debate, Trump said he doubted whether anyone knew who hacked the DNC, and disputed Russian interference. During the second debate, Trump said there {{might not have been}} hacking at all, and {{questioned}} why accountability was placed on Russia. During the third debate, Trump rejected Clinton's claim that Putin favored Trump. After the election, Trump rejected the CIA analysis and asserted that the reports were politically motivated to deflect from the Democrats' electoral defeat. Trump's transition team said in a brief statement: [...] "These <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>people</b> that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction." [...] However, the intelligence analysts involved in monitoring Russian activities are different from those who assessed that Iraq had stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction, while post–Iraq War reforms have made it less likely for similar errors to reach {{the highest levels of the}} U.S. intelligence community. Trump dismissed reports of Russia's interference, calling them [...] "ridiculous"; he placed blame on Democrats upset over election results for publicizing these reports, and cited Julian Assange's statement that [...] "a 14-year-old kid could have hacked Podesta." [...] After Obama expelled 35 Russian diplomats and announced further sanctions on Russia, Trump commended Putin for refraining from retaliatory measures against the United States until the Trump administration would lay out its policy towards Russia.|$|E
