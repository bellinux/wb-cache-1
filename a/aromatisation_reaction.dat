These 1, 2 -dialkylbenzenes in combination with monoalkylbenzenes and 2 -alkyltoluenes dominate the alkylbenzene distribution in this "immature" oil. This phenomenon lends support to the hypothesis that alkylbenzenes are formed in the subsurface by cyclisation and <b>aromatisation</b> <b>reactions</b> of linear, functionalised precursors.

30|$|The {{selectivities}} to C 2 and C 3 for the Cr modified catalysts decrease {{slightly from}} the third to the last hour and follow the trend that at higher conversions higher selectivities are observed. Interestingly, no change in selectivity to ethylene or propylene is observed {{for an increase in}} chromium loading. The ethylene and propylene selectivity in the third and last hours of the reaction of 3 and 1.7 % and approximately 10 and 7 %, respectively, is maintained. Selectivity to C 4 olefins remains constant for all catalysts while a slight increase to C 5 olefins is noticed. However, when compared to Fe modified catalysts the Cr catalysts have a much lower selectivity to lower olefins (C 2 –C 5) in both the third and last hours of the reaction. A difference of 30 % is observed when 2 % Fe is compared to 2 % Cr in the last hour. This indicates that Fe is a better promoter to enhance selectivity to light olefins than Cr. It is possible that the difference in acidity is responsible for the difference in selectivity. As the Cr ZSM- 5 has slightly higher total acidities when compared to Fe, readsorption of light olefins on acid sites may occur leading to secondary <b>aromatisation</b> <b>reactions</b> thus also indicating zeolites with a lower acid site density would give selectivity to light olefins while suppressing aromatics formation [18].|$|R

The homogeneously catalysed reaction of acetylene to yield benzene at room temperature is a well known process for transition metal cluster compounds,l whereas heterogeneously catalysed <b>aromatisation</b> <b>reactions</b> are usually encountered only at much higher temperatures on bifunctional catalysts (e. g., ref. 2, ca. 550 K on Pt-SiO,). Recently, however, Bertolini et al. 3 have observed benzene formation from acetylene over Ni-Si 02 at 300 K. This communication reports on the first observation of a low temperature (ca. 200 K) heterogeneously catalysed reaction of acetylene to form ben-zene on apure Pd(ll 1) single crystal surface in a well controlled environment.

40|$|Includes abstract. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 76 - 82). The {{product of}} the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis is low in aromatics {{and as a result}} has relatively poor gasoline quality (with respect to the octane number). Due to the low octane value of gasoline, extensive work-up to improve the octane number is required. Thus the cracking of longer chain hydrocarbons and the oligomerisation of light olefins may increase the yield of gasoline products. The branched and aromatic products formed from skeleton isomerisation and <b>aromatisation</b> <b>reaction</b> over acid zeolites have a high octane number. Thus an alternative process proposed for the production of high quality gasoline from synthesis gas utilises a composite catalyst comprising of an alkali promoted iron based Fischer Tropsch (FT) catalyst and an acidic co-catalyst (ZSM- 5) [Udaya et al, 1990; Schulz et al, 1991].

40|$|Zeolite {{catalysts}} {{have been}} evaluated for the gas-phase conversion of decane, to study new routes for upgrading intermediate-length straight chain hydrocarbons. For a gas-feed of dilute n-decane in an inert carrier, at a contact time of 4 s, the initial activity of ZSM- 5 and Ga/ZSM- 5 was consistently high (> 95 % conversion) over the temperature range 300 – 460 °C. The parent zeolite produced almost equal yields of cracked hydrocarbons and aromatics, while the Ga-modified zeolite produced predominantly BTX and other heavier aromatics. This difference in product distribution {{is consistent with the}} short-chain alkanes formed within the internal pore structure of the zeolite being intermediates in a Cyclar-type aromatisation mechanism, while the direct conversion of decane to heavy (C 10 –C 15) aromatics occurs at the unconstrained external acid sites. Under aerobic conditions, the rate of CO formation was negligible and CO 2 was barely detectable over either the parent or the Ga-modified zeolite, even though all the O 2 was consumed. The ability of Ga/ZSM- 5 to catalyse selective oxidation, of the H 2 released during the dehydrogenation steps, thus provides the prospect of the <b>aromatisation</b> <b>reaction</b> being operated autothermally. Although the external sites are preferentially blocked by carbon retention, rapid deactivation did not occur until after 65 h on line (under either anaerobic or aerobic conditions) when blocking of the internal pore structure became limiting...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{synthesis}} a range of substituted arene hydrates, determine their second-order rate constant for dehydration and generate a Hammett plot for comparison with other published p-values for similar carbocation-forming reactions. The first hydrate presented is the methyl benzoate hydrate (see section 2. 1). A number of first order rate constants for the aromatisation (dehydration) reaction were determined in dilute perchloric acid at ionic strength 0. 5 maintained with sodium perchlorate. The reaction was followed by UV-Vis spectrophotometry and (^ 1) H NMR spectroscopy. The second order rate constant {{was determined to be}} 9. 32 X l 0 (^- 2) М(^- 1) s(^- 1) which corresponds to a half-life of 7 seconds in 1 M HCIO(_ 4). The arene hydrate of biphenyl was also synthesised (see section 2. 2). The solubility issues discussed in section 2. 2. 2 meant the <b>aromatisation</b> <b>reaction</b> could not be followed by (^ 1) H NMR spectroscopy. The first order rate constants were determined in acetate and phosphate buffers, at ionic strength 0. 5, maintainted with sodium Perchlorate, from pH 5 to 7. The second order rate constant was determined to be 2. 11 X 10 (^ 2) M(^- 1) s(^- 1) which corresponds to a half-life of 3. 3 X 10 (^- 4) s in 1 M HCIO(_ 4). As presented in sections 2. 3 - 2. 7, the synthetic route to the alkyl substituted hydrates gave two products - the ortho and the ipso hydrates. In the case of the ethyl substituted hydrate only the ortho hydrate was synthesised. For R = tBu, only a small proportion of the products formed was the ipso hydrate due to Its reactivity. The ortho and ipso hydrates of toluene and cumene were both synthesised. These could not be separated and so the aromatisation kinetics were followed in situ and fitted to a double exponential equation. The aromatisation reactions were followed by UV-vis spectrophotometry in acetate and phosphate buffers at 25 С and ionic strength 0. 5 M, maintained with sodium perchlorate. The second-order rate constants for aromatisation for the ortho-hydrates were determined to be for R = Me, Et, iPr, tBu and are 514, 538, 642 and 949 M (^- 1) s(^- 1), respectively. The second-order rate constants for aromatisation for the ipso-hydrates isolated were determined to be for R = Me and iPr are 9. 81 x 10 (^ 3) and 1. 47 X 10 (^ 4) (^- 1) s(^- 1). A number of linear free energy correlations were attempted and the best correlation was found with σ(^+), this is consistent with a reaction involving a planar carbocation with through-bond stabilisation. The p-value was determined to be - 6. 5. The published p- value for the cis dihydrodiols, where a better correlation with Op was reported, is - 8. 2 (^ 1). The magnitude of p suggests the hydrates have an earlier transition state to carbocation formation than the diols with less positive charge build-up. The computational results show that the carbocation intermediate formed during the <b>aromatisation</b> <b>reaction</b> of the hydrates is planar whereas the carbocation intermediate generated from the diols is puckered. This corroborates the results from the kinetic analysis and also the magnitude and sign of the p-values from the Hammett correlations. When the carbocation intermediate is puckered, the through-bond stabilisation is hindered and so a poor correlation with σ(^+) is observed. The rate constant for acid-catalysed isomerisation of optically active cis-indene dihydrodiol was determined. This represents the rate constant for formation of the corresponding carbocation intermediate. The second-order rate constant for carbocation formation (k(_H)) was determined by (^ 1) H NMR spectroscopy in concentrated perchloric acid to be 1. 11 X 10 (- 6) M (^- 1) s(^- 1). This is comparable with the second-order rate constant for carbocation formation in teri-butanol which is 1. 4 X 10 (^- 6) M(^- 1) s(^- 1). The rate constant for reaction of the carbocation intermediate with water k(_H 20) determined using the azide- trapping technique, is 4. 99 X 10 (^ 8) s(^- 1). Combining k(_H 20) with k(_H) allows the (_p) K(_R) of the indene dihydrodiol carbocation to be calculated. The (_p) K(_R) was determined to be - 14. 6. This is greater than the (_p) K(_R) of the indanol carbocation. The effect of the adjacent hydroxyl group counteracts the stabilising effect of the benzylic substituent.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} cyclometallation at Pd, Mn and Co: functionalisation of C H and C≡C bonds involving cyclisation, rearrangement and isomerisation processes. The use of NaNO 2 /NaNO 3 as an oxidant in oxidative Pd-catalyzed processes {{has recently}} been reported as a complementary co-catalyst to other common oxidants (e. g. CuII/AgI salts). In view of this (Chapter two) the synthesis {{of a series of}} palladacyclic complexes containing a C^N ligand backbone, and the geometry and linkage isomerism at NO 2 Pd, has been studied. The geometry about the Pd(II) centre shows the crucial role played by bulky ligands in creating hindrance and affecting phosphine dissociation. Mn-catalysed C-H bond activation is a powerful strategy for the functionalisation of organic compounds containing metal-directing groups. Chapter three of this thesis reports the characterisation of a highly reactive 7 -membered MnI species which acts as anvil point between protonation and reductive elimination to deliver alkenylated and/or pyridinium products respectively. Both processes are exemplified through the reactions of a substrate containing a 2 -pyridyl directing group and electron-deficient 2 -pyrone motif at MnI, where C-H bond activation occurs regioselectively at C 3 within the 2 -pyrone. An unprecedented regioselective Diels-Alder reaction also occurs on both the pyridine and 2 -pyrone ring systems. These findings provide a unique insight into MnI-mediated C-H bond activation processes, especially how relatively minor changes in substrate structure influence the product distribution. The study shows that MnI-based metallocycles warrant further study more generally in organic and organometallic chemistry The intermolecular Pauson-Khand (PK) reactions of sterically comparable (2 -pyridylethynyl) -heteroaromatic compounds with norbornene, mediated by Co 2 (CO) 8 to give cyclopentenone products, were examined in Chapter four of this thesis. The π-deficient heteroaromatic substrate, 2 -pyrone, favoured the -position while the π-rich heteroaromatics such as 2 -thiophene favour the β-position. The position of the nitrogen in pyridyl-containing alkyne substrates also affects the regiochemical outcome of the PK reaction. A 2 -pyridyl alkyne, possessing a proximal nitrogen atom, influences the regioselectivity relative to a 4 -pyridyl variant, quite dramatically, favouring the β-position in the newly formed cyclopentenone ring. Overall, the type of heteroaromatic group greatly influences PK regioselectivity. The PK cycloadducts undergo a 6 π-electrocyclisation–oxidative <b>aromatisation</b> <b>reaction</b> in the presence of light, which is promoted by a LED UV-light controlled system, affording benzo[h]indeno[1, 2 -f]isochromene type products. ...|$|E
40|$|Allylic {{substitution}} is {{an important}} procedure for carbon-carbon, carbon-nitrogen and carbon-oxygen bond formation, and palladium-mediated allylic substitution reactions have previously been employed in the synthesis of a range a physiologically active and natural products. 2, 5 -Dicarbon substituted 2, 5 -dihydrofurans have not to date been synthesised by palladium-mediated allylic substitution reactions. It {{was found in the}} first part of the work that allylic substitution reactions of 2, 5 -diacetoxy- 2, 5 -dihydrofuran with a tertiary carbon nucleophile did not result in the desired mono-substitution product due to the elimination of acetic acid from the product, to form the aromatised furan derivative. In an attempt to differentiate between the two potential leaving groups on the dihydrofuran, one of the acetate groups was displaced in a palladium-mediated allylic substitution reaction. This approach was also intended to inhibit the <b>aromatisation</b> <b>reaction.</b> The desired product 2 -acetoxy- 5 -phenoxy- 2, 5 -dihydofuran was obtained. The palladium-mediated allylic substitution reactions of this product with a range of tertiary carbon nucleophiles provided the desired mono-substituted dihydrofuran products in good yield with minimal by-products being detected. The substitution of the phenoxy-leaving group with a carbon nucleophile, however, was not achieved under a range of reaction conditions. Other more electrondeficient phenol derivatives were used in the initial substitution reactions but due to time constraints the work could not be completed in the current study. This would hopefully have increased the leaving group ability of the phenoxy group and the desired disubstituted dihydrofuran would have been achieved, and this will be the subject of further work in this regard. Milder reaction conditions were applied to 2, 5 -diacetoxy- 2, 5 -dihydrofuran in its reaction with a tertiary carbon nucleophile. The desired mono-substituted mono acetoxy products were obtained in reasonable yields when column chromatography was performed at – 15 °C and the silica was neutralised with Et 3 N. These mono-acetoxy products were reacted with a range of tertiary carbon nucleophiles and the desired disubstituted dihydrofurans could be prepared in reasonable yields. One-pot reactions were investigated by using three equivalents of nucleophile and in most cases the desired symmetrical dihydrofuran was achieved. This result prompted the investigation into the synthesis of disubstituted dihydrofurans in a one-pot reaction by successive addition of two carbon nucleophiles with 2, 5 - diacetoxy- 2, 5 -dihydrofuran. The disubstituted dihydrofurans were isolated in higher yields than the two-pot procedure and the complex purification procedure developed was not necessary. This study, therefore, allowed for the synthesis of a range of symmetrical and unsymmetrical dicarbon substituted dihydrofurans. This methodology will later be applied to the synthesis of a range of natural products. Prof. D. B. G. William...|$|E
