5|$|Arsenal {{were not}} to win the League or the FA Cup for another 18 years. The '53 Champions squad was old, and the club failed to attract strong enough replacements.

Whatever her fate, Goldilocks fares better than Southey's vagrant old woman who, in his opinion, {{deserved}} <b>a</b> <b>stint</b> in the House of Correction, and far better than Miss Mure's old woman who is impaled upon a steeple in St Paul's church-yard.|$|E

5|$|Other major plot {{elements}} were the 1937 marriage of Winnie to engineer Will Wright and {{the disappearance of}} Will during World War II, leaving a pregnant Winnie behind. This realistic and unfortunate situation was too risqué for some newspapers: The Baltimore Sun dropped the strip early in 1941 because of the pregnancy of Winnie. The comic strip changed significantly over the years; with Winnie working in the fashion industry after the war, seemingly as a widow until her husband returned after a few decades. She took on various other jobs and endeavors over the years, including <b>a</b> <b>stint</b> in the Peace Corps.|$|E
