500|$|The film {{received}} generally negative {{reviews from}} film critics. LaRue Cook of Entertainment Weekly graded the film with a [...] "D" [...] and wrote, [...] "what {{was once a}} fresh slice of teen comedy has become a slab of stale crudeness." [...] Scott Weinberg of Moviefone, in his negative review, found the film [...] "slightly more amusing to sit through than the two previous entries", in particular praising the Star Trek sexual roleplay scene as [...] "extremely effective." [...] DVD Talk's Jeffrey Robinson writes that [...] "if anything, it will bore you <b>and</b> <b>leave</b> <b>you</b> wondering why you wasted {{an hour and a}} half of your life." [...] Writing in JoBlo.com, Adam Quigley poked fun at the film's themes, declaring that [...] "if there's a lesson to be taken from these films, it's that women are objects, and should always be treated as such." [...] IGNs Hock Teh gave the film 5/10, writing that it [...] "stays very close to the American Pie formula," [...] while criticizing the story as [...] "devoid of anything remotely semi-compelling or even noteworthy." [...] Peter Hammond of Maxim describes American Pie Presents: Beta House as [...] "loaded with sex, laughs and raunchy fun," [...] writing that it [...] "may be the most outrageous slice of pie yet!" ...|$|E
2500|$|By {{the age of}} 20, when {{he passed}} through Vilnius, his fame preceded him. Both Rabbi Eliyahu Eliezer Grodnenski [...] the leading Rav of Vilna and the {{son-in-law}} of Rabbi Yisroel Salanter [...] and Rabbi Elinke Levinsohn of Kretinga desired the young Torah prodigy for their own son-in-law. The two went to Rabbi Yitzchak Elchanan Spektor of Kovno to decide which family would merit this honor. After hearing each one's position, Rabbi Spector asked to meet Rabbi Grodzinski, and spoke at length with him on various Torah topics. Afterward, Rabbi Spector told the two prospective fathers-in-law: [...] "The truth is that if I had a daughter to marry off, I would take him <b>and</b> <b>leave</b> <b>you</b> both out in the cold. Since I have no such daughter, however, I have decided {{in favor of the}} Rav of Vilna".|$|E
2500|$|A {{siege of}} Khartoum by the Mahdist forces {{commanded}} by the Mahdi himself started on 18 March 1884. Initially, {{the siege of}} Khartoum was more in nature a blockade rather than a true siege as the Mahdi's forces lacked the strength to wage a proper siege, for example only cutting the telegraphy lines in April 1884. The British had decided to abandon the Sudan, {{but it was clear}} that Gordon had other plans, and the public increasingly called for a relief expedition. Gordon's last telegrams were clearly meant for the British public with one message addressed to Baring reading: [...] "You state your intention of not sending any relief force up here to Berber...I shall hold on here as long as I can, and if I can suppress the rebellion, I shall do so. If I cannot, I shall retire to the Equator <b>and</b> <b>leave</b> <b>you</b> with the indelible disgrace of abandoning the garrisons".|$|E

6000|$|... "But if {{he gives}} you?" [...] Mrs. Assingham presumed to object. [...] "Doesn't it {{moreover}} then," [...] she asked, [...] "complete the very purpose {{with which he}} married--that of making <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>you</b> more free?" ...|$|R

5000|$|Rundell's hobbies include tightrope {{walking and}} roof walking, and she claims to begin {{each day with}} a cartwheel because [...] "reading is {{almost exactly the same}} as cartwheeling: it turns the world upside down <b>and</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>you</b> breathless".|$|R
6000|$|... "Nonsense!" [...] exclaimed Edna. [...] "You can {{put that}} idea {{out of your}} head instantly. I would not think of going away <b>and</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>you</b> here. If the captain had wanted you to stay, he would have said so." ...|$|R
60|$|You know, perhaps, that {{sinister}} {{something that}} comes like a {{hand out of}} the unseen and grips your heart about.

6000|$|... "No longer," [...] said Archie, firmly. [...] "I mean to say, a chappie {{who makes}} {{you stand on}} a bally {{pedestal}} sort of arrangement and get a crick in the spine, and then doesn't turn up <b>and</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>you</b> biffing all over the countryside in a bathing suit--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is the {{business}} of parents to name their children;--but enough. I must <b>leave</b> <b>thee,</b> good Gelsomina, <b>and</b> I <b>leave</b> <b>thee</b> with a heavy heart." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] {{declared}} Kiki. [...] "I {{can transform}} {{you into a}} stick of wood, in a flash, or into a stone, <b>and</b> <b>leave</b> <b>you</b> here by the roadside." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you want}} me to go away <b>and</b> <b>leave</b> <b>you</b> locked in the vault?" [...] {{continued}} Sam. [...] "It would be a beautiful place in which to die of starvation." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It {{was as much}} as {{we could}} do to hold them in hand, when they saw you {{surrounded}} by the French. They would have rushed back again, to a man, if we would have let them. I own I felt it hard, myself, to be marching away <b>and</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>you</b> behind." ...|$|R
60|$|Conceit, indeed, is {{the quickest}} cure for it. When it once begins to dawn upon {{you that you}} are a good deal cleverer than any one else in this world, bashfulness becomes shocked <b>and</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>you.</b> When you can look round a roomful of people and think that each one is a mere child in intellect {{compared}} with yourself you feel no more shy of them than you would of a select company of magpies or orang-outangs.|$|R
6000|$|... "Son, {{the thing}} that was needed was a change of nurses," [...] he said gently. [...] "I intend to make up some sleep now <b>and</b> <b>leave</b> <b>you</b> in better care." ...|$|E
60|$|It's always risky work {{waiting for}} other people to die <b>and</b> <b>leave</b> <b>you</b> money. Sometimes they don't die; {{sometimes}} they marry agin; and sometimes they leave it to other people instead.|$|E

5000|$|Lauren Kalal of Fandomania {{rated the}} episode with 4.5/5. [...] "This episode pulls {{out all the}} punches, <b>and</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>you</b> begging for more.

I, for one, am re-invested in this show’s potential, now that it has established itself as something beyond the usual fare of its fellow CW shows." ...|$|R
