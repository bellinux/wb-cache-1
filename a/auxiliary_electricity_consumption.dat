40|$|A {{comparison}} is {{made between the}} ambient and conventional temperature alkaline electrolysers in terms of operational system, voltage efficiency and corrosion rates. The capital, operational and maintenance costs are reduced by reducing auxiliary equipment as well as auxiliary utilities in the ambient temperature alkaline electrolyser. Also, since <b>auxiliary</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>consumption</b> is reduced, the alkaline electrolyser is capable for dynamic, continuous and fast-response operation with renewable energy sources. The ambient temperature alkaline electrolyser is capable for wider operational range and faster response time when powered by wind energy sources. Although the voltage efficiency for hydrogen production is increased by about 12 % at the conventional operating temperature, corrosion rate of the electrode is increased {{by a factor of}} about 6. 3. The voltage efficiency for hydrogen production, however, is increased by about 12 % by employing electrocatalyst in the ambient temperature alkaline electrolyser, and there is benefit of enhancing lifetime durability of the electrode as well as cell components at relatively lower operating temperatur...|$|E
40|$|Small scale (solar-) {{thermally}} driven cooling systems suffer from two important drawbacks: firstly, the systems usually offer {{no means of}} adapting the chilling capacity to the actual load; secondly constantly running pumps and fans lead to high <b>auxiliary</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>consumption</b> even when the available driving and cooling water temperatures only allow a reduced chilling capacity. To solve these problems a generic approach for controlling the main parasitic electrical devices – the cooling water pump and the heat rejection fan - {{as a function of}} the actual boundary conditions was developed. Different variants of control strategies are analyzed in different system configurations under a variety of climates and load conditions by means of dynamic system simulations in TRNSYS. The most typical combinations of ab- and adsorption chillers with dry cooler and wet cooling tower are covered. The results show that capacity modulation can be realized well by this approach. Additionally electricity savings of up to 25 % can be achieved for reasonably sized systems compared to a reference control strategy with fixed pump speed and fixed cooling water set temperature. Yet it becomes obvious that the concrete savings depend strongly on the system configuration and boundary conditions...|$|E
40|$|A {{solar thermal}} system with {{seasonal}} borehole storage for heating of a residential area in Anneberg, Sweden, approximately 10 km north of Stockholm, {{has been in}} operation since late 2002. Originally, the project {{was part of the}} EU THERMIE project “Large-scale Solar Heating Systems for Housing Developments” (REB/ 0061 / 97) and was the first solar heating plant in Europe with borehole storage in rock not utilizing a heat pump. Earlier evaluations of the system show lower performance than the preliminary simulation study, with residents complaining of a high use of electricity for domestic hot water (DHW) preparation and auxiliary heating. One explanation mentioned in the earlier evaluations is that the borehole storage had not yet reached “steady state” temperatures at the time of evaluation. Many years have passed since then and this paper presents results from a new evaluation. The main aim of this work is to evaluate the current performance of the system based on several key figures, as well as on system function based on available measurement data. The analysis show that though the borehole storage now has reached a quasi-steady state and operates as intended, the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>consumption</b> is much higher than the original design values largely due to high losses in the distribution network, higher heat loads as well as lower solar gains.

40|$|Purpose / Context - Residential energy {{consumption}} except heating (RECEH) {{plays an important}} role in China. The purposes of this study were to analyze RECEH in Beijing and find out the influence factors of RECEH. Methodology / Approach - A survey of 2024 households in Beijing was undertaken. The investigat-ed residences were located in 23 residential communities and two farmers markets. Questionnaire contents included six aspects: building information, building envelope, living style, <b>auxiliary</b> household appliance, <b>electricity</b> <b>consumption</b> and other energy <b>consumption.</b> While <b>electricity</b> <b>consumption</b> in 8571 families, gas consumption in 189 families, and water consumption in 414 families have been measured by the meter readings last for four months and a year. This paper obtained the results by a method combining data statistics with grey correlation analysis. Results –The results showed that the annual average <b>consumption</b> of <b>electricity</b> and air conditioner electricity in each household was 1689 and 160. 4 kWh separately. In addition, the quantity of annual average gas usage was 140 m³/household and the water consumption was 80 m³/household. The analysis of influence factor showed that usable floor area and number of household members was the most profound impact on the entire <b>electricity</b> and gas <b>consumption</b> respectively. The most im-portant influence factor of high, middle, low level <b>electricity</b> <b>consumption</b> families was the number of glass layers, number of household members and temperature setting of air conditioner separately.

This paper examines the seasonal characteristics of <b>electricity</b> <b>consumption</b> in Hong Kong—a subtropical city with 7 million people. Using the data from January 1970 to December 2014, two novel nonlinear seasonal models for <b>electricity</b> <b>consumption</b> in the residential and commercial sectors were obtained. The models show that the city’s monthly residential and commercial <b>electricity</b> <b>consumption</b> patterns have different seasonal variations. Specifically, monthly residential <b>electricity</b> <b>consumption</b> (mainly for appliances and cooling in summer) has a quadratic relationship with monthly mean air temperature, while monthly commercial <b>electricity</b> <b>consumption</b> has a linear relationship with monthly mean air temperature.

Through the first, policy scenarios are explored regarding efficiency, smart meter and consumer behaviour while with the second broader factors are considered that affect household <b>electricity</b> <b>consumption...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Electricity</b> <b>consumption</b> in the {{industrial}} sector experienced a dramatic increase between 1998 and 2007, accounting for approximately 75 % of China's total <b>electricity</b> <b>consumption.</b> This study analyzes the potential factors influencing the growth of <b>electricity</b> <b>consumption</b> in China's industrial sector {{over the past decade}} using a logarithmic mean Divisia index I decomposition method. Results show that activity effect and shift effect (caused by the change in the electricity's share of industrial energy use) are the major factors responsible for the rise in <b>electricity</b> <b>consumption</b> between 1998 and 2007. It is found that structural change also contributed to the increase in <b>electricity</b> <b>consumption,</b> it had only a small effect. In contrast, the technological effect is responsible for a decrease in <b>electricity</b> <b>consumption</b> during this period. The influences of technological effects and shift effects followed approximately an inverse-U-shaped and U-shaped curve, respectively. Furthermore, the results show that the main contributors to incremental <b>electricity</b> <b>consumption</b> among industrial subsectors were manufacturing of raw chemical material and products, manufacturing of non-metal mineral products, smelting and pressing of ferrous and non-ferrous metals, and production and supply of electric power and heat power. These sectors should take priority for industrial restructuring in order to implement policies for energy and electricity savings.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{contribution}} is an investigation of causal interdependences between <b>electricity</b> <b>consumption</b> and GDP in Poland. Our research was conducted for total <b>electricity</b> <b>consumption</b> {{as well as for}} the industrial <b>consumption</b> of <b>electricity.</b> In order to reflect the causality between GDP and <b>electricity</b> <b>consumption</b> properly we performed our investigations in a threedimensional framework with employment chosen as an additional variable. We used reliable quarterly data from the period Q 1 2000 - Q 4 2009. In order to check the stability of the causalities the investigations were performed on two samples: a full sample and a pre-crisis (i. e. Q 1 2000 - Q 3 2008) subsample. We applied both traditional methods as well as some recently developed econometric tools. We found feedback between total <b>electricity</b> <b>consumption</b> and GDP as well as between total <b>electricity</b> <b>consumption</b> and employment. We also found unidirectional causality running from industrial <b>electricity</b> <b>consumption</b> to employment and no direct causal links between industrial <b>electricity</b> <b>consumption</b> and GDP. In addition, all these findings were, in general, not seriously affected by the financial and economic crisis of 2008. A significant exception is the causal effect of industrial <b>electricity</b> <b>consumption</b> on employment, which was more pronounced after the crisis of 2008. ...|$|R
