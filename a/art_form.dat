5|$|Another theory by Shinhachiro Matsumoto {{suggests}} Noh {{originated from}} outcastes struggling to claim higher social status by catering {{to those in}} power, namely the new ruling samurai class of the time. The transferral of the shogunate from Kamakura to Kyoto {{at the beginning of}} Muromachi period marked the increasing power of the samurai class and strengthened the relationship between the shogunate and the court. As Noh became the shogun's favorite <b>art</b> <b>form,</b> Noh was able to become a courtly <b>art</b> <b>form</b> through this newly formed relationship. In 14th century, with strong support and patronage from shōgun Ashikaga Yoshimitsu, Zeami was able to establish Noh as the most prominent theatre <b>art</b> <b>form</b> of the time.|$|E

40|$|The main {{scope of}} the paper is to analyze modern oral <b>art</b> <b>forms</b> in view of their functions, {{the way in which}} they have evolved and the {{language}} which their users now prefer as a mode for their transmission. Given that over time the mode as well as the language of transmission has undergone some change, the paper then problematizes whether these traditional oral <b>art</b> <b>forms</b> should continue being called oral <b>art</b> <b>forms</b> in their modern state or they should just be labeled as <b>art</b> <b>forms.</b> By using Ndebele oral traditions as a basis for argument, the paper seeks to answer the following questions: ï‚· Are modern oral <b>art</b> <b>forms</b> still playing the same roles as those of the traditional Ndebele society did? ï‚· What are the effects of using the English language medium in the transmission of African oral traditions? ï‚· What new dimension have modern oral <b>art</b> <b>forms</b> taken in transmission, form and content? ï‚· What is the relevance and the implications of teaching contemporary oral traditions at universities and other institutions of learning? This paper interrogates the influence of culture contact on the Ndebele oral <b>art</b> <b>forms</b> and how their worldview and their culture is projected through the modern oral traditions. Modern literary traditions are highlighted showing how they differ from the traditional Ndebele ones. In concluding, the coping strategies that could be adopted by learning institutions in their attempts to keep African oral traditions relevant in todayâ€™s changing environments are suggested. The paper also notes the growing need by Higher Education institutions to review their curriculum in that direction...|$|R
