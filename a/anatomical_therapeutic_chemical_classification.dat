40|$|Abstract. The <b>Anatomical</b> <b>Therapeutic</b> <b>Chemical</b> (ATC) <b>classification</b> {{system is}} {{frequently}} used to classify drugs {{according to an}} encoding system that considers the organ or system on which they act on and/or their <b>therapeutic</b> class and <b>chemical</b> characteristics. Motivated by {{the maintenance of a}} French drug database, we have transformed, using an inductive approach, the chemical layer of this classification into an OWL knowledge base. Using this knowledge base, {{we have been able to}} design interesting novel application functionalities. Nevertheless, these functionalities require that drugs are annotated in a different way than is generally done right now. In this paper, we highlight several French databases that are not fully benefiting from their ATC usage, present our annotation best practice and emphasize on the gains of its adoption. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Nanomaterial-modified {{detection}} systems {{represent a}} chief driver towards {{the adoption of}} electrochemical methods, since nanomaterials enable functional tunability, ability to self-assemble, and novel electrical, optical and cat-alytic properties that emerge at this scale. This results in tremendous gains in terms of sensitivity, selectivity and ver-satility. We review the electrochemical methods and mecha-nisms that may {{be applied to the}} detection of neurological drugs. We focus on understanding how specific nano-sized modifiers may be applied to influence the electron transfer event to result in gains in sensitivity, selectivity and versatility of the detection system.

In this study, we further analyzed the obtained drug interaction network by merging drugs into drug categories based on the <b>Anatomical</b> <b>Therapeutic</b> <b>Chemical</b> (ATC) <b>classification.</b> The merged data of drug interactions indicated drug properties that are related to drug interaction mechanisms or symptoms.

40|$|Background: Evidence on the {{comparative}} validity of self-reported medication use in large-scale studies is limited. This study compared self-reported medication use of prescription-only medications to gold standard pharmaceutical claims (i. e. dispensing) data. Methods: We selected {{a random sample}} of 500 participants from the 45 and Up Study, a large-scale Australian study, with complete ascertainment of Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme dispensing records. Self-reported medication use was ascertained by questionnaire requesting data on medications used “for most of the last 4 weeks”. In the dispensing data, we determined exposure to specific medications in the same 4 -week window as the survey response if we observed a dispensing record ≤ 90 days {{before the start of the}} window.

30|$|Carduus marianus, Silybum marianum, or {{milk thistle}} is an edible Mediterranean herbal {{with a very}} long history as {{medicinal}} plant. Probably, this practice was also supported by the religious connotations of its name (e.g. chardon marie, Mariendistel, Saint Mary’s thistle, etc.). The currently employed standardized milk thistle extracts made from the fruits contain 30 – 65  % silymarin as active ingredient. Silymarin is a complex mixture of polyphenolic molecules, including seven closely related flavonolignans, i.e. silibin A, silibin B, isosilibin A, isosilibin B, silichristin, isosilichristin, silidianin and the flavonoid taxifolin, the most effective antioxidant of these molecules [1]. Silymarin administered per os has become a frequently applied therapy for various liver disorders. Silymarin is classified by the WHO <b>Anatomical</b> <b>Therapeutic</b> <b>Chemical</b> (ATC) <b>classification</b> system as liver therapy (A 05 BA 03). Approved indications are described as toxic and inflammatory liver diseases although at low doses it is also recommended for dyspepsia.|$|R

40|$|The <b>Anatomical</b> <b>Therapeutic</b> <b>Chemical</b> (ATC) <b>{{classification}}</b> sys-tem {{is widely}} used in Europe for the classification and coding of drugs. However, ATC is not well integrated with other medication terminologies (e. g., NDF-RT – the National Drug File-Reference Terminology), which hinders the integration of data coded to these two systems. In this work, we propose to map ATC to NDF-RT, via the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), in which several medication terminologies are integrated, including NDF-RT but not ATC. Only half of ATC terms were successfully mapped to the UMLS using automatic lexical techniques, result-ing in very few overlapping drug-class pairs between ATC and NDF-RT. To improve these results, we performed a manual map-ping of cardiovascular ATC and NDF-RT classes, which in-creased the number of common drug-class pairs from 39 to 128. We believe that the discovery of mappings between ATC and NDF-RT classes could be further automated and made more ef-fective by identifying mappings between the drugs in these classes...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} {{the suitability of}} the ATC/DDD Index (<b>Anatomical</b> <b>Therapeutic</b> <b>Chemical</b> (ATC) <b>Classification</b> System/Defined Daily Dose) for analyzing prescription lists in the U. S. Methods: We mapped RxNorm clinical drugs to ATC. We used this mapping to classify a large set of prescription drugs with ATC and compared the prescribed daily dose to the defined daily dose (DDD) in ATC. Results: 64 % of the 11, 422 clinical drugs could be precisely mapped to ATC. 97 % of the 87, 001 RxNorm codes from the prescription dataset could be classified with ATC, and 97 % of the prescribed daily doses could be assessed. Conclusions: Although the mapping of RxNorm ingredients to ATC appears to be largely incomplete, the most frequently prescribed drugs in the prescription dataset we analyzed were covered. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using ATC in conjunction with RxNorm for analyzing U. S. prescription datasets for drug classification and assessment of the prescribed daily doses. 1...|$|R
40|$|Motivation: Different {{resources}} {{exist for}} experimentally determined and computed 3 D-structures of {{low molecular weight}} structures but for approved drugs no free, publicly accessible source of 3 D-structures and conformers is available. Furthermore, for selection purposes or for correlation of structural similarity with medical application the assignment of the <b>Anatomical</b> <b>Therapeutic</b> <b>Chemical</b> (ATC) <b>classification</b> codes to each structure according to the WHO-scheme would be desireable. Results: The database contains about 2, 500 3 D-structures of active ingredients of essential marketed drugs. To account for structural flexibility they are represented by 105 structural conformers. Here we present a web-query system enabling searches for drug name, synonyms, trade name, trivial name, formula, CAS-number, ATC-code etc [...] 2 D-similarity screening (Tanimoto coefficients) and an automatic 3 D-superposition procedure based on conformational representation are implemented.
