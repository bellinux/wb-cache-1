In 2009, The Canadian Counselling Association (CCA) became the Canadian Counselling and Psychotherapy Association (CCPA). Three Canadian provinces require school counseling.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine Latino/a student {{preferences}} for school counselor activities. The primary focus of research was to determine what school counseling activities Latino/a students perceived as important and which school counseling activities Latino/a high school students perceived as satisfying. The researcher pursued this purpose through administration of a survey instrument developed by the researcher. The instrument consisted of 14 demographic items and 42 5 -point Likert scale items based on the domains described in the <b>ASCA’s</b> <b>national</b> <b>model</b> and current literature on experiences of Latino/a adolescents. The sample was comprised of 210 Latino/a high school students from five high schools in three school districts in the suburbs of a large Southwestern U. S. metroplex. The study population consisted of 94 female and 115 male participants ranging in age from 14 to 20 years old with the median age of 17. 54 years. Overall, students preferred school counseling activities focusing on college and career readiness. According to the results of this study, students indicated that although they believed college and career activities to be important, they were not satisfied with how their school counselors provided those activities.

40|$|Students, {{of all the}} {{educational}} stakeholders, are the last {{to have a voice}} in school reform efforts, yet their voices could hold substantial power in how to improve their success in school. Since school counselors are trained in how to engage students in confidential dialogue, school counselors are {{in the best position to}} participate in discussions with students around their perspectives on school reform efforts. The current major school reform effort is the implementation of the Common Core State Standards (CCSS). The main goal of the Common Core State Standards is to help prepare all students for college and career readiness. As recommended by the American School Counselor Association's (<b>ASCA's)</b> <b>National</b> <b>Model,</b> school counselors are encouraged to help students be successful in the three domains of academic, career, and personal/social development. It is utilizing these three domains, the themes, and the framework of the <b>National</b> <b>Model</b> that school counselors can align their programs to the CCSS and help their schools improve in preparing all students for college and career readiness. In order to begin aligning the school counseling program with the goals of the CCSS in the area of preparing students for college at Victoria High School, research was conducted using grounded theory and action research supported by Lewis and Winkelman's (2014) Participatory Inquiry Process (PIP) approach. The research was triangulated through reviewing academic transcripts, conducting student focus groups, and connecting the data to the literature. It was through the student high school transcript review and student focus groups that showed what barriers students were facing and what factors were contributing most to students meeting the California State University (CSU) and University of California (UC) coursework requirements known as the "A-G requirements.

50|$|But school {{counseling}} in the 1980s and early 1990s in the United States was {{not seen as}} a player in educational reform efforts buffeting the educational community. The danger was the profession becoming irrelevant as the standards-based educational movement gained strength in the 1990s with little evidence of systemic effectiveness for school counselors. In response, Campbell & Dahir (1997) consulted widely with school counselors at the elementary, middle, and high school levels and created the <b>ASCA</b> <b>National</b> Standards for School Counseling with three core domains (Academic, Career, Personal/Social), nine standards, and specific competencies and indicators for K-12 students.|$|R

40|$|School {{counseling}} {{has great}} potential {{to help students}} achieve to high standards in the academic, career, and personal/social {{aspects of their lives}} (House 2 ̆ 6 Martin, 1998). With the advent of No Child Left Behind (NCLB, 2001) the role of the school counselor is beginning to change. In response to the challenges and pressures to implement standards-based educational programs, the American School Counselor Association released “The ASCA National Model: A Framework for School Counseling Programs” (ASCA, 2003). The <b>ASCA</b> <b>National</b> <b>Model</b> was designed with an increased focus on both accountability and the use of data to make decisions and to increase student achievement. It is intended to ensure that all students are served by the school counseling program by using student data to advocate for equity, to facilitate student improvement, and to provide strategies for closing the achievement gap. ^ The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the psychometric properties of an instrument designed to assess school districts 2 ̆ 7 readiness to implement the <b>ASCA</b> <b>National</b> <b>Model.</b> Data were gathered from 693 respondents of a web-based version of the <b>ASCA</b> <b>National</b> <b>Model</b> Readiness Self-Assessment Instrument. Confirmatory factor analysis did not support the structure of the 7 -factor model. Exploratory factor analysis produced a 3 -factor model which was supported by confirmatory factor analyses, after creating variable parcels within each of the three factors. Based on the item loadings within each factor, the factors were labeled in the following manner: factor one was labeled School Counselor Characteristics, factor two was labeled District Conditions and factor three was labeled School Counseling Program Supports. Cross-validation of this model with an independent data sample of 363 respondents to the ASCA Readiness Instrument provided additional evidence to support the three factor model. ^ The results of these analyses will be used to give school districts more concise score report information about necessary changes to support implementation of the <b>ASCA</b> <b>National</b> <b>Model.</b> These results provide evidence to support the interpretation of the scores that will be obtained from the ASCA Readiness Instrument. ...|$|E
