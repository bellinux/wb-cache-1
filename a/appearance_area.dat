40|$|Separations {{coupled to}} mass {{spectrometry}} (MS) {{are widely used}} for large-scale protein identification {{in order to reduce}} the adverse effects of analyte ion suppression, increase the dynamic range, and as a deconvolution technique for complex datasets typical of cellular protein complements. In this work, matrix assisted laser desorption-ionization is coupled with ion mobility (IM) separation for the analysis of biological molecules. The utility of liquid-phase separations coupled to MS lies in the orthogonality of the two separation dimensions for all analytes. The data presented in this work illustrates that IM-MS relies on the correlation between separation dimensions for different classes (either structural or chemical) of analyte ions to obtain a useful separation. For example, for a series of peptide ions of increasing mass-to-charge (m/z) a plot drift time in the IM drift cell vs. m/z increases in a near-linear fashion, but DNA or lipids having similar m/z values will have very different IM drift time-m/z relationships, thus drift time vs. m/z can be used as a qualitative tool for compound class identification. In addition, IM-MS is applied to the analysis of large peptide datasets in order to determine the peak capacity of the method for bottom-up experiments in proteomics, and it is found that IM separation increases the peak capacity of an MS-only experiment by a factor of 5 - 10. The population density of the <b>appearance</b> <b>area</b> for peptides is further characterized in terms of the gas-phase structural propensities for tryptic peptide ions. It is found that a small percentage (~ 3 %) of peptide sequences form extended (i. e., helical or &# 946;-sheet type) structures in the gas-phase, thus influencing the overall <b>appearance</b> <b>area</b> for peptide ions. Furthermore, the ability of IM-MS to screen for the presence of phosphopeptides is characterized, and it is found that post translationally modified peptides populate the bottom one-half to one-third of the total <b>appearance</b> <b>area</b> for peptide ions. In general, the data presented in this work indicates that IM-MS offers dynamic range and deconvolution capabilities comparable to liquid-phase separation techniques coupled to MS on a time scale (ms) that is fully compatible to current MS, including TOF-MS, technology...|$|E
30|$|The {{isometric}} vision sensor-based sensing is the non-intrusive {{method for}} motion acquisition. It has shown strong potential application prospects with the developing {{advantages of the}} sensor’s low cost and networking [2, 3]. In order to achieve the recognition and understanding of visual motion, it needs to extract the useful information and feature from the high-dimensional image data. Some representations of the feature, such as the geometric model of the human body, spatial-temporal patterns, <b>appearance,</b> <b>area,</b> contours, and optical flow model, have been demonstrated to be the effective methods [4]. However, {{a large number of}} studies have found that the dimension of the visual image-based feature is high. It will increase the computational complexity of recognition in the information processing and be not suitable for the real-time requirements of systems.|$|E

By using ultrathin frozen sections and immunopurified, monospecific antibodies, both the sensitivity and resolution of the immunocytochemical assay were increased. The results with etiolated plants agree with and extend previously published data. A brief red light illumination caused the redistribution of phytochrome from a diffuse to a more particulate <b>appearance.</b> <b>Areas</b> that accumulated phytochrome were identified as small vacuoles into which phytochrome was sequestered following illumination.

40|$|Anorganic {{preparations}} of {{the distal}} metaphyseal and epiphyseal {{regions of the}} femoral bones from young male rats given 150 ppm fluoride in the drinking water for 10 weeks were examined by scanning electron microscopy. Longitudinal sections of the bones revealed {{an increase in the}} zone of mature hypertrophied cells of the epiphyseal plates as compared with controls. The lacunae in this zone varied considerably in size and shape, and were arranged in irregular nests rather than in parallel rows. Within the cavity of the shaft, the amount of cancellous bone was reduced, particularly in the central areas of the metaphyses where the network of trabeculae was sparsely distributed. The trabeculae located in the more peripheral areas of the metaphyses were broad and heavy in <b>appearance.</b> <b>Areas</b> of fully or partially mineralized bone were markedly reduced. The bone surfaces were rough, irregular and covered with numerous Howship 2 ̆ 7 s lacunae.
