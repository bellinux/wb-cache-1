5|$|Significant discoveries {{relating}} to nitrogen assimilation and metabolism, including ammonification, nitrification and nitrogen fixation (the uptake of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>nitrogen</b> by symbiotic soil microorganisms) {{had to wait}} for advances in chemistry and bacteriology in the late 19th century and this was followed in the early 20th century by the elucidation of protein and amino-acid synthesis and their role in plant metabolism. With this knowledge it was then possible to outline the global nitrogen cycle.|$|E

In this thesis, the <b>atmospheric</b> {{pressure}} <b>nitrogen</b> dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma modified polyproylene (PP) {{melt blown}} non-woven surface wettability are investigated. The change of surfaces {{physical and chemical}} properties are studied by water contact angle measurement and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) before and after plasma treatment. The experimental results indicate the surface hydrophilic can be greatly improved when the PP simples is treated by <b>atmospheric</b> pressure <b>nitrogen</b> DBD plasma for a short time.

5|$|The cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) is {{an annual}} {{herbaceous}} legume from the genus Vigna. Due to its tolerance for sandy soil and low rainfall {{it is an}} important crop in the semi-arid regions across Africa and other countries. It requires very few inputs, as the plants root nodules are able to fix <b>atmospheric</b> <b>nitrogen,</b> making it a valuable crop for resource poor farmers and well-suited to intercropping with other crops. The whole plant is used as forage for animals, with its use as cattle feed likely responsible for its name.|$|E
5|$|Azotobacter can fix {{at least}} 10 μg of {{nitrogen}} per gram of glucose consumed. Nitrogen fixation requires molybdenum ions, {{but they can}} be partially or completely replaced by vanadium ions. If <b>atmospheric</b> <b>nitrogen</b> is not fixed, the source of nitrogen can alternatively be nitrates, ammonium ions, or amino acids. The optimal pH for the growth and nitrogen fixation is 7.0–7.5, but growth is sustained in the pH range from 4.8 to 8.5. Azotobacter can also grow mixotrophically, in a molecular-nitrogen-free medium containing mannose; this growth mode is hydrogen-dependent. Hydrogen is available in the soil, thus this growth mode may occur in nature.|$|E
5|$|Some true fungi specialise in the {{colonisation}} of the Myxogastriae: {{almost all}} of these are species of sac fungi. The most common such fungus is Verticillium rexianummainly species from Comatricha or Stemonitis. Gliocladium album and Sesquicillium microsporum are often found on Physaridae, while Polycephalomyces tomentosus is often found on certain species of Trichiidae. Nectriopsis violacea specialises on Fuligo septica. Bacterial associates, mainly from the family Enterobacteriaceae, were discovered on plasmodia. The combination of plasmodia and bacteria can bind <b>atmospheric</b> <b>nitrogen</b> or produce enzymes which make possible the decomposition of e.g. lignin, carboxymethylcellulose or xylan. In a few cases, the plasmodia acquired salt tolerance or tolerance of heavy metals through this association.|$|E

5|$|Azotobacter is a genus of usually motile, oval or spherical {{bacteria}} that form thick-walled cysts and may produce {{large quantities of}} capsular slime. They are aerobic, free-living soil microbes which {{play an important role}} in the nitrogen cycle in nature, binding <b>atmospheric</b> <b>nitrogen,</b> which is inaccessible to plants, and releasing it in the form of ammonium ions into the soil (nitrogen fixation). In addition to being a model organism for studying diazotrophs, it is used by humans for the production of biofertilizers, food additives, and some biopolymers. The first representative of the genus, Azotobacter chroococcum, was discovered and described in 1901 by the Dutch microbiologist and botanist Martinus Beijerinck. Azotobacter species are Gram-negative bacteria found in neutral and alkaline soils, in water, and in association with some plants.|$|E
5|$|The soils {{in which}} plants grow are {{inhabited}} by microbial communities, with one gram of soil containing around 109-1010 microbial cells which comprise about one gigabase of sequence information. The microbial communities which inhabit soils {{are some of}} the most complex known to science, and remain poorly understood despite their economic importance. Microbial consortia perform a wide variety of ecosystem services necessary for plant growth, including fixing <b>atmospheric</b> <b>nitrogen,</b> nutrient cycling, disease suppression, and sequester iron and other metals. Functional metagenomics strategies are being used to explore the interactions between plants and microbes through cultivation-independent study of these microbial communities. By allowing insights into the role of previously uncultivated or rare community members in nutrient cycling and the promotion of plant growth, metagenomic approaches can contribute to improved disease detection in crops and livestock and the adaptation of enhanced farming practices which improve crop health by harnessing the relationship between microbes and plants.|$|E
5|$|The heavy isotope 15N {{was first}} {{discovered}} by S. M. Naudé in 1929, soon after heavy isotopes of the neighbouring elements oxygen and carbon were discovered. It presents {{one of the}} lowest thermal neutron capture cross-sections of all isotopes. It is frequently used in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to determine the structures of nitrogen-containing molecules, due to its fractional nuclear spin of one-half, which offers advantages for NMR such as narrower line width. 14N, though also theoretically usable, has an integer nuclear spin of one and thus has a quadrupole moment that leads to wider and less useful spectra. 15N NMR nevertheless has complications not encountered in the more 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. The low natural abundance of 15N (0.36%) significantly reduces sensitivity, a problem which is only exacerbated by its low gyromagnetic ratio, (only 10.14% that of 1H). As a result, the signal-to-noise ratio for 1H is about 300 times as much as that for 15N at the same magnetic field strength. This may be somewhat alleviated by isotopic enrichment of 15N by chemical exchange or fractional distillation. 15N-enriched compounds have the advantage that under standard conditions, they do not undergo chemical exchange of their nitrogen atoms with <b>atmospheric</b> <b>nitrogen,</b> unlike compounds with labelled hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen isotopes that must be kept away from the atmosphere. The 15N:14N ratio is commonly used in stable isotope analysis in the fields of geochemistry, hydrology, paleoclimatology and paleoceanography, where it is called δ15N.|$|E

At least 50 molybdenum-containing enzymes are now known in bacteria and animals, though only the bacterial and cyanobacterial enzymes are involved in nitrogen fixation.

25|$|Ammonia {{is both a}} {{metabolic}} {{waste and}} a metabolic input throughout the biosphere. It is {{an important source of}} nitrogen for living systems. Although <b>atmospheric</b> <b>nitrogen</b> abounds (more than 75%), few living creatures are capable of using this <b>atmospheric</b> <b>nitrogen</b> in its diatomic form, N2 gas. Therefore, nitrogen fixation is required for the synthesis of amino acids, which are the building blocks of protein. Some plants rely on ammonia and other nitrogenous wastes incorporated into the soil by decaying matter. Others, such as nitrogen-fixing legumes, benefit from symbiotic relationships with rhizobia that create ammonia from <b>atmospheric</b> <b>nitrogen.</b>|$|E

25|$|Although {{nitrogen}} is plentiful in the Earth's atmosphere, {{very few}} plants {{can use this}} directly.

25|$|Some {{sugarcane}} {{varieties are}} capable of fixing <b>atmospheric</b> <b>nitrogen</b> {{in association with the}} bacterium Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus. Unlike legumes and other nitrogen-fixing plants that form root nodules in the soil in association with bacteria, G. diazotrophicus lives within the intercellular spaces of the sugarcane's stem. Coating seeds with the bacteria is a newly developed technology that can enable every crop species to fix nitrogen for its own use.|$|E

40|$|We {{present results}} from {{transient}} sensitivity studies with the Biogeochemical Elemental Cycling (BEC) ocean model to increasing anthropogenic <b>atmospheric</b> inorganic <b>nitrogen</b> (N) and soluble iron (Fe) deposition over the industrial era. Elevated N deposition results from fossil fuel combustion and agriculture, and elevated soluble Fe deposition results from increased atmospheric processing {{in the presence}} of anthropogenic pollutants and soluble Fe from combustion sources. Simulations with increasing Fe and increasing Fe and N inputs raised simulated marine nitrogen fixation, with the majority of the increase in the subtropical North and South Pacific, and raised primary production and export in the high-nutrient low-chlorophyll (HNLC) regions. Increasing N inputs alone elevated small phytoplankton and diatom production, resulting in increased phosphorus (P) and Fe limitation for diazotrophs, hence reducing nitrogen fixation (∼ 6 %). Globally, the simulated primary production, sinking particulate organic carbon (POC) export. and atmospheric CO 2  uptake were highest under combined increase in Fe and N inputs compared to preindustrial control. Our results suggest that increasing combustion iron sources and aerosol Fe solubility along with <b>atmospheric</b> anthropogenic <b>nitrogen</b> deposition are perturbing marine biogeochemical cycling and could partially explain the observed trend toward increased P limitation at station ALOHA in the subtropical North Pacific. Excess inorganic nitrogen ([NO 3 −] + [NH 4 +] − 16 [PO 4 3 −]) distributions may offer useful insights for understanding changing ocean circulation and biogeochemistry...|$|R
40|$|We {{perform a}} {{sensitivity}} {{study with the}} Biogeochemical Elemental Cycling (BEC) ocean model to understand the impact of <b>atmospheric</b> inorganic <b>nitrogen</b> deposition on marine biogeochemistry and air-sea CO 2  exchange. Simulations involved examining the response to three different <b>atmospheric</b> inorganic <b>nitrogen</b> deposition scenarios namely, Pre-industrial (22 Tg N/year), 1990 s (39 Tg N/year), and an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) prediction for 2100, IPCC-A 1 FI (69 Tg N/year). Globally, the increasing N deposition had widespread, but modest effects on export production and air-sea CO 2  exchange. The maximum increase in N deposition was 47 Tg N/year since Pre-industrial control for the IPCC-A 1 FI case, which had an increase in primary production (0. 98 Gt C/year or 2 %), export production (0. 16 Gt C/year or 3 %) {{and a decrease in}} atmospheric pCO 2  of 1. 66 ppm (0. 6 %) relative to the Pre-industrial control. In some regions, atmospheric N inputs supported > 20 % of the export production in the current era and > 50 % of the export production in the IPCC-A 1 FI case. As nitrogen deposition increased, N fixation decreased because the diazotrophs were outcompeted by diatoms and small phytoplankton under more N-replete conditions. This decrease in N fixation could partially counteract the ongoing increase in new <b>nitrogen</b> inputs via <b>atmospheric</b> N deposition...|$|R
