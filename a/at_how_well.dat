5|$|Lars' {{inclusion}} in Naruto Shipuuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 2 was initially conceived of by CyberConnect2 CEO Hiroshi Matsuyama. In 2009, Matsuyama {{read in a}} Weekly Shōnen Jump magazine that Lars' third costume had been designed by Kishimoto and thought he {{should be included in}} Ultimate Ninja Storm 2. As a result, Matsuyama approached Tekken 6 producer Suguru Sasaki and his team and asked them to include Lars in the game using Kishimoto's outfit. Once this was approved, the Tekken staff started assisting CyberConnect2 to adjust Lars' moves to fit the other characters in the Naruto game. When the work was concluded, Matsuyama was surprised <b>at</b> <b>how</b> <b>well</b> Lars fitted in with the game's cast.|$|E

Hodgkin {{was put in charge}} of getting Bristol to provide an example with the radome fit, but he found that the engineer in charge of the workshop was reluctant to do so. High-level pressure from Dee and others followed, and X7579 was quickly adapted, arriving at Christchurch in September 1941. At the time the Mk. VII consisted {{of a large number of}} fairly large equipment boxes that were entirely unsuitable for production use, and Hodgkin expressed his surprise <b>at</b> <b>how</b> <b>well</b> the work progressed in spite of this.

25|$|Finally, Jude Law {{arrived at}} the very end of shooting, on 2 April, to film the Imaginarium ladders sequence, which now {{required}} more dialogue than originally planned; a key scene in the Imaginarium wagon between Tony and the rest of the cast had been reserved for the Vancouver interior shooting, and so all of the dialogue (and, thus, narrative role of that scene) had to be funnelled into a conversation between Law and Andrew Garfield's characters in the Imaginarium. This conversation proved to be the last sequence shot for the film, and involved a set completely improvised, on the day, to look like the ground at Battersea; they did not have the budget for anything better, but the production crew came away quite impressed <b>at</b> <b>how</b> <b>well</b> it worked.|$|E

500|$|During the {{development}} of the series' pilot chapter, Rurouni, Meiji Swordsman Romantic Story, Watsuki and his editor argued over Kenshin's speech patterns, settling for a [...] "slangy" [...] one. For {{the final version of the}} first Romantic Story, Watsuki adjusted the dialogue; in his view, he made Kenshin sound [...] "more as I prefer him now". Nevertheless, Kenshin was concerned about how Kenshin's manner abruptly changed when facing his opponent. Watsuki added Kenshin's trademark [...] as a placeholder to be an expression of the English speech disfluency [...] "huh". Watsuki notes that he was surprised <b>at</b> <b>how</b> <b>well</b> it caught on, and how much he ended up having Kenshin use the sound during the series. Watsuki also planned to make Kenshin more 30 years old; his editor commented that it was strange that the main character of a manga for teenagers to be of such an age, so he instead made him 28 years old.|$|E
500|$|Subsequent {{military}} science {{studies of}} the use of Rangers during the Korean War have focused on analysing their economy of force by looking <b>at</b> <b>how</b> <b>well</b> the U.S. military employed them as special forces. In an analysis of the operations of all Ranger units in the Korean War, Major Chelsea Y. Chae proposed in a 1996 thesis to the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College that they were misused and ineffective in general, and that in particular the Eighth Army Ranger Company had been poorly employed. Chae noted that the Ranger formations' lack of support personnel made them a logistic and administrative liability, as they had to be attached to conventional units for support. Furthermore, he argued that the Rangers' small formation sizes meant that they lacked the manpower to conduct basic tactical maneuvers, and their employment with divisional elements did not provide them with the intelligence information necessary for effective infiltration operations. He concluded that these problems were due to a [...] "lack of understanding of Ranger capabilities, limitations inherent in Rangers' force structure, and basic distrust of elite forces." ...|$|E

For his next studio effort, his tenth, Beck tapped Danger Mouse to produce, and the two first met in December 2007 to record. The duo knocked out two tracks in two days, but the notion that the album would be finished in a timely fashion soon evaporated. Beck had known Danger Mouse casually before, as many of his former musicians ended up working with Danger Mouse's side project, Gnarls Barkley. Still, the musicians were surprised <b>at</b> <b>how</b> <b>well</b> they got along. Following the grueling recording schedule, Beck was exhausted, calling it [...] "the most intense work I've ever done on anything", relating that he [...] "did at least 10 weeks with no days off, until four or five in the morning every night." [...] Beck's original vision was a short 10-track burst with two-minute songs, but the songs gradually grew as he fit 'two years of songwriting into two and a half months." [...] Modern Guilt (2008) was [...] "full of off-kilter rhythms and left-field breakdowns, with an overall 1960s vibe." ...|$|E

[...] Secret police report that Tuptim is missing. [...] The King realizes that Anna knows something; she parries his inquiry by asking why he should care: Tuptim is just another woman to him. He is delighted; she is at last understanding the Siamese perspective. Anna tries {{to explain to him}} the Western customs of courtship and tells him what it is like for a young woman at a formal dance ("Shall We Dance?"). [...] He demands that she teach him the dance. She does, and in that dance they experience and express a love for each other that they can never speak aloud. They are interrupted by the Kralahome. Tuptim has been captured, and a search is on for Lun Tha. The King resolves to punish Tuptim, though she denies she and Lun Tha were lovers. Anna tries to dissuade him, but he is determined that her influence shall not rule, and he takes the whip himself. He turns to lash Tuptim, but under Anna's gaze is unable to swing the whip, and hurries away. Lun Tha is found dead, and Tuptim is dragged off, swearing to kill herself; nothing more is heard about her. [...] Anna asks the Kralahome to give her ring back to the King; both schoolteacher and minister state their wish that she had never come to Siam.|$|E
500|$|SFX {{magazine}} {{noted that}} when the character was first announced, {{some members of the}} public questioned the morality of featuring such a character in a science fiction action series. In August 2010 a reporter from entertainment website AfterElton also stated to the shows executive producers that some of their readers had been upset and concerned about details of the storyline. Pullman's casting as Danes was announced on 15 December 2010. Prior to his role as Danes, Pullman was best known to audiences for his portrayal of the President of the United States in Independence Day. When Pullman asked executive producer Julie Gardner why the production team sought to cast him in role, she replied that it was because he was perceived as [...] "America's sweetheart", which he interpreted to mean they were looking to destabilise viewers. Torchwoods creator, Russell T Davies, noted that upon expressing an interest in casting [...] Pullman, he was told [...] "you haven't got a chance." [...] Though Pullman was aware of Torchwood, having had a friend who'd [...] "evangelized" [...] the series, he had not watched the series before being cast. Upon reading the scripts, Pullman commented that he had been impressed <b>at</b> <b>how</b> <b>well</b> the series [...] "knows itself" [...] and the strength of each character's individual voice. In an interview with Zap2it he remarked that he thought he was given the best role in the series. Pullman noted that he was prepared for the role having played other troubled characters in the past and re-iterated that it was the writing that attracted him to the part adding [...] "I don't think I could do a child murderer just for a child murderer's sake".|$|E

500|$|In 2011, SFX named [...] "Love & Monsters" [...] {{as one of}} {{the best}} Sci-Fi TV Mockumentaries, saying that it worked as an example of the genre and was not too bad on rewatch. The article noted that criticisms of the episode ranged from [...] "Kay's overacting and the silly Slitheen-esque monster to {{annoyance}} <b>at</b> <b>how,</b> <b>well,</b> lame the members of LINDA are." [...] Louisa Pearson of The Scotsman noted that hardcore fans would dislike the comedy and the [...] "panto" [...] performance of Kay, but commented, [...] "It's true, this episode came close to being a spoof, but it was actually quite nice to have a rest from the Doctor. Even saving the world gets boring sometimes." [...] Arnold T Blumburg of Now Playing gave the episode a grade of D-. He was positive towards the first 30 minutes, which he described as a [...] "touching little tale" [...] with interesting characters, but called the final 10 minutes [...] "juvenile attack on the audience's intelligence and emotions" [...] that ruined the episode with [...] "a laughable monster and offensive humor at exactly the wrong moment". Digital Spy's Dek Hogan criticised Kay's performance, calling the Abzorbaloff [...] "a marvellous idea and it's a pity his creativity was absorbed by a turn from a visiting comedian". In a review of the series, Stephen Brook of The Guardian stated that he [...] "hated" [...] the episode, describing it as a [...] "parody of Doctor Who fans". The scene where Elton says he and Ursula have [...] "a bit of a love life" [...] was criticised by some commentators, who felt that the resultant implication of having oral sex with a paving slab was unsuitable for Doctor Whos large family audience; others, however, dismissed this dialogue as a harmless joke that children would not understand. [...] "Love & Monsters" [...] was placed in 153rd position in Doctor Who Magazine Mighty 200 reader survey in 2009, which ranked every Doctor Who story to that point in order of preference.|$|E

2500|$|After {{releasing}} Soul Edge, Namco {{took some}} time to evaluate what had made the game successful before jumping into the development of its follow-up. Producer Hiroaki Yotoriyama decided to give the sequel a new name instead of just calling it Soul Edge 2 {{in order to have}} a fresh start and take the series in a new direction. The name Soulcalibur is a portmanteau of the word soul (as in Soul Edge) and King Arthur's sword Excalibur (ultimately, the name would be used within the game's universe for the holy weapon which would counteract Soul Edge's evil). Inspired by an internal Namco prototype featuring a character able to run openly in a field, the eight-way run system was implemented. Upon application, the development team was surprised <b>at</b> <b>how</b> <b>well</b> it meshed with their fighting system and decided to build the rest of the game around it.
