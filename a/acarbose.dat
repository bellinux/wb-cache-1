25|$|For {{patients}} with severe risk factors, prescription medication may be appropriate. This {{may be considered}} in patients for whom lifestyle therapy has failed, or is not sustainable, and who are at high-risk for developing type 2 diabetes. Metformin and <b>acarbose</b> help prevent the development of frank diabetes, and also have a good safety profile. Evidence also supports thiazolidinediones but there are safety concerns, and data on newer agents such as GLP-1 receptor agonists, DPP4 inhibitors or meglitinides are lacking.|$|E
50|$|Even {{though the}} drugs {{have a similar}} {{mechanism}} of action, there are subtle differences between <b>acarbose</b> and miglitol. <b>Acarbose</b> is an oligosaccharide, whereas miglitol resembles a monosaccharide. Miglitol is fairly well absorbed by the body, as opposed to <b>acarbose.</b> Moreover, <b>acarbose</b> inhibits pancreatic alpha-amylase in addition to alpha-glucosidase.|$|E
50|$|If {{a patient}} using <b>acarbose</b> {{suffers from a}} bout of hypoglycemia, the patient must eat {{something}} containing monosaccharides, such as glucose tablets or gel (GlucoBurst, Insta-Glucose, Glutose, Level One) and a doctor should be called. Because <b>acarbose</b> blocks the breakdown of table sugar and other complex sugars, fruit juice or starchy foods will not effectively reverse a hypoglycemic episode in a patient taking <b>acarbose.</b>|$|E
50|$|Diabetes: <b>Acarbose,</b> an {{alpha-glucosidase}} inhibitor, competitively and reversibly inhibits alpha-glucosidase in the intestines. This inhibition {{lowers the}} rate of glucose absorption through delayed carbohydrate digestion and extended digestion time. <b>Acarbose</b> may {{have the capability to}} stop developing diabetic symptoms. Hence, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (like <b>acarbose)</b> are used as anti-diabetic drugs in combination with other anti-diabetic drugs. Luteolin {{has been found to be}} a strong inhibitor of alpha-glucosidase. The compound can inhibit the enzyme up to 36% with a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. As of 2016, this substance is being tested in rats, mice and cell culture.|$|E
50|$|<b>Acarbose</b> is a pseudotetrasaccharide {{mimicking}} maltotetraose (a substructure of starch). One of the glucose units {{has been}} replaced by valienamine - a carbasugar, linked to the next carbohydrate by an amine bridge. Another of the glucose units appears as a 6-deoxy variant. <b>Acarbose</b> is an enzyme inhibitor that is used as a drug against type 2 diabetes.|$|E
5000|$|This class {{includes}} <b>acarbose,</b> validamycin, validoxylamine A, salbostatin, cetoniacytone A, pyralomicin 1a, kirkamide ...|$|E
50|$|One {{situation}} where starch {{may be less}} effective than glucose or sucrose is {{when a person is}} taking <b>acarbose.</b> Since <b>acarbose</b> and other alpha-glucosidase inhibitors prevents starch and other sugars from being broken down into monosaccharides that can be absorbed by the body, patients taking these medications should consume monosaccharide-containing foods such as glucose tablets, honey, or juice to reverse hypoglycemia.|$|E
5000|$|Since <b>acarbose</b> {{prevents}} the digestion of complex carbohydrates, the drug {{should be taken}} {{at the start of}} main meals (taken with first bite of meal). Moreover, the amount of complex carbohydrates in the meal will determine the effectiveness of <b>acarbose</b> in decreasing postprandial hyperglycemia. Adults may take doses of 25 mg 3 times daily, increasing to 100 mg 3 times a day.|$|E
50|$|They are {{targeted}} by alpha-glucosidase inhibitors such as <b>acarbose</b> and miglitol to control diabetes mellitus type 2.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are three}} drugs which belong to this class, <b>acarbose,</b> {{miglitol}} and voglibose, of which voglibose is the newest.|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} to <b>acarbose</b> (another alpha-glucosidase inhibitor), miglitol is systemically absorbed; however, {{it is not}} metabolized and is excreted by the kidneys.|$|E
50|$|Two {{randomized}} controlled trials show reduction in gas by subjects taking oral α-GAL. Another study indicates it {{may interfere with}} the diabetic medication <b>acarbose.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Acarbose</b> also blocks {{pancreatic}} alpha-amylase {{in addition to}} inhibiting membrane-bound alpha-glucosidases. Pancreatic alpha-amylase hydrolyzes complex starches to oligosaccharides in the lumen of the small intestine.|$|E
50|$|Valienamine is a C-7 aminocyclitol {{found as}} a {{substructure}} of pseudooligosaccharides {{such as the}} antidiabetic drug <b>acarbose</b> and the antibiotic validamycin. It {{can be found in}} Actinoplanes species.|$|E
50|$|Hepatitis {{has been}} {{reported}} with <b>acarbose</b> use. It usually goes away when the medicine is stopped. Therefore, liver enzymes should be checked before and during use of this medicine.|$|E
50|$|Actinoplanes is a genus in {{the family}} Actinoplanaceae. They have aerial mycelia and spherical, motile spores.Actinoplanes species produce the pharmaceutically {{important}} compounds valienamine (a precursor to the antidiabetic drug <b>acarbose</b> and the antibiotic validamycin), teicoplanin, and ramoplanin.|$|E
50|$|The 3D {{structure}} of the pseudo-tetrasaccharide <b>acarbose</b> complexed with glucoamylase II(471) from Aspergillus awamori var. X100 has been determined to 2.4A resolution. The protein belongs to the mainly alpha class, and contains 19 helices and 9 strands.|$|E
50|$|Currently, {{there are}} no crystal {{structures}} of ntSI in complex with an α-1,6-linked substrate or inhibitor analogue. In order to predict isomaltose binding in sucrase-isomaltase structure, a model was produced by hand. Within the -1 subsite, isomaltose’s non-reducing glucose ring was aligned to that of <b>acarbose.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Acarbose</b> (INN) is an anti-diabetic drug used {{to treat}} {{diabetes}} mellitus type 2 and, in some countries, prediabetes. It is a generic sold in Europe and China as Glucobay (Bayer AG), in North America as Precose (Bayer Pharmaceuticals), and in Canada as Prandase (Bayer AG). It is cheap and popular in China, {{but not in the}} U.S. One physician explains the use in the U.S. is limited because it is not potent enough to justify the side effects of diarrhea and flatulence. However, a recent large study concludes [...] "acarbose is effective, safe and well tolerated in a large cohort of Asian patients with type 2 diabetes." [...] A possible explanation for the differing opinions is an observation that <b>acarbose</b> is significantly more effective in patients eating a relatively high carbohydrate Eastern diet ...|$|E
50|$|Hot water {{extracts}} of {{the stem}} and root of Ludwigia adscendens, {{as well as those}} of the fruit, leaf and stem of Monochoria hastata were found to have lipoxygenase inhibitory activity. Hot water extract prepared from the leaf of Ludwigia adscendens exhibits alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity more potent than that of <b>acarbose.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Acarviosin is a sugar {{composed}} of cyclohexitol {{linked to a}} 4-amino-4,6-dideoxy-D-glucopyranose. Acarviosin {{is part of the}} potent α-amylase inhibitor <b>acarbose</b> and its derivatives. The nitrogen atom binds to α-amylase more tightly than the natural substrate making it more potent than other inhibitors. Several other acarviosin-containing α-amylase inhibitors have been found in microbes including isovalertatins [...] and butytatins [...] from Streptomyces luteogriseus and longer oligosaccharides from Streptomyces coelicoflavus.|$|E
50|$|For {{patients}} with severe risk factors, prescription medication may be appropriate.

50|$|Many {{compounds}} {{are known}} that can act to inhibit {{the action of}} a glycoside hydrolase. Nitrogen-containing, 'sugar-shaped' heterocycles {{have been found in}} nature, including deoxynojirimycin, swainsonine, australine and castanospermine. From these natural templates many other inhibitors have been developed, including isofagomine and deoxygalactonojirimycin, and various unsaturated compounds such as PUGNAc. Inhibitors that are in clinical use include the anti-diabetic drugs <b>acarbose</b> and miglitol, and the antiviral drugs oseltamivir and zanamivir. Some proteins have been found to act as glycoside hydrolase inhibitors.|$|E
50|$|Since <b>acarbose</b> {{prevents}} {{the degradation of}} complex carbohydrates into glucose, some carbohydrate {{will remain in the}} intestine and be delivered to the colon. In the colon, bacteria digest the complex carbohydrates, causing gastrointestinal side-effects such as flatulence (78% of patients) and diarrhea (14% of patients). Since these effects are dose-related, in general it is advised to start with a low dose and gradually increase the dose to the desired amount. One study found that gastrointestinal side effects decreased significantly (from 50% to 15%) over 24 weeks, even on constant dosing.|$|E
50|$|Sedoheptulose 7-{{phosphate}}, a pentose phosphate pathway intermediate, is {{a common}} precursor of C7N aminocyclitol moiety of natural products, such as <b>acarbose,</b> validamycin A, salbostatin, cetoniacytone A, and pyralomicin 1a. 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone synthase (EEVS), one of the sugar phosphate cyclase family enzyme and which is a homolog of 3-dehydroquinate synthase in shikimate pathway, catalyzes {{the formation of a}} common intermediate, 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone from sedoheptulose 7-phosphate. After multiple enzyme reaction steps, which include phosphorylation, epimerization, dehydration, and keto-reduction reactions, valienol, an important core structure is formed which leads to the formation of C7N aminocyclitol containing natural products. In validamycin biosynthesis, the C-N linkage which connect the C7 cyclitol moiety to the other was found to be formed by unprecedented actions of nucleotidyltransferase and glycosyltransferase-like enzymes (which is termed pseudoglycosyltransferase).|$|E
50|$|<b>Acarbose</b> {{inhibits}} enzymes (glycoside hydrolases) {{needed to}} digest carbohydrates, specifically, alpha-glucosidase enzymes {{in the brush}} border of the small intestines, and pancreatic alpha-amylase. Pancreatic alpha-amylase hydrolyzes complex starches to oligosaccharides in the lumen of the small intestine, whereas the membrane-bound intestinal alpha-glucosidases hydrolyze oligosaccharides, trisaccharides, and disaccharides to glucose and other monosaccharides in the small intestine. Inhibition of these enzyme systems reduces the rate of digestion of complex carbohydrates. Less glucose is absorbed because the carbohydrates are not broken down into glucose molecules. In diabetic patients, the short-term effect of these drug therapies is to decrease current blood glucose levels; the long-term effect is a reduction in HbA1c level. This reduction averages an absolute decrease of 0.7%, which is a decrease of about 10% in typical HbA1c values in diabetes studies.|$|E
50|$|Onset of type 2 {{diabetes}} can {{be delayed}} or prevented through proper nutrition and regular exercise. Intensive lifestyle measures may reduce the risk by over half. The benefit of exercise occurs regardless of the person's initial weight or subsequent weight loss. High levels of physical activity {{reduce the risk of}} diabetes by about 28%. Evidence for the benefit of dietary changes alone, however, is limited, with some evidence for a diet high in green leafy vegetables and some for limiting the intake of sugary drinks. In those with impaired glucose tolerance, diet and exercise either alone or in combination with metformin or <b>acarbose</b> may decrease the risk of developing diabetes. Lifestyle interventions are more effective than metformin. While low vitamin D levels are associated with an increased risk of diabetes, correcting the levels by supplementing vitamin D3 does not improve that risk.|$|E
5000|$|Blood glucose can {{be raised}} to normal within minutes by taking (or receiving) 10-20 grams of carbohydrate. It can be taken as food or drink {{if the person is}} {{conscious}} and able to swallow. This amount of carbohydrate is contained in about 3-4 ounces (100-120 ml) of orange, apple, or grape juice although fruit juices contain a higher proportion of fructose which is more slowly metabolized than pure dextrose, alternatively, about 4-5 ounces (120-150 ml) of regular (non-diet) soda may also work, as will about one slice of bread, about 4 crackers, or about 1 serving of most starchy foods. Starch is quickly digested to glucose (unless the person is taking <b>acarbose),</b> but adding fat or protein retards digestion. Symptoms should begin to improve within 5 minutes, though full recovery may take 10-20 minutes. Overfeeding does not speed recovery and if the person has diabetes will simply produce hyperglycemia afterwards. A mnemonic used by the American Diabetes Association and others is the [...] "rule of 15" [...] - consuming 15 grams of carbohydrate followed by a 15-minute wait, repeated if glucose remains low (variable by individual, sometimes 70 mg/dl).|$|E
40|$|In a {{double-blind}} study we have compared {{the effect of}} 50 mg <b>acarbose,</b> 100 mg <b>acarbose,</b> 4. 2 g pectin, a combination of 50 mg <b>acarbose</b> with 4. 2 g pectin, and placebo on plasma glucose, plasma insulin, breath hydrogen and hypoglycaemic symptoms after a normal carbohydrate rich meal in nine patients with previous gastric surgery. Fifty milligrams <b>acarbose,</b> 100 mg <b>acarbose</b> and the combination of 50 mg <b>acarbose</b> with 4. 2 g pectin significantly inhibited the postprandial peak glucose concentration (p less than 0. 01).

40|$|Refractory wound is a dreaded {{complication}} of diabetes and is {{highly correlated with}} EPC dysfunction caused by hyperglycemia. <b>Acarbose</b> is a widely used oral glucose-lowering drug exclusively for T 2 DM. Previous studies have suggested the beneficial effect of <b>acarbose</b> on improving endothelial dysfunction in patients with T 2 DM. However, no data have been reported on the beneficial efficacy of <b>acarbose</b> in wound healing impairment caused by diabetes. We herein investigated whether <b>acarbose</b> could improve wound healing in T 2 DM db/db mice and the possible mechanisms involved. <b>Acarbose</b> hastened wound healing and enhanced angiogenesis, accompanied by increased circulating EPC number in db/db mice. In vitro, a reversed BM-EPC dysfunction was observed after the administration of <b>acarbose</b> in db/db mice, as reflected by tube formation assay. In addition, a significantly increased NO production was also witnessed in BM-EPCs from <b>acarbose</b> treated db/db mice, with decreased O 2 levels. Akt inhibitor could abolish the beneficial effect of <b>acarbose</b> on high glucose induced EPC dysfunction in vitro, accompanied by reduced eNOS activation. <b>Acarbose</b> displayed potential effect in promoting wound healing and improving angiogenesis in T 2 DM mice, which was possibly related to the Akt/eNOS signaling pathway...|$|E
30|$|Ten <b>Acarbose</b> tablets were weighed, and {{the average}} weight was calculated. The tablets were ground into a {{homogeneous}} fine powder in a mortar. Then, 50  mg of <b>acarbose</b> powder was dissolved in 50  mL distilled water to obtain 1  mg/mL of <b>acarbose</b> solution.|$|E
40|$|In this work, we {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} pH on Streptomyces M 37 growth and its <b>acarbose</b> biosynthesis ability. We observed that low pH was beneficial for cell growth, whereas high pH favored <b>acarbose</b> synthesis. Moreover, addition of glucose and maltose to the fermentation medium after 72 h of cultivation promoted <b>acarbose</b> production. Based on these results, a two-stage fermentation strategy was developed to improve <b>acarbose</b> production. Accordingly, pH was kept at 7. 0 during the first 72 h and switched to 8. 0 after that. At the same time, glucose and maltose were fed to increase <b>acarbose</b> accumulation. With this strategy, we achieved an <b>acarbose</b> titer of 6210 mg/L, representing an 85. 7 % increase over traditional batch fermentation without pH control.

40|$|The pseudooligosaccharide <b>acarbose</b> is {{a potent}} {{inhibitor}} of amylases, glucosidases, and cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase and is clinically used {{for the treatment of}} so-called type II or insulin-independent diabetes. The compound consists of an unsaturated aminocyclitol, a deoxyhexose, and a maltose. The unsaturated aminocyclitol moiety (also called valienamine) is primarily responsible for the inhibition of glucosidases. Due to its structural similarity to maltotetraose, we have investigated whether <b>acarbose</b> is recognized as a substrate by the maltose/maltodextrin system of Escherichia coli. <b>Acarbose</b> at millimolar concentrations specifically affected the growth of E. coli K- 12 on maltose as the sole source of carbon and energy. Uptake of radiolabeled maltose was competitively inhibited by <b>acarbose,</b> with a Ki of 1. 1 μM. Maltose-grown cells transported radiolabeled <b>acarbose,</b> indicating that the compound is recognized as a substrate. Studying the interaction of <b>acarbose</b> with purified maltoporin in black lipid membranes revealed that the kinetics of <b>acarbose</b> binding to LamB is asymmetric. The on-rate of <b>acarbose</b> is approximately 30 times lower when the molecule enters the pore from the extracellular side than when it enters from the periplasmic side. <b>Acarbose</b> could not be utilized as a carbon source since the compound alone was not a substrate of amylomaltase (MalQ) and was only poorly attacked by maltodextrin glucosidase (MalZ) ...|$|E
