5|$|Case Closed was {{conceived}} in 1994, during {{the rise of}} mystery genre manga due to the publishing of the Kindaichi Case Files series; the first chapter appeared in Shogakukan's Weekly Shōnen Sunday on January 19. Aoyama cites the stories of Arsène Lupin, Sherlock Holmes and the samurai films by Akira Kurosawa as influences on his work. When scripting each chapter, he ensures the dialogue remains simple and spends an average of four hours for each new case and twelve for more complicated ones. Each case spans several chapters (except {{for a handful of}} shorter cases that only span one), and is resolved at the end where characters explain the details of their solutions in simple terms; a database consisting of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> from the manga was launched in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Shastri's assurances {{calmed down}} the {{volatile}} situation. On 12 February, the students council postponed the agitation indefinitely and on 16 February, C. Subramaniam and O. V. Alagesan withdrew their resignations. Sporadic acts of protests and violence continued to happen throughout February and early March. On 7 March, the administration withdrew <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> {{filed against the}} student leaders and on 14 March, the Anti-Hindi imposition Agitation Council dropped the agitation. Shastri's climbdown angered the pro-Hindi activists in North India. Members of Jan Sangh went about the streets of New Delhi, blackening out English signs with tar. The agitation slowly changed into a general anti-Congress organisation. In the 1967 election, student leader P. Seenivasan contested against Kamaraj in the Virudhunagar constituency. A large number of students {{from all over the}} state campaigned for him and ensured his victory: the Congress party was defeated and DMK came to power {{for the first time in}} Madras State.|$|E

5|$|The {{powers of}} the OSC derive from the Oregon Constitution’s Article VII. Like other supreme courts in the United States, the Oregon Supreme Court acts {{primarily}} as a court of appeals. They choose cases that are of legal significance or to unify lower court decisions. In this aspect the court has discretionary review over many of the cases appealed to the high court. Discretionary review allows the court to choose which cases it will hear on appeal. With those cases that are denied {{an appeal to the}} Supreme Court, the decision of the lower court becomes final and binding. As of 1995, the court only accepted one in eight appeals that were discretionary. The justices meet once per week in a formal conference in which only the justices are involved to determine rulings. Once a case is accepted, the court hears the case en banc. That is the court is not divided into panels, and instead all justices participate in <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases,</b> unless a justice recuses themselves due to a conflict of interest or other concern.|$|E

25|$|It is {{a curious}} fact that amaurotic family idiocy, a rare and fatal disease of children, occurs mostly among Jews. The largest number of cases has been {{observed}} in the United States—over thirty in number. It was at first {{thought that this was}} an exclusively Jewish disease because most of the cases at first reported were between Russian and Polish Jews; but recently there have been reported cases occurring in non-Jewish children. The chief characteristics of the disease are progressive mental and physical enfeeblement; weakness and paralysis of all the extremities; and marasmus, associated with symmetrical changes in the macula lutea. On investigation of the reported cases, they found that neither consanguinity nor syphilitic, alcoholic, or nervous antecedents in the family history are factors in the etiology of the disease. No preventive measures have as yet been discovered, and no treatment has been of benefit, <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> having terminated fatally.|$|E

He adds that he was having a final look to try and understand the fundamental reasons why his approach could not be made to work, when he had a sudden insight that the specific reason why the Kolyvagin–Flach approach would not work directly also meant that his original attempts using Iwasawa theory could be made to work, if he strengthened it using his experience gained from the Kolyvagin–Flach approach. Fixing one approach with tools from the other approach would resolve the issue for <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> that were not already proven by his refereed paper. He described later that Iwasawa theory and the Kolyvagin–Flach approach were each inadequate on their own, but together they could be made powerful enough to overcome this final hurdle.|$|E
25|$|Chamber of Acknowledgment of Truth, Responsibility and {{establishment}} {{of facts and}} conducts (Sala de Reconocimiento de Verdad y Responsabilidad y de Determinación de los Hechos y Conductas): The chamber would be the organizer of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> received by the jurisdiction, filtering cases {{to concentrate on the}} most serious and representative crimes not eligible for amnesty. It would receive reports from the Attorney General, Inspector General, Comptroller General, the military criminal justice system, victims' organizations, human rights organizations as well as any relevant legal investigations and judgments. Having determined whether the cases received fall under the JEP's jurisdiction, it would group the reports by alleged/convicted perpetrator and similar conducts and present reports on practices or events, identifying all responsible and their shares of responsibility. On the basis of these reports, those individuals identified would acknowledge or deny their responsibility, individually or collectively. The Chamber would present a resolution of conclusions to the Peace Tribunal, with emphasis on the most serious and representative crimes, individualization of responsibilities, acknowledgements of responsibility and the identification of the appropriate sanctions. In cases without acknowledgement of responsibility, the Chamber would transmit the cases to the Investigation and Prosecution Unit for it to begin proceedings as appropriate. The Chamber would have considerable autonomy to manage its own affairs, set its rules, form working commissions, establish priorities, adopt criteria for selection and decongestion or define the sequence in which cases would be addressed.|$|E

500|$|Shortly {{after taking}} power, the Rwandan {{government}} began prosecuting crimes committed during the genocide. The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, operating under a United Nations mandate, {{was set up}} in Arusha to judge the most senior leaders responsible for the genocide. In addition, the Rwandan government determined to prosecute all suspected perpetrators, including the many ordinary citizens who had taken part in the killings, in order to end the [...] "culture of impunity" [...] that it blamed for the genocide.
