2500|$|Direct-field {{acoustic}} testing, or DFAT, is {{a technique}} used for acoustic testing of <b>aerospace</b> <b>structures</b> by subjecting them to sound waves created by an array of acoustic drivers. The method uses electro-dynamic acoustic speakers, arranged around the test article to provide a uniform, well-controlled, direct sound field at {{the surface of the}} unit under test. The system employs high capability acoustic drivers, powerful audio amplifiers, a narrow-band multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) controller and precision laboratory microphones to produce an acoustic environment that can simulate a helicopter, aircraft, jet engine or launch vehicle sound pressure field. A high level system is capable of overall sound pressure levels in the 125–147dB for more than one minute over a frequency range from 25Hz to 10kHz.|$|E

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Collisions with aerial objects, e. g. bird strikes, {{pose a threat}} to {{aircraft}} in flight. In conventional aircraft, the pilot(s) would typically be aware of any significant collision through control response, noise, or visual indicators, and can fulfil the regulatory requirement of reporting the incident. In a UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle), there is a requirement to automate these functions. The aim of the work detailed in this paper is to demonstrate that acoustic emission sensing equipment developed in the laboratory, and described in previous literature, {{can also be used to}} detect impacts on a large scale <b>aerospace</b> <b>structure.</b> The test structure for this work is a BAE Systems HERTI (High Endurance Rapid Technology Insertion) UAV. Simulated bird strike impacts are performed along the leading edge. Measurements are transmitted from sensors mounted on the wing to a processing system that deduces the location and energy of the impact by comparing the range of acoustic signatures. It is shown that the use of an array of 3 sensors enables repeatable detection and location of low energy impacts, demonstrating that acoustic detection of impacts is possible on a representative <b>aerospace</b> <b>structure...</b>|$|R
