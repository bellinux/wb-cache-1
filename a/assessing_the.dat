5|$|Fleiss' kappa (named after Joseph L. Fleiss) is a {{statistical}} measure for <b>assessing</b> <b>the</b> reliability of agreement between a fixed number of raters when assigning categorical ratings {{to a number}} of items or classifying items. This contrasts with other kappas such as Cohen's kappa, which only work when <b>assessing</b> <b>the</b> agreement between not more than two raters or the interrater reliability for one appraiser versus themself. The measure calculates the degree of agreement in classification over that which would be expected by chance. There is no generally agreed-upon measure of significance, although guidelines have been given.|$|E

5|$|Climate is the {{statistics}} of weather {{over long periods}} of time. It is measured by <b>assessing</b> <b>the</b> patterns of variation in temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, precipitation, atmospheric particle count and other meteorological variables in a given region {{over long periods of}} time. Climate differs from weather, in that weather only describes the short-term conditions of these variables in a given region.|$|E
5|$|Historian Brian Jones concludes in The Emperor Domitian that <b>assessing</b> <b>the</b> true {{nature of}} Domitian's {{personality}} is inherently {{complicated by the}} bias of the surviving sources. Common threads nonetheless emerge from the available evidence. He appears to have lacked the natural charisma of his brother and father. He was prone to suspicion, displayed an odd, sometimes self-deprecating sense of humour, and often communicated in cryptic ways.|$|E

5|$|In <b>assessing</b> <b>the</b> work of Tkach, {{there are}} two points of view. The critics of Tkach, {{especially}} those who formed the splinter churches, see Tkach as the key person responsible for {{the collapse of the}} WCG. They believe that the changes he brought were a turn against God and say his rejection of Armstrong's unique doctrines were, at best, without biblical foundation.|$|E

5|$|The Liaison Office interviewed European refugee {{scientists}} and studied German physics journals. It compiled lists of German scientists {{of interest and}} possible locations of nuclear research and industrial facilities, and the mining and stockpiling of uranium and thorium ores. Little thorium was available in Germany or German-occupied Europe, and attention soon centered on the mines at Joachimsthal in Sudetenland (the German-annexed part of Czechoslovakia). Aerial reconnaissance was carried out periodically, and production was measured by <b>assessing</b> <b>the</b> size of the piles of tailings.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of the TgPVR mouse has {{had a profound effect}} on oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) production. Previously, monitoring the safety of OPV had to be performed using monkeys, because only primates are susceptible to the virus. In 1999, the World Health Organization approved the use of the TgPVR mouse as an alternative method of <b>assessing</b> <b>the</b> effectiveness of the vaccine against poliovirus type-3. In 2000, the mouse model was approved for tests of vaccines against type-1 and type-2 poliovirus.|$|E
5|$|The {{volcanic}} explosivity index (commonly shortened to VEI) is a scale, from 0 to 8, {{for measuring}} the strength of eruptions. It {{is used by the}} Smithsonian Institution's Global Volcanism Program in <b>assessing</b> <b>the</b> impact of historic and prehistoric lava flows. It operates in a way similar to the Richter scale for earthquakes, in that each interval in value represents a tenfold increasing in magnitude (it is logarithmic). The vast majority of volcanic eruptions are of VEIs between 0 and 2.|$|E

5|$|Urban renewal {{programs}} are funded {{in part by}} federal grants. The National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, which created the NRHP, requires that federal agencies give consideration to the opinions of the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation in <b>assessing</b> <b>the</b> impact their actions will have on listed properties and consider alternatives to any action that would destroy or significantly affect them. The listings of downtown Troy's districts and buildings therefore had the practical effect of preventing their demolition for urban renewal.|$|E
5|$|After <b>assessing</b> <b>the</b> devastation in Florida and Louisiana, U.S. President George H. W. Bush {{initially}} {{proposed a}} $7.1billion aid package to provide disaster benefits, small-business loans, agricultural recovery, food stamps, and public housing {{for victims of}} Hurricane Andrew. After the House of Representatives appropriated aid to victims of Hurricane Iniki in Hawaii and Typhoon Omar in Guam, the cost was later increased to $11.1billion. The bill, which was the most costly disaster aid package at the time, was passed by Congress as House Resolution5620 on September18, and {{signed into law by}} President Bush on September23. The state of Florida alone received $9billion through the disaster relief bill.|$|E

She sailed for Cardiff, {{becoming the first}} ship depending only on pulverized coal to cross the Atlantic, and back to Baltimore on 18 August. Early results showed {{that in addition to}} making the transatlantic crossings about 10% faster than she had before, West Alsek used about 30% less coal during the voyage. West Alsek continued to be a test platform for <b>assessing</b> <b>the</b> pulverized coal system during a voyage to Glasgow, her second for the Oriole Line.|$|E

5|$|But, after <b>assessing</b> <b>the</b> {{situation}} in Alsace, Julian evidently decided that his force was insufficient to prevail over the Alamanni alone. Instead, {{he set out}} to recover Cologne. From Metz, he led his army via Treviri (Trier) to Roman-held Koblenz and thence along the Rhine to Cologne. Entering the ruined city unopposed, Julian's men were set to work to rebuild the city walls. Julian then concluded a peace treaty with the Franks. This had the important result of removing half the opposition from the equation and allowing Julian to focus his resources on dealing with the Alamanni.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, James Dahlgren {{and colleagues}} {{published}} a small-sample pilot study <b>assessing</b> <b>the</b> project. Dahlgren {{is a doctor}} who promotes the Purification Rundown {{as a method of}} detoxification. The study claimed to find evidence both of elevated levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) in the rescue workers and improvement during the regime. Two scientists from Cambridge Environmental, Inc. published a thorough critique of the study. They questioned the premise that WTC rescue workers needed detoxification, citing studies that had found that their blood concentration of toxins was no greater than normal.|$|E
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) is the {{organisation}} responsible for <b>assessing</b> <b>the</b> conservation status of species. A species is assessed as subject to varying levels of threat {{if it has a}} small, fragmented or declining range, or if the total population is less than 10,000 mature individuals, or if numbers have dropped rapidly (by more than 10% in ten years or three generations). None of the three Delichon species meets these criteria, and three genus house martins are therefore considered of least concern.|$|E
