5|$|A {{legal issue}} must be {{justiciable}} before the High Court will grant an applicant leave {{to apply for}} judicial review. Justiciability recognizes the limited capabilities of the courts.

The doctrine is based on <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the separation of powers and the need to find the right constitutional balance between the courts and the executive.

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the ideas that win out in {{economics}} are not necessarily those that a representative researcher would choose, but are rather the emergent result of the competition of ideas in which system replicator dynamics dominate. This means that those ideas that fit the analytic technology available to researchers at the time dominate, while “better” ideas that do not offer advancement to researchers lose out. This paper spells out that view. It differentiates <b>a</b> consumer’s <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> theory from <b>a</b> producer’s <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> theory, and argues that <b>a</b> consumer’s <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> theory is often better suited to applied policy than is <b>a</b> producer’s <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> theory. Because the replicator dynamics of the economics profession does not reward people for acquiring <b>a</b> consumer’s <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> theory, that <b>understanding</b> is often neglected. Heterodox economists often have <b>a</b> better consumer’s <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> theory than do mainstream economists but {{because they do not}} prepare students to be successful in economic institutional environment, their views do not receive the hearing they should in the profession. The paper offers a number of suggestions for heterodox European macro economists for competing and shaping the economic institutional environment. ...|$|R
