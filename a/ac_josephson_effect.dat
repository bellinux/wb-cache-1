5000|$|Although the <b>ac</b> <b>Josephson</b> <b>effect</b> {{provides}} {{a much more}} stable voltage reference than Weston cells, the first single-junction Josephson standards [...] were difficult to use because they generated very small voltages (1-10 mV). Several {{attempts were made to}} raise the voltage by connecting two or more junctions in series. The most ambitious of theseused 20 junctions in series to realize a voltage of 100 mV with an uncertainty of a few parts in 109. Ensuring that every junction was on a constant voltage step required individually adjusting the bias current to each of the 20 junctions. The difficulty of this procedure makes arrays of significantly more than 20 junctions impractical.

These steps have become known as zero-crossing steps because they cross the zero-current axis of the I-V curve. The lack of stable regions between the first few steps means that for small dc bias currents, the junction voltage must be quantized. With a common bias current at or near zero, the voltage across a large array of these junctions must also be quantized. The possibility of obtaining constant-voltage steps at zero current over a wide range of junction and operating parameters suggested the possibility of building a voltage standard using large arrays of junctions.|$|E

The uncertainty of these measurements was limited by {{the uncertainty of the}} SI volt realization and the stability of the Weston cells. [...] The stability of the Josephson volt depends only on the stability of [...] (which can easily be a part in 1012), and is at least four orders of magnitude better than the stability of Weston cells.

The assigned value is based on a weighted average of volt realization measurements made prior to 1990 at many national measurement institutions. The uncertainty in [...] is 0.4 ppm. Standards such as the Josephson volt that depend on fundamental constants rather than physical artifacts are known as intrinsic standards. Although the Josephson voltage standard (JVS) does not realize the SI definition of the volt, it provides a very stable reference voltage that can be reproduced anywhere without the need to transfer artifacts such as Weston cells. The accuracy of the Josephson voltage-frequency relation , and its independence from experimental conditions, such as bias current, temperature, and junction materials, have been subjected to many tests. No significant deviation from this relation has ever been found. In the most precise of these experiments, two Josephson devices are driven by the same frequency source, biased on the same step, and connected in a series opposition loop across a small inductor. Since this loop is entirely superconductive, any voltage difference leads to a changing magnetic field in the inductor. This field is detected with a SQUID magnetometer and its constancy has set an upper limit on the voltage difference of less than 3 parts in 1019. Figure 2 is a semilog plot that illustrates how typical differences in dc voltage measurements among National Measurement Institutes (NMIs) have decreased over the last 70 years. The two major improvements coincide with the introduction of single-junction Josephson standards in the early 1970s and the introduction of series-array Josephson standards beginning in 1984.|$|E

These improvements included a newly optimised photolithography process, the incorporation of a three-gridded extraction system into the in-house argon ion mill as well as alterations to the Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD) system to improve thin film quality.
