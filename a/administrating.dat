5|$|Some {{survivors}} of Hurricane Liza {{complained that they}} had only received one ration {{of food and water}} within 3 days of the passage of Liza. Subsequently, armed troops guarded gangs of looters that damaged additional homes. An effort was made to cure people who were suffering from sickness, but by midday on October3, after treating more than 5,000persons, the effort had been halted {{due to a lack of}} sterile cotton vital for <b>administrating</b> the shots.

5|$|The treaty only allows {{taxation}} to {{the extent}} that it covers the cost of <b>administrating</b> the archipelago and covering the services provided to the residents. The tax rate is therefore significantly lower than in Metropolitan Norway, including the absence of value added tax. The government summarizes its expenses on Svalbard in the Svalbard Budget. The taxation rules made Svalbard a tax paradise, and in 2009 the oil rig operator Seadrill established a subsidiary in Longyearbyen to exploit the lower taxes. In 2011, the tax rate for profits exceeding NOK10 million were raised from 16 to 28 percent—the same as on the mainland.|$|E
5|$|James A. Seddon {{resigned}} {{his position}} as the Confederate Secretary of War on January 19, 1865. On February 6, Davis appointed Breckinridge to the vacant position, partially to quiet growing opposition to his administration. Initially opposed by {{several members of the}} Confederate Congress because he had waited to join the Confederacy, he eventually gained their support by <b>administrating</b> his office more efficiently than his predecessors. With their support, he was able to expand the post's influence to include making officer assignments and promotion recommendations and advising field generals regarding strategy. His first act as secretary was to promote Robert E. Lee to general-in-chief of all Confederate forces. After Lee reported a critical shortage of food, clothing, and supplies among his troops, Breckinridge recommended the removal of Lucius B. Northrop, the Confederate commissary general. Northrop's successor, Isaac M. St. John, improved the flow of supplies to troops in the field.|$|E

Therefore, the world around the Tower <b>administrated</b> by Eoria is called [...] "Sol Ciel", the world around the Tower <b>administrated</b> by Frelia is called [...] "Metafalss" [...] and finally, the world around the Tower <b>administrated</b> by Tyria is called [...] "Sol Cluster".|$|R
5|$|Neville {{was present}} at the Council of Clarendon, where he was among the king's followers. Neville was one of the {{witnesses}} to the Constitutions of Clarendon, which came out of the Council. In 1166 he was named chief forester of the royal forests, an office that was responsible for the royal officials in charge of <b>administrating</b> the forests as well as the system of royal courts that enforced the forest law. Neville headed the royal efforts to enforce the forest law, which banned cutting down timber, clearing new farm fields, poaching, or the creation of enclosures within the royal forest. Any offences against the forest law were subject to monetary fines, which were an important source of royal revenue. The royal forest included not only the forests owned by the king, but also many forests on lands held by other persons. After Neville's appointment as chief forester, {{he was in charge of}} hearing offences against the forest law and also imposing punishments. His activities were resented by the people subject to forest law.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{mention of}} the manor was in 1601. King Gustav Adolf II of Sweden gave it to his secretary, Johan Adler Salvius, in 1628. In 1642, its ownership passed on to Hans Detterman Cronman (c.1600-c.1645). In 1753, it was purchased by the Stackelbergs and inherited by the Nolckens in 1870. Baron Arved George de Nolcken (1845–1909) rebuilt the castle between 1876–1885 according to his own designs, in the Scottish baronial style, designed as a smaller version of Queen Victoria's Balmoral Castle in Scotland, which he had visited in 1875. After nationalization occurred in 1919, the castle complex {{was taken over by}} the government under the Ministry of Agriculture and became a school, cavalry barracks, state controlled farm land, council offices, cinema and library. It has been fully refurbished to its original form based on the original pictures of the aristocracy and their descendants who resided here. After the 2011 restoration, the castle was opened to the public with the Alatskivi Castle Foundation <b>administrating</b> the castle and the manor complex.|$|E
5|$|Organisationally, {{the commune}} of Pichilemu has a mayor–council form of government. This {{provides}} for a commune-wide elected mayor serving in an executive role, {{as well as a}} city council serving in a legislative role. The mayor, as the highest authority of the commune of Pichilemu, has the responsibility to direct, manage and supervise the work of the municipality, and legally represents the commune. The mayor is also responsible for <b>administrating</b> the commune's financial resources, and municipal and national goods of public use, presides the local city council, and has the power to delegate his work to other functionaries of the local government, which he may appoint. Additionally, the mayor may give a public account of his gesture to the city council every year, usually in April; an extract of his account may be published to the community. If the mayor dies in office, resigns, or is unable to carry out his/her duties, a councilor may be elected by the city council to replace the former mayor. In the meantime, the municipal secretary may take office as acting mayor. This has happened several times in Pichilemu: following the resignation of René Maturana Maldonado in April 1992, municipal secretary Gustavo Parraguez Galarce took over his office since, at the time, there were no councilors; in November 1998, mayor Jorge Vargas González was convicted of illegally giving a driver's license, and the city council chose councilor Carlos Leyton Labarca until Vargas González resumed his duties in November 1999.|$|E
