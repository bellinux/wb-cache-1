30|$|The {{problem of}} {{dwelling}} {{time for a}} vehicle in a station has already been described: higher boarding and <b>alighting</b> flows lengthen dwelling time, thereby increasing cycle time, reducing service frequency and in turn increasing the flow of passengers boarding and <b>alighting</b> per vehicle.|$|R
5|$|Many dragonflies, {{particularly}} males, are territorial. Some {{defend a}} territory against others {{of their own}} species, some against other species of dragonfly and a few against insects in unrelated groups. A particular perch may give a dragonfly a good view over an insect-rich feeding ground, and the blue dasher (Pachydiplax longipennis) jostles other dragonflies to maintain the right to <b>alight</b> there.|$|E
5|$|A CNN film crew, {{who were}} there on a routine check for a {{possible}} Falun Gong protest, observed a man sitting down on the pavement northeast of the Monument to the People's Heroes at {{the centre of the}} square. He proceeded to pour gasoline over himself and set himself ablaze. Police officers quickly congregated on the scene and extinguished the flames. Shortly afterwards, another four people on the square set themselves <b>alight.</b> One of the four, a man, was detained and driven away in a police van.|$|E
5|$|Pyrrhus {{failed to}} breach the Lacedaimonian defences and when night fell, he withdrew {{back to his}} camp. According to Plutarch, Pyrrhus {{received}} an omen during the night. As he slept, he dreamt of Sparta being smitten and set <b>alight</b> by thunderbolts coming from his own hand. While Pyrrhus {{and most of his}} counsellors interpreted the dream as indicating that they would seize Sparta by storm, his friend Lysimachus warned him that places struck by thunderbolts were usually avoided and that Pyrrhus was destined not to enter Sparta. Pyrrhus dismissed this interpretation and buoyed by what he deemed to be a portentous sign, he prepared his men for a further assault.|$|E

5|$|Saari {{initially}} {{opened fire}} {{on a group of}} students taking a business studies exam, and entered at least one other classroom. According to the three students who were able to escape from the exam room (there were roughly 20 students taking the exam), Saari had approached his victims individually before shooting them. It was also said that he was revelling in the situation and was acting very aggressively. Saari encountered little resistance, and the massacre was concluded relatively quickly. He then covered the classroom in a flammable liquid, believed to be petrol, and set the room <b>alight.</b>|$|E
5|$|Scully {{discusses}} {{her research}} with Mulder, suspecting that L'Ively is the arsonist; this {{is confirmed by}} a police sketch taken from the witness' description. Upon reaching the Marsdens' house, Mulder and Scully find the driver's charred body in the bathroom before the second floor bursts into flames. Mulder faces his phobia {{and is able to}} save the Marsden children. Scully holds L'Ively at gunpoint, but is forced to hold her fire when L'Ively informs her of the rocket fuel he has painted on the house. However, Green throws a can of rocket fuel in his face, causing him to lose control and set himself <b>alight</b> outside.|$|E

For 25 minutes the staff inside the palace initially panicked and then tried to deal with the blaze, but they did not call for assistance, or alert staff at the House of Commons, {{at the other end of}} the palace complex.|$|E

40|$|A {{research}} was conducted to study the factors affecting the <b>alighting</b> and boarding rate of passengers and establish a prediction model for <b>alighting</b> and boarding time of passengers for a passenger rail service in Malaysia. Data was collected at the KL Sentral LRT station during the morning and evening peak hours {{for a period of}} 5 working days. Results show that passenger behaviour, passenger volume, crowdedness in train and mixture of flow has significant effects on the <b>alighting</b> and boarding time though mixture of flow is not significant in the prediction model produced due to the passenger behaviour at the platform...|$|R
5|$|Adolf Hitler was a German {{politician}} {{who was the}} leader of the Nazi Party, Chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945, and Führer ("Leader") of Nazi Germany from 1934 to 1945. He killed himself by gunshot on 30 April 1945 in his Führerbunker in Berlin. Eva Braun, his wife of one day, committed suicide with him by taking cyanide. In accordance with Hitler's prior instructions, that afternoon their remains were carried up the stairs through the bunker's emergency exit, doused in petrol, and set <b>alight</b> in the Reich Chancellery garden outside the bunker. Records in the Soviet archives show that their burnt remains were recovered and interred in successive locations until 1970, when they were again exhumed, cremated, and the ashes scattered.|$|E
5|$|After Einarr {{had settled}} in Orkney two of Harald Finehair's unruly sons, Halvdan Hålegg (English: Hálfdan Longlegs) and Gudrød Ljome (English: Gudrod the Gleaming), killed Einarr's father Rognvald by {{trapping}} him in his house and setting it <b>alight.</b> Gudrød took possession of Rognvald's lands while Hálfdan sailed westwards to Orkney and then displaced Einarr. The sagas say that King Harald, apparently appalled by his sons' actions, overthrew Gudrød and restored Rognvald's lands to his son, Thorir. From a base in Caithness on the Scottish mainland Einarr resisted Hálfdan's occupation of the islands. After winning a battle at sea, and a ruthless campaign on land, Einarr spied Hálfdan hiding on North Ronaldsay. The sagas claim that Hálfdan was captured, and sacrificed to Odin as a blood eagle.|$|E
5|$|After many hardships - {{including}} {{being pursued}} by four Indios who try their best to leave them stranded or dead - Tintin, Haddock, and Zorrino reach the Temple of the Sun, finding {{it to be a}} surviving outpost of the Inca civilisation. They are brought before the Prince of the Sun, flanked by Chiquito and Huascar, the mysterious man Tintin encountered in Jauga. Zorrino is saved from harm when Tintin gives him Huascar's medallion, but Tintin and Haddock are sentenced to death by the Inca prince for their sacrilegious intrusion. The prince tells them they may choose the hour that Pachacamac, the Sun god, will set <b>alight</b> the pyre on which they will be executed.|$|E

5|$|After {{publishing}} the book, Hergé {{learned that there}} had actually been an Admiral Haddock who {{had served in the}} British Royal Navy during the late 17th and early 18th centuries: Sir Richard Haddock (1629–1715). Richard Haddock {{was in charge of the}} Royal James, the flagship of the Earl of Sandwich during the Battle of Solebay of 1672, the first naval battle of the Third Anglo-Dutch War. During the fighting, the Royal James was set <b>alight</b> and Haddock escaped but had to be rescued from the sea, following which his bravery was recognised by the British monarch, King Charles II. He subsequently took command of another ship, the Royal Charles, before becoming a naval administrator in later life. Admiral Haddock's grandfather, also named Richard, commanded the ship of the line HMS Unicorn during the reign of King Charles I.|$|E
5|$|From 1915 onwards the MTT had {{to compete}} against {{unregulated}} private buses, often preceding the trams on the same route to steal fares, which the MTT countered by opening their own motor bus routes from 1925. The South Australian government began regulating buses within the state in 1927, although some private operators used {{a provision in the}} Australian constitution to their advantage. By notionally marking each ticket as a fare from the pickup point to Murrayville, Victoria (but allowing passengers to board or <b>alight</b> sooner) companies avoided having to abide by the regulation for some time. Up until the end of World War I, most Adelaideans were dependent on public transport for daily journeys. The introduction of private automobiles decreased passenger numbers until petrol rationing during World War II led to a resurgence in patronage; patronage remained higher than before the war, until rationing was discontinued in 1951.|$|E
5|$|Hotham and Osborn {{discussed}} {{the situation and}} determined to destroy the wreck to deny it to the French. To this end, three cutters were gathered and a boarding party under Lieutenant Edward Grey sent in to attack Preneuse at 20:00. This party came under fire from the batteries but was able to successfully access the battered French frigate at 21:00, finding that only the officers {{and a handful of}} sailors remained, the others having been given the opportunity to escape to the shore in boats rather than become prisoners of war. Among the captives was Lhermitte, who was permitted to bring his personal baggage with him before he was brought to the British squadron as a prisoner. Grey then set the wrecked ship <b>alight</b> before returning to Adamant, having executed his orders without losing a single man.|$|E

5|$|If {{forced to}} assault a castle, {{there were many}} options {{available}} to the attackers. For wooden structures, such as early motte-and-baileys, fire was a real threat and attempts would be made to set them <b>alight</b> {{as can be seen}} in the Bayeux Tapestry. Projectile weapons had been used since antiquity and the mangonel and petraria– from Roman and Eastern origins respectively– were the main two that were used into the Middle Ages. The trebuchet, which probably evolved from the petraria in the 13thcentury, was the most effective siege weapon before the development of cannons. These weapons were vulnerable to fire from the castle as they had a short range and were large machines. Conversely, weapons such as trebuchets could be fired from within the castle due to the high trajectory of its projectile, and would be protected from direct fire by the curtain walls.|$|E
5|$|In October 1960, {{the group}} left Koschmider's club {{to work at}} the Top Ten Club, which Peter Eckhorn ran, as he offered the group more money and a {{slightly}} better place to sleep. In doing so they broke their contract with Koschmider. When Best and McCartney went back to the Bambi Kino to retrieve their belongings they found it in almost total darkness. As a snub to Koschmider, McCartney found a condom, attached it to a nail on the concrete wall of the room, and set it <b>alight.</b> There was no real damage done, but Koschmider reported them both for attempted arson. Best and McCartney spent three hours in a local prison and were subsequently deported, as was George Harrison, for working under the legal age limit, on 30 November 1960.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} hours of 10 February, Japanese forces {{suffered}} their heaviest losses during the Battle of Singapore. While moving up the Kranji River, advance landing parties from the 4th Regiment of the Imperial Guard Division found themselves under heavy fire from Australian machine gunners and mortar teams. They also found themselves surrounded by oil slicks, which had been created by Allied personnel emptying the nearby Woodlands oil depot, to prevent its capture. A scenario feared by Yamashita came to pass by accident; the oil was set <b>alight</b> by Allied small arms fire, causing many Japanese soldiers to be burnt alive. Sustaining heavy losses, Nishimura requested permission to abandon the operation. However, Yamashita denied the request.|$|E
