50|$|Alonizing is a {{diffusion}} metallizing {{process in}} that it is a thermochemical treatment that involves enriching the surface layer of an object with one or more metallic elements. Specifically, alonizing is the diffusion of aluminum into the surface of a base metal through high temperature vapors. The types of metals that can be alonized include all types of wrought and cast steels (i.e. plain carbon and low alloy grades, ferritic and austenitic steels, highly alloyed nickel-chromium steels, etc.). This process results in an alloy with the surface properties of aluminum while retaining the base metal’s inherent strength and rigidity. Therefore, alonizing does not change the high-temperature mechanical properties of the base metal, which is the advantage of alonizing over simply creating an aluminum alloy (<b>aluminizing</b> the surface versus aluminum throughout the alloy).|$|E

The new facility, known as the Electro-Optical Deep Space Surveillance (EODSS) system, will track space debris, mainly consisting of inactive satellites, electronic parts of instruments, leftovers from rocket launch and other such junk in space. It will help ISRO to better handle their future missions, including re-entry capable space shuttles.

40|$|Despite {{the large}} {{industrial}} use of pack <b>aluminizing</b> processes {{for the protection}} of parts (e. g. cooling channels) of gas turbine blades, systematic studies relating the formation mechanisms and the chemical composition of pack aluminized layers to important process parameters, including the nature of the base alloy and the temperature, are scarce. In this study, 4 different alloys (pure Ni, Ni- 20 Cr, Inconel 738 and directionally solidified CM 247 LC) were subjected to a pack <b>aluminizing</b> process at three different temperatures (950. °C, 1000. °C, 1040. °C), using a pack mix containing a fluorine-based activator; the results were compared to those obtained with a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) <b>aluminizing</b> process performed at 1040. °C with the same fluorine-based gaseous precursor. The microstructural characterization, performed by SEM+quantitative EDX analysis, XRD and nanoindentation testing, shows that, during the heating stage of the pack <b>aluminizing</b> process, Al is transported to the sample surface at temperatures too low to allow significant simultaneous diffusion of Ni; therefore, a δ-Ni 2 Al 3 outer layer is formed by inward Al diffusion below the alloy surface, and its growth then continues during the isothermal stage as well. As a result, the chosen isothermal treatment temperature does not affect growth mechanisms, although it modifies the overall thickness of the aluminized layer. δ-Ni 2 Al 3 is converted to β-NiAl after a subsequent vacuum heat treatment at 1120 °C. In a CVD process, where gaseous precursor are introduced only after attaining the isothermal treatment stage, Al and Ni diffuse simultaneously {{from the very beginning of}} the <b>aluminizing</b> process and β-NiAl is directly developed.

The results show that the crystalline phase of aluminized coating is composed of AlNi, FeNi and AlNi 3, and the phase of AlNi reaches 78. 1 %, which indicates that aluminium atom has infiltrated into the alloy surface. Y 2 O 3 can greatly improve compactness of the aluminized coating, increase thickness, surface micro-hardness and high temperature oxidation resistance of the aluminized coating.
