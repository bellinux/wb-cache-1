5|$|Folklorist Campbell of Islay has {{speculated that}} {{descriptions}} of the boobrie may be based on sightings of the great auk. The bellowing sound made by the boobrie, more like <b>a</b> <b>bull</b> than a bird, may have its origin in the strange call of the common bittern, which was a rare visitor to Scotland.|$|E

5|$|Martial {{reports a}} contest between an {{elephant}} and <b>a</b> <b>bull,</b> and the elephant, having won, knelt before Titus. This may have formed {{part of its}} training, but Martial attributed it to a spontaneous recognition of the Emperor's power. He also mentions <b>a</b> <b>bull</b> enraged by fires in the amphitheatre being tossed around the arena before being killed by an elephant, {{but there is nothing}} to indicate that these two epigrams are about the same events or repeated many times during the span of one hundred days of celebration.|$|E

5|$|Cattle {{were raised}} at the farm. Eisenhower would often poke the rump of <b>a</b> <b>bull</b> with his shotgun {{to show what}} quality of steak the animal would {{eventually}} produce, alarming the Secret Service agents that were protecting him. Once, while barbecuing (something he loved {{to do on the}} farm), he made the mistake of announcing which cow he was cooking. As it had been the favorite cow of his granddaughter Susan Eisenhower, she was brought to tears.|$|E
5|$|Dominant bulls follow {{groups of}} cows during the rut, from August into early winter. <b>A</b> <b>bull</b> will defend his harem of 20 cows or more from {{competing}} bulls and predators. Only mature bulls have large harems and breeding success peaks at {{about eight years}} of age. Bulls between two and four years and over 11 years of age rarely have harems, and {{spend most of the}} rut on the periphery of larger harems. Young and old bulls that do acquire a harem hold it later in the breeding season than do bulls in their prime. <b>A</b> <b>bull</b> with a harem rarely feeds and he may lose up to 20 percent of his body weight. Bulls that enter the rut in poor condition are less likely to make it through to the peak conception period or have the strength to survive the rigors of the oncoming winter.|$|E
5|$|During Albin's episcopate, the {{incorporation}} of the Céli Dé ("vassal of God") into the cathedral chapter was probably brought near to completion. The Céli Dé were the Scottish monks who formed {{the base of the}} pre-Reform, pre-13th century monastery of Brechin before it was organised into a bishopric in the 12th century. <b>A</b> <b>bull</b> of Pope Innocent IV of 18 February 1250 stated that: These Céli Dé had been proclaimed as part of the secular cathedral by an act of Bishop Gregory, Albin's predecessor.|$|E

5|$|Europa's tale, {{well known}} in later {{classical}} literature and beyond, appears in a largely familiar form in the Catalogue. She caught Zeus's eye while she and some friends were gathering flowers in a meadow. The god transformed into <b>a</b> <b>bull</b> with breath smelling of saffron, {{in the guise of}} which he abducted Europa, carrying her upon his back to Crete. There she bore Minos, Rhadamanthys and Sarpedon to Zeus, and he gave her a necklace made by Hephaestus that would figure in Theban saga as the Necklace of Harmonia. Sarpedon ruled Lycia, and was apparently granted a lifespan equal to three generations of men by Zeus. His death at Troy and the rain of blood it inspired Zeus to send is briefly described. Minos ruled Crete, succeeding his stepfather Asterion. Poseidon sent up from the sea <b>a</b> <b>bull</b> which had sex with Minos' wife Pasiphae, siring the Minotaur. To Minos she also bore Deucalion, Catreus, Androgeos and Eurygyes, though it is equally possible that these last two names referred to a single son. At least one daughter, Ariadne, was surely present, for the myth of Androgeos–Eurygyes' death in Athens and the subsequent sacrifice of Athenian youths to the Minotaur will presuppose Theseus' expedition to Crete and Ariadne's complicity in slaying the beast.|$|E
5|$|Sigurður {{has used}} a variety of {{techniques}} to preserve the penises, including preservation in formaldehyde, pickling, drying, stuffing and salting. One particularly large penis taken from <b>a</b> <b>bull</b> has been converted into a walking stick. Many of the museum's exhibits are illuminated by lamps made by Sigurður from rams' testicles. Sigurður has also carved wooden phalluses, which can be found adorning various objects around the museum, and has a bow tie decorated with images of phalluses that he wears on special occasions.|$|E
5|$|The Bulls {{began their}} next drive {{at their own}} 26-yard line, but went three-and-out. Buffalo punter Peter Fardon kicked the ball {{over the head of}} UConn {{returner}} Jasper Howard; rather than let the ball go, he ran backwards chasing after it. Trying to grab the ball over his shoulder, he muffed the catch, and the ball bounced into the end zone, where it was recovered by Buffalo's Ray Anthony Long for <b>a</b> <b>Bull</b> touchdown. The special-teams miscue by Howard allowed Buffalo to tie the game at 10–10 with 11:36 remaining in the second quarter.|$|E

5|$|The {{scientific}} {{name of the}} common eland is Taurotragus oryx, composed of three words: tauros, tragos and oryx. Tauros is Greek for <b>a</b> <b>bull</b> or bullock, meaning {{the same as the}} Latin taurus. Tragos is Greek for a male goat, referring to the tuft of hair that grows in the eland's ear and its resemblance to a goat's beard. Oryx is Latin and Greek (generally orygos) for pickaxe, referring to the pointed horns of North African antelopes like the common eland and scimitar-horned oryx.|$|E

Padayappa prays for her soul to be at peace and eventually attain salvation.|$|E
5|$|Catherine {{proved to}} be a zealous convert. She {{initiated}} and financed from her dowry the construction of churches throughout Bosnia, starting with one in Kupres in 1447, followed by churches in Krupa na Vrbasu and Jezero; a church in Jajce was built in 1458. In December 1458 she wrote to Pope Pius II to request that the church in Jajce, built along with a Franciscan monastery and a vicariate, be named after her namesake, Saint Catherine of Alexandria. Pius conceded her request in <b>a</b> <b>bull</b> issued on 13 December, granting absolution to anyone who visited Queen Catherine's church at Christmas or Easter, or on certain feast days. Another church built by Queen Catherine in Jajce and dedicated to Saint Catherine was a simple royal chapel. The churches built in Vrbanja, Vranduk, Tešanj and Vrila are attributed to both Catherine and her husband.|$|E
5|$|During the Hellenistic period, the {{sanctuary}} was {{extended from the}} base of the podium across the valley. To the east base of the podium stands a large chapel, , dating to the 4thcentury BC. The chapel was adorned with a paved pool and a large stone throne carved of a single block of granite in the Egyptian style; it is flanked by two sphinx figures and surrounded by two lion sculptures. The throne, attributed to the Sidonian goddess Astarte, rests against the chapel wall, which is embellished by relief sculptures of hunting scenes. The once important Astarte basin lost its function during the 2nd century AD and was filled with earth and statue fragments. The west base contains another 4th century BC chapel—centered on <b>a</b> <b>bull</b> protome topped capital—that remains preserved at the National Museum of Beirut.|$|E
