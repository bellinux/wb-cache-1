6000|$|... "And I'm sure of it, too," [...] Elma answered, {{with the}} instinctive {{certainty}} of feminine conviction. [...] "But still I know, for all that, he did it.

60|$|I am loth to {{make any}} part of my writing a satire upon the women; nor, indeed, does the extravagance either of dress or house-keeping, lie all, or always, {{at the door of}} the tradesmen's wives--the husband is often the {{prompter}} of it; <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not let his wife into the detail of his circumstances, <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not make her mistress of her own condition, but either flatters her with notions of his wealth, his profits, and his flourishing circumstances, and so the innocent woman spends high and lives great, believing that she is in a condition to afford it, and that her husband approves of it; <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not offer to retrench or restrain her, but lets her go on, and indeed goes on with her, to the ruin of both.|$|R
60|$|Straker, {{with the}} air {{of a man who has}} been making haste, opens the little gate, and admits Hector, who, {{snorting}} with indignation, comes upon the lawn, and is making for his father when Violet, greatly dismayed, springs up and intercepts him. Straker doer not wait; <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not remain visibly within earshot.|$|R
6000|$|His Muse {{being all}} Sentiment and Sago and Sugar, while he himself is a [...] venomous talker. I say 'worst good man' {{because he is}} (perhaps) a [...] 'good' man; <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> good now and then, as well he may, [...] to {{purchase}} himself a shilling's worth of salvation for his slanders. [...] They are so 'little', too--small talk--and old Womanny, and he is [...] malignant too--and envious--and--he be damned!" ...|$|R
6000|$|On August 26, Randolph, after {{describing}} the intimidation of the priest, says [...] "John Knox thundereth {{out of the}} pulpit, so that I fear {{nothing so much as}} that one day he will mar all. He ruleth the roast, and of him all men stand in fear." [...] In public <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not allay the wrath of the brethren.|$|E
60|$|It is the {{business}} of the truthful historian to narrate facts, not to palliate or extenuate the conduct of the various actors. Whether Ernest did right or wrong, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> it; he wrote a playful social for Monday's 'Morning Intelligence,' and carried it into the office on Sunday afternoon himself, beause there was no postal delivery in the London district.|$|E
60|$|For a week Barney Custer {{wandered through}} the woods and {{mountains}} of Lutha. He did not dare approach or question any human being. Several times he had seen Austrian cavalry {{that seemed to be}} scouring the country for some purpose that the American could easily believe was closely connected with himself. <b>At</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not feel disposed to stop them, as they cantered past his hiding place, to inquire the nature of their business.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, I don't {{know that}} unlucky {{is the proper}} word, but he has always stood between me and success; <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>he</b> always <b>did,</b> for it is some years since our paths have crossed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; I {{have already}} {{resigned}} the curacy. I believe your uncle has appointed to it the man whom Campbell found for me: {{and an excellent}} man, I hear, <b>he</b> is. <b>At</b> <b>least,</b> <b>he</b> will <b>do</b> better there than I." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{think that}} no one can go up to London but yourself, Mr Whittlestaff. I was up there myself yesterday;--as soon as ever this great {{question}} of the day was positively settled, I had to look after my own trousseau. I don't see why a gentleman isn't to have a trousseau as well as a lady. At any rate, I wanted a new black suit, fit for the hymeneal altar. And when there I made out John Gordon, and soon wormed the truth out of him. <b>At</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not tell me downright, but he let the cat so far out of the bag that I soon guessed the remainder. I always knew how it would be, Miss Lawrie." ...|$|E
6000|$|The mystery {{remained}} impenetrable, and {{the culprit}} was never brought to justice. We {{know that in}} slaying Gandia, Giovanni Sforza vented a hatred whose object was not Gandia, but Gandia's father. His aim was to deal Pope Alexander the cruellest and most lingering of wounds, and if he lacked the avenger's satisfaction of disclosing himself, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not lack assurance that his blow had stricken home. He heard--as all Italy heard--from that wayfarer {{on the bridge of}} Sant' Angelo, how the Pope, in a paroxysm of grief at sight of his son's body fished from the Tiber, had bellowed in his agony like a tortured bull, so that his cries within the castle were heard upon the bridge. He learnt how the handsome, vigorous Pope staggered into the consistory of the 19th of that same month with the mien and gait of a palsied old man, and, in a voice broken with sobs, proclaimed his bitter lament: ...|$|E
6000|$|So far his {{new work}} {{had brought him}} no nearer to the hearts of men. Or <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not feel it had. Both at the regimental base, and now in this hospital--an {{intermediate}} stage--waiting for the draft with which he would be going into Palestine, all had been very nice to him, friendly, and as it were indulgent; so might schoolboys have treated some well-intentioned dreamy master, or business men a harmless idealistic inventor who came visiting their offices. He had even {{the feeling that they}} were glad to have him about, just as they were glad to have their mascots and their regimental colours; but of heart-to-heart simple comradeship--it seemed they neither wanted it of him nor expected him to give it, so that he had a feeling that he would be forward and impertinent to offer it. Moreover, he no longer knew how. He was very lonely. 'When I {{come face to face with}} death,' he would think, 'it will be different. Death makes us all brothers. I may be of real use to them then.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Will {{you go to}} him?' he {{presently}} added. 'Perhaps I grew too {{angry at}} last, and I believe <b>he</b> loves you. <b>At</b> <b>least,</b> if <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not, <b>he</b> must be more unfeeling than I can think him. You do not dislike it, dearest.' ...|$|R
40|$|The {{subjective}} {{feeling is}} something in what is modern medicine often forgotten or <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not sufficient attention. Even in strict budgets and time limits insurance companies must not forget that the first patient we treat and not its symptoms. The patient usually brings to the doctor subjective feeling that is not completely healed. The task of the doctor felt health to return, preferably so that the patient is cured. In children, this feeling is more important that the child usually understand why it {{must be in the}} hospital and undergoing various procedures that he often felt worse health (pain, discomfort [...] .). In this work, I tried to understand more about how children subjectively perceived wellbeing...|$|R
50|$|PR Hager {{moved on}} to another find at Manana, a farm next to Lichtenburg, and went prospecting. The first {{proclamation}} of a digging was made there. He then moved off to a farm, Hangklip, near Elandsputte. <b>At</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> thought <b>he</b> <b>did.</b> Unknowingly <b>he</b> got lost and started prospecting Elandsputte itself. Within days he found a stunning 6 carat g stone.His first wash delivered 21 diamonds, the next, 361. The diggings were proclaimed in February 1926, the first one where thousands of diggers took part.|$|R
6000|$|... "A brother--whether {{better or}} worse than me, God knows, before whom he has {{appeared}} ere now. <b>At</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not, as I did, end as a rebel to his king! There was a maiden {{in one of those}} convents, senors, more beautiful than day: and (I blush to tell it) the two brothers of whom I spoke quarrelled for the possession of her. They struck each other, senors! Who struck first I know not; but swords were drawn, and--The cavaliers round parted them, crying shame. And one of those two brothers--the one who speaks to you now--crying, 'If I cannot have her, no man shall!' turned the sword which was aimed at his brother, against that hapless maiden--and--hear me out, senors, before you flee from my presence as from that of a monster!--stabbed her to the heart. And as she died--one moment more, senors, that I may confess all!--she looked up in my face with a smile as of heaven, and thanked me for having rid her once and for all from Christians and their villainy." ...|$|E
60|$|Or <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> {{not want}} to do good in my boy's time. Things may be changed now, for I have been talking of boys {{as they were in the}} Boy's Town forty years ago. For {{anything}} that I really know to the contrary, a lot of fellows when they get together now may plot good deeds of all kinds, but when more than a single one of them was together then they plotted mischief. When I see five or six boys now lying under a tree on the grass, and they fall silent as I pass them, I have no right to say that they are not arranging to go and carry some poor widow's winter wood into her shed and pile it neatly up for her, and wish to keep it a secret from everybody; but forty years ago I should have had good reason for thinking that they were debating how to tie a piece of her clothes-line along the ground so that when her orphan boy came out for an armload of wood after dark, he would trip on it and send his wood flying all over the yard.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{then there}} is {{something}} to be said about the country folk," [...] said the vicar. [...] "Your kindness has been, perhaps, a little indiscriminate there. They don't seem to be as helpful or as self-reliant as they used. There was old Blaxton, whose cowhouse roof was blown off the other day. He used to be a man who was full of energy and resource. Three months ago he would have got a ladder and had that roof on again in two days' work. But now he must sit down, and wring his hands, and write letters, because he knew that it would come to your ears, and that you would make it good. There's old Ellary, too! Well, of course he was always poor, but <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> something, and so kept himself out of mischief. Not a stroke will he do now, but smokes and talks scandal from morning to night. And the worst of it is, that it not only hurts those who have had your help, but it unsettles those who have not. They all have an injured, surly feeling as if other folk were getting what they had an equal right to. It has really come to such a pitch that I thought it was a duty to speak to you about it. Well, it is a new experience to me. I have often had to reprove my parishioners for not being charitable enough, but it is very strange to find one who is too charitable. It is a noble error." ...|$|E

60|$|At {{one time}} there seemed a {{probability}} of the {{enlargement of the}} author's gains by subscription publication, and one very well-known American author prospered fabulously in that way. The percentage offered by the subscription houses was only about {{half as much as}} that paid by the trade, but the sales were so much greater that the author could very well afford to take it. Where the book-dealer sold ten, the book-agent sold a hundred; or <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> so in the case of Mark Twain's books; and we all thought it reasonable he could do so with ours. Such of us as made experiment of him, however, found the facts illogical. No book of literary quality was made to go by subscription except Mr. Clemens's books, and I think these went because the subscription public never knew what good literature they were. This sort of readers, or buyers, were so used to getting something worthless for their money that they would not spend it for artistic fiction, or, indeed, for any fiction at all except Mr. Clemens's, which they probably supposed bad. Some good books of travel had a measurable success through the book-agents, but not at all the success that had been hoped for; and I believe now the subscription trade again publishes only compilations, or such works as owe more to the skill of the editor than the art of the writer. Mr. Clemens himself no longer offers his books to the public in that way.|$|E

5000|$|Save two minor exceptions, Godspeed You! Black Emperor {{features}} no vocals; instead, {{they use}} audio samples produced by Sophie Trudeau. Similarly themed samples also appear on Silver Mt. Zion's debut album, wherein Menuck sings on two tracks - [...] "Movie (Never Made)" [...] and [...] "Blown-out Joy from Heaven's Mercied Hole". Menuck {{confessed that he}} was uncomfortable with this at first, feeling [...] "foolish" [...] and uncomfortable {{with the role of}} the singer in music generally. At the time <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not want to be the focus of the band's music but rather wished to use vocals as a stylistic tool.|$|E

After locating where Spider-Man is being held by the Owl and Hammerhead, Hawkeye attempts to rescue him. Ultron locates the two heroes and launches an assault to kill them. Hawkeye destroys the Ultron Sentinels, and the two {{make their way to}} an underground area beneath Central Park, where Iron Man, Emma Frost, She-Hulk, Luke Cage, Invisible Woman and Wolverine have taken refuge. Defending the rescue, Hawkeye states that <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not give up on the world.

5000|$|Tizard {{met with}} both Vannevar Bush and George W. Lewis {{and told them}} about jet propulsion, but he {{revealed}} very little except the seriousness of British efforts. Bush later recalled: [...] "The interesting parts of the subject, namely the explicit {{way in which the}} investigation was being carried out, were apparently not known to Tizard, and <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not give me any indication that he knew such details". Later, Bush realised that the development of the Whittle engine was far ahead of the NACA project. In July 1941 he wrote to General [...] "Hap" [...] Arnold, commander of the USAAF, [...] "It becomes evident that the Whittle engine is a satisfactory development and that it is approaching production, although we yet do not know just how satisfactory it is. Certainly if it is now in such state that the British plans call for large production in five months, it is extraordinarily advanced and no time should be lost on the matter". Bush recommended that arrangements should be made to produce the British engine in the United States by finding a suitable company. This company turned out to be General Electric and the US Whittle engine would emerge as the General Electric I-A and subsequent production General Electric J31.|$|E
40|$|In {{the history}} of {{interpretation}} of the Qur’an {{we find that the}} study of Qur’anic interpretation started {{from the time of the}} Messenger of Allah until the present time. From the period in which the commentary is learned and studied through the riwayat (narration) and talqin (indoctrination) from a teacher to his student until the time when every person ‘feel’ to have the authority to interpret the verses of the Qur’an. The study of Qur’anic intepretation has undergone the tremendous growth in the fourth phase of the compilation period (tadwin). That was the phase in which the interpretation of the Qur’an wass controlled by the interpretation based on reason and the opinion of the interpreter (mufassir); interpretations coloured by various sects and schools of thought. The development of this kind of interpretation, although believed to be a logical consequence of the development history of science, but then not necessarily be accepted by the ulamas and received positive appreciation of them. Like Muhammad Husein adh Dhahabi, Muhammad Abu Zahrah, and so forth. For Imam Muhammad Abu Zahrah (1898 - 1974 / 1315 - 1394) the interpretation of the Quran which is based on a variety of goals and interests as well as a variety of comprehension and thinking like that, in fact was often away from the substance of Al-Quran; obscure its miracle power, destroying the real meaning and even provide commentary on the sometimes contradictory with the fundamentals of Islamic teaching. This is awakening his awareness and encourage him to try to straighten out and provide an alternative of more actual interpretation. So he finally wrote a book of tafsir named “Zahratu al Tafasir”. This interpretation is different from the books of the previous tafsir books. <b>At</b> <b>least,</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not want to simply follow the tradition (taqlid), the method or the way used by previous mufassir. </p...|$|E

60|$|Again she {{understood}} him, the more clearly because she saw by the slight wrinkling of his forehead, during the significant pause, {{that he had}} grappled with the question.
