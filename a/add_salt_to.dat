2500|$|Jewitt {{describes}} {{in some detail}} the physical appearance, clothing and hats, jewellery, and face and body painting of the Nootka. He explains the household implements (baskets, bags), simple furniture (wooden boxes, tubs, trays) and food, describing it as constantly either feasting or fasting. Herring spawn, dried fish, clams, oysters, sea mammal blubber and [...] "train oil" [...] (whale oil) were staples of the diet (the oil was even added to strawberries). Venison and bear meat were eaten fresh, but fish was often fermented; a delicacy was salmon roe. Jewitt had metal cooking pots from the ship, but was forbidden from preparing his own food—Maquinna insisted that his captives lived and ate as the Nootka did (p.51), i.e. boiling and steaming their food (p.69). The Nootka did not eat salted food or <b>add</b> <b>salt</b> <b>to</b> anything, and Maquinna forbade his captives to make salt (p.51). Jewitt found a box of chocolate and a case of port wine (p.47) from the ship's stores, which gave him much comfort, as the Nootka did not like these delicacies, although they did appreciate molasses, rum, and other spirits. The men became completely intoxicated when they had access to alcohol, but the women drank only water (p.48), and Jewitt feared for his safety when his captors were drunk.|$|E

James was bored intensely by the dull routine of regimental life in time of peace; {{it was a question}} of performing day after day the same rather unnecessary duties, seeing the same people, listening to the same chatter, the same jokes, the same chaff. And added to the incurable dulness of the mess was the irksome feeling of being merely an overgrown schoolboy at the beck and call of every incompetent and foolish senior. Life was too short to waste in such solemn trifling, masquerading in a ridiculous costume which had to be left at home when any work was to be done. But he was young, with the world before him; there were many careers free to the man who had no fear of death. Africa opened her dusky arms to the adventurer, ruthless and desperate; the world was so large and manifold, there was ample scope for all his longing. If there were difficulties, he could overcome them; perils would <b>add</b> <b>salt</b> <b>to</b> the attempt, freedom would be like strong wine. Ah, that was what he desired, freedom--freedom to feel that he was his own master; that he was not enchained by the love and hate of others, by the ties of convention and of habit. Every bond was tedious. He had nothing to lose, and everything to win. But just those ties which every man may divide of his own free will are the most oppressive; they are unfelt, unseen, till suddenly they burn the wrists like fetters of fire, and the poor wretch who wears them has no power to help himself.|$|E

The {{aim of this}} study was to examine the association between the dietary habit of <b>adding</b> <b>salt</b> <b>to</b> food and mortality in older men. Design, participants, setting and measurements: A risk factor questionnaire which contained a question about the dietary habit of <b>adding</b> <b>salt</b> <b>to</b> food was completed by 11742 community recruited older men between 1996 and 1999. The men were followed by means of the Western Australia Data Linkage System until November 30 th 2010.

The association between the frequencies of <b>adding</b> <b>salt</b> <b>to</b> food and mortality was assessed using Kaplan Meier estimates and Cox proportional hazard analysis. Results: Median follow-up for survivors was 12. 5 years (inter-quartile range 8. 3 – 13. 2 years).

While particle size reduction and plant growth promotion have been claimed, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only alter the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Examples are remediation of calcium scaling and remediation of salt crusts in soil. These systems do not fall within the term [...] "water softening" [...] but rather [...] "water conditioning".|$|E

U to MG (pH 2, no <b>added</b> <b>salt</b> <b>to</b> pH 2, 0. 5 M KCl) yielded + 100 +/- 6 mL/mol. MG to N was broken into two steps, N to NClx at pH 7 by addition of buffered KCl to buffered protein lacking <b>added</b> <b>salt</b> (NClx = N interacting with an unknown number, X, of chloride ions), and MG to NClx by jumping MG at pH 2 in 0. 5 M KCl to pH 7 at the same salt concentration.

Within experimental error, the results add up to zero for a complete thermodynamic cycle. We believe this to be the first volumetric cycle to have been measured for the conformational transitions of a protein.

The {{labour-intensive}} task is shared by families, relatives and neighbours. Groups of Korean people gather to cut the vegetables, wash them, and <b>add</b> <b>salt</b> <b>to</b> cure the food and begin the fermentation process. The nature of kimchi means that it is challenging to store for long periods; if it is too cold, it will freeze, and if it is too warm, it will over ferment, and may turn sour. The traditional solution in the countryside and prior to effective modern refrigeration is to store kimchi in earthenware jars in the ground, buried up to the neck level of the jar to prevent the contents from freezing. As the temperature falls below 0 °C, fermentation is halted and the food is preserved; it begins again as the temperature increases in spring time.|$|E
50|$|Yeast extract is {{the common}} name for various forms of {{processed}} yeast products that are used as food additives or flavours. They are often {{used in the same}} way that monosodium glutamate (MSG) is used and, like MSG, often contain free glutamic acid. The general method for making yeast extract for food products such as Vegemite and Marmite on a commercial scale is to <b>add</b> <b>salt</b> <b>to</b> a suspension of yeast, making the solution hypertonic, which leads to the cells' shrivelling up. This triggers autolysis, wherein the yeast's digestive enzymes break their own proteins down into simpler compounds, a process of self-destruction. The dying yeast cells are then heated to complete their breakdown, after which the husks (yeast with thick cell walls that would give poor texture) are separated. Yeast autolysates are used in Vegemite and Promite (Australia); Marmite, Bovril and Oxo (the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland and South Africa); and Cenovis (Switzerland).|$|E
