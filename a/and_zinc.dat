5|$|The element was {{probably}} {{named by the}} alchemist Paracelsus after the German word Zinke (prong, tooth). German chemist Andreas Sigismund Marggraf is credited with discovering pure metallic zinc in 1746. Work by Luigi Galvani and Alessandro Volta uncovered the electrochemical properties of zinc by 1800. Corrosion-resistant zinc plating of iron (hot-dip galvanizing) is the major application for zinc. Other applications are in electrical batteries, small non-structural castings, and alloys such as brass. A variety of zinc compounds are commonly used, such as zinc carbonate <b>and</b> <b>zinc</b> gluconate (as dietary supplements), zinc chloride (in deodorants), zinc pyrithione (anti-dandruff shampoos), zinc sulfide (in luminescent paints), <b>and</b> <b>zinc</b> methyl or zinc diethyl in the organic laboratory.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT A {{prospective}} study of <b>zinc</b> <b>and</b> copper replacement concurrently with total parenteral nutrition was undertaken during 29 courses of total parenteral nutrition in 20 tumor-bearing patients. Urinary excretion of <b>zinc</b> <b>and</b> copper was prospectively studied in eight of these subjects. While progressive declines in <b>zinc</b> <b>and</b> copper blood levels occurred in four unsupple-mented control patients, maintenance of plasma trace metal concentrations within normal limits {{was accomplished by}} daily intravenous <b>zinc</b> <b>and</b> copper. A daily intravenous intake of 70 to 80 g/ kg of <b>zinc</b> <b>and</b> 60 to 65 zg/kg of copper were generally associated with normal blood levels and positive urinary balance of these trace elements.

5|$|In {{terms of}} mineral resources, the Goat Rocks area {{can be divided}} into three segments, each rich with certain minerals. The first two are named Packwood Glacier–McCall Basin and Glacier Basin, and are located near past {{volcanic}} vents. These areas exhibit anomalous levels of cobalt, copper, lead, molybdenum, nickel, <b>and</b> <b>zinc,</b> well-dispersed levels of pyrite, and sporadic concentrations of silver. Area C corresponds to the Clear Fork of the Cowlitz River and lies along the area of contact between Goat Rocks volcano and older volcanoes to the east. It is distinct from the other two study areas, featuring anomalous amounts of barium, cobalt, copper, and manganese, as well as smaller quantities of lead, molybdenum, nickel, <b>and</b> <b>zinc.</b> Other minerals found in Area C include barite, boron, cinnabar, mercury, pyrite, and tin in concentrates taken from stream-sediment. The water has high concentrations of chlorine, copper, fluorine, and molybdenum, and altered rocks contain arsenic, lead, manganese, molybdenum, <b>and</b> <b>zinc</b> at especially high levels. The Goat Rocks vicinity seems to offer large base metal deposits. Outside the area studied, coal has been identified at the Packwood and Cowlitz fields, and building stones and gravel are being quarried to the north and west of the volcano. The Goat Rocks area's potential resources for oil and gas remain unidentified. Because no volcanic activity has occurred during the Holocene (within the past 11,700 years), Goat Rocks has very little potential for geothermal resources.|$|E
