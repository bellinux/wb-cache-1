40|$|A {{study of}} nonsustained {{breakdowns}} {{has been made}} during <b>alternating</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>tests</b> on the electric strength of various commercial insulants in transformer oil and compressed sulphur hexafluoride and nitrogen. Such breakdowns do not cause sustained arcing and current flow. It is demonstrated for normal test circuits, that the voltage required for nonsustained breakdown may be significantly below that which will cause a sustained discharge. Experimental results {{of the effect of}} test circuit parameters and relay settings on the breakdown voltages recorded are given. The implications of these results on the hitherto accepted practice of ignoring nonsustained breakdowns in many insulation testing standards are discussed, and these might well be taken into consideration when the testing standards are reviewed for possible revision.

40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} {{fundamental}} investigations of partial discharge behaviour of typical defects of PE/XLPE-insulated medium <b>voltage</b> cables at <b>test</b> <b>voltages</b> with variable shape and frequency.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [57]- 58) This paper {{presents an}} analysis {{tool for the}} design and development of switched reluctance generating systems. A detailed computer model of a switched reluctance generating system was developed using MATLAB and SIMULINK software packages. The LV 100 Switched Reluctance Starter/Generator System, developed by Sundstrand for an aircraft engine application, {{was used as the}} blueprint for the construction of the model and was validated with actual test data from that system. Overall, the switched reluctance generating system model provides a reasonable estimate of the actual switched reluctance generating system performance. The switched reluctance generating system model allows the user to change any part of the system and see the effects without physically changing the hardware or going to a test stand. The user can save time and money testing new designs before changing the real system. The remaining part of this paper is devoted to two examples of how the system model can be used to <b>test</b> <b>alternate</b> <b>voltage</b> feedback filter designs. The system model showed how the performance of the system could be improved by changing the voltage feedback filter to either a band-reject or synchronously sampled filter method. This paper limited the exploration to just two examples, many other methods can be tested. M. S. (Master of Science...|$|R
40|$|International audienceOver {{the past}} decade, {{interest}} {{has increased in}} leveraging low-cost "alternate'' test methods as a drop-in replacement for testing analog and RF devices. The current practice for testing such devices, known as specification test, can be very expensive by comparison. By substituting less-costly <b>alternate</b> <b>tests</b> for specification test, substantial test cost reduction can be achieved. Despite this promised cost reduction, the testing community {{has been reluctant to}} adopt such <b>alternate</b> <b>test</b> methods in industrial settings, as the error incurred by <b>alternate</b> <b>test</b> can be quite difficult to capture. Estimating the expected test error metrics early in the fabrication process is, therefore, extremely desirable. In this work, we present a case study in which we investigate the reliability of kernel density estimation as a means of providing such early estimates of <b>alternate</b> <b>test</b> error. We also introduce the novel application of Laplacian score feature selection to identify key subsets of <b>alternate</b> <b>tests.</b> With these tools we are able to dramatically reduce the number of <b>alternate</b> <b>tests</b> applied, as well as predict test escape and yield loss error metrics within about 0. 5 % of their true values when evaluated on an industrial dataset with more than 1 million devices...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{seamless}} integration of high-frequency <b>test</b> <b>voltages</b> for IPMSM rotor-position estimation in the discrete-time current-controller with fixed sampling frequency of a voltage-source converter. Pulsed <b>test</b> <b>voltages</b> are used that don’t interfere with the current samples taken to control the phase currents. For this purpose, an asymmetric pulse-width modulator is applied. As {{a result of this}} strategy, the controller output influences the <b>test</b> <b>voltages</b> and consequently the current response from which the rotor position is estimated. Therefore, in this paper, a first strategy is studied in which the applied <b>test</b> <b>voltages</b> are computed taking into account the controller output. A second method is discussed as well in which the controller output is slightly delayed so that this output has no influence on the test signals.

40|$|International audienceSpecification testing, which {{involves}} the direct {{measurement of the}} circuit performance parameters is the conventional practice for testing analog/RF devices. While this approach is highly accurate, it often incurs extremely high testing costs. A promising approach is to adopt <b>alternate</b> <b>test</b> strategy, i. e. a strategy in which test results are derived from indirect low-cost measurements. The underlying idea is to learn during a training phase the mapping between indirect measurements and circuit performance parameters, and to use only indirect measurements to predict device specifications during production testing.

In this paper, we propose a novel implementation with the objective to improve confidence in <b>alternate</b> <b>test</b> predictions.

40|$|The goal of {{automated}} {{assembly of}} <b>alternate</b> <b>test</b> forms {{is to produce}} multiple test forms that are equivalent to some target. To achieve that goal, the alternate forms are usually assembled according to the content and psychometric specifications obtained from a reference test.

The test scores derived from such assembled forms are beneficial to indicate the standing of an examinee or make inferences about an individual’s performance. However, the requirement that each examinee should be provided test forms with identical test properties can be too stringent and unnecessary for certification and licensure testing. In such setting, tests are intended to classify examinees into categories (e. g., pass vs. fail, or master vs. non-master), and information about an individual’s standing relative to a tested population is not the main concern. One way to assemble equivalent test forms for classification testing can be to constrain <b>alternate</b> <b>test</b> forms to have identical test properties for, for example, two contrast groups (o...|$|R
