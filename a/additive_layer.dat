With their inherent superior specific strength and stiffness, CFRP offer an interesting option also for various machine tool components manufacturing. CFRP are generally weak in material damping.

40|$|In this research, {{samples of}} the H 13 steel, a {{commonly}} used {{hot work tool steel}} in the die/mould manufacturing industry, were additively manufactured using selective laser melting (SLM). Their as-built microstructures were characterised in detail using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and compared with that of the conventionally manufactured H 13 (as-supplied). SLM resulted in the formation of martensite and also its partial decomposition into fine α-Fe and Fe 3 C precipitates along with retained austenite. TEM analyses further revealed that the lattice of the resulting α-Fe phase is slightly distorted due to enhanced Cr, Mo and V contents. Substantially high residual stresses in the range of 940 - 1420 MPa were detected in the as-built H 13 samples compared with its yield strength of ~ 1650 MPa. In addition, it was identified that the high residual stress existed from just about two <b>additive</b> <b>layers</b> (100 µm) above the substrate along the build direction.

40|$|Speaker {{models for}} blind source {{separation}} are typically based on HMMs consisting of {{vast numbers of}} states to capture source spectral variation, and trained on large amounts of isolated speech. Since observations can be similar between sources, inference relies on sequential constraints from the state transition matrix which are, however, quite weak. To avoid these problems, we propose a strategy of capturing local deformations of the time-frequency energy distribution. Since consecutive spectral frames are highly correlated, each frame can be accurately described as a nonuniform deformation of its predecessor. A smooth pattern of deformations is indicative of a single speaker, and the cliffs in the deformation fields may indicate a speaker switch. Further, the log-spectrum of speech can be decomposed into two <b>additive</b> <b>layers,</b> separately describing the harmonics and formant structure. We model smooth deformations as hidden transformation variables in both layers, using MRFs with overlapping subwindows as observations, {{assumed to be a}} noisy sum of the two layers. Loopy belief propagation provides for efficient inference. Without any pre-trained speech or speaker models, this approach can be used to fill in missing time-frequency observations, and the local entropy of the deformation fields indicate source boundaries for separation...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{automotive}} topcoat is constituted of a pigmented basecoat, {{covered by}} a transparent and shiny clearcoat. This layer protects the basecoat from the environment damage and determines the paint appearance. For white plain colour, the basecoat/clearcoat system {{is replaced by a}} layer of lacquer. The surface analyses are used to determine the influence of the topcoat composition on the adhesion of pressure-sensitive adhesives. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and secondary ions mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) study the automotive topcoats chemistries. These analyses point out that polysiloxane additives are detected on the clearcoats but not on the lacquers. The impact of the different additives families (anti-UV agents and surface levelling additives) on the topcoat surface chemistry is identified. Moreover, the aluminium pigments do not appear on the metallic basecoat surface because of a siloxane <b>additives</b> <b>layer,</b> which also covers the polyester-polyurethane network.

In a conventional Hidden Markov Model (HMM), such structure is represented weakly and indirectly through transitions between explicit states representing `steps' along such smooth changes. It would be more efficient and informative to model successive spectra as transformations of their immediate predecessors, and we present a model which focuses on local deformations of adjacent bins in a timefrequency surface to explain an observed sound, using explicit representation only for those bins that cannot be predicted from their context. We further decompose the log-spectrum into two <b>additive</b> <b>layers,</b> which are able to separately explain and model {{the evolution of the}} harmonic excitation, and formant filtering of speech and similar sounds. Smooth deformations are modeled with hidden transformation variables in both layers, using Markov Random fields (MRFs) with overlapping subwindows as observations; inference is efficiently performed via loopy belief propagation.

This laboratory experimental study was carried out to evaluate changes in the load bearing capacity of reinforced soil with these materials in highway roadbed with regard to geotextile properties. California Bearing Ratio (CBR) test samples were prepared with two types of soil: Clayey and sandy containing non-reinforced and reinforced soil. The samples comprised three types of geotextiles with different characteristics (150, 200, 300 g/m 2) and depths (H= 5, 10, 20, 30, 50, 100 mm), and were grouped into two forms, one-layered and two-layered, based on the sample materials in order to perform defined tests. The results showed that the soil bearing characteristics increased when one layer of geotextile was used in clayey and sandy samples reinforced by geotextile. However, the bearing capacity of the soil, in the presence of a geotextile layer material with depth of more than 30 mm, had no remarkable effect. Furthermore, when the two-layered geotextile was applied in material samples, although it increased the soil resistance, it also showed that through the addition of a number or weights of geotextile into samples, the natural composition of the soil changed and the results are unreliable...|$|R
