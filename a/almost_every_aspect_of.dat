5|$|<b>Almost</b> <b>every</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> {{the battle}} would {{be managed by}} the DCDPS at the MAR base. The reason for this {{centralization}} was two-fold; one was that the radar system was extremely complex and expensive {{and could not be}} built in large numbers, the second was that the transistor-based computers needed to process the data were likewise very expensive. Nike-X thus relied on a few very expensive sites, and many greatly simplified batteries.|$|E
5|$|The altered {{bill was}} passed as an Act of Parliament in 1834. It was this act which founded the City of London School, which {{initially}} had around 400pupils. The act gave the Corporation of London {{a duty to}} maintain a school on the Honey Lane Market site and so gave control over <b>almost</b> <b>every</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> the school's running to the Corporation. A committee was also set up to manage the school, with Hale as chairman. Although the committee's powers were initially limited, they gained more control over time as they made important decisions for the school.|$|E

The purpose of this report is to study the role of requirements in software development process, and to survey the methods for specifying functional and non-functional requirements (NFRs). In this report the concepts of functional and non-functional requirements are introduced. The problems of functional and non-functional requirements lay on one of the following aspects: identify, document, validate and verify, so this report presents some answers to these questions through discussion and comparison of many process and methods. We also introduced some NFR frameworks are introduced and overviewed some tools used to support requirements...|$|R
40|$|Remarkable {{progress}} has been made in molecular characterization of prostate cancer (PCa) with continued innovations in high throughput technologies evaluating human cancer. [1],[2],[3] Since the completion of the Human Genome Project it has been estimated that only about 1. 5 %- 2 % of our genome codes for proteins. Various genome-wide approaches, e. g. the ENCODE project, revealed that a much larger percent of the genome is transcribed as non-protein coding (nc) RNA, including long noncoding (lnc) RNA (over 200 bps long). Although the biological roles of lncRNA (the 'dark matter of the genome') are not nearly as well-understood as the protein coding mRNAs, it is increasingly clear that they play important roles in <b>almost</b> <b>every</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> biology, including cancer biology.

25|$|Box to box midfielders {{help with}} <b>almost</b> <b>every</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> the game. They need immense stamina {{as they need}} to cover most areas of the pitch, {{as well as some}} degree of passing skills.

They normally play as central midfielders but any of the midfield players may have this attribute.|$|E
25|$|Withdrawal {{symptoms}} are a normal response in individuals having chronically used benzodiazepines, and an adverse effect and result of drug tolerance. Symptoms typically emerge when dosage {{of the drug}} is reduced. GABA is the second-most-common neurotransmitter in {{the central nervous system}} (the most common being glutamate) and by far the most abundant inhibitory neurotransmitter; roughly one-quarter to one-third of synapses use GABA.

25|$|The {{presence}} {{of so much}} ice upon the continents {{had a profound effect}} upon <b>almost</b> <b>every</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> Earth's hydrologic system. The most obvious effects are the spectacular mountain scenery and other continental landscapes fashioned both by glacial erosion and deposition instead of running water. Entirely new landscapes covering millions of square kilometers were formed in {{a relatively short period of}} geologic time. In addition, the vast bodies of glacial ice affected Earth well beyond the glacier margins. Directly or indirectly, the effects of glaciation were felt in every part of the world.|$|E
25|$|The Early Middle Ages {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of the cultural distinctions between Western and Eastern Europe north of the Mediterranean.

The turmoil of the so-called Barbarian invasions in the beginning of the period gradually gave way to more stabilized societies and states as the origins of contemporary Eastern Europe began to take shape during the High Middle Ages.|$|E
25|$|Culturally, Spain is a Western country. <b>Almost</b> <b>every</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> Spanish life is {{permeated}} by its Roman heritage, making Spain one of {{the major}} Latin countries of Europe. Spanish culture is marked by strong historic ties to Catholicism, which played a pivotal role in the country's formation and subsequent identity. Spanish art, architecture, cuisine, and music has been shaped by successive waves of foreign invaders, {{as well as by the}} country's Mediterranean climate and geography. The centuries-long colonial era globalised Spanish language and culture, with Spain also absorbing the cultural and commercial products of its diverse empire.|$|E

50|$|The American Studies in the U.S. is {{different}} from the American Studies in China. The former focuses more on one aspect, which is “civilization”; and the latter includes <b>almost</b> <b>every</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> the U.S., among which the civilization is just a constituent (Ye 207). Take the curriculum in the American Studies program in Beijing Foreign Studies University (BFSU) as an example. The American Studies program in BFSU is not only the oldest one but also the one in which all courses taught in English from the beginning of its founding. To help the students lay a comprehensive and interdisciplinary grounding in American Studies, the current ASC curriculum, made up of 28 courses, centers on three major areas: 1) American Government and Diplomacy, 2) American Society and Culture, 3) American Economy and Trade. In addition, there have been short courses and seminars offered by guest speakers from home and abroad to broaden the students’ horizon for better understanding of America. Every master student is required to choose one of the three major areas as his or her study track and chooses the courses accordingly.|$|R

25|$|PIDE is {{considered}} by many authors as being one of the most functional and effective secret services in history. Using a wide network of covert cells, which were spread throughout Portugal and its overseas territories, PIDE had infiltrated agents into almost every underground movement, including the Portuguese Communist Party as well as the independence movements in Angola and Mozambique. The PIDE encouraged citizens - the so-called bufos (snitches) - to denounce suspicious activities, through the use of monetary and prestige incentives. This resulted in an extremely effective espionage service which was able to fully control <b>almost</b> <b>every</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> Portuguese daily life.|$|E
25|$|The long, {{cold winter}} has a {{profound}} impact on <b>almost</b> <b>every</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> life in Russia. It affects where and how long people live and work, what kinds of crops are grown, and where they are grown (no part of the country has a year-round growing season). The length and severity of the winter, together with the sharp fluctuations in the mean summer and winter temperatures, impose special requirements on many branches of the economy. In regions of permafrost, buildings must be constructed on pilings, machinery must be made of specially tempered steel, and transportation systems must be engineered to perform reliably in extremely low and extremely high temperatures. In addition, during extended periods of darkness and cold, there are increased demands for energy, health care, and textiles.|$|E
40|$|Natural Killer (NK) {{cells are}} innate {{lymphocytes}} with {{an important role}} in the early defense against intracellular pathogens and against tumors. Like other immune cells, <b>almost</b> <b>every</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> their biology are regulated by cytokines. Interleukin (IL) - 15 is pivotal for their development, homeostasis and activation. Moreover, numerous other activating or inhibitory cytokines such as IL- 2, IL- 4, IL- 7, IL- 10, IL- 12, IL- 18, IL- 21, Transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) and type I interferons regulate their activation and their effector functions at different stages of the immune response. In this review we summarize the current understanding on the effect of these different cytokines on NK cell development, homeostasis and functions during steady-state or upon infection by different pathogens. We try to delineate the cellular sources of these cytokines, the intracellular pathways they trigger and the transcription factors they regulate. We describe the known synergies or antagonisms between different cytokines and highlight outstanding questions in this field of investigation. Finally, we discuss how a better knowledge of cytokine action on NK cells could help improve strategies to manipulate NK cells in different clinical situations...|$|R
