25|$|Howard the Duck (titled Howard: A New Breed of Hero in the UK) is a 1986 American science-fiction comedy film {{directed}} by Willard Huyck and starring Chip Zien, Lea Thompson, Jeffrey Jones, and Tim Robbins. Produced by Gloria Katz and written by Huyck and Katz, with George Lucas as executive producer, the screenplay was {{originally intended to}} be an animated film based on the Marvel comic book of the same name, but the film adaptation became live-action because of <b>a</b> <b>contractual</b> <b>obligation.</b> Although several TV adaptations of Marvel characters had aired during the preceding 21 years, {{this was the first}} theatrical released feature film, coming after the serial Captain America.|$|E
25|$|In an American Hospital Association study, {{the cost}} to replace one nurse in the U.S. was {{estimated}} at around $30,000–$64,000. This amount is likely related {{to the cost of}} recruiting and training nurses into the organization. Hiring foreign nurses is more financially taxing compared to hiring domestic-graduate nurses; however, facilities save money in the long run because foreign nurses have <b>a</b> <b>contractual</b> <b>obligation</b> to complete their term. The JACHO in the United States wrote in a 2002 research report on the shortage in the US that recruiting foreign trained nurses from abroad (not referring to those who reside in the United States already) does not help the global nursing shortage and, in fact, perpetuates it.|$|E
25|$|The {{introduction}} of a rebadged model named Dodge Monaco resulted from <b>a</b> <b>contractual</b> <b>obligation</b> to use 260,000 of the PRV engines over five years, a clause in the AMC buyout from Renault. The Monaco sold poorly, and both it and the Premier were cancelled in 1992. There was little marketing support for the Premier by the Jeep-Eagle dealers themselves because they were focused on selling the highly successful and more profitable Jeep models. Furthermore, the decision to eventually combine Jeep-Eagle with Chrysler-Plymouth dealers called for the long-term corporate goal of phasing out the Eagle brand. There were 139,051 Premiers and Monacos built at Bramalea. Chrysler paid a penalty for every car not produced and V6 engine not purchased from Renault.|$|E

25|$|Klaatu was {{eventually}} signed by Capitol's Canadian division, EMI Canada, and released their final album, Magentalane, in 1981. This album saw the group {{returning to their}} brand of Beatles-influenced pop/rock. As <b>a</b> <b>contractual</b> <b>obligation</b> to Capitol-EMI in Canada, the band was forced to play their first-ever live dates and tour most of Canada to promote Magentalane. From November 1981, the group expanded to a sextet, using members of Max Webster and Nightwinds, Gary McCracken and Gerald O'Brien for live performances. However, in April 1982 Dee Long – never fond of performing live, by most accounts – quit the group. Although Woloschuk and Draper carried on performing {{for a few more}} months, Klaatu officially disbanded in August of the same year.|$|E
25|$|In June 1949, Hirsch {{alleged that}} the Hornets (the Chicago Rockets were renamed the Hornets in 1949) had {{breached}} <b>a</b> <b>contractual</b> <b>obligation</b> to pay him a bonus and sought a release {{to allow him to}} play for the Green Bay Packers. However, the Los Angeles Rams held Hirsch's NFL rights having selected him in the 1945 NFL Draft, and Hirsch was therefore unable to sign with the Packers. Instead, he signed with the Rams in July 1949. Hirsch earned $20,000 a year from the Rams, following a bidding war with the Hornets. However, after the 1949 season, the AAFC folded, and the Rams reduced his salary with the competition from the AAFC gone. During his career with the Rams, Hirsch never again attained the salary level he was paid as a rookie.|$|E
500|$|The band's drummer, Butch Vig {{felt that}} Absolute Garbage would be [...] "a full stop {{on part of}} our career", marking the group's {{movement}} to a new part of their development, rather than simply <b>a</b> <b>contractual</b> <b>obligation,</b> while guitarist Duke Erikson stated that [...] "putting out a collection of our singles {{would be a good}} way to stay busy without working so hard". However, singer Shirley Manson revealed in 2012 that the compilation emerged from a demand by the band's UK label A Records in order to meet their quarterly requirements.|$|E

The question of whether consideration can be invalidated ‘if {{there has been a}} threat to repudiate <b>a</b> pre-existing <b>contractual</b> <b>obligation</b> or <b>an</b> unfair use of a dominating bargaining position’ was rejected because ‘where businessmen are negotiating at arm’s length it is unnecessary for the achievement of justice’. On the idea of past consideration, Lord Scarman said this: ...|$|R

500|$|Channing Tatum as Conrad S. Hauser / Duke [...] The lead soldier. Lorenzo di Bonaventura was {{originally}} interested in casting Mark Wahlberg, {{and when the}} script was rewritten into a G.I. Joe origin story, the studio offered the role to Tatum. Tatum had played a soldier in Stop-Loss, an anti-war film, and originally wanted no part in G.I. Joe, which he felt glorified war. The actor later detailed that he {{wound up in the}} film due to <b>a</b> <b>contractual</b> <b>obligation</b> with Paramount, given Tatum signed a three-picture deal following Coach Carter. Tatum was a fan of the G.I. Joe franchise while growing up, and expressed interest in playing Snake Eyes although Paramount wanted him for Duke.|$|E
500|$|Garbage {{later said}} that the album was {{released}} as <b>a</b> <b>contractual</b> <b>obligation</b> to Warner Music: [...] "This was the final straw that broke our backs", recalled Manson five years later. [...] "The record company we had been sold to in the U.K. demanded that we release a [...] "greatest hits" [...] {{in order to meet}} their quarterly requirements. We were {{not in a position to}} stop it. As a result, they shoved this collection out with no promotion whatsoever. It was right there and then that we realized how crazy and out of whack things had gotten." [...] Garbage remained on hiatus for a further three years until regrouping to record their fifth studio album, Not Your Kind of People, released in 2012.|$|E
500|$|The leading {{partner in}} the new {{ownership}} pair, William Thompson (1846–1934), had come to Oregon from his native Missouri aboard a wagon train during the 1850s and {{had worked as a}} printer's devil for the Democratic Eugene City newspapers the Democratic Register and The Review from the age of 16. His acquisition of The Guard required only that he fulfill <b>a</b> <b>contractual</b> <b>obligation</b> [...] "to run the paper and keep it alive." [...] This he and Victor managed to do successfully, earning Thompson a healthy $1,200 for his work before his sale of the paper to George J. Buys and A. Eltzroth on December24, 1869. Thompson would subsequently move to Roseburg, Oregon, and there establish a new newspaper, the Roseburg Plaindealer.|$|E

It decided that in varying a contract, a promise to perform <b>a</b> pre-existing <b>contractual</b> <b>obligation</b> will constitute good consideration so long as a benefit is conferred upon the promisee. This was {{a departure from the}} previously established principle that promises to perform pre-existing <b>contractual</b> <b>obligations</b> could not be good consideration.|$|R
50|$|John Ford {{shot the}} final {{scenes of the}} wagon train attack as a favor for Wayne when Farrow {{had to leave the}} film before its {{completion}} due to <b>a</b> conflicting <b>contractual</b> <b>obligation</b> to begin another film.

50|$|Regulation {{can take}} many forms: legal {{restrictions}} promulgated by <b>a</b> government authority, <b>contractual</b> <b>obligations</b> (for example, contracts between insurers and their insureds), social regulation (e.g. norms), co-regulation, third-party regulation, certification, accreditation or market regulation.|$|R
500|$|The {{project was}} {{regarded}} as <b>a</b> <b>contractual</b> <b>obligation</b> by the Beatles, who were asked to supply four new songs for the film. Some songs were written and recorded specifically for the soundtrack, while others were unreleased tracks from other projects. The album was issued {{two months after the}} band's self-titled double LP (also known as the [...] "White Album") and was therefore not viewed by the band as a significant release. Yellow Submarine has since been afforded a mixed reception from music critics, some of whom consider that it falls short of the high standard generally associated with the Beatles' work. It reached the top 5 in the UK and the US, and has been reissued on compact disc several times.|$|E
500|$|Blocks O–R of the {{development}} make up Brighton station car park. This has two decks, a ground area of [...] and 600 spaces, of which 26 are for disabled drivers. A pick-up and drop-off point with motorcycle parking and a turning circle is situated between the car park and the side entrance to the station. This was {{the first part of}} the New England Quarter to be completed; most of the work was undertaken by the Adenstar Construction Group, based in nearby Portslade. There was <b>a</b> <b>contractual</b> <b>obligation</b> to provide 600 spaces, although the form which this had to take was not specified and various proposals were considered, including a taller multi-storey structure with more floors and a much smaller ground area. During the construction works, a temporary car park was provided on land nearby.|$|E
500|$|Following his {{involvement}} with this episode, Campbell was considered as a possible contender {{for the role of}} John Doggett, a character that would appear in the eighth season. Over a hundred actors auditioned for the role. Due to <b>a</b> <b>contractual</b> <b>obligation,</b> Campbell could not take any work during the filming of his series Jack of All Trades. On potentially being cast as the series regular, Campbell mused, [...] "I had worked on an X-Files episode before, and I think they sort of remembered me from that. It was nice to be involved in that – even if you don't get it, it's nice to hang out at that party." [...] The character was eventually portrayed by actor Robert Patrick. Later in Campbell's novel Make Love! The Bruce Campbell Way, he joked that Patrick [...] "stiffed him out of the role".|$|E
25|$|U.S. {{record label}} Reprise had {{intended}} to release many of album's tracks on a separate Kinks album titled Four More Respected Gentlemen sometime in mid-1968 to fulfil <b>a</b> <b>contractual</b> album <b>obligation.</b> This was {{in the final stages}} of pre-production when Reprise dropped all plans to issue it, based on the strength of the forthcoming Village Green album.|$|R

50|$|In England, Columbia {{promoted}} {{the film as}} a Frank Capra production. Capra, the top director at the studio—who had been feuding with studio head Harry Cohn over financial and artistic issues—sued Columbia for unlawful use of his name. The parties settled, with Capra returning to the studio while getting $100,000 (the number based on a separate dispute over salary) and having one film waived from <b>a</b> <b>contractual</b> five-film <b>obligation.</b>|$|R
500|$|Gray {{had been}} {{interested}} in working with Wahlberg since seeing his performance in Boogie Nights (1997). After reading the script for The Italian Job, Gray contacted Wahlberg, who [...] "fell in love with it" [...] after reading it himself. Green was also attracted to the project because of the script. Theron was Gray's first choice for the character of Stella Bridger, and Wahlberg also recommended her for the role. She spent time with a safecracker in preparing for the role. Gray's casting director Sheila Jaffe suggested Statham {{for the role of}} getaway driver Handsome Rob, and Gray agreed with her choice. Norton took the role of Steve Frazelli, due to <b>a</b> <b>contractual</b> <b>obligation</b> he had to fulfill. Wahlberg, Theron, and Statham attended special driver's training sessions at Willow Springs International Motorsports Park for nearly a month during pre-production.|$|E
500|$|In 2006, Mos Def's {{third album}} True Magic was {{released}} haphazardly by Geffen Records to fulfill <b>a</b> <b>contractual</b> <b>obligation</b> {{while he was}} devoting more time to his acting career. The quality of the album, along with his repeated ventures away from hip hop in his music, left [...] "some fans wondering if Mos Def's acting accomplishments were finally affecting his music", PopMatters critic Quentin B. Huff later wrote. After ending his tenure on Geffen, he signed a record deal with Downtown Records and recorded The Ecstatic as his first album for the label. Most of its songs were recorded in sessions that {{took place at the}} Record Plant in Los Angeles; the songs [...] "Twilight Speedball", [...] "No Hay Nada Mas", and [...] "Roses" [...] were partially recorded at Hovercraft Studios in Virginia Beach, Someothaship Connect in Los Angeles, and New York City's Downtown Music Studios.|$|E
500|$|For {{the role}} of the unnamed Narrator, the studio desired a [...] "sexier marquee name" [...] like Matt Damon to {{increase}} the film's commercial prospects; it also considered Sean Penn. Fincher instead considered Norton a candidate for the role, based on the actor's performance in the 1996 film The People vs. Larry Flynt. Other studios were approaching Norton for leading roles in developing films like The Talented Mr. Ripley and Man on the Moon. The actor was cast in Runaway Jury, but the film did not reach production. 20th Century Fox offered Norton a $2.5million salary to attract him to Fight Club. Norton could not accept the offer immediately because he still owed Paramount Pictures a film; he had signed <b>a</b> <b>contractual</b> <b>obligation</b> with Paramount to appear in one of the studio's future films for a smaller salary (Norton later satisfied the obligation with his role in the 2003 film The Italian Job).|$|E

40|$|<b>Contractual</b> <b>obligations</b> are {{traditionally}} regarded as voluntary. A voluntary obligation {{is one that}} can be acquired only if one intends to acquire it. This traditional understanding finds doctrinal expression in the requirement that contracting parties intend to create legal relations. It has, however, been doubted that the Anglo-Canadian law of contract insists on this requirement. Skeptics argue that cases ostensibly decided on the basis of such a requirement are better explained otherwise. In this paper I invoke the legal force of contractual disclaimers to show that <b>contractual</b> <b>obligations</b> are indeed voluntary. When parties to an agreement purport to exclude it from the reach of the law by expressly disavowing an intention to bind themselves legally, they have issued a disclaimer. An unambiguous disclaimer will preclude an agreement from being enforced as <b>a</b> contract. <b>Contractual</b> <b>obligations</b> are thus “disclaimer-sensitive”. I argue that this striking feature of <b>contractual</b> <b>obligations</b> can be plausibly explained only if <b>contractual</b> <b>obligations</b> are voluntary...|$|R

500|$|The chassis {{platform}} {{used for}} the C3 Picasso is {{a modified version of}} that in the Citroën C3 and the Peugeot 207, giving it a comparable wheelbase. The reuse of automobile platforms is commonplace, especially for Citroën because the Trnava plant builds the Peugeot 207 and the C3 Picasso. The parent company PSA Peugeot Citroën pools resources and manufacturing for some vehicles, and sometimes rebadges vehicles, combining design teams between two or more brands to create a shared product. The advantage is the designing and testing vehicles at a reduced cost for the participating brands, but creates multiple, identical-looking vehicles for the market, sometimes with minor styling differences. Examples include: the Fiat Scudo, Peugeot Expert and Citroën Dispatch, the Toyota Aygo, Peugeot 107 and Citroën C1, and the Peugeot Partner and Citroën Berlingo. Citroën placed <b>a</b> <b>contractual</b> <b>obligation</b> on the manufacturers to use green materials for the C3 Picasso range.
