5|$|Aspirin, {{also known}} as acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), is <b>a</b> <b>medication</b> used to treat pain, fever, or inflammation. Specific {{inflammatory}} conditions in which aspirin is used include Kawasaki disease, pericarditis, and rheumatic fever. Aspirin given shortly {{after a heart attack}} decreases the risk of death. Aspirin is also used long-term to help prevent heart attacks, ischaemic strokes, and blood clots, in people at high risk. Aspirin may also decrease the risk of certain types of cancer, particularly colorectal cancer. For pain or fever, effects typically begin within 30 minutes. Aspirin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and works similar to other NSAIDs but also suppresses the normal functioning of platelets.|$|E

5|$|Lice {{recorded}} from impala include Damalinia aepycerus, D. elongata, Linognathus aepycerus and L. nevilli; in a study, ivermectin (<b>a</b> <b>medication</b> against parasites) {{was found}} to have an effect on Boophilus decoloratus and Linognathus species, though not on Damalinia species. In a study of impala in South Africa, the number of worms in juveniles showed an increase with age, reaching a peak when impala turned a year old. This study recorded worms of genera such as Cooperia, Cooperoides, Fasciola, Gongylonema. Haemonchus, Impalaia, Longistrongylus and Trichostrongylus; some of these showed seasonal variations in density.|$|E
5|$|Midazolam, marketed {{under the}} trade name Versed, among others, is <b>a</b> <b>medication</b> used for anesthesia, {{procedural}} sedation, trouble sleeping, and severe agitation.

5|$|More than 5000 {{cases of}} {{poisoning}} {{occur in the}} United States each year. Those affected are often adults and male. Deaths from ethylene glycol have been reported as early as 1930. An outbreak of deaths in 1937 due to <b>a</b> <b>medication</b> mixed in a similar compound, diethylene glycol, resulted in the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 in the United States which mandated evidence of safety before new medications could be sold. Antifreeze products sometimes have a substance to make it bitter added to discourage drinking by children and other animals but {{this has not been}} found to be effective.|$|E

5|$|Warfarin {{interacts with}} many {{commonly}} used drugs, and the metabolism of warfarin varies greatly between patients. Some foods {{have also been}} reported to interact with warfarin. Apart from the metabolic interactions, highly protein bound drugs can displace warfarin from serum albumin and cause {{an increase in the}} INR. This makes finding the correct dosage difficult, and accentuates the need of monitoring; when initiating <b>a</b> <b>medication</b> that is known to interact with warfarin (e.g. simvastatin), INR checks are increased or dosages adjusted until a new ideal dosage is found.|$|E
5|$|Warfarin, {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Coumadin among others, is <b>a</b> <b>medication</b> that is used as an {{anticoagulant}} (blood thinner). It is commonly used to treat blood clots such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and to prevent stroke in people who have atrial fibrillation, valvular heart disease or artificial heart valves. Less commonly it is used following ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and orthopedic surgery. It is generally taken by mouth but may also be used by injection into a vein.|$|E
5|$|Spirometry {{measures}} {{the amount of}} airflow obstruction present and is generally carried out after {{the use of a}} bronchodilator, <b>a</b> <b>medication</b> to open up the airways. Two main components are measured to make the diagnosis: the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), which is the greatest volume of air that can be breathed out in the first second of a breath, and the forced vital capacity (FVC), which is the greatest volume of air that can be breathed out in a single large breath. Normally, 75–80% of the FVC comes out in the first second and a FEV1/FVC ratio of less than 70% in someone with symptoms of COPD defines a person as having the disease. Based on these measurements, spirometry would lead to over-diagnosis of COPD in the elderly. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence criteria additionally require a FEV1 of less than 80% of predicted. People with COPD also exhibit a decrease in diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) due to decreased surface area in the alveoli, as well as damage to the capillary bed.|$|E
