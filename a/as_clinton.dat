5|$|On March 30, 1780, Scott {{arrived in}} Charleston just <b>as</b> <b>Clinton</b> was laying siege to the city. He was {{captured}} {{when the city}} surrendered on May 12, 1780, and was held as {{a prisoner of war}} at Haddrell's Point near Charleston. Although he was a prisoner, he was given freedom to move within a six-mile radius and was allowed to correspond and trade with acquaintances in Virginia. With the death of William Woodford on November 13, 1780, he became primarily responsible for the welfare of the Virginia troops at Haddrell's Point. He requested his parole on account of ill health on January 30, 1781, and in late March, Charles Cornwallis granted the request.|$|E

5|$|Past NY281, NY222 crosses a {{commercial}} section of Cortlandville, passing several strip malls prior to entering {{the city of}} Cortland. Now named Groton Avenue, the route slowly curves eastward while traversing a residential part of the city. It passes north of the State University of New York at Cortland, and the campus marks {{the western edge of}} downtown Cortland. NY222 becomes {{a commercial}}ized street again, serving a pair of city blocks before intersecting with US 11 and NY41 (Main Street). US 11 and NY 41 join NY222, and the concurrency between the three routes heads east through downtown <b>as</b> <b>Clinton</b> Avenue. The overlap lasts for just one block, however, as NY222 ends upon intersecting NY13 at the next junction. NY13 northbound continues east along Clinton Avenue while NY13 southbound heads south along Church Street on an overlap with US11 and NY41.|$|E
5|$|The Clinton {{campaign}} had counted on winning the nomination by Super Tuesday and was unprepared financially and logistically for a prolonged effort; lagging in Internet fundraising <b>as</b> <b>Clinton</b> began loaning money to her campaign. There was continuous turmoil within the campaign staff {{and she made}} several top-level personnel changes. Obama won the next eleven February contests across the country, often by large margins and took a significant pledged delegate lead over Clinton. On March 4, Clinton broke the string of losses by winning in Ohio among other places, where her criticism of NAFTA, a major legacy of her husband's presidency, helped {{in a state where}} the trade agreement was unpopular. Throughout the campaign, Obama dominated caucuses, for which the Clinton campaign largely ignored preparation. Obama did well in primaries where African Americans or younger, college-educated, or more affluent voters were heavily represented; Clinton did well in primaries where Hispanics or older, non-college-educated, or working-class white voters predominated. Behind in delegates, Clinton's best hope of winning the nomination came in persuading uncommitted, party-appointed superdelegates.|$|E

25|$|The Druidic temple: A conical stone {{structure}} {{just east}} of the road south of the reservoir was said to be a site where local Druids practiced their rituals, and horrible things might come to pass for any intruder who looked too closely or came at the wrong time.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places <b>as</b> <b>Clinton</b> Furnace in 1976. It is currently fenced off by the Newark water department to prevent any entrance and the liability for injury that might result.|$|E
25|$|In 1825, Leavitt {{moved to}} New York City {{and went into}} {{business}} with his brother-in-law Daniel Appleton, who formerly worked as a Boston dry goods merchant but who had founded D. Appleton & Co., a large store on Exchange Place opposite the Customs House, to sell books. Appleton put up the capital for the founding of a publishing business with his brother-in-law Leavitt. The store on Exchange Place was divided into two sections, with Appleton's son William later taking charge of the bookselling functions. After five years of partnership, and feeling he could continue his business without further capital infusions from his brother-in-law, Jonathan Leavitt went into business for himself, opening a store at Broadway and John Streets and hiring George Palmer Putnam (then aged 16) as his apprentice and right-hand man. Appleton and his son subsequently moved their business to what was known <b>as</b> <b>Clinton</b> Hall, on Beekman Street, where they established themselves as well-known booksellers. With his partnership with Appleton dissolved, Leavitt became the leading publisher of religious and theological works in New York city.|$|E

25|$|Even though Clinton roughly {{received}} 3.1 {{million more}} votes than Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis had four years earlier, the Democrats recorded a 2.6 percentage point decrease in {{their share of}} the popular vote compared to 1988 due to the higher turnout. His 43% share of the popular vote was the second-lowest for any winning candidate in the 20th century after Woodrow Wilson in 1912 (41.8%). President Bush's 37.5% was the lowest percentage total for a sitting president seeking re-election since William Howard Taft, also in 1912 (23.2%); just like this one, the 1912 election was also a three-way race (that time between Taft, Woodrow Wilson, and Theodore Roosevelt). It was also the lowest percentage for a major-party candidate since Alf Landon received 36.5% of the vote in 1936. Bush had a lower percentage of the popular vote than even Herbert Hoover, who was defeated in 1932 (39.7%). However, none of these races included a major third candidate. As of the 2016 election, Bush has been the last president voted out of office after one term, <b>as</b> <b>Clinton,</b> George W. Bush, and Barack Obama were all re-elected to second terms in office.|$|E
500|$|Clinton's {{choice was}} criticized as {{unconventional}} because rather than picking {{a running mate}} who would diversify the ticket, Clinton chose a fellow Southerner who shared his political ideologies and who was nearly the same age <b>as</b> <b>Clinton.</b> The Washington Bureau Chief for The Baltimore Sun, Paul West, later suggested that, [...] "Al Gore revolutionized the way Vice Presidents are made. When he joined Bill Clinton's ticket, it violated the old rules. Regional diversity? Not with two Southerners from neighboring states. Ideological balance? A couple of left-of-center moderates. [...] And yet, Gore {{has come to be}} regarded by strategists in both parties as the best vice presidential pick in at least 20 years." ...|$|E
500|$|Clinton {{was elected}} Governor of Arkansas in 1978, having {{defeated}} the Republican candidate Lynn Lowe, a farmer from Texarkana. At age 32, {{he became the}} youngest governor in the country. Due to his youthful appearance, Clinton was often called the [...] "Boy Governor". He worked on educational reform and directed the maintenance of Arkansas's roads, with wife Hillary leading a successful committee on urban health care reform. However, his term included an unpopular motor vehicle tax and citizens' anger over the escape of Cuban refugees (from the Mariel boatlift) detained in Fort Chaffee in 1980. Monroe Schwarzlose of Kingsland in Cleveland County, polled 31percent of the vote against Clinton in the Democratic gubernatorial primary of 1980. Some suggested Schwarzlose's unexpected voter turnout foreshadowed Clinton's defeat by Republican challenger Frank D. White {{in the general election}} that year. <b>As</b> <b>Clinton</b> once joked, he was the youngest ex-governor in the nation's history.|$|E

500|$|On February 11, 1993, Janet Reno was {{nominated}} for the post. [...] Clinton had known of her since her days with the groundbreaking Miami Drug Court, where as state attorney she had worked with public defender and Clinton brother-in-law Hugh Rodham, but otherwise although qualified for the job had no federal experience and was relatively obscure. [...] Reno was 54 years old, had never married and had no children, and, <b>as</b> <b>Clinton</b> later wrote, [...] "Public service was her life." [...] Without {{the chance of a}} nanny problem, and with her mowing her own lawn reducing the chances for an immigrant problem, Reno was the perfect choice after the Baird and Wood failures. [...] In addition, Reno's down-to-earth image contrasted with the wealthy corporate lawyer Baird and the socially prominent Wood. [...] (Reno would instead face something often experienced by unmarried woman of her age, speculation about her sexual orientation.) ...|$|E

[...] But Lowey withdrew from consideration, as {{in the intervening years}} she had gained enough seniority {{to become one of the}} powerful [...] "cardinals" [...] on the House Appropriations Committee and did not want to relinquish that position. [...] When Caroline Kennedy announced her interest in the vacancy, comparisons were drawn to Clinton in 2000, with both being famous people seeking to hold elective office for the first time. [...] Others pointed out that Clinton had won election to the office while Kennedy would first be appointed. [...] In any case, Kennedy's effort soon faltered, in part due to not having the same desire or willingness to work for the seat <b>as</b> <b>Clinton</b> had had, and she soon withdrew as abruptly as she had entered.|$|E
500|$|Hartman first {{performed}} his Clinton {{impression on}} {{an episode of}} The Tonight Show. When he met Clinton in 1993 Hartman remarked, [...] "I guess I owe you a few apologies", adding later that he [...] "sometimes [...] a twinge of guilt about [...] ". Clinton showed good humor and sent Hartman a signed photo with the text: [...] "You're not the president, but you play one on TV. And you're OK, mostly." [...] For his Clinton impression, Hartman copied the president's [...] "post-nasal drip" [...] and the [...] "slight scratchiness" [...] in his voice, {{as well as his}} open, [...] "less intimidating" [...] hand gestures. Hartman opted against wearing a larger prosthetic nose when portraying Clinton, as he felt it would be distracting. He instead wore a wig, dyed his eyebrows brighter and used makeup to highlight his nose. One of Hartman's more famous sketches <b>as</b> <b>Clinton</b> saw the president visit a McDonald's restaurant and explain his policies by eating other customers' food. The writers told him that he was not eating enough during rehearsals for the sketch – {{by the end of the}} live performance, Hartman had eaten so much he could barely speak.|$|E
