Blyton published her last book in the Noddy series, Noddy and the Aeroplane, in February 1964.

25|$|The {{most common}} naming {{convention}} among Telugu Christians {{is the combination}} of the Telugu surname with an English or Biblical first name. Most Telugu Christians have English first names owing to the influence of British and American missionaries. Bilingual names are also common with the first name being an English name and the middle name usually being the Telugu translation of Christian virtues. An example of a Bilingual name is Lily Nirikshana where Lily is a common English name and Nirikshana is the Telugu translation of hope. There are also inter generational differences with respect to naming conventions. Telugu Christian names were more quintessentially British <b>among</b> <b>older</b> generations. The most common masculine first names <b>among</b> <b>older</b> Telugu Christians were George, Edward, Charles etc. The most common feminine first names <b>among</b> <b>older</b> Telugu Christians being Victoria, Daisy, Mary etc. Telugu translations of Christian virtues such as Krupa, Vyduryam, Deevena were also more common <b>among</b> <b>older</b> Telugu Christian women. Current naming trends have shifted towards more Biblical names such as John, Daniel or Rachel etc. However Bilingual names such as Mary Sucharita or Victor Premasagar are still common place among younger generations. Catholic names can also be easily distinguished from Protestant names as Catholic children as usually named after Patron saints. Until recent times, Telugu Christians along with other Telugu people followed the convention of family names preceding first names. This is no longer the norm.|$|E
