2500|$|An {{online survey}} which {{recruited}} participants {{over the internet}} concluded that prior {{to the arrival of}} widespread computer networking, most zoophiles would not have known other zoophiles, and for the most part, zoophiles engaged in bestiality secretly, or told only trusted friends, family or partners. The internet and its predecessors made people able to search for information on topics which were not otherwise easily accessible and to communicate with relative safety and <b>anonymity.</b> <b>Because</b> of the diary-like intimacy of blogs and the anonymity of the internet, zoophiles had the ideal opportunity to [...] "openly" [...] express their sexuality. As with many other alternate lifestyles, broader networks began forming in the 1980s when participating in networked social groups became more common at home and elsewhere. Such developments in general were described by Markoff in 1990; the linking of computers meant that people thousands of miles apart could feel the intimacy akin to being in a small village together. The popular newsgroup alt.sex.bestiality, said to be in the top 1% of newsgroup interest (i.e. number 50 out of around 5000), – and reputedly started in humor – along with personal bulletin boards and talkers, chief among them Sleepy's multiple worlds, Lintilla, and Planes of Existence, were among the first group media of this kind in the late 1980s and early 1990s. These groups rapidly drew together zoophiles, some of whom also created personal and social websites and internet forums. By around 1992–1994, the wide social net had evolved. This was initially centered around the above-mentioned newsgroup, alt.sex.bestiality, which during the six years following 1990 had matured into a discussion and support group. The newsgroup included information about health issues, laws governing zoophilia, bibliography relating to the subject, and community events. Since the 1990s, other zoophile websites have been created and have grown in size; for example, the zoophile website and internet forum [...] "beastforum.com" [...] has more than one million members as of March 2012.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — E-cash {{algorithms}} offer strong protection on principal anonymity, transaction {{authenticity and}} quota enforcement of credit dispense {{but as of}} {{now there is no}} study on how to integrate them with the resource allocation schemes. In this paper, we propose a hypercube based tracking system for both credit dispense and resource allocation of computing assets using E-cash algorithms. Hypercube is chosen as the common references of the two major functions, so that the study results can be tailored {{for a wide range of}} data structures that could be used for both purposes. Based on the N-divisibility framework of disposable authentication, we develop the analysis techniques to assess the security properties using hypercube to track credit spending and for subcube allocation for two different schemes. The first scheme is highly secure yet has high computing costs. On the other hand, the second scheme can achieve the same security goals at much lower computing costs by relaxing anonymity protection rules but adding a simple anonymity hazard checking routine before a subcube can be spent/allocated. Anonymity hazard refers to the condition that the unique secret (commonly called the identity) assigned to a token can be deciphered from messages generated from transactions even when no double spending occurs. Simulations results show that well known subcube allocation schemes binary code and binary gray code are free of <b>anonymity</b> hazards <b>because</b> of their restrictive allocation rules. Anonymity hazards can occur to an unrestricted subcube allocation scheme if the anonymity hazard checking routine is not devised. Our study suggests that by decoupling of credit management and resource management, highly secure and efficient computing resource management schemes can be developed based on one integrated framework...|$|R

40|$|From 1 April 2005, UK law {{was changed}} to allow {{children}} born through gamete donation to access identifying details of the donor. The decision to abolish donor anonymity was strongly influenced by a discourse that asserted the 'child's right-to-know' their genetic origins. Under the current regulation, if would-be parents want to receive treatment in the UK, they have {{no option but to}} use gametes/embryos from identifiable donors. For a majority, this also means that they will be on lengthy waiting lists due to the donor shortage. Interestingly, the voice of would-be parents - those who would be most affected by a contraction in donor supply and would carry the burden of informing children of their origins, should they so choose- were not heard during the donor anonymity debate or thereafter. Adopting a social constructionist approach, this thesis studies removal of donor anonymity as a social problem and examines why would-be parents remained silent during the public debate. There are two major steps taken: first, examining the donor anonymity debate in the public realm through media presentations, and secondly investigating would-be parents' reactions through ethnographic studies: a virtual ethnography study and interviews. The accounts of a sub-group of would-be parents reveal that having a donor-conceived child constitutes a permanent charge of deviance against the family. Many would-be parents were reluctant to raise their voices during the donor <b>anonymity</b> debate <b>because</b> {{they did not want to}} be exposed to publicity. Their reluctance to mobilise around pressing claims against the removal of donor anonymity reflects the variety of ways in which they can avoid the impact of this legislation. The thesis concludes by underlining the importance of having an informed public debate about the disclosure policy, and of developing mechanisms to protect both would-be parents' and of developing mechanisms to protect both would-be parents' and donor offspring's interests...|$|R
40|$|Anonymity, {{which is}} more and more {{important}} to multi-receiver schemes, has been taken into consideration by many researchers recently. To protect the receiver anonymity, in 2010, the first multi-receiver scheme based on the Lagrange interpolating polynomial was proposed. To ensure the sender's anonymity, the concept of the ring signature was proposed in 2005, but afterwards, this scheme was proven to has some weakness and at the same time, a completely anonymous multi-receiver signcryption scheme is proposed. In this completely anonymous scheme, the sender anonymity is achieved by improving the ring signature, and the receiver anonymity is achieved by also using the Lagrange interpolating polynomial. Unfortunately, the Lagrange interpolation method was proven a failure to protect the <b>anonymity</b> of receivers, <b>because</b> each authorized receiver could judge whether anyone else is authorized or not. Therefore, the completely anonymous multi-receiver signcryption mentioned above can only protect the sender anonymity. In this paper, we propose a new completely anonymous multi-receiver signcryption scheme with a new polynomial technology used to replace the Lagrange interpolating polynomial, which can mix the identity information of receivers to save it as a ciphertext element and prevent the authorized receivers from verifying others. With the receiver anonymity, the proposed scheme also owns the anonymity of the sender at the same time. Meanwhile, the decryption fairness and public verification are also provided...|$|R
