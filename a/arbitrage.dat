5|$|The {{equilibrium}} {{that results}} from the relationship between forward and spot exchange rates {{within the context of}} covered interest rate parity is responsible for eliminating or correcting for market inefficiencies that would create potential for <b>arbitrage</b> profits. As such, <b>arbitrage</b> opportunities are fleeting. In order for this equilibrium to hold under differences in interest rates between two countries, the forward exchange rate must generally differ from the spot exchange rate, such that a no-arbitrage condition is sustained. Therefore, the forward rate is said to contain a premium or discount, reflecting the interest rate differential between two countries. The following equations demonstrate how the forward premium or discount is calculated.|$|E

5|$|Another {{effect of}} the common European {{currency}} is that differences in prices—in particular in price levels—should decrease because {{of the law of}} one price. Differences in prices can trigger <b>arbitrage,</b> i.e., speculative trade in a commodity across borders purely to exploit the price differential. Therefore, prices on commonly traded goods are likely to converge, causing inflation in some regions and deflation in others during the transition. Some evidence of this has been observed in specific eurozone markets.|$|E

5|$|Interest rate parity is a no-arbitrage {{condition}} representing an {{equilibrium state}} under which investors will be indifferent to interest rates available on bank deposits in two countries. The {{fact that this}} condition does not always hold allows for potential opportunities to earn riskless profits from covered interest <b>arbitrage.</b> Two assumptions central to interest rate parity are capital mobility and perfect substitutability of domestic and foreign assets. Given foreign exchange market equilibrium, the interest rate parity condition implies that the expected return on domestic assets will equal the exchange rate-adjusted expected return on foreign currency assets. Investors then cannot earn <b>arbitrage</b> profits by borrowing {{in a country with}} a lower interest rate, exchanging for foreign currency, and investing in a foreign country with a higher interest rate, due to gains or losses from exchanging back to their domestic currency at maturity. Interest rate parity takes on two distinctive forms: uncovered interest rate parity refers to the parity condition in which exposure to foreign exchange risk (unanticipated changes in exchange rates) is uninhibited, whereas covered interest rate parity refers to the condition in which a forward contract has been used to cover (eliminate exposure to) exchange rate risk. Each form of the parity condition demonstrates a unique relationship with implications for the forecasting of future exchange rates: the forward exchange rate and the future spot exchange rate.|$|E
40|$|When {{modeling}} discriminatory {{trade policies}} [...] such as targeted embargoes, selective quotas, targeted export or import subsidies, or preferential trading agreements [...] failure to explicitly include assumptions about <b>arbitraging</b> behavior may yield to misleading results. Quadratic programming (QP), Non Linear Programming (NLP), and Vector Sandwich (VS) models implicitly set the rules regarding {{the possibility of}} simultaneous exporting and importing. The result is that many analysis using these models may lead to poor results because the models contain implicit limits on <b>arbitraging</b> which may be at variance with the actual policies and/or country behavior. The paper introduces an alternative spatial model. Its main features are that countries are allowed to switch {{from one side of}} the market to the other as prices change, and that the researcher is allowed to explicitly incorporate her own assumptions about <b>arbitraging</b> and/or obtain different possible solutions as a function of different policy constraints or different levels of effectiveness in enforcing such constraints. Two numerical examples, one addressing the 1980 US embargo to USSR, the other, constructed, involving preferential trading, show how the results obtained using the proposed model compare with those obtained by applying the most frequently used spatial trade models.

5|$|Alternatively, where a {{suitable}} {{head of water}} is not available, pumped-storage hydroelectricity {{or other forms of}} grid energy storage such as compressed air energy storage and thermal energy storage can store energy developed by high-wind periods and release it when needed. The type of storage needed depends on the wind penetration level – low penetration requires daily storage, and high penetration requires both short and long term storage – as long as a month or more. Stored energy increases the economic value of wind energy since it can be shifted to displace higher cost generation during peak demand periods. The potential revenue from this <b>arbitrage</b> can offset the cost and losses of storage. For example, in the UK, the 1.7 GW Dinorwig pumped-storage plant evens out electrical demand peaks, and allows base-load suppliers to run their plants more efficiently. Although pumped-storage power systems are only about 75% efficient, and have high installation costs, their low running costs and ability to reduce the required electrical base-load can save both fuel and total electrical generation costs.|$|E
5|$|Although the U.S. {{administration}} has denied that devaluing their currency {{was part of}} their objectives for implementing quantitative easing, the practice can act to devalue a country's currency in two indirect ways. Firstly, it can encourage speculators to bet that the currency will decline in value. Secondly, the large increase in the domestic money supply will lower domestic interest rates, often they will become much lower than interest rates in countries not practising quantitative easing. This creates the conditions for a carry trade, where market participants can engage in a form of <b>arbitrage,</b> borrowing in the currency of the country practising quantitative easing, and lending {{in a country with}} a relatively high rate of interest. Because they are effectively selling the currency being used for quantitative easing on the international markets, this can increase the supply of the currency and hence push down its value. By October 2010 expectations in the markets were high that the United States, UK, and Japan would soon embark on a second round of QE, with the prospects for the Eurozone to join them less certain.|$|E

5|$|In {{standard}} {{models of}} international trade a fall {{in the price of}} a country's export good – a deterioration in its terms of trade – generally decreases the home country's welfare. In the Brander–Spencer model however the opposite is true. This is because in this model the markets are not perfectly competitive and the revenue from the expanded quantity sold compensates the firm for the revenue lost from the lower export price. If the good produced by the firm is also consumed domestically however the result is a bit more complicated. In the case where the firm is able to separate the home and export market (charge different prices in each with no possibility of third party <b>arbitrage)</b> then the level of the optimal subsidies will depend on whether marginal costs of production are constant, increasing or decreasing. The optimal subsidy level is either the same, higher or lower, respectively, compared to the level with no domestic consumption. This underscores the need {{on the part of the}} government for very precise information on industry structure and firm's cost functions.|$|E
5|$|RIRP {{rests on}} several assumptions, {{including}} efficient markets, no country risk premia, and zero {{change in the}} expected real exchange rate. The parity condition suggests that real interest rates will equalize between countries and that capital mobility will result in capital flows that eliminate opportunities for <b>arbitrage.</b> There exists strong evidence that RIRP holds tightly among emerging markets in Asia and also Japan. The half-life period of deviations from RIRP have been examined by researchers and found to be roughly six or seven months, but between two and three months for certain countries. Such variation in the half-lives of deviations may be reflective of differences {{in the degree of}} financial integration among the country groups analyzed. RIRP does not hold over short time horizons, but empirical evidence has demonstrated that it generally holds well across long time horizons of five to ten years.|$|E
5|$|The forward {{exchange}} rate (also referred to as forward rate or forward price) is the exchange rate at which a bank agrees to exchange one currency for another at a future date when it enters into a forward contract with an investor. Multinational corporations, banks, and other financial institutions enter into forward contracts {{to take advantage of}} the forward rate for hedging purposes. The {{forward exchange}} rate is determined by a parity relationship among the spot exchange rate and differences in interest rates between two countries, which reflects an economic equilibrium in the foreign exchange market under which <b>arbitrage</b> opportunities are eliminated. When in equilibrium, and when interest rates vary across two countries, the parity condition implies that the forward rate includes a premium or discount reflecting the interest rate differential. Forward exchange rates have important theoretical implications for forecasting future spot exchange rates. Financial economists have put forth a hypothesis that the forward rate accurately predicts the future spot rate, for which empirical evidence is mixed.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{absence of}} <b>arbitrages</b> {{of the first}} kind, a {{weakening}} of the “No Free Lunch with Vanishing Risk ” condition of [2], is analyzed in a general semimartingale financial market model. In {{the spirit of the}} Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing, it is shown that there is equivalence between the absence of <b>arbitrages</b> of the first kind and the existence of a strictly positive process that acts as a local martingale deflator on nonnegative wealth processes. One of the cornerstones of Mathematical Finance theory is the celebrated Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing (FTAP) that connects the economically sound notion of absence of opportunities for riskless profit with the mathematical condition of the existence of a probability measure, equivalent to the real-world one, that makes the discounted asset prices have some kind of martingale property...|$|R
