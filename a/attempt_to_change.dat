5|$|The {{rejection}} by publishers of his 1994 manuscript about illegal immigration and epidemics prompted Savage {{to record a}} demo tape with a mock radio talk show about {{the contents of the}} work. He mailed this tape to 250 radio stations in an <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> careers and become a radio talk show host. On March 21, 1994, Savage began his radio career on KGO (a San Francisco news/talk radio station) as a fill-in host for the liberal Ray Taliaferro and later as a weekend host.|$|E

5|$|National {{legislation}} {{requires that}} all television programmes broadcasts in Croatia {{are made in}} Croatian language or with appropriate translations either using dubbing or subtitling. In general, all foreign programming is subtitled, except for cartoons and narrated parts of documentaries and similar programmes. An <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> this was made by Nova TV in 2006, when a soap opera was dubbed, but the move provoked negative response from viewers and critics, causing the experiment to be abandoned. The legislation does not provide for mutually intelligible languages. That led to formal requests made by the Electronic Media Council demanding language localisation of television programmes made in Serbian language. Ultimately, that issue was resolved through subtitling using teletext service normally used for closed captioning.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Riley Marshall (March 14, 1854– June 1, 1925) was an American Democratic {{politician}} {{who served as}} the 28th Vice President of the United States from 1913 to 1921. A prominent lawyer in Indiana, he became an active and well known member of the Indiana Democratic Party by stumping across the state for other candidates and organizing party rallies that later helped him win election as the 27th Governor of Indiana. In office, he proposed a controversial and progressive state constitution and pressed for other progressive era reforms. The Republican minority used the state courts to block the <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> the constitution.|$|E
5|$|The dispute {{escalated}} when Baldwin deprived {{the monks}} {{of some of}} the revenues of their monastic estates. After that, Baldwin proposed to establish a church dedicated to Becket in Canterbury itself, staffed by secular rather than monastic clergy. The monks of the cathedral chapter saw this proposed foundation as the first step in an <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> the see of Canterbury from a monastic cathedral chapter, a peculiarity of the English Church, to the more normal pattern of secular clergy. It is not clear if Baldwin himself intended such a plan, but the other bishops supported the effort, as contemporary writers made clear. Baldwin sought the advice of Hugh, the Bishop of Lincoln, who advised Baldwin to abandon the plan as it would only cause distress to all parties. The controversy was long and involved and, at one point, the monks were imprisoned within their own buildings {{for a year and a}} half, from January 1188 to August 1189. This led to the suspension of the liturgy in the cathedral. Eventually all the prominent ecclesiastics and monastic houses of Europe were forced into choosing sides in the dispute. In October 1189, in an attempt to gain control, Baldwin appointed Roger Norreys as the chapter's prior, an appointment widely acknowledged by contemporaries as putting a useless individual into the office. His plan for financing the church involved soliciting contributions from donors by promising a one-third reduction in penances for annual donations.|$|E

However it was not successful in amending the constitution.|$|E

25|$|Cloud seeding, a form {{of weather}} modification, is the <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> the amount or type of {{precipitation}} that falls from clouds, by dispersing substances into the air that serve as cloud condensation or ice nuclei, which alter the microphysical processes within the cloud. The usual intent is to increase precipitation but hail and fog suppression are also widely practiced in airports. The method's use has ranged from increasing precipitation in areas experiencing drought to removing radioactive particles from clouds. Cloud seeding was discovered by Vincent Schaefer in 1946.|$|E

Although from the same cultural family as Sămănătorul, the Poporanist theorist Constantin Stere was dismissed by Iorga's articles, despite Sadoveanu's attempts to settle the matter.|$|E
25|$|Rational {{design of}} a protein relies on an {{in-depth}} knowledge of the protein structure, {{as well as its}} catalytic mechanism.
