25|$|The Nunchuk can be {{connected}} to any microcontroller capable of I²C (e.g., Arduino's Atmel AVR), where the accelerometer, joystick and buttons data may be accessed. Todbot has created the Wiichuck, an adapter to facilitate connecting the Nunchuk to an <b>Arduino</b> board.|$|E
25|$|By the mid 2000s {{open-source}} hardware again {{became a}} hub of activity {{due to the}} emergence of several major open-source hardware projects and companies, such as OpenCores, RepRap (3D printing), <b>Arduino,</b> Adafruit and SparkFun. In 2007, Perens reactivated the openhardware.org website.|$|E
25|$|Open {{hardware}} {{companies are}} experimenting with different business models. In one example, littleBits implements open-source business models by making the design files available for the circuit designs in each littleBits module, {{in accordance with the}} CERN Open Hardware License Version 1.2. In another example, <b>Arduino</b> has registered its name as a trademark. Others may manufacture their designs but can't put the <b>Arduino</b> name on them. Thus they can distinguish their products from others by appellation. There are many applicable business models for implementing some open-source hardware even in traditional firms. For example, to accelerate development and technical innovation the photovoltaic industry has experimented with partnerships, franchises, secondary supplier and completely open-source models.|$|E
25|$|Gertboard – A Raspberry Pi Foundation sanctioned device, {{designed}} for educational purposes, that expands the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins to allow interface with {{and control of}} LEDs, switches, analog signals, sensors and other devices. It also includes an optional <b>Arduino</b> compatible controller to interface with the Pi.|$|E
25|$|However, in 1514 <b>Arduino</b> degli Arriguzzi {{proposed}} a revised {{plan in the}} form of a Latin cross with the intent to outdo even Saint Peter's Basilica of Rome, the greatest church of the Western Christian world even in its ancient version. According to tradition, Pope Pius IV halted such a majestic project.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, the Frontier Nerds of NYU's ITP program {{published}} a thorough tutorial titled How To Hack Toy EEGs. The tutorial, which stirred {{the minds of}} many budding DIY BCI enthusiasts, demonstrated how to create a single channel at-home EEG with an <b>Arduino</b> and a Mattel Mindflex at a very reasonable price. This tutorial amplified the DIY BCI movement.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} many VJs working with {{experimental}} approaches {{to working with}} live video. Open source graphical programming environments (such as Pure Data) are often used to create custom software interfaces for performances, or to connect experimental devices to their computer for processing live data (for example, the IBVA EEG-reading brainwave unit, the <b>Arduino</b> microprocessor, or circuit bending children's toys).|$|E
25|$|Open-source {{microcontroller}} (<b>Arduino)</b> and single-board computer (Raspberry Pi) platforms have kick-started {{public interest}} in hackerspaces and initiated a maker culture all over the world. Social transformations are expected as collaborative innovation through cost-effective manufacturing facilities using 3D printing, laser cutting and CNC machining which are already helping home-based entrepreneurs to rapidly prototype crowdsourced products and measure product attractivity through crowdfunding mechanisms.|$|E
25|$|In 2014, OpenBCI {{released}} an eponymous open source brain-computer interface after a successful kickstarter campaign in 2013. The basic OpenBCI has 8 channels, expandable to 16, and supports EEG, EKG, and EMG. The OpenBCI {{is based on}} the Texas Instruments ADS1299 IC and the <b>Arduino</b> or PIC microcontroller, and costs $399 for the basic version. It uses standard metal cup electrodes and conductive paste.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} popular types of {{open-source}} hardware is electronics. There are numerous companies that provide large varieties of open-source electronics such as Sparkfun, Adafruit and Seeed. In addition, there are NPOs and companies that provide a specific open-source electronic component such as the <b>Arduino</b> electronics prototyping platform. There are numerous examples of speciality open-source electronics such as low-cost voltage and current GMAW open-source 3-D printer monitor and a robotics-assisted mass spectrometry assay platform. Open-source electronics finds various uses, including automation of chemical procedures.|$|E
25|$|HAT (Hardware Attached on Top) {{expansion}} boardsTogether {{with the}} ModelB+, {{inspired by the}} <b>Arduino</b> shield boards, the interface for HAT boards was devised by the Raspberry Pi Foundation. Each HAT board carries a small EEPROM (typically a CAT24C32WI-GT3) containing the relevant details of the board, so that the Raspberry Pi's OS is informed of the HAT, and the technical details of it, relevant to the OS using the HAT. Mechanical details of a HAT board, that use the four mounting holes in their rectangular formation, are available online.|$|E
25|$|A second satellite, the Atmospheric Neutral Density Experiment (ANDE-2), {{is part of}} a United States Department of Defense project {{flown by}} the Naval Research Laboratory to provide {{high-quality}} satellites, and will measure the density and composition of the low Earth orbit atmosphere while being tracked from the ground, to better predict the movement and decay of objects in orbit. ANDE-2 consists of two spherical microsatellites, ANDE Active spacecraft (Castor) and the ANDE Passive spacecraft (Pollux), and will be tracked by the International Laser Ranging Service (ILRS) network as well as the Space Surveillance Network (SSN). One of the satellites, Pollux, is running <b>Arduino</b> libraries, with its payload programmed and built by students.|$|E
25|$|BCA's {{strengths}} are in its academics, extracurricular activities, and notable faculty, {{many of whom}} hold doctorates {{in their}} respective fields. While offering some 16 AP courses, BCA does not focus on them. Led by a faculty of which 20% hold PhDs, students at BCA enjoy courses that often surpass AP courses in technical rigor and creativity, such as Series Hybrids & Electric Vehicles, Civil Engineering & Architecture, Cybersecurity, Digital Electronics, Optics & Lasers, <b>Arduino</b> Microcontroller, Modern Optical Physics, Advanced Problems in Music Theory & Technology, Comparative Asian Cultures, Microscopy, Forensic Science, Biopsychology, Foundations of Nanotechnology, Interactive Design, Robotics, Stagecraft, Medical Microbiology, BioEngineering, Markets & Trading, Zoology, Acting Methods, Bioethics, Java, Python, Anatomy & Physiology, Organic Chemistry, Macroeconomics & International Economics, Advanced Business Topics, Entrepreneurship, and Culinology.|$|E
25|$|While {{offering}} some 16 AP courses, BCA {{does not}} focus on them. This often hurts its placement in rankings with methodologies that place great weight on the test-driven, college level courses. BCA has traditionally given teachers great freedom in curriculum design to adequately engage the intellectual capacity of the student body. Courses thus often surpass AP courses in technical rigor and creativity, such as Series Hybrids & Electric Vehicles, Civil Engineering & Architecture, Cybersecurity, Digital Electronics, Optics & Lasers, <b>Arduino</b> Microcontroller, Modern Optical Physics, Advanced Problems in Music Theory & Technology, Comparative Asian Cultures, Microscopy, Forensic Science, Biopsychology, Foundations of Nanotechnology, Interactive Design, Robotics, Stagecraft, Medical Microbiology, BioEngineering, Markets & Trading, Zoology, Acting Methods, Bioethics, Java, Python, Anatomy & Physiology, Organic Chemistry, Macroeconomics & International Economics, Advanced Business Topics, Entrepreneurship, and Culinology.|$|E

2500|$|The {{modern science}} of geology {{developed}} in the 18th century, the term [...] "geology" [...] itself was popularised by the Encyclopédie of 1751. Steno's categorisation of strata was expanded by several geologists, including Johann Gottlob Lehmann who believed that the oldest mountains had formed early in the Creation, and categorised as Flötz-Gebürge stratified mountains with few ore deposits but with thin layers containing fossils, overlain by a third category of superficial deposits. In his 1756 publication he identified 30 different layers in this category which he attributed to {{the action of the}} Genesis Deluge, possibly including debris from the older mountains. Others including Giovanni <b>Arduino</b> attributed secondary strata to natural causes: Georg Christian Füchsel said that geologists had to take as standard the processes in which nature currently produces solids, [...] "we know no other way", and only the most recent deposits could be attributed to a great Flood.|$|E
