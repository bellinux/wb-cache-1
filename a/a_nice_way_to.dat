25|$|Hirano et al. {{previously}} {{found that}} the newborns {{did not have a}} true lamina propria, but instead had cellular regions called maculae flavae, located at the anterior and posterior ends of the loose vocal fold tissue. Boseley and Hartnick examined at the development and maturation of pediatric human vocal fold lamina propria. Hartnick {{was the first one to}} define each layer by a change in their cellular concentration. He also {{found that the}} lamina propria monolayer at birth and shortly thereafter was hypercellular, thus confirming Hirano’s observations. By 2 months of age, the vocal fold started differentiating into a bilaminar structure of distinct cellular concentration, with the superficial layer being less densely populated than the deeper layer. By 11 months, a three-layered structure starts to be noted in some specimens, again with different cellular population densities. The superficial layer is still hypocellular, followed by an intermediate more hypercellular layer, and a deeper hypercellular layer, just above the vocalis muscle. Even though the VF seem to start organizing, this is not representative of the trilaminar structure seen in adult tissues, where the layer are defined by their differential elastin and collagen fiber compositions. By 7 years of age, all specimens show a three-layered vocal fold structure, based on cellular population densities. At this point, the superficial layer was still hypocellular, the middle layer was the hypercellualr one, with also a greater content of elastin and collagen fibers, and the deeper layer was less cellularly populated. Again, the distinction seen between the layers at this stage is not comparable to that seen in the adult tissue. The maturation of the VF did not appear before 13 years of age, where the layers could be defined by their differential fiber composition rather than by their differential cellular population. The pattern now show a hypocellular superficial layer, followed by a middle layer composed predominantly of elastin fiber, and a deeper layer composed predominantly of collagen fibers. This pattern can be seen in older specimens up to 17 years of age, and above. While this study offers <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> see the evolution from immature to mature VF, it still does not explain what is the mechanism behind it.|$|E

The touches such as the real-time event and voicing were appreciated, but their implementation left much to be desired. However, the medal collection is <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> compete with friends and the reviewer enjoyed the game. Dragon Warriors English remake, {{as part of the}} dual GBC cartridge Dragon WarriorI&II, received better reviews than the original, garnering praise. IGN and Nintendo Power gave it an 8 out of 10. IGN's Marc Nix noted that while [...] "it's one of the only interesting RPGs on the Game Boy Color to actually make American shores", players will feel frustrated; those who played the original will lament the changes, while new players will feel that the game is too linear and simple. GameSpot gave it a 9.6 out of 10, citing the great improvements to sound quality and the appeal of playing both games in succession, and GameRankings reports an 83.46% overall score. It received RPGamer's Game Boy Color Award of the Year for 2000. [...] Comparing it to its NES counterpart, RPGamer's Derek Cavin awarded it 3 out of 5, and wrote that the game is above average in all aspects, and particularly praised the visual elements. He criticized the game's repetitiveness, and said that it is short enough that most players should finish the game before repetition becomes an issue. Combined, both the SNES and GBC remakes saw more than 1.94million copies sold worldwide. With the remakes' good sales performances, Enix released Dragon WarriorIII for the GBC in 2001, which was based on a previously unreleased SNES update of Dragon QuestIII English version.|$|E
