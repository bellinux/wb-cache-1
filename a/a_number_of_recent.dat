25|$|Schopenhauer has had {{a massive}} {{influence}} upon later thinkers, though more so in the arts (especially literature and music) and psychology than in philosophy. His popularity peaked {{in the early twentieth}} century, especially during the Modernist era, and waned somewhat thereafter. Nevertheless, <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>recent</b> publications have reinterpreted and modernised the study of Schopenhauer. His theory is also being explored by some modern philosophers as a precursor to evolutionary theory and modern evolutionary psychology.|$|E

There is now a clinic and a pharmacy to serve the monks, as well as a spacious retreat center for conferences and a large, two story guesthouse that was opened in January 1981.|$|E

25|$|A third view, {{presented}} in <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>recent</b> evaluations, is that Jutland, {{the last major}} fleet action between battleships, illustrated the irrelevance of battleship fleets following {{the development of the}} submarine, mine and torpedo. In this view, the most important consequence of Jutland was the decision of the Germans to engage in unrestricted submarine warfare. Although large numbers of battleships were constructed in the decades between the wars, {{it has been argued that}} this outcome reflected the social dominance among naval decision-makers of battleship advocates who constrained technological choices to fit traditional paradigms of fleet action. Battleships played a relatively minor role in World War II, in which the submarine and aircraft carrier emerged as the dominant offensive weapons of naval warfare.|$|E

In 2013, the Student Services Centre, which is a {{single point of contact}} for all non-academic enquiries, was opened in the Windsor Building. The Drama Department expanded its performance space {{with the opening of the}} Caryl Churchill Theatre, which seats almost 200 audience members across two levels and has a third floor for technical operation, in 2013. The department also uses the onsite 19th-century boilerhouse, which was converted into a performance space with a sprung dance floor in 2014.|$|E
500|$|While critic Simon Reynolds {{says the}} style {{was tied to}} Southern California and its culture, Trainer says the style [...] "arguably" [...] emerged from {{numerous}} simultaneous scenes inhabited by artists working in a diverse form of [...] "post-noise neo-psychedelia". Reynolds identifies Pink, Clark, and Ferraro as the [...] "godparents of hypnagogic". He also singled out Pink as the central figure {{to what he calls}} the [...] "Altered Zones Generation", an umbrella term he designed for lo-fi, retro-inspired indie artists who were commonly featured on Altered Zones, a sister site for Pitchfork. Pink gained recognition in the mid 2000s through a string of self-produced albums, pioneering a sound that Reynolds calls [...] "'70s radio-rock and '80s new wave as if heard through a defective transistor radio, glimmers of melody flickering {{in and out of the}} fog". Tiny Mix Tapes Jordan Redmond wrote that Pink's early collaborator John Maus was also placed [...] "at the nexus of <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>recent</b> popular movements" [...] including hypnagogic pop, and that Maus was as [...] "much of a progenitor of this sound as Pink, even though Pink has tended to be the headline-grabber." ...|$|E

2500|$|Yahweh-worship was famously aniconic, {{meaning that}} the god was not {{depicted}} by a statue or other image. This {{is not to say}} that he was not represented in some symbolic form, and early Israelite worship probably focused on standing stones, but according to the Biblical texts the temple in Jerusalem featured Yahweh's throne in the form of two cherubim, their inner wings forming the seat and a box (the Ark of the Covenant) as a footstool, while the throne itself was empty. No satisfactory explanation of Israelite aniconism has been advanced, and <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>recent</b> scholars have argued that Yahweh was in fact represented prior to the reforms of Hezekiah and Josiah late in the monarchic period: to quote one recent study, [...] "n early aniconism, de facto or otherwise, is purely a projection of the post-exilic imagination" [...] (MacDonald, 2007).|$|E

Her account {{of the life of the}} Imperial Family of Austria, simple, unaffected, home-like; her picture of the good old Emperor, dining quietly off a cold potato and sitting after dinner playing softly to himself on the flute, while his attendants gently withdrew one by one from his presence; her description of merry, boisterous, large-hearted Prince Stefan Karl, who kept the whole court in a perpetual roar all the time by asking such riddles as [...] "When is a sailor not a sailor?"
