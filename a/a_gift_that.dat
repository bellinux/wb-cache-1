25|$|In {{a limited}} number of cases, an {{agreement}} will be unenforceable unless it meets a certain form prescribed by statute. While contracts can be generally made without formality, some transactions are thought to require form either because it makes a person think carefully before they bind themselves to an agreement, or merely that it serves as clear evidence. This goes typically for large engagements, including the sale of land, a lease of property over three years, a consumer credit agreement, and a bill of exchange. A contract for guarantee must also, at some stage, be evidenced in writing. Finally, English law takes the approach that a gratuitous promise, as a matter of contract law, is not legally binding. While <b>a</b> <b>gift</b> <b>that</b> is delivered will transfer property irrevocably, and while someone may always bind themselves to a promise without anything in return to deliver a thing in future if they sign a deed that is witnessed, a simple promise to do something in future can be revoked. This result is reached, with some complexity, through a peculiarity of English law called the doctrine of consideration.|$|E

While {{most of the}} gigs were booked in North America, two dates—July 4 and 5—were in London's Roundhouse venue and Dingwalls, respectively. Linda Stein pushed to make these events happen, setting up the band performances in the UK during the United States Bicentennial. Fields relates: [...] "On the two-hundredth anniversary of our freedom, we were bringing Great Britain <b>a</b> <b>gift</b> <b>that</b> was forever going to disrupt their sensibilities." [...] The band sold out for their first London performance, with an audience of roughly 3,000. Leigh described the Dingwalls gig as very similar to performances at CBGB. Likewise, these venues {{would go on to}} be headlined by other punk bands like the Clash and Sex Pistols. The band performed over 100 concerts the following year.|$|E

500|$|The author {{describes}} his experiences {{growing up in}} a church that, despite preaching about grace, did not demonstrate it to others; the church excluded African Americans, dismissed other Christians on the basis of slightly different beliefs, and depicted God as tyrannical and vengeful. Yancey writes, [...] "I grew up with the strong impression that a person became spiritual by attending to grey-area rules," [...] and that church was a place to look good rather than be honest. He contrasts the teachings of early Christians Pelagius and Augustine of Hippo on the subject of grace, with Pelagius believing that divine grace must be earned and Augustine contending that grace is <b>a</b> <b>gift</b> <b>that</b> cannot be earned. Pelagius was declared a heretic by his peers; Augustine was canonized. According to Yancey, many Christians follow Pelagius's teaching on grace during the week but espouse Augustine's on Sunday.|$|E

Some of the provisions of his will are known: he left some jewellery and gems to the king, some of his lands were given to his successors as bishop, and other lands and items were bequeathed to his cathedral chapter at Chichester. He also endowed a distribution of bread to the poor residents of Chichester, <b>a</b> <b>gift</b> <b>that</b> continued into the 20th century.

Lasorda become known for his die-hard Dodgers clichés, such as describing the color of his blood by saying [...] "Cut me, I bleed Dodger blue."

2500|$|The {{concept of}} gifting {{with regards to}} body parts or fluids was first {{analyzed}} by Richard Titmuss in his book titled The Gift Relationship: from Human Blood to Social Policy. Here the author highlights {{the negative effects of}} compensating blood donors and the benefits of maintaining a system where the donation of body tissues and fluids is seen in the form of <b>a</b> <b>gift</b> <b>that</b> is voluntarily and altruistically given to society. Titmuss (1971) draws from Mauss's (1950) publication, , to argue that when blood is given {{in the form of a}} gift, collective social relations are formed to maintain a sense of community. [...] Titmuss follows Mauss' (1950) ideas of gift giving as a system of total services (production, distribution, and consumption) where self-interest interacts with social and moral obligations that are collectively imposed to maintain social relationships and guarantee the reproduction of society.|$|E
2500|$|One {{recurring}} {{mention is}} of a changeling or faerie {{who has a}} prodigious talent for music.

Commenting on the appearance of the faerie, the story teller recounts that he saw him living with two old brothers beyond the [...] "dogs well" [...] and he looked like a [...] "wizened wee monkey" ...the story teller estimates his age to be around 10 or 11 years but it appears that he could still could not walk, rather, [...] "bobbed".

2500|$|While not {{at school}} or college, Byron {{lived with his mother}} at Burgage Manor in Southwell, Nottinghamshire. Although there was some {{antagonism}} between mother and son, Byron cultivated friendships with Elizabeth Pigot and her brother, John, with whom he staged two plays for the delight of the community, along with Augusta Mary Byron, his half-sister. During this time, with the help of Elizabeth Pigot, who copied many of his rough drafts, he was encouraged to write his first volumes of poetry. Fugitive Pieces was the first, printed by Ridge of Newark, which contained poems written when Byron was only 14. [...] However, it was promptly recalled and burned on the advice of his friend, the Reverend Thomas Becher, on account of its more amorous verses, particularly the poem [...] "To Mary".

2500|$|Hildegard {{said that}} she first saw [...] "The Shade of the Living Light" [...] {{at the age of}} three, and by the age of five she began to {{understand}} that she was experiencing visions. She used the term 'visio' to this feature of her experience, and recognized that it was <b>a</b> <b>gift</b> <b>that</b> she could not explain to others. Hildegard explained that she saw all things in the light of God through the five senses: sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch. Hildegard was hesitant to share her visions, confiding only to Jutta, who in turn told Volmar, Hildegard's tutor and, later, secretary. Throughout her life, she continued to have many visions, and in 1141, at the age of 42, Hildegard received a vision she believed to be an instruction from God, to [...] "write down that which you see and hear." [...] Still hesitant to record her visions, Hildegard became physically ill.

2500|$|Education of the Princess (1622–1625) shows a {{maturing}} Marie de' Medici at study. Her {{education is}} given a divine grace {{by the presence of}} three gods Apollo, Athena, and Hermes. Apollo being associated with art, Athena with wisdom, and Hermes the messenger god for a fluency and understanding of language. Hermes dramatically rushes in on the scene and literally brings a gift from the gods, the caduceus. It is generally thought that Hermes endows the princess with [...] the gift of eloquence, {{to go along with the}} Grace's gift of beauty. However, the caduceus, which is seen in six other paintings in the cycle, has also been associated with peace and harmony. The object may be seen as foretelling of Marie's peaceful reign. It can be interpreted that the combined efforts of these divine teachers represent [...] Marie's idyllic preparedness for the responsibilities she will obtain in the future, and the trials and tribulations she will face as Queen. It is also suggested that the three gods, more importantly, offer their guidance as <b>a</b> <b>gift</b> <b>that</b> allows the soul to be [...] "freed by reason" [...] and gain the knowledge of what is [...] "good" [...] revealing the divine connection between the gods and the future Queen. The painting displays an embellished Baroque collaboration of the spiritual and earthly relationships, which are illustrated in a theatrical environment. Acting as more than just static symbols the figures portrayed take an active role in her education. Also present are the three graces, Euphrosyne, Aglaea, and Thalia giving her beauty.|$|E
2500|$|The images he internalized {{from those}} {{formative}} years in Bermuda—the [...] "priest trudging down the sun-drenched Bermuda lane, {{and the man}} with the beard who met all the ships when they docked and searched all the faces"—would, over time, prove foundational to Buechner's faith as well. Bermuda was, in a way, his family's salvation, [...] "the promised land of pre-World War II Bermuda that we reached through the wilderness and bewilderness of our first shock and grief." [...] It was also a time in Buechner's life marked by intellectual, spiritual and emotional growth and exploration. [...] Bermuda is therefore central to Buechner's theology as he came to view his deliverance in that enchanting isle [...] "as <b>a</b> <b>gift</b> <b>that</b> implies a giver," [...] an example of that [...] "crazy, holy grace" [...] that sends us experiences not by mere accident of chance but to [...] "open our hearts as well as our eyes." [...] It was in Bermuda that Buechner [...] "caught some bright foreshadowing" [...] of [...] "the secret place of the Most High" [...] that he believed [...] "dwells in all of us as the image of God and in which [...] [...] [...] some part of all of us dwells." [...] This is why, when Buechner's character Rooney in The Final Beast is asked to pick one word to describe the power of Bermuda, she says [...] "life [...] [...] [...] [...] [...] It had the smell of life to me." [...] Buechner found a new life in Bermuda. [...] It marked a new beginning for him, emotionally and spiritually.
