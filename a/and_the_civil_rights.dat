5|$|On {{the left-wing}} and {{counterculture}} side, the film included references to topical political matters like Kent State shootings, President Harry S. Truman's decision to drop atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Richard Nixon, the Vietnam war, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> movement. Precursors of this counterculture subversive humor in film were two non-"college movies", M*A*S*H, a 1970 satirical dark comedy, and The Kentucky Fried Movie, a 1977 formless comedy {{consisting of a}} series of sketches (which was also directed by Landis).|$|E
5|$|The Freedmen's Bureau {{enforced}} {{the amendment}} locally, providing {{a degree of}} support for people subject to the Black Codes. Reciprocally, the Thirteenth Amendment established the Bureau's legal basis to operate in Kentucky. The Civil Rights Act circumvented racism in local jurisdictions by allowing blacks access to the federal courts. The Enforcement Acts of 1870–1871 <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Act of 1875, in combating the violence and intimidation of white supremacy, were {{also part of the}} effort to end slave conditions for Southern blacks. However, the effect of these laws waned as political will diminished and the federal government lost authority in the South, particularly after the Compromise of 1877 ended Reconstruction in exchange for a Republican presidency.|$|E
5|$|When the country's {{fortunes}} turned {{during the}} Great Depression, the violent Teamsters Strike of 1934 resulted in laws acknowledging workers' rights.

In the 1950s, about 1.6% {{of the population of}} Minneapolis was nonwhite. Minneapolis contended with white supremacy, participated in desegregation <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> movement, and in 1968 was the birthplace of the American Indian Movement.|$|E

25|$|Issues facing {{parties and}} the United States after World War II {{included}} the Cold War <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Movement. Republicans attracted conservatives and white Southerners from the Democratic coalition with {{their use of the}} Southern strategy and resistance to New Deal and Great Society liberalism. African Americans had traditionally supported the Republican Party because of the anti-slavery policies of Abraham Lincoln <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> policies of his successors, such as Ulysses S. Grant. But they began supporting Democrats following the ascent of the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration, the New Deal, the integration of the military and embrace of proposed civil rights legislation by President Harry Truman in 1947–48, and the postwar Civil Rights movement. The Democratic Party's main base of support shifted to the Northeast, marking a dramatic reversal of history.|$|E

25|$|Opposition {{to the war}} arose {{during a}} time of {{unprecedented}} student activism which followed the free speech movement <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> movement.

The growing opposition to the Vietnam War was partly attributed to greater access to uncensored information presented by the extensive television coverage on the ground in Vietnam.|$|E

25|$|The Democratic Party, proclaiming {{itself the}} party of white men, north and south, {{supported}} Johnson. However the Republicans in Congress overrode his veto (the Senate by the close vote of 33:15, the House by 122:41) <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> bill became law. Congress also passed a toned-down Freedmen's Bureau Bill; Johnson quickly vetoed {{as he had done}} to the previous bill.

25|$|The New Deal Coalition {{collapsed}} in the mid-1960s {{in the face of}} urban riots, the Vietnam War, the opposition of many Southern Democrats to desegregation <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Movement and disillusionment that the New Deal could be revived by Lyndon Johnson's Great Society.
