500|$|In his Life of Samuel Johnson Boswell {{referred}} to Johnson as 'Dr. Johnson' {{so often that}} he would always be known as such, even though he hated being called such. Boswell's emphasis on Johnson's later years shows him too often as merely an old man discoursing in a tavern to a circle of admirers. Although Boswell, a Scotsman, was a close companion and friend to Johnson during many important times of his life, {{like many of his}} fellow Englishmen Johnson had a reputation for despising Scotland and its people. Even during their journey together through Scotland, Johnson [...] "exhibited prejudice and a narrow nationalism". Hester Thrale, in summarising Johnson's nationalistic views and his anti-Scottish prejudice, said: [...] "We <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> well he loved to abuse the Scotch, & indeed to be abused by them in return." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{video for}} [...] "Misery" [...] premiered on Stefani's Vevo account on May 31, 2016. On the same night, it was {{distributed}} to iTunes as a paid download in the United States. Outside North America, the video {{was available for}} preorder in several countries starting May 11, but was not officially released until May 31, 2016. A majority of critics praised the video for creating glamorous and fashionable surroundings. Bustles May Sofi ranked the nine outfits the singer wore during the video and listed her pink tulle frock at number one. The publication's consensus on their decision reads: [...] "This adorable pink frock is not only super wearable, it's also pretty on-trend. The pale pink tulle gives off a ballerina-chic vibe, and we <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> popular that style has been as of late." [...] The site listed the [...] "floral co-ords" [...] look in the bottom position, but still claimed that the outfit was [...] "probably the most costume-like of [...] all." [...] Seija Rankin of E! Online stated: [...] "Contrary to the song's title, this tune and the corresponding video is not actually miserable at all; it's quite upbeat." ...|$|E

500|$|Žigić {{began the}} season with Red Star, but on 29 August 2006, he signed a {{four-year}} contract with La Liga club Racing Santander. The fee, officially undisclosed, was variously reported at anything from €4.5M to €7M. Although better offers had been rejected, those offers {{had arrived at the}} wrong time: the pressure on Red Star to win the domestic title meant they were unlikely to dispose of a major player in mid-season. The player felt he was more likely to start matches with a club at Racing's level. Partnering the diminutive Pedro Munitis, he contributed 11 goals– including a hat-trick in a 5–4 win over Athletic Bilbao– four assists and five penalties won in league competition over the season as Racing finished tenth. The efficacy of the pair earned them the nickname of [...] (the Two Point-getters); ahead of the coming season, new coach Marcelino García Toral recalled how [...] "we <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> many points Racing picked up when Žigić and Munitis weren't there. Without them, Racing didn't add points". His performances earned him the captains' vote as best player based abroad for 2006, and contributed to his 2007 Football Association of Serbia Golden Ball award.|$|E
500|$|In June 2011, Julian re-joined {{his former}} club, now renamed simply Stevenage, on a free transfer, {{three years after}} leaving the club. The move meant that Julian would be playing under the {{management}} of Graham Westley once more, who first brought Julian to Stevenage in 2005 – Westley said [...] "Alan sees the opportunity {{in the long term}} and we <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> much quality he will bring into the squad. He is a different type of character but another man that you would happily go into the trenches with". On signing for Stevenage, Julian said [...] "I had a great time at Stevenage before and coming back now and we are in League One, it is a dream come true". As a result of Chris Day dislocating his finger, Julian started in the club's first game of the 2011–12 campaign, keeping a clean sheet in Stevenage's 0–0 home draw against Exeter City. He played the first three games of the season, before first choice goalkeeper Chris Day returned from injury. Julian made just two further appearances during the campaign; in a 2–2 draw with AFC Wimbledon in the Football League Trophy, and an appearance as a second-half substitute in Stevenage's 2–2 home draw against Huddersfield Town. He was released by Stevenage when his contract expired in May 2012.|$|E
500|$|... "The Firefly" [...] was co-written by co-showrunners J.H. Wyman and Jeff Pinkner, {{while being}} {{directed}} by Supernatural veteran Charles Beeson. On October 20, 2010, TV Guide announced that Back to the Future star Christopher Lloyd had been cast {{in an upcoming}} episode as [...] "Walter's musical hero". Noble explained Lloyd's role: [...] "We <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> much Walter loves music, right? Well this fellow {{was one of his}} icons. He adored this man. So Walter gets to {{be a bit of a}} fanboy". Lloyd began shooting the episode in late October. Soon before the episode aired, Lloyd told reporters [...] "I was very excited for this role. My character is going through an experience he never expected to happen to him, and he's adjusting to that." [...] Lloyd also added he felt welcomed in as a part of the ensemble cast. In a conference call interview with journalists, John Noble explained that [...] "probably the best fun that I've had [...] was doing the stuff with Chris Lloyd, because it was two crazy old guys just trying desperately to communicate with each other. We had a lot of laughs. There was a common thread of trying to find the music again, because Chris' character had forgotten how to play the piano, so we go through this journey of bringing the music back to him, and [...] thrill to Walter. This happens all the way through this very complicated episode".|$|E

500|$|The ballad [...] "I Miss You" [...] was {{performed}} {{in front of an}} electronic backdrop in which a male dancer was silhouetted in kinetic, black-and-white stripes. A re-arranged version of [...] "Resentment" [...] followed with an acoustic guitar used for its musical backbone. Beyoncé opened the performance of [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] saying [...] "We <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> it feels to be hurt and lied to" [...] and later turned it into a guitar-pop song, in which elements of Goo Goo Dolls' adult-alt ballad [...] "Iris" [...] were used. An acoustic cover of [...] "Ex-Factor" [...] originally performed by Lauryn Hill followed. [...] "Flaws and All" [...] featured Beyoncé making facial expressions as she dedicated the song to her fans, singing the lines, [...] "I don't know why you love me/And that's why I love you." [...] During the performance of [...] "Irreplaceable", she asked from the crowd to sing the lines [...] "to the left" [...] along with her and made a competition in singing between sections. The first verse and the chorus were sung solely by the crowd. The intro of [...] "Countdown" [...] began with Beyoncé's ululations and moans, the Boyz II Men sample used in the song, and the opening drum crack and continued with the song's music video being projected on the screen. Brief snippets of Beyoncé performing Destiny's Child's [...] "Jumpin', Jumpin'" [...] (2000) followed. [...] "Run the World (Girls)" [...] {{was performed}} with a march choreography and a funky version of [...] "Why Don't You Love Me" [...] followed. During the end, the song's beat got transformed into an extended outro. Prior {{the end of the show}} a home-video sequence showing Beyoncé biking, drinking a pint of Guinness, going whale-watching and holding her daughter Blue Ivy Carter with a voice-over was shown. Referencing her song [...] "I Was Here" [...] which was played in the background, she said [...] "When I leave this world I'll leave no regrets. I will leave my mark, so everyone will know I was here". Beyoncé went on to perform [...] "Halo" [...] in a red dress which she opened with a performance of Whitney Houston's [...] "I Will Always Love You" [...] as a tribute to her following her death. The show ended with a performance of [...] "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)" [...] which featured a Bob Fosse-inspired choreography and a singalong with the crowd.|$|E

But universities <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> misleading and even destructive these rankings can be. It's common knowledge how the statistics can be 'gamed.' Colleges can solicit applications from students with little chance of acceptance to boost how selective they appear. Schools can adjust when they allow faculty to take leave {{in order to raise}} the faculty/student ratio. And admitting more [...] "risky" [...] students on transfer rather than in the initial class results in a higher freshman SAT average." ...|$|E

2500|$|Mary McNamara for the Los Angeles Times {{commented on}} {{parallels}} drawn between the Visitors and President Barack Obama, insofar as: [...] "The instant adoration, the attractiveness and rhetorical skills of Anna, {{the idea that}} the Visitors will woo us with universal healthcare and then destroy us all seem a right-wingish take on the president's ascendancy." [...] She continued: [...] "Perhaps that is the creators' intent, but most successful science fiction contains an element of, if not outright humor, then the absurd. That the human race will be enslaved not through brainwashing or firepower but adequate healthcare is pretty hilarious in a dark and almost possible way. And Anna and her crew seem to embody more of a Wall Street deregulated/Bernie Madoff mentality—big returns for minimum investment. And we <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> that turns out." [...] Linda Stasi for The New York Post conversely compared the Visitors to extremist Muslims. Though in the original series the aliens were a metaphor for Nazis, Stasi commented: [...] "TV shows no longer have to rely on Nazis, because now we have the hated extremist Muslims to make all bad-guy metaphors with", adding on the Visitors' appearance: [...] "Once you peel back the outer, good-looking shell, you've got your standard outer-space Nazi/Taliban lizard person lurking beneath." ...|$|E
2500|$|I am sure every Englishman {{who has a}} {{heart in}} his breast {{and a feeling of}} justice in his mind, sympathizes with those unfortunate Danes (cheers), and wishes that this country could have been able to draw the sword {{successfully}} in their defence (continued cheers); but I am satisfied that those who reflect on the season of the year when that war broke out, on the means which this country could have applied for deciding in one sense that issue, I am satisfied that those who make these reflections will think that we acted wisely in not embarking in that dispute. (Cheers.) To have sent a fleet in midwinter to the Baltic every sailor would tell you was an impossibility, but if it could have gone it would have been attended by no effectual result. Ships sailing on the sea cannot stop armies on land, and to have attempted to stop the progress of an army by sending a fleet to the Baltic would have been attempting to do that which {{it was not possible to}} accomplish. (Hear, hear.) If England could have sent an army, and although we <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> admirable that army is on the peace establishment, we must acknowledge that we have no means of sending out a force at all equal to cope with the 300,000 or 400,000 men whom the 30,000,000 or 40,000,000 of Germany could have pitted against us, and that such an attempt would only have insured a disgraceful discomfiture—not to the army, indeed, but to the Government which sent out an inferior force and expected it to cope successfully with a force so vastly superior. (Cheers.) ... we did not think that the Danish cause would be considered as sufficiently British, and as sufficiently bearing on the interests and the security and the honour of England, as to make it justifiable to ask the country to make those exertions which such a war would render necessary.|$|E
2500|$|John's [...] "joy {{became more}} {{for him the}} more he was diminished. … This was John, {{and this is how}} the single {{individual}} is to fulfill something similar in lesser situations. If he has first of all learned to deny himself humbly and to master his mind, then joy will also be victorious. But the first must be learned first-later, that which is greater; one is first initiated into the lesser mystery, later into the mystery." [...] Kiedrkegaard says, what about the single individual who wants to be like John? Do we <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> to deny ourseves with humility? He says, Who does not know that things like these have happened and do happen in the world-that someone who once ruled over countries and kingdoms has ceased to rule and is obliged to see a more powerful ruler take his place; that someone who once was hailed with jubilation soon, yes, so soon that the whole things {{seems to have been a}} dream, hears the same jubilation shouting another name, that someone whose commanding figure was familiar to everyone regards himself in the next moment with the anxiety of uncertainty about whether he has lost his mind or the world its memory so that it confused with him someone else; that the master whole pupil only yesterday sat at his feet must bow his shoulders today under the other's advancement; that the businessman who was kind enough to set his servant on his path now sees that his path means the benefactor's downfall; that the girl who once filled her beloved's thoughts now sits and sees his bold ambition pursuing a higher goal; that the singer whose words were on everyone's lips is forgotten today and his songs have been more than replaced; that the orator whose words echoed everywhere must now seek the solitude of the desert if he wants echo; that the friend from youth who was on an equal basis with his fellows now with amazement perceives the distance; that the lowly cottage where the parents lived, where the humble cradle stood, is now collapsing like a recollection that cannot catch up with the mighty. And yet, how strange-if you let your thoughts dwell on those distinguished people whose memory the generations have preserved, you will find that the way each individual distinguished himself is different, and you will find in turn that several are distinguished by the same thing. But in that select group you still seem to lack one place, and yet the lack is indeed a contradiction; how would the one whose task it was to be reconciled-to being forgotten-find a place in recollection? But for this very reason it is important to consider it by itself, and it is especially beautiful to do this-because no earthly reward is beckoning.
