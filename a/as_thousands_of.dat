5|$|The {{discovery}} of gold near Barnette's trading post {{caused him to}} turn {{what had been a}} temporary stop into a permanent one. The gold caused a stampede of miners to the area, and buildings sprang up around Barnette's trading post. In November 1903, the area's residents voted to incorporate the city of Fairbanks.

The death toll of the march is {{difficult}} to assess <b>as</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> captives were able to escape from their guards (although many were killed during their escapes), {{and it is not}} known how many died in the fighting that was taking place concurrently. All told, approximately 2,500–10,000 Filipino and 300–650 American prisoners of war died before they could reach Camp O'Donnell.|$|E

5|$|Gandhi's {{death was}} mourned nationwide. Over {{two million people}} joined the five-mile long funeral {{procession}} that took over five hours to reach Raj Ghat from Birla house, where he was assassinated. Gandhi's body was transported on a weapons carrier, whose chassis was dismantled overnight to allow a high-floor to be installed so that people could {{catch a glimpse of}} his body. The engine of the vehicle was not used; instead four drag-ropes manned by 50 people each pulled the vehicle.

5|$|In the First World War, {{horses were}} used in combat for cavalry charges, and they {{remained}} the best means for moving scouts, messengers, supply wagons, ambulances, and artillery quickly on the battlefield; the horse could refuel itself to some extent by grazing, and could cope with terrain which was beyond machines of the time. However, this war had a devastating effect on the British horse population. <b>As</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> animals were drafted for the war effort, some breeds were so reduced in number {{that they were in}} danger of disappearing. Many breeds were saved by the dedicated efforts of a few breeders who formed breed societies, tracking down remaining animals and registering them.|$|E
5|$|Nasser also {{attempted}} to maintain {{oversight of the}} country's civil service {{to prevent it from}} inflating and consequently becoming a burden to the state. New laws provided workers with a minimum wage, profit shares, free education, free health care, reduced working hours, and encouragement to participate in management. Land reforms guaranteed the security of tenant farmers, promoted agricultural growth, and reduced rural poverty. As a result of the 1962 measures, government ownership of Egyptian business reached 51percent, and the National Union was renamed the Arab Socialist Union (ASU). With these measures came more domestic repression, <b>as</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> Islamists were imprisoned, including dozens of military officers. Nasser's tilt toward a Soviet-style system led his aides Boghdadi and Hussein el-Shafei to submit their resignations in protest.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Depression One was a weak {{tropical}} cyclone that struck Cuba and the Bahamas in May and June 1993. It {{formed in the}} western Caribbean Sea on May 31 and produced heavy rainfall along its path. In Cuba, the precipitation reached 12.4inches (31.5cm), which caused widespread flooding and damage in nine provinces. Over 16,500houses were damaged, and a further 1,860 were destroyed. At least seven {{people were killed in}} the country. In neighboring Haiti, the flooding killed thirteen people, as well <b>as</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> livestock. Rainfall was also reported in southern Florida, which eased drought conditions. The depression eventually crossed the Bahamas and became extratropical.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the British intervened {{directly}} in 1883, the Mahdi had set about conquering much of Sudan, at the time controlled by Egypt, and had won several critical victories that provided him great wealth and modern weaponry. Colonel William Hicks, British officer appointed commander of eight-thousand Egyptian soldiers and an extensive supply train, was given the simple objective of crushing the insurrection. Colonel Hicks and nearly every man in his army was killed by an overwhelming Mahdist force at the Battle of El Obeid. After this defeat, and facing immense financial difficulties in Egypt, the British government decided not to pursue further offensive action and instead selected General Charles George Gordon to lead the evacuation effort, <b>as</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> civilians and pounds of equipment were to be withdrawn from outposts throughout Sudan.|$|E
5|$|By this time, Schwarzkopf {{commanded}} {{an international}} army of 750,000, comprising 500,000 U.S. troops and 250,000 troops from other nations, as well <b>as</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> main battle tanks, combat aircraft and six carrier battle groups. Most of the U.S. and allied forces, however, were not combat veterans, and Schwarzkopf {{and the other}} allied commanders wanted to fight cautiously to minimize casualties. Schwarzkopf's experience in the Middle East allowed him to understand the factors surrounding the conflict, including allied commanders, with greater ease. He had {{a good relationship with}} Saudi commander Khalid bin Sultan, who in turn helped Schwarzkopf win over the Saudi Arabian populace. In spite of the cooperation, he later said he considered the Arab troops to be the least effective of the war. Schwarzkopf also had an agreeable relationship with his deputy commander, Lieutenant General Cal Waller, who handled much of the administrative burden. Peter de la Billière, commander of the British contingent, and Michel Roquejeoffre, commander of the French contingent, also cooperated well with Schwarzkopf. The good relationship between the allied commanders meant their forces were able to cooperate effectively during the operation.|$|E

5|$|Five Days at Memorial: Life and Death in a Storm-Ravaged Hospital is a 2013 non-fiction book by the American {{journalist}} Sheri Fink. The book {{details the}} aftermath of Hurricane Katrina at Memorial Medical Center in New Orleans in August 2005, and is an expansion of a Pulitzer Prize-winning article written by Fink and published in The New York Times Magazine in 2009. It describes the events that took place at Memorial Medical Center over five days <b>as</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> people were trapped in the hospital without power. The triage system put into effect deprioritized critically ill patients for evacuation, {{and a number of}} these patients were euthanized by medical and nursing staff shortly before the entire hospital was evacuated on the fifth day of the crisis. Fink examines the legal and political consequences of the decision to euthanize patients and the ethical issues surrounding euthanasia and health care in disaster scenarios. The book was well received by most critics and won three awards, including a National Book Critics Circle Award for non-fiction.|$|E
5|$|Henry Walter Bates: (1825–1892) was an English explorer-naturalist who {{surveyed}} the Amazon rainforest with Alfred Russel Wallace in 1848. While Wallace returned in 1852, Bates remained {{for over a}} decade. His field research included collecting almost a hundred species of butterflies from the families Ithomiinae and Heliconiinae, as well <b>as</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> other insects specimens. In sorting these butterflies into similar groups based on appearance, inconsistencies began to arise. Some appeared superficially similar to others, even {{so much so that}} Bates could not tell some species apart based only on wing appearance. However, closer examination of less obvious morphological characters seemed to show that they were not even closely related. Shortly after his return to England he read a paper on his theory of mimicry {{at a meeting of the}} Linnean Society of London on 21 November 1861, which was then published in 1862 as 'Contributions to an Insect Fauna of the Amazon Valley' in the society's Transactions. He elaborated on his experiences further in The Naturalist on the River Amazons.|$|E

In northern Mexico, more than 500 shelters were opened <b>as</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> residents were advised to evacuate from low-lying areas. The Mexican Army, Red Cross, and firefighters were put on standby to deal with emergency calls during the storm. On August22, a state of emergency was declared for Tamaulipas. The following day, at least 120 firefighters were dispatched to Monterrey, Nuevo León, to swiftly respond to emergencies. The Mexican government emphasized the safety of residents in the city, which was anticipated to bear the brunt of the hurricane. Around 7,000 fishermen evacuated coastal regions near the Texas border. In Matamoros an additional 31 shelters were opened. Schools throughout northern Mexico were closed for several days.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1940s, the {{transition}} to the postwar economy was hard for the city, <b>as</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> jobs were lost at the shipyards with the decline in the defense industry. Eventually the city's social structure began to become more liberal. Replacing shipbuilding as a primary economic force, the paper and chemical industries began to expand. No longer needed for defense, most of the old military bases were converted to civilian uses. Following the war, in which many African Americans had served, veterans and their supporters stepped up activism to gain enforcement of their constitutional rights and social justice, especially in the Jim Crow South. During the 1950s the City of Mobile integrated its police force and Spring Hill College accepted students of all races. Unlike {{in the rest of the}} state, by the early 1960s the city buses and lunch counters voluntarily desegregated.|$|E
5|$|On 3 January 1941, at Bardia, a small {{coastal town}} {{just inside the}} Libyan border, the first major Australian action of World War II took place.

Despite some heavy resistance the town fell to the Australians just two days later. The Australians captured {{a large amount of}} Italian war material as well <b>as</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> Italian prisoners of war (POWs), many of whom were shipped to prison camps in Australia. The fighting continued until 5 January when the Italian position had been cut almost into two. The Allies took nearly 40,000 Italian prisoners and considerable amounts of enemy weapons, supplies and equipment. The battle for Bardia cost 130 Australian lives with 326 men wounded.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Machination's attempted takeover, Sunstreaker and Hunter are successfully separated by Ratchet. Hunter has a happy reunion with Verity and Jimmy, but Sunstreaker, angry over what has been done to him, abandons his former partner. After the initial battles on Earth, the Decepticons lie low, experimenting with creating new life and eventually creating the Insecticons {{to take advantage of a}} now captured Hunter, as well <b>as</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> failed experiments eventually dubbed the Swarm. As the Autobots have reinforced their position on Earth, the Decepticons lure them into a trap by planting disinformation about a Decepticon trap with the help of Sunstreaker, who is convinced that he is in fact helping Starscream kill Megatron. His motives are darker than merely helping the Autobots win by disposing of Megatron - he asks the Decepticon to kill all the humans in revenge for what was done to him. Armed with the disillusioned Autobot's knowledge, unified and with their new weapon - Devastator - the Decepticons decimate the Autobots. Planning to dispose of them through a portal to Cybertron, Prime manages to fight them off long enough for his troops to escape through the portal, though at great cost - Prime is heavily damaged and rendered comatose by the damage he takes, and the Autobots are marooned on Cybertron.|$|E
