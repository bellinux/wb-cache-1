5|$|The Athenians now {{ended their}} {{alliance}} with the Ionians, since the Persians had proved to be <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> <b>the</b> easy prey that Aristagoras had described. However, the Ionians remained committed to their rebellion and the Persians {{did not seem to}} follow up their victory at Ephesus. Presumably these ad hoc forces were not equipped to lay siege to any of the cities. Despite the defeat at Ephesus, the revolt actually spread further. The Ionians sent men to the Hellespont and Propontis and captured Byzantium and the other nearby cities. They also persuaded the Carians to join the rebellion. Furthermore, seeing the spread of the rebellion, the kingdoms of Cyprus also revolted against Persian rule without any outside persuasion.|$|E

Unfortunately, formal specifications are impractical for <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> <b>the</b> shortest programs, because of problems of combinatorial explosion and indeterminacy.|$|E

25|$|It is {{probably}} impossible {{to choose one}} specific reason why OS/2 failed to gain much market share.

Unlike with Windows 3.1, IBM did {{not have access to}} the source code for Windows 95 and was unwilling to commit the time and resources to emulate the moving target of the Win32 API. IBM later introduced OS/2 into the United States v. Microsoft case, blaming unfair marketing tactics on Microsoft's part.|$|E

Crispi, who still had the hope to continue the revolution to rescue Rome and Venice, strongly opposed this solution, proposing to elect a parliamentary assembly. This proposal was also supported by the federalist Carlo Cattaneo. Garibaldi announced that the decision would have been taken by the two pro-dictators of Sicily and Naples, Antonio Mordini and Giorgio Pallavicino, who both opted for the plebiscite. On 13 October Crispi resigned from the government of Garibaldi.|$|E

25|$|On 16 April 1979, BBC2 {{adopted the}} world's first computer-generated ident, with the logo being drawn live {{every time it}} was played. This version of the 2 had orange double lines either side and the 2 itself was cream double lined. This stripy 2 had been used on {{promotions}} and holding slides for years prior to its launch, {{and now it was}} part of a bigger branding package. For the first few years of the ident, it would be accompanied by a fanfare as it scrolled onto the screen. There were versions of the ident where the ident scrolled on, scrolled off and remained static. The clock used alongside this high tec 3D ident, was <b>anything</b> <b>but.</b> <b>The</b> old clock filmed from the NODD room survived, with a new 2D logo and sporting black and orange colours. However, in 1980, BBC2 got its own electronic clock including 3D legend and centre dot.|$|E
25|$|The Tale was {{immediately}} popular and controversial. Consequently, there were rumours of various people {{as the author}} of the work— Jonathan Swift then being not largely known except for his work in the House of Lords for the passage of the First Fruits and Fifths bill for tithing. Some people thought that William Temple wrote it. Francis Atterbury said people at Oxford thought it had been written by Edmund Smith and John Philips, though he thought it was by Jonathan Swift. Some people thought it belonged to Lord Somers. However, Jonathan Swift had a cousin, also in the church, named Thomas Swift. Thomas and Jonathan were in correspondence {{during the time of the}} composition of the Tale, and Thomas Swift later claimed to have written the work. Jonathan responded by saying that Thomas had no hand in <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> <b>the</b> smallest of passages, and he would welcome hearing Thomas 'explain' the work, if he had written it. The controversy over authorship is aggravated by the choice of publisher. Not only did Swift use Tooke after the publication of the Tale, he had used Tooke before its publication as well, so the appearance of the work in John Nutt's shop was atypical.|$|E

He expounded upon this in another interview: [...] "It's a much more powerful, emotional experience than it is with Blink. To play songs and have them showcased to where it represents what this kind of music is all about is a welcome experience. It's not about <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> <b>the</b> music itself." ...|$|E

500|$|Wyke {{observes that}} Waugh's novels reprise and fictionalise the {{principal}} events of his life, although {{in an early}} essay Waugh wrote: [...] "Nothing is more insulting to a novelist than to assume that he is incapable of <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> <b>the</b> mere transcription of what he observes". The reader should not assume that the author agreed with the opinions expressed by his fictional characters. Nevertheless, in the Introduction to the Complete Short Stories, Ann Pasternak Slater said that the [...] "delineation of social prejudices and the language {{in which they are}} expressed is part of Waugh's meticulous observation of his contemporary world".|$|E

500|$|Contemporaneous writer Edgar Allan Poe {{wrote to}} Longfellow in May 1841 of his [...] "fervent admiration which [...] genius has {{inspired}} in me" [...] and later called him [...] "unquestionably the best poet in America". Poe's reputation increased as a critic, however, and he later publicly accused Longfellow of plagiarism in what Poe biographers call [...] "The Longfellow War". He wrote that Longfellow was [...] "a determined imitator and a dextrous adapter {{of the ideas}} of other people", specifically Alfred, Lord Tennyson. His accusations {{may have been a}} publicity stunt to boost readership of the Broadway Journal, for which he was the editor at the time. Longfellow did not respond publicly but, after Poe's death, he wrote: [...] "The harshness of his criticisms I have never attributed to <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> <b>the</b> irritation of a sensitive nature chafed by some indefinite sense of wrong".|$|E

[...] At this time, Marmarosa did not drink or take hard drugs, but his behavior was often eccentric. Mills reported that [...] "Dodo was just a big kid [...] He never really grew up because he never allowed <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> <b>the</b> piano to be important to him. The piano was his life. He heard things in his head that he wasn't able to play and it frustrated him. Once, he got mad at the old upright piano we had and chopped it up with an axe." ...|$|E

On returning to the Parsonage he discovered that a woman named Marjorie Cameron—an unemployed illustrator and former Navy WAVE—had come to visit. Believing her to be the [...] "elemental" [...] woman and manifestation of Babalon that he had invoked, in early March Parsons began performing sex magic rituals with Cameron, who acted as his [...] "Scarlet Woman", while Hubbard continued to participate as the amanuensis. Unlike the rest of the household, Cameron knew nothing at first of Parsons' magical intentions: [...] "I didn't know anything about the O.T.O., I didn't know that they had invoked me, I didn't know <b>anything,</b> <b>but</b> <b>the</b> whole house knew it. Everybody was watching {{to see what was going}} on." [...] Despite this ignorance and her skepticism about Parsons' magic, Cameron reported her sighting of a UFO to Parsons, who secretly recorded the sighting as a materialization of Babalon.|$|E
