5|$|Middle {{latitude}} glaciers {{are located}} either between the Tropic of Cancer and the Arctic Circle, or between the Tropic of Capricorn and the Antarctic Circle. Both areas support glacier ice from mountain glaciers, valley glaciers and even smaller icecaps, {{which are usually}} located in higher mountainous regions. All are located in mountain ranges, notably the Himalayas; the Alps; the Pyrenees; Rocky Mountains and Pacific Coast Ranges of North America; the Patagonian Andes in South America; and mountain ranges in New Zealand. Glaciers in these latitudes are more widespread and tend to be greater in mass the closer they are to the polar regions. They are the most widely studied over the past 150 years. As with examples located in the tropical zone, virtually all the glaciers in the mid-latitudes <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> of negative mass balance and are retreating.|$|E

Some hibernating animals end their hibernation {{a couple of times}} during the winter so that they can sleep. Hibernating animals waking up from hibernation often go into rebound sleep because of lack of sleep during the hibernation period. They are definitely well-rested and are conserving energy during hibernation, but need sleep for something else.|$|E
25|$|With the {{development}} of radioactive tracers, it was shown that cells are not impermeable to Na+.

In 1935, Karl Lohmann discovered ATP and {{its role as a}} source of energy for cells, so the concept of a metabolically-driven sodium pump was proposed.|$|E

25|$|Some voice teachers, however, {{organize}} registers differently. There {{are over}} a dozen different constructs of vocal registers in use within the field. The confusion which exists concerning what a register is, and how many registers there are, {{is due in part}} to what takes place in the modal register when a person sings from the lowest pitches of that register to the highest pitches. The frequency of vibration of the vocal folds is determined by their length, tension, and mass. As pitch rises, the vocal folds are lengthened, tension increases, and their thickness decreases. In other words, all three of these factors <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> of flux in the transition from the lowest to the highest tones.|$|E
25|$|In 2008 it was {{reported}} that most of the Olympic venues had fallen into disrepair: according to those reports, 21 of the 22 facilities built for the games had either been left abandoned or <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> of dereliction, with several squatter camps having sprung up around certain facilities, and a number of venues afflicted by vandalism, graffiti or strewn with rubbish. These claims, however, are disputed and likely to be inaccurate, as most of the facilities used for the Athens Olympics are either in use or {{in the process of being}} converted for post-Olympics use. The Greek Government has created a corporation, Olympic Properties SA, which is overseeing the post-Olympics management, development and conversion of these facilities, some of which will be sold off (or have already been sold off) to the private sector, while other facilities are still in use just as during the Olympics, or have been converted for commercial use or modified for other sports. Concerts and theatrical shows, such as those by the troupe Cirque du Soleil, have recently been held in the complex.|$|E

500|$|North American glaciers are {{primarily}} located along {{the spine of}} the Rocky Mountains in the United States and Canada, and the Pacific Coast Ranges extending from northern California to Alaska. While Greenland is geologically associated with North America, it is also a part of the Arctic region. Apart from the few tidewater glaciers such as Taku Glacier, in the advance stage of their tidewater glacier cycle prevalent along the coast of Alaska, virtually all of those in North America <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> of retreat. This [...] rate has increased rapidly since around 1980, and overall each decade since has seen greater rates of retreat than the preceding one. There are also small remnant glaciers scattered throughout the Sierra Nevada mountains of California and Nevada.|$|E
500|$|The {{world of}} Innocence is {{divided between the}} [...] "divine" [...] world of Devaloka (divided between the regions of Sensus and Ratio) and the lower human world of Naraka. As Devaloka needed human souls to survive, the Sensus general Asura {{decided to use the}} Manifest, an {{artifact}} created by the ancient Primordial Giant, to merge Devaloka and Naraka. This plan was opposed by many, leading to war between Sensus and Ratio. Asura was aided by the Devalokans Inanna, Orifiel and Sakuya; his sentient sword Durandal; and his dragon companion Vrtra. Asura eventually won, defeating the Ratio general Hypnos in battle. Before he could use the Manifest, Inanna betrayed and stabbed him with Durandal. He kills her before he dies, leaving the unification of Devaloka and Naraka unfinished. Most of Devaloka's population is killed in the process, with the others eventually dying years later. In the present, Naraka is governed by the imperial capital of Regnum and the western country of Garam, who <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> of war. Added to this is the emergence of [...] "avatars", Devalokans reincarnated in human form who hold supernatural powers. They are hunted and inducted into Regnum's military and used for experimentation or as front line troops in the war.|$|E
500|$|In 1983, the Church {{issued a}} new code of canon law. Unlike its predecessor, the 1983 Code of Canon Law did not {{explicitly}} name Masonic orders among the secret societies it condemns. It states: [...] "A person who joins an association which plots against the Church {{is to be}} punished with a just penalty; one who promotes or takes office in such an association is to be punished with an interdict." [...] This named omission of Masonic orders caused both Catholics and Freemasons {{to believe that the}} ban on Catholics becoming Freemasons may have been lifted, especially after the perceived liberalisation of Vatican II. However, the matter was clarified when Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (later Pope Benedict XVI), as the Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, issued a Declaration on Masonic Associations, which states: [...] "...the Church's negative judgment in regard to Masonic association remains unchanged since their principles have always been considered irreconcilable with the doctrine of the Church and therefore membership in them remains forbidden. The faithful who enrol in Masonic associations <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> of grave sin and may not receive Holy Communion." [...] For its part, Freemasonry has never objected to Catholics joining their fraternity. Those Grand Lodges in amity with UGLE deny the Church's claims. The UGLE now states that [...] "Freemasonry does not seek to replace a Mason's religion or provide a substitute for it." ...|$|E

500|$|Since the {{intensive}} period of house building, little has changed. At {{the west end}} of the suburb, the Tyneside flats at Northborne Street and surrounding streets remain in situ and here there is [...] "housing and little else". Much of this housing is in poor condition, some is in [...] "crumbling disrepair" [...] and requires substantial investment. Old Durham Road has developed into {{the focal point of the}} neighbourhood and is the sole commercial area, with small, independent shops running along the western end of the road backing onto the streets from Inskip Terrace and Shipcote Terrace. Whilst many retail units <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> of deterioration, and despite a report describing recent housing development on the east side of Old Durham Road as [...] "poorly handled and unsightly", the area remains [...] "interesting and lively". By contrast, the central and eastern areas of Deckham are affected by a more marked decline. At the western edge there are stone remnants of an old, rural settlement, but the remainder, grouped around Edgeware and Kingston Roads, consists of bland, repetitive social housing arranged on long, curved streets which combine to create an environment which is anonymous, claustrophobic and disorientating. One source describes the environment as one where [...] "eyesores become landmarks (lock–up workshops on Kingston Road), any slight change in materials becomes significant (system–built housing on Kingston Road), and any attempt to do something different becomes a relief (a corner garden on Mayfair Gardens)".|$|E
500|$|December {{started with}} the last group stage match of the UEFA Cup.

The visitors scored first, but Benfica responded through Simão with a double inside ten minutes, giving them the first league win in a month and returning them to first place. On 12 December, Benfica played away to Belenenses. Trapattoni's team did not perform to expectations and lost 4–1, the largest defeat there since 1947–48. Trapattoni remained optimistic, saying, [...] "Losing a game like this is not catastrophic. Give up? No, that is not my vocabulary." [...] In {{the aftermath of the}} defeat, José Moreira lost his starting goalkeeping place to Quim. Trapattoni, in the preview for the upcoming match with Penafiel, said, [...] "Benfica needs to forget this humiliating defeat quickly. Four goals...three goals in eight minutes, it is true we <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> of emergency. We have the mentality to react and will do so." [...] On the same day, Benfica discovered their next opponent in the UEFA Cup would be CSKA Moscow. On 18 December, Benfica beat Penafiel 1–0 with a goal from Argel. On 21 December, Benfica played the last game of the year, hosting third-tier team AD Oliveirense for the Portuguese Cup. Benfica won 4–1 but required extra time to beat the visitors after a 1-1 draw in regular time. Throughout the game, Benfica fans whistled the team for the poor game. Later, Trapattoni acknowledged the performance, saying, [...] "For the first time, I am with the fans since the team deserved the whistles." ...|$|E
