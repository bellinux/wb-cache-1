We analyze the choice of <b>agro-biodiversity</b> by risk-averse farmers who have access to financial insurance, and study the implications for agri-environmental policy design when on-farm <b>agro-biodiversity</b> generates a positive risk externality. While increasing environmental risk leads private farmers to increase their level of on-farm <b>agro-biodiversity,</b> the level of <b>agro-biodiversity</b> in the laissez-faire equilibrium remains ineciently low.

However, there are limited attempts to quantify <b>agro-biodiversity</b> losses and relate these losses to soil degradation and crop productivity, particularly in Tigray, Ethiopia. In this study, spatial variation in <b>agro-biodiversity</b> and soil degradation was assessed in 2000 and 2005 at 151 farms in relation to farm, productivity, wealth, social, developmental and topographic characteristics in Tigray, northern Ethiopia. A significant decrease in <b>agro-biodiversity</b> was documented between 2000 and 2005, mainly associated with inorganic fertilizer use, number of credit sources and proximity to towns and major roads. <b>Agro-biodiversity</b> was higher at farms with higher soil fertility (available P and total N) and higher productivity (total caloric crop yield).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this book is to assess a variety of {{economic}} issues {{as they relate to}} <b>agro-biodiversity</b> and show how addressing these issues can assist in <b>agro-biodiversity</b> policy-making. This is illustrated using empirical data from some of the countries (Ethiopia, Nepal and Zambia) which are part of the Genetic Resources Policy Initiative. The empirical chapters apply the relevant economic methods, including regression analysis, choice experiments, hedonic pricing, contingent valuation and farm business income analysis. The authors discuss the economics of managing crop diversity on-farm in the context of crop variety attribute preferences, farmers' perception of <b>agro-biodiversity</b> loss, and value addition and marketing of the products of traditional crop varieties. The case studies include detailed analysis of traditional varieties of groundnut, maize, rice, sorghum, and teff.

However, no {{studies have been}} undertaken yet to assess why farmers conserve and maintain large <b>agro-biodiversity,</b> the extent of agro-ecological richness, species richness, estimated loss of traditional varieties and threats {{to the loss of}} on-farm <b>agro-biodiversity.</b> Information on the number of varieties cultivated by the farmers for six important staple crops were collected from nine districts and twenty sub-districts spread across six different agro-ecological zones of the country to understand farmers reasons for maintaining on-farm crop diversity, estimate agro-ecological richness, species richness and the overall loss of traditional varieties, to know the famers’ level of awareness on climate change and the different threats to crop diversity. The results from this study indicated that an overwhelming 93 % of the respondents manage and use <b>agro-biodiversity</b> for household food security and livelihood. The average agro-ecological richness ranged from 1. 17 to 2. 26 while the average species richness ranged from 0. 50 to 2. 66. The average agro-ecological richness indicates a large agro-ecological heterogeneity in terms of the different species of staple crops cultivated. The average species richness on the other hand shows that agro-ecological heterogeneity determines the type and extent of the cultivation of the six different staple cereals under consideration. The overall loss of traditional varieties in a time period of 20 years stands at 28. 57 %. On climate change, 94 % of the farmers recognize that local climate is changing while 86 % responded that they are aware of the potential impacts of climate change on their livelihoods. Climate change and associated factors was considered the most imminent threat to the management and loss of on-farm <b>agro-biodiversity.</b> The results from this study indicate that on-farm <b>agro-biodiversity</b> conservation, development and utilization programs have to be more specific to the different agro-ecological zones considering the agro-ecological heterogeneity.

40|$|Loss of biodiversity, {{including}} <b>agro-biodiversity</b> affects smallholders in dry-land regions by {{decreasing the}} buffering {{capacity of the}} agro-ecosystem and increasing proneness to yield variability including crop failure due to weather extremes. Loss of biodiversity is associated with land use/land cover (LULC) changes {{that are related to}} a range of biophysical and socio-economic drivers. This thesis is focused on the Tigray region in northern Ethiopia which has experienced severe loss of biodiversity over the last decades at the regional scale, while loss of genetic variation of crops at the farm and field scale are ongoing as a result of agricultural technology adoption processes. The overall goal of this thesis research was to identify and analyse factors affecting loss of <b>agro-biodiversity</b> in Tigray, Ethiopia, and relate <b>agro-biodiversity</b> loss to LULC changes, soil erosion, farming practices and agricultural productivity. A multi-scale approach was adopted. At the regional scale, LULC changes over the last decades were investigated using a time-series of remotely sensed data to assess changes in biodiversity. At the farm scale, changes in farming practices and land use between 2000 and 2005 were described along with their effects on <b>agro-biodiversity.</b> These changes were related to biophysical and socio-economic drivers. Finally, at the field scale, the consequences of the presence of Acacia albida trees for productivity were assessed. A survey among 151 farms in Tigray indicated that higher numbers of species of trees and shrubs, along with cultivation of land races was associated with traditional farming practices of smallholders in 2000 and 2005. Classified maps from remotely sensed data indicated that significant changes in LULC were accompanied by loss of biodiversity and intensification of agricultural production. At the same time, overall caloric yields were highest and soil erosion lowest in sparsely cultivated areas with high biodiversity, where traditional farming practices still dominate. At the farm scale, it was shown that A. albida trees contribute significantly to soil fertility and barley yield. Results of this project may assist policy development on <b>agro-biodiversity</b> restoration by providing information on long-term historical trends, insight into their drivers, and consequences for food security among resource poor smallholders in the region...|$|E

The case of Bt cotton in India is taken for empirical illustration. The production function analyses show that both Bt technology and on-farm varietal diversity enhance yield, while reducing the production risk.

Since only its predatory larval stage subsists on aphids, while the adult live primarily on nectar and pollen, <b>agro-biodiversity</b> enhancement in the form of field margin plants can be particularly essential for syrphid survival and reproduction and for sustaining a viable natural enemy population. Field and laboratory investigations show that selected plant species strongly differ in their suitability as food sources for the syrphid E. balteatus, even within specific families.

The oases hold heirloom perennial crop species first introduced by Jesuit missionaries (1697 - 1768) and represent geographies of historical dissemination. I selected fifteen Jesuit mission oases and surveyed the oasis gardens for species richness and abundance. To understand the cultural, political and economic forces that create these patterns of persistence within the oases, I conducted interviews on farming system practices, geographical remoteness, market integration, land tenure, tourism, protected area status and cultural practices. In all, I surveyed 241 gardens and documented eighty-nine total perennial crop species. Historical records in 1774 describe twenty-one perennial crop species in cultivation after the Jesuit expulsion. I calculated species-area relationships and rank-abundance for total perennial and mission crop species in each oasis and inventory comparisons for those oases with quantitative historical data to analyze retention of historic mission species. A high persistence of mission species indicates that oases serve as <b>agro-biodiversity</b> refugia, or protected source areas for agricultural species. These mission-oases act as a network of interconnected sites that are also isolated from one another and the Mexican mainland by the rugged environment, limited transportation infrastructure, and by sea.
