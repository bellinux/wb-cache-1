60|$|The Rio Negro {{was old and}} ugly, {{with short}} iron masts from which clumsy {{derricks}} hung, tall, upright funnel, and blistered, gray paint. Her boats were dirty and stained by soot, and a belt of rust at her waterline hinted at neglect, but no barnacles and weed marred the smoothness of the plates below. Her <b>antifouling</b> <b>paint</b> was clean, and her lines beneath the swell of quarter and bows were fine. In fact, the Rio Negro was faster than she looked when she carried her regular load of two thousand tons and her under-water body was hidden. She traded in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean, and at certain ports Customs officials carefully scrutinized her papers. At others, they smiled and allowed her captain privileges that strangers did not get.|$|E

Samplings were carried out in four Eastern Mediterranean fish farms. Two of them used nets treated with <b>antifouling</b> <b>paints</b> whereas the other two utilized untreated nets. The results showed that almost in all cases the concentrations of heavy metals were higher in fish collected from cages treated with <b>antifouling</b> <b>paints.</b> Furthermore, statistical analysis revealed significant differences in copper and zinc concentrations among the samples from the farms with different use of treatment.

40|$|For centuries, {{different}} techniques {{has been}} used to prevent fouling on ships. Today, different types of <b>antifouling</b> <b>paints</b> are used almost exclusively to prevent biofouling to attach to the hull. These <b>antifouling</b> <b>paints</b> contain, and leach substances that can be harmful to the environment, such as copper and zinc. This study aims to describe how fouling varies at different locations in Sweden and the reason for this. Furthermore, the study also outlines how water salinity affects the leakage rate of copper and zinc. In the study, panels painted with five different <b>antifouling</b> <b>paints,</b> was placed at three locations in Sweden. By measuring these panels with an XRF-instrument (X-Ray Fluorescence), before and after the launch, the leakage rate of copper and zinc could be determined. The results from the current study showed the fouling pressure to be higher on the west coast. Some <b>antifouling</b> <b>paints</b> in the study gave a somewhat surprising result, especially in freshwater, where fouling paints with high concentrations of Cu and Zn had a relatively poor effect against fouling. The results also indicate that the leakage rate of Cu increases with increasing salinity. This can also be seen for Zn in <b>antifouling</b> <b>paints</b> for leisure boats, though to a lesser extent. The result for commercial <b>antifouling</b> <b>paints</b> of Zn are the opposite; the leakage rate increases with decreased salinity...|$|R
40|$|Abstract We {{conducted}} a study about invertebrates on artificial substrates with different <b>antifouling</b> <b>paints</b> in order {{to answer the following}} questions 1) is there lower accumulation of organic matter on substrates with <b>antifouling</b> <b>paints,</b> 2) is invertebrate colonization influenced by the release of biocides from <b>antifouling</b> <b>paints,</b> 3) is the colonization of aquatic invertebrates positively influenced by the material accumulated upon the substrate surface and 4) is the assemblage composition of invertebrates similar among the different <b>antifouling</b> <b>paints?</b> To answer these questions, four structures were installed in the Baía River in February 1 st, 2007. Each structure was composed of 7 wood boards: 5 boards painted with each type of <b>antifouling</b> <b>paints</b> (T 1, T 2, T 3, T 4 and T 5), one painted only with the primer (Pr) and the other without any paint (Cn). After 365 days, we observed a greater accumulation of organic matter in the substrates with T 2 and T 3 paint coatings. Limnoperna fortunei was recorded in all tested paints, with higher densities in the control, primer, T 2 and T 3. The colonization of Chironomidae and Naididae on the substrate was positively influenced by L. fortunei density. The non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) of the invertebrate community provided evidence of the clear distinction of invertebrate assemblages among the paints. Paints T 2 and T 3 were the most similar to the control and primer. Our results suggest that <b>antifouling</b> <b>paints</b> applied on substrates hinder invertebrate colonization by decreasing the density and richness of invertebrates...|$|R

50|$|Ultrasonic {{anti-fouling}} {{should not}} be considered a complete replacement for traditional anti-fouling paints; instead, it should be viewed as a preventative measure to deter marine growth from a surface.

50|$|<b>Antifouling</b> <b>paint</b> (or bottom paint) is used {{to protect}} the hulls of boats from fouling by marine organisms. <b>Antifouling</b> <b>paint</b> protects the surface from {{corrosion}} and prevents drag on the ship from any build-up of marine organisms. These paints have contained organotin compounds such as tributyltin, which {{are considered to be}} toxic chemicals with negative effects on humans and the environment. Tributyltin compounds are moderately to highly persistent organic pollutants that bioconcentrate up the marine predators' food chain. One common example is it leaching from marine paints into the aquatic environment, causing irreversible damage to the aquatic life. Tributyltin has also been linked to obesity in humans, as it triggers genes that cause the growth of fat cells.|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of new <b>antifouling</b> <b>paints</b> requires understanding the parameters involved in antifouling activity and to develop new analytical tools for their evaluation. A series of biodegradable poly(ε-caprolactone-co-δ-valerolactone) copolymers varying by molecular weight and composition were synthesized, characterized and formulated as <b>antifouling</b> <b>paints.</b> The physico-chemical properties such as hydration, degradation, erosion and lixiviation of paints were studied. Microfouling (bacteria and microalgae) was observed by microscopic observations in a short delay, whereas macrofouling colonization was observed by visual inspection during one year. The <b>antifouling</b> activity of <b>paints</b> was modified by varying the composition and molecular weight of copolymer. The crystallinity appears {{to play a major}} role in antifouling activity, however the involvement of other properties such as hydration, degradation or erosion remains difficult to understand. Confocal laser scanning and scanning electron microscopes were used for the evaluation of <b>antifouling</b> <b>paints.</b> Results show that microalgae seem to be a pertinent indicator of antifouling activity...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA growth {{inhibition}} test {{has been developed}} based on two clones of the red macroalga Ceramium tenuicorne, one originating from 7 PSU and the other from 20 PSU. The species {{can be adapted to}} different salinities and the test can be carried out between 4 and 32 PSU. This test became an ISO standard in 2010 (ISO 107 10) for testing of chemicals and water effluents. In this study new and published data has been compiled on toxicity of single substances, waste waters from pulp mills, leachates from <b>antifouling</b> <b>paints,</b> harbour sediments and soil used for maintenance of leisure boats. The results show that the alga is sensitive to both metals and organic compounds and to biocides used in <b>antifouling</b> <b>paints.</b> By testing leachates from <b>antifouling</b> <b>paints</b> these could be ranked according to their toxicity. Similarly, the toxicity of waste waters from pulp mills was determined and the efficiency of secondary treatment evaluated. Further, the test method proved useful to test the toxicity in sediment samples. Sediments from small town harbours and ship lanes were shown to be harmful and compounds originating from <b>antifouling</b> <b>paints</b> were responsible for {{a large part of the}} inhibiting effect. The alga proved to be sensitive to contaminants leaking from boat yard soil. The {{growth inhibition}} test is a robust test that has high repeatability and reproducibility and easily can be applied on water, soil and sediment samples without being too costly. The species is found worl-wide in temperate waters, which makes the results relevant for large areas. In the Baltic Sea C.  tenuicorne is the most common red alga species and is thus particularly relevant for this area. The overall results show that contaminants from boat activities and the use of <b>antifouling</b> <b>paints</b> in particular pose a threat to the environment...|$|R

50|$|The {{approval}} of permits {{for construction of}} a new big marina in Golfito has been a process that lasted over nine years, not without controversy. Environmentalists and local residents opposed this project because of environmental concerns.

50|$|The {{advance of}} a vessel through water is {{resisted}} by the water. This resistance {{can be broken}} down into several components, the main ones being the friction of the water on the hull and wave making resistance. To reduce resistance and therefore increase the speed for a given power, it is necessary to reduce the wetted surface and use submerged hull shapes that produce low amplitude waves. To do so, high-speed vessels are often more slender, with fewer or smaller appendages. The friction of the water is also reduced by regular maintenance of the hull to remove the sea creatures and algae that accumulate there. <b>Antifouling</b> <b>paint</b> is commonly used to assist in this. Advanced designs such as the bulbous bow assist in decreasing wave resistance.|$|E

Artemia nauplii {{have been found to}} be suitable test organisms for measurement of acute toxicity effects of certain antifouling paints. The present study addresses the impact of a self polishing copper <b>antifouling</b> <b>paint</b> on the activity of the brine shrimp aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). Total ALDH activities from nauplii exposed to several sublethal concentrations ranging from (S/V) 50 to 1 / 4 (S/V) 50 were determined.

40|$|This report {{presents}} a joint Nordic project on method development for measurement of release rate of active substances from antifouling products. The {{aim was to}} evaluate whether a prolongation of a standard method for release rate measurement of copper from <b>antifouling</b> <b>paints</b> may give information which is of importance {{for the evaluation of}} the environmental effects of modern <b>antifouling</b> <b>paints.</b> The background was the suspicion that some new <b>antifouling</b> <b>paints</b> for pleasure boats have non traditional release behaviour in that the release rate is low at start and then increases to a higher level. To date, the standard methods do not detect this kind of release pattern, and consequently, risks for the aquatic environment due to high release rates later in the service life of the paints are not properly evaluated.
