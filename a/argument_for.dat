5|$|Gregory {{was one of}} {{the first}} theologians to argue, in {{opposition}} to Origen, that God is infinite. His main <b>argument</b> <b>for</b> the infinity of God, which can be found in Against Eunomius, is that God's goodness is limitless, and as God's goodness is essential, God is also limitless.|$|E
5|$|In May 2015, NASA {{reported}} that the Kepler space observatory observed KSN 2011b, a Type Ia supernova {{in the process of}} exploding. Details of the pre-nova moments may help scientists better judge the quality of Type Ia supernovae as standard candles, which is an important link in the <b>argument</b> <b>for</b> dark energy.|$|E
5|$|Mathematician Kurt Gödel {{provided}} a formal <b>argument</b> <b>for</b> God's existence. The argument was constructed by Gödel but not published until long after his death. He {{provided a}}n argument based on modal logic; {{he uses the}} conception of properties, ultimately concluding with God's existence.|$|E
25|$|Oral {{arguments}} {{in this case}} (as well as its companion case) occurred on November 7, 2006. U.S. Solicitor General Paul Clement, presented <b>arguments</b> <b>for</b> the United States, and Priscilla Smith presented <b>arguments</b> <b>for</b> Dr. Carhart et al. Solicitor General Clement also presented <b>arguments</b> <b>for</b> the United States in the companion case of Gonzales v. Planned Parenthood. Eve Gartner presented <b>arguments</b> <b>for</b> Planned Parenthood. The Supreme Court has made available audio of the oral arguments, in both Carhart and Planned Parenthood.|$|R
50|$|McLeod’s {{writings}} {{center on}} <b>arguments</b> <b>for</b> {{the existence of}} God, the legitimacy of Christianity as the only path to God, and {{the authenticity of the}} Bible. In A Well Reasoned Faith: A Rational Defense of God, Jesus and the Bible (2011), <b>arguments</b> <b>for</b> the existence of God are made on the cosmological, teleological and moral <b>arguments.</b> <b>Arguments</b> <b>for</b> Christianity are made using logical reasoning, historical evidence, eyewitness testimony, and archaeology. <b>Arguments</b> <b>for</b> the authenticity of the bible come from applying the bibliographical, internal and external tests.|$|R

5|$|Natural Theology or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity is an 1802 work of Christian apologetics and {{philosophy}} of religion by the English clergyman William Paley (July 1743 – 25 May 1805). The book expounds his arguments from natural theology, making a teleological <b>argument</b> <b>for</b> {{the existence of}} God, notably beginning with the watchmaker analogy.|$|E
5|$|Pet {{birds are}} kept in their millions, as are {{domestic}} fowls, bantams, and pigeons. These last had an important effect on evolutionary biology, as Charles Darwin took an especial interest in pigeon fancying, adopted the hobby himself, and made use of the wide variation between breeds as an <b>argument</b> <b>for</b> the power of selection in his 1859 Origin of Species.|$|E
5|$|Arguments {{about the}} {{taxability}} of compensation for personal services, whether called wages, salary, {{or some other}} term, may be either constitutional arguments as in United States v. Connor (see below) or statutory arguments as in Cheek v. United States, depending {{on the details of}} the <b>argument.</b> <b>For</b> purposes of presentation, these arguments are summarized here rather than in the article Tax protester statutory arguments. The rest of this section explains these arguments in more detail.|$|E

5|$|Attalea {{is a large}} genus of palms {{native to}} Mexico, the Caribbean, Central and South America. This pinnately leaved, non-spiny genus {{includes}} both small palms lacking an aboveground stem and large trees. The genus has a complicated taxonomic history, and has often been split into four or five genera based on differences in the male flowers. Since the genera can only be distinguished {{on the basis of}} their male flowers, the existence of intermediate flower types and the existence of hybrids between different genera has been used as an <b>argument</b> <b>for</b> keeping them all in the same genus. This has been supported by a recent molecular phylogeny.|$|E
5|$|Control over {{propaganda}} {{is another}} matter. When forming his argument here, Russell specifically targets the doctrines of John Stuart Mill. Russell argues that Mill's <b>argument</b> <b>for</b> {{the freedom of}} speech is too weak, so long as it is balanced against the harm principle; for any speech worth protecting for political reasons is likely to cause somebody harm. For example, the citizen ought {{to have the opportunity to}} impeach malicious governors, but that would surely harm the governor, at the very least (Russell 1938:179).|$|E
5|$|Dawkins is an atheist, and is {{well known}} for his {{criticism}} of creationism and intelligent design. In The Blind Watchmaker (1986), he argues against the watchmaker analogy, an <b>argument</b> <b>for</b> the existence of a supernatural creator based upon the complexity of living organisms. Instead, he describes evolutionary processes as analogous to a blind watchmaker in that reproduction, mutation, and selection are unguided by any designer. In The God Delusion (2006), Dawkins contends that a supernatural creator almost certainly does not exist and that religious faith is a delusion. He opposes the teaching of creationism in schools.|$|E

5|$|Descartes' famous <b>argument</b> <b>for</b> this {{position}} {{can be summarized}} as follows: Seth has a clear and distinct idea of his mind as a thinking thing that has no spatial extension (i.e., it cannot be {{measured in terms of}} length, weight, height, and so on). He also has a clear and distinct idea of his body as something that is spatially extended, subject to quantification and not able to think. It follows that mind and body are not identical because they have radically different properties.|$|E
5|$|Further work on {{the model}} has shown that a slight {{difference}} in assumptions can produce completely different results. For example, Eaton and Grossmann showed that if the firms compete in prices rather in quantities (Bertrand competition rather than Cournot) then the optimal policy is an export tax rather a subsidy – a policy rarely used in practice, politically unpopular and contrary to protectionist sentiment which generally touted New Trade Theory models as an <b>argument</b> <b>for</b> their favored policies.|$|E
5|$|Much of what {{is known}} of Euler's {{religious}} beliefs can be deduced from his Letters to a German Princess and an earlier work, Rettung der Göttlichen Offenbahrung Gegen die Einwürfe der Freygeister (Defense of the Divine Revelation against the Objections of the Freethinkers). These works show that Euler was a devout Christian who believed the Bible to be inspired; the Rettung was primarily an <b>argument</b> <b>for</b> the divine inspiration of scripture.|$|E

5|$|Notwithstanding that in NASA's {{judgment}} {{the contractor}} later made {{significant progress in}} overcoming the problems, the committee believes {{it should have been}} informed of the situation. The committee does not object to the position of the Administrator of NASA, that all details of Government/contractor relationships should not be put in the public domain. However, that position in no way can be used as an <b>argument</b> <b>for</b> not bringing this or other serious situations {{to the attention of the}} committee.|$|E
5|$|Plantinga's {{free will}} defense begins by asserting that Mackie's {{argument}} failed {{to establish an}} explicit logical contradiction between God {{and the existence of}} evil. In other words Plantinga shows that (1-4) are not on their own contradictory, and that any contradiction must originate from an atheologian's implicit unstated assumptions, assumptions representing premises not stated in the argument itself. With an explicit contradiction ruled out, an atheologian must add premises to the <b>argument</b> <b>for</b> it to succeed. Nonetheless, if Plantinga had offered no further argument then an atheologian's intuitive impressions that a contradiction must exist would have remain unanswered. Plantinga sought to resolve this by offering two further points.|$|E

Catacamas virus is found in a different population of Oryzomys couesi, and the presence of different viruses in these two species has been used as an <b>argument</b> <b>for</b> classifying the two populations of the host as separate species.|$|E

5|$|Shen Kuo's Dream Pool Essays {{argued against}} {{traditional}} Chinese beliefs in anatomy (such as his <b>argument</b> <b>for</b> two throat valves instead of three); this perhaps spurred {{the interest in}} the performance of post-mortem autopsies in China during the 12th century. The physician and judge known as Song Ci (1186–1249) wrote a pioneering work of forensic science on the examination of corpses in order to determine cause of death (strangulation, poisoning, drowning, blows, etc.) and to prove whether death resulted from murder, suicide, or accidental death. Song Ci stressed the importance of proper coroner's conduct during autopsies and the accurate recording of the inquest of each autopsy by official clerks.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Broadcasting Corporation {{stated that}} it wished to run up to four multichannels at {{different}} times of the day or alternatively offer an HDTV service. It claimed that up to $100 million would be needed to prepare for these services, half of which would need to be government-funded. Other interested parties, such as internet service provider OzEmail argued for the provision of spectrum for interactive services, while Telstra, shareholder in the subscription television provider Foxtel, supported ASTRA's <b>argument</b> <b>for</b> a competitive bidding process for digital spectrum.|$|E
5|$|The {{argument}} from morality is an <b>argument</b> <b>for</b> {{the existence of}} God. Arguments from morality tend {{to be based on}} moral normativity or moral order. Arguments from moral normativity observe some aspect of morality and argue that God is the best or only explanation for this, concluding that God must exist. Arguments from moral order are based on the asserted need for moral order to exist in the universe. They claim that, for this moral order to exist, God must exist to support it. The {{argument from}} morality is noteworthy in that one cannot evaluate the soundness of the argument without attending to almost every important philosophical issue in meta-ethics.|$|E
