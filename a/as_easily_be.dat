5|$|On 15 February 1500, Cabral was {{appointed}} Capitão-mor (literally Major-Captain, or commander-in-chief) of a fleet sailing for India. It {{was then the}} custom for the Portuguese Crown to appoint nobles to naval and military commands, regardless of experience or professional competence. This {{was the case for}} the captains of the ships under Cabral's command—most were nobles like himself. The practice had obvious pitfalls, since authority could <b>as</b> <b>easily</b> <b>be</b> given to highly incompetent and unfit people as it could fall to talented leaders such as Afonso de Albuquerque or Dom João de Castro.|$|E
5|$|The six-boat {{group that}} {{included}} UB-43 and UB-47 was ordered in July 1915, and both boats {{had been laid}} down in early September. This group was selected by the German Admiralstab for deployment to the Mediterranean, but, unlike the smaller UB I boats, they could not <b>as</b> <b>easily</b> <b>be</b> transported overland by rail. Weser prepared the boats for rail shipment by cutting the boat sections longitudinally, and sent all the materials, along with German shipyard workers, to Pola, where the boats were reassembled. UB-43 was launched in early April 1916, while UB-47 followed in June.|$|E
5|$|Eichmann did {{not make}} policy, but acted in an {{operational}} capacity. Specific deportation orders came from Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler. Eichmann's office was responsible for collecting information on the Jews in each area, organising the seizure of their property, and arranging for and scheduling trains. His department was in constant contact with the Foreign Office, as Jews of conquered nations such as France could not <b>as</b> <b>easily</b> <b>be</b> stripped of their possessions and deported to their deaths. Eichmann held regular meetings in his Berlin offices with his department members {{working in the field}} and travelled extensively to visit concentration camps and ghettos. His wife, who disliked Berlin, resided in Prague with the children. Eichmann initially visited them weekly, but as time went on, his visits tapered off to once a month.|$|E

25|$|The next {{feature to}} be {{discussed}} is the oval shaped curves representing islands of constant efficiency. In this figure we see 11 contours ranging from 56% efficiency (decimal 0.56) to 76% efficiency (decimal 0.76). General standard practice is to interpret these efficiencies as isentropic rather than polytropic. The inclusion of efficiency islands effectively generates a 3-dimensional topology to this 2-dimensional map. With inlet density specified, it provides a further ability to calculate aerodynamic power. Lines of constant power could just <b>as</b> <b>easily</b> <b>be</b> substituted.|$|E
25|$|The {{protocol}} {{is usually}} {{described in terms}} of a client-server model, but can <b>as</b> <b>easily</b> <b>be</b> used in peer-to-peer relationships where both peers consider the other to be a potential time source. Implementations send and receive timestamps using the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) on port number 123. They can also use broadcasting or multicasting, where clients passively listen to time updates after an initial round-trip calibrating exchange. NTP supplies a warning of any impending leap second adjustment, but no information about local time zones or daylight saving time is transmitted.|$|E
25|$|This comment has {{traditionally}} caused commentators {{to conclude that}} Luke was a Gentile. If this were true, it would make Luke the only writer of the New Testament who can clearly be identified as not being Jewish. However, {{that is not the}} only possibility. Although Luke is considered likely to be a Gentile Christian, some scholars believe him to be a Hellenized Jew. The phrase could just <b>as</b> <b>easily</b> <b>be</b> used to differentiate between those Christians who strictly observed the rituals of Judaism and those who did not.|$|E

25|$|Unlike, for example, the Market Portal of the Mainz Cathedral, the {{identity}} of the artist responsible for the Bernward Doors is not preserved. As a result, older research attempted to identify a varying number of different artists on the basis of stylistic analysis of the individual panels. Rainer Kahsnitz has since put these attributions in doubt, since the differences in execution between the reliefs is so marginal that they might <b>as</b> <b>easily</b> <b>be</b> the result of technical requirements as different artistic styles. Probably a single artist was responsible for the creation of the Bernward Doors, {{with a small group of}} apprentices and assistants.|$|E
25|$|As {{its name}} suggests, a shophouse often {{contains}} a shop with separate residential spaces. More generally, space {{occupied by the}} former contains a semi-public function. While this usually is, and historically usually was, a shop, it could just <b>as</b> <b>easily</b> <b>be</b> a food and beverage outlet (e.g. coffeeshop or bar), a service provider (e.g. clinic or barber), an industrial activity (e.g. cottage industry or auto workshop) or a community space (e.g. a school or clan association). Residential spaces are meant to accommodate one or more families, or serve as a dormitory for single workers. Popular belief holds that shophouses were initially occupied by single families, with their private living areas in one space and the more public family business in another. However, {{it is possible that}} the two spaces were always usually used by unrelated persons or groups, who may be tenants or resident owners. The position of the shop and residential space depends on the number of floors of the shophouse: A single storey shophouse tends to include residential space behind the shop, while residential spaces in shophouses of two or more storeys are typically located above the shop.|$|E

500|$|During the 20th century, one {{illustration}} was repeatedly– and wrongly– {{published as}} [...] "Christopher Wren, {{design for the}} Theatre Royal Drury Lane, 1674". Since 1964, this presumption has been disputed by scholars. Careful inspection of the drawing at All Soul's Library shows that it has one pencil inscription: [...] "Play house" [...] , {{which may have been}} added by a librarian or by anyone else. No sign of a signature (by Wren or anyone else) or a date appears anywhere on the drawing. Robert D. Hume of Penn State University explained that use of the drawing [...] "rests almost entirely on the supposition that the so-called [...] "Wren section" [...] at All Souls represents this theatre. It could just <b>as</b> <b>easily</b> <b>be</b> a discarded sketch unconnected to Drury Lane in any way." ...|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} positive reviews from television critics. The Orlando Sentinels Gregory Hardy named it the ninth best {{episode of the}} show with a sports theme. Doug Pratt, a DVD reviewer and Rolling Stone contributor, praised the episode {{as one of the}} best from season two. He commented that the miniature golf challenges [...] "are delightful, the denouncement is highly amusing , and the beauty of the whole episode is that it could just <b>as</b> <b>easily</b> <b>be</b> an episode in a live action TV sitcom, though the slight touches of fancy enabled by the animation enhance its comic impact." [...] Dusty Sanders of the Rocky Mountain News commented that the title of the episode is [...] "funnier than the content of most TV sitcoms."

[...] Kyle Anderson from MTV picked [...] "Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)" [...] as the best official World Cup song, calling it a [...] "funky, inspirational tune."

500|$|I, the Supreme (orig. Spanish Yo el supremo) is a {{historical}} novel written by exiled Paraguayan author Augusto Roa Bastos. It is a fictionalized account of the nineteenth-century Paraguayan dictator José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia, who was also known as [...] "Dr. Francia." [...] The book's title derives {{from the fact that}} Francia referred to himself as [...] "El Supremo" [...] or [...] "the Supreme." [...] The first {{in a long line of}} dictators, the Supreme was a severe, calculating despot. [...] The central themes of the novel are power and language and the relation between the two. [...] The Supreme believes himself to be above all power and history: [...] "I don't write history. I make it. I can remake it as I please, adjusting, stressing, enriching its meaning and truth." [...] Yet this assertion is constantly challenged by the very fact that while he achieves power by means of writing and dictating, these very same methods can be used by others to dispute his authority. Not even his own identity, represented by the personal pronoun I, is safe and can easily be usurped as is demonstrated by the incident of the pasquinade. Language, as powerful as it is, can never be controlled and can just <b>as</b> <b>easily</b> <b>be</b> used as an instrument of coercion as an instrument of resistance.|$|E

[...] Scott Shetler of Pop Crush said that [...] "the crowd energy for the Britney cover didn't seem as high as when Swift covered Eminem in Detroit or Justin Bieber in Toronto." [...] Jenna Hally Rubenstein of MTV, however, praised the performance, and noted that the show's crowd gave a positive reaction to the cover, saying, [...] "though the video is sideways and features the amateur videographer's own personal sing-along, the excitement in her voice is a testament to Taylor's song choice. Or in other words, we can almost guarantee that every normal, living, breathing Louisiana-bred girl in attendance at Taylor's show is also obsessed with Britney Spears." [...] Becky Bain of Idolator said that she had no doubts that Swift would cover a Spears song, but was surprised that the song Swift chose was [...] "Lucky". PopDust writer Katherine St Asaph said that [...] "Lucky" [...] is [...] "one of the few Britney lyrics that could just <b>as</b> <b>easily</b> <b>be</b> written for/by Taylor {{and one of the few}} songs that wouldn’t need massive re-arranging." ...|$|E
2500|$|Electrotyping {{was used}} for general purpose type {{manufacture}} in the nineteenth century, but was a somewhat disreputable process, leading to some typefounders disdaining it (or at least claiming to). This was because it could just <b>as</b> <b>easily</b> <b>be</b> used to pirate another company’s type as an original design. (It was also used to revive older typefaces in cases where original punches had not survived but matrices or type had, and so sometimes for licensed copying of typefaces in order to send matrices to other countries.) ...|$|E
