2500|$|Building a {{positive}} culture of healing {{is essential in}} recovery approach. Since recovery is not synonymous with cure a strong supportive network is required. <b>Appropriate</b> <b>housing,</b> a sufficient income, freedom from violence, and adequate {{access to health care}} have also been proposed. It has been suggested that home (housing first) is where recovery may begin. Housing services, if required, need to flexibly involve people and to build on individuals' personal visions and strengths, instead of [...] "placing" [...] and potentially [...] "re-institutionalizing" [...] people. Empowerment and self-determination are said to be important to recovery for reducing the social and psychological effects of stress. This can mean developing the confidence for independent assertive decision making and help-seeking which translates into proper medication and active self care practices. Achieving social inclusion and overcoming challenging social stigma and prejudice about mental distress/disorder/difference {{is an important part of}} empowerment. This may require recovering detached social skills and identity, making up for gaps in [...] for better self-management, etc.|$|E
2500|$|Enforcement of {{property}} code violations in Rochester had been {{handled by the}} Neighborhood Empowerment Team, or NET. Rather than utilizing a centralized code-enforcement office, ten sectors in Rochester were assigned {{a total of six}} NET offices by the city government. However, there had been complaints about the lack of consistency in the manner and severity of enforcement between NET offices. On July 16, 2008, the city announced that two of the NET offices would be closed and another relocated, due to what it had found to be the high cost and low value of operating the decentralized network. Following the restructuring, the remaining offices were renamed Neighborhood Service Centers, or NSCs. [...] There is now one office per city quadrant which resolve quality of life issues, work with neighborhood groups, and pave the way for <b>appropriate</b> <b>housing</b> and economic development. The majority of code enforcement processes were consolidated into the Bureau of Inspection and Compliance within the Department of Neighborhood and Business Development located centrally in City Hall.|$|E

40|$|Popular media {{plays an}} {{important}} role in bringing health issues and concerns to the attention of the general public. One such issue is that of culturally <b>appropriate</b> supportive <b>housing</b> for Canadians with mental health issues (Roberts, 2006). Understanding of this issue requires a familiarity with cultural competency and supportive housing, to formulate a definition of culturally <b>appropriate</b> supportive <b>housing.</b> The need for culturally competent care is not limited to the provision of health care services. It also encompasses the domain of supportive housing, and together the two have various implications on mental health. The need for culturally <b>appropriate</b> supportive <b>housing</b> is supported by a review and thorough examination of both the literature and two relevant determinants of health. Policies involving both mental health and housing have yet to concretely identify the need for culturally <b>appropriate</b> supportive <b>housing.</b> Therefore, in the future, policy makers should recognize the necessity of including cultural appropriateness into the supportive housing provided to mental health consumers...|$|R

The earlier houses were built in terraces of eight to twelve houses, but as wealth, confidence {{and the demand for}} housing grew in the 1880s and 1890s, whole streets would be built together in the form of one long terrace.
