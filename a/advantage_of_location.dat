40|$|Abstract — In multi-hop {{wireless}} ad-hoc networks, geographical ad-hoc {{routing protocols}} take <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>location</b> information so that stateless and efficient routing is feasible. However, such routing protocols are {{heavily dependent on}} the existence of scalable location management services, which are able to provide the location of any host at any time throughout the network. On the other hand, location management is an inherently hard problem: First, when one node requests the location of another node, it has no prior knowledge beyond the identifier of the requested node. Yet, it is impossible to maintain a static relation between the node’s identifier and its location, due to node mobility. Second, a location management service needs to draw upon the support of geographical ad-hoc routing protocols to distribute location information, which, in turn, require location information in the first place, forming a functional deadlock. In this paper, we address the above issues and present a new and novel scheme to perform location management. With any location managemen...|$|E
40|$|International audiencePosition-based routing {{protocols}} take <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>location</b> information {{to perform a}} stateless and efficient routing. To enable position-based routing, a node {{must be able to}} discover the location of the messages' destination node. This task is typically accomplished by a location service. Recently, several location service protocols have been developed for ad hoc networks. In this paper we propose a novel location service called PHLS: Predictive Hierarchical Location Service. In PHLS, the entire network is partitioned into a hierarchy of smaller and smaller regions. For each node, one node in each-level region of the hierarchy is chosen as its local location server. When the network initializes or when a node attaches the network, nodes contact their local location server with their current location information (ie. position and velocity). Then, they only need to update their location server when they move away from their current region. Finally, nodes query their location servers and get the exact or predicted location of destination node...|$|E
40|$|Location-Based Services (LBSs) utilize {{information}} about users’ locations through location-aware mobile devices to provide services, such as nearest features of interest, they request. This {{is a common}} strategy in LBSs and although it is needed and benefits the users, there are additional benefits when future locations (e. g., locations at later times) are predicted. One major <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>location</b> prediction is that it provides LBSs with extended resources, mainly time, to improve system reliability which in return increases the users ’ confidence {{and the demand for}} LBSs. However, much of the current location prediction research is focused on generalized location models, where the geographic extent is divided into regular-shape cells. These models are not suitable for certain LBSs whose objective is to compute and present on-road services, because a cell may contain several roads while the computation and delivery of a service may require the exact road on which the user is driving. We propose a new model, called Predictive Location Model (PLM), to predict locations in LBSs with road-level granularities. The premise of PLM is geometrical and topological techniques allowing users to receive timely and desired services...|$|E

40|$|In ad-hoc networks, {{geographical}} {{routing protocols}} take <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>location</b> information so that stateless and efficient routing is feasible. However, such routing protocols are {{heavily dependent on}} the existence of scalable location management services. In this paper, we present a novel scheme to perform scalable location management. With any location management schemes, a specific node, A, in the network trusts a small subset of nodes, namely its location servers, and periodically updates them with its location. Our approach adopts a similar strategy, but a different and original approach to select such location servers. The main contributions of the paper are: First, we present a selection algorithm used to designate location servers of a node by its identifier. Second, we propose a hierarchical addressing model for mobile ad-hoc networks, where node locations could be represented at different accuracy levels. With this approach, different location servers may carry location information of different levels of accuracy and only a small set of location servers needs to be updated when the node moves. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, we are able to show that the control message overhead is bounded under our scheme. Finally, simulation results are presented to demonstrate the performance of our location management scheme...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{overall economic}} growth {{performance in the}} Arab world since the mid 1960 s, with the key objective of developing a better understanding about what drives the growth process in the Arab region. Growth in the region since 1985 has been rather disappointing, both relative to the best performers {{in the developing world}} as well as compared to the pre- 1985 period. Revitalizing growth in the Arab world would, therefore, suggests asking two pivotal questions: why has growth in the Arab world lagged behind those developing countries that could be taken to represent the frontier in terms of the development discourse (East Asia) ?, and why has growth been so erratic and unstable in the Arab world? To address these two questions, I estimate two growth models on the determinants of long-term growth and the persistence of growth, using global panel data drawn from more than 130 countries. Consistent with received wisdom, our results suggest that growth is associated with some broad fundamentals: effective institutions for protection of property rights, stable macroeconomic environment, adequate human capital and favorable initial conditions. In the Arab world, however, our results also show that growth does not happen without deliberate development strategies for exploiting (and/or overcoming) country-specific or regionspecific potentials (constraints). We find two such growth potentials and one development constraint to be important in explaining the growth process in the Arab world: the <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>location</b> and geography; associate...|$|E
40|$|Most Central American economies {{experienced}} slower {{growth in}} the 1980 s than in the 1960 s and 1970 s, trailing far behind the Asian Tigers. Contributing to slow growth were severe external shocks, sizable macroeconomic disturbances, and widespread political instability. The challenges Central America faces now may be even greater, conclude the authors, because of Mexican liberalization, continuing instability of the real exchange rate, low savings rates, and, finally, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Improvements in per capita income are closely linked with exports to North America of labor-intensive manufactures. Earnings from the export of tropical agricultural products are important, but the Central American labor force is unlikely to earn higher wagers unless countries diversify more into manufacturing. The Asian Tigers began their economic miracles by shifting into such labor-intensive manufactures as apparel and footwear, which they could export to a vast high-wage market. But the US market for such exports is now more crowded and threatens to become more so, with exports from China and other very low-wage countries. With Asian competition hurting Central America's chances, {{it could be said}} that wages in Central America are set in Beijing, not in San Jose. The authors examine the critical drivers of Central America's future competitiveness: economic liberalization, uncertainty about the real exchange rate, distance from key markets, savings rates and NAFTA. Central American economies have low wage rates, and considerable <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>location</b> over Asia in selling in North American markets, especially Mexico. But real exchange rates in Central America are more unpredictable than those in Asian countries. Central America faces a chicken-and-egg problem. To stabilize its terms of trade, it must expand exports of manufactures. But instability in the terms of trade deters the investments that would lead to expanded exports of manufactures. By greatly increasong Mexico's attractiveness to foreign investors, NAFTA could be the straw that breaks the camel's back, as far as Central America is concerned. For this reason, the governments of Central America need to do all in their power to increase domestic savings and reduce investment risks. Exchange rate stabilization should be carried out obviously with appropriate macroeconomic policies [...] but also by encouraging exports of labor-intensive manufactures with appropriate incentives, supporting infrastructure and educational investments. The key conclusion is that the future of Central America rests importantly on exports to Mexico, a market today which is pretty much untapped. Investments in transportation infrastructure that can facilitate this emerging trade are likely to have very large payoffs for the Central American economies.
