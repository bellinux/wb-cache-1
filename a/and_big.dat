5|$|Nasodigitoacoustic {{syndrome}} {{is similar to}} several syndromes that share its features. Brachydactyly of the distal phalanges, sensorineural deafness and pulmonary stenosis are common with Keutel syndrome. In Muenke syndrome, developmental delay, distal brachydactyly and sensorineural hearing loss are reported; features of Teunissen-Cremers syndrome include nasal aberrations and broadness of the thumbs <b>and</b> <b>big</b> toes, also with brachydactyly. Broad thumbs <b>and</b> <b>big</b> toes are primary characteristics of Rubinstein syndrome.|$|E

5|$|Several {{anomalies}} {{affecting the}} digits (fingers and toes) {{have been observed}} with the syndrome. A broadening of the thumbs <b>and</b> <b>big</b> toes (halluces) was reported in two brothers. The broadening was apparent in all distal phalanges of the fingers, although the pinkies were unaffected yet appeared to be clinodactylic (warped, or bent toward the other fingers). Additional eports described this broadness of the thumbs <b>and</b> <b>big</b> toes, with brachydactyly (shortness) in the distal phalanges of the other digits except the pinkies in affected individuals. On X-rays of a two-year-old boy with the disorder, the brachydactyly was shown {{to be caused by}} shortening of epiphyses (joint-ends) of the distal phalanges. The broadness and brachydactyly of the big toes in particular may give them a stunted, rounded and stub-like appearance.|$|E
