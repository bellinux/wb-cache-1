40|$|<b>Aromatic</b> {{extracts}} (AEs; <b>distillate</b> AEs [DAEs] and residual AEs [RAEs]) are complex, highly {{viscous liquid}} petroleum streams with variable compositions derived by extraction of <b>aromatic</b> compounds from <b>distillate</b> and residual petroleum fractions from a vacuum distillation tower, respectively. The DAEs generally contain {{significant amounts of}} polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs) and are carcinogenic. The RAEs typically contain lower concentrations of biologically active PACs. The PACs in refinery streams can cause effects in repeated-dose and developmental toxicity studies. In a 13 -week dermal study, light paraffinic DAE had several dose-related effects involving multiple organs; no-observed-effect level was 2000 mg/kg/d, reflecting differences due to variation in PACs. The NOAELs for RAEs were 500 mg/kg for 90 -day studies and 2000 mg/kg for developmental toxicity. Reproductive toxicity is {{not considered to be}} a sensitive end point for AEs based on the toxicity tests with DAEs, RAEs, and other PAC-containing petroleum substances. In vivo micronucleus tests on heavy paraffinic DAE, RAEs, and a range of other petroleum substances have been negative. The exception to this general trend was a marginally positive response with light paraffinic DAE. Most DAEs are considered unlikely to produce chromosomal effects in vivo...|$|R

Influence of the pA-m-EPO on bound rubber content, total mixing energy, Mooney viscosity and curing characteristics of carbon black filled natural rubber compound together with mechanical and morphological properties of carbon black filled natural rubber vulcanizates was later studied. Results showed that the NR compound and vulcanizate with using the pA-m-EPO gave inferior properties than those of using the aromatic oil.

40|$|Rubber {{processing}} oil {{based on}} modified epoxidized vegetable oils (m-EVO) was prepared by a reaction of epoxidized palm oil EPO) or epoxidized soybean oil (ESBO) with N-Phenyl-ρ-phenylenediamine (PPD) at a mole ratio of 1 : 0. 5. The comparison of m-EVO with <b>aromatic</b> oil (Treated <b>distillate</b> <b>aromatic</b> extract, TDAE) on extrusion process behaviors (output rate, extrusion rate, screw efficiency, heat generation, die swell, extrudate appearance) of carbon black (N 330) filled natural rubber (NR) compound was made. It {{was found that}} the mooney viscosity of m-EVO based natural rubber compounds are slightly higher than that of the TDAE based natural rubber compound (ML(1 + 4) 100 oC: m-ESBO 65. 5 ± 0. 7; m-EPO 59. 7 ± 0. 2; TDAE 56. 5 ± 1. 0), which probably due to the poorer filler dispersion in the compounds. The extrusion process behaviors for output rate (g/min: m-ESBO 191. 0 ± 0. 6; m-EPO 191. 2 ± 0. 4; TDAE 195. 5 ± 0. 6), extrusion rate (cm 3 /min: m-ESBO 179. 6 ± 0. 6; m-EPO 183. 2 ± 0. 4; TDAE 186. 4 ± 0. 6) and screw efficiency (%: m-ESBO 30. 8 ± 0. 6; m-EPO 31. 4 ± 0. 4; TDAE 32. 0 ± 0. 6). All the three compounds show similar extrusion process behaviors in which the TDAE based compounds shows a marginal higher values than the m-EVO as its lower mooney viscosity lead to a better flow. The m-EPO and m-ESBO based natural rubber compounds show very similar extrusion process behaviors. The heat generation (oC: m-ESBO 61. 0 ± 0. 8; m-EPO 62. 1 ± 0. 4; TDAE 63. 1 ± 1. 0) and die swell (%: m-ESBO 11. 0 ± 0. 7; m-EPO 11. 0 ± 0. 5; TDAE 12. 7 ± 0. 3) of the m-EVO based natural rubber compounds are slightly lower than those of the TDAE based natural rubber compound. As there are no significant differences in the extrusion process behaviors, with respect to extrusion process, m-EVO can be used to replace TDAE oil...|$|R
40|$|The oils are {{generally}} {{added in the}} rubber compounds to improve processing properties, low temperature properties, dispersion of fillers, and to reduce cost. The conventionally widely used oils in tire compounds are <b>Distillate</b> <b>Aromatic</b> Extract (DAE) oils, which contain {{a high concentration of}} Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs). PAHs that can be released from tires by tire wear are harmful to health and environment, so safe process oils are needed to replace aromatic oil in tire compounds. This thesis comparatively studies the influences of PAH-free petroleum based extender oils, i. e. Treated <b>Distillate</b> <b>Aromatic</b> Extract (TDAE) and Mild Extracted Solvate (MES), versus the DAE oil on the properties of NR-based truck tire tread compounds and NR/SBR-based passenger tire tread compounds. Oil characterization data are analyzed, and the influence of the oils on the properties of unfilled compounds is also elucidated. The different chemical structures and compositions of DAE-, TDAE- and MES-oils that affect on their characteristics, have influences on their compatibility with rubbers and the properties of the corresponding rubber compounds. The theoretical predictions based on differences in solubility parameters (Δδ) and the experimental swelling study agree well in that MES is less compatible with NR and SBR compared with TDAE and DAE. The difference of cure characteristics, due to the presence of nitrogen-and sulfur-heterocyclic species in DAE oil, as observed in unfilled compounds, is diminished in the carbon black-filled compounds. The mechanical properties of both unfilled and carbon black filled compounds are little influenced by the change of oil types, but the properties are changed according to the oil loadings, basically due to the dilution effect. The different glass transition temperatures (Tg) of the oils affect the Tg’s of the rubber vulcanizates and hence the viscoelastic-related properties, i. e. abrasion resistance, rebound resilience, heat build-up and loss tangent. The replacement of toxic DAE by safe TDAE and MES enhances the elastic response of the materials. Based on the processing properties of the uncured compounds and mechanical as well as dynamic properties of the vulcanizates, TDAE oil provides better overall properties as replacement for DAE oil than MES...|$|R

In the subchronic study, undiluted DAE was applied on the shaved backs {{of male and}} female rats at dose levels of 0, 30, 125, 500, and 1250 mg/kg for 13 weeks, 5 days per week. Exposure sites were not covered. In the developmental toxicity study, DAE was similarly applied, but to pregnant rats at dose levels of 0, 8, 30, and 125 mg/kg on Gestation Days 0 - 19, 500 mg/kg on Gestation Days 0 - 16, and 1000 mg/kg on Gestation Days 10 - 12. Evidence of toxicity observed in the subchronic study included death, decreased body weights, aberrant serum chemistry and hematology values, altered organ weights, and histopathologic changes in a variety of organs.

40|$|In this study, {{the effect}} of Treated <b>Distillate</b> <b>Aromatic</b> Extract (TDAE) was {{investigated}} in medium styrene/high vinyl solution styrene butadiene rubber (S-SBR) and high cis-polybutadiene rubber (BR). Three properties were evaluated: (i) molecular structure (polarity/aromaticity), (ii) molecular weight and (iii) chemical reactivity of the TDAE oil. The fore-mentioned properties of the oil allow the prediction of its behavior in a rubber compound. It was known from literature that the addition of oil causes {{a shift in the}} glass transition temperature (Tg) of the compound [2]. Therefore, the study was focused on the variation in the α-relaxation process or Tg of a rubber compound upon addition of TDAE. The conventional techniques for determination of Tg such as Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA) as well as more sophisticated relaxation studies using Broadband Dielectric Spectroscopy (BDS) were used to characterize the TDAE-extended S-SBR and BR compounds. Theoretical prediction of the Tg of TDAE-extended compounds was obtained based on the Fox equation for miscible mixtures. Ultimately, the theoretical predictions were correlated with experimental findings...|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the hypothesis of}} increased kidney cancer risk after exposure to hydrocarbons, especially those present in gasoline, we conducted a case-control study in a cohort of approximately 100, 000 male refinery workers from five petroleum companies. A review of 18, 323 death certificates identified 102 kidney cancer cases, to each of whom four controls were matched by refinery location and decade of birth. Work histories, containing an average of 15. 7 job assignments per subject, were found for 98 % of the cases and 94 % of the controls. To each job, industrial hygienists assigned semiquantitative ratings for the intensity and frequency of exposures to three hydrocarbon categories: nonaromatic liquid gasoline <b>distillates,</b> <b>aromatic</b> hydrocarbons, and the more volatile hydrocarbons. Ratings of "present" or "absent" were assigned for seven additional exposures: higher boiling hydrocarbons, polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, asbestos, chlorinated solvents, ionizing radiation, and lead. Each exposure had either no association or a weak association with kidney cancer. For the hydrocarbon category of principal a priori interest, the nonaromatic liquid gasoline distillates, the estimated relative risk (RR) for any exposure above refinery background was 1. 0 (95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 5 - 1. 9). Analyses of cumulative exposures and of exposures in varying time periods before kidney cancer occurrence also produced null or near-null results. In {{an analysis of the}} longest job held by each subject (average duration 9. 2 years or 40 % of the refinery work history), three groups appeared to be at increased risk: laborers (RR = 1. 9, 95 % CI 1. 0 - 3. 9); workers in receipt, storage, and movements (RR = 2. 5, 95 % CI 0. 9 - 6. 6); and unit cleaners (RR = 2. 3, 95 % CI 0. 5 - 9. 9) ...|$|R
40|$|L'analyse détaillée des distillats moyens est une étape {{indispensable}} à la compréhension des mécanismes réactionnels et à la cinétique de certains procédés de raffinage comme l'hydrotraitement. Une nouvelle méthode associant, d'une part un couplage chromatographie en phase gazeuse/spectrométrie de masse (CG/SM) et, d'autre part une analyse quantitative par famille chimique par spectrométrie de masse a été développée. La chromatographie en phase gazeuse, réalisée sur une colonne apolaire, effectue la distillation des composés présents dans le gazole et la spectrométrie de masse quantifie les familles chimiques par intervalle de nombre d'atomes de carbone ou de point d'ébullition. Elle permet d'accéder ainsi à la répartition par nombre d'atomes de carbone de chaque famille chimique (alcanes, cycloalcanes, hydrocarbures aromatiques à un ou plusieurs noyaux, hydrocarbures aromatiques soufrés). Cette méthode a été validée et appliquée à une charge et à une recette d'hydrotraitement. A {{detailed analysis}} of middle distillates is essential for understanding the reaction mechanism and for studying the kinetics of refining processes such hydrotreatment. In fact, when we see the complexity of saturated and aromatic hydrocarbon mixtures appearing in gas oil, we realize that it's necessary {{to have a very}} {{detailed analysis of}} those cuts to understand the mechanisms involved in refining processes {{and to be able to}} describe their kinetics. Each gas oil has a very different composition and therefore a specific reactivity. That is why we have tried to develop predictive kinetic models to avoid experimenting in pilot plants, which is very expensive. But, even if all the compounds of a gasoline (PI- 200 °C) have now been identified and quantified, using gas chromatography (1), such is not the case for heavier cuts. Only an overall characterization can be made, by chemical family. The techniques employed are, for example, HPLC (3, 4) or UV spectrometry (5). For a few years now, methods using mass spectrometry have been developed and also standardized for some of them. These methods quantify chemical families in middle distillates and determine the detailed composition of saturated hydrocarbons (alkanes, cycloalkanes with one or more rings), aromatic hydrocarbons (monoaromatics = CnH indice(2 n- 6), CnH indice(2 n- 8), CnH indice(2 n- 10); diaromatics = CnH indice(2 n- 12), CnH indice(2 n- 14), CnH indice(2 n- 16); triaromatics and polyaromatics), and sulfur-containing aromatic hydrocarbons. But all those methods give us only overall compositions. That is why a method using GC/MS (electronic impact at 70 eV) has been developed. Compounds are separated according to boiling point by gas chromatography in an apolar column. For each carbon number range (or boiling range), a quantitative group types analysis method is applied and enables us to determine the breakdown by chemical families (Fig. 1 and 2). Hence, it is possible to obtain concentration profiles for each family in terms of the number of carbon atoms in molecules. This analytical protocol is easy to develop and could be used with all types of spectrometer (quadripolar or magnetic). This analysis has been used for the study of hydrotreatment reactions and, more precisely, the reactivity of middle <b>distillate</b> <b>aromatic</b> hydrocarbons. To illustrate this approach, the hydrogenation of a catalytic cracking middle distillate (LCO) has been followed by this method. It was then possible to see the evolution of the different family concentrations in terms of contact time and to study precisely the hydrogenation of aromatic hydrocarbons. The distribution curves (weight%), foreach family quantified, in terms of the number of carbon atoms, were then plotted. The postulated reaction mechanisms were verified by checking the evolution of these curves. On the whole, the following succession of reactions can be proposed:Triaromatics - Diaromatics - Monoaromatics - SaturatedSulfur-containing aromatics - MonoaromaticsThis kind of analysis enabled us to develop a kinetic model of hydrodesulfurization, hydrodenitrogenation and hydrodearomatization reactions (17), which can be used to predict performances of LCO gas oil for fixed operating conditions...|$|R
