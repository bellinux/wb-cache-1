5|$|A large {{proportion}} of crystals in the rocks consists of antecrysts and xenocrysts, making radiometric dating of the rocks difficult. These include the <b>amphibole,</b> biotite, feldspar and zircon.|$|E
5|$|Phenocrysts include {{plagioclase}} in andesite {{with smaller}} amounts of <b>amphibole,</b> biotite, clinopyroxene, and orthopyroxene. Apatite and zircon form accessory minerals.

These rocks contain <b>amphibole,</b> clay minerals such as illite, kaolinite and smectite, feldspar, plagioclase, potassium feldspar, pyroxene and quartz. The composition of these rocks resembles that of the Altiplano soils.|$|E
50|$|<b>Amphiboles</b> {{crystallize}} {{into two}} crystal systems, monoclinic and orthorhombic. In chemical composition and general characteristics they {{are similar to}} the pyroxenes. The chief differences from pyroxenes are that (i) <b>amphiboles</b> contain essential hydroxyl (OH) or halogen (F, Cl) and (ii) the basic structure is a double chain of tetrahedra (as opposed to the single chain structure of pyroxene). Most apparent, in hand specimens, is that <b>amphiboles</b> form oblique cleavage planes (at around 120 degrees), whereas pyroxenes have cleavage angles of approximately 90 degrees. <b>Amphiboles</b> are also specifically less dense than the corresponding pyroxenes. In optical characteristics, many <b>amphiboles</b> are distinguished by their stronger pleochroism and by the smaller angle of extinction (Z angle c) on the plane of symmetry. <b>Amphiboles</b> are the primary constituent of amphibolites.|$|R
30|$|Plagioclase, Fe–Ti oxide minerals, and apatite {{are often}} found in crystal clots with <b>amphiboles</b> and also as {{inclusions}} in <b>amphiboles</b> (Fig.  2). This suggests that some crystals of plagioclase, Fe–Ti oxide minerals, and apatite likely had the same origin as the <b>amphiboles</b> and were entrained in the 4 I- 1 melt immediately before the eruption.|$|R
40|$|Polarized IR {{spectra of}} single-crystals of <b>amphiboles</b> {{show that the}} molar {{absorptivity}} of the fundamental vibrational OH band is strongly wavenumber dependent, The intensity increases {{by a factor of}} 1. 6 from 3674 cm^(- 1) (tremolite endmember; MgMgMg) to 3618 cm^(- 1) (grunerite endmember; FeFeFe). Spectra obtained from Ca and Fe-Mg <b>amphiboles</b> consist of sharp, well-resolved bands on a well-defined background. The high intensity of the OH bands in Ca and Fe-Mg <b>amphiboles</b> makes it sometimes necessary to thin the samples to under 2 µm thickness, whereas alkali <b>amphiboles</b> can be measured at 25 - 50 µm thickness. ...|$|R
5|$|Licancabur has erupted {{primarily}} andesite, but basaltic andesite and dacite {{have also}} been found. The rocks are dark and grey-coloured. Basaltic andesite {{was found in the}} older lavas, and dacite in the more-recent ones. Although the rocks have a seriate texture, the groundmass is hyalopilitic. Phenocrysts include <b>amphibole,</b> clinopyroxene, hornblende, orthopyroxene, plagioclase and titanomagnetite; olivine is found in andesite, and biotite in dacites. Plagioclase is the most common. The amount of phenocrysts in Licancabur's rocks is smaller than that in other Central Volcanic Zone volcanoes, such as Lascar.|$|E
5|$|The flank vents have erupted {{andesite}} and dacite, {{belonging to}} a potassium-poor calcalkaline series. Such a limited range of composition is typical for these volcanoes but might reflect {{the small amount of}} research conducted on them. Tephras of rhyolitic composition were generated by Monte Burney during the Pleistocene, according to compositional data. Holocene eruptions have near-identical composition. Minerals found in Burney rocks include <b>amphibole,</b> plagioclase and pyroxene; foreign components include clinopyroxene and olivine crystals as well as granite xenoliths stemming from the Patagonian batholith.|$|E
5|$|The {{continental}} crust {{consists of}} lower density material {{such as the}} igneous rocks granite and andesite. Less common is basalt, a denser volcanic rock that is the primary constituent of the ocean floors. Sedimentary rock is formed from the accumulation of sediment that becomes buried and compacted together. Nearly 75% of the continental surfaces are covered by sedimentary rocks, although they form about 5% of the crust. The third form of rock material found on Earth is metamorphic rock, which is created from the transformation of pre-existing rock types through high pressures, high temperatures, or both. The most abundant silicate minerals on Earth's surface include quartz, feldspars, <b>amphibole,</b> mica, pyroxene and olivine. Common carbonate minerals include calcite (found in limestone) and dolomite.|$|E
40|$|<b>Amphiboles</b> were {{synthesized}} {{along the}} joins tremolite–fluorotremolite, richterite–fluororichterite and potassic-richterite–potassic-fluororichterite at 750 8 C and 1 kbar P(H 2 O). Infrared spectra of the <b>amphiboles</b> {{were recorded in}} the principal OH-stretching region. <b>Amphiboles</b> of the tremolite–fluorotremolite series show one-mode behavior, a single band due to a local MgMgMg-OH-AM (M 5 vacancy) arrangement; this behavior is consistent with no coupling between NNN (next-nearest-neighbor) O 3 anions either through the O 3 - O 3 edge or across the vacant A-site cavity. The <b>amphiboles</b> of the richterite-fluororichterite and potassic-richterite–potassic-fluororichterite series show two-mode behavior, two bands due to the local arrangements MgMgMg-OH-ANa-OH and MgMgMg-OH-ANa-F (and their K equivalents); this behavior is consistent with coupling between NNN O 3 anions across the filled A-site cavity through Na or K that occupies the A-site. A mathematical model is developed to describe local (OH,F) ordering in <b>amphiboles</b> {{as a function of}} F content. The variation in infrared band intensities is consistent with complete short-range disorder of OH and F in the synthetic <b>amphiboles</b> of the richterite-fluororichterite and potassicrichterite- potassic–fluororichterite series...|$|R

5|$|Sodium and {{potassium}} are very abundant in earth, both {{being among the}} ten most common elements in Earth's crust; sodium makes up approximately 2.6% of the Earth's crust measured by weight, making it the sixth most abundant element overall and the most abundant alkali metal. Potassium makes up approximately 1.5% of the Earth's crust and is the seventh most abundant element. Sodium is found in many different minerals, of which the most common is ordinary salt (sodium chloride), which occurs in vast quantities dissolved in seawater. Other solid deposits include halite, <b>amphibole,</b> cryolite, nitratine, and zeolite. Many of these solid deposits occur {{as a result of}} ancient seas evaporating, which still occurs now in places such as Utah's Great Salt Lake and the Dead Sea. Despite their near-equal abundance in Earth's crust, sodium is far more common than potassium in the ocean, both because potassium's larger size makes its salts less soluble, and because potassium is bound by silicates in soil and what potassium leaches is absorbed far more readily by plant life than sodium.|$|E
5|$|The magma in {{volcanic}} pipes {{is usually}} {{one of two}} characteristic types, which cool into igneous rock known as either kimberlite or lamproite. The magma itself does not contain diamond; instead, it acts as an elevator that carries deep-formed rocks (xenoliths), minerals (xenocrysts), and fluids upward. These rocks are characteristically rich in magnesium-bearing olivine, pyroxene, and <b>amphibole</b> minerals which are often altered to serpentine by heat and fluids during and after eruption. Certain indicator minerals typically occur within diamantiferous kimberlites and are used as mineralogical tracers by prospectors, who follow the indicator trail back to the volcanic pipe which may contain diamonds. These minerals are rich in chromium (Cr) or titanium (Ti), elements which impart bright colors to the minerals. The most common indicator minerals are chromium garnets (usually bright red chromium-pyrope, and occasionally green ugrandite-series garnets), eclogitic garnets, orange titanium-pyrope, red high-chromium spinels, dark chromite, bright green chromium-diopside, glassy green olivine, black picroilmenite, and magnetite. Kimberlite deposits are known as blue ground for the deeper serpentinized part of the deposits, or as yellow ground for the near surface smectite clay and carbonate weathered and oxidized portion.|$|E

40|$|Cl-rich (> 3 wt%) calcic <b>amphiboles</b> {{are found}} in two kinds of petrogenetical environment. Type A is {{continental}} occurrence, which {{is closely related to}} high-grade metamorphism, i. e., calcareous metamorphic rock, granulite, charnockite and skarn deposit in the amphibolite and the granulite facies terranes. Type B is submarine occurrence, which is closely related to oceanfloor metamorphism, i. e., the metabasalts, metagabbro and metamorphosed ultramafic rocks from mid-oceanic ridges. Cl-rich calcic <b>amphiboles</b> from both rocks (types A and B) are mostly higher than 0. 9 in (Na+K) content, higher than 0. 75 in Fe^ /(Fe^ +Mg+Mn) ratio and higher than 1. 9 in Al^ content (total iron as FeO and O= 23). Unit cell volume of Cl-rich calcic <b>amphiboles</b> is distinctly larger than that of Cl-poor calcic <b>amphiboles.</b> Cl-rich calcic <b>amphiboles</b> from the rocks of type A are 0. 6 - 0. 95 in K/(Na+K) ratio, but those of type B are 0. 05 - 0. 5 in K/(Na+K) ratio. The low X_K values of Cl-rich calcic <b>amphiboles</b> of type B are due partly to very low K_ 2 O content of submarine basic and ultrabasic rocks, and due partly to ocean-floor metamorphism by the fluids of near seawater salinity...|$|R

[4]Al {{ranges from}} ~[*] 1.4 to 1.9 apfu (Additional file 2 : Fig. S 3), which covers {{the full range}} of [4]Al {{contents}} previously reported in <b>amphiboles</b> in Aso- 4 pyroclasts (Kaneko et al. 2007). Most <b>amphiboles</b> are characterized by a decrease in [6]Al content with a slight increase in [4]Al content, whereas <b>amphiboles</b> with [4]Al > ~[*] 1.7 apfu are enriched in [6]Al (Additional file 2 : Fig. S 3 a). No obvious correlation is found between [4]Al content and (Na + K)A, Ti, and Ca contents (Additional file 2 : Fig. S 3 b–d). In addition, [6]Al content shows a weak negative correlation with Ti and Fe 3 + contents. These observations suggest that (1) the slight negative correlation between [4]Al and [6]Al is due to Ti-Tschermak and Al–Fe 3 + substitutions; (2) the Al-enriched nature of <b>amphiboles</b> with [4]Al > ~[*] 1.7 apfu is due to Tschermak substitution; and (3) edenite and plagioclase substitutions are insignificant. Tschermak substitution is sensitive to both T and P conditions, whereas edenite and Ti-Tschermak substitutions are mostly temperature dependent (e.g., Anderson and Smith 1995; Shane and Smith 2013). Therefore, the crystallization P–T conditions of the Al-enriched <b>amphiboles</b> may be distinct from those of other <b>amphiboles.</b> The Al-enriched <b>amphiboles</b> are rare in the 4 I- 1 pyroclasts, whereas other pyroclastic units of the Aso- 4 eruption, which were hybrid of the 4 I- 1 magma and the mafic magma erupted as the 4 I- 3 and 4 II- 3 Units, commonly include them; on the other hand, the other <b>amphiboles</b> (with no Al enrichment) are common in the 4 I- 1 magma (Kaneko et al. 2007).|$|R
40|$|New in-situ {{trace element}} and {{hydrogen}} isotopic data of hydromagmatic <b>amphiboles</b> from ferropicritic gabbro-wehrlite intrusions and lava flows of the Palaeoproterozoic Pechenga Greenstone Belt (Russia) provide {{insights into the}} controversial source of volatiles that are implicated in Precambrian ultramafic magmatism. The intrusions mainly contain oikocrystic kaersutites and pargasites, whereas lava flows generally include idiomorphic Fe-kaersutites and Fe-pargasites. All orthomagmatic <b>amphiboles</b> display slightly LREE-enriched chondrite-normalised patterns. Primitive mantle-normalised patterns of <b>amphiboles</b> from the intrusions display positive Nb-Ta, moderate negative Th-U and distinctive negative Sr-Li anomalies. Conversely, Fe-kaersutites and Fe-pargasites from the lava flows display undepleted Th, U, Sr and Li signatures. Boron and Cl enrichment is primarily observed in secondary edenites, which locally rim orthomagmatic kaersutites. In-situ δD measurements of hydromagmatic <b>amphiboles</b> from the gabbro-wehrlite intrusions display values ranging between - 70 ‰ and - 170 ‰, and total water contents between 1 and 3 wt. %. Conversely, primary hydromagmatic <b>amphiboles</b> from the Pechenga flows display lighter δD compositions ranging between - 100 ‰ and - 270 ‰, and lower (< 2 wt. %) total water contents. The Ti- and Nb-Ta-enriched nature of hydromagmatic <b>amphiboles</b> from the intrusions and lava flows indicates {{that the source of}} volatiles in the Pechenga ferropicrites could be either a metasomatised subcontinental mantle or a volatile-bearing plume. Positive Nb-Ta/La anomalies in <b>amphiboles</b> from the intrusions rule out crustal contamination with granitoid crust during petrogenesis and emplacement as the main source of the volatiles. Local B-Cl enrichment suggests that some samples may have interacted with hydrothermal fluids. The range of in-situ δD values in hydromagmatic <b>amphiboles</b> is consistent with the presence of magmatic water. The lighter hydrogen isotopic composition and lower water contents of the primary igneous <b>amphiboles</b> from the lava flows compared to <b>amphiboles</b> from the intrusions indicate that the lava flows degassed upon emplacement. Previous studies investigating the role of volatiles in Precambrian ultramafic magmatism preferentially collected data from thin lava flows, whereas thicker flows or intrusions have been generally neglected. We emphasise the necessity to re-evaluate the controversial role of volatiles in the petrogenesis of ultramafic magmas by investigating evidence from thicker flows or intrusions, which may have retained their full volatile budget. 13 page(s...|$|R
