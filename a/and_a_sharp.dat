5|$|Scaly-breasted munias form {{flocks of}} as many as 100 birds. Individuals {{communicate}} with calls that include a short whistle, variations of kitty-kitty-kitty, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> chipping alarm note. They sometimes flick their tails and wings vertically or horizontally while hopping about. The tail flicking motion may have evolved from a locomotory intention movement. The exaggerated version of the tail flicking movement may have undergone ritualization. As a social signal, tail flicking in several other species acts as a signal indicating the intent to fly and helps keep flocks together.|$|E
5|$|The {{king vulture}} has, {{relative}} to its size, the largest skull and braincase, and strongest bill of the New World vultures. This bill has a hooked tip <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> cutting edge. The bird has broad wings and a short, broad, and square tail. The irises of its eyes are white and bordered by bright red sclera. Unlike some New World vultures, the king vulture lacks eyelashes. It also has gray legs and long, thick claws.|$|E
5|$|This period saw a {{political}} alignment with the Eastern Bloc countries and a shift toward economic insularity. These policies, coupled with economic pressures {{stemming from the}} 1973 oil crisis, resulted in the rapid collapse of Madagascar's economy <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> decline in living standards, and the country had become completely bankrupt by 1979. The Ratsiraka administration accepted the conditions of transparency, anti-corruption measures and free market policies imposed by the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and various bilateral donors {{in exchange for their}} bailout of the nation's broken economy.|$|E

5|$|Turbulence {{and dynamic}} {{forces in the}} {{heliosphere}} cannot affect {{the shape of the}} solar corona within, because the information can only travel at the speed of Alfv√©n waves. The solar wind travels outward continuously through the heliosphere, forming the solar magnetic field into a spiral shape, until it impacts the heliopause more than 50 AU from the Sun. In December 2004, the Voyager 1 probe passed through a shock front that is thought {{to be part of the}} heliopause. In late 2012 Voyager 1 recorded a marked increase in cosmic ray collisions <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> drop in lower energy particles from the solar wind, which suggested that the probe had passed through the heliopause and entered the interstellar medium.|$|E
5|$|Upon first {{becoming}} a tropical cyclone, the depression was moving north-northwestward, around the western periphery of a weak ridge; the first forecast advisory by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) forecast the depression to gradually intensify before weakening and crossing the Baja California Peninsula. Located over warm water temperatures, the system developed {{an area of}} organized, deep convection near the center; with satellite intensity estimates of tropical storm force using the Dvorak technique, the NHC upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Norman about 12hours after it first formed. Strengthening continued, and Norman attained peak winds of 50mph (85km/h) early on October 10. At the time, it was officially forecast to strengthen further and continue northeastward. However, some hurricane prediction models anticipated quick weakening <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> turn to the southeast. Shortly after peaking in intensity, southwesterly wind shear increased, {{which led to a}} decrease in convection coverage. At the same time, a trough extending from California southward caused Norman to stall and turn to the east. The convection rapidly became separated from the center; by late on October 10, the center was located about 115miles (185km) from the nearest thunderstorms. By then, it had weakened to tropical depression status, and early on October 11 Norman degenerated into a remnant low about 530miles (855km) southwest of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico.|$|E

25|$|Global {{downhill}} folding (or one-state folding) {{is another}} {{scenario in which}} the protein folds {{in the absence of}} a free energy barrier under all conditions. In other words, there is a unimodal population distribution at all temperatures and denaturant concentrations, suggesting a continuous unfolding transition in which different ensembles of structures populate at different conditions. This is in contrast to two-state folding, which assumes only two ensembles (folded and unfolded) <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> unfolding transition.|$|E

25|$|The {{series was}} {{cancelled}} {{at the end}} of the 198586 television season, although it still had a 28% share of the audience in its time slot. According to Michael Gleason, Brandon Tartikoff's decision to give an early pick-up to the Stephen J. Cannell series Hunter left no room on the NBC schedule for Remington Steele. Two months after the cancellation, NBC executive Warren Littlefield reversed the decision, responding to an outpouring of support from fans <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> upswing in the show's ratings during the summer of 1986.|$|E

25|$|Cosimo III's reign was characterised by {{drastic changes}} <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> {{decline of the}} Grand Duchy. Cosimo III was of a puritan character, banning May celebrations, forcing prostitutes to pay for {{licenses}} and, beheading sodomites. He also instituted several laws censoring education and introduced anti-Jewish legislation. He imposed crippling taxes while the country's population continued to decline. By 1705, the grand ducal treasury was virtually bankrupt, and the population of Florence had declined by approximately 50%, while {{the population of the}} entire grand duchy had decreased by an estimated 40%. The once powerful navy was reduced to a pitiful state.|$|E
25|$|Import {{substitution}} industrialization can {{be assessed}} according to the contribution to value added by four main industrial subsectors: nondurable consumer goods, durable consumer goods, intermediate goods, and capital goods. Using data from the industrial censuses, {{the share of the}}se groups in value added between 1949 and 1960 shows a considerable decline in the share of the nondurable goods industries, from nearly 60 percent to less than 43 percent, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> increase in that of durable goods, from nearly 6% to more than 18%. The intermediate and capital goods groups experienced moderate increases, from 32 to 36% and from 2.2 to 3.2%, respectively.|$|E

Gates were installed to enable border guards to patrol up to the border line and to give engineers maintenance access to the outward-facing side of the barrier. Like the fence itself, the gates were designed to be escape-proof. They were hinged from the outside but opened inwards and the pivot pins were welded to prevent their removal.

It is also just opposite one of two curb cuts for a busy ]. At rush hour, the traffic light at the nearby northern end often backs cars up along 52 for some distance, making the turn into the gas station difficult, especially when vehicles on 52 make the left turn into the curb cut.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} argued that the key drivers for Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania are that Kenya wishes to export surplus capital, Uganda seeks an outlet for its surplus labour, and Tanzania wants to realise a Pan-African vision. It has also been argued, however, that the commonalities go far deeper. Many of the {{national}} elites old enough to remember the former EAC often share memories <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> sense of loss at its eventual dissolution. More cynically, others have argued that this historical ambition provides politicians with the ability to present themselves as statesmen and representatives of a greater regional interest. Furthermore, EAC institutions bring significant new powers to dispose and depose to those who serve in them.|$|E

In 2001, {{and even more so}} in early 2002, internal turmoil and Israeli military measures led to widespread business closures <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> drop in GDP. Civilian infrastructure, such as the Palestine airport, was destroyed by Israel. Another major factor was a drop in income due to {{reduction in the number of}} Gazans permitted entry to work in Israel. After the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, the flow of a limited number of workers into Israel resumed, although Israel said it would reduce or end such permits due to the victory of Hamas in the 2006 parliamentary elections.|$|E
