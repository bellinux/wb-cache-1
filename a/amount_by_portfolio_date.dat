40|$|When hedging in futures markets, {{the hedge}} {{instruments}} typically fail {{to match the}} exposed asset or <b>portfolio</b> <b>by</b> expiration <b>date</b> and/or underlying asset. The theoretical variance-minimizing hedge is given by the slope coefficient of the conditional (forward-looking) regression of the spot-price that one is exposed to on the futures price used as a hedge. We explore the hedging performance of simple rules of thumb and of unconditional regressions on past data, focusing {{on the effect of}} the choice of observation frequency, sample period, percentage vs. dollar returns, and lead/lag effects. Our findings are the following : (a) the effects of varying the observation frequency, sample period, etc., are much larger than the effects of using GARCH instead of OLS. (b) Regardless of sample size and estimation technique, the exposure is best estimated using percentage returns rather than (dollar) first differences. © In the case of delta hedges, and also a cross-hedges among closely related currencies, regressions are systematically beaten by naïve rules of thumb. (d) This relatively poor performance of regression-based hedges is not just due to errors in data. (e) The optimal estimation technique depends on the situation. For cross-hedges involving two European currencies, high-frequency OLS estimates is flawed by EMS-induced leads and lags among exchange rate changes, and the best regressions are those using monthly data from longish sample periods. For delta-hedges the dominant source of estimation problems seems to be a time-varying relationship between the regression variables, and the best regressions use daily data from short sample periods.

5000|$|The {{so-called}} [...] "sketchbook" [...] of Villard de Honnecourt (more correctly, {{an album}} or <b>portfolio)</b> <b>dates</b> to about c.1225-1235. It {{was discovered in}} the mid-19th century and is presently housed in the Bibliothèque nationale de France (BnF), Paris, under the shelfmark MS Fr 19093. It consists of 33 parchment sheets measuring on average 235x155 mm, or 9.25 x 6.1 inches. The manuscript is not complete, and its original extent cannot be determined. Because the drawings and captions are oriented in many different directions, the album {{appears to have been}} assembled in an ad hoc fashion, as if the individual sheets were not originally intended to be bound together into book form. It is unclear whether it was Villard himself or a later party who assembled and bound the leaves into a book.|$|R

50|$|The Elder Conservatorium {{provides}} a comprehensive range of higher degrees by research. In 2004 it introduced to Australia {{the concept of}} the PhD degree by examination of a portfolio of recorded performances, a concept since emulated by other institutions.

An application for the higher Doctorate of Music (DMus) can be considered (from existing graduates of the institution) in the fields of Musical Composition, Musical Performance, or Musicology, or in any combination of these three disciplines. Each year since 2004 the Elder Conservatorium has had the largest concentration of music research students in Australia.|$|R
