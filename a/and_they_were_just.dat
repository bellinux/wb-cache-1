500|$|Musically, [...] "Right Round" [...] {{uses the}} {{recurring}} pop rap themes of Flo Rida's music; specifically, similarities were noted between {{the song and}} [...] "Low" [...] (2007), with Allmusic reviewer David Jeffries calling [...] "Right Round" [...] its [...] "heir apparent". The song is [...] "" [...] and [...] "bass-heavy", according to Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly. The lyrics discuss being in a strip club with friends and tossing money at a woman performing a striptease. Additionally, the chorus line [...] "You spin my head right round, right round / When you go down, when you go down, down" [...] {{can be interpreted as}} a reference to fellatio. Bruno Mars, co-writer of the song confirmed in an interview with Entertainment Weekly that the song's chorus was referring to oral sex. Philip Lawrence, also co-writer, confessed the song was [...] "almost something we had accidentally written in the car one night just hanging out." [...] It was him, Bruno Mars, and Aaron Bay-Schuck. Bay-Schuck was playing to Bruno and Philip some tracks and wanted {{to come up with something}} big for Flo Rida, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> throwing out 80's ideas.

500|$|At 08:00 the NZMRB set out heading south-east, {{the plan}} called for them to assault Amman from the south. The vanguard was {{provided}} by the regiment with the 4th Squadron leading. When they got within [...] of the village, they came under a Turkish artillery barrage. At 12:00 when the regiment was [...] from the rail line, which would be their right flank position, they turned north. Then a Turkish train arrived along the tracks from the south. The regiment's machine-gunners opened fire of it, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> about to charge when it continued on into Amman. By now Turkish artillery and machine-gun fire was proving effective and the regiment was unable to make any progress. Hill 3039, in front of the 3rd Squadron, was well defended with numerous machine-guns, so the 4th Squadron were sent forward to support the assault. While 11th Squadron moved right, to the higher ground, to give covering fire. [...] At 18:00 Turkish troops mounted a counter-attack against the Canterbury Mounted Rifles on the regiment's left, but the regiment held the position. By nightfall no further progress was made and the division decided to hold onto what territory they had occupied and wait for assistance from 60th Division. The day's fighting had cost the regiment eighteen casualties. They still had not received any supplies and the rations they carried were exhausted.|$|E

[...] Bono described it as [...] "one of the toughest and one of the sweetest nights of my life", saying of the audience, [...] "I think they wanted, more than anything, a return to normalcy. That's what these people want, it's what they deserve." [...] He also speculated that the loss of his voice had [...] "allowed room for Sarajevo to take the gig away from us. They could see that things could go horribly wrong, they'd gone to a lot of trouble to come here, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> going to make it happen. And they did." [...] After the completion of the PopMart Tour, he said, [...] "it was amazing and confounding to discover that on our most 'pop' of tours some of the best shows were in political hotspots like Santiago, Sarajevo, Tel Aviv [...] anywhere music meant more than entertainment". Following the concert, President Izetbegović presented Bono with an honorary Bosnian passport, in recognition of his humanitarian efforts during the war.|$|E

2500|$|The Dodgers {{traveled}} to Phoenix {{to begin a}} four-game series against the Diamondbacks, needing to win just {{two of them to}} clinch the Western Division title. [...] In the opener, Hyun-Jin Ryu allowed only two hits in a complete game effort; however, one of those hits was a two-run homer by Paul Goldschmidt and they lost again 2-1. Matt Kemp and Hanley Ramírez returned to the Dodgers' lineup on September 17 after missing time with injuries and both reached base four times as Uribe and Gonzalez homered. The Dodgers snapped the four-game losing streak with a 9-3 win. They failed in their first chance to clinch the division when spot starter Stephen Fife didn't make it out of the third the next night and Ronald Belisario was pounded for five runs in relief. The Diamondbacks won 9-4. The Dodgers clinched the National League West championship with a 7-6 win over the Diamondbacks on September 19. Ramírez hit two home runs and A. J. Ellis hit the game-winning homer in the eighth inning for the Dodgers' first West title since 2009. The team's 9 1/2 game deficit on June 21 was the largest the Dodgers had ever overcome to win a division, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> the fourth team in MLB history to ever accomplish that feat. The next day, the Dodgers rested all the regulars in the opening of a series at the San Diego Padres. The backups could not generate any offense and the Padres won 2-0. Clayton Kershaw was brilliant the next day, pitching seven shutout innings while allowing just three hits and striking out ten. Yasiel Puig and A. J. Ellis both hit two-run homers in the 4-0 victory. Zack Greinke pitched five shutout innings as the Dodgers wrapped up their series with the Padres with a 1-0 win. Hyun-jin Ryu allowed only one run in seven innings and Puig and Matt Kemp each hit solo homers as the Dodgers won the opener of their final road series of the season, 2-0, over the Giants. Ricky Nolasco allowed six runs over 5 2/3 innings in his last start of the regular season, a 6-4 loss to the Giants. It was his third straight poor start. The Dodgers finished up their final road series of the regular season when Ángel Pagán homered off Paco Rodriguez to give the Giants a 3-2 victory.|$|E
2500|$|Lewis {{is widely}} hailed {{as one of}} the most {{influential}} pianists in the history of rock and roll. [...] In an often quoted tribute, Elvis Presley once said that if he could play the piano like Lewis he would quit singing. [...] Lewis's pivotal role in popularizing the piano in rock and roll is indisputable. [...] Up until his arrival, the music had been primarily associated with guitars, but his early Sun recordings and television appearances pushed the instrument to the forefront. [...] Lewis was also an incendiary showman who often played with his fists, elbows, feet, and backside, sometimes climbing on top of the piano during gigs and even apocryphally setting it on fire. [...] Like Chuck Berry's guitar playing, Lewis's piano style has become synonymous with rock and roll, having influenced generations of piano players. [...] In a 2013 interview with Leah Harper, Elton John recalls that up until [...] "Great Balls of Fire," [...] "the piano playing that I had heard had been more sedate. [...] My dad collected George Shearing records, but this was the first time I heard someone beat the shit out of a piano. When I saw Little Richard at the Harrow Granada, he played it standing up, but Jerry Lee Lewis actually jumped on the piano! This was astonishing to me, that people could do that. Those records had such a huge effect on me, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> so great. I learned to play like that." [...] Lewis is primarily known for his [...] "boogie woogie" [...] style, which is characterized by a regular left hand bass figure and dancing beat, but his command of the instrument and highly individualistic style set him apart. [...] Appearing on Memphis Sounds with George Klein in 2011, Lewis credited his older piano-playing cousin Carl McVoy as being a crucial influence, stating, [...] "He was a great piano player, a great singer, and a nice looking man, carried himself real well. [...] I miss Carl very much." [...] Lewis also cited Moon Mullican as a source of inspiration. [...] Although almost entirely self-taught, Lewis conceded to biographer Rich Bragg in 2014 that Paul Whitehead, a blind pianist from Meadville, Mississippi, was another key influence on him in his earliest days playing clubs, confiding, [...] "Paul Whitehead done a lot. [...] His lesson was worth a billion dollars to me...He taught me. [...] I'd sit beside him, and say, 'Mr. Paul, can you show me exactly how you do that?' [...] Mr. Paul was good to me." ...|$|E
