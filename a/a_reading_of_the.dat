25|$|The first visual {{adaptation}} of the book was a live teleplay broadcast from Alexandra Palace on 25 January 1949 by the BBC, which starred Russell Napier as the Time Traveller and Mary Donn as Weena. No recording of this live broadcast was made; the only record of the production is the script and a few black and white still photographs. <b>A</b> <b>reading</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> script, however, suggests that this teleplay remained fairly faithful to the book.|$|E
25|$|According to Theodoret, Bishop of Cyrrhus, Simeon {{developed}} a zeal for Christianity {{at the age}} of 13, following <b>a</b> <b>reading</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Beatitudes. He entered a monastery before the age of 16. Simeon was so obsessed with Christianity, he almost gave his body away to God. From the first, he gave himself up to the practice of an austerity so extreme and to all appearance so extravagant, that his brethren judged him to be unsuited to any form of community life. They asked Simeon to leave the monastery.|$|E
25|$|As {{with the}} Thebaid, Statius' {{relationship}} to Domitian and his court {{caused him to}} fall out of favor with critics and readers, but in recent times, the Silvae have been rehabilitated by scholars. Domitian is an important presence in the Silvae, and many of the poems appear to flatter the emperor and court. The content of the Silvae is primarily dictated by the needs of Statius' patrons, and many of the addressees come from the wealthy, privileged class of landowners and politicians. Statius' flattery of these elites has been interpreted in two ways by scholars; some maintain that the collection is highly subversive and is a subtle criticism of Domitian and the Roman aristocracy. Others urge <b>a</b> <b>reading</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Silvae as individual pieces that respond to specific circumstances with their own unique viewpoints.|$|E

25|$|More monumental {{than the}} three panels that preceded it, the two figures {{dominate}} the foreground of Eight Bells, {{and the details}} of the ship are minimally rendered. Homer has taken some artistic license, showing the figure at left using an octant to take <b>a</b> <b>reading</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sun, the other apparently reading the altitude of a completed sight on his octant. In reality, both observers would have had their octants to their eyes, rocking them back and forth to determine the highest elevation reached by the sun, thereby establishing local apparent noon. The moment is prosaic, yet it is presented as a heroic image. In 1887 Homer produced an etching based on the painting, in which he further minimized the ship's rigging and diminished the area of sky, thereby focusing more on the figures.|$|E
25|$|At the Seventeenth Session, on Thursday 13 June, {{there was}} <b>a</b> <b>reading</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{relevant}} sections of Pope Gregory X's constitution ubi majus periculum, {{in which the}} magistrates of the host city of a Conclave are required to provide security and safety for the participants. The Captain and magistrates of Pisa then took their oaths. Patriarch Simon de Cramaud then informed the Council that, while this was going on, the Cardinals had met behind the high altar and had emerged with an agreement to elect only with a unanimous vote, {{or at least a}} two-thirds vote of each of the two colleges. Then the three Patriarchs read out a conciliar decree, authorizing the cardinals, without regard to Obedience, {{in the name of the}} Council and by virtue of Canon Law to proceed to an election. A vote of approval was demanded, and despite some grumbling from a French minority, the decree was accepted. And finally a solemn procession and prayers was ordered for the next day, looking forward to the opening of the Conclave.|$|E
