5|$|Tuber oregonense {{closely resembles}} Tuber gibbosum, which {{grows in the}} same habitats, but may be {{distinguished}} by the structure of its peridium, <b>and</b> <b>differences</b> in spores size and shape. Further, Tuber gibbosum grows from January to June.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the fruit}} bodies of P.bembae are roughly {{similar to those}} in Xerocomus, species in this genus do not have the powdery veil {{characteristic}} of P.bembae. Two similar species in the same area include P.annulus and P.croceus, described in 1951 by Belgian mycologist Paul Heinemann, based on specimens collected in the Congo. Although the identity of these two species is not fully clarified because of insufficient collections, P.bembae differs from both in its larger cystidia, its cream-colored flesh with pale reddish-brown to light brown tones under the cap cuticle (compared to white in P.annulus and P.croceus), its yellow mycelium (white in P.annulus and P.croceus), <b>and</b> <b>differences</b> in ecology.|$|E

5|$|Another {{unidentified}} parrot specimen, {{this one}} brown and housed in Cabinet du Roi, {{was described by}} the French naturalist Comte de Buffon in 1779 under his entry for the Mascarene parrot, in which he pointed out similarities <b>and</b> <b>differences</b> between the two. The English palaeontologist Julian Hume has suggested the possibility that {{this might have been}} a lesser vasa parrot, if not a discoloured old Mascarene grey parakeet (Psittacula bensoni). The specimen is now lost. English zoologist and author George Robert Gray assigned some eclectus parrot (Eclectus roratus) subspecies from the Moluccas to Mascarinus in his book A List of the Genera of Birds from the 1840s, but this idea was soon dismissed by other writers.|$|E

Lê Duẩn countered that the only difference was how they viewed the Soviet Union and the United States. Following his visit, China (Xinhua) condemned COMECON. China halted all economic development projects between May and July 1978. During this period total Chinese aid to Vietnam amounted to $300 million.|$|E

H.conidiogena, a Spanish species newly described from in 2005, is also similar in appearance, but differs in the distribution of pigment in the cap, and the differential staining in response to the dye cresyl blue—M.flavoalba is positive, while H.conidiogena is negative.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{blackcap}} (Sylvia atricapilla) usually known {{simply as}} the blackcap, is a common and widespread typical warbler. It has mainly olive-grey upperparts and pale grey underparts, <b>and</b> <b>differences</b> between the five subspecies are small. Both sexes have a neat coloured cap to the head, black in the male and reddish-brown in the female. The male's typical song is a rich musical warbling, often ending in a loud high-pitched crescendo, but a simpler song is given in some isolated areas, such as valleys in the Alps. The blackcap's closest relative is the garden warbler, which looks quite different but has a similar song.|$|E
5|$|The gadfly petrels in {{the genus}} Pterodroma are seabirds of {{temperate}} and tropical oceans. Many are little-known, and their often similar appearance {{have caused the}} taxonomy of the group to be rather fluid. The forms breeding in Macaronesia on Madeira, Bugio in the Desertas Islands, and in the Cape Verde archipelago were long considered to be subspecies of the Southern Hemisphere soft-plumaged petrel, P. mollis, but mitochondrial DNA analysis, <b>and</b> <b>differences</b> in size, vocalisations, breeding behaviour, showed that the northern birds are not closely related to P. mollis, and that the Bermuda petrel or Cahow may be the closest relative of the Macaronesian birds. Sangster recommended establishing Zino's petrel on Madeira and Fea's petrel on the Desertas and Cape Verde as full species, and the species split was accepted by the Association of European Rarities Committees (AERC) in 2003.|$|E
40|$|Abstract-New {{methods of}} synthesizing low-side-lobe sum <b>and</b> <b>difference</b> {{patterns}} for linear arrays are described. By subarray beam forming, the sum <b>and</b> <b>difference</b> patterns exhibit a common factor, {{leading to a}} simple monopulse estimator. A procedure is proposed for the synthesis of the subarray-based sum <b>and</b> <b>difference</b> patterns which approximate a set of reference patterns in least-squares sense. Supervised nulling is incorporated {{as a means of}} suppression of strong interference. To further reduce system complexity, we impose the constraint that parts of the beam-forming weights are shamd by the sum <b>and</b> <b>difference</b> channels. The relationship between the maximum number of common weights allowable and the number of subarrays used is discussed. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methods. I...|$|R

On July3, Linfa's track briefly shifted to the southwest, by which time the convective structure had evolved into a central dense overcast. There was uncertainty in the storm's future as it approached the Philippines.
