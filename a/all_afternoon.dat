5|$|Before {{the largest}} crowd to ever witness {{a game in}} Vaught–Hemingway Stadium, Alabama {{defeated}} their long-time rival, the Ole Miss Rebels, 22–3. Alabama struggled to put {{the ball in the}} end zone <b>all</b> <b>afternoon</b> with drives stalled at the Mississippi 8, 4, 4, 4, and 13. Each of those drives resulted in a field goal by Leigh Tiffin, who was 5 for 5 on the day. Other special teams contributions included a blocked punt in the second quarter and a recovered Dexter McCluster fumble on a punt return in the third quarter, both by Cory Reamer. McElroy struggled, completing only 15 of 34 passes for 147 yards, but Mark Ingram ran for a then career-high 172 yards and accounted for Alabama's only touchdown on a 36-yard run in the second quarter.|$|E
5|$|Fighting {{continued}} around Hougoumont <b>all</b> <b>afternoon.</b> Its surroundings {{were heavily}} invested by French light infantry, and coordinated attacks were made against the troops behind Hougoumont. Wellington's army defended {{the house and}} the hollow way running north from it. In the afternoon, Napoleon personally ordered the house to be shelled to set it on fire, resulting in the destruction of all but the chapel. Du Plat's brigade of the King's German Legion was brought forward to defend the hollow way, which they had to do without senior officers. Eventually they were relieved by the 71st Highlanders, a British infantry regiment. Adam's brigade was further reinforced by Hugh Halkett's 3rd Hanoverian Brigade, and successfully repulsed further infantry and cavalry attacks sent by Reille. Hougoumont held out {{until the end of the}} battle.|$|E
5|$|The day of {{the event}} has special {{activities}} and offers across Magnificent Mile businesses, plus interactive holiday booths in Pioneer Court, and a free concert with free concerts featuring popular artists <b>all</b> <b>afternoon</b> on the Harris Stage (past artists have included Jason Mraz, Mitchel Musso, and KT Tunstall). In the evening, Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse lead a procession down Michigan Avenue from Oak Street to Wacker Drive, stopping at each block to light the trees. He brings along other Disney friends, marching bands, celebrities and more. It is considered the first annual Christmas procession of the year.|$|E

5|$|Antonio Ezequiel {{was killed}} by the Mexican Navy at around 6:00p.m. in {{downtown}} Matamoros on 5 November 2010, but the roadblocks set by organized crime continued {{throughout the rest of}} the day. The drug lord had reportedly called for backup when he was surrounded by the Navy, but when he was killed, his reinforcements from Reynosa, Tamaulipas (which consisted of over 80 SUVs filled with gunmen) dispersed. The international bridges in Matamoros were reopened by 7:00p.m. after crowds of people had waited <b>all</b> <b>afternoon.</b> In Reynosa at around 9:15p.m., a grenade exploded inside a vehicle parked outside Plaza Real, the busiest shopping center in the city and just four miles away from the Hidalgo–Reynosa International Bridge. Reynosa also reported several shootings between the Mexican Army and organized crime on the highway that connects the city with the border town of Matamoros. In the municipalities of San Fernando, Río Bravo, Jaumave, Díaz Ordaz, Nuevo Laredo, Ciudad Mier, Guerrero, Miguel Alemán, Valle Hermoso, and Ciudad Victoria, most of the daily city activities were cancelled throughout the whole day. Organized crime gunmen and risk situations were reported in these areas, too.|$|E

25|$|Elliott and Goulding {{began as}} radio announcers (Elliott a disc jockey, and Goulding a news reader) in Boston {{with their own}} {{separate}} programs on station WHDH-AM, and each would visit with the other while on the air. Their informal banter was so appealing that WHDH would call on them, as a team, to fill in when Red Sox baseball broadcasts were rained out. Elliott and Goulding (not yet known as Bob and Ray) would improvise comedy routines <b>all</b> <b>afternoon,</b> and joke around with studio musicians.|$|E

25|$|The Meigs family {{returned}} to Washington, D.C., on November 3, 1852, after Montgomery Meigs {{was assigned to}} design and finish the Washington Aqueduct (a public works project which brought large amounts of fresh water to Washington, D.C., for the first time). His parents finally enrolled him in school (public or private is not clear). But his discipline problems continued. After one particularly violent temper tantrum, his father tied John's wrists together, tied him to a chest of drawers, and left him there <b>all</b> <b>afternoon</b> without allowing him to eat lunch. When Meigs learned that his son had untied himself, he spanked him with the rope.|$|E
25|$|After the Dallas Police arrested Oswald and {{collected}} physical {{evidence at the}} crime scenes, they held Oswald at their headquarters for interrogation. <b>All</b> <b>afternoon,</b> they asked Oswald about the Tippit shooting and {{the assassination of the}} President. They intermittently questioned him for approximately 12hours between 2:30p.m., on November 22, and 11a.m., on November 24. Throughout this interrogation, Oswald denied any involvement with either Kennedy's assassination or Patrolman Tippit's murder. Captain Fritz of the homicide and robbery bureau did most of the questioning and kept only rudimentary notes. Days later, he wrote a report of the interrogation from notes he made afterwards. There were no stenographic or tape recordings. Representatives of other law enforcement agencies were also present, including the FBI and the Secret Service, and occasionally participated in the questioning. Several of the FBI agents who were present wrote contemporaneous reports of the interrogation.|$|E
25|$|This type {{of action}} was typical all along D Company's assault line and every time the Australians {{received}} fire from a building, tank rounds were used to breach the walls and a small team of infantry would conduct room clearance until all resistance was quelled. During the fighting some of the VC had discarded their uniforms and weapons and attempted to mingle with the pockets of civilians that were unable to escape. The continued presence of civilians in the village required the Australians to expose themselves to extreme danger while trying to usher these groups {{to the rear of}} the battle zone. Others tried to flee the village, or hide in the small air raid bunkers attached to every house. The fighting continued <b>all</b> <b>afternoon</b> and only ended at last light. With Binh Ba still insecure, D Company and their armoured support subsequently occupied a defensive harbour for the night, exhausted by the fighting. Overnight B Company killed two VC trying to break out to the south.|$|E

500|$|In {{the space}} of a week on Tinian, four B-29s crashed and burned on the runway. Parsons became very concerned. If a B-29 [...] crashed with a Little Boy, the fire could cook off the {{explosive}} and detonate the weapon, with catastrophic consequences. He raised the possibility of arming the bomb in flight with Farrell, who agreed that {{it might be a good}} idea. Farrell asked Parsons if he knew how to perform this task. [...] "No sir, I don't", Parsons conceded, [...] "but I've got <b>all</b> <b>afternoon</b> to learn." [...] The night before the mission, Parsons repeatedly practiced inserting the powder charge and detonator in the bomb in the poor visibility and cramped conditions of the bomb bay.|$|E
500|$|Farrell {{notified}} Groves {{that the}} Little Boy bomb {{would be ready}} for use on or about 3 August, weather permitting.

500|$|In 1993, {{brothers}} Héctor and Oscar Serrano formed Grupo Manía in Puerto Rico. They enlisted Alfred Cotto, Reynaldo Santiago, and Elvis Crespo to {{tour and}} record two-step merengue music, popularizing the genre {{to a younger}} audience. In 1996, Crespo left Grupo Manía and signed with Sony Music Latin (the company which signed his former band), beginning his solo career. He said in a May 1999 Billboard interview that leaving the band was [...] "a very hard decision", since they worked well together. While Crespo was writing [...] "Suavemente", he began singing the song and discovered that his son [...] "spent <b>all</b> <b>afternoon</b> singing it". This led him to record the track, since he thought [...] " [...] would be a hit". Crespo originally intended for [...] "Suavemente" [...] and [...] "Tu Sonrisa", the singles which brought him international recognition, to be recorded with Grupo Manía.|$|E
500|$|The {{fighting}} at Hougoumont {{has often}} been characterised as a diversionary attack to draw in Wellington's reserves which escalated into an all-day battle and drew in French reserves instead. In fact {{there is a good}} case to believe that both Napoleon and Wellington thought that holding Hougoumont was key to winning the battle. Hougoumont {{was a part of the}} battlefield that Napoleon could see clearly, and he continued to direct resources towards it and its surroundings <b>all</b> <b>afternoon</b> (33battalions in all, 14,000troops). Similarly, though the house never contained a large number of troops, Wellington devoted 21battalions (12,000troops) over the course of the afternoon in keeping the hollow way open to allow fresh troops and ammunition to reach the buildings. He moved several artillery batteries from his hard-pressed centre to support Hougoumont, and later stated that [...] "the success of the battle turned upon closing the gates at Hougoumont".|$|E
500|$|The British gunboats and Carleton then maneuvered {{within range}} of the American line. Thunderer and Maria were unable to make headway against the winds, and did not {{participate}} in the battle, while Inflexible eventually came far enough up the strait to participate in the action. [...] Around 12:30pm, the battle began in earnest, with both sides firing broadsides and cannonades at each other, and continued <b>all</b> <b>afternoon.</b> Revenge was heavily hit; Philadelphia was also heavily damaged and eventually sank around 6:30pm. Carleton, whose guns wrought havoc against the smaller American gundalows, became a focus of attention. [...] A lucky shot eventually snapped the line holding her broadside in position, and she was seriously damaged before she could be towed out of range of the American line. Her casualties were significant; eight men were killed and another eight wounded. The young Edward Pellew, serving as a midshipman aboard Carleton, distinguished himself by ably commanding the vessel to safety when its senior officers, including its captain, Lieutenant James Dacres, were injured. Another lucky American shot hit a British gunboat's magazine and the vessel exploded.|$|E
50|$|There {{were two}} mistresses and about six {{resident}} masters, plus the two head masters and a retired nurse {{acting as the}} Matron and her assistant. The piano teacher, Mr Hathaway, lived in town and came to school on two afternoons a week to offer private lessons for an extra fee, after regular classes were dismissed. He also conducted singing lessons for the whole school. Evening prep was for one hour, devoting 20 minutes to each of three regularly scheduled subjects. Classes were held Monday through Saturday morning and <b>all</b> <b>afternoons</b> except on Wednesdays and Saturdays.|$|R

500|$|The barrage {{began at}} [...] and the 18th Division {{infantry}} advanced in [...] "snake formation". The divisional field artillery suffered {{the same fate}} {{as those of the}} divisions to the south, many guns sinking into the soft ground. A German counter-barrage began within a minute of the advance and as British troops took cover, German machine-gunners fired at the crater lips of shell-holes, through which bullets penetrated and hit the soldiers sheltering inside. The effect of the German barrage was worst on the right flank and added to German machine-gun fire from the Brewery and Helles House strong points; the situation at Requette Farm was not known as all runners sent from the area were killed. Mud clogged weapons of all types and at [...] a British trench-mortar battery and some supporting machine-guns had to cease fire, because of wet and dirty ammunition. At noon, German counter-attacks towards the west end of Poelcappelle began and lasted <b>all</b> <b>afternoon,</b> the Germans trying to exploit a gap between the British 4th and 18th divisions. Defensive positions in shell-holes were held by the survivors of the British attack.|$|E
500|$|The 1992 Indianapolis 500 was run in {{extremely}} cold weather {{which resulted in}} a large number of wrecks by cars on cold tires. Andretti accelerated off of turn three for the restart {{at the end of the}} 83rd lap. [...] Under acceleration, Mario's car got loose in the middle of turn four and rotated 270 degrees to smash nose first into the wall. Andretti was taken to the hospital with 6 of his toes broken and would shortly be joined by his son Jeff Andretti who smashed both legs after a wheel came loose on his race car on the 109th lap of the race. Mario would only miss one race due to his injuries, and returned to run 6th in a race just four weeks after his crash. The 1993 Indianapolis 500 was Andretti's last notable run, and he had just come off a victory at Phoenix. On pole day, Andretti was the first car to complete a qualifying run, and sat on the provisional pole position. Andretti's speed held up <b>all</b> <b>afternoon,</b> but with less than an hour to go, Arie Luyendyk topped his speed, and took the pole. On race day, Andretti was a factor most of the afternoon, leading the most laps (72). While leading on lap 134, Andretti was penalized for entering the pits while they were closed. A stop-and-go penalty dropped him only down to second place. In the final 50 laps, he began developing handling problems because of his tires, and slid down the standings to finish 5th. Andretti's last race at Indy was the 1994 Indianapolis 500.|$|E
2500|$|On 2 August 2017, a {{fire was}} {{reported}} {{on public land}} about [...] west of the small unincorporated gas-stop junction of Riley.
