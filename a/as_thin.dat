5|$|Critical {{reaction}} to the album was mixed, but largely positive. The departure in style from Hello Master was frequently noted {{for better or for}} worse, and comparisons of the group to influential hard rock and heavy metal acts such <b>as</b> <b>Thin</b> Lizzy and Black Sabbath were once again made.|$|E

5|$|Isaac Newton {{described}} comets as {{compact and}} durable solid bodies moving in oblique orbit and their tails <b>as</b> <b>thin</b> streams of vapor emitted by their nuclei, ignited or heated by the Sun.

5|$|On 19 April it was {{announced}} that Dee would not be participating after all, and that Judas Priest drummer Scott Travis would be taking Downey's place for all shows except Sweden on 6 August, when Europe drummer Ian Haugland played. Also, Aerosmith bass guitarist Tom Hamilton was confirmed <b>as</b> <b>Thin</b> Lizzy's bassist for these shows.|$|E
50|$|A single {{iteration}} of photolithography combines {{several steps}} in sequence. Modern cleanrooms use automated, robotic wafer track systems {{to coordinate the}} process.

5|$|Like most earthstars, G.quadrifidum is a {{saprobic}} fungus, {{and spends}} most of its life cycle <b>as</b> <b>thin</b> strands of mycelium, deriving nutrients by decomposing leaf litter and similar detritus, converting it to humus and mineralizing organic matter in the soil. The fungal fruit bodies are generally found in coniferous woodland, where they appear in summer and autumn. In Mexico, it was found in tropical thorn forest and pine-oak forest in the summer. In Britain, all collections {{have been made in}} beech forest on calcareous soil.|$|E
5|$|Edziza's shield volcanoes {{are built}} {{almost entirely of}} fluid lava flows. They formed {{as a result of}} lava flowing out in all {{directions}} from central summit vents and from groups of vents, building a broad, gently sloping cone of flat, domical shape. They are built up slowly by the accretion of thousands of lava flows of highly fluid basaltic lava, which spread widely over great distances, and then cool <b>as</b> <b>thin,</b> gently dipping sheets. In some shield volcano eruptions, basaltic lava has poured out quietly from fissure vents instead of central vents, flooding the surrounding countryside with lava flow upon lava flow, forming Edziza's broad lava plateau.|$|E
5|$|HeliumII is a superfluid, {{a quantum}} {{mechanical}} state (see: macroscopic quantum phenomena) of matter with strange properties. For example, when it flows through capillaries <b>as</b> <b>thin</b> as 10−7 to 10−8m {{it has no}} measurable viscosity. However, when measurements were done between two moving discs, a viscosity {{comparable to that of}} gaseous helium was observed. Current theory explains this using the two-fluid model for helium II. In this model, liquid helium below the lambda point is viewed as containing a proportion of helium atoms in a ground state, which are superfluid and flow with exactly zero viscosity, and a proportion of helium atoms in an excited state, which behave more like an ordinary fluid.|$|E
25|$|Typically, folding {{is thought}} to occur by simple {{buckling}} of a planar surface and its confining volume. The volume change is accommodated by layer parallel shortening the volume, which grows in thickness. Folding under this mechanism is typically of the similar fold style, <b>as</b> <b>thinned</b> limbs are shortened horizontally and thickened hinges do so vertically.|$|R
50|$|Frequently {{observed}} {{differences in}} the brain between ADHD and non-ADHD patients have been discovered, but it is uncertain if or how these differences give rise to the symptoms of ADHD. Results from various types of neuroimaging techniques suggest there are {{differences in the}} brain, such <b>as</b> <b>thinner</b> regions of the cortex, between individuals with and without ADHD.|$|R
50|$|Specific social {{experiences}} {{have been linked}} to specific psychological mechanisms and psychotic experiences in schizophrenia. In addition, structural neuroimaging studies of victims of sexual abuse and other traumas have sometimes reported findings similar to those sometimes found in psychotic patients, such <b>as</b> <b>thinning</b> of the corpus callosum, loss of volume in the anterior cingulate cortex, and reduced hippocampal volume.|$|R
5|$|Later {{that year}} he was {{assigned}} to the Manhattan Project, and moved with his family to Los Alamos, New Mexico. There he joined the Los Alamos Laboratory's Ordnance (O) Division, which was under the command of another Naval officer, Captain William S. Parsons. Initially the goal of the O Division was to design a gun-type nuclear weapon known <b>as</b> <b>Thin</b> Man. This proved to be impractical due to contamination of the reactor-bred plutonium with plutonium-240, and in February 1944, the Division switched its attention {{to the development of the}} Little Boy, a smaller device using uranium-235. Birch used unenriched uranium to create scale models and later full-scale mock-ups of the device.|$|E
5|$|The {{geometric}} {{thickness of}} the ε ring is not precisely known, although the ring is certainly very thin—by some estimates <b>as</b> <b>thin</b> as 150m. Despite such infinitesimal thickness, it consists of several layers of particles. The ε ring is a rather crowded place with a filling factor near the apoapsis estimated by different sources at from 0.008 to 0.06. The mean size of the ring particles is 0.2–20.0m, and the mean separation is around 4.5 times their radius. The ring is almost devoid of dust, possibly due to the aerodynamic drag from Uranus's extended atmospheric corona. Due to its razor-thin nature the ε ring is invisible when viewed edge-on. This happened in 2007 when a ring plane-crossing was observed.|$|E
5|$|These fossils {{have been}} {{preserved}} in a distinctive style known as Burgess shale type preservation, which preserves fairly tough tissues such as cuticle <b>as</b> <b>thin</b> films, and soft tissues as solid shapes, quickly enough that decay has not destroyed them. Moderately soft tissues, such as muscles, are lost. Scientists are still unsure about {{the processes that}} created these fossils. While {{there is little doubt}} that the animals were buried under catastrophic flows of sediment, it is uncertain whether they were transported by the flows from other locations, or lived in the area where they were buried, or were a mixture of local and transported specimens. This issue is closely related to whether conditions around the burial sites were anoxic or had a moderate supply of oxygen. Anoxic conditions are generally thought the most favourable for fossilization, but imply that the animals could not have lived where they were buried.|$|E

25|$|Mathematical {{operations}} can {{be performed}} on point processes in order to new point processes and develop new mathematical models for the locations of certain objects. One example of an operation is known <b>as</b> <b>thinning</b> which entails deleting or removing the points of some point process according to a rule, creating a new process with the remaining points (the deleted points also form a point process).|$|R

This in turn alters the structure of tropomyosin, which covers actin’s active site, allowing the formation of myosin-actin cross-links (the latter being present <b>as</b> <b>thin</b> filaments).|$|E
