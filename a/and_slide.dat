5|$|During {{the period}} between 1968 and 1969, NBN secured a relay from the Postmaster-General to enhance their news service. In 1970, NBN began {{upgrading}} its studios {{in preparation for the}} commencement of colour television at a cost of A$360,000. The improvements included an enlarged film department; a film editing and cleaning equipment; a larger master control with four video transfer machines; a new telecine room with caption scanner <b>and</b> <b>slide</b> drums; as well as an expansion of the administration and staff offices which also included new offices and a boardroom.|$|E
5|$|In both of God of War: Ascensions single-player and {{multiplayer}} elements, it {{is primarily}} a third-person video game viewed from a fixed camera perspective. Some scenes in the single-player campaign feature a first-person camera view. In single-player mode, the player controls the character Kratos in combo-based combat, platforming, and puzzle games. The enemies are an assortment of creatures, {{most of whom are}} drawn from Greek mythology, including cyclopes, cerberuses, empusas, Sirens, Gorgons, satyrs, harpies, and centaurs. Other monsters were created specifically for the game, such as the juggernauts, wraiths, and manticores. Many of the monsters also appear in the multiplayer mode. Platforming elements require the player to climb walls and ladders, jump across chasms, <b>and</b> <b>slide</b> down walls to proceed through sections of the game. The game features a variety of puzzles, ranging from simple to complex.|$|E
5|$|Like most of McLachlan's albums, Surfacing was {{recorded}} at Marchand's Wild Sky Studios in Morin-Heights, Quebec. Marchand, who produced, engineered and mixed the album, recorded {{it on an}} Otari RADAR recorder and a Neumann 149 microphone. McLachlan played piano, acoustic guitar and electric guitar and Marchand played keyboards, bass and a drum machine {{as well as providing}} background vocals. The other musicians on the album were Jim Creeggan on upright bass, Yves Desrosiers on guitar, musical saw, lap steel guitar <b>and</b> <b>slide</b> bass, Brian Minato on bass and electric guitar, Michel Pepin on electric guitar and Ashwin Sood (whom McLachlan married in 1997) on percussion and drums.|$|E

40|$|In this research, {{friction}} {{coefficients of}} engineering polymers such as nylon and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) are investigated under normal load <b>and</b> <b>sliding</b> velocity. Experiments are conducted when nylon <b>and</b> PTFE <b>slide</b> against different counterface pin {{materials such as}} mild steel and stainless steel 202 (SS 202). Experiments are carried out at different normal loads 2, 4 and 6 N, <b>and</b> <b>sliding</b> velocities 0. 2, 0. 4 and 0. 6 m/s. Results show that in general, friction coefficient of nylon decreases {{with the increase in}} normal load <b>and</b> <b>sliding</b> velocity. On the other hand, during friction process, PTFE shows different trend i. e. friction coefficient of PTFE increases with the increase in normal load <b>and</b> <b>sliding</b> velocity. Moreover, it is observed that at identical operating conditions, the values of friction coefficient of nylon and PTFE are different depending on normal load, <b>sliding</b> velocity <b>and</b> counterface material...|$|R

5|$|The Rolling Stones have assimilated various musical genres {{into their}} own {{collective}} sound. Throughout the band's career, their musical contributions have been marked by a continual reference and reliance on musical styles including blues, psychedelia, R, country, folk, reggae, dance, and world music, exemplified by Jones' collaboration with the Master Musicians of Jajouka, as well as traditional English styles that use stringed instrumentation like harps. Brian Jones experimented {{with the use of}} non-traditional instruments such as the sitar <b>and</b> <b>slide</b> guitar in their early days. The group started out covering early rock 'n' roll and blues songs, and have never stopped playing live or recording cover songs.|$|E
5|$|The {{visitor center}} {{is located in}} the Furnace Creek resort area on State Route 190. A 12-minute {{introductory}} slide program is shown every 30minutes.

The visitor center has displays dealing with the park's geology, climate, wildlife and natural history. There are also specific sections dealing with the human history and pioneer experience. The Death Valley Natural History Association maintains a bookstore specifically geared to the natural and cultural history of the park.|$|E
5|$|On 21 February 2007, a Class 73 derailed {{after hitting}} an {{avalanche}} between Hallingskeid and Myrdal on the Bergen Line. The accident {{raised questions about}} the class's abilities to handle hard snow, such as in avalanches. In particular, a DNV report from 1999 had shown that the train could act as a sled, lose contact with the tracks <b>and</b> <b>slide</b> on top of the snow. A former NSB employee who worked with route planning, stated that a locomotive-hauled train would be better suitable for such situations, because more of the weight is located {{at the front of the}} train, and it will therefore plow instead of slide. The National Rail Administration said that they took extra precautions for the Class 73 trains and that during snowfall they would run a snow-clearing unit ahead of all Class 73 runs. NSB stated that they would consider the possibility of reverting to conventional trains, but that unless new information could shed light on the situation, they would retain use of the Class 73 trains.|$|E

5|$|The {{main event}} {{was for the}} NWA World Heavyweight Championship, in which then-champion Jeff Jarrett was pitted against Rhino with Tito Ortiz as Special Guest Referee. Jarrett was {{accompanied}} to the ring by Gail Kim. A casket was positioned by the ring, as in storyline Jarrett planned to bury his opponent after defeating them. During the match, Kim distracted Ortiz allowing Jarrett to bash Rhino {{over the head with}} a guitar for a two-count. AMW then came to ringside to distract Ortiz <b>and</b> <b>slide</b> Jarrett another guitar. As Jarrett attempted to hit Rhino with the guitar, Rhino countered by crashing into Jarrett with his Gore maneuver for the pinfall victory at 5 minutes and 30 seconds to become the new NWA World Heavyweight Champion. After the contest, AMW, Jarrett, and Team Canada attacked Rhino and placed him in the casket. Team 3D came to his defense, as well as the 3LiveKru. A brawl between all the wrestlers took place, with Eric Young of Team Canada ending up in the casket and Rhino standing on top of it holding the NWA World Heavyweight Championship belt as the event came to a close.|$|E

40|$|Rolling <b>and</b> <b>sliding</b> play {{fundamental}} {{roles in}} the deformation of granular materials. In simulations of granular flow using the discrete element method (DEM), the effect of rolling resistance at contacts {{should be taken into}} account. However, even for the simplest case involving spherical particles, there is no agreement on {{what is the best way}} to define rolling and sliding; various versions of definitions and calculations of rolling <b>and</b> <b>sliding</b> were proposed. Some even suggest that a unique definition for rolling <b>and</b> <b>sliding</b> is not possible. We re-check previous studies on rolling <b>and</b> <b>sliding</b> in DEMs <b>and</b> find that some researchers made a conceptual mistake when dealing with pure sliding between particles of different sizes. After considering the particle radius in the derivation of rolling velocity, the results yield a unique solution. Starting with clear and unique definitions of pure rolling <b>and</b> <b>sliding,</b> we present the detailed derivation and validate our results by checking two special cases of rolling. The decomposition of the relative motion is objective; that is, independent of the reference frame in which the relative motion is measured. © 2015 Chinese Society of Particuology and Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences...|$|R
