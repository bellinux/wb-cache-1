On 11 July 1792, the committee proposed the names metre, are, litre [...] and grave for the units of length, <b>area,</b> <b>capacity,</b> and mass, respectively. The committee also proposed that multiples and submultiples of these units were to be denoted by decimal-based prefixes such as centi for a hundredth and kilo for a thousand.|$|E

40|$|Two {{important}} {{concepts in}} forest stand density management — the maximum basal <b>area</b> carrying <b>capacity</b> and the maximum size-density relationship (MSDR) for individual stands — are mathematically related. For stands with a MSDR slope less than 2, maximum basal <b>area</b> carrying <b>capacity</b> will occur after a stand has reached its MSDR stage of stand development, or after Reineke’s SDI has been maximized. Maximum basal <b>area</b> carrying <b>capacity</b> and the MSDR stage of stand development will occur simultaneously in a stand {{that has a}} MSDR slope equal to 2. If a MSDR’s slope is greater than 2, a stand will reach its maximum basal <b>area</b> carrying <b>capacity</b> prior to reaching its MSDR stage of stand development...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn many cities, worldwide, city {{centers are}} highly congested. The {{reason is that}} the <b>Area</b> Traffic <b>Capacity</b> (ATC) becomes constrained; i. e. the traffic and parking demands (mainly motorized), continually, {{increase}} within a finite roads’ and car parks’ <b>capacity.</b> The central <b>Area</b> Traffic <b>Capacity</b> (ATC) could be either the capacity of the internal road network, the parking capacity, or the capacity of the approach roads leading into the area. One of these three elements limits the overall traffic capacity. Therefore, the main objective {{of this paper is to}} develop a planning process which can be used as a tool for determining the ATC, and producing and evaluating different solutions (or scenarios) that can improve a central <b>area</b> traffic <b>capacity.</b> The proposed planning process is based on a combined analysis of traffic and parking situations which result from the travel demand and the traffic supply in a city center. If the travel demand is greater than the <b>area</b> traffic <b>capacity,</b> the process reflects feedback effects of parking and traffic situations on the desired supply or demand. Thus, it can be used to analyze different possible improving strategies, which might be needed to achieve favorable situations (formulating scenarios). The proposed planning process is then applied to estimate the <b>area</b> traffic <b>capacity</b> of Alexandria city center and to analyze the impacts of applying some traffic strategies in order to improve the ATC...|$|R

5000|$|The stacked, shine-through {{arrangement}} of layers does {{come with a}} small increase in error rate due to reduced reflectivity of the written layers, and a similar small risk of crosstalk interference. One of the techniques employed to help compensate for these reliability shortcomings is a 10% increase in minimum mark (digital 0 or 1) length on the disc, with a corresponding 10% increase in rotation speed and 10% reduction in gross recordable capacity, accounting for the lower capacity of a single-sided dual-layer DVD at 8.5 billion bytes, versus a double-sized, single-layer DVD at 9.4 billion (for 12 cm discs).
