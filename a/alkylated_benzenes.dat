The vapour absorption system is a single stage absorption consisting of evaporator, absorber, generator and condenser. The system is equipped with heat pipes installed between the absorber and the pre-generator to recover the heat of absorption. The heat applied to the generator replicated the solar thermal energy based on the climatic conditions of Jamaica using flat plate collectors commonly used in Jamaica. Experiments at various evaporator, absorber and generator temperatures showed that the coefficient of performance of the system increases with increasing the generator temperature and with decreasing the absorber temperatures.

The accessibility of SAPO- 34 is linked {{with the amount of}} methoxy species, whereas the formation of polyaromatic species that block the pores is the main cause of deactivation. Furthermore, the reaction pathways responsible for the formation of olefins and polyaromatics co-exist and compete during the whole MTO process, and both routes are directly related to the amount of surface poly <b>alkylated</b> <b>benzene</b> carbocations and methoxy species.

We hypothesised that the inflammatory subtype in mild and moderate COPD {{can be assessed}} by exhaled breath metabolomics. Exhaled compounds were analysed using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and electronic nose (eNose) in 28 COPD patients (12 / 16 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stage I/II, respectively). Differential cell counts, eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) were measured in induced sputum. Relationships between exhaled compounds, eNose breathprints and sputum inflammatory markers were analysed and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed. Exhaled compounds were highly associated with sputum cell counts (eight compounds with eosinophils, 17 with neutrophils; p < 0. 01). Only one compound (<b>alkylated</b> <b>benzene)</b> overlapped between eosinophilic and neutrophilic profiles. GC-MS and eNose breathprints were associated with markers of inflammatory activity in GOLD stage I (ECP: 19 compounds, p < 0. 01; eNose breathprint r = 0. 84, p = 0. 002) (MPO: four compounds, p < 0. 01; eNose r = 0. 72, p = 0. 008). ROC analysis for eNose showed high sensitivity and specificity for inflammatory activity in mild COPD (ECP: area under the curve (AUC) 1. 00; MPO: AUC 0. 96) but not for moderate COPD. Exhaled molecular profiles are closely associated with the type of inflammatory cell and their activation status in mild and moderate COPD.

This information has been used to unambiguously identify coal-derived PAHs in contaminated land sites. Aromatic hydrocarbons in a number of samples analysed from a former foundry site at Mansfield displayed variable compositions with those containing predominately <b>alkylated</b> <b>benzenes</b> and naphthalenes having carbon stable isotopic ratios in the range of − 28 to − 30 ‰, typical of transport fuels. The aliphatic hydrocarbon distributions confirmed the petroleum origin and indicated that the oil had also been biodegraded. Less negative (enriched in 13 C, − 25 to − 26 ‰) isotopic profiles were obtained for the fractions rich in 3 – 6 ring parent PAHs, indicating a significant input from coal utilisation. Separating the aromatic by ring size enabled the coal-derived 3 – 6 ring PAHs to be identified in samples where petroleum-derived <b>alkylated</b> <b>benzenes</b> and naphthalenes dominated. A similar situation to this with only a small input from coal-derived PAHs was found for a soil heavily contaminated with diesel fuel from the Motherwell area. Carbon stable isotopic data taken in conjunction with PAH distributions indicate that the coal tar contaminating an area of Glasgow Green, which was believed to be dumped during the Second World War and was unearthed recently, probably originated from a high temperature coking plant as opposed to a gas works, as indicated by the isotopic signatures of the distributions of PAHs...|$|E

Big Brown lignite was liquefied in a fixed bed tube reactor. Three solvents were used in the liquefaction studies, toluene, cyclohexane and methanol. Two co-solvents, tetralin and water were used with toluene. The effects of the solvents and co-solvents were investigated. Supercritical fluid is the fluid at the temperature and pressure above its critical values. Toluene was the main supercritical fluid used in this study. Tetralin and water as co-solvents can contribute hydrogen to stabilize the free radicals produced during liquefaction reaction. The total conversion of Big Brown lignite and yield of liquid were increased. Water is not as good as tetralin in producing hydrogen, but it can increase the polarity of the solvent, which increases the solvency of supercritical fluids. The liquid product was found to consist primarily of saturated hydrocarbons. It illustrated that the free radicals were saturated by hydrogen during liquefaction. Alkylated aromatics and furans are also common chemical species present in the liquid products. The aromatic species were predominantly <b>alkylated</b> phenols, <b>benzenes,</b> indenes, pyridines and naphthalenes. At the supercritical conditions of this study, temperature and flowrate of the solvent were not important to the conversion of Big Brown lignite and yield of liquid, since supercritical fluids have gas-like viscosities with very high solubilities. To get more liquid products, the main point is to produce more free radicals from coal, inhibit the recombination of these radicals, and prevent the decomposition of these radicals to gas. Tetralin and water are good co-solvents for coal hydroliquefaction. Further research on the mechanism of water as a co-solvent in coal hydroliquefaction was recommended...|$|R

These experiments indicated that the LMW alkylthiophenes usually encountered in the flash pyrolysates of sulphur-rich kerogens are also produced at much lower pyrolysis temperatures (i. e. as low as 150 ¡ãC) as the major (apart from hydrogen sulfide) sulphur-containing pyrolysis products.

In combination with the substantial production of LMW alkylthiophenes with a linear carbon skeleton at these conditions, this indicated that these thiophenes are predominantly formed by thermal degradation of multiple (poly) sulfide-bound linear C 5 ¨CC 7 skeletons, which probably mainly originate from sulphurisation of carbohydrates during early diagenesis.

40|$|The {{degradation}} {{of organic matter}} in peat bogs is complex and not yet well understood. Recent investigations of the trace gases CO 2 and CH 4 focussed {{on the impact of}} these greenhouse gases on global warming. However, there have to be metabolic intermediates between complex organic structures (i. e., humic acids) and gaseous end products (CH 4, CO 2, N 2, NOx and H 2 S) other than water-soluble substances (i. e., aromatic acids, amino acids, fatty acids). Deoxygenation during microbial decomposition of plant material also produces anoxic conditions that favor the formation of kinetically stable hydrocarbons. In this study, volatile organic substances (VOS) in peat bogs were investigated using two techniques: purge-and-trap and closed-loop stripping.

40|$|Following {{release to}} the environment, crude oil becomes subject to {{weathering}} processes which remove the simple, volatile hydrocarbons leaving an unresolved complex mixture (UCM) comprising the more environmentally persistent components. Aromatic UCMs {{have been reported}} {{in a wide variety of}} environmental matrices. Recent studies indicate such material, particularly monoaromatic hydrocarbons, is sufficiently bioavailable to marine organisms (e. g. mussels) to elicit toxicological responses. However, little else is known about the environmental fate and composition of petroleum-derived aromatic UCMs. The overall aim of this work was to investigate aromatic UCMs with particular emphasis on their biodegradability, water solubility and composition. To assess persistence in the environment, an 'aromatic' UCM was isolated from Tia Juana Pesado crude oil (Venezuela) and this UCM exposed to the hydrocarbon degrading bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens (Texaco). Five synthesised alkylcyclohexyltetralins and an alkylcyclohexylnaphthalene, proposed previously as 'average' structures for some aromatic UCM components, were also exposed under the same conditions. After 50 days, biodegradation of the compounds had not exceeded 20 %, the most resistant (- 2 % biodegradation) being those with C 3 -C 5 alkyl chains. These latter results were comparable to those observed for the 'aromatic' UCM (- 2 %). Using North Sea oil or n-hexadecane as co-substrates, the synthetic compounds were also exposed to a natural consortium of bacteria to provide more environmentally realistic conditions. After 119 days the branched chain C 5 homologue (- 60 %) and the naphthalene (- 12 %) still remained, yet under these severe conditions the components of the North Sea crude oil co-substrate were extensively degraded with even the highly bioresistant pentacyclic hopanes exhibiting biodegradation. Aqueous solutions of an 'aromatic' and 'monoaromatic' UCM were produced (at 25 'C) using a generator column technique. These 'solubilised' UCM fractions may represent UCM hydrocarbons which are bioavailable, and which are most toxic to aquatic organisms. An altered UCM was clearly evident in the aqueous phase extracts, suggesting that many of the compounds in the original aromatic and monoaromatic UCMs exhibited similar physicochemical properties and mole fractions. However, higher molecular weight hydrocarbons were absent from the generated 'solutions', indicating a solubility cut-off point based predominantly on molecular weight. The molecular weight distribution differed significantly for the 'solubilised' aromatic and monoaromatic UCMs, indicating that Raoult's Law may describe a critical control in the dissolution of complex mixtures. Comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography-time of flight-mass spectrometry (GCxGC-ToF-MS) analysis was used to provide vastly increased separation power and characterisation of a water 'soluble' monoaromatic UCM. Over 1200 compounds were separated by the chromatography, of which about 500 had distinct mass spectra from the ToF-MS analysis. A detailed characterisation of some of these monoaromatic UCM hydrocarbons via comparison to mass spectra registered in the NIST library permitted the identities of over 100 monoaromatic UCM components to be inferred. Compounds identified include novel <b>alkylated</b> homologues of <b>benzene,</b> indene, indan, tetralin, biphenyl, diphenylmethane and tetrahydrophenanthrene. This study has shown that a UCM appeared to be comprised of the geochernically minor isomers and analogues of known major crude oil constituents. This finding is extremely important given that the narcotic toxicity of petroleum hydrocarbons is additive. As UCMs often account for a large proportion of crude oil mass, these persistent residues may also contribute significantly to the observed narcotic toxicity of crude oil.

40|$|The {{interactions}} between neutral paramagnetic relaxation reagents (PARR's) and certain aromatic compounds {{have been studied}} by  1 H and 13 C spin-lattice relaxation time measurements. In media such as cyclohexane and carbon tetrachloride, Cr(acac) 3 becomes preferentially solvated by aromatic solutes. The solvation is significantly suppressed in a more interacting solvent like dichloromethane. Paramagnetic induced chemical shifts of the aromatic outer sphere ligand indicate in addition to relaxation data, a preferential orientation caused by dipole-dipole interactions. For benzene or for several <b>alkylated</b> <b>benzenes</b> which have small or no permanent dipole moments, the interaction is electrostatic, i. e. of a dipole-dipole induced type and where the easily polarizable aromatic ring is preferred in the solvation sphere. Carbon tetrachloride is shewn to have a specific PARR interaction. If co-ordination number, solution structure etc., are to be determined using weakly interacting substrates, this solvent should be avoided. A multivariate statistical approach is also reported, where  13 C electron-nuclear relaxation data and induced shifts of monosubstituted arcmatics have been related to different physical descriptors. Most {{of the variance in}} relaxation and shift data is best described by the dipole moment. The results support a dipole-dipole interaction as the preferred solvation mechanism. The preferential solvation of several organic substrates with the diamagnetic Co(acac) 3 is studied by varying the substrate concentration in cyclohexane. By the use of  59 Co shift, it is shown that proton donating solutes such as chloroform and methanol have a specific solvation.

Massresolved, resonant two-photon ionization (R 2 PI) was used to record the jet-cooled, vibronic spectra of specific CnH m species. Double-resonant holeburning techniques were used as a means to collect structural isomer and conformer specific spectra. The ultraviolet spectrum of a new C 10 H 8 isomer, 1 -phenyl- 1 -butyn- 3 -ene, has been recorded and compared with other C 10 H 8 isomers. Working off the hypothesis that <b>alkylated</b> <b>benzenes</b> may undergo ring closure to give fused ring species, conformationspecific spectroscopy of two radical recombination products, 4 -phenyl- 1 -butene (C 10 H 12) and benzylallene (C 10 H 10), have been recorded, the former being the product of benzyl and allyl radicals, the latter of benzyl and propargyl radicals. It was found that upon photo-excitation, benzylallene undergoes hydrogen loss and ring closure to form naphthalene. It has been postulated that resonance-stabilized radicals (RSRs) {{play an important role in}} the formation of fused ring systems, including the aforementioned benzylallene to naphthalene mechanism. To that end, the visible spectroscopy and ionization thresholds of 1 -phenylallyl (C 9 H 9) and benzylallenyl (C 10 H 9) were recorded.

Hydrogenated naphthalenes may play a role in forming larger fused ring systems leading to tholins.

40|$|To further a {{quantitative}} {{understanding of the}} effects of weathering on oil spilled at sea, a series of laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate the dissolution and photodegradation kinetics of Kuwait crude oil in seawater. A simple and practical method was developed for the preparation of stable homogeneous samples of sea water-soluble oil (SWSF) at 25 "C. The dissolution was monitored by two independent but complementary methods; total dissolved oil was measured by a photochemical dissolved organic carbon (DOC) technique whilst the dominant soluble constituents, aromatic hydrocarbons, were measured by ultraviolet-fluorescence (UVF) spectrophotometry. Maximum dissolution was observed after slowly stirring oil on seawater for 5 days when concentrations were, respectively, 3. 2 - 3. 6 fig C mL * seawater (DOC) and 2. 4 /xg diesel equivalents mL ' seawater (UVF). C^ntification of the photodegradation of individual SWSF constituents required development and optimisation of a more specific analytical method. The final method involved addition of deuterated internal standards, extraction with n-pentane, controlled evaporation (micro Kudema-Danish concentration) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Particular care was taken to eliminate sample contamination and storage conditions were also optimised. The recovery of deuterated internal standards through the isolation steps ranged from 30 % for benzene-d^ to 100 % for phenanihrene-diQ. The method allowed more than fifty compounds, mainly low molecular weight aromatic hydrocarbons, to be identified and quantified in the SWSF. <b>Alkylated</b> <b>benzenes</b> (Q ^ were the most abundant (98 % of the dissolved oil) followed by alkylated naphthalenes (C 0. 3) (= 2 %). The oil to seawater partition coefficient of individual hydrocarbons (K^^) showed that hydrocarbons of high aqueous solubility (e. g C 0. 2 alkylbenzenes) also possessed the lowest partition values, whereas compounds with high partition coefficients (e. g. alkylnaphthalenes) remained mainly in the oil phase. A reproducible method of simulating solar irradiation was established under controlled environmental conditions using a calibrated 1. 8 kW xenon lamp. The photodegradation of a model SWSF compound (phenanthrene) followed first-order kinetics (kp= 0. 317 + 0. 029) with a half life (tj^J of 2. 2 hr at 25 "^C when irradiated at 194 Wm'-. The extrapolation of to latitude 30 *'N (Florida summer sunlight) showed that phenantiirene would degrade in = 9 hr. Some photoproducts including fluorene, fluorenone, 2, 2 '-diformylbiphenyl, 2, 3 : 4, 5 -dibenzoxepin, 3, 4 -benzocoumarin, and 9, 10 - phenanthrenequinone were identified by GC-MS, although these accounted for only 11 % of the initial mass of phenanthrene. UVF and GC-MS methods for examining the photodegradation of phenanthrene were compared. The photochemical fate of the characterised SWSF was investigated using the optimised irradiation system. Benzene and C^s <b>alkylated</b> <b>benzenes</b> showed no evidence of photodegradation after periods of up to 48 hour under the lamp, however, some C 4 alkylbenzenes (jec-butylbenzene, 1, 2 - dimethylbenzene, 1, 2, 4, 5 - + 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetramethylbenzene and 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrametiiylbenzene) appeared to follow first-order kinetics with respect to irradiation time. The photodegradation rate constants (kp) of the alkylated benzene and alkylated naphthalene isomers were statistically different demonstrating that certain isomers will phoiodegrade faster tiian others under the same conditions. Half lives ranged from 11. 8 to 33. 6 hr at 25 ''C. The majority of naphthalene (i. e. C^^^) identified in the SWSF of Kuwait crude oil exhibited first-order photodegradation kinetics with differing rate constants. Half lives were: naphtiialene. 15. 7 hr; 1 -methyl and 2 -methyl naphthalene, 14. 9 and 12 hr, respectively; l-l- 2 -ethylnaphthalene, 15. 9; 1, 6 -dimethylnaphthalene, 10. 4 hr; 1, 3, 7 -and 1, 2, 4 -trimethylnaphthalene, 11. 95 and 12 hr, respectively. The low initial concentration of other naphthalene isomers did not allow for accurate photodegradation kinetics to be determined. Extrapolating the data to latitude 30 "N showed that die photodegradation ti;^ expected for tiie determined SWSF compounds were between 4. 2 to 7 days. This would make photodegradation an effective weathering process for the removal of spilled oil, particularly in high solar radiation environments. Plymouth Marine Laborator...|$|E

All possible structural isomers of the <b>alkylated</b> <b>benzenes</b> were determined, and, in some cases, absolute yields were calculated. Sulphur-rich (Type II-S) kerogens yield higher absolute amounts of alkylbenzenes in comparison to Type I, II, and III kerogens. The variations in internal distribution patterns of C 2 -C 4 alkylbenzenes were analyzed using multivariate analysis techniques (principal component analysis; PCA). Major variations in alkylbenzene distributions were due to an increased abundance of specific alkylbenzenes, which are related to specific precursor moieties in the macromolecular structure assuming that they are mainly formed via -cleavage. Alkylbenzenes possessing 'linear' carbon skeletons are enhanced in flash pyrolysates of Guttenberg and Estonian Kukersite kerogens (Type I) and are proposed {{to be derived from}} linear precursors which have undergone cyclization/aromatization. Relatively high amounts of 1, 2, 3, 4 - and 1, 2, 3, 5 -tetramethylbenzenes were found in flash pyrolysates of Womble and Duvernay kerogens (Type II) which are likely to be derived from macromolecularly bound diaromatic carotenoids. The relatively high abundance of 1, 2, 3 -trimethylbenzene and 1, 3 -/ 1, 4 -dimethylbenzene in pyrolysates of Monterey kerogens (Type II-S) is proposed to be indicative of the presence of bound nonaromatic carotenoids (e. g.,,-carotene) which have undergone aromatization and/or loss of methyl groups upon diagenesis. 1 -methyl- 4 -isopropylbenzene, which appears in relatively high amounts in flash pyrolysates of Walcott Chuar kerogen (Type II) and Catalan coals (Type III), is thought to be derived from a heteroatom-bound precursor. These results demonstrate that the structure of monoaromatic moieties in kerogen is biologically controlled. The internal distribution patterns of alkylbenzenes of flash pyrolysates of kerogens and asphaltenes show a marked resemblance, the latter showing a slight enhancement of alkylbenzenes with longer carbon skeletons. These observations support the idea that asphaltenes are structurally related to kerogen and that aromatic moieties in asphaltenes are bound by fewer intermolecular bridges...|$|E

New cyclic dendrimers based on cyclam as a core (L 1 -L 8) were synthesized and characterized via FTIR and NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and microanalysis. Subsequently the generation 1 cyclam-based dendrimers as well as the commercial generation 1 to generation 3 DAB-PPI dendrimers were functionalized with salicylaldimine and iminopyridyl moieties on the periphery to produce new ligands, DL 1 -DL 10. These modified dendritic ligands were subsequently complexed to Ni salts to obtain the metallodendrimer complexes, C 1 -C 8. The metallodendrimers were characterized by FTIR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, microanalysis, magnetic susceptibility measurements, UV-Vis spectroscopy and thermal gravimetrical analysis (TGA). The DAB G 1 -G 3 salicylaldimine ligands (DL 1 -DL 3) were subjected to computational studies and the optimized structures were obtained by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The effect of the increase in dendrimer generation on the structural arrangement of the dendrimer was also investigated. The following aspects were probed using molecular modeling: a) the possible coordination site for the Ni to the first generation dendrimer ligand, DL 1, and b) the optimized structure of the first generation salicylaldimine nickel complex, C 1. We subsequently evaluated catalysts, C 1 -C 7, in the vinyl polymerization of norbornene, using methylaluminoxane (MAO) as a co-catalyst. All the catalysts were found to be active for norbornene polymerization with the weight of the polymers obtained ranging from 5. 12 x 105 - 11. 17 x 106 g/mol. The DAB-based iminopyridyl catalysts (C 4 -C 6) exhibited higher activities than its analogous salicylaldimine catalysts (C 1 -C 3) under the same reaction conditions. Also, the cyclam-based salicylaldimine nickel catalyst (C 7) exhibited higher activities than the DAB-based salicylaldimine nickel catalyst, C 1. A negative dendritic effect was observed for the G 1 -G 3 DAB salicylaldimine catalysts since the optimum activity for the G 3 catalyst, C 3, was lower than that for the G 2 catalyst, C 2. These nickel complexes were also evaluated as ethylene oligomerization catalysts and were found to produce a range of ethylene oligomers (C 4 -C 18) as well as some longer chained oligomers, when employing EtAlCl 2 as a co-catalyst. We observed however that the free EtAlCl 2 mediates the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of the solvent, toluene, in the presence of the obtained ethylene oligomers to give uneven carbon number products, which are mixtures of <b>alkylated</b> <b>benzenes.</b> Our metallodendrimer catalysts also isomerized and in some cases dimerized 1 -pentene. In both ethylene oligomerization and 1 -pentene isomerization processes, the salicylaldimine catalysts exhibited higher activity towards olefin transformation than the iminopyridyl catalysts. The cyclam-cored dendrimer catalyst again showed the highest activity. From the results obtained thus far it can be concluded that these nickel metallodendrimers exhibit great potential as catalysts in the transformation of unsaturated hydrocarbons...|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{there has}} been {{increased}} concern about {{the potential impact of}} powerboating on freshwater ecosystems. In the case of Loch Lomond, such concern led to the commencement of a programme of boat counting surveys in 1989. In these surveys, it was found that maximum boat numbers are increasing in Loch Lomond. As a logical progression from these surveys, the present study examined the impact of powerboat chemical pollution on the water quality of Loch Lomond. In the first stage of this study, the scale of powerboat pollution was assessed. This was achieved by constructing a simple mathematical model to estimate the total annual discharge of hydrocarbons (HCs) from powerboat emissions into Loch Lomond. By using boat census data and published information about the emission rates of different types of powerboat engines, the total annual input for Loch Lomond was estimated at 25. 50 tonnes in 1989 and this input has greatly increased since then. This indicates that there is real potential for hydrocarbon (HC) pollution of Loch Lomond from powerboat operation. Most of the HC material discharged emanated from speedboats powered by outboard motors. To identify and quantify HC pollutant compounds entering water from outboard engines, Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis was performed on water subject to a controlled pollution discharge from an outboard motor. Altogether, 47 compounds were detected in this exhaust-polluted water (EPW), with most of these being volatile aromatic HCs, such as benzene and <b>alkylated</b> <b>benzenes.</b> Water samples were also taken from three sites in Loch Lomond on two occasions: once in winter, during negligible boat activity and once in summer, at a time of high powerboat activity. No HCs were detected in winter, but some volatile aromatic HC compounds were clearly detectable in summer. These compounds were the same as those most abundant in EPW and found in similar relative proportions. Further experiments in this study involved the analysis {{of a large number of}} water samples. To enable this, it was necessary to develop an appropriate new method for the analysis of powerboat exhaust pollutants, which are mostly aromatic HC. All aromatic HCs fluoresce and the new method involved fluorescence spectroscopy analysis, following sample purification by normal-phase column chromatography. This technique is non-destructive allowing subsequent confirmatory analysis by GC-MS. It was found that the new method was fast, precise, highly sensitive and specific to volatile aromatic HCs. The capability of measuring HCs in a large number of samples allowed previously unfeasible experiments investigating: 1) The geographical distribution of powerboat exhaust HCs in Loch Lomond. 2) The depth profile of powerboat exhaust pollutants in the top 1. 5 m of the water column. 3) Recovery of water quality, following peak weekend boat activity in summer. It was found that: 1) Volatile aromatic HCs from powerboat exhaust are detectable over much of Loch Lomond on days of heavy powerboat activity, with concentrations of up to 37 ug. l" occurring. 2) Pollutant HCs are found at depths of at least 1. 5 m, and are not confined to the surface microlayer (100 urn), The HC distribution with depth was mostly uniform in the field and this was confirmed in controlled experiments in a tank. 3) Recovery of water quality was difficult to demonstrate in the field, possibly as pollution incidents occur continually during summer. 4) HC concentration declined in controlled experiments, in which water was subjected by a controlled pollution discharge from an outboard motor. The time taken for the HC concentration to reach 50...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 61 - 76). Los Laureles - Goat Canyon is a subwatershed {{located within}} the Tijuana River Watershed is presented. This canyon measures 1191 hectares (4. 6 square miles), of which 90 percent is in Mexico, and the remainder {{is part of the}} Tijuana River National Estuary Research Reserve(TRNERR) in the U. S. In this canyon, as in most of the Mexican border region, the rapid human population growth has led to an unorganized urbanization established with squatter housing structures that lack potable water, sewage system, paved roads, and appropriate waste management. As a consequence, several opened solid waste dumpsites have been observed in the Mexican side of the canyon. These open dumpsites along with the lack of other public services are considered to contribute environmental contaminants that may affect human health and wildlife in the TRNERR. The objectives of this study were to (i) determine the presence and concentration of heavy metals in soil samples collected from Los Laureles/Goat Canyon, (ii) examine soil samples from Los Laureles/Goat Canyon using a non-targeted analysis to screen for the presence of organic pollutants including POPs, (iii) identify the possible sources of the soil contaminants in the canyon, (iv) obtain baseline data for future comparison with studies conducted on other contaminated soils, and (v) create a baseline data of the soil contaminants on the canyon that can be utilized in future research. This study utilized the X-Ray Fluorescence Spectrometry to screen for heavy metals in 24 composite soil samples. A comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC??GC/ToF-MS) was used to screen for the presence of organic contaminants using a non-targeted analysis 9 composite soil samples. As results, 16 metals were detected, but only arsenic and cadmium were found to be above the EPA recommended levels (apply for cleaned Superfund sites). The soil concentrations of Cd found in this study are similar to previous studies done on the TRNERR, indicating. that the metal concentrations in this area havenot changed since the year 1997. With respect to the organic pollutants, this study identified 168 organic compounds, but there was only some scientific literature information for the only 30 compounds. Some organic contaminants such as benzothiazole (BT) and its derivative compounds seem to originate from rubber materials of the tires disposed at this canyon. Few pesticide related compounds such as hydroxylated biphenyl and benzyl benzoate were also found. Butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), compound known by the state of California to have carcinogenic characteristics, and several phenolic compounds used as antioxidants were also detected in the screened soil samples. In addition, organic compounds that have may have endocrine disruptor characteristics such as octylphenols, galaxolide, musk ketone, bisphenol A (BPA), and triclosan (TCS), which are commonly used in household products were also detected in this study. Nonetheless, the origin of the majority of these compounds is unknown because they can come {{from a wide range of}} sources. For example, the several <b>alkylated</b> <b>benzenes</b> and PAHs found in this study might come from combustion or various forms of fuel. Only the parent PAHs, alkylated/partially saturated PAHs (semi-quantified), BPA, and TCS were quantified for this study. The PAHs concentrations were similar or lower than background concentrations around the world's soil, but the average concentration levels of BPA (209 ppb) and TCS (280 ppb) found in this canyon are noteworthy because they are higher or comparable to concentrations found in sewage sludge and soils amended with sewage sludge. This suggests that these contaminants may come from sewage due to the fact that the residents in this canyon lack a sewage system or a water treatment plant. Therefore, the concentration and verification of some of the organic compounds needs to be done, and further research measuring the concentrations and ecological effects of BPA, TCS, and other compounds related to municipal sewage in this canyon should be conducted...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} aimed the better {{understanding}} of the catabolism of monoaromatic hydrocarbons by fungi. This knowledge can be used to enhance the biodegradation of BTEX pollutants. Fungi with the capacity of using toluene as the sole source of carbon and energy were isolated by enriching environmental polluted soil and groundwater samples in solid state-like batches, air biofilters, and liquid cultures. Incubation conditions in the latter combined acidic pH and low water activity. The isolates were identified as Cladophialophora sp. (two strains), Exophiala sp., Leptodontium sp. and Pseudeurotium zonatum. The previously isolated toluene-growing fungus Cladosporium sphaerospermum was also included in the present study. The genera Cladophialophora, Exophiala (both anamorphs of Capronia), and Cladosporium are classified into the black yeast-like and allied fungi. Members in this group are characterized for being cosmopolitan saprobes and opportunistic human pathogens. Growth curves showed that fungi grew on toluene with biomass doubling times of about 2 to 3 days. Some of the strains also grew on ethylbenzene and styrene. Kinetics of toluene degradation by cell suspensions followed the Michaelis-Menten model. Depending upon strain, the apparent KmSIZE= 2 >for toluene oxidation ranged from 5 to 22 μM. The toxicity of toluene, measured as the IC 50 value, ranged from 2. 4 to 4. 7 mM. The metabolic pathway for the oxidation of toluene was studied in a variety of fungi by using fluorinated toluene analogSIZE= 2 >ues and by determining the formed metabolites by 19 F NMR. Oxidation was similar in all toluene-assimilating fungi in which the initial conversion took place at the alkyl group. Toluene was initially oxidized to benzyl alcohol and benzoate, which was further hydroxylated at the ring first to 4 -hydroxy-benzoate, and then to catecholic compounds. The latter served as substrates for the opening of the ring and further metabolism through the 3 -oxoadipate pathway. The lack of significant benzene biodegradation by these fungi might be related with the incapacity of performing the ring hydroxylation. Oxidation of toluene at the aromatic ring was demonstrated for the zygomycete Cunninghamella echinulata. However, conversion rates here were very low in comparison with the assimilative metabolism and it occurred only co-metabolically. The substrates interactions during the degradation of BTEX mixtures were studied with the isolate Cladophialophora sp. strain T 1. This fungus grew on a model water-soluble fraction of gasoline that contained all six BTEX components. Benzene was not metabolized but the <b>alkylated</b> <b>benzenes</b> (TEX) were degraded by a combination of assimilation and co-metabolism. Toluene and ethylbenzene were used as sources of carbon and energy whereas ortho - and meta -xylene were co-metabolized to phthalates as end-metabolites. Para- xylene was not degraded in complex BTEX mixtures but, in combination with toluene, it appeared to be mineralized. The metabolic profiles and the inhibitory nature of the substrate interactions indicated that TEX were degraded at the side-chain by the same monooxygenase enzyme. The growth of the strain T 1 was also studied in sterile and non-sterile soil microcosms contaminated with a mixture of BTEX and MTBE. Inoculation with the fungus increased the degradation rates in soil after long exposure to BTEX and a low soil pH. Comparison of the biodegradation rates measured in presence and absence of indigenous bacteria, and the fungal inoculum suggested that the main interaction between indigenous and inoculated BTEX-degrading microorganisms was commensalistic. Alkylbenzenes were all degraded by the fungus, but benzene degradation required the activity of the indigenous soil microflora. MTBE could not be biodegraded. The presence and identity of the fungal inoculum in soil was confirmed {{at the end of the}} experiments by PCR-TGGE analysis of SSU of fungal 18 S rDNA. Fungi utilizing aromatic hydrocarbons can advantageously be used for biodegradation of BTEX in air biofilters and in soil. Fungal biodegradation is similar in kinetic terms to that of bacteria and posses a higher tolerance to adverse environments. However, factors limiting the application of fungi concern the lack of benzene degradation and the potential pathogenicity to humans...|$|E
40|$|Experimental and kinetic {{modeling}} {{studies were}} carried out on the conversion a wood-oil obtained from high pressure liquefaction of aspen poplar wood to liquid hydrocarbon fuels and useful chemicals in a fixed bed micro-reactor using HZSM- 5 catalyst. Similar experiments were conducted using silicalite, H-mordenite, H-Y and amorphous silica-alumina catalysts. Preliminary vacuum distillation studies showed that the wood-oil was made up of volatile and non-volatile fractions. A maximum yield of 62 wt% volatiles at 200 °C, 172 Pa was obtained. The volatile fraction consisted of over 80 compounds. These compounds were comprised of acids, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, esters, ethers, furans, phenols and some hydrocarbons. The characteristics of the oil showed that it was unstable with time, i. e., its physical properties and chemical composition changed with time probably due to the reaction of free radicals or the oxidative coupling of some of the wood-oil components. However, when the oil was mixed with tetralin, the stability improved. Upgrading studies were first conducted over inert berl saddles in the presence and absence of steam (i. e. non-catalytic treatment/blank runs). Yields of hydrocarbons were between 16 and 25 wt% of the wood-oil. High residue fractions of between 32 to 56 wt% were obtained after processing. Some portions of wood-oil formed a carbonaceous material (char or coke) when exposed to the experimental temperatures. The chars (coke) fraction increased with temperature from 4. 7 to 12. 5 wt% when processing with steam and 8. 0 to 20. 4 wt% when processing without steam. Catalytic upgrading studies were first carried out using HZSM- 5 catalyst in the presence and absence of steam. The results showed that approximately 40 to 65 wt% of the oil could be converted to a hydrocarbon-rich product (i. e. desired organic liquid product (distillate). This contained about 45 to 70 wt% hydrocarbons with selectivities ranging between 0. 47 to 0. 88. This fraction was highly aromatic in nature and consisted mainly of benzene, toluene, xylene (BTX compounds) and other <b>alkylated</b> <b>benzenes</b> within the gasoline boiling point range. The yield and selectivities were strong functions of the process time and temperature. A comparison between the two processes, i. e. upgrading in the presence and absence of steam, showed that about 30 to 45 % reduction in coke formation and 5 to 18 wt% increase in organic distillate could be achieved when processing in the presence of steam. These changes were probably due to changes in the rates of cracking, deoxygenation, aromatization and polymerization reactions resulting from the competitive adsorption processes between steam and wood-oil molecules in addition to changes in contact time of molecules. However, the selectivity for hyqrocarbons decreased in the presence of steam. Yields of organic distillate fractions of between 72 to 93 wt% and hydrocarbon yields and selectivities of 44 to 51 wt% and 0. 93 to 1. 13, respectively, were obtained when wood-oil volatile fraction was upgraded over HZSM- 5 after separation from the non-volatile fraction by vacuum distillation. The spent HZSM- 5 catalyst could be easily regenerated and reused with little change in its performance. The yields and selectivities for hydrocarbons when upgrading with the other catalysts were between 9 and 22 wt%, and 0. 12 and 0. 29, respectively for silicalite, 16 and 28 wt%, and 0. 22 and 0. 28, respectively for H-mordenite, 15. 5 and 21 wt%, and 0. 17 and 0. 21, respectively for H-Y and S. 5 and 26. 2, and 0. 13 and 0. 36, resrectively for silica-alumina. Compared to HZSM- 5 (yield between 34 and 43 wt%, selectivity of 0. 66 to O. SS) these yields and selectivities were much lower. These experiments also showed that the pore size, acidity and shape selectivity of the catalyst influenced the distribution of hydrocarbons in terms of the carbon number. The yield and selectivity of H-mordenite and H-Y (large pore zeolites) were mostly for kerosene range hydrocarbons (C 9 to C 15) and for silicalite and HZSM- 5 (medium pore zeolites) for gasoline range hydrocarbons. The hydrocarbon fraction from amorphous silica-alumina did not show any defined distribution. The performance followed the order: HZSM- 5 > H-mordenite> H-Y> Silicalite, Silica-alumina. With the aid of model compound reactions involving acetic acid methyl ester, propanoic acid, 4 -methylcyclohexanol, methylcyclopentanone, 2 -methylcyclopentanone, methoxybenzene, ethoxybenzene, phenol, 2 -methoxy- 4 -(2 -propenyl) phenol, a synthetic and wood-oil volatile, two reaction pathways were proposed to explain the chemical steps through which the final products of upgrading were obtained. Also, reaction pathways were proposed for each chemical group. These experiments showed that the final products were formed probably through cracking, deoxygenation, olefin formation, oligomerization, hydrogen and hydride transfer, cyclization, isomerization, alkylation and polymerization reactions. Rate models were derived based upon the two reaction pathways and the power law rate model. The rates of formation of products followed the general order: Organic distillate> Hydrocarbons> Residue> Coke> Gas >Aqueous Fraction. Estimates of the values of the kinetic parameters showed that the rate constants ranged between 10 - 6 (aqueous fraction) and 1. 81 (volatile fraction), activation energies between 6. 7 - 76. 0 x 10 3 KJ/Kmol and reaction orders from 0. 7 (gas formation) to 2. 5 (residue formation). Two mathematical models were derived based on the integral reactor design equation and on the two reaction pathways. This was used to estimate the yield of products. The models predicted the experimental results fairly accurately. Model discrimination showed that the model based on coke and residue formation from both volatile and non­-volatile fractions of the wood-oil best predicted the experimental results. Hydrocarbon selectivity relations which were based on coke, residue and combined coke and residue as undesired products were also derived. Application of these relations showed that lower temperatures and concentrations were most appropriate for higher hydrocarbon selectivity. However, this was at the expense of higher conversions...|$|E
40|$|Brominated {{flame retardants}} (BFRs) are bromine-bearing {{hydrocarbons}} added or applied to materials {{to increase their}} fire resistance. As thermal treatment or recycling activities are common disposal methods for BFR-laden objects, {{it is essential to}} determine the precise decomposition chemistry of BFRs at elevated temperatures, and their transformation pathways into hazardous pollutants. Sunlight can trigger the photodecomposition of BFRs, either during the life cycle of treated objects, or when emitted to the environment after disposal. Therefore, knowledge of the geometric and electronic structures of BFRs is of chief importance when tracking their fate in the ambient environment. Although BFR decomposition mainly occurs in a condensed phase, gas phase reactions also contribute significantly to their overall decay and subsequent fragmentation into brominated pollutants. Thermal degradation of BFRs often proceeds in the presence of bromine atoms which inhibit complete combustion. Therefore, under thermal conditions such as smouldering, municipal waste incineration, pyrolysis, thermal recycling, uncontrolled burning and fires, BFRs degrade to form brominated products of incomplete combustion (BPICs). Thermal degradation of BFRs produces potent precursors to polybrominated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PBDD/Fs). Co-combustion of BFR-containing objects with a chlorine source (e. g., polyvinyl chlorides) results in the emission of significant concentrations of mixed halogenated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (i. e., PXDD/Fs; X = Br, Cl). In this thesis, we investigated the thermochemical parameters of bromochlorophenols (BCPhs) and the photodecomposition properties of major BFRs and their derived brominated phenols (BPhs). We scrutinised the formation of brominated and non-brominated products that evolved during the thermal decomposition of major BFR i. e., tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBA), through experimental measurements coupled with accurate quantum chemical calculations. We acquired thermo-kinetic parameters as well as mechanistic routes pertinent to the destruction of TBBA. We illustrated reaction networks for the synthesis of PXDD/Fs from BPhs and chlorinated phenols (CPhs). Similarly, we described pathways leading to the formation of PBDFs and polybrominated diphenylethers (PBDEs) from brominated benzenes (BBzs). We critically reviewed the literature on BFR thermal decomposition with specific foci on underlying mechanisms, decomposition products, the influence of the polymeric matrix, metallic content and operational conditions. As BCPhs are direct building blocks for the formation of PXDD/Fs, we computed the thermochemical parameters of their complete series. We calculated standard enthalpies of formation, entropies, heat capacities and bond dissociation enthalpies (BDHs) of O-H bonds for the complete series of BCPhs. Values of the acid dissociation constant (pKa) were estimated based on an accurate thermodynamic cycle incorporating solvation and protonation energies. Calculated values of BDHs of O-H bonds in BCPhs vary slightly with the change in degree and pattern of halogenation. Gibbs energies of solvation of BCPhs in water are highly exergonic, with their values increasing with the degree of halogen substitution. Values of pKa dictate that BCPhs characterised by high degrees of halogenation display stronger acidity and dissociate more easily in aqueous media (i. e., they are stronger acids than lower substituted phenols). Photolysis and photochemical decomposition are important channels for the degradation of halogenated organic pollutants in the environment. Therefore, we performed density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent density functional theory (TDFT) calculations in order to derive the photodecomposition properties of major deployed BFRs and congeners of BPhs in both gaseous and aqueous media. We clarified the effect of degree and pattern of bromination on the photodebromination of selected brominated aromatic compounds based on several molecular descriptors; namely, geometries of the ground (S 0) and electronically first excited (S 1) states, values of the HOMO-LUMO energy gap (EH-L) and atomic charges on bromine atoms (qBr). Molecules exhibit different geometries in the S 0 and S 1 states and C-Br bonds elongate upon S 0 → S 1 transitions. In agreement with the recent findings on PBDEs, we found that the photoreactivity of bromine atoms in investigated BFRs and BPhs followed the sequence of ortho > meta > para. The bromine atom connected to the ortho-position holds the highest positive atomic charge and, thus, experiences the greatest lengthening of C-Br bonds in the S 1 state, in both gaseous and an aqueous media, prompting their reductive debromination. Excitation energies decrease linearly with increasing numbers of bromine substituents, and congeners {{with a high degree of}} bromination photodecompose more readily than lower brominated isomers. Computed values of EH-L for major BFRs and their non-brominated molecules inferred that the number of bromine substituents and the nature of the structure (aromatic/non-aromatic) contributes significantly towards the photoreactivity of molecules. We conducted gas phase thermal decomposition of TBBA using a laboratory-scale tubular reactor. Our main focus was to identify pollutants arising in the temperature range of 673 – 1123 K following evaporation of TBBA in the gas phase. The identification and quantitation involved the use of a gas chromatograph – triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (GC-QQQMS) instrument, functioning in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) and total ion current (TIC) modes. Product analysis revealed that thermal decomposition of TBBA commenced at 723 K. The major decomposition products were HBr, di-tribrominated bisphenols, benzene, phenol, mono-tribrominated congeners of benzene and phenol, brominated and non-brominated <b>alkylated</b> <b>benzenes,</b> benzofuran, bromobenzofuran, dibenzofuran, bromine substituted polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), biphenyl and biphenylene. We observed that, most of the decomposition products evolved in trivial concentrations at a temperature of 773 K and peaked at around 923 – 973 K. Higher temperatures favour the generation of non-brominated products. In this chapter, we have performed quantum chemical calculations to derive the degradation pathways of TBBA and to illustrate routes for the formation of brominated and non-brominated species. We constructed formation mechanisms related to the emission of PBDD/Fs in systems involving BFRs. In particular, we investigated formation corridors of (i) PXDD/Fs from the coupling reactions of 2 -chlorophenoxy (2 -CPhxy) and 2 -bromophenoxy (2 -BPhxy) radicals, (ii) PBDFs and PBDEs synthesis from the condensation reaction of monobromobenzene (MBBz) and a 2 -BPhxy radical. The coupling reactions of 2 -BPhxy and 2 -CPhxy radicals produce keto-ether (through the additions of a phenoxy O at ortho C(H), C(Cl) and C(Br) sites) and diketo (at ortho positions to C–C bridges) structures. Keto-ethers act as direct intermediates for the formation of dioxin moieties such as dibenzo-p-dioxin (DD), 1 -monochlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (1 -MCDD), 1 -monobromodibenzo-p-dioxin (1 -MBDD), 1 -bromo- 6 -chlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (1 -B, 6 -CDD) and 1 -bromo- 9 -chlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (1 -B, 9 -CDD) molecules. Diketo adducts initiate the formation of furan species, i. e., 4 -monochlorodibenzofuran (4 -MCDF), 4 -monobromodibenzofuran (4 -MBDF) and 4 -bromo- 6 -chlorodibenzofuran (4 -B, 6 -CDF) compounds, through interconversion and rearrangement reactions. We found that, these mechanisms of formation, commencing from halogenated phenoxy radicals, are largely insensitive to patterns and degrees of halogenation on meta and para sites. It follows that, our developed mechanistic and kinetic factors of reactions involving 2 -BPhxy and 2 -CPhxy should also apply to higher halogenated phenoxy radicals. We explored the initial oxidative decomposition pathways of monobromobenzene (MBBz) in the generation of BPhxy radicals and examined the possible dimerisation reactions of MBBz and 2 -BPhxy. It was found that, the coupling of MBBz and 2 -BPhxy results in the generation of twelve pre-PBDF intermediates, of which four can also serve as building blocks for the synthesis of PBDEs. The resonance-stabilised structure of the o-BPhxy radical accumulates more spin density character on its phenoxy O atom (30. 9...|$|E
