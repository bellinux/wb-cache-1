5|$|In 2000, Baroni Urbani {{described}} a new Baltic fossil species, {{of which he}} named it Prionomyrmex janzeni. After examining specimens of the new species and Nothomyrmecia macrops, Baroni Urbani stated that the newly described species and Nothomyrmecia macrops {{belong to the same}} genus (Prionomyrmex), in which he synonymised Nothomyrmecia as a genus and treated the tribe Prionomyrmecini as a subfamily, known as Prionomyrmecinae. Prior to this, John S. Clark, the original author who described Nothomyrmecia, noted that the genus was similar in appearance to Prionomyrmex; both the heads and mandibles were identical, but the nodes were different. As the mandibles of Prionomyrmex are similar to that of Nothomyrmecia, this suggests that they are intermediate to each other. This classification was short-lived, as Nothomyrmecia was separated and treated as a valid genus from Prionomyrmex by Dlussky & Perfilieva in 2003, on the base of the fusion of an abdominal segment. Other studies published in the same year came to the same conclusions of Dlussky & Perfilieva, and the subfamily Prionomyrmecinae would later be treated as a tribe in Myrmeciinae. However, Baroni Urbani would treat the tribe as a subfamily again in both his 2005 and 2008 publications, suggesting additional evidence in favor of his former interpretation as opposed to that of Ward and Brady's arguments. In 2012, P. wappleri was described by Gennady M. Dlussky, based on a fossilised worker from the Late Oligocene, <b>Aquitanian</b> <b>stage.</b> This subsequent report that described new fossil myrmecines accepted the classification of Archibald et al. and Ward & Brady without comment on the views of Baroni Urbani.|$|E
500|$|P. wappleri was {{described}} in 2012 by Russian palaeoentomologist Gennady M. Dlussky of the Moscow State University, from a fossilised holotype worker found in Germany from the <b>Aquitanian</b> <b>stage</b> 29 to 30 million years ago. The specimen is currently housed in the Institut für Paläontologie at the University of Bonn, North Rhine-Westphalia. Dlussky coined the specific epithet [...] wappleri from the surname [...] "Wappler", as he named the ant after German palaeoentomologist Torsten Wappler. The estimated body length of P. wappleri is [...] long, and the head is 1.35 times longer than the total width of it. The eyes are small and oval shaped, located in {{the upper part of}} the head, which is four times as long as the eyes. The mandibles are nearly three-quarters the length of the head; P. wappleri differs from P. longiceps and P. janzeni due to the apex of the clypeal lobe being pointed instead of round, and the first segment of the flagellum is only half the length of the second segment. Before the discovery of P. wappleri, extinct Myrmeciinae ants were only found from Eocene deposits. This suggests that the subfamily was still present in Europe during the Late Oligocene.|$|E

50|$|The Early Miocene (also {{known as}} Lower Miocene) is a sub-epoch of the Miocene Epoch {{made up of}} two stages: the <b>Aquitanian</b> and Burdigalian <b>stages.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Chattian is, in the {{geologic}} timescale, {{the younger}} of two ages or upper of {{two stages of}} the Oligocene epoch/series. It spans the time between [...] The Chattian is preceded by the Rupelian and {{is followed by the}} <b>Aquitanian</b> (the lowest <b>stage</b> of the Miocene).|$|R
40|$|The Oligocene-Miocene Qom Formation was {{deposited}} in different thickness in the Central Iran, Urumiehh–Dokhtar magmatic arc and Sanandaj–Sirjan provinces in Iran. The Oligocene-Miocene Kahak {{section of the}} Qom Formation in the Urumiehh–Dokhtar magmatic arc has been studied, in order to biostratigraphic data of the large benthic foraminifera. In the Kahak section, the foraminifera assemblages of the Qom Formation consist of Nummulites fichteli, Nummulites vascus, Eulepidina dilitata, Nephrolepidina sp., Neprolepidina tournoueri, Eulepidina sp., Pseudolituonella reicheli, Miogypsina sp., Miogypsina irregularis, Amphistegina sp., Operculina sp., Bozorginella qumiensis, Triloculina trigonula, Triloculina tricarinata, Peneroplis sp., Peneroplis thomasi, Dendritina ranji, Triloculina trigonula, Rotalia sp., Pyrgo sp., Elphidium sp., Borelis melo and Borelis curdica.  In the Kahak section of the Qom Formation, four assemblage biozones of the large benthic foraminifera have been recognized from Rupelian, Chattian, <b>Aquitanian</b> and Burdigalian <b>stages.</b> These biozones are similar to assemblage biozones of the Oligocene-Miocene Asmari Formation in the Zagros Basin in southwest of Iran. Distribution type of the Oligocene-Miocene foraminifera in the Kahak depositions of the Qom Formation indicates to depositional settings of the  lagoon, open lagoon and shallow open marine paleoenvironments. There is some similarity of foraminifera assemblage in Qom Formation sediments with other locality of Tethys including Mediterranean and Indo-West Pacific...|$|R
50|$|The <b>Aquitanian</b> <b>stage</b> {{was named}} after the region Aquitaine in France and was {{introduced}} in scientific literature by Swiss stratigrapher Karl Mayer-Eymar in 1858.|$|E

5000|$|Among {{his various}} {{geological}} studies was {{analysis of the}} Cretaceous and Tertiary in the Cotentin Peninsula (mid-1870s).

50|$|The {{base of the}} Aquitanian (also {{the base}} of the Miocene series and the Neogene system) is defined as the place in the stratigraphic column at the first {{appearance}} of foram species Paragloborotalia kugleri, the extinction of calcareous nannoplankton species Reticulofenestra bisecta (which forms the base of nannoplankton biozone NN1), and the base of magnetic chronozone C6Cn.2n.
