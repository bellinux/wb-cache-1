II, After the first fermentation, the dough was frozen. III, After second fermentation, the dough was frozen. For the defrosting of each frozen dough, quick and natural methods were compaired and resulted condition of the dough and the quality of final product were compaired by the physiological methods and by the eye observation. (1). Freezing storage of dough before fermentation; By quick defrosting of dough fermentationame weak, expansion of volume were not enough and somewhat sticky and indicate <b>alcoholic</b> <b>flavour</b> and quality become inferiar. On the other hand, one which was defrostted by natural temperature expansion the dough show satisfactory, soft and well. During storage period fermentation of yeast in the dough could be maintained quite normally. The bread made from the dough was good flavoured and elasticity. By this way obtained quite good result and almost similar to the bread made of general method. The dough was good flavoured and elasticity. By this way, obtained quite good result and almost similar to the bread made of general method. (2). Freezing dough after first fermentation; By quick defrosting of this section, fermentation of the dough were rather weak, Co_ 2 gas generate not enough, inner part of dough became a dumpling. The product shows low expansion. As the result, a strange smell appeared and it was difficult to make bread in this way. In natural defrosting, very weak fermentation could be seen, and became a dumpling. The product has strange smell and slightly sticky and heavy. Volume expansion also weak and the quality of product by this method was quite low. (3). The dough freezed after second fermentation. By quick defrosting, the dough lost elasticity and more inferior as compaired to quick defrosting of (2) section, therefore bread making by this method was almost impossible to use generally.

30|$|Flavour {{compounds}} have a {{wide range}} of applications in food, beverage, cosmetic and pharmaceutical fields (Noguerol-Pato et al. 2012; Cheong et al. 2013; Descours et al. 2013; Madruga et al. 2013; Zamzuri and Abd-Aziz, 2013). In the global consumer-driven market, one of the challenges for manufacturers is to create products faster and cheaper while continuing to offer consumers a recognizable ‘sensory experience’. Where {{it is not possible to}} manipulate process parameters directly, this can be achieved by inducing or supplementing products with specific aromatic or flavour compounds. Indeed, manufacture of some beverages such as FAB’s (<b>Flavoured</b> <b>Alcoholic</b> Beverages) (Mosher and Johnsson 2005) involves the addition of the flavours to an alcohol base. Typically such compounds are obtained by extraction from natural resources or by chemical synthesis. Natural extraction often requires expensive process coupled with aggressive conditions while chemical synthesis is simpler and cheaper, but the products cannot be accepted as ‘natural’ (Arcos et al. 1998; Adachi and Kobayashi 2005). One development was the introduction of enzymatic and whole-cell biocatalysis. The enzymes isolated from organisms provide several benefits, such as simpler reaction apparatus, higher productivity owing to higher catalyst concentration, and simpler product purification. However, an enzyme-based catalysis always relies on enzyme reaction kinetics and enzyme stability in aqueous solutions. In addition, only enzymes that were abundantly produced by cells could be used in industrial applications.|$|R

40|$|Aims To {{evaluate}} {{the impact of}} the 2011 Scottish ban on multi-buy promotions of alcohol in retail stores. Design and setting Difference-in-differences analysis was used to estimate {{the impact of the}} ban on the volume of alcohol purchased by Scottish households, compared with those in England and Wales, between January 2010 and June 2012. Participants A total of 22, 356 households in Scotland, England, and Wales. Measurements Records of alcohol purchasing from each of four categories (beer & cider, wine, spirits, and <b>flavoured</b> <b>alcoholic</b> beverages), as well as total volume of pure alcohol purchased. Findings Controlling for general time trends and household heterogeneity, there was no significant effect of the multi-buy ban in Scotland on volume of alcohol purchased either for the whole population or for individual socio-economic groups. There was also no significant effect on those who were large pre-ban purchasers of alcohol. Most multi-buys were for beer and cider or for wine. The frequency of shopping trips involving beer and cider purchases increased by 9. 2 % following the ban (p< 0. 01), while the number of products purchased on each trip decreased by 8. 1 % (p< 0. 01). For wine, however, these effects were not significant. Conclusions Banning multi-buy promotions for alcohol in Scotland did not reduce alcohol purchasing in the short term. Wider regulation of price promotion and price may be needed to achieve this...|$|R
40|$|Benzodiazepines are {{detected}} {{in a significant}} number of drug facilitated sexual assaults (DFSA). Whilst blood and urine from the victim are routinely analysed, due to the delay in reporting DFSA cases and the short half lives of most of these drugs in blood and urine, drug detection in such samples is problematic. Consideration of the drinks involved and analysis for drugs may start to address this. Here we have reconstructed the ‘spiking’ of three benzodiazepines (diazepam, flunitrazepam and temazepam) into five drinks, an alcopop (<b>flavoured</b> <b>alcoholic</b> drink), a beer, a white wine, a spirit, and a fruit based non-alcoholic drink (J 2 O) chosen as representative of those drinks commonly used by women in 16 – 24 year old age group. Using a validated GC-MS method for the simultaneous detection of these drugs in the drinks we have studied the storage stability of the benzodiazepines under two different storage conditions, uncontrolled room temperature and refrigerator (4 °C) over a 25 day period. All drugs could be {{detected in}} all beverages over this time period. Diazepam was found to be stable in all of the beverages, except the J 2 O, under both storage conditions. Flunitrazepam and temazepam were found not to be stable but were detectable (97 % loss of temazepam and 39 % loss of flunitrazepam from J 2 O). The recommendations from this study are {{that there should be a}} policy change and that drinks thought to be involved in DFSA cases should be collected and analysed wherever possible to support other evidence types...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Alcohol misuse {{among young}} people is a global phenomenon. In many countries, young people engage in heavy {{drinking}} and this exacerbates risky sexual behaviour. In Nigeria, alcohol held multiple roles in the traditional era but was mainly consumed by adult males for pleasure. Adult females and young people were culturally constrained from drinking in most communities. In contemporary Nigeria, young people’s drinking is increasing, and many engage in sexual intercourse {{under the influence of}} alcohol. Methods This study draws on the traditional gender and social sexual scripts to explore the factors that motivate young people to use alcohol for sexual purposes. In-depth interviews were conducted with 19 to 23 -year old male and female undergraduate students from a Nigerian university. Thematic analysis was conducted with the aid of NVivo 10 software. Results Men drink to become confident to initiate sexual relationships, stimulate sexual urges, prolong erection, increase sexual satisfaction and become more aggressive during sexual intercourse. Women also drink to be bold in initiating sexual relationships, for sexual arousal and to increase satisfaction. Relatedly, not every brand of alcohol is used for sexual purposes. For example, while men use ‘herbal’ alcoholic beverages and a mixture of locally-produced gin and marijuana, women use champagne and other <b>flavoured</b> <b>alcoholic</b> beverages. The results also revealed that young people use alcohol or salt in a bid to prevent conception after sexual intercourse. Conclusions Adherence to the traditional gender (masculinity) and social sexual scripts amongst men and the enactment of {{what appears to be a}} new form of femininity script amongst women contribute to a culturally specific understanding of the motivations to use alcohol for sexual purposes. Evidence-based strategies should be employed to distribute information about the consequences of sexual intercourse under the influence of alcohol...|$|R
40|$|Retailers, Wholesalers, Marketers, Alcohol {{distributors}} and Manufacturers continuously {{fight for}} volume growth and market-share gain within the total alcohol market. Most {{of the answers}} of how much each can gain {{over a period of}} time remain a mystery that can only be answered by the consumers. The consumers determine who will have more share of wallet or share of throat more than the other. This is also equally applicable to brands, packs and the various alcohol categories that exist in the market. Why is it important, you possibly wonder? It is important because the alcohol market is an integrated part of our society; it contributes immensely to the South African economy and its value chain is enormous in value. Consumption expenditure increased from R 3 513 039 000 in 2004 to R 8 558 232 000 by 2013 in the Eastern Cape alone. In the last 10 years there has been an increase of new products that are being introduced into the market across all categories ranging from traditional <b>alcoholic</b> brands to <b>flavoured</b> and ready to drink brands. This presents an opportunity to alcohol consumers, alcohol shoppers and sellers alike. This opportunity meant that the consumer is spoilt for choice and retailers / wholesalers have an opportunity to list more brands which could possibly result in increased margins. Further to the above, South African marketers face both market challenges as well as proposed legislation regarding advertising of alcohol products. Some of the challenges include marketing clutter, competition, diverse nature of the South African consumer, infrastructure issues, government legislations, social media and digital platforms. The liquor industry of the Eastern Cape contributes approximately R 7, 7 billion to the Gross Geographic Product of the economy of the Eastern Cape through direct and indirect impacts; Approximately 23 620 permanent jobs are supported by the Eastern Cape liquor industry annually; Tax revenue attributable to the liquor industry in the Eastern Cape is R 3, 9 billion; and the economic impact of the liquor industry on gross capital formation is in the region R 3, 4 billion per annum. The purpose of this research is to optimise the marketing mix to influence consumer purchasing decisions in liquor outlets within the Border district within the above context. The objective of this study is to identify the marketing mix that influences consumer purchasing decisions in liquor outlets. The study will be conducted within the Border district. The Border district consists of various geographies within the Eastern Cape, South Africa. The area of the study will focus on key municipalities namely; Buffalo city, Amathole, Chris Hani and Joe Gqabi municipalities. The target sample size for this study was 360 consumers. A survey questionnaire was used to measure respondents’ preferences, attitudes, motivations and perceptions. The respondents were instructed to highlight the answer that best described them and / or their preferences. Questions were asked and the respondents had to highlight to what extent they agreed or disagreed with the question. Key findings are that there is high level of agreement that price and promotions influence consumer-purchasing decision in liquor outlets. The highest percentage of respondents are in agreement that beer is a first choice of drink and a second is spirits. 69 % of the respondents agree that they change from the usual drink to a different drink when they go out. This can be attributed to the notion that consumers like to badge and want to be seen drinking brands that will be deemed socially acceptable in public, or brands that are the latest trend. The key benefits from the study include improved ability for marketers to reposition brands, give clear recommendations for drinking occasions and better understanding on how to efficiently distribute alcohol portfolios, extend brands and introduce limited editions...|$|R
