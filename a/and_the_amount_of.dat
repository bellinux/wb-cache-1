40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} keep the steel with {{outstanding}} antibacterial characteristics, the relationship between <b>the</b> anneal temperatures <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> precipitated Cu-rich phase was investigated in this work. The SEM analysis of annealing specimens indicated that the microstructure changed with the increase of annealing temperature. At 900 °C, the martensite phase appeared along the crystal boundary, but <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> Cu-rich phase was almost no change. At 920 °C, the sizes of the Cu-rich precipitates minished <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> precipitates reduced gradually. At 940 °C, there was only martensite phase existing in the ferrite matrix. Therefore, the optimal final annealing temperature range was chosen from 880 °C to 900 °C to ensure attaining excellent antibacterial properties and favorable mechanical characteristic of copper-bearing stainless steel...|$|R
5|$|Beginning in 1973, several {{spacecraft}} {{have performed}} planetary flyby maneuvers {{that brought them}} within observation range of Jupiter. The Pioneer missions obtained the first close-up images of Jupiter's atmosphere and several of its moons. They discovered that the radiation fields near the planet were much stronger than expected, but both spacecraft managed to survive in that environment. The trajectories of these spacecraft were used to refine the mass estimates of the Jovian system. Radio occultations by the planet resulted in better measurements of Jupiter's diameter <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> polar flattening.|$|E

5|$|Enzyme rates {{depend on}} {{solution}} conditions and substrate concentration. To find {{the maximum speed}} of an enzymatic reaction, the substrate concentration is increased until a constant rate of product formation is seen.

Saturation happens because, as substrate concentration increases, {{more and more of the}} free enzyme is converted into the substrate-bound ES complex. At the maximum reaction rate (Vmax) of the enzyme, all the enzyme active sites are bound to substrate, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> ES complex is the same as the total amount of enzyme.|$|E
