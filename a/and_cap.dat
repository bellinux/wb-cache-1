5|$|Although the {{relatively}} large fruiting bodies of R.pulcherrimus are distinctive, {{they might be}} confused with superficially similar species, such as Rubroboletus eastwoodiae; the latter species has a much thicker stalk. Another similar species is R.haematinus, which may be distinguished by its yellower stem <b>and</b> <b>cap</b> colors that are various shades of brown. Its darker cap and lack of reticulation on the stipe differentiate it from R. satanas.|$|E

5|$|Hurt by {{losses to}} the Akron Pros and Buffalo All-Americans, the Bulldogs did not contend for the APFA trophy in 1920.

Sportswriter Bruce Copeland compiled the All-Pro list for the 1920 season, naming the Bulldogs' Wilbur Henry to the first team.

5|$|Mature {{specimens}} of Battarrea phalloides roughly resemble the typical agaric mushroom stature of stem <b>and</b> <b>cap.</b> However, {{rather than a}} cap with gills, this species has a spore sac atop the stem. When young, the fruit body is roughly spherical and completely encased in an outer wall (exoperidium) that later splits in a circumscissile fashion (along a circular or equatorial line), the lower wall forming a volva and the upper part forming scales that cover the inner wall. The upper part rolls upward and backward and eventually falls away in one piece, exposing a spore sac lined with a narrow ring of capillitium and spores. The spores are sticky. As these are carried away by the wind, the drying action of the latter cause {{the edges of the}} peridium to shrivel and roll up more, exposing more spores. This is continued until the upper half of the peridium has shriveled and blown away and there remains only a few spores, which may be washed away by rain.|$|E

5|$|Panellus stipticus is one {{of several}} dozen species of fungi that are bioluminescent. Strains from eastern North America are {{typically}} bioluminescent, but those from the Pacific coast regions of North America and from other continents are not. The luminescence is localized to the edges of the gills and the junction of the gills with the stem <b>and</b> <b>cap.</b> Bioluminescence is also observable with mycelia grown in laboratory culture, and the growth conditions for optimal light production have been studied in detail. Several chemicals have been isolated and characterized that are believed to be responsible for light production. Genetic analysis has shown that luminescence is controlled by a single dominant allele. The luminescent glow of this and other fungi inspired the term foxfire, coined by early settlers in eastern and southern North America. Modern research has probed the potential of P.stipticus as a tool in bioremediation, because of its ability to detoxify various environmental pollutants.|$|E
5|$|Rhodotus is a genus in {{the fungus}} family Physalacriaceae. It is a {{monotypic}} genus {{and consists of}} the single mushroom species Rhodotus palmatus, known in the vernacular as the netted rhodotus, the rosy veincap, or the wrinkled peach. This uncommon species has a circumboreal distribution, and has been collected in eastern North America, northern Africa, Europe, and Asia; declining populations in Europe have led to its appearance in {{over half of the}} European fungal Red Lists of threatened species. Typically found growing on the stumps and logs of rotting hardwoods, mature specimens may usually be identified by the pinkish color and the distinctive ridged and veined surface of their rubbery caps; variations in the color and quantity of light received during development lead to variations in the size, shape, <b>and</b> <b>cap</b> color of fruit bodies.|$|E
5|$|Tricholoma pardinum {{mushrooms}} may {{be confused}} with several edible grey-capped members of the genus Tricholoma, and some authorities recommend leaving all grey-capped Tricholoma mushrooms for experienced hunters. There are several superficially similar European species that could be mistaken for T.pardinum. The smaller T.terreum lacks a mealy smell <b>and</b> <b>cap</b> scales, is darker coloured and less robust, and has smaller spores measuring 5–7.5 by 4–5μm. The edible T.argyraceum somewhat resembles T.pardinum—but with finer scales, and gills and bruised parts that yellow with age. Unlike the preferentially montane T.pardinum, these lookalikes tend to fruit at lower elevations. T.atrosquamosum is smaller and darker than T.pardinum, and has a peppery aroma. T.orirubens has fine dark scales and pinkish gills, brittle flesh, and is generally smaller. T.myomyces is smaller than T.pardinum, has a thin, fibrous partial veil on young specimens, and elliptical spores measuring 5–6 by 3.5–4μm. The edible and highly regarded T.portentosum is of a similar size, though has a uniform grey cap that is never scaled.|$|E

5|$|Studies of {{the ecology}} and {{genetics}} of Paxillus involutus {{indicate that it}} may form a complex of multiple similar-looking species. In a field study near Uppsala, Sweden, conducted from 1981 to 1983, mycologist Nils Fries {{found that there were}} three populations of P.involutus unable to breed with each other. One was found under conifers and mixed woodlands, while the other two were found in parklands, associated with nearby birch trees. He found that the first group tended to produce single isolated fruit bodies which had a thinner stipe <b>and</b> <b>cap</b> which was less inrolled at the margins, while the fruit bodies of the other two populations tended to appear in groups, and have thicker stipes, and caps with more inrolled and sometimes undulating margins. However, there were only general tendencies and he was unable to detect any consistent macroscopic or microscopic features that firmly differentiate them. A molecular study comparing the DNA sequences of specimens of Paxillus involutus collected from various habitats in Bavaria found that those collected from parks and gardens showed a close relationship with the North American species P.vernalis, while those from forests were allied with P.filamentosus. The authors suggested the park populations may have been introduced from North America. A multi-gene analysis of European isolates showed that P.involutus sensu lato (in the loose sense) could be separated into four distinct, genetically isolated lineages corresponding to P.obscurosporus, P.involutus sensu stricto (in the strict sense), P.validus, and a fourth species that has not yet been identified. Changes in host range have occurred frequently and independently among strains within this species complex.|$|E
