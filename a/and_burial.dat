5|$|A {{clash between}} local Torajan {{leaders and the}} South Sulawesi provincial {{government}} (as a tourist developer) broke out in 1985. The government designated 18 Toraja villages <b>and</b> <b>burial</b> sites as traditional tourist attractions. Consequently, zoning restrictions were applied to these areas, such that Torajans themselves were barred from changing their tongkonans <b>and</b> <b>burial</b> sites. The plan was opposed by some Torajan leaders, as they felt that their rituals and traditions were being determined by outsiders. As a result, in 1987, the Torajan village of Kété Kesú and several other designated tourist attractions closed their doors to tourists. This closure lasted only a few days, as the villagers found it too difficult to survive without the income from selling souvenirs.|$|E
5|$|The area {{may have}} been settled during the Mesolithic period: locally {{manufactured}} flints of the Horsham Culture type {{have been found to}} the southwest of the town. Tools <b>and</b> <b>burial</b> mounds from the Neolithic period, <b>and</b> <b>burial</b> mounds and a sword from the Bronze Age, have also been discovered. Crawley is on {{the western edge of the}} High Weald, which produced iron for more than 2,000years from the Iron Age onwards. Goffs Park—now a recreational area in the south of the town—was the site of two late Iron Age furnaces. Ironworking and mineral extraction continued throughout Roman times, particularly in the Broadfield area where many furnaces were built.|$|E
5|$|Early {{religious}} services {{were held in}} the log church on land deeded to Reformed trustee Jacob Huber and Lutheran trustee John Nicholas Schweitzer, {{both of whom were}} church elders in 1786. The deed conveying the land to the trustees specified that it was to be used for a German church <b>and</b> <b>burial</b> yard. The united congregation became Hebron Church, the first Lutheran church west of the Shenandoah Valley.|$|E

Both animal and human sacrifices {{have been found}} in Liao tombs, alongside indications of Buddhist practice. Indications of Daoist, zodiac, and Zoroastrian influences have also been found in Liao burial sites.|$|E
5|$|Oakwood {{is home to}} 24 mausolea <b>and</b> <b>burial</b> vaults exhibiting a {{wide range}} of {{architectural}} styles including Greek Revival, Egyptian Revival, Roman Revival, Gothic Revival, Romanesque, and Palladian.

5|$|On 12 August 1812, Murrell married Elizabeth Francis Button at St. Olave's Church, Bermondsey in Southwark. Button {{was also}} from Essex, having been baptised in Hadleigh on 5 December 1790.

5|$|Pulaski {{has been}} {{remembered as a}} hero who fought for {{independence}} and freedom both in Poland and in the United States. Numerous places and events are named in his honor, and he is commemorated by many works of art. Pulaski {{is one of only}} eight people to be awarded honorary United States citizenship. He never married and had no descendants. Despite his fame, there have been uncertainties and controversies surrounding both his place and date of birth <b>and</b> <b>burial.</b>|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} of Roman remains in particular a villa <b>and</b> <b>burial</b> pits. Artefacts from the valley {{were sent to the}} British Museum. Other Roman artefacts from the lake are on display at the Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery. There are historic parks and mansion houses, including Stanton Drew, Hunstrete, Stowey House, Chew Court, Chew Magna Manor House and Sutton Court. Almost all of the villages have churches dating back to the fifteenth or sixteenth century.|$|E
5|$|A {{part of the}} South Downs, Willingdon Down is a {{designated}} Site of Special Scientific Interest. This is of archaeological interest due to a Neolithic camp <b>and</b> <b>burial</b> grounds. The area is also a nationally uncommon tract of chalk grassland rich in species. Another SSSI which partially falls with the Eastbourne district is Seaford to Beachy Head. This site, of biological and geological interest, covers the coastline between Eastbourne and Seaford, plus the Seven Sisters country park and the Cuckmere valley. Several nature trails lead across the Downs to {{areas such as the}} nearby villages of East Dean and Birling Gap, and landmarks like the Seven Sisters, Belle Tout lighthouse and Beachy Head.|$|E

5|$|After being enslaved for 12 years, Northup is {{restored}} to freedom {{and returned to}} his family, leaving behind the other slaves. As he walks into his home, he sees his wife with their son and daughter (fully grown) and her husband, who present him with his grandson and namesake, Solomon Northup Staunton. Solomon apologizes for his long absence while his family comforts him. The film's epilogue displays a series of graphics recounting Northup's unsuccessful suits against Brown, Hamilton and Burch, along with the 1853 publication of Northup's slave narrative memoir, Twelve Years a Slave. The memoir describes his role in the abolitionist movement, and the mystery surrounding details of his death <b>and</b> <b>burial.</b> Patsey and Solomon never met again.|$|E
5|$|Green Lake formed {{initially}} as {{a northern}} inlet of San Antonio Bay. As the Guadalupe River shifted westward about 2,500 years ago, it deposited silt, developing a delta that prograded into San Antonio Bay. Around 2,200years ago the delta discharge extended completely across the bay, severing the northern extension from the system, which formed present-day Green Lake. Pottery <b>and</b> <b>burial</b> grounds {{found in the}} area suggest a presence of Karankawa Indians {{at the time of}} formation. Middens uncovered north of the lake contained shells from the brackish water-species of rangia clams (rangia cuneata).|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the kingdoms of Northumbria, Mercia and Wessex, little reliable evidence about {{the kingdom of the}} East Angles has survived, because of the destruction of its monasteries and the disappearance of the two East Anglian sees that occurred as the result of Viking raids and settlement. The main primary sources for information about Anna's life and reign are the Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum (Ecclesiastical History of the English People), completed in Northumbria by Bede in 731, and the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, initially written in the ninth century, which mentions Anna's death. The mediaeval work known as the Liber Eliensis, written in Ely in the twelfth century, is a source of information about Anna's daughters Æthelthryth and Seaxburh, and also describes Anna's death <b>and</b> <b>burial.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} registers are in six books: (i) all {{entries from}} 1558 to 1709; (ii) baptisms <b>and</b> <b>burials</b> from 1710 to 1792 and marriages from 1710 to 1753;(iii) baptisms <b>and</b> <b>burials</b> from 1793 to 1812; (iv)(v) and (vi) marriages from 1754 to 1788, 1788 to 1804, and 1804 to 1812, respectively.

5|$|In total 283 magical spells, {{also known}} as utterances, were carved and the signs painted blue {{on the walls of}} the corridor, antechamber, <b>and</b> <b>burial</b> chamber of Unas' pyramid. They {{constitute}} the most complete rendition of the Pyramid Texts existing today. These spells were intended to help the king in overcoming hostile forces and powers in the Underworld and thus join with the sun god Ra, his divine father in the afterlife. By writing the texts {{on the walls of the}} pyramid internal chambers, the architects of Unas' pyramid ensured that the king would benefit from their potency even if the funerary cult was to cease.|$|E
5|$|Kinship was agnatic, with descent counted {{only through}} the male line, helping to build the {{importance}} of surnames and clans. The increased {{power of the state}} and economic change eroded the power of these organisations, and this process would accelerate as the government responded to the threat of Jacobite risings by undermining the power of clan chiefs in the eighteenth century. The Reformation had a major impact on family life, changing the nature of baptism, marriage and burials, leading to a change in wider relationships, sacramental status <b>and</b> <b>burial</b> practices and placing a greater emphasis {{on the role of the}} father.|$|E
5|$|Part of {{the grounds}} were donated to the local parish after Beckford's death and consecrated as a {{cemetery}} in 1848. It became known as Lansdown Cemetery <b>and</b> <b>burial</b> plots were {{laid out in a}} grid pattern. It was extended in 1947 and again in 1961. In addition to Beckford's tomb, the cemetery is also the burial site for several notable people from Bath including: Henry Goodridge, Field Marshall William Rowan, the Holburne family who founded the Holburne Museum, Anne (the wife of Sir Richard Bickerton, 2nd Baronet) and the feminist writer Sarah Grand.|$|E

5|$|Postman's Park {{opened in}} 1880 {{on the site}} of the former churchyard <b>and</b> <b>burial</b> ground of St Botolph's Aldersgate church and {{expanded}} over the next 20years to incorporate the adjacent burial grounds of Christ Church Greyfriars and St Leonard, Foster Lane, together with the site of housing demolished during the widening of Little Britain in 1880; the ownership of the last location became the subject of a lengthy dispute between the church authorities, the General Post Office, the Treasury, and the City Parochial Foundation. A shortage of space for burials in London meant that corpses were often laid on the ground and covered over with soil, thus elevating the park above the streets which surround it.|$|E
5|$|Riley's poetry {{had become}} popular in Britain, {{in large part}} due to his book Old-Fashioned Roses. In May 1891 he {{traveled}} to England to make a tour and what he considered a literary pilgrimage. He landed in Liverpool and traveled first to Dumfries, Scotland, the home <b>and</b> <b>burial</b> place of Robert Burns. Riley had long been compared to Burns by critics because they both used dialect in their poetry and drew inspiration from their rural homes. He then traveled to Edinburgh, York, and London, reciting poetry for gatherings at each stop. Augustin Daly arranged for him to give a poetry reading to prominent British actors in London. Riley was warmly welcomed by its literary and theatrical community and he toured places that Shakespeare had frequented.|$|E
5|$|Significant Roman finds include {{parts of}} shops and houses {{that would have}} fronted onto Ermine Street, down which Roman armies marched {{to and from the}} Legionary Fortress at Lincoln. The city of Lincoln was very {{important}} at that time, probably the capital of the late Roman Province of Flavia Caesariensis. Evidence suggests that Navenby was a significant staging point along Ermine Street. The Romans are reported to have maintained a small base or garrison in the village, and a possible Romano-British temple <b>and</b> <b>burial</b> sites have been unearthed in the area. A 2009 archaeological dig uncovering a road, building foundations and Roman graves along with pottery and coins, showed Navenby to be a Roman Service Station.|$|E
