5|$|Postier Bretons were {{developed}} {{as a result of}} crossbreeding with the Norfolk Trotter and the Hackney during the 19th century. This type is bred mainly in central Brittany, has <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>attractive</b> gait, is a good coach horse, and capable of light farming work. Its name originates from its use in pulling mail coaches. The Postier was used extensively by the French Horse Artillery, and it {{has been described as a}} lighter version of the Suffolk Punch draft breed from Great Britain.|$|E

25|$|Perovskite {{solar cells}} are solar cells {{that include a}} perovskite-structured {{material}} as the active layer. Most commonly, this is a solution-processed hybrid organic-inorganic tin or lead halide based material. Efficiencies have increased from below 5% at their first usage in 2009 to over 20% in 2014, making them a very rapidly advancing technology and a hot topic in the solar cell field. Perovskite solar cells are also forecast to be extremely cheap to scale up, making them <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>attractive</b> option for commercialisation.|$|E

25|$|Adeno-associated virus (AAV) {{is a small}} {{virus that}} infects humans and some other primate species. AAV is not {{currently}} known to cause disease, and causes a very mild immune response. AAV can infect both dividing and non-dividing cells and may incorporate its genome into that of the host cell. Moreover, AAV mostly stays as episomal (replicating without incorporation into the chromosome); performing long and stable expression. These features make AAV <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>attractive</b> candidate for creating viral vectors for gene therapy. However, AAV can only bring up to 5kb which is considerably small compared to AAV's original capacity.|$|E
25|$|Only a {{few months}} later Gernot Rohr signed as a coach. Although team {{maintained}} a defensive football strategy, the club succeeded with him at its head, advancing to the Cup final, but losing on a penalty shoot-out to Sion. The first season at the Stade de Suisse Wankdorf, YB finished in third place, qualifying for the UEFA Cup. The Bernese defeated Mika of Armenia 4–1 on aggregate in the first qualifying round to set up <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>attractive</b> matchup with French giants Marseille, but narrowly lost the tie on away goals with draws 3–3 at home and 0–0 away.|$|E
25|$|Accompanied with Recep Tayyip Erdoğan of Turkey, Aziz {{travelled}} to Iran in 2006, {{and privately}} told Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad he must change course regarding its nuclear program, {{as the current}} direction was neither in Iran’s nor the region's interest. Aziz urged Ahmadinejad to immediately place a moratorium on uranium enrichment while {{on the other hand}} Erdoğan described the EU-3 proposal, with Russian enhancements, as <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>attractive</b> offer for Iran. Both Aziz and Erdoğan condemned Ahmedinejad’s statements attacking Israel as completely unacceptable and serving no purpose. Aziz's tenure considerably improved relations with Japan and after visiting Japan, Aziz welcomes the investment in the manufacturing sector and Pak-Japan joint ventures in steel manufacturing as an excellent symbol of cooperation in expanding steel production between two countries.|$|E

50|$|The {{polygonal}} dolmen (Polygonaldolmen) is <b>a</b> visually <b>very</b> <b>attractive</b> megalithic architectural {{structure and}} is therefore often depicted as the archetypal dolmen. It is encountered especially frequently {{in the north of}} the Danish island of Zealand, in the Swedish province of Bohuslän and on the Cimbrian Peninsula, for example, at Troldkirken in Jutland. In Schleswig-Holstein, there are 11 examples. In Lower Saxony, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and Saxony-Anhalt (Lüdelsen) they appear are only occasionally.|$|R
25|$|Adeno-associated virus (AAV) {{is a small}} virus which infects {{humans and}} some other primate species. AAV is not {{currently}} known to cause disease. The virus causes a very mild immune response, lending further support to its apparent lack of pathogenicity. Gene therapy vectors using AAV can infect both dividing and quiescent cells and persist in an extrachromosomal state without integrating into the genome of the host cell, although in the native virus some integration of virally carried genes into the host genome does occur. These features make AAV <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>attractive</b> candidate for creating viral vectors for gene therapy, and {{for the creation of}} isogenic human disease models. Recent human clinical trials using AAV for gene therapy in the retina have shown promise.|$|E
25|$|If {{graphite}} is used, {{the gross}} erosion rates due to {{physical and chemical}} sputtering would be many meters per year, so one must rely on redeposition of the sputtered material. The location of the redeposition will not exactly coincide with {{the location of the}} sputtering, so one is still left with erosion rates that may be prohibitive. An even larger problem is the tritium co-deposited with the redeposited graphite. The tritium inventory in graphite layers and dust in a reactor could quickly build up to many kilograms, representing a waste of resources and a serious radiological hazard in case of an accident. The consensus of the fusion community seems to be that graphite, although <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>attractive</b> material for fusion experiments, cannot be the primary plasma-facing material (PFM) in a commercial reactor.|$|E
25|$|The Church of St Albert the Great in Pollokshields was {{originally}} built for a congregation of the United Presbyterian Church. The Italian Renaissance design by John B. Wilson {{was also used}} in another building, Stockwell Free Church, in 1887. St Albert's original title was Albert Road Church, being named after Queen Victoria's consort, Prince Albert, rather than the German saint {{of the same name}} who is the current patron. The Archdiocese of Glasgow acquired the church in 1965 for the new parish and with minimal interference to the original interior or exterior design, it was brought back into use as a church in 1967. The cream sandstone facade has <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>attractive</b> octagonal vestibule and tall bell tower. St Ninian's church is part of the Scottish Episcopal Church located on the corner of Albert Drive and Pollokshaws road.|$|E
5000|$|The unusual {{characteristics}} {{described above}} render <b>A.</b> adeninivorans <b>very</b> <b>attractive</b> for biotechnological applications. On the one hand, it {{is a source}} for many enzymes with interesting properties and the respective genes, for instance glucoamylase, tannase, lipase, phosphatases and many others. On the other hand it is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> robust and safe organism that can be genetically engineered to produce foreign proteins. Suitable host strains can be transformed with plasmids. The basic design of such plasmids {{is similar to that}} described under Hansenula polymorpha and yeast expression platforms.|$|R

25|$|After Hazumu's {{transformation}} into a girl, Asuta suddenly finds {{his good friend}} Hazumu very attractive, and cannot help himself when he starts thinking about Hazumu in a sexual way. During the time when Hazumu and her friends go to the beach, Asuta continuously tries to remind himself that even though Hazumu's body has changed, the person is still the same, and as her best friend, {{he should not be}} thinking about her in a sexual way. Hazumu remains oblivious to the fact throughout the series that Asuta has been often thinking about her in a sexual way. Asuta continues to have fantasies about having Hazumu as a girlfriend as well. Overtime, Asuta realizes that Hazumu and him gradually grow apart from each other, or are at least not as close as they once had been when Hazumu was a boy. He does find it excellent that his friend is now <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>attractive</b> girl, but only wants to continue being Hazumu's friend and nothing more, constantly beating himself up for having impure thoughts about Hazumu. In the last pages of the manga, he announces to the others that he has found a girlfriend, and shows them a photograph of her. They remark that she looks a lot like Hazumu.|$|E

500|$|Luke Butcher {{noted that}} Ingels taps into metamodern sensibility, {{adopting}} a metamodern attitude; but he [...] "seems to oscillate between modern positions and postmodern ones, a certain out-of-this-worldness and a definite down-to-earthness, naivety and knowingness, idealism and the practical." [...] Sustainable development {{and renewable energy}} are important to Ingels, which {{he refers to as}} [...] "hedonistic sustainability". He has said that [...] "It's not about what we give up to be sustainable, it's about what we get. And that is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>attractive</b> and marketable concept." ...|$|E
500|$|Saturday is a [...] "post 9/11" [...] novel, {{dealing with}} the change in {{lifestyle}} faced by Westerners after the 11 September attacks in the United States. As such, Christopher Hitchens characterised it as [...] "unapologetically anchored {{as it is in}} the material world and its several discontents". [...] "Structurally, Saturday is a tightly wound tour de force of several strands"; it is both a thriller which portrays <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>attractive</b> family, and an allegory of the world after 11 September 2001 which meditates on the fragility of life.|$|E

30|$|A priori, {{a general}} method to the {{description}} of the collective word intuition of Chinese speakers is to summarize the individual word intuition of all the Chinese speakers. In principle, collective word intuition of Chinese speakers can be measured using word segmentation tasks (Hoosain 1992; Wang 王立 2003), assuming that speakers’ word segmentation behaviors reflect their word intuition. This quantifiable result of segmentation consistency can be a convenient measurement of Chinese speakers’ word intuition. This leads to <b>a</b> potentially <b>very</b> <b>attractive</b> feature of collective word intuition: that it can be quantified with probabilistic values.|$|R
