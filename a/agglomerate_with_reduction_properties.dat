30|$|The second {{observation}} {{relates to}} shear-induced agglomeration processes. In general, particle agglomeration {{can be attributed}} to two physical causes. Brownian motion results in isokinetic agglomeration which is shear independent. In orthokinetic agglomeration, particle collision rates increase with shear: at higher shear rates, layers of fluid (with suspended particles), move faster past one another (Elimelech et al. 1995). Equation  1 shows that the shear is larger in larger fractures. Orthokinetic processes thus have potential to mechanically block or narrow larger fractures selectively because of the faster agglomeration processes in them due to larger shear. This applies to both particles <b>agglomerating</b> <b>with</b> each other or <b>agglomerating</b> <b>with</b> the fracture wall.|$|R
40|$|During an {{agricultural}} application, sprays are formed by atomization through a hydraulic nozzle. Fine spray droplets can cause off-target contamination with agrochemicals {{when they move}} by air from the application site. Dilute oil-in-water emulsions create coarser sprays than water, when atomized through a flat fan nozzle, and are therefore interesting for drift control purposes. However, different emulsions influence the spray droplet size to a different extent and this effect is not yet well understood. With an aim to develop products <b>with</b> drift <b>reduction</b> <b>properties</b> {{it is necessary to}} comprehend the mechanism of interactions between emulsion droplets and the continuous aqueous phase. In this study, we analyze systematically the effects of different physical properties of oils on the spray formation process and investigate how the type of the emulsified oil, the concentration of emulsifier, emulsion droplet size, the spreading properties of the emulsified oil, and its viscosity influence the spray droplet size. Based on the experimental data, we propose a spray formation mechanism of dilute oil-in-water emulsions. We argue that when the liquid sheet leaves the nozzle, some emulsion droplets might merge with the air/water interface of the liquid sheet, spread there and induce a subphase flow, which, reinforced by perturbations in a turbulent flow, will initiate spray atomization. In mixtures of a dilute emulsion and a water soluble surfactant, dynamic surface tension at the interface of the liquid sheet controls the spray formation process. Surfactants located at the interface form a kinetic barrier for the spreading emulsion droplets and thus delay the atomization onset...|$|R

This research attempts to examine mechanical properties of Boron mixed brake pads. Five groups of semi-metallic composite materials were studied. Friction coefficient of Boron mixed and commercial brake pads were significantly different. Average friction coefficient of Boron mixed pads was 0. 495, 0. 065 higher than commercial pad. Abrupt reduction of friction coefficient which is known as fade was more significant in the commercial pad samples than in Boron mixed pads. Fade occurred in commercial pad sample at the lower temperature as first fade was at 204 oC and second was at 159 oC resulted from earlier softening and degradation of Alumina material. All Boron pads were more stable and constant than their commercial counterparts. The study shows a slight reduction of friction coefficient at a temperature of 204 oC during the first fade and 238 oC on the second for Boron mixed pads.

First, we propose novel variants of stochastic gradient descent <b>with</b> a variance <b>reduction</b> <b>property</b> that enables linear convergence for strongly convex objectives. Second, we study distributed setting, {{in which the}} data describing the optimization problem does not fit into a single computing node. In this case, traditional methods are inefficient, as the communication costs inherent in distributed optimization become the bottleneck. We propose a communication-efficient framework which iteratively forms local subproblems that can be solved with arbitrary local optimization algorithms. Finally, we introduce the concept of Federated Optimization/Learning, where we try to solve the machine learning problems without having data stored in any centralized manner. The main motivation comes from industry when handling user-generated data. The current prevalent practice is that companies collect vast amounts of user data and store them in datacenters. An alternative we propose is not to collect the data in first place, and instead occasionally use the computational power of users' devices to solve the very same optimization problems, while alleviating privacy concerns at the same time. In such setting, minimization of communication rounds is the primary goal, and we demonstrate that solving the optimization problems in such circumstances is conceptually tractable.
