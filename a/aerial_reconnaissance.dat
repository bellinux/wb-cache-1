5|$|Initially, the {{military}} potential of pigeon photography for <b>aerial</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> appeared attractive. Battlefield tests in World War I provided encouraging results, but the ancillary technology of mobile dovecotes for messenger pigeons {{had the greatest}} impact. Owing to the rapid perfection of aviation during the war, military interest in pigeon photography faded and Neubronner abandoned his experiments. The idea was briefly resurrected in the 1930s by a Swiss clockmaker, and reportedly also by the German and French militaries. Although war pigeons were deployed extensively during World War II, it is unclear to what extent, if any, birds were involved in <b>aerial</b> <b>reconnaissance.</b> The United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) later developed a battery-powered camera designed for espionage pigeon photography; details of its use remain classified.|$|E

5|$|<b>Aerial</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> found Ottoman forces {{moving their}} {{headquarters}} north from Beersheba, while the garrison at their main desert base of Hafir El Auja was slightly increased. Other Ottoman outposts at El Kossaima and Nekhl remained, {{along with their}} strong defensive system of trenches and redoubts at El Magruntein, defending Rafa, on the frontier between Egypt and the southern Ottoman Empire.|$|E
5|$|By {{the evening}} of 20 September, Chauvel's {{communications}} with his cavalry divisions, were limited to wireless and aircraft. The last <b>aerial</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> on 20 September reported three large fires burning at Nablus railway station, fires burning at the Balata dumps, and the whole Ottoman front line from El Lubban to the Jordan alarmed. They also reported a brigade of British cavalry entering Beisan.|$|E
5|$|Dawn aerial {{scouting}} on 21 September returned {{reports of}} the previous day's attacks on roads leading towards the Jordan River, which was only a precursor to the follow up attacks that day. From midday on 22 September, and in particular from 15:00 to 18:00, <b>aerial</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> found Ottoman troops at Es Salt and in the surrounding areas withdrawing towards Amman.|$|E
50|$|During the {{concentration}} of Allenby's force on {{the western end of}} the front line, German and Ottoman aircraft were unable to carry out reliable <b>aerial</b> <b>reconnaissances</b> as the British and Australian aircraft had almost complete dominance of the skies. Only four of their aircraft succeeded in crossing the lines during the period of concentration prior to Megiddo, as against over 100 during one week in June.|$|R

5|$|The {{purpose of}} vehicle and {{equipment}} camouflage differs from personal camouflage {{in that the}} primary threat is <b>aerial</b> <b>reconnaissance.</b> The goal is to disrupt the characteristic shape of the vehicle, to reduce shine, {{and to make the}} vehicle difficult to identify even if it is spotted.|$|E
5|$|<b>Aerial</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> {{reported}} that no defensive works {{of any kind}} had been identified on the plain or covering the approaches to it, apart from German troops, garrisoned at the Yildirim Army Group headquarters of Otto Liman von Sanders at Nazareth. At 12:30 on 19 September Liman von Sanders ordered the 13th Depot Regiment at Nazareth and the military police, {{a total of six}} companies and 12 machine guns, to occupy Lejjun and defend the Musmus Pass.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{cancellation}} of the programme in 1982, the Senior Prom remained highly classified into the 21st century.

Sixty years after its original introduction it was still in active service, being operated by the Lebanese Air Force until 2014.|$|E
5|$|HMS Empress was a {{seaplane}} {{carrier of}} the Royal Navy (RN) that served during the First World War. Converted from the Cross-Channel packet ship Empress, the ship's aircraft conducted <b>aerial</b> <b>reconnaissance,</b> observation and bombing missions in the North Sea and Eastern Mediterranean. During {{the last year}} of the war, she conducted anti-submarine patrols in the Mediterranean. Empress was returned to her owners in 1919 and was then sold to a French company in 1923. She was scrapped in 1933.|$|E
5|$|In mid-May, <b>aerial</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> near Mont Sorrel {{indicated}} that German forces were preparing an attack. Royal Flying Corps (RFC) observers had noted {{the existence of}} works curiously resembling the Canadian positions, well behind the German lines. The Germans were also observed digging new sap trenches which implied that an assault was intended. The Canadian Corps had just begun developing plans to overrun the more dangerous German positions, when the Germans executed an assault of their own.|$|E

50|$|From 1966, {{with the}} {{creation}} of Transport and Liaison Squadron (Esquadra de Ligação e Transporte), to 2009 the base was also home to transport, liaison, <b>aerial</b> photographic <b>reconnaissance,</b> and maritime patrol squadrons. In 1993, 502 Squadron was transferred to BA1.|$|R
5|$|Neubronner's {{invention}} was {{at least}} partially motivated {{by the prospect of}} military applications. At the time photographic <b>aerial</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> was possible but cumbersome, as it involved balloons, kites or rockets. The Wright brothers' successful flight in 1903 presented new possibilities, and surveillance aircraft were introduced and perfected during the First World War. But pigeon-based photography, despite its practical difficulties, promised to deliver complementary, detailed photographs taken from a lower height.|$|E
5|$|The {{series of}} six well-situated and {{developed}} redoubts {{making up the}} strong Ottoman garrison position at Magdhaba reflected considerable planning; the redoubts were almost impossible to locate on the flat ground {{on both sides of}} the Wadi el Arish. Clearly, the move of the Ottoman garrison from El Arish had not been a sudden, panicked reaction; indeed it was first noticed by Allied <b>aerial</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> planes as early as 25 October.|$|E
5|$|Although the UN <b>aerial</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> {{observed}} on November 27 that the Chinese {{forces on the}} UN right flank were moving rapidly into the Eighth Army's rear, Walker still ordered {{the rest of the}} Eighth Army to continue the offensive north. Convinced that the collapse of the ROK II Corps was merely a small counterattack by the Chinese, Walker ordered the US I and IX Corps to shift eastward in order to cover the ROK II Corps' sector. By that time, however, the US I and IX Corps had already suffered heavy losses from the Chinese counteroffensive at Kujang-dong, Ipsok and Yongsan-dong.|$|E
500|$|As {{the troops}} of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF) began to {{concentrate}} in preparation for their attacks, they left their camps standing to deceive German and Ottoman <b>aerial</b> <b>reconnaissances.</b> The EEF assumed their opponents thought there were still six infantry divisions in the Gaza area {{and one in the}} eastern sector towards Beersheba. However, according to Falls, [...] "here is evidence that the [...] were fairly accurately informed of the British dispositions." [...] On 28 October, they knew the camps at Khan Yunis and Rafa [...] were empty and accurately placed three infantry divisions east of the Wadi Ghuzzee with a fourth, the 10th (Irish) Division approaching the wadi. They estimated more cavalry at Asluj and Khalasa than was actually there.|$|R

5|$|Central Area Command was one {{of several}} {{geographically}} based commands raised by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) during World War II. It was formed in March 1940, and covered the central portion of New South Wales. Headquartered at Sydney, Central Area Command was primarily responsible for air defence, <b>aerial</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> and protection of the sea lanes within its boundaries. It was disbanded in August 1941 and control of its units taken over by other RAAF formations. Proposals in 1943–44 to raise a new Central Area Command did not come to fruition.|$|E
5|$|HMS Anne was a {{seaplane}} {{carrier of}} the Royal Navy {{used during the}} First World War. Converted from the captured German freighter Aenne Rickmers, the ship's two aircraft conducted <b>aerial</b> <b>reconnaissance,</b> observation and bombing missions in the Eastern Mediterranean and Red Sea during 1915–17 even though the ship was not commissioned into the Royal Navy until mid-1915. She was decommissioned in late 1917 and became a Merchant Navy collier {{for the last year}} of the war. Anne was sold off in 1922 and had a succession of owners and names until she was scrapped in 1958.|$|E
5|$|In 1943 French agents {{reported}} that the Germans were planning to mount an offensive against the United Kingdom that would involve the use of secret weapons resembling giant mortars sunk {{in the ground and}} served by rail links. The first signs of abnormal activity at Mimoyecques were spotted by analysts at the Allied Central Interpretation Unit in September 1943, when <b>aerial</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> revealed that the Germans were building railway loops leading to the tunnels into the eastern and western sites. Further reconnaissance flights in October 1943 photographed large-scale activity around the tunnels.|$|E
