40|$|ME 450 Capstone Design and Manufacturing Experience: Fall 2015 The {{design team}} spent eight {{weeks in the}} Obstetrics and Gynecology Department at a {{tertiary}} referral hospital, Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (KATH), in Kumasi, Ghana. During the team’s immersion experience at the hospital, the team observed healthcare providers experiencing difficulty following obstetrics patients’ blood pressure management plans. This occurred {{largely because of the}} high volume of patients and the busyness of the wards. The patient's blood pressure measurement strongly influences the treatment especially if she has hypertensive disorders. Hypertensive disorders, mainly preeclampsia and eclampsia, are the second leading cause of maternal mortality worldwide and the leading cause of maternal mortality at KATH. The team identified an opportunity {{for the development of a}} blood pressure measurement device to aid the healthcare providers in measuring the patients’ blood pressures every 30 minutes or four hours according to their management plans. This project is in collaboration with clinical mentors and advisors at University of Michigan Hospital and KATH. The final design is an auscultatory device with a microphone stethoscope and headphones to listen to the Korotkoff sounds, a hand pump for manual inflation, an automatic constant rate deflation facilitated by a solenoid valve, a LCD screen to display the current pressure, a slip-on cuff, an <b>aneroid</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge</b> for calibration, a handle, a storage area, and a rechargeable battery. The current prototype follows the design fairly closely however the device is not powered by a rechargeable battery and the electrical components are all on a breadboard which prevents its portability. All validation testing completed so far on the current prototype has been promising including testing the accuracy and ease-of-use of the device when used by three nursing student. This device will be continued to be improved next semester so that it can be taken to KATH for further validation and feedback...|$|E

40|$|Existe escasa evidencia que evalúe la función muscular respiratoria de niños con antecedente de mielomeningocele (MMC). La disfunción de la musculatura inspiratoria puede facilitar complicaciones respiratorias. Objetivo: Evaluar la función de la musculatura inspiratoria, medida a través de la Presión inspiratoria máxima (Pimax), en niños con antecedente de MMC. Pacientes y Métodos: En 13 niños se obtuvo Pimax mediante técnica de Black and Hyatt, utilizando un manómetro aneroide. Los valores obtenidos fueron comparados con los valores de referencia de Szeinberg utilizando t Student, considerando significativos p Background: Respiratory {{musculature}} {{function in}} patients with myelomeningocele (MMC) has not been evaluated sufficiently. Impairment in inspiratory muscles capacity could make patients prone to complications in clinical situations in which the respiratory work is increased. Objective: Evaluate inspiratory muscle function, measured with Maximal Inspiratory Pressure (MTP) in children with MMC. Method: In 13 children with MMC, MIP was obtained according to Black and Hyatt technique, using an <b>aneroid</b> <b>gauge</b> <b>pressure.</b> The results were compared to Szeinberg reference values by t Student, where p < 0. 05 was considered significant. Results: The average age was 11. 9 ± 2. 8 years and 10 female. Expected MIP average was 112 ± 20 cmH(2) 0, with lower limit of 92 cmH(2) 0. The observed Pimax was 62 ± 23 cmH(2) 0, 33 % less than the inferior limit expected (p < 0. 05). Conclusions: These children present a decrease of inspiratory musculature force, making them suceptible to muscle fatigue in pathological conditions, requiring a greater respiratory effort and difficulties in mechanical ventilation weaning. We suggest that a regular study of inspiratory muscles is neccessary in MMC patients, in order to define a respiratory musculature training necessit...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. For {{a case of}} constant-rate liquid {{production}} from a single well centered in a horizontal, homogeneous-acting, isopachous, and infinite reservoir, based on fundamentals of fluid flow in porous media the bottom hole flowing pressure never stabilize. In the process of field well testing, however, pressure values measured by the <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge</b> which has a definite resolution value will not change after a period, so the bottom hole flowing pressure can {{be considered to be}} stabilized. According to this situation, through theoretical derivation, a stabilized time formula is firstly proposed, by which the time after which the bottom hole flowing pressure measured with a <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge</b> will be stabilized can be calculated, and the stabilized time for a given <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge</b> is in direct proportion to the liquid producing rate, but in inverse proportion to the resolution ratio of the <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge.</b> Applied the stabilized time formula, a new formula of detectable radius can be derived, by which the effect of resolution of the <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge</b> can be considered. Secondly, the time after which the value of the <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge</b> measured in the bottom hole of the observation well starts to change during interference testing is obtained, and the time is related to the fluid flow rate and the distance between the producing well and the observation well. The conclusion can be applied as a reference in the design process of working system during well testing...|$|R
