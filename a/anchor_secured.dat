25|$|The Fulton Surface-To-Air Recovery System {{was used}} to extract {{personnel}} and materials via air. A large helium balloon raised a nylon lift line into the air, which was snagged by a large scissors-shaped yoke attached to {{the nose of the}} plane. The yoke snagged the line and released the balloon, yanking the attached cargo off the ground with a shock less than that of an opening parachute. A sky <b>anchor</b> <b>secured</b> the line and wires stretched from the nose to both leading wing tip edges protected the propellers from the line on missed snag attempts. Crew members hooked the snagged line as it trailed behind and attached it to the hydraulic winch, pulling the attached person or cargo into the plane through the rear cargo door.|$|E

The aircraft would fly into the line, aiming at a bright mylar marker placed at the 425-foot (130 m) level. As the line was caught between the forks on {{the nose of the}} aircraft, the balloon was released and a spring-loaded trigger mechanism (sky <b>anchor)</b> <b>secured</b> the line to the aircraft. After the initial pickup, the line was snared by the pickup crew using a J-hook and attached to a powered winch and the person or cargo pulled on board. To prevent the pickup line from interfering with the aircraft's propellers {{in the case of an}} unsuccessful catch, the aircraft had deflector cables strung from the nose to the wingtips.|$|E

50|$|The {{device is}} {{connected}} {{at one end}} {{to the beginning of the}} duodenum (first portion of the small intestine from the stomach) and at the other the mid-jejunum (the secondary stage of the small intestine). A nitinol <b>anchor</b> <b>secures</b> the bag at the duodenum, ensuring the liner doesn't migrate and that the chyme (the semifluid mass of partially digested food that exits the stomach) completely enters into the liner. This prevents the partially digested food from entering the first and initial part of the secondary stage of the small intestine, mimicking the effects of the biliopancreatic portion of Roux en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery. This reduces the amount of calories absorbed and causes bile and pancreatic fluids to be redistributed later in the mid-jejunum for reduced breakdown and absorption of the chyme.|$|R

25|$|For centuries {{large numbers}} of lead bars have been found on the Mediterranean seabed, and there was debate over whether they were anchor stocks or not. It was argued by some that iron tipped wooden <b>anchors</b> <b>secured</b> by ropes were not heavy enough to be {{effective}} {{so they had to}} have metal stocks and there was considerable academic controversy over the issue. The Nemi ships, constructed during the transition period when iron anchors were replacing wooden ones, were the first Roman wrecks found to have intact anchors, and confirmed that the lead bars were indeed anchor stocks. Two types of anchor were found, one of oak with iron-tipped flukes and a stock of lead while the other was of iron with a folding timber stock that closely matched the design of the Admiralty pattern anchor re-invented in 1841. In the 1960s, a similar anchor was found in Pompeii and in 1974 another was found buried near Aberdarewllyn in Gwynedd, Wales. These further discoveries confirmed that these technologically advanced anchors were a standard Roman design.|$|R
40|$|The use of fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) {{composites}} as {{a repair}} and strengthening material for reinforced concrete (RC) members has {{increased over the}} past twenty years. The tendency for FRP sheets to debond at loads below their ultimate capacity has prompted researchers to investigate various approaches and designs to increase the efficiency of FRP strengthening systems. Various anchors, wrapping techniques and clamps have been explored to postpone and/or delay the debonding process which results in premature failure. FRP anchors are of particular interest because they can be selected to have the same material properties as the FRP sheets that are installed for strengthening or repair of the RC member and can be done so using the same adhesives and installation techniques. This research study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of using commercially manufactured FRP <b>anchors</b> to <b>secure</b> FRP sheets installed to strengthen and repair RC beams in shear and RC slabs in flexure. Twenty one shear critical RC beams were strengthened in shear with u-wrapped FRP sheets and FRP anchors. Eight RC one-way slabs were strengthened in flexure with FRP sheets and FRP anchors. The test variables include the type of FRP sheets (GFRP,CFRP), type of FRP anchors (CFRP, GFRP) and the strengthening configuration. The test results of the shear critical RC beams revealed that the installation of commercially manufactured FRP <b>anchors</b> to <b>secure</b> externally applied u-wrap FRP sheets improved the shear behaviour of the strengthened beam. The installation of FRP <b>anchors</b> to <b>secure</b> u-wrapped FRP sheets provided an average 15 % increase in the shear strength over companion unanchored beams and improved the ductility of failure experienced with the typical shear failure in beams. The use of FRP anchors allowed the FRP sheets to develop their tensile capacity. Premature failure by FRP debonding was eradicated with the presence of FRP anchors and the failure modes of the strengthened beams with FRP anchors was altered when compared to the companion unanchored beam. Additionally, as the width of a u-wrapped FRP sheet was increased; larger increases in strength were obtained when FRP anchors were used. The test results of the flexure critical RC slabs revealed that the installation of commercially manufactured FRP <b>anchors</b> to <b>secure</b> externally applied u-wrapped FRP sheets improved the behaviour of strengthened slabs. Installation of FRP <b>anchors</b> to <b>secure</b> flexural FRP sheets provided an average 17 % increase in strength over companion unanchored beams. The use of FRP anchors allowed the FRP sheets to develop their full tensile strength. Premature failure by CFRP debonding was not eliminated with the presence of FRP anchors; rather the critical failure zone was shifted from the bottom soffit of the slab to the concrete/steel rebar interface. The failure modes of slabs with FRP anchors were altered for all specimens when compared to the companion unanchored slab. The effective strain in the FRP sheet was predicted and compared with the experimental results. The efficiency of FRP anchors defined as the ratio of effective strain in the FRP sheet with and without anchors was related to the increase in strength in beams and slabs. A good correlation was established between the FRP anchor efficiency and the increase in strength. A step-by-step FRP anchor installation procedure was developed and a model to predict the number of FRP <b>anchors</b> required to <b>secure</b> a FRP sheet was proposed. This is the most comprehensive examination of beams and slabs strengthened with FRP sheets and FRP anchors conducted to date. This study provides an engineer with basic understanding of the mechanics, behaviour and failure modes of beams and slabs strengthened with FRP sheets and anchors...|$|R
