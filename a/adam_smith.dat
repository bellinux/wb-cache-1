5|$|The <b>Adam</b> <b>Smith</b> Theatre, the town's main auditorium, plays host to {{theatrical}} {{and musical}} productions {{as well as}} showing a selection of arthouse and commercial films.

5|$|Cantillon {{is one of}} the few economists {{cited by}} <b>Adam</b> <b>Smith,</b> who {{directly}} borrows Cantillon's sustenance theory of wages. Large sections of Smith's economic theory were possibly directly influenced by Cantillon, although in many respects <b>Adam</b> <b>Smith</b> advanced well beyond the scope of Cantillon. Some economic historians have argued that <b>Adam</b> <b>Smith</b> provided little of value from his own intellect, notably Schumpeter and Rothbard. In any case, through his influence on <b>Adam</b> <b>Smith</b> and the physiocrats, Cantillon was quite possibly the pre-classical economist who contributed most to the ideas of the classical school. Illustrative of this was Cantillon's influence on Say, which is noticeable in the methodology employed in the latter's Treatise on Political Economy.|$|E

The Colonial Dames of America purchased the site in 1924 and in 1939 opened {{it to the public}} as the Abigail <b>Adams</b> <b>Smith</b> Museum. (Abigail <b>Adams</b> <b>Smith</b> and her husband William had owned the property briefly in 1795 but did not live on site.)

5|$|Essai is {{considered}} the first complete treatise on economics, with numerous contributions to the science. These contributions include: his cause and effect methodology, monetary theories, his conception of the entrepreneur as a risk-bearer, {{and the development of}} spatial economics.

5|$|The size of {{a market}} assumes primary {{importance}} {{in the study of}} what induces investment in a country. Ragnar Nurkse referenced the work of Allyn A. Young to assert that inducement to invest is limited {{by the size of the}} market. The original idea behind this was put forward by <b>Adam</b> <b>Smith,</b> who stated that division of labour (as against inducement to invest) is limited by the extent of the market.|$|E

5|$|Hamilton's Report on a National Bank was a {{projection}} {{from the first}} Report on the Public Credit. Although Hamilton had been forming ideas of a national bank as early as 1779, he gathered ideas in various ways over the past eleven years. These included theories from <b>Adam</b> <b>Smith,</b> extensive studies on the Bank of England, the blunders of the Bank of North America and his experience in establishing the Bank of New York. He also used American records from James Wilson, Pelatiah Webster, Gouverneur Morris, and from his assistant Treasury secretary Tench Coxe.|$|E
5|$|It was Newton's {{conception}} of the universe based upon natural and rationally understandable laws that {{became one of the}} seeds for Enlightenment ideology. Locke and Voltaire applied concepts of natural law to political systems advocating intrinsic rights; the physiocrats and <b>Adam</b> <b>Smith</b> applied natural conceptions of psychology and self-interest to economic systems; and sociologists criticised the current social order for trying to fit history into natural models of progress. Monboddo and Samuel Clarke resisted elements of Newton's work, but eventually rationalised it to conform with their strong religious views of nature.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 1785, Espejo took an {{interest}} in the welfare of his community and the prosperity of Quito. His works between that year and 1792 clearly show the influence of Enlightenment philosophers, whose ideas Espejo adapted to local conditions. As many thinkers realized the power of economics as a social force, Espejo, influenced by Feijoo and <b>Adam</b> <b>Smith</b> among others, showed his desire for commercial and agricultural reforms, especially conservation and proper use of land. To advance these ideas, he founded the Escuela de la Concordia (School of Concord).|$|E

5|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{directed}} by director duo Ne-o and shot in 16 mm film in various places in Budapest, Hungary. The visual, which features a basketball bouncing around the streets with its owner running to catch it, drew comparisons with the 1956 short film The Red Balloon. Another visual, created by director <b>Adam</b> <b>Smith</b> for an alternate version of the song, was donated to the charity group Good for Nothing's 50/50 Make or Break campaign in 2011. The track also received a remix from DFA, whose version received much acclaim from critics.|$|E
5|$|Belgrano {{also studied}} living languages, {{political}} economy, and public rights. The authors that most influenced him were Pedro Rodríguez de Campomanes, Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos, <b>Adam</b> <b>Smith,</b> and François Quesnay. Belgrano translated Quesnay's book Maximes générales de gouvernement economique d'un royaume agricole (General Maxims of the Economical Government in an Agricultural Kingdom) to Spanish. His main {{interest in the}} works of such authors were ideas that referred to the public good and popular prosperity. Like many South American students, he became interested in physiocracy, which stated that new wealth came from nature, that agriculture was an economic activity that generated more income than one needed, and that the state should not interfere at all with it. By that time, South America had plenty of natural resources and a very strict state interventionism in the economy. Belgrano developed the idea that the principles of physiocracy and those stated by <b>Adam</b> <b>Smith</b> could be applied together in the viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata. In the development of this approach he was influenced by Fernando Galliani, who promoted the study of particular cases over theoric generalisations, and Antonio Genovesi, who thought that the absolute freedom promoted by physiocrats should be tempered by a moderate intervention by the state, such as the provision of free education for some. During his time in Europe, Belgrano became president of an Academy within the University of Salamanca devoted to Roman legislation, forensic practice and political economy.|$|E

He remained in the starting line-up {{for the remainder of}} 2013–14, and played in both play-off semi-final matches against Cambridge, in which Halifax were eliminated 2–1 on aggregate.|$|E

5|$|Scotland {{made a major}} {{contribution}} to the intellectual life of Europe, particularly in the Enlightenment, producing major figures including the economist <b>Adam</b> <b>Smith,</b> philosophers Francis Hutcheson and David Hume, and scientists William Cullen, Joseph Black and James Hutton. In the 19th century major figures included James Watt, James Clerk Maxwell, Lord Kelvin and Sir Walter Scott. Scotland's economic contribution to the Empire and the industrial revolution included its banking system {{and the development of}} cotton, coal mining, shipbuilding and an extensive railway network. Industrialisation and changes to agriculture and society led to depopulation and clearances of the largely rural highlands, migration to the towns and mass immigration, where Scots made a {{major contribution}} to the development of countries including the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|The 2009–10 {{season was}} Martin Foyle's first full season {{as manager of}} York City and the team reached the play-offs after {{finishing}} fifth in the Conference Premier table. After defeating Luton Town 2–0 on aggregate in the semi-final, York were beaten 3–1 by Oxford United in the 2010 Conference Premier play-off Final at Wembley Stadium. Jamie Clarke, Kevin Gall, Josh Mimms, Craig Nelthorpe, Alan O'Hare, Richard Pacquette and Simon Russell were released by York following the play-off defeat, with Luke Graham, Ben Purkiss and <b>Adam</b> <b>Smith</b> leaving for Kettering Town, Oxford and Mansfield Town respectively. Andy McWilliams was loaned out to Stalybridge Celtic. Levi Mackin and Djoumin Sangaré signed new contracts with the club.|$|E
5|$|The Keynesian Revolution was {{associated}} with the rise of modern liberalism in the West during the post-war period. Keynesian ideas became so popular that some scholars point to Keynes as representing the ideals of modern liberalism, as <b>Adam</b> <b>Smith</b> represented the ideals of classical liberalism. After the war, Winston Churchill attempted to check the rise of Keynesian policy-making in the United Kingdom and used rhetoric critical of the mixed economy in his 1945 election campaign. Despite his popularity as a war hero, Churchill suffered a landslide defeat to Clement Attlee whose government's economic policy continued to be influenced by Keynes's ideas.|$|E
