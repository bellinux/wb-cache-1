5|$|Gaudí {{evolved from}} plane to spatial geometry, to ruled geometry. These {{constructional}} forms are highly {{suited to the}} use of cheap materials such as brick. Gaudí frequently used brick laid with mortar in successive layers, as in the traditional Catalan vault, using the brick laid flat instead of on its side. This quest for new structural solutions culminated between 1910 and 1920, when he exploited his research and experience in his masterpiece, the Sagrada Família. Gaudí conceived the interior of the church {{as if it were a}} forest, with a set of tree-like columns divided into various branches to support <b>a</b> <b>structure</b> of intertwined hyperboloid vaults. He inclined the columns so they could better resist the perpendicular pressure on their section. He also gave them a double-turn helicoidal shape (right turn and left turn), as in the branches and trunks of trees. This created <b>a</b> <b>structure</b> that is now known as fractal. Together with a modulation of the space that divides it into small, independent and self-supporting modules, it creates <b>a</b> <b>structure</b> that perfectly supports the mechanical traction forces without need for buttresses, as required by the neo-Gothic style. Gaudí thus achieved a rational, structured and perfectly logical solution, creating at the same time a new architectural style that was original, simple, practical and aesthetic.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{reports on}} {{improvements}} to recent {{work on the}} computation of <b>a</b> <b>structured</b> low rank approximation of the Sylvester resultant matrix S(f,g) of two inexact polynomials f=f(y) and g=g(y). Specifically, {{it has been shown}} in previous work that these polynomials must be processed before <b>a</b> <b>structured</b> low rank approximation of S(f,g) is computed. The existing algorithm may still, however, yield <b>a</b> <b>structured</b> low rank approximation of S(f,g), but not <b>a</b> <b>structured</b> low rank approximation of S(g,f), which is unsatisfactory. Moreover, <b>a</b> <b>structured</b> low rank approximation of S(f,g) must be equal to, apart from permutations of its columns, <b>a</b> <b>structured</b> low rank approximation of S(g,f), but the existing algorithm does not guarantee the satisfaction of this condition. This paper addresses these issues by modifying the existing algorithm, such that these deficiencies are overcome. Examples that illustrate these improvements are shown...|$|R
