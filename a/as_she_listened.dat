25|$|Songs {{and music}} were a natural {{extension}} of this interest in words and {{her love of}} music began early in life <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>listened</b> to her father, Walter Pendleton Stringfellow, sing. She had access to a scrapbook of folk songs collected by her grandmother, Rosalie Cope Stringfellow. She began her music career collecting folksongs and performing them, first with her husband Jim in the late 1950s, then later on her own. It was during this time that the Smithsonian Institution's Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage recorded Rosalie and Jim performing her collection of traditional songs. Many of these have been released by Smithsonian Folkways Recordings in various compilation albums throughout the last fifty years.|$|E

Jarre used the minimalist imagery to reinforce the audio content of the DVD. The CD was mixed in super-stereo.|$|E
500|$|The tour {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times gave the concert a rave review affirming that Mars' energy never runs {{out as well}} as the [...] "seemingly effortless precision", which made the performance about itself. Wood finalized, [...] "The harder he played, the easier it appeared to get." [...] Holly Perry from AXS wrote that Mars was not only a [...] "true artist", but also [...] "an icon in the making". She concluded that the finale had the best production of the entire concert. Mike Wass of Idolator gave a positive review, as he witnessed Mars' [...] "powerful" [...] vocals and the band's [...] "incredibly musicianship." [...] He enlighted the singers [...] "swoonworthy rendition" [...] of [...] "When I Was Your Man", the [...] "rock interpretation" [...] of [...] "Grenade" [...] and the Pharrell duet. Jason Lipshutz, Billboard magazine writer, felt {{that one of the most}} stunning things on the concert was the catalog of number one records he left off the live show and still make it impressive. He continued, saying that Mars is a pop artist with the [...] "whole package", comparing him to [...] "an ace Pixar movie". Lipshutz ended his review stating that Mars is one of the best live performers at the given moment. The Boston Globes Sarah Rodman commented that the singer kept a high level of energy during the entire concert. She added, [...] "much work, planning, and rehearsal went in to the show, but Mars made it look easy." [...] Lillian Altman writing for The AU Review felt that [...] "the chemistry between the nine performers was phenomenal", since the band enjoys performing together by dancing and interacting with the public. After the show's finale Altman confessed that it was the first time she was walking home [...] "singing and dancing in the streets" [...] after attending a concert or festival <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>listened</b> to Mars' tracks on her iPod.|$|E

5000|$|Melissa Silverstein - (indieWire) {{described}} [...] "Michael's {{campaign to}} get Suu the Nobel Peace Prize to raise her visibility and protect her safety" [...] {{as one of the}} film's highlights.

She found that scene [...] "moving".|$|R
2500|$|Armstrong met {{his first}} serious girlfriend, Erica Paleno (also known as Arica Pelino), inside the Gilman music club on his sixteenth birthday. Erica {{became known as}} the [...] "first {{official}} Green Day fan" [...] <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>listened</b> to the first four-track recordings by Billie and Sean, encouraging the band, touring with them and acting as occasional photographer for the band. Erica inspired many of Green Day's well known songs including [...] "Christie Road", which was written for her by Armstrong about the local tracks where the couple would sneak out to meet. When Armstrong began living in punk houses and warehouses at the age of seventeen, including the warehouse above a West Oakland brothel which ultimately inspired the song [...] "Welcome to Paradise" [...] Erica would often stay with him despite the dangers, [...] "I would stay with him sometimes in these warehouses full of crusty punks". The couple split in late 1991. Erica is the sister of former Green Day touring member (2004–2005) Mike Pelino and sister-in-law of Janna White, wife of Green Day guitarist Jason White.|$|E
2500|$|Johnson was {{passionate about}} music {{from a young}} age and even asked her mother how anyone could live without it. She sang at a church and started playing the piano {{at the age of}} five, {{learning}} from her pastor's wife, Evangeline Thiessen. [...] Her parents played country music records by Jim Reeves and Don Williams at home and as she got older, her musical interests diversified <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>listened</b> to artists like ABBA, Charley Pride, Fleetwood Mac and Marty Stuart among others. The family later moved to Westlock, Alberta and Johnson attended RF Staples High School there. During her high school years, she learned to play the clarinet, flute and saxophone. She kept up her piano lessons largely in part due to Thiessan sending books and encouraging letters to her. [...] Her high school teachers were not as encouraging and caused her to turn away from music for a while and turn to science, a period in her life which she called [...] "a stain in her heart".|$|E

6000|$|Mother Nature has but one care, the children. We talk of Love as the Lord of Life: it is but the Minister. Our novels end where Nature's tale begins. The {{drama that}} our curtain falls upon, is but the prologue to her play. How the ancient Dame must laugh <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>listens</b> to the prattle of her children. [...] "Is Marriage a Failure?" [...] "Is Life worth Living?" [...] "The New Woman versus the Old."

25|$|Narration describes, in a {{tone that}} is at times enraptured and at other times pointedly cynical, Angelica's first visit to the Prince and his family {{following}} her betrothal to Tancredi. Dressed beautifully, she makes her entrance with perfect timing, and immediately endears herself to the Prince. Only Bendicò, growling in a corner, seems unhappy to see her. Finally, narration also describes how Angelica, <b>as</b> <b>she's</b> <b>listening,</b> coolly considers the financial and sexual prosperity that awaits them, and comments that, within a few years of the marriage, Angelica will become one of the great political kingmakers of the Italian Kingdom.|$|R

Climactically, the laugh track voices {{burst out of the}} ceiling, demanding a Court TV-style trial of Trudy and Keith, which Mrs. Siezmagraff quite happily and manically provides. Ultimately, Trudy and Keith, {{under the influence of the}} voices, blow up the house, leaving Betty alone on the beach to find peace and tranquility <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>listens</b> to the sound of the waves.|$|R

60|$|She {{took some}} tiny article of raiment {{from the chair}} at her crib side, and with it covered her shoulders. I {{suffered}} her to do <b>as</b> <b>she</b> pleased. <b>Listening</b> awhile in the darkness, I was aware that she still wept,--wept under restraint, quietly and cautiously.|$|R
60|$|She {{thought of}} all this, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> sat <b>listening</b> to the witty {{discourse}} of the Cabinet Minister, who, no doubt, {{felt that he had}} found in Lady Blakeney a most perfect listener.

Buffy finally comes downstairs and gives an inspirational speech about this huge challenge before them that is bigger than any evil they've ever faced. She tells the group that she's more scared than ever, but she's not about to back down now. There's a new plan: they're declaring war on this evil instead of waiting for it to make a move which Buffy says,"If they want an apocalypse, we'll give em one." ...|$|R
60|$|He went {{to sleep}} with the {{readiness}} of a child, and <b>as</b> <b>she</b> lay <b>listening</b> to his quiet breath she remembered how easy it had once been for her to sleep. She had the same agony of pity for him {{that she would have}} felt for a child she had wronged malevolently.|$|R
