Then, we give a refinement of Nagano-Smyth’s argument [9] and an alternative proof of Arezzo-Pirola’s proposition [2] about the Moduli space of compact min-imal surfaces in flat 4 -tori. Moreover, {{we show that}} <b>a</b> compact <b>minimal</b> surface of genus 4 in a 4 -dimensional flat torus is either <b>a</b> holomorphic <b>minimal</b> surface, or <b>a</b> non-holomorphic hyperelliptic <b>minimal</b> surface, or <b>a</b> non-holomorphic trigonal <b>minimal</b> surface, where <b>a</b> trigonal Riemann surface is a Riemann surface which can be represented as a 3 -sheeted branched cover of the sphere. 1...|$|R

5|$|A cutset in an {{arbitrary}} connected graph is {{a subset of}} edges defined from a partition of the vertices into two subsets, by including an edge in the subset when it has one endpoint {{on each side of}} the partition. Removing the edges of a cutset necessarily splits the graph into at least two connected components. <b>A</b> <b>minimal</b> cutset (also called a bond) is a cutset with the property that every proper subset of the cutset is not itself a cut. <b>A</b> <b>minimal</b> cutset of a connected graph necessarily separates its graph into exactly two components, and consists of the set of edges that have one endpoint in each component.

5|$|Another {{application}} of such chain conditions is in Noetherian induction—also known as well-founded induction—which is a generalization of mathematical induction. It frequently {{is used to}} reduce general statements about collections of objects to statements about specific objects in that collection. Suppose that S is a partially ordered set. One way of proving a statement about the objects of S is to assume {{the existence of a}} counterexample and deduce a contradiction, thereby proving the contrapositive of the original statement. The basic premise of Noetherian induction is that every non-empty subset of S contains <b>a</b> <b>minimal</b> element. In particular, the set of all counterexamples contains <b>a</b> <b>minimal</b> element, the minimal counterexample. In order to prove the original statement, therefore, it suffices to prove something seemingly much weaker: For any counterexample, there is a smaller counterexample.|$|E
