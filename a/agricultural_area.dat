40|$|AgrFarmland birds act as {{important}} bio-indicators for <b>agricultural</b> <b>areas.</b> Bird-based indicators reveal current negative trends in species diversity and landscape quality of German <b>agricultural</b> <b>areas.</b> Urgent, more effective nature protection and environmental measures {{are needed in}} <b>agricultural</b> <b>areas</b> to reach biodiversity targets. To this end, methods were developed to assess habitat suitability of indicator bird species, impacts of agricultural measures on farmland birds were analyzed and suggestions for a biodiversity-friendly land-use were derived. Research projects and local conservation measures are effective tools of biodiversity conservation in <b>agricultural</b> <b>areas.</b> Sustainable land-use forms that ensure biodiversity preservation inevitably need efficient nature protection measures in <b>agricultural</b> <b>areas,</b> as aimed by the EU’s Greening policy. Sufficiently beneficial effects could be reached through ecological focus areas, where these hold high habitat qualities and are large enough. Farmers should be off ered a choice of nature protection measures from which they can select the most operationally applicable to their situation. This, however, requires a weighting of measures of the ecological focus areas {{as a function of}} habitat quality. Also, a specific management way is necessary for this agricultural land...|$|R

5|$|East of Bronte Creek, Highway407 enters an <b>agricultural</b> <b>area,</b> {{interspersed}} with woodlots. It enters Oakville at the Tremaine Road (Halton Regional Road22) overpass, then gradually swerves {{to the north}} as it encounters an interchange with Bronte Road (Halton Regional Road25 and former Highway25). The route crosses Sixteen Mile Creek just north of Glenarchy Conservation Area, then travels parallel to the creek for several kilometres. It swerves north after an interchange with Neyagawa Boulevard, near the hamlet of Glenarchy. After diverging from the creek, it curves northeast, parallel to and north of Burnhamthorpe Road, where it interchanges with Trafalgar Road (Halton Regional Road3). Highway407 then encounters Highway403 at a large interchange where curves sharply to the northwest; Highway403, meanwhile, curves from the southeast to the northeast.|$|E
5|$|Economic {{development}} in Sitakunda is largely {{driven by the}} Dhaka-Chittagong Highway and the railway. Though Sitakunda is predominantly an <b>agricultural</b> <b>area,</b> {{it also has the}} largest ship breaking industry in the world. The industry has been accused of neglecting workers' rights, especially concerning work safety practices and child labor. It has also been accused of harming the environment, particularly by causing soil contamination. Sitakunda's ecosystems are further threatened by deforestation, over-fishing, and groundwater contamination. The upazila is also susceptible to natural hazards such as earthquakes, cyclones, and storm surges. It lies {{on one of the most}} active seismic faults in Bangladesh, the Sitakunda–Teknaf fault.|$|E

5|$|The {{northern}} half of Belgium, {{which would}} {{come to be known}} as Flanders, was a largely <b>agricultural</b> <b>area</b> containing the important port of Antwerp, the city of Ghent and the capital, Brussels. In the southern half, which {{would come to}} be known as Wallonia, a number of smaller towns and cities along the valley of the Sambre and Meuse rivers – the sillon industriel ("industrial valley") – became the focus of industrialization. In the west of the valley, around Charleroi, was the Pays Noir ("Black Country"), which held significant coal deposits. In southeast Belgium, along the border with Luxembourg and Prussia (later Germany), was the heavily forested and agricultural region known as the Ardennes.|$|E
5|$|Excluding Kingston upon Hull {{there are}} several areas of {{settlement}} in the East Riding, each giving rise to distinctive types of small to medium-sized towns and villages. Cottingham and Willerby are exceptional {{in that they are}} suburban villages which are almost contiguous with the Hull urban area. Bridlington is the most populous of the coastal settlements, which also include Flamborough, Hornsea, Withernsea and Aldbrough. Towns and villages on the flat <b>agricultural</b> <b>area</b> of Holderness are Hedon and Roos, and nestling in the Great Wold Valley is Rudston. Along the eastern foot of the Wolds lie Beverley, Bishop Burton, Driffield and Lockington. In the low-lying lands close to the Humber Estuary are Goole, Brough, North Ferriby, Hessle and Kirk Ella. Stamford Bridge, Pocklington, Market Weighton, Holme-on-Spalding-Moor, Howden and South Cave all lie to the north and west of the area, between the River Derwent and the scarp slope of the Wolds.|$|E
40|$|By using {{cross-sectional}} data from Ethiopia, Kenya, and Uganda, this article estimates {{the determinants of}} the participation in local nonfarm activities and migration {{at the individual level}} and then estimates the determinants of farm and nonfarm income. The results indicate that schooling and local language ability increase participation in local nonfarm activities and migration. Schooling also is found to increase nonfarm income at the household level but not farm income. We also find that farm household members from low-potential <b>agricultural</b> <b>areas</b> are more likely to participate in local nonfarm activities and migration than those from high-potential <b>agricultural</b> <b>areas.</b> Thus, the results suggest that local nonfarm activities and migration offer employment opportunities for workers from low-potential <b>agricultural</b> <b>areas.</b> Indeed, the nonfarm activities and migration is likely to provide an important pathway to reduce poverty in low-potential <b>agricultural</b> <b>areas</b> in East Africa.

5|$|Attention {{to water}} quality was focused in South Florida in 1986 when a {{widespread}} algal bloom occurred in one-fifth of Lake Okeechobee. The bloom was discovered {{to be the}} result of fertilizers from the Everglades <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Area.</b> Although laws stated in 1979 that the chemicals used in the EAA should not be deposited into the lake, they were flushed into the canals that fed the Everglades Water Conservation Areas, and eventually pumped into the lake. Microbiologists discovered that, although phosphorus assists plant growth, it destroys periphyton, one of the basic building blocks of marl in the Everglades. Marl is one of two types of Everglades soil, along with peat; it is found where parts of the Everglades are flooded for shorter periods of time as layers of periphyton dry. Most of the phosphorus compounds also rid peat of dissolved oxygen and promote algae growth, causing native invertebrates to die, and sawgrass to be replaced with invasive cattails that grow too tall and thick for birds and alligators to nest in. Tested water showed 500parts per billion (ppb) of phosphorus near sugarcane fields. State legislation in 1987 mandated a 40% reduction of phosphorus by 1992.|$|E
5|$|US 22 enters New Jersey from Easton, Pennsylvania on the Easton-Phillipsburg Toll Bridge {{over the}} Delaware River. It heads into Phillipsburg, Warren County as a four-lane {{undivided}} road {{maintained by the}} Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission, eventually becoming a divided highway. East of the bridge, the westbound lanes pass through the bridge toll plaza, and the route has an eastbound exit and westbound entrance for Broad and Main Streets. From the previous exit, US 22 runs eastward as a brief limited-access road maintained by the New Jersey Department of Transportation that ends in an interchange with Morris Street and Hillcrest Boulevard. At this point, the route becomes at-grade Memorial Boulevard; a commercial four to six-lane divided thoroughfare with a wide median consisting of U-turn ramps and jughandles. The median narrows as the road forms the border between Lopatcong Township {{to the north and}} Phillipsburg to the south. The route fully enters Lopatcong Township and comes to an interchange with Route 57, with an eastbound exit and a westbound entrance. After passing the Route 57 junction, US 22 takes a southeasterly turn and passes over Norfolk Southern's Washington Secondary before entering an <b>agricultural</b> <b>area.</b> The route forms the border between Pohatcong Township to the west and Greenwich Township to the east as it passes to the east of the Phillipsburg Mall. A short distance later, US 22 intersects CR 519 before heading back into a business district and meeting CR 638. East of Alpha, the route intersects Route 122, which is the final junction of the at-grade section of US 22.|$|E
