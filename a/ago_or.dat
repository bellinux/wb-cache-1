5|$|It {{was mostly}} undisputed that pre-human australopithecines {{did not have}} {{communication}} systems significantly different from those found in great apes in general. However, a 2017 study on Ardipithecus ramidus challenges this belief. Scholarly opinions vary as to the developments since {{the appearance of the}} genus Homo some 2.5 million years ago. Some scholars assume the development of primitive language-like systems (proto-language) as early as Homo habilis (2.3 million years ago) while others place the development of primitive symbolic communication only with Homo erectus (1.8 million years <b>ago)</b> <b>or</b> Homo heidelbergensis (0.6 million years ago), and the development of language proper with Anatomically Modern Homo sapiens with the Upper Paleolithic revolution less than 100,000 years ago.|$|E

40|$|Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) guide {{distinct}} {{classes of}} RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISCs) to repress mRNA expression in biological processes ranging from development to antiviral defense. In Drosophila, separate but conceptually similar endonucleolytic pathways produce siRNAs and miRNAs. Here, {{we show that}} despite their distinct biogenesis, double-stranded miRNAs and siRNAs participate in a common sorting step that partitions them into <b>Ago</b> 1 - <b>or</b> <b>Ago</b> 2 -containing effector complexes. These distinct complexes silence their target RNAs by different mechanisms. miRNA-loaded Ago 2 -RISC mediates RNAi, but only Ago 1 is able to repress an mRNA with central mismatches in its miRNA-binding sites. Conversely, Ago 1 cannot mediate RNAi, {{because it is an}} inefficient nuclease whose catalytic rate is limited by the dissociation of its reaction products. Thus, the two members of the Drosophila Ago subclade of Argonaute proteins are functionally specialized, but specific small RNA classes are not restricted to associate with <b>Ago</b> 1 <b>or</b> <b>Ago</b> 2...|$|R

5|$|The Indian and Javan rhinoceros, {{the only}} {{members of the}} genus Rhinoceros, first appear in the fossil record in Asia around 1.6 million–3.3 million years ago. Molecular estimates, however, suggest the two species diverged from each other much earlier, around 11.7 million years ago. Although {{belonging}} to the type genus, the Indian and Javan rhinoceroses are not believed to be closely related to other rhino species. Different studies have hypothesized {{that they may be}} closely related to the extinct Gaindatherium or Punjabitherium. A detailed cladistic analysis of the Rhinocerotidae placed Rhinoceros and the extinct Punjabitherium in a clade with Dicerorhinus, the Sumatran rhino.

40|$|Double-stranded RNAs {{that are}} {{complementary}} to non-coding transcripts at gene promoters can activate or inhibit gene expression in mammalian cells. Understanding the mechanism for modulating gene expression by promoter-targeted antigene RNAs (agRNAs) will require {{identification of the}} proteins involved in recognition. Previous reports have implicated argonaute (AGO) proteins, but identifications have differed with involvement of AGO 1, <b>AGO</b> 2, <b>or</b> both <b>AGO</b> 1 and AGO 2 being reported by different studies. The roles of AGO 3 and AGO 4 have not been investigated. Here, we examine the role of AGO 1 – 4 in gene silencing and activation of the progesterone receptor (PR) gene. Expression of AGO 2 is necessary for efficient gene silencing <b>or</b> activation and <b>AGO</b> 2 is recruited to the non-coding transcript that overlaps the promoter during both gene silencing and activation. Expression of AGO 1, AGO 3 and AGO 4 are not necessary for gene silencing or activation nor are AGO 1, <b>AGO</b> 3, <b>or</b> <b>AGO</b> 4 recruited to the target non-coding transcript during gene activation.

40|$|Argonaute (Ago) 2 is the {{catalytic}} {{engine of}} mammalian RNA interference, but {{little is known}} concerning the regulation of Ago 2 by cell-signaling pathways. In this study we show that expres-sion of Ago 2, but not Ago 1, <b>Ago</b> 3, <b>or</b> <b>Ago</b> 4, is elevated in estrogen receptor (ER) -negative (ER) vs. ER-positive (ER) breast cancer cell lines, and in ER breast tumors. In MCF- 7 cells {{the low level of}} Ago 2 was found to be dependent upon active ER/estrogen signaling. Interestingly, the high expression of Ago 2 in ER cells was severely blunted by inhibition of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor/MAPK signaling pathway, using either a pharmacological MAPK kinase in-hibitor, U 0126, or a small interfering RNA directed against EGF receptor. Half-life studies using cycloheximide indicated that EGF enhanced, whereas U 0126 decreased, Ago 2 protein stability. Furthermore, a proteosome inhibitor, MG 132, blocked Ago 2 protein turnover. The functional consequences of elevated Ago 2 levels were examined by stable transfection of ERMCF- 7 cells with full-length and truncated forms of Ago 2. The full-length Ago 2 transfectants displayed en-hanced proliferation, reduced cell-cell adhesion, and increased migratory ability, as shown by proliferation, homotypic aggregation, and wound healing assays, respectively.

25|$|It is more {{difficult}} to establish the origin of language; it is unclear whether Homo erectus could speak or if that capability had not begun until Homo sapiens. As brain size increased, babies were born earlier, before their heads grew too large to pass through the pelvis.

Social skills became more complex, language became more sophisticated, and tools became more elaborate. This contributed to further cooperation and intellectual development.
