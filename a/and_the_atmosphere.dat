5|$|Manganese {{comprises}} about 1000ppm(0.1%) of the Earth's crust, the 12th {{most abundant}} of the crust's elements. Soil contains 7–9000ppm of manganese {{with an average}} of 440ppm.

5|$|El Hatillo, at {{a higher}} {{altitude}} than the neighboring municipalities of Caracas, has slightly cooler weather than nearby downtown Caracas.

The mean precipitation is 997.3millimeters a year (39inches); annual values can range from 800 to 1,500millimeters (32in to 59in). The average humidity index is 75%; similar {{to the rest of}} Venezuela, the rainy season is May through November, while all other months are considered the dry season.

30|$|In this paper, {{as shown}} in Fig.  2, we found a {{relationship}} between EPBs <b>and</b> <b>the</b> lower <b>atmosphere,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> relationship was much clearer {{at an altitude of}} 40  km. <b>The</b> enhanced temperature <b>and</b> wind velocity fluctuations in Fig.  5 well exceed the standard deviation for each data point. We believe that the present study has found clearer evidence of a relationship between EPB activity <b>and</b> <b>the</b> lower <b>atmosphere</b> than any of the research results described above. We suggest that the relationship between <b>the</b> EPB signal <b>and</b> <b>the</b> lower <b>atmosphere</b> is complicated and requires an appropriate analysis technique to elucidate it. Further research is also necessary to improve the detection of this complicated link between <b>the</b> EPB activity <b>and</b> <b>the</b> lower <b>atmosphere.</b>|$|R

5|$|In 1956 Kim started Kim Ki-young Productions, {{and began}} making melodramas, {{the most popular}} film genre in South Korea at the time. His first {{independent}} production was Touch-Me-Not (1956). In 1957, Kim was living near the red-light district of Yongsan, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere</b> of this neighborhood influenced his films, A Woman's War and Twilight Train (both 1957). With First Snow (1958), Kim moved from melodrama to a more socially conscious realism. Defiance of a Teenager (1959) and Sad Pastorale (1960) followed in this style. Defiance of a Teenager was one of Kim's most successful and respected early works, and he attended the San Francisco International Film Festival in 1960 for a showing of this film.|$|E

She is taken to clinical social worker Catherine Black (Megan Gallagher), and admits that her father has been sexually abusing her for years.|$|E
5|$|Composer Yoshihiro Ike infused {{the music}} with the sorrow {{borne by the}} karas, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere</b> {{conveyed}} by the background. Ike obliged the team's request for Japanese flavored music, and studied kabuki tunes accompanying actors as they strike their , a picturesque pose to establish their character. He planned to use taikos (Japanese drums) to further enhance the music, but felt the show had taken on an international outlook and discarded the notion. He wanted his music to match {{the quality of the}} show, and refrained from composing them until he had watched the pre-dubbed version of the first episode. He composed most of his music as he watched the pre-dubbed episodes to synchronize their tempo and dynamics with the action in the show. He chose Prague Symphony Orchestra to perform the main theme because he felt the background of their city and its people suited the character of Karas. Other departments also took extraordinary measures in producing the show. The sound crew procured a Nissan Skyline GT-R and recorded its engine noise for several runs. These were used for the tunnel chase scenes which involved a hand-drawn 1972–77 Skyline. The editing team took the additional step of editing cels post-voice recording to ensure lip movements were in synch with the voices. These extra work and the hybrid 2D-3D approach inflated the budget of the production to three times the usual amount spent on an original video animation.|$|E

5|$|Hitler {{moved into}} the Führerbunker on 16 January 1945. He was joined by his senior staff, {{including}} Martin Bormann. In April 1945, Eva Braun and Joseph Goebbels {{moved into the}} Führerbunker while Magda Goebbels and their six children took residence in the upper Vorbunker. Two or three dozen support, medical, and administrative staff were also sheltered there. These included Hitler's secretaries (including Traudl Junge), a nurse named Erna Flegel, and telephone switchboard operator Sergeant Rochus Misch. Early on, Hitler continued to utilize the undamaged wing of the Reich Chancellery, where he held afternoon military conferences in his large study. Afterwards, he would have tea with his secretaries before going {{back down into the}} bunker complex for the night. After several weeks of this routine, Hitler seldom left the bunker except for short strolls in the chancellery garden with his dog Blondi. The bunker was crowded <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere</b> was oppressive; air raids occurred daily. Hitler mostly stayed on the lower level, where it was quieter and he could sleep. Conferences took place for much of the night, often until 05:00.|$|E
