5|$|Two {{other works}} were pivotal in framing {{the image of}} buyout firms. Barbarians at the Gate, the 1990 best seller about the fight over RJR Nabisco linked private equity to hostile takeovers and assaults on management. <b>A</b> <b>blistering</b> story {{on the front page}} of the Wall Street Journal the same year about KKR's buyout of the Safeway {{supermarket}} chain painted a much more damaging picture. The piece, which later won a Pulitzer Prize, began with the suicide of a Safeway worker in Texas who had been laid off and went on to chronicle how KKR had sold off hundreds of stores after the buyout and slashed jobs.|$|E
5|$|In the 1959 gubernatorial primary, Chandler {{threw his}} support to Lieutenant Governor Harry Lee Waterfield. The anti-Chandler forces {{eventually}} put forth Bert Combs as their nominee again. Having {{learned from his}} previous campaign, Combs now attacked Chandler for allegedly requiring state employees to donate 2% of their salaries to his campaign. According to Combs, Chandler had deposited the money in a Cuban bank, but the money was lost when Fidel Castro overthrew {{the government in the}} Cuban Revolution. Ultimately, Combs prevailed in the primary by a vote of 292,462 to 259,461. Republicans nominated John M. Robsion, Jr. to oppose Combs, and when Democratic President Harry S. Truman came to Paducah to campaign for Combs, Chandler refused to welcome him to the state, a customary duty of the sitting governor. Instead, in a letter to Truman, Chandler launched <b>a</b> <b>blistering</b> attack on his party's nominees, calling Combs a liar and alleging that his running mate, Wilson W. Wyatt, who had previously served in Truman's administration, had actually tried to undermine Truman by helping found Americans for Democratic Action. Combs ultimately won the general election by a wide margin.|$|E

50|$|Transient textural {{changes are}} {{occasionally}} noted but often resolve {{within a few}} months; however, permanent textural changes and scarring very rarely occur.
