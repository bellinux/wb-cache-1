5|$|The CECAFA Cup is {{considered}} Africa's oldest football tournament, and involves teams from Central and Southern Africa. The matches in the 1973 tournament were played from 22 September 1973 until 29 September 1973.

In 1967, this became the East and Central African Senior Challenge Cup, often shortened to simply the Challenge Cup, which was competed for five years, until 1971, before the CECAFA Cup was introduced in 1973. Ethiopia were the defending champions, having won the 2005 tournament in Rwanda, after finishing second in their group, and going on to beat Zanzibar <b>and</b> <b>Rwanda</b> in the final.

After the First World War and Germany's defeat, it ceded the territory to Belgium. Both Germans and Belgians ruled Burundi <b>and</b> <b>Rwanda</b> as a European colony known as Ruanda-Urundi.
