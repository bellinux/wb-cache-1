50|$|Period costs, such as office {{salaries}} {{or selling}} expenses, are immediately recognized as expenses (and offset against revenues {{of the accounting}} period) also when employees are paid in the next period. Unpaid period costs are <b>accrued</b> <b>expenses</b> (liabilities) to avoid such costs (as expenses fictitiously incurred) to offset period revenues {{that would result in}} a fictitious profit. An example is a commission earned at the moment of sale (or delivery) by a sales representative who is compensated {{at the end of the}} following week, in the next accounting period. The company recognizes the commission as an expense incurred immediately in its current income statement to match the sale proceeds (revenue), so the commission is also added to <b>accrued</b> <b>expenses</b> in the sale period to prevent it from otherwise becoming a fictitious profit, and it is deducted from <b>accrued</b> <b>expenses</b> in the next period to prevent it from otherwise becoming a fictitious loss, when the rep is compensated.|$|E

Without such <b>accrued</b> <b>expense,</b> a sale of such goods in the period they were supplied would cause that the unpaid inventory (recognized as an expense fictitiously incurred) would effectively offset the sale proceeds (revenue) resulting in a fictitious profit in the period of sale, and in a fictitious loss in the latter period of payment, both equal to the cost of goods sold.|$|R

40|$|This study aims {{to examine}} the effect of {{deferred}} tax assets and liabilities for future current tax over a two-year period (t+ 1, t+ 2). Deferred tax assets and liabilities arising from timing differences in the recognition of revenues and expenses based on financial accounting standards and tax laws. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are recognized in the financial statements because it can lead to future tax payments to be larger or smaller. Sample of this study consists of 38 companies from manufacturing sectors listed on Indonesia Stock Exchange in 2011 - 2014.
