So, higher the ionic strength the shorter are electrostatic interactions between charged entities.

They also make weak bonds with the surfactant molecules at the interface and hold them longer there when the interface is compressed.

Therefore, the surface tension varies according to the volume of air in the lungs, which protects them from atelectasis at low volumes and tissue damage at high volume levels.|$|E

The experiments were conducted using batch technique at 308 K and pH 4. The adsorption of Pb (II) ions in aqueous solution on clay has been studied as function of pH, concentration, time and temperature. Its efficiency increased with increasing of pH (from 2 to 8), Pb (II) ions in aqueous solution (pH higher 3), contact time of equilibration and temperature.

5000|$|A {{detailed}} comparison among PEI {{and other}} amino-containing molecules showed an excellence performance of PEI-containing samples with cycles. Also, {{only a slight}} decrease was registered in their CO2 uptake when increasing the temperature from 25 to 100°C, demonstrating a high contribution of chemisorption to the adsorption capacity of these solids. For the same reason, the adsorption capacity under diluted CO2 was up to 90% of the value under pure CO2 and also, a high unwanted selectivity towards SO2 was observed. Lately, many efforts {{have been made in}} order to improve PEI diffusion within the porous structure of the support used. A better dispersion of PEI and a higher CO2 efficiency (CO2/NH molar ratio) were achieved by impregnating a template-occluded PE-MCM-41 material rather than perfect cylindrical pores of a calcined material, following a previously described route. The combined use of organosilanes such as aminopropyl-trimethoxysilane, AP, and PEI has also been studied. The first approach used a combination of them to impregnate porous supports, achieving faster CO2-adsorption kinetics and higher stability during reutilization cycles, but no higher efficiencies. A novel method is the so-called [...] "double-functionalization". It is based on the impregnation of materials previously functionalized by grafting (covalent bonding of organosilanes). Amino groups incorporated by both paths have shown synergic effects, achieving high CO2 uptakes up to 235 mg CO2/g (5.34 mmol CO2/g). CO2 <b>adsorption</b> <b>kinetics</b> were also studied for these materials, showing similar adsorption rates than impregnated solids. This is an interesting finding, taking into account the smaller pore volume available in double-functionalized materials. Thus, it can be also concluded that their higher CO2 uptake and efficiency compared to impregnated solids can be ascribed to a synergic effect of the amino groups incorporated by two methods (grafting and impregnation) rather than to a faster <b>adsorption</b> <b>kinetics.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Recently, {{polyelectrolytes}} {{have been}} utilized {{in the formation}} of new types of materials known as polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEMs). These thin films are constructed using a layer-by-layer (LbL) deposition technique. During LbL deposition, a suitable growth substrate (usually charged) is dipped back and forth between dilute baths of positively and negatively charged polyelectrolyte solutions. During each dip a small amount of polyelectrolyte is adsorbed and the surface charge is reversed, allowing the gradual and controlled build-up of electrostatically cross-linked films of polycation-polyanion layers. Scientists have demonstrated thickness control of such films down to the single-nanometer scale. LbL films can also be constructed by substituting charged species such as nanoparticles or clay platelets in place of or in addition to one of the polyelectrolytes. LbL deposition has also been accomplished using hydrogen bonding instead of electrostatics. For more information on multilayer creation please see polyelectrolyte adsorption.

50|$|The {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} investigate the sorption of arsenic from the groundwater onto kimberlite tailings in two phases - batch studies and column studies. In batch studies, the effects of different factors such as pH, adsorbent dose and adsorbent size {{on the performance of}} kimberlite tailings were investigated. <b>Adsorption</b> <b>kinetics</b> and equilibrium isotherm studies were also carried out. The adsorption capacity of kimberlite tailings was calculated as 0.25 mg/g of adsorbent. In column studies, the performance of fixed-bed kimberlite tailings was studied and the adsorption capacity was found to be 0.27 mg/g of adsorbent. Film diffusion was found to be the rate-limiting factor for the removal of arsenic by kimberlite tailings. Adsorption of arsenic was found to be pH dependent and higher removal efficiencies were observed near neutral pH range. The arsenic uptake increased with increase in adsorbent dose. Spent kimberlite tailings could be regenerated with dilute NaOH. The proposed treatment methodology was applied to the groundwater samples collected from various places of North 24-Parganas district situated in West Bengal, India. The samples were analyzed for the presence of total arsenic. The arsenic contamination of groundwater was found to be location specific in North 24-Parganas district. The maximum arsenic concentration at certain places was found to be many folds more than the WHO recommended limits. The treatment of arsenic contaminated water samples with kimberlite tailings showed 90-94% removal in 12 hours.
