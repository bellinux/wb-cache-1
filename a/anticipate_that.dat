5|$|With Perreault's success, Microsoft {{announced}} the Xbox backwards compatibility on the Xbox One in June 2017. Thrirteen titles were initially released on October 24, 2017, with more to come. However, Microsoft does not <b>anticipate</b> <b>that</b> {{there will be}} as many Xbox titles brought to the program as with the Xbox 360, primarily due to legal issues related to intellectual property, contracts, and companies that have since gone defunct.|$|E
5|$|MRO has two {{rechargeable}} nickel-hydrogen batteries used {{to power}} the spacecraft {{when it is not}} facing the Sun. Each battery has an energy storage capacity of 50ampere-hours (180kC). The full range of the batteries cannot be used due to voltage constraints on the spacecraft, but allows the operators to extend the battery life—a valuable capability, given that battery drain {{is one of the most}} common causes of long-term satellite failure. Planners <b>anticipate</b> <b>that</b> only 40% of the batteries' capacities will be required during the lifetime of the spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|The attacks caught UN {{planners}} and troops by surprise. By August 26, the UN troops {{thought they had}} destroyed the last serious threats to the perimeter, and anticipated the war ending by late November. ROK units, in the meantime, suffered from low morale {{as a result of}} their failures to defend effectively thus far in the conflict, and a cautious US Eighth Army commander Lieutenant General Walton Walker ordered Major General John B. Coulter to the P'ohang-dong area to shore up the ROK I Corps, which was falling apart due to low morale. UN troops were preparing for Operation Chromite, an amphibious assault on the port of Inchon on September 15, and did not <b>anticipate</b> <b>that</b> the North Koreans would mount a serious offensive before then.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{uncertainties}} {{about how}} the region's subtropical ridge would interact with Irene, the models continued to give unclear signals of the storm's future. Some of the models predicted that Irene would make landfall in North Carolina, while others continued to <b>anticipate</b> <b>that</b> Irene would dissipate. The uncertainty ended when a weakness in the subtropical ridge allowed Irene to turn sharply northward, which caused the storm to pass midway between the Outer Banks of North Carolina and Bermuda on August 15. Soon after, upper-level shear weakened greatly, and Irene rapidly intensified, first to a hurricane, then to its peak strength as a 105mph (170km/h) Category 2 hurricane {{on the afternoon of}} August 16, while located 350miles (560km) northeast of Bermuda; {{at the same time it}} also attained minimum pressure of 970mbar. Though NHC meteorologists thought it was likely that Irene would become a hurricane, they were not expecting an intensification of such a magnitude.|$|E
25|$|In Season 3, Blizzard used a skill ranking {{calculation}} at {{the onset}} of the season that decreased the player's Season 2 skill ranking to better sort players into the initial tiers, keep relative player skill in each tier consistent at the start of the season, and prevent rapid drops of a player's skill at the season's onset; they had found that their algorithms placed too many players in the Gold and Platinum tiers at the start of Season 2, creating imbalanced matchmaking and rapid declines of player rankings, and <b>anticipate</b> <b>that</b> this chance will better spread out players over tiers and improve matchmaking.|$|E
25|$|The {{opening of}} the Russian Northern Sea Route and the Canadian Northwest Passage to {{commercial}} traffic could pose {{an alternative to the}} canal in the long term. Warmer waters in the Arctic Ocean could open the passage for an increasing number of months each year, making it more attractive as a major shipping route. However, the passage through the Arctic would require significant investment in escort vessels and staging ports. The Canadian commercial marine transport industry does not <b>anticipate</b> <b>that</b> this route will be a viable alternative to the Panama Canal within the next 10 to 20 years.|$|E

25|$|The Allied plans {{anticipated}} that Tarakan would be secured quickly. It {{was expected that}} the operation would involve a short fight for the airfield followed by a 'consolidation' phase during which the island's airfield and port would be developed to support Allied operations. The planners did not foresee significant fighting in Tarakan's interior, and no plans were developed for operations in areas other than the landing beaches, Tarakan Town and airfield. The planners did, however, correctly <b>anticipate</b> <b>that</b> the Japanese would make their main stand in an area other than the invasion beach {{and would not be}} capable of mounting a large counterattack.|$|E

25|$|However, few {{initially}} foresaw {{the extent}} of the influence of containerization on the shipping industry. In the 1950s, Harvard University economist Benjamin Chinitz predicted that containerization would benefit New York by allowing it to ship its industrial goods more cheaply to the Southern United States than other areas, but he did not <b>anticipate</b> <b>that</b> containerization might make it cheaper to import such goods from abroad. Most economic studies of containerization merely assumed that shipping companies would begin to replace older forms of transportation with containerization, but did not predict that the process of containerization itself would have a more direct influence on the choice of producers and increase the total volume of trade.|$|E

25|$|Although {{there is}} no way to {{guarantee}} that a reactor will always be designed, built and operated safely, the nuclear power industry has improved the safety and performance of reactors, and has proposed safer reactor designs, though many of these designs have yet to be tested at industrial or commercial scales.

25|$|Chief Justice Roberts {{feared the}} Court's ruling {{would limit the}} ability of police to combat {{domestic}} violence.

In short, to share a home with someone is to surrender privacy as to that person, who might then consent to an invasion of it. Roberts also asserted that the majority opinion was arbitrary, as previous case law had held an objecting resident who was being held in the police car, as opposed to in the house, could be ignored with respect to the search.|$|E

With U2 only able to invest $30,000, Fey agreed to help finance the project, along with Island Records. A joint production company called [...] "U2 at Red Rocks Associates" [...] was subsequently established to fund the filming; the three parties split costs and shared profits from television rights and video sales. The radio rights were sold to American radio network NBC for inclusion in their concert series The Source.

500|$|No {{other aspect}} of Mallory's tenure as Secretary of the Navy is better known than his {{advocacy}} of armored vessels. He argued that the Confederacy could never produce enough ships {{to compete with the}} industrial Union on a ship-by-ship basis. As he saw it, the South should build a few ships that were individually so far superior to their opponents as to dominate. In his words, [...] "The perfection of a warship would doubtless be a combination of the greatest known ocean speed with the greatest known floating battery and power of resistance." [...] He hoped that armored warships would prove to be the [...] "ultimate weapon." [...] He did not <b>anticipate</b> <b>that</b> his opponents would also produce armored vessels, which rapidly became important parts of both navies. Furthermore, other navies, notably Great Britain and France, stepped up the conversions of their own fleets from wood to iron. Certainly the change was under way even before the Civil War broke out; his legacy consists in forcing the change to be made sooner than would otherwise have been done.|$|E
