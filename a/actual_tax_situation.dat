40|$|Corporate tax related {{empirical}} research often uses effective tax rates to investigate cross- sectional {{differences in the}} tax attributes of companies. Effective tax rates are often defined as (current or total) tax expense over financial accounting income before taxes, where the (current or total) tax expense is {{an estimate of the}} <b>actual</b> <b>taxes</b> paid. This approximation of the <b>actual</b> <b>tax</b> payment by using tax expense is often used, as the <b>actual</b> <b>tax</b> payment and taxable income were or are proprietary information, thereby rendering it difficult if not impossible to use this information to calculate effective tax rates. Due to changes in financial accounting standards more information on the <b>actual</b> <b>tax</b> payment and taxable income is now generally available in US financial statements. This paper argues that the use of an effective tax rate measure utilizing tax expenses has some inherent dangers which are to a lesser extent the case in an effective <b>tax</b> rate using <b>actual</b> <b>taxes</b> paid. Two inherent dangers of a tax expense based ETR measure are the quality of the tax expense measure as an estimation of the <b>actual</b> <b>taxes</b> paid and timing differences between <b>tax</b> expense and <b>actual</b> <b>taxes</b> paid. The differences between <b>tax</b> expenses and <b>actual</b> <b>taxes</b> paid ETRs are researched in an empirical study as well as other proposed ETR measures. Results from this empirical study indicate that in certain situations it is more appropriate to use an effective tax rate measure based on <b>actual</b> <b>taxes</b> paid rather than on tax expenses. ...|$|R
40|$|Using {{information}} {{collected from the}} Swedish tax authorities, we calculate insiders’ <b>actual</b> effective <b>tax</b> rates on dividends. With this unique dataset, we find a significant negative cross-sectional relationship between insiders’ effective tax rates and dividend payout. This result {{is consistent with a}} tax-induced clientele effect for dividends. We also look at the impact of large block trades on dividends. We find that when insiders with zero effective taxes sell blocks, subsequent dividend payments are significantly more likely to decrease. This provides evidence that large shareholders are adjusting dividends for their individual <b>tax</b> <b>situations.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|The <b>actual</b> <b>tax</b> reform 2000 / 2005 {{and their}} {{alternative}} proposals are {{prominent in the}} actual economic and social policy discussion. The question of the individual impacts to the tax payers is pronounced in the political discussion beyond traditional taxation aims to cover public expenditures and to promote a just income distribution. Alternatively to the <b>actual</b> <b>tax</b> reform 2000 / 2005 in Germany the ‘Karlsruhe proposal’ is discussed, which tries to raise the transparency and thereby the taxation acceptance by a drastical simplification of the tax law. In this study we analyse and quantify by a microsimulation approach the distributional and redistributional income impacts to important societal groups of the competitive tax systems compared to the before <b>tax</b> reform <b>situation.</b> Our micro database is a 10 % sample of the anonymised individual records of the actual available German Income Tax Statistic 1995 with ca, 3 mio. data records.

40|$|We {{study the}} tension between fiscal {{decentralization}} and progressive taxation. We present a multi-community model in which the local income tax rate is determined by an exogenous progressive tax schedule and a tax shifter that can differ across communities. The progressivity of the tax schedule induces a self-sorting process that results in substantial though imperfect income sorting. Rich households {{are more likely to}} locate themselves in low tax communities than poor households. The <b>actual</b> <b>tax</b> structure is thus less progressive than the exogenous tax schedule. To investigate the quantitative implications of our model, we calibrate a fully-specified version to the largest metropolitan area in Switzerland. The equilibrium values of the simulation show the same pattern across communities as we observe in this area. The theoretical result is challenged by estimating the <b>actual</b> <b>tax</b> structure faced by the households in this area. We find that the <b>actual</b> <b>tax</b> structure is indeed substantially less progressive than the fixed tax schedule. Progressive Taxation, Fiscal Decentralization, Income Segregation...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we apply {{conjoint}} analysis {{to study the}} influence {{of changes in the}} tax rate and the tax base on the perceived tax burden. Our results show that the majority of individuals do not make rational tax decisions based on the <b>actual</b> <b>tax</b> burden, but rather use simple decision heuristics. This leads to the importance of the tax rate being significantly overestimated and the importance of the tax base being significantly underestimated. Furthermore we determine framing effects and show that under specific assumptions, a rise in the <b>actual</b> <b>tax</b> burden can lead to a electoral success.

40|$|This paper {{questions}} the conventional {{argument that the}} existence of a black market provides negative externalities in the form of foregone tax revenues that could otherwise be used to increase social welfare. It is not enough to estimate the size of the black market, one should also show how much of this can be eradicated, and how much of what is eradicated can be replaced by legitimate (taxable) goods, and how much of what is replaced can generate <b>actual</b> <b>tax</b> revenue. When all these are taken into account, the <b>actual</b> <b>tax</b> loss from piracy may be trivial. We illustrate this point using time-series data on optical media disc piracy in the Philippines.
