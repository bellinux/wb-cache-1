5|$|I {{should say}} I {{wanted to write}} poetry in the {{beginning}} because I {{had fallen in love}} with words. The first poems I knew were nursery rhymes <b>and</b> <b>before</b> <b>I</b> could read them for myself I had come to love the words of them. The words alone. What the words stood for was of a very secondary importance... I fell in love, that is the only expression I can think of, at once, and am still at the mercy of words, though sometimes now, knowing a little of their behaviour very well, I think I can influence them slightly and have even learned to beat them now and then, which they appear to enjoy. I tumbled for words at once. And, when I began to read the nursery rhymes for myself, and, later, to read other verses and ballads, I knew that I had discovered the most important things, to me, that could be ever.|$|E
5|$|Samantha Albert participated on Jamaica's behalf at the Beijing Olympics in an {{individual}} mixed three-day equestrian event. She was the only Jamaican participating in equestrian sports at the 2008 Olympics. Born in Montréal, Canada, Albert married Swedish equestrian Olympian Dag Albert and participated in the Beijing Olympics at age 37. At the Olympics, Albert participated first in the August 9 dressage round, which included 70 athletes in total. Out of a maximum possible score of 270, Albert and her horse Before I Do It scored 168 points on their first jump (62.22%), 171 points on their second jump (63.33%), and 167 points on their third jump (61.85%), taking 56.3 penalty points in the process. Overall, Albert <b>and</b> <b>Before</b> <b>I</b> Do It ranked 52nd of the 69 finishing riders, placing between France's Jean Renaud Adde (53rd place on horse Haston D'Elpegere) and Brazil's Jeferson Moreira (51st place on horse Escudeiro).|$|E
500|$|As death succeeded death, Dickinson {{found her}} world upended. In {{the fall of}} 1884, she wrote that [...] "The Dyings have been too deep for me, <b>and</b> <b>before</b> <b>I</b> could raise my Heart from one, another has come." [...] That summer she had seen [...] "a great {{darkness}} coming" [...] and fainted while baking in the kitchen. She remained unconscious {{late into the night}} and weeks of ill health followed. On November 30, 1885, her feebleness and other symptoms were so worrying that Austin canceled a trip to Boston. She was confined to her bed for a few months, but managed to send a final burst of letters in the spring. What is thought to be her last letter was sent to her cousins, Louise and Frances Norcross, and simply read: [...] "Little Cousins, Called Back. Emily". On May 15, 1886, after several days of worsening symptoms, Emily Dickinson {{died at the age of}} 55. Austin wrote in his diary that [...] "the day was awful ... she ceased to breathe that terrible breathing just before the [...] whistle sounded for six." [...] Dickinson's chief physician gave the cause of death as Bright's disease and its duration as two and a half years.|$|E

2500|$|In his 1957 memoir The London Cage, Scotland wrote, [...] "Perhaps because I had {{a variety}} of uncles, aunts and other {{relatives}} living abroad, my mind was focussed {{from an early age}} on the notion of a career overseas, <b>and</b> <b>before</b> <b>I</b> was twenty this compulsive travel urge was again asserting itself." ...|$|E

[...] "I did not see him approaching, <b>and</b> <b>before</b> <b>I</b> know it I was in this tight grip," [...] Friedman told CBS News in 2012.|$|E
2500|$|In an interview, Timbaland {{stated that}} he has worked with 50 Cent, {{but he did not}} know which albums (Curtis <b>and</b> <b>Before</b> <b>I</b> Self Destruct) the collaborations would end up on. This song was {{released}} on May 18, 2010 for internet download and is titled [...] "You Should Be Dead". This song gained popularity and is a constant source of debate as to why it was not featured on the album. The Koalition website stated [...] "It truly is amazing how 50 Cent’s leftover tracks are better than most rapper’s singles. A perfect example of this is You Should Be Dead".|$|E

2500|$|In March 2009, M.C. Hammer and Vanilla Ice had a one-off {{concert in}} the McKay Events Center, Orem, Utah. This concert aided in the {{promotion}} of Hammer's new music and television show. During the concert (as shown during an episode of Hammertime), it was mentioned between the two rappers that this was their first headline show together in nearly 20 years, since {{the time when they}} were touring together at the peak of their hip-hop careers. Hammer said: [...] "Contrary to popular belief, Ice and I are not only cool with each other, we are like long lost friends. I've known him since he was 16, before he had a record contract <b>and</b> <b>before</b> <b>I</b> had a record contract. It is a great reunion." [...] Vanilla Ice, real name Robert Van Winkle, said: [...] "It's like no time has passed at all. We set the world on fire back in the day - it gives me goose bumps to think about. The concert wouldn't have been so packed if it wasn't us together. I'm so happy right now, the magic is here." ...|$|E
2500|$|One notable {{unfavorable}} opinion {{appeared in}} the Daily Mail. In the piece, the plot of The Fault in Our Stars was described as [...] "mawkish at best, exploitative at worst" [...] and the book was characterized as belonging to the [...] "sick-lit" [...] young adult genre, together with other young-adult novels such as Never Eighteen <b>and</b> <b>Before</b> <b>I</b> Die. This entire genre, {{as well as the}} genre of young-adult novels dealing with suicide and self-harm (the piece mentions Thirteen Reasons Why, By the Time You Read This, I'll Be Dead, [...] The Lovely Bones, and Red Tears) was criticized as being [...] "distasteful" [...] and inappropriate for their target audience of teens. The Guardian criticized the piece, pointing out in particular that The Fault in Our Stars was chosen by The Guardian as that month's [...] "teen book club choice" [...] because [...] "it's a gripping read, featuring two compelling characters, that deals sensitively and even humorously with a difficult situation without descending into mawkishness." [...] In general, The Guardian faulted the Daily Mail for suggesting that the issues of illness, depression, and sexuality are inappropriate precisely [...] "in the one place where difficult subjects have traditionally been most sensitively explored for teens: fiction written specifically for them." [...] For his part, in an interview for The Guardian, John Green said: [...] "The thing that bothered me about The Daily Mail piece was that it was a bit condescending to teenagers. I'm tired of adults telling teenagers that they aren't smart, that they can't read critically, that they aren't thoughtful, and I feel like that article made those arguments." ...|$|E
