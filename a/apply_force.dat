However, in this study the probabilities used to make this claim are {{based on the assumption that}} the position of each tooth was independent of all the others. This is probably unrealistic because there are a number of ways that the dental profile can be changed. For example, braces <b>apply</b> <b>force</b> to specific teeth, in order to shift the placement of multiple teeth.|$|E
25|$|Paracanoeist {{race in the}} {{traditional}} kayak (K) discipline and in va'a (V), which is canoe with an outrigger, that helps the canoeist to poise the boat. The contenders are divided into three classes according {{to the level of}} their disability. Participants in LTA category have functional use of their legs, trunk and arms for paddling, and they can <b>apply</b> <b>force</b> to the footboard to propel the boat. TA class paddlers have functional use of the trunk and arms, but they are unable to apply continuous and controlled force to the footboard to propel the boat due to the weakened function of their lower limbs. Canoeist who have no trunk function are classified in the A category. At the World Championships 200 metres single events were organized for both genders in both disciplines in every disability class, however, a minimum of six competing national federations for each category were required in order to be a valid championship.|$|E

2500|$|The {{ability to}} <b>apply</b> <b>force</b> {{selectively}} and flexibly {{will become increasingly}} important in maintaining the morale and will {{of the free world}} to resist aggression. As the fear of nuclear war grows, the United States and its allies must never allow themselves to get into the position where they must choose between (a) not responding to local aggression and (b) applying force in a way which our own people or our allies would consider entails undue risk of nuclear devastation. However, the United States cannot afford to preclude itself from using nuclear weapons even in a local situation, if such use[...] [...] will best advance U.S. security interests. In the last analysis, if confronted by the choice of (a) acquiescing in Communist aggression or (b) taking measures risking either general war or loss of allied support, the United States must be prepared to take these risks if necessary for its security.|$|E

6000|$|Mr. Gladstone and {{his colleagues}} went further. They {{proposed}} and obtained a demonstration off the Albanian coast on behalf of Montenegro. Each great Power sent a man-of-war, but the concert of Europe instantly became what (M4) Mr. Gladstone called a farce, for Austria and Germany made known that under no circumstances would they fire a shot. France rather less prominently took the same course. This defection, which was almost boastful {{on the part of}} Austria and Germany, convinced the British cabinet that Turkish obduracy would only be overcome by force, and the question was how to <b>apply</b> <b>force</b> effectually with the least risk to peace. As it happened, the port of Smyrna received an amount of customs’ duties too considerable for the Porte to spare it. The idea was that the united fleet at Cattaro should straightway sail to Smyrna and lay hold upon it. The cabinet, with experts from the two fighting departments, weighed carefully all the military responsibilities, and considered the sequestration of the customs’ dues at Smyrna to be practicable. Russia and Italy were friendly. France had in a certain way assumed special cognisance of the Greek case, but did nothing particular. From Austria and Germany nothing was to be hoped. On October 4, the Sultan refused the joint European request for the fulfilment of the engagements entered into at Berlin. This refusal was despatched in ignorance of the intention to coerce. The British government had only resolved upon coercion in concert with Europe. Full concert was now out of the question. But on the morning of Sunday, the 10th, Mr. Gladstone and Lord Granville learned with as much surprise as delight from Mr. Goschen, then ambassador extraordinary at Constantinople, that the Sultan had heard of the British proposal of force, and apparently had not heard of the two refusals. On learning how far England had gone, he determined to give way on both the territorial questions. As Mr. Gladstone enters in his diary, “a faint tinge of doubt remained.” That is to say, the Sultan might find out the rift in the concert and retract. Russia, however, had actually agreed to force. On Tuesday, the 12th, Mr. Gladstone, meeting Lord Granville and another colleague, was “under the circumstances prepared to proceed en trois.” The other two “rather differed.” Of course it would have been for the whole cabinet to decide. But between eleven and twelve Lord Granville came in with the news that the note had arrived and all was well. “The whole of this extraordinary volte-face,” as Mr. Gladstone said with some complacency, “had been effected within six days; and it was entirely due not to a threat of coercion from Europe, but to the knowledge that Great Britain had asked Europe to coerce.” Dulcigno was ceded by the Porte to Montenegro. On the Greek side of the case, the minister for once was less ardent than for the complete triumph of his heroic Montenegrins, but after tedious negotiations Mr. Gladstone had the satisfaction of seeing an important rectification of the Greek frontier, almost restoring his Homeric Greece. The eastern question looked as if it might fall into one of its fitful slumbers once more, but we shall soon see that this was illusory. Mr. Goschen left Constantinople in May, and the prime minister said to him (June 3, 1881):— ...|$|E

40|$|Study design: {{clinical}} measurement, cross-sectional. Objectives: {{to compare}} cervical mobilization <b>forces</b> <b>applied</b> by physiotherapists and students, and the {{factors associated with}} forces for each group. Background: cervical spine joint mobilization is a common manual technique for treating patients with mechanical neck pain. But {{little is known about}} the <b>forces</b> <b>applied</b> during this technique. Potential variability between therapists may result from clinical experience or may be due to factors present in individuals prior to clinical practice exposure. Methods: one hundred sixteen practicing physiotherapists and 120 physiotherapy students without clinical experience applied grades I through IV posteroanterior mobilization to the premarked C 2 and C 7 spinous and articular processes of 1 of 67 asymptomatic subjects. An instrumented table recorded <b>applied</b> <b>forces</b> (N), force amplitudes (N), and oscillation frequencies (Hz), and a custom device measured subjects’ spinal stiffness (N/mm). Independent t tests were used to compare the <b>forces</b> <b>applied</b> by therapists and students, intraclass correlation coefficients were used to determine variability, and linear regression was used to establish factors associated with <b>applied</b> <b>forces.</b> RESULTS: Students’ forces were generally lower (mean difference, 15. 7 N for grades III and IV; P<. 001) and applied with slower oscillation frequencies (0. 12 Hz; P<. 001) than therapists’ forces. Similar factors were associated with <b>applied</b> <b>forces</b> for both groups: male gender and greater subject body weight were associated with higher <b>applied</b> <b>forces,</b> and greater C 2 stiffness with lower forces. Having thumb pain was associated with lower <b>applied</b> <b>forces</b> for therapists but higher ones for students. Conclusions: students <b>apply</b> lower <b>forces</b> than therapists. Similar factors appear to affect <b>applied</b> <b>forces</b> regardless of clinical experience...|$|R

40|$|Structural shape deformation, in its {{conventional}} way, includes <b>applying</b> <b>forces</b> to a fixed-compliance {{structure to}} deform it to certain shapes. Rather than addressing shape {{control in the}} established way (<b>applying</b> <b>forces</b> to elastically or plastically deform a structure), this work studies the use of shape morphing, which involves combining <b>applied</b> <b>forces</b> and local modulus changes. Specifically in this paper, a simply supported elastic beam that can exhibit variable compliance behavior is selected as the model. This study focuses on the forward approach of morphing, that is, determining possible beam shapes due to the <b>applied</b> <b>force</b> and modulus variability. The goal is to incorporate variable-modulus materials into a structure model and utilize the controllable modulus change to quantify the morphing of the structure with limited actuator numbers, locations, and force levels. The resulting morphed shapes are quantified in terms of various characteristic parameters. The study demonstrates that a larger, {{and in some cases}} nonintuitive, space of shapes becomes possible when modulus change is utilized, for the same set of <b>applied</b> <b>forces...</b>|$|R
