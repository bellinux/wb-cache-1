5|$|The {{violence}} turned {{public opinion}} against Dow, {{and he was}} denounced in newspapers across the nation. He was tried for violation of the prohibition law; the prosecutor was former U.S. Attorney General Nathan Clifford, a longtime Dow opponent, and the defense attorney was a fellow founder of the Maine Temperance Society, future senator William P. Fessenden. Dow was acquitted, but his opponents convinced the coroner to impanel <b>a</b> <b>jury</b> <b>that</b> pronounced the protester's death a homicide. He was ultimately acquitted of that charge, but his popularity had suffered and he declined to run for re-election as mayor.|$|E
5|$|Pattillo Higgins {{was born}} to Roberto James and Sarah (Raye) Higgins on December 5, 1863, in Sabine Pass, Texas. His family moved to Beaumont when he was six years old. He {{attended}} school {{until he reached the}} fourth grade, after which he apprenticed as a gunsmith under his father’s direction. In his youth, he was a violent troublemaker, pulling pranks and harassing African Americans. When he was seventeen, he pulled a prank on a black Baptist church that got the attention of a sheriff deputy. The deputy fired a warning shot over Higgins' head, after which Higgins fired back and delivered what would later {{turn out to be a}} fatal hit. The wounded deputy managed to fire again, striking Higgins lower left arm. Higgins' arm would later become severely infected, requiring amputation from the elbow down. Higgins was put on trial for the murder of the deputy, but he would be found not guilty by <b>a</b> <b>jury</b> <b>that</b> perceived his act as self-defense. After his acquittal, he worked as a logger along the Texas-Louisiana border, apparently unhindered by his lack of an arm. It was in 1885 that he attended a Baptist revival meeting where he made the decision to become a Christian. Realizing that the lumber camps were not the ideal place to maintain a good morality, he decided to return to Beaumont, Texas to establish himself as a businessman.|$|E

Not long after, Sassamon's body was found in the ice-covered Assawompset Pond. There was some dispute at the time as to whether his death was the result of accident or murder. Plymouth Colony officials arrested three Wampanoags on the testimony of an Indian witness, including one of Metacomet's counselors, and <b>a</b> <b>jury</b> <b>that</b> included six Indian elders convicted the men of Sassamon's murder.

[...] In McMillan, a state statute required a 5-year minimum sentence for anyone who visibly possessed a firearm during certain crimes. [...] Imposing a mandatory minimum sentence based on this factual finding did not violate the reasonable-doubt requirement because it merely limited {{the discretion of the}} sentencing court rather than increased the maximum sentence available to the judge by virtue of the finding.|$|E

In some cases it must be unanimous, while in other jurisdictions {{it may be a}} majority or supermajority. <b>A</b> <b>jury</b> <b>that</b> is unable to come to a verdict is referred to as a hung jury.

2500|$|The {{prosecution}} removed three {{blacks from}} serving as jurors in Williams' trial. Williams' lawyers {{claimed that he}} was convicted by <b>a</b> <b>jury</b> <b>that</b> had no blacks, one Latino, one Filipino-American, and 10 caucasians. The District Attorney provided proof, however, {{in the form of}} a death certificate and the affidavit of another juror, that juror #12, William James McLurkin, was black. [...] The defense responded that, contrary to the affidavit, McLurkin did not appear black. They maintain that the trial record indicates that none of the lawyers—and particularly the prosecutor—thought McLurkin was black. McLurkin's driver license photo and the fact that both he and his mother were born in the Philippines was presented as additional evidence in a November 2005 petition for clemency. [...] The defense, however, has neither stated whether or not his mother was actually Filipina, nor refuted the evidence that McLurkin was black.|$|E
2500|$|Snowden {{was asked}} in a January 2014 {{interview}} about returning to the U.S. to face the charges in court, as Obama had suggested a few days prior.

2500|$|The {{trial began}} on October 21, 2006. Hovind hoped to {{convince}} <b>a</b> <b>jury</b> <b>that</b> his amusement park admission and merchandise sales, over $5 million from 1999 through March 2004, belonged to God {{and could not}} be taxed. Evidence produced at the trial revealed that Jo Hovind had requested financial assistance from Baptist Healthcare by claiming that the Hovinds had no income. IRS agents told the court how Hovind had attempted [...] "bullying tactics" [...] and had sued the government three times to pressure them to stop investigating. The lawsuits had been thrown out. The prosecution countered attempts to describe workers as missionaries, ministers, and volunteers, introducing memos in which they had been called employees. Workers testified that they had to punch time cards, had vacation and sick days, and did not receive W-2 tax forms. After the IRS executed the search warrant, employees were required to sign non-disclosure agreements to remain employed. A lawyer who did work for a non-profit Christian organization testified that Hovind claimed that Hovind had [...] "beat" [...] the tax system and that he favored cash transactions because they were untraceable and, consequently, untaxable.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a pair of}} cases, the Seventh Circuit {{has dealt}} with {{how and when to}} {{instruct}} <b>a</b> <b>jury</b> <b>that</b> is given the Mt. Healthy test to apply. In Greenberg v. Kmetko it directed a district court to change its instruction to more closely match the test should the case be heard by a jury, even though it had granted qualified immunity to the defendants. Frank Easterbrook observed in 1992's Gooden v. Neal, where a correctional officer alleged he had been demoted in retaliation for exposing corruption, that [...] "any defendants do not want Mt. Healthy instructions and prefer to ask an either-or question of the jury" [...] since they also contend the activity the adverse action was in retaliation for was not protected by the First Amendment. [...] "Mt. Healthy is something of a misfit in such circumstances." [...] In that case, where the employer denied that the plaintiff's speech was in any way related to the adverse decision, the chose to shift the burden of proof of that to the employer as well, an approach Donald P. Lay of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation, criticized at length in dissent. In 2002, the Ninth Circuit held that the test still applies when a plaintiff presents only a circumstantial case that the adverse action was retaliatory as opposed to a direct one.|$|E
2500|$|Justice Thurgood Marshall concurred {{that the}} trial court was constitutionally {{required}} to ask about a potential juror's racial prejudice. He further agreed, based on the record, that questions regarding pre-trial publicity were not required. However, he dissented against barring other avenues of inquiry against possible prejudice that are reasonable and relevant. [...] He reasoned that a right to an impartial jury has been fundamental to the American system of justice {{all the way back}} to the founding of the United States. This right to impartiality and fairness, he reasoned, was never meant to be limited to certain classes of prejudice, and a juror should avoid prejudging a party based on any factor that is detrimental to that party's position. [...] According to Justice Marshall, this right to an impartial jury carries with it a right to take reasonable steps to ensure that the jury is indeed unprejudiced. The most important of these is the jury challenge. Here Justice Marshall looked to Pointer v. United States, 151 U.S. 396 (1894), where a unanimous Court thought that the right to challenge was [...] "one of the most important of the rights secured to the accused" [...] and that [...] "any system for the empanelling of <b>a</b> <b>jury</b> <b>that</b> [...] or embarrasses the full, unrestricted exercise by the accused of that right, must be condemned." ...|$|E

2500|$|During {{this period}} Vernon, Cokayne and Henry Grey, Baron Grey of Codnor, were the decisive {{influences}} {{in the choice}} of knights of the shire, generally in collusion, although Humphrey Stafford also took a close interest. However, in 1433 the tacit collaboration between the gentry and Grey broke down. In April Grey sought a closer aliance by granting his livery to both Cokayne and Vernon. However, the county was already in a state of great tension, with a major dispute between the Foljambe and Pierrepont families overshadowing other issues. This did not reach a climax until 1 January 1434 at Chesterfield parish church, when Sir Henry Pierrepont was maimed and two of his companions killed. Subsequently, through the interpretations of two separate grand juries set before a commission of oyer and terminer at Derby in March and a trial the following month, the previous year's events were filtered into rival and shifting narratives. Cokayne and Vernon were part of <b>a</b> <b>jury</b> <b>that</b> upheld Thomas Foljambe's version of events. Grey was indicted for bringing a force of 200 men to Derby on 24 June 1433 to hinder the county election. However, Vernon and Cokayne were also indicted for turning out a force of 300 to take the county seats for themselves – the last time either would sit in Parliament. There was no direct connection between the contested election and the sensational murders but at the time {{there seemed to be a}} pattern of widespread violence and intimidation which both sides sought to use in justification. The 1433 Parliament had agreed that [...] "no Lorde, nor none other persone, of what estate, degree or condition that he be, shal wetyngly receyve, cherishe, hold in household, ne maynteyne" [...] criminals of any sort. To that end it had specifically forbidden the granting of livery and the maintenance of retinues as part of a general condemnation of intimidation in judicial and political affairs. Ironically, it was Grey, together with Vernon and Cokayne, described as [...] "knights of the shire," [...] who were in May 1434 commissioned under the terms of the act to take oaths from a large number of Derbyshire men, pledging themselves not to maintain peace breakers.|$|E
