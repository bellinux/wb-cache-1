To address the problem of reliable device testing, we developed an extensible traffic generator, called BRUTE (Browny and RobUst Traffic Engine), running on top of Linux operating system. BRUTE takes advantage of the Linux kernel potential in order to accurately generate traffic flows up to very high bitrates. This software is an extensible framework that provides a number of optimized functions that easily allow the implementation of <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>modules</b> for customized traffic patterns generation. A number of library modules implementing common traffic profiles (like CBR, Poisson process and Poissonian Arrival of Burst process) are already implemented and integrated into the package. Performance of BRUTE has been compared to the one of several widespread traffic generators over Fast-Ethernet and Gigabit-Ethernet networks. The results of our tests show the superior performance of BRUTE in terms of both the achieved throughput and the level of bitrate precision, under all possible values of the frame length...|$|E

The <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>module</b> {{is one of the}} few datasets which satisfies two conditions: First, it includes all member states of the EU, and second, it contains individual-level information relevant for the transition from work to retirement. A special feature of this dataset is that it allows for the investigation of the planned – as opposed to the observed – timing of retirement of still active workers, a question which is increasingly taken into consideration in the literature (see e.g. de Grip et al. 2013; Vonkova and van Soest 2014). Furthermore, the dataset allows us to identify spouses and their retirement plans (if not yet retired), thus enabling us to analyze whether spouses’ retirement plans are correlated. As social and economic differences in national backgrounds can be assumed to influence individual retirement decisions, we estimate separate models for three groups of European countries: new members in the EU, richer members of the EU 15 (countries with GDP per capita above the EU 15 average), and poorer members of the EU 15 (countries with GDP per capita below the EU 15 average).|$|R

There are marked cross-national differences {{not only in}} terms of youth unemployment, but also in terms of the quality of the jobs in which young people are employed. This article explains cross-national patterns of labour market entry among school-leavers in 11 European countries. It is hypothesized that national differences in employment protection legislation and the vocational specificity of the education system, in addition to the structural effect of macro-economic conditions, attribute to the observed cross-national variation in youth labour market integration. On the basis of the European Union LFS 2000 <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>module</b> on school-to-work transitions, the speed, the quality and the stability of the labour market entry process are analysed.

With respect to the labour-market effects of job mismatches, it is found that school-leavers with a non-matching job achieve a lower occupational status, more frequently look for another job, and more often participate in continuing vocational training than those with a matching one. These labour-market effects of job mismatches are smaller in countries in which the vocational orientation of the education system is stronger...|$|R

The results concerning the effect of educational characteristics are twofold. First, ‘vocationalism’ (i. e. a strong vocational sector in upper secondary education) acts as a safety net against dropout by offering less academically inclined students a valuable alternative with attractive labour market prospects. By contrast, while early tracking has no consistent effects in terms of average dropout rates, it dramatically boosts the effect of parental background. As regards the effect of the socio-economic context, we find a strong positive effect of poverty rates on the dropout risk of children of low-educated parents, boosting the effect of parental background. Secondly, we observe a negative effect of youth unemployment on dropout probabilities of children of high-educated parents (reduced opportunity costs), while the effect on children of low-educated parents turns out positive (reduced educational aspirations); this also strengthens the PBE. Finally, we find a strong negative effect on the average ESL-rates when qualifications offer an effective protection against unemployment, measured in terms of the relative odds of unemployment between unqualified and qualified adults. nrpages: 42 status: publishe...|$|R

In the EU-LFS an <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>module</b> on migrants {{in the labor market}} was implemented in 2008, and repeated in 2014. Data on the ‘foreign background’ or ‘migrant background’ were collected in a large number of EU member states, often referring to residents of which both parents were born abroad, capturing first and second generation. In addition, data on citizenship (or ‘nationality’ as it is often termed in international law) were collected, which refers to a legal status that indicates the relation between an individual and a state (Bauböck, 1994, p. 23; Kivisto & Faist, 2007, pp. 1 – 2). Hence, citizenship is an instrument of classification: it is a status that divides persons into two groups: citizens and foreigners. Having citizenship entails legal rights, such as the right to enter your country and to live and work there without restriction, the right to vote, the right to hold political office, among others, as well as duties, such as the obligation to serve in the military.

After some descriptive analysis, the paper presents two econometric exercises. First, several probit analysis of the probability of suffering a work-related accidents show that, once the personal and job characteristics of workers are controlled for, the differences in the probability of suffering a work accident between open-ended and temporary workers vanish. This happens in both countries and similar results are achieved when the sample is restricted to workers with at most 3 years of tenure. Second, a decomposition analysis of the mean differences in probabilities is undertaken showing that, both in Italy and Spain, personal and job characteristics tend to increase the probability of having an accident for temporary workers, but that the specific influence of the contract type favours these temporary workers, who tend to show a lower probability on this account. However, the different relative strength of these effects in both countries explains why the total effect is against temporary workers in Spain and against permanent workers in Italy. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{existing}} {{social stratification}} {{studies show that}} social inequalities in educational and occupational opportunities are still a feature of our societies. This paper aims to study country differences in {{the extent to which}} social origin affects young people's educational and occupational outcomes. Twelve countries covering different geographical, economic and social contexts in Europe are analysed in the paper. The data are drawn from the EU LFS 2000 <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>module</b> data which collected information on school-to-work transitions. In agreement with other research findings, the results show that parental education still affects young people's educational and early occupational attainment in all countries under examination. However, as expected, there are significant country variations. Thus, the relative advantage of having more educated parents emerges as stronger in the Eastern European countries and weaker in the Nordic European countries. The other Western European countries are in an intermediate position between these two groups of countries, with the Southern European countries more similar to each other. Moreover, in most countries the effect of parental education on their children's occupational status appears to be mediated mainly by education (i. e. indirect effect). This is particularly true in those countries where the association between children's education and parents' education is strongest. The conclusions outline that more universalistic Welfare State policies in the Nordic countries and the increasing social and economic disparities in the Eastern European countries, during the transition period towards a capitalist economy, may have played an important part in the polarisation of these two groups of countries at the two extremes...|$|R

In addition, the effects of having a job mismatch on the labour market position of school-leavers are examined. Special {{attention is paid to}} cross-country variation in this respect. The data that are used come from the EU LFS 2000 <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>module</b> on school-to-work transitions. The results of the empirical analysis show that several individual, job, and structural characteristics affect the likelihood of having a job mismatch. Furthermore, the incidence of job mismatches differs between European countries: in countries where the share of upper secondary education students in school-based vocational education is high, the incidence of job mismatches among school-leavers is higher than in countries where this share is low. With respect to the labour market effects of job mismatches, the most important finding is that school-leavers with a non matching job achieve less occupational status than those with a matching one. This negative effect of job mismatches is smaller in countries where the share of school-based, respectively apprenticeship-type vocational education is higher. Moreover, the analysis reveals that school-leavers with a job mismatch use adjustment strategies to improve fit. A first strategy refers to job search activities: school-leavers with a non matching job more frequently look for another job than school-leavers with a matching job. In countries where the share of school-based vocational education is high, the effect of having a job mismatch on the likelihood of looking for another job is smaller than in countries where this share is low. A second adjustment strategy concerns training participation: on average, there is a negative effect of having a job mismatch on the probability of participating in continuous vocational training.

The Labour Force Survey Ad Hoc Eurostat Datasets form the UK component of the European Union Labour Force Survey (EU LFS), and consist of a subset of core variables from the UK Quarterly Labour Force Survey (held at the UK Data Archive under GN 33246), alongside primary and secondary derived variables computed by Eurostat from the core variables supplied. The data comprise seasonal or calendar quarters, depending on the date, and are not directly comparable with the UK QLFS quarters. From 2002 - 2008 the <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> datasets only include data for quarter two of the survey year, as the questions were only asked in this quarter. From 2009, the questions were asked all year. Quarterly EU LFS datasets from 1999 onwards are also available (see under GN 33366), as are annual datasets (see under GN 33399). Users should note that the LFS Eurostat datasets available from the UK Data Archive comprise UK data only, and no data from other EU countries are included here. Further information about the EU LFS {{can be found on}} the Eurostat EU Labour Force Survey webpage. The UK Labour Force Survey (LFS) is a unique source of articulated information using international definitions of employment and unemployment and economic inactivity, together with a wide range of related topics such as occupation, training, hours of work and personal characteristics of household members aged 16 years and over. The first LFS was conducted in 1973 and continues to be one of the reasons for carrying out the survey. Eurostat co-ordinates information from labour force surveys in the European Union (EU) member states in order to assist the EU in such matters as the allocation of the Social Fund. Between 1984 and 1991 the survey was carried out annually, and moved to a quarterly cycle (the QLFS) from May 1992. Further information may be found in the main LFS documentation (see link below). LFS Documentation (main LFS) Besides the EU LFS documentation (see below), documentation is also available to accompany the main UK LFS datasets available from the Archive. This largely consists of the latest version of each document alongside the appropriate questionnaire for the year concerned. However, LFS documentation volumes are updated periodically by ONS, so users are advised to check the ONS LFS User Guidance pages before commencing analysis. Main Topics : Standard topics covered each year include household and demographic characteristics, country and region of work, employment and self-employment, employment history, working time, occupations and occupational status, job hunting, job changing, education and training, unemployment and economic activity.

40|$|The {{structure}} of storm time currents {{in the inner}} magnetosphere, including its innermost region inside 4 R(sub E), is studied {{for the first time}} using a modification of the empirical geomagnetic field model TS 07 D and new data from Van Allen Probes and Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms missions. It is shown that the model, which uses basis-function expansions instead of <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> current <b>modules</b> to approximate the magnetic field, consistently improves its resolution and magnetic field reconstruction with the increase of the number of basis functions and resolves the spatial structure and evolution of the innermost eastward current. This includes a connection between the westward ring current flowing largely at R > or approx. 3 R(sub E) and the eastward ring current concentrated at R < or approx. 3 R(sub E) resulting in a vortex current pattern. A similar pattern coined 'banana current' was previously inferred from the pressure distributions based on the energetic neutral atom imaging and first-principles ring current simulations. The morphology of the equatorial currents is dependent on storm phase. During the main phase, it is complex, with several asymmetries forming banana currents. Near SYM-H minimum, the banana current is strongest, is localized in the evening-midnight sector, and is more structured compared to the main phase. It then weakens during the recovery phase resulting in the equatorial currents to become mostly azimuthally symmetric...|$|R

The proposed method based on Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is constituted by modules of node arrays. Each {{of which is}} constituted by 25 smart nodes scattered throughout a target field. Every node re{{presents a}} Thermal Infra Red (TIR) radiation sensor and keeps a minimum size while ensuring the functions of communication, sensing, and processing. This Wireless-LST (Wi-LST) system is convenient to beinstalled on a field pointing to any type of targets (e. g. bare soil, grass, water, etc.). Ad hoc topology is adopted among the TIR nodes with multi-hop mesh routing protocol for communication, acquisition data are transmitted to the client tier wirelessly. Using these emergent technologies, we propose a practical method for Wi-LSTsystem calibration. TIR sensor (i. e. OSM 101 from OMEGA society) measures temperature, which is conditioned and amplified by an AD 595 within a precision of 0. 1 °C. Assessed LST is transmitted over thedeveloped <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> WSN <b>modules</b> (i. e. MICA 2 DOT from CROSSBOW society), and collected at in situ base station (i. e. PANASONIC CF 19 laptop) using an integrated database. LST is evaluated with a polynomialalgorithm structure as part of developed software. Finally, the comparison of the mean values of LST(Wi-LST) in each site with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) sensor, obtained from the daily LST product (MOD 11 C 1) developed by the MODIS-NASA Science Team, on board TERRA satellite during the campaign period is provided...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: {{several new}} {{applications}} {{and the new}} emerging technologies that make <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> networking possible are pushing the development of <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> networks. Securing the <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> environment {{is essential for the}} success of these new applications {{as well as for the}} entire future of <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> networking. Several <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> security aspects, like trust management and routing concerns were approached in the last few years, but no comprehensive security models for <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> environments discussed.

Security of <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> network is an area of widespread research in recent years. Some unique characteristics of <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> network itself are an immense dilemma in the way of security. In this paper we have presented study about characteristics of <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> network, how they are problematic in <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> network security, attacks in <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> network and brief description of some existing intrusion detection system. We have also justified why distributed intrusion detection is better for <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> network with comparative study of existing intrusion detections in <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> network...|$|R
