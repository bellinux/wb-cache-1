40|$|The {{ability of}} Staphylococcus aureus to invade {{mammalian}} cells may explain {{its capacity to}} colonize mucosa and to persist in tissues after bacteraemia. To date, the underlying molecular mechanisms of cellular invasion by S. aureus are unknown, despite its high prevalence and difficulties in treatment. Here, we show cellular invasion as a novel function for an S. aureus adhesin, previously implicated solely in <b>attachment.</b> <b>S.</b> aureus, but not S. epidermidis, invaded epithelial 293 cells in a temperature- and F-actin-dependent manner. Formaldehyde-fixed and live bacteria were equally invasive, suggesting that no active bacterial process was involved. All clinical S. aureus isolates analysed, but only a subset of laboratory strains, were invasive. Fibronectin-binding proteins (FnBPs) acted as S. aureus invasins, because: (i) FnBP deletion mutants of invasive laboratory strains lost invasiveness; (ii) expression of FnBPs in noninvasive strains conferred invasiveness; and (iii) the soluble isolated fibronectin-binding domain of FnBP (D 1 -D 4) completely blocked invasion. Integrin alpha 5 beta 1 served as host cell receptor, which interacted with staphylococcal FnBPs through cellular or soluble fibronectin. FnBP-deficient mutants lost invasiveness for epithelial cells, endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Thus, fibronectin-dependent bridging between S. aureus FnBPs and host cell integrin alpha 5 beta 1 is a conserved mechanism for S. aureus invasion of human cells. This may prove useful in developing new therapeutic and vaccine strategies for S. aureus infections...|$|E
40|$|A {{youth is}} {{expected}} to experience difficulties due to the opposing desire to be free while still remaining dependent to family and other significant individuals in their lives. Filipino youth are known as being family - oriented and being submissive {{which is one of}} the factors that pounds the importance of what people around them utters. Thus, creating a gap or discrepancy between what they truly want and what other people expect them to do. When these internal battles began, significant external aspects such as social interaction can be compromised. These occurrences can be elucidated by using the two frameworks Self - Discrepancy Theory and Attachment Style. In this study, correlational research design and survey method were employed to 384 Filipino Youth from Makati whom are selected through convenience sampling. Results of the study showed that the respondents have positive image of themselves. Also, a big majority of the respondents were discerned to have high discrepancies between their self - states. In this study, it was also seen that the respondents were dismissive and were characterized to be independent, self - reliant, and gave low importance to relationships. Finally, findings of this study revealed a weak positive correlation between secure <b>attachment</b> <b>s</b> tyle towards the self - discrepancy of the respondents while weak negative correlation was found between the rest of the attachment styles towards the discrepancy among their self - states. With this, the researchers recommended stabilizing internal discrepanc ies and strengthening significant relationships as the two were seen as big factors in respondents’ social interaction and self - esteem...|$|E
40|$|The early {{steps of}} rabies virus (CVS) {{infection}} in vitro were studied in chicken embryo-related (CER) cells. The infection was monitored {{by looking for}} specific intra-cytoplasmic viral inclusions using anti-rabies fluorescein isothiocyanate at 24 h after the addition of virus. The attachment of rabies virus to CER cells was shown to be inhibited by pretreatment of the cells with neuraminidase. These cells recovered their susceptibility to rabies virus infection 6 h after removal of the enzyme. Treatment of CER cells with neuraminidase after the viral attachment step did not inhibit infection. The subsequent delivery of infectious virions into acid prelysosomal vacuoles or lysosomes was studied using lysosomotropic agents. Ammonium chloride and chloroquine were used to prevent the virus fusion step thus preventing infection. Both drugs were shown to inhibit the early steps of infection, NH 4 C 1 having a much earlier effect han chloroquine. The two drugs {{had no effect on}} the <b>attachment</b> <b>s</b> ep nor did NHAC 1 inhibit virus multiplication. The use of metabolic inhibitors (2 -deoxy-D-glucose and sodium azide) shows that the entry of rabies virus into CER cells does not require the involvement of cellular energy processes. In electron microscopy studies, the presence of rabies virus particles was detected incoated pits and coated vesicles as well as in uncoated vesicles, and later in lysosomes. These data indicate that the mechanism by which rabies virus enters CER cells is probably through adsorptive endocytosis and does not require the participation of cellular metabolic active processes...|$|E

40|$|The {{major source}} of human {{salmonellosis}} are farm animals, which may frequently be intestinal carriers of the organism. Lactobacilli isolated from the intestinal tract with efficiency adhesion were selected and studied in assay competitions with different Salmonella serotypes. The growth and lectin production of lactobacilli remained unchanged in several mixed and single culture studies. However, in mixed cultures, the inhibition (bacteriostatic) of viable bacteria of salmonella strains was observed. The adhesion ratio showed significant values for L. animalis, L. fermentum, S. Gallinarum and S. Pullorum. These results indicate the remarkable importance of a specific host interaction in the colonization process by microorganisms. L. animalis was effective in reducing the <b>attachment</b> of <b>S.</b> Gallinarum, S. Pullorum and S. Enteritidis to host-specific epithelial cells, while L. fermentum was able to reduce the <b>attachment</b> of <b>S.</b> Pullorum and S. Gallinarum.

40|$|We {{compared}} {{the levels of}} adsorption of Streptococcus mutans JBP and Streptococcus sobrinus 6715 to experimental pellicles formed from unsupplemented and glucosyltransferase (GTF) -supplemented saliva. Pellicles formed on hydroxyapatite beads from GTF or from saliva-GTF mixtures possessed detectable GTF activity. Low levels of GTF activity were also detected in clarified whole human saliva, but not in samples of submandibular saliva. The adsorptive behavior of S. mutans JBP to pellicles formed from saliva or saliva-GTF mixtures was strikingly {{different from that of}} S. sobrinus 6715. S. mutans JBP adsorbed in higher numbers to pellicles formed from whole or submandibular saliva than to buffer-treated hydroxyapatite under the assay conditions used, in which blocking with albumin was used. In contrast, S. sobrinus 6715 attached in lower numbers and did not show enhanced adsorption to pellicles prepared from saliva. Pellicles prepared from the high-molecular-weight mucin fraction of submandibular saliva effectively promoted adsorption of S. mutans JBP, but none of the saliva fractions tested enhanced the <b>attachment</b> of <b>S.</b> sobrinus 6715 above the levels of buffer controls. Exposure of pellicles which contained GTF to sucrose to permit in situ synthesis of glucan markedly enhanced <b>attachment</b> of <b>S.</b> sobrinus 6715 but not <b>attachment</b> of <b>S.</b> mutans JBP. Also, the presence of sucrose throughout the adsorption period did not enhance <b>attachment</b> of <b>S.</b> mutans JBP. Both organisms possessed cell-associated GTF, and GTF preparations derived from S. sobrinus 6715 and Streptococcus sanguis FC- 1 behaved like GTF derived from S. mutans JBP. S. sobrinus 6715 attached in high numbers to dextran-treated hydroxyapatite, whereas S. mutans JBP did not. These observations suggest that S. mutans JBP cells possess an adhesin which binds to salivary components in the pellicles. In contrast, S. sobrinus 6715 cells appear to possess an adhesin which binds to glucan in the pellicles. Four additional strains of S. mutans and four additional strains of S. sobrinus behaved qualitatively like strains JBP and 6715, respectively, and thus the differences observed appear to be representative of these species. Collectively, our data indicate that S. mutans and S. sobrinus attach to different receptors in experimental pellicles...|$|R

40|$|O presente estudo discute a manifestação da afetividade interconectada com a comunicação na família à luz das relações vinculares entre gerações de filhos, pais e avós, fundamentando-se em afetividade e transmissão na abordagem sistêmica. Seu objetivo foi identificar e compreender os padrões afetivos transmitidos intergeracionalmente pelos discursos nas narrativas e memórias dos membros familiares. Foi feita uma pesquisa qualitativa com delineamento de estudo de caso e entrevista semi-estruturada que analisou o discurso dos sujeitos (três famílias) pela comunicação verbal e não- verbal em suas trajetórias de vida. No estudo, foram abordados elementos vinculados à formação de valores afetivos dentro das questões familiares, gênero e cultura. Os conflitos que emergem do medo de separação das pessoas, vínculos relacionais e como isto pode ser vivenciado com menos angústia, desprazer, expressando sentimentos carregados de carga afetiva. Na prática, do cotidiano, existe a intenção de incorporar novos saberes, modificar atitudes comunicacionais, rever a construção da afetividade, buscando a compreensão de papéis e valores conflitantes pela construção de parcerias relacionais entre gerações. A pesquisa evidenciou os padrões afetivos formados e transmitidos intergeracionalmente e a falta de um diálogo mais igualitário sobre os sentimentos, espaço e tempo torna-se empecilho na construção de melhor qualidade nas relações familiares. Diante do prazer e desprazer, da proximidade e distanciamento das pessoas, de vínculos afetivos, os afetos sofrem um abalo, manifestando a dimensão do apego. Constatou-se também a importância dos sinais da comunicação ligados à afetividade na área relacional, mesmo no contexto de uma família considerada afetiva e expressiva. Portanto, o olhar intergeracional dos estudos afetivos transmitidos dentro de uma família revela valores estimáveis e inquestionáveis à sobrevivência do ser humano para relações familiares mais satisfatóriasThis study {{discusses}} the way behaviors of affection interact and are interconnected {{with the family}} communication, through intergerational attachments of generations of grandparents, parents and their children, based upon affectivity and transmission. It s main objective was to identify and understand the affection patterns passed through family generations in it s speeches, narratives and member s memories troughs systemic theory. A qualitative research was made with a case study and a semi-structured interview in which the speeches {{of the family members}} (three families) were analyzed through verbal and non-verbal communication during their life span. In the study with the families, it was considered the aspects related to the establishment of the affective values within the family, gender roles and culture. The conflicts that emerge from the fear of being separated from people, relational attachments and how it can be lived with less distress, unpleasantly feelings an it s expressions with an enormous emotional weight. In practice, during day-by-day routines, there is an intention to absorb new knowledge, chance communication attitudes, and review the construction of affectivity, looking for the comprehension of places and conflicted values found in the partnership lived by different generations. This study demonstrated that patterns of affection are formed and transmitted through family generations, and the impossibility to express and talk about it s feelings {{at the same time and}} importance is a obstacle in the construction of better family relations. To deal with pleasure and unpleasant situations, closeness to people, different kinds of attachments, the family members bonds can be shaken, showing the <b>attachment</b> <b>s</b> intensity. It was also clear the importance of the communication signs linked to the relational area, even with the families considered very affective and expressive of its feelings. Accordingly, the importance to have an intergerational look in the study of the feelings of affection transmitted inside the same family reveals important values in the family relationships patterns that are priceless to the human being and better family relationship...|$|E
40|$|Initial work {{involved}} the isolation and characterization of bacteria {{found on the}} surfaces {{in a range of}} food processing environments. The attachment characteristics of three species of bacteria (S. liquefaciens, S. cohnii and P. fragi) isolated from the same production surface were examined. Mixed culture biofilm development was also modelled using these three organisms. The species were found to have differing attachment abilities and therefore cell surface characteristics such as outer membrane protein and lipopolysaccharide profiles, exopolysaccharide production, and cell surface hydrophobicity and charge were examined to explain these differences. All of these cell surface characteristics were subject to considerable variation in response to the environmental conditions. The outer membrane protein and lipopolysaccharide profiles did not show any relationship to attachment levels, and similarly exopolysaccharide production did not relate to the levels of attachment observed, although exopolysaccharide production was found to be particularly associated with attached cells.

This study aimed to investigate modulatory effects of epigenetic modification by feed restriction on S. enterica serovar Enteritidis colonization in broiler chickens subjected to feed withdrawal stress. Chicks were divided into four groups: ad libitum feeding; ad libitum feeding with 24 -h feed withdrawal on day 42; 60 % feed restriction on days 4, 5, and 6; and 60 % feed restriction on days 4, 5, and 6 with 24 -h feed withdrawal on day 42. <b>Attachment</b> of <b>S.</b> Enteritidis to ileal tissue was determined using an ex vivo ileal loop assay, and heat shock protein 70 (Hsp 70) expression was evaluated using sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western blotting.

Most of these reactions could proceed in the presence of whole saliva although adherence of S. rattus BHT to the streptococci was inhibited by salivary molecules. In contrast, adherence of S. mutans 10449 and KPSK 2 to A. viscosus, S. sanguis, and S. mitis was enhanced by salivary molecules. S. mutans KPSK 2, S. sobrinus OMZ 176, and S. rattus FA- 1 binding to A. viscosus NC 3 and S. sanguis G 9 B exhibited saturation kinetics. Adherence to A. viscosus NC 3 was of a higher avidity than adherence to S. sanguis G 9 B. <b>Attachment</b> of <b>S.</b> mutans KPSK 2 to S. sanguis G 9 B and of S. mutans OMZ 176 to A. viscosus NC 3 and S. sanguis G 9 B was inhibited by heat treatment of the mutans streptococci. <b>Attachment</b> of <b>S.</b> mutans KPSK 2 to A. viscosus NC 3 and of S. rattus FA- 1 to A. viscosus NC 3 and S. sanguis G 9 B was unaffected by heat.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{foreseen}} the influence of elastomers on the development of mucous-borne dentures in the aspect of bio-compatible use of prosthetic foundation tissue load bearing capacity. Design/methodology/approach: Multi-criteria comparative analysis based on the dendrological matrix of attractiveness and potential was used for the studies of denture solution and materials. There were differentiated seven groups of conventional dentures without an implantological stabilisation - the so-called hard dentures (CD) and those with a soft relining (CD-P), stabilized on one implant (SID) or on two implants (TID), that were differentiated as far as the denture attachment to implant was concerned. The first group was marked as „hard” (K) due to the used materials and inconsiderable lateral compliance. The elastomeric <b>attachments</b> (<b>S)</b> constituted the second group of attachments. Findings: In case of conventional dentures a significant influence of the relining on attractiveness was observed. In case of dentures retained on elastomeric attachments – they decided not only on the attractiveness, but they have also significantly increased dentures’ potential. Research limitations/implications: Throughout the studies the variation of denture bearing structure materials were not taken into account, based on the assumption that acrylates are the most commonly used. Practical implications: The similar level of attractiveness of dentures retained on implants significantly varying as far as their construction is concerned shows that the focus should be mainly put on material design of elastomers’ wearing characteristics. Originality/value: Multi-criteria heuristic analysis proved to be an effective tool for examination of dentures in the aspect evaluation of dentures material and cosntruction that show perspectives of the broadest use due to exploitation of the tissue bearing capability...|$|R

A nonclinical sample of 86 non-Hispanic Caucasian mother-child dyads {{participated in the study}} when children were approximately 3. 5 years old (M = 3. 73). Maternal sensitivity and children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>attachment</b> security were observed across three visits: one visit was in the home, and two visits were in the park. Mothers completed a series of questionnaires measuring a global index of marital discord, spousal verbal aggression, spousal physical aggression, and childrearing disagreements. The relations between the aspects of marital conflict on maternal sensitivity and children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>attachment</b> security with their mothers were explored. In line with previous research, results revealed that maternal sensitivity was positively associated with children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>attachment</b> security, indicating that mothers who were more sensitive and responsive with their children {{were more likely to have}} children who used their mothers as a secure base from which to explore from. Results also revealed very low overall reports of conflict in the sample. Despite the low levels of conflict reported, verbal aggression significantly predicted maternal sensitivity above and beyond global marital conflict. Findings are discussed in light of attachment theory and previous marital conflict research, and suggest the need to replicate this study with a more representative sample, in terms of ethnicity and SES factors in order to potentially find more variability in the measures, as well as to increase the ability to generalize findings. Additionally, the need for a larger sample is highlighted, in order to increase the power to detect effects. Studying these relations longitudinally would also help establish the direction of any effects found. Further, findings also underscore the need to include fathers in future studies in order to have a better understanding of what occurs in the marital relationship and the family system. ...|$|R

Attachment to sHA by A. viscosus T 14 V was not inhibited {{in the presence of}} Streptococcus mutans GS 5, either in {{the presence or absence of}} sucrose. Precoating sHA beads with S. mutans in the presence of sucrose also did not retard strain T 14 V attachment. However, the presence of Streptococcus sanguis M 5 during strain T 14 V attachment markedly inhibited the interaction of A. viscosus T 14 V with sHA, whereas another S. sanguis strain, strain G 9 B, produced relatively weak inhibition. The inhibitory effect of S. sanguis M 5 appeared to result from the direct interaction of this organism with A. viscosus T 14 V. Conversely, the presence of strain T 14 V markedly increased the <b>attachment</b> of <b>S.</b> sanguis M 5 to sHA while partially inhibiting the <b>attachment</b> of <b>S.</b> sanguis G 9 B. Moreover, sHA beads precoated with A. viscosus T 14 V bound much higher levels of S. sanguis M 5 relative to uncoated sHA, whereas S. sanguis G 9 B attachment was only weakly inhibited. It was also observed that sHA beads precoated with either S. sanguis M 5 or G 9 B inhibited subsequent attachment by strain T 14 V. These results suggest the possibility that the attachment sites for both S. sanguis strains partially overlap those for A. viscosus T 14 V. Streptococcus mitis weakly inhibited attachment of strain T 14 V to sHA, and both Streptococcus salivarius and Lactobacillus casei had little effect on attachment. In addition, both a radioisotope attachment assay and fluorescent microscopy demonstrated no significant attachment of A. viscosus T 14 V to human epithelial cells...|$|R

40|$|Certain {{properties}} of experimental pellicles {{formed by the}} adsorption of salivary components on hydroxyapatite surfaces change over time. To determine whether enzymes likely {{to be present in}} the oral environment could induce such changes, pellicles were treated with saliva which had been incubated for 18 h at 35 °C to promote the elaboration of microbial enzymes. This treatment markedly reduced the numbers of Streptococcus mutans MT 3 and JBP and S. sanguis FC- 1 and C 5 cells which attached, but it had little or no effect on the <b>attachment</b> of <b>S.</b> mitis RE 7, Actinomyces viscosus LY 7 and CK- 8, Bacteroides gingivalis 381, or B. melaninogenicus subsp. intermedius 581. Heating the incubated saliva at 60 °C for 30 min partially reduced its pellicle-modifying activity, whereas heating at 80 °C for 30 min or 100 °C for 15 min completely eliminated such activity. This indicated that the saliva contained heat-labile substances, presumably enzymes, which could affect the pellicle receptors involved in the <b>attachment</b> of <b>S.</b> mutans and S. sanguis. Treatment of saliva-treated hydroxyapatite with commercially obtained enzyme preparations also affected bacterial attachment. Thus, treatment with galactose oxidase reduced the numbers of the S. mutans strains which attached, whereas treatment with neuraminidase reduced the adsorption of S. sanguis FC- 1 but not that of S. sanguis C 5. Treatment with β-glucosidase preparations derived from almonds significantly reduced the attachment of all of the streptococcal strains studied, but, when subjected to isoelectric fractionation, the adherence-inhibiting activity did not correlate directly with β-glucosidase activity. Treatment of the pellicles with trypsin or eight other glycosidases did not affect streptococcal attachment. Exposure of the enzymatically modified pellicles to fresh saliva did not restore the streptococcal receptors. Collectively, the data suggest that some bacterial receptors in the pellicle coating of teeth can be modified by enzymes likely to be present in the oral environment, and these interactions may affect oral bacterial ecology...|$|R
30|$|G- 6 -Pase is {{considered}} to be a multifunctional enzyme which is a characteristic constituent of the endoplasmic reticulum. The enzyme splits glucose 6 -phosphate into glucose and inorganic orthophosphate. Biochemists use it as a marker of the endoplasmic reticulum. The present work showed that G- 6 -Pase is more highly active in S. mansoni than in S. haematobium. This is in agreement with Burenina (2009) who studied the activity and properties of G- 6 -Pase in Phagocata sibirica (free-living turbellarian) and Bothriocephalus scorpii (cestode). Moreover, Moore and Halton (1975) reported that G- 6 -Pase is not present in the larval stages of Fasciola hepatica (redia and cercariae). This may be due to the ability of adult Platyhelminthes to release glucose from glycogen and gluconeogenic precursors (Burenina, 2009). This could explain the stronger <b>attachment</b> of <b>S.</b> mansoni than of S. haematobium to host tissues.|$|R

Direct visualizations using fluorescent intensity and SEM imaging were performed the attachment and it {{was measured to be}} less than 100  s to complete the absorption. Chemotaxis test revealed that the maximum velocity of the bacteria-attached microparticle was ~ 5  um/s which is comparable to the state of art researches. Besides, this method excludes any toxic fabrication steps or chemicals so that the devices is reusable. Therefore, the presenting method is highly useful for a chemotaxis delivery of microparticles such as drug delivery system if the microparticles contains a drug. While the size of microparticle (30 – 50  um) are far too large to pass through the circulatory system, they are still useful when injected right near a lesion, not through a circulatory system.|$|R

60|$|Attachment.--All the species, except S. villosum, are {{attached}} to horny corallines: the singular means of <b>attachment</b> in <b>S.</b> vulgare will be described under that species, and is probably common to several of the other species. The larva in most, or in all cases, when it proceeds to attach itself, clings head downwards to the branch, and hence the capitulum comes to be placed upwards, with its orifice fronting the branch and the carina outwards. The sucking disc of the prehensile antennæ of the larva, in the five species examined, was a little pointed, and in shape resembled the hinder hoof of a mule: this may perhaps {{be accounted for by}} the narrowness of the branches of the corallines, to which it has to adhere: a large circular disc, as in Lepas, would have been worse than useless: the ultimate segment in most or all the species, has on its inner side (the segment being supposed to be extended straight forward) a notch or step, bearing, I believe, two spines.|$|R
40|$|P>The chaplin {{proteins}} ChpA-H {{enable the}} filamentous bacterium Streptomyces coelicolor to form reproductive aerial structures by assembling into surface-active amyloid-like fibrils. We here demonstrate that chaplins also mediate <b>attachment</b> of <b>S.</b> coelicolor to surfaces. Attachment {{coincides with the}} formation of fimbriae, which are connected to the cell surface via spike-shaped protrusions. Mass spectrometry, electron microscopy and Congo red treatment showed that these fimbriae are composed of bundled amyloid fibrils of chaplins. Attachment and fimbriae formation were abolished in a strain in which the chaplin genes chpA-H were inactivated. Instead, very thin fibrils emerged from the spike-shaped protrusions in this mutant. These fibrils were susceptible to cellulase treatment. This enzymatic treatment also released wild-type fimbriae from the cell surface, thereby abolishing attachment. The reduced attachment of a strain in which the gene of a predicted cellulose synthase was inactivated also indicates a role of cellulose in surface attachment. We propose that the mechanism of attachment via cellulose-anchored amyloidal fimbriae is widespread in bacteria and may function in initiation of infection and in formation of biofilms...|$|R
40|$|Pretreatment of {{stainless}} steel (AISI 304 & AISI 316) surfaces with skimmed UHT milk significantly reduced the numbers of attaching Staphylococcus aureus and other Gram positive bacteria, although the same effect was not observed with the Gram negative Pseudomonas fragi and Escherichia coli. Milk constituents with molecular weights below 1000 Daltons did not show the observed effect. Droplet contact angle experiments showed that the stainless steel surface became only marginally more hydrophobic when milk was adsorbed. The <b>attachment</b> of <b>S.</b> aureus onto stainless steel {{was found to be}} dependent on the physico-chemical properties of the bacterial surface, the stainless steel surface and of the suspending solution. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that proteins are adsorbed onto the stainless steel surface in approximately the same proportions as those in the bulk milk. Of the milk proteins, the caseins were more effective at inhibiting attachment. This was found to be true even when the proteins were used at identical concentrations, rather than in the proportions found naturally in milk, k-Casein was the most effective at inhibiting attachment...|$|R
