5|$|Although {{helicopters}} {{were not}} used in Mozambique {{to the same extent}} <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> Vietnam, the Alouette III was the most widely used, although the Puma was also used with great success. Other aircraft were employed: for air support the T6 and the Fiat G.91 were used; for reconnaissance, the Dornier Do 27. In the transport role, the Portuguese Air Force used mainly the Nord Noratlas and the C-47. The Portuguese Navy also made extensive use of patrol boats, landing crafts, and inflatable Zodiacs.|$|E
5|$|Kasuga and Nisshin {{participated in}} the Battle of the Yellow Sea on 10 August, but only played a minor role <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> {{the rear of the}} Japanese battleline. During the battle, the ship's {{executive}} officer was Kantarō Suzuki, later Prime Minister of Japan. Kasuga was not significantly damaged, although she was hit three times with 11 crewmen wounded. Kasuga fired 33 ten-inch shells along with an unknown number of eight-inch shells during the battle. After the battle the sisters returned to Pigeon Bay where they engaged the Russian fortifications.|$|E
5|$|Limusaurus was {{described}} in a 2009 paper authored by Xu et al. in the journal Nature. The description incorporated data from two subadult specimens found in close association: the holotype, IVPP V 15923, is an almost complete articulated (i.e. with the bones laid out <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> life) skeleton; and the other, IVPP V 15304, is a likewise almost complete articulated specimen, only missing the skull. The second specimen is 15% larger than the holotype. These specimens have also respectively been referred to by the erroneous specimen numbers IVPP V 15924 and IVPP V 16134.|$|E

5|$|Megaloceros or Irish Elk is {{a species}} from the Pliocene to Pleistocene epochs in Eurasia. Hawkins built a family unit of male, female and fawn; the adult male bore antlers made from actual fossil antlers, long since replaced. Moved {{from the third}} island, they had fallen into {{disrepair}} <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> a place easily accessible by vandals. With their original but fragile antlers, the Irish Elks were the most accurate of the models; since they are of recent geological age (dying out 11,000 years ago), Hawkins was able to model them on living deer.|$|E
5|$|Populations {{of stars}} have been aging and evolving, so that distant galaxies (which are {{observed}} <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> the early universe) appear {{very different from}} nearby galaxies (observed in a more recent state). Moreover, galaxies that formed relatively recently, appear markedly different from galaxies formed at similar distances but shortly after the Big Bang. These observations are strong arguments against the steady-state model. Observations of star formation, galaxy and quasar distributions and larger structures, agree well with Big Bang simulations {{of the formation of}} structure in the universe, and are helping to complete details of the theory.|$|E
5|$|Stephen's brother, Henry of Blois, Bishop of Winchester {{and one of}} the king's main supporters, had {{recently}} been appointed papal legate. Henry objected to Stephen's actions in arresting the bishops and confiscating their property, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> contravention of canon law. Henry called a legatine council, a church council convened by a papal legate, at Winchester to discuss the issue, which ended in nothing being done, although both sides threatened excommunication and stated they would appeal to Rome and the papacy for support. Alexander did not attend the council of Winchester, but his uncle did. He seems to have borne Stephen no ill will over the arrest, and worked with the king during Stephen's later reign.|$|E

5|$|There are {{differences}} within the material added by Scribe B. The first 23 stanzas of the B material {{shows signs of}} partial modernisation of the orthography, while the remainder show much more retention of Old Welsh features. Jarman explains this by suggesting that Scribe B started by partially modernising the orthography as he copied the stanzas, {{but after a while}} tired of this and copied the remaining stanzas <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> the older manuscript. Isaac suggested that Scribe B was using two sources, called B1 and B2. If this is correct, the material in the Books of Aneirin is from three sources.|$|E

5|$|Wine and beer, {{especially}} of the home-made varieties, were central to socialising in Wales, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> England. This remained the case even when tea gained popularity in England, supplanting the home-made alcohol. Beer is now the national drink of Wales, although Welsh beers never gained the status of other British beers, such as stout or English ales. This was {{in part due to}} the breweries keeping promotion of their products to a minimum so as not to upset the temperance movement in Wales.|$|E
5|$|According to {{contemporaneous}} chronicler Robert of Torigni, on {{the death}} of Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou in 1151 his second son, who was also called Geoffrey, inherited four castles. Robert did not specify which these were, but historian W. L. Warren speculated that Chinon, Loudun, and Mirebeau numbered amongst these castles <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> the territory which may have been traditionally the inheritance of the second oldest son. Geoffrey rebelled against his older brother, Henry, in 1152. Henry negotiated with the castellans of the castles of Chinon, Loudun, and Mirebeau to surrender before laying siege to Château de Montsoreau. Following the loss of Montsoreau, Geoffrey surrendered to his brother. By 1156 Chinon, Loudun, and Mirebeau were back under Geoffrey's control. That year he readied them for war as he rebelled against Henry a second time. In the intervening years, his brother had been crowned King HenryII of England {{at the end of a}} long-running civil war. Henry besieged and captured Geoffrey's castles in the summer of 1156 and kept them under his control, giving Geoffrey an annuity of £1,500 in compensation. The presence of a treasury and one of HenryII's main arsenals marked Chinon as a particularly important castle in the 12thcentury. It was a primary residence of HenryII who was responsible for construction of almost all of the massive castle.|$|E
5|$|Adams filed a countersuit, {{claiming}} {{the case was}} in poor taste and frivolous, and that, as author of the Nancy Drew series, she retained the rights to her work. Although Adams had written many of the titles after 1953, and edited others, she {{claimed to be the}} author of all of the early titles. In fact, she had rewritten the older titles and was not their original author. When Mildred Benson was called to testify about her work for the Syndicate, Benson's role in writing the manuscripts of early titles was revealed in court with extensive documentation, contradicting Adams' claims to authorship. The court ruled that Grosset had the rights to publish the original series <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> print in 1980, but did not own characters or trademarks. Furthermore, any new publishers chosen by Adams were completely within their rights to print new titles.|$|E

5|$|Although {{working within}} the Neo-Gothic school of design, they {{differed}} from Neo-Gothic architects like Gilbert Scott who simply included certain Gothic features on modern styles of building; instead they sought to return completely to Medieval Gothic methods of craftmanship. The products created by the Firm included furniture, architectural carving, metalwork, stained glass windows, and murals. Their stained glass windows proved a particular success in the firm's early years <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> high demand for the surge in the Neo-Gothic construction and refurbishment of churches, {{many of which were}} commissioned by the architect George Frederick Bodley. Despite Morris's anti-elitist ethos, the Firm soon became increasingly popular and fashionable with the bourgeoisie, particularly following their exhibit at the 1862 International Exhibition in South Kensington, where they received press attention and medals of commendation. However, they faced much opposition from established design companies, particularly those belonging to the Neo-Classical school.|$|E
5|$|By now the Ottomans had {{essentially}} won the war; Byzantium {{was reduced}} to a few settlements other than Constantinople and was forced to recognize its vassal status to the Ottoman Sultan. This vassalage continued until 1394. However, whilst Constantinople had been neutralized, the surrounding Christian powers were still a threat to the Ottomans and Asia Minor was not under complete Ottoman control. The Ottomans continued their thrust into the Balkans, proving to be great conquerors in Europe <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> Anatolia; in 1385 Sofia was captured from the Bulgarians and Niš was taken the following year. Other smaller states were subjugated as vassals, including the Serbs. Serbian resistance was crushed at the Battle of Kosovo in 1389, much of Bulgaria was taken in 1393 by Bayezid I (the Thunderbolt) and in 1396 the last bastion of Bulgarian independence was wiped out when Vdiin fell.|$|E
5|$|Life for the blue-collar men of {{the port}} is {{increasingly}} hard and work is scarce. As union leader, Sobotka has taken it on himself to reinvigorate the port by lobbying politicians to support much-needed infrastructure improvement initiatives. Lacking the funds needed {{for this kind of}} influence, Sobotka has become involved with a smuggling ring. Around him, his son and nephew also turn to crime, as they have few other opportunities to earn money. It becomes clear to the Sobotka detail that the dead girls are related to their investigation, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> a container {{that was supposed to be}} smuggled through the port. They again use wiretaps to infiltrate the crime ring and slowly work their way up the chain towards The Greek, the mysterious man in charge. But Valchek, upset that their focus has moved beyond Sobotka, gets the FBI involved. The Greek has a mole inside the FBI and starts severing his ties to Baltimore when he learns about the investigation.|$|E

5|$|On November 30, Louisiana Tech {{was invited}} {{to play in the}} Independence Bowl but asked for more time <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> {{negotiations}} with the Liberty Bowl and Heart of Dallas Bowl. Louisiana Tech athletic director Bruce Van De Velde and WAC commissioner Jeff Hurd both claimed that on December 1, the Liberty Bowl executive director Steve Ehrhart guaranteed the Bulldogs a bowl invite. After the Independence Bowl's deadline for Louisiana Tech to accept their invitation passed, the Independence Bowl selected the MAC's Ohio (8–4) instead. On December 2, the Liberty Bowl extended their remaining bid to Iowa State (6–6) instead of Louisiana Tech (9–3). The Liberty Bowl did not respond to The Times' request for comment on the situation. Louisiana Tech did not end up playing in any bowl game despite boasting the nation's top scoring offense.|$|E
5|$|On the August 10 {{episode of}} Raw, Triple H met with Michaels at an office {{cafeteria}} in Texas where Michaels {{was working as}} a chef; throughout the show, Triple H tried to convince Michaels to return to WWE from hiatus. After several incidents (including grease grill burgers on fire and Michaels shouting at a little girl), Michaels agreed to team with Triple H to face The Legacy at SummerSlam, superkicked the girl, and quit his chef job. On the August 17 episode of Raw, Triple H and Michaels officially reunited as DX, but <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> the process of their in-ring promo, The Legacy attacked them both.

5|$|Television {{audiences for}} the final reached more than 10million in both Spain and the United Kingdom. 11.3million people watched the match on Spain's Antena 3 network – the largest viewing figures for that station {{in the past year}} – while another 600,000 watched on Canal+ Spain. In the United Kingdom, however, {{although}} the match received the highest ratings of any programme that evening, viewing figures were down by 1.5million on the previous year's final, with just 9.6million watching on ITV1, although an additional 1.79million watched on Sky Sports 1. Despite there being no Italian or French representative in the final, the figures were much the same in those two countries <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> Spain and the United Kingdom, with Italy's Rai Uno garnering an average viewership of 9.63million and France's TF1 receiving 8.25million. Only 6.55million people watched the match on Germany's Sat.1 channel. According to a survey, global viewing figures for the match averaged 109million; this put the UEFA Champions League final above the Super Bowl (106million viewers in 2009) as the most-watched annual sporting event in the world. Total figures, which included viewers who watched only part of the match, put the Champions League final even further ahead of the Super Bowl, with 206million viewers compared to 162million.|$|E
