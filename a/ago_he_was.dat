500|$|Coward was {{homosexual}} but, {{following the}} convention of his times, this was never publicly mentioned. The critic Kenneth Tynan's description in 1953 {{was close to}} an acknowledgment of Coward's sexuality: [...] "Forty years <b>ago</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> Slightly in Peter Pan, and {{you might say that}} he has been wholly in Peter Pan ever since. No private considerations have been allowed to deflect the drive of his career; like Gielgud and Rattigan, like the late Ivor Novello, he is a congenital bachelor." [...] Coward firmly believed his private business was not for public discussion, considering [...] "any sexual activities when over-advertised" [...] to be tasteless. Even in the 1960s, Coward refused to acknowledge his sexual orientation publicly, wryly observing, [...] "There are still a few old ladies in Worthing who don't know." [...] Despite this reticence, he encouraged his secretary Cole Lesley to write a frank biography once Coward was safely dead.|$|E

After four years at Parham, the Crabbes moved to a home in Great Glemham, Suffolk, placed at his disposal by Dudley North. The family remained here {{for four or five}} years. In 1796 their third son, Edmund {{died at the age of}} six. This was a heavy blow to Sarah who began suffering from a nervous disorder from which she never recovered. Crabbe, a devoted husband, tended her with exemplary care until her death in 1813. Robert Southey, writing about Crabbe to his friend, Neville White, in 1808, said [...] "It was not long before his wife became deranged, and when all this was told me by one who knew him well, five years <b>ago,</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> still almost confined in his own house, anxiously waiting upon this wife in her long and hopeless malady. A sad history! It is no wonder that he gives so melancholy a picture of human life." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cricket {{dominated}} Fowler's {{free time}} during his early years, {{and he played}} golf {{for the first time}} in 1879, aged 23 after a business trip to Bideford, Devon.

He won the handicap prize in the club's autumn tournament, but his cricketing commitments curtailed his involvement in the game during the 1880s. He returned to the game a decade later, winning a medal at Westward Ho!, playing as a scratch golfer. His improvement was marked; a 1901 newspaper described it: [...] "A few years <b>ago</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> unknown and as he is now in his mid-forties his recent exploits appear particularly brilliant. He drives almost as far as James Braid, the Open champion." [...] He finished joint 26th in the 1900 Open Championship, and competed for England against Scotland in each year from 1903–1905. He was known as an eccentric player, often varying the size of the balls and clubs with which he played: [...] "Mr. Fowler putts sometimes with a driving iron but often uses a mallet which looks like a sandwich box with a stick stuck through the middle." ...|$|E
