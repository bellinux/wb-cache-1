5|$|Hester {{began his}} {{professional}} {{career in the}} National Football League with the Chicago Bears, who selected him {{in the second round}} of the 2006 NFL Draft with the 57th overall pick. The team originally drafted Hester as a cornerback, but they intended to play him as a return specialist, following the retirement of Jerry Azumah, and departure of Bobby Wade. The team's decision to draft Hester was initially criticized by fans and sports <b>analysts,</b> <b>who</b> believed the Bears should have spent their early picks on offensive prospects.|$|E
5|$|Plante had a well-earned {{reputation}} {{for his ability}} to analyse the game of hockey. He began shouting directions to his teammates during games in his first stint in the minor leagues (the goaltender usually has the best view of the game). He kept extensive notes on opposing players and teams throughout his career. He made his debut in the broadcasting booth during his first retirement in the 1960s as a colour commentator for broadcasts of Quebec Junior League games alongside Danny Gallivan of Hockey Night in Canada fame. Radio Canada, the French language branch of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, brought Plante aboard as on-air analyst for its television broadcasts of the 1972 Summit Series between the national team of the Soviet Union and a Canadian team made up of professional players from the NHL. Plante {{was one of the few}} North American <b>analysts</b> <b>who</b> dissented from the widely held belief in the superiority of the Canadian team.|$|E

5|$|While the CPC is {{probably}} the organization with most access to North Korea, writing about North Korea is tightly circumscribed. The few reports accessible {{to the general public}} are those about North Korean economic reforms. While Chinese analysts of North Korea tend to speak positively of North Korea in public, in official discussions they show much disdain for North Korea's economic system, the cult of personality which pervades society, the Kim family, the idea of hereditary succession in a socialist state, the security state, the use of scarce resources on the Korean People's Army and the general impoverishment of the North Korean people. There are those <b>analysts</b> <b>who</b> compare the current situation of North Korea with that of China during the Cultural Revolution. Over the years, the CPC has tried to persuade the Workers' Party of Korea (or WPK, North Korea's ruling party) to introduce economic reforms by showing them key economic infrastructure in China. For instance, in 2006 the CPC invited the WPK general secretary Kim Jong-il to Guandong province to showcase the success economic reforms have brought China. In general, the CPC considers the WPK and North Korea to be negative examples of a communist ruling party and socialist state.|$|E

25|$|After news of {{the seizure}} became public, there was a {{backlash}} against the government for apparent abuse {{of power and the}} family ties between Fombah Sirleaf and the President of Liberia, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf.

25|$|The Victory Tests {{were greeted}} by packed English grounds, and {{raised a lot of}} money for war charities. Against expectations, the Australians managed to draw the series 22 against an England team filled with Test cricketers.

By the time the team arrived in Australia they were extremely tired and their performances deteriorated, leading <b>analysts</b> <b>who</b> had not seen them in England to regard them as a weak team.|$|E

25|$|Politicizing Science: The Alchemy of Policymaking {{is a book}} by the George C. Marshall Institute, {{edited by}} Michael Gough. The book, {{published}} in 2003, encourages a disinterested objectivity {{on the part of}} scientists and policymakers: Ideally, the scientists or <b>analysts</b> <b>who</b> generate estimates of harm that may result from a risk would consider all the relevant facts and alternative interpretations of the data, and remain skeptical about tentative conclusions. Ideally, too, the agency officials and politicians, who have to enact a regulatory program, would consider its costs and benefits, ensure that it will do more good than harm, and remain open to options to stop or change the regulation in situations where the underlying science is tentative.|$|E
25|$|Jeremiah Wright {{is a man}} who {{less than}} a week after 9/11 gave a sermon that sadistically rejoiced how America's {{chickens}} had come home to roost... The fact is, Barack Obama opted to remain in this minister's company for more than six years after that sermon until partially distancing himself just last week in the heat of a presidential race... What the <b>analysts</b> <b>who</b> are gushing over Obama's sentiments regarding race relations are missing is not only did Obama fail to accomplish the mission he needed to, he didn't even really try. He made no attempt to explain his relationship with Wright and why he hung around a man who habitually offered such hateful rhetoric. Obama instead offered a non-sequitur on race relations.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, {{the game}} was {{televised}} nationally by NBC. It was also streamed live online, both to computers (via NFL.com and NBCSports.com) and mobile devices (via Verizon Wireless's NFL Mobile app), the first legal online streaming of a Super Bowl telecast in the USA. Al Michaels called play-by-play for NBC, marking the eighth {{time that he was}} behind the microphone for a Super Bowl and the second time he called a Super Bowl for NBC (Michaels had previously done play-by-play for Super Bowls XXII, XXV, XXIX, XXXIV, XXXVII, and XL for ABC and Super Bowl XLIII for NBC). Cris Collinsworth was the color analyst for the game, his second Super Bowl as a game analyst and first since he was in the booth for Super Bowl XXXIX for Fox. Michele Tafoya was the sideline reporter. Bob Costas and Dan Patrick (who also presided over the trophy presentation ceremony) hosted the pregame, halftime, and postgame coverage for NBC with Football Night in America analysts Tony Dungy and Rodney Harrison and special guest <b>analysts</b> (<b>who</b> were seated next to Costas during the pre-game festivities), Aaron Rodgers and Hines Ward.

500|$|Box office analysts, on {{the other}} hand, {{estimated}} that the film would be a box office success. [...] "The holy grail of 3-D has finally arrived," [...] said an analyst for Exhibitor Relations. [...] "This is why all these 3-D venues were built: for Avatar. This is the one. The behemoth." [...] The [...] "cautionary estimate" [...] was that Avatar would bring in around $60million in its opening weekend. Others guessed higher. There were also <b>analysts</b> <b>who</b> believed that the film's three-dimensionality would help its box office performance, given that recent 3D films had been successful.|$|E

It uses algorithms and machine-learning to automate certain aspects of data preparation.

500|$|Sexual Preference {{attracted}} considerable {{media attention}} in 1981. Prior to its publication, Jane E. Brody wrote in The New York Times {{that the study}} was [...] "likely to arouse controversy {{not only because of}} its findings, which the authors expect to anger both the psychoanalytic and the homosexual communities, but also because it relies on the memories of those interviewed and on a statistical technique called path analysis that is subject to misuse and can only explore existing notions, not create new ones." [...] According to Brody, Bell said that he expected the study to be condemned by both [...] "radical gays for even looking into the subject and by the <b>analysts</b> <b>who</b> may say we're trying to paint a glowing picture of homosexuality," [...] the psychologist John DeCecco called Sexual Preference [...] "very dubious on a theoretical basis and on the basis of how reliable and valid is asking people about their childhood", and the psychoanalyst Irving Bieber described Bell et al.′s findings as [...] "totally disparate" [...] with his experience from psychiatric consultation.|$|E
