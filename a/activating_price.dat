30|$|The {{different}} regulatory {{scenarios are}} implemented by adapting the lower and {{upper price limit}} of the agents’ pricing strategy according to the regulatory scenario (cf. Table  1). The interaction scenarios are realized through enabling (disabling) the pricing and DR shifting functions for the agents according to the targeted interaction scenario. For the base scenario, neither the pricing function nor the DR shifting function are enabled. The trading scenario <b>activates</b> the <b>pricing</b> function. The trading and DR scenario <b>activate</b> both, the <b>pricing</b> and the DR shifting function. For the upper bound scenario, DR shifting is <b>activated,</b> and <b>pricing</b> is enforced. The enforcement of pricing hereby means, that agent bids (offers) are enforced {{to be at the}} maximum (minimum) price limit for each agent. This results in the highest amount of trading that is feasible. We evaluate completed simulation runs over one year with the respective KPIs introduced in section “Key performance indicators”. The KPIs are calculated directly in AnyLogic by an implemented evaluation function.|$|R

40|$|Barrier {{options are}} the most common path-dependent options traded in {{financial}} markets. They are particularly attractive to investors, because not only are they cheaper than vanilla options but they also offer different choices of investment, which allow investors to bet their views on the movement of the underlying asset prices. The “one-touch” breaching barrier however is prone to market manipulations which can be made by influential agents in order to free them from their liabilities to the option holders. Aiming to prevent such market manipulations, Parisian options were introduced, with an extended trigger clause, which makes the knock-in or knock-out feature much harder to be <b>activated.</b> <b>Pricing</b> Parisian options has become an increasingly important problem from both financial and mathematical perspectives. Financially, the introduction of Parisian options, which makes the market fairer {{in the sense that it}} protects the holder of Parisian options from deliberate action taken by the writer, requires an efficient way to precisely evaluate the option prices. On the other hand, due to the presence of the newly-added trigger clause, the valuation of Parisian options becomes a three-dimensional problem, a challenging problem, which has hindered the application of various mathematical methods. In this thesis, we explore the integral equation method and the “moving window” technique to price different types of Parisian options under the Black-Scholes framework...|$|R

An 8 % price limit was imposed in August 1992 and remained in place until February 2000. The sample consists of 114 shares traded on the ASE for the period 1995 - 1998. An event study methodology is used in which the event is defined as an increase or decrease in the stock <b>price</b> that <b>activates</b> the <b>price</b> limit for one, two or three days. The findings confirm the occurrence of short-term overreactions on the ASE during the period under investigation. ...|$|R

Using event-related fMRI, we investigated how people weigh these factors to make purchasing decisions. Consistent with neuroimaging evidence suggesting that distinct circuits anticipate gain and loss, product preference activated the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), while excessive <b>prices</b> <b>activated</b> the insula and deactivated the mesial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) prior to the purchase decision. Activity from each of these regions independently predicted immediately subsequent purchases above and beyond self-report variables. These findings suggest that activation of distinct neural circuits related to anticipatory affect precedes and supports consumers' purchasing decisions...|$|R

Although broad consensus has been reached regarding replacing all nontariff trade barriers with "equivalent tariffs," agreement on the questions of domestic farm policy reforms and access to domestic markets by exporting countries has not yet been reached.

5000|$|The {{advantage}} of using persulfate is that persulfate {{is much more}} stable than either hydrogen peroxide or ozone above the surface {{and it does not}} react quickly by nature. This means fewer transportation limitations, it can be injected into the site of contamination at high concentrations, and can be transported through porous media by density driven diffusion. The disadvantage is that this is an emerging field of technology and {{there are only a few}} reports of testing it in the field [...] and more research needs to be done with it. Additionally, each mole of persulfate creates one mole of oxidizer (sulfate radical or hydroxyl radical). These radicals have low atomic weights while the persulfate molecule has a high atomic weight (238). Therefore, the value (oxidizer produced when persulfate is <b>activated)</b> for expense (<b>price</b> of relatively heavy persulfate molecule) is low compared to some other oxidizing reagents.|$|R
40|$|Introduction Parisian {{options are}} barrier options {{for which the}} knock-in/knock-out feature is only <b>activated</b> after the <b>price</b> process has spent a certain prescribed, {{consecutive}} time beyond the barrier. This specification has two motivations: First, there {{is the need to}} make the option more robust against short-term movements of the share price. This is achieved in Parisian options where it is ensured that a single outlier cannot trigger the barrier. In particular, it is far harder to a#ect the triggering of the barrier by manipulation of the underlying (see Taleb [4]). Second, classical barrier options present hedging problems close to the barrier because their Gamma becomes very large. To some extent, these problems are reduced, or at least `smoothed', in the Parisian contract. We present a flexible approach to valuing such options using the numerical solution of a partial di#erential equation. This approach can price a variety of modifications of the basic Parisian contrac...|$|R

40|$|The Black-Scholes-Merton formula {{has been}} put to {{widespread}} use by options traders because it provides a means of calculating the theoretically 'correct' price of stock options. Traders can therefore see whether the market price of stock options undervalues or overvalues them compared with their hypothetical Black-Scholes-Merton price, before choosing {{to buy or sell}} options accordingly. As a consequence of this close relationship between options pricing theory and options pricing practice, a strong performativity loop was <b>activated,</b> whereby market <b>prices</b> quickly converged on the hypothetical Black-Scholes-Merton prices following the dissemination of the formula. The theory has therefore had significant real-world effects, but how should we characterize the initial instinct to derive the theory from a philosophy of science perspective? The two books under review suggest that a Kuhnian reading of the advancement of scientific knowledge might well be the most appropriate. But, on closer inspection, it becomes clear that the publication of the Black-Scholes-Merton formula should not be seen as a Kuhnian moment with paradigm-shaping attributes. It is shown that, at most, the formula acts as an important exemplar which, via its use in the training of options pricing theorists and options pricing practitioners, reinforces the entrenchment of finance theory within the orthodox economics worldview...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this trial}} was to produce activated charcoal from 5 raw material species which are abundantly potential. The production was conducted in an experimentally designed kiln, expectedly appropriate as a manufacturing prototype of activated charcoal for the inherent endeavors or small-scale village industries, which would be feasible technically, economically, and environmentally. The parameters related to the technical analysis covered the manufacture of charcoal from three wood species (bakau, mangium, and tusam) and coconut shell; analysis on raw material for such charcoal and on the mixed charcoal from the market; activation process using water vapor and air at consecutively 0. 25 bar and 4 - 5 atmospheric pressures, with the temperature as high as 705 - 805 °C; and analysis on iod number {{for the quality of}} activated charcoal. For economic evaluation, the inherent parameters covered production cost, <b>activated</b> charcoal <b>price,</b> and other related aspects. For the comparative assessments were used activated charcoals from sawdust and coconut shell from industry. The results are as follows:The yields of resulting activated charcoal were varying, i. e 77 % from mangrove charcoal as the highest, followed in decreasing order at 73 % from coconut shell charcoal, 66 % from both mangium and mixed charcoal, until 58 % from tusam charcoal as the lowest. lod number of activated charcoal ranged between 472 - 722 mg/g, with the one from coconut shell charcoal as the highest and the mangrove charcoal as the lowest. The increase of iod number in coconut shell activated charcoal was the highest with six times higher in comparison to the one in its regular charcoal, followed in decreasing order by those mixed charcoal, tusam charcoal. until mangrove charcoal as well as mangium charcoal as the lowest (i. e consecutively 3. 98 times, 3. 39 times and 2. 45 limes). Compared to the Indonesian requirement standard for activated charcoal, such production trial of activated charcoal seemed to be insatis factory. This is caused by overall iod numbers which were still below 750 mg/g. However, the iod number in activated charcoal from coconut shell in this trial was still higher than the one in the corresponding activated charcoal produced commercial industries (i. e 722 mg/g). Meanwhile, the iod number in activated charcoal from mixed charcoal (654 mg/g) was lower, but still higher than those from tusam and mangium. The retort for the production trial activated charcoal was constructed of stainless steel reactor with 120 liter volumetric capacity and capable of producing 10 kg per day, using regular charcoal as raw material and firewood as a fuel. This retort was designed as a prototype model for the production of activated charcoal for small-scale industries. The method of production expectedly will not bring about enviromental impacts, since the generated vapour/gas during the activation was immediately incinerated in the fuelwood fire pol. The analysis revealed that the production using coconut shell charcoal as raw material in the retort with design capacity of 250 kg per month and 5 years technical life could be sold at Rp 6, 000. - per kg of activated charcoal and therefore could bring in some net benefit at 5. 5 %. Activated charcoal production using mixed wood charcoal did not give significant any benefit. The benefit of activated charcoal production using coconut shell in that period would be even higher...|$|R
40|$|Financial {{stress in}} the dairy {{industry}} in 2009, brought on largely by sharply lower milk <b>prices,</b> <b>activated</b> standing federal programs to support dairy farmers. In calendar year 2009, the federal government spent more than $ 1 billion to support the industry through the Milk Income Loss Contract (MILC) Program, the Dairy Product Price Support Program (DPPSP), and the Dairy Export Incentive Program (DEIP). Following appeals from dairy farmers for more financial assistance, Congress granted another $ 350 million in October 2009 {{in the form of}} supplemental payments to dairy farmers and government purchases of dairy products. While farm milk prices have increased since summer 2009, the financial stress seen throughout the year and similar previous episodes have led the industry and Congress to reconsider how to deal with fluctuations in milk prices and financial prospects for dairy farmers. Some Members have voiced interest in developing alternatives to current polices and incorporating them as part of the next omnibus farm bill in 2011 - 2012. The dairy industry is currently developing or advocating a variety of policy changes in response to the difficult financial situation affecting dairy farmers beginning in late 2008. All of the proposals discussed in this report—loosely categorized as either supply management, marketbased, or tiered-pricing—have implications for U. S. dairy farmers, competitiveness of the U. S. dairy industry, and international trade. Under supply management, H. R. 5288 and S. 3531 are designed to prevent depressed farm milk prices while reducing price volatility through supply management. The National Milk Producers Federation (NMPF) has also proposed a market stabilization component as part of its comprehensive package of suggested reforms to dairy policy. Supporters of price stabilization and supply management say that inherent incentives to overproduce need to be offset by a program to manage supplies in a measured way. Critics of supply management, including dairy processors, contend that such measures could reduce the competitiveness of the U. S. dairy industry, limit its incentive to innovate, and raise consumer prices, because, they argue, a pricing system based on supply control and/or cost of production potentially rewards inefficiency. The market-based approach, including a separate element of the NMPF package, represents an opposing view on how the federal government should address the problem of farm milk price volatility and periodic financial stress for dairy farmers. This approach contends that, because it is difficult to manage milk supplies and prices administratively, the best approach is to provide a government program that helps farmers manage risk associated with volatile prices of milk and feed. Specifically, a new “safety net” would be established to protect a dairy farmer’s “margin”— that is, the farm price of milk minus feed costs—regardless of current price levels. Critics expect that incentives to overproduce will aggravate the financial woes of the dairy industry indefinitely, and thus argue that controlling potential price variability and combating depressed farm prices with supply management is necessary for the long-term financial health of producers. The third area of potential policy change is to alter the current pricing approach used in federal milk marketing orders (FMMOs) to directly increase dairy farm revenue. For example, one proposed change to base milk pricing in FMMOs on the cost of milk production (S. 1645) would imply higher prices received by dairy farmers. However, some are concerned that the long-run competitiveness and stability of the U. S. dairy industry could be at risk because of the unknown effectiveness of provisions to discourage overproduction...|$|R
