5|$|US40 {{followed}} {{the route of}} the National Road through Pennsylvania and Maryland. The National Road was the first federally funded road built in the United States, authorized by Congress in 1806. Construction lasted from 1811 to 1837, establishing <b>a</b> <b>road</b> <b>that</b> extended from Cumberland to Vandalia, Illinois. Upon the establishment of the U.S. Highway System in 1926, {{the route of the}} National Road became part of US40.|$|E

5|$|M-124 {{is a state}} {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the Lower Peninsula of the US state of Michigan that runs {{on the north side}} of Vineyard and Wamplers lakes near Brooklyn in Jackson County near the Irish Hills area. The highway travels directly through W. J. Hayes State Park before ending in Lenawee County. The designation was created in 1929 for <b>a</b> <b>road</b> <b>that</b> accessed the state park, connecting it to US Highway 112 (US112, now US12). It was later extended westward to M-50 in Brooklyn in the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|Route 37 was {{proposed}} in the late 1960s as a freeway that was to run from Route 29 in the Trenton area to Seaside Heights. It was suggested that this freeway be completed by 1975 in order to handle a rapid growth of population in Central New Jersey. In 1967, this proposal was altered to build <b>a</b> <b>road</b> <b>that</b> compromised with the proposed Route 38 freeway between Camden and Wall Township. It soon received federal funding and was built as Interstate 195, running from Trenton to Wall Township.|$|E
5|$|State Highway 168 {{was first}} {{proposed}} in 1931-1932, traveling from Campbellton in Atascosia County northeastward to Floresville in Wilson County before bending further eastward and terminating at SH 81. The proposal {{was listed as}} a conditional designation, meaning {{that it would not}} be maintained by the State Highway Commission. However, in late 1933, the portion from Campbellton to Floresville was cancelled, and SH 168 was rerouted to Pleasanton. As a result, SH 168 was cancelled and transferred to an extended SH 97. On September 26, 1939, SH 87 was designated to <b>a</b> <b>road</b> <b>that</b> followed the general course of present-day SH 168.|$|E

From here, the route turns northwest and crosses CR543 before heading through a mix of farm fields and suburban residential neighborhoods. Past the intersection with White Pine Road, Route 68 passes in between two large auto auction lots. The route terminates at an intersection with US206 located a short distance south of that route's interchange with the New Jersey Turnpike (Interstate 95). Route 68 serves as the main access route between Fort Dix and the New Jersey Turnpike.|$|E
5|$|What is now Route 44 was {{originally}} legislated as Route 17S in 1923, a route {{that was to}} run from Penns Grove to Westville. By 1927, however, the only portion of Route 17S that had existed was <b>a</b> <b>road</b> <b>that</b> ran from Penns Grove south to Salem. In the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering that occurred that year, Route 44 was designated to run from Penns Grove to Westville, replacing what had been legislated as Route 17S. By {{the end of the}} 1930s, Route 44 was extended south from Penns Grove to Salem and US 130 was also designated along with Route 44 north of Penns Grove by 1941.|$|E
5|$|Following this exit, {{the road}} becomes eight lanes again and crosses over the Bronx River Parkway, the Bronx River, and Metro-North Railroad's Harlem Line. Here, the road crosses into White Plains and reaches an {{interchange}} with NY22. Past NY22, I-287 makes a sharp curve {{to the south}} as it narrows to six lanes and runs near inhabited neighborhoods. The road has a westbound exit and eastbound entrance with the Central Westchester Parkway, <b>a</b> <b>road</b> <b>that</b> provides access to the Taconic State Parkway by way of NY22. The freeway runs past commercial areas {{to the east of}} downtown White Plains as it encounters Westchester Avenue, which connects to NY119, NY127, and Anderson Hill Road as well as The Westchester shopping mall in the downtown area. Within this interchange, the Cross-Westchester Expressway turns east along the border between Harrison to the north and White Plains to the south. Westchester Avenue becomes a frontage road for I-287 as the road passes corporate parks to the north and populated neighborhoods to the south.|$|E

5|$|Garfield {{during this}} time {{purchased}} the property in Mentor that reporters later dubbed Lawnfield, and from which he would conduct the first successful front porch campaign for the presidency. Hayes suggested that Garfield run for governor in 1879, seeing that as <b>a</b> <b>road</b> <b>that</b> would likely put Garfield in the White House. Garfield preferred to seek election as senator, and devoted his efforts to seeing that Republicans won the 1879 election for the General Assembly, with the likely Democratic candidate the incumbent, Allen G. Thurman. The Republicans swept the legislative elections. Rivals were spoken of for the seat, such as Secretary Sherman, but he had presidential ambitions (for which he sought Garfield's support), and other candidates fell by the wayside. Garfield {{was elected to the}} Senate by the General Assembly in January 1880, though his term was not to begin until March 4, 1881.|$|E
5|$|I-370 {{begins a}} short {{distance}} {{to the west of}} the I-270 interchange in Gaithersburg, Montgomery County, heading northeast as a six-lane freeway. Southwest of this interchange, the road continues as Sam Eig Highway (named after Washington real estate developer Sam Eig) which interchanges with Washingtonian Boulevard before becoming a surface road. The highway passes woods to the northwest and a shopping center to the southeast as it reaches an interchange with I-270. From this point, I-370 turns east and runs between residential neighborhoods to the north and business parks to the south, with trees separating the road from these areas. The freeway curves northeast again and comes to the MD 355 interchange. Past this, the highway passes more commercial development before reaching a bridge over CSX's Metropolitan Subdivision. A short distance later, I-370 comes to a trumpet interchange with MD 200A, <b>a</b> <b>road</b> <b>that</b> provides access to Shady Grove Road and the Shady Grove station of Washington Metro's Red Line. At this point, I-370 ends and the freeway continues east as MD 200 (Intercounty Connector).|$|E
5|$|In 1911, Georgia Avenue was {{proposed}} {{as a state}} highway between the Washington, D.C. border and Brookeville. This section of state highway was completed by 1915. By 1921, a state highway {{was proposed}} between Roxbury Mills and Cooksville, with a small piece completed {{to the south of}} Cooksville. Also, a state highway was completed between Westminster and the Pennsylvania border, connecting to <b>a</b> <b>road</b> <b>that</b> continued northwest to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. By 1923, the state road was finished between south of Cooksville and north of Roxbury Mills and to the north of Cooksville. With the creation of the U.S. Highway System on November 11, 1926, the portion of present-day MD 97 north of Westminster was designated as part of US 140, a U.S. Highway that ran from Baltimore to Gettysburg. In addition, the portion of Georgia Avenue between Norbeck and Olney was designated as part of MD 28 in 1927. The state highway was completed south to Roxbury Mills in 1928. By 1933, the state road between Brookeville and Roxbury Mills was finished.|$|E

5|$|Much of DE 9 is {{designated}} {{as part of}} the Delaware Byways system. From the southern terminus north to New Castle, DE 9 is {{designated as}} the Delaware's Bayshore Byway (formerly Route 9 Coastal Heritage Byway), <b>a</b> <b>road</b> <b>that</b> is noted for following the Delaware River and Delaware Bay shoreline. The sections of the route between DE 299 east of Odessa and 7th Street southwest of New Castle, Wilmington Road north of New Castle and A Street in Wilmington, and along 4th Street in Wilmington between Swedes Landing Road and US 13 Bus. and Market and West streets are part of the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad Byway. DE9 has an annual average daily traffic count ranging from a high of 19,064vehicles at the intersection between East 6th Street and New Castle Avenue in New Castle to a low of 258vehicles at the intersection with Cedar Swamp Road in southeastern New Castle County. The portion of DE9 concurrent with DE 273 is part of the National Highway System.|$|E
5|$|US 13 was {{designated}} through Maryland when the U.S. Highway System {{was established in}} 1926, running along existing roads. It formed {{a part of the}} Ocean Highway, <b>a</b> <b>road</b> <b>that</b> connected the New York City area to Florida, and still carries that name for much of its route in Maryland. Many realignments of the route occurred over the years. The route was realigned between Princess Anne and Fruitland in 1933 and between Westover and Princess Anne in 1935. Between 1938 and 1942, Salisbury Boulevard was built to carry US 13 through Salisbury; the route previously followed Camden Avenue and Division Street. In the 1950s, portions of the route were widened to a divided highway and a bypass of Delmar was built. US 13 was rerouted to bypass Princess Anne in 1959 and Pocomoke City in 1963. The remainder of US 13 in Maryland was widened into a divided highway in the 1960s. In 1973, construction began to build the limited-access Salisbury Bypass to the east of the city. US 13 was moved onto the completed Salisbury Bypass in 1981.|$|E
5|$|What is modern-day Route 124 was {{designated}} {{as a part of}} pre-1927 Route 5, a route that was legislated in 1916 to run from Delaware in Warren County east to Newark. In the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering, this portion of pre-1927 Route 5 became a part of Route 24, <b>a</b> <b>road</b> <b>that</b> was to run from Phillipsburg to Newark. In the 1950s, plans were made to bypass this portion of Route 24 with a freeway running from Interstate 287 in Hanover Township to Interstate 78 in Springfield Township; this was approved of in 1960. This freeway was completed between Interstate 78 and the John F. Kennedy Parkway in 1972. The Route 24 designation was moved to the new freeway and Route 124 {{was designated}} along the former alignment of Route 24 east of this point, which included frontage roads built where the new freeway ran along the old alignment of the road. Following the completion of the Route 24 freeway to Interstate 287 in 1992, Route 124 was extended west along the former alignment of Route 24 between the John F. Kennedy Parkway and U.S. Route 202 in Morristown. In 2002, maintenance of the portion of Route 124 in Maplewood was transferred to the municipality from the New Jersey Department of Transportation.|$|E
