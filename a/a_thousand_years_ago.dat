The Thule people were more technologically advanced than their Dorset predecessors, although they still relied on subsistence hunting, with walruses, reindeer, and particularly the fur seals constituting the base of the economy in the early period.|$|E

When settled agriculture arrived in its range about <b>a</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> it adapted to cultivated land, and since the arrival of settlement, it has moved into towns. The Cape sparrow prefers habitats with an annual rainfall of less than , though in desert areas it is usually found near watercourses or watering holes. While it occurs in urban centres, it prefers parks, gardens, and other open spaces, and has a low reproductive success in more built-up areas.|$|E

The most ancient mask is supposedly kept as a hidden treasure by the oldest school, the Konparu. According to the current head of the Konparu school, the mask was carved by the legendary regent Prince Shōtoku (572-622) over <b>a</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> While the historical accuracy of the legend of Prince Shōtoku's mask may be contested, the legend itself is ancient as it is first recorded in Zeami's Style and the Flower written in the 14th century.|$|E

5|$|As Captain Picard and Commander Data (Brent Spiner) {{discuss the}} matter with the Ventaxian leader (Marcelo Tubert), a woman appears in the chamber, announcing herself as Ardra. She proves her {{identity}} by starting an earthquake at will, and transforming into both the Christian and then the Klingon devil. Ardra states that {{she has come to}} claim the planet. Picard is instantly suspicious and orders Data to examine the contract that supposedly was signed by Ardra and the leaders of the planet <b>a</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> Picard returns to the Enterprise afterwards, and Ardra appears on the bridge sitting in the Captain's chair. Security Chief Worf (Michael Dorn) tries to remove her without success, Data returns just then and confirms the language of the contract as well as Ardra's claim to the planet, including anything in orbit, including the Enterprise.|$|E
5|$|The USS Enterprise {{receives}} a distress call from Dr. Howard Clarke (Paul Lambert), {{the leader of}} a Federation scientific delegation on Ventax II, where the population {{is in a state of}} panic because they are convinced that their world will soon end. After the Enterprise arrives, they rescue Dr. Clarke who brings them up to date: <b>a</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> according to Ventaxian history, the population entered a Faustian deal with Ardra, their mythology's devil. In exchange for ending wars and restoring the ecological balance, and improving their heavily polluted planet, the population would become the personal slaves of Ardra a thousand years later. As the millennium is about to come to a close, the planet has recently begun experiencing mild earthquakes as well as seeing images of Ardra in the skies. These were said to be signs of her arrival.|$|E

25|$|Heligoland's rock is {{significantly}} {{harder than the}} postglacial sediments and sands forming the islands and coastlines {{to the east of}} the island. This is why the core of the island, which <b>a</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> was still surrounded by a large, low-lying marshland and sand dunes separated from coast in the east only by narrow channels, has remained to this day, although the onset of the North Sea has long eroded away all of its surroundings. A small piece of Heligoland's sand dunes remains—the sand isle just across the harbour called Düne (Dune). A referendum in June 2011 dismissed a proposal to reconnect the main island to the Düne islet with a landfill.|$|E
25|$|The Imperial {{patronage}} {{promoted the}} art of making elaborate cricket containers and individual cricket homes. Traditional Chinese cricket homes come in three distinct shapes: wooden cages, ceramic jars, and gourds. Cages are used primarily for trapping and transportation. Gourds and ceramic jars are used as permanent cricket homes in winter and summer, respectively. They are treated with special mortar to enhance the apparent loudness and tone of a cricket's song. The imperial gardeners grew custom-shaped molded gourds tailored to each species of cricket. Their trade secrets were lost during the Chinese Civil War and the Cultural Revolution, but crickets remain a favorite pet of the Chinese to the present day. The Japanese pet cricket culture, which emerged at least <b>a</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> has practically vanished during the 20th century.|$|E
