5|$|As {{the club}} was {{dissatisfied}} with this arrangement, it launched plans to establish its own venues. First it needed to secure a lot, and in the late 1920s lied its eyes on a parcel of land owned by Hamar Jernstøperi. However, the lot was sold to Oplandske Kreditbank in 1930 and the club had to negotiate purchasing the lot from the bank. The club established a new committee {{to look into the}} stadium issue. Hamar IL was invited to become part-owner of the venue, but they chose to remain at Hamar stadion. As Briskebyen was not able to secure <b>a</b> <b>partner</b> <b>to</b> share the costs with, opposition towards the project grew within the club. Yet, the decision to build the venue was taken by Briskebyen FL's annual meeting on 15 April 1934, with construction starting on 26 April.|$|E

Satisfied that he is lying, the pair prepare to leave. Scully looks back at Boggs and sees another vision of her father, {{speaking}} to her and singing the song that had been played at his funeral, [...] "Beyond the Sea". She does not tell Mulder about this, and the pair discuss the possibility that Boggs has orchestrated the kidnapping with <b>a</b> <b>partner</b> <b>to</b> avoid execution. They have a fake newspaper made which declares the couple to have been found, hoping to trick Boggs into contacting his accomplice. He does not fall for the trick, but gives the agents vague clues about the case.

The girl is rescued, but the kidnapper shoots Mulder and escapes with the boyfriend.|$|E
500|$|For {{months prior}} to the pay-per-view, Hulk Hogan and undisputed WWF Heavyweight Champion Randy Savage, two of the WWF's top crowd favorites, had feuded with André the Giant and Ted DiBiase, respectively. The two feuds first came {{together}} at WrestleMania IV, when—as the result of the vacating of the WWF Heavyweight Championship—a 14-man single-elimination tournament was set up to crown a new champion. Hogan and André had been disqualified in their quarterfinal match, while Savage and DiBiase reached the championship match; in that final match, Savage defeated DiBiase with help from Hogan. Savage and DiBiase feuded over the title throughout the spring and summer, but André did not become involved until mid-summer when he and DiBiase helped instigate a 2-on-1 attack against Savage as he was delivering a promo. Savage quickly recovered and challenged André and DiBiase to a tag team match against him and <b>a</b> <b>partner</b> <b>to</b> be named. That partner later was revealed to be Hogan; the team became known as [...] "The Mega Powers." [...] The André-DiBiase team—which dubbed itself [...] "The Mega Bucks"—retaliated by announcing the guest referee would be someone they declared to be fair and neutral: Jesse Ventura, a color commentator on the WWF's programs who favored the villains, though according to the main storyline, Ventura was chosen by WWF President Jack Tunney as the only person capable of handling such a match.|$|E

500|$|After {{the concept}} was put into the {{pipeline}} for production, General Motors began looking for <b>a</b> <b>partner</b> <b>to</b> develop the Volt's lithium-ion battery pack. The carmaker evaluated about twenty-five different battery cell chemistries and constructions from around two dozen lithium-ion battery makers around the world. Due to their more promising cell technologies, two companies were selected in June 2007, Compact Power (CPI), which uses a lithium manganese oxide (LiMn2O4) cell made by its parent company, LG Chemical; and Continental Automotive Systems, which uses lithium iron phosphate based cylindrical cells made by A123Systems. By the end of October 2007 CPI (LG Chem) delivered their finished battery pack prototypes, and A123 delivered theirs by January 2008. General Motors testing process was conducted at the laboratory the carmaker had created for the GM EV1 program. The battery packs included monitoring systems designed to keep the batteries cool and operating at optimum capacity despite {{a wide range of}} ambient temperatures. In order to make sure the battery pack would last ten years and [...] expected for the battery warranty, the Volt team decided to use only half of the 16 [...] capacity to reduce the rate of capacity degradation, limiting the state of charge (SOC) up to 80% of capacity and never depleting the battery below 30%. General Motors also was expecting the battery could withstand 5,000 full discharges without losing more than 10% of its charge capacity. According to GM, , no batteries have been changed due to degradation.|$|E

This study examines interpersonal interaction {{and the effects}} of likeability on two attributes that are central to many organizations: commodity prices as negotiation outcomes and <b>a</b> <b>partner's</b> willingness <b>to</b> engage in collaboration. Specifically, we aim to answer: how does interpersonal likeability impact negotiation outcomes in terms of commodity prices and how does it affect <b>a</b> <b>partner's</b> willingness <b>to</b> engage in collaboration? Based on social exchange theory we draw hypotheses that are tested using data gathered from experiments with 220 participants. The findings indicate that likeability significantly influences <b>a</b> <b>partner's</b> willingness <b>to</b> engage in collaboration but does not significantly influence negotiation profits. The implications of these findings for research and practice are discussed...|$|R
