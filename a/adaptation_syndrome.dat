25|$|The {{most common}} problem {{experienced}} by humans {{in the initial}} hours of weightlessness is known as space <b>adaptation</b> <b>syndrome</b> or SAS, {{commonly referred to as}} space sickness. It is related to motion sickness, and arises as the vestibular system adapts to weightlessness. Symptoms of SAS include nausea and vomiting, vertigo, headaches, lethargy, and overall malaise. The first case of SAS was reported by cosmonaut Gherman Titov in 1961. Since then, roughly 45% of all people who have flown in space have suffered from this condition. The duration of space sickness varies, but rarely has it lasted for more than 72 hours, after which the body adjusts to the new environment.|$|E
25|$|The {{process whereby}} {{the human body}} {{responds}} to extended stress is known as general <b>adaptation</b> <b>syndrome</b> (GAS). After the initial fight-or-flight response, the body becomes more resistant to stress {{in an attempt to}} dampen the sympathetic nervous response and return to homeostasis. During this period of resistance, physical and mental symptoms of CSR may be drastically reduced as the body attempts to cope with the stress. Long combat involvement, however, may keep the body from homeostasis and thereby deplete its resources and render it unable to normally function, sending it into the third stage of GAS: exhaustion. Sympathetic nervous activation remains in the exhaustion phase and reactions to stress are markedly sensitized as fight-or-flight symptoms return. If the body remains in a state of stress, then such more severe symptoms of CSR as cardiovascular and digestive involvement may present themselves. Extended exhaustion can permanently damage the body.|$|E
40|$|Physical {{therapists}} commonly associate lateral pelvic tilt (LPT) with {{a variety}} of musculoskeletal <b>adaptations,</b> <b>syndromes</b> and altered function. Such musculoskeletal adaptations have been suggested in many reports to cause unequal sitting pressure distribution (SPD) at the buttock/chair interface. However, those reports have failed to provide objective evidence to support that hypothesis. This study was conducted {{to examine the relationship between}} LPT and SPD in a sample of healthy female volunteers. Subjects were tested for pelvic symmetry using an anthropometric frame, then assigned to two groups: symmetrical (n = 36) and LPT (n = 9). SPD was measured in an upright sitting posture using an interface pressure mat. Although the results indicated that there were no significant differences between the two groups in the magnitude and position of the peak pressure, there was a greater variability among subjects in the LPT group than the symmetrical group. This observation is worth further investigation as it tends to indicate that persons with LPT are less likely able to maintain a steady sitting position...|$|R

40|$|The {{pulmonary}} circulation {{is the only}} system in the body which {{does not have a}} dress rehearsal in utero.

25|$|Short-term {{exposure}} to microgravity causes space <b>adaptation</b> <b>syndrome,</b> a self-limiting nausea caused by derangement of the vestibular system. Long-term exposure causes multiple health problems, {{one of the}} most significant being loss of bone and muscle mass. Over time these deconditioning effects can impair astronauts' performance, increase their risk of injury, reduce their aerobic capacity, and slow down their cardiovascular system. As the human body consists mostly of fluids, gravity tends to force them into the lower half of the body, and our bodies have many systems to balance this situation. When released from the pull of gravity, these systems continue to work, causing a general redistribution of fluids into the upper half of the body. This is the cause of the round-faced 'puffiness' seen in astronauts. Redistributing fluids around the body itself causes balance disorders, distorted vision, and a loss of taste and smell.|$|E

40|$|Nitrogen {{and carbon}} {{contents}} of fine roots were studied for 92 alpine plant {{species in the}} Northwest Caucasus. Nitrogen content ranged from 0. 43 % (Bromus variegatus) to 3. 75 % (Corydalis conorhiza) with mean value 1. 3 %. Carbon content ranged from 40. 3 % (Corydalis conorhiza) to 51. 7 % (Empetrum nigrum) with mean value 43. 4 %. C:N ratio {{was found to be}} 34 : 1 which is higher than the worldwide mean. Eudicot's roots had higher N concentration (1. 37 +/- 0. 07) than monocot's ones (0. 95 +/- 0. 09). Among the life forms, carbon content increased in the following order: geophytes < hemicriptophytes < chamaephytes. Specific root length positively correlated with nitrogen root content and negatively [...] with carbon root content. Species with larger leaves and higher specific root area had more nitrogen and less carbon in roots in comparison with species with small leaves. There were positive correlations between leaf and root nitrogen, as well as carbon, contents. Regrowth rate; seed size, aboveground biomass, and vegetation mobility were not related with root nitrogen content. Our results corroborate the poor and rich soil <b>adaptation</b> <b>syndromes.</b> Species of competitive and ruderal (sensu Grime) strategies are more typical for alpine meadows and snow bed communities. They had higher nitrogen contents in leaves and roots, larger leaves with higher water content and higher rate of seed production.

40|$|Sleep apnoea {{syndrome}} {{is associated with}} cardiovascular morbidity, but it is less clear if {{it is also associated}} with increased mortality. Studies investigating mortality in sleep apnoea have 1) compared mortality rates of patients with different levels of severity of the syndrome relying on sleep laboratory populations, 2) compared treated and untreated patients, 3) examined the effect of co-existing cardiovascular diseases on survival and 4) investigated the effect of sleep-disordered breathing on mortality in the elderly. In spite of methodological limitations, the accumulated data generally support an increased risk of mortality in patients with severe sleep apnoea in comparison with mild or no sleep apnoea, and indicate that efficient treatment decreases mortality. Surprisingly, several {{studies have shown that the}} highest risk of mortality in sleep apnoea occurs in patients younger than 50 yrs of age, that risk tends to decline with age and that the occurrence of disordered breathing in sleep in the elderly does not affect mortality. It is as yet unclear if this finding represents a selection bias, differences in apnoea severity or in compliance with treatment between young and old patients, or an <b>adaptation</b> to the <b>syndrome</b> with age. There is conflicting evidence as to whether the occurrence of sleep apnoea in patients with existing cardiovascular diseases increases the risk of mortality beyond that associated with the cardiovascular diseases themselves...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In past decades, the European Mediterranean has {{undergone}} widespread land use transformations. These are largely driven by changes of socio-economic frameworks, such as accession to the European Community, and had strong {{effects on the}} way the land is being used. Aiming at a systematic description of change processes on a global level, the syndrome concept was proposed to describe archetypical, co-evolutionary patterns of civilization-nature interactions (Schellnhuber et al. 1997), and has been specifically linked to the desertification issue by Downing and LUdeke (2002). In this study, we present an <b>adaptation</b> of the <b>syndrome</b> approach to the Iberian Peninsula. We suggest a data processing and interpretation framework to map the spatial extension of specific syndromes for areas occupied by natural and semi-natural vegetation. The mapping approach is based on the time series analysis of satellite data. We have characterized vegetation dynamics using NDVI estimates from the coarse scale, hypertemporal 1 km MEDOKADS archive, which is based on calibrated NOAA-AVHRR images. Results indicate that local patches of abrupt disturbance, mainly by fire, are contrasted by a widespread increase in biomass, which is in large parts attributed to the abandonment of rural areas. Although this questions the dominance of classical desertification traits, i. e. decline after disturbance, it is concluded that the recent greening presents a new degradation phenomenon as it may negatively impact on fire regimes and the hydrological cycle.

40|$|Background: Heroin {{addiction}} {{is a condition}} with high morbidity and mortality. The discovery of Methadone Maintenance Treatment (MMT) by Dole and co-workers 1964 represented the first major advance {{in the treatment of}} this condition. Through the work of Gunne et al in Uppsala, MMT was implemented in Sweden already in 1966. The use of this treatment has, however, been limited in Sweden. Some of the concerns have been related to safety issues. Methadone, a full opiate agonist, can lead to overdose and death due to respiratory depression. Buprenorphine, a partial opiate agonist, has a greater safety margin to overdosing, and therefore offers a safer alternative. Here, we studied efficacy of buprenorphine maintenance treatment (BMT) {{in the context of a}} comprehensive treatment package, and its place in a rational treatment strategy vs. methadone. We also examined the effects of buprenorphine on neuroendocrine hyperactivity in heroin addiction. Finally, we compared pregnancy outcomes in MMT and BMT pregnancies. Aims: The following research questions were addressed: the efficacy of buprenorphine combined with psychosocial interventions; a comparison between gold standard MMT and a novel stepped treatment strategy using buprenorphine as first-line treatment; whether BMT leads to a normalization of the hyperactive HPA axis, and the possible link to negative affect; a comparison of fetal growth and neonatal outcomes in two consecutive case series consisting of BMT and MMT exposed pregnancies. Methods: In two RCTs, with 40 subjects in study I and 96 subjects in study II, we measured retention in treatment, performed ASI interviews, and monitored illicit drug use by urine screens. In an experimental study, we used the metyrapone challenge (a chemically induced indirect stress provocation that measures HPA axis responsiveness), the Profile of Mood States self-report instrument and genotyping. The observational pregnancy study measured intrauterine growth, birth outcome, malformations, neonatal <b>adaptation,</b> neonatal abstinence <b>syndrome</b> (NAS) and infant mortality. Results: Study I: 1 -year retention was 75 % and 0 % in the buprenorphine and placebo groups, respectively (p= 0. 0001). Urine screens were about 75 % negative for illicit drugs in the patients remaining in treatment (subjects in buprenorphine group). Study II: Overall, 6 -month retention was 78 %. Stepped treatment and enhanced MMT outcomes were virtually identical. Among completers of stepped treatment, 46 % remained on buprenorphine-naloxone. Proportion of urine samples free of illicit opiates increased over time and reached approximately 80 % in both arms. Problem severity decreased significantly and uniformly in both arms. Study III: Although BMT appeared to normalize HPA axis response to metyrapone in heroin addicts, negative affect remained elevated in this group compared to healthy controls. Study IV: In the buprenorphine-exposed pregnancies NAS occurred in 19 cases (40. 4 %), only 7 (14. 9 %) needing withdrawal treatment, compared to 77. 8 % and 52. 8 % after intrauterine methadone exposure, respectively. Conclusions: The combination of buprenorphine and intensive psychosocial treatment is safe and highly efficacious. A stepped treatment of heroin addiction appears equally efficacious compared to optimally delivered MMT. Together with prior data on the advantageous safety of buprenorphine, this suggests that broad implementation of strategies using buprenorphine as first-line treatment should be considered. Response to metyrapone was dampened in heroin addicts maintained on buprenorphine. Despite the normalized HPA axis function, increased measures of negative affect were seen in the buprenorphine maintained group, implying a dissociation of HPA axis responsiveness and affect in heroin addiction. Finally, our preliminary data suggest that buprenorphine may offer advantages during pregnancies complicated by heroin addiction...|$|R
40|$|Theoretical {{outcomes}} Admission {{of elderly}} people to a retirement home changes their lives in many ways. With regard to these changes, {{it is necessary for}} the senior citizen to adjust effectively to this situation and thus prevent complications related to the so-called maladaption <b>syndrome.</b> <b>Adaptation</b> can be defined as a basic human trait which allows people to survive even extremely difficult situations. It can be divided into several phases. Every elderly person goes through individual phases which sometimes might be linked together and of different length. The whole adaptation process needs to be handled responsibly since the person's future life depends on its progress. Aim of the thesis Aim of the thesis was to determine how nurses can contribute to the course of adaptation process in retirement homes. Research questions How is the nurse's role perceived by the client during the adaptation process? How do the nurses understand their own roles in the adjustment process? Which factors influence the course of the client's adaptation process? What is the role of family in the client's adjustment process to a new environment in retirement homes? What problems does the client newly admitted to a retirement home have to deal with? Methodology The practical part of the Bachelor's thesis was conducted by means of qualitative research survey. The method of collecting data consisted of two variants of a semi-structured interview. The first interview variant was aimed at registered general nurses working in a retirement home. The second interview variant was focused on elderly people living in a retirement home. The first group consisted of eight respondents, seven women and one man. The second group was comprised of seven respondents, five women and two men. All the collected interviews were transcribed and the results were subsequently processed using axial and open coding. Results Based on individual research questions, the results can be divided into several areas. The first part of the results focuses on the role of nurses in the adaptation process as perceived by the client. The results show that clients consider the nurses' role to be very important. The second part informs about the role of nurses in the adaptation process as seen by the nurses themselves. The outcomes indicate that nurses regard their role as vital too. Next, the third part sheds some light on factors that influence the course of adjustment process. Factors that were mentioned most often include changes after admission to the retirement home such as new environment and home regulations, family, nurses, interpersonal relationships and favourite things brought from home. Furthermore, the fourth area describes the importance of family during client's adjustment to the new environment of retirement homes. In this part, the respondents mostly agreed on benefit of family visits. Last, the fifth area identified problems which new clients in retirement homes have to face. A new way of life was described as the most difficult problem, followed by interpersonal relationships (including a new roommate), loss of home and privacy. Conclusion The thesis offers a complex overview of problems related to clients' adjustment to an environment in retirement homes and role of nurses during this process. The results of the thesis {{can be used as a}} teaching resource for students of nursing as well as students of similar backgrounds. Next, the outcomes could be also presented to nurses, caregivers and other workers in a seminar focused on issues related to new clients' adaptation to retirement homes. Moreover, this thesis can also serve as a basis for further research. Last but not least, gerontological nurses might also benefit from information provided in this Bachelor's thesis...|$|R
