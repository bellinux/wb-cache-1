This study analyzes the works of David Rosenmann-Taub (Chile 1927), Jos? Kozer (Cuba 1940), and Jos? Morales Saravia (Per? 1954) to reveal the themes and techniques they utilize as tools in their labors. On the lyrical and literary level, Latin American Language Poetry, Themes and Techniques: A Renewal of Poetic Discourse in Post-Millennium Authors {{provides a}} study of Latin American poetry with works from {{the second half of the}} 20 th and first two decades of the 21 st Centuries. This study analyzes the works of David Rosenmann-Taub (Chile 1927), Jos? Kozer (Cuba 1940), and Jos? Morales Saravia (Per? 1954) to reveal the themes and techniques they utilize as tools in their labors. On the lyrical and literary level, the investigation provides a briefing of sound, identity, and the anabatic or <b>ascension</b> <b>theory</b> in relationship with their works and post-contemporary sociocultural endeavors. Additionally, it focusses on the new approaches and paths they take within their poetic styles and the new elements and components that characterize their works. While these poets are now considered under the Neobaroque style, their approach based on the crafting and molding of language accommodates their works under the umbrella of ?Post-Millenium Latin American Language Poetics. ? This fact renews poetic discourse in the field. The research establishes a theoretical frame to study the themes and techniques. It also presents a descriptive approach along with a concise poetry analysis of several works by the above-mentioned authors and renders a view of their evolution and accessibility of their works...|$|E

Diskalkar believed [...] "Sahavahana" [...] to be a variant of [...] "Chahamana", and identified the defeated king as a Nadol Chahamana ruler. H. V. Trivedi disagreed with this theory, arguing that there is no philological connection between the two words. He theorized that [...] "Sahavahana" [...] is a variant of Satavahana, and may have been used as a generic term for the southern kingdoms (possibly the Western Chalukyas in this case). According to K. N. Seth, Sahavahana might not have been a king at all, as the inscription does not mention his title. He might have been a general of one of Bhoja's rivals, possibly the Kalachuri king Karna.|$|R
40|$|This Manuscript {{on the end}} {{primordial}} calculus {{of mathematics}} is a new discovery of the spiral nature of the entire mathematical grid at 1 : 3 by the precise and absolute concordance of regular number spirals and the Prime number spirals based on numbers and their spaces by grid. It is exclusive to IJAMR which has published 8 papers of the author on this new mathematics.   The manuscript has NOT been offered to any other journal in the world. The editorial board of Princeton University, USA, Annals of mathematics had been duly informed by letter of the new discovery of the concordance of prime numbers spirals with regular number spirals, but {{for the sake of}} fidelity. Mathematics is not complexity, but simplicity, the configuration of 1 is spiral. The relationship between pure mathematical numbers and empty space is a primordial relationship, and well defined by  gaps, plus it has been validated by the author by the Publishing of the pure  continuous  Den-Otter  Prime number sieve at 1 / 6 and 5 / 6 (and 1 / 3 and 2 / 3),and these prime  sieves are reversible. Thus the relationship of the configuration of 1 is in two planes that expand in the frame of (5 / 6 and 1 / 6) and (1 / 3 and 2 / 3) are represented by spiral configuration, expressed  by these  numbers, as in :All prime  numbers spirals are assigned infinitely by the simple - 1 offset of the  two spiral numbers cords 1 / 3 + 2 / 3 = 1 5 / 6 + 1 / 6 = 1 1 / 3 - 1 / 6 = 1 / 6 5 / 6 - 2 / 3 = 1 / 6 1 / 3 + 1 / 6 = 0. 5 5 / 6 + 2 / 3 = 1. 5 1. 5 / 0. 5 = 3 Note: the above is also confirmed by Arabian numerical shown below. Primordial mathematics as created by the creator is absolute and precise whilst the mathematics invented by man is approximate. Current Mathematics of a thousand years has accomplished much by approximate theory, and it is very possible to land {{a man on the moon}} by approximate mathematics, but to precisely understand mass and energy, the nucleus of mass and the vastness of space, one must understand the precise nature and curvature of space. Space and mathematics are curved precisely at 1 : 3 from primordial times(the basis for the π as shown under the publication Unified Theorem), and the warping of space is related to the 1 : 3 separation at precise 19 correct degrees separation and the precise right angled separation at 1 : 3 is at 360 / 19 degrees.   This mathematics is about the curved lay of the grid of mathematics and cannot be understood by the current linear obsession of mathematics, but the readers are immediately referred to the 8 published papers of the author as referenced below. The calculus below virtually negates the current mathematics ideas of linear <b>ascension</b> <b>theories</b> of the past 500 years. This calculus is true for all prime numbers. This involves a precise “combing” of all prime number spirals around a half line. This is clearly and singularly the solution to prime number spiral calculus, which is fairly simple after this discovery. The ruminations of George Riemann and others of the past 500 years in linear ascension mathematics of prime numbers are non- functional irrelevant mathematics, just collateral observations of the correct mathematics which is presented here as “Primum movens” of mathematics. In Mathematics there is only a single best resolution, whilst collateral equations abound, as they have for 500 years for prime numbers which we have proved are basically by two chords and ascend by a half-line. Einstein’s observations and ruminations likewise are collateral and not central to the fact that the universe is precisely curved, and ascension of prime numbers are by two spiral chords.  </p...|$|R
