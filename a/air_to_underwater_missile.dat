5000|$|In the 19th century, mines {{were called}} torpedoes, a name {{probably}} conferred by Robert Fulton after the torpedo fish, which gives powerful electric shocks. A spar torpedo was a mine {{attached to a}} long pole and detonated when the ship carrying it rammed another one and withdrew a safe distance. The submarine [...] used one to sink [...] on 17 February 1864. A Harvey torpedo was a type of floating mine towed alongside a ship, and was briefly in service in the Royal Navy in the 1870s. Other [...] "torpedoes" [...] were attached to ships or propelled themselves. One such weapon, called the Whitehead torpedo after its inventor, caused the word [...] "torpedo" [...] to apply <b>to</b> self-propelled <b>underwater</b> <b>missiles</b> {{as well as to}} static devices. These mobile devices were also known as [...] "fish torpedos".|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>air,</b> <b>underwater</b> divers practicing technical diving may breathe oxygen-rich, oxygen-depleted or helium-rich breathing gas mixtures. Oxygen and analgesic gases {{are sometimes}} given to patients under medical care. The atmosphere in space suits is pure oxygen.|$|R
50|$|The {{full-face}} mask provides breathing gas to the diver, and an <b>air</b> space <b>to</b> facilitate <b>underwater</b> vision. There {{is usually}} one air space for both breathing and vision, {{and this is}} automatically equalised by the breathing gas during descent. However, some models have a mouthpiece isolating the breathing gas supply {{from the rest of}} the interior of the mask, or have a divided interior, and the main air space must then be equalised during descent by exhaling through the nose.|$|R

50|$|During the Cold War, {{the main}} powers {{engaged in a}} Nuclear arms race. In the space race, both nations {{attempted}} to launch human beings into space to the moon. Other technological advances centered on intelligence (like the spy satellite) and missiles (ballistic missiles, cruise missiles). Nuclear submarine, invented in 1955. This meant submarines {{no longer had to}} surface as often, and could run more quietly. They evolved into becoming <b>underwater</b> <b>missile</b> platforms.|$|R
50|$|They next {{arrive in}} Bikini Bottom (with Jimmy, Danny, and Timmy using Jimmy's <b>air</b> gum <b>to</b> breathe <b>underwater).</b> They meet Sandy, who {{explains}} Plankton uses harvesters to capture jellyfish to extract power from their sting; he also captured Mr. Krabs. Sandy sends them to Jellyfish Fields to meet Patrick, but he's sucked into a harvester. Destroying the harvesters, the group find {{themselves on the}} Flying Dutchman's ship; they (minus SpongeBob since he's annoying) are to be his new crew. However, Danny persuades him {{to let them go}} in exchange for bringing back his old crew. Arriving at the Chum Bucket, they free Patrick and the jellyfish. On the roof, they face Plankton (using a robot crab) and rescue Mr. Krabs. The heroes learn the Syndicate is extracting energy for a Doomsday Device, and Crocker is still supplying power to it.|$|R

5000|$|The Navy {{issued the}} STAM {{requirement}} in March 1969, and the Lockheed Missiles and Space Company (LMSC) {{responded to this}} proposal, which included {{the formation of an}} undersea warfare program organization in Sunnyvale, California. [...] It is unclear if this was to be an entirely new organization or part of the Lockheed <b>Underwater</b> <b>Missile</b> Facility (LUMF) which had been responsible for the design and development of the Polaris, Poseidon, and Trident submarine-launched strategic ballistic missile (SLBM) systems for the U.S. Navy.

5000|$|The Soviets {{called this}} type of ship RPKSN (lit. [...] "Strategic Purpose <b>Underwater</b> <b>Missile</b> Cruiser"). This {{designation}} {{was applied to the}} [...] Another designation used was PLARB(«ПЛАРБ» - подводная лодка атомная с баллистическими ракетами, which translates as [...] "Nuclear Submarine with Ballistic Missiles"). This designation was applied to smaller submarines such as the Delta class. After a peak in 1984 (following Able Archer 83), Russian SSBN deterrence patrols have declined to the point where there is less than one patrol per sub each year and at best one sub on patrol at any time. Hence the Russians do not use multiple crews per boat.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The diffuse {{interface}} {{model of}} Saurel et al. (2008) {{is used for}} the computation of compressible cavitating flows around <b>underwater</b> <b>missiles.</b> Such systems use gas injection and natural cavitation to reduce drag effects. Consequently material interfaces appear separating liquid and gas. These interfaces may have a really complex dynamics such that only a few formulations are able to predict their evolution. Contrarily to front tracking or interface reconstruction method the interfaces are computed as diffused numerical zones, that are captured in a routinely manner, as is done usually with gas dynamics solvers for shocks and contact discontinuity. With the present approach, a single set of partial differential equations is solved everywhere, with a single numerical scheme. This leads to very efficient solvers. The algorithm derived in Saurel et al. (2009) is used to compute cavitation pockets around solid bodies. It is first validated against experiments done in cavitation tunnel at CNU. Then it is used to compute flows around high speed <b>underwater</b> systems (Shkval-like <b>missile).</b> Performance data are then computed showing method ability to predict forces acting on the system...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{transient}} response of layered composite beams subjected <b>to</b> <b>underwater</b> shock. The Doubly Asymptotic Approximation (DAA) method is employed in this study to treat the fluid-structure interactions. The effective structural damping and stiffness are formulated and incorporated in the fluid-structure-coupled equations, which relate the structure response to fluid impulsive loading and are solved using coupled finite-element and DAA-boundary element codes. The present computational method facilitates the study of transient response of the layered composite beams <b>to</b> <b>underwater</b> shock, involving the effects of structural damping and stiffness. In addition, the effect of free surface on the transient response of the layered beam <b>to</b> <b>underwater</b> shock is examined...|$|R
