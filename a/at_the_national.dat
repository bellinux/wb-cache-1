5|$|Fischbach {{began his}} {{research}} career <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>National</b> Institutes of Health, {{where he served}} as a senior surgeon <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>National</b> Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) before becoming a fellow <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>National</b> Institute of Child Health from 1966 to 1973. Much of Fischbach’s research concentrated on the mechanisms controlling action potentials and synapses, from which he pioneered the use of neuron and muscle cell culture to study neuromuscular junctions. Fischbach used this technique to reconstruct neuromuscular junctions from dissociated spinal cord and muscle cells from chick embryos to show that functional synaptic connections reformed and were capable of sending spontaneous or induced action potentials. However, cultures containing isolated spinal cord cells were unable to send similar action potentials. This technique proved to be an important model for further studies to determine the essential mechanisms controlling neuromuscular junction development and maintenance. Towards the end of his tenure <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>National</b> Institutes of Health, Fischbach began to search for motor neuron molecules responsible for regulating the number of acetylcholine receptors on postsynaptic cells. This research project culminated in 1993 with the isolation of the ARIA (acetylcholine receptor inducing activity) protein, which {{is a member of the}} neuregulin family and is responsible for stimulating the production of acetylcholine receptors in postsynaptic muscle tissue.|$|E
