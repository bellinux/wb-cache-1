Countries need infrastructure, institutions, technical capacity, and investment in order to trade, and to respond to liberalization. Although many in developing countries would gain from a WTO settlement, there are small gains or even costs for some developing countries. More or better preferences cannot help all developing countries; they face challenges from non-preferred countries and may obstruct multilateral liberalization. <b>Aid</b> <b>for</b> Trade as an issue in the Doha Round was driven by the need to find benefits for all countries.

40|$|The <b>Aid</b> <b>for</b> Trade <b>Initiative</b> is {{an answer}} to {{developing}} countries’ requests for technical and financial assistance in the Doha Round negotiations. These requests prompted the WTO to collaborate with donors and development agencies but no attempt at increasing coherence between trade policy, aid policy, and development policy has been made. The main reason is that, while the WTO Secretariat had to collaborate with other institutions, it is not institutionally {{in a position to}} influence <b>aid</b> allocation. <b>Aid</b> <b>for</b> trade is delivered on donor’s terms in the same way than any other form of aid and the WTO’s role is largely limited to calling for more financial resources.

As a result, the Initiative has grown increasingly de-linked from the Doha Round and support to trade capacity building and trade reforms has progressively slipped off donors’ priorities list. In its <b>Aid</b> <b>for</b> Trade Work Programme for 2012 - 13, the WTO implicitly acknowledged this reality.

40|$|For many years, African {{countries}} have experienced slow economic growth. A major policy tool used {{to address this}} issue has been preferential market access whereby, certain developed {{countries have}} lowered and sometimes eliminated tariffs on imports from Africa. Despite this special treatment, however, there has been a sharp decline in Africa's global trade participation in the last few decades. There are many factors that may explain this phenomenon. First, while on average Africa has relatively good access to foreign markets, individual countries within the continent continue to face high tariff barriers. Second, preferential market access conceded to Africa has often been accompanied by numerous non-tariff barriers inhibiting African exports. Third, most African countries lack adequate trade facilitating infrastructure. All these factors suggest that the problem with Africa's low global trade participation cannot be addressed entirely using one policy approach. Along with increased market access, improving trade-related infrastructure and promoting <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> trade <b>initiatives</b> are crucial measures toward helping poor countries overcome supply-side constraints and integrate into the global economy. In fact, although preferential schemes have a large and positive impact on Africa, at times they are not sufficient and may even cause harm due to the narrow base of export diversity among African economies.

The objective of this study is to analyse this initiative, such as it is implemented presently, to see if it can contribute to improve the manufacturing supply, an so facilitate the achievement by Cameroon of the status of emerging country before 2035. From a statistical analysis of the various streams and the existing mechanisms, we note that the AFT, such implemented presently, is unable to reduce the supply's constraints in Cameroonian’s manufacturing. This is due to the fact that choices tuned a particular attention on trade capacities (elaboration of the trade policy, participation in the negotiations) and little on the productive dynamics and on the intensification of the industrial potential of the country. Now, without industry, no trade. Under the hypothesis that the increasing interest of the donors for the AFT will pull an additional increase of the AFT in Cameroon, we suggest that a particular accent must be tuned to the productive capacities during the elaboration and the implementation of any AFT program in Cameroonian manufacturing through a support for the technological apprenticeship and innovation, and through the industrial upgrading. ...|$|R

Using data collected {{before and after the}} 2010 Haiti earthquake, we detail the response of aid agencies and their interaction with local healthcare providers in Leogane, the city closest to the epicenter. We find that the period after the earthquake was associated with an increase in the total number of healthcare facilities, inpatient beds, and surgical facilities and that international aid has been a driving force behind this recovery. Aid has funded 12 of 13 new healthcare facilities that have opened since the earthquake as well as the {{reconstruction of}} 7 of 8 healthcare facilities that have been rebuilt. Despite increases in free, aid-financed healthcare, private Haitian healthcare facilities have remained at a constant number. The planned phase-out of several aid-financed facilities, however, will leave Leogane with fewer inpatient beds and healthcare services compared with the pre-earthquake period.

40|$|The <b>Aid</b> <b>for</b> Trade (AFT) <b>initiative</b> {{has been}} {{successful}} in mobilising funding to aid developing countries -in particular, the least developed- cope with the cost of implementing Uruguay Round commitments. However, whether the aid has really made a difference in their ability to take part in world trade growth remains unclear. Reasons for the lack of clear-cut evidence include the lack of a counterfactual, as the initiative’s broad definition meant that it includes areas of traditional donor assistance like infrastructure, the lack of a binding monitoring and evaluation framework, and the inherent difficulty of assessing causation between interventions on the ground and ‘distant’ outcomes such as export growth. With increasing pressure on donor budgets, the achievements of the AFT initiative are at risk unless a convincing case can be made that there is value for money. The time has come to focus and put in place an evaluation framework that can deliver robust evidence on the initiative’s impact on the ground. This book suggests ways to make progress in that direction. In particular, the WTO’s Trade Facilitation Agreement, signed in December 2013 in Bali, is an opportunity to refocus AFT on a narrower set of issues revolving around border management efficiency and streamlining non-tariff measures, where outcomes can be more directly related to interventions.
