Many ski makers have produced skis wholly from cloth and resin composite materials, using the tailorability of such construction to vary the stiffness, damping and torsional stiffness of a ski along its length.

25|$|Like acceleration, {{colloquium}} provides <b>advanced</b> <b>material</b> {{for high}} school students. In colloquium, students take Advanced Placement courses. However, colloquium is different from AP classes because students are usually given more projects than students in AP classes. Students in colloquium also generally study topics more in depth and sometimes {{in a different way}} than students enrolled in AP classes do. Colloquium is a form that takes place in a traditional public school. In colloquium, subjects are grouped together. Subjects are taught at different times of the day; however, usually what is being taught in one subject will connect with another subject. For example, if the students are learning about colonial America in History, then they might also be analyzing text from The Scarlet Letter in English. Some schools may only have colloquium in certain subjects. In schools where colloquium is only offered in English and History, colloquium students usually take Advanced Placement courses in math and science and vice versa.|$|E
500|$|Poland in Antiquity is {{characterized}} by peoples belonging to numerous archeological cultures [...] living in and migrating through {{various parts of the}} territory that now constitutes Poland in an era that dates from about 400 BC to 450–500 AD. These people are identified as Celtic, Germanic, Baltic and Thracian tribes. Other groups, difficult to identify, were most likely also present, as ethnic composition of archeological cultures is often poorly recognized. While lacking use of a written language to any appreciable degree, many of them developed relatively <b>advanced</b> <b>material</b> culture and social organization, as evidenced by the archeological record, for example judged by the presence of richly furnished, dynastic [...] "princely" [...] graves. Characteristic of the period was high geographical migration rate of large groups of people, even equivalents of today's nations. This article covers the continuation of the Iron Age (see Bronze and Iron Age Poland), the La Tène and Roman influence and Migration periods. La Tène period is subdivided into La Tène A, 450 to 400 BC; La Tène B, 400 to 250 BC; La Tène C, 250 to 150 BC; La Tène D, 150 to 0 BC. 400 to 200 BC is also considered the early pre-Roman period and 200 to 0 BC the younger pre-Roman period (A). It was followed by the period of Roman influence, of which the early stage had lasted from 0 to 150 AD (0–80 B1, 80–150 B2), and the late stage from 150 to 375 AD (150–250 C1, 250–300 C2, 300–375 C3). 375 to 500 AD constituted the (pre-Slavic) Migration Period (D and E).|$|E

The utilization of traditional machining methods is commonly considered very challenging for <b>advanced</b> <b>materials,</b> such as ceramics, metallic super alloys, and fiber-reinforced materials. The machining of these <b>advanced</b> <b>materials,</b> by means of ultrasonic assistance has been already introduced in the past. In this paper, the flexible integration of state-of-the-art ultrasonic systems in machining centers is presented.
