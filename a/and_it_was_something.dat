In addition, Chatwin's interest in nomads also influenced his writing. One aspect of nomadic culture that interested him was the few possessions they had. Their spartan way of life appealed to his aesthetic sense, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> he sought to emulate in both his life and his writing. He strove to strip unnecessary objects from his life and unnecessary words from his prose.|$|E

The 1979 version {{was produced by}} Richard Gordon, who explains why he and Metzger made their film version: [...] "Well, it hadn't been done since the Bob Hope version, {{it had never been}} done in color, it was a well-known title, had a certain reputation, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> that logically could or in fact should be made in England." ...|$|E

In November 2008, lead singer Chester Bennington said the new record was a concept album; he said it [...] "sound a little daunting to me, so, I think my confidence level will drop, but when it was presented to us by this friend of ours, we liked the idea.

500|$|Singer {{turned down}} {{directing}} opportunities with films like The Truman Show and The Devil's Own after {{the success of}} The Usual Suspects. He instead pursued Apt Pupil: [...] "It was a very dark subject matter, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> that came from passion." [...] He acknowledged in retrospect that Apt Pupil [...] "wasn't really {{supposed to be a}} big success". Singer was financially supported by producer Scott Rudin and the production company Spelling Films. Ian McKellen was cast as Dussander, and Brad Renfro was cast as Bowden. With $1million paid toward pre-production, filming was scheduled to begin in June 1996. Due to financial disagreements between Singer and Rudin, the start date was pushed back and subsequently canceled. [...] Singer and his production team stayed together while producer Don Murphy and his partner Jane Hamsher sought refinancing. Mike Medavoy, a former chairman of TriStar Pictures, rescued the production with the financial backing of his production company Phoenix Pictures. The company provided filmmakers with $14million to produce Apt Pupil. Filming took place on location in Altadena, California. Singer related to how Todd Bowden rebelled against his suburban environment. The director used the name of his high school football team, the Pirates, and the green-and-gold team colors in the film, saying, [...] "I just projected my own childhood right out to Southern California." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{this point}} in the development, the {{backdrop}} of Rapture had been fleshed out, but they had yet to come on how to represent the drones, protectors, and harvesters from their original game idea. The Big Daddy concept as the protector class was developed early in the process, but the team had yet to reach a satisfying design for the drones, having used several possible designs including bugs and dogs in wheelchairs. The team wanted to have the player care for the drones in some way and create pathos for these characters. The idea of using little girls came out of brainstorming, but was controversial and shocking within the team at first, recognizing that they could easily be killed and make the game more horrific in the style of Night Trap. However, as Levine worked on the story, he started to incorporate the ideas of dystopian and utopian thinkers from the twentieth century, including Ayn Rand, Aldous Huxley, and George Orwell, and considered their ideas [...] "fascinating". He brought in the ideas of Objectivism that Rand primarily outlined in the book Atlas Shrugged, that man should be driven by selfishness and not altruism, and used this to inform the philosophy behind the city of Rapture and Andrew Ryan’s work, tied in with his previous observations on Rockefeller and his writings. This was extended {{to the use of the}} little girls as drones (now Little Sisters), particularly the question whether the player should try to save the girls or harvest the ADAM for their own benefit. 2K Games expressed concern about the initial mechanic of the Little Sisters, where the player would actively prey on the Little Sister, which would have alerted a Big Daddy and setting up the fight with the player. This approach did not sit well with Levine, and 2K Games asserted that they would not ship a game [...] "where the player gets punished for doing the right thing". They altered this approach where the Little Sisters would be invulnerable until the player had dealt with their Big Daddy, though LeBreton considered this [...] "a massive kludge" [...] into the game's fiction. The idea of creating the Little Sisters and presenting the player with this choice became a critical part of the game's appeal to the larger gaming market though would still be met with criticism from some outlets. Levine desired only to have one ending to the game, something that would have left the fate of the characters [...] "much more ambiguous", but publisher pressure directed them to craft multiple endings depending on the choice of harvesting Little Sisters. Levine also noted that [...] "it was never my intention to do two endings for the game. It sort of came very late <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> that was requested by somebody up the food chain from me." ...|$|E

The neighborhood policeman faltered in going by, and then he kept on.
