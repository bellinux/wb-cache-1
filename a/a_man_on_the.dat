5|$|The U.S public's {{perception}} of the Soviet lead in the space race (by putting the first man into space) motivated President John F. Kennedy to ask the Congress on May 25, 1961, to commit {{the federal government to}} a program to land <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Moon {{by the end of the}} 1960s, which effectively launched the Apollo program.|$|E

5|$|He {{also said}} that the {{situation}} had been looked at in the wrong way by police, members of parliament and the security services; rather than asking if Profumo had committed adultery they should have asked if his conduct had led ordinary people to believe he committed adultery. His analogy was with divorce law; a man does not need to have committed adultery for his wife to have grounds to divorce him, but rather she simply has to believe that he has committed adultery. This is because such a belief would destroy the trust and confidence within the relationship. This brought criticism from several government ministers including Sir John Hobson, the Attorney-General for England and Wales, saying that it would mean condemning <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> basis of suspicion rather than evidence.|$|E

5|$|On the way home, Peter and Brian argue until Brian {{gets out}} of the car. A police officer gives Brian a ticket, for which Peter has to pay $10, for violating the local leash law, which only widens the rift between Peter and Brian. Another {{argument}} ensues and Peter mentions that he found Brian on the road as a stray dog. Angry that Peter brought that up and becoming more angry when Peter then demands that Brian stop being a bad dog, Brian leaves the house, whereupon he is treated cruelly by the community, and is (ultimately) forced to sleep at the bus shelter. Peter buys a new cat which turns out to be mischievous and abusive; the family gets rid of it and searches for Brian. By the time Peter decides to apologize to Brian, Brian has been kicked out of a restaurant and a public store and chased by the police when he was found drinking from a water fountain. Brian becomes homeless, having actually attacked <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> street for treating him as a drunken hobo and for not believing that he was not a good dog but a crazy animal. He is subsequently taken away by the police.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet Union {{had been}} {{competing}} with the US in landing <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Moon but had been hampered by repeated failures in development of a launcher comparable to the Saturn V. Meanwhile, they tried to beat the US to return lunar material to the Earth by means of unmanned probes. On July 13, three days before Apollo 11's launch, they launched Luna 15, which reached lunar orbit before Apollo 11. During descent, a malfunction caused Luna 15 to crash in Mare Crisium about two hours before Armstrong and Aldrin took off from the Moon's surface to begin their voyage home. The Jodrell Bank Observatory radio telescope in England was later discovered to have recorded transmissions from Luna 15 during its descent, and this was published in July 2009 on the 40th anniversary of Apollo 11.|$|E

25|$|The United States of America (U.S.) {{acknowledged}} the immense success of Apollo 11 {{with a national}} day of celebration on Monday, July 21, 1969. All but emergency and essential employees were allowed a paid day off from work, in both government and the private sector. Coincidentally, the last time this had happened was the national day of mourning on Monday, November 25, 1963, to observe the state funeral of President John F. Kennedy, who had set the political goal to put <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> moon {{by the end of}} the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|With the Americans {{planning}} a space walk with their Gemini program, the Soviets decided to trump them again by performing a space {{walk on the}} second Voskhod launch. After rapidly adding an airlock, the Voskhod 2 was launched on 18 March 1965, and Alexei Leonov performed the world's first space walk. The flight very nearly ended in disaster, as Leonov was just barely able to re-enter through the airlock, and plans for further Voskhod missions were shelved. In the meantime the change of Soviet leadership {{with the fall of}} Khrushchev meant that Korolev was back in favor and given charge of beating the US to landing <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Moon.|$|E
25|$|The {{character}} {{first appeared}} in early 1995 as a potential love interest for Chris Warner (Michael Galvin). Before the two finally got together, Tiffany embarked on a relationship with reformed junkie Billy (Darren Young) which landed her with hepatitis C. Tiffany and Chris married in a Valentine's Day ceremony in 1996 but the marriage quickly dissolved when Chris cheated on her. Tiffany later dated and married Johnny Marinovich after a period when she suspected {{he was a child}} molestor. The character starred in a dramatic storyline in mid-1998 when she fell from a high rise building after trying to talk down <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> roof. Tiffany ended up brain dead but her unborn baby was saved; Tiffany's life support was turned off soon afterwards.|$|E

25|$|The C-5 was {{confirmed}} as NASA's {{choice for the}} Apollo program in early 1963, and was named the SaturnV. The C-1 became the Saturn I, and C-1B became Saturn IB. Von Braun headed a team at the Marshall Space Flight Center in building a vehicle capable of launching a manned spacecraft on a trajectory to the Moon. Before they moved under NASA's jurisdiction, von Braun's team had already begun work on improving the thrust, creating a less complex operating system, and designing better mechanical systems. It was during these revisions {{that the decision to}} reject the single engine of the V-2's design came about, and the team moved to a multiple-engine design. The Saturn I and IB reflected these changes, but were not large enough to send a manned spacecraft to the Moon. These designs, however, provided a basis for which NASA could determine its best method towards landing <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Moon.|$|E
25|$|The Code {{recognized}} the importance of intent. A man who killed another in a quarrel must swear he did not do so intentionally and was then only fined according to the rank of the deceased. The Code does not say what would be the penalty of murder, but death is so often awarded where death is caused, that we can hardly doubt that the murderer was put to death. If the assault only led to injury and was unintentional, the assailant in a quarrel had to pay the doctor's fees. A brander, induced to remove a slave's identification mark, could swear to his ignorance and was free. The owner of an ox that gored <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> street was only responsible for damages if the ox was known by him to be vicious‚Äîeven if it caused death. If the mancipium died a natural death under the creditor's hand, the creditor was free. In ordinary cases, a person was not responsible for accident or if they exercised more than proper care. Poverty excused bigamy {{on the part of a}} deserted wife.|$|E
25|$|Unless {{you have}} secret incriminating {{evidence}} against Furtw√§ngler supporting your accusation {{that he was}} a tool of Nazi Party, I beg to take violent issue with your decision to ban him. The man never was a Party member. Upon numerous occasions, he risked his own safety and reputation to protect friends and colleagues. Do not believe that the fact of remaining in one's own country is alone sufficient to condemn <b>a</b> <b>man.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> contrary, as a military man, you would know that remaining at one's post often requires greater courage than running away. He saved, and for that we are deeply his debtors, the best part of his own German culture... I believe it patently unjust and most cowardly for us to make of Furtw√§ngler a scapegoat for our own crimes. If the man is guilty of specific crimes, accuse him and convict him. As far as I can see, it is no punishment to be banned from sordid, filthy Berlin and if the man now old and ill is willing and anxious to return to his exacting task and responsibilities he should be encouraged for that is where he belongs, right in Berlin...|$|E
