5|$|If the Wartburg and Hambach rallies had lacked <b>a</b> <b>constitution</b> and {{administrative}} apparatus, that problem was addressed between 1867 and 1871.

5|$|In 1785, a {{proposal}} {{for the creation of}} a General Assembly went before the Synod, yet the convening of one was delayed due to the necessity of having to write <b>a</b> <b>constitution,</b> <b>a</b> <b>constitution</b> which officers could not initially agree upon. In 1788, the Synod adopted <b>a</b> <b>constitution</b> modeled on the Church of Scotland in which power was centralized in the General Assembly. The constitution also included provisions of the Church of Scotland's Barrier Act of 1697, which required the General Assembly to receive the approval of a majority of presbyteries before making major changes to the church's constitution and doctrine.|$|E

40|$|The question—what is a {{political}} constitution?—might seem, at first blush, fairly innocuous. At one level, the idea of <b>a</b> political <b>constitution</b> seems fairly well settled, at least insofar as most political constitutionalists subscribe to a similar set of commitments, arguments and assumptions. At a second, more reflective level, however, there remains some doubt whether <b>a</b> political <b>constitution</b> purports to be a descriptive or normative account of <b>a</b> real world <b>constitution,</b> such as Britain’s. By exploring the idea of <b>a</b> political <b>constitution</b> as differently articulated by J. A. G. Griffith, Adam Tomkins and Richard Bellamy, this essay explores why the normativity of <b>a</b> political <b>constitution</b> may be indistinct and ill-defined, and how compelling reasons for this indistinctness and ill-definition {{are to be found}} in the very idea of <b>a</b> political <b>constitution</b> itself. <b>A</b> political <b>constitution</b> is here conceived as a ‘model’ which supplies an explanatory framework within which to make sense of our constitutional self-understandings. The discipline of thinking in terms of a model opens up a critical space wherein there need not be some stark, all-encompassing choice between constitutional models, which, in turn, allows for more subtle understandings of Britain’s constitution as neither exclusively ‘political’ nor ‘legal’...|$|R
