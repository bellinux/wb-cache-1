40|$|This paper {{provides}} a sufficient condition for existence and uniqueness of equilibrium, {{which is in}} monotone pure strategies, in games of incomplete information. First, we show that if each player’s incremental ex post payoff is uniformly increasing in its own action and type, <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>type</b> <b>is</b> sufficiently uninformative {{of the types of}} its opponents (independence), then its expected payoff satisfies a strict single crossing property in its own action and type, for any strategy profile played by its opponents. This ensures that a player’s best response to any strategy profile is a monotone pure strategy. Secondly, we show that if, in addition, there is sufficient heterogeneity of the conditional density of types, then the best response correspondence is a contraction mapping. This ensures equilibrium existence and uniqueness. In contrast to existing results, our uniqueness result does not rely on strategic complementarities; this allows for a wider range of applications.

In the case that a class is the collection type but the analysts misunderstand the class as the singular type, it takes expensive cost for modification afterwards. (7) and (8) imply checking the invariants of attributes of classes.

40|$|A Fourier {{analysis}} of parametric level dynamics for random matrices periodically depending on a phase is developed. We demonstrate both theoretically and numerically that under very general conditions the correlation C(ϕ) of level velocities is singular at ϕ = 0 for any symmetry class; the singularity is revealed by algebraic tails in Fourier transforms, and is milder, {{the stronger the}} level repulsion in the chosen ensemble. The singularity is strictly connected with the divergence of the 2 nd moments of level derivatives of appropriate order, <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>type</b> <b>is</b> specified to leading terms for Gaussian, stationary ensembles of GOE, GUE, GSE types, and for the Gaussian ensemble of Periodic Banded Random Matrices, in which a breaking of symmetry occurs.

In all the considered ensembles we study the statistics of the Fourier coefficients of eigenvalues, which are Gaussian distributed for low harmonics, but not for high ones, {{and the distribution of}} kinetic energies. 05. 45 +b I...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{key feature}} of XQuery is its type system. Any {{language}} expression is statically typed <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>type</b> <b>is</b> used during program type-checking. In XQuery, types of input data and functions are {{defined in terms}} of regular expression types, but it is quite easy to write queries that generate non-regular languages. As a consequence, any type system for XQuery has to rely on a type inference process that approximates the (possibly non-regular) output type of a query with a regular type. This approximation process, while mandatory and unavoidable, may significantly decrease the precision of the inferred types. In this paper we will analyze the precision and the complexity of the W 3 C type inference algorithm. By defining an abstract model for the core of XQuery and for its type language, we will identify the critical issues in the inference process and the sources of precision loss. We will also propose an alternative type inference system, and show that in most cases it is more precise without any performance penalties. Finally, we will identify relevant classes of input types for which inference precision can be dramatically improved...|$|E

Method: this study is a field descriptive study <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>type</b> <b>is</b> covariance. the survey tool used in this study is cultural capital and risky behavior questionnaire and students were selected using symmetric level sampling. this study was performed on 384 students in bachelor degree in Yazd university. they were selected using symmetric classification method with the society size and randomly. the gathered data was analyzed using Amos, SPSS 19. Results: findings of the study revealed that there is a meaningful negative relationship between the cultural capital and Yazd university students presenting risky behavior and between the triple dimensions of the cultural capital, there is a meaningful negative relationship between the characteristic and objective capitals and presentation of risky behavior risky behavior is observed in male more than female. there is also a meaningful negative relationship between cultural capital and risky behavior except for tendency toward violence. results showed that with rising the cultural level and the society cultural capital, specially for the objective and characteristic cultural capital trough enhancement in the level of study, internet usage and learning foreign languages and endeavor to get higher degrees in education, techniques and cultural and art licenses, we could expect to lower the level of risky behavior in youth and adolescents in the society and this can be helpful for corresponding undertakers. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{collection}} of three papers, studying corruption games between private citizens and bureaucrats from the perspective of law enforcement. The first paper develops a model in which bribe type is endogenous and examines how this choice is affected by asymmetric punishment which is proposed as an instrument of corruption control. It has been argued that this policy can eliminate harassment bribery if both whistle-blowing costs and the stakes are low. In a more realistic environment where bribery is most likely to survive and another type of bribery—non harassment one—coexists, this paper investigates how asymmetric punishment affects the mix of the two bribes. This is analyzed in a setting where bribe size is determined by Nash bargaining, detection of bribery <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>type</b> <b>is</b> conducted separately but could be related, and bribery detection rates can be endogenously chosen through whistle-blowing. The feasibility of whistle-blowing has no effect on the fraction of harassment bribery under symmetric punishment. When it is feasible, however, a switch from symmetric to asymmetric punishment leads to either no difference or more non-harassment bribery, which is independent of the relevance of detection of bribery and non-compliance. The result is robust when the legalization of bribe-giving is not feasible to non-harassment bribes. The second paper takes intermediaries into account and studies the effectiveness of asymmetric punishment as an anti-corruption strategy. Intermediaries that facilitate corruption between clients and bureaucrats are common in developing economies. Anecdotal evidence shows that intermediary agents are responsible for the greater corruption and welfare loss, and some formal analyses confirm this result in various aspects. By using a game theoretic model, this paper examines the efficacy of asymmetric punishment in combating harassment bribery {{in the presence of a}} monopolist intermediary. If asymmetric punishment cannot eliminate direct corruption but ends up with a larger bribe size when whistle-blowing is feasible, this policy leads to a shorter licensing procedure in a bribe only game. However, it strengthens incentives of the bureaucrat to create red tape when the intermediary exists, resulting in a longer procedure. The third paper studies a petty corruption game with a sequence of entrepreneurs and a set of bureaucrats. In this game, each entrepreneur has a project of which a benefit can be generated only if she acquires approvals from all the bureaucrats simultaneously. The bureaucrats are assumed to take the undominated strategy, demanding a positive bribe based on the take-it-or-leave-it rule. However, their non-approval decisions can be appealed by the entrepreneur by incurring an exogenous legal cost. The work shows that there are multiple equilibria in both one-stage and repeated game. BIME (bribeincome-maximizing-equilibrium), one extreme class of them, is non-monotonic in the reduced legal cost in the long run. Thesis (Ph. D.)
