5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Rhine Campaign of 1796, Austria had two armies in Germany, the <b>Army</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Upper Rhine under Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser and the <b>Army</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lower Rhine under Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen. The left wing of the 80,000-man <b>Army</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Upper Rhine guarded the Rhine River from Mannheim to Switzerland under Anton Sztáray, Michael von Fröhlich and Louis Joseph, Prince of Condé while its right wing was on the west bank around Kaiserslautern. The <b>Army</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lower Rhine had a 20,000-strong right wing under Duke Ferdinand Frederick Augustus of Württemberg on the east bank observing the French bridgehead at Düsseldorf. The archduke's remaining 70,000 troops lay on the west bank along the Nahe River with powerful garrisons in Mainz and Ehrenbreitstein Fortress.|$|E
5|$|Despite their destruction, the Legions became legendary in Poland, {{helping to}} spread the civic and {{democratic}} ideals of the French Revolution throughout the country.

5|$|The Imperial Roman <b>army</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Principate (30 BC – 284 AD) {{underwent}} a significant transformation {{as a result}} of the chaotic 3rd century. Unlike the <b>army</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Principate, the <b>army</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 4th century was heavily dependent on conscription and its soldiers were paid much less than in the 2nd century. Barbarians from outside the empire probably supplied a much larger proportion of the late army's recruits than in the <b>army</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1st and 2nd centuries, but there is little evidence that this adversely affected the army's performance.|$|E

5|$|A new {{front was}} opened in Salonika {{at the request}} of the Greek government, {{intending}} to support Serbian forces and oppose Bulgaria. The first troops of the British Salonika Army, arrived in Salonika in October 1916, too late to prevent the Serbian Army from retreating into Albania and Greece. French, British and Russian troops arrived in Salonika between 1916 and 1917 and became known as the Allied <b>Army</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Orient or Allied <b>Army</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> East, under the overall command of French General Maurice Sarrail.|$|E
5|$|After the defeats at {{the battles}} at Ostrach and Stockach, and the <b>Army</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Danube's retreat into the Black Forest, the French Directory had sacked Jean Baptiste Jourdan in April 1799 and given command {{of both the}} Army of Switzerland and the <b>Army</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Danube to André Masséna. Protecting the {{northern}} access to Zürich, Masséna gathered {{some of the best}} commanders he had available; eventually, three of them would become Marshals of France, and Tharreau, a dependable General of Division.|$|E
5|$|Although Artigas was {{defeated}} by the Luso-Brazilian armies, his allies Estanislao López and Francisco Ramírez continued hostilities against Buenos Aires for its inactivity against the invasion. Pueyrredón called the <b>Army</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Andes and the <b>Army</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> North (led by Belgrano) to aid Buenos Aires in the conflict. Guido noted to San Martín that if both armies did that, the north of Argentina and Chile would be easily reconquered by the royalists. San Martín also knew {{that most of the}} soldiers of the <b>Army</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Andes would not be willing to aid Buenos Aires in the civil war, as most were from other provinces or from Chile. San Martín had doubts as well about the projected arrival of a large military expedition from Spain, as the absolutist restoration of Ferdinand VII had met severe resistance in Spain. San Martín finally kept the Army in Chile when Belgrano's lieutenant Viamonte signed an armistice with López; he thought that the conflict had ended.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, more recent work has {{suggested}} that the regular <b>army</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2nd century was considerably larger than the c. 300,000 traditionally assumed. This is because the 2nd-century auxilia were not just equal in numbers to the legions as in the early 1st century, but some 50% larger. The <b>army</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Principate probably reached a peak of nearly 450,000 (excluding fleets and foederati) {{at the end of the}} 2nd century. Furthermore, the evidence is that the actual strength of 2nd-century units was typically much closer to official (c. 85%) than 4th century units.|$|E

5|$|During the 1980s, {{the land}} forces {{numbered}} 140,000 personnel, of whom two thirds were conscripts. In 1989 four armies appeared to exist: the First Army at Bucharest, Second Army at Buzau, Third Army at Craiova, and Fourth Army at Napoca. In 1989 the land forces consisted of eight mechanised (infantry) divisions (1st, Bucharest, 2nd, Craiova, 9th, Constanta, 10th, Iași, 11th, Oradea, 18th, Timişoara, 67th, and 81st, Tirgu Mureş) two tank divisions (the 57th Tank Division at Bucharest and the 6th Tank Division at Tirgu Mureş), four mountain infantry brigades, and three airborne brigades. According to the 165-year 'History of Modern Romanian Artillery,' in 1989 the 1st Army {{consisted of the}} 1st Mech Div, 57th Tank Div., and the 2nd Mountain Brigade; the 2nd <b>Army</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 9th Mech Div, 10th Mech Div, 67th Mech Div, and 32nd TActical Rocket Bde; the 3rd <b>Army</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2nd Mech Div, 18th Mech Div, and the 4th Mountain Bde; and the 4th <b>Army</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 11th Mech Div, 81st Mech Div, 6th Tank Div., 1st Mountain Bde, 5th Mountain Bde, and 37th Tactical Missile Brigade.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} Bourbon Restoration, Louis XVIII {{appointed}} Defrance as inspector general of cavalry. During the Hundred Days, Napoleon's brief return to France, Jean-Marie Defrance commanded {{part of the}} Armée de l'Ouest. This <b>Army</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> West was also called the <b>Army</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Vendée and the <b>Army</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Loire. Under overall command of Jean Maximilien Lamarque, one of Napoleon's fiercest supporters, it was formed to suppress potential Royalist insurrection in the Vendée region of France. Defrance {{did not participate in}} the Battle of Rocheserviere, in which Lemarque's army brutally crushed the anticipated Vendéen uprising. He remained instead at his post of the 18th military division, inspecting the cavalry depots in the upper Loire. Defrance retained his rank after the second restoration and commanded the First Military Division in Paris from 1819 to 1822. He also taught at the military school in Rebais.|$|E

The war also expanded with naval operations in 1862 when the CSS Virginia, formerly the USS Merrimack, damaged or destroyed three Union vessels in Norfolk, Virginia, before being engaged and damaged by the USS Monitor.

5|$|However, the {{minister}} of war Matías de Irigoyen ordered once more {{the return of the}} <b>Army</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Andes, and appointed Francisco Fernández de la Cruz as its leader, displacing San Martín. San Martín resigned again, and observed that the Army {{would not be able to}} cross the Andes from Chile to Buenos Aires because the winter snow was blocking the trails. All the leaders of the military units of the <b>Army</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Andes refused to go to Buenos Aires, as their soldiers would mutiny or desert. Facing both the resignation of San Martín and the refusals to obey the orders, the Supreme Director canceled the orders, and the <b>Army</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Andes stayed in Chile. With the sanction of the Argentine Constitution of 1819, Pueyrredón ended his mandate as Supreme Director, replaced by José Rondeau.|$|E
5|$|In August Belgrano again took {{command of}} the <b>Army</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> North, but with very limited people and resources.

With Güemes in Salta, his task was to prevent the Royalists from moving to the south. The Supreme Director Pueyrredón was supporting an alternative plan designed by José de San Martín: create the <b>Army</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Andes at Cuyo and, after making the Crossing of the Andes, defeat the royalists in Chile, get control of the Chilean navy, and attack the royalist stronghold of Lima with it.|$|E
