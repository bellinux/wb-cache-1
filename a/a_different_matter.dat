5|$|The album's release {{coincided with}} Jarre's first foreign tour. In 1981 the British Embassy gave Radio Beijing copies of Oxygène and Équinoxe, {{which became the}} first pieces of foreign music to be played on Chinese {{national}} radio in decades. The republic invited Jarre {{to become the first}} western musician to play there, with Les Concerts en Chine. The performances were scheduled to run from 18 October to 5 November 1981. The first, in Beijing, was initially attended mostly by officials, but before the concert began technicians realised that not enough power was available to supply the stage and auditorium. Chinese officials solved the problem by temporarily cutting power to the surrounding districts. The stadium was almost full when the concert began, but as Beijing's buses stopped running at about 10 o'clock, about half the audience left before it finished. To boost the audience attendance for the second night, Jarre and his production team purchased some of the concert tickets and gave them to children on the streets (Jarre originally wanted the concerts to be free, but the Chinese authorities decided to charge between £0.20 and £0.50 per ticket). The event was notable for its lack of audience involvement; the Chinese were apparently unmoved by both the music and the light show, and applause was muted. The second venue, in Shanghai, was <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>matter.</b> Jarre actively encouraged audience participation by stepping into the crowd, which became much more exuberant than that in Beijing. Recordings of the concerts, which featured one of Jarre's signature electronic instruments, the laser harp, were released as a double-disc LP in 1982.|$|E
25|$|The Phou Phasai probe was <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>matter.</b> On 22 May, two Thai BCs {{that had}} been {{withdrawn}} {{in the midst of}} Operation Sinsay joined the fresh reinforcements of GM 30 to attack the mountaintop position the PAVN valued as a base for assaults on the Royalists. On the 25th, they were halted by the fresh PAVN troops that had manned the hilltop, and stalemated.|$|E
25|$|The {{stability}} of the electrons in an atom itself is unrelated to the exclusion principle, but is described by the quantum theory of the atom. The underlying idea is that close approach of an electron to {{the nucleus of the}} atom necessarily increases its kinetic energy, an application of the uncertainty principle of Heisenberg. However, {{stability of}} large systems with many electrons and many nucleons is <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>matter,</b> and requires the Pauli exclusion principle.|$|E

25|$|The crusade under Frederick was <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>matter.</b> His {{army was}} {{too large for}} any Imperial fleet and took the land route through Anatolia. As he neared Byzantium, Stefan Nemanja of the Serbian state of Raška and the {{above-mentioned}} Peter IV of Bulgaria hastily concluded an anti-Byzantine alliance with the Holy Roman Emperor. Isaac decided to send his army to meet Frederick but the plan backfired when the army's commander initiated secret negotiations to overthrow Isaac.|$|E
25|$|For the 1978 NFL season, {{the rule}} in {{question}} regarding the forward pass was repealed. There are no longer any restrictions on any deflections of passes, and a future play that mirrored the Immaculate Reception would simply be an extraordinary but legal reception. Whether a future Franco Harris would have been ruled as catching such a deflected football before it struck the turf is <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>matter,</b> thanks to myriad cameras and use of instant replay {{that is part of}} the present-day NFL.|$|E
25|$|His latter {{campaigns in}} the Balkans were aimed {{not so much}} at conquest and subjugation as at drawing the Serbs, Bosnians, Wallachians and Bulgarians into the fold of the Roman Catholic faith and at forming a united front against the Turks. It was {{relatively}} easy to subdue the Balkan Orthodox countries by arms, but to convert them was <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>matter.</b> Despite Louis' efforts, {{the peoples of the}} Balkans remained faithful to the Eastern Orthodox Church and their attitude toward Hungary remained ambiguous. Louis annexed Moldavia in 1352 and established a vassal principality there, before conquering Vidin in 1365. The rulers of Serbia, Walachia, Moldavia, and Bulgaria became his vassals. They regarded powerful Hungary as a potential menace to their national identity. For this reason, Hungary could never regard the Serbs and Wallachians as reliable allies in subsequent wars against the Turks.|$|E

25|$|Most of {{the circles}} are of fairly modest {{dimensions}} and Burl has theorised {{that they could}} have been constructed by a single family. Transporting the massive recumbents was <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>matter,</b> however; the fifty-ton recumbent at Old Keig was transported from six miles away and may have needed up to 200 people to drag it to its final resting place. The circle at Strichen provided a unique opportunity to test how the recumbents might have been transported. It was incorrectly restored in the 19th century by Lord Lovat, so between 1979–83 it was fully excavated and correctly restored by a team led by Burl, Ian Hampsher-Monk and Philip Abramson. The restoration required the team to move some of the stones, and {{it was found that the}} most efficient non-mechanical means of doing so was to use drag the stones along a slippery path of wet straw using logs as a kind of sledge.|$|E
500|$|The lyrical style varies {{depending}} on culture, denomination, and country. For example, in Northern Europe the bands with Lutheran members usually prefer a personal lyrical approach, which is seldom meant to [...] "convert" [...] in an aggressive manner, since evangelism has been more typical among American bands. Christian bands never deny their conviction but typically avoid preaching, and sometimes the matter is left unexpressed, leaving religion as a private issue of the listener. Certain bands choose to deal with everyday life experiences from a Christian perspective in order to draw both Christian and non-Christian listeners. In such cases, identifying a [...] "Christian band" [...] can be difficult. Secular bands that occasionally deal with Christian topics are <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>matter</b> altogether. Defining a Christian band is a much debated issue on Christian metal forums. A Christian band {{is expected to have}} either professed Christian members or a Christian message, preferably both.|$|E
2500|$|The album's second single, the confrontational [...] "Case of the Ex", {{proved to}} be <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>matter</b> and was a dance-heavy jam with {{attitude}} on it.

2500|$|For OT to work, {{every single}} {{change to the}} data needs to be captured: [...] "Obtaining a {{snapshot}} of the state is usually trivial, but capturing edits is <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>matter</b> altogether.

2500|$|This legend is {{technically}} true but highly misleading. [...] According to a U.S. Army study, {{the amount of}} secondhand cannabis smoke needed to cause a false positive result (failure) is quite large indeed, and would require being sealed in an unventilated car or small room filled with marijuana being actively smoked for several hours (often {{referred to as a}} [...] "hotbox"). Hair testing, however, is <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>matter,</b> particularly with passive exposure to crack/cocaine, which can deposit onto hair and be readily incorporated into it. With regards to cannabis, however, typically only metabolites (produced by the body and thus not found in smoke) are tested rather than THC, so failure is unlikely to result from non-extreme passive exposure.|$|E
2500|$|For example, {{there was}} some {{controversy}} in 2008 when the army announced plans to remove three wooden crosses outside the chapel serving military personnel in Kosovo’s [...] "Camp Bondsteel," [...] replacing them with a monument displaying the Chaplain Corps seal. In an interview with Fox News Channel, Lieutenant Colonel William D. Jenkins of the 35th Infantry Division's Kosovo Force 9 said that the Base Camp Planning Board approved {{the removal of the}} crosses in accordance with army regulations, which require the exterior to be free of any specific faith group symbols. Jenkins said that [...] "The interior of each U.S. Army chapel reflects faith-specific signs, symbols, etc., during each faith group's service so that their faith is fully represented during their service...The exterior of Army chapels is <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>matter</b> since the chapels are used by many different faith groups." [...] He said that the crosses would still be used during special services, such as the Easter Sunrise Service.|$|E
2500|$|The cosmic {{significance}} of the Resurrection in Western theology goes back to Saint Ambrose who in the 4th century said that [...] "In Christ the world has risen, heaven has risen, the earth has risen". However, this theme was only developed later in Western theology and art. It was, <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>matter</b> in the East where the Resurrection was linked to redemption, and the renewal and rebirth {{of the whole world}} from a much earlier period. In art this was symbolized by combining the depictions of the Resurrection with the Harrowing of Hell in icons and paintings. A good example is from the Chora Church in Istanbul, where John the Baptist, Solomon and other figures are also present, depicting that Christ was not alone in the resurrection. The depiction sequence at the 10th-century Hosios Loukas monastery in Greece shows Christ wearing a new tunic, with gold lines, after he has broken through the gates of Hell. Christ then he pulls Adam, followed by Eve from his tomb, signifying the salvation of humanity after the resurrection.|$|E

60|$|But Nora {{was in the}} sneering {{mood that}} night, and pursued her sarcasms; she pointed out that Captain Quin was already known as a valiant soldier, famous {{as a man of}} fashion in London, and that it was mighty well of Redmond to talk and boast of beating ushers and farmers' boys, but to fight an Englishman was <b>a</b> very <b>different</b> <b>matter.</b>|$|R
2500|$|In {{discussions of}} Church teaching, “slavery” {{is defined by}} some Catholic writers as the {{condition}} of involuntary servitude in which a human being is regarded as {{no more than the}} property of another, as being without basic human rights; in other words, as a thing rather than a person. [...] This form of slavery can be called “chattel slavery.” They contrast this with [...] "just servitude" [...] in which a metaphysical distinction is made between owning a person as an object, and only owning the work of that person. In practical terms a person could be bought sold or exchanged as a form of [...] "just servitude" [...] subject to certain conditions. [...] Slavery for debt was typically legally <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>matter</b> under both pre-Christian and Christian legal systems; it might be only for a period, and the owner typically did {{not have the right to}} sell the slave without his agreement, and had other restrictions. [...] It often was more a form of indentured labour. [...] Ancient legal systems, included those of the Israelites seen in the Hebrew Bible, also typically distinguished between [...] "native" [...] and foreign slaves, with much better protection for the former. [...] This distinction was transferred to Christian versus non-Christian slaves, sometimes with a component of [...] "origin" [...] as well, for example in Anglo-Saxon laws, but remained very important in Christian thinking and legal systems, in particular for the making of new slaves.|$|E
