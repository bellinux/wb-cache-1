5|$|In the meantime, Miceli {{became an}} {{instructor}} at the WCW Power Plant, where she helped train women such as Nora Greenwald (Molly Holly) to wrestle. Before WCW's collapse, she engaged in a brief feud with Torrie Wilson and Shane Douglas, who defeated her and partner Billy Kidman at Fall Brawl in a Mixed Tag Team Scaffold match. Madusa took a big bump during this match and wasn't seen again on WCW TV. She left the company when she heard that Vince McMahon, {{the owner of the}} World Wrestling Federation, was going to buy WCW. Because she had a previous falling-out with McMahon, she opted not to stay with the company. She retired from professional wrestling for good in 2001 because she did not like the direction in which women's wrestling was going; according to her, it was becoming less <b>about</b> <b>real</b> wrestling and more about Bra and Panties matches.|$|E

5|$|Law {{enforcement}} officers often receive inquiries and demands about their investigations that stem from unrealistic portrayals on television. In a 2010 survey of Canadian police officers, some were frustrated by these CSI-affected queries, though most {{saw them as}} opportunities {{to inform the public}} <b>about</b> <b>real</b> police work. New technologies and the increased public awareness of forensic science have stimulated new interest in solving cold cases and encouraged higher accountability among police investigators. However, the increased demand for forensic evidence can cause an unmanageable workload for forensic laboratories. Some crime labs process several thousand cases every year. Many law enforcement agencies have insufficient storage space for the increasing amount of physical evidence they collect. In some investigations, DNA evidence is not collected simply because there is not enough space to store it properly.|$|E
5|$|Other historians, {{including}} Wilhelm Mommsen and Arthur Rosenberg, {{oppose the}} idea that Frederick could have, or would have, liberalized Germany. They believe {{that he would not}} have dared to oppose both his father and Bismarck to change Germany's course; a natural soldier, he was steeped in his family's strong military tradition, and had happily reported to his father since he joined the army at the age of ten. Andreas Dorpalen notes that Frederick had complied with most of William's and Bismarck's policies early in his life, and would have been unlikely to change his behaviour. According to Arthur Rosenberg, despite his liberal tendencies Frederick still firmly believed in Bismarck and his system, with Dorpalen adding that in any case Frederick had too weak and ineffectual a character to have brought <b>about</b> <b>real</b> change, regardless of how long he reigned. James J. Sheehan states that the political climate and party system of Germany during that period were too steeped in the old ways for Frederick to overcome with liberalization. Dorpalen also observes that Frederick's liberal persona may have been exaggerated after his death, to keep the liberal movement strong in Germany, and he points out that the many mistakes made by Wilhelm II helped to paint his father in a more favorable light.|$|E

25|$|Even {{though he}} sought to {{distinguish}} observed facts from myths and popular errors and {{was known for his}} accurate depiction of many animals in Historiae animalium, he also included many fictional animals such as the Unicorn and the Basilisk, which he had only heard about from medieval bestiaries. But when Gessner doubted the accuracy of the opinions he relayed in his own writings, or the validity of the illustrations he included, he clearly said so. Besides any plant or animal's potential advantage to people, Gessner was interested in learning about them because of the moral lessons they could teach and the divine truths they might tell. He went into as much detail about some unreal animals as he did <b>about</b> <b>real</b> ones. Later in 1556 he also combined real and fictional creatures in his edition of the works of Claudius Aelianus.|$|E

40|$|In an {{important}} paper, Fuhrer and Moore (1995) showed that Taylor (1980) ’s staggered wage setting model does not exhibit persistence in inflation; they proposed a simple modification, in which workers cared <b>about</b> the <b>real</b> wages of other workers, which solves this problem. However, {{we argue that}} the key part of Fuhrer and Moore’s model is not that workers care <b>about</b> the <b>real</b> wages of other workers, but that workers are assumed to care <b>about</b> the past <b>real</b> wages of other workers. When that assumption is replaced by the assumption that workers care <b>about</b> current <b>real</b> wages of other workers, the Fuhrer and Moore model reverts identically to the Taylor model. We also show that a simple model in which workers care about their own past real wages, e. g. because unemployment insurance depends on past wages, as noted in Blanchard and Katz (1999), generates negative autocorrelations in inflation...|$|R

Mohar Basu in his review at The Times of India described the movie as [...] "unpretentious", saying that [...] "the movie wins you over with its innocence and simplicity".

500|$|Kostova's {{interest}} in the Dracula legend began with the stories her father {{told her about the}} vampire when she was a child.

According to Kostova, [...] "It was the formative experience of my childhood." [...] She [...] "was fascinated by [...] because they were...from history in a way, even though they weren't <b>about</b> <b>real</b> history, but I heard them in these beautiful historic places." [...] Kostova's {{interest in}} books and libraries began early as well.

The music she would hear influenced her tastes, as she commented: [...] "all the dancehall records I saved up to buy – Shabba Ranks, Buju Banton – I heard them at Notting Hill". When asked during an interview who her favourite songwriter was, Dixon replied: [...] "Lauryn Hill. I love Lauryn Hill because she is not scared to talk <b>about</b> <b>real</b> life. She may say things that are slightly controversial but she gets people thinking and gets people talking". Dixon has also named Neneh Cherry as great influence upon her. Cherry, a mixed race singer, inspired her from an early age, with Dixon saying, [...] "I remember seeing Neneh Cherry on the TV when I was little and turning to my mum and saying, 'Mummy, she looks like me'".|$|E
500|$|Although Birtwistle and Davies {{wished to}} remain true to {{the tone and}} spirit of the novel, they wanted to produce [...] "a fresh, lively story <b>about</b> <b>real</b> people", not an [...] "old studio-bound BBC drama that was shown in the Sunday teatime slot". Emphasising sex and money as the themes of the story, Davies shifted the focus from Elizabeth to Elizabeth and Darcy and foreshadowed Darcy's role in the {{narrative}} resolution. To portray the characters as real human beings, Davies added short backstage scenes such as the Bennet girls dressing up to advertise themselves in the marriage market. New scenes where men pursue their hobbies with their peers departed from Jane Austen's focus on women. The biggest technical difficulty proved to be adapting the long letters {{in the second half}} of the story. Davies employed techniques such as voice-overs, flashbacks, and having the characters read the letters to themselves and to each other. Davies added some dialogue to clarify events from the novel to a modern audience but left much of the novel's dialogue intact.|$|E
500|$|Following an {{appearance}} in the music video of Coldplay's [...] "Hymn for the Weekend" [...] (featuring Beyoncé), Kapoor starred in Ram Madhvani's biographical thriller Neerja (2016). She was cast as the eponymous air hostess Neerja Bhanot, who died while saving the passengers of the hijacked Pan Am Flight 73 in 1986. Kapoor felt responsible towards the project because it is <b>about</b> <b>real</b> events, and met Bhanot's family as a preparation for her role. The film garnered wide critical acclaim, and several commentators considered Kapoor's performance to be her best to date. Raja Sen found her performance to be career-defining, while Hindustan Times Rohit Vats wrote that [...] "she carries [...] entirely on her shoulder. She looks earnest, scared, benevolent and bold, {{all at the same}} time." [...] Sen listed Kapoor as the best actress in Hindi cinema in 2016, while Rajeev Masand invited her to his annual best actresses roundtable. In addition to several other accolades, Kapoor won the Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actress and National Film Award for Special Mention. With a worldwide gross over , the film {{emerged as one of the}} highest-grossing Bollywood films featuring a female protagonist.|$|E
