5000|$|Pollution: Campbell {{discusses}} the pollution that [...] "traditional" [...] batteries {{put into the}} water when <b>a</b> <b>boat</b> <b>sinks,</b> but Desmond says that electric boats are no more liable to sinking than other types and lists the leakage of fuel, engine oil and coolant additives as inevitable when an internal-combustion-engined boat sinks. Rutter points to the [...] "very nasty cocktail of pollutants" [...] {{that come out of}} a diesel wet exhaust in normal use.|$|E
500|$|Oxford {{recorded}} a winning time of 24 minutes and 4 seconds {{and took the}} overall record to 97 in favour of Cambridge. [...] It {{was the first time}} in the event's history that <b>a</b> <b>boat</b> <b>sank.</b>|$|R
50|$|The right half shows a drunk silenus, {{sleeping}} {{among the}} symbols of vice; to these, in the background, corresponds a valley with an easy access, but dark and including a forest, which {{is a symbol of}} getting lost without the divine light, as well as <b>a</b> <b>boat</b> <b>sinking</b> in <b>a</b> lake, a symbol of failure.|$|R
60|$|The crowd below {{gathered}} {{themselves into}} a heap like water above <b>a</b> <b>boat</b> <b>sinking</b> {{in the heart of}} a whirlpool. For a minute or more they snarled and surged and twisted. Then they broke up and went away, talking in short, eager sentences. And there, small and dreadful on the stones, lay something that once had been a man.|$|R
5|$|The storm dropped light {{rainfall}} {{throughout its}} path, and winds were minimal. The combination of Danielle {{and a high}} pressure system produced higher than normal tides and strong waves, causing beach erosion and light coastal damage. The waves killed two in New Jersey from <b>a</b> <b>boat</b> <b>sinking,</b> and also destroyed three houses in the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Overall damage from the storm was minimal.|$|R
5|$|No land {{effects were}} {{reported}} in Nicaragua but a four-year-old girl drowned on <b>a</b> <b>boat</b> that <b>sank</b> amidst high winds and waves {{at the mouth of}} the Kukra River.|$|R

25|$|In 1936, William D. Campbell, {{a wealthy}} board member {{with a desire}} to see Africa, offered to fund several dioramas if allowed to obtain the {{specimens}} himself. Clark agreed to this arrangement and shortly after Campbell left to collect the okapi and black rhinoceros specimens accompanied by artist Robert Kane. Campbell would be involved, in one capacity or another, with several other subsequent expeditions. Despite setbacks including malaria, flooding, foreign government interference, and even <b>a</b> <b>boat</b> <b>sinking,</b> these expeditions would succeed in acquiring some of Akeley Hall’s most impressive specimens.|$|R

50|$|While the Battle of Latakia was {{the first}} naval battle in history between missile boats, {{it was not the}} first {{incident}} in which <b>a</b> missile <b>boat</b> <b>sank</b> another ship using missiles. That had happened when two Egyptian Navy Komar-class missile <b>boats</b> <b>sank</b> the British-built Israeli destroyer Eilat on 21 October 1967, shortly after the Six Day War, using four P-15 Termit surface-to-surface missiles.|$|R
500|$|A {{storm surge}} of 15ft (4.6m) was {{reported}} in Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana. At Timbalier Bay, tides were 10ft (3m) above average. The New Canal Light was damaged by the strong wind and waves. Previously damaged by the 1915 New Orleans hurricane, the new damage instigated a project to raise the lighthouse by 3ft (0.9m). The third Timbalier Bay lighthouse was also damaged by the hurricane. [...] Several small fishing schooners were lost during the storm after failing to evacuate to ports prior to the storm. [...] Upstream of the Mississippi River near Donaldsonville, Louisiana, <b>a</b> <b>boat</b> <b>sank.</b>|$|R

50|$|Railroads soon {{replaced}} many {{canals and}} turnpikes {{and by the}} 1870's had significantly displaced steamboats as well. The railroads were superior to these alternative modes of transportation, particularly water routes because they lowered costs in two ways. Canals and rivers were unavailable in the winter season due to freezing, but the railroads ran year-round despite poor weather. And railroads were safer: {{the likelihood of a}} train crash was less than the likelihood of <b>a</b> <b>boat</b> <b>sinking.</b> The railroads provided cost-effective transportation because they allowed shippers to have a smaller inventory of goods, which reduced storage costs during winter, and to avoid insurance costs from the risk of losing goods during transit.|$|R
5000|$|On 2 September 1662 Dorthe Lauritzdotter {{was brought}} in for {{questioning}} at the Vardøhus fortress. She had been accused once before, but acquitted, in 1657. Lauritz Braas said that two of his servants, who had recently died, had claimed to be bewitched by her. Four witches led by Dorthe {{in the shape of}} a dove, an eagle, a crow and a swan were to have opened their [...] "wind-knots" [...] over the sea to make <b>a</b> <b>boat</b> <b>sink,</b> but the plot supposedly failed because the crew had prayed to God. Dorthe was burned at the stake on 6 November 1662 with two other women, soon followed by another two.|$|R
5|$|The storm, which {{ultimately}} made landfall near the Virginia–North Carolina border, produced high winds {{along the coast}} from New Jersey through North Carolina. <b>A</b> small <b>boat</b> <b>sank</b> {{off the coast of}} New Jersey, killing three of its occupants. Overall damage was estimated around $150,000 (1967USD), although the storm overall was considered beneficial.|$|R
50|$|Around 1 August 1940, {{while on}} a mine-laying mission near Norway, U-25 passed through British mine barrage number seven and struck <b>a</b> mine. The <b>boat</b> <b>sank,</b> taking all hands with it.|$|R
5|$|Fierce waves pushed {{large amounts}} of water to coastal areas in Fujairah of the United Arab Emirates, forcing roads to be closed and traffic diverted. Civil defence and police were on duty to manage the road closures, while {{municipal}} workers pumped the excess water off the roads. The road connecting Kalba and Fujairah was closed due to the road being submerged by water. The waves along the coastline were reported to be 10m (32ft) high, which destroyed about <b>a</b> dozen fishing <b>boats.</b> About 300boats were moved from the water or emptied of equipment, and overall damage to the port of Fujairah was reported as severe. <b>A</b> <b>boat</b> <b>sank</b> by the port, leaving its ten passengers missing.|$|R

50|$|Offshore, ten {{fishing vessels}} (with about 200 people aboard) were {{reported}} missing; however, there was uncertainty about whether Muifa was the cause. On 7 August, as the typhoon brushed {{the coast of}} Shanghai, a major sea bridge linking the urban area to an outlying island was closed. Heavy rains and strong winds battered the city, and some 400,000 people were moved to evacuation centers. Tens of thousands of fishing boats remained in port. Hundreds of flights were cancelled, leaving thousands of passengers stranded. One person was reported missing as <b>a</b> <b>boat</b> <b>sank</b> off Zhejiang in storm surge associated with Muifa. Strong winds knocked down billboards and cut power in two residential areas of Shanghai. However, the typhoon weakened before it reached the city and many stores remained open.|$|R
5000|$|<b>A</b> fishing <b>boat</b> <b>sinks</b> in the English Channel in {{the middle}} of the night, and the {{evidence}} points to murder.

5|$|Upon making {{landfall}} in Nicaragua, Bret caused severe flooding {{along the}} coast that left 25villages isolated. Rains continued following the storm, preventing areas from being reached, and Tropical Storm Gert brought additional rainfall to the area in early September. Throughout Nicaragua, Bret destroyed 12bridges and disrupted the drainage systems along the regional road network. Heavy rainfall also caused rivers to overflow, causing heavy damage in adjacent fields that affected rice, cassava, and bananas; about 1,800hectares (4,500acres) of rice fields were destroyed. Two villages of the Miskito people were washed away, leaving 500residents homeless. The storm damaged at least 1,500houses and destroyed another 850, leaving around 60,000people temporarily homeless. Bret also destroyed ten churches and ten schools, as well as 25medical centers. The storm killed nine people offshore when <b>a</b> <b>boat</b> <b>sank</b> in the Corn Islands, and there were 31deaths overall in the country. The preliminary damage total was around US$3million, although it did not include crop or infrastructure damage.|$|R
