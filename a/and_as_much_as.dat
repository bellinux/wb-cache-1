5|$|In late January 1913, the Worcester Telegram {{published}} a story announcing that Thorpe had played professional baseball, and other U.S.newspapers followed up the story. Thorpe had indeed played professional {{baseball in the}} Eastern Carolina League for Rocky Mount, North Carolina, in 1909 and 1910, receiving meager pay; reportedly as little as US$2 ($ today) per game <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> US$35 ($ today) per week. College players, in fact, regularly spent summers playing professionally but most used aliases, unlike Thorpe.|$|E
5|$|The {{wool and}} cloth trade was {{primarily}} now {{being run by}} English merchants themselves rather than by foreigners. Increasingly, the trade was also passing through London and the ports of the South-West. By the 1360s, 66–75% of the export trade was in English hands and by the 15th century this had risen to 80%; London managed around 50% of these exports in 1400, <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> 83% of wool and cloth exports by 1540. The growth {{in the numbers of}} chartered trading companies in London, such as the Worshipful Company of Drapers or the Company of Merchant Adventurers of London, continued, and English producers began to provide credit to European buyers, {{rather than the other way}} around. Usury grew during the period, and few cases were prosecuted by the authorities.|$|E
5|$|During John's {{time in the}} Western North Pacific, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) had {{particular}} difficulty in forecasting and even estimating the strength of John. John weakened considerably after entering the Western North Pacific, and, before estimates were later revised, four consecutive advisories were issued that declared John a tropical depression. Each of these advisories called for imminent dissipation. As John persisted and did not dissipate as the JTWC had predicted, it was upgraded to a minimal tropical storm in the next advisory. At the same time, however, two separate ship reports indicated that John had sustained winds of at least 55 knots (100 km/h, 65 mph), far stronger than the advisory strength of 35 knots (65 km/h, 40 mph). John {{would go on to}} restrengthen into a strong Category 1 hurricane after reentering the Central North Pacific, defying all JTWC predictions. After later reanalysis, the JTWC raised the estimated wind speeds of John for every advisory from 1200 UTC September 1 to its final advisory exactly a week later by at least 5 knots (9 km/h, 6 mph) <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> 25 knots (46 km/h, 29 mph).|$|E

5|$|The moat was {{situated}} {{at a distance}} of about 20m from the outer wall. The moat itself was over 20m wide <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> 10m deep, featuring a 1.5m tall crenellated wall on the inner side, serving as a first line of defence. Transverse walls cross the moat, tapering towards the top {{so as not to be}} used as bridges. Some of them have been shown to contain pipes carrying water into the city from the hill country to the city's north and west. Their role has therefore been interpreted as that of aqueducts for filling the moat and as dams dividing it into compartments and allowing the water to be retained over the course of the walls. According to Alexander van Millingen, however, there is little direct evidence in the accounts of the city's sieges to suggest that the moat was ever actually flooded. In the sections north of the Gate of St. Romanus, the steepness of the slopes of the Lycus valley made the construction maintenance of the moat problematic; it is probable therefore that the moat ended at the Gate of St. Romanus, and did not resume until after the Gate of Adrianople.|$|E

25|$|The {{dramatic}} shift in prices mauled nominal wages - in the United States, nominal wages declined by one-quarter during the 1870s, <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> one-half in some places, such as Pennsylvania. Although real wages had enjoyed robust {{growth in the}} aftermath of the American Civil War, increasing by nearly a quarter between 1865 and 1873, they stagnated until the 1880s, posting no real growth, before resuming their robust rate of expansion in the later 1880s. The collapse of cotton prices devastated the already war-ravaged economy of the southern United States. Although farm prices fell dramatically, American agriculture continued to expand production.|$|E
25|$|Three great deserts isolate Najd from north, east, {{and south}} as the Red Sea {{escarpment}} does from the west. In the north, the An Nafud—sometimes called the Great Nafud because An Nafud {{is the term}} for desert—covers about 55,000 square kilometers at an elevation of about 1,000 meters. Longitudinal dunes—scores of kilometers in length <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> ninety meters high, and separated by valleys as much as sixteen kilometers wide—characterize the An Nafud. Iron oxide gives the sand a red tint, particularly {{when the sun is}} low. Within the area are several watering places, and winter rains bring up short-lived but succulent grasses that permit nomadic herding during the winter and spring.|$|E
25|$|Powell {{had voted}} against the Schuman Declaration in 1950 and had {{supported}} entry only because {{he believed that the}} Common Market was simply a means to secure free trade. In March 1969, he opposed Britain's joining the European Economic Community. Opposition to entry had hitherto been confined largely to the Labour Party but now, he said, it was clear to him that the sovereignty of Parliament was in question, as was Britain's very survival as a nation.
