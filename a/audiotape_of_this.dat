40|$|Objectives. The aims <b>of</b> <b>this</b> {{study were}} {{to examine how}} GPs manage the {{consultation}} for upper resiratory tract infections (URTIs) and the prescribing of antibiotics, to understand what skills and strategies are used in managing URTIs without antibiotics, and to note evidence of pressure on doctors to prescribe and whether {{there are signs of}} overt disagreement about prescribing in the consultation. Methods. A qualitative analysis <b>of</b> <b>audiotaped</b> consultations was carried out. The setting was a general practice in South Wales and the subjects were five GPs and 29 parents presenting children with URTIs over a 2 -week period. The main outcome measures were skills and strategies identified from <b>audiotapes</b> <b>of</b> consultations. Results. <b>This</b> group <b>of</b> GPs used a set of readily identifiable consulting skills for managing the consultation without prescribing. Their consultations had a highly routinized quality. There was little evidence of either conflict or overt pressure from parents to prescribe. The word ‘antibiotics' was seldom mentioned. Clinicians did not elicit patient expectations for receiving antibiotics. Conclusions. Doctors use a set of readily identifiable skills in managing the URTI consultation. Avoiding the prescribing of antibiotics is not necessarily a simple and straightforward matter. Since patients apparently want antibiotics less than anticipated, eliciting expectations might be a way of reducing prescribing and broadening the approach to meeting patient needs. Whether doctors can adjust their routinized consulting patterns in the time-limited context of general practice remains an open question...|$|R

40|$|The {{current study}} has two aims: (1) {{to look at}} people's recall of risk {{information}} after genetic counselling and (2) to determine the impact <b>of</b> receiving an <b>audiotape</b> <b>of</b> the genetic consultation on level of recall, cancer related worry, and women's uptake of risk management methods. Using a prospective randomised controlled design, subjects receiving an audiotape were compared with a standard consultation group. Participants were drawn from attenders at the genetic clinics of two London hospitals and included 115 women with {{a family history of}} breast cancer. Assessment of perceived genetic risk, mental health, cancer worry, and health behaviour was made before counselling at the clinic (baseline) and by postal follow up. Usefulness <b>of</b> <b>audiotapes</b> and satisfaction with the clinical service was assessed by study specific measures. The data indicate that cancer worry is reduced by provision <b>of</b> an <b>audiotape</b> <b>of</b> the genetic consultation. Recall of the genetic risk figure, however, is not affected by provision <b>of</b> an <b>audiotape</b> and neither is it related to women's overall perception of being more or less at risk of breast cancer than the average woman. Forty-one percent of women accurately recalled their personal risk of breast cancer at one month follow up; however, 25 % overestimated, 11 % underestimated, and 23 % could not remember or did not know their breast cancer risk. Recall of the risk figure is more accurate when the clinical geneticist has given this to the woman as an odds ratio rather than in other formats. Subsequent health behaviour is unaffected by whether women have an <b>audiotape</b> record <b>of</b> their genetic consultation. Results suggest that having a precise risk figure may be less important than women taking away from the consultation an impression that something can be offered to help them manage that risk. Provision <b>of</b> an <b>audiotape</b> <b>of</b> the consultation is of limited usefulness. The need for psychological care to be better integrated into genetic counselling at cancer family clinics was highlighted by the study. The results are discussed in terms of future service development...|$|R

40|$|Open or {{uncontrolled}} {{studies have}} suggested that providing cancer patients with <b>audiotapes</b> <b>of</b> their clinical interviews can improve information recall and reduce psychological distress. We tested these hypotheses in a 'clinician-blind', prospective, randomised controlled trial. A total of 117 patients newly referred to a medical oncology clinic who were to be given 'bad news' had their consultations audiotaped. Blind to the clinician, patients were randomly allocated to receive a copy of the tape to play at home or not (control group). At 6 months follow-up, tape group patients reported positive attitudes to the audiotape and were shown to recall significantly more information about their illness than did controls. Overall improvement in psychological distress at 1 and 6 months follow-up, as measured with the 30 -item General Health Questionnaire and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale was no different in the two groups. However, a second-order interaction suggested that poor-prognosis patients were disadvantaged specifically by access to the audiotape, with less improvement in psychological distress at 6 months follow-up than non-tape controls. Patient access to <b>audiotapes</b> <b>of</b> clinical interviews promotes factual retention but does not reliably reduce psychological distress and may be actively unhelpful in some subgroups of patients...|$|R

The written portion of the project was undertaken to satisfy my personal curiosity of the men who wrote the music and the poetry of the Dichterliebe. A study of the music without knowing the man who composed it or the man who wrote the words would be only half complete at best. Likewise, a study of the men and not the music would also be incomplete.

5000|$|When someone finds {{something}} funny, {{there are}} different ways of expressing it. Common responses of humor include laughing and smiling. In 2008, a study [...] was conducted using 155 undergraduate students at North London University {{in order to measure}} responses to humor using a British comedy. The participants were divided into one of three categories: watched a video of the comedy, listened to an <b>audiotape</b> <b>of</b> the comedy, or read a script of the comedy. Approximately half of the participants were observed by an overt video camera and half were observed by a covert video camera. Results showed that participants laughed and smiled much more frequently when watching a video of the comedy and listening to the <b>audiotape</b> <b>of</b> the comedy than when reading a script. The difference in the frequency of smiling and laughing between the video and the audiotape was not significant. Participants laughed and smiled more frequently when observed by a covert video camera than an overt video camera. Aspects of the video and audiotape such as visualization of the acting, auditory representation, and also the presence of audience laughter significantly increase the frequency of laughter and smiling.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Gaining {{insight into}} the {{experiences}} of physicians and patients who were provided with an <b>audiotape</b> <b>of</b> an oncological consultation. DESIGN: Questionnaire study. SETTING: Academic Medical Hospital, Amsterdam. METHOD: Consultations with 30 consecutive patients referred to the gynaecology or urology outpatient clinic for an initial consultation regarding the diagnosis and (or) treatment policy were taped. Afterwards, patients took the tapes home. The following week they were phoned and asked {{what they had done}} with the tape and how they appreciated the intervention. By means of a questionnaire the physicians (n = 6) were asked about their experiences. RESULTS: Two patient could not be reached. Twenty-three out of 28 patients had listened to the tape, mostly together with others (spouse, relatives). Twenty-six out of 28 patients were positive about implementation <b>of</b> <b>this</b> intervention. According to most patients the tape contained information they had forgotten. Most patients found the tape contained reassuring information. Physicians regarded the optimal transmission of information achieved by this intervention as an advantage. Three out of six saw possible misinterpretation of the imparted information as a disadvantage. For some physicians, the taping of consultations led to more careful phrasing. Most physicians saw no logistical difficulties. In general, participation in the study did not take any extra time. CONCLUSION: This first study shows that both cancer patients and physicians find it useful to provide patients with an <b>audiotape</b> <b>of</b> the initial consultatio...|$|R
