5|$|Early on September22, an {{aircraft}} fix located Vera 175km (110mi) north-northeast of Saipan. Throughout {{the course of}} the day, periodic reconnaissance flights into the storm indicated that Vera had begun to rapidly intensify. By 1800UTC later that day, data analysis concluded that the tropical cyclone had reached typhoon intensity. Rapid intensification continued into the following day, as the typhoon's maximum sustained winds and barometric pressure quickly rose and fell, respectively. Concurrently, Vera's size grew to a point at which it spanned 250km (155mi) <b>across.</b> <b>At</b> 0600UTC the following day, Vera achieved its minimum estimated barometric pressure at 895mbar (hPa; 26.43inHg). This indicated a 75mbar (hPa; 2.22inHg) pressure drop in the preceding 24hours. Upon reaching its minimum pressure, Vera was estimated to have attained winds equivalent to a Category5– the highest classification possible on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. The typhoon's winds continued to increase before peaking at 1200UTC on September23, when reconnaissance aircraft reported maximum sustained winds of 305km/h (190mph). Upon peaking in wind speed, Vera was located 645km (400mi) northeast of Guam. The tropical cyclone's ability to quickly intensify was attributed to conducive atmospheric divergence and highly sustainable sea surface temperatures.|$|E
5|$|The Žirmūnai {{elderate}} occupies 5.7km² or 1.4% of {{the total}} area of the municipality of Vilnius according to data used for the 2001 census. Žirmūnai is located north of central Vilnius, along the western bank of the River Neris, on a flat plain which rises to the north. The elderate extends for about 4.4kilometres from north to south, and is about 1.5kilometres <b>across</b> <b>at</b> its widest point. The southernmost point of the Žirmūnai elderate is only some 450metres from Vilnius' Cathedral Square, in {{the centre of the}} city. Žirmūnai is bordered by the elderates of Verkiai in the north and Šnipiškės in the west, and is separated from Vilnius' Old Town and Antakalnis by the Neris. Žirmūnai's western boundary is defined by the following streets (from north to south): Verkių, Žvalgų, Kalvarijų, Žalgirio, and Rinktinės. The River Neris serves as Žirmūnai's northern, eastern and southern boundary. Žirmūnų Street is the district's main artery.|$|E
5|$|Wilfrid's {{network of}} monasteries {{extended}} <b>across</b> <b>at</b> {{least three of}} the kingdoms of England in his day. They included Hexham, Ripon, Selsey, and Oundle, as well as possibly Peterborough, Brixworth, Evesham, Wing, and Withington. At his monasteries and dioceses he built churches in a style akin {{to that of the}} continent and Rome, travelling between them with a large entourage of up to 120followers. He made many contacts and friends, not only in Northumbria and the other English kingdoms, but also in Gaul, Frisia, and Italy. Nobles sent their sons to him for fostering, and Wilfrid was known to help his protégés, no matter if they became clerics or not. The historian Peter Brown speculated that one reason for Wilfrid's exile in 678 was that he was overshadowing the king as a patron. His contacts extended to the Lombard kingdom in Italy, where they included King Perctarit and his son Cunipert.|$|E

25|$|The Upper Peninsula is {{separated}} from the Lower by the Straits of Mackinac, five miles (8km) <b>across</b> <b>at</b> the narrowest, and is connected to it by the Mackinac Bridge at St. Ignace, {{one of the longest}} suspension bridges in the world. Until the bridge was completed in 1957, travel between the two peninsulas was difficult and slow (and sometimes even impossible during winter months). In 1881, the Mackinac Transportation Company was established by three railroads, the Michigan Central Railroad, the Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad, and the Detroit, Mackinac and Marquette Railroad, to operate a railroad car ferry across the Straits. Beginning in 1923, the State of Michigan operated automobile ferries between the two peninsulas. At the busiest times of year the wait was several hours long. In winter, travel was possible over the ice only after the straits had solidly frozen.|$|E
25|$|The {{first decade}} of the twenty-first century {{featured}} many university developments as UMBC approached its fortieth anniversary in 2006. Some of these developments included the establishment of the Center for Urban Environmental Research and Education, a new partnership with the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center to develop the Goddard Earth Science and Technology (GEST) Center, as well as numerous expansions to the campus such as the University Commons, the Physics Building, Information Technology & Engineering Building and the Public Policy Building. During this time, UMBC was recognized by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (ASBMB) for being the leading producers of chemistry and biochemistry degrees, and was classified by The Carnegie Foundation as being among the top tier research universities, Doctoral/Research Universities for achieving 50 or more doctoral degrees per year <b>across</b> <b>at</b> least 15 disciplines.|$|E

25|$|Two {{swimmers}} {{were lost}} and at Ghoraniyeh and the 2/17th Battalion, London Regiment suffered severe casualties {{trying to get}} a line across the river. Later, repeated unsuccessful attempts were made to cross the river in punts and rafts. Many were drowned when Asim's German and Ottoman defenders opened fire on barges made of wood and tarpaulins stretched over framework which became waterlogged after being holed by gunfire. All attempts to put rafts <b>across</b> <b>at</b> Ghoraniyeh were defeated and Brigadier General Watson, commanding the 180th Brigade decided to concentrate all efforts at Makhadet Hijla ordering the 2/20th Battalion and the 2/17th Battalion London Regiments to reinforce the bridgehead there. Steel chains were eventually attached to trees and a temporary bridge constructed. Working under Ottoman fire, this first bridge was established by sappers from an Australian and New Zealand engineer unit which had been training for three weeks. By 01:30 a second pontoon bridge at Makhadet Hajlah had been finished by the Anzac Bridging Train.|$|E
25|$|Until {{the late}} 20th century, the Chinese {{population}} {{was limited to}} one area in lower Manhattan. The New York metropolitan area contains the largest ethnic Chinese population outside of Asia, enumerating an estimated 735,019 individuals , including at least 350,000 foreign born Chinese , making them the city's second largest ethnic group. The Chinese population in the New York City area is dispersed <b>across</b> <b>at</b> least 9 Chinatowns, comprising the original Manhattan Chinatown, three in Queens (the Flushing Chinatown, the Elmhurst Chinatown, and the newly emerged Chinatown in Corona), three in Brooklyn (the Sunset Park Chinatown, the Avenue U Chinatown, and the Bensonhurst Chinatown), and one each in Edison, New Jersey and Nassau County, Long Island, not to mention fledgling ethnic Chinese enclaves emerging throughout the New York City metropolitan area. Chinese Americans, as a whole, have had a (relatively) long tenure in New York City. New York City's satellite Chinatowns in Queens and Brooklyn are thriving as traditionally urban enclaves, as large-scale Chinese immigration continues into New York.|$|E
25|$|Moreover {{at a spot}} in the Park {{where there}} is a charming wood he has another Palace built of cane, of which I must give you a description. It is gilt all over, and most elaborately {{finished}} inside. It is stayed on gilt and lackered columns, on each of which is a dragon all gilt, the tail of which is attached to the column whilst the head supports the architrave, and the claws likewise are stretched out right and left to support the architrave. The roof, like the rest, is formed of canes, covered with a varnish so strong and excellent that no amount of rain will rot them. These canes are a good 3 palms in girth, and from 10 to 15 paces in length. They are cut <b>across</b> <b>at</b> each knot, and then the pieces are split so as to form from each two hollow tiles, and with these the house is roofed; only every such tile of cane has to be nailed down to prevent the wind from lifting it. In short, the whole Palace is built of these canes, which (I may mention) serve also for a great variety of other useful purposes. The construction of the Palace is so devised that it can be taken down and put up again with great celerity; and it can all be taken to pieces and removed whithersoever the Emperor may command. When erected, it is braced against mishaps from the wind by more than 200 cords of silk.|$|E
