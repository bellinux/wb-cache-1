5|$|At the time, {{immunology}} {{was becoming}} more sophisticated, with the increasing role of molecular biology and biochemistry. Burnet was suspicious of {{the direction in which}} immunology was headed, and the increasing emphasis on technology and more intricate experiments, and colleagues felt that Burnet's conservative <b>attitude</b> <b>was</b> a factor in his decision to turn the institute's focus to immunology.|$|E
5|$|Before {{researchers}} took active {{interest in}} it, {{the field of}} 17th-century British song had not been investigated. Music historian Charles Burney had a negative opinion towards British vocal music in this period.

5|$|Buczynski welcomed {{a number}} of friends and flatmates, {{including}} Geraci, into the Huntington coven, and later stated his desire to personally initiate Geraci up to the third degree; Saperton disagreed, citing the traditional Gardnerian prohibition on anyone initiating {{a member of the}} same sex. Buczynski thought that her <b>attitude</b> <b>was</b> homophobic, and subsequently abandoned both her and Gardnerian Wica. Meanwhile, he and Geraci moved out of their crowded apartment into a new flat in Middle Village. Despite same-sex marriage not being legally recognised at the time, they undertook a private wedding ceremony to marry one another, although were non-monogamous, and would go together to gay bath houses to partake in sexual activity with other patrons, resulting in Buczynski's contraction of several sexually transmitted infections.|$|E
40|$|The social {{psychology}} literature on <b>attitudes</b> <b>is</b> reviewed. The structure of <b>attitudes</b> <b>is</b> examined {{in terms of}} two conceptual issues: whether <b>attitudes</b> <b>are</b> made up of one or three components and whether the evaluative aspect of <b>attitudes</b> <b>is</b> unidimensional or bidimensional. The possible functions of <b>attitudes</b> <b>are</b> considered, and the relations between attitudes and higher-order constructs such as values and ideologies are discussed. Numerous characteristics of <b>attitudes</b> <b>are</b> defined, including accessibility, ambivalence, and strength. The processes involved in <b>attitude</b> formation <b>are</b> summarized, {{and the effects of}} attitudes on information processing are discussed. Finally, the issue of attitude-behavior consistency is examined, focusing on the conditions under which attitudes predict behavior strongly...|$|R

The attitude control system also used horizon scanners, sun sensors, and a command antenna. A freon gas propulsion system allowed the satellite to make fine attitude adjustments. Landsat 2 could store 30 minutes worth of data on two wide-band video tape recorders.|$|E
5|$|In June 1852 Morris entered Oxford University's Exeter College, {{although}} {{since the}} college was full, he only went into residence in January 1853. He disliked {{the college and}} was bored by {{the manner in which}} they taught him Classics. Instead he developed a keen interest in Medieval history and Medieval architecture, inspired by the many Medieval buildings in Oxford. This interest was tied to Britain's growing Medievalist movement, a form of Romanticism that rejected many of the values of Victorian industrial capitalism. For Morris, the Middle Ages represented an era with strong chivalric values and an organic, pre-capitalist sense of community, both of which he deemed preferable to his own period. This <b>attitude</b> <b>was</b> compounded by his reading of Thomas Carlyle's book Past and Present (1843), in which Carlyle championed Medieval values as a corrective to the problems of Victorian society. Under this influence, Morris's dislike of contemporary capitalism grew, and he came to be influenced by the work of Christian socialists Charles Kingsley and Frederick Denison Maurice.|$|E
5|$|Słowacki {{was not a}} {{very popular}} figure in Paris, nor among his contemporaries. He wrote many dramas, which can be seen as his {{favorite}} genre, yet he was a playwright who never saw any of his work performed on stage (only Mazepa was staged during his lifetime, and not in his presence). His works, written in Polish, dense with Slavic myths, philosophy and symbols, were difficult to translate to other languages. Słowacki's unpopularity among other Polish émigrés can be attributed to his unwillingness to pander to contemporary tastes; and in particular, his refusal to comfort his compatriots, shaken by the loss of Polish statehood and the failure of the November Uprising. Słowacki's ironic and sometimes pessimistic <b>attitude</b> <b>was</b> not appreciated by his contemporaries, nor was his denial of Polish uniqueness.|$|E
40|$|Some {{models of}} {{attitude}} {{have speculated that}} affectively based <b>attitudes</b> <b>are</b> more accessible than cognitively based <b>attitudes.</b> However there <b>are</b> also reasons to expect that affectively based <b>attitudes</b> may not <b>be</b> generally faster and that any accessibility advantage would hold only at high levels of attitude extremity. Two studies of attitudes with affective and cognitive structural bases examined this possibility. In both studies, no overall effect of attitude bask on extremity emerged, but attitude extremity did moderate the effects of basis. Affectively based <b>attitudes</b> <b>were</b> expressed faster than cognitively based ones only when <b>attitudes</b> <b>were</b> more extreme, and they tended to be expressed more slowly when <b>attitudes</b> <b>were</b> less extreme. These results may have arisen because only strong affect is seen as more diagnostic of true attitude, producing faster responses...|$|R

5000|$|Functional {{attitude}} theory (FAT) {{suggests that}} beliefs and <b>attitudes</b> <b>are</b> influential to various psychological functions. <b>Attitudes</b> can <b>be</b> influential on many {{processes such as}} being utilitarian (useful), social, relating to values, or a reduction of cognitive dissonance. They can be beneficial and help people interact with the world. In the late 1950s when psychoanalysis and behaviorism reigned supreme as the foci of psychological studies, Smith, Bruner, and White (1956) and Katz (1960) [...] separately and independently developed typologies of human attitudes {{in relation to the}} functions to which they believed the attitudes served [...] This theory proposes that <b>attitudes</b> <b>are</b> held by individuals because they are important and integral to psychological functioning.

5|$|The {{circumstances}} surrounding the advance to power in 1269 of the next ruler, Traidenis, are not clear. From the outset his relationships with Galicia–Volhynia were tense and eventually resulted in the 1274–1276 war. Traidenis was successful in battle, and his control over Black Ruthenia was strengthened. Traidenis, known for his strong anti-German <b>attitude,</b> <b>was</b> also successful in fighting with the Livonian Order. In 1270 he won the Battle of Karuse, fought on ice near Saaremaa. However, in 1272 the Order retaliated, attacking Semigalia and building Dünaburg (Daugavpils) Castle in 1273 on lands nominally controlled by Traidenis. Several years later, in 1281, Traidenis conquered Jersika Castle in the present-day Preiļi District, {{and was able to}} exchange it for the Dünaburg Castle. Dünaburg remained a Lithuanian outpost until 1313. In 1279 the Order attacked Lithuanian lands, reaching as far as Kernavė, but on their way back they suffered a major defeat in the Battle of Aizkraukle. The Order's master, Ernst von Rassburg, died in the battle, and the conquered Semigallians rebelled. The Semigallians were now willing to acknowledge Lithuania's superiority and asked Traidenis for assistance. However, Traidenis died soon afterwards, and the rebellion was not successful.|$|E
5|$|Wooten {{initially}} {{wanted a}} night landing, {{which would give}} tactical surprise and maximise the time for unloading the landing ships before Japanese aircraft put in an appearance; {{but there would be}} no moon on 4 September, so Barbey was uncertain that {{he would be able to}} correctly locate the beaches. H-Hour was therefore set at 06:30, which was twenty minutes after sunrise. Because the air force had commitments to support the 7th Division's landing at Nadzab the following day, air cover would not be available in the afternoon. Barbey therefore wanted the ships to depart at 11:00. This raised the question of whether the ships could be unloaded in just 4½ hours. Barbey gave assurances that unloading would continue even under Japanese air attack. For Australian officers with memories of the Tobruk Ferry Service, where the Royal Navy and Royal Australian Navy had lost 25 ships keeping the port's garrison supplied, the US Navy's <b>attitude</b> <b>was</b> not good enough.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Yugoslav Army (Vojska Kraljevine Jugoslavije, VKJ) {{was quickly}} {{overwhelmed}} by the combined German, Italian and Hungarian assault. Much of its equipment was obsolete, its military strategy was outdated and its soldiers were ill-disciplined and poorly trained. To make matters worse, many of the VKJ's Croat personnel refused to fight the Germans, whom they considered liberators from Serb oppression. This <b>attitude</b> <b>was</b> shared by many soldiers of the 40th Infantry Division Slavonska's largely Croat 108th Regiment, which was stationed in Veliki Grđevac. The regiment had been mobilized in Bjelovar, and on 7 April was marching towards Virovitica to take up positions, when its Croat members revolted and arrested the Serb officers and soldiers. Led by Captain Ivan Mrak, the regiment disarmed a Yugoslav gendarmerie post in Garešnica and began marching back to Bjelovar alongside a band of Ustaše rebels under Mijo Hans. The following morning, elements of the 108th Regiment entered Bjelovar and clashed with the local gendarmerie, sustaining losses of two killed and three wounded. At about noon, the regiment joined up with elements of the 42nd Infantry Regiment and other units of the 40th Infantry Division. At around the same time, Julije Makanec, the Croat mayor of Bjelovar, joined Ustaše official Ivan Šestak and HSS representative Franjo Hegeduš in demanding that the VKJ surrender the town to the rebels. When the 4th Army's commander, General Petar Nedeljković, learned of the rebel approach, he ordered the local gendarmerie commander to maintain order, but was advised that {{this would not be}} possible as local Croat conscripts would not report for duty. Fourth Army headquarters reported the rebels' presence to the headquarters of the 1st Army Group, which requested that HSS leader Vladko Maček intervene with the rebels. Maček agreed to send an emissary to the 108th Infantry Regiment urging them to obey their officers, to no avail.|$|E
40|$|This article {{adds to the}} {{literature}} on worker attitudes towards unions by investigating the impact of cultural attitudes and the call centre labour process on union attitudes among call centre workers in Britain and India. It is hypothesised that workers with egalitarian and collectivist cultural <b>attitudes</b> will <b>be</b> {{more likely to have}} pro-union attitudes than other workers, although if the impact of cultural <b>attitudes</b> <b>is</b> mediated by history and institutions, it might be expected that this relationship is stronger for British than Indian workers. Conversely, if union <b>attitudes</b> <b>are</b> largely a function of the call centre labour process, we would expect union <b>attitudes</b> to <b>be</b> similar among workers in both countries. Our results only partially support our hypotheses. Collectivist <b>attitudes</b> <b>are</b> only weakly related to union attitudes among the British sample but are more strongly related in the Indian sample. There are significant differences between union attitudes among our British and Indian samples. The article concludes that relationship between cultural attitudes and union <b>attitudes</b> <b>are</b> heavily dependent on institutional context. Cultural <b>attitudes</b> <b>are</b> unlikely to be either a constraint or a facilitator of union efforts to organise workers...|$|R

50|$|Thus, <b>attitudes</b> <b>are</b> {{not always}} a clear {{prediction}} of behavior, resulting in the ‘value-action gap’. The decision-making process is hard to predict as positive <b>attitudes</b> <b>are</b> not followed by positive intentions, and what shapes behavior is a complex process. Even if values are high, few people take environmental actions which involve changes to their lifestyle and often environmental actions can be unrelated to particular concerns an individual may have.
