5|$|A PlayStation 3 {{version of}} Oblivion was {{released}} on March 20, 2007 in North America, and April 27, 2007 in Europe, following delays similar to those for the Xbox 360 release.

A plan to distribute content through downloads paid by micropayment was initially met with criticism by customers due to its alleged low value, but later releases—at a reduced price, <b>and</b> <b>with</b> <b>more</b> content—proved more popular.|$|E
5|$|Despite this, and at Godley's urging, {{a further}} attack was planned for 12 October, this time using the New Zealand Division and the Australian 3rd Division. By now {{the ground was}} a sea of mud {{and a lack of}} {{preparation}} on the part of Godley's corps headquarters hampered the preliminary movements of the attacking divisions and supporting artillery. Godley's plans for the attack were overly ambitious and beyond the scale of previous operations that had been mounted earlier in the month in better weather and ground conditions <b>and</b> <b>with</b> <b>more</b> time to prepare. The operation on 12 October proved to be a failure with limited gains and heavy losses in the attacking divisions. After the battle, Godley downplayed the losses in the New Zealand Division (which amounted to around 2,900 casualties) and overstated the gains made in official correspondence to Allen, and a friend, Clive Wigram, who was the assistant private secretary to King George V.|$|E

Lupton writes that Angelou resolves this conflict by subordinating her needs to her child's.|$|E
