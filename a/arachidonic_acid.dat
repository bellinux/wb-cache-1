5|$|Examples of biologically {{important}} {{fatty acids}} include the eicosanoids, derived primarily from <b>arachidonic</b> <b>acid</b> and eicosapentaenoic acid, that include prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and thromboxanes. Docosahexaenoic acid {{is also important}} in biological systems, {{particularly with respect to}} sight. Other major lipid classes in the fatty acid category are the fatty esters and fatty amides. Fatty esters include important biochemical intermediates such as wax esters, fatty acid thioester coenzyme A derivatives, fatty acid thioester ACP derivatives and fatty acid carnitines. The fatty amides include N-acyl ethanolamines, such as the cannabinoid neurotransmitter anandamide.|$|E
5|$|P. acnes also provokes skin {{inflammation}} {{by altering}} the fatty composition of oily sebum. Oxidation of the lipid squalene by P. acnes {{is of particular}} importance. Squalene oxidation activates NF-κB (a protein complex) and consequently increases IL-1α levels. Additionally, squalene oxidation leads to increased activity of the 5-lipoxygenase enzyme responsible for conversion of <b>arachidonic</b> <b>acid</b> to leukotriene B4 (LTB4). LTB4 promotes skin inflammation by acting on the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) protein. PPARα increases activity of activator protein 1 (AP-1) and NF-κB, thereby leading to the recruitment of inflammatory T cells. The inflammatory properties of P. acnes can be further explained by the bacterium's ability to convert sebum triglycerides to pro-inflammatory free fatty acids via secretion of the enzyme lipase. These free fatty acids spur production of cathelicidin, HBD1, and HBD2, thus leading to further inflammation.|$|E

40|$|Eicosapentaenoic and <b>arachidonic</b> <b>acids</b> in {{extracts}} of Phytophthora infestans mycelium {{were identified}} as the most active elicitors of sesquiterpenoid phytoalexin accumulation in potato tuber slices. These fatty acids were found free or esterified in all fractions with elicitor activity including cell wall preparations. Yeast lipase released {{a major portion of}} eicosapentaenoic and <b>arachidonic</b> <b>acids</b> from lyophilized mycelium. Concentration response curves comparing the elicitor activity of the polyunsaturated fatty acids to a cell-free sonicate of P. infestans mycelium indicated that the elicitor activity of the sonicated mycelium exceeded that which would be obtained by the amount of eicosapentaenoic and <b>arachidonic</b> <b>acids</b> (free and esterified) present in the mycelium. Upon acid hydrolysis of lyophilized mycelium, elicitor activity was obtained only from the fatty acid fraction. However, the fatty acids accounted for only 21 % of the activity of the unhydrolyzed mycelium and the residue did not enhance their activity. Centrifugation of the hydrolysate, obtained from lyophilized mycelium treated with 2 n NaOH, 1 molarity NaBH 4 at 100 °C, yielded a supernatant fraction with little or no elicitor activity. Addition of this material to the fatty acids restored the activity to that which was present in the unhydrolyzed mycelium. The results indicate that the elicitor activity of the unsaturated fatty acids is enhanced by heat and base-stable factors in the mycelium...|$|R
5|$|Within {{minutes of}} systemin perception, the cytosolic Ca2+ {{concentration}} increases, and linolenic acid is released from cell membranes after a phospholipase has been activated. Linolenic acid is then converted to jasmonic acid via the octadecanoid pathway and jasmonic acid activates defensive genes. Production of methyl jasmonate is induced by systemins and also upregulates systemin precursor genes creating a feedback loop, amplifying the defensive signal. Methyl jasmonate is volatile and can therefore activate {{systemic acquired resistance}} in neighbouring plants, preparing their defences for attack. These signalling events are analogous to the cytokine-mediated inflammatory immune response in animals. When the inflammatory response is activated in animals, MAPKs are activated which in turn activate phospholipases. Lipids in the membrane are converted to <b>arachidonic</b> <b>acid</b> and then to prostaglandins, which are analogs of jasmonic acid. Both pathways can be inhibited by suramin.|$|E

The resulting oversupply of omega-6 fatty acids, particularly <b>arachidonic</b> <b>acid</b> (AA), {{is an important}} factor in the pathogenesis of {{metabolic syndrome}}. <b>Arachidonic</b> <b>acid</b> (with its precursor - linoleic acid) serve as a substrate to the production of inflammatory mediators known as eicosanoids, whereas the arachidonic acid-containing compound diacylglycerol (DAG) is a precursor to the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) while fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) mediates the metabolism of <b>arachidonic</b> <b>acid</b> into anandamide. Anandamide can also be produced from N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine via several pathways.

Atherosclerotic risk factors, the internal carotid artery (ICA) plaque, and serum ratios of eicosapentaenoic to <b>arachidonic</b> <b>acids</b> (EPA/AA) and docosahexaenoic to <b>arachidonic</b> <b>acids</b> (DHA/AA) were assessed in 286 patients. The relationship among these risk factors, WMH, and cognitive function was evaluated using WMH grading and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Results. The development of WMH was associated with aging, hypertension, ICA plaques, and a low serum EPA/AA ratio (< 0. 38, obtained as the median value) but {{was not related to}} dyslipidemia, diabetes, smoking, and a low serum DHA/AA ratio (< 0. 84, obtained as the median value). In addition, the MMSE score deteriorated slightly with the progression of WMH (29. 7 ± 1. 0 compared to 28. 4 ± 2. 1, P< 0. 0001). Conclusions. The progression of WMH was associated with a low serum EPA/AA ratio and accompanied minimal deterioration in cognitive function.

40|$|Gel-filtered human {{platelets}} were stimulated with 5 i. u. of thrombin/ml {{for times}} up to 1 min.

However, <b>arachidonic</b> and stearic <b>acids</b> were less abundant in phosphatidic acid (PtdA) and diacylglycerols in non-stimulated platelets. A transient decrease in the mass of PtdIns(4, 5) P 2 was observed after 5 - 10 s of thrombin stimulation, followed by an increase after 30 s. The amounts of PtdIns 4 P and PtdIns decreased throughout the experiment. A transient accumulation of stearoylarachidonoylglycerol was observed at 5 s, whereas stearoylarachidonoylglycerol 3 -phosphate (PtdA) was produced in increasing amounts throughout the experiment. The decrease in inositol-containing phospholipids was not fully compensated for by the production of diacylglycerol or PtdA [or PtdIns(4, 5) P 2] at 1 min. All the changes in inositol phospholipids, as well as those observed in diacylglycerols and PtdA, were due to a parallel reduction or increase in the contents of stearic and <b>arachidonic</b> <b>acids,</b> with a stoichiometry equal to 1. Taken together, this suggests an interconversion of all these lipids with the utilization of a common backbone, stearoylarachidonoylglycerol.

40|$|The {{effect of}} fatty acids on LXR (liver X receptors) -mediated {{enhancement}} of ABCA 1 (ATP-binding cassette transporter A 1) expression and cholesterol efflux {{was investigated in}} human intestinal cells CaCo- 2. LXR activation by T 0901317 increased basolateral cholesterol efflux to lipoprotein particles isolated at a density of 1. 21 g/ml or higher. Oleic and <b>arachidonic</b> <b>acids</b> attenuated the amount of cholesterol isolated from these particles. Stearic, linoleic and docosahexaenoic acids also decreased cholesterol efflux from basolateral membranes, with the polyunsaturated fatty acids being the most potent. Although oleic, <b>arachidonic</b> and docosahexaenoic <b>acids</b> modestly decreased ABCA 1 mRNA levels in response to LXR activation, stearic and linoleic acids did not. Except for oleic acid, all fatty acids substantially attenuated an increase in ABCA 1 mass secondary to LXR activation. Inhibiting acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase activity prevented the decrease in cholesterol efflux caused by oleic acid. Thus, in response to LXR activation, all fatty acids decreased the efflux of cholesterol from the basolateral membrane of CaCo- 2 cells.

40|$|Long chain {{polyunsaturated}} {{fatty acids}} (PUFA) such as docosahexaenoic and <b>arachidonic</b> <b>acids,</b> which are enriched in the brain, {{are important for}} multiple aspects of neuronal development and function including neurite outgrowth, signal transduction and membrane fluidity. Recent studies show that PUFA are capable of improving hippocampal long-term potentiation, learning ability of aged rats, and cognitive function of humans with memory deficits, although the underlying mechanisms are unknown. There have been several reports studying physiological roles of G-protein coupled receptor 40 (GPR 40) in the pancreas, but no {{studies have focused on}} the function of GPR 40 in the brain. As GPR 40 was recently identified in neurons throughout the brain, it is probable that certain PUFA may act, as endogenous ligands, on GPR 40 at their cell surface. However, the effects of PUFA upon neuronal functions are still not clearly understood. Here, although circumferential, a combination of in vitro and in vivo data is introduced to consider the effects of docosahexaenoic and <b>arachidonic</b> <b>acids</b> on brain functions. GPR 40 was found in the newborn neurons of the normal and postischemic hippocampi of adult macaque monkeys, while the positive effects of PUFA upon Ca 2 + mobilization and cognitive functions were demonstrated in both GPR 40 gene-transfected PC 12 cells and human subjects with memory deficits. The purpose of this review is to propose a putative link among PUFA, GPR 40, and hippocampal newborn neurons by discussing whether PUFA can improve memory functions through GPR 40 activation of adult-born neurons. At present, little is known about PUFA requirements that make possible neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus. However, the idea that 'PUFA-GPR 40 interaction might be crucial for adult neurogenesis and/or memory' should be examined in detail using various experimental paradigms. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
