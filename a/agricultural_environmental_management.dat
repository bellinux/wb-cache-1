However, without doubt Africa is the region where biotechnologies are the least developed.

From studies conducted by the Biotechnology Trust of Zimbabwe (BTZ) in 2001 and 2002, and studies by other {{organizations such as the}} Rockefeller Foundation and International Service for National Agricultural Research, {{it can be seen that}} the main area in which biotechnology techniques are being applied in southern African countries is agriculture, with the major thrust being crop improvement. Techniques such as tissue culture are being applied in almost all the countries, mainly because of the less intensive nature of this technique in terms of human and infrastructural resources. Modern biotechnological techniques, which include genetic engineering, are being employed in few of the countries, namely Malawi, South Africa, and Zimbabwe, and to a small extent in Mauritius and Zambia. Of all these countries, only South Africa has reached the commercialization stage insofar as products of genetic engineering are concerned. The rest are still at the laboratory research stage...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the long and complex process of {{integrating}} environmental objectives into the agricultural policy of the EU. The greening process was reinforced with the Cap reform in Agenda 2000, and especially with inclusion of agri-environmental measures in rural development plans {{and the introduction of}} horizontal regulation. The process has gained momentum on the strength of two sets of factors: i) the issue of potential health hazards in food; ii) the Agenda 2000 mid-term review. Altogether, the integration of <b>environmental</b> objectives with <b>agricultural</b> and rural development policies has been partial and incomplete so far, mainly because it is based on conditionality to sector-based tools with different goals.

By 2050 a 70 per cent {{increase in production}} {{will be needed to}} feed an additional 2. 7 billion people on an already degraded natural resource base. In light of this and amid the realities of climate change, the agricultural sector is now coming to terms with its potential role for contributing to – rather than diminishing - environmental, institutional, social and economic resilience. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to highlight the importance of <b>environmental</b> <b>management</b> and governance in the agricultural sector; to present environmental goals, requirements, entry points, and strategies/approaches to capacity development for the environment (CDE) in this sector; and to discuss implications for donors. The focus is on CDE in a developing country context. The paper recognises that CDE must be seen as part of an endogenous process of change, and that it must operate at multiple levels: the enabling environment, the organisation, and the individual. The paper argues that CDE should focus on the sustainable production and provision of sufficient, safe, and nutritious food that simultaneously builds and reinforces ecosystem resilience, leading to equitable and economically viable livelihoods at an adequate scale.

40|$|Updating {{categorical}} soil maps {{is necessary}} for providing current, higher-quality soil data to <b>agricultural</b> and <b>environmental</b> <b>management</b> but may not require a costly thorough field survey because latest legacy maps may only need limited corrections. This study suggests a Markov chain random field (MCRF) sequential cosimulation (Co-MCSS) method for updating categorical soil maps using limited survey data provided that qualified legacy maps are available. A case study using synthetic data demonstrates that Co-MCSS can appreciably improve simulation accuracy of soil types with both contributions from a legacy map and limited sample data. The method indicates the following characteristics: (1) if a soil type indicates no change in an update survey or it has been reclassified into another type that similarly evinces no change, it will be simply reproduced in the updated map; (2) if a soil type has changes in some places, it will be simulated with uncertainty quantified by occurrence probability maps; (3) if a soil type has no change in an area but evinces changes in other distant areas, it still can be captured in the area with unobvious uncertainty. We concluded that Co-MCSS might be a practical method for updating categorical soil maps with limited survey data...|$|R

40|$|Temporal {{prediction}} of soil moisture and evapotranspiration has {{a crucial role}} in <b>agricultural</b> and <b>environmental</b> <b>management.</b> A lack of Irish models for predicting evapotranspiration and soil moisture conditions for arable soils still represents a knowledge gap in this particular area of Irish agro-climatic modelling. The soil moisture deficit (SMD) crop model presented in this paper is based on the SMD hybrid model for Irish grassland (Schulte et al., 2005). Crop and site specific components (free-draining soil) have been integrated in the new model, which was calibrated and tested using soil tension measurements from two experimental sites located on a well-drained soil under spring barley cultivation in south-eastern Ireland. Calibration of the model gave an R 2 of 0. 71 for the relationship between predicted SMD and measured soil tension, while model testing yielded R 2 values of 0. 67 and 0. 65 (two sites). The crop model presented here is designed to predict soil moisture conditions and effective drainage (i. e., leaching events). The model provided reasonable predictions of soil moisture conditions and effective drainage within its boundaries, i. e., free-draining land used for spring cereal production under Irish conditions. In general, the model is simple and practical due to the small number of required input parameters, and due to model outputs that have good practical applicability, such as for computing the cumulative amount of watersoluble nutrients leached from arable land under spring cereals in free-draining soils. peer-reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The Sandveld {{region in}} the Western Cape is a low {{rainfall}} area dominated by agricultural production using groundwater resources. The rise in agricultural production in the Sandveld has led to questions regarding the region's ecological sustainability. We developed a system dynamics model for the Sandveld system which captures land-use change, agricultural production, and groundwater abstraction and recharge. Using this model, we find little evidence that pressures on livelihoods result, either currently or in the immediate future, from ecological feedback effects. The model does indicate that the highest risks {{are associated with the}} financial viability of agriculture, in its present form, in the region. With lower margins, a drive towards economies of scale in agricultural production is more likely in the future. This process has had severe implications in some sectors already, with a 39 % {{decrease in the number of}} potato producers in the Sandveld region between 2003 and 2009. These results highlight that an integrated approach to <b>agricultural,</b> economic and <b>environmental</b> <b>management</b> and planning is needed to capture the economic and ecological complexity and dynamics of the Sandveld system...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{estimating}} and predicting {{spatial distribution of}} a spatial stochastic process, observed at irregular locations in space, is considered in this paper. Environmental variables usually show spatial dependencies among observations, with lead one to use geostatisticalmethods to model the spatial distributions of those observations. This is particularly important {{in the study of}} soil properties and their spatial variability. In this study geostatistical techniques were used to describe the spatial dependence and to quantify the scale and intensity of spatialvariations of soil properties, which provide the essential spatial information for local estimation. In this contribution, we propose a spatial Gaussian linear mixed model that involves (a) a non-parametric term for accounting deterministic trend due to exogenous variables and (b) a parametric component for defining the purely spatial random variation due possibly to latent spatial processes. We focus here on the analysis of the relationship between soil electrical conductivity and Na content to identifyspatialvariations of soilsalinity. This analysis can be useful for <b>agricultural</b> and <b>environmental</b> land <b>management...</b>|$|R
40|$|Analysis {{was made}} of 3, 923 records of 162 wild Passiflora {{specimens}} to assess the distribution of their diversity in Colombia, identify collection gaps, and explore their potential as indicator species. Despite variable collecting density among and within biogeographic regions, the Andean region clearly presents a higher species richness, particularly in the central coffee growing zone and the departments of Antioquia, Cundinamarca and Valle del Cauca. The elevational distribution of diversity shows a small peak below 500 m, and two higher ones between 1, 000 - 2, 000 and 2, 500 - 3, 000 m. This pattern corresponds to divergent adaptive trends among infrageneric divisions. The analysis on 19 climatic variables showed that the two principal variance components, explaining 77 percent of the total, are respectively associated with temperature and precipitation, without influence of seasonality. Distribution parameters allow recognizing more than 36 narrow endemics. Prediction of species distribution showed nine areas with very high richness (predicted sympatry of 41 to 54 species) in the Andean region, three of which correspond to collection gaps. Endemics were not particularly frequent there, so a prioritization of protected areas based on species richness would not favor their conservation. The sites with high Passiflora diversity are poorly represented in {{the current system of}} protected areas. Instead, their striking correspondence with ecotopes of the coffee growing zone imposes a conservation strategy integrating <b>agricultural</b> and <b>environmental</b> <b>management</b> at the landscape level. Reciprocally, several traits of Passiflora species make them particularly suited as indicators for any effort of conservation or restoration in this region of importance for the country.

40|$|AbstractA {{thorough}} understanding {{of the variation in}} total soil element concentrations is important especially in the Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) soil contexts for <b>agricultural</b> and <b>environmental</b> <b>management</b> at large scale. Fingerprinting of soil elemental composition may form a useful basis for evaluating soils in a way that relates to soil-forming factors and inherent soil functional properties. The objectives of this paper are to quantify the proportion of variability in total elemental composition by total X-ray fluorescence (TXRF) method of 1074 soil samples from the Africa Soil Information Service (AfSIS) Project baseline and to determine the relationships with soil forming factors. The samples were from 34 sentinel sites measuring 10 × 10 km, randomized within major climate zones in SSA. Within each sentinel site there were sixteen spatially stratified 1 km 2 clusters, within which there were ten 100 m 2 plots. The within and between site patterns of variation in total element composition of 17 elements; Al, P, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, Sr, Y, Ta, and Pb, were explored. Total element concentration values were within the range reported globally for soil Cr, Mn, Zn, Ni, V, Sr, and Y and higher than reported range for Al, Cu, Ta, Pb, and Ga. There were significant variations (P 70 % of variation in soil element composition patterns can be predicted using information in existing databases or readily observable features. Successful use of TXRF technique would open up possibilities for using total soil elemental composition fingerprints as a useful basis for characterizing soils in a way that relates to soil-forming factors and inherent soil functional properties...|$|R
40|$|In situ soil {{moisture}} monitoring networks {{are critical to}} the development of {{soil moisture}} remote sensing missions as well as <b>agricultural</b> and <b>environmental</b> <b>management,</b> weather forecasting, and many other endeavors. These in situ networks utilize a variety of sensors and installation practices, which confounds the development of a unified reference database for satellite calibration and validation programs. As part of the Soil Moisture Active Passive Mission, the Marena, Oklahoma, In Situ Sensor Testbed (SMAP-MOISST) was initiated to perform inter-comparisons and study sensor limitations. Soil moisture sensors that are deployed in major monitoring networks were included in the study, along with new and emerging technologies, such as the Cosmic Ray Soil Moisture Observing System (COSMOS), passive/active distributed temperature sensing (DTS), and global positioning system reflectometers (GPSR). Four profile stations were installed in May of 2010, and soil moisture was monitored to a depth of 1 m on an hourly basis. The four stations were distributed within a circular domain of approximately 600 m diameter, adequate to encompass the sensing range of COSMOS. The sensors included in the base station configuration included the Stevens Water Hydra Probe, Campbell Scientific 616 and 229, Decagon EC-TM, Delta-T Theta Probe, Acclima, and Sentek EnviroSMART capacitance system. In addition, the Pico TRIME system and additional time-domain reflectometry (TDR) systems were deployed when available. It was necessary to apply site-specific calibration to most sensors to reach an RMSE below 0. 04 m 3 m - 3. For most sensor types, a single near surface sensor could be scaled to represent the areal-average of a field domain by simple linear regression, resulting in RMSE values around 0. 03 m 3 m - 3. </p...|$|R

Heim, Termitomyces tyleranus (Otieno), Termitomyces clypeatus (Heim), Volvariella speciosa (Fr. ex Fr.) Singer and Polyporus tenucuilus (Beauv.) Fr. Mushrooms were {{collected during the}} same rainy season (March–June, 2013) from humid and sub-humid agro-ecological zones, with their caps curved downwards before shedding off spores. Identification of the mushrooms was done both locally (at source) and macroscopic features of the mushrooms were examined at the College of <b>Agricultural</b> Sciences and <b>Environmental</b> <b>Management,</b> Department of Botany, Makerere University. On-site samples were prepared for DNA assays, whereby health fresh tissues of mushrooms were aseptically removed from the inner part of the caps, placed between clean papers, labeled and wrapped in aluminum foil. The necessary information concerning each mushroom species such as the habitat, substrate and any associations was sent together with the mushrooms for scientific identification at the Key Laboratory of Systematic Mycology and Lichenology, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China. Molecular identification was done by amplifying and sequencing the Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS 4 and ITS 5) of the nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrDNA) of the mushrooms. The sequenced DNA fragments were compared with data set obtained from NCBI GenBank. Herbarium specimens were prepared and deposited in the Makerere University Herbarium.|$|R
