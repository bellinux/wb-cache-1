40|$|The {{majority}} of UK oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) is September-sown on heavy clay soils where straw has been incorporated following the cereal harvest in August. A series of germination, emergence and field experiments {{was conducted to}} assess the effects of variation in seed quality on establishment and to evaluate the improvements possible by mother crop nitrogen management and pre-sowing seed treatments on commercial and farm-saved seedlots. In germination experiments designed to examme the performance of commercial seed lots at temperatures ranging between 5 and 25 °C significant differences were recorded in the speed and unifonnity of germination, particularly at 10 and 15 °C, which are comparable to UK field temperatures in late-August to September. The analysis of Apex variety seeds grown from nitrogen-managed mother crops in 1996 and 1998 showed a negative correlation between their nitrogen and oil percentage, which was significantly affected by both the <b>amount</b> (<b>kg</b> ha - 1) and timing (vegetative growth period or flowering period) of nitrogen application.

40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} was to extend the {{knowledge}} about correlation of current fatty acids (FAs) profile of cow milk fat at herds of cows (n= 134) at summer pasture period in mountain dairy farms in Slovakia to milk production and quality parameters. The FAs composition of individual milk was determined by GC-MS, where 54 FAs were identified. Saturated fatty acids (SAFA) (70. 48 ± 4. 04 % in the milk fat) show in the first third of lactation highly significant positive correlation coefficients (r> 0. 45, P < 0. 01) with all indicators of milk production (days, {{the total amount of}} milk fat and protein in kg). Monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) (26. 26 ± 3. 59 %) have to the total milk production significant indirect relationship. Their content decreases with the rise of the total <b>amount</b> (<b>kg)</b> of produced fat (r=- 0. 426), protein (r=- 0. 494), milk (r=- 0. 514), and with the increasing number of days of lactation (r=- 0. 583, P < 0. 001). Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (3. 26 ± 0. 069 %) show negative correlation coefficients to total amount of produced milk, fat, protein (kg) and the number of days in lactation from r=- 0. 468 to r=- 0. 485 (P < 0. 01).

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether feed intake amount and feed intake behaviour could be related to oestrus in dairy cows. Furthermore, we investigated whether oestrus had an effect on daily milk yield. A total of 138 oestrus cycles, leading to conception of 100 cows, were analysed. The parameters "daily fresh matter intake <b>amount</b> (<b>kg)</b> ", "daily number of visits to the feeding trough" and "time spent feeding per day (min) " were electronically measured and recorded. For a sub-quantity of all animals, daily milk yield (kg) was recorded continuously and stored in the herd management software. Special attention was given to the day of oestrus, which was defined as the day of successful insemination. All remaining days of the oestrus cycle were considered as the reference period. Among all animals and cycles, fresh matter intake amount per day, number of visits per day, and time spent feeding per day were reduced by 10. 3, 9. 1 and 20. 8 %, respectively, on the day of oestrus. Fresh matter intake was significantly lower in primiparous cows than in multiparous cows. However, number of visits to the trough and time spent feeding per day were significantly higher in primiparous cows compared to multiparous cows. Day of oestrus did not have a significant effect on daily milk yield, as this parameter was characterized by high variation among all days of the oestrus cycle. In conclusion, if an RIC system is used, monitoring of feeding behaviour appears to be a potential auxiliary aid in oestrus detection...|$|E

Feeding silage or hay to milking cows is profitable in both countries. The income-cost ratio and the net benefit ($/ cow/day) due to feeding these feedstuffs are positive. Farmers with milking cows in Honduras realise a higher income-cost ratio and net benefit due to feeding silage and hay than farmers in Costa Rica. Likewise, beef cows or young livestock supplemented with these feeding alternatives don't loose weight during the dry season. In Honduras as well in Costa Rica, it is profitable to feed silage or hay to beef cows or young livestock. Currently, no silage and a small hay market exist in Honduras.

40|$|Little {{information}} on fine roots that {{play an important}} role in nutrient cycling was available in tropical rainforests. Distribution of fine root production and effects of selective logging on root biomass and nutrient content change were studied in the tropical rainforests of south-western Cameroon. Twenty five root samples were excavated in each of two soil depths (0 - 10 and 10 - 25 cm) and in each of three undisturbed forests (Ebom, Ebimimbang and Nyangong) and one disturbed forest by logging, using a square metallic frame of 25 x 25 cm and 30 cm high. Root samples were categorized in three diameter classes: fine (&# 60; 2 mm), small (2 - 5 mm) and medium roots (5 - 20 mm). Root biomass of three diameter classes and nutrients (N, Ca, Mg, K, Na and P) of the two first diameter classes were determined. Results have shown that total root biomass varied from 9. 62 (Ebom) to 29. 88 t ha- 1 (Ebimimbang); those of fine roots decreased from Nyangong (7. 43 t ha- 1) to Ebom (1. 74 t ha- 1). In the top soil, the fine root biomass was 2 to 4 time lower in Ebom (1. 43 t ha- 1) than in other undisturbed forests (3. 28 and 5. 87 t ha- 1).

Three crossbreeding systems and a synthetic breed development were evaluated, namely; (a) straight breeding system that utilised pure Small East African goat (SEAG) where parental lines were maintained to generate the desired terminal crosses, (b) three-breed crossbreeding system that utilised SEAG as pure breed, Galla goat (GG) as the first cross sire breed, and Improved Boer goat (IBG) as the terminal sire, (c) two-breed rotational crossbreeding system where the SEAG and IBG were purebreds, and (d) synthetic breed development system utilising SEAG X IBG.

Dobrogea is a region characterised as having rich soils with optimum values of chemical elements, but high water deficits. The experiment {{was carried out in}} a peach orchard at the Research Station for Fruit Growing Constanta on a calcareous chernozem showing high fertility.

The mowed sod versus the clean cultivation system between the tree rows determined a significant increase in dry matter by 2 % and in ash by 16 % after four years of study. The values of other studied chemical components of the fruit (sugar content, total acidity, phosphorus, potassium and pH) were not significantly influenced by the SMS between tree rows.

40|$|The {{potential}} of hyperspectral proximal sensing to quantify sward characteristics important in making critical {{decisions on the}} management of sheep and dairy pastures in New Zealand has been investigated. Hyperspectral data were acquired using an ASD FieldSpec® Pro FR spectroradiometer attached to the Canopy Pasture Probe (CAPP). The CAPP was developed to enable the collection of in situ reflectance data from New Zealand pasture canopies independent of ambient light conditions. A matt white ceramic tile was selected as a reflectance standard {{to be used with}} the CAPP, after testing a variety of materials. Pasture reflectance factor spectra between 350 - 2500 nm (with spectral resolutions of 3 nm between 350 - 1000 nm and 10 nm between 1000 - 2500 nm) and pasture samples were collected from six hill country and lowland areas, across all seasons (August 2006 to September 2007) in a number of regions in the North Island of New Zealand. After pre-processing (e. g. spectral averaging, de-stepping, elimination of noisy wavelengths, smoothing) the spectral data collected from sites were correlated against pasture botanical composition (expressed as proportions of grass, legume and weed) and pasture nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, sodium and sulphur) expressed in percentage of dry matter (%) and <b>amount</b> (<b>kg</b> ha- 1) using partial least squares regressions (PLSR). The accuracy and precision of the calibrations were tested using either the full cross-validation leave-one-out method or testing datasets. Regressions were carried out using the reflectance factor data per se and after mathematical transformation, including first derivative, absorbance and continuum-removed spectra. Overall best results were obtained using the first derivative data. The quality of predictions varied greatly with the pasture attribute, site and season. Some reasonable results were achieved for the prediction of pasture grass and legume proportions when analysing samples collected during autumn (grass: R 2 > 0. 81 and SD/RMSEP 2. 3 and legume: R 2 > 0. 80 and SD/RMSEP 2. 2), but predicting pasture weed content was poor for all sites and seasons (R 2 = 0. 44 and SD/RMSEP = 1. 2). The inaccurate predictions might be {{explained by the fact that}} the diversity found in the field and observed in the pasture spectral data was not taken into account in the pasture botanical separation. The potential for using proximal sensing techniques to predict pasture nutrients in situ was confirmed, with the sensing of pasture N, P and K increased by the procedure of separating the data according to the season of the year. The full {{potential of}} the technology will only be realised if a substantial dataset representing all the variability found in the field is gathered. The importance of obtaining representative datasets that embrace all the biophysical factors (e. g. pasture type, canopy structure) likely to affect the relat ionship, when building prediction calibrations, was highlighted in this research by the variance in the predictions for the same nutrient using different datasets, and by the inconsistency in the number of common wavelengths when examining the wavelengths contributing to the relationship. The ability to use a single model to predict multiple nutrients, or indeed individual nutrients, will only come through a good understanding of the factors likely to influence any calibration function. It has been demonstrated in this research that reasonably accurate and precise pasture nutrient predictions (R 2 > 0. 74 and SD/RMSEP 2. 0) can be made from fresh in situ canopy measurements. This still falls short of the quality of the predictions reported for near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) for dried, ground samples analysed under controlled laboratory condition...|$|E

Despite these predictions, measurements of exchangeable calcium show no differences beneath mature forest and acid grassland, implying that i) weathering rates in forest soils are greater than long-term estimates and predictions by the PROFILE soil chemistry model ii) the trees can access other sources of calcium or iii) there are significant errors in the mass balance.

Whole-tree harvesting would allow for seven rotations after the first crop. These calculations assume that all sources of calcium are equally available to the crop. This can only be resolved by dynamic modelling of the calcium cycle at the ecosystem scale based on appropriate field measurements. The potential for significant soil acidification is therefore greater following whole-tree harvesting and, in line with current recommendations (Nisbet et al., 1997), this technique should probably be avoided on acidic, nutrient-poor soils unless remedial measures are included to enhance the soil base cation status...|$|R

Crous testified that five <b>amounts</b> of 300 <b>kg</b> were reserved for five separate bombs. One of the planned bomb attacks was cancelled as there was too high a risk of white civilians being injured. The bombs were to be detonated on December 13, 2002, with various attacks planned to follow the bombings.|$|R

The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the effect of baits on bottom trap catchment and catch differences with coconut, cassava, rubber seed, and non-feed (as control) feed. In the waters of Kampar Kanan. Then the data collected and analyzed are the catch data in the <b>amount</b> of weight (<b>kg),</b> the type, the length of the fish (cm), the number of weight per species of fish (gr), the number of catch (tail), and environmental parameters...|$|R
50|$|Town hall's clock {{has been}} working {{continuously}} since 1901. ist constructor was a resident of Slupsk, and his name was OTTO PILA. The chimes were added to clock in 1973 (one phrase of Karol Szymanowski's IV Symphony). The load of the clockwork <b>amounts</b> to 36 <b>kg</b> and it is at most 2 seconds slow per day. In 1998 the resident of Slupsk, Jacek Stańczyk, composed town's bugle-call. Every day at midday, the recording of the call, performed by musicians of Polish Philharmonic Sinfonia Baltica, Jerzy Lis, Jan Buczko and Mieczysław Gach (trumpet and 2 French horns) rings out from the town hall's tower.|$|R
40|$|The ANAIS (Annual {{modulation}} with NaI(Tl) Scintillators) experiment aims at {{the confirmation}} of the DAMA/LIBRA signal using the same target and technique at the Canfranc Underground Laboratory (LSC). 250 kg of ultra pure NaI(Tl) crystals {{will be used as}} target, divided into 20 modules, 12. 5 kg mass each, and coupled to two high efficiency photomultiplier tubes from Hamamatsu. The ANAIS- 25 set-up at the LSC consists of two prototypes, <b>amounting</b> 25 <b>kg</b> NaI(Tl), grown from a powder having a potassium level under the limit of our analytical techniques, and installed in a convenient shielding at the LSC. The background has been carefully analyzed and main results will be summarized in this paper, focusing on the alpha contamination identified in the prototypes and the related background contributions. Status of fulfillment of ANAIS experimental goals and prospects for the building of ANAIS- 250 experiment will be also revised.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{increasing}} amounts of mineral nitrogen (90, 120, 150 kg·ha- 1) liquid (80 t·ha- 1) and solid manure (45 t·ha- 1) those of inoculation with Azotobacter chroococcum (the strain 84) on the soil proteolytic activity and corn yield grown in monoculture were surveyed over the 3 -year-long research work. The research results indicated that proteolytic activity and corn yield depended highly on the fertiliser sorts, amounts and on the research year too. Over the first research year, the highest proteolytic activity was recorded on the variants with organic fertilisers, whereas the fertiliser stimulating effect markedly decreased, particularly with liquid manure over the following {{two years of the}} research. Mineral fertilisers were also found to remarkably stimulate the biological parameters we have been concerned above, particularly the mean N <b>amount</b> (120 <b>kg</b> · ha- 1). While the highest corn yield could be obtained using 120 kg N · ha- 1 throughout all the research years, its insignificant rise and barely altered soil proteolytic activity using corn seed inoculation with 84 Azotobacter chroococcum could be noticed...|$|R
50|$|Elephants are herbivores, {{consuming}} ripe bananas, leaves, bamboo, tree bark, {{and other}} fruits. Eating occupies 18 hours of an elephant's day. They eat 100-200 kilograms of food per day. A cow (female) will eat 5.6 {{percent of her}} body weight per day. A bull (male) will eat 4.8 percent. Thus a 3,000 kilogram cow will consume 168 kg per day, a 4,000 kg bull 192 kg per day. As elephants can digest only 40 percent of their daily intake, the result is dung <b>amounting</b> to 50-60 <b>kg</b> daily. As elephants will not eat in unclean surroundings fouled by dung, their instinct is to roam to a new area.|$|R
