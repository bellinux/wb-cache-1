40|$|After the Enlargement of the European Union in 2004, {{around a}} million Accession State {{migrants}} {{arrived in the}} United Kingdom, with Polish migrants constituting the largest group. There is {{a growing body of}} literature focusing on their migratory patterns, networks, labour market performance, and identity. However, little has been said so far about the Polish migrants' relationship with law in the United Kingdom. This thesis asks: how do the Polish post- 2004 EU Enlargement migrants form their relationship with the law, and what are the factors that affect this? It focuses on the intricacies of migrants' choices of `semi-legal' over legal status, subsequent legalization strategies, and the interpretations of legality they result in. Socio-legal integration has so far been viewed solely via state legal frameworks, following the traditional approach of the `law-first' perspective. This thesis argues {{that it is not the}} institutional arrangements and legal architecture alone that decide the nature of migrants' semi-legal relationship with law in the host society. A more comprehensive insight into the socio-legal integration of migrants is possible only when we combine in the analysis the interplay between the structural factors of the host country's legal environment, migrants' agency and the culturally derived values, attitudes, behaviour and social expectations towards the law and its enforcement. The thesis therefore makes a case for a `proper' recognition of migrants' legal culture in the study of their socio-legal integration. The thesis concludes that semi-legality, as an initial response to the legal environment is not static, but changing. As a result, migrants' socio-legal integration is extended in time and gradual. Migrants' legality could be discussed at two levels - at the behavioural level and at the level of a value. Changing status between the two poles of legality and illegality brings with it greater <b>appreciation</b> <b>of</b> <b>legality</b> as a value. This research presents a strong argument that the relationship between behaviour and attitudes to law could be meaningfully investigated in an applied domain of the new socio-legal environment.

40|$|Although the new Criminal Code made {{a series}} of {{amendments}} to the criminal legislation, the regulation of the principle <b>of</b> <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> criminalisation has not been significantly changed, but only {{from the point of view}} of the structure of governing rules. Thus, while the previous Criminal Code regulated through a single provision both the <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> criminalisation and the <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> criminal penalties, the new Criminal Code has split the content of the principle <b>of</b> <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> criminalisation and criminal penalties into two principles - the <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> criminalisation and the <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> criminal penalties, by allocating them two separate articles in Chapter I of Title I of the General Part.

40|$|For interpretivist {{theories}} of law {{it is the}} value <b>of</b> <b>legality</b> that informs what counts as true legal propositions. The leading theory <b>of</b> <b>legality</b> in the interpretivist school is Ronald Dworkin’s ‘Law as Integrity’. This paper suggests that Dworkin’s view fails to account for several features of modern legal practices, particularly those that deal with international and comparative legal standards. It also highlights some inconsistencies in law as integrity as a conception of the value <b>of</b> <b>legality</b> and suggests an alternative conception to correct for them. The result of this conception <b>of</b> <b>legality</b> provides the major thesis of this paper. This is that under an interpretivist theory, true propositions of law never conflict with what morality demands...|$|R

40|$|This study aims to {{establish}} {{what level of}} development has the Principle <b>of</b> <b>Legality</b> reached in national jurisdictions {{as well as in}} international law.   The study analyses the developments and treatment of the Principle <b>of</b> <b>Legality</b> in international criminal law by means of an analysis of several national jurisdictions and international law;  in Scotland, England, the United States, Mexico and South Africa.   After this, the deduction of the rules <b>of</b> <b>Legality</b> were identified and compared with international developments in international human rights law and international criminal law was made and conclusions formulated. The various legal systems represent different ways of considering the Principle <b>of</b> <b>Legality,</b> taking into account the general aspects of retroactivity, strict construction and foreseeability as guidelines for this study.   Therefore, {{it was not possible to}} extract a general understanding of the Principle <b>of</b> <b>Legality,</b> and even the consideration of minimum standards was a complex task. Despite these obstacles some conclusions could be reached regarding the evolution of the Principle <b>of</b> <b>Legality</b> in international criminal law.   The Principle <b>of</b> <b>Legality</b> seems to be in a very early state of development in international criminal law.   There seem to be some basic rules that are recognised in treaties, but the courts and the drafters of criminal definitions have not given the Principle the same scope at domestic legislatures and courts.   However, the Rome Statute seems to provide for a system where the Principle <b>of</b> <b>Legality</b> could be respected, since its text gives the broadest scope of any treaty so far.   However, for now there is still a lot of work to be done, if we aspire to create a respectful system of international criminal law, since the existing rules do not comply with the expected minimum standards.

40|$|Accompanying {{the rise}} of new {{transnational}} legal rules and institutions intended to promote global economic integration are questions about the linkages between transnational legality and constitutional law. In what ways does transnational economic law mimic features of national constitutional law? Does transnational law complement in some ways or supersede in other ways what we typically describe as constitutional law? To these questions we can now add the following: are transnational rules and institutions a proper subject of study for comparative constitutionalists? This chapter makes a case for the incorporation of forms <b>of</b> transnational <b>legality</b> into comparative constitutional studies. 1 Taking as its focus the regime of international investment law, I argue that an <b>appreciation</b> <b>of</b> the constitutional functions <b>of</b> transnational <b>legality</b> deepen understandings <b>of</b> how constitutional law develops within, across, and beyond national systems of law.

40|$|The {{principle}} <b>of</b> <b>legality</b> is {{a principle}} of social and State life consisting in the compliance with the legal norms by all participants in social relations. In any rule of law, enforcement <b>of</b> <b>legality</b> requires the duty of every citizen to follow the general provisions of the law. The principle <b>of</b> <b>legality</b> is a universal principle that requires all subjects of legal relations {{to comply with the}} law in their work. Due to the fundamental importance of laws, and mainly <b>of</b> the Constitution, <b>legality</b> is considered {{a principle of}} constitutional democracy. The order of law is another legal category close as concept to legality. It is an essential element in society’s life. The order of law is obtained when the principle <b>of</b> <b>legality</b> prevails, that is, when all people comply with the law. The order of law is a status of social relations governed by legal rules that correspond to the requirements of laws and other normative acts. The concepts <b>of</b> <b>legality</b> and order <b>of</b> law are close and interdependent. The order of law can not exist without legality, and legality weakens if there are flaws in the order of law...|$|R

40|$|The concept <b>of</b> <b>legality</b> is {{a crucial}} one for the {{definition}} of many shared-memory consistency conditions. As originally defined, a sequence of operations on a given object is legal {{if it is in}} the set of valid sequences specified for that object. Being thus defined on totally ordered sets of operations, the notion <b>of</b> <b>legality</b> is not fully realistic, because parallel executions on sharedmemory multiprocessing systems are best represented by partially ordered sets of operations. It is conceivable, therefore, that the eventual derivation of practical systems based on consistency models that rely on some form <b>of</b> <b>legality</b> will tend to be excessively heavy on the required synchronization. In this paper, we introduce an alternative definition <b>of</b> <b>legality</b> that is based on partially ordered sets of operations. Our treatment starts with a system model that makes very few assumptions on machine architecture, and proceeds to employ a graph-theoretic formalism to handle the normally troublesome issue of write multiplicity and to characterize legality. Using this same formalism, we argue that the novel definition <b>of</b> <b>legality</b> is consonant with the one on totally ordered sets of operations, so it carries the same intuitive appeal intended by the original definition...|$|R

40|$|Under Swedish tax law; {{the general}} {{clause in the}} Tax Avoidance Act is a method to prevent tax evasion. The purpose of the general clause is to prevent any tax {{avoidance}} procedures that the legislator {{has not been able}} to foresee. For the general clause to be applicable, four prerequisites need to be met. This thesis analyses the fourth prerequisite based on the principle <b>of</b> <b>legality.</b> The prerequisite concludes that a determination of the tax base, based on the procedure in question, is in conflict with the purpose of the legislation. The prerequisite has been criticized for being difficult to apply. As tax laws are applied beyond the scope of the legislation, it has also been considered that taxation is made without statutory basis, which is conflicting with the principle <b>of</b> <b>legality.</b> The principle <b>of</b> <b>legality</b> requires the application of law to be predictable and without arbitrary. Therefore, in order to collect taxes there is a requirement of legal authority. Of this requirement, it has been deduced a prohibition on application by analogy of tax laws. Of relevance to the relation between the fourth prerequisite and the principle <b>of</b> <b>legality</b> is what legal value the principle is considered to have. It has been discussed whether the principle <b>of</b> <b>legality</b> can be codified in the constitution. It has been found that the principle <b>of</b> <b>legality</b> is expressed in the Instrument of Government. It is not considered to be any controversies between the fourth prerequisite and the principle <b>of</b> <b>legality,</b> as there is a legal authority for the taxation that occurs under the general clause. It is also not considered to be any illicit delegations, as the courts only rule on whether the practice is in contrast to tax legislation purposes, and not legislate. The taxpayer therefore has to take the purpose of the legislation into consideration when measures are taken for tax avoidance purposes...|$|R

Consequently, actor of wrongdoing will not be criminally prosecuted unless penal statutes prohibit {{what he or she}} has done.

In addition, this article also reexamines the legality principle. It is found that from both ontological and axiological bases, legality principle has shortcoming in that it relies upon statute rather than the substance of the conduct that may harm another.
