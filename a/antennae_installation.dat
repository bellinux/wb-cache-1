40|$|Abstract In this paper, we {{proposed}} a new direction finding(DF) technology using TDOA(time-difference of arrival) and PDOA(phase difference of arriving signal) method. The proposed technology has a good DF accuracy without DF ambiguity. TDOA or PDOA technology is used to the most of intelligence systems in 21 century. The principle of TDOA is to receive a signal with two parallel antennas, measure the time difference of arrival signal, and converse the time difference to the direction of incident signal. Those technology make a DF system small size but the DF accuracy is low into short <b>antenna</b> <b>installation</b> distance. The principle of PDOA is similar to TDOA except measuring the phase difference of arrival signal, These technology get a good DF accuracy in short <b>antenna</b> <b>installation</b> distance but have a DF ambiguity.

50|$|In 1943, Lorenz was {{instructed}} to adapt Hohentwiel for naval use, and soon the Hohentwiel appeared on U-boats, small surface ships, and coastal installations.There are two U-boat versions of the FuG 200 Hohentwiel used during World War II; FuMO 61 Hohentwiel U and the FuMO 65 Hohentwiel U1. The U-boat versions were easier to maintain and more reliable compared with the other versions. However, the U-boat versions had several disadvantages, the smaller dimension of the antenna and {{the height of the}} <b>antenna</b> <b>installation.</b> The <b>antenna</b> was restricted to a smaller dimension as it had to fit within a small area on the port side of the conning tower. In addition, the reduced height of the <b>antenna</b> <b>installation</b> impaired the range. Both U-boat versions had ranges of between 8 and 10 km for naval targets and between 15 and 25 km at an altitude of 200 m. Resolution was about 3 degrees, and at short range its range accuracy was 100 m. Both U-boat versions worked at a frequency 556 MHz and had four rows of six dipoles. Before the U-boat could dive, the antenna needed to be retracted into a well on the conning tower. Both U-boat antenna versions were 1400 mm wide by 1000 mm in height, and total overall dimensions of the antenna frame was 1540 by 1022 mm.|$|R

50|$|On 99.1, {{the station}} had to {{maintain}} lower {{power and a}} slightly directional antenna due partly to WDEN-FM 99.1 in Macon, which often caused RF interference with the station, particularly early on calm mornings due to overnight temperature inversions that enhance radio propagation. It was required to run at less than 100 watts due to the proximity of WRAS FM 88.5, since the intermediate frequency (IF) of 10.7 MHz used in radio tuners puts the station's IF at 88.4, overlapping {{the lower half of}} 88.5's channel.

40|$|Mobile {{communication}} {{radio channel}} vanes very rapidly {{at times and}} causes very hard to predict its behavior and characteristics. Even if the channel does not explicitly change, speed of the mobile user and the surrounding will contribute to these variations causing many problems for mobile communication. Therefore study of Indoor signal propagation {{is an important factor}} in arriving at a good mobile network design. Most of the work carried out in this area is specific for a particular country, region or area as evident by previous researches. Research specific to an area is essential since deals with surrounding buildings, environment and especially in the case of indoor propagation building material used for construction. In this research the radio signal strengths inside a building were measured for two cases; one where the transmitter is an outdoor <b>antenna</b> <b>installation</b> and the other where the transmitter is an indoor <b>antenna</b> <b>installation.</b> Literature surveyed propagation models, equations and other graphs were used to map the measured and analyzed signal strength values, attenuation characteristics, propagation characteristics. Principal objectives of the research were to determine how these parameters fit into best model(s) and determine the parameters appropriately to suit the conditions in Sri Lankan context. The parameters obtained are of similar range with other literature surveyed values such as path loss exponent, floor attenuation factor and partition attenuation factor values. The parameters obtained can be used for any commercial software used in indoor signal strength estimations as the starting values for signal strength optimization and in order to obtain better results in terms of optimum signal coverage and optimum antenna placement. Generalization of these parameters for Sri Lankan context can be done once similar type of analysis is carried out in many buildings in Sri Lank...|$|R
