500|$|In August, the {{preparations}} extended to laying depots; an early party established a depot [...] {{to the south}} of the main hut—a grotto in the ice known as Aladdin's Cave—but returned without the dogs. Mertz and two others set off to rescue the dogs, but in heavy winds covered less than a mile in two hours, and returned to the hut. [...] "If it depended only on me," [...] Mertz wrote in his diary, after four days' more wind confined them to the hut, [...] "we would be in our sleeping bags outside in the snow, and we would at least try to find the dogs. Mawson is definitely too cautious, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> he would show enough gumption during the sledging expedition." [...] The following day Mertz was part of a party of three that made it to Aladdin's Cave to rescue the dogs; when strong winds confined them to the depot for three days they spent the time expanding the cave.|$|E
60|$|This is my seventieth birthday, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> you {{all rise}} {{to the size of}} that proposition, realizing all the {{significance}} of that phrase, seventieth birthday.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "it wouldn't do to put {{anything}} that wasn't pretty on a neck like that, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> you {{would let me}} fix it." ...|$|E
60|$|Steele's {{face was}} bloodless now, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> {{it had to}} do with her scathing scorn or {{something}} that he hid with his hand closing his coat that way.|$|R
60|$|But {{the stain}} upon our family {{was a source}} of unpleasantness to us. I fully {{believed}} my father innocent, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> the time would ever come when his character would be cleared.|$|R
6000|$|<b>And,</b> [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> am aphoristic <b>and</b> subtle? <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> {{when she}} gets the rice-powder off, Claire isn't a lot more like Milt than she thought?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Winston quietly, [...] "I {{have only}} my word to offer, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> you will believe me now, but I don't think I ever won five dollars at cards in my life." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{looked so}} {{occupied}} that I was really afraid to disturb you," [...] said the woman. [...] "Shafton is talking Canadian politics with somebody, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> {{you are too}} busy to find a chair for me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, say, girl, Mrs. Appleby and I are {{thinking}} of renting one of these here bungalonies, like the fellow says, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> we could {{take a look at}} this house, to see how it looks furnished?" ...|$|E
60|$|And then, at last, {{the truth}} flashed across me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> {{should be in}} time. Ours was the first boat, {{and it would be}} unkind of me to spoil the man’s picture, I thought.|$|R
60|$|She was lion-hearted. I {{could not}} help feeling admiration for the {{extraordinary}} woman. Surely she could not sacrifice her children! <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> a man {{would have had the}} courage to give that bold answer to Savello's threats.|$|R
6000|$|... "I saw they'd got to {{the agrarian}} laws of Caius Gracchus, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> they knew {{anything}} about the agrarian troubles in Ireland. But all they knew about Ireland was that Dublin was on the Liffey. So <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> they'd ever heard of General Gordon." ...|$|R
60|$|At length, a cold hand is laid upon my shoulder, and I awake. The wild faces have {{vanished}} and all is silent now, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> {{the whole thing}} has been a dream. My father lifts me into the dog-cart, and we drive home through the chill dawn.|$|E
6000|$|MY DEAR CHARLES, - The {{above is}} my story, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> any light can be thrown on it. I prefer the girl's father dead; and the {{question}} is, How in that case could Lieutenant George Murray get his order to 'apprehend' and his power to 'sell' her in marriage? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{the poet}} {{replied with a}} long breath, [...] "you are right about that dreamy weft of {{leafless}} twigs against the hard, blue sky; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> we quite {{do justice to the}} beauty of winter, of age, we poets, when we are so glad to have the spring come." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{have you}} been doing ever since you left Plescow? I inquired after you the other day, when our troops broke up Schlippenbach's force on the Embach. I found you were not among the prisoners, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> you were among the killed." ...|$|R
60|$|As I {{turned back}} to sit down once more I heard two men get up from behind a number of packing-cases on the pier, <b>and</b> walk away. <b>I</b> had not noticed them before, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> they had overheard the {{conversation}} which had taken place.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{told that}} Commodore Barney keeps his men jumpin' so lively at fightin' that they don't {{have time for}} anythin' else," [...] the lad said slowly, as if {{speaking}} to himself, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> he counted that the commodore could raise the price of oysters.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is a heavy}} misfortune, doubtless; and Ellen will grieve as a {{daughter}} should," [...] replied Mrs. Melmoth, speaking with the good sense of which she had a competent share. [...] "But she has never known her father; and her sorrow must arise {{from a sense of}} duty, more than from strong affection. I will go and inform her of her loss. It is late, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> she be still asleep." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Mr. Hodder," [...] {{she cried}} impulsively, [...] "was it {{necessary}} to go so far? and all at once. I am here not only because I am miserable, but I am concerned on your account. You hurt me very much that day you came to me, but you made me your friend. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> you really understand the terrible, bitter feeling you have aroused, the powerful enemies you have made by speaking so--so unreservedly?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I said, 'Do {{you believe}} in dreams?' Because last night I dreamed that I was playing in {{the final of the}} Open Championship, and I got into the rough, and there was a cow there, and the cow looked at me in a sad sort of way and said, 'Why don't you use the two-V grip instead of the interlocking?' At the time it seemed an odd sort of thing to happen, but I've been {{thinking}} it over <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> there isn't something in it. These things must be sent to us for a purpose." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I know. Gee! if {{you knew}} how I've been {{thinking}} about you all day! I've been <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> ought to-- I'm no good; blooming waster, <b>I</b> told myself; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had any right {{to try to make}} you care; but-- Oh, you must come, Goldie!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I reckon they won't go foolin' with Clark's boys again," [...] said Polly Ann, {{resuming}} {{a vigorous}} rubbing of the skillet. [...] "Ye was tellin' me about these fine folks ye fetched home." [...] She tossed {{her head in}} the direction of the open door, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> the fine folks were outside.|$|R
60|$|When {{the boat}} {{finally came to}} a {{standstill}} I was nearly suffocated for the want of fresh air, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had not been chloroformed when first assaulted. I was hoisted up by several men and placed upon my feet, and then the cords which bound me were cut and the bag was removed.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is what I {{have often}} thought, Mrs. Doctor, dear, {{and a great}} comfort it is. I do not mind nobody wanting me if the Almighty decreed it so for His own wise purposes. But {{sometimes}} doubt creeps in, Mrs. Doctor, dear, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> maybe the Old Scratch has not {{more to do with}} it than anyone else. I cannot feel resigned THEN. But maybe," [...] added Susan, brightening up, [...] "I {{will have a chance to}} get married yet. I often and often think of the old verse my aunt used to repeat: ...|$|E
6000|$|DEAR UNCLE:--I don't think I'll have [...] "Dead Man's Rock," [...] as Hope has {{two stories}} out this year, {{and he is}} a safe man to go to. The worst of it is that they are three-and-six each, and Dickson Secundus says they are continuations of each other, so it is best to have them both or neither. The two at three-and-six would make seven {{shilling}}s, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> you would care to go that length this year. I am getting on first rate with my Greek, and will do capital if my health does not break down with overpressure. Perhaps if you bought the two you would get them for 6s. 6d. Or {{what do you say to}} the housekeeper's giving me a shilling of it, and not sending the neckties? ...|$|E
6000|$|DEAR MR. TRENT,--We {{had such}} sad {{news from the}} Hall after you left. Sir William was seized {{with a kind of}} fit. It appears that he had just {{returned}} from the horse show, and had given his mare to the groom while he walked to the garden entrance. The groom saw him turn at the yew hedge, and was driving to the stables when he heard a queer kind of cry, and turning back to the garden front, found poor Sir William lying on the ground in convulsions. The doctor was sent for, and Mr. Brunton and I went over to the Hall. The doctor thinks it was something like a stroke, but he is not certain, and Sir William is quite delirious, and doesn't recognize anybody. I gathered from the groom that he had been DRINKING HEAVILY. Perhaps it was well that you did not see him, but I thought you ought to know what had happened in case you came down again. It's all very dreadful, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> that is why I was so nervous all the afternoon. It may have been a kind of presentiment. Don't you think so? ...|$|E
5000|$|Thomas told Billboard {{magazine}} {{that he wrote}} the song right after he met his future wife. [...] "We were separated {{for a few weeks}} and were on the phone all the time, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was thinking, 'I met this wonderful person,' <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> everything <b>I</b> was going through Matchbox Twenty's success {{was going to make it}} too crazy to build a relationship." ...|$|R
500|$|Judith Kirkwood of Orange Coast Magazine {{has stated}} that [...] "The Beverly Hills Hotel is such an icon that my friend, Gretchen, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> it was a mirage when the taxi pulled up in the porte cochere and {{deposited}} us on a red carpet, but {{realized that it was}} [...] "more like a peachy pink dream dusted with gold— and green and white striped accents".|$|R
5000|$|In {{later years}} Mr Clements said, [...] "Day after day I {{was on my}} knees {{chipping}} away <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> the originator of the Commandments suffered from an aching back and sore knees as I did". If you glance at the stones you will find eleven commandments the eleventh inscribed, 'A new commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another. John 13 v34.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh HE is, I know--I {{met them}} two nights ago; {{and by the}} way again--don't let me forget--I want to speak to you about his wife. But I've not seen, do you know? Mr. Longdon--which is really too awful. Twice, thrice I think, have I at moments like this one {{snatched}} myself from pressure; but there's no finding the old demon at any earthly hour. When do YOU go--or does he only come here? Of course I see you've got the place arranged for him. When I asked at his hotel at what hour he ever IS in, blest if the fellow didn't say 'very often, sir, about ten!' And when I said 'Ten P. M.?' he quite laughed at my innocence over a person of such habits. What ARE his habits then now, and what are you putting him up to? Seriously," [...] Vanderbank pursued, [...] "I AM awfully sorry <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if,</b> the first time you've a chance, you'd kindly tell him you've heard me say so and that I mean yet to run him to earth. The same really with the dear Mitchys. I didn't somehow, the other night, in such a lot of people, get at them. But I sat opposite to Aggie all through dinner, and that puts me in mind. I should like volumes from you about Aggie, please. It's too revolting of me not to go to see her. But every one knows I'm busy. We're up to our necks!" ...|$|E
60|$|The slinking tramp is of {{the same}} hopeless order, and has the same injured {{conviction}} on him that you were born to whatever you possess, and never did anything to get it: but he is of a less audacious disposition. He will stop before your gate, and say to his female companion {{with an air of}} constitutional humility and propitiation--to edify any one who may be within hearing behind a blind or a bush--'This is a sweet spot, ain't it? A lovelly spot! <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> they'd give two poor footsore travellers like me and you, a drop of fresh water out of such a pretty gen-teel crib? We'd take it wery koind on 'em, wouldn't us? Wery koind, upon my word, us would?' He has a quick sense of a dog in the vicinity, and will extend his modestly-injured propitiation to the dog chained up in your yard; remarking, as he slinks at the yard gate, 'Ah! You are a foine breed o' dog, too, and YOU ain't kep for nothink! I'd take it wery koind o' your master if he'd elp a traveller and his woife as envies no gentlefolk their good fortun, wi' a bit o' your broken wittles. He'd never know the want of it, nor more would you. Don't bark like that, at poor persons as never done you no arm; the poor is down-trodden and broke enough without that; O DON'T!' He generally heaves a prodigious sigh in moving away, and always looks up the lane and down the lane, and up the road and down the road, before going on.|$|E
6000|$|Both your liberal letters {{have reached}} me, and have given me, as the missives of {{retreating}} friends never fail to do, an almost sinister {{sense of the}} rate at which the rest of the world goes, moves, rushes, voyages, railroads, passing from me through a hundred emotions and adventures, and pulling up in strange habitats, while I sit in this grassy corner artlessly thinking that the days are few and the opportunities small (quite big enough for the likes of me though the latter be even here.) All of which means of course simply that you take away my breath. But that was on the cards and it's not worth mentioning. Your best news for me is of your being, for complete convalescence, in the superlative hands you describe--to which I hope you are already doing infinite credit. I kind of make you out, [...] "down there," [...] I mean in the pretty, very pretty, as it used to be, New York Autumn, and in the Washington Squareish region trodden by the steps of my childhood, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> you ever kick the October leaves as you walk in Fifth Avenue, as I can to this hour feel myself, hear myself, positively smell myself doing. But perhaps there are no leaves and no trees now in Fifth Avenue--nothing but patriotic arches, Astor hotels and Vanderbilt palaces. (My secretary was on the point of writing the great name [...] "aster"--which I think the most delightful irony of fate! they are so flowerlike a race!) The October leaves are at any rate gathering about me here--and that I have watched them fall, and lighted my fire and trimmed my lamp, is about the only thing that has happened to me--though I should count in a visit from a delightful nephew, who has just been with me for a fortnight, and left me for Geneva, where he spends the winter.|$|E
60|$|While {{engaged in}} tidying up the office I noticed {{for the first}} time that the door of the safe stood open. This was a most unusual thing, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> my uncle had taken {{something}} out and forgotten to close it. He was a very careful man, and if he had it was the first time I had known him to do such a thing.|$|R
6000|$|... "She does, poor soul. I believe I'll go {{over and}} speak to her. I was {{introduced}} to her at Dave's but I haven't called." [...] Carol was slipping across the lawn, a white figure in the dimness, faintly brushing the dewy grass. She was thinking of Erik and {{of the fact that}} her feet were wet, and she was casual in her greeting: [...] "Hello! The doctor <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> you were lonely." ...|$|R
