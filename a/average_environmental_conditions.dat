The considered life cycle costs are: hardware, installation, maintenance, and operating costs for the solar unique components of the total system. The total system takes into consideration long term <b>average</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions,</b> loads, fuel costs, and other economic factors applicable in each of five cities. Selection criteria are based on availability of long term weather data, heating degree days, cold water supply temperature, solar insolation, utility rates, market potential, and type of solar system...|$|E
30|$|Soil half-lives {{derived from}} time series data from {{laboratory}} simulation and field studies show large variability between different tests. Extrapolation of such results to conditions {{other than those}} used in the test (e.g., <b>average</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions)</b> is a critical step that would require detailed knowledge {{about the effect of}} sorption and consideration of the large natural variability of biomass activity and biological degradation potential for the compounds of interest. Normalization for temperature and soil moisture is a common procedure in characterizing P and is required to extrapolate degradation rates to different scenarios. For the most part, normalization reduces the variability of field degradation rates measured under extreme conditions of temperature and moisture content. In order to compare field degradation rates with a single trigger value, normalization could aid arrival at a more conclusive decision. If normalization is not applied, differences in P in the field could be due to the time of application e.g., spring versus autumn. Normalization is usually not required for assessment of P in water and sediment because half-lives are mostly measured under laboratory standard conditions, e.g., room temperature.|$|E
40|$|Research PaperFisheries {{management}} {{has been carried}} out on the assumption that a fish population is in equilibrium with the fishing effort under the <b>average</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions</b> and hence there must be a maximum sustainable yield (MSY). However, since the simultaneous {{rise and fall of the}} interdecadal and global scale of sardine populations was pointed out in the early 1980 s, many other similar events of long-term changes in marine populations have been emerging, which is called regime shift. On the other hand, abundant evidence for the regime shift of climate-ocean systems has been obtained recently, which is suggested as the driving force causing the fluctuations in marine organisms. Very recently, it has become clear that even groundfish and tunas often show a tremendous increase in spite of the strong exploitation. These facts strongly show that there are no steady conditions in the oceans and the MSY is nothing but an imaginary criterion. A new paradigm of the fisheries management must be sought on the basis of the regime shift theory...|$|E
40|$|Ultraviolet (UV) {{radiation}} {{is the driving}} force of tropospheric chemistry and is furthermore detrimental to most living tissues. A three year modeling program was carried out to characterize the UV radiation in the lower atmosphere, with the objective of development a climatology of UV biologically active radiation, and of photo-dissociation reaction rates that are key to tropospheric chemistry. A comprehensive model, the Tropospheric Ultraviolet-Visible (TUV) model, was developed and made available to the scientific community. The model incorporates updated spectroscopic data, recent advances in radiative transfer theory, and allows flexible customization for the needs of different users. The TUV model has been used in conjunction with satellite-derived measurements of total atmospheric ozone and cloud amount, to develop a global climatology of UV radiation reaching the surface of the Earth. Initial validation studies are highly encouraging, showing that model predictions agree with direct measurements to ca. 5 [...] 10 % at times when <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions</b> are well known, and to 10 [...] 30 % for monthly <b>averages</b> when local <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions</b> can only be estimated remotely from satellite-based measurements.

40|$|Climatic {{variability}} in dryland production environments (E) generates variable yield and crop production risks. Optimal combinations of genotype (G) and management (M) depend strongly on E and thus vary among sites and seasons. Traditional crop improvement seeks broadly adapted genotypes to give best average performance under a standard management regime {{across the entire}} production region, with some subsequent manipulation of management regionally in response to <b>average</b> local <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions.</b> This process does not search {{the full spectrum of}} potential G x M x E combinations forming the adaptation landscape. Here we examine the potential value (relative to the conventional, broad adaptation approach) of exploiting specific adaptation arising from G x M x E. We present an in-silico analysis for sorghum production in Australia using the APSIM sorghum model. Crop design (G x M) is optimised for subsets of locations within the production region (specific adaptation) and is compared with the optimum G across all environments with locally modified M (broad adaptation). We find that geographic subregions that have frequencies of major environment types substantially different from that for the entire production region show greatest advantage for specific adaptation. Although the specific adaptation approach confers yield and production risk advantages at industry scale, even greater benefits should be achievable with better predictors of environment-type likelihood than that conferred by location alone...|$|R
40|$|The <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions,</b> mechanisms, and {{processes}} {{that resulted in}} the deposition of organic-matter-rich sediments during the early Toarcian oceanic anoxic event are still a matter of discussion. A petrographic and geochemical study was carried out using Posidonia Shale Formation (lower Toarcian) black shale samples from two wells located offshore The Netherlands in the Dutch Central Graben. This formation is a lateral equivalent of Toarcian black shale successions in northern Europe. The lower Toarcian black shales in the Dutch Central Graben exhibit a variety of depositional fabrics, sedimentary structures, and textures that indicate dynamic energetic conditions {{at the time of their}} deposition and appear to have been deposited mostly by bottom currents rather than settling from pelagic suspension. The Posidonia Shale Formation black shales are characterized by normally graded thin beds (, 10 mm thick) with erosional bases wherein cross-lamination is very common. The tops of these thin beds are commonly bioturbated. These observations are in contrast with the traditional interpretation of the deposition of lower Toarcian black shales as having taken place under a stagnant, anoxic water column via suspension settling. Black shales are commonly more heterogeneous than normally assumed and are the product of diverse sedimentary processes. Geochemical results, in combination with petrography, suggest that productivity and high accumulation rates of reactive organic matter were behind the establishment of sediment anoxia. The most organic-matter-rich shales, which are characterized by redox-element anomalies, are cross-laminated, thin-bedded shales, and each thin bed was deposited quickly, thus favoring the preservation of organic matter. The petrographic study of black shales complements geochemical data because geochemical analysis of sedimentary rocks, however high-resolution, always represents an <b>averaging</b> of <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions</b> at the time of deposition over at least several hundreds of years...|$|R
40|$|Bay of Samsun {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} oil transport gateways in Black Sea. The region is surrounded with the coasts which have various levels of environmental sensitivity. The purpose of this study is to investigate the oil spill and predict the future accidents likely to be encountered around the Bay of Samsun. To be well informed about fate, this study makes the best possible use of two trajectory models. One of them, ADIOS (Automated Data Inquiry for Oil Spills), has been applied to natural degradation calculations, and the other one, OILMAP (oil spill model and response system), has been used for surface spread simulation. Hence in order to identify the risky areas three scenarios have been developed. Their results reveal that in case of oil spills, with <b>average</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions,</b> there is a risk of contamination for the city of Samsun. Although the area under the risk is the same, contamination density is totally different depending upon the quantity and the type of spilt oil.

40|$|While {{agricultural}} research has traditionally focused on <b>average</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions,</b> environmental variability, {{independent of the}} mean, can also have biological consequences. Using lettuce (Lactuca sativa) as a model system, we tested two hypotheses: (1) increased temporal variability in water supply impacts plant growth, yield, photosynthesis, water relations, and nutrition and (2) AM fungal associations benefit this agricultural crop, especially when plants experience temporal variability in water supply. The experiment used a randomized complete block design with two blocks and three variables (each with two levels) : – mycorrhizal inoculation, high or low variability in watering intervals, and high or low total watering volume. Temporal variability in water supply, at a time scale similar to what is common in agricultural practices, had negative effects on lettuce production. Inoculation treatments were successful in doubling the extent of AMF infection in lettuce roots. There were no main effects of mycorrhizal inoculation on any measured variable, but augmented mycorrhizal associations interacted with variability in water supply to increase root/shoot ratios and decrease tissue concentrations of N and P. Successful application of AMF to sustainable agriculture probably requires a general theoretical framework for predicting when effects on plants will be beneficial versus neutral or even detrimental.

40|$|Despite {{its wide}} {{implications}} for many ecological issues, the global pattern of spatial turnover in {{the occurrence of}} species has been little studied, unlike the global pattern of species richness. Here, using a database on the breeding distributions of birds, we present the first global maps of variation in spatial turnover for an entire taxonomic class, a pattern that has to date remained largely a matter of conjecture, based on theoretical expectations and extrapolation of inconsistent patterns from different biogeographic realms. We use these maps to test four predictions from niche theory as to the form that this variation should take, namely that turnover should increase with species richness, towards lower latitudes, and with the steepness of environmental gradients and that variation in turnover is determined principally by rare (restricted) species. Contrary to prediction, we show that turnover is high both in areas of extremely low and high species richness, does not increase strongly towards the tropics, and is related both to <b>average</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions</b> and spatial variation in those conditions. These results are closely associated with a further important and novel finding, namely that global patterns of spatial turnover are driven principally by widespread species rather than the restricted ones. This complements recent demonstrations that spatial patterns of species richness are also driven principally by widespread species, and thus provides an important contribution towards a unified model of how terrestrial biodiversity varies both within and between the Earth's major land masses...|$|E
40|$|North of the equator, winds {{converge}} causing {{bands of}} heavy rain {{in a region}} called the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Due to the small-scale processes that are not fully represented by weather models, modeled rainfall and its characteristics are often not indicative of what is observed in the ITCZ. This study attempts to bridge that gap by using observations from a weather radar on Kwajalein Atoll, located within the central-western tropical Pacific, as well as reanalysis data over Kwajalein Atoll to investigate characteristics of ITCZ rainfall. Two wet seasons are analyzed to quantify rainfall variations in terms of different spatial scales, temporal <b>averaging,</b> and <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions.</b> Rain observed by the radar is first categorized as either convective (i. e., heavy and sporadic) or stratiform (i. e., light and widespread). Rain rates, conditional rain rates, and rain area are calculated for different time (10 minutes to 1 day) and spatial (2 km to 128 km) scales and then compared to specific humidity (moisture in the atmosphere), omega (vertical motion in the atmosphere), and sea surface temperature (SST) {{to determine if a}} relationship exists between the large-scale environment and the observed rainfall characteristics. The results obtained from this study hold the potential to quantify to what extent environmental factors may influence precipitation intensity and extremes at Kwajalein Atoll. Significant results can lead to calibrating weather and climate models, which creates more accurate rainfall predictions through numerical weather prediction and analysis from radars...|$|R
40|$|This {{work was}} based on {{material}} of military anthropological survey of Poland, which {{was carried out in}} the years 1921 - 1923 under the leadership of J. Mydlarski. Subject of investigation were data concerning 2569 soldiers born in the years 1899 - 1901 in Poznań province and the southern part of Pomeranian province. The purpose of this work was to evaluate the dependence between the <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions</b> and the mean body height in the population. The results are analysed {{in the light of the}} hypothesis about a selective character of the environmental influence on the population. In agreement with the accepted assumption, the mean body height in the population is influenced in a contrasting way by two partially different environmental factors: ’living conditions’ understood as the level of satisfying the basic life needs of the individual, and ’selective pressure’ being the sum of life dangers. These factors act on the individuals in a differentiated way depending on the genetic predispositions conditioning their adaptation ability, resistance and general health. The selective pressure through negative selection (differential mortality) eliminating from the population individuals who in the given living conditions develop and realize their growth potential in the poorest way limits the negative influence of living conditions on the mean body height in the population. This selection can have both a directional and stabilizing character. The mean body height of mature individuals in the population depends on the living conditions in which their development took place and on the selection degree by differential mortality. For the evaluation of the living and <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions</b> data were utilized concerning the number of children born, living and deceased in the families from which the investigated subjects originated. On this basis the <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions</b> were evaluated both in families and in the socio-professional groups distinguished on the basis of the father’s profession and the birth place ("village", "town"). In case of families, the evaluation {{was based on}} the assumption that the number of children in the family is a burdening factor, and the morality is in a great degree the effect of worse living and <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions.</b> Better <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions</b> in socio-professional groups are testified primarily by a lower percentage of deceased children in the families from which the investigated subjects belonging to the given group originate, as well as by a greater number of children. The departing point of the hypothesis accepted at the outset was the fact that in the material no definite dependence was found between the evaluated living and <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions</b> and the mean body height. The analysis of families has shown that on the average the tallest were the subjects originating from families which due to the number of living children in the family and the percentage of the deceased ones could provide the <b>average</b> living and <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions</b> (Tables 8 and 11).

40|$|A general {{allometric}} {{model has}} been derived to predict intraspeciÞc and in-terspeciÞc scaling relationships among seed plant leaf, stem, and root biomass. Analysis of a large compendium of standing organ biomass sampled across a broad sampling of taxa inhabiting diverse ecological habitats supports the relations predicted by the model and deÞnes the boundary conditions for above- and below-ground biomass partitioning. These canonical biomass re-lations are insensitive to phyletic afÞliation (conifers versus angiosperms) and variation in <b>averaged</b> local <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions.</b> The model thus identiÞes and deÞnes the limits that have guided the diversiÞcation of seed plant biomass allocation strategies. Despite its importance to ecology, global cli-mate research, and evolutionary and ecological theory, the general principles underlying how plant metabolic production is allocated to above- and below-ground biomass remain un-clear (1 – 6). Indeed, there are few large data sets with which to evaluate patterns of standing bio-mass within and across the broad spectrum of vascular plant species (2, 7). The resulting un-certainty severely limits the accuracy of models for many ecologically and evolutionarily impor-tant phenomena across taxonomically diverse communities (8 – 11). Thus, although quantita-tive assessments of biomass allocation patterns are central to biology, theoretical or empirical assessments of these patterns remain conten-tious (2, 8, 10, 11). Nonetheless, the scaling relations among standing leaf, stem, and root (below-ground) biomass (ML, MS, and MR, respectively) can be derived analytically by first noting {{that the amount of}} resource used per individual plant, Ṙ 0, approximates metabolic demand and gross photosynthesis (B) (12 – 14). Because B is pre-dicted to scale proportionally to total ML (Ṙ 0 } B} ML), theory predicts that the surface areas over which resources are exchanged with the environment (e. g., leaf surface area, which cor-relates with ML) are proportional to the 3 / 4 power of the total plant biomass (MT) (12 – 14) ...|$|R
40|$|Species {{distribution}} {{models are}} widely applied for generating the appropriate data for designing networks of reserve systems. The {{aim of the}} present study is to compare the use of presence/absence and continuous suitability data, derived from species distribution models, in reserve selection, and to detect any systematic trends in the reserve networks produced {{on the basis of these}} two types of data. The MAXENT model was applied to predict orchids’ potential distribution in east Macedonia (northeast Greece). One presence/absence and one with suitability values data set was made and used in the ZONATION decision support tool in order to prioritize the cells of the study area for inclusion in a reserve network. In the selection procedure, species weighting has been applied by using the species specialization index. Results show that the presence/absence data set favors the selection of cells with more extreme climatic conditions and more distant from the mean habitat of the study area. Furthermore, the continuous suitability data set provides higher suitability values for the specialist taxa in comparison with the presence/absence data set, while the opposite is happening for the generalist taxa. The present study reveals that the suitability data outperform the presence/absence data in reserve selection because: (a) they better represent the <b>average</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions</b> of the study area in the selected networks; (b) they ensure higher suitability values for the specialist species, which are more prone to extinction in the future; and (c) they take full advantage of species weighting according to their habitat specificity...|$|E

The quality parameters evaluated were mycoflora, mycotoxins (aflatoxins, ochratoxin A and zearalenone), water distribution (moisture content and water activity) apart from environmental conditions (relative humidity and temperature) and the relation between harvest and the industry reception timing. All cultivars presented an average waiting time of 8. 6 h (ranged from 0. 3 to 24. 9 h), a total fungi load of 8. 6 × 104 cfu/mL (ranged from 1. 8 × 103 to 9. 4 × 105 cfu/mL) with a rather high humidity condition of 19. 0 % moisture content (varied from 14. 9 % to 24. 5 %) and 0. 92 water activity (varied from 0. 78 to 0. 99) under the <b>average</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions</b> of 87. 3 % relative humidity (varied from 80. 0 % to 96. 8 %) and 25. 4 °C (varied from 22. 5 to 27. 5 °C), respectively.

40|$|Previous syntheses on {{the effects}} of {{environmental}} conditions on the outcome of plant-plant interactions summarize results from pairwise studies. However, the upscaling to the community-level of such studies is problematic because of the existence of multiple species assemblages and species-specific responses to both the environmental conditions and the presence of neighbors. We conducted the first global synthesis of community-level studies from harsh environments, which included data from 71 alpine and 137 dryland communities to: (i) test how important are facilitative interactions as a driver of community structure, (ii) evaluate whether we can predict the frequency of positive plant-plant interactions across differing environmental conditions and habitats, and (iii) assess whether thresholds in the response of plant-plant interactions to environmental gradients exists between ``moderate'' and ``extreme'' environments. We also used those community-level studies performed across gradients of at least three points to evaluate how the <b>average</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions,</b> the length of the gradient studied, and the number of points sampled across such gradient affect the form and strength of the facilitation-environmental conditions relationship. Over 25 % of the species present were more spatially associated to nurse plants than expected by chance in both alpine and chyland areas, illustrating the high importance of positive plant-plant interactions for the maintenance of plant diversity in these environments. Facilitative interactions were more frequent, and more related to environmental conditions, in alpine than in dryland areas, perhaps because drylands are generally characterized by a larger variety of environmental stress factors and plant functional traits. The frequency of facilitative interactions in alpine communities peaked at 1000 mm of annual rainfall, and globally decreased with elevation. The frequency of positive interactions in dtyland communities decreased globally with water scarcity or temperature annual range. Positive facilitation-drought stress relationships are more likely in shorter regional gradients, but these relationships are obscured in regions with a greater species turnover or with complex environmental gradients. By showing the different climatic drivers and behaviors of plant-plant interactions in dryland and alpine areas, our results will improve predictions regarding the effect of facilitation on the assembly of plant communities and their response to changes in environmental conditions...|$|E
30|$|This {{study showed}} {{similarities}} on proximate composition between both mussel products, {{consistent with previous}} findings from mussels from Galician waters as reported by Fuentes et al. (2009). This {{may be explained by}} similarities occurring within the main factors regulating growth and biochemical performance in both culture conditions. Both culture conditions have a close annual <b>average</b> in <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions,</b> the same seasonality in reproductive cycles, and/or the same genetic heritage due to geographic proximity. However, open ocean mussels exhibited a higher amount of ash when compared to commercial ones from Galician Rías. Fuentes et al. (2009) observed similar values of ash content in commercial product from Galician Rías when comparing mussel product from different Spanish regions. Higher ash content than open ocean mussels of this study were also observed in the same study in mussels from Ebro Delta and from Valencia (NE and SE Spain, respectively). Mussels cultured in the exposed <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions</b> (e.g., phytoplankton variability, strong hydrodynamics, and very marked seasonal changes in seston composition) may experience situations of stress or may have greater energetic expenditure (Azpeitia et al. 2016) than mussels cultured in sheltered conditions. Oliveira et al. (2015) found similar results when comparing open ocean mussels to sheltered cultured mussels. The authors related this difference to the hydrodynamic conditions found by mussels in the offshore culture areas, which would interfere with mussel metabolism in a set of complex interactions between temperature, food availability, growth, and reproductive cycle (Gabbot 1976). Thus, ash content is influenced by many abiotic factors such as salinity and presence of metals on the water column (Okumuş and Stirling 1998), {{as well as by the}} nutritional state and the reproductive cycle of the animal (Beninger and Lucas 1984). Regarding nutritional state, Mayzaud (1976) associated an increase in ash content of zooplankton with a state of starvation, and Wilkins (1967) observed the same in herrings. Nevertheless, this higher ash percentage may account for the decrease in other constituents (e.g., lipids, proteins) rather than an increase in the amount of ash, as data analysis was performed with relative percentages and not in absolute terms. Despite these differences in ash content, similar general properties at biochemical level should be expected when comparing the open ocean mussels from the SE Bay of Biscay to their commercial counterparts from another northern Spanish region.|$|R

40|$|A {{radiative}} transfer model for estimating snow water equivalent (SWE, mm) from satellite-observed brightness temperature (K) at 19 and 37 GHz (respectively, T(sub B(sub, sat, 19)) and T(sub B(sub, sat, 37)) over partially forested area is presented, {{as an extension}} of a previously published model, by considering scattering of radiation within the canopy. For the specific case of dense vegetation covering fractional area f, the model can be written as, SWE = alpha{ A. delta (T(sub B(sub, sat)) + B - C. f}/(l f), where delta T(sub B(sub, sat)), is the difference of T(sub B(sub, sat, 19)) and T(sub B(sub, sat, 37)), alpha(mm/K) is the slope of SWE vs. brightness temperature difference at 19 and 37 GHz that would be obtained by ignoring the presence of atmosphere, delta(T(sub B) sub g)), for a homogeneous snow cover (which varies with grain size). The parameters A, B, and C, are determined primarily by atmospheric characteristics, and for a likely range of atmospheric conditions appear to be in the range of, respectively, 1. 15 - 1. 63, 0. 69 - 2. 84 K and 0. 59 - 2. 39 K. Ignoring atmospheric correction would introduce bias towards underestimation of SWE (and also, snow cover area and snow depth). Increasing cloud liquid water path (L) has the effect of increasing A, and ignoring this variation of A with L would have the impact of biasing the estimate of SWE (and snow extent). Such biasing is further exacerbated with increasing f, because of the appearance of term (l-f) in the denominator. The impact of ignoring the intercept parameters (B and C) would be noticeable at low values of SWE (appearing as a bias towards underestimation of SWE), which has been determined to be about 6 mm for <b>average</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions.</b> The uncertainty in estimating SWE due to variations in the atmospheric characteristics is likely to be less than 15 %, but could be up to 25 % for non-vegetated snow-covered areas. Better estimates of SWE (and snow extent) would be obtained by adjusting the parameters of the above model to regional differences in the atmospheric characteristics. The biases in determining SWE arising due to variations in atmospheric conditions and due to changes in fractional forest cover are not independent, since they interact as {A/(l-f) }. The present calculations also show that improvement in determining snow cover area from the microwave data is likely to occur when these data are corrected for atmospheric effects, as demonstrated by a specific case study...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} four {{different}} aspects of primary successions on glacier forelands in South-Central Norway are investigated. First, general vegetation and environment trends, which have been observed by other scientists, were studied on two forelands. It is shown that the two selected forelands (one low- and one high-altitude foreland, Nigardsbreen and Storbreen, respectively) differ in the speed of vegetation cover change and in the overall species richness developed over the last 250 years since deglaciation. This is attributed to differences in {{the severity of the}} environment between the two forelands. Some support for an early peak in the number of species was found for the Nigardsbreen foreland, whereas the Storbreen foreland shows no significant trend in the development of species richness. Life-forms and soil-depth change on both forelands in the predicted manner. A novel approach for the use of Ellenberg indicator values for the estimation of pH-values from the existent vegetation shows highly significant correlations between predicted pH values and trends measured for similar terrain ages from a study by Messer (1988). Investigation at two different scales indicated that small-scale disturbances (< 100 m) may influence the mosaic of the environment, which affects the results of the chronosequence approach. By using a strict geometrical sampling design more variable conditions entered the analyses than with the stratified random sampling schemes adopted by others, such as Matthews (1979 b). Some loss in the power of analysing the data occurred, but the results are still consistent with hypotheses about primary succession on glacier forelands. Second, new aspects of the temporal development and successional change of plant communities were investigated on the same two forelands. There is some evidence of succession from a pioneer community to the local climax community of the surrounding area for both forelands. There is also support for the correlation of timedependent environmental variables with the successional development of plant communities. A new application of Ellenberg indicator values in ordinations was assessed for its value in estimating <b>average</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions</b> derived from the vegetation. As with the previous analyses, investigation of community development at two different scales supported the importance of sampling scale on the analysis of succession data. Third, spatially explicit analyses of distribution patterns of dominant woody species was developed as a means to investigate processes and formulate hypotheses about primary succession on glacier forelands. The data for this part of the study was collected on five glacier forelands, three low-altitude (Nigardsbreen, Austerdalsbreen and Bødalsbreen) and two high-altitude (Storbreen and Høgvaglbreen). Pattern descriptors including perimeter/area index, autocorrelation measures and fractal dimensions, support the hypothesis of differential colonisation of wind and animaldispersed species. Even more convincing is the result that low- and high-altitude forelands show significant differences in the patterns exhibited by wind and animals dispersed species. This result is thought {{to be related to the}} differences in environmental severity affecting the establishment of colonising species. Finally, logit modelling of the distributions of dominant woody species provides insights into the sampling effort needed to gather enough data for meaningful analyses. It also leads to the identification of important factors influencing the distribution of those species. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{evolution}} of animal signals is driven largely by {{characteristics of the}} signaling environment and properties of receiver sensory systems. Selection favors signal traits that increase {{the probability that a}} signal will stimulate the sensory systems of intended receivers, but not potential predators, under <b>average</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions.</b> However, environmental conditions often fluctuate, which means that a given signal property may not be equally effective at all times. One potential mechanism that an organism might employ to overcome this challenge is to modulate its signal properties as environmental conditions change in order to maintain stimulation of the receiver sensory system. In this dissertation, I explore the possible role of signal modulation using the motion detection and communication systems of tropical Anolis lizards. In order to assess the possible role of signal modulation in the communication behavior of anoles, it was necessary to determine the properties of their motion detection systems. In Chapter 2, I tested whether motion detection properties are conserved across species of anole. I adapted a behavioral assay to quantify the spatial parameters of the motion detectors of three species of Puerto Rican Anolis lizards, with each preferring a distinct structural habitat type. I then compared the results to data previously collected for anoles from Cuba, Puerto Rico, and Central America. Results indicated that all species share a minimum amplitude threshold for detecting moving objects and exhibit multiple peaks in relative response to various motion amplitudes. Fine-scale interspecific differences in the number and values of response peaks were not correlated with structural niche. Overall, the study suggests that the motion detection systems of Anolis lizards are relatively conserved, which may help explain shared features of movement-based signals in anoles. For mobile organisms, the spatial relationships of signaling individuals and intended receivers can be fluid. Such fluctuation in the distance between signalers and receivers can greatly impact signal efficacy, but it is unclear exactly how animals cope with this problem. In Chapter 3, I investigated whether signal modulation can serve as an effective strategy to cope with variation in the spacing of receivers in the environment by tuning a signal to maintain stimulation of the receiver sensory system. I evaluated this hypothesis by testing the use of modulation in the tropical lizard Anolis gundlachi in Puerto Rico. I first characterized the motion detection properties of the sensory system of A. gundlachi in the laboratory. I then measured the physical properties of movement-based headbob displays given during staged social encounters under natural conditions. I found a significant positive association between the maximum amplitude of headbob displays and the physical distance to intended receivers. Modulation occurred in response to small-scale changes in signaler-receiver distance, and signalers gave displays that fell within a range of amplitudes predicted to optimally stimulate the visual system of A. gundlachi. These findings strongly suggest that modulation of the physical properties of motion-based signals can be an effective mechanism to tune signals to both characteristics of receiver sensory systems and receiver distance, and can serve as a behavioral strategy to cope with relatively frequent changes in the spacing of individuals. Although signaling individuals must effectively capture and hold the attention of intended conspecific receivers, they must also limit eavesdropping by potential parasites or predators. However, predation pressure can vary {{over the course of a}}n individual's lifetime, or over the course of a day, thereby altering signal efficacy. In Chapter 4, I tested the hypothesis that prey can modulate the physical properties of their signals or their display behavior in order to decrease conspicuousness and potentially limit predation risk. To do so, I conducted a manipulative experiment in nature to determine the effect of predation pressure on the properties of movement-based signals and the display rate of the semiarboreal lizard Anolis sagrei. I found that male anoles reduced the maximum amplitude of headbob displays but not the proportion of time spent signaling on islands onto which predators were introduced, in comparison to males from control islands lacking the predator. Characteristics of the motion detection system and social behavior of A. sagrei show that this reduction in amplitude also decreases signal active space, which might alter the reproductive success of signaling individuals. I suggest that future studies of predator-prey interactions consider the risk effects generated by changes in signals or signaling behavior to fully determine the influence of predation pressure on the dynamics of prey populations.

The results of our research proved that the method, applied can be efficiently used to analyse the environmental responses, the behaviour under varying <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions</b> of different varieties. Varieties can adapt themselves differently to favourable and unfavourable <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions.</b> In general, varieties (e. g. older varieties, like Mv 15, Mv 20, and new varieties, like Lupus, Mv Emese) that give relatively good yields under unfavourable conditions (2 – 3 t ha − 1 <b>environmental</b> <b>average)</b> will utilise improving <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions</b> (7 – 8 t ha − 1 <b>environmental</b> <b>average)</b> to a lesser extent and vice versa. Varieties Mv 21, GK Öthalom and Mv Palotás (a currently cultivated variety) made good use of intensive growing conditions. The data in this paper may assist in choosing varieties best suited to the production and cultivation conditions of the production site. By applying stability analyses we proved that the stability of the control treatment was the most favourable over the investigation period, which good yield stability, however, manifested at very low yield levels. Our findings showed that under more intensive <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions</b> (7 – 9 t ha − 1 yield level) appropriate and optimum fertilizer application was very effective and in comparison to the control treatment the yield differences between optimal fertilizer treatments were up to as much as 1 – 6 t ha − 1.

40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} the physiological strain on industrial workers under thermal stress on extended shifts. To continuously measure deep body core temperatures, heart rates, fluid intake, changes in hydration state and physical fatigue {{in order to}} establish acceptable levels of physiological strain. To develop a rational heat stress index compatible with these limits. To design working-in-heat protocols for a self-paced workforce. Methods: A series of studies was conducted over 77 shifts on a group of approximately 50 male volunteers working in thermally stressful environments. Continuously- recorded deep body core temperatures, heart rates, fluid consumption, urinary specific gravity and physical fatigue were measured and recorded. A new field protocol was developed to assess physical fatigue over the working shift. An original methodology was developed to allow any heat stress index to be assessed on a comparative basis with any other index. A review of the commonly used occupational heat stress indices was conducted. A new rational heat stress index was developed, based on existing biophysical relationships and recommended physiological strain limits of deep body core temperature and sweat rate. New protocols designed for self-paced work incorporating the significant risk factors for heat illness were developed and implemented in a workforce of approximately 2000 workers exposed to heat stress. The previous protocols used a shortened shift as the primary intervention to protect worker health. The subsequent protocols removed the shortened shift and replaced this with a range of other interventions. Deep body core temperature, heart rate, fluid consumption, hydration state and fatigue were measured before and after the changes in protocols. Results: Comparisons of heat stress indices confirmed the wide divergence in guidance provided by many of the commonly-used indices in terms of acceptable working environments. It also highlighted a number of serious shortcomings in the most widely-used indices, especially WBGT and ISO 7933. A new, rational heat stress index called Thermal Work Limit (TWL) was developed. This included development of a computer model incorporating key thermal physiological parameters (deep body core temperature, mean skin temperature, sweat rate, skin wettedness). There was no increase in heat stress (as indicated by average workplace environmental conditions), deep body core temperature, mean heart rate, or changes in hydration status after the changes in protocols. <b>Average</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions</b> were severe (WBGT 30. 9 ° C, sd 2. 0 ° C, range 25. 7 - 35. 2 ° C). Environmental conditions in the study were much hotter than those considered acceptable under standards such as the ACGIH. The results showed that miners regularly exceeded those limits allowable under most current indices in terms of maximum deep body core temperature (avg 38. 3 ° C, std dev 0. 4 ° C), maximum temperature rise (1. 4 ° C, 0. 4 ° C) and maximum heat storage (431 kJ, 163 kJ), without reporting any symptoms of heat illness. A significant component of the observed elevated core temperatures was due to the normal circadian rhythm, which was measured at 0. 9 ° C (std dev 0. 2 ° C). Evidence was found that workers "self-pace" when under thermal stress. Fluid intake averaged 0. 8 l/h during exposure (sd 0. 3 l/h, range 0. 3 - 1. 5 1 /h). Average urinary specific gravity at start-, mid- and end of shift was 1. 0251, 1. 0248 and 1. 0254 respectively; the differences between start and mid-shift, mid and end-shift, and start and end-shift were not significant. However, a majority of workers were coming to work in a moderately hypohydrated state (urinary specific gravity avg 1. 024, std dev 0. 0059). Involuntary dehydration was not found to occur in the study group. This is in contrast to several other studies and some of the leading heat stress standards, which are {{based on the premise that}} workers are unable to maintain their hydration status when working in the heat, even when their fluid consumption is equal to their sweat rate. Continuous heart rates measured over a shift (avg 103 bpm, 14 % of shifts exceeding avg 110 bpm, 5 % exceeding avg 120 bpm) were in excess of those allowable under most current indices On average, workers experienced a peak 10 - minute heart rate of 140 bpm and a peak 30 -minute heart rate of 130 bpm during their shifts. There was a significant increase in fatigue in the first half of the working shift (P= 0. 001), with workers on average showing a significant recovery in the second half of their shift (p= 0. 04). Conclusions: Current heat stress indices provide little common agreement as to acceptable levels of thermal strain or stress for workers, at equivalent levels of environmental stress. IS 07933 is seriously flawed and the ACGIH WBGT guidelines are too conservative for acclimatised workers and are unlikely to become widely adopted by industries with well-acclimatised workers. Many of the existing indices show internal inconsistencies. Most of the physiological heat strain limits used in existing rational heat stress indices (in terms of deep body core temperature and heart rate) are conservative for self-paced, acclimatise d, non-dehydrating male workers. Involuntary dehydration is not unavoidable when acclimatised workers are exposed to thermal stress. Heat stress standards should not limit heat exposure durations for self- paced workers who have access to water on the basis of an unavoidable body water loss. Physical fatigue does occur in workers under heat stress on extended shifts; however, most workers show a significant increase in fatigue in the first half of their shift; whereas data indicates self-paced workers undergo significant recovery in terms of fatigue in the second half of the shift. As the heat exposures in this study cover a wide range of temperatures, humidity levels, wind speeds, body morphology and VO 2 max, these conclusions are applicable to most thermally stressful settings involving well-informed, well-acclimatised and self-paced male workers. The major category of work type not covered by this study is that of workers in fully-encapsulated (vapour-barrier) protective clothing. In addition, this study examined acute effects of heat stress and strain, not effects that might only be manifest with chronic exposure to heat...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} similarities of effects of soil environmental drivers on year-round daily soil fluxes of nitrous oxide and methane for three distinct semi-natural or natural ecosystems: temperate spruce forest, Germany; tropical rain forest, Queensland, Australia; and ungrazed semi-arid steppe, Inner Mongolia, China. Annual cumulative fluxes of nitrous oxide and methane varied markedly among ecosystems, with nitrous oxide fluxes being highest for the tropical forest site (tropical forest: 0. 96 kg N ha − 1 yr − 1; temperate forest: 0. 67 kg N ha − 1 yr − 1; steppe: 0. 22 kg N ha − 1 yr − 1), while rates of soil methane uptake were approximately equal for the temperate forest (− 3. 45 kg C ha − 1 yr − 1) and the steppe (− 3. 39 kg C ha − 1 yr − 1), but lower for the tropical forest site (− 2. 38 kg C ha − 1 yr − 1). In {{order to allow}} for cross-site comparison of effects of changes in soil moisture and soil temperature on fluxes of methane and nitrous oxide, we used a normalization approach. Data analysis with normalized data revealed that, across sites, optimum rates of methane uptake are found at <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions</b> representing approximately <b>average</b> site <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions.</b> This might have rather important implications for understanding {{effects of climate change}} on soil methane uptake potential, since any shift in <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions</b> is likely to result in a reduction of soil methane uptake ability. For nitrous oxide, our analysis revealed expected patterns: highest nitrous oxide emissions under moist and warm conditions and large nitrous oxide fluxes if soils are exposed to freeze–thawing effects at sufficiently high soil moisture contents. However, the explanatory power of relationships of soil moisture or soil temperature to nitrous oxide fluxes remained rather poor (R 2 ≤ 0. 36). When combined effects of changes in soil moisture and soil temperature were considered, the explanatory power of our empirical relationships with regard to temporal variations in nitrous oxide fluxes were at maximum about 50 %. This indicates that other controlling factors such as N and C availability or microbial community dynamics might exert a significant control on the temporal dynamic of nitrous oxide fluxes. Though underlying microbial processes such as nitrification and denitrification are sensitive to changes in the environmental regulating factors, important regulating factors like moisture and temperature seem to have both synergistic and antagonistic effects on the status of other regulating factors. Thus we cannot expect a simple relationship between them and the pattern in the rate of emissions, associated with denitrification or nitrification in the soils. In conclusion, we hypothesize that our approach of data generalization may prove beneficial for the development of environmental response models, which can be used across sites, and which are needed to help achieve a better understanding of climate change feedbacks on biospheric sinks or sources of nitrous oxide and methane...|$|R
