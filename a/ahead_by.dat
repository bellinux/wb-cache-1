5|$|The {{legality}} of about 600 absentee ballots were contested during the count, including Senator Gillibrand's ballot. By April 23, Murphy was <b>ahead</b> <b>by</b> 401 votes, and Tedisco conceded the following day. Murphy {{was sworn in}} on April 29.

5|$|The {{weather was}} fine as Australia started their second innings just after noon {{on the third}} day.

He made nine before his partner Ray Lindwall was stumped, which prompted Bradman to declare at 7/460. This left England a victory target of 596, which would require a world record run chase.|$|E
5|$|With 100 {{percent of}} precincts reporting, initial counts from the {{election}} had Murphy leading by about 60 votes out of over 150,000 cast. Columbia County's Board of Elections amended its tally the following day, reducing Murphy's lead to 25 votes. The lead alternated {{between the two}} candidates throughout early recanvassing; {{at one point the}} New York State Board of Elections had listed the election at a zero-vote margin, with each candidate having exactly 77,225 votes. By April 2, Tedisco was <b>ahead</b> <b>by</b> 12 votes. He resigned the position of Assembly Minority Leader on April 5 in preparation for a transition to Congress, and was replaced by Brian Kolb the following day. On April 7, Tedisco was <b>ahead</b> <b>by</b> 97 votes. The close tally meant that absentee ballots would decide the race.|$|E

5|$|Although Warner {{announced}} {{before the}} 1922 season {{that he was}} leaving to take the head-coaching position at Stanford, he honored his contract and remained at Pitt through 1923. The 1922 team had an 8–2 record, and the season ended with the Panthers taking their first cross-country train trip to defeat Stanford 16–7 in Palo Alto (coached by two Pitt assistants, sent <b>ahead</b> <b>by</b> Warner). Andrew Kerr became head coach at Stanford during Warner's last two years at Pitt. Warner's final season was his worst at Pitt, as the Panthers stumbled to a 5–4 record in 1923. However, the Warner era ended on a high note with a 20–3 victory over Penn State on November 29.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Willie and Martin {{companies}} were {{running out of}} food and encountering bitterly cold temperatures. On October 19 a blizzard struck the region, halting the two companies and the relief party. The Willie Company was along the Sweetwater River approaching the Continental Divide. A scouting party sent <b>ahead</b> <b>by</b> the main rescue party found and greeted the emigrants, gave them {{a small amount of}} flour, encouraged them that rescue was near, and then rushed onward to try to locate the Martin Company. The members of the Willie Company had just reached the end of their flour supplies. They began slaughtering the handful of broken-down cattle that still remained while their death toll mounted. On October 20 Captain Willie and Joseph Elder went <b>ahead</b> <b>by</b> mule through the snow to locate the supply train and inform them of the company's desperate situation. They arrived at the rescue party's campsite near South Pass that evening, and by the next evening the rescue party reached the Willie Company and provided them with food and assistance. Half of the rescue party remained to assist the Willie Company while the other half pressed forward to assist the Martin Company. The difficulties of the Willie Company were not yet over. On October 23, the second day after the main rescue party had arrived, the Willie Company faced the most difficult section of the trail—the ascent up Rocky Ridge. The climb took place during a howling snowstorm through knee-deep snow. That night 13 emigrants died.|$|E

5|$|St. Anger was {{released}} on June 5, 2003.

A special edition of the album {{was released}} with a bonus DVD, featuring live, in-the-studio rehearsals of all of the St. Anger tracks. First week sales of the album were 417,000 copies, and it debuted at number 1 on the U.S. Billboard 200, as well as in 30 other countries around the world. In 2004, Metallica won the award for Best Metal Performance, for the title track.|$|E

5|$|After time expires, the chaser {{is given}} {{two minutes to}} catch the team by {{correctly}} answering {{a new series of}} questions, with each correct answer moving him one space along the board. If the chaser answers incorrectly or passes, the clock is stopped briefly and the team is given a chance to answer the question, which they may confirm among themselves before answering. A correct answer pushes the chaser back one space, or moves the team <b>ahead</b> <b>by</b> one if he has not moved on to the gameboard. An incorrect answer provides no movement for the chaser at all. Regardless of the outcome, the clock begins running again and the chaser continues to answer questions. If the chaser runs out of time before catching the team, the team splits the banked money equally, but if he catches them before time expires, the team leaves with no money. During celebrity episodes, if the chaser catches the team before time runs out, the team leaves with $15,000 divided equally.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland rebounded {{from its}} first {{loss of the}} season with a 31–28 victory over the Rockets. The game started slow; Groza's 21-yard field goal was the only score in the first quarter. The Rockets then went <b>ahead</b> <b>by</b> scoring a {{touchdown}} on a long pass from quarterback Vacanti to end Elroy Hirsch. Cleveland, however, piled on the points as Motley ran for a touchdown in the second quarter and Speedie caught a pass from Graham in the third. Jones added two touchdown runs in the fourth quarter, giving Cleveland a 31–14 lead. Chicago almost caught {{up at the end of}} the game, scoring two touchdowns, but the Browns held on to win. Cleveland's third-string players were on the field in the closing minutes when Chicago made its final push. Rockets rookie Ray Ramsey had three touchdowns in the game. Graham had 239 passing yards on 10 completions. Speedie caught half of them, gaining 166 yards. His touchdown came after he dropped to the ground to grab a 17-yard pass from Graham. He faked a backward lateral while on the ground, which drew Chicago's defense away from him, and then got up and ran into the end zone.|$|E

5|$|Before the 2003–04 season began, the Spurs {{lost their}} {{perennial}} captain David Robinson to retirement. Embracing the lone team leader role, Duncan led a reformed Spurs team which included Slovenian center Rasho Nesterovič, defensive stalwart Bruce Bowen, Argentinian shooting guard Ginóbili and young French point guard Parker. Coming {{off the bench}} were clutch shooting power forward Robert Horry, versatile Hedo Türkoğlu and veterans Malik Rose and Kevin Willis. In retrospect, Robinson commented that at first, Duncan was reluctant {{to step into the}} void, still needing some time to truly develop his leadership skills. Statistically though, Duncan remained strong; after another convincing season with averages of 22.3 points, 12.4 rebounds, 3.1 assists and 2.7 blocks, he led the Spurs into the Western Conference Semifinals. There, they met the Los Angeles Lakers again, split the series 2–2, and in Game 5, Duncan made a toughly defended jump shot which put the Spurs <b>ahead</b> <b>by</b> one point with 0.4 seconds left to play. Despite the little time remaining, Lakers point guard Derek Fisher hit a buzzer beater for an upset Lakers win. In the end, the Spurs lost the series 4–2, and Duncan attributed the strong Lakers defense as {{one of the reasons for}} the loss.|$|E
5|$|Carlos Sainz {{was cleared}} to race albeit not setting {{a time in}} qualifying, being allowed to start {{from the back of}} the grid. At the start, Nico Rosberg led away from Lewis Hamilton, while further back, Nico Hülkenberg spun into turn two, tagging Max Verstappen and Marcus Ericsson. Verstappen had a {{puncture}} while Hülkenberg and Ericsson retired on the spot, causing the safety car to be deployed. Meanwhile, Räikkönen and Kvyat experienced good starts, gaining two and four places respectively. Racing resumed on the end of lap 3, with Rosberg retaining his race lead. However, further back Bottas overtook Räikkönen to take third. By lap 7, Sainz had moved up into 14th place, while Felipe Massa was up into ninth place from 15th on the grid. Race leader Nico Rosberg needed to retire at the end of the seventh lap due to a locked throttle, handing the race lead to championship leader Lewis Hamilton. On lap 10, Pastor Maldonado moved ahead of Jenson Button to take tenth, while Hamilton was extending his lead over second placed Bottas. A second safety car phase occurred on lap 12, when Romain Grosjean lost the back of his Lotus in turn 3 and crashed into the barriers. While Grosjean escaped uninjured, his car was heavily damaged. With a lot of debris on track, the safety car stayed out until lap 17. At the restart, Vettel attacked teammate Räikkönen for third. While the Finn was able to stay <b>ahead</b> <b>by</b> going wide into turn 2, he subsequently gave up the place to Vettel. One lap later, Ricciardo and Sainz fought for tenth place, with Daniel Ricciardo coming out on top and retaining the position.|$|E
5|$|Chamberlain {{made the}} First Team of the All-America squad and led his Jayhawks into the NCAA finals against the Tar Heels of North Carolina. In that game, Tar Heels coach Frank McGuire used several unorthodox tactics to thwart Chamberlain. For the tip-off, {{he sent his}} {{shortest}} player, Tommy Kearns, in order to rattle Chamberlain, and the Tar Heels {{spent the rest of}} the night triple-teaming him, one defender in front, one behind, and a third arriving as soon as he got the ball. With their fixation on Chamberlain, the Jayhawks shot only 27% from the field, as opposed to 64% of the Tar Heels, and trailed 22–29 at halftime. Later, North Carolina led 40–37 with 10 minutes to go and stalled the game: they passed the ball around without any intention of scoring a basket. After several Tar Heel turnovers, the game was tied at 46 at the end of regulation. In the first overtime each team scored two points, and in the second overtime Kansas froze the ball in return, keeping the game tied at 48. In the third overtime, the Tar Heels scored two consecutive baskets, but Chamberlain executed a three-point play, leaving KU trailing 52–51. After King scored a basket, Kansas was <b>ahead</b> <b>by</b> one point, but then Tar Heel Joe Quigg was fouled on a drive with 10 seconds remaining and made his two foul shots. For the final play, Dick Harp called for Ron Loneski to pass the ball into Chamberlain in the low post. The pass was intercepted, however, and the Tar Heels won the game. Nonetheless, Chamberlain, who scored 23 points and 14 rebounds, was elected the Most Outstanding Player of the Final Four. Cherry has speculated, however, that this loss was a watershed in Chamberlain's life, because it was the first time that his team lost despite him putting up impressive individual stats. Chamberlain later admitted that this loss was the most painful of his life.|$|E

5|$|On July 26, 2008, at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, Cotto {{suffered}} {{his first}} loss {{as a professional}} to Antonio Margarito in an unsuccessful title defense. Cotto had taken the early initiative, frequently landing a series of punches on Margarito during the early rounds while using his footwork to avoid danger. However, Margarito presented constant offensive pressure of Cotto and eventually began to wear down Cotto's resistance by trapping him against the ropes. Cotto was hurt in the seventh round after a pair of Margarito uppercuts caused his nose to bleed. Margarito continued to chase his opponent down and inflicted further damage {{towards the end of}} the tenth round. Margarito then threw a series of punches at the start of the eleventh round, with Cotto against the ropes and bleeding profusely. A combination from Margarito finally forced Cotto to his knee. He got up, but Margarito continued landing combinations. Evangelista Cotto threw in the towel after Cotto again fell to the canvas in the corner of the ring. Two judges had Margarito <b>ahead</b> <b>by</b> a score of 96–94 at the time of the stoppage, while the third scored the fight even. HBO analyst Harold Lederman had also scored the fight even. Cotto's loss to Margarito has since come under suspicion due to Margarito's subsequent attempted use of illegal hand-wraps in a fight against Shane Mosley.|$|E
5|$|The Browns {{beat the}} Yankees in the {{eleventh}} {{game of the}} season. It {{was the first of}} three road games the Browns were scheduled to play in a span of eight days. The Browns opened the scoring early in the first quarter with a screen pass from Graham to Motley, who ran 78 yards for a touchdown. An interception by Parseghian on the Yankees' next possession set up another Browns touchdown, a one-yard run by Edgar Jones. The Yankees responded with two touchdowns of their own in the second quarter. The first was a long pass from Pete Layden to Bruce Alford early in the period. On Cleveland's next possession, Graham threw a pass to John Yonakor, but as Yonakor was waiting for the ball to arrive, New York's Otto Schnellbacher jumped {{in front of him and}} made an interception. Schnellbacher had a clear shot at Cleveland's end zone and ran it in for a touchdown that tied the game at 14 points. An interception by Yonakor later in the quarter set up a Groza field goal, and the Browns pulled away as halfback Bob Cowan ran for a touchdown and Groza added another field goal before halftime. Another touchdown by Motley in the third quarter put the Browns <b>ahead</b> <b>by</b> 20 points. The Yankees scored a final touchdown in the fourth quarter to cap a 45-yard drive, but the Browns won the game 34–21. Lavelli was hit in the eye early in the game and had to sit out. Tackle Chubby Grigg and Edgar Jones were also hurt in the game, adding to Cleveland's long list of injured players.|$|E
5|$|The Browns {{suffered}} {{their first}} {{defeat of the}} season {{at the hands of}} the San Francisco 49ers before a crowd of 70,385 in Cleveland. The 49ers led throughout the game, helped by three touchdown passes from left-handed quarterback Frankie Albert. Albert's main target was Alyn Beals, a former Santa Clara University star who caught two of his passes for touchdowns. Kicker Joe Vetrano added to the 49ers lead with a pair of field goals in the first half. Don Greenwood ran for a Browns touchdown in the second quarter, but the extra point was botched. The snap was high and went into kicker Lou Groza's arms. He tried to run with the ball but suffered a back injury when he was tackled short of the end zone. Cliff Lewis was also injured in the second quarter, twisting his knee badly. He was taken to a hospital. The Browns ran only 24 offensive plays in the first half, and the 49ers were <b>ahead</b> <b>by</b> 14 points by halftime. Despite losing 34–21, the Browns matched the 49ers statistically, with 338 total yards to San Francisco's 357. Marion Motley, who had been the AAFC's leading rusher before the game, was held to 22 yards.|$|E
