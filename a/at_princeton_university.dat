5|$|<b>At</b> <b>Princeton</b> <b>University,</b> the Tigers {{defeated}} the visiting UMass Minutemen, 10–7. Princeton {{was led by}} Mark Kovler's six-point effort. The game was the final in the collegiate career of Minutemen goalkeeper Doc Schneider who led his team to the 2006 championship game as a freshman. His opposite number, Princeton's Tyler Fiorito, became just the second freshman goalkeeper to start an NCAA tournament game for the Tigers.|$|E
5|$|During {{a sabbatical}} year <b>at</b> <b>Princeton</b> <b>University</b> in 1960, Christy began an {{investigation}} of Cepheid variables and the smaller RR Lyrae variables, classes of luminous variable stars. At {{the time it was}} a mystery as to why they varied. He used the knowledge of the hydrodynamics of implosion gained at Los Alamos during the war to explain this phenomenon. This earned him the Royal Astronomical Society's Eddington Medal for contributions to theoretical astrophysics in 1967.|$|E

He won eight Ivy League Championships with the men's golf team and three with the women's ice hockey team.|$|E
5|$|In 1960 Nhất Hạnh {{went to the}} US {{to teach}} {{comparative}} religion <b>at</b> <b>Princeton</b> <b>University,</b> and was subsequently appointed lecturer in Buddhism at Columbia University.

5|$|After {{graduating from}} Cornell, O'Neill {{accepted}} {{a position as}} an instructor <b>at</b> <b>Princeton</b> <b>University.</b> There he started his research into high-energy particle physics. In 1956, his second year of teaching, he published a two-page article that theorized that the particles produced by a particle accelerator could be stored {{for a few seconds}} in a storage ring. The stored particles could then be directed to collide with another particle beam. This would increase the energy of the particle collision over the previous method, which directed the beam at a fixed target. His ideas were not immediately accepted by the physics community.|$|E

In 2008, Adelman is Senior Research Fellow at the Key Centre for Ethics, Law, Justice and Governance at Griffith University in Brisbane, Australia. He serves as the deputy convener of GovNet, a consortium of researchers on governance issues in Australia, and as research director of the International Consortium of Research on Governance of the Health Workforce.

5|$|Although NASA was {{supporting}} {{his work with}} grants of up to $500,000 per year, O'Neill became frustrated by the bureaucracy and politics inherent in government-funded research. He thought that small privately funded groups could develop space technology faster than government agencies. In 1977, O'Neill and his wife Tasha founded the Space Studies Institute, a non-profit organization, <b>at</b> <b>Princeton</b> <b>University.</b> SSI received initial funding of almost $100,000 from private donors, and in early 1978 began to support basic research into technologies needed for space manufacturing and settlement.|$|E
5|$|<b>At</b> <b>Princeton</b> <b>University,</b> Henry Norris Russell was {{following}} a similar course of research. He was studying {{the relationship between}} the spectral classification of stars and their actual brightness as corrected for distance—their absolute magnitude. For this purpose he used a set of stars that had reliable parallaxes and many of which had been categorized at Harvard. When he plotted the spectral types of these stars against their absolute magnitude, he found that dwarf stars followed a distinct relationship. This allowed the real brightness of a dwarf star to be predicted with reasonable accuracy.|$|E
