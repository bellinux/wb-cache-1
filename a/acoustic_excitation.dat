Results show that <b>acoustic</b> <b>excitation</b> could improve the asymmetric behaviors as long as controlling conditions are chosen appropriately. The development of asymmetric vortices on the leeward along the model axis would be greatly affected by <b>acoustic</b> <b>excitation.</b> Moreover, the fluctuation energy in the boundary layer could be reduced...|$|E

The present work consists of reviewing and analyzing available published and unpublished experimental data {{in order to determine the}} importance and magnitude of the several variables that contribute to plume modification by <b>acoustic</b> <b>excitation.</b> Included in the study were consideration of the effects of internal or external <b>acoustic</b> <b>excitation,</b> excitation Strouhal number, <b>acoustic</b> <b>excitation</b> level, nozzle size and flow conditions.

40|$|Attenuation of {{self-excited}} roll oscillations of low-aspect-ratio wings using <b>acoustic</b> <b>excitation</b> was {{studied in}} a wind tunnel. For a rectangular flat-plate wing with an aspect ratio of 2, roll oscillations can be completely suppressed, and {{the onset of}} the roll oscillations can be delayed with external <b>acoustic</b> <b>excitation.</b> Similar results were also obtained for wings with two different airfoil profiles. Velocity measurements indicated that <b>acoustic</b> <b>excitation</b> could restore a symmetric vortex flow over the free-to-roll wings, thus eliminating the self-excited roll oscillations. The effect of excitation is most noticeable for the side of the wing that sees a larger effective angle of attack due to the rolling motion. <b>Acoustic</b> <b>excitation</b> energizes the shear-layer instabilities and results in reattachment or smaller separated flow region closer to wing surface, thus in turn suppressing the roll oscillations...|$|E

40|$|With the {{accuracy}} of metrology frame applications entering the nanometer-range, the necessity arises to tackle all types of disturbances. In the process of estimating {{the relative importance of}} the different types of disturbances on the machine accuracy, also called dynamic error budgeting, <b>acoustic</b> <b>excitation</b> has gained more importance, mainly because of the tightening of the performance requirements as well as the relatively high noise levels of air-conditioning systems in clean room. To estimate the dynamic error budget claimed by <b>acoustic</b> <b>excitation</b> already in the design phase of the machine, there is a clear need to predict this type of excitation in the design stage.

40|$|The {{accurate}} {{prediction of}} the response of aircraft panels subjected to strong <b>acoustic</b> <b>excitation</b> and high temperatures has been and remains an important requirement {{for the design of}} supersonic/hypersonic vehicles. One of the key challenges to achieving this prediction is the computationally efficient modeling of the complex physical processes taking place when the <b>acoustic</b> <b>excitation</b> is strong enough to induce a large, nonlinear geometric response of the panel. Even for a flat beam or plate, there exists a subtle energy exchange between the large transverse displacements resulting directly from the <b>acoustic</b> <b>excitation</b> and the much smaller in-plane motions nonlinearly induced by the change of geometry. The transverse displacements exhibit a stiffening behavior which is softened by the in-plane motions. Curved and buckled panels exhibit an even more complex behavior as they can “snap ” through an unstable region leading to deformations that are drastically nonlinear, i. e. of the order of 10 - 100 thicknesses. The interplay of the curvature, <b>acoustic</b> <b>excitation,</b> and temperature leads to an occurrence of snap-through events varying from very rare, to frequent, to continuous. The present study demonstrates that reduced-order model can capture the complex snap-through behavior of shallow curved beams. Successfu...|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to analyze the effect of acoustic disturbances on a premixed flame and determine their role in the onset of combustion instabilities. Computations for the one-dimensional, unsteady combustion of a lean premixed methane-air mixture are performed. An <b>acoustic</b> <b>excitation</b> is introduced in the chamber and interacts with the flame front. Our results indicate that as the amplitude of the <b>acoustic</b> <b>excitation</b> is increased, the flame front position fluctuates rapidly. This phenomenon is even more intense when the frequency of the acoustic disturbance matches the fundamental frequency of the chamber. Our results suggest that the interactions between the flame and the <b>acoustic</b> <b>excitation</b> may result in flame extinguishment.

40|$|In this study, methane–ethylene jet {{diffusion}} flames modulated by <b>acoustic</b> <b>excitation</b> in an atmospheric environment {{were used to}} investigate the effects of <b>acoustic</b> <b>excitation</b> frequency and mixed fuel on nanomaterial formation. Acoustic output power was maintained at a constant value of 10 W, while the <b>acoustic</b> <b>excitation</b> frequency was varied (f = 0 – 90 Hz). The {{results show that the}} flame could not be stabilized on the port when the ethylene volume concentration (ΩE) was less than 40 % at f = 10 Hz, or when ΩE = 0 % (i. e., pure methane) at f = 90 Hz. The {{reason for this is that}} the flame had a low intensity and was extinguished by the entrained air due to acoustic modulation. Without <b>acoustic</b> <b>excitation</b> (f = 0 Hz), the flame was comprised of a single-layer structure for all values of ΩE, and almost no carbon nanomaterials were synthesized. However, with <b>acoustic</b> <b>excitation,</b> a double-layer flame structure was generated for frequencies close to both the natural flickering frequency and the acoustically resonant frequency. This double-layer flame structure provided a favorable flame environment for the fabrication of carbon nanomaterials. Consequently, the synthesis of carbon nano-onions was significantly enhanced by <b>acoustic</b> <b>excitation</b> near both the natural flickering frequency and the acoustically resonant frequency. At f = 20 Hz (near the natural flickering frequency) for 0 % ≤ ΩE ≤ 100 %, a quantity of carbon nano-onions (CNOs) piled like bunches of grapes was obtained as a result of improved mixing of the fuel with ambient air. High-density CNOs were also produced at f = 70 Hz (close to the acoustically resonant frequency) for 40 % ≤ ΩE ≤ 100 %. Furthermore, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were synthesized only at 80 Hz for ΩE = 0 %. The suitable temperature range for the synthesis of CNTs was slightly higher than that for the formation of CNOs (about 600 °C for CNTs; 510 – 600 °C for CNOs) ...|$|E
40|$|Acoustic {{landmine}} detection (ALD) is {{a technique}} {{for the detection of}} buried landmines including non-metal mines. An important issue in ALD is the <b>acoustic</b> <b>excitation</b> of the soil. Laser excitation is promising for complete standoff detection using lasers for excitation and monitoring. <b>Acoustic</b> <b>excitation</b> is a more common technique that gives good results but requires an acoustic source close to the measured area. In a field test in 2002 both techniques were compared side by side. A number of buried landmines were measured using both types of excitation. Various types of landmines were used, both anti-tank and anti-personnel, which were buried at various depths in different soil types with varying humidity. Two Laser Doppler Vibrometer (LDV) systems of two different wavelengths for the different approaches were used, one based on a He-Ne laser at 0. 633 μm with <b>acoustic</b> <b>excitation</b> and one on an erbium fiber laser at 1. 54 μm in the case of laser excitation. The <b>acoustic</b> <b>excitation</b> gives a good contrast between the buried mine and the surrounding soil at certain frequencies.

40|$|Abstract—Shear-layer instabilities of a pulsed stack-issued {{transverse}} jet {{were studied}} experimentally in a wind tunnel.

Instantaneous velocities of the shear-layer instabilities in the flow were digitized by a hot-wire anemometer. By analyzing the streak pictures of the smoke-flow visualization, three characteristic flow modes, synchronized flapping jet, transition, and synchronized shear-layer vortices, are identified in the shear layer of the pulsed stack-issued transverse jet at various excitation Strouhal numbers.

The combined probabilistic and convex modeling of <b>acoustic</b> <b>excitation</b> appears to be most suitable, since there is an insufficient information available on the <b>acoustic</b> <b>excitation</b> parameters, to justify the totally probabilitic analysis.

40|$|The {{scope of}} this effort is to {{determine}} the viability of a new heating technique using a noncontact <b>acoustic</b> <b>excitation</b> source. Because of low coupling between air and the structure, a synchronous detection method is employed. Any reduction in the out of plane stiffness improves the acoustic coupling efficiency and as a result, defective areas have an increase in temperature relative to the surrounding area. Hence a new measurement system, based on air-coupled acoustic energy and synchronous detection is presented. An analytical model of a clamped circular plate is given, experimentally tested, and verified. Repeatability confirms the technique with a measurement uncertainty of plus or minus 6. 2 percent.

40|$|The {{low-temperature}} {{thermal properties}} of dielectric crystals {{are governed by}} <b>acoustic</b> <b>excitations</b> with large wavelengths that are well described by plane waves. This is the Debye model, which rests {{on the assumption that}} the medium is an elastic continuum, holds true for acoustic wavelengths large on the microscopic scale fixed by the interatomic spacing, and gradually breaks down on approaching it. Glasses are characterized as well by universal low-temperature thermal properties that are, however, anomalous with respect to those of the corresponding crystalline phases. Related universal anomalies also appear in the low-frequency vibrational density of states and, despite a longstanding debate, remain poorly understood. By using molecular dynamics simulations of a model monatomic glass of extremely large size, we show that in glasses the structural disorder undermines the Debye model in a subtle way: The elastic continuum approximation for the <b>acoustic</b> <b>excitations</b> breaks down abruptly on the mesoscopic, medium-range-order length scale of ≈ 10 interatomic spacings, where it still works well for the corresponding crystalline systems. On this scale, the sound velocity shows a marked reduction with respect to the macroscopic value.

Examples are ultra-precise measuring equipment with nanometer accuracy, stages for lithography applications and stages for electron microscopes. The accuracy of mechatronic systems is rapidly increasing. Key {{in the development of}} such highly precise machinery is to control the disturbances affecting the accuracy of the machine. A systematic way to do so, is to define a “dynamic error budget ” which is divided amongst the different disturbances. Many different disturbances need to be considered. To mention a few: floor vibrations, vibrations generated internally by the machine, <b>acoustic</b> <b>excitation</b> due to flow and/or clean-room air-conditioning systems, etc. The latter disturbance, <b>acoustic</b> <b>excitation,</b> claims a significant part to the error budget, especially for extremely accurate precision machinery.
