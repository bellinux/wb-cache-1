25|$|Two local landowners {{claimed the}} mineral {{rights of the}} area where the mine was situated. Fortunately, they came to an <b>amicable</b> <b>agreement</b> in December 1826 which gave them joint {{ownership}} of a defined area around the mine and equal shares of the royalties from the produce of the mine. They then granted a fourteen-year lease to the new company on 31 May 1827 in return for 1/9th {{of the value of the}} smelted lead, and the following day, 1 June 1827, a partnership agreement was signed by ten shareholders in the company.|$|E
30|$|<b>Amicable</b> <b>agreements</b> (redemptions) are {{somewhat}} different to so-called ’cured’ {{cases that have}} recently been discussed in the default prediction literature (e.g., Tong et al. 2012; Wolter and Rösch 2014). While ’cured’ cases always show a 100  % recovery (see Wolter and Rösch 2014 for a brief introduction to ’cured’ events), <b>amicable</b> <b>agreements</b> do not necessarily lead to a full recovery (the average recovery rate for <b>amicable</b> <b>agreements</b> in our sample is 82  %; see Table 1).|$|R

500|$|Meat Loaf {{has stated}} that he contributed lyrics to [...] "Bat Out of Hell". He had used the phrase {{extensively}} for tours, to which Steinman had never objected [...] "until a recent falling out." [...] Steinman and his representatives approached Meat Loaf's labels, Universal and Virgin, asserting trademark ownership and threatening litigation to prevent the album's release. An agreement was reached in Summer 2006. According to Virgin, [...] "the two came to an <b>amicable</b> <b>agreement</b> that ensured that Jim Steinman's music would be a continuing part of the 'Bat Out of Hell' legacy." [...] In promotional interviews, Meat Loaf has played down the dispute with Steinman, pointing {{out that it was}} over in three weeks and was purely for the sake of business.|$|E
500|$|The {{prospect}} of {{marriage to the}} Countess of Essex on the horizon, Leicester finally drew a line under his relationship with Douglas Sheffield. Contrary to what she later claimed, they came to an <b>amicable</b> <b>agreement</b> over their son's custody. Young Robert grew up in Dudley's and his friends' houses, but had [...] "leave to see" [...] his mother until she left England in 1583. Leicester was very fond of his son and gave him an excellent education. In his will he left him {{the bulk of his}} estate (after his brother Ambrose's death), including Kenilworth Castle. Douglas Sheffield remarried in 1579. After the death of ElizabethI in 1603, the younger Robert Dudley tried unsuccessfully to prove that his parents had married 30 years earlier in a secret ceremony. In that case he {{would have been able to}} claim the earldoms of Leicester and Warwick. His mother supported him, but maintained that she had been strongly against raising the issue and was possibly pressured by her son. Leicester himself had throughout considered the boy as illegitimate.|$|E
500|$|The party {{leadership}} {{was faced with}} a choice between repressions on a massive scale and an <b>amicable</b> <b>agreement</b> that would give the workers what they wanted, and thus quieten the aroused population. They chose the latter. On 31 August Wałęsa signed the Gdańsk Agreement with Mieczysław Jagielski, a member of the party Politburo. The Agreement acknowledged the right of employees to associate in free trade unions, obliged the government to take steps to eliminate censorship, abolished weekend work, increased the minimum wage, improved and extended welfare and pensions, and increased autonomy of industrial enterprises, where a meaningful role was to be played by workers' self-management councils. The rule of the party was significantly weakened (to a [...] "leading role in the state", not society) but nonetheless explicitly recognized, together with Poland's international alliances. It was seen as necessary to prevent Soviet intervention by more moderate forces, including leading intelligentsia advisers and the Catholic hierarchy. The fact that all these economic concessions were completely unaffordable escaped attention in the wave of national euphoria that swept the country. In addition to the Gdańsk Agreement, similar documents were signed at other centers of strike activity, in Szczecin (Szczecin Agreement), Jastrzębie-Zdrój, and at Katowice Steelworks. The period that started afterwards is often called {{the first part of the}} [...] "Polish carnival" [...] – with the second one taking place in the late 1980s.|$|E
30|$|Based on {{a unique}} data set of 909 {{defaulted}} retail and commercial (self-employed and SMEs) credit customers in Germany, whose original loans {{were made by}} 123 different banks, our article confirms a significant positive influence of collateral, and of <b>amicable</b> <b>agreements</b> between the debtor and the bank (redemption), on the recovery rate [1 − loss given default (LGD)]. In a further analysis of collateral, systematic biases between the realized market price and the expected market values of real estate are revealed, even though the appraisal reports should have already considered all factors influencing the value. Using valuations that were adjusted for these recognized biases, we can increase the explanatory power of the underlying models. Moreover, we compare these models to models that apply, as is common practice in the banking industry, flat haircuts to collateral values and show the superior performance of our proposed approach.|$|R

In June 2014, a Superior Court ruling called for Berry to pay Aubry $16,000 {{a month in}} child support (around 200k/year) {{as well as a}} retroactive payment of $115,000 and a sum of $300,000 for Aubry's attorney fees. Berry and Martinez confirmed their engagement in March 2012, and married in France on July 13, 2013. In October 2013, Berry gave birth to their son. After two years of marriage, in 2015 the couple announced they were divorcing. The divorce became final in December 2016.|$|R
5000|$|Whenever the {{riparian}} {{states are}} not able to reach <b>amicable</b> <b>agreements</b> on their own in sharing of an interstate river waters, section 4 of IRWD Act provides dispute resolution process in the form of Tribunal. [...] As per section 5.2 of the Act, the tribunal shall not only adjudicate but also investigate the matters referred to it by the central government and forward a report setting out the facts with its decisions. It implies that the tribunal responsibility is not limited to adjudication of issues raised by the concerned states and also investigation of other aspects which are in public domain such as water pollution, salt export requirement, water quality deterioration, flood control, sustainability of river basin productivity & its ecology, environmental flow requirements, climate change effects, etc. When the tribunal final verdict issued based on the deliberations on the draft verdict is accepted by the central government and notified in the official gazette, the verdict becomes law and binding on the states for implementation. When pronounced in the ambit of IRWD Act, the tribunal’s verdict after its publication in the official gazette is equivalent to Supreme Court verdict as per section 6 of IRWD Act. In case the constitutional rights of states are ingressed upon by the tribunal award in any manner, central government, for extending purview of its enactment to implement the tribunal order, is obliged to take the consent of all riparian states under Article 252 of the constitution before publishing the tribunal awards in the official gazette.|$|R
2500|$|Originally, Fairey {{had claimed}} his HOPE poster {{was based on}} a 2006 copyrighted photo of then-Senator Barack Obama seated next to actor George Clooney, taken in April 2006 by Mannie Garcia on {{assignment}} for the Associated Press, which wanted credit and compensation for the work. Garcia believes that he personally owns the copyright for the photo, and has said, [...] "If you put all the legal stuff away, I’m so proud of the photograph and that Fairey did what he did artistically with it, and the effect it's had". Fairey said his use of the photograph fell within the legal definition of fair use. Fairey claims he used pieces of the photo as raw material to create a heroic and inspirational political portrait, the aesthetic of which was fundamentally different from the original photo. Lawyers for both sides tried to reach an <b>amicable</b> <b>agreement.</b>|$|E

60|$|We {{obtain a}} pretty {{distinct}} {{idea of the}} nature of this pastoral life, and of the manners and customs, and the domestic constitution to which it gives rise, in the accounts given us in the Old Testament of Abraham and Lot, and of their wanderings with their flocks and herds over the country lying between the Euphrates and the Mediterranean Sea. They lived in tents, in order that they might remove their habitations the more easily from place to place in following their flocks and herds to different pasture-grounds. Their wealth consisted almost wholly in these flocks and herds, the land being almost every where common. Sometimes, when two parties traveling together came to a fertile and well-watered district, their herdsmen and followers were disposed to contend for the privilege of feeding their flocks upon it, and the contention would often lead to a quarrel and combat, {{if it had not been}} settled by an <b>amicable</b> <b>agreement</b> on the part of the chieftains.|$|E
25|$|Wingate and {{the nine}} other crash victims were {{initially}} {{buried in a}} common grave close to the crash site {{near the village of}} Bishnupur in the present-day state of Manipur in India. The bodies were charred beyond recognition, hence individuals could not be identified under medical practices of the day, as identification from dental records was not possible. Since seven of the ten crash victims, including both pilots, were Americans, all ten bodies were exhumed in 1947 and reburied in Imphal, India and yet again exhumed in 1950 and flown to Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia for reburial. The exhumation was possible courtesy of an <b>amicable</b> three-way <b>agreement</b> among the governments of India, Britain and the United States, and in accordance with the families' wishes.|$|R
5000|$|In July 2011 Moe {{recorded}} his first feature on the Avicii track [...] "Fade into Darkness". The song reached number 4 in the Swedish Singles Chart (Sverigetopplistan) - and achieved further success in Poland & Netherlands. The song was also destined for UK release - {{before it became}} wrapped up in controversy - after Leona Lewis released a similar version of the track's instrumental under the name Collide. Avicii later claimed that Lewis's record label, Syco, had [...] "stolen" [...] his idea without his permission. Lewis and Avicii eventually settled in court, coming to an <b>amicable</b> mutual <b>agreement</b> to release the song as a collaboration between Lewis and Avicii - meaning that Fade into Darkness was dropped as a UK release.|$|R
5000|$|WFIL {{was formed}} by a merger of two {{stations}} that were launched in 1922. One used the call letters WFI, the other was originally WDAR. Each was owned by a major Philadelphia department store; WFI was operated by Strawbridge and Clothier, while WDAR was run by Lit Brothers. While operated independently of each other, the two were able to work out <b>amicable</b> share-time <b>agreements</b> (hundreds of other American stations {{at the time were}} unable to do so, and frequently engaged in [...] "jamming wars"). Around 1924, WDAR applied for and received the custom call-sign WLIT. By the late 1920s, the two stations were working jointly on various programs, promotions, and sponsorship efforts. In 1935, the two operators agreed to merge with each department store having representation on the new board of directors. The new call-sign became WFIL, {{a combination of the two}} previous identifiers (the fact that the new call letters were close to a phonetic spelling of [...] "Philadelphia" [...] was merely a happy coincidence). The new WFIL was an affiliate of NBC; some sources say the station never became established as either a [...] "basic Red" [...] or [...] "basic Blue" [...] outlet, but at least one early WFIL advertisement claimed that it was a [...] "basic Blue" [...] station. Westinghouse's KYW had replaced WFI-WLIT as the NBC primary for Philadelphia when it moved in from Chicago, Illinois a few years before. Starting in December 1944 the station produced Hayloft Hoedown, picked up by ABC Radio in 1945.|$|R
60|$|The {{disposition}} of the two commanders to live on friendly terms with each other at this time was increased by the hope which Richard entertained that he might, by some possibility, come to an <b>amicable</b> <b>agreement</b> with Saladin in respect to Jerusalem, and thus bring the war to an end. He was beginning to be thoroughly discontented with his situation, and with every thing pertaining to the war. Nothing since the first capture of Acre had really gone well. His army had been repulsed {{in its attempt to}} advance into the interior, and was now hemmed in by the enemy on every side, and shut up in a few towns on the sea-coast. The men under his command had been greatly diminished in numbers, and, though sheltered from the enemy, the force that remained was gradually wasting away from the effects of exposure to the climate and from fatigue. There was no prospect of any immediate re-enforcements arriving from Europe, and no hope, without them, of being able to take the field successfully against Saladin.|$|E
60|$|No matter, she is {{interesting}} enough without an <b>amicable</b> <b>agreement.</b> In several ways {{she is the}} most interesting woman that ever lived, and the most extraordinary. The same may be said of her career, and the same may be said of its chief result. She started from nothing. Her enemies charge that she surreptitiously took from Quimby a peculiar system of healing which was mind-cure with a Biblical basis. She and her friends deny that she took anything from him. This is a matter which we can discuss by-and-by. Whether she took it or invented it, it was--materially--a sawdust mine when she got it, and she has {{turned it into a}} Klondike; its spiritual dock had next to no custom, if any at all: from it she has launched a world-religion which has now six hundred and sixty-three churches, and she charters a new one every four days. When we do not know a person--and also when we do--we have to judge his size by the size and nature of his achievements, as compared with the achievements of others in his special line of business--there is no other way. Measured by this standard, it is thirteen hundred years since the world has produced any one who could reach up to Mrs. Eddy's waistbelt.|$|E
60|$|Miss Charity, {{who knew}} he had a secret {{pleasure}} in the contemplation of the proposed change, suppressed her own, and went on to negotiate the terms. His views upon this subject were at first so very limited that another difference, involving possibly another shaking, threatened to ensue; but by degrees they came to something like an understanding, and the storm blew over. Indeed, Miss Charity's idea was so agreeable to both, {{that it would have been}} strange if they had not come to an <b>amicable</b> <b>agreement.</b> It was soon arranged between them that the project should be tried, and that immediately; and that Cherry's not being well, and needing change of scene, and wishing to be near her sister, should form the excuse for her departure to Mr Chuzzlewit and Mary, to both of whom she had pleaded indisposition for some time past. These premises agreed on, Mr Pecksniff gave her his blessing, with all the dignity of a self-denying man who had made a hard sacrifice, but comforted himself with the reflection that virtue is its own reward. Thus they were reconciled for the first time since that not easily forgiven night, when Mr Jonas, repudiating the elder, had confessed his passion for the younger sister, and Mr Pecksniff had abetted him on moral grounds.|$|E
50|$|The school {{celebrated its}} Golden Jubilee in school year 1998-1999 with Sister Ma. Violeta Fulo, OSA as the Schoolhead. The weeklong celebration - February 1-5, 1999 - had for its theme “LCC: A Living Legacy at 50…. Onward to the New Millennium!” The Grand Celebration {{featured}} a dawn procession, a grand Eucharistic celebration with Msgr. Leonardo Z. Legazpi, O.P.D.D. Archbishop of Caceres as celebrant, a {{blessing of the}} partly completed Phase V of the Construction Plan, a testimonial luncheon and awarding of the school’s Golden Achievers, an alumni affair, parents’ day, mass demonstrations, students’ encounter, parade and the coronation of the Golden Jubilee muses and escorts. School year 1999-2000 featured a peaceful Collective Bargaining Agreement between the administrators and the LCC Employees’ Labor Union. Massive outreach activities were conducted to end the school’s Jubilee celebration meaningfully. School year 2000-2001 featured {{the start of the}} school’s Research and Development Office. In January, 2001, the Grade School Department underwent a second PAASCU Re-Survey and it was granted a five-year re-accreditation status (2001-2006). The same school year featured the completion of Phase V of the construction plan and finalization of the whole school’s Physical Plant Long-Range Development Program.School year 2001-2002 had Sister Adelina Segismundo, OSA as the Schoolhead. With the eighteen-year (1983-2001) Physical Plant Development Program having just been completed, the school year featured massive enhancement of the school facilities. Significant acquisitions for the school year included - a high power electric generator, steel benches for the parents’ waiting area, at least thirty (30) computer units and a rich library and laboratory holdings. The Mini Hotel as a practicum area for the Hotel and Restaurant Management (HRM) students and the School Clinic has been especially furnished with modern equipments. This school year also featured a new College Library, a College Student’s Lounge, a separate Testing Room, a new Alumni and Supreme Family Council Office, a Religion Center and several College Classrooms. A concrete fence has likewise been erected {{by the side of the}} school building. Moreover, the school hosted the Regional Assembly of the Augustinian Youth Organization (AYO). The school’s Long-Range Program for the next development cycle 2001-2006 was likewise prepared and the High School Department underwent and passed its second PAASCU Re-Survey in February, 2002. School year 2002-2003 featured more acquisitions such as: a Powerpoint projector, Transformer units and the installation of a 24-unit Intercom. Canteen facilities have likewise been improved and a College Travel Office has been provided. The Alumni Association likewise began its scholarship program in college. Outreach Activities included a Mass Baptism of the indigents and a thorough preparation for the re-opening of the Free High School. Revisions and updating of the college curricula were also made. With Sister Adelina Segismundo, OSA as Schoolhead, school year 2003-2004, marked the school’s fifty-fifth (55th) Foundation Anniversary. The Emerald Celebration was capped with a cultural presentation held at the newly renovated St. Augustine’s Auditorium. The cultural show featured the school’s development over the years and the causes for the beatification of Mother Consueló Barcelo y Pagés. The school year further featured the re-opening of the Free High School. The high school and grade school bagged the championship at the First Regional Assembly and Sports and Cultural Competition among the Bicol ASAS Schools. The college department featured the revision of the College Student’s Handbook and the publication of the maiden issue of the LCC Research Journal. In April, 2004 La Consolacion College hosted the National Annual Assembly of the Lay Augustinian Associates. Furthermore, the school administrators and the officials of the LCC Employees’ Labor Union had an <b>amicable</b> Collective Bargaining <b>Agreement</b> in May, 2004. Major purchases for the year include - a new sound system, new lighting system and air-conditioning units for the Auditorium. Internet access to Infocom was also installed.|$|R
