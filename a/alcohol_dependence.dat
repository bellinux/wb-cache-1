Males had higher rates than females for all measures of drinking in the past month: any alcohol use (57.5% vs. 45%), binge drinking (30.8% vs. 15.1%), and heavy alcohol use (10.5% vs. 3.3%), and males were twice as likely as females to have met the criteria for <b>alcohol</b> <b>dependence</b> or abuse in the past year (10.5% vs. 5.1%).|$|E
5|$|Other {{tests are}} {{sometimes}} {{used for the}} detection of <b>alcohol</b> <b>dependence,</b> such as the <b>Alcohol</b> <b>Dependence</b> Data Questionnaire, which is a more sensitive diagnostic test than the CAGE questionnaire. It helps distinguish a diagnosis of <b>alcohol</b> <b>dependence</b> from one of heavy alcohol use. The Michigan Alcohol Screening Test (MAST) is a screening tool for alcoholism widely used by courts to determine the appropriate sentencing for people convicted of alcohol-related offenses, driving under the influence being the most common. The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), a screening questionnaire developed by the World Health Organization, is unique in that it has been validated in six countries and is used internationally. Like the CAGE questionnaire, it uses a simple set of questions – a high score earning a deeper investigation. The Paddington Alcohol Test (PAT) was designed to screen for alcohol-related problems amongst those attending Accident and Emergency departments. It concords well with the AUDIT questionnaire but is administered in a fifth of the time. Certain blood tests may also indicate possible alcoholism.|$|E

5|$|Genetic {{differences}} exist between different racial groups which affect {{the risk of}} developing <b>alcohol</b> <b>dependence.</b> For example, there are differences between African, East Asian and Indo-racial groups in how they metabolize alcohol. These genetic factors are believed to, in part, explain the differing rates of <b>alcohol</b> <b>dependence</b> among racial groups. The alcohol dehydrogenase allele ADH1 B*3 causes a more rapid metabolism of alcohol. The allele ADH1 B*3 is only found in those of African descent and certain Native American tribes. African Americans and Native Americans with this allele have a reduced risk of developing alcoholism. Native Americans however, have a significantly higher rate of alcoholism than average; it is unclear why this is the case. Other risk factors such as cultural environmental effects e.g. trauma have been proposed to explain the higher rates of alcoholism among Native Americans compared to alcoholism levels in caucasians.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the prevalence of}} <b>alcohol</b> abuse and/or <b>dependence</b> in a population-based sample of young adults and assess the prevalence of comorbid mood disorders, anxiety, and suicide risk in this population. Methods: This cross-sectional, population-based study enrolled 1, 953 young adults aged 18 - 35 years. The CAGE questionnaire was used to screen for <b>alcohol</b> abuse and/or <b>dependence,</b> with CAGE scores ≥ 2 considered positive.

40|$|Background: Risks {{associated}} with parental separation have received limited attention {{in research on}} children of parents with substance use disorders. We examined early substance involvement {{as a function of}} parental separation during childhood and parental <b>alcohol</b> and cannabis <b>dependence.</b> Method: Data were drawn from 1, 318 adolescent offspring of monozygotic (MZ) or dizygotic (DZ) Australian twin parents. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were conducted predicting age at first use of alcohol, first alcohol intoxication, first use and first regular use of cigarettes, and first use of cannabis, from parental separation and both parent and cotwin substance dependence. Parent and cotwin <b>alcohol</b> and cannabis <b>dependence</b> were initially modeled separately, with post-hoc tests for equality of effects. Results: With few exceptions, risks {{associated with}} parental <b>alcohol</b> versus cannabis <b>dependence</b> could be equated, with results largely suggestive of genetic transmission of risk from parental substance (<b>alcohol</b> or cannabis) <b>dependence</b> broadly defined. Controlling for parental substance dependence, parental separation was a strong predictor for all substance use variables, especially through age 13.

The long term use of alcohol for example, has shown altered gene expression in the brain, and cell-type specific changes that may relate to alcohol use disorder.

5|$|As {{with similar}} {{substances}} with a sedative-hypnotic mechanism, such as barbiturates and benzodiazepines, withdrawal from <b>alcohol</b> <b>dependence</b> {{can be fatal}} {{if it is not}} properly managed. Alcohol's primary effect is the increase in stimulation of the GABAA receptor, promoting central nervous system depression. With repeated heavy consumption of alcohol, these receptors are desensitized and reduced in number, resulting in tolerance and physical dependence. When alcohol consumption is stopped too abruptly, the person's nervous system suffers from uncontrolled synapse firing. This can result in symptoms that include anxiety, life-threatening seizures, delirium tremens, hallucinations, shakes and possible heart failure. Other neurotransmitter systems are also involved, especially dopamine, NMDA and glutamate.|$|E

40|$|While the {{consumption}} of alcohol {{has been part of}} the collective psyche of Australians since colonisation, the overconsumption of alcohol has been and continues to be a significant problem for the Australian community.

40|$|<b>Alcohol</b> {{and drug}} <b>dependence</b> are serious public health {{problems}} worldwide. The prevalence of <b>alcohol</b> and drug <b>dependence</b> in the United States {{and other parts}} of the world is significant. Given the limitations in the efficacy of current pharmacotherapies to treat these disorders, research in developing alternative pharmacotherapies continues. Preclinical and clinical evidence thus far has indicated that brain nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are important pharmacological targets for the development of medications to treat <b>alcohol</b> and drug <b>dependence.</b> The nAChRs are a super family of ligand gated ion channels, and are expressed throughout the brain with twelve neuronal nAChR subunits (a 2 –a 10 and b 2 –b 4) identified. Here, we review preclinical and clinical evidence involving a number of nAChR ligands that target different nAChR subtypes in alcohol and nicotine addiction. The important ligands include cytisine, lobeline, mecamylamine, varenicline, sazetidine A and others that target a 4 b 2 * nAChR subtypes as small molecule modulators of the brain nicotinic cholinergic system are also discussed. Taken together, both preclinical and clinical data exist that support nAChR–based ligands as promising therapeutic agents for the treatment of <b>alcohol</b> and drug <b>dependence...</b>|$|R
5|$|Topiramate, a {{derivative}} of the naturally occurring sugar monosaccharide D-fructose, {{has been found}} effective in helping alcoholics quit or {{cut back on the}} amount they drink.

A 2008 review of the effectiveness of topiramate concluded that the results of published trials are promising, however, as of 2008, data was insufficient to support using topiramate in conjunction with brief weekly compliance counseling as a first-line agent for <b>alcohol</b> <b>dependence.</b> A 2010 review found that topiramate may be superior to existing alcohol pharmacotherapeutic options. Topiramate effectively reduces craving and alcohol withdrawal severity as well as improving quality-of-life-ratings.|$|E
5|$|A complex {{mixture of}} genetic and {{environmental}} factors influences {{the risk of the}} development of alcoholism. Genes that influence the metabolism of alcohol also influence the risk of alcoholism, and may be indicated by a family history of alcoholism. One paper has found that alcohol use at an early age may influence the expression of genes which increase the risk of <b>alcohol</b> <b>dependence.</b> Individuals who have a genetic disposition to alcoholism {{are also more likely to}} begin drinking at an earlier age than average. Also, a younger age of onset of drinking is associated with an increased risk of the development of alcoholism, and about 40 percent of alcoholics will drink excessively by their late adolescence. It is not entirely clear whether this association is causal, and some researchers have been known to disagree with this view.|$|E
5|$|Alcohol {{detoxification}} or 'detox' for alcoholics is {{an abrupt}} stop of alcohol drinking {{coupled with the}} substitution of drugs, such as benzodiazepines, that have similar effects to prevent alcohol withdrawal. Individuals who are only at risk of mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms can be detoxified as outpatients. Individuals at risk of a severe withdrawal syndrome {{as well as those}} who have significant or acute comorbid conditions are generally treated as inpatients. Detoxification does not actually treat alcoholism, and it is necessary to follow up detoxification with an appropriate treatment program for <b>alcohol</b> <b>dependence</b> or abuse to reduce the risk of relapse. Some symptoms of alcohol withdrawal such as depressed mood and anxiety typically take weeks or months to abate while other symptoms persist longer due to persisting neuroadaptations. Alcoholism has serious adverse effects on brain function; on average it takes one year of abstinence to recover from the cognitive deficits incurred by chronic alcohol abuse.|$|E

The simple theory was developed to calculate an increase in reorganization energies induced by the hydrogen bonding interactions between DQ and alcohols using the chemical equilibrium constants for the hydrogen bonding complexes through the concerted pathway and the stepwise one. The experimental results were analyzed by using the Marcus equation where we took into account the hydrogen bonding effects on the reorganization energy and the reaction free energy for the CS reaction. The observed <b>alcohol</b> concentration <b>dependence</b> of the CS reaction rates was well explained by the formation of the hydrogen bonding complexes through the concerted pathway, demonstrating the increase in the reorganization energy by the hydrogen bonding interactions...|$|R
5|$|Benzodiazepines possess sedative, hypnotic, anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant, and amnesic actions, {{which are}} useful {{in a variety of}} {{indications}} such as <b>alcohol</b> <b>dependence,</b> seizures, anxiety disorders, panic, agitation, and insomnia. Most are administered orally; however, they can also be given intravenously, intramuscularly, or rectally. In general, benzodiazepines are well-tolerated and are safe and effective drugs in the short term {{for a wide range of}} conditions. Tolerance can develop to their effects and there is also a risk of dependence, and upon discontinuation a withdrawal syndrome may occur. These factors, combined with other possible secondary effects after prolonged use such as psychomotor, cognitive, or memory impairments, limit their long-term applicability. The effects of long-term use or misuse include the tendency to cause or worsen cognitive deficits, depression, and anxiety. The College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia recommends discontinuing the usage of benzodiazepines in those on opioids and those who have used them long term.|$|E
5|$|The World Health Organization, the European Union {{and other}} {{regional}} bodies, national governments and parliaments have formed alcohol policies {{in order to}} reduce the harm of alcoholism.

5|$|Women develop {{long-term}} {{complications of}} <b>alcohol</b> <b>dependence</b> {{more rapidly than}} do men. Additionally, women have a higher mortality rate from alcoholism than men.

Additionally, heavy drinking over time has been found to {{have a negative effect on}} reproductive functioning in women. This results in reproductive dysfunction such as anovulation, decreased ovarian mass, problems or irregularity of the menstrual cycle, and early menopause. Alcoholic ketoacidosis can occur in individuals who chronically abuse alcohol and have a recent history of binge drinking. The amount of alcohol that can be biologically processed and its effects differ between sexes. Equal dosages of alcohol consumed by men and women generally result in women having higher blood alcohol concentrations (BACs), since women generally have a higher percentage of body fat and therefore a lower volume of distribution for alcohol than men, and because the stomachs of men tend to metabolize alcohol more quickly.|$|E

Of these issues, <b>alcohol</b> abuse and <b>dependence</b> {{has been linked}} to accelerated HIV disease progression, reduced efficacy of HIV medications, poor adherence to medical regimens and risky sexual behaviors. This study uses the secondary analysis of quantitative and qualitative data collected from 272 HIV-positive African Americans in Los Angeles County to investigate this phenomenon. Analysis revealed that 13. 6 % of participants met the criteria for current <b>alcohol</b> abuse or <b>dependence.</b> Logistic regressions testing the influences of gender, religiosity, spirituality, social support and social network composition on current <b>alcohol</b> abuse and <b>dependence</b> revealed that social support was uniquely influential.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The {{relationship}} between violence and problem gambling in general population samples is under-researched and requires further attention to inform treatment and prevention efforts. We investigated the {{relationship between}} gambling problems and violence among men and sought {{to determine if the}} link can be accounted for by mental disorders, <b>alcohol</b> and drug <b>dependence</b> and impulsivity. SETTING: A United Kingdom representative general population survey conducted in 2009. PARTICIPANTS: A cross-sectional survey of 3025 UK men aged 18 - 64 years. MEASUREMENTS: Binary logistic regression was used to examine relationships. Outcome measures included gambling behaviour and self-reports of violence. Covariates included <b>alcohol</b> and drug <b>dependence,</b> mental illness, impulsivity and socio-demography. FINDINGS: Problem gambling and probable pathological gambling were associated with increased odds of the perpetration of violence (Adjusted Odd Ratios (AOR) 3. 09 (CI = 1. 9 - 5. 0) and 4. 09 (CI = 2. 8 - 6. 3) respectively), and a range of other behaviours such as using a weapon, (AORs 4. 93 (CI = 2. 5 - 9. 6) and 6. 33 (CI = 3. 5 - 11. 4)), and the perpetration of intimate partner violence (AOR 9. 80 (CI = 2. 5 - 39. 0)). The results were attenuated when adjusted for comorbid mental illness, and impulsivity but remained statistically significant. <b>Alcohol</b> and drug <b>dependence</b> had the most impact; relationships were most attenuated when they added into the models, with the latter having the largest effect. CONCLUSIONS: Among men in the United Kingdom, self-reports of problem/pathological gambling remain predictive of a range of measures of violent behaviour after adjusting for <b>alcohol</b> and drug <b>dependence,</b> comorbid mental disorder and impulsivity; of the covariates, <b>alcohol</b> and drug <b>dependence</b> have the greatest effect in attenuating the gambling-violence association...|$|R
5|$|Alcohol has a {{long history}} of use and misuse {{throughout}} recorded history. Biblical, Egyptian and Babylonian sources record the history of abuse and dependence on alcohol. In some ancient cultures alcohol was worshiped and in others, its abuse was condemned. Excessive alcohol misuse and drunkenness were recognized as causing social problems even thousands of years ago. However, the defining of habitual drunkenness as it was then known as and its adverse consequences were not well established medically until the 18th century. In 1647 a Greek monk named Agapios was the first to document that chronic alcohol misuse was associated with toxicity to the nervous system and body which resulted in a range of medical disorders such as seizures, paralysis, and internal bleeding. In 1920 the effects of alcohol abuse and chronic drunkenness led to the failed prohibition of alcohol being considered and eventually enforced briefly in America. In 2005 <b>alcohol</b> <b>dependence</b> and abuse was estimated to cost the US economy approximately 220 billion dollars per year, more than cancer and obesity.|$|E
5|$|Alcoholism, {{also known}} as alcohol use {{disorder}} (AUD), is a broad term for any drinking of alcohol that results in mental or physical health problems. It was previously divided into two types: alcohol abuse and <b>alcohol</b> <b>dependence.</b> In a medical context, alcoholism is said to exist when {{two or more of}} the following conditions is present: a person drinks large amounts over a long time period, has difficulty cutting down, acquiring and drinking alcohol takes up a great deal of time, alcohol is strongly desired, usage results in not fulfilling responsibilities, usage results in social problems, usage results in health problems, usage results in risky situations, withdrawal occurs when stopping, and alcohol tolerance has occurred with use. Risky situations include drinking and driving or having unsafe sex among others. Alcohol use can affect all parts of the body but particularly affects the brain, heart, liver, pancreas, and immune system. This can result in mental illness, Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome, an irregular heart beat, liver failure, and an increase in the risk of cancer, among other diseases. Drinking during pregnancy can cause damage to the baby resulting in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Generally women are more sensitive to alcohol's harmful physical and mental effects than men.|$|E
5|$|Severe acute {{withdrawal}} {{symptoms such as}} delirium tremens and seizures rarely occur after 1-week post cessation of alcohol. The acute withdrawal phase {{can be defined as}} lasting between one and three weeks. In the period of 3–6 weeks following cessation increased anxiety, depression, as well as sleep disturbance, is common; fatigue and tension can persist for up to 5 weeks as part of the post-acute withdrawal syndrome; about a quarter of alcoholics experience anxiety and depression for up to 2 years. These post-acute {{withdrawal symptoms}} have also been demonstrated in animal models of <b>alcohol</b> <b>dependence</b> and withdrawal. A kindling effect also occurs in alcoholics whereby each subsequent withdrawal syndrome is more severe than the previous withdrawal episode; this is due to neuroadaptations which occur as a result of periods of abstinence followed by re-exposure to alcohol. Individuals who have had multiple withdrawal episodes are more likely to develop seizures and experience more severe anxiety during withdrawal from alcohol than alcohol-dependent individuals without a history of past alcohol withdrawal episodes. The kindling effect leads to persistent functional changes in brain neural circuits as well as to gene expression. Kindling also results in the intensification of psychological symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. There are decision tools and questionnaires which help guide physicians in evaluating alcohol withdrawal. For example, the CIWA-Ar objectifies alcohol withdrawal symptoms in order to guide therapy decisions which allows for an efficient interview {{while at the same time}} retaining clinical usefulness, validity, and reliability, ensuring proper care for withdrawal patients, who can be in danger of death.|$|E

It was noted that every individual has an individual sensitivity level to alcohol or sedative hypnotic drugs and what one person can tolerate without ill health another will suffer very ill health and that even moderate drinking can cause rebound anxiety syndromes and sleep disorders. A person who is suffering the toxic effects of alcohol or benzodiazepines will not benefit from other therapies or medications as they do not address the root cause of the symptoms.
