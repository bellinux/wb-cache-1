5|$|Steering was {{controlled}} by a single rudder. Admiral Hipper and Blücher were equipped with three electricity plants with four diesel generators and six turbo-generators each; the diesel generators supplied 150kW apiece, {{four of the six}} turbo-generators provided 460kW, and the final pair provided 230kW. Total electrical output was 2900kW. Prinz Eugen, Seydlitz, and Lützow were equipped with three 150kW diesel generators, four 460kW turbo-generators, one 230kW turbo-generator, and one 150kW <b>AC</b> <b>generator,</b> for a total of 2870kW. All five ships' electrical plants operated at 220volts.|$|E

25|$|During the 1998 Auckland power crisis {{the four}} {{underground}} cables providing power to downtown Auckland all failed between 20 January and 20 February, leaving {{much of the}} downtown area without power for five weeks. Generators were brought in from across the country, however this was still not enough to power Auckland. In {{the first week of}} March Union Rotorua was brought in to supply power to parts of downtown Auckland. Berthed at Freyberg Wharf she was connected up so that her gas turbine and <b>A.C.</b> <b>generator</b> could supply power to one of the cities largest users, Ports of Auckland Ltd. This allowed the container cranes to continue to work at full speed during the outage.|$|E
25|$|Union Rotorua {{was unusual}} {{in that she}} was powered by gas turbine. The ship's main gas turbine / {{electric}} machinery consisted of a single General Electric MM5262RB gas turbine operating on a regenerative cycle. This was coupled to an <b>AC</b> <b>generator</b> to provide a maximum designed continuous rating of 18822kW for a motor propeller speed of 200rpm. The turbine speed of 4670rpm was reduced to 1500rpm for the generator by a reduction gearbox. The generator output 6.6kV 3-phase at 50Hz to the ships motors. There were four closed air circuit water cooled synchronous A.C. motors, arranged with two per shaft. Previous USSCo vessels had traditionally had twin outward turning fixed pitch propellers, however Union Rotorua has twin inward turning controllable pitch propellers. This decision {{was made in the}} interests of maneuverability, since the center of thrust is in the outer part of the disk thus giving a larger turning moment arm. In normal running configuration the whole system could be controlled by a single lever from the bridge. The speed of the gas turbine was controlled by a solid state control and safety system integrated with the propulsion controls.|$|E
500|$|The {{turbines}} {{were initially}} {{intended to use}} electric transmission, and would have produced [...] apiece. The geared turbines were lighter, {{and as a result}} had a slight performance advantage. The geared turbines also had a significantly more robust construction. The ships mounted eight 500kW diesel generators arranged in four pairs, five 690kW turbo-generators, and one 460kW, the last of which was connected to a 400kVA <b>AC</b> <b>generator.</b> Another 550kVA diesel generator provided additional AC power.

2500|$|In 1885 Westinghouse {{imported}} {{a number}} of Gaulard–Gibbs transformers and a Siemens <b>AC</b> <b>generator,</b> to begin experimenting with AC networks in Pittsburgh. Stanley, assisted by engineers Albert Schmid and Oliver B. Shallenberger, developed the Gaulard–Gibbs transformer design into the first practical transformer. In 1886, with Westinghouse's backing, Stanley installed the first multiple-voltage AC power system in Great Barrington, Massachusetts, a demonstration lighting system driven by a hydroelectric generator that produced 500 volts AC stepped down to 100volts to light incandescent bulbs in homes and businesses. That same year, Westinghouse formed the [...] "Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company"; in 1889 he renamed it as [...] "Westinghouse Electric Corporation".|$|E

2500|$|The Westinghouse company {{installed}} 30 more AC-lighting systems {{within a}} year {{and by the end}} of 1887 it had 68 alternating current power stations to Edison's 121 DC-based stations. This competition with Edison led in the late 1880s to what has been called the [...] "War of Currents" [...] with Thomas Edison and his company joining in with a spreading public perception that the high voltages used AC distribution were unsafe. Edison even suggested a Westinghouse <b>AC</b> <b>generator</b> be used in the State of New York's new electric chair. Westinghouse also had to deal with an AC rival, the Thomson-Houston Electric Company who had built 22 power stations by the end of 1887 and by 1889 had bought out another competitor, the Brush Electric Company. Thomson-Houston was expanding their business while trying to avoid patent conflicts with Westinghouse, arranging deals such as coming to agreements over lighting company territory, paying a royalty to use the Stanley transformer patent, and allowing Westinghouse to use their Sawyer–Man incandescent bulb patent. The Edison company, in collusion with Thomson-Houston, manged to arrange in 1890 that the first electric chair was power with a Westinghouse <b>AC</b> <b>generator,</b> forcing Westinghouse to try to block this move via hiring the best lawyer of the day to (unsuccessfully) defend William Kemmler, the first man scheduled to die in the chair. The War of Currents would end with financiers, such as J. P. Morgan, pushing Edison Electric towards AC and pushing out Thomas Edison. In 1892 the Edison company was merged with the Thomson-Houston Electric Company to form General Electric, a conglomerate with the board of Thomson-Houston in control.|$|E
2500|$|Parallel to {{expanding}} {{competition between}} Edison and the AC companies was rising public furor over {{a series of}} deaths {{in the spring of}} 1888 caused by pole mounted high voltage alternating current lines. [...] This turned into a media frenzy against high voltage alternating current and the seemingly greedy and callous lighting companies that used it. Edison took advantage of the public perception of AC as dangerous, and joined with self-styled New York anti-AC crusader Harold P. Brown in a propaganda campaign, aiding Brown in the public electrocution of animals with AC, and supported legislation to control and severely limit AC installations and voltages (to the point of making it an ineffective power delivery system) in what was now being referred to as a [...] "battle of currents". The development of the electric chair was used in an attempt to portray AC as having a greater lethal potential than DC and smear Westinghouse at the same time via Edison colluding with Brown and Westinghouse's chief AC rival, the Thomson-Houston Electric Company, to make sure the first electric chair was powered by a Westinghouse <b>AC</b> <b>generator.</b>|$|E
2500|$|At {{the request}} of death penalty {{commission}} chairman Gerry, Medico-Legal Society members; electrotherapy expert Alphonse David Rockwell, Carlos Frederick MacDonald, and Columbia College professor Louis H. Laudy, were given the task of working {{out the details of}} electrode placement. They again turned to Brown to supply the technical assistance. Brown asked Edison Electric Light to supply equipment for the tests and treasurer Francis S. Hastings (who seemed {{to be one of the}} primary movers at the company trying to portray Westinghouse as a peddler of death dealing AC current) tried to obtain a Westinghouse <b>AC</b> <b>generator</b> for the test but found none was to be had. They ended up using Edison's West Orange laboratory for the animal tests they conducted in mid-March 1889. Superintendent of Prisons Austin E. Lathrop asked Brown to design the chair, but Brown turned down the offer. Dr. George Fell drew up the final designs for a simple oak chair and went against the Medico-Legal Society recommendations, changing the position of the electrodes to the head and the middle of the back. Brown did take on the job of finding the generators needed to power the chair. He managed to surreptitiously acquire three Westinghouse AC generators that were being decommissioned with the help of Edison and Westinghouse's chief AC rival, the Thomson-Houston Electric Company, a move that made sure that Westinghouse's equipment would be associated with the first execution. The electric chair was built by Edwin F. Davis, the first [...] "state electrician" [...] (executioner) for the State of New York.|$|E

50|$|Also in March, Superintendent of Prisons Austin Lathrop asked Brown if {{he could}} supply the {{equipment}} needed for the executions as well as design the electric chair. Brown turned down the job of designing the chair but did agree to fulfill the contract to supply the necessary electrical equipment. The state would not pay up front and Brown apparently turned to Edison Electric as well as Thomson-Houston Electric Company to help obtaining the equipment. This became another behind-the-scenes maneuver to acquire Westinghouse <b>AC</b> <b>generators</b> to supply the current, apparently {{with the help of}} the Edison company and Westinghouses chief AC rival, Thomson-Houston. Thomson-Houston arranged to acquire three Westinghouse <b>AC</b> <b>generators</b> by replacing them with new Thomson-Houston <b>AC</b> <b>generators</b> and Edison Electric probably put up the money to acquire them for Brown. Thomson-Houston president Charles Coffin had at least two reasons for obtaining the Westinghouse generators; he did not want his companys equipment to be associated with the death penalty and he wanted to use one to prove a point, paying Brown to set up a public efficiency test to show that Westinghouses sales claim of manufacturing 50% more efficient generators was false.|$|R
