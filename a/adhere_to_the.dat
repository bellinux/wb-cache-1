5|$|A less {{invasive}} {{approach is}} thoracoscopy, {{usually in the}} form of a procedure called video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). The results from VATS-based pleural abrasion are slightly worse than those achieved using thoracotomy in the short term, but produce smaller scars in the skin. Compared to open thoracotomy, VATS offers a shorter in-hospital stays, less need for postoperative pain control, and a reduced risk of lung problems after surgery. VATS may also be used to achieve chemical pleurodesis; this involves insufflation of talc, which activates an inflammatory reaction that causes the lung to <b>adhere</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> chest wall.|$|E

5|$|During Lê Duẩn's China {{visit in}} June 1973, Zhou {{told him that}} North Vietnam should <b>adhere</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Paris Peace Accords. Following the signing, Lê Thanh Nghị stated that the {{direction}} of Vietnam's communism was directly linked to {{its relations with the}} Soviet Union. The Chinese opposed immediate reunification and to that end, began making economic agreements with the Provisional Revolutionary (Communist) Government of South Vietnam (PRGSV). PRGSV head Nguyễn Hữu Thọ was treated well by the Chinese. This policy further damaged relations. China and Vietnam drifted further apart; eventual Chinese aid did not improve relations.|$|E
5|$|For the Muslim sepoys in the 5th Light Infantry, {{interaction}} with Kasim Mansur, {{who was an}} Indian Muslim merchant in Singapore, served to fuel this sense of divided loyalties further.

Today, he continues to be described as a hero to fiscal conservatives who believe that free markets and low taxes work better than government bureaucracies.

5|$|Octopuses mainly {{move about}} by {{relatively}} slow crawling, with some {{swimming in a}} head-first position. Jet propulsion, or backwards swimming, is their fastest means of locomotion, followed by swimming and crawling. When in no hurry, they usually crawl on either solid or soft surfaces. Several arms are extended forwards, some of the suckers <b>adhere</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> substrate and the animal hauls itself forwards with its powerful arm muscles, while other arms may push rather than pull. As progress is made, other arms move ahead to repeat these actions and the original suckers detach. During crawling, the heart rate nearly doubles, and the animal requires ten or fifteen minutes to recover from relatively minor exercise.|$|E

Barkun notes that the only positive side to this development is that, if conspirators plotting to rule the world are believed to be aliens, traditional human scapegoats (Freemasons, Illuminati, Jews, etc.) are downgraded or exonerated.|$|E
