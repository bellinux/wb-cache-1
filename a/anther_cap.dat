40|$|The {{orchid family}} is {{renowned for its}} {{enormous}} diversity of pollination mechanisms and unusually high occurrence of non-rewarding flowers compared to other plant families. We investigated the pollination biology of Cymbidium lancifolium during 2005 and 2006 in the Yachang Nature Reserve, Guangxi Province, SW China. Our observations showed that Apis cerana cerana (Hymenopterous, Apidae) was the only pollinator. The bee directly landed on the mid-lobe, then adjusted its direction and entered into the flower. When it found no rewards in the flower, it would exit from the flower with the hind legs forcibly grasping the mid-lobe. The pollinaria together with the <b>anther</b> <b>cap</b> adhered to the thorax by the viscidium during the retreating process of the bees. The pollinator stayed for 8 – 71 s in the flower {{with an average of}} 18. 3 s (N = 11). It is likely that C. lancifolium attracted the bee by the purplish chestnut spots on the labellum (false nectar guides) exploiting the foraging preference of bees. The <b>anther</b> <b>cap</b> that remained {{on the back of the}} pollinator blocked the pollinaria from being received by the subsequently visited flower. The height of the <b>anther</b> <b>cap</b> (0. 154 ± 0. 032 cm) (N = 10) together with thorax of the pollinator (2005 : 0. 37 ± 0. 03 cm (N = 10), 2006 : 0. 35 ± 0. 04 cm (N = 7)) was higher than the entrance of the flower (0. 29 ± 0. 04 cm) (N = 21), suggesting a possibility of <b>anther</b> <b>cap</b> retention for geitonogamy. The reproductive success in the population was respectively 21. 13 % and 21. 28 % in 2005 and 2006. Breeding experiments showed that C. lancifolium was self-compatible and there was no significant difference in reproductive success between self-pollination and cross-pollination. There was neither apomixes nor spontaneous autogamy. The pollination success of this species was dependent on pollinators. The viability of seed by TTC was estimated as 85. 78 % (N = 11), and it was not considered to be the key limiting factor for seed germination. Therefore, it is suggested that other factors, such as the density of the pollinators and their pollination frequency, influence the fruit set and maintenance of the populationof C. lancifolium...|$|E

40|$|Mating {{success in}} plants {{depends largely on}} the {{efficiency}} of pollen dispersal. For hermaphrodite plants, self-pollination, either within or among flowers, can reduce mating opportunities because of pollen and ovule discounting and inbreeding depression. Self-pollination may be particularly detrimental in plants such as orchids and asclepiads that package each flower’s pollen into one or more pollinia which, together with accessory structures, comprise a pollinarium. Darwin proposed that physical reconfiguration of pollinaria serves as a mechanism for reducing the likelihood of self-pollination. To be effective, the time taken for pollinarium reconfiguration would need to exceed that spent by a pollinator on a plant. We investigated pollinarium reconfiguration (including pollinarium bending, pollinium shrinking and <b>anther</b> <b>cap</b> retention) in 19 species and found a strong positive relationship between reconfiguration time and the duration of pollinator visits. Reconfiguration times were also consistently longer than pollinator visit times. These results provide strong support for Darwin’s idea that this mechanism promotes cross-pollination. Elsevie...|$|E
40|$|AbstractLittle {{is known}} about the {{pollination}} biology of the large (c. 230 species) African orchid genus, Eulophia. Here we report the discovery of pollination by flower chafer beetles (Cetoniinae; Scarabaeidae) in two color forms of E. ensata and in E. welwitschii. Both species have congested, capitate inflorescences, traits that are generally associated with pollination by flower chafer beetles in Eulophia and other plant genera. Pollinarium reconfiguration, including pollinarium bending and <b>anther</b> <b>cap</b> retention, in these beetle-pollinated species is slow. Such slow reconfiguration is predicted by Darwin's hypothesis to be a mechanism that limits geitonogamous self-pollination by slow moving beetles. A breeding system experiment conducted on E. welwitschii showed that this species, like most others in the genus, is self-compatible, but is dependent on pollinators for fruit set. As all Eulophia species are non-rewarding, the basis of attraction of beetles to flowers of the study species seems to be the generalized resemblance of their inflorescence in terms of flower arrangement and color to the capitula of sympatric rewarding Asteraceae that are utilized as food or rendezvous sites (or both) by flower chafer beetles...|$|E
40|$|The sexual {{dimorphism}} {{of the genera}} Catasetum and Cycnoches is now {{common knowledge}} to orchid growers and investigators. Female flowers of Catasetum are all non-resupinate with a hooded lip, whereas the male flowers can be non-resupinate with a hooded lip or resupinate with a differently shaped lip, depending on the species. Only with male flowers present can the species of a Catasetum can be determined. In Cycnoches, flowers of both sexes are resupinate with a slender and long, curved column, resembling a swan’s neck. The lip of male flowers of C. sect. Heteranthae is provided with finger-like projections, but female flowers of that section and those of C. sect. Cycnoches have an entire lip. Female flowers of both genera observed in the Botanical Garden of Munich bear pollinaria, but they are without any function. Slight movements of the female inflorescences of Catasetum cause the pollinaria to fall off, {{and as a result}} their presence is often overlooked. In female pollinaria of Catasetum the caudicles are absent, making pollination impossible in nature. Their pollen is germinable, and application of the pollinia to the stigma of the same flower yields viable seeds. The seldomobserved intermediate forms have a stigmatic cavity as in the male flowers.

In female Cycnoches, the <b>anther</b> <b>cap</b> does not fall off, so preventing pollination by such a pollinarium.

It is suspected that selfing of the female flowers here also will result in viable seeds. In both cases the female flowers are true hermaphrodites, but because of their limited male function one should think of them as functional female flowers. Male flowers, however, do not develop precursors of ovules, and a stigma is not present. Given the different flower morphologies and the pollination processes, one assumes that the floral fragrances should differ among the sexes of Catasetum flowers. The battered pollinator will remember the negative experience with the male flowers. So different fragrances in the female flowers would be the way out of this dilemma. Floral fragrances of five Catasetum species and two Cycnoches species were investigated by gas chromatography. Only weak differences in the fragrance composition of the separate sexes were detected, begging several questions. What are the forces driving the pollinator from male to female flowers?

40|$|Appendages on orchid floral {{labellum}} {{that lack}} floral rewards for pollinators are considered attractive signals to potential pollinators. Eria coronaria, {{which has an}} unusual autumn flowering season in some locations, has a bright yellow spot on its labellum. This spot has been hypothesized {{to function as a}} visual attractant to potential pollinators because its color may be attractive to insects. We tested this hypothesis using field observations between October and November of 2006 in the Yachang Nature Reserve, Guangxi,southwestern China. Honeybee (Apis cerana cerana) was the only pollinator of this orchid. Generally, honeybees landed directly on the yellow spot on labellum, and then adjusted their position and entered the flower. When honeybees retreated from flowers, the pollinaria were adhered on their thorax, or the pollinaria carried by honeybee were stuck on the stigma. The <b>anther</b> <b>cap,</b> however, did not separate from the column when the pollinaria were carried away from the flower. This orchid did not provide any rewards to honeybees. The flowers of a co-blooming plant, Pittosporum glabratum, with abundant nectars and pollens, attracted numerous honeybee visitations during this period. The flower color and size of P. glabratum were {{similar to that of the}} spot on the labellum of E. coronaria. Based on the behaviors of honeybees on the flowers of both P. glabratum and E. coronaria, we speculated that the bright yellow spot on labellum of this orchid functions as an attractant to honeybees. Hand-pollination experiments showed that E. coronaria wasself-compatible, but that reproductive success depended on pollinators. Under natural conditions, the rate of fruit set of E. coronaria was 20. 72 %, which is very close to the average fruit set of other food deceptive orchids (20. 7 %) ...|$|E
40|$|In Cymbidium flowers, {{emasculation}} by {{removal of}} the pollinia and the <b>anther</b> <b>cap</b> leads within 24 hours to red coloration of the labellum (lip). Lip coloration, being {{the first sign of}} senescence in these flowers, has been ascribed to the action of ethylene in the lip. When a small incision in the base of the lip is made prior to emasculation, or when the lip is excised and placed in water within 10 to 15 hours after emasculation, coloration is considerably delayed. This indicates that a coloration-associated factor is moving in or out of the lip. Measurements of ethylene production of excised flower parts, isolated at different times after emasculation, showed an increase only in the central column; the other flower parts, including the lip, did not show a measurable change. In contrast, in situ measurements of the ethylene production of the central column and the remaining portion of the flower revealed a simultaneous increase in all the flower parts following emasculation. Similarly, application of radiolabeled 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylic acid (ACC) {{to the top of the}} central column in situ leads to the production of radiolabeled ethylene by all the flower parts. In addition, the ethylene production of isolated lips, measured immediately after excision, was initially high but ceased within 10 to 15 minutes. Treatment of the central column in situ with ethylene or ethephon did not stimulate ACC production but did stimulate lip coloration and this was accompanied by an increased internal ethylene concentration in the lip. The data indicate that endogenously produced as well as applied ACC is rapidly translocated from the site of production or application to all the other flower parts where it is immediately converted into ethylene. By excision of a flower organ, the influx of ACC is prevented, causing a rapid decrease in ethylene production. In addition, it was found that ethylene may also be translocated in physiologically significant amounts within the flower. The roles of ACC and ethylene as mobile senescence or wilting factors in emasculation- and pollination-induced senescence is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2009. Orchids {{provide a}} model system for {{addressing}} evolutionary and ecological questions {{both because of}} their species diversity, and because the packaging of their pollen into pollinia facilitates the estimation {{of male and female}} pollination success. This thesis focuses on the ecology and evolution of pollination systems in the African orchid genus Eulophia, with an emphasis on deceptive pollination, mechanisms promoting cross-pollination, and pollinatordriven speciation. Pollination in the deceptive species E. zeyheriana is shown to depend on flower colour and proximity to the rewarding model species, Wahlenbergia cuspidata (Campanulacae). This study demonstrates the functional importance of colour matching between model and mimic in a floral Batesian mimicry system, as well as the importance of facilitation by the rewarding model [chapter 2]. The pollinaria of the vast majority of Eulophia and Acrolophia species undergo reconfiguration following removal by pollinators, similar to the phenomena first described by Darwin in some European orchids and which he hypothesised to be adaptations to limit pollinator mediated self-pollination. In chapter 3, a less common mechanism – <b>anther</b> <b>cap</b> retention – is described for E. foliosa. Observations of reconfiguration times were compared to the respective visit times by pollinators in a number of orchids (including Eulophia and Acrolophia) and asclepiads. In 18 of 19 species, pollinarium reconfiguration times exceed the average visit times, providing empirical support for Darwin’s cross-pollination hypothesis [chapter 4]. All of the 25 species of Eulophia examined are deceptive, but two of the three species in the small, closely related Cape genus Acrolophia examined in chapter 5 are rewarding. This translates into very high levels of pollen transfer efficiency in the rewarding A. cochlearis relative to the deceptive A. capensis and species of Eulophia. In addition, A. cochlearis exhibits high rates of pollinator-mediated self-pollination, as quantified using a novel method based on levels of inbreeding depression during embryo development. In chapter 6 the evolutionary divergence of long- and short-spurred forms of E. parviflora in response to different pollinators is investigated. This shows that divergence has occurred in floral morphology, scent chemistry and flowering phenology and that this can be attributed to adaptations to the respective bee and beetle pollinators of each form. This thesis also includes case histories of bee pollination in an additional five Eulophia species, and beetle-pollination in two other species of Eulophia with dense inflorescences and slow pollinarium reconfiguration [chapter 7]. In addition, four taxa were found to undergo auto-pollination [chapter 8]. The main conclusions of this thesis are that pollination of food-deceptive species can be enhanced by spatial proximity to, and floral colour matching with, sympatric rewarding species; that selection strongly favours traits that promote cross-pollination; that pollinatorshifts can drive speciation; and that floral adaptations for bee-, beetle-, and auto-pollination are found in South African representatives of Eulophia...|$|E
