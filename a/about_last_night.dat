2500|$|Terry Teachout, <b>About</b> <b>Last</b> <b>Night,</b> [...] (January 12, 2009) — Rex Stout's witty, {{fast-moving}} prose hasn't dated a day, while Wolfe {{himself is}} one of the enduringly great eccentrics of popular fiction. I've spent the past four decades reading and re-reading Stout's novels for pleasure, and they have yet to lose their savor ... It is to revel in such writing that I return time and again to Stout's books, and in particular to The League of Frightened Men, Some Buried Caesar, The Silent Speaker, Too Many Women, Murder by the Book, Before Midnight, Plot It Yourself, Too Many Clients, The Doorbell Rang, and Death of a Doxy, which are for me the best of all the full-length Wolfe novels.|$|E

6000|$|As Gabriel {{answered}} {{he heard}} a knocking at the door. His father opened it, and disclosed to view some people from the neighboring fishing village, who had come--more out of curiosity than sympathy--to inquire whether Francois and the boy Pierre had survived the night. Without asking any one to enter, the fisherman surlily and shortly answered the various questions addressed to him, standing in his own doorway. While he was thus engaged, Gabriel heard his grandfather muttering vacantly to himself, [...] "Last night--how <b>about</b> <b>last</b> <b>night,</b> grandson? What was I talking <b>about</b> <b>last</b> <b>night?</b> Did I say your father was drowned? Very foolish {{to say he was}} drowned, and then see him come back alive again! But it wasn't that--I'm so weak in my head, I can't remember. What was it, Gabriel? Something too horrible to speak of? Is that what you're whispering and trembling about? I said nothing horrible. A crime! Bloodshed! I know nothing of any crime or bloodshed here--I must have been frightened out of my wits to talk in that way! The Merchant's Table? Only a big heap of old stones! What with the storm, and thinking I was going to die, and being afraid about your father, I must have been light-headed. Don't give another thought to that nonsense, Gabriel! I'm better now. We shall all live to laugh at poor grandfather for talking nonsense about crime and bloodshed in his sleep. Ah, poor old man--last night--light-headed--fancies and nonsense of an old man--why don't you laugh at it? I'm laughing--so light-headed, so light--" ...|$|E

60|$|I cannot forbear a word <b>about</b> <b>last</b> <b>night.</b> I think I {{have told}} you sometimes, my much-loved friend, how, when I was a mere boy, I was one of your {{faithful}} and devoted adherents in the pit; I believe as true {{a member of that}} true host of followers as it has ever boasted. As I improved myself and was improved by favouring circumstances in mind and fortune, I only became the more earnest (if it were possible) in my study of you. No light portion of my life arose before me when the quiet vision to which I am beholden, in I don't know how great a decree, or for how much--who does?--faded so nobly from my bodily eyes last night. And if I were to try to tell you what I felt--of regret for its being past for ever, and of joy in the thought that you could have taken your leave of me but in God's own time--I should only blot this paper with some drops that would certainly not be of ink, and give very faint expression to very strong emotions.|$|E

I knew you were fond of my girl; you never would have done for her what you did unless you had been, and I was quite sure that she was fond of you; how could she help it? And I had been fancying as soon as this war was over--for, of course, you could not leave now--you would be coming home, and I should be having you both with me in some snug little place there. However, lad, that's over for the present; but not for always, I hope. All this has not changed my opinion of the affair. The fact that you have suffered horribly and unjustly is nothing against you personally; and, indeed, you will make Mary a better husband for having gone through such a trial than you would have done had not this come upon you." ...|$|E
