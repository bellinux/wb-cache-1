5|$|An {{aspect of}} Murder on the Orient Express which many reviewers praised was the game's audio. The voice acting in {{particular}} gained widespread positive reviews. GameSpot called the voice acting excellent, {{with the voice}} actors bringing the characters to life, thanks largely to David Suchet as Poirot. IGN also called the voice acting well done, despite a few characters sounding artificial. Music in the game was positively reviewed by 2404, who {{said that it was}} tense <b>at</b> <b>moments,</b> but probably could have been played more frequently throughout the game. 2404 also praised the game for providing realistic sound effects, such as noises coming from the Orient Express itself, and other environmental noises such as howling wind. IGN, in contrast, heavily criticized the game for a lack of background music, and simplistic and monotonous sound effects.|$|E

In 1979, Miguel D'Escoto Brockman, a priest who had embraced Liberation Theology, served in the government as foreign minister when the Sandinistas came to power.

Roman Catholicism came to Nicaragua in the 16th century with the Spanish conquest and remained, until 1939, the established faith.|$|E

Through December 2016, 32 plays have been commissioned and ten of these have reached the stage, beginning with American Night: The Ballad of Juan Jose (2010). It was followed by Ghost Light (2011); The March (2011 at Steppenwolf Theatre Company); Party People and All the Way (2012); The Liquid Plain (2013); the sequel to All the Way, The Great Society (2014, commissioned by and co-produced with Seattle Repertory Theatre), Sweat (2015), Indecent (2015 at Yale Repertory Theatre and La Jolla Playhouse; 2016 at Vineyard Theatre; 2017 on Broadway), and Roe (co-produced with Arena Stage and Berkeley Repertory Theatre).|$|E

500|$|In the United Kingdom, the actor-managers of the Victorian era (including Kean, Samuel Phelps, Macready, and Henry Irving) staged Shakespeare {{in a grand}} manner, with {{elaborate}} scenery and costumes.

40|$|This article {{illustrates}} {{the use of}} microeconometric decomposition techniques to characterize changes in aggregate variables.

500|$|According to Stephen Dillon, Lynch's use of {{different}} camera positions throughout the film, such as hand-held points of view, makes the viewer [...] "identify with the suspense {{of the character}} {{in his or her}} particular space", but that Lynch <b>at</b> <b>moments</b> also [...] "disconnects the camera from any particular point of view, thereby ungrounding a single or even a human perspective" [...] so that the multiple perspectives keep contexts from merging, significantly troubling [...] "our sense of the individual and the human". Andrew Hageman similarly notes that the camera work in the film [...] "renders a very disturbing sense of place and presence", such as the scene in Winkie's where the [...] "camera floats irregularly during the shot-reverse shot dialogue" [...] by which the [...] "spectator becomes aware that a set of normally objective shots have become disturbingly subjective". Scholar Curt Hersey recognizes several avant-garde techniques used in the film including lack of transitions, abrupt transitions, motion speed, nontraditional camera movement, computer-generated imagery, nondiegetic images, nonlinear narration and intertextuality.|$|E
500|$|Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly praised it as [...] "a {{new movie}} {{landmark}} of cruelty and transcendence" [...] and as [...] "a {{movie about a}} life that gets taken away, and that's why it lets us touch what life is". He also commented very positively about Ejiofor's performance, while further stating, [...] "12 Years a Slave lets us stare at the primal sin of America with open eyes, and <b>at</b> <b>moments</b> {{it is hard to}} watch, yet it's a movie of such humanity and grace that at every moment, you feel you're seeing something essential. It is Chiwetel Ejiofor's extraordinary performance that holds the movie together, and that allows us to watch it without blinking. He plays Solomon with a powerful inner strength, yet he never soft-pedals the silent nightmare that is Solomon's daily existence." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone, gave the film a four-star rating and said: [...] "you won't be able to tuck this powder keg in the corner of your mind and forget it. What {{we have here is a}} blistering, brilliant, straight-up classic." [...] He later named the film the best movie of 2013.|$|E
500|$|Gyllenhaal's {{break-out}} {{role was}} in the black comedy, Secretary (2002), a film about two people who embark on a mutually fulfilling BDSM lifestyle. The New York Times critic Stephen Holden noted: [...] "The role of Lee, which Maggie Gyllenhaal imbues with a restrained comic delicacy and sweetness, should make her a star." [...] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote: [...] "Maggie Gyllenhaal, as the self-destructive secretary, is enigmatic and, <b>at</b> <b>moments,</b> sympathetic." [...] The film received generally favorable reviews, and Gyllenhaal's performance earned her the Best Breakthrough Performance by an Actress award from the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures, her first Golden Globe nomination, and an Independent Spirit Award nomination. Secretary was Gyllenhaal's first film role which featured full frontal nudity. Although impressed with the script, she initially had some qualms about doing the film, which she believed could deliver an anti-feminist message. Yet after carefully discussing the script with the film's director, Steven Shainberg, she agreed to join the project. Although insisting Shainberg did not exploit her, Gyllenhaal has said she felt [...] "scared when filming began" [...] and that [...] "in the wrong hands... even in just slightly less intelligent hands, this movie could say something really weird." [...] Since then, she is guarded about discussing {{her role in the}} film, saying only that [...] "despite myself, sometimes the dynamic that you are exploring in your work spills over into your life." ...|$|E

500|$|In Chinese opera, {{breath is}} based in the pubic region and {{supported}} by the abdominal muscles. Performers follow the basic principle that [...] "Strong centralized breath moves the melodic-passages" [...] (zhong qi xing xiang). Breath is visualized being drawn up through a central breathing cavity extending from the pubic region {{to the top of the}} head. This [...] "cavity" [...] must be under the performer's control at all times, and he or she develops special techniques to control both entering and exiting air. The two major methods of taking in breath are known as [...] "exchanging breath" [...] (huan qi) and [...] "stealing breath" [...] (tou qi). [...] "Exchanging breath" [...] is a slow, unhurried process of breathing out old air and taking in new. It is used <b>at</b> <b>moments</b> when the performer is not under time constraint, such as during a purely instrumental musical passage or when another character is speaking. [...] "Stealing breath" [...] is a sharp intake of air without prior exhalation, and is used during long passages of prose or song when a pause would be undesirable. Both techniques should be invisible to the audience and take in only the precise amount of air required for the intended vocalization. The most important principle in exhalation is [...] "saving the breath" [...] (cun qi). Breath should not be expended all at once at the beginning of a spoken or sung passage, but rather expelled slowly and evenly over its length. Most songs and some prose contain precise written intervals for when breath should be [...] "exchanged" [...] or [...] "stolen". These intervals are often marked by carats.|$|E
