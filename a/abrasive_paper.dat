40|$|Human finger pad {{friction}} {{and the effects}} of surface features on the fingerprint ridges, shape of the finger and the material properties of the finger were investigated. The friction coefficients for three fine-grit <b>abrasive</b> <b>papers</b> were measured to assess these effects. Four probing surfaces were used: human index finger pad, silicone replicas of the finger with and without fingerprints, and a smooth silicone sphere. Friction tests were performed at a constant normal load of 0. 5 N in two probe orientations: normal and perpendicular to the orientation of the fingerprint ridges. Scanning electron microscopy of the <b>abrasive</b> <b>papers</b> was performed to examine their surface topography. Based on the trends in coefficients of friction, topography of the <b>abrasive</b> <b>papers,</b> surface features of the finger pad, and the shape and elastic properties of the finger, possible friction mechanisms were discussed. It was inferred that the change {{in the shape of the}} probe (from a sphere to the finger shape) changes the adhesion and deformation components of friction, the presence of fingerprints adds an interlocking contribution to the {{friction and}} decrease the adhesion and deformation components of friction, and the elastic properties of the finger lead to an increase in all the three components of friction...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{processing}} of thick cold work tool steel coating using high velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) spraying process. A full factorial experimental design was established to identify the influencing process parameters on the formation of dense coating with low oxidation. Microstructural analysis of the coating was carried out using optical, SEM and XRD techniques. Cold work tool steel coatings with a thickness up to 2 mm were developed on bond coated low carbon steel substrates for wear resistance evaluation. A pin on disc test was performed to examine the wear resistance of thick cold work tool steel coatings on different types and sizes of <b>abrasive</b> <b>papers.</b> The wear results were compared with the wear resistance of a standard high speed steel pin. The abrasive wear resistance of cold work tool steel coated pins {{was found to be}} superior against soft and fine <b>abrasive</b> <b>papers</b> than the standard high speed steel. Besides, the performance of the coated pins against hard and coarser <b>abrasive</b> <b>papers</b> was found to be similar to standard high speed steel. The study showed the potential of HVOF spraying on the development of thick cold work tool steel coatings for wear resistance applications. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

The high polish shine can be accomplished by buffing with chrome oxide (ex. white chrome, green chrome), hand rubbing with extremely fine wet-or-dry <b>abrasive</b> <b>paper,</b> or with a Japanese water-stone, which has an approximate grit of 10,000-12,000.

40|$|Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) {{disciplines}} {{are challenging}} to {{blind and visually}} impaired (BVI) individuals. One of the possible reasons is the complexity in representing and understanding scientific content. Introducing tactile elements such as textures into existing Braille characters can potentially increase the information content of Braille and could likely simplify the complex notations. However, such a task requires a thorough understanding of the discrimination of textures through touch. The current dissertation focuses on: 1) Investigating the psychophysical factors involved in texture discrimination and, 2) Developing a testing system to assess friction induced skin damage from repetitive motion over textured surfaces. The tactile discrimination sensitivity for six fine textured non-patterned surfaces (fine-grit <b>abrasive</b> <b>papers)</b> was evaluated using a two-alternative forced choice technique. The surface roughness parameters and the coefficient of friction of the <b>abrasive</b> <b>papers</b> interacting with human skin were measured. Scanning electron microscopy images were used to observe the surface microstructure. The results suggest that differences in the mean spacing and the friction coefficients could be indicative of differentiability of fine textured samples. Three clearly differentiable textures identified from this study were used to investigate the effect of texture area on tactile discrimination sensitivity. A perception measurement experiment in combination with a friction measurement experiment was performed to understand the possible role of friction in touch-based texture discrimination. There was decrease in the discrimination ability with the decrease in the texture area. An elastomeric skin simulant with layered structure similar to that of human skin was constructed to replicate skin friction blisters. The relationship between applied normal load and number of cycles of reciprocating motion required for blistering was studied. Additionally, a crack-growth model was developed treating the skin simulant as an adhesive-bonded laminar composite. This study made it evident that complete profile of the tribological system is required to develop a skin simulant that can accurately predict skin friction damage. Based on the current literature, the role of surface topography and elastic properties of the human skin on friction was uncertain. Coefficient of friction of four probing surfaces, human index finger pad, silicone replicas of the finger with and without fingerprints, and a smooth silicone sphere, when sliding against fine grit <b>abrasive</b> <b>papers</b> were compared to identify these roles...|$|R

Other requirements are a pattern of some kind, some brown gummed tape (IE as the moistened glue dries it causes the tape to shrink and so the veneer pieces are pulled closer together), PVA glue and a base-board with balancing veneers on the alternate face to compensate stresses. Finishing the piece will require fine <b>abrasive</b> <b>paper</b> always backed by a sanding block. Either ordinary varnish, special varnishes, modern polyurethane -oil or water based- good waxes and even the technique of french polish are different methods used to seal and finish the piece.|$|E

50|$|Scary sharp is {{a method}} of {{sharpening}} woodworking tools with sandpaper instead of conventional methods of oilstone or waterstone sharpening. The sandpaper referred to here can be any abrasive impregnated sheet used in the various industries to smooth surfaces and examples include glass paper, silicon carbide, emery cloth, etc. The sandpaper is affixed to another hard, flat substrate to create the sharpening surface. Sheet-glass is commonly used, but a machinist's granite surfacing block, marble baking slabs, plywood, medium-density fibreboard (MDF) or even jointer out-feed tables will produce satisfactory results.

Replacement kits for these rollers are easily obtainable and can solve the problem.An alternative is to enlarge the roller slightly by using heat shrink over the output rollers. The heat shrink extra diameter pulls the paper quicker and resolves the wear/slip issues.

The samples were then washed vigorously to remove any adhering coal and Si–C particles and two final dry polishes on DP-Mol and DP-Nap (Struers), sprayed gently by N 2 gas and stored inside the desiccators and maintained in dry conditions.

50|$|Several Wacom models, {{including}} the Intuos4 and Bamboo, were criticized for the drawing surface's roughness, which caused the small pressure-sensitive 'nib' to wear down, and become slanted or scratchy {{in the same}} way as pencil lead, albeit more slowly. This could also cause the surface to become smoother where it is used more, resulting in uneven slick and non-slick areas. As the nibs were only short lengths of plastic, it was possible for a user wanting a more durable nib to improvise a replacement from a short length of nylon 'wire' (approx 0.065 inches or 1.7mm diameter) like that found in grass trimmer or 'weed-eater' refills, suitably straightened by hand and smoothed (rounded off) at one end with <b>abrasive</b> <b>paper.</b> Additionally, a thin sheet of glass or acetate can be placed over the drawing surface to avert surface or nib damage {{in the same way}} as screen protectors are used on phones, although in the case of glass this may induce a—usually modest—parallax error when tracing.|$|E
50|$|Once {{the general}} shape is made, the carver may {{use a variety}} of tools for {{creating}} details. For example, a “veiner” or “fluter” {{can be used to make}} deep gouges into the surface, or a “v-tool” for making fine lines or decorative cuts. Once the finer details have been added, the wood carver finishes the surface. The method chosen depends on the required quality of surface finish. The texture left by shallow gouges gives 'life' to the carving's surface and many carvers prefer this 'tooled' finish. If a completely smooth surface is required general smoothing can be done with tools such as “rasps,” which are flat-bladed tools with a surface of pointed teeth. “Rifflers” are similar to rasps, but smaller, usually double ended, and of various shapes for working in folds or crevasses. The finer polishing is done with <b>abrasive</b> <b>paper.</b> Large grained paper with a rougher surface is used first, with the sculptor then using finer grained paper that can make the surface of the sculpture slick to the touch.|$|E

Two {{three-dimensional}} parameters selected to characterize their surface roughness – one parameter for {{the distribution of}} roughness-profile peaks {{and the other for}} the relative area of the roughness-profile peaks above the threshold height – were compared against tactile roughness. The parameters were obtained from roughness profiles as determined by a robust Gaussian regression filter (RGRF) using seven cutoffs. The RGRF filtering process was adjusted specifically for the evaluation of wood surface roughness. Except for a cutoff wavelength of 0.25 [*]mm, the RGRF lent itself well to the determination of roughness profiles. No distortion of roughness profiles occurred around deep valleys, and there was a good correlation between the parameters and tactile roughness.|$|R
