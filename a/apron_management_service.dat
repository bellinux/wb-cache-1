40|$|With the {{development}} of time <b>management</b> <b>service</b> of Run-Time Infrastructure (RTI), {{it is necessary to}} consider an efficient design approach and an algorithm of Greatest Available Logical Time (GALT) computation. However, many time <b>management</b> <b>services</b> of existing RTIs have difficult in modification and extension. Although some RTIs avoid this difficulty through modular design, they comply with not IEEE 1516 HLA/RTI but HLA 1. 3. In addition, a lot of RTIs made use of well-known Mattern’s algorithm for GALT computation. However, Mattern’s algorithm has a few limitations for applying to HLA/RTI. This paper proposes a modular design and an implementation of time <b>management</b> <b>service</b> for IEEE 1516 HLA/RTI. We divided the time <b>management</b> <b>service</b> module into two sub-modules: a TIME module and a GALT module and used Mattern’s algorithm improved for IEEE 1516 HLA/RTI.
