5|$|Toward {{the end of}} September 1941, Sorge {{transmitted}} information that Japan would not initiate hostilities against the USSR in the East, thereby freeing Red Army divisions stationed in Siberia for the defence of Moscow. In October 1941 Sorge was unmasked and arrested by the Japanese. <b>Apparently,</b> <b>he</b> was entirely trusted by the German ambassador Eugen Ott, and was allowed access to top secret cables from Berlin in the embassy in Tokyo. Eventually, this involvement would lead to Heinrich Georg Stahmer replacing Ott in January 1943. Sorge {{on the other hand}} would be executed in November 1944 and elevated to a national hero in the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|The {{taxi driver}} and his {{companion}} hold Homer hostage {{deep into the}} rainforest. They force Homer {{to make a phone}} call to Marge, telling her that if the family provides 50,000 dollars to the kidnappers, he will be released. However, the Simpsons do not have enough money so they go looking for Homer instead. Walking through the streets of Rio de Janeiro, they run into a parade that features a Teleboobies float with characters from the show. Lisa is surprised to discover that Ronaldo is working inside the costume of the dancing flamingo from Teleboobies—a well-paid job he got after learning to dance with the shoes he bought with Lisa's donation money. Ronaldo tells Lisa that he stopped writing to her because he did not know which state she lives in, since it was the orphanage that used to send his letters. Later, Ronaldo gives the Simpsons the money they need to save Homer. Meanwhile, Homer shows the kidnappers a scrapbook he made of his kidnapping memories. <b>Apparently,</b> <b>he</b> has developed Stockholm syndrome. The family and the kidnappers then meet up high over a valley near the Sugarloaf Mountain in two separate cable cars. The Simpsons toss the kidnappers their money, and when Homer jumps into his family's cable car, the cables break, sending the family crashing into the mountainside and rolling down to the ground. They all survive unharmed, but Bart is then eaten whole by an anaconda. The episode ends with Bart dancing inside the snake to carnival music.|$|E

5000|$|Daishizen (Daishizen) - [...] - drums - He's big and reticent. His spirit reaches {{higher than}} the clouds. He rarely gets angry but when <b>he</b> does, <b>apparently</b> <b>he's</b> super scary. With his big body and heart he watches over the members and the fans, a magnanimous man.|$|R
5000|$|... "Stephen Harper {{has made}} a lot of {{promises}} to a lot of people. <b>Apparently,</b> <b>he's</b> made a few too many. Now he admits he'll have to either raise taxes, or run a deficit to pay for them all. Wow. He's not even elected yet. And he's already running a deficit." ...|$|R

25|$|About Julian's {{personal}} life little is known. <b>Apparently</b> <b>he</b> became related {{in some way}} (probably through his daughter) {{to the family of}} the Roman emperor Didius Julianus, who reigned during the year 93.|$|E
25|$|There remains some {{dispute about}} Gamsakhurdia's {{behaviour}} or strategy during his pre-trial detention {{and the trial}} itself. In particular, this concerns a TV broadcast in which, <b>apparently,</b> <b>he</b> recanted his activities as a human rights activist.|$|E
5000|$|Ayato {{is related}} to Yen and Jin. <b>Apparently,</b> <b>he's</b> their cousin. He knows of Yen and Jin being Gakushi, and isn't bothered by it at all. He's quiet and polite.

5000|$|The Scotland on Sunday [...] {{reported}} senior party {{figures were}} furious that O'Donnell {{did not speak}} to leader Tavish Scott before deciding to quit. A senior Liberal Democrat source said: [...] "He didn't even {{pick up the phone}} to the party leader. <b>Apparently</b> <b>he's</b> been unhappy for some time. He {{is not going to be}} missed and we will be a far more united team without him." ...|$|R
25|$|On February 20, 1810 he {{was named}} viceroy of New Granada. He held the title until August, but never took up the position. <b>Apparently</b> <b>he</b> was {{diverted}} to New Spain before his arrival in New Granada.|$|E
25|$|Three {{days before}} the attack, on 5 June, Katō accused people at his {{workplace}} of hiding his work clothes, and left work immediately afterwards. <b>Apparently</b> <b>he</b> believed {{at this point he}} was going to lose his job, though this was not actually the case, and may have triggered the attack.|$|E
25|$|Domitius {{married his}} first cousin once removed Agrippina the Younger, Caligula's sister, after her thirteenth {{birthday}} in 28. He was 30 {{years old at}} the time.

6000|$|... "It is {{upon the}} theory of ladies and all young people," [...] said her husband, with a shrug, feeling {{his way to the}} matches on the mantel, and then {{dropping}} them with a sign, as if recollecting that he must not smoke there. [...] "I've no doubt Tom feels himself an awful sinner. But <b>apparently</b> <b>he's</b> resigned to his sin; he isn't going to give her up." ...|$|R

I'm sure--yes, of course, there's his suitcase--that's {{the car of}} {{that nice}} boy--don't you {{remember}}?--the one that pulled {{us out of the}} mud at--I don't remember the name of the place. <b>Apparently</b> <b>he's</b> keeping going. I remember; he's headed for Seattle, too. We'll look for him in the theater. Oh, the darling, there's his cat! What was the funny name he gave her--the Marchioness Montmorency or something?" ...|$|R
25|$|<b>Apparently</b> <b>he</b> was {{privy to}} the Southampton Plot in July 1415, when he stirred some {{movement}} in the Welsh Marches. On {{the failure of the}} scheme he went again into hiding. Oldcastle was no doubt the instigator of the abortive Lollard plots of 1416, and appears to have intrigued with the Scots also.|$|E
25|$|Iulianus {{was born}} {{during the last}} years of the Emperor Trajan (r. 98–117), {{probably}} at the village of Pupput near the Roman colony of Hadrumetum, on the east coast of Africa Province (now modern Sousse in Tunisia). <b>Apparently</b> <b>he</b> came from a Latin-speaking family. At Hadrumetum, an inscription has been discovered which describes his career in office.|$|E
25|$|The Auckland cathedral {{used to be}} square, {{and they}} wanted to make it into a cross shape, but no one could work out how to design it to be safe. Later on an English carpenter, who had lived in New Zealand {{for a couple of years}} worked out how to. <b>Apparently</b> <b>he</b> was a fantastic artist, and his name was George Day.|$|E
50|$|<b>Apparently</b> unfazed, <b>he</b> falsified a degree. He stole {{documents}} and forged signatures, giving himself fictitious bachelor's and master's degrees.|$|R

25|$|At {{some time}} in the 1530s or early 1540s he went to Ferrara, which was to become the center for {{experimental}} secular music in Italy from the middle {{to the end of the}} 16th century. <b>Apparently</b> <b>he</b> served as a music tutor to the Duke of Este as well as some of his family members, and some of Vicentino's music was sung at the court of Ferrara.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{his music}} is in the most {{advanced}} style of the time. His four-part vocal music usually has a highly ornamented and expressive melodic line; the differentiation of the melodic line from the others {{is one of the}} defining features of the early Baroque. Sometimes he experimented with the Enharmonic scale, or enharmonic chromaticism which required microtonal tunings; <b>apparently</b> <b>he</b> built a special pipe organ in the 1590s for playing this kind of music.|$|E
25|$|The {{leader of}} the team - Komov leaves the ship to scout the {{surroundings}} of the base. However, Piere Semyonov soon comes to the base himself. <b>Apparently,</b> <b>he</b> tries {{to communicate with the}} humans, they do not understand him and he leaves again. The behavior of the Kid (the official nickname given to Piere, hence the Russian title of the novel) is rather strange. This leads the humans to assume that he was raised by the local alien race.|$|E

25|$|It {{was during}} this {{productive}} period of research, {{in the summer of}} 1934, prior to the eventual invention of nylon, that Carothers disappeared. He did not come into work, and no one knew where he was. He was found in a small psychiatric clinic, Pinel Clinic, near the famous Phipps Clinic associated with Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. <b>Apparently,</b> <b>he</b> had become so depressed that he drove to Baltimore to consult a psychiatrist, who put him in the clinic.|$|E
25|$|In 1983, a man {{claimed to}} have frequented the Barrowland Ballroom with the suspect and {{confirmed}} that he knew the killer.

The alleged suspect was traced living in the Netherlands, married to a Dutch woman. Nothing more was ever heard from the man or the reputed suspect.|$|E
25|$|In May the Melvilles {{moved to}} Lansingburgh, almost 12 {{miles north of}} Albany, into a rented house {{on the east side}} of the river in what is now Troy, at 1st Avenue and 114th Street.

What Melville did after his term at Sikes ended until November, or if he even had a job after that, remains a mystery. <b>Apparently</b> <b>he</b> courted a local Lansingburgh girl sometime during the summer, but nothing else is known.|$|E
