5|$|In the 1682 {{assembly}} of the Riksdag of the Estates, the king put forth his suggestion for military reform, whereby each of the lands of Sweden were to have 1,200 soldiers <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ready,</b> at all times, and two farms were to provide accommodations for one soldier. His soldiers were known as Caroleans, trained to be skilled and preferring to attack rather than defend. Savaging and looting were strictly forbidden. Soldier huts around the country were the most visible {{part of the new}} Swedish allotment system. However, Charles also modernized the military techniques and worked to improve the overall skill and knowledge of the officers by sending them abroad to study.|$|E
5|$|The {{skirmish}} {{became a}} full-scale battle by 4:00p.m. After the Americans drove Captain Pipe's Delawares {{out of the}} woods and onto to prairie, the Delawares were reinforced by Dunquat's Wyandots. Elliott also arrived on the scene and coordinated the actions of the Delawares and the Wyandots. Pipe's Delawares skillfully outflanked the American position and then attacked their rear. A few Indians crept close to the American lines in the tall prairie grass. The Americans responded by climbing trees to get a better shot at them. Gunsmoke filled the air, making it difficult to see. After {{three and a half hours}} of incessant firing, the Indians gradually broke off the attack with the approach of nightfall. Both sides slept with arms <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ready,</b> and surrounded their positions with large fires to prevent surprise night attacks.|$|E
5|$|With Hurricane Dean's path {{predicted}} well {{in advance}} of the storm, the Government of Mexico was able to make ample preparations. On August 17, a state of emergency was declared for the state of Quintana Roo where Dean was expected to make landfall. On August 18 authorities began evacuating tourists and those residents living in the most vulnerable parts of Quintana Roo. The state government set up storm shelters in schools and other public buildings. With emergency supplies <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ready,</b> the state of Yucatán, Quintana Roo's neighbour to the northwest, declared a green alert. On August 19 a hurricane watch was issued on the Yucatán Peninsula from Chetumal to San Felipe and residents made their last-minute preparations.|$|E

When there was danger, an Army of the Empire was mustered from among the elements constituting it, in order to conduct an imperial military campaign or Reichsheerfahrt during an Imperial War (Reichskrieg) or an Imperial Execution (Reichsexekution). In practice, the imperial troops often had stronger local allegiances than their loyalty to the Emperor.|$|E
25|$|Preparations {{to perform}} a final assault on the fort began on 20 October; siege ladders were distributed, and {{officers}} were told where they would strike the fort. Finally, on 22 October, Peter decided to perform the assault. At one o'clock in the morning, a fire {{broke out in the}} fort. Local hunters and men from the Preobrazhensky Regiment, among others, waited <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ready</b> in landing boats, two miles away from the fort.

Anti- and pro-monarchy protesters, both paid by Roosevelt, violently clashed in the streets, looting and burning mosques and newspapers, leaving almost 300 dead. The pro-monarchy leadership, chosen, hidden and finally unleashed {{at the right moment}} by the CIA team, led by retired army General and former Minister of Interior in Mosaddegh's cabinet, Fazlollah Zahedi joined with underground figures such as the Rashidian brothers and local strongman Shaban Jafari, to gain the upper hand on 19 August 1953 (28 Mordad). The military joined on cue: pro-Shah tank regiments stormed the capital and bombarded the prime minister's official residence, on Roosevelt's cue, according to his book. Mosaddegh managed to flee from the mob that set in to ransack his house, and, the following day, surrendered to General Zahedi, who was meanwhile set up by the CIA with makeshift headquarters at the Officers' Club. Mosaddegh was arrested at the Officers' Club and transferred to a military jail shortly after. On 22 August, the Shah returned from Rome.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the {{establishment}} of the Hospital Corps, enlisted medical support in the Navy was limited in scope. In the Continental Navy and the early U.S. Navy, medical assistants were assigned at random out of the ship's company. Their primary duties were to keep the irons hot and buckets of sand <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ready</b> for the operating area. It was commonplace during battle for the surgeons to conduct amputations and irons were used to close lacerations and wounds. Sand was used to keep the surgeon from slipping on the bloody ship deck. Previously, corpsmen were commonly referred to as a loblolly boy, a term borrowed from the Royal Navy, and a reference to the daily ration of porridge fed to the sick. The nickname was in common use for so many years that it was finally officially recognized by the Navy Regulations of 1814. In coming decades, the title of the enlisted medical assistant would change several times—from loblolly boy, to nurse (1861), and finally to bayman (1876). A senior enlisted medical rate, surgeon's steward, was introduced in 1841 and remained through the Civil War. Following the war, the title surgeon's steward was abolished in favor of apothecary, a position requiring completion of a course in pharmacy.|$|E

However, many senior cavalry officers disagreed, and despite limited usefulness, maintained cavalry regiments <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ready</b> throughout the war. Scarce wartime resources were used to train and maintain cavalry regiments that were rarely used.

Dump trucks loaded with dirt {{were ready to}} make earthen dikes around the Riegel paper mill, due to the severe damage caused to it by hurricanes earlier that year which caused the 1955 Delaware River flood. Recent flooding, from Hurricane Diane, along the Delaware River kept residents along its banks alert should the storm strike, business owners were also ready to move their merchandise if the need arose. New York City officials prepared for the worst, with police officers filling gas tanks of their patrol cars and extra patrol men being called to duty {{in advance of the}} hurricane. [...] Flights were canceled in New York, firemen stood <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ready</b> in Staten Island, and the Coast Guard warned shipping companies of the impending storm.

500|$|The {{preliminary}} {{phase of}} the Canadian Corps artillery bombardment began on 20 March 1917, with a systematic two-week bombardment of German batteries, trenches and strong points. The Canadian Corps paid particular attention to eliminating German barbed wire, a task made easier {{with the introduction of}} the No. 106 instantaneous fuse. In addition, only half of the available artillery was committed at any one point in time with the intensity of the barrage expressly varied as to confuse the Germans and preserve some level of secrecy. Phase two lasted the entire week beginning 2 April 1917 and employed the entire artillery arsenal at the disposal of the Canadian Corps, massing the equivalent of one heavy gun for every [...] and one field gun for every [...] The German soldiers came to refer to the week before the attack as 'the week of suffering'. By the Germans' own account, their trenches and defensive works were almost completely demolished. Furthermore, German health and morale suffered from the stress of remaining <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ready</b> for eleven straight days under extremely heavy artillery bombardment. Compounding German difficulties was the inability of ration parties to bring food supplies to the front lines. On 3 April, General von Falkenhausen ordered his reserve divisions to prepare to relieve frontline divisions {{over the course of a}} long drawn-out defensive battle, in a manner similar to the Battle of the Somme. However, the divisions were kept [...] from the battlefield to avoid being shelled.|$|E

500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{stated that}} Moore [...] "has the {{superficial}} attributes for the job: The urbanity, the quizzically raised eyebrow, the calm under fire and in bed". However, {{he felt that}} Moore wasn't satisfactory in living up to the legacy left by Sean Connery in the preceding films. He rated the villains [...] "a little banal", adding that the film [...] "doesn't have a Bond villain worthy of the Goldfingers, Dr. Nos and Oddjobs of the past." [...] Chris Nashawaty similarly argues that Dr. Kananga/Mr. Big is the worst villain of the Roger Moore James Bond films. BBC Films reviewer William Mager praised the use of locations, but said that the plot was [...] "convoluted". He stated that [...] "Connery and Lazenby had an air of concealed thuggishness, clenched fists <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ready,</b> but in Moore's case a sardonic quip and a raised eyebrow are his deadliest weapons". Reviewer Leonard Maltin rated the film {{two and a half}} stars out of four, describing it as a [...] "barely memorable, overlong James Bond movie" [...] that [...] "seems merely an excuse to film wild chase sequences". Danny Peary noted that Jane Seymour portrays [...] "one of the Bond series's most beautiful heroines" [...] but had little praise for Moore, whom he described as making [...] "an unimpressive debut as James Bond in Tom Mankiewicz's unimaginative adaptation of Ian Fleming's second novel…The movie stumbles along most of the way. It's hard to remember Moore is playing Bond at times – in fact, if he and Seymour were black, the picture could pass as one of the black exploitation films of the day. There are few interesting action sequences – a motorboat chase is trite enough to begin with, but the filmmakers make it worse by throwing in some stupid Louisiana cops, including pot-bellied Sheriff Pepper." ...|$|E
