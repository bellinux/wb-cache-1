5|$|By contrast, ovarian cancer, {{the leading}} cause of {{reproductive}} organ cancer deaths, and the fifth commonest cause of cancer deaths in women in the United States, lacks an effective screening programme, and is predominantly a disease of women in industrialised countries. Because it is largely asymptomatic in its earliest stages, more than 50% of women have stage III or higher cancer (spread beyond the ovaries) by the time they <b>are</b> <b>diagnosed,</b> with a consequent poor prognosis.|$|E
5|$|Dromaeosaurids <b>are</b> <b>diagnosed</b> by the {{following}} features; short T-shaped frontals that form the rostral boundary of the supratemporal fenestra; a caudolateral overhanging shelf of the squamosal; a lateral process of the quadrate that contacts the quadratojugal; raised, stalked, parapophyses on the dorsal vertebrae, a modified pedal digit II; chevrons and prezygapophysis of the caudal vertebrae elongate and spanning several vertebrae; {{the presence of a}} subglenoid fossa on the coracoid.|$|E
5|$|About 5% of {{all people}} <b>are</b> <b>diagnosed</b> only when they develop fulminant acute liver failure, often {{in the context of}} a {{hemolytic}} anemia (anemia due to the destruction of red blood cells). This leads to abnormalities in protein production (identified by deranged coagulation) and metabolism by the liver. The deranged protein metabolism leads to the accumulation of waste products such as ammonia in the bloodstream. When these irritate the brain, the person develops hepatic encephalopathy (confusion, coma, seizures and finally life-threatening swelling of the brain).|$|E

5|$|Globally, {{autism is}} {{estimated}} to affect 24.8 million people as of 2015. As of 2010, {{the number of people}} affected is estimated at about 1–2 per 1,000 worldwide. It occurs four to five times more often in boys than girls. About 1.5% of children in the United States (one in 68) <b>are</b> <b>diagnosed</b> with ASD , a 30% increase from one in 88 in 2012. The rate of autism among adults aged 18 years and over in the United Kingdom is 1.1%. The number of people diagnosed has been increasing dramatically since the 1980s, partly due to changes in diagnostic practice; the question of whether actual rates have increased is unresolved.|$|E
5|$|Head pain {{occurs in}} 50–75% {{of all cases}} of {{vertebral}} artery dissection. It tends to be located {{at the back of}} the head, either on the affected side or in the middle, and develops gradually. It is either dull or pressure-like in character or throbbing. About half of those with VAD consider the headache distinct, while the remainder have had a similar headache before. It is suspected that VAD with headache as the only symptom is fairly common; 8% of all cases of vertebral and carotid dissection <b>are</b> <b>diagnosed</b> on the basis of pain alone.|$|E
5|$|People over 20 {{years of}} age with Birt–Hogg–Dubé {{syndrome}} have {{an increased risk of}} developing slow-growing kidney tumors (chromophobe renal carcinoma and renal oncocytoma, respectively), kidney cysts, and possibly tumors in other organs and tissues. These tumors often occur in both kidneys and in multiple locations in each kidney. The average number of kidney tumors found in a person with BHD is 5.3, though up to 28 tumors have been found. Hybrid oncocytoma/chromophobe carcinoma, found in 50% of cases, is the most commonly found cancer, followed by chromophobe renal carcinoma, clear cell renal carcinoma, renal oncocytoma, and papillary renal cell carcinoma. People over 40 years old and men are more likely to develop kidney tumors, which <b>are</b> <b>diagnosed</b> at a median age of 48. Kidney cancer associated with BHD have been diagnosed in people at ages as young as 20.|$|E

5|$|Several {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that the condition in most children improves with maturity. Tics may be at their highest severity at the time that they <b>are</b> <b>diagnosed,</b> and often improve with understanding of the condition by individuals and their families and friends. The statistical age of highest tic severity is typically between eight and twelve, with most individuals experiencing steadily declining tic severity as they pass through adolescence. One study showed no correlation with tic severity and the onset of puberty, in contrast with the popular belief that tics increase at puberty. In many cases, a complete remission of tic symptoms occurs after adolescence. However, a study using videotape to record tics in adults found that, although tics diminished in comparison with childhood, and all measures of tic severity improved by adulthood, 90% of adults still had tics. Half of the adults who considered themselves tic-free still displayed evidence of tics.|$|E
5|$|The {{new edition}} of the Tiger Woods PGA Tour series of video games {{incorporates}} elements of the alleged physical altercations Woods had with his wife regarding his extramarital affairs, and resembles a fighting game more than a golf simulation. Cartman, Stan, Kyle and Kenny become big fans of the game. Meanwhile, scientists at the Center for Disease Control determine that sex addiction is a disease reaching epidemic proportions. They decide to screen schoolchildren for the disease, and Kenny, Kyle, and Butters <b>are</b> <b>diagnosed</b> as sex addicts. Kenny is killed after attempting autoerotic asphyxiation while in a Batman suit, while Kyle and Butters are sent to attend a therapy session for sex addicts consisting of Michael Douglas, Michael Jordan, Ben Roethlisberger, David Duchovny, Charlie Sheen, David Letterman, Bill Clinton, Billy Bob Thornton, Kobe Bryant, Eliot Spitzer, and Tiger Woods.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{requirement}} that other comorbid conditions (such as ADHD or OCD) be present, {{but if a}} physician believes {{that there may be}} another condition present that could explain tics, tests may be ordered as necessary to rule out that condition. An example of this is when diagnostic confusion between tics and seizure activity exists, which would call for an EEG, or if there are symptoms that indicate an MRI to rule out brain abnormalities. TSH levels can be measured to rule out hypothyroidism, which can be a cause of tics. Brain imaging studies are not usually warranted. In teenagers and adults presenting with a sudden onset of tics and other behavioral symptoms, a urine drug screen for cocaine and stimulants might be necessary. If a family history of liver disease is present, serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels can rule out Wilson's disease. Most cases <b>are</b> <b>diagnosed</b> by merely observing a history of tics.|$|E

40|$|This {{study had}} been planned to see the histomorphological pattern of gastric mucosal biopsy, {{demonstrate}} the organism H. Pylori and correlate with endoscopic findings. The study {{was carried out in}} the department of the Pathology Rajshahi Medical College, Rajshahi, Bangladesh, during the period from January 2006 to December 2007. Endoscopic biopsy specimens were obtained from 105 cases of gastro duodenal lesions.

40|$|Background. Urinalysis is {{a poorly}} {{reviewed}} diagnostic tool in malaria patients; its application {{can show the}} presence of severe malaria. Methods. Urinalysis was performed {{in a total of}} 620 patients diagnosed with malaria by thick blood smear; complications were classified according to WHO major criteria for severity and minor criteria according to the Colombian malaria guideline. Results. Severe or moderate clinical complications <b>were</b> <b>diagnosed</b> in 31. 1 % of patients, hepatic dysfunctions <b>were</b> <b>diagnosed</b> in 25. 8 %, anemia <b>was</b> <b>diagnosed</b> in 9. 8 %, thrombocytopenia <b>was</b> <b>diagnosed</b> in 7. 7 %, renal dysfunction <b>was</b> <b>diagnosed</b> in 4. 8 %, neurological and pulmonary complications <b>were</b> <b>diagnosed</b> in 2. 1 % and 2. 4 %, hypoglycemia <b>was</b> <b>diagnosed</b> in 1. 1 % of patients with blood glucose analysis, and acidosis <b>was</b> <b>diagnosed</b> in 10 of 25. Bilirubinuria was found in 24. 3 %, associated with urobilinuria, proteinuria, and increased specific gravity; urobilinuria was found in 30. 6 % associated with elevated serum bilirubin and alanine aminotransferase; 39. 2 % had proteinuria, associated with higher blood urea nitrogen, serum bilirubin, aspartate, alanine-transaminase, hematuria, and increased specific gravity. Severe or moderate liver and renal complications were associated with proteinuria and bilirubinuria. Urobilinuria was associated with thrombocytopenia and neurological and hepatic dysfunction. Ketonuria was associated with neurological dysfunctions. Conclusions. The most frequent alterations in the urinalysis were bilirubinuria, proteinuria, urobilinuria, and increased specific gravity, related to thrombocytopenia and liver, kidney, and neurological alterations...|$|R
