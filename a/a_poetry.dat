5|$|Riley's poetry {{had become}} popular in Britain, {{in large part}} due to his book Old-Fashioned Roses.

He then traveled to Edinburgh, York, and London, reciting poetry for gatherings at each stop. Augustin Daly arranged for him to give <b>a</b> <b>poetry</b> reading to prominent British actors in London.
