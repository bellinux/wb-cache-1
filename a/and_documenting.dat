5|$|Merian Caldwell Cooper (October 24, 1893 – April 21, 1973) was an American aviator, United States Air Force and Polish Air Force officer, adventurer, screenwriter, film director, and producer. Cooper was {{the founder}} of the Kościuszko Squadron during the Polish–Soviet War and was a Soviet {{prisoner}} of war for a time. He was a notable movie producer, and got his start with film as part of the Explorers Club, traveling the world <b>and</b> <b>documenting</b> adventures. He {{was a member of the}} board of directors of Pan American Airways, but his love of film always took priority. During his film career, he worked for companies such as Pioneer Pictures, RKO Pictures, and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. He is also credited as co-inventor of the Cinerama film projection process. Cooper's most famous film was the 1933 movie King Kong. He was awarded an honorary Oscar for lifetime achievement in 1952 and received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} museums in England, {{but perhaps the}} most notable is London's British Museum. Its {{collection}} of more than seven million objects {{is one of the largest}} and most comprehensive in the world, sourced from every continent, illustrating <b>and</b> <b>documenting</b> the story of human culture from its beginning to the present. The British Library in London is the national library and is one of the world's largest research libraries, holding over 150million items in all known languages and formats; including around 25million books. The most senior art gallery is the National Gallery in Trafalgar Square, which houses a collection of over 2,300 paintings dating from the mid-13th century to 1900. The Tate galleries house the national collections of British and international modern art; they also host the famously controversial Turner Prize.|$|E

40|$|The claimed {{advantage}} of describing a document data set with a bipartite graph is that partitioning such a graph yields a co-clustering of words <b>and</b> <b>documents.</b> The topic of each cluster {{can then be}} represented by the top words <b>and</b> <b>documents</b> that have highest withincluster degrees. However, such claims may fail if top words <b>and</b> <b>documents</b> are selected {{simply because they are}} very general and frequent. In addition, for those words <b>and</b> <b>documents</b> across several topics, it may not be proper to assign them to a single cluster. To that end, this paper introduces a new bipartite formulation that incorporates both word hypercliques <b>and</b> <b>document</b> hypercliques as super vertices. By copreserving hyperclique patterns during the clustering process, our experiments on real-world data sets show that better clustering results can be obtained and the cluster topic can be more precisely identified. Also, we illustrate an application of the partitioned bipartite to search engines, returning clustered search results for keyword queries. We show that the topic of each cluster with respect to the current query can be identified more accurately with the words <b>and</b> <b>documents</b> from the patterns than with those top ones from the standard bipartite formulation...|$|R
