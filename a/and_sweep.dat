5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{surrender}} of Oribe, the Allied forces split into two groups, the plan being for one force to maneuver upriver <b>and</b> <b>sweep</b> down on Buenos Aires from Santa Fe, while the other would make a landing {{at the port of}} Buenos Aires itself. The first of these groups, was composed of Uruguayan and Argentine troops, along with the 1st Division of the Brazilian Army under Brigadier General Manuel Marques de Sousa (later the Count of Porto Alegre). It was initially based in the town of Colonia del Sacramento in the south of Uruguay across the Río de la Plata estuary from the city of Buenos Aires.|$|E
5|$|Ironically, the {{original}} specimen {{was of the}} black-plumaged subspecies from Dirk Hartog Island, which was not recorded again for 80years. Meanwhile, the widespread blue-plumaged subspecies was discovered and described as two separate species by John Gould in 1865. He called one specimen collected from inland New South Wales the white-winged superb warbler, M. cyanotus, while another, which appeared to have a white back and wings, was described as M. leuconotus, the white-backed superb warbler. It {{was not until the}} early 20th century that both of these blue-plumaged mainland forms were found to be of a single species. George Mack, ornithologist of the National Museum of Victoria, considered the specific name leuconotus to take precedence in his 1934 revision of the genus, and more recent studies have followed suit. The back region between the shoulders is in fact bare, with feathers that arise from the shoulder (scapular) region <b>and</b> <b>sweep</b> inwards in different patterns. This variation confused the early naturalists who described the white-backed and blue-backed species.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} evaluates whether lifting the trawl doors <b>and</b> <b>sweeps</b> from the seabed can reduce bycatch in shrimp trawl fisheries. We {{carried out a}} catch {{comparison}} and catch ratio analysis between two gear setups, one with the trawl doors <b>and</b> <b>sweeps</b> at the seabed (the traditional way) {{and the other with}} the doors <b>and</b> <b>sweeps</b> lifted. The study was carried out on American plaice. The results showed that when fishing with the doors <b>and</b> <b>sweeps</b> at the seabed, the gear is significantly more efficient at catching flatfish. The gear setup with the doors <b>and</b> <b>sweeps</b> at the seabed captures between 50 % and 70 % more American plaice than the gear setup with the doors <b>and</b> <b>sweeps</b> lifted. This difference is significant for sizes between 10 and 36 cm. Further, this efficiency is size dependent and increases with fish size. The results obtained are encouraging for the shrimp fishing industry as lifting the doors <b>and</b> <b>sweeps</b> from the seabed could help mitigate fish bycatch problems, and reduce bottom impact. Further studies are recommended to investigate if lifting the doors <b>and</b> <b>sweeps</b> from the seabed is equally efficient at reducing bycatch of other species, and if it also affects the shrimp catches...|$|R

5|$|The French Navy had {{suffered}} a series of one-sided defeats in the opening years of the war, suffering heavy losses at the Glorious First of June in 1794 and during the Croisière du Grand Hiver the following January. In late 1796, after prompting from representatives of the United Irishmen (a society dedicated to ending British rule of the Kingdom of Ireland), the French Atlantic Fleet launched a large scale attempt to invade Ireland, known as the Expédition d'Irlande. This too ended in disaster, with twelve ships lost and thousands of men drowned in fierce winter gales. Their ambitions frustrated, {{the representatives of the}} United Irishmen, led by Wolfe Tone, turned to the new Batavian state for support and were promised assistance in the coming year by a united French and Dutch fleet. A plan was formulated to merge the French and Dutch fleets and attack Ireland together in the summer of 1797. Tone joined the staff of Vice-Admiral Jan de Winter on his flagship Vrijheid in the Texel and 13,500 Dutch troops were equipped in preparation for the operation, the fleet waiting only for the best moment to take advantage of easterly winds <b>and</b> <b>sweep</b> past the British blockade and down the English Channel.|$|E

25|$|Satriani is {{considered}} a highly technical guitarist, and {{has been referred to}} as a top guitar virtuoso. Satriani has mastered many performance techniques on electric guitar, including legato, two-handed tapping and arpeggio tapping, volume swells, harmonics and extreme whammy bar effects. During fast passages, Satriani favors a legato technique (achieved primarily through hammer-ons and pull-offs) that yields smooth and flowing runs. He is also adept at other speed-related techniques such as rapid alternate picking <b>and</b> <b>sweep</b> picking. Satriani was influenced by blues-rock guitar icons such as Jimi Hendrix, Brian May, Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page, Ritchie Blackmore and Jeff Beck, as well as jazz fusion guitarist Allan Holdsworth.|$|E
25|$|Anderson throws four pitches for strikes: a fastball, a curve, a changeup and a slider. His fastball {{sits in the}} 89-92mph {{range and}} he offers a two-seam variety in {{addition}} to the traditional four-seam version. His best pitch is the slider, a two-plane breaking ball he can paint on the corner versus right-handed batters <b>and</b> <b>sweep</b> away from lefties in the 79-81mph range. His low-to-mid 70s curveball is a weapon in any count and his 82-84mph changeup has shown the most improvement as Anderson has fought his way through injuries. Over the course of his career, Anderson's arm slot has lowered slightly, dropping from high three-quarters to true three-quarters. He's athletic and repeats his mechanics, aiding in his ability to command his entire arsenal.|$|E

As a token of appreciation, Skyler lets him see his children one last time. He then arranges to see Lydia, secretly poisoning her with ricin after learning where Jack has taken Jesse. Walt drives to Jack's compound and demands to see Jesse. When they bring Jesse, who has been chained up in a lab and forced to cook meth since his abduction, Walt dives atop him while simultaneously starting a remote machine gun mounted in his car that kills most of Jack's men. Walt and Jesse kill Jack and Todd. Walt urges Jesse to kill him, but Jesse notices Walt had been shot by his own trap and tells him to do it himself. Walt then finds that he has been fatally wounded. He answers a call from Lydia on Todd's phone and coldly informs her that she is going to die. He exchanges a knowing nod with Jesse, who escapes the compound. Walt takes a moment to admire the lab equipment that Jesse had been using, and finally succumbs to his wounds and collapses dead on the floor as the police arrive <b>and</b> <b>sweep</b> the lab.|$|E

25|$|After {{two days}} rest, Paige started game three, which was played in Yankee Stadium. Paige gave up two {{runs in the}} first and was pulled after two innings. Matchett pitched the {{remainder}} of the game, which the Monarchs won, 9–3, giving them a 3–0 lead in the series. The next series game was played a week later in Kansas City. When the injury-plagued Grays brought in star players from other teams, including pitcher Leon Day, second baseman Lenny Pearson, and outfielder Ed Stone of the Newark Eagles and shortstop Bus Clarkson of the Philadelphia Stars, the Monarchs played under protest. Day and Paige both pitched complete games, with Paige giving up four runs on eight hits and Day giving up one run on five hits for a Grays victory. The Monarchs' protest was upheld and the game was disallowed. Game four took place in Shibe Park in Philadelphia, and Paige was scheduled to start, but he did not show up until the fourth inning. According to his autobiography, Paige was delayed in Lancaster, Pennsylvania by an arrest for speeding. The Grays had taken a 5–4 lead, and Paige immediately entered the game. In the remainder of the game, he did not allow a hit or a run and struck out six, while the Monarchs' hitters scored two runs in the seventh to take the lead and three more in the eighth to win, 9–5, <b>and</b> <b>sweep</b> the series. Paige had pitched in all four official games in the Series (as well as one unofficial one), going 16 innings, striking out 18, and giving up eight hits and six runs.|$|E
