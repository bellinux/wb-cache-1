The former Taoiseach said that the availability of cheap credit through Ireland's involvement in the eurozone created “a huge problem”. “Anyone could walk into any institution and seem to get any amount of money {{and this is where}} the cocky bit came in. “Unfortunately… Joe Soap and Mary Soap, who never had a lot, got the loans for the second house and leveraged the third house off the second house and the fourth on the third, and you know, what <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>having</b> yourself.” People, among them those who had previously regarded the former Taoiseach highly, took to social media and the airwaves to criticise Ahern for his remarks.|$|E
500|$|By {{the summer}} of 1993, it was {{revealed}} that Jackson had children sleep over in his bed with him at his Neverland ranch, a fact which came under much media scrutiny when child sexual abuse allegations were brought against him. Jackson became firm friends with Jordan Chandler and his family after a meeting in May 1992, as he was a fan of Jackson. Their friendship became so close that the National Enquirer ran a featured story with the title [...] "Michael's New Adopted Family", which implied that Jackson had [...] "stolen" [...] the boy from his estranged father, Evan Chandler, a dentist, who was admittedly jealous over Jackson's influence on his son. According to celebrity biographer, J. Randy Taraborrelli, Chandler asked, [...] "Look, <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>having</b> sex with my son?" [...] and after Jackson denied doing so, Chandler's opinion of Jackson changed. [...] Jackson invited Jordan, his stepsister and his mother to visit Neverland on the weekends and they would also take trips to Las Vegas and Florida. These weekend trips began to interfere with Jordan's scheduled visits with his father, with Jordan preferring to visit Neverland. In May 1993, when Jackson and Jordan stayed with Chandler, he urged Jackson {{to spend more time with}} his son at his house and even suggested that Jackson build an addition onto the house so that Jackson could stay there. After the zoning department told Chandler it could not be done, he suggested that Jackson just build him a new home. That same month, Jordan and June flew with Jackson to Monaco for the World Music Awards. According to June's lawyer, Michael Freeman, [...] "Evan began to get jealous of the involvement and felt left out." [...] Upon their return, Chandler was pleased with a five-day visit from Jackson, during which Jackson slept in a room with Jordan and his stepbrother. Chandler claimed this was when his suspicions of sexual misconduct by Jackson began, although he admitted that Jackson and Jordan always had their clothes on when he saw them in bed together and has never claimed to have witnessed any sexual misconduct between the two.|$|E

40|$|How {{teachers}} in the classroom can recognize their own stress level and develop a repertoire of coping strategies. L/o you often feel overworked and underpaid? Do you feel alien-ated from the school in which you teach, from your colleagues, or from the administration? <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>having</b> trouble dealing with discipline problems, with students ' special needs, or with paper-work? Are you overly exhausted, irritable, or depressed {{at the end of}} a school day? Do you frequently miss school because of minor illnesses, such as colds or flu? If your answer to one or more of these questions is "yes," you are a teacher under stress, and you may be a candidate for burnout. But you are not alone. A recent Harris poll of {{teachers in}} the United States predicted that one-fourth would leave teaching by 1990 ("One-Fourth, " 1985); the Carnegie Forum on Educa-tion and the Economy (Task Force on Teaching as a Profession, 1986) increased that estimate to 50 % by 1992. This means that in less than a decade, more than 1 million public school teachers —the majority of whom are sincerely dedicated to teaching (McLaughlin, Pfeifer, Swanson-Owens, & Yee, 1986) —will have left the profession in the United States alone. Moreover, teacher stress and burnout in the United States and Canada may cost as much as $ 3. 5 billion annually in absenteeism, turnover, and poor job performance (Truch, 1980) ...|$|E
