30|$|Fifth, peritonitis, {{urinary tract}} {{infection}} and <b>angiocholitis</b> are the main causes of sepsis recruitment in our surgical ICU, which {{is quite different from}} other ICUs and especially medical ICUs, which may explain some differences. The ability of HDL to bind and promote LPS clearance in cases of infection by gram-negative pathogens may also impact our results because our sepsis population involved more gram-negative pathogens.|$|E
40|$|SummaryThere are {{no reports}} of {{hepatocellular}} carcinoma complicating postradiotherapy cholangitis. We report {{the case of a}} 45 -year-old patient who had undergone upper abdominal radiotherapy for Hodgkin 2 ̆ 7 s disease, 21  years before, which was complicated years later by cholangitis with stricture of the common bile duct. Biliodigestive anastomosic surgery was scheduled due to recurrent <b>angiocholitis,</b> and hepatocellular carcinoma was discovered. The patient died from carcinoma some months later...|$|E
40|$|A 65 {{year old}} patient {{presents}} {{himself to the}} Emergency Room with general physical alteration, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. After a thorough medical exam and workup, two hypotheses are retained; secondary dyslipidemia due to a non insulin dependent diabetes, and <b>angiocholitis.</b> The presentation of this case report is to stress the following two messages: 1) major hypertriglyceridemia, {{to the point of}} rendering the blood lactescent, can be secondary and transitional; 2) hypertriglyceridemia of this importance can render the evaluation of blood samples difficult.

40|$|Present day {{increasing}} {{dependence on}} electricity, in both {{home and work}} environments, can lead, if the necessary precautions are not met, to a wide type of injuries, from cutaneous burns to important visceral lesions. We report {{the case of a}} 44 year-old male with cutaneous and severe visceral lesions, paresis and paresthesia of the right upper limb induced by a high energy electrical shock. No psychiatric manifestations were observed. This case followed an unusual course due to the particular evolution of the hepatic lesions, which included necrosis, abscesses, thrombosis and <b>angiocholitis...</b>|$|E
40|$|Despite {{advances}} {{in the management of}} autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease over the past two decades, infection of liver and kidney cysts remains a serious and potentially threatening complication. Kidney cyst infection is the most frequent complication. It is differentiated from hemorrhage by the clinical presentation (mainly the severity and duration of fever), C-reactive protein (CRP) and white blood cells levels, and the density of the suspected cyst on computed tomography. Liver cyst infection occurs more frequently in patients with large cysts volumes. It can be life threatening and has a tendency to recur. In both infections, the best radiological imaging technique is positron emission tomography after intravenous injection of [18 F]-fluorodeoxyglucose combined with computed tomography. Treatment with a fluoroquinolone should be continued for 6 weeks. Cyst aspiration is necessary only when cysts are very large and/or when infection is resistant to antibiotic treatment. In patients who are candidates to kidney transplantation, a history of recurrent kidney cyst infection justifies pre-transplant nephrectomy, while a past history of recurrent liver cyst infection or <b>angiocholitis</b> leads to consider liver transplantation. Among extrarenal and extrahepatic complications of polycystic disease, colic diverticulosis is reported to be associated with increased risk of infection in patients on hemodialysis and after kidney transplantation. However, this observation needs to be confirmed...|$|E
40|$|International audienceBackground and objectives. In {{contrast}} to the improvement {{in our understanding of}} the pathogenesis and presentation of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD), data regarding the issue of kidney and liver transplantation in patients with ARPKD remain particularly scarce. Here, we report the results and outcome of renal and/or liver transplantation in a series of patients with ARPKD. Methods. Fourteen ARPKD patients (age: 3 - 25 years) who underwent renal transplantation with or without liver transplantation were retrospectively identified in five French nephrology departments. The patients' medical charts were reviewed and relevant data were collected. Results. The clinical and radiological presentation of the 14 patients was highly variable illustrating the heterogeneity of ARPKD. Six patients underwent kidney and/or liver transplantation in adulthood. First renal graft survival was 92, 78 and 14 % at 1, 5 and 10 years after renal transplantation, respectively. Mortality rate was relatively high (3 / 14; 21 %) in these young patients and was directly related to infectious complications (recurrent <b>angiocholitis)</b> of severe Caroli's disease (dilatation of intra- and/or extra-hepatic bile ducts), a typical feature of ARPKD. Conclusions. Our data suggest that ARPKD patients evaluated for renal transplantation should be carefully screened for severe Caroli's disease. Even though the limited number of patients included in our study precludes any definite recommendation, pre-emptive liver transplantation may be a therapeutic option in ARPKD patients with severe Caroli's disease evaluated for renal transplantation...|$|E
40|$|We report our {{experience}} {{in the management of}} children after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). From 03 / 84 to 04 / 87 50 patients (pts) were transplanted. Mean age was 4 3 / 12 years (8 / 12 to 13 2 / 12) and mean body weight 14. 7 kg (5. 8 to 40). Hospital mortality was 14 %. Problems related to the surgery included: Abdominal complications: bleeding (8 pts), infection (18 pts), ascites and fistula (1 pt), need for secondary abdominal surgery (10 patients). Respiratory problems: lobar atelectasis (11 pts), right diaphragmatic paralysis (2 pts) and right pleural effusion (11 pts). Problems related to immunosuppression included: Bacterial infection (29 pts) fungal infection (5 pts), one patient died of disseminated cytomegalovirus infection. Side effect of cyclosporin A (CsA) were systemic blood hypertension (S. B. H.) (47 pts), sinusal bradycardia (37 pts), associated to SBH (24 pts), hypertensive encephalopathy (2 pts). Generalized seizures (2 pts in the absence of SBH). Renal side effects of CsA were hypercreatininemia, decreased sodium bicarbonate and hyperkaliemia. The nephrotoxicity of CsA was favoured by the use of other nephrotoxic drugs such as aminoglycosides, amphotericin B. Edematous pancreatitis was observed in 3 patients and related to the use of large doses of steroids. Problems related to the functioning of the graft included: Primary non-function of the graft (4 pts), hepatic artery thrombosis (8 pts) and severe acute rejection unresponsive to therapy (1 pt); these situations needed to be recognised early in order to organize a second OLT. Other causes of hepatic dysfunction were: portal vein thrombosis (1 pt), biliary tract obstruction (2 pts), <b>angiocholitis</b> (3 pts), right hepatic lobe necrosis (2 pts). Acute hepatic insufficiency in 7 children. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|E
