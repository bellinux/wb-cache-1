5|$|During his campaign, Trajan {{was granted}} the title Parthicus by the Senate and coins were minted proclaiming {{the conquest of}} Parthia. However, only the 4th-century AD historians Eutropius and Festus <b>allege</b> <b>that</b> he {{attempted}} to establish a Roman province in lower Mesopotamia.|$|E
5|$|At {{various times}} during the program, NASA {{managers}} and personnel found themselves limited in terms of resources and manpower, particularly as Phase Two geared up, and {{had a hard time}} getting anywhere with NASA administration. One particular area of contention was with crew assignments to missions. Many astronauts <b>allege</b> <b>that</b> the method of selection prevented the most skilled people from performing roles they were best-suited for.|$|E
50|$|Israeli writer Amos Harel in Haaretz <b>alleged</b> <b>that</b> {{during the}} Second Intifada (2000-2005) Palestinian gunmen {{routinely}} used civilians and children {{as human shields}} and further <b>alleges</b> <b>that</b> there is photographic evidence.|$|R

5|$|Metro relies {{extensively}} on passenger fares and appropriated financing from the Maryland, Virginia, and Washington D.C. governments, which are represented on Metro's board of directors. The {{system does not}} have a dedicated revenue stream as other cities' mass transit systems do. Critics <b>allege</b> <b>that</b> this has contributed to Metro's recent history of maintenance and safety problems.|$|E
5|$|Other common {{objections}} to evolution <b>allege</b> <b>that</b> evolution leads to objectionable results, including bad beliefs, behaviors, and events. It {{is argued that}} {{the teaching of evolution}} degrades values, undermines morals, and fosters irreligion or atheism. These may be considered appeals to consequences (a form of logical fallacy), as the potential ramifications of belief in evolutionary theory {{have nothing to do with}} its objective empirical reality.|$|E
5|$|Bryan urged {{a system}} of bank guarantees, so that depositors could be repaid if banks failed, but Taft opposed this, {{offering}} a postal savings system instead. The issue of prohibition of alcohol entered the campaign when in mid-September, Carrie Nation called on Taft and demanded to know his views. Taft and Roosevelt had agreed the party platform would take no position on the matter, and Nation left indignant, to <b>allege</b> <b>that</b> Taft was irreligious and against temperance. Taft, at Roosevelt's advice, ignored the issue.|$|E

5|$|Drusus died {{suddenly}} 14 September 23, seemingly from natural causes. Ancient historians, such as Tacitus and Suetonius, claim he died amid a feud with the powerful Sejanus, Praetorian prefect of Rome. They <b>allege</b> <b>that</b> {{he had been}} murdered. In their account, Sejanus had seduced his wife Livilla, {{and with the help}} of a doctor she had poisoned Drusus. Despite the rumors, Tiberius did not suspect Sejanus and the two remained friends until Sejanus' fall from grace in 31.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his capture}} in 1071, he was imprisoned. This incarceration lasted until 1087, when a guilt-ridden King William, in {{expectation}} {{of his own}} death, ordered Siward's release. Firm evidence of Siward's later life is non-existent, but some historians have argued that he took up {{a career in the}} Varangian Guard at Constantinople, {{in the service of the}} Emperor Alexios I Komnenos. The sources upon which this theory is based also <b>allege</b> <b>that</b> Siward led a party of English colonists to the Black Sea, who renamed their conquered territory New England.|$|E
5|$|Sixty cavalrymen of the Manchester and Salford Yeomanry, led by Captain Hugh Hornby Birley, a local factory owner, {{arrived at}} the house from where the magistrates were watching; some reports <b>allege</b> <b>that</b> they were drunk.

5|$|Some protesters, {{commentators}} such as Libération correspondent Jean Quatremer and the Liège-based NGO Committee for the Abolition of the Third World Debt (CADTM) <b>allege</b> <b>that</b> {{the debt}} should be characterised as odious debt. The Greek documentary Debtocracy, {{and a book}} of the same title and content examine whether the recent Siemens scandal and uncommercial ECB loans which were conditional on the purchase of military aircraft and submarines are evidence that the loans amount to odious debt and that an audit would result in invalidation of {{a large amount of}} the debt.|$|E
5|$|A copy of {{the film}} leaked onto {{peer-to-peer}} file sharing networks just hours after opening in theaters. The film was a time-stamped workprint, suggesting it {{may have come from}} within the industry rather than from someone who videotaped an advance screening. Eight people were later charged with copyright infringement and distributing material illegally. Documents filed by the Los Angeles District Attorney <b>allege</b> <b>that</b> a {{copy of the}} film was taken from an unnamed Californian post-production office by an employee, who later pleaded guilty to his charges. The illegal copy was passed among seven people until reaching an eighth party, who also pleaded guilty to uploading to an unnamed P2P network.|$|E
5|$|Domitian also {{revived the}} {{practice}} of the imperial cult, which had fallen somewhat out of use under Vespasian. Significantly, his first act as an Emperor was the deification of his brother Titus. Upon their deaths, his infant son, and niece, Julia Flavia, were likewise enrolled among the gods. With regards to the emperor himself as a religious figure, both Suetonius and Cassius Dio <b>allege</b> <b>that</b> Domitian officially gave himself the title of Dominus et Deus. However, not only did he reject the title of Dominus during his reign, but since he issued no official documentation or coinage to this effect, historians such as Brian Jones contend that such phrases were addressed to Domitian by flatterers who wished to earn favors from the emperor.|$|E
50|$|Two {{charges were}} laid against each defendant. The first <b>alleged</b> <b>that</b> the loan {{proposal}} would have contravened the Commonwealth-State Financial Agreement of 1928.

5|$|Moreover, Wang was {{privy to}} details of Neil Heywood's death, and had {{reportedly}} attempted to voice his concerns to Bo about alleged poisoning. Around 16 January, Wang {{is believed to}} have confronted Bo over evidence that implicated Bo's wife in the murder. Although Bo initially agreed to allow an inquiry, he then changed course and sought to obstruct investigations. Wang was abruptly demoted on 2 February to the far less prestigious position of Vice-mayor overseeing education, science, and environmental affairs. Bo placed Wang under surveillance, and several of his close associates were reportedly taken into custody. Some reports <b>allege</b> <b>that</b> Bo may have been plotting to have Wang assassinated.|$|E
5|$|Some historians <b>allege</b> <b>that</b> Jinnah's courting {{the rulers}} of Hindu-majority states and his gambit with Junagadh are {{evidence}} of ill-intent towards India, as Jinnah had promoted separation by religion, yet tried to gain the accession of Hindu-majority states. In his book Patel: A Life, Rajmohan Gandhi asserts that Jinnah hoped for a plebiscite in Junagadh, knowing Pakistan would lose, in the hope the principle would be established for Kashmir. However, when Mountbatten proposed to Jinnah that, in all the princely States where the ruler did not accede to a Dominion corresponding to the majority population (which would have included Junagadh, Hyderabad and Kashmir), the accession should be decided by an 'impartial reference {{to the will of}} the people', Jinnah rejected the offer.|$|E
5|$|During the {{genocide}} {{and in the}} months following the RPF victory, RPF soldiers killed many people they accused of participating in or supporting {{the genocide}}. Many of these soldiers were recent Tutsi recruits from within Rwanda who had lost family or friends and sought revenge. The scale, scope, and source of ultimate responsibility of these killings is disputed. Human Rights Watch, as well as scholars such as Prunier, <b>allege</b> <b>that</b> the death toll might be as high as 100,000, and that Kagame and the RPF elite either tolerated or organised the killings. In an interview with journalist Stephen Kinzer, Kagame acknowledged that killings had occurred but stated that they were carried out by rogue soldiers and had been impossible to control. The RPF killings gained international attention with the 1995 Kibeho massacre, in which soldiers opened fire on a camp for internally displaced persons in Butare Province. Australian soldiers serving as part of UNAMIR estimated at least 4,000 people were killed, while the Rwandan government claimed that the death toll was 338.|$|E

5|$|Lam Wing-kee (林榮基, age 60), {{the founder}} of Causeway Bay Books, has been missing since 24 October 2015. He habitually spent long hours at the {{bookshop}} and occasionally slept there. His wife filed a missing persons report with the police on 5 November and his family received {{a telephone call from}} him several hours later; he refused to reveal his whereabouts. When filing the police report, they were referred to the Immigration Department, who said it was against privacy policy to reveal a person's records of entry and exit of Hong Kong without the subject's permission. However, legislator James To said this was a reasonable request that was exempt from privacy policy. Police followed up on his case once, asking whether they had heard from him. His family <b>allege</b> <b>that</b> upon learning that he had contacted his family, the officer who called them informed that the case would be closed as resolved.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} {{conspiracy}} theories {{have been proposed}} about the events surrounding the bombing. Some theories <b>allege</b> <b>that</b> individuals in the government, including President Bill Clinton, knew of the impending bombing and intentionally failed to act on that knowledge. Other theories focus on initial reports by local news stations of multiple other unexploded bombs within the building itself as evidence of remnants of a controlled demolition; following the attack, search and rescue operations at the site were delayed until the area had been declared safe by the Oklahoma City bomb squad and federal authorities. According to both a situation report compiled by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and a memo issued by the United States Atlantic Command the day following the attack, a second bomb located within the building was disarmed while a third was evacuated. Further theories focus on additional conspirators involved with the bombing. Additional theories claim the bombing {{was carried out by}} the government in order to frame the militia movement or to provide the impetus for new antiterrorism legislation while using McVeigh as a scapegoat. Other conspiracy theories suggest that foreign agents, particularly Islamic terrorists but also the Japanese government or German Neo-Nazis, were involved in the bombing. Experts have disputed the theories and government investigations have been opened at various times to look into the theories.|$|E
5|$|Chelvanayakam was re-elected in the 1965 {{parliamentary}} election {{which resulted in}} a hung parliament. After the election Chelvanayakam met with UNP leader Dudley Senanayake who agreed to Chelvanayakam's conditions for supporting a UNP led government. The agreement, known as the Dudley-Chelvanayakam Pact (D-C Pact), was put down on paper and signed by Chelvanayakam and Senanayake on 24 March 1965. Under the Dudley-Chelvanayakam Pact, which was {{a modified version of the}} B-C pact, Senanayake agreed to make Tamil the language of administration and of record in the Northern and Eastern provinces (Tamil Language Special Provisions Act); amend the Languages of Courts Act to allow legal proceedings in the Northern and Eastern provinces to be conducted and recorded in Tamil; establish District Councils vested with powers over mutually agreed subjects; amend the Land Development Ordinance to provide allotment of land to citizens; and grant land under colonization schemes in the Northern and Eastern provinces to landless people in the district, to Tamil-speaking residents from the two provinces, and to other citizens with preference being given to Tamils from other provinces. Senanayake kept the contents of the D-C Pact a secret which allowed Sinhalese nationalists to <b>allege</b> <b>that</b> he had agreed to the division of the country. Even the leftist Lanka Sama Samaja Party and Communist Party of Ceylon joined the Sinhala nationalist SLFP in propagating this claim.|$|E
