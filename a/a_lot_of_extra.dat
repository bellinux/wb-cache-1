5|$|Bayern is one {{of three}} {{professional}} football clubs in Munich. Bayern's main local rival is 1860 Munich, who were the more successful club in the 1960s, winning a cup and a championship. In the 1970s and 1980s, 1860 Munich moved between the first and the third division but lately, have settled in the second division. The Munich derby is still a much-anticipated event, getting <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>extra</b> attention from supporters of both clubs. 1860 Munich is considered more working-class, and therefore suffers from a diminishing fan base in a city where the manufacturing sector is declining. Bayern is considered the establishment club, which is reflected by many board members being business leaders and including the former Bavarian minister president, Edmund Stoiber. Despite the rivalry, Bayern has repeatedly supported 1860 in times of financial disarray.|$|E
5|$|Variety and realism were focuses for the tracks: they {{featured}} visuals such as forests, Neon Cities, and Canyons, {{complete with}} obstacles. The team travelled {{to photograph the}} textures. The tracks were constructed in Softimage 3D and converted to PlayStation format mesh data using a custom tool. In response to a common criticism of the original Destruction Derby, the tracks were designed to be larger and less narrow. The team were inspired by Daytonas revolving windmills, and large jumps were implemented to add drama to the tracks. The most realistic aspect of the race tracks was the pit stop, although Edmondson stated that he limited players to one stop because the team {{did not want to}} detract from the action and because a penalty system would have added <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>extra</b> work. Cars nearing destruction were designed to behave in a realistic and unpredicatable fashion through effects such as losing the bonnet (hood) and catching on fire.|$|E

[...] The Numbers writer C.S. Strowbridge positively received the season, praising the chemistry between the two leads and the character development of several of the main characters while noting that [...] "calling it crass would be an understatement." [...] Strowbridge concluded, [...] "the style of humor will turn off as many people as it entertains and that is an issue. I do think Season One got better as it went along and even though the DVD and the Blu-ray do not have <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>extras,</b> it is still worth picking up." [...] Todd Fuller of Sitcoms Online {{wrote that the}} series is [...] "an old fashioned sitcom like Laverne & Shirley and Alice. It works on many levels. The writing is a bit edgy and raunchy at times, but that's the trend in many comedies these days. Kat Dennings and Beth Behrs have great chemistry and comic timing together. The supporting cast at the diner is pretty funny in small doses. Jennifer Coolidge was also a welcome later addition to the cast." ...|$|R

After his previous film, Purple Violets, did not perform as hoped, Burns {{took the opportunity to}} re-educate himself on screenwriting. He recalled, [...] "I recognized after my film Purple Violets that I had gotten away from respecting traditional storytelling structure. I thought I knew it, but I stopped outlining and stopped thinking about audiences’ expectations. After that film I thought that I needed to go back and re-educate myself. So I went back and read a ton of books on Hollywood screenwriting and story structure. <b>A</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> it I found very helpful and <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> it I didn’t, but I know going back and having respect for structure helped me enormously as a screenwriter." [...] Knowing that Nice Guy Johnny would be a microbudget film (as were his following films, Newlyweds and The Fitzgerald Family Christmas), while writing the script Burns concentrated on how he could keep the cost of the film down. [...] " [...] With all three of those movies I would write down the list of locations that I knew I could get for free. I knew I would be writing more daytime exterior scenes than nighttime scenes just because of the cost of lighting and how time consuming and difficult shooting at night is with a micro-budget. I also knew I would be writing away from any scenes that would require <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>extras.</b> With those parameters I wrote the scripts. It was a different discipline." ...|$|R

60|$|Well, {{when that}} cargo arrived toward sunset, Saturday afternoon, I had my hands full {{to keep the}} Marcos from fainting. They were sure Jones and I were ruined past help, and they blamed {{themselves}} as accessories to this bankruptcy.

I instructed the Marcos to keep quiet about this sumptuousness, so as to {{give me a chance to}} surprise the guests and show off a little. Concerning the new clothes, the simple couple were like children; they were up and down, all night, to see if it wasn't nearly daylight, so that they could put them on, and they were into them at last as much as an hour before dawn was due. Then their pleasure--not to say delirium--was so fresh and novel and inspiring that the sight of it paid me well for the interruptions which my sleep had suffered. The king had slept just as usual--like the dead. The Marcos could not thank him for their clothes, that being forbidden; but they tried every way they could think of to make him see how grateful they were. Which all went for nothing: he didn't notice any change.|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} based on both written {{academic}} literature and Shona oral traditions. The paper looks at the conceptual framework, practice, {{and understanding of the}} muntu / munhu philosophy. The lateral translation of muntu / munhu is person. Conceptually the word goes deeper than this individualistic western worldview. Munhu is complex, multifaceted and generally understood at two levels; the lower and higher level. At lower level munhu means the physical body of a human being. At higher level munhu becomes the physical body and <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> other <b>extras.</b> This paper argues that the concept of munhu (humanity) is the foundation of life and the only key to stability and progress / development among Africans. Destroying the human body or even showing disrespect to that body is a punishable offence. Thus whether munhu is understood at lower (physical) or higher (spiritual plus) level, munhu is sacred and has to be treated with respect for progress, wellbeing and development of the humankind. If respected, munhu will contribute towards both personal and communal development. In fact, in Africa the personal is communal. 1...|$|R
