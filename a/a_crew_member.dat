5|$|September 3–8, 1915 – A Category 3 {{hurricane}} meanders {{around the}} islands for several days, {{during which time}} gale-force winds blow from nearly all directions.

Skinner wants to prosecute the creature and subject it to a psychiatric evaluation, which Mulder thinks would be difficult. Skinner tells Mulder of Craig's death and admits that this would have been an X-File had they still been open. Mulder raises his discontentment claiming that with X-Files, a certain pair of agents could have saved a life. Skinner simply responds saying everyone takes their orders from someone, implying the decision was not his and came from higher up the chain of command.|$|E

Bräck reclaimed the lead for the lap-163 restart, but lost it six laps later when <b>a</b> <b>crew</b> <b>member</b> dropped a wheel nut which cost him time. Franchitti took over the lead and held it {{for the remainder of the}} event to clinch the victory. It was Franchitti's third win of the season, his first on an oval track, and the tenth (and final) of his CART career.

He was awarded a British Empire Medal for gallantry in 1943 after an {{aircraft}} crashed into the Chipping Warden air base in Northamptonshire. Along with a squadron leader, Beric ran into the burning aircraft, without protective clothing, and saved the life of <b>a</b> <b>crew</b> <b>member</b> who was trapped inside.|$|E

5|$|Five days of filming {{were spent}} at the London Underground tunnels. Filming took place on actual tube tunnels, albeit disused ones. As the crew were {{scouting}} the disused Aldwych tunnels, they found the ex-Northern line 1972 stock train stabled in the tunnel for maintenance, training, and filming purposes. When Sam Miller called Cross about the development, the writer included it as a last minute addition to the script, and the sequence was shot the next day. As a way to scare the audience, Cross included a homeless woman living in the train. The filming crew present disliked filming the Underground sequences because while filmed during the summer, it became hot locations to work in. The crew were prohibited from bringing food or drink into the tunnels, as it would attract rats. Furthermore, break times had to be longer than usual because {{it would take a}} while for <b>a</b> <b>crew</b> <b>member</b> to leave the tunnels, have a break and then return. The FSB base was filmed in the London Docklands, near the ExCeL London.|$|E
5|$|In November 2003, Irwin was {{filming a}} {{documentary}} on sea lions {{off the coast of}} Baja California Peninsula in Mexico when he heard via his boat's radio that two scuba divers were reported missing in the area. Irwin and his entire crew suspended operations to aid in the search. His team's divers searched with the rescue divers, and Irwin used his vessel to patrol the waters around the island where the incident occurred, as well as using his satellite communications system to call in a rescue plane. On {{the second day of the}} search, kayakers found one of the divers, Scott Jones, perched on a narrow rock ledge jutting out from the side of a cliff. Irwin and <b>a</b> <b>crew</b> <b>member</b> escorted him to Irwin's boat. Jones did not recognise Irwin. The other lost diver, Katie Vrooman, was found dead by a search plane later the same day not far from Jones' location.|$|E
5|$|Joaquim Inácio's {{parents were}} José Vitorino de Barros and Maria Isabel de Barros. In 1808, the Portuguese Royal {{family moved to}} Brazil, then the largest and wealthiest colony of Portugal. Two years later, on 10 July 1810, José de Barros arrived in the Brazilian capital, Rio de Janeiro. As <b>a</b> <b>crew</b> <b>member</b> of the frigate D. Carlota, {{he was charged with}} {{transporting}} what remained of the personal property of Prince Regent Dom João, later King Dom JoãoVI to Brazil. José de Barros also brought his family on the voyage, including Joaquim Inácio, who was then one year and eight months old. Joaquim Inácio had an older sister named Maria and six younger siblings (who were born after the arrival in Brazil), among them Bento José de Carvalho and Antônio José Vitorino de Barros.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, actress Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) auditions {{for a role}} she {{believes}} is for a college freshman on Gossip Girl. At the audition, Jenna learns that she is actually booked to audition {{for the role of}} the college freshman's mother. She panics, believing that this is a sign that she is no longer young, and in an attempt to reclaim her youth, begins acting young which causes the TGS writing staff to mock her. At the same time, movie star Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) decides to add a woman to his entourage as a learning experience when he and his wife, Angie (Sherri Shepherd), have a daughter. He brings in the French-Dutch TGS writer Sue Laroche-Van der Hout (Sue Galloway). Tracy later loses his temper with <b>a</b> <b>crew</b> <b>member,</b> thinking that he made a suggestive comment about Sue, causing NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) to tell Tracy that he has become paternal towards Sue. Soon after, Sue begins rebelling against him, as Tracy treats her as a child.|$|E
5|$|The 48th Panzer Corps {{had fewer}} than 100 {{serviceable}} modern tanks to combat Soviet armor. Furthermore, they lacked fuel, and {{the shortage of}} tanks forced commanders to organize tank crews into infantry companies; the 22nd Panzer Division, which formed part of the corps, was almost completely destroyed in the fighting that ensued. The 22nd had entered the fighting with fewer than thirty working tanks, and left with a company of tanks. The Romanian 1st Armored Division, attached to the 48th Panzer Corps, engaged the Soviet 26th Tank Corps after having lost communications with their German corps commanders, and were defeated by 20 November. As the Soviets continued to advance southwards, many Soviet tank crews began to suffer from the worsening blizzard, which affected men and equipment, and blocked gunsights. It was not uncommon for tanks to lose traction on the ground, and for <b>a</b> <b>crew</b> <b>member</b> to have an arm broken as he was thrown around inside the hull. However, the blizzard also neutralized the German corps' coordination.|$|E
5|$|The makeup for the Trill host {{featured}} a separate nose and forehead pieces, as the {{intention was to}} retain the general look of a human. Air bladders were placed inside a fake abdomen to create the shot in which the symbiont appeared to move under the host's skin. A second fake abdomen was created for the surgery scene in which the symbiont is moved into Riker, which worked by having <b>a</b> <b>crew</b> <b>member</b> lie under the surgery table, pulling the symbiont into the opening using a concealed string. The design of the symbiont {{was based on a}} caterpillar with an octopus for a head, which {{featured a}} further air bladder in order to give the appearance that it was pulsating and painted in fluorescent paint to glow when a black light was shone on it during that scene.|$|E
