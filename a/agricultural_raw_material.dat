This paper investigates the volatility spillover between oil, food consumption item, and <b>agricultural</b> <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> price indexes for the period January 1980 to April 2008. The results of the Cheung-Ng procedure show that variation in oil prices does not Granger cause the variance in food and <b>agricultural</b> <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> prices. Since there is no volatility spillover from oil markets to food and <b>agricultural</b> <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> markets, investors can benefit from risk diversification.

40|$|Starch is an <b>agricultural</b> <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> {{used in many}} {{food and}} {{industrial}} products. It is present in granules that vary in shape {{in the form of}} amylose and amylopectin. Starch-degrading enzymes are used on a large scale in the production of sweeteners (high fructose corn syrup) and concentrated glucose syrups as substrate for the fermentative production of bioethanol and basic chemicals. Over the last two decades alpha-glucanotransferases (EC 2. 4. 1. xx), such as branching enzyme (EC 2. 4. 1. 18) and 4 -alpha-glucanotransferase (EC 2. 4. 1. 25), have received considerable attention. These enzymes do not hydrolyze the starch as amylases do. Instead, alpha-glucanotransferases remodel parts of the amylose and amylopectin molecules by cleaving and reforming alpha- 1, 4 - and alpha- 1, 6 -glycosidic bond. Here we review the properties of alpha-glucanotransferases and discuss the emerging use of these enzymes in the generation of novel starch derivatives. 0 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
