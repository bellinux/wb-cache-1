25|$|In March 1939, Ribbentrop {{assigned}} the largely ethnic Ukrainian Sub-Carpathian Ruthenia region of Czecho-Slovakia, which had just proclaimed its independence as the Republic of Carpatho-Ukraine, to Hungary, which {{then proceeded to}} annex it after a short war. The significance of this lies in {{that there had been}} many fears in the Soviet Union in the 1930s that the Germans would use Ukrainian nationalism as a tool for breaking up the Soviet Union. The establishment of an autonomous Ukrainian region in Czecho-Slovakia in October 1938 had promoted a major Soviet media campaign against its existence on the grounds that this was part of a Western plot to support separatism in the Soviet Ukraine. By allowing the Hungarians to destroy Europe's only Ukrainian state, Ribbentrop had signified that Germany was not interested (<b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment)</b> in sponsoring Ukrainian nationalism. This in turn helped to improve German-Soviet relations by demonstrating that German foreign policy was now primarily anti-Western rather than anti-Soviet.|$|E
25|$|As {{early as}} 1791 the other monarchies of Europe watched with alarm the {{developments}} in France, and considered {{whether they should}} intervene, either in support of Louis XVI or {{to take advantage of}} the chaos in France. The key figure, the Holy Roman Emperor Leopold II, brother to the French Queen Marie Antoinette, had initially looked on the Revolution calmly. He became more and more disturbed as the Revolution became more radical, although he still hoped to avoid war. On 27 August 1791, Leopold and King Frederick William II of Prussia, in consultation with emigrant French nobles, issued the Declaration of Pilnitz, which declared the interest of the monarchs of Europe in the well-being of Louis and his family, and threatened vague but severe consequences if anything should befall them. Although Leopold saw the Pillnitz Declaration as a way of taking action that would enable him to avoid actually doing anything about France, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment,</b> Paris saw the Declaration as a serious threat, and the revolutionary leaders denounced it.|$|E

2500|$|In 2000, Mohanlal {{starred in}} Narasimham, playing a rogue {{with a good}} heart. It became the highest-grossing Malayalam film of all time. In the next two years, Mohanlal was typecasted in similar larger-than-life action hero roles in films such as Ravanaprabhu (2001), Praja (2001), Onnaman (2002), Thandavam (2002), and Chathurangam (2002). Except for Ravanaprabhu, these films were widely criticised for their {{repetitive}} plots, lewd dialogues, punch lines and male chauvinistic outlook. A critic from The New Indian Express wrote, [...] "The Narasimham hangover is terrifically strong and it has, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment,</b> killed the prospects of good films. I don't see any other reason {{for the failure of}} well made female-oriented films like Mazha and Madhuranombarakkattu".|$|E
2500|$|Mao Zedong {{was both}} CSR state {{chairman}} and prime minister; {{he led the}} state and its government. Mao's tenure as head of a [...] "small state within a state" [...] gave him experience in mobile warfare and peasant organization; this experience helped him accomplish the Communist reunification of China during the late 1940s. The CSR was eventually destroyed by the Kuomintang (KMT)'s National Revolutionary Army in a series of 1934 encirclement campaigns. Following the Xi'an Incident of December 1936, the Communists and Kuomintang formed an uneasy [...] "United Front" [...] to resist Japanese pressure, which led to the Communists recognizing <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> Chiang Kai-shek as China's leader and the official dissolution of the Soviet Republic on 22 September 1937.|$|E

6000|$|Our {{ignorance of}} the goal and purport of human life, and the mistrust we are apt to feel of the {{guidance}} of the spiritual sense, on account of its proved readiness to accept illusions as realities, warn us against deductive theories of conduct. Putting these, then, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment,</b> to one side, we find ourselves face to face with two great and indisputable facts that everywhere force themselves on the attention and compel consideration. The one is that the whole of the living world moves steadily and continuously towards the evolution of races that are progressively more and more adapted to their complicated mutual needs and to their external circumstances. The other is that the process of evolution has been hitherto apparently carried out with, what we should reckon in our ways of carrying out projects, great waste of opportunity and of life, and with little if any consideration for individual mischance. Measured by our criterion of intelligence and mercy, which consists in the achievement of result without waste of time or opportunity, without unnecessary pain, and with equitable allowance for pure mistake, the process of evolution on this earth, so far as we can judge, has been carried out neither with intelligence nor ruth, but entirely through the routine of various sequences, commonly called [...] "laws," [...] established or necessitated we know not how.|$|E
6000|$|But the Adullamite spirit went to work, {{and finding}} that the bill [...] had the popular {{recommendation}} of a great phrase [household [...] suffrage], combined with the recommendation to them of a narrow [...] sphere of practical operation, determined to support the principle [...] of the bill and abandon our plan, although our mode of operation [...] had been warmly approved at party meetings held at my house. The [...] result was in a tactical sense highly damaging to us. Perhaps we [...] ought to have recognised {{that the idea of}} household suffrage, when [...] the phrase had once been advertised by a government as its [...] battle-ground, was irresistible, and that the only remaining [...] choice was whether it should be a household suffrage cribbed, [...] cabined, and confined by the condition of personal ratepaying, or [...] a household suffrage fairly conforming in substance and operation [...] to the idea that the phrase conveyed. The first was in our view [...] totally inadmissible; the second beyond the wants and wishes of [...] the time. But the government, it must be admitted, bowled us over [...] by the force of the phrase; and made it our next duty to bowl them [...] over by bringing the reality of the bill into correspondence with [...] its great profession. This {{we were able to do}} in some degree, when [...] we reached the committee, for some of the restrictions included in [...] the measure were such as the double-facing liberal fringe did not [...] venture to uphold against the assaults of their own party. But the [...] grand question of compound householding, which was really to [...] determine the character of our legislation, was one on which we [...] could not reckon upon either the conscientious or the intimidated [...] and prudential support of our liberal fringe. The government were [...] beyond all doubt, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment,</b> masters of the [...] situation. The question was raised, if not in its fullest breadth [...] yet in a form of considerable efficiency, by a proposal from Mr. [...] Hodgkinson, member for Newark, and a local solicitor little known [...] in the House.(152) He went there to support it, but without an [...] idea that it could be carried, and anticipating its defeat by a [...] majority of a hundred. Never have I undergone a stranger emotion [...] of surprise than when, as I was entering the House, our whip met [...] me and stated that Disraeli was about to support Hodgkinsonâ€™s [...] motion. But so it was, and the proposition was adopted without [...] disturbance, as if it had been an affair of trivial importance.|$|E

If you had told the truth, I for one could never have forgiven you. As you had conceived and written the earlier parts, the truth about the end, though indisputably true to fact, would have been a lie, or what is worse, a discord in art. If you are going to make a book end badly, it must end badly from the beginning. Now your book began to end well. You let yourself fall in love with, and fondle, and smile at your puppets. Once you had done that, your honour was committed--at the cost of truth to life you were bound to save them. It is the blot on Richard Feverel, for instance, that it begins to end well; and then tricks you and ends ill. But in that case there is worse behind, for the ill-ending does not inherently issue from the plot--the story had, in fact, ended well after the great last interview between Richard and Lucy--and the blind, illogical bullet which smashes all has no more to do between the boards than a fly has to do with the room into whose open window it comes buzzing. It might have so happened; it needed not; and unless needs must, we have no right to pain our readers. I have had a heavy case of conscience of the same kind about my Braxfield story. Braxfield--only his name is Hermiston--has a son who is condemned to death; plainly, there is a fine tempting fitness about this; and I meant he was to hang.

They were capable, hardy folks, too, who might very well succeed. Why should they not then? Why should not young Hermiston escape clear out of the country? and be happy, if he could, with his----.
