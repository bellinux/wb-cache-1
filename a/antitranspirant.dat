Combined heatand drought stresses strongly affected shoot water status and root growth. Results fromthis study imply that it is desirable to improve stand establishment by either conditioningthe seedlings to improve root growth or by preventing leaf dehydration by these stresses. Therefore, effects of plant growth regulators (PGR) on root growth and shoot waterstatus were examined. Ethylene regulators, including precursors or a releasing compound [DLmethionine(MET), 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylic acid (ACC) and ethephone(ETH) ], and inhibitors [amino-ethoxyvinylglycine (AVG) and 1 -methylcyclopropene (1 -MCP) ] were applied to seedlings to evaluate their effect on root growth and development. ACC and ETH (1 - 100 M?L- 1) enhanced root hair, root area and lateralroots (only with ETH at 30 M?L- 1).

Effects of {{different}} types of <b>antitranspirants</b> (ATs), Kaolin and Vapor Gard, on vegetative growth, flowering, and chemical composition, of tuberose (Polianthes tuberosa L.) cv. “Double” plants, grown under different irrigation regimes were investigated. Results showed that plant biomass, number of leaves, length and weight of marketable inflorescences and bulb yield were significantly reduced by water deficit, particularly at 60 % evapo-transpiration (ET). But, the flowering period was markedly shortened under stress conditions. Under water deficit N, P, K, Ca, total carbohydrates and soluble sugars decreased in treated leaves as compared to the control plants. Both types of ATs effectively enhanced plant performance, flower formation, bulb production, nutrient uptake and carbohydrate synthesis at the 80 % ET treatment, relative to the irrigation regime of 80 % ET. The performance of Kaolin was more effective than that of Vapor Gard (VG). This might be contributed to its mechanism in reducing leaf temperature, transpiration rate, improvement of plant water status and maintaining biomass production of tuberose plants. Due to the superiority of Kaolin particle film in regulating plant performance and chemistry, it is recommended to be used for reducing water loss by plants in Al-Qassim region, Saudi Arabia...|$|R

40|$|While Aquilaria {{species have}} {{had a long history}} of {{exploitation}} and trade, experience with their establishment and management in plantations is only recent. Significant transplant stress during establishment has been a feature of contemporary plantings in Australia. It is therefore important to determine the nature of this stress to mitigate its effect in future plantings. This study examined the influence of <b>antitranspirant</b> and fertiliser applied after planting in open conditions on the relative mean leaf chlorophyll content, survival and growth (height and diameter) of Aquilaria crassna seedlings when compared with a shade control. Additional field-applied fertiliser (without <b>antitranspirant)</b> had a significantly positive effect on mean chlorophyll index and height and diameter growth after transplanting, but a leaf application of <b>antitranspirant</b> had no such effect. Despite the benefit of additional fertiliser (without <b>antitranspirant)</b> this treatment had significantly greater mortality when compared with the shade treatment. The immediate increase in mean chlorophyll index in shade and its initial decline in full-sun exposed seedlings after planting indicates that the transplant stress is influenced, in part, by sun-exposure.

30|$|Uptake of {{aluminum}} {{can result in}} risks to human health. Aluminum {{has an effect on}} numerous biological processes in the body. The exact mechanism {{of aluminum}} toxicity is, however, not fully understood. It is considered certain that aluminum is potentially cell- and neurotoxic. [22]. Enzyme activity may be disrupted and mitochondrial function may be impaired. Aluminum may also produce oxidative stress [4]. In particular, three organ systems may be negatively affected by aluminum: the hemopoietic system, the nervous system and bones. It has also been suggested that aluminum {{may play a role in}} the occurrence of diseases such as breast cancer and Alzheimer’s dementia [22]. The only direct connections that have been shown between aluminum and disease are for hemodialysis encephalopathy, osteomalacia (softening of the bones), anemia, and aluminosis (pathological changes to the lungs) [22, 28]. Of particular importance are aluminum poisoning in the form of encephalopathy and osteomalacia. These effects may occur in patients with chronic kidney disease who are dependent upon dialysis or ingest phosphate binders containing aluminum for extended periods of time [29]. Dialysis encephalopathy 2 has been brought into connection with increased aluminum concentrations in the brain of dialysis patients. In order to adequately remove phosphate from the blood, the dialysis fluid contains an aluminum compound. The aluminum can then apparently accumulate in the body and in the brain. Patients may suffer from speech difficulties and muscle cramps brought on especially by trivalent aluminum ions, personality changes, accelerated dementia, and depressive moods [30, 31]. The skeletal system has also been suggested as a potential target of aluminum toxicity [28]. Long-term uptake of comparatively large amounts of aluminum, e.g., taking antacids 3 containing aluminum, may cause an imbalance in the calcium and phosphate household with resultant softening of the bones [32]. Substantial aluminum contamination may result in delayed bone development [31] and development of anemia. Aluminum-induced anemia is typically macrocytic and hypochromatic, 4 often occurring in dialysis patients. The exact cause of this phenomenon remains unknown [31]. Aluminosis, also referred to as “aluminum lung” is an occupational disease of workers exposed to aluminum and aluminum oxide dust and vapors. Of all aluminum-related health risks, aluminosis has been known the longest. [29]. Aluminum compounds accumulate in the lungs and impair the self-cleaning system of the lungs. In addition, they may elicit inflammatory processes that induce irreversible tissue damage to the respiratory system and the lungs, possibly resulting in fibrosis [33, 34]. Due to inadequate and disputable data, the involvement of aluminum in breast cancer and the development of Alzheimer’s disease as mentioned in the discussion can neither be explicitly substantiated or negated. Indications of a relationship between aluminum and breast cancer result from observations that breast tissue of women with tumors to some extent may exhibit higher aluminum concentrations than tissue from healthy women. It should also be noted that the disproportionate incidence of female breast cancer in the upper outer quadrant rises with year of publication, from 30.9 % in 1926 to 43 – 48 % in 1947 – 1967 and to 60.7 % in 1994 [35]. Aside from the improved diagnostic methods for cancer of the breast, the use of <b>antitranspirants</b> or deodorants containing aluminum may also play a role. Since these substances are applied very close to the breast tissue, they could be involved in the development of breast cancer [9]. It must be noted, however, that the data related to this are contradictory and as a consequence it is not possible to draw scientifically tenable conclusions regarding <b>antitranspirants</b> or deodorants containing aluminum and breast cancer. As a reaction to this controversial situation, however, aluminum-free <b>antitranspirants</b> have begun to appear in the market. Alzheimer’s disease is an illness characterized by disorders in cognitive areas such as memory and orientation disturbances [36]. Reports have been made of increased aluminum concentrations in certain areas of the brain [37]. As with the role that aluminum may play in the development of breast cancer, the role of aluminum in Alzheimer’s disease remains very controversial. As possible mechanism, the neurotoxic potential of aluminum and the possibility that aluminum bound to transferrin may enter the brain have been suggested. There is no evidence that aluminum may be a singular causative factor for Alzheimer’s disease, but may act as a co-factor that can abet the development of the disease [22].|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} few years, energy {{consumption}} in greenhouses has gained increased interest, due to the liberalisation of the energy market and the increasing prices of natural gas. In this paper, {{the effects of a}} series of adaptations in greenhouse climate and cropping systems on crop production and energy consumption are presented. Greenhouse energy consumption is primarily determined by the temperature set points. Allowing temperatures to fluctuate, can conserve 3 - 13 % energy, depending on the bandwidth applied. If average temperatures were kept at set point values, it hardly affected plant production. Lowering the temperature set point by 2 °C reduced energy consumption by 16 %, and production by 3 %. Increasing relative humidity set points and reducing plant transpiration by removing leaves or applying <b>antitranspirants</b> could save approximately 5 % energy with hardly any effect on plant growth. Increased light transmission of the greenhouse increased plant production and slightly reduced the energy consumption. Filtering out NIR had a positive effect on plant production, but negatively affected greenhouse temperatures. Substantial energy conservation could be realized by the application of an energy screen (16 - 20 %). Optimal use of the available amount of CO 2 positively affected crop production. These results indicate that in present cropping systems, energy conservation of 25 - 30 % seems possible without major investments and without loss of production. Characteristics of such an energy efficient cropping strategy are the use of relative low temperature set points, high humidities, use of energy screens and fluent transitions in greenhouse climate...|$|R

A randomized complete block design (RCBD) with split plot arrangement was used with wind protection (sheltered and exposed) areas as the main treatment and use of an <b>antitranspirant</b> spray or gel dip as subtreatments. Based on destructive harvests in the field, treatments and subtreatments did not affect dry weight or leaf area index in the first 2 years. Specific contrasts, however, showed that gel application significantly increased fresh weight, dry weight, and leaf area index over that of the untreated transplants whereas the spray application tended to reduce these factors during the first 3 weeks after transplanting. Significant differences between gel and spray subtreatments disappeared by 5 weeks after transplanting. Shelterbelts ameliorated crop microclimate thereby enhancing plant growth. Significantly, wind velocity at canopy height was reduced 40 % on average and soil temperatures were about 4 % warmer in the sheltered plots compared to the exposed plots during the first 5 weeks post-transplant. Muskmelon plants in the sheltered areas grew significantly faster than the plants in the exposed areas in 2 of the 3 years reported, with the 3 -year average fresh weight increased by 168 % due to wind protection. Overall transplanting success and early growth were enhanced the most by wind protection, followed by the polyacrylamide gel root dip, and least by the <b>antitranspirant</b> foliar spray. We conclude that microclimate modification by wind speed reduction can increase early muskmelon plant growth more consistently than the use of polyacrylamide gel as a root dip at transplanting {{or the use of}} an <b>antitranspirant</b> spray. A polyacrylamide gel root dip generally will provide more benefit during early muskmelon growth than the use of an <b>antitranspirant</b> spray...|$|E

The results suggest that in-field application of 1 [*]L[*]ha– 1 of <b>antitranspirant</b> (Vapor Gard (VG), a. i. di- 1 -p-menthene) at GS 6. 0 (BBCH growth scale, initiation of flowering) mitigated drought-induced yield loss leading to a 22 % seed-yield benefit on average over 2 years of experiments compared with the unsprayed unirrigated plots. No significant yield responses were found from application at GS 7. 0, with increasing VG concentrations (i. e. 2 and 4 [*]L[*]ha– 1), or with an <b>antitranspirant</b> with short-lasting effectiveness. The data suggest that in field conditions where drought occurs during the flowering stage, application of 1 [*]L[*]ha– 1 of VG just before the drought event can reduce yield loss. This result should encourage further work on water-saving management strategies during key drought-sensitive phenological stages as drought mitigation tools in canola and under different environments...|$|E
40|$|Access {{restricted}} to the OSU CommunityIncreasing agricultural production {{to meet the requirements}} of a rapidly growing world population {{is one of the most}} critical problems to be faced today. Water, in many areas, is the primary factor limiting plant growth and crop yield. Of the series of processes involved in converting precipitation which falls on a watershed to crop yields on a distant irrigated field, the least efficient process occurs within the plant itself. Inadequate attention has been given to the fact that less than 1 % of the water absorbed by plant roots is retained within the plant, and a considerably smaller percentage is contained in the harvested crop. This very low efficiency in water utilization by green plants offers a tremendous challenge to research on methods for decreasing water loss from plants while still permitting growth to continue at an acceptable rate. In the last several years, some studies have been made on materials which retard transpiration by closing stomata or by coating leaves with a film of limited permeability to water vapor. The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the possibilities for retarding transpiration by altering the reflectance characteristics of plant leaves. This investigation consists of three parts. The first part deals with the optical properties of plant leaves per se with special reference to variations among and within species. It includes energy exchange considerations to evaluate, from theory, the effects of the optical properties on the water relations of leaves. The second part deals with actual measurements, under controlled laboratory conditions, of the effect of induced modifications in the optical properties of leaves on their temperature, transpiration and photosynthesis. It includes discussions on the potentialities and limitations of reflecting materials as transpiration retardants or <b>antitranspirants.</b> The third part extends the results to other environmental conditions and provides some guidelines for the use of reflecting materials under field conditions...|$|R
40|$|The use of antitranspirants is {{one method}} of {{mitigating}} water while increasing the yield of cereal crops. Experiments {{were carried out}} on a durum wheat (Triticum durum L.) variety (Karim) and a barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) variety (Rihane) to {{study the effects of}} Vapor Gard (VG; di- 1 -p-menthene), an <b>antitranspirant,</b> on two physiological traits at two different growth stages. The study was conducted in a glasshouse under water stress and VG was sprayed twice at three concentrations (5, 7, and 10 %) at tillering and stem elongation stages. VG spray reduced the effect of water stress on durum wheat and barley varieties. Leaf water potential (LWP) was significantly increased, albeit at different rates, for the two cereal species. However, no significant change was observed for photosynthetic rate (PR). These results favor the use of VG although more studies are recommended on other physiological traits to strongly support the application of this <b>antitranspirant...</b>|$|E
40|$|Background and Aims: Accelerated berry sugar {{accumulation}} {{resulting in}} wines of excessive alcohol concentration, sub-optimal colour and atypical flavour {{has become increasingly}} frequent in warm growing districts, a trend induced by factors that include global warming. The application of a film-forming <b>antitranspirant</b> may be an effective way of reducing early sugar accumulation without affecting colour development. Methods and Results: An <b>antitranspirant</b> emulsion was applied in 2013 and in 2014 on field-grown cv. Barbera vines at pre-flowering (PF), pre-veraison (PV) and at both dates (PFPV), and compared with the unsprayed control. Post-treatment assessment included seasonal gas exchange, yield components, growth of berry organs and must composition. Although all treatments were effective in reducing gas exchange {{by as much as}} 46 % compared with that of the control, berry growth was not affected. Conversely, whereas PF slightly modified the ripening pattern, PV and PFPV markedly delayed accumulation of sugar in the warm 2013 season (- 2. 4 and - 3. 7 ° Brix, respectively, vs control) without detriment to colour development because the onset of anthocyanins occurred at lower TSS. In the cooler, wet 2014 season, PV and PFPV were again able to delay sugar accumulation without affecting colour development. Conclusions: Pre-veraison application of the <b>antitranspirant</b> alone or in combination with a PF spray proved effective in slowing sugar accumulation while avoiding concurrent delay of colour development. Significance of the Study: The use of antitranspirants is a practical and flexible way of regulating the sugar:anthocyanin ratio under conditions of excessively fast ripening. © 2016 Australian Society of Viticulture and Oenology Inc...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of different concentrations of a film- forming <b>antitranspirant</b> (Wilt-Pruf) on the transpiration rate of young apple trees (Ml 06) was studied. One-year-old Mailing 106 trees were potted in 10. 2 em (4 inch) metal pots. The plants {{were placed in}} a controlled environmental chamber during the study period. Sufficient reductions in water loss resulted with all concentrations of Wilt- Pruf with a 63 percent reduction at the highest concentration. Phytotoxicity was not observed though the higher concentrations imparted a sticky film to plants and {{they appeared to be}} lighter green {{at the end of the}} test. The effect of Wilt-Pruf on four-year old apple trees (Golden Delicious) was conducted in August 1977 at Utah State University Experimental Farm i n Farmington, Utah. The resistance to water vapor diffusion from the leaves was increased on both Wilt-Pruf treated irrigated and unirrigated trees, and water balance was improved, increasing leaf and stern water potential. The improved water balance of treated apple trees resulted in fruit size increase. The higher concentration of <b>antitranspirant</b> in both irrigated and unirrigated apple trees resulted in a higher leaf temperature than the irrigated control...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the effect of pinolene-based film-forming Vapor Gard (VG) emulsion (di- 1 -p-menthene), a commercial <b>antitranspirant,</b> on the response of the sensitive bean (Phaseolus vulgaris cv. Pinto) plants to realistic ozone fumigations. Plants treated with the chemical were significantly less damaged in comparison with untreated controls when exposed to as much as 150 ppb of ozone in the atmosphere for 4 h. In unozonated plants, photosynthesis as well as stomatal conductance was significantly depressed by the <b>antitranspirant.</b> In VG-treated individuals, (1) visible injury is strongly reduced; (2) membrane damage is counteracted; (3) photosynthetic activity is unchanged, as well as the stomatal conductance and the store of CO 2 in substomatal chamber; (4) F v/F m and the other parameters of chlorophyll fluorescence reveal a stability of the photochemical apparatus; and (v) antioxidant defence is not stimulated. Unexpectedly, our results highlighted a dramatic difference between the protective effects towards ozone damage induced by VG, depending on its mode of distribution. As reported above, when entire plants ("both leaves") are treated or untreated with VG, those individuals wherein VG was not applied showed severe alterations in phenomenological, biochemical and ecophysiological parameters investigated due to ozone toxicity. This is not true in the cases where "single primary leaves" or selected regions ("half leaves") are treated with VG. Even if visible injury is present after ozone fumigation, physiological parameters, such as A max and G w, in ozonated and VG-treated single leaves and half leaves are similar to unfumigated controls. Similar results were obtained for chlorophyll fluorescence parameters. A membrane-protective action is observed in half-leaves treatment. It appears that the presence of regions (single leaves or half leaves), which are treated with VG, modifies the behaviour to ozone of untreated regions. Possible explanations of the observed phenomenon are discussed. The <b>antitranspirant</b> di- 1 -p-menthene proved to be a low-cost, low-technology tool for assessing ozone injury in the fiel...|$|E
40|$|Some {{previously}} unexpected {{effects of}} antitranspirants on stomata and plant growth are described, and their implications are discussed. <b>Antitranspirant</b> films increase {{the resistance to}} diffusion of water vapor from stomata. This increases leaf water potential and results in wider stomatal apertures immediately under the film, {{as well as on}} those parts of a partially treated leaf which are not covered by the film. Antitranspirants are expected to curtail growth via reduced photosynthesis. However, by increasing plant water potential they can enhance the growth of fruits and shoots...|$|E
40|$|Three desert {{perennials}} {{from the}} Wahiba Sands, Oman were studied {{for their ability}} to withstrand high air temperatures combined with low water availability. Plants were also sprayed with <b>antitranspirant</b> to reduced water loss. This limited the potential for evaporative leaf cooling and resulted in high leaf temperatures in Prosopis cineraria (Druce) and Zygophyllum qatarense (Hadidi). Diurnal measurements were made of leaf and air temperature and of of photosynthesis and transpiration. Antitranspirants did not significantly reduce transpiration in Heliotropium kotschyi (Guerke), which contained high concentrations of the quaternary compound betaine. Transpiration continued through the hottest periods of the day and appeared to be essential for leaf cooling. All species appeared to have a threshold leaf temperature above which photosynthesis was severely impaired. Samples were taken for analysis of amino acids, quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) and low molecular weight carbohydrates in conjunction photosynthesis and transpiration in order to examine any possible protective functions. In Prosopis cineraria the background concentration of the cyclitol, pinitol was high but there was no increase in response to the <b>antitranspirant</b> induced increase in leaf temperatures. Proline concentration increased in leaves of Zygophyllum qatarense throughout the day but this {{did not appear to be}} related to leaf temperature...|$|E
