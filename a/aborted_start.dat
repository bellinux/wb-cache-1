5|$|As the {{championship}} {{moved into the}} second half of the season, Fernando Alonso maintained a thirty-four-point lead over his nearest rival, Mark Webber, with Sebastian Vettel a further ten points behind. Alonso's outlook for the race was dour, qualifying sixth and pinning his hopes on a wet race as Lewis Hamilton continued McLaren's mid-season resurgence, returning to pole position for the first time since the Malaysian Grand Prix. Following an <b>aborted</b> <b>start</b> triggered by Michael Schumacher lining up in the wrong grid position and then shutting his engine off in the confusion, Hamilton and Grosjean lead the field away. After prematurely moving Jenson Button onto a three-stop strategy, McLaren gave Hamilton the order to hold position as the tight confines of the Hungaroring circuit forced the teams to try to make up positions in the pits. This was evidenced by Kimi Räikkönen, who inherited the lead after the first set of stops and produced a series of fast laps that allowed him to rejoin in second, coming dangerously close to team-mate Grosjean under brakes as he emerged from the pit lane. Despite taking two seconds out of Hamilton's lead within five laps of rejoining the race, Räikkönen was powerless to reel Hamilton in any further. Hamilton won the race, the nineteenth of his career, with Räikkönen second and Grosjean in third. Hamilton's victory brought with it twenty-five points that put him back in championship contention, while a late decision by Red Bull to move Mark Webber onto a three-stop strategy saw the Australian slip further behind Fernando Alonso, as the Spaniard extended his championship lead to forty points.|$|E
25|$|Mark Winterbottom won the Jason Richards Memorial Trophy after {{dominating}} {{the weekend in}} New Zealand. The 2013 Jason Richards Memorial Trophy winner, Jason Bright, started the event strongly by taking pole for the first race and going on to win after early leader Jamie Whincup had steering problems. Shane Van Gisbergen and Craig Lowndes completed the podium, while David Wall was put out {{for the rest of}} the weekend after contact with Chaz Mostert at the final corner caused his car to make heavy contact with the wall. Winterbottom won the first of the Saturday races ahead of polesitter James Courtney and Mostert. Van Gisbergen won the second Saturday race, holding off a late charge from Winterbottom, with Scott McLaughlin in third after starting from pole. McLaughlin again took pole for the Sunday race but was beaten by Winterbottom in the race, with Mostert finishing third for the second time during the weekend. Tim Slade had qualified on the front row, but his car had a clutch problem on the formation lap, causing an <b>aborted</b> <b>start</b> and forcing him to start from the pit lane. With Lowndes struggling during the weekend, Winterbottom left the event with a 107-point lead in the championship.|$|E
2500|$|... #1: Used as a spare car at Rio, Imola, Spa, Monaco, Detroit, Circuit Paul Ricard, Silverstone, Hockenheim, Hungaroring, Monza, Estoril, Jerez, Suzuka, and Adelaide. This chassis only raced once, at the <b>aborted</b> <b>start</b> (1st) at Österreichring by Stefan Johansson.|$|E
50|$|Cristiano da Matta had {{a faulty}} launch control, which caused 2 <b>aborted</b> <b>starts,</b> {{reducing}} {{the race to}} 69 laps. On the third (and final) formation lap, Heinz-Harald Frentzen's Sauber did not start, {{and he did not}} have time to set up the team car.|$|R
50|$|Bartoli started {{entering}} tournaments {{regularly at}} the age of 16. After a few <b>aborted</b> <b>starts</b> in 1999 and 2000, she played in the ITF $10,000 clay events in the spring of 2001. Winning two tournaments back to back in May (in Hatfield and Torino) ensured that she would be given a wildcard into her first Grand Slam, the French Open, where she lost to Catalina Castaño in the first round. Bartoli also won another tournament in Koksijde, Belgium.|$|R
50|$|After {{the second}} round of stops, Barrichello closed up on second-place Räikkönen, but was unable to pass him due to some good {{defensive}} moves by Kimi, despite his car being clearly faster. Michael eventually {{went on to win the}} race, his third successive of the season. Jenson Button finished fourth for BAR despite being disappointed in qualifying, and David Coulthard's race was uneventful in fifth place. Ralf Schumacher was sixth, Webber finished a brilliant seventh despite his penalties, and Trulli was eighth for the final point. Despite causing the <b>aborted</b> <b>starts</b> earlier in the day, da Matta finished the race, a lap down in tenth position.|$|R
50|$|According to the rules, {{the cars}} are {{required}} to maintain a minimum fuel economy of 1.8 miles per gallon. To complete two parade laps, one pace lap, and the 200 laps for the race, each car is allotted 280 gal of methanol fuel in their pitside tank. Due to the <b>aborted</b> <b>start,</b> officials {{took the time to}} replenish approximately 5.6 gal of fuel to each team's pitside tank.|$|E
50|$|The race {{began at}} 14:00 MST, Heinz-Harald Frentzen {{drastically}} slowed during the parade lap {{due to a}} computer-hardware error. It was thought he would fail to make the start; however, Giancarlo Fisichella bought the Jordan driver some time when he {{lined up on the}} incorrect side of the grid, and failed to take his correct grid point after attempting to cross the grid. This caused an <b>aborted</b> <b>start,</b> allowing both the Jordan and Benetton to take the restart.|$|E
50|$|The race start {{was delayed}} because of {{changing}} wet weather conditions and accidents during {{each of the}} first two attempts. The first incident occurred in Turn 12 (the final corner) and collected Raul Boesel, Willy T. Ribbs, Robbie Buhl, and Alessandro Zampedri. The second <b>aborted</b> <b>start</b> saw further carnage; this time in the second chicane involving Boesel and Zampedri again, along with Mario Andretti, Hiro Matsushita, and Davy Jones slowed the field. Bobby Rahal hit the tyre wall in the first chicane, apparently on his own, and Paul Tracy spun off in Turn 4 undamaged. The race finally started around 4 p.m., with Andretti overtaking Mansell on the first lap.|$|E
50|$|Büyükakçay did not contest many junior tournaments, only playing four before {{competing}} at {{the senior}} level. After a few <b>aborted</b> <b>starts,</b> Büyükakçay played her first professional match at a 10K ITF event in Istanbul in May 2004. Losing in the qualifying draw, she would play two more tournaments during the 2004 season. She won her first ever Fed Cup match in 2005, partnering Pemra Özgen to defeat Stephanie Pace and Stephanie Sullivan of Malta. She made her WTA debut at the 2005 İstanbul Cup, but lost to Elena Vesnina in the first round. She continued to compete in 10K and 25K ITF events {{for the remainder of}} the year.|$|R
50|$|The race {{began with}} Trulli on pole and BAR's Jenson Button behind; Renault's Fernando Alonso and Michael Schumacher {{occupied}} the second row. After two <b>aborted</b> <b>starts</b> (Olivier Panis stalled his Toyota and Trulli's Renault leaked coolant onto the track) the parade lap began; Panis stalled again {{and started the}} race from the pits. As the race began, BAR's Takuma Sato made an excellent start, moving from eighth to fourth in seconds. Presently Sato's engine began smoking; on the third lap, it exploded spectacularly and released an enormous cloud of smoke, in which Sauber's Giancarlo Fisichella collided with McLaren’s David Coulthard and overturned. Both drivers were unhurt but out of the race, as was Sato.|$|R
5000|$|After the race, Häkkinen {{described}} the situation {{after the two}} <b>aborted</b> <b>starts</b> as relieving, saying: [...] "When Michael was forced to start {{from the back of}} the grid it raised an enormous amount of pressure from me. The race was not as difficult as others I've had this season. But a lot of that's down to the team who kept letting me know where Eddie and Michael were." [...] Eddie Irvine was quoted saying: [...] "What happened to Michael at the start didn't change our tactics for the race, it destroyed them. When Michael went to the back I knew it was up to me. I made a fantastic start and got close to Mika at some points but just couldn't manage to get in front." ...|$|R
50|$|On {{the parade}} lap, Senna's gear {{selector}} mechanism broke {{and he had}} to complete the lap jammed in first gear. The first start was aborted and Senna started from the spare car in the pits. At the second start, Alain Prost with no one in front of him due to Senna's absence, won the start and put in one of his famous first laps that saw him lead by almost 2 seconds, with Mansell in 2nd place, though he was soon passed by Berger's Ferrari. After running in the hot air behind the turbocharged Ferrari, on lap 19 Mansell's temperature gauge showed that the Williams was overheating (at the first <b>aborted</b> <b>start</b> Mansell had been forced to drive off around the track, thankfully without penalty, due to his Judd V8 already overheating on the grid). He entered the pits to investigate, handing third to Nelson Piquet in his Lotus; during the process, Mansell stalled his engine.|$|E
50|$|Race 19 {{was held}} on Sunday {{afternoon}} and the race regulations required each car to take on at least 120 litres of fuel during the race. The race {{was scheduled to be}} 52 laps in length, however this was reduced by one lap after a problem with the start lights led to an <b>aborted</b> <b>start.</b> Lowndes made a good start and moved into the lead around the outside of Mostert into the first corner, with Whincup in third ahead of Moffat, McLaughlin and Van Gisbergen. Winterbottom encountered a problem with his front-right tyre and was the first driver to complete a pit stop, doing so on lap 8. One lap later, Van Gisbergen {{was the first of the}} leaders to pit, followed by Lowndes and Whincup on lap 10. McLaughlin stopped on lap 12 while Mostert and Moffat stayed out until laps 15 and 16 respectively. After all drivers had completed their first pit stop, Lowndes led from Whincup, Van Gisbergen, Mostert and Moffat.|$|E
50|$|Shortly {{after joining}} the Rizla Suzuki team for 2008, {{he was seen}} testing a Suzuki MotoGP bike. Sykes started the 2008 with a 6th and an 8th at Thruxton (The first races were there as the season opener at Brands Hatch was snowed off). He took pole {{position}} at Oulton Park, but crashed at the <b>aborted</b> <b>start</b> of race 1, before finishing 5th on the restart http://www.motorcyclenews.com/MCN/sport/sportresults/mcn/2008/may/5-11/may0508oultonparkbsbraceoneshanebyrnewinsbattlewithleonhaslam/. He led race 2 until being taken out by Leon Haslam, who was excluded for the move. Sykes continued to finish towards {{the front of the}} field consistently scoring podiums at Brands Hatch (2nd), Donington Park (3rd) and Snetterton (3rd) all in the first of the 2 races. It was at Oulton Park where he scored his first two victories, taking the lead from James Ellison late in race 1 but leading most of race 2. He followed that up with a third straight win at Knockhill in the first race, and collected podiums {{for the rest of the}} championship. Sykes finished 4th in the championship with 316 points, 2 points behind Cal Crutchlow.|$|E
50|$|Standing starts {{have been}} {{eliminated}} for 2015. The series says more development is needed before re-introducing them to the series, especially after numerous <b>aborted</b> standing <b>starts</b> and a crash at Houston during the 2013 season, and a start-line pile-up at the Indianapolis road course race in 2014.|$|R
5000|$|Reynolds {{was an avid}} aviator {{like his}} older brother R. J. Reynolds, Jr., also known as [...] "Dick". Smith bought a S.56C {{amphibian}} biplane built by American Aeronautical Corporation in Port Washington, New York under license from Italian manufacturer Savoia-Marchetti {{in the spring of}} 1931, it was customized for him to have a single seat and extra fuel capacity as he planned to fly it around the world.After a couple of <b>aborted</b> <b>starts,</b> Reynolds began a long-distance flight (London to Hong Kong) in December 1931 right after his marriage to Holman. She was touring the United States in a road production of Three's A Crowd, reprising her Broadway theatre role. His solo flight was not really publicized and he was completing the ocean portions via boat. His flight journal survives.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} {{grand prix}} at Portugal {{proved to be}} an exciting affair, for all but Ayrton Senna who suffered race long with handling troubles. He ended sixth while Prost kept his championship hopes alive to secure his fifth race of the year. March driver Ivan Capelli secured his first career podium with a brilliant second behind Prost, with Boutsen once again finishing third in his Benetton. As the field finished the first lap of the race, Prost, who had claimed his second pole of the year (and pulled a psychological ploy on Senna by setting his time early in the final session, then spending the rest of the session lounging in the McLaren pits wearing jeans and a T-shirt, almost daring the Brazilian to beat him), pulled out of Senna's slipstream to pass his teammate for the lead down the straight. In a famous vision, Senna almost pushed his teammate into the pit wall at over 280 km/h, something which didn't please the race winner, this was after Prost had pushed Senna wide onto the grass during one of the <b>aborted</b> <b>starts.</b>|$|R

50|$|Italy's Teo Fabi, {{driving for}} Forsythe Racing {{won his first}} pole since Denver in 1990 for the Porsche team. The start was aborted after an {{improper}} field alignment, but the start was clean on Lap 2. On Lap 7 Michael Andretti touched Robby Gordon's left rear tire with his right front wing; the contact was dramatic but harmless. Fabi led the first 27 laps until Al Unser Jr. (looking to put the DNQ at Indy behind him) overtook him in traffic. Behind him, Paul Tracy was making bold passes on the outside in the same traffic. Fabi {{was the first to}} make a pit stop at Lap 63, followed by Unser at Lap 65. Tracy came in ten laps later, followed by his teammate Andretti, who stalled exiting his pit and lost several seconds before continuing. Unser reclaimed the lead after the first round of stops. At Lap 124 the first real yellow of the day (the <b>aborted</b> <b>start</b> counting as the first) came when Chilean rookie Eliseo Salazar spun in Turn 4. Emerson Fittipaldi attempted to sneak into the pits for his final stop, but after he slowed to avoid Salazar he collected marbles on his tires which, adding to his oversteer condition, caused him to spin into the pitlane and he nudged the inside wall with the right rear. He was done for the day. Under the yellow the leaders made their second and final pit stops, and Tracy beat Unser out of the pits. Al Jr. retook the lead from Tracy on Lap 144, and as they sliced through lapped traffic Tracy took the lead with 22 laps to go. A few laps later, Tracy tried to pass a group of cars (trailed by Alessandro Zampedri) on the outside, and he lost traction momentarily but continued without further incident. Fuel concerns were eminent in both the Penske and Newman-Haas pits, but Tracy took the checkered flag ahead of a fast-closing Unser by less than one second.|$|E
50|$|Because of Alonso's car obstructing the track, the <b>start</b> was <b>aborted</b> by the FIA's race {{director}} Charlie Whiting, and {{the cars}} were sent on an additional formation lap. The race was accordingly shortened by a lap - making fuel management easier, as observed by former F1 race driver, David Coulthard via Channel 4 commentary. Meanwhile, Sky Sports F1 pundit and former F1 driver Paul di Resta noted how <b>aborted</b> <b>starts</b> could lead to diminished concentration on the start-proper, due to losing mental focus after preparing for the initial start. The extra formation lap and standing on the grid would also give the clutch and brakes less efficiency for the start-proper. These factors possibly assisted Bottas in taking the race win by catching pole sitter Sebastian Vettel out with a better start as opposed to Vettel's less efficient start. Meanwhile, the reduced number of laps would allow for more liberal fuel consumption enabling the Finn {{to open up the}} taps when out front in clean air, while depriving Vettel the chance of chasing him down for the full race distance - swinging to Bottas's favour, considering that Vettel was rapidly closing in in the latter stages of race.|$|R
50|$|At the Pau Grand Prix, Éric Bernard led the two EJR cars of Jean Alesi and Donnelly {{after an}} <b>aborted</b> first <b>start.</b> However, Bernard was caught behind an {{accident}} involving Paul Belmondo and stalled his car, allowing Alesi {{to go through}} and take the victory. Bernard stormed back though the field, but collided with Mark Blundell while battling for second place. Bernard would win the next race at Jerez. Andrea Chiesa then won a close race on the dusty Enna circuit.|$|R
5000|$|American-based series such as IndyCar, NASCAR, and SCCA have {{traditionally}} utilized rolling starts.

40|$|After an <b>aborted</b> <b>start</b> in {{the early}} 1990 s, the Australian {{domestic}} aviation market has seen a significant shift from a duopoly market in which two full-service airlines competed with similar services, {{to the emergence of}} three airlines/four brands – three of which are low cost carriers. Aggressive marketing strategies, low fares and increased capacity by low cost carriers Virgin Blue, Jetstar and Tiger Airways have benefited many regional destinations. The research presented in this paper shows that as air fares have fallen consumers have switched from private cars, long distance coach and rail to air. The reasons for this switch include consumer recognition of the savings that are possible through lower travel costs by air and that more time may be spent at the destination. The impact of switching modes is demonstrated by analysing the impact of LCCs on Cairns, a major coastal destination in northeast of Australia...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This work {{presents}} a methodology to compute dynamic stress distributions on large conveyor belts considering a viscous-damping model. Results {{could be very}} useful at the conveyor design stage since at starts and stops of the system, large dynamic loads may be encountered. Such loads may produce a catastrophic failure of the conveyor, with important direct and downtime costs. We present a finite- element based methodology and use the Newmark time-integration method to solve the transient responses. Our scheme includes the effects of damping. A real-life industrial case is analyzed and three critical situations are considered: normal stop, sudden stop, suddenly <b>aborted</b> <b>start.</b> Results are shown in terms of dynamic loads at critical points of the system. The simulations show that the damping effects are negligible {{in the analysis of}} real-life designs, thus allowing the use of the analytical solution. For the analized case, maximum loads obtained with the present methodology are smaller in 5 % than those obtained with the conservative approach...|$|E
50|$|On race day {{the track}} was dry but the start was delayed when Zanardi and Gené lined {{up out of}} {{sequence}} on the grid, necessitating another formation lap. As the <b>start</b> was <b>aborted</b> during the <b>start</b> lights' sequence, the top five qualifiers and another car actually jumped the start but were not penalised due to the <b>aborting</b> of the <b>start.</b> When the race finally got under way, Frentzen led from Häkkinen, but further back there was trouble at the first corner. Hill's Jordan suffered an electrical failure {{in the middle of}} the pack which caused Wurz to swerve into Diniz, sending the Sauber into a barrel roll. The safety car was deployed while Diniz was helped uninjured from his car - a fortunate end result as it was later revealed that the Sauber's rollbar had failed when it hit the ground.|$|R
