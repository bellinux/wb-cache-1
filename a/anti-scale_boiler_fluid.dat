40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the combustion and gasification research sponsored by the CRC for Clean Power from Lignite. This research is focused on two distinct areas, gasification of lignite for use in advanced gas turbine cycles and the utilisation of de-watered lignite in existing <b>boilers.</b> <b>Fluid</b> bed gasification is at the centre of a suite of technologies being developed for advanced power generation cycles using Victorian and South Australian lignite, the latter being particularly difficult to utilise on account of its high sodium and sulphur contents. Gasification research at Adelaide is focused on obtaining fundamental reactivity data under gasification conditions to validate and to further develop an existing fluid bed gasification model. The sodium and sulphur in the SA fuel present a special challenge and a considerable part of the research effort is devoted to developing techniques to manage these components. The team is utilising two small gasifiers, one batch and one continuous for this work and is about to commission a new 200 -mm continuous fluid bed gasifier. Utilisation of de-watered lignite in existing boilers represents a significant fuel change, similar to the changes from coal to oil (1950 – 1960 s) and oil to natural gas (1970 – 1980 s), which did not occur smoothly. Researchers at Adelaide are currently developing mathematical and physical models for lignite-fired boilers, which, together with the lessons from the past, will equip the industry for the changes with minimum disruption.

50|$|A reflex gauge is {{more complex}} in {{construction}} but can give a clearer distinction between gas (steam) and liquid (water). Instead of containing the media in a glass tube, the gauge consists of a vertically oriented slotted metal body with a strong glass plate mounted on the open side of the slot facing the operator. The rear of the glass, {{in contact with the}} media, has grooves moulded into its surface, running vertically. The grooves form a zig-zag pattern with 90° angles. Incident light entering the glass is refracted at the rear surface in contact with the media. In the region that is contact with the gas, most of the light is reflected from the surface of one groove to the next and back towards the operator, appearing silvery white. In the region that is in contact with the liquid, most of the light is refracted into the liquid causing this region to appear almost black to the operator. Well-known makes of reflex gauge are IGEMA,TGI Ilmadur,Penberthy, Jerguson, Klinger, and Cesare-Bonetti. Due to the caustic nature of <b>boiler</b> <b>anti-scaling</b> treatments ("water softeners"), reflex gauges tend to become relatively rapidly etched by the water and lose their effectivess at displaying the liquid level. Therefore, bi-colour gauges are recommended for certain types of boiler, particularly those operating at pressure above 60 bar.|$|R

Because coal-fired boilers are {{a significant source of}} power generation in the U.

This applied research is focused on developing strategies for biomass cofiring, including enhanced NOx reduction techniques, such as biomass reburning, that take advantage of the high volatility of biofuels in combustion zones, such as those found in pulverized coal boilers. Minimizing unburned carbon loss while achieving NOx reductions are important factors in evaluating biomass fuels for cofiring as well as in specifying appropriate biomass handling/injection schemes for utility <b>boilers.</b> Computational <b>fluid</b> dynamics (CFD) modeling routines for biomass cofiring are being developed using available experimental data and first principles that provide accurate estimations of kinetic and model parameters of devolatilization and diffusion-controlled char burnout.

The main aim of this work is to improve mixing process incombustion chamber. To do this, the optimization of placementand direction of additional air and fuel nozzles, the physicalmodelling technique is used. By using that method, it ispossible to obtain qualitative information about processes,which occur in the real boiler. The numerical simulationsverify the results from physical modelling, because duringmathematical modelling quantitative informations about flow andmixing patterns, temperature field, species concentration areobtained. Two 3 D cases, before and after retrofit, of pulverized fuelfired boiler at 125 MW output thermal power are simulated. Theunstructured mesh technique {{is also used to}} discretize theboiler. The number of grid was 427 656 before retrofit and 513362 after retrofit. The comparisons of results of numericalsimulation before and after retrofit are presented. The resultsfrom physical modelling and numerical simulation are alsoshown. Results present that nozzles of additional air and fuel givea considerably better mixing process, uniform temperature fieldand CO 2 mass fraction. The whole combustion chamber worksalmost as a "well stirred reactor", while upper part of boilerworks as a "plug flow reactor".

Selection of working fluid among many candidates {{is a key}} topic and guidelines have been presented. A general {{problem is that the}} selection is based on numerous criteria, such as thermodynamic performance, boundary conditions, hazard levels and environmental concerns.

The efficiency losses caused by imposing process constraints are investigated to help propose a suitable process layout. Hydrocarbon dry type fluids in recuperated processes produced the highest efficiencies, while wet and isentropic fluids were superior in non-recuperated processes. The results suggested that at design point, the requirements of process simplicity, low operating pressure and low hazard resulted in cumulative reductions in cycle efficiency. Furthermore, the results indicated that non-flammable fluids were able to produce near optimum efficiency in recuperated high pressure processes...|$|R
30|$|There are no {{permanent}} solutions for fouling, {{but there are}} certain technologies which can help in minimizing the deposition problems in boilers. Some of these processes are pulse detonation wave technology, intelligent soot blower, chemical treatment technology, anti-fouling coatings, etc [35]. These technologies can help in reducing the fouling problem to some extent in boiler tubes depending upon their efficiency. Finishing remarks and recommendations can be drawn according to the results shown. Soot blowers can be used to clean the heated plane of boilers during operations, with blowing medium as water and steam. Water or steam is directed at the deposit through a nozzle which causes the deposit to fracture and corrode away.

40|$|This report {{describes}} a novel NOx control {{system that has}} the potential to drastically reduce cost, and enhance performance, operation and safety of power plant NOx control. The new system optimizes the burner and the furnace to achieve very low NOx levels and to provide an adequate amount of CO, and uses the CO for reducing NO both in-furnace and over a downstream AFSCR (ammonia-free selective catalytic reduction) reactor. The AF-SCR combines the advantages of the highly successful SCR technology for power plants and the TWC (three-way catalytic converter) widely used on automobiles. Like the SCR, it works in oxidizing environment of combustion flue gas and uses only base metal catalysts. Like the TWC, the AF-SCR removes NO and excess CO simultaneously without using any external reagent, such as ammonia. This new process has been studied in a development program jointed funded by the US Department of Energy and Foster Wheeler. The report outlines the experimental catalyst work performed on a bench-scale reactor, including test procedure, operating conditions, and results of various catalyst formulations. Several candidate catalysts, prepared with readily available transition metal oxides and common substrate materials, have shown over 80 - 90 % removal for both NO and CO in oxidizing gas mixtures and at elevated temperatures.

40|$|The {{release of}} sodium from low rank coal during {{combustion}} {{is known to}} be an important factor in the phenomena of fouling and corrosion in industrial boilers. Although much is known about the gas phase chemistry of sodium compounds, and the likely sequence of events that lead to fouling and corrosion, very little fundamental work has been undertaken on the release of sodium from the coal particle as it is combusted. The principal objective {{of this study was to}} perform detailed quantitative measurements and mathematical modelling of sodium release during combustion of single brown coal particles. Planar Laser Induced Fluorescence (PLIF) was applied for the in-situ measurement of the atomic sodium concentration field in the plume of single Loy Yang brown coal particles. Laser absorption measurements at the sodium D 1 line (589. 59 nm) were utilised to calibrate PLIF measurements of atomic sodium in a purpose designed flat flame environment. Detailed measurements of atomic sodium in the plume of single combusting brown coal particles of varying amounts and forms of sodium and of varying particle sizes were then undertaken. A run-of-mine Loy Yang brown coal sample and two samples that were processed using Mechanical/Thermal Expression (MTE), which removed a fraction of the inherent moisture and concomitant dissolved salts, were investigated. An experiment was also performed to simultaneously measure the particle temperature, particle size, and the atomic sodium concentration in the plume of a single burning Loy Yang brown coal particle. From the experimental results, the proportions of sodium released during the stages of coal devolatilisation, char combustion and from the remaining ash after combustion were determined for the three coals used at various particle sizes. The relative differences between the sodium release behaviour of water-bound and organically bound sodium were also inferred. During char combustion, the release of sodium was determined to be dependent on both the particle temperature and particle size. In order to decouple these parameters and determine the true controlling parameter(s) for sodium release, a model was established for the release of sodium, the char burnout behaviour of the particles, and the particle surface temperature. By combining the modelling with further analysis of the experimental data, the temperature dependent kinetics of sodium release during brown coal char combustion were established. A full mechanism was also proposed for sodium release during the various stages of coal combustion, which suggested that the rate determining step for sodium release during char combustion is the formation of a reduced form of sodium in the char, which subsequently leads to the rapid loss of sodium from the particle. The results of this study advance the knowledge of the release of sodium from brown coal combustion. Two major contributions are the development of a methodology that enables the direct in-situ measurements of the concentration of atomic sodium in the plume of individual burning coal particles, and the establishment of the kinetics and mechanism for the release of sodium during Loy Yang brown coal combustion. These results provide, for the first time, essential data for the development of sodium release sub-models within large scale brown coal <b>boiler</b> Computational <b>Fluid</b> Dynamic (CFD) models.

40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis describes the fundamentals ofmathematical modeling for the industrial furnaces and boilersand {{presents the results}} from the numerical simulations of sometypical applications in advanced industrial furnaces andboilers. The main objective of this thesis work is to employcomputational fluid dynamics (CFD) technology as an effectivecomputer simulation tool to study and develop the newcombustion concepts, phenomena and processes in advancedindustrial furnaces and boilers. The applications concern onfrom retrofitted conventional grate boilers to the mostadvanced highly preheated and diluted air combustion (HPDAC) furnaces. In this work, several topics are specially concernedwhen applying CFD technology to combustion cases. These topicsare including grate bed model, NOxmodeling, mixing problem, air staging system, andhighly preheated and diluted air combustion technology. In thiswork, a black-box grate bed model is developed and used inmodeling of grate fired furnaces and boilers. It is based onthe thermodynamic calculations and a set of conservationequations of mass, energy of fuel and air on the grate bed. Oneof benefits of this bed model is simple and feasible to be putinto use in industry. For NOxmodeling, besides the thermal NO and prompt NO,the HCN route fuel NO has been employed to predict the fuel NOemissions in coal/biomass fired furnaces. In addition, based onNH 3 route of fuel NO formation, a SNCR scheme for NOxabatement has been proposed also. For mixingproblem, the concepts of global degree of mixing and individualdegree of mixing have been proposed and used successfully inpractical applications. The new definition of degree of mixingovercomes some shortages of existed mixing parameters, such asthe mixing factor and the degree of non-mixing, which arenon-normalized and may lose physical meaning in some regions ofthe system. A new air staging system has been studied. It isused to improve the secondary or over-fire air configuration,thus to reduce the pollutant emissions and to enhance thecombustion facilities' efficiencies. In this work, the airstaging system has been employed in coal and biomass combustionfor grate fired furnaces/boilers. The performance of the newair staging system has been evaluated and optimized by usingnumerical modeling method together with physical modelingmethod. Results show that the new air staging system has a goodpotential of improving the combustion quality and reducing thepollutant emissions in industrial furnaces and boilers. Recently, the highly preheated and diluted air combustiontechnology has been regarded as the new generation energytechnology for advanced industrial furnaces and boilers. Inthis work, the highly preheated and diluted air combustionphenomena have been studied by using different numericalmodels. A hybrid procedure of both the large eddy simulationusing subgrid-scale stress Smagorinsky model and the Reynoldsstress model with eddy dissipation model has been alsoinvestigated to study the dynamic combustion process under theconditions of highly preheated and diluted air combustion. Results show that HPDAC technology possesses advantages ofsaving energy and low NOxemission, thus it has high potential to be usedfor the next generation of industrial furnaces and boilers. Thelarge eddy simulation using subgrid-scale stress Smagorinskymodel together with Reynolds stress model / eddy dissipationmodel are possible to study the HPDAC dynamic process.

Harnessing the unique expertise of its members, the CCP has worked in collaboration with government bodies and more than 60 academic institutions, industry and leading environmental groups. Initiated in 2000, the overall objective of CCP is to deliver major cost reductions for CO 2 capture and demonstrate that geological storage is efficient, verifiable and secure. Phase 3 of The CO 2 Capture Project (CCP 3) has been undertaken during 2009 - 2014 and with continuing support of R&D work for capture and storage technologies at multiple levels of development, including exploratory research to demonstration. Demonstration {{of the next generation}} technologies being developed by CCP is a key aspect of this third phase of the project and several capture and storage technologies have been or will be deployed (or made deployment-ready) within the CCP 3 timeframe:•The regenerator of a large pilot Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) unit in a Brazilian refinery owned by Petrobras was retrofit to oxy-firing with CO 2 recycle. A successful demonstration was completed in 2012. •The retrofit to oxy-firing of a commercial Once Through Steam Generator (OTSG) used in oil sands extraction operations in Canada (duty of 50 million BTU/hr) was performed in 2013, following completion of a feasibility study by Praxair. A demonstration run is scheduled in early 2014 and the main results will be included in the conference paper. •Field deployment and performance assessments of new CO 2 storage monitoring techniques at third party pilot / demonstration sites include: a modular borehole monitoring (MBM) assembly at Citronelle Dome (Alabama), Borehole Gravity at Cranfield Field (Mississippi) and InSAR at Decatur (Illinois) and electromagnetics at Aquistore (Saskatchewan). Other R&D projects completed in 2013 or early 2014 with co-funding of the CCP include:•Investigation of novel oxygen carriers (none Nickel-based) for Chemical Looping Combustion. •Pilot testing of commercial burners for refinery crude process heaters in oxy-firing mode. •Prolonged laboratory test of palladium alloy membranes in Water Gas Shift operating conditions and design of a pilot membrane module. •Pilot and bench-scale testing of several novel solvents for post-combustion application, including non- aqueous and enzyme-enhanced solvents. •Geomechanical hysteresis of top seal from prior oil extraction processes and potential impacts on CO 2 storage containment•Fundamental studies of subsurface physico-chemical processes to simulation of through seal CO 2 leakage and intervention options. •Design of a bench-field scale “fracture sealing” experiment to test candidate sealant performanceSelected scenarios for application of the CCP capture technologies are:•Oil refinery (capture from steam <b>boilers,</b> process heaters, <b>fluid</b> catalytic crackers, hydrogen plants) •Steam production for extraction of heavy oils•Natural Gas Combined Cycle (NGCC) power stationThese represent major sources of CO 2 emissions for the CCP member companies and some of their customers. Storage venues may range from saline formations to CO 2 EOR and possibly unconventional gas reservoirs. Relevant findings and technologies may be leveraged for oil and gas exploration and production characterization and surveillance. An assessment of the performance and economics of state-of-the-art post combustion, oxy-firing and precombustion for the above applications has been carried out. Foster Wheeler was commissioned to conduct technical evaluation studies, while an in-house economic model was developed, which included capture, transportation, and storage costs. The objective of these studies was to provide material for a CO 2 capture handbook to be used to support CO 2 capture technology selection in the oil and gas industry. The technical/economical evaluation of novel technologies developed in CCP 3 was undertaken using the same procedure (third party performance evaluation and in-house economic model).

40|$|Combined Heat and Power Generation (CHP) or {{cogeneration}} {{has been}} considered worldwide as the major alternative to traditional energy systems in terms of signi ticant energy saving and environmental conservation. A renewable energy resource-fuelled CHP would deliver even more environmental benefits than a fossil tuel-driven CHP. Biomass {{is one of the}} renewable energy resources that plays an important role to the world primary energy supplies and can be used to fuel CHP systems. Many medium- and large-scale biomass-fired CHP plants have been demonstrated and commercialized in the world. However, biomass-fuelled microscale CHP (1 - 1 OkW c> which is suitable tor building applications has yet to be commercialised or demonstrated. The development and evaluation of a micro-CHP system operating on biomass energy {{has been the focus of}} this PhD research. It is an integral part of an externally funded research project which aims to develop and evaluate a novel, first-of-its-kind, micro-scale (l - 2 kWe) biomass-tired CHP system suitable for public and large domestic buildings' applications. The specific tasks of the present PhD research arc: To thermodynamically model the micro-scale biomass-fired CHP system with organic Rankine cycle (ORC) : different environment-friendly working fluids are to be modelled with the ORC processes. To experimentally evaluate the micro-scale biomass-tired CHP system in terms of power generation and combined heat and power pertormance. To experimentally investigate the combustion performance and NOx emissions of the biomass pellet boiler which is a key component of the micro-scale biomass-fired CHP system. The micro-scale biomass-tired CHP system with ORC developed by the research team of University of Nottingham including the author of this PhD thesis mainly consists of a biomass <b>boiler,</b> an ORC <b>fluid</b> evaporator, an ORC turbine, an alternator, a heat reeouperator and a condenser. The boiler produces hot water which transfers heat to the organic working tluid via the evaporator. The generated organic fluid vapour drives a turbine to rotate an alternator, producing power. The expanded organic fluid vapour leaving the turbine transfers some of its heat to the recouperator and then is condensed by cooling water which can be heated to around 40 - 50 °C for domestic washing and under-floor heating purposes. The main methodologies of the present PhD research are the thermodynamic modelling of the proposed micro-scale biomass-tired CHP system with ORC and the laboratory testing of the assembled micro-scale biomass-fired CHP system and its main components (biomass boiler, ORC turbine, alternator, heat exchangers etc.). Literature review has demonstrated that the biomass-fired micro-CHP systems for buildings present many advantages compared to conventional separate heating and power supply systems (e. g. a dedicated boiler for heating and grid for power supply) as they can present higher primary energy savings and lower CO 2 emissions. ORC is a suitable thermodynamic cycle that could be used for micro-CHP systems while operating with waste heat and renewable energy resources which are available at relative low temperatures. Thermodynamical modelling of the proposed micro-scale biomass-fired CHP system with ORC has been carried out and the results have been presented and discussed in the thesis. Three different environment-friendly working fluids, namely HFE 7000, HFE 7100 and n-pentane, have been modelled with various ORC process configurations. The laboratory testing of the assembled micro-scale biomass-fired CHP system and its main components (biomass boiler, ORC turbine, alternator, heat exchangers etc.) has been carried out initially with a 25 kW biomass boiler and then with a 50 kW biomass boiler. The main purpose of the laboratory testing has been to evaluate the main energy efficiencies (the electrical efficiency and the total CHP efficiency) of the assembled micro-CHP systems. The combustion performance and NOx emissions of each biomass boiler have also been investigated as the biomass boiler is a key component of the micro-scale biomass-tired CHP system. The experimental findings of these laboratory tests are presented and analysed in the thesis. Finally, the conclusions of the present PhD research have been given. The modelling results have shown that the electrical efficiency of the micro-CHP system depends on not only the modelling conditions but also the ORC fluid. A comparison of the three fluids generally follows the following order: n-pentane > HFE 7000 > HFE 7100. For the laboratory test, the 25 kW biomass boiler-driven micro-CHP system, having an ORC efficiency in the range of 2. 20 % - 2. 85 %, can generate electricity of 344. 6 W and heat of 20. 3 kW, corresponding to electricity generation efficiency 1. 17 % and CHP efficiency 86. 22 %.
