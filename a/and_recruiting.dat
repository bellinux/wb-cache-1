5|$|Evans {{sought to}} promote a form of nativist, Protestant nationalism. In {{addition}} to his white supremacist ideology, he fiercely condemned Catholicism, unionism, and communism, which were associated with recent immigrants from eastern and southern Europe.

However, they note that the political influence and membership gains he sought were transitory.

5|$|Khrushchev {{reached the}} Stalingrad Front in August 1942, {{soon after the}} start of the battle for the city.

Though he visited Stalin in Moscow on occasion, he remained in Stalingrad for much of the battle, and was nearly killed at least once. He proposed a counterattack, only to find that Zhukov and other generals had already planned Operation Uranus, a plan to break out from Soviet positions and encircle and destroy the Germans; it was being kept secret. Before Uranus was launched, Khrushchev spent much time checking on troop readiness and morale, interrogating Nazi prisoners, <b>and</b> <b>recruiting</b> some for propaganda purposes.|$|E

5|$|Stiller {{had a few}} minor {{roles in}} the early 1990s, in films such as Stella, Highway to Hell and in a cameo, The Nutt House.

The film was produced by Danny DeVito, who would later direct Stiller's 2003 film Duplex and produce his 2004 film Along Came Polly.

5|$|The nine-story building, {{built in}} 1977, {{was named for}} a federal judge and housed fourteenfederal agencies, {{including}} the DEA, ATF, Social Security Administration, <b>and</b> <b>recruiting</b> offices for the Army and Marine Corps. The Murrah building was chosen for its glass front—which was expected to shatter under {{the impact of the}} blast—and its adjacent large, open parking lot across the street, which might absorb and dissipate some of the force, and protect the occupants of nearby non-federal buildings. In addition, McVeigh believed that the open space around the building would provide better photo opportunities for propaganda purposes. The attack was planned to take place on April 19, 1995, to coincide with the anniversary of the Waco siege and the 220th anniversary of the Battles of Lexington and Concord.|$|E
