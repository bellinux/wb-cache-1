5|$|Victorious Boxers {{does not}} use a damage or life meter. Instead, visible damage {{can be seen on}} a boxer's face, which is most {{noticeable}} between rounds when the characters are sitting in their corners. The amount of damage taken is reflected by bruises, swelling, and black eyes on the characters' faces. Another sign of damage is the characters' speed of movement throughout the fight. The characters begin to move slower and the controls become less responsive to simulate fatigue. The more a boxer is hit or uses special moves, the more their stamina is affected. Distance is a factor in determining a punch's damage. For example, a jab thrown while next to an opponent will not do as much damage as it would at <b>arms</b> <b>length.</b> Also, right hooks do not do as much damage if the character is positioned to the opponent's left and vice versa.|$|E

40|$|Prior {{studies have}} argued and {{regularly}} found that cultural distance is {{negatively related to}} bilateral export flows, which are the sum of <b>arm’s</b> <b>length</b> and intra-firm exports. However, these macro-level studies overlook the firm-level insights that <b>arm’s</b> <b>length</b> exports are a substitute for <b>arm’s</b> <b>length</b> affiliate sales, and that firms’ choices between these substitutes are influenced by cultural distance. Moreover, intra-firm exports are a complement to <b>arm’s</b> <b>length</b> affiliate sales and hence likely to respond {{in the same way}} to cultural distance as such sales. The inclusion of intra-firm exports in export flows has thus obscured the effect of cultural distance on aggregate <b>arm’s</b> <b>length</b> exports. We overcome these conceptual and methodological deficiencies by examining how cultural distance influences aggregate <b>arm’s</b> <b>length</b> exports, while simultaneously considering its impact on aggregate <b>arm’s</b> <b>length</b> affiliate sales. Drawing on several strands of firm-level international business (IB) research, we argue that while <b>arm’s</b> <b>length</b> affiliate sales are likely to decline with cultural distance, this is not necessarily the case with <b>arm’s</b> <b>length</b> exports, whichmay in fact increase with cultural distance. Analyzing a panel dataset of US foreign affiliate sales and US exports to unaffiliated parties, we find that cultural distance negatively affects <b>arm’s</b> <b>length</b> affiliate sales but positively affects <b>arm’s</b> <b>length</b> exports. Our study thus shows that the explicit consideration of firm-level entry mode choices helps us better understand and explain macro-level IB activity...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper studies a {{multinational}} firm’s transfer price decisions in imperfectly competitive market settings. It investigates whether the firm’s optimal transfer price {{coincides with the}} <b>arm’s</b> <b>length</b> price and examines how the firm might respond if it is compelled to follow the <b>arm’s</b> <b>length</b> principle. The main findings are: (1) {{in the absence of}} tax transfer incentives, the firm’s optimal transfer price does not coincide with the <b>arm’s</b> <b>length</b> price. If the firm is compelled to follow the <b>arm’s</b> <b>length</b> principle, it has an incentive to circumvent the <b>arm’s</b> <b>length</b> principle by keeping two sets of books, one for internal management, and another for tax reporting purposes; (2) the <b>arm’s</b> <b>length</b> principle can affect the MNF’s decision on whether or not to foreclose its competitor. Absent profit shifting incentives, the firm will foreclose its downstream competitor. Imposing the <b>arm’s</b> <b>length</b> principle induces the firm to supply its competitor, but the firm can revert to its foreclosure decision by keeping two sets of books. If the firm’s upstream and downstream divisions face different tax rates, the firm’s foreclosure decision will be reversed if the <b>arm’s</b> <b>length</b> principle is enforced.

40|$|The <b>arm’s</b> <b>length</b> {{principle}} has {{now been}} for almost eighty years the basis for business income allocation in international tax. The principle permeates many of {{the provisions of the}} OECD Model, and in particular those who concern the attribution of income to permanent establishments, the relationship between associated enterprises and certain source tax limitations. Also, it is remarkable that, within the OECD Model, the <b>arm’s</b> <b>length</b> principle is attributed, explicitly or implicitly, predominance over non-discrimination provisions. In more recent years, the <b>arm’s</b> <b>length</b> based rules of the OECD Model have been progressively implemented in EU directives and in the Arbitration Convention. Not least, the <b>arm’s</b> <b>length</b> standard has lately become, even though in circumscribed instances, part of the VAT system. Notwithstanding this wide recognition, some difficulties have arisen in the coordination of such principle with the fundamental freedoms guaranteed by the EC Treaty (now TFEU). The Court of Justice, after having initially considered <b>arm’s</b> <b>length</b> based thin capitalization rules as being in breach of the freedom of establishment, has afterwards recognized that a difference in treatment between domestic and cross border transactions can be justified {{on the basis of the}} purpose to prevent tax avoidance. However, having framed national <b>arm’s</b> <b>length</b> based legislation in the scheme of the abuse of law may endanger the effectiveness of such legislation and, at the same time, seems to underestimate the necessity to find adequate remedies to double taxation which may derive from unilateral <b>arm’s</b> <b>length</b> based income adjustments. status: publishe...|$|R

Claudia Black and Michael Shanks protested against this intended story, as Shanks felt that [...] "here's always been this underlining, keeping [...] at <b>arms</b> <b>length</b> because {{of the fear of}} getting too close." [...] Cooper rewrote the scene to show Vala's vulnerability to Daniel, and have Daniel share his true feelings of a relationship. The actors decided to play the confrontation scene as genuinely as possible, with both characters being neither completely in-character nor totally out-of-character. The scene was rehearsed a lot and was filmed over the course of six hours. Cooper was nevertheless concerned that Daniel appeared too edgy and mean, although his feelings were motivated by the two years of torment with Vala, and losing his wife nearly ten years before. Daniel's line, [...] "You better not be messing with me", was only said in one take by Michael Shanks. Since Cooper prefers to follow up on such emotional scenes with a laugh, the immediate next scene shows Vala coming out of Daniel's room, where she encounters a disbelieving Mitchell jogging by. In Cooper's mind, Daniel held a crying Vala in another scene because she had gotten pregnant and had lost the baby. To contrast the obvious relationship between Daniel and Vala, Amanda Tapping and Christopher Judge subtly played their scenes as if their characters also had a romantic relationship.|$|E

Despite the concern in early season 9 that their relationship would stagnate and dumb down their characters, Shanks felt Vala brought out a side of Daniel {{that he had not}} had the chance to play before, and Black advocated the slow revelation of Vala's layers of denial. The writers continued to develop the friendship between Vala and Daniel throughout season 10, aiming not to lose their sexual chemistry. Michael Shanks stated that by [...] "Memento Mori", [...] "Daniel legitimately cares about Vala and has seen some sort of redemption in her and wants that process to continue." [...] From Black's point of view, Daniel offers [...] "an interesting window" [...] into [...] "Vala's external façade to be playful with people". He helps Vala grow as a person and forces her to [...] "develop coping mechanisms that allow her to be more adult and learn that it's OK to be honest and talk how you feel." [...] Asked about a possible romance between Vala and Daniel before the filming of the series finale, Black predicted that a consummation of the relationship would end badly in terms of both story and on-screen chemistry. When producer Robert C. Cooper presented his preliminary script for the series finale, [...] "Unending", both Black and Shanks protested his intended story of having Vala and Daniel sleep together without a confrontation. Shanks felt that [...] "here's always been this underlining, keeping [...] at <b>arms</b> <b>length</b> because of the fear of getting too close." [...] After Cooper rewrote the scene to increase Vala's vulnerability to Daniel, and have Daniel truthfully explain his feelings of a relationship, the actors decided to play the confrontation scene as genuinely as possible, with both characters being neither completely in-character nor totally out-of-character.|$|E
