He dates that trade between the Portuguese and the Wolof people of the Senegal region was opened around 1450 ("five years before I went on this voyage"). [...] Cadamosto had sought to trade Iberian horses for black slaves, the principal line of business at this resgate. Horses were highly valued on the Senegalese coast, and traded at a rate of between 9 and 14 slaves per horse.

5000|$|The Seri Wawasan Bridge is a {{longitudinally}} asymmetric cable‐stayed box-girder {{bridge with}} a inverted-Y shape concrete/steel pylon 96m high.

The back stay anchored at the (next-) highest point of the pylon is anchored at the curved backstay <b>anchorage</b> <b>point</b> (next-) nearest to the pylon, creating a crisscross‐over pattern from the side elevation, which adds to the aesthetic of the bridge.

5000|$|On {{her last}} fateful voyage {{on the evening}} of 3 December 1987, during {{resupply}} operations at Macquarie Island, bad weather blew up. The Nella Dan dragged her anchor and was driven aground just metres off the island. The accident happened while transferring fuel from the ship to the sub-Antarctic station at Macquarie Island. Other cargo unloading had ceased because of strong winds and high seas. A definitive cause of the accident was never determined, it was reported that the Nella Dan dragged her anchor in very heavy seas while at the normal <b>anchorage</b> <b>point</b> in Buckles Bay. The vessel was rapidly washed onto rocks close to the research station it was supplying. Damage to the vessel was immediate and serious, the ships hull was holed in two places and water flooded the engine room.

5000|$|The {{coast line}} between Fort-Liberté Bay and Point Yaquezi is about 8 mi. It {{has a low}} sandy beach. It has reefs with {{mangrove}} forests, and two hills (spaced at 0.5 mi) about 3.5 mi {{to the west of}} the entrance to the bay. The hills are the markers for the entrance to the port. Land locked, Fort-Liberté Bay is spread over a length of5 mi in the east-west direction and has a breadth of about of 1 mi. The shallow waters that extends to 1 mi provides for adequate draft and safe anchorage conditions. The entrance to the fort is stated to be [...] "about 1.25 mi long with not less than 15 fathoms depth of water in the fairway but is narrow and tortuous, so that a sailing vessel entering requires the wind to be well to the northward of east, and its leaving must have a commanding land breeze." [...] The coast line from the entrance to the bay extends to 6.5 mi in an easterly direction extending to Manzanillo Bay. There is no wharf. The tides are high - spring rise is 5.75 ft and neap is 3.5 ft. Vessels anchor at the port in 12 fathoms deep water which provides manoeuvring space of 600 - 1200 yard m on the east and northeast direction of the Bayon Islet, which is in the midst of the bay. Another <b>anchorage</b> <b>point</b> with 9 fathoms depth is found to the east of the fort. The tidal current at the entrance is said to be low in the morning hours when it is the best time to enter the port.|$|E
50|$|With the monsoon, Portuguese India armadas usually {{arrived in}} India in early September (sometimes late August). Because {{of the wind}} pattern, they usually made {{landfall}} around Anjediva island (Angediva). From there, the armada furled their square sails and proceed with lateen sails south along the Malabar coast of India {{to the city of}} Cochin (Cochim, Kochi) in Kerala. Cochin was the principal spice port accessible to the Portuguese, it had the earliest Portuguese factory and fort in India, and served as the headquarters of Portuguese government and operations in India for the first decades. However, this changed after the Portuguese conquest of Goa in 1510. The capture of Goa had been largely motivated by the desire to find a replacement for Anjediva as the first anchoring point for the armadas. Anjediva had proven itself to be far from ideal. The island was generally undersupplied - it contained only a few fishing villages - but the armada ships were often forced to sojourn there for long periods, usually for repair or to await for better winds to carry them down to Cochin. Anjediva island also lay in precarious pirate-infested waters, on the warring frontier between Muslim Bijapur and Hindu Vijaynagar, which frequently threatened it. The same winds which carried the armada down to Cochin prevented Portuguese squads from Cochin racing up to rescue it. The Portuguese had tried setting up a fort in Anjediva, but it was captured and dismantled by forces on behalf of Bijapur. As a result, the Portuguese governor Afonso de Albuquerque decided the nearby island-city of Goa was preferable and forcibly seized it in 1510. Thereafter Goa, with its better harbor and greater supply base, served as the first <b>anchorage</b> <b>point</b> of Portuguese armadas upon arriving in India. Although Cochin, with its important spice markets, remained the ultimate destination, and was still the official Portuguese headquarters in India until the 1530s, Goa was more favorably located relative to Indian Ocean wind patterns and served as its military-naval center. The docks of Goa were soon producing their own carracks for the India run back to Portugal and for runs to further points east.|$|E

The convex shape may be evidence that the base of each structure was tubular in life, anchoring like other integumentary structures such as Mammalian hair or Avian feathers into a follicle. Moreover, the proximity of each structure to its corresponding vertebra suggests that a thick layer of soft tissue, possibly including a follicle, surrounded each base.|$|R
