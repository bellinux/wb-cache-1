40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the influence of}} different types of posts <b>and</b> <b>cores</b> on the final color of the IPS-Emperss 2 crown. Methods: Five types of posts <b>and</b> <b>cores</b> (Cerapost with Empress cosmo, Cerapost with composite resin, gilded Ni-Cr alloy, gold alloy and Ni-Cr alloy) were made. The shifts in color of three points of IPS-Empress 2 crown surface (cervical, middle and incisal) with different posts <b>and</b> <b>cores</b> was measured with a spectroradiometer (PR- 650). Results: The L* a* b* values of zirconium oxide and gilded Ni- Cr alloy posts <b>and</b> <b>cores</b> with ceramic crown were the highest. The L* a* values of zirconium oxide posts composite cores were higher while the b* values were lower. The L* a* b* values of Ni-Cr alloy were lower than that of gold alloy and were the lowest. Conclusion: In combination with IPS- Empress 2 crown, zirconium oxide posts are suitable for routine use in the anterior dentition, and gilded Ni- Cr alloy and gold alloy posts <b>and</b> <b>cores</b> can be recommended for clinical practice. Ni-Cr alloy posts <b>and</b> <b>cores</b> can not be recommended for clinical practice...|$|R

5|$|A helical {{resonator}} {{is similar}} to a stub, in that it requires a distributed element model to represent it, but is actually built using lumped elements. They are built in a non-planar format and consist of a coil of wire, on a former <b>and</b> <b>core,</b> and connected only at one end. The device is usually in a shielded can with a hole in the top for adjusting the core. It will often look physically very similar to the lumped LC resonators used for a similar purpose. They are most useful in the upper VHF and lower UHF bands whereas stubs are more often applied in the higher UHF and SHF bands.|$|E
5|$|The {{object of}} the game is to get the highest score. There are two play modes: Zen <b>and</b> <b>Core.</b> There is a 90-second time limit in Zen mode. In Core mode, players play until the screen fills with poorly placed tetrominos, similar to Tetris. Core has two difficulties. On the easiest difficulty, three-letter words suffice, but harder modes require five-letter words at a minimum. A score {{multiplier}} grows as players maintain a combo of multiple words created in succession, and resets if players are too slow. Scores are uploaded to Game Center.|$|E

Lacking confidence in Pinkava's story development, Pixar management replaced him with Bird in 2005. Bird was attracted to the film because of the outlandishness of the concept and the conflict that drove it: that rats feared kitchens, yet a rat wanted to work in one. Bird was also delighted that the film could be made a highly physical comedy, with the character of Linguini providing endless fun for the animators. Bird rewrote the story, with a change in emphasis. He killed off Gusteau, gave larger roles to Skinner and Colette, and also changed the appearance of the rats to be less anthropomorphic.|$|E
5|$|Though Haley is ostensibly a ghostwriter on the Autobiography, modern {{scholars}} tend {{to treat}} him as an essential <b>and</b> <b>core</b> collaborator who acted as an invisible figure {{in the composition of}} the work. He minimized his own voice, and signed a contract to limit his authorial discretion in favor of producing what looked like verbatim copy. However, MalcolmX biographer Manning Marable considers this view of Haley as simply a ghostwriter as a deliberate narrative construction of black scholars of the day who wanted to see the book as a singular creation of a dynamic leader and martyr. Marable argues that a critical analysis of the Autobiography, or the full relationship between MalcolmX and Haley, does not support this view; he describes it instead as a collaboration.|$|E

5|$|With the Panthers out of playoff {{contention}} {{late in the}} season, {{the team}} began trading away numerous veterans <b>and</b> <b>core</b> players. At the NHL trade deadline, on February 28, 2011, Higgins was dealt to the Vancouver Canucks in exchange for defensive prospect Evan Oberg and a third-round draft pick in 2013. The Canucks had reportedly been interested in a different Panthers player, but with a minute left until the trade deadline, Panthers Assistant General Manager Mike Santos called the Canucks back and offered Higgins. In 48 games with the Panthers, he had recorded 11 goals and 23 points. Injured with a hand injury {{at the time of}} the trade, he did not debut with the Canucks until March 10. He scored his first two goals as a Canuck on March 27 in a 4–1 win against the Columbus Blue Jackets. He completed the season with 13 goals and 28 points in 62 games between Florida and Vancouver. While Higgins played the majority of the regular season with the Canucks as a bottom-six forward, by the playoffs, he was playing on the second line centered by Ryan Kesler. Entering the post-season as the Presidents' Trophy champions, the Canucks held the first seed in the West. After eliminating the Chicago Blackhawks, Nashville Predators and San Jose Sharks in the first three rounds, the Canucks advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals. Facing the Boston Bruins, the series went to a seventh game, which the Canucks lost 4–0. Following the Canucks' defeat, it was revealed that several Canucks players had been playing with injuries, including Higgins. His injury occurred in the second round against the Predators, when he blocked a shot with his skate, breaking his foot. Over 25 playoff games, Higgins recorded four goals and eight points. Three of his goals were game-winners, tying him with Geoff Courtnall (1994) for the most in a single playoff season by a Canucks player.|$|E

Since 2001, Institute of Exploration Techniques made significant progress on gas hydrate drilling <b>and</b> <b>coring.</b> In 2005, China started research on the drilling <b>coring</b> system <b>and</b> drilling techniques for its application to the permafrost gas hydrate. In the 2008, first testing of drilling <b>and</b> <b>coring</b> with the new wire-line pressure <b>and</b> temperature <b>coring</b> system for the permafrost gas hydrate in Qing-Tibet Plateau, Qilian Mountain, above sea level of 4200 m was conducted to collect gas hydrate samples from 130 m to 400 m depth [...] In order to confirm the presence of gas hydrate, drilling <b>and</b> <b>coring</b> continued in 2009 and 2010, and additional gas hydrate samples were acquired and tested in the laboratory. In order to use the gas hydrate resource, additional testing of the gas hydrate in the permafrost was conducted with depressurization and reservoir heating in September, 2011. During this testing, electro-magnetic, solar energy and vapor heating methods were used, and the reservoir pressure was decreased by the submarine pump by bringing the subsurface water to the surface. The testing was considered successful. The pressure <b>and</b> temperature <b>coring</b> system, the drilling and the production processes and the results are described in the paper...|$|R

The size distribution curves were unimodal and positively skewed. The size distribution curve of the diffuse plaques was shifted towards larger plaques while those of the neuritic <b>and</b> <b>cored</b> plaques were shifted towards smaller plaques. The neuritic/diffuse plaque ratio was maximal in the 11 – 30 micron size class and the cored/ diffuse plaque ratio in the 21 – 30 micron size class. The size distribution curves of {{the three types of}} plaque deviated significantly from a log-normal distribution. Distributions expressed on a logarithmic scale were ‘leptokurtic’, i. e. with excess of observations near the mean. These results suggest that SP in AD grow to within a more restricted size range than predicted from a log-normal model. In addition, there appear to be differences in the patterns of growth of diffuse, primitive <b>and</b> <b>cored</b> plaques. If neuritic <b>and</b> <b>cored</b> plaques develop from earlier diffuse plaques, then smaller diffuse plaques {{are more likely to be}} converted to mature plaques...|$|R
