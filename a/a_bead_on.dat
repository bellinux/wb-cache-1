25|$|Newton's laws can be {{difficult}} to apply to many kinds of motion because the motion is limited by constraints. For example, <b>a</b> <b>bead</b> <b>on</b> an abacus is constrained to move along its wire and a pendulum bob is constrained to swing at a fixed distance from the pivot. Many such constraints can be incorporated by changing the normal Cartesian coordinates to a set of generalized coordinates that may be fewer in number. Refined mathematical methods have been developed for solving mechanics problems in generalized coordinates. They introduce a generalized momentum, also known as the canonical or conjugate momentum, that extends the concepts of both linear momentum and angular momentum. To distinguish it from generalized momentum, the product of mass and velocity is also referred to as mechanical, kinetic or kinematic momentum. The two main methods are described below.|$|E

Stottlemeyer confronts Cage, who says the only way he will allow access to Tennyson is if Monk solves the ambassador's murder.|$|E

2500|$|Less {{impressed}} was GameSpot, who {{awarded the}} GameCube version 6.5 out of 10 and the PS2 version 5.4. They found the technical {{issues of the}} game to be too significant; [...] "Bounty Hunter suffers from an array of technical problems that have plagued other third-person action games. You can move the camera perspective using the right analog stick, but the camera will still cause you some major headaches when in tight corridors or when trying to draw <b>a</b> <b>bead</b> <b>on</b> a specific enemy. Often it'll automatically swivel to point you in entirely the wrong direction. Clipping and collision-detection issues also abound." [...] They also criticized the graphics and the overall gameplay, concluding that [...] "Star Wars Bounty Hunter may have all the basic ingredients needed for a solid third-person action game, but it falls flat in the execution and is far too often cumbersome, confusing, or {{in some other way}} un-fun to be recommendable on its own merits. Serious Star Wars aficionados should enjoy the game's story, but they'll be forced to slog through a lot of tedious action to see how it pans out." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lili's {{official}} {{style is}} street fighting, combined with gymnastic maneuvers such as flips, cartwheels and handstands. Mike Reilly of Game Revolution {{said in his}} 2006 review of Tekken 5: Dark Resurrection that Lili [...] "takes {{a good deal more}} practice to master", an issue he opined was offset by the presence of an in-game training mode. Brett Elston of GamesRadar commented on Lili's fighting style in the game: [...] "She doesn't really have a definable combat style, so it's mostly all flash and sexy high kicks ... her quick movements and wide-reaching legs make her ideal for first-timers—those same dance-like attacks also make it hard to get <b>a</b> <b>bead</b> <b>on</b> her next move". According to IGN, Lili's counterattacks, juggles and wall fighting in Tekken 6 are known to cause a lot of damage, but she was [...] "lacking in the low attack department and many of her crush attacks will leave her vulnerable." [...] Mike Harradence of PlayStation Universe wrote in 2012 that Lili's [...] "quirky yet ultimately unique style provides ample opportunity for juggles and she can mix it up {{with the best of them}} thanks to an arrange of low-mid attacks." [...] Tom Goulter of GamesRadar said of the character in Tekken Tag Tournament 2: [...] "Lili is one of the series' less fleet-footed characters, with a gymnastic-influenced style that favors precision over quickness." ...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the bead model: <b>beads</b> are {{threaded}} <b>on</b> <b>a</b> {{set of wires}} on the plane represented by parallel straight lines. We add the constraint that between two consecutive <b>beads</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> wire, there must be exactly one <b>bead</b> <b>on</b> each neighboring wire. We construct a one-parameter family of Gibbs measures <b>on</b> the <b>bead</b> configurations that are uniform in a certain sense. When endowed {{with one of these}} measures, this model is shown to be a determinantal point process, whose marginal on each wire is the sine process (given by eigenvalues of large hermitian random matrices). We prove then that this process appears as a limit of any dimer model on a planar bipartite graph when some weights degenerate. 1 Introduction and presentation of the bead model We consider the collection of configurations of <b>beads</b> strung <b>on</b> <b>an</b> infinite collection of parallel threads lying <b>on</b> the plane. <b>A</b> <b>bead</b> configuration <b>on</b> these threads gives a configuration of points on Z × R.
