25|$|In the 2006 regulations, the u-value was {{replaced}} {{as the primary}} measure of energy efficiency by the Dwelling Carbon Dioxide Emission Rate (DER), an estimate of carbon dioxide emissions per m² of floor area. This is calculated using the Government's Standard <b>Assessment</b> <b>Procedure</b> for Energy Rating of Dwellings (SAP 2005).|$|E
25|$|A highly publicised {{extension}} to the experiment, {{in which a}} simpler array was implanted into the arm of Warwick's wife—with the ultimate aim of one day creating a form of telepathy or empathy using the Internet to communicate the signal from afar—was also successful in-so-far as it resulted in the first direct and purely electronic communication between the nervous systems of two humans. Finally, {{the effect of the}} implant on Warwick's hand function was measured using the University of Southampton Hand <b>Assessment</b> <b>Procedure</b> (SHAP). It was feared that directly interfacing with the nervous system might cause some form of damage or interference, but no measurable effect nor rejection was found. Indeed, nerve tissue grew around the electrode array, enclosing the sensor.|$|E
25|$|While the u-value ceased {{being the}} sole {{consideration}} in 2006, u-value limits {{similar to those}} in the 2002 regulations still apply, but are no longer sufficient by themselves. The DER, and TER (Target Emission rate) calculated through either the UK Government's Standard <b>Assessment</b> <b>Procedure</b> for Energy Rating of Dwellings (SAP rating), 2005 edition, or the newer SBEM (*Simplified Building Energy Model) which is aimed at non-dwellings, became the only acceptable calculation methods. Several commercial energy modeling software packages have now also been verified as producing acceptable evidence by the BRE Global & UK Government. Calculations using previous versions of SAP had been an optional way of demonstrating compliance since 1991(?). They are now a statutory requirement (B. Reg.17C et al.) for all building regulations applications, involving new dwelling/buildings and large extensions to existing non-domestic buildings.|$|E

40|$|Mkoba Teachers College {{is one of}} {{thirteen}} Primary school Teachers Colleges in Zimbabwe offering a University of Zimbabwe Diploma in Education programme comprising Theory of Education, Academic Studies, and Professional Studies. This study sought to investigate the validity of current <b>assessment</b> <b>procedures</b> in Professional Studies. Results of the study revealed historical influences upon <b>assessment</b> <b>procedures</b> at Mkoba. Over the years assessment has been by way of two course work assignments in Syllabus B, an end-of-year examination in Syllabus A, and a research of limited scope. The study tended to indicate the need to amplify the scope of <b>assessment</b> <b>procedures</b> beyond the two course work assignments, the end-of-year examination and the research of limited scope. Despite these indications, an analysis of certification results at Mkoba for the period 1976 to 1996 showed that 5955 good quality professionals were produced.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss the unique {{influences}} of ethics <b>assessment</b> <b>procedures</b> on comparative qualitative research. These influences are particularly pronounced when researchers are from different disciplines and in different countries. Focusing on our experience conducting {{a study on the}} perceptions of young people regarding HIV/AIDS in two countries (Italy and Canada), we describe the impact of the ethics <b>assessment</b> <b>procedures</b> in our respective countries on recruitment, sampling and comparability of findings. We also raise issues related to differences in ethics assessment processes from a disciplinary perspective. We conclude by suggesting that our theory of technique approach, which focuses on studying how the choices made in research implementation influence the study findings, should be extended to include the impact of ethics <b>assessment</b> <b>procedures.</b> © 2010 Taylor & Francis...|$|R
40|$|Project (Ed. S., School Psychology) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2012 Recent {{studies suggest}} that current {{perceptions}} regarding the validity of typical procedures utilized in functional behavior assessment may be inaccurate. In particular, descriptive <b>assessment</b> <b>procedures</b> appear to be heavily biased toward indicating a maintaining contingency of attention, and {{have been shown to}} have less validity than indirect measures such as the Functional Analysis Screening Tool. Given these findings, school personnel responsible for conducting functional behavior assessments should have access to alternative <b>assessment</b> <b>procedures</b> with improved validity. Experimental functional analyses offer one method that may be acceptable; this project seeks to develop a presentation that will provide participants with training in several alternative <b>assessment</b> <b>procedures</b> based on the experimental model for accurate identification of behavioral function through systematic manipulation of environmental variables.

40|$|The correct {{evaluation}} of seismic {{vulnerability of the}} existing building stock is a key issue for every earthquake prone Country; the need for reliable decision making tools for the assessment and retrofitting of the existing building stock is widely recognized. Still, the applicability, effectiveness, accuracy of currently codified seismic <b>assessment</b> <b>procedures</b> strongly vary, depending on {{the features of the}} assessed structures, and often also on the engineering judgement and knowledge of the applicator. Moreover, time and costs constraints, to which the <b>assessment</b> <b>procedures</b> are necessarily bound, pose further issues as to the details and immediateness of the implementation of such analyses. In the paper, a critical review of the most widespread currently codified seismic <b>assessment</b> <b>procedures</b> is carried out, with reference to the case study of a plan-wise irregular r. c. frame structure which underwent extensive pseudodynamic testing, both in the ¿as-built¿ and in retrofitted configurations, in the framework of the activity of the ELSA Laboratory of the JRC.
