50|$|Sunbeam {{was built}} for Thomas Brassey by Bowdler & Chaffer of Seacombe, from a design by St Clare Byrne. She was a three-masted topsail-yard schooner, iron framed and with teak skin. Length 159 ft, beam 27.5 ft, weight 532 tons. The sail area was 9,000 square yards. The yacht had an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>compound</b> steam engine of 70 hp that {{developed}} {{a top speed of}} just over 10 knots. The bunkers could hold eighty tons of coal and although primarily a sailing vessel, she could steam for approximately 20 days without refuelling. When not in steam, the funnel would be lowered and the propeller feathered to reduce drag. Unlike many of the luxury yachts of the time, Sunbeam had been designed for long distance and deep sea journeys. The accommodation for the owners and their guests, however, was far from Spartan, with rooms fashioned in a typical Victorian drawing-room style. The name Sunbeam came from the nickname they had given to their daughter - Constantine Alberta Brassey - who had died in 1873 from scarlet fever.|$|E

The addition of 20  % of glycerol to lignite generated H 2 sixfold higher than lignite pyrolysis (Manara and Zabaniotou 2013). Similar to lignite, olive kernel pyrolysis exhibited an increment of 11.6  % in the concentration of H 2 when 25  % of the crude glycerol was added (Skoulou et al. 2012). Besides the increment in H 2 concentration, glycerol also increased the concentration of light hydrocarbons in Syngas.

40|$|Hydrogels {{have been}} widely applied for {{biomedical}} applications, such as protein delivery and tissue engineering, due to their similarity with the extracellular matrix. Hydrogels are water-swollen, insoluble polymer networks. Their high water content renders them compatible with living tissue and proteins and their rubbery nature minimizes damage to the surrounding tissue. Conventionally, hydrogels are preformed and implanted in the body. More recently, hydrogels have been formed in situ under physiological conditions by mixing liquid precursors. These hydrogels are preferred over preformed hydrogels, since cells and bioactive compounds may be easily mixed with the precursor solutions prior to gelation. Moreover, in situ gelation allows for minimally invasive surgery and for the preparation of complex shapes. Hydrogels are formed by physical or chemical crosslinking. Physical crosslinks are formed by noncovalent interactions, such as hydrophobic and ionic interactions and stereocomplexation. Physical crosslinking generally proceeds under mild conditions, thus enabling in situ hydrogel formation and allowing the entrapment of labile compounds. The integrity of physically crosslinked hydrogels may however be lost upon a change in physical conditions. Chemically crosslinked hydrogels are formed by covalent bonds by reaction between functional groups. Most commonly, these hydrogels have been formed by radical chain polymerization of (meth) acrylate derived polymers initiated by photoirradiation.

40|$|The rampant {{spread of}} {{antibiotic}} resistant bacteria has spurred interest in alternative strategies for developing next-generation antibacterial therapies. As such, {{there has been}} growing interest in cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMPs) and their therapeutic applications. Modification of CAMPs via conjugation to <b>auxiliary</b> <b>compounds,</b> including small molecule drugs, is {{a new approach to}} developing effective, broad-spectrum antibacterial agents with novel physicochemical properties and versatile antibacterial mechanisms. Here, we’ve explored design parameters for engineering CAMPs conjugated to small molecules with favorable physicochemical and antibacterial properties by covalently affixing a fluoroquinolone antibiotic, levofloxacin, to the ten-residue CAMP Pep- 4. Relative to the unmodified Pep- 4, the conjugate was found to demonstrate substantially increased antibacterial potency under high salt concentrations. Historically, it has been observed that most CAMPs lose antibacterial effectiveness in such high ionic strength environments, a fact that has presented a challenge to their development as therapeutics. Physicochemical studies revealed that P 4 LC was more hydrophobic than Pep- 4, while mechanistic findings indicated that the conjugate was more effective at disrupting bacterial membrane integrity. Although the inherent antibacterial effect of the incorporated levofloxacin molecules {{did not appear to be}} substantially realized in this conjugate, these findings nevertheless suggest that covalent attachment of small molecule antibiotics with favorable physicochemical properties to CAMPs could be a promising strategy for enhancing peptide performance and overall therapeutic potential. These results have broader applicability to the development of future CAMP-antibiotic conjugates for potential therapeutic applications...|$|R

An approach widely used is making use of chiral <b>auxiliary</b> <b>compounds.</b> In this work it is showed the synthesis of highly optically pure rigid polycyclic compounds from the Diels-Alder adduct 1. Compounds 1 - 3 were prepared as described by Ito et. al. [1]. The alcohol (-) - 3 was obtained by biotransformation of diketone 2 with Mucor ramosissimus, e. e. > 99 % (60 %). The polycyclic halides 4 - 6 were synthesized (60 - 97 %) after treatment of alcohol (-) - 3 with NBS, NIS and, NCS in dichloromethane, respectively. Compound 7 was prepared by reaction with p-toluenesulfonic acid, whilst 8 was prepared by treatment of (-) - 3 with m-chloroperbenzoic acid. The strained polycylic alcohols 9 - 13 will be achieved by reduction of ketones 4 - 8 with NaBH 4. All compounds were identified by 1 H and 13 C NMR spectroscopy. Due to intrinsic rigidity of the synthesized polycyclic, they could be of use as chiral auxiliary agents. Prochiral substrates can be readily attached by many ways to C- 3 or through hydroxyl group found in compounds 8 - 13. The stereo-dirigent potential of these polycyclic can also be increased by directly or indirectly introduction of many groups at position C- 3, or at adjacent positions to carbonyl or hydroxyl at C- 3 and C- 10. </p...|$|R

No alpha-HCH biodegradation was detected at temperatures below 4 degrees C and above 40 degrees C.

40|$|This thesis investigates {{injection}} molding from an environmental standpoint, yielding a system-level environmental {{analysis of the}} process. There are three main objectives: analyze the energy consumption trends in {{injection molding}} machinery, explore the environmental performance of different technological alternatives, and provide a transparent life cycle inventory (LCI) identifying the mayor players in terms of environmental impact. The choice of injection molding machine type (hydraulic, hybrid or all-electric) has a substantial impact on the specific energy consumption (SEC), energy used per kg of processed polymer. The SEC values for hydraulic, hybrid and all-electric machines analyzed are 19. 0, 13. 2 and 12. 6 MJ/kg respectively (including <b>auxiliaries,</b> <b>compounding</b> and the inefficiency of the electric grid). For hydraulic and hybrid machines SEC seems to exhibit a decreasing behavior with increasing throughput. This derives from spreading fixed energy costs over more kilograms of polymer as throughput increases. For all-electric machines SEC is constant with throughput. As viscosity and specific heat capacity increase so does SEC. Finally, SEC varies greatly with part shape. The thinner and the greater the projected area of the part the greater the SEC. (cont.) When the polymer production stage {{is included in the}} analysis, the energy consumption values increase up to 100 MJ/kg. After polymer production, injection molding and extrusion have the greatest environmental impact in the whole LCI. The overall injection molding energy consumption (excluding polymer production) in the U. S. on a yearly basis amounts to 2. 06 x 108 GJ. This value is of similar magnitude to the overall U.

The process of reanalysis that took place over time bleached the semantics of stare so that when used in combination with the gerund the form became solely a grammatical marker of subject and tense (e.g. sto = subject first person singular, present; stavo = subject first person singular, past), no longer a lexical verb with the semantics of 'stand' (not unlike the <b>auxiliary</b> in <b>compound</b> tenses that once meant 'have, possess', but is now semantically empty: j'ai écrit, ho scritto, he escrito, etc.). Whereas sto scappando would once have been semantically strange at best (?'I stay escaping'), once grammaticalization was achieved, collocation with a verb of inherent mobility was no longer contradictory, and sto scappando could and did become the normal way to express 'I am escaping'.

Racemic versions of several of these compounds (most notably the para methoxy 19 and unsubstituted 26) were produced in a one pot procedure. Compound 19 was acylated with several different alpha-bromo acids and evaluated as a chiral auxiliary in DKR reactions with a number of primary and secondary amines.
