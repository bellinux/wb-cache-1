Because the unit originated in Battle Creek, and its number matched that of the freeway, the Legislature added the designation by passing Public Act305 of 2002.

40|$|Context: Videofluoroscopy in {{operated}} {{cleft palate}} patients. Aims: To determine {{the existence of}} <b>an</b> optimal <b>resting</b> velopharyngeal (VP) gap in operated cleft palate patients Settings and Design: A retrospective analysis of lateral view videofluoroscopy of operated cleft palate patients. Materials and Methods: A total of 117 cases of operated cleft palate underwent videofluoroscopy between 2006 and 2011. The lateral view of videofluoroscopy was utilised in the study. A retrospective analysis of the lateral view of videofluoroscopy of these 117 patients was performed to analyse the resting VP gap {{and its relationship to}} VP closure. Statistical analysis used: None. Results: Of the 117 cases, 35 had <b>a</b> <b>resting</b> gap of less than 6 mm, 34 had <b>a</b> <b>resting</b> gap between 6 and 10 mm and 48 patients had <b>a</b> <b>resting</b> gap of more than 10 mm. Conclusions: The conclusive finding was that almost all the patients with <b>a</b> <b>resting</b> gap of 10 mm (group A) did not achieve VP closure on phonation, thus having full-blown VPI. Therefore, it can be concluded that the ideal resting VP gap is approximately 6 mm so as to get the maximal chance of VP closure and thus prevent VPI...|$|R
