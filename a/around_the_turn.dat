5|$|Across Britain, many hill forts {{fell out}} of use in the 100years <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> of the millennium. It has been {{suggested}} that this, and the contemporary change in material culture of the Britons (such as the introduction of coinage and cemeteries and an increase in craft industries), was caused by increased interaction with the Roman Empire. The developing industries may have resulted in a shift away from the hill fort elites, whose power was based on agriculture. Such change is not as obvious in Dorset {{as it is in the}} rest of Britain, but there is a trend for abandonment of hill forts in the area and a proliferation of small undefended farmsteads, indicating a migration of the population.|$|E

The conflict started when Pappagallo returned from prison and found Alfano in control of his former territory. Other sources mention that after the death of Cappuccio, Giuseppe Chirico, 'o Granatiere (The Grenadier), from the Porta San Gennaro neighbourhood was elected.

5|$|From about 200,000 in the 1900 Census, Minneapolis {{soared to}} its highest {{population}} recorded in 1950 of over 521,000 people. The main {{growth of the}} city was in part due to an organized private streetcar system. With 140 million passengers by 1920, the streetcars ran down important roads extending from Downtown Minneapolis. Neighborhood residential development out of the core mostly dates <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> of the century {{as a result of this}} system. This growth also allowed Minneapolis to annex land from neighboring villages and townships which subsequently pushed the incorporation of today's inner ring suburbs.|$|E

5|$|Instrumentalism {{became popular}} among {{physicists}} <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> of the 20th century, after which logical positivism defined {{the field for}} several decades. Logical positivism accepts only testable statements as meaningful, rejects metaphysical interpretations, and embraces verificationism (a set of theories of knowledge that combines logicism, empiricism, and linguistics to ground philosophy on a basis consistent with examples from the empirical sciences). Seeking to overhaul all of philosophy and convert it to a new scientific philosophy, the Berlin Circle and the Vienna Circle propounded logical positivism in the late 1920s.|$|E

In addition to Kommandøren, which was seen as the flagship of the company's fleet, Lærdal, Balder and Stavenes were built between 1876 and 1904. The company sailed on cargo/passenger routes in Western Norway. Kommandøren was the largest of the new-builds, and was considered the grandest of the company vessels.|$|E

40|$|Inflation near {{a maximum}} of the {{potential}} is studied when non-local derivative operators {{are included in the}} inflaton Lagrangian. Such terms can impose additional sources of friction on the field. For an arbitrary spacetime geometry, these effects can be quantified in terms of a local field theory with a potential whose curvature <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>turning</b> point is strongly suppressed. This implies that a prolonged phase of slow-roll inflation can be achieved with potentials that are otherwise too steep to drive quasi-exponential expansion. We illustrate this mechanism within the context of p-adic string theory. Comment: 4 page...|$|R
