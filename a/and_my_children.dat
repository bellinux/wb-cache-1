500|$|The cast {{included}} some notable real-world strippers such as Pandora Peaks. Rhames plays a bouncer named Shad. The filmmakers, in trying actors out for Shad's part, looked for someone [...] "at least 6'2 and physically massive...any ethnicity." [...] (Rhames is African American). Reynolds played Congressman Dilbeck, and he based his performance after politicians he knew {{in his early}} life, through his father, a police chief. Reynolds was not an actor that the filmmakers originally had in mind for the part, but Reynolds wanted it, contacted Castle Rock head Rob Reiner, and traveled to Miami to audition. [...] He accepted a salary lower than what he had made in his earlier career. Moore's own daughter Rumer Willis, who was 7 years old when the film was released, played Erin's daughter Angela. As Moore explained, [...] "she [...] wanted it so badly" [...] that Moore asked that Willis be considered for the part. In reality this required Willis to see Moore dancing topless, for {{a scene in which}} Angela sees Erin performing. [...] However, Moore said that this was acceptable, as [...] "We don't shame the body, we encourage the body as something beautiful and natural, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>children</b> bathe with me, and I walk around naked." ...|$|E
2500|$|My friend Brian Johnson said {{of me that}} I'd {{never met}} a {{religion}} I didn't like. [...] That's why I've tried to correct that impression [...] because I very much feel part of that tradition and I practise that <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>children</b> practise it, so that was never in question. The investigations that I've done into other spiritual systems have certainly illuminated and enriched my understanding of my own tradition.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the role}} of writing in her life, she says: [...] "I think of writing simply in terms of pleasure. It's the most {{important}} thing in my life, making things. Much as I love my husband <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>children,</b> I love them only because I am the person who makes these things. I, who I am, is the person that has the project of making a thing. Well, that's putting it pompously – but constructing. I do see it in sort of three-dimensional structures. And because that person does that all the time, that person is able to love all these people." ...|$|E

2500|$|D'Albert's friends {{included}} Richard Strauss, Hans Pfitzner, Engelbert Humperdinck, Ignatz Waghalter and Gerhart Hauptmann, the dramatist. He {{was married}} six times and had eight children. The first wife was Louise Salingré. The second, from 1892 to 1895, was the Venezuelan pianist, singer and composer Teresa Carreño, herself much married and considerably older than d'Albert. D'Albert and Carreño were {{the subject of}} a famous joke: [...] "Come quick! Your children <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>children</b> are quarrelling again with our children!" [...] The line, however, has also been attributed to others. His later wives were mezzo-soprano Hermine Finck, who originated the role of the witch in Humperdinck's Hansel and Gretel; actress Ida Fulda; Friederike ("Fritzi") Jauner; and Hilde Fels. His last companion was a mistress, Virginia Zanetti.|$|E
2500|$|She {{resides in}} Ormeley Lodge, a [...] Georgian mansion {{on the edge}} of Richmond Park, with two Grand Basset Griffon Vendéens, Daisy and Lily, and three Norfolk terriers, Barney, Boris and Bindy. In 2003, she remarked on her children's varied marital {{patterns}} by observing, [...] "All my children with James marry young and breed, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>children</b> with Mark do the opposite." [...] Lady Annabel has thirteen grandchildren. She spends part of each year at her [...] organic farm in the hills above Benahavís and has a 1930s holiday home by the seaside in Bognor Regis, West Sussex. Asked about her regrets in life, in 2004, she confessed wishing that she had, instead of marrying twice, been [...] "a one-man woman". [...] "I wouldn't recommend anyone to do what I've done. To marry someone and grow old with them must be much better", she said.|$|E
2500|$|In the book, Social Issues in Television, a senior, nameless {{script editor}} opined that the {{abduction}} storyline sought {{to engage the}} audience {{at the expense of}} any parent's realistic concerns: [...] "We get it wrong when we take the easy route like the kidnap snatch with Vicki. My argument about this was that I am a father but have never had my kids snatched. If I'm just sitting at home <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>children</b> are out late at night and they say they're going to be back at midnight and they don't come back, you immediately think they're dead and you start to worry. If they'd actually been snatched, it would have affected my entire life forever. I would never have recovered from it. I would have been frightened every time one of them left my side. Therefore the consequence of running a storyline like that is immense. If we were being totally responsible about it the fallout on Michelle would have been, well I just don't think she would have been the same person again." ...|$|E

2500|$|David Greenglass, Ethel Rosenberg's {{brother and}} key {{prosecution}} witness, recanted his testimony about his sister having typed the notes. In 2001 he stated, [...] "I frankly think my wife did the typing, but I don't remember." [...] He said he gave false testimony {{to protect himself}} and his wife, Ruth, {{and that he was}} encouraged by the prosecution to do so; [...] "My wife is more important to me than my sister. Or my mother or my father, O.K.? And she was the mother of my children." [...] He refused to express any remorse for his decision to betray his sister, saying only that he did not realize that the death penalty would be invoked. He stated, [...] "I would not sacrifice my wife <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>children</b> for my sister." [...] In September 2008, hundreds of pages of grand jury transcripts were released. With this release, it was revealed that Ruth Greenglass had irreconcilable differences between her grand jury testimony of August 1950 and the testimony she gave at trial. At the grand jury, Ruth Greenglass was asked, [...] "Didn't you write [...] down {{on a piece of paper}}?" [...] She replied, [...] "Yes, I wrote [...] down on a piece of paper and [...] took it with him." [...] But at the trial, she testified that Ethel Rosenberg typed up notes about the atomic bomb.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2004, Moore {{was stopped}} and {{detained}} by Special Branch {{officers at the}} Welsh port of Holyhead, taken into an office and questioned about the lyrics of his songs. The following day, he released a statement saying: [...] "My driver and I were stopped and held for two hours at Holyhead last Monday, under the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2002. My driver and I were held separately in two interrogation rooms. I found the whole experience threatening. I was questioned about the contents of my briefcase." [...] Despite initial reports to the contrary, the singer's van, which was full of musical equipment, was not searched. [...] "I was questioned about lyrics of songs and I was {{asked a lot of}} personal questions about members of my family <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>children</b> and about my home. At no time was I given any explanation as to why I was being held and interrogated in this manner", he added. He said the fact that Irish people are still being treated this way on their way to Britain is very [...] "saddening". [...] "I had hoped to deal with this matter out of the public domain. But seeing as it has become a news item, I feel the need to offer my side of the story. I found the whole affair quite frightening." ...|$|E
