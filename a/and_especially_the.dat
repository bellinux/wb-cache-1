5|$|Adolescence and adulthood: When rats forage {{on their}} own, their food choices are {{influenced}} by social interactions that may take place far away from foraging sites. They smell foods on the fur, whiskers <b>and</b> <b>especially</b> <b>the</b> breath of other rats and strongly prefer the foods those rats had previously eaten. This inclines them not to eat poisons avoided by older rats.|$|E
5|$|Although Sicily was lost, {{the general}} Nikephoros Phokas the Elder succeeded in taking Taranto {{and much of}} Calabria in 880, forming the nucleus for the later Catepanate of Italy. The successes in the Italian Peninsula opened a new period of Byzantine {{domination}} there. Above all, the Byzantines were beginning to establish a strong presence in the Mediterranean Sea, <b>and</b> <b>especially</b> <b>the</b> Adriatic.|$|E
5|$|Although she was {{a pioneer}} in the white-line woodcut {{technique}} and {{played a role in the}} development of abstract art in the United States, Lazzell's work faded into obscurity for a time. With a resurgence of interest in the modern print, <b>and</b> <b>especially</b> <b>the</b> white-line woodcut, Lazzell's popularity has surged lately. On August 3, 2012, Lazzell's print 'Sail Boat' reached a staggering $106,200 at auction.|$|E

5|$|Critics in the United States {{praised the}} film and its British setting, and welcomed it as a return to form for Allen. In contrast, reviewers from the United Kingdom treated Match Point less favourably, finding fault with the {{locations}} <b>and</b> <b>especially</b> <b>the</b> idiom of the dialogue. Allen was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.|$|E

5|$|Henry Walter Bates's 1863 book The Naturalist on the River Amazons {{describes}} his extensive {{studies of the}} insects in the Amazon basin, <b>and</b> <b>especially</b> <b>the</b> butterflies. He discovered that apparently similar butterflies often belonged to different families, with a harmless species mimicking a poisonous or bitter-tasting species to reduce its chance of being attacked by a predator, in the process now called after him, Batesian mimicry.|$|E
5|$|In 1518 Sigismund I married Bona Sforza d'Aragona, a young, strong-minded Italian princess. Bona's {{sway over}} {{the king and}} the magnates, her efforts to {{strengthen}} the monarch's political position, financial situation, <b>and</b> <b>especially</b> <b>the</b> measures she took to advance her personal and dynastic interests, including the forced royal election of the minor Sigismund Augustus in 1529 and his premature coronation in 1530, increased the discontent among szlachta activists.|$|E

5|$|Like {{many other}} German veterans, Göring was {{a proponent of}} the Stab-in-the-back legend, the belief which held that the German Army had not really lost the war, but instead was betrayed by the {{civilian}} leadership: Marxists, Jews, <b>and</b> <b>especially</b> <b>the</b> Republicans, who had overthrown the German monarchy.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Michael II {{tried to}} win {{support among the}} iconophiles by {{appointing}} a relative of his as Archbishop of Ephesus, but his plan failed when the latter refused to be consecrated by the avowedly iconoclast Patriarch Antony I Kassimates. In an effort to consolidate his hold on the provinces, <b>and</b> <b>especially</b> <b>the</b> two Asian themes still loyal to him, Michael proclaimed a 25 percent reduction in taxes for 821–822.|$|E

5|$|Stretford's {{growth was}} fuelled by the {{transport}} revolutions of the 18th <b>and</b> <b>especially</b> <b>the</b> 19th century: the Bridgewater Canal reached Stretford in 1761, and the railway in 1849. The {{completion of the}} Manchester South Junction and Altrincham Railway (MSJAR) in 1849, passing through Stretford, led to {{the population of the}} town nearly doubling in a decade, increasing from 4,998 in 1851 to 8,757 by 1861.|$|E

5|$|A major {{driver of}} human impact on Earth systems is the {{destruction}} of biophysical resources, <b>and</b> <b>especially,</b> <b>the</b> Earth's ecosystems. The environmental impact of a community or of humankind as a whole depends both on population and impact per person, which in turn depends in complex ways on what resources are being used, whether or not those resources are renewable, and {{the scale of the}} human activity relative to the carrying capacity of the ecosystems involved. Careful resource management can be applied at many scales, from economic sectors like agriculture, manufacturing and industry, to work organizations, the consumption patterns of households and individuals and to the resource demands of individual goods and services.|$|E
