5|$|A small {{contingent}} of Hawker Hunters deployed to Sweden in 1965 for training in air-to-ground delivery of ordnance, and intermittently thereafter, but annual training abroad for the Swiss Air Force {{did not begin}} until 1985. The use of Swiss <b>air</b> <b>space</b> for combat training became increasingly impractical as the performance of supersonic jets increased and created environmental restrictions. The Swiss modified their traditional stance of neutrality to seek other facilities, particularly among NATO European members, to meet their training needs.|$|E
5|$|A wet bell, or open bell, {{is similar}} to a diving stage in concept, but has an <b>air</b> <b>space,</b> open to the water at the bottom in which the divers, or at least their heads, can shelter during ascent and descent. A wet bell {{provides}} more comfort and control than a stage and allows for longer time in the water. Wet bells are used for air and mixed gas, and divers can decompress using oxygen from a mask at 12m.|$|E

The committee also said that eventually a single civil agency should be given the power to regulate all <b>air</b> <b>space</b> for all types of aircraft. Furthermore, the committee stated that military flying should be controlled in the vicinity of airways not only in instrument weather, but also in visual conditions.|$|E
5|$|On September 12, 1995, three gas {{balloons}} {{participating in}} the race entered Belarusian <b>air</b> <b>space.</b> Despite the fact that competition organizers had informed the Belarusian Government about the race in May and that flight plans had been filed, a Mil Mi-24B attack helicopter of the Belarusian Air Force shot down one balloon, killing two American citizens, Alan Fraenckel and John Stuart-Jervis. Another of the balloons was forced to land while the third landed safely over two hours after the initial downing. The crews of the two balloons were fined for entering Belarus without a visa and released. Belarus has neither apologized nor offered compensation for the deaths.|$|E

5|$|The {{air traffic}} control at Værnes was {{established}} in 1946, after the air force had sent personnel to the United Kingdom for training. The Telecommunications Administration took over {{the responsibility for the}} radio installations, and the responsibility for the meteorological services became the responsibility of the Norwegian Meteorological Institute. Trondheim Air Traffic Control Center was also established to monitor all <b>air</b> <b>space</b> over Central Norway. In 1955, a glass dome was built on top of the control tower, giving a much better view of the air field.|$|E
5|$|The anti-torpedo bulges of the Admiral-class battlecruisers {{were the}} first fitted on a British capital ship to fully {{incorporate}} the lessons learned {{from a series of}} experiments begun before World War I. They consisted of an outer <b>air</b> <b>space,</b> an inner buoyancy space and the 1.5-inch protective bulkhead. The buoyancy space was filled with sealed steel crushing tubes intended to distribute the force of an explosion over as wide an area as possible as well as absorb as much of its force as possible. However, tests conducted after Hood was completed showed that filling the buoyancy space with water was equally as effective and considerably cheaper.|$|E
5|$|The {{essential}} {{target was}} RAF Fighter Command. The service's destruction would deny the British their air superiority asset. Throughout July and early August, the Germans made preparations for Adlertag. The {{date of the}} assault was postponed several times because of bad weather. Eventually, it was carried out on 13 August 1940. The German attacks on 13 August inflicted significant damage and casualties on the ground, but, marred by poor intelligence and communication, they {{did not make a}} significant impression on Fighter Command's ability to defend British <b>air</b> <b>space.</b>|$|E

30|$|In HC {{the changes}} of {{shape and size}} of <b>air</b> <b>spaces</b> seemed to provide a greater {{contribution}} to the increase of lung volume than recruitment mechanisms. NA tendency to decrease after a peak was interpreted {{as a consequence of}} progressive stretching of interstitial septa with creation of false connections between adjacent <b>air</b> <b>spaces</b> (false derecruitment). In VILI, alveolar recruitment during lung inflation was a continuous pattern throughout the range of PEEP levels that were studied.|$|R
5|$|The initial {{air strikes}} over Belgian <b>air</b> <b>space</b> {{were to be}} {{conducted}} by IV. Fliegerkorps under General der Flieger Generaloberst Alfred Keller. Keller's force consisted of Lehrgeschwader 1 (Stab. I., II., III., IV.), Kampfgeschwader 30 (Stab. I., II., III.) and Kampfgeschwader 27 (III.). On 10 May Keller had 363 aircraft (224 serviceable) augmented by Generalmajor Wolfram von Richthofen's VIII. Fliegerkorps with 550 (420 serviceable) aircraft. They in turn were supported by Oberst Kurt-Bertram von Döring's Jagdfliegerführer 2, with 462 fighters (313 serviceable).|$|E
5|$|By August 1940 the Battle of Britain was intensifying. Most of {{the battles}} thus far were in daylight, leaving night-fighter crews frustrated. Now based at RAF Digby in Lincolnshire and {{operating}} from the satellite airfield at Wellingore the unit formed part of No. 12 Group RAF defending British <b>air</b> <b>space</b> north of London. On {{the night of}} 24 August 1940 Braham took off and patrolled the Humberside area. The Blenheim was piloted by Braham, and contained air gunner Sergeant Wilsdon and aircraftman and trained radar operator N. Jacobson. Braham was directed to an aircraft held in searchlights but he closed too fast and overshot. His gunner succeeded in damaging the aircraft sufficiently and a searchlight crew saw it crash into the sea. It {{was identified as a}} Heinkel He 111. Braham's only other interaction with the enemy occurred at Ternhill, when a Junkers Ju 88 dropped bombs on the airfield destroying 13 Avro Ansons and damaged 20 more. Braham survived the attack uninjured.|$|E
5|$|During the Syrian Civil War, Turkish F-16s were {{tasked with}} {{airspace}} protection on the Syrian border. After the RF-4 downing in June 2012 Turkey changed its rules of engagements against Syrian aircraft, resulting in scrambles and downings of Syrian combat aircraft. On 16 September 2013, a Turkish Air Force F-16 shot down a Syrian Arab Air Force Mil Mi-17 helicopter in Latakia province near Turkish boder. On 23 March 2014, a Turkish Air Force F-16 shot down a Syrian Arab Air Force Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23 when it allegedly entered Turkish <b>air</b> <b>space</b> during a ground attack mission against Al Qaeda-linked insurgents.

5|$|In June 2004, Fletcher's {{aircraft}} {{caused a}} security scare that triggered a brief evacuation of the U.S. Capitol and Supreme Court building. Shortly after takeoff {{en route to}} memorial services for former president Ronald Reagan, the transponder on Fletcher's plane malfunctioned, leading officials at Reagan National Airport to report an unauthorized aircraft entering restricted airspace. Two F-15 fighters were dispatched to investigate, and Fletcher's plane was escorted to its destination by two Blackhawk helicopters. The plane, a 33-year-old Beechcraft King Air, was the oldest of its model still in operation. An investigation by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) found that the crew of Fletcher's plane maintained radio contact with air traffic officials and received clearance to enter the restricted <b>air</b> <b>space.</b> The investigation determined that miscommunication by air traffic controllers sparked the panic, and {{in the aftermath of}} the incident, the FAA adopted policies to prevent future errors of a similar nature.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to slow the Chinese advance, MacArthur ordered the bridges across the Yalu to be bombed. After due {{consultation}} with his advisers, Truman declared {{that he would not}} approve of such an action, and the Joint Chiefs cancelled the order. When MacArthur protested, the President and the Joint Chiefs authorized the bombings, subject to the caveat that Chinese <b>air</b> <b>space</b> not be violated. Major General Emmett O'Donnell would later cite this to the Congressional inquiry into MacArthur's relief as an example of undue political interference in military operations. The Yalu River had many bends, and in some cases there were very restricted lines of approach without overflying the Yalu. This made life easier for the Communist antiaircraft gunners, but correspondingly less so for the aircrew. Within weeks, MacArthur was forced to retreat, and both Truman and MacArthur were forced to contemplate the prospect of abandoning Korea entirely.|$|E
5|$|Interest from {{military}} leaders for an airport at Banak returned in 1955. For {{the air force}} the main concern was {{that they could not}} reach the eastern-most parts of Norway from Bodø Main Air Station. This resulted in several Soviet infringements of Norwegian <b>air</b> <b>space.</b> Alternative locations were considered, such as Kautokeino, were there had been built a radar. NATO supported a reconstruction of Banak, partially raised by increased focus on flanking maneuver strategies, and also to serve {{as a part of the}} nuclear program. NATO was ready to provide funding in 1957, but by the Norwegian authorities wanted to delay its construction, citing lack of personnel to man the station and that it would not be usable in times of war. The government decided in 1957 to not allow nuclear warheads to be stored in Norway during peacetime, thus eliminating NATO's strategic need for Banak. The airport was therefore removed from the investment program.|$|E
