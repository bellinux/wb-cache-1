60|$|There {{was a short}} laugh from Chatellerault, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> the {{deliberate}} fall of his feet as he paced the chamber.|$|E
60|$|The {{fresh breeze}} was blowing right down upon us, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> the whistle plainly, {{off to one}} side and a little ahead.|$|E
6000|$|Dr. Livesey was by {{this time}} across the stockade and pretty near the cook; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> the {{alteration}} in his voice as he said-- ...|$|E
60|$|A gap {{appeared}} in the roof <b>and</b> widened. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> the heavy breathing of the man as he wrenched at the tiles.|$|R
60|$|The rain {{seemed to}} be pouring on its roof and {{northern}} side {{as if there were}} a waterfall above us, and every now <b>and</b> then <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> a shower of hailstones rattling against the shutters. My bedroom was one of the rooms on the lower floor, <b>and</b> even there <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> the pounding of the deluge and the hailstones upon the roof.|$|R
60|$|As I {{passed out}} {{she leaned over}} towards me. She had already rung a bell, <b>and</b> outside <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> the {{shuffling}} footsteps of the old servant who had admitted me.|$|R
60|$|At {{this moment}} {{there was a}} loud ring at the bell, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> Mrs. Hudson, our landlady, raising her voice in a wail of expostulation and dismay.|$|E
6000|$|... "Stop that!" [...] said Billy and {{the troop}} horse together, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> them stamp and shiver. An elephant's trumpeting is always nasty, {{especially}} on a dark night.|$|E
60|$|Fred's {{door was}} shut, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> him snoring. I {{scratched}} gently, and then harder, till I heard the snores stop. He {{got out of}} bed and opened the door.|$|E
60|$|Then, dim <b>and</b> far, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> Morrell's taps enunciating {{that they}} had {{put me in the}} jacket an hour before, and that, as usual, I was already deaf to all knuckle talk.|$|R
60|$|I slipped {{behind a}} large boulder {{near the mouth}} of the ravine <b>and</b> waited. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> the {{crashing}} of underbrush in the forest, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> guessed that whoever came came quickly--pursued and pursuers, doubtless.|$|R
60|$|Instead {{of being}} in the heart of a city, however, I soon {{discovered}} we were in a belt of timber land. Huge trees lined the road on both sides, <b>and</b> ahead <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> the flowing of a mountain stream.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, good, excellent--for the interior." [...] The little Mexican {{retreated into}} his shack <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> him murmuring, [...] "For the interior, excellent," [...] {{as he moved}} to and fro.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, 'm; {{it was so}} lonesome in the rain, {{and this}} place seemed kinder like home, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> 'em talkin' outside, and Sanch he found vittles, and I was pretty comfortable." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come {{alongside}} {{and show}} your pass," [...] the voice demanded, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> the foot-falls of the sentry {{as he came}} from amidships aft and leaned over the rail that he might see us more clearly.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, missie, no. Baas Frank has but {{now gone}} to his tent. He has {{been talking to the}} clergyman, {{something}} about Missie Bessie, I don't know what. I was near, but he talked low, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> only <b>hear</b> the name." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{seemed to}} be getting darker <b>and</b> darker. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> the sound of Peter's footsteps, and they seemed to drag as he forced his way through the bushes. And then, quite suddenly, he sat down without any warning, <b>and</b> when <b>I</b> ran up I heard him crying.|$|R
60|$|Before {{the third}} stroke the wicks of the lamps had caught, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{had turned out}} the {{electric}} light. In the dimness of the struggling lamps, and after the bright glow of the electric light, the room and all within it took weird shapes, and all seemed in an instant to change. We waited with our hearts beating. I know mine did, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> fancied <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> the pulsation of the others.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{heard it}} distinctly," [...] she declared; [...] "in fact it woke me up. I hung {{out of the}} window, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> the engine just as plainly {{as though it were}} over the golf links." ...|$|E
60|$|We {{were riding}} {{in the shadow of}} the trees at the time, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> him {{slapping}} his riding-whip against his boot, and taking pinch after pinch of snuff, as was his way when he was excited.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nearer {{he came to}} {{the line}} of my property, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> him making little moaning, whimpering noises as he licked the damp wood. It was like {{listening}} to an animal grazing pasture-grass at night and ever grazing nearer.|$|E
6000|$|... "'No. Not {{that day}} or the next, but {{on the third day}} Mary <b>and</b> <b>I</b> both thought we heard a funny sound. I said that Mr. Skinner had left his window open, and it was the blind {{flapping}} against the window-pane; but when we heard that funny noise again I put my ear to the keyhole <b>and</b> <b>I</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> a groan. <b>I</b> was very frightened, and sent Mary for the police.' ...|$|R
6000|$|I pass'd {{through the}} lonely street, [...] The wind did sing <b>and</b> blow; [...] <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> the policeman's feet [...] Clapping to and fro.|$|R
60|$|Oh, {{you don't}} know. Last Tuesday he was dining there, {{and you should}} have seen the state he was in. He was so restless he couldn't sit still. He looked at his watch every minute. His eyes simply glittered with excitement, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> almost <b>hear</b> his heart beating.|$|R
60|$|Tommy the Song. I {{heard one}} coming after me one night; very big and shadowy it was, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> it breathing. But {{when it came}} up with me I lifted a hazel rod was in my hand, and it was gone on the moment.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, sma'am," [...] said Pomona; {{and she got}} up and flew--not very fast, I imagine. Where {{she flew}} to I don't know, but she took the lamp with her, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> distant syllables of agony and blood, until the boarder came home and Pomona went to bed.|$|E
6000|$|I {{felt the}} {{straining}} hemp contract within my grasp. Trampling feet clawed for a firmer {{hold on the}} frozen sod, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> the men behind me panting heavily. The door remained fast, however, and again a breathless voice encouraged us: [...] "This time does it! Out she comes!" ...|$|E
60|$|Pyr. Some {{business}} of import, that triumph wears, You {{seem to go}} with; nor {{is it hard to}} guess When you are pleased, by a malicious joy, Whose red and fiery beams cast through your visage A glowing pleasure. Sure you smile revenge, <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> gladly <b>hear.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Ormond {{raised his}} hand for silence, <b>and</b> again <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> the shrilling of the bitter wind that was never still. Then he said softly: [...] "You are only {{exciting}} him, and had better go," [...] and with a last glance at Grace's slender figure stooping beside the bed I went out softly.|$|R
60|$|I sat on that porch a good while, {{but she did}} {{not come}} out again. Why should she? Nobody came out, <b>and</b> within <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> no sound of voices. I might {{certainly}} recommend this inn as a quiet place. The Italian and the crickets continued singing and chirping, but they only seemed to make the scene more lonely.|$|R
60|$|His voice died away, and the {{arm that}} was round my neck went limp, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> by his {{breathing}} {{that he was}} asleep. His head was resting on my back, but I didn't move. I wriggled {{a little closer to}} make him as comfortable as I could, and then I went to sleep myself.|$|E
6000|$|... “I {{went with}} him to the rebel headquarters, and then very nearly tried to run away again, because it was like walking into the lion’s den. The patio was {{littered}} with the furniture they had thrown out of the windows, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> the men roystering over their wine. Still, when I looked at the man with me, I went in.” ...|$|E
60|$|Some of {{the women}} began to cry. My father came out into the hall, closing the room door behind him, and ordered them to be quiet, so sternly that they were stunned into silence. The furious ringing was repeated; and, this time, threats mingled among the hoarse shouts. My mother's arm {{tightened}} around me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> the beating of her heart.|$|E
60|$|A {{murmur of}} applause {{followed}} this notable proposal, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> fancied <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> a snigger {{from the young}} man, as if he found the project to his mind, and {{thought it might be}} feasible.|$|R
60|$|While I waited, I heard, upstairs, that unmistakable sound {{instantly}} {{recognized the}} world over--a bickering woman's voice, rising as her anger <b>and</b> fury grew. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear,</b> between the gusts, the temperate rumble of Bell's tones, striving to oil the troubled waters.|$|R
6000|$|... "I succeeded--I {{generally}} do--in securing one of {{the front}} seats among the audience, and was already comfortably installed in my place in court when through the trap door I saw {{the head of the}} prisoner emerge. She was very becomingly dressed in deep black, and, led by two policemen, she took her place in the dock. Sir James Fenwick shook hands with her very warmly, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> almost <b>hear</b> him instilling words of comfort into her.|$|R
