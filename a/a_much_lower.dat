Three of these productions starred Roekiah and Djoemala in the leading roles, and featured Kartolo.

40|$|In this paper, a {{heuristic}} dynamic-programming recursion {{is proposed}} for solving unconstrained 2 D knapsack problem efficiently. The algorithm we propose is an incompletely enumerative method, {{in which some}} intricate cutting patterns may not be enumerated. Compared with the traditional dynamic-programming, the algorithm gives {{a high percentage of}} optimal solutions (93 %) with <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>lowered</b> computational complexity. Some theoretical analyses for the algorithm are performed. Computational results are given for small and medium-sized problems...|$|R
5|$|Although by tradition, Hastert was {{the leader}} of the House Republicans, he adopted <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>lower</b> profile in the media than {{conventional}} wisdom would suggest for a Speaker. This led to accusations that he was only a figurehead for DeLay. In 2005, DeLay was indicted by a Texas grand jury on charges of campaign-finance violations. DeLay stepped down as majority leader and was replaced in that post by Roy Blunt; DeLay resigned from Congress the following year.|$|E
5|$|Because {{they have}} to carry the large water tank and fuel for the burner, snow melting {{machines}} tend to be much larger and heavier than most winter service vehicles, at around , with the largest being hauled by semi-trailer tractor units. In addition, the complicated melting process means that snow melting vehicles have <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>lower</b> capacity than the equivalent plow or blower vehicle; the largest snow melter can remove 500 metric tons of snow per hour, compared to the 5,000 metric tons per hour capacity of any large snow blower.|$|E

5|$|In January 1960, a {{group of}} local {{businessmen}} approached Carroll about leading a campaign to allow the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) to provide electricity to McCracken County. TVA could provide electricity at <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>lower</b> cost, but voters would first have to hold a public referendum on buying out Kentucky Utilities, the private power provider in the area. Carroll agreed to lead the campaign, and nine months later, voters approved the buyout by a three-to-one margin.|$|E
5|$|On Earth, the {{northern}} polar jet stream {{is the most}} important one for aviation and weather forecasting, as it is much stronger and at <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>lower</b> altitude than the subtropical jet streams and also covers many countries in the Northern Hemisphere, while the southern polar jet stream mostly circles Antarctica and sometimes the southern tip of South America. The term jet stream in these contexts thus usually implies {{the northern}} polar jet stream.|$|E
5|$|The N-Gage {{version of}} X-Men Legends {{contains}} {{most of the}} features found on the console versions. However, {{the game is played}} from an isometric point of view. Characters are two-dimensional sprites based on their three-dimensional console counterparts, and levels are redesigned to meet the limitations of the isometric point of view.

5|$|The {{combination}} of the radius and the mass of a star determines its surface gravity. Giant stars have <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>lower</b> surface gravity than do main sequence stars, while the opposite {{is the case for}} degenerate, compact stars such as white dwarfs. The surface gravity can influence the appearance of a star's spectrum, with higher gravity causing a broadening of the absorption lines.|$|E
5|$|The main predators of {{the garden}} warbler are Eurasian sparrowhawks and {{domestic}} cats. Some falcons will also take adults, and the Eleonora's falcon hunts the garden warbler and many other small passerines as they migrate across the Mediterranean. Eurasian jays and Eurasian magpies take the eggs and young of warblers, as do mammals such as stoats, weasels and squirrels. The garden warbler is a host of the common cuckoo, a brood parasite. The blackcap has <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>lower</b> level of parasitism than its relative because the cuckoo's eggs are often rejected.|$|E
5|$|Trapping resumed in the U.S. after 1962 once numbers had {{recovered}} sufficiently. During the early 1970s, {{the value of}} fisher pelts soared, leading to another population crash in 1976. After {{a couple of years}} of closed seasons, fisher trapping re-opened in 1979 with a shortened season and restricted bag limits. The population has steadily increased since then, with steadily increasing numbers of trapped animals, despite <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>lower</b> pelt value.|$|E

5|$|After Biman {{became a}} public limited company, renewed {{attempts}} were made to procure new-generation aircraft to replace its ageing fleet. In November 2007, Boeing made an offer to supply Biman with four Boeing 777-200s (with options for two more) to be delivered by 2013 and four Boeing 787-8 Dreamliners (with options for two more) to be delivered by 2017 and provide similar aircraft on lease for the interim period beginning in 2009. The average price of these aircraft was quoted as million. Airbus also made an offer to supply four Airbus A320 or Airbus A330 series aircraft at <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>lower</b> price than that of Boeing. To manage the fleet in the short run, Biman again floated a tender in January 2008 to purchase/dry lease with options to purchase two used Airbus A310-300 aircraft.|$|E
5|$|An {{adaptation}} of the comics was originally envisioned by producer Tonino Cervi. Cervi hired director Seth Holt and began producing the film as an international co-production, with a cast that included Jean Sorel, Elsa Martinelli and Gilbert Roland. After producer Dino De Laurentiis saw the footage that had been shot, he halted production on the film, had a new screenplay developed, and hired a new director and cast. This resulted in Bava directing the film on <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>lower</b> budget, with more well-known actors taking smaller roles. Many of {{the cast and crew}} members were brought in from Barbarella, De Laurentiis' other comic book {{adaptation of}} that year.|$|E

In 1870, its directors were found guilty of a breach of trust and ordered to compensate the company. Although they all appealed and were allowed in 1874 to settle for <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>lower</b> amount, to restore shareholders' confidence the directors had all been replaced by October 1872 and Edward Watkin appointed chairman.

Later in 1976 due to the album's strong sales, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified Lazy Afternoon Gold on April 14, 1976 for shipments of 500,000 copies.

5|$|Pallas is {{farther from}} Earth and has <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>lower</b> albedo than Vesta, and hence is dimmer {{as seen from}} Earth.
