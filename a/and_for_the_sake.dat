There are archaeological sites and evidence from across the continent, <b>and,</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sake</b> of ease, {{it has often been}} divided into five regions: northern Africa, which is often, though not without controversy, taken into consideration more so with Southwest Asia and Europe than with the rest of Africa; eastern Africa, stretching roughly from the highlands of Ethiopia to the southern part of Kenya; central Africa, which is arguably the least explored region, stretching from the borders of Tanzania and Kenya to include Angola; southern Africa, which includes the numerous cave sites of South Africa; and western Africa.|$|E
5|$|Several {{critics have}} made exactly the {{opposite}} interpretation, reading the poem as a comic critique of the Christianity of the time, particularly as embodied in the Christian chivalry of Arthur's court. In its zeal to extirpate all traces of paganism, Christianity had cut itself off from the sources of life in nature and the female. The green girdle represents all the pentangle lacks. The Arthurian enterprise is doomed unless it can acknowledge the unattainability of {{the ideals of the}} Round Table, <b>and,</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sake</b> of realism and wholeness, recognize and incorporate the pagan values represented by the Green Knight.|$|E

25|$|In early October 1918, the Ottomans {{pulled back}} from {{southern}} Lori, which eliminated the territorial buffer between Armenia and Georgia. The Armenian military quickly filled the void by taking control of much of southern Lori on 18 October {{and in the absence}} of any resistance probed further north. The first incident between Armenia and Georgia occurred the same day when an Armenian army detachment seized the railway station in the village of Kober near Tumanyan, refusing a subsequent demand from the Germans that they withdraw. The local border guards called for help, and the Georgian government responded by sending two armored trains and a detachment of 250 soldiers, which forced the Armenians to leave Kober. Five days later, three Armenian companies attacked and overwhelmed a German garrison near the village of Karinj. Earlier, the Georgian government in Tbilisi had received a letter from Armenian Prime Minister Hovhannes Kajaznuni insisting that Georgia had no claims on the Lori district, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sake</b> of avoiding a catastrophic crisis for both countries, Georgian troops should leave the region. Clashes intensified from 25–27 October, with neither side gaining the advantage, until the Georgians sent a company-sized force with an armored train to support their German allies. Just a day later, the Georgian government received a telegram from Armenia explaining that the attacks were the result of a misunderstanding and proposed that a conference be convened to resolve the border issue. On 27 October, Armenian troops left the two villages, they had occupied, and retreated south.|$|E

25|$|On November 15, 1960, {{with the}} arrival of the R27s, service on the Brighton Line was as follows: Express was {{designated}} as Q, local via tunnel as QT, and local via bridge as QB. Single letters were used to refer to express lines and double letters for local lines, a practice that began thirty years earlier with the Independent Subway System (IND). However, these designations were not as yet in common usage, and the R27 signs continued to display the old route names. For the above reasons <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sake</b> of continuity and consistency, these services were referred to by the old route names until the time of the opening of the Chrystie Street Connection. Moreover, it was deemed more important and informative to indicate how the trains actually operated rather than how the letters were manipulated. Starting January 1, 1961, weekday Brighton Express service terminated at 57th Street–Seventh Avenue all day. On Saturdays, these trains provided local service between Franklin Avenue and Brighton Beach. This service was merged into the Franklin Avenue Shuttle service on October 14, 1961, and was discontinued altogether in February 1963. (The Sunday service to Brighton Beach had been discontinued on January 1, 1961.) Brighton Local service ran to Astoria – Ditmars Boulevard at all times. On Saturdays, they provided express service on the Brighton Line, and ran local all other times. This service change was essentially a swap between the north terminals of the Brighton Local and Fourth Avenue Local, and between the Brighton Express and West End Express. Prior to this time, both Brighton services operated via the 60th Street Tunnel to Queens. This change served to keep one Brighton service available in the event of a massive delay in the 60th Street Tunnel.|$|E

The producers were also denied a request to film at a Berlin police station by the department, citing adverse impact to the facility. The German government eventually {{had a change of heart}} concerning the Bendlerblock site and gave permission for filmmakers to film there. A United Artists spokesman said that they were [...] "very grateful" [...] for the decision, saying that the site [...] " [...] always been important to us symbolically, creatively <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sake</b> of historical authenticity" [...] and that the company had been in continuous talks with the German government in order to clear up any misconceptions about the nature of the film.

Leopold apparently saw this effort to support charitable works as [...] "a way to earn the love of this very special nation".

Peter and Homer stop fighting and admit their respect and admiration for each other while agreeing to stay away in the future.
