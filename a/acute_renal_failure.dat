5|$|Risk factors {{indicating}} {{an increased}} risk of death include older age, female gender, a history of liver cirrhosis, biliary narrowing due to cancer, <b>acute</b> <b>renal</b> <b>failure</b> and the presence of liver abscesses. Complications following severe cholangitis include renal failure, respiratory failure (inability of the respiratory system to oxygenate blood and/or eliminate carbon dioxide), cardiac arrhythmia, wound infection, pneumonia, gastrointestinal bleeding and myocardial ischemia (lack of blood flow to the heart, leading to heart attacks).|$|E
5|$|Poisoning {{symptoms}} are rapid in onset, consisting initially of vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and associated decreased blood volume. Shortly after these initial symptoms appear, hemolysis develops, resulting in reduced urine output, hemoglobin {{in the urine}} or outright absence of urine formation, and anemia. Medical laboratory tests consist of testing {{for the presence of}} increasing bilirubin and free hemoglobin, and falling haptoglobins. Hemolysis may lead to numerous complications including <b>acute</b> <b>renal</b> <b>failure,</b> shock, acute respiratory failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. These complications can cause significant morbidity with fatalities having been reported.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{food items}} {{commonly}} consumed by humans are toxic to hamsters {{and should be}} avoided completely in captivity. After they are completely weaned at around 21 days of age, Campbell's dwarf hamsters are lactose intolerant and cannot digest milk. Onions and garlic are very dangerous and can cause severe haemolytic anemia. Leafy green vegetables such as cabbage and celery contain {{a large amount of}} water, so can have severe laxative effects on small animals. Grapes and raisins may contribute to <b>acute</b> <b>renal</b> <b>failure,</b> due to their high level of acidity. Chocolate and other sticky foods such peanut butter may solidify in a hamster's cheek pouches and lead to infections, which can lead to death.|$|E
40|$|Dextran 40 is used {{to improve}} the microcirculation after certain {{surgical}} procedures. We report a rare case of <b>acute</b> anuric <b>renal</b> <b>failure</b> in a healthy young adult after administration of dextran 40 to improve the microcirculation following ear-reattachment surgery. The <b>renal</b> <b>failure</b> was subsequently reversed by plasmapheresis and intensive care support.

40|$|Intravenous {{administration}} of an ionic radiographic contrast medium {{was believed to}} have caused <b>acute</b> oliguric <b>renal</b> <b>failure</b> in a young dog. Intravenous pyelography was done on a healthy 14 -month-old female Lhasa Apso prior to reconstructive surgery for pseudohermaphroditism. Within 24 hours of the radiographic procedure, <b>acute</b> oliguric <b>renal</b> <b>failure</b> developed. Cause for the <b>renal</b> <b>failure</b> was not found other than the recent IV {{administration of}} radiographic contrast medium. Treatment with fluids, furosemide, and dopamine was successful in returning renal function to normal. Various adverse reactions to IV administration of contrast media in human beings and animals have been reported; however, to our knowledge, <b>acute</b> <b>renal</b> dysfunction induced by IV administration of contrast material has not been reported in dogs...|$|R

5|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} of poisoning by A. ocreata are initially gastrointestinal in nature and include colicky abdominal pain, with watery diarrhea and vomiting which may lead to dehydration and, in severe cases, hypotension, tachycardia, hypoglycemia, and acid-base disturbances. The initial symptoms resolve {{two to three days}} after ingestion of the fungus. A more serious deterioration signifying liver involvement may then occurâ€”jaundice, diarrhea, delirium, seizures, and coma due to fulminant liver failure and attendant hepatic encephalopathy caused by the accumulation of normally liver-removed substances in the blood. Renal failure (either secondary to severe hepatitis or caused by direct toxic renal damage) and coagulopathy may appear during this stage. Life-threatening complications include increased intracranial pressure, intracranial hemorrhage, sepsis, pancreatitis, <b>acute</b> <b>renal</b> <b>failure,</b> and cardiac arrest. Death generally occurs six to sixteen days after the poisoning.|$|E

40|$|Critically ill {{patients}} often cannot tolerate conventional hemodialysis because of hemodynamic instability. Continuous arteriovenous hemofiltration provides control of fluid and electrolyte balance but is inefficient {{in the management}} of azotemia. Continuous arteriovenous hemodialysis (CAVHD) combines dialysis with hemofiltration. We performed 15 CAVHD treatments of 2 or more days' duration in 12 critically {{ill patients}} aged 23 to 85 (mean 64. 4) years who had <b>acute</b> oliguric <b>renal</b> <b>failure</b> as a component of multiple organ system failure and who were unsuitable for conventional hemodialysis. The total treatment time was 106 days. The serum creatinine and urea levels were controlled in all the patients during CAVHD. The ultrafiltrate losses were sufficient to allow appropriate nutrition and fluid administration and still maintain a negative fluid balance. Renal function returned in five patients (42 %), of whom four survived to be discharged home. CAVHD is an effective means of managing <b>acute</b> oliguric <b>renal</b> <b>failure</b> in critically ill patients...|$|R
