5|$|<b>Ambient</b> <b>pressure</b> is {{deducted from}} {{cylinder}} pressure, as {{the quantity of}} air represented by PA can in practice {{not be used for}} breathing by the diver as it required to balance the <b>ambient</b> <b>pressure</b> of the water.|$|E
5|$|Immersion {{in water}} and {{exposure}} to cold water and high pressure have physiological effects on the diver which limit the depths and duration possible in <b>ambient</b> <b>pressure</b> diving. Breath-hold endurance is a severe limitation, and breathing at high <b>ambient</b> <b>pressure</b> adds further complications, both directly and indirectly. Technological solutions have been developed which can greatly extend depth and duration of human <b>ambient</b> <b>pressure</b> dives, and allow useful {{work to be done}} underwater.|$|E
5|$|In <b>ambient</b> <b>pressure</b> diving, the diver is {{directly}} {{exposed to the}} pressure of the surrounding water. The <b>ambient</b> <b>pressure</b> diver may dive on breath-hold, or use breathing apparatus for scuba diving or surface-supplied diving, and the saturation diving technique reduces the risk of decompression sickness (DCS) after long-duration deep dives. Atmospheric diving suits (ADS) may be used to isolate the diver from high <b>ambient</b> <b>pressure.</b> Crewed submersibles can extend depth range, and remotely controlled or robotic machines can reduce risk to humans.|$|E
40|$|The direct {{simulation}} Monte-Carlo (DSMC) {{method was}} applied to the analysis of low-density nitrogen plumes exhausting from a small converging-diverging nozzle into finite <b>ambient</b> <b>pressures.</b> Two cases were considered that simulated actual test conditions in a vacuum facility. The numerical simulations readily captured the complicated flow structure of the overexpanded plumes adjusting to the finite <b>ambient</b> <b>pressures,</b> including Mach disks and barrel shaped shocks. The numerical simulations compared well to experimental data of Rothe...|$|R

50|$|Procedural adaptations {{for deep}} diving can be {{classified}} as those procedures for operating specialized equipment, and those that apply directly to the problems caused by exposure to high <b>ambient</b> <b>pressures.</b>|$|R
5|$|Immersion {{in water}} and {{exposure}} to high <b>ambient</b> <b>pressure</b> have physiological effects that limit the depths and duration possible in <b>ambient</b> <b>pressure</b> diving. Humans are not physiologically and anatomically well adapted to the environmental conditions of diving, and various equipment has been developed to extend the depth and duration of human dives, and allow different types {{of work to be}} done.|$|E
5|$|Supersaturation ratios {{decrease}} linearly {{with increased}} <b>ambient</b> <b>pressure,</b> (M-values) and are different for each compartment.|$|E
5|$|Where Ptissue {{represents}} the dissolved gas tension, Pambient, the <b>ambient</b> <b>pressure</b> and a and b two coefficients. This linear relationship between dissolved gas and <b>ambient</b> <b>pressure</b> {{has the same}} mathematical form as an M value, which suggests that all the Haldanean models using M-values (including the US Navy tables previous to those based on the E-L model, the Bühlmann tables and all the French Navy tables), may be considered expressions of the critical volume criterion, though their authors may have argued for other interpretations.|$|E
50|$|One {{possible}} {{solution would be}} to use an aerospike engine, which can be effective {{in a wide range}} of <b>ambient</b> <b>pressures.</b> In fact, a linear aerospike engine was used in the X-33 design.|$|R
25|$|At {{increased}} <b>ambient</b> <b>pressures</b> due to depth or habitat pressurisation, a diver's lungs {{are filled}} with breathing gas at the increased pressure, and the partial pressures of the constituent gases will be increased proportionately.|$|R
40|$|The {{requirements}} for {{bearings and seals}} {{to operate in the}} environment of space dictate a new area for lubrication research. The low <b>ambient</b> <b>pressures</b> encountered in space can be expected to influence the behavior of oil, grease, and solid-film lubricants. The property of these materials most significantly affected by low <b>ambient</b> <b>pressures</b> is the evaporation rate. Various investigators have therefore measured the evaporation rates of oils and greases in vacuum as one method of establishing their relative merit for space applications (1 - 3). The results of this work have given some indication as to the oils and greases with the greatest stability at reduced <b>ambient</b> <b>pressures.</b> Only limited experimental work, however, has been reported in the literature for inorganic solids and soft metals which have potential use as solid lubricant films or coatings for hard alloy substrates [e. g. Reference (4) ]. In general, the evaporation rates of these materials would be lower than those of oils and greases. These films might therefore be very attractive as lubricants for high vacuum service...|$|R
5|$|Albert A. Bühlmann {{published}} Decompression–Decompression sickness in 1984. Bühlmann {{recognized the}} problems associated with altitude diving, and proposed a method that calculated maximum nitrogen loading in the tissues at a particular <b>ambient</b> <b>pressure</b> by modifying Haldane's allowable supersaturation ratios to increase linearly with depth.|$|E
5|$|Any {{inert gas}} that is breathed under {{pressure}} can form bubbles when the <b>ambient</b> <b>pressure</b> decreases. Very deep dives {{have been made}} using hydrogen-oxygen mixtures (hydrox), but controlled decompression is still required to avoid DCS.|$|E
5|$|Ascent-induced hypoxia {{is caused}} by a drop in oxygen partial {{pressure}} as <b>ambient</b> <b>pressure</b> is reduced. The partial pressure of oxygen at depth may be sufficient to maintain consciousness but only at that depth and not at the reduced pressures nearer the surface.|$|E
40|$|A {{combined}} simplex/air-assist atomizer with swirl {{is characterized}} in an isothermal high pressure spray characterization chamber, with optical access, under various <b>ambient</b> <b>pressures.</b> A single-component, phase Doppler laser interferometer {{is used to}} obtain spatially resolved droplet size and velocity information. Data are obtained at atmospheric pressure as well as 3 and 6 atmospheres for conditions of constant fuel and atomizing air flow rates. Two different nozzle air flow rates and, hence, two different air-to-liquid ratios are considered. The appropriate scaling parameters for the extrapolation of atmospheric testing data to high <b>ambient</b> <b>pressures</b> are likely geometry specific, and will require data of the type reported here...|$|R
30|$|An {{additional}} error on {{the temperature}} measurement {{arises from the}} pressure effect on the electromotive force induced by the Seebeck effect that is not taken into account (the ASTM E 230 /E 230 M standard is calibrated at <b>ambient</b> <b>pressures).</b> This pressure effect on the thermocouple {{is expected to be}} small at temperatures below 1500  °C and is universally neglected in high-pressure setups around the world [45].|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{graphite}} laser induced plasma dynamics are {{investigated by}} optical emission spectroscopy. Graphite plasma is generated using a 1064 nm Nd:YAG laser in helium environment under different <b>ambient</b> <b>pressures.</b> Characteristics of graphite spectra as lines intensity variations and {{signal to noise}} ratio are presented with main focus on the influence of the helium environment and pressure on plasma dynamics. Carbon atomic emission lines are used to study the dynamical behavior of plasma such as the excitation temperature and electron density to describe emission differences in different ambient conditions. The excitation temperature and plasma electron density are the primary factor contribute to the differences among the atomic carbon emission in different <b>ambient</b> <b>pressures...</b>|$|R
5|$|DCS {{is caused}} by a {{reduction}} in <b>ambient</b> <b>pressure</b> that results in the formation of bubbles of inert gases within tissues of the body. It may happen when leaving a high-pressure environment, ascending from depth, or ascending to altitude.|$|E
5|$|Decompression {{theory is}} the study and {{modelling}} of {{the transfer of the}} inert gas component of breathing gases from the gas in the lungs to the tissues of the diver and back during exposure to variations in <b>ambient</b> <b>pressure.</b> In the case of underwater diving and compressed air work, this mostly involves ambient pressures greater than the local surface pressure—but astronauts, high altitude mountaineers, and occupants of unpressurized aircraft, are exposed to ambient pressures less than standard sea level atmospheric pressure. In all cases, the symptoms of decompression sickness occur during or within {{a relatively short period of}} hours, or occasionally days, after a significant reduction of <b>ambient</b> <b>pressure.</b>|$|E
5|$|Efficient {{decompression}} {{from high}} pressures should start by rapidly halving the absolute pressure, {{followed by a}} slower ascent {{to ensure that the}} partial pressure in the tissues does not at any stage exceed about twice the <b>ambient</b> <b>pressure.</b>|$|E
50|$|At <b>ambient</b> <b>pressures</b> {{scandium}} trifluoride adopts the {{cubic crystal}} system, using the perovskite structure with one metal position vacant. The unit cell dimension is 4.01 Å. Under pressure scandium trifluoride also forms different crystal structures with rhombohedral, and above 3 GPa tetrahedral.|$|R
40|$|Organization and {{research}} {{activities of the}} entire NASA Space Biology Program are outlined. Various technical approaches are reported to study depressed metabolism particularly in the situation of 100 % oxygen and reduced <b>ambient</b> <b>pressures.</b> These include hibernation and hypothermia, thermal regulation, and diluent gases...|$|R
5|$|For example, rhenium diboride can be {{produced}} at <b>ambient</b> <b>pressures,</b> but is rather expensive because of rhenium. The hardness of ReB2 exhibits considerable anisotropy because of its hexagonal layered structure. Its value is {{comparable to that of}} tungsten carbide, silicon carbide, titanium diboride or zirconium diboride.|$|R
5|$|The {{cause of}} {{narcosis}} {{is related to}} the increased solubility of gases in body tissues, {{as a result of the}} elevated pressures at depth (Henry's law). Modern theories have suggested that inert gases dissolving in the lipid bilayer of cell membranes cause narcosis. More recently, researchers have been looking at neurotransmitter receptor protein mechanisms as a possible cause of narcosis. The breathing gas mix entering the diver's lungs will have the same pressure as the surrounding water, known as the <b>ambient</b> <b>pressure.</b> After any change of depth, the pressure of gases in the blood passing through the brain catches up with <b>ambient</b> <b>pressure</b> within a minute or two, which results in a delayed narcotic effect after descending to a new depth. Rapid compression potentiates narcosis owing to carbon dioxide retention.|$|E
5|$|The {{combined}} {{concentrations of}} gases {{in any given}} tissue depend {{on the history of}} pressure and gas composition. Under equilibrium conditions, the total concentration of dissolved gases is less than the ambient pressure—as oxygen is metabolized in the tissues, and the carbon dioxide produced is much more soluble. However, during a reduction in <b>ambient</b> <b>pressure,</b> the rate of pressure reduction may exceed the rate at which gas is eliminated by diffusion and perfusion. If the concentration gets too high, it may reach a stage where bubble formation can occur in the supersaturated tissues. When the pressure of gases in a bubble exceed the combined external pressures of <b>ambient</b> <b>pressure</b> and the surface tension of the bubble-liquid interface, the bubbles grow, and this growth can damage tissue.|$|E
5|$|Atmospheric {{pressure}} changes due {{to change}} of altitude {{before or after}} diving can have a significant influence on decompression risk. Diving at high altitude requires special consideration in decompression planning. Such variations in <b>ambient</b> <b>pressure</b> caused by flying or surface travel involving changes in altitude will affect decompression and should be considered during dive planning and therefore may influence a planned dive profile.|$|E
50|$|A {{theoretical}} prediction {{has been}} made based on {{the analysis of the}} equation above 5, that the 2S electron bubble exhibits a startling morphological instability under a wide range of <b>ambient</b> <b>pressures.</b> While its wave function is spherical, the stable shape of the bubble is nonspherical.|$|R
50|$|At {{atmospheric}} pressure the body tissues are therefore normally saturated with nitrogen at 0.758 bar (569 mmHg).At increased <b>ambient</b> <b>pressures</b> due to depth or habitat pressurisation, a diver's lungs {{are filled with}} breathing gas at the increased pressure, and the partial pressures of the constituent gases will be increased proportionately.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The paper {{describes}} {{the method of}} diagnostics of thermal plasma jet {{with the use of}} electric probes. Plasma potential and diameter of conducting zone were determined from the measurements at various <b>ambient</b> <b>pressures.</b> Dependence of floating plasma potential and plasma jet diameter on pressure was determined from the measurements...|$|R
5|$|Barotrauma, {{an example}} of dysbarism, is {{physical}} damage to body tissues caused by a difference in pressure between a gas space inside, or {{in contact with the}} body, and the surrounding gas or fluid. It typically occurs when the organism is exposed to a large change in <b>ambient</b> <b>pressure,</b> such as when a diver ascends or descends. When diving, the pressure differences which cause the barotrauma are changes in hydrostatic pressure.|$|E
5|$|Contaminated {{breathing}} gas {{at depth}} can be fatal. Concentrations which are acceptable {{at the surface}} <b>ambient</b> <b>pressure</b> will be increased by the pressure of depth and may then exceed acceptable or tolerable limits. Common contaminants are: carbon monoxide - a by-product of combustion, carbon dioxide - a product of metabolism, and oil and lubricants from the compressor.|$|E
5|$|Decompression in {{the context}} of diving derives from the {{reduction}} in <b>ambient</b> <b>pressure</b> experienced by the diver during the ascent {{at the end of a}} dive or hyperbaric exposure and refers to both the reduction in pressure and the process of allowing dissolved inert gases to be eliminated from the tissues during this reduction in pressure.|$|E
25|$|Albert R. Behnke {{proposed}} exposing divers to raised <b>ambient</b> <b>pressures</b> {{long enough}} for the tissues to saturate with inert gases in 1942. In 1957, George F. Bond began the Genesis project at the Naval Submarine Medical Research Laboratory proving that humans could withstand prolonged exposure to different breathing gases and increased environmental pressures.|$|R
40|$|An {{improved}} {{theoretical approach}} is proposed {{to predict the}} dynamic behavior of long, slender and flexible microcantilevers affected by squeeze-film damping at low <b>ambient</b> <b>pressures.</b> Our approach extends recent continuum gas damping models (Veijola 2004 J. Micromech. Microeng. 14 1109 – 18, Gallis and Torczynski 2004 J. Microelectromech. Syst. 13 653 – 9), which were originally derived for a rigid oscillating plate near a wall, to flexible microcantilevers for calculating and predicting squeeze-film damping ratios of higher order bending modes at reduced <b>ambient</b> <b>pressures.</b> Theoretical frequency response functions are derived for a flexible microcantilever beam excited both inertially and via external forcing. Experiments performed carefully at controlled gas pressures are used to validate our theoretical approach over five orders of the Knudsen number. In addition, we investigate {{the relative importance of}} theoretical assumptions made in the Reynolds-equation-based approach for flexible microelectromechanical systems...|$|R
2500|$|The {{performance}} of a regulator {{is measured by the}} [...] and work of breathing, and the capacity to deliver breathing gas at peak inspiratory flow rate at high <b>ambient</b> <b>pressures</b> without excessive pressure drop. For some applications the capacity to deliver high flow rates at low ambient temperatures without jamming due to freezing is important.|$|R
