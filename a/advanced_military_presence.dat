50|$|The Portuguese Cortes asked Sebastian {{several times}} to go to Morocco and stop the turmoil of the <b>advancing</b> Turkish <b>military</b> <b>presence,</b> because the Ottomans would {{be a threat to}} the {{security}} of the Portuguese coasts and to the commerce with Guinea, Brazil and the Atlantic Islands. But it was only when Abu Abdallah Mohammed II Saadi went to Portugal and asked for Sebastian's help in recovering his throne from his uncle that Sebastian decided to mount a military effort.
