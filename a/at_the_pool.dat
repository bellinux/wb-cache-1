25|$|As {{suddenly}} as they appeared, the tourists vanish. The fugitive {{returns to the}} museum to investigate and finds no evidence of people being there during his absence.

In the aquarium he encounters identical copies of the dead fish he found on his day of arrival. During a day <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool,</b> he sees the tourists jump to shake off the cold when the heat is unbearable. The strangest thing he notices is the presence of two suns and two moons in the sky.|$|E
