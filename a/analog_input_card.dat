It enables {{the development of a}} wide range of high performance analog ICs capable of 33 V operation in a footprint that no previous generation of high voltage parts could achieve. Unlike analog ICs using conventional CMOS processes, iCMOS components can accept bipolar input signals while providing increased performance, dramatically reduced power consumption, and reduced package size. The AD 7321 can accept true bipolar <b>analog</b> <b>input</b> signals. The AD 7321 has four software-selectable input ranges, ± 10 V, ± 5 V, ± 2. 5 V, and 0 V to + 10 V. Each <b>analog</b> <b>input</b> channel is independently programmed to one of the four <b>input</b> ranges. The <b>analog</b> <b>input</b> channels on the AD 7321 are programmed to be single-ended, true differential, or pseudo differential. The ADC contains a 2. 5 V internal reference. The AD 7321 also allows for external reference operation. If a 3 V reference is applied to the REFIN/OUT pin, the AD 7321 can accept a true bipolar ± 12 V <b>analog</b> <b>input.</b> A minimum of ± 12 V VDD and VSS supplies are required for the ± 12 V input range. The ADC has a high speed serial interface that can operate at throughput rates up to 500 kSPS...|$|R

40|$|We present {{progressive}} {{work that}} is based on our recently developed rapid control prototyping system (RCP), designed for the implementation of high-performance adaptive optical control algorithms using a continuous deformable mirror (DM). The RCP system, presented in 2014, is resorting to a Xilinx Kintex- 7 Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), placed on a self-developed PCIe card, and installed on a high-performance computer that runs a hard real-time Linux operating system. For this purpose, algorithms for the efficient evaluation of data from a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor (SHWFS) on an FPGA have been developed. The corresponding <b>analog</b> <b>input</b> and output <b>cards</b> are designed for exploiting the maximum possible performance while not being constrained to a specific DM and control algorithm due to the RCP approach. In this second part of our contribution, we focus on recent results that we achieved with this novel experimental setup. By presenting results which are far superior to the former ones, we further justify the deployment of the RCP system and its required time and resources. We conducted various experiments for revealing the effective performance, i. e. the maximum manageable complexity in the controller design that may be achieved in realtime without performance losses. A detailed analysis of the hidden latencies is carried out, showing that these latencies have been drastically reduced. In addition, a series of concepts relating the evaluation of the wavefront as well as designing and synthesizing a wavefront are thoroughly investigated with the goal to overcome some of the prevalent limitations. Furthermore, principal results regarding the closed-loop performance of the low-speed dynamics of the integrated heater in a DM concept are illustrated in detail; to be combined with the piezo-electric high-speed actuators in the next step...|$|R

40|$|During {{successive}} approximation analog to digital conversion {{a series of}} successive digital reference values is selected that converges towards a digital representation of an <b>analog</b> <b>input</b> signal. An <b>analog</b> reference signal is generated dependent on the successive digital reference values and compared to the <b>analog</b> <b>input</b> signal.

The comparison results define a series of successively narrower ranges of digital values that contain a digital representation of the <b>analog</b> <b>input</b> signal. Use of a plurality of comparator results for selecting the steps in the digital reference values makes it possible to reduce uncertainty about whether the comparison result has settled.
