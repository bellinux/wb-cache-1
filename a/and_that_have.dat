5|$|Plutoids are {{celestial}} {{bodies in}} orbit around the Sun at a semi-major axis {{greater than that of}} Neptune that have sufficient mass for their self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that they assume a hydrostatic equilibrium (near-spherical) shape, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> not cleared the neighbourhood around their orbit. Satellites of plutoids are not plutoids themselves.|$|E

With U2 bandmate The Edge, the couple co-own a 20-room villa in Èze in the Alpes-Maritimes in the south of France, where Bono and Hewson often mix with top celebrities. Hewson in particular has been friendly with several supermodels, which she uses to her advantage when booking charity events.|$|E
5|$|Males sing {{constantly}} as {{the breeding}} period approaches and perform less often once pairs have bonded. In {{the presence of}} a female, a male sometimes flies to his nest and sings from the entrance, apparently attempting to entice the female in. Older birds tend to have a wider repertoire than younger ones. Those males that engage in longer bouts of singing <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> wider repertoires attract mates earlier and have greater reproductive success than others. Females appear to prefer mates with more complex songs, perhaps because this indicates greater experience or longevity. Having a complex song is also useful in defending a territory and deterring less experienced males from encroaching.|$|E

5|$|The Financial Times {{poll was}} the result of over 10,000 {{respondents}} to nearly 23000 electronic questionnaires of alumni from 155 qualifying business schools. The survey began in July 2006 and all internationally accredited programs that are at least five years old <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> produced at least 30 graduates {{in each of the last}} three years were solicited. 113 of the 155 had at least 20 respondents and at least a 20 percent response rate. The questionnaire used twenty criteria in three main areas. The poll actually presents all twenty criteria to the reader. Eight criteria are based on alumni responses; eleven criteria are based on business school responses, and the final criterion is based on a research index produced by the Financial Times. The survey responses are audited by KPMG.|$|E
5|$|Unique to Black and White is the Pokémon Dream World, {{which is}} {{dependent}} on the official Pokémon Global Link website. Here, the player can befriend Pokémon that are not normally obtainable in-game <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> unique abilities. This occurs after syncing the game back with the Dream World, similarly to the Pokéwalker from HeartGold and SoulSilver. The player can maintain a house in the Dream World that other players can visit as well as grow berries. In addition to allowing access to Pokémon acquired in the Dream World, the Entralink also enables players to interact with each other and play side-games. These side-games award points that can be traded for temporary powers such as increasing experience, improving capture rate, or lowering prices of items in Poké Marts.|$|E

25|$|Mitochondrial tmRNA genes were {{initially}} recognized as short sequences that are conserved among jakobids <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> {{the potential to}} fold into a distinct tRNA-like secondary structure. With the availability of nine complete jakobid mtDNA sequences, and a significantly improved covariance search tool (Infernal;), a covariance model has been developed based on jakobid mitochondrial tmRNAs, which identified mitochondrial ssrA genes also in oomycete. At present, a total of 34 oomycete mt-tmRNAs have been detected across six genera: Albugo, Bremia, Phytophthora, Pseudoperonospora, Pythium and Saprolegnia. A covariance model built with both jakobid and oomycete sequences is now available at Rfam under the name ‘mt-tmRNA’.|$|E
