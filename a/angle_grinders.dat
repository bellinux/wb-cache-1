500|$|OPCW began {{preliminary}} {{inspections of}} Syria's chemical weapons arsenal on 1 October 2013, and actual destruction of Syrian equipment began on 6 October 2013, with Syrian personnel under OPCW supervision applying <b>angle</b> <b>grinders</b> and cutting torches to [...] "a {{wide range of}} items." [...] Specifically, under OPCW supervision Syrian military personnel had begun [...] "destroying munitions such as missile warheads and aerial bombs and disabling mobile and static mixing and filling units." [...] The U.S. and Russia announced themselves [...] "very pleased" [...] with the rapid pace of Syria's chemical arms disarmament. The Economist commented that the demanding timeline may mean the OPCW will deploy ad-hoc destruction methods such as sledgehammers, tanks, or concrete fills.|$|E

50|$|A {{disc cutter}} is a specialised, often hand-held, power tool used for cutting hard materials, for example ceramic tile.

5000|$|The <b>angle</b> <b>grinder</b> {{was invented}} in 1954 by German company Ackermann + Schmitt (FLEX-Elektrowerkzeuge GmbH) in Steinheim an der Murr. Owing to this, in German, Dutch, Slovak, Czech, Croatian, Latvian, Romanian, Hungarian and Bulgarian (and {{possibly}} in other languages), an <b>angle</b> <b>grinder</b> is colloquially called just a [...] "flex".|$|R
50|$|<b>Angle</b> <b>grinders</b> can be {{powered by}} an {{electric}} motor, petrol engine or compressed air. The motor drives a geared head at a right-angle on which is mounted an abrasive disc or a thinner cut-off disc, either {{of which can}} be replaced when worn. <b>Angle</b> <b>grinders</b> typically have an adjustable guard and a side-handle for two-handed operation. Certain <b>angle</b> <b>grinders,</b> depending on their speed range, can be used as sanders, employing a sanding disc with a backing pad or disc. The backing system is typically made of hard plastic, phenolic resin, or medium-hard rubber depending on the amount of flexibility desired.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{configuration}} of an algorithm {{to be used}} in a speech-passing <b>angle</b> <b>grinder</b> noise-canceling headset. <b>Angle</b> <b>grinder</b> noise is annoying and interrupts ordinary oral communication. Meaning that, low SNR noisy condition is ahead. Since variation in <b>angle</b> <b>grinder</b> working condition changes noise statistics, the noise will be nonstationary with possible jumps in its power. Studies are conducted for picking an appropriate algorithm. A modified version of the well-known spectral subtraction shows superior performance against alternate methods. Noise estimation is calculated through a multi-band fast adapting scheme. The algorithm is adapted very quickly to the non-stationary noise environment while inflecting minimum musical noise and speech distortion on the processed signal. Objective and subjective measures illustrating the performance of the proposed method are introduced. </p...|$|R

50|$|Some <b>angle</b> <b>{{grinders}},</b> most tile saws, {{and some}} grinders for sharpening blades used in woodworking are wet grinders. The fluid helps with lubrication of the cutting process and with cooling to avoid cracking or damaging {{the cutting tool}} or the workpiece.|$|E
50|$|Through a sound {{pressure}} level and vibrations {{study conducted by the}} National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, grinders under an unloaded condition ranged from 91 to 103 dBA. In addition, <b>angle</b> <b>grinders</b> produce sparks when cutting ferrous metals. They also produce shards cutting other materials. The blades themselves may also break. This is a great hazard to the face and eyes especially, as well as other parts of the body, and as such, a full face shield and other protective clothing must be worn. <b>Angle</b> <b>grinders</b> should never be used without their guard or handle attached; they are there as a necessary precaution for safety. All work should be securely clamped or held firmly in a vice.|$|E
50|$|<b>Angle</b> <b>grinders</b> {{are widely}} used in {{metalworking}} and construction, {{as well as in}} emergency rescues. They are commonly found in workshops, service garages and auto body repair shops. There is a large variety of <b>angle</b> <b>grinders</b> to choose from when trying to find the right one for the job. The most important factors in choosing the right grinder are the disc size and how powerful the motor is. Other factors include power source (pneumatic or electric), rpm, and arbor size. Generally disc size and power increase together. Disc size is usually measured in inches or millimetres. Common disc sizes for <b>angle</b> <b>grinders</b> in the U.S.A. include 4, 4.5, 5, 6, 7, 9 and 12 inches. Discs for pneumatic grinders also come much smaller. Pneumatic grinders are generally used for lighter duty jobs where more precision is required. This is likely because pneumatic grinders can be small and light yet remain powerful, because they do not contain heavy copper motor windings, while it is harder for an electric grinder to maintain adequate power with smaller size. Electric grinders are more commonly used for larger, heavy duty jobs. However, there are also small electric grinders and large pneumatic grinders.|$|E

3000|$|The paper [...] "Improved noise minimum {{statistics}} estimation algorithm {{for using}} {{in a speech}} passing noise rejection headset" [...] (S. Sayedtabaee et al.) deals with the practical industrial noise produced by rotating machinery (in this case, <b>angle</b> <b>grinder).</b> The problem {{is the fact that}} the strong <b>angle</b> <b>grinder</b> noise should be removed but oral communication should be preserved as much as possible. The headset for removing such noise is constructed with the installed microphone and speaker. The spectral substraction method is modified in order to achieve the <b>angle</b> <b>grinder</b> noise removal. Noise is estimated employing a multiband adaptive scheme. The algorithm adopts to changes of the noise characteristics in very fast manner with minimal distortion of other useful signals. The accuracy of the algorithm is tested using objective and subjective measures.|$|R
