5|$|On Friday, 6 July, President General Musharraf {{left for}} the flood-affected areas of Balochistan. As the president's {{aircraft}} took off from the Islamabad airport, militants fired anti-aircraft weapons <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> roof of {{a house in the}} Asghar Mall area of Rawalpindi. The militants' relationship with Lal Masjid remains unknown. Security forces recovered two anti-aircraft guns and a machine gun on the rooftop of a Rawalpindi high-rise, one mile (1.6km) from the airport. The government asserted that shots were heard minutes after the president's aircraft took off. Analysts suggest that it may have been retaliation for ongoing operations against Lal Masjid and the government's continued efforts to combat terrorism and Talibanization in northern Waziristan.|$|E

25|$|Because of bad {{information}} {{and lack of}} reconnaissance, two of the Union divisions in the infantry attack did not hit the Confederate left flank, but their movement by chance helped them to roll up the Confederate line by coming <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> end and rear. The first division in the attack under Brigadier General Romeyn B. Ayres alone overran the short right angled line {{on the left side}} of the Confederate main line. Sheridan's personal leadership helped encourage the men and focus them on their objective. Brigadier General Charles Griffin's division recovered from overshooting the Confederate left and helped roll up additional improvised Confederate defense lines. Brigadier General (Brevet Major General) Samuel W. Crawford's division swept across north of the main battle but then closed off Ford's Church Road, swept down to Five Forks and helped disperse the last line of Confederate infantry resistance. The Union cavalry was somewhat less successful. Although they pushed the Confederate cavalry back, most escaped while most of the Confederate infantry became casualties or prisoners.|$|E

25|$|The {{reason for}} the sad state of public transit is a very basic one - the transit systems just do not offer a service which will attract people away from their automobiles. Consequently, their {{patronage}} comes very largely from those who cannot drive, either because they are too young, too old, or because they are too poor to own and operate an automobile. Look <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> standpoint of a commuter {{who lives in a}} suburb and is trying to get to work in the central business district (CBD). If he is going to go by transit, a typical scenario might be the following: he must first walk to the closest bus stop, let us say a five or ten minute walk, and then he may have to wait up to another ten minutes, possibly in inclement weather, for the bus to arrive. When it arrives, he may have to stand unless he is lucky enough to find a seat. The bus will be caught up in street congestion and move slowly, and it will make many stops completely unrelated to his trip objective. The bus may then let him off at a terminal to a suburban train. Again he must wait, and, after boarding the train, again experience a number of stops {{on the way to the}} CBD, and possibly again he may have to stand in the aisle. He will get off at the station most convenient to his destination and possibly have to transfer again onto a distribution system. It is no wonder that in those cities where ample inexpensive parking is available, most of those who can drive do drive.|$|E

Their rod is six feet long, and their line is the same length. Then they throw their snare, and the fish, attracted and maddened by the color, comes straight <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> thinking <b>from</b> <b>the</b> pretty sight to gain a dainty mouthful; when, however, it opens its jaws, it is caught by the hook, and enjoys a bitter repast, a captive.|$|R
500|$|To avoid {{collision}} {{with the oil}} tanker, Alex and Dante go into the ship's bilge and use the bow thrusters to turn it. The ship screeches {{down the side of}} the tanker, but manages to withstand the damage, and heads straight into a marina. It then crashes into a Saint Martin town and eventually stops. Alex jumps off to rescue Annie and hijacks a speed boat. Geiger takes Annie into a seaplane. [...] Alex shoots <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> boat with a speargun and reels himself in through the water. He climbs onto the plane and rescues Annie, and both escape from the plane on one of its floats, which falls onto the ocean. Geiger loses control of the plane and crashes into the oil tanker, causing it to explode. The tanker crew however are safe, having launched their lifeboat just in time. Annie and Alex travel back to shore in the speed boat, and he gives her an engagement ring, asking her if she will [...] "wear it for a while", and she accepts.|$|E
500|$|Cooper's {{ability to}} project his {{personality}} onto his characters {{played an important}} part in his appearing natural and authentic on screen. Actor John Barrymore said of Cooper, [...] "This fellow is the world's greatest actor. He does without effort what the rest of us spend our lives trying to learn—namely, to be natural." [...] Charles Laughton, who played opposite Cooper in Devil and the Deep agreed, [...] "In truth, that boy hasn't the least idea how well he acts ... He gets <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> inside, from his own clear way of looking at life." [...] William Wyler, who directed Cooper in two films, called him a [...] "superb actor, a master of movie acting". In his review of Cooper's performance in The Real Glory, Graham Greene wrote, [...] "Sometimes his lean photogenic face seems to leave everything to the lens, but there is no question here of his not acting. Watch him inoculate the girl against cholera—the casual jab of the needle, and the dressing slapped on while he talks, as though a thousand arms had taught him where to stab and he doesn't have to think anymore." ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{science fiction}} heroes have, Porter argues, [...] "grown greyer over time", Jack {{represents}} as of Children of Earth a culmination of this trend, {{resulting in a}} full [...] "devolution/deconstruction of the traditional hero". In Children of Earth, Jack has to sacrifice his own grandson to save the world. Barrowman was concerned that the storyline could have made the character unpopular. He believes however that Jack was given the tough decision on how to save humanity; the actor says [...] "when I read all of the stuff he had to do, I had to look <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{point of view of}} 'I'm Jack Harkness and I'm right'." [...] For Lynnette Porter, Jack's actions in the serial make him [...] "a benchmark for [...] grey heroes"; some audiences may even view him, in light of his actions, as [...] "villainous or downright monstrous." [...] Although Jack ultimately saves the majority of the world's children and finds a way to foil the monstrous 456, the situation in which he is placed forces him to make a morally difficult (and to some viewers, reprehensible) decision. Such, Porter argues, is the mark of a grey hero. Davies stated in an interview with SFX that he [...] "loved" [...] the uproarious reaction to Jack's actions, defending the character in saying [...] "He saved every single child in the world! If you would fail to do that then you’re the monster, frankly. It’s this extraordinary treatment that only science fiction heroes get." [...] When Jack is departing Earth, the music playing is titled [...] "Redemption", signifying that his departure is also perhaps his redeeming act in the serial.|$|E
40|$|Ideas and {{knowledge}} of ethical leadership as something accomplished between the leader and the led, are becoming increasingly valuable. We propose a view from process philosophy in which relations determine individual leaders and followers, not the reverse. Each individual is a locus, in which a plurality of relational determinations interacts; the ethics of leadership is situated within this. The process perspective views leadership as an occasion we experience subjectively within ourselves, instead of simply looking <b>at</b> <b>it</b> objectively <b>from</b> <b>the</b> outside. Such a process perspective, grasping leadership as an internally complex occasion of experience, has implications for our {{understanding of what it}} means to be an ethical leader...|$|R

40|$|The {{premise of}} this article is that {{although}} photography is proliferating and diversifying, we still do not know what it is. In order {{to find out what it}} is, we must look <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> both <b>the</b> outside and the inside: we must consider both the condition of photography, and its ontology. New media studies, science and technology studies, and other related fields help to illuminate the condition of photography, or its exteriority. But it is philosophy which enables us to address, directly, and <b>from</b> <b>the</b> inside, the question of ontology. The article proposes that this ontology is one of becoming, not of Being, and that it can be understood through Bergson's terms of memory and intuition. Memory, as an ontology of becoming, constitutes the virtual life of photography, and intuition, as a method of understanding, enables us to apprehend it...|$|R
