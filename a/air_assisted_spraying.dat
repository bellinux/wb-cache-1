40|$|Phase Doppler/laser Doppler anemometry (PDA/LDA) and {{microscopic}} {{high speed}} imaging {{have been applied}} to an <b>air</b> <b>assisted</b> <b>spray</b> using three different biodiesels (fatty acid methyl esters of short, medium and long chain length) and ethanol. The momentum decay and droplet size characteristics of the four fuels have been compared {{as a function of}} Reynolds number, mass loading, and radial position for a number of downstream locations. The PDA/LDA results suggest that the spray characteristics are very similar past x/D = 5 showing that the majority of break-up occurs in the near exit plane region, with minimal secondary atomization occurring further downstream. Microscopic high speed imaging has revealed qualitative information on the breakup structure as a function of physical properties and downstream locations showing significantly different atomization behaviour at the exit plane. An automated image processing technique has been applied to calculate the liquid blockage area as a measure of the spray density and degree of atomization. The technique has revealed the dependence of liquid blockage area on the fuel physical properties, showing that the long chain length biodiesel has more unbroken liquid at the exit plane. Furthermore, a manual processing method has been used to provide detailed statistical information on the probability of occurence of shapes such as long ligaments, short ligaments, unbroken liquid volumes, and deformed droplets appearing in the spray. The probability of a long ligament appearing in the long chain biodiesel is much higher while ethanol and the short chain biodiesel have yielded very similar results. In addition to revealing information on the atomization characteristics of these biodiesels, the two image processing techniques suggest a simple and alternative way of characterizing atomizing sprays. 13 page(s...|$|R
40|$|The high VOC {{emissions}} from anthropogenic sources are detrimental {{to both the}} environment and humans, contributing with ground-level ozone and particle matter formation. Heterogeneous photocatalysis provides significant potential for VOC degradation. However, the approaches {{to be used for}} photocatalyst immobilization in scaled and highly efficient photoreactors are still not well established. Furthermore, {{there is a lack of}} reported photonic efficiencies and a shortage of required methods to establish these efficiencies. To address these issues, this PhD Dissertation reports the study of photonic efficiencies, TiO 2 immobilization on a stainless steel mesh and kinetic models in a scaled-up Photo-CREC-Air Reactor. Acetone and acetaldehyde are considered with a 25 - 320 initial concentration range. The irradiation field is experimentally evaluated in order to estimate the photon absorption on the TiO 2 film through macroscopic balances. Quantum Yields (QYs) and Photochemical Thermodynamic Efficiency Factors (PTEFs) are also established. TiO 2 coatings are prepared using two methods: an <b>Air</b> <b>Assisted</b> <b>Spray</b> with an Automatized Spinning Coating (TiO 2 -AAS-ASC) and a Spread Coating (TiO 2 -SCM). TiO 2 -AAS-ASC shows a more efficient use of the photocatalyst than the TiO 2 -SCM, and also displays homogeneity, limited particle agglomeration and stability under flow. Moreover, the TiO 2 -AAS-ASC shows a high degree of photonic energy utilization. A series-parallel Langmuir-Hinshelwood based kinetic model describes the photodegradation of acetone and acetaldehyde data well with a 0. 97 - 0. 98 range correlation coefficient. It is believed that altogether the approach reported in the present PhD Dissertation contributes to clarify key engineering issues of significant value for the scale-up of photocatalytic reactors for air treatment...|$|R

The thin films from different Zn acetate precursor solution concentrations (0. 1, 0. 2, 0. 3 and 0. 4 M) were deposited at several temperatures (400, 450 and 500 °C) with thickness from ∼ 100 to ∼ 500 nm. The effects of precursor solution concentration, deposition time and temperature on the structural, morphological, optical, and electrical properties of ZnO films were studied by X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), UV–Vis-NIR spectroscopy, and Hall Effect techniques, respectively.

Highly skilled labors {{and a number of}} adjustable knobs are required to produce the high quality coating works using the conventional au-tomatic spray gun which is cost intensive. Therefore, linear motor operated multiple spray operations spray gun has been developed. This spray gun consists of two spray units, an air control and supply unit and a triggering unit to carry out the multiple spray operations. This paper focuses on the design optimization and fabrication of the housing of the spray units which hold fluid nozzles, air nozzles, an assembly cap, a needle valve or a ball valve. In the air less and <b>air</b> <b>assisted</b> airless <b>spray</b> systems, high pressurized liquid is passed through the nozzle which is held by the housing of the spray unit. Before entering into the nozzle, the high pressurized liquid is passed through the housing. For the simplicity of the analysis, it is assumed that the housing is an open-ended pressure vessel. From the analysis, dimensions and material selection have been optimized and finally the spray units have been fabricated and tested. During the performance test it is seen that satisfactory transfer efficiency of spray operation has been achieved by using newly developed spray housing of the spray units, which proves the stability of the spray housing during high pressure operation...|$|R

The physico-chemical, structural and functional properties of synthesized ZnO nanoparticles have {{been characterized by}} X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), Brunauer, Emmett and Teller (BET) method, UV–vis spectroscopy and photoluminescence (PL) measurements. Also, the photocatalytic activities of ZnO synthesized from different precursor concentrations were evaluated by removal rate of methyleneblue (MB) under UV irradiation (365 nm) at room temperature. SEM revealed two types of ZnO nanoparticles: a quasi-spherical, desert-rose like shape of the secondary particles, which does not change significantly with the increasing of precursor solution concentration {{as well as some}} content of the broken spheres. Increasing the precursor solution concentration leads to the increase in the average size of ZnO secondary particles from 248 ± 73 to 920 ± 190 nm, XRD reveals the similar tendency for the crystallite size which changes from 23 ± 4 to 55 ± 12 nm in the analyzed region. HRTEM implies the secondary particles are with hierarchical structure composed of primary nanosized subunits. The PL spectra imply a typical broad peak of wavelength centered in the visible region exhibiting the corresponding red-shift with the increase of solution concentration: 560, 583 and 586 nm for the 0. 01, 0. 1 and 1. 0 M solution, respectively.

40|$|The Environmental {{and health}} risks of {{pesticide}} application {{have been the}} subject of research for more than fifty years and still continue to be a great concern. Ground/surface water contamination and bystander exposure from pesticide drift occurring during and after application and health risks of excessive pesticide residues detected on agricultural products are continuously in the spotlight. Orchard spray application received special emphasis due to the relatively large amount of pesticides applied and the complexity of the process involved. Both experimental and modelling approaches have been used in the past to determine pesticide drift for regulatory risk assessment studies. However, the complexity and variability of the drift process and the efforts needed for a proper analysis remain considerable hurdles in development of approaches to mitigate negative impacts of spraying. The main objective of this thesis was, therefore, to contribute to the understanding of spray deposition and drift in orchards by developing a mechanistic drift model of the <b>air</b> <b>assisted</b> <b>spray</b> process using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). An integrated research approach combining experiments and simulations was used throughout the thesis. Spray nozzles and three different air-assisted orchard sprayer designs (a cross-flow sprayer, an axial sprayer and a sprayer with individual spouts) were first characterized under controlled laboratory conditions in terms of their spray liquid distribution and air flow pattern. The results obtained from this indoor trials were used to validate a CFD orchard spray model. The results obtained from both the experiment and the CFD model showed important differences in air flow pattern and liquid distribution generated by the different sprayer designs. It was also seen that the liquid distribution follows the air flow pattern which is strongly influenced by the architecture of the air discharge unit on the sprayers. The CFD model was further used to optimize the outlet design of the sprayer with individual spouts. The measurement and modelling of the spray distribution was done at this stage using a vertical patternator wall rather than the actual trees. An extensive field trial was then performed using the three <b>air</b> <b>assisted</b> orchard sprayers designs and four different training systems of apple and pear to investigate the effect of tree architecture on spray distribution and to check whether the differences in air flow profiles among the three sprayer designs affect the on-target spray distribution. The results obtained showed that total leaf cover, leaf wall porosity and tree volume strongly affected the total on-target deposition. There was a strong relationship between the vertical leaf deposition profile and the air flow pattern from the sprayers. Predicted vertical deposition profiles from a canopy CFD model of spray application in orchards that incorporates the actual tree architecture, were validated against experimental profiles. This CFD model was then used to assess the effect of wind and sprayer design on spray distribution within the four training systems. The analysis performed on the axial sprayer using the CFD model showed that wind blowing in the direction of spraying actually gave the largest deposition on the tree, constraining the spray in the canopy region. A wind direction opposite to the spraying direction, however, resulted in an increase of the ground deposition and the amount of spray remaining in air. Further analysis on the effect of increasing the magnitude of a cross flow wind showed an increase in the off-target spray distribution. The CFD model was further elaborated to predict spray drift from orchard sprayers away from the orchard. This model was validated against drift measurements from an apple orchard with different nozzle arrangements. The model predicted the transient spray profile, calculates the fraction captured by the trees, the airborne spray and the ground deposition up to 40 m from the last tree row in agreement with the measured profiles. This model was then used to evaluate the effect of drift reducing nozzles and fan speed on drift. Drift reducing nozzles reduced the drift distance (the maximum downstream distance droplets travel behind the target canopy), but increased near-tree ground deposition. Further analysis done using different nozzle arrangements showed that the increase in ground deposition near the tree can be avoided (keeping the reduction in the drift distance) by combining the drift reducing nozzles with the standard ones. A reduced sprayer airflow resulted in further reduction of the percentage drift. The analysis showed that the model can be used to analyse different drift mitigation strategies and perform sprayer optimization. Future investigations could focus on developing a database of drift curves that are obtained from in silico experiments performed under different orchard spraying scenarios using the developed model. These drift curves could then be used to develop online drift monitoring tools or combined with recommended drift mitigation scenarios to be used by applicators. status: publishe...|$|R

One hundred percent mortality of the most tolerant stage of Queensland fruit fly (Bactrocera tryoni, Froggatt) and Jarvis's fruit fly (Bactrocera jarvisi, Tryon), were observed when the Mortality value (M 52, equivalent time of isothermal treatment at 52 °C) at the slowest heating point applicable for each experiment was ≥ 50 min and ≥ 37 min, respectively.
