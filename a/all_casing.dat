5000|$|As briefly {{discussed}} in Unicode Technical Note #26, [...] "In terms of implementation issues, any {{attempt at a}} unification of Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic would wreak havoc and make casing operations an unholy mess, in effect making <b>all</b> <b>casing</b> operations context sensitive …". In other words, while the shapes of letters like A, B, E, H, K, M, O, P, T, X, Y and so on are shared between the Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic alphabets (and small differences in their canonical forms may {{be considered to be}} of a merely typographical nature), it would still be problematic for a multilingual character set or a font to provide only a single codepoint for, say, uppercase letter B, as this would make it quite difficult for a wordprocessor to change that single uppercase letter to one of the three different choices for the lower-case letter, the Latin b (U+0062), Greek β (U+03B2) or Cyrillic в (U+0432). Therefore, the corresponding Latin, Greek and Cyrillic upper-case letters (U+0042, U+0392 and U+0412, respectively) are also encoded as separate characters, despite their appearance being basically identical. Without letter case, a [...] "unified European alphabet"such as ABБCГDΔΕЄЗFΦGHIИJ…Z, with an appropriate subset for each languageis feasible; but considering letter case, it becomes very clear that these alphabets are rather distinct sets of symbols.|$|E
40|$|Final well {{diameter}} and casing program in both oil and mining industries {{are directly related}} to production volume. Solutions to enhance production volume and increase income are always of great value. This thesis is working out how final diameter and casing program may improve from the previous presented casing program of the geothermal well SCH 2 - 1 located near Sebechleby, Slovakia. Particularly the {{well diameter}} at bottom of the volcanic formation is of interest. The issues with the expected corrosive and acid environments are considered in designing casing program. Suggestions of kick off points for sidetrack wells are provided before thesis start, alternative to these kick off points as well as work plan for the sidetrack well are studied here. Karst caverns are predicted in this formation and bridging these caverns to keep them intact is of importance for the production of the well. Research of these topics has shown that expandable or combinations of conventional and expandable casing programs are highly able to improve well diameter, both at bottom of volcanic formation and {{at the bottom of the}} well. The most promising suggestion is providing inner diameters of casing that is 18. 01 ? and 14. 49 ?, at bottom of the volcanic formation and at final well depth, respectively. Less expensive solutions with lesser casing diameter is presented. <b>All</b> <b>casing</b> suggestions are designed and compared to anticipated pressures. Material behavior and properties is calculated for all suggestions, both during and after expansion. Study of expandable casing versus corrosion and acid environment shows that the material corrosion resistivity not a concern. The expansion process does not have a significant impact on the material corrosion properties. An alternative kick off point has been suggested and a work plan using monobore liner system for the sidetrack is presented. The monobore liner system will cost more than conventional liner, but study of monobore does not present any length limitations of the sidetrack. Bridging of karst caverns solution is presented using expandable liners. If the wellbore size is sufficient small, monobore would prove most promising for this task. Theoretical calculations, backed by a literature study on the topic are implying that expandable casing systems should be used in production enhancing for this well. </p...|$|E

Soon after the United States entered the war, in a talk with the officer in charge of the design and production of artillery ammunition, he found that the French type of shell and components had been decided upon, but that the design of the booster casing had been modified by doing away with the taper on its outside because of its being too difficult to permit of manufacture in large quantities, and substituting for it a straight cylindrical surface. Furthermore, Mr. Carlson found that the Department, having been advised by competent manufacturers that even the straight-sided booster casing could not be drawn from the flat sheet, owing to its enlarged threaded end, had fully decided to machine <b>all</b> <b>casings</b> from the solid bar in automatic screw machines.

30|$|First item in {{the design}} steps is to {{determine}} the outside diameter of production casing. This parameter is fixed to 5.5 in. which is commonly used in Marcellus shale gas well production. The sizes of the four other casings can be determined based {{on the size of the}} production casing. The outside diameter of the coupling used on production casing is 6.05 in. As discussed earlier, the surface subsidence in coal mine area can cause large vertical and horizontal ground displacement. In this case, the horizontal displacement would cause the bending effect on the casings, which will be discussed later. As for other casing’s annular space, the Pennsylvania Code requires that <b>all</b> permanent <b>casing</b> be surrounded by a minimum of 25  mm (1 inch) of grout at the entire length of casing. Therefore according to the cementing tables of Halliburton and design code of wellbores in Pennsylvania, one can determine the sizes of other casings and couplings. After the casing size is determined, the corresponding bit size can be selected using the bit size table in Fig.  6. Figure  8 shows the schematic view of the designed casings.|$|R
30|$|To {{determine}} <b>all</b> {{types of}} <b>casing’s</b> sizes applied in a well, {{one needs to}} start from the smallest casing string to be run in a hole. Once the smallest casing is fixed, other series of casing size and hole sizes can be determined. The smallest casing size is selected based on well testing and logging tools and production tools to be run in the well. In our case, the production casing, which is the smallest casing, is 5 1 / 2 in. Figure  6 shows a typical tubing and bit selection chart. The bit sizes and other casing sizes can be selected according to this chart. After selecting the smaller casing sizes, proper bit and a larger casing string for the following run can be selected.|$|R
30|$|In this section, {{a casing}} design model is {{introduced}} to design casing strings for a gas {{well in the}} longwall mining area for production from the Marcellus shale. The stress/strain data are obtained using numerical modeling of ground. The data used in the completion design are obtained by using a query function, which lists the calculated parameters along a vertical line representing the gas well. The stress/strain data obtained from modeling {{are used in the}} background spreadsheet for casing design and are not accessible by users. Also, the horizontal displacement observed from the FEA model needs to be considered in the casing design modeling. For mining geometries other than the one set forth, background stress and strain data need {{to be added to the}} spreadsheet prior to undertaking casing design. There are five types of casing to be used in gas well completion in the longwall mining areas. This system was included in the base casing/completion design model. The casings include: drive pipe, aquifer casing, coal protection casing, intermediate casing, and production casing. The model is built into a spreadsheet and allows an interactive design by changing the input parameters and shows the resulting casing and well completion design parameters. Figure  7 displays the interface of inputs in this model. In the case considered in this study, the coal seam depth is fixed to 200  m (660 – 670 ft). The depth of groundwater can be varied to between 60 and 120  m (200 – 400 ft). Through the input interface in this model, users are also allowed to input safety factors, which are used to quantify the minimum strength of <b>all</b> <b>casings.</b> Then by selecting the “read safety factors” and corresponding buttons, the user can see the results for various casing sizes. Users are able to click the “start over” button to erase all input data and calculated results, and retype other groups of data as needed. For the selection of casing, four tables of casings with various minimum performance properties were put at the right side of the buttons with the name of casings. After the initial setting and data entry, the model automatically selects proper casing size and grade for the aquifer casing, coal protection casing, intermediate casing, and drive pipe. Then, the numbers of available casings will appear in the “Results” column on the left side of the input data for manual selection of feasible casings for the given geometric and ground conditions. As noted before, if the geometry of the longwall panels, including the depth, width of the panel and size of the pillars change, numerical modeling has to be performed to revise the background data on stresses and strain that should be used in the wellbore completion design program.|$|R

40|$|Ballistic imaging systems {{help solve}} crimes by {{comparing}} newly acquired images of cartridge casings or bullets to {{a database of}} images obtained from past crime scenes. We formulate and solve an optimization problem that bases its matching decisions (i. e., which database images should be forwarded to firearm examiners for verification) {{not only on the}} similarity scores between pairs of images, but also on extraneous data on the evidence status (i. e., whether the casings or bullets are recovered from a crime scene or elsewhere) of each new acquisition and the time and spatial location of each acquisition and each database entry. The objective is to maximize the detection probability (i. e., the probability that at least one true match in the database is detected given that at least one exists) subject to a constraint on the expected number of false positives. Using data on <b>all</b> cartridge <b>casings</b> matches detected in Israel during 2006 - 2008, we predict that the optimal use of extraneous information would increase the detection probability from 0. 931 to 0. 987 (i. e., a 81. 4 % reduction in the false negative rate), which is achieved by favoring (via setting lower similarity-score thresholds for generating a match) pairs of images that are closer together in space and time. An application of our model to the U. S. suggests that an optimal national search strategy, which favors local searches over inter-state searches, would increase the detection probability relative to current U.
