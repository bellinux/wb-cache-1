5|$|After World War II, Syracuse University {{began to}} {{transform}} {{into a major}} research institution. Enrollment increased {{in the four years}} after the war due to the G.I. Bill, which paid tuition, room, board, and a small <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> veterans returning from World War II. In 1946, SU admitted 9,464 freshmen, nearly four times greater than the previous incoming class. Branch campuses were established in Endicott, New York and Utica, New York.|$|E

30|$|In {{the pilot}} ETSs in China, a {{majority}} of <b>allowances</b> are allocated <b>for</b> free, with a relatively small portion being auctioned in Shenzhen and Guangdong. Grandfathering is applied to allocate <b>allowances</b> <b>for</b> cogeneration units in Guangdong, and benchmarking is adopted to allocate <b>allowances</b> <b>for</b> coal-fired and gas-fired units in Shanghai. As China has a steadily growing economy, a benchmarking method based on actual output (rather than historical output) is planned to allocate <b>allowances</b> <b>for</b> generation companies in the national level ETS, in order to balance emission reduction and economic growth.|$|R

5|$|Men {{who worked}} for farmers or {{psychiatric}} hospitals received regular wages, which {{they were required to}} give to the federal government. Objections to this practice developed immediately because the men felt they were helping to fund the war. A compromise was reached where the wages were put into a special fund that was unused until {{after the end of the}} war. At one point, church representatives attempted unsuccessfully to have these funds used for providing a living <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> the men's dependents.|$|E
5|$|At age ten, {{with her}} father's fortune disappearing in London, Singh {{attempted}} {{to move to}} India with her father and sisters but they were turned back in Aden by arrest warrants. Although her father disowned her, in 1896 Victoria gave her the three-story Faraday House and a £200 <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> its maintenance. Singh, who styled herself the Queen of the Punjab, did not initially live in Faraday House; she stayed at the Manor House in Old Buckenham, near her brother Prince Frederick. After a period of ill health, her father died in a rundown Paris hotel on 22October 1895 at age 55.|$|E

5000|$|Emissions allocation: Under the Clear Skies Act, {{emission}} allowances are to {{be allocated}} based on historical fuel consumption, what {{is often referred to}} as [...] "grandfathering". Under the Clean Air Planning Act, a grandfathering approach is used to allocate emission <b>allowances</b> <b>for</b> SO2, but <b>allowances</b> <b>for</b> NOx, mercury, and CO2, are allocated using an output-based scheme. Under this approach, referred to as a generation performance standard (GPS), generators are given <b>allowances</b> <b>for</b> each unit of electricity they generate. The number of <b>allowances</b> allocated <b>for</b> each unit of generation changes each year as the total generation from covered sources changes. The use of a GPS dampens the electricity price impacts of the bill but raises overall compliance costs.|$|R

5|$|Beyond {{the obvious}} honour, the award also carries a cash <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> those under {{the rank of}} {{lieutenant}} (or the appropriate service equivalent), {{and in some cases}} a cash award. Upon the death of the recipient, the pension is transferred to the widow until her death or remarriage. In the case of a posthumous recipient who is a bachelor, the allowance is paid to his father or mother. In the case of the award being conferred posthumously on a widower, the allowance is to be paid to his son or unmarried daughter. A monthly stipend of 10,000 rupees is given the awardee. The award amount and pension benefits are exempted from income tax. In addition, different ministries under the Central Government have various awards for PVC winners.|$|E
5|$|FreeSpace 2 {{has many}} helpful {{features}} available. The player can target enemies attacking a protected objective or match speeds with them. Power can be shunted between shields, engines, and weapons, thereby allowing faster recharge of shields, afterburners, and weapons {{at the expense}} of other subsystems. These features can be ignored without any detrimental effects on gameplay. The mission parameters are not rigidly fixed, as there is an <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> the failures of some primary objectives. When the mission is concluded, a post-mission briefing will be conducted to discuss the mission, and the performance of the player, before the next mission can be taken on.|$|E

5|$|Reformed Christians {{believe that}} {{immersion}} {{is not necessary}} for baptism to be properly performed, but that pouring or sprinkling are acceptable. Sprinkling is said to symbolize the sprinkling of the blood of Christ {{for the removal of}} the guilt of sin. Only ordained ministers are permitted to administer baptism in Reformed churches, contrary to the <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> emergency baptism by midwives in Roman Catholic churches, though baptisms performed by non-ministers are generally considered valid. Reformed churches, while rejecting the baptismal ceremonies of the Roman Catholic church (such as the use of chrism, salt, and insufflation), accept the validity of baptisms performed with them on the basis that the substance of baptism remains. They do not rebaptize someone who has been baptized using these ceremonies because baptism is never to be repeated.|$|E
5|$|The Pizza Burger is {{a burger}} sold {{exclusively}} at the BK Whopper Bar location in Times Square, New York City that {{was introduced in}} September 2010. It consists of four Whopper patties on a 9.5inch sesame bun, sliced into six pieces and topped with pepperoni, mozzarella, basil pesto and marinara sauce. The whole burger contains more than the recommended daily allowance of calories for men at 2,520 calories, with 144grams of fat, 59g of which is saturated, and 3,780mg of sodium, {{more than double the}} recommended daily <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> adults. However, according to Burger King's Vice President of global marketing, John Schaufelberger, the burger is not intended to feed just one person. Each slice has 420 calories, 24g fat (10g saturated), and 630mg sodium.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} a number of {{proposals}} to extend the O-Bahn to Golden Grove or build other routes, however none have progressed beyond consultation. An extension to Golden Grove would require the acquisition of extensive tracts of private property, due to the absence of an available corridor. Population increase in the area is negligible, although sprawl continues from Tea Tree Plaza Interchange for another eight kilometres to the Adelaide Hills. The current route was built with an <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> a station at Grand Junction Road but it has not been built.|$|E
30|$|With 149.2 million <b>allowances</b> {{allocated}} <b>for</b> free (see above), airlines {{will need}} to buy <b>allowances</b> <b>for</b> about 74.4 million tonnes of CO 2 -emissions.

The results also show that CO 2 <b>allowances</b> <b>for</b> about 48.1 million tonnes {{will have to be}} purchased by aircraft operators from other sectors, as only 175.5 million new allowances will be available to the aviation sector on the basis of Directive 2008 / 101 /EC.|$|R

5|$|Which {{part of the}} {{electromagnetic}} spectrum—the visible, near-infrared (NIR) or mid-infrared (MIR)—produces the most accurate angular measurement is still debated. In 1996, Betelgeuse was shown to have a uniform disk of 56.6 ± 1.0mas. In 2000, the SSL team produced another measure of 54.7 ± 0.3mas, ignoring any possible contribution from hotspots, which are less noticeable in the mid-infrared. Also included was a theoretical <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> limb darkening, yielding a diameter of 55.2 ± 0.5mas. The earlier estimate equates to a radius of roughly 5.6AU or , assuming the 2008 Harper distance of 197.0 ± 45pc, a figure {{roughly the size of}} the Jovian orbit of 5.5AU, published in 2009 in Astronomy Magazine and a year later in NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, {{they moved}} to St. Louis, Missouri, as Washington University offered both Carl and Gerty positions, {{although}} Gerty's rank and salary were much lower than her husband's. Despite her research background, Gerty was only offered a position as a research associate at a salary one tenth of that received by her husband; she was warned that she might harm her husband's career. Washington University's Chancellor, Arthur Holley Compton made a special <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> Gerty {{to hold a position}} there, going against the university's nepotism rules. Gerty had to wait thirteen years before she attained the same rank as her husband. In 1943, she was made an associate professor of Research Biological Chemistry and Pharmacology. Months before she won the Nobel Prize, she was promoted to full professor, a post she held until her death in 1957.|$|E
5|$|Three {{years after}} the {{inconclusive}} skirmish at Largs, terms of peace were finally agreed upon between the kingdoms of Norway and Scotland. On 2 July 1266, with {{the conclusion of the}} Treaty of Perth, the centuries-old territorial dispute over Scotland's western seaboard was at last settled. Within the treaty, Magnús Hákonarson, King of Norway (died 1280) ceded the Hebrides and Mann to Alexander, who in turn agreed to pay 4,000 merks sterling over four years, and in addition to pay 100 merks sterling in perpetuity. Other conditions stipulated that the inhabitants of the islands would be subject to laws of Scotland; that they were not to be punished for their actions previous to the treaty; and that they were free to remain or leave their possessions peacefully. In 1266, the Chronicle of Lanercost records that Alexander ruled Mann through appointed bailiffs; Scottish exchequer accounts record that the Sheriff of Dumfries was given <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> maintaining seven Manx hostages.|$|E

5|$|A {{standard}} adult football match {{consists of}} two periods of 45 minutes each, known as halves. Each half runs continuously, meaning that the clock is not stopped when the ball is out of play. There is usually a 15-minute half-time break between halves. The end of the match is known as full-time. The referee is the official timekeeper for the match, and may make an <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> time lost through substitutions, injured players requiring attention, or other stoppages. This added time is called additional time in FIFA documents, but is most {{commonly referred to as}} stoppage time or injury time, while loss time can also be used as a synonym. The duration of stoppage time is at the sole discretion of the referee. The referee alone signals the end of the match. In matches where a fourth official is appointed, {{towards the end of the}} half the referee signals how many minutes of stoppage time he intends to add. The fourth official then informs the players and spectators by holding up a board showing this number. The signalled stoppage time may be further extended by the referee. Added time was introduced because of an incident which happened in 1891 during a match between Stoke and Aston Villa. Trailing 1–0 and with just two minutes remaining, Stoke were awarded a penalty. Villa's goalkeeper kicked the ball out of the ground, and by the time the ball had been recovered, the 90minutes had elapsed and the game was over. The same law also states that the duration of either half is extended until the penalty kick to be taken or retaken is completed, thus no game shall end with a penalty to be taken.|$|E
