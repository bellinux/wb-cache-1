5|$|Icke {{combines}} New Age philosophical discussion <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> {{and consciousness}} with conspiracy theories about public figures being reptilian humanoids and paedophiles.

5|$|On atheism, Sagan commented in 1981: An atheist {{is someone}} who is certain that God does not exist, someone who has {{compelling}} evidence against the existence of God.

Because God can be relegated to remote times and places and to ultimate causes, {{we would have to}} know a great deal more <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> than we do now to be sure that no such God exists. To be certain of the existence of God and to be certain of the nonexistence of God seem to me to be the confident extremes in a subject so riddled with doubt and uncertainty as to inspire very little confidence indeed.|$|E
5|$|The {{prevailing}} {{model for}} the evolution of the Universe is the Big Bang theory. The Big Bang model states that the earliest state of the Universe was extremely hot and dense and that it subsequently expanded. The model is based on general relativity and on simplifying assumptions such as homogeneity and isotropy of space. A version of the model with a cosmological constant (Lambda) and cold dark matter, known as the Lambda-CDM model, is the simplest model that provides a reasonably good account of various observations <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>Universe.</b> The Big Bang model accounts for observations such as the correlation of distance and redshift of galaxies, the ratio of the number of hydrogen to helium atoms, and the microwave radiation background.|$|E
25|$|Another {{common theme}} is taking facts <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{computational}} <b>universe</b> {{as a whole}} and using them to reason about fields in a holistic way.

25|$|General {{relativity}} predicts gravitational waves, as {{does any}} theory of gravitation in which {{changes in the}} gravitational field propagate at a finite speed.

Gravitational-wave astronomy can test general relativity by verifying that the observed waves are of the form predicted (for example, that they only have two transverse polarizations), and by checking that black holes are the objects described by solutions of the Einstein field equations.|$|E

25|$|Further work by Hawking in {{the area}} of arrows of time led to the 1985 {{publication}} of a paper theorising that if the no-boundary proposition were correct, then when the universe stopped expanding and eventually collapsed, time would run backwards. A paper by Don Page and independent calculations by Raymond Laflamme led Hawking to withdraw this concept. Honours continued to be awarded: in 1981 he was awarded the American Franklin Medal, and in 1982 made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE). Awards do not pay the bills, however, and motivated by the need to finance the children's education and home expenses, in 1982 Hawking determined to write a popular book <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> that would be accessible to the general public. Instead of publishing with an academic press, he signed a contract with Bantam Books, a mass market publisher, and received a large advance for his book. A first draft of the book, called A Brief History of Time, was completed in 1984.|$|E

500|$|In {{developing}} the Participatory Anthropic Principle (PAP), an , Wheeler used a variant on Twenty Questions, called Negative Twenty Questions, {{to show how}} the questions we choose to ask <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> may dictate the answers we get. In this variant, the respondent does not choose or decide upon any particular or definite object beforehand, but only on a pattern of [...] "Yes" [...] or [...] "No" [...] answers. This variant requires the respondent to provide a consistent set of answers to successive questions, so that each answer can be viewed as logically compatible with all the previous answers. In this way, successive questions narrow the options until the questioner settles upon a definite object. Wheeler's theory was that, in an analogous manner, consciousness may play some role in bringing the universe into existence.|$|E

At its height, ilovebees received between two and three million unique visitors over the course of three months. 9,000 people also actively participated in the real-world aspects of the game. The players of I Love Bees themselves were quite varied. The target demographic for the promotion was younger males, but one player noted that even middle-aged men and women were engaged in the game.|$|E
500|$|The {{animated}} series {{received a}} generally positive reception in North America. [...] In January 2004, Yu Yu Hakusho {{was named the}} second best action-adventure anime by Anime Insider. It was voted by the users of IGN as the tenth best animated series of all time. Critical reviews focused on the series' attempt at a versatile balance of narrative, character development, and action sequences. Animerica's Justin Kovalsky defined Yu Yu Hakusho as a character-driven series and compared it to other anime like Phantom Quest Corp., Rurouni Kenshin, and Flame of Recca in that it successfully combines different ideas such as martial arts battles, character dynamics, the supernatural, and mythology. Allen Divers of the Anime News Network identified Yu Yu Hakusho as [...] "one of the best action series out there", and noted consistently good storytelling and character development throughout his critique of key points of the series. Todd Douglass Jr. of DVD Talk declared, [...] "It's a fun show with a great cast, a sense of humor, {{and a lot of}} action so there's no excuse not to at least give it a chance." [...] He recommended the first three-season box sets of Yu Yu Hakusho, as well as the original boxset of the Three Kings Saga, but enjoyed the show's third season more than the others because of its multiple plotlines. N. S. Davidson of IGN concluded that having several concurrent plot branches is not enough for an anime to succeed, but that good writing, interesting characters, and action are also necessary. He proclaimed in his review of the anime's final episodes that Yu Yu Hakusho possesses all of these qualities. This was concurred upon by Joseph Luster of Otaku USA, who summed up his feelings <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> of Yu Yu Hakusho by stating, [...] "Togashi's world is eternally hellish and dark, but wildly varied. The only thing that doesn't change throughout its run is the fact that you'll still be rooting for the well-defined protagonists until the credits run on the last episode." ...|$|E

5|$|The Big Bang as {{the origin}} of the universe: One of <b>the</b> common mis{{conception}}s <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Big Bang model is the belief that it was {{the origin of}} <b>the</b> <b>universe.</b> However, <b>the</b> Big Bang model does not comment <b>about</b> how <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> came into being.
