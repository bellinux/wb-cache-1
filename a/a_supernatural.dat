5|$|Dawkins is an atheist, and is {{well known}} for his {{criticism}} of creationism and intelligent design. In The Blind Watchmaker (1986), he argues against the watchmaker analogy, an argument for the existence of <b>a</b> <b>supernatural</b> creator based upon the complexity of living organisms. Instead, he describes evolutionary processes as analogous to a blind watchmaker in that reproduction, mutation, and selection are unguided by any designer. In The God Delusion (2006), Dawkins contends that <b>a</b> <b>supernatural</b> creator almost certainly does not exist and that religious faith is a delusion. He opposes the teaching of creationism in schools.|$|E
5|$|A sequel, titled Boogeyman 3, premiered at the Screamfest Horror Film Festival on October 18, 2008 and was {{released}} direct-to-video in January 20, 2009. Brian Sieve came back as writer, but the film features new cast members and characters, taking place {{on a college campus}} and starring Erin Cahill. As with the first movie, the Boogeyman is portrayed as <b>a</b> <b>supernatural</b> entity.|$|E
5|$|Snakes on a Plane debuted on August 18, 2006. The film {{opened in}} 3,555 theaters {{and had some}} late-night {{screenings}} on August 17.

5|$|After {{the episode}} was submitted, several re-writes were requested. Originally, {{the story was}} {{supposed}} to take place in Oklahoma, noted for being the center of Tornado Alley. For budgetary reasons, the episode was relocated to Mississippi. Another scene, originally scripted to take place at a motel, featured Pinker taking a short cut through a wall. This scene was cut not only because of budgetary reasons, but also because the writers and producers wanted to shift the episode from <b>a</b> <b>supernatural</b> focus to an emotional one.|$|E
5|$|Chryssides {{states that}} Raëlism is {{discernible}} from other UFO religions for its heavy support for physicalism and repudiation of supernaturalism. Susan J. Palmer, a social scholar {{who had long}} contacts with Raëlians, associated epiphenomenalism with the belief in Raëlism that mind transfer coupled with human cloning can implant mind and personality into a new and disease free body. Raëlians publicly deny {{the existence of the}} ethereal soul and <b>a</b> <b>supernatural</b> god, but they believe that humanity for many generations past will be resurrected, albeit in a scientific way.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} 1990s, screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio {{began to think}} of <b>a</b> <b>supernatural</b> spin on the pirate genre. Walt Disney Pictures had Jay Wolpert write a script based on the ride in 2001, which was based on a story created by the {{executives}} Brigham Taylor, Michael Haynes, and Josh Harmon. This story featured Will Turner as a prison guard who releases Sparrow to rescue Elizabeth, who is being held for ransom money by Captain Blackheart.|$|E
5|$|Human {{cultures}} have developed many {{views of the}} planet. Earth is sometimes personified as a deity. In many cultures it is a mother goddess that is also the primary fertility deity, and by the mid-20th century, the Gaia Principle compared Earth's environments and life as a single self-regulating organism leading to broad stabilization of the conditions of habitability. Creation myths in many religions involve the creation of Earth by <b>a</b> <b>supernatural</b> deity or deities.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, Dunst co-starred in {{the fantasy}} {{adventure}} film Jumanji, {{loosely based on}} Chris Van Allsburg's 1981 book of the same name. The story is about <b>a</b> <b>supernatural</b> and ominous board game which makes animals and other jungle hazards appear upon each roll of the dice. She {{was part of an}} ensemble cast that included Robin Williams, Bonnie Hunt and David Alan Grier. The movie grossed $262million worldwide. That year, and again in 2002, she was named one of People magazine's 50 Most Beautiful People.|$|E

5|$|Jeffrey Tayor of Stagescreen Productions had {{the idea}} of a modern version of Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde in the mid-1990s. He {{attempted}} to get it produced in the United States three times, but all three attempts fell through for various reasons. He returned to England from the west coast of the United States and joined with Hartswood Films when Elaine Cameron was scouting for ideas for <b>a</b> <b>supernatural</b> thriller. Cameron then approached Steven Moffat for a script, and a six-part series was commissioned by the BBC's Jane Tranter and John Yorke in November 2005.|$|E
5|$|She {{began her}} acting career in 1990, when she starred in {{an episode of}} True Colors. She then {{appeared}} in a television pilot for <b>a</b> <b>supernatural</b> drama titled Moe's World that was never aired. She received guest roles in television shows such as Doogie Howser, M.D. (1991) and 21 Jump Street (1991). She earned a role on comedian Bill Cosby's NBC television sitcom A Different World in 1991, as college freshman Lena James.|$|E
5|$|The Motmot Capstone is an inscribed {{stone that}} was placed over a tomb under Structure 10L-26. Its face was finely sculpted with {{portraits of the}} first two kings of the Copán dynasty, K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' and K'inich Popol Hol, facing towards each other with a double column of hieroglyphs between them, all {{contained}} within a quatrefoil frame. The frame and the hieroglyphic names of mythological locations underneath the feet of the two kings place them in <b>a</b> <b>supernatural</b> realm. The capstone bears two calendrical dates, in AD435 and AD441. The second of these is probably the date that the capstone was dedicated.|$|E

5|$|The bluebuck rock {{paintings}} from the Caledon river valley {{have been attributed}} to Bushmen. They show six antelopes facing a man, and were supposedly inspired by shamanic trance; they may depict a Bushman visiting the spirit-world through a tunnel. The Bushmen possibly believed that the bluebuck had <b>a</b> <b>supernatural</b> potency, like other animals in their environment. The animals in the paintings are similar in proportion to the reedbuck, but the large ears, horns, and lack of a mane rule out species other than the bluebuck.|$|E
5|$|The {{cinematography}} by William Lubtchansky furthers Rivette's {{interest in}} visual textures. The film's colour palette is largely natural, except for certain scenes—like the initial dream sequence—that are filmed in vivid colours. In {{the scene where}} Marie is arranging the attic room, the light changes—from shadow to warm light—just as she places an oil lamp on a stool to indicate that she has placed it correctly; this introduces <b>a</b> <b>supernatural</b> element that contrasts with the realism {{of the rest of}} the film.|$|E
5|$|The series {{tells the}} story of the {{citizens}} of Kurōzu-cho, a fictional city which is plagued by <b>a</b> <b>supernatural</b> curse involving spirals. The story for Uzumaki originated when Ito attempted to write a story about people living in a very long terraced house, and he was inspired to use a spiral shape to achieve the desired length. Ito believes the horror of Uzumaki is effective due to its subversion of symbols which are normally positively portrayed in Japanese media, and its theme of protagonists struggling against a mysterious force stronger than themselves.|$|E

5|$|Antichrist Superstar is a rock opera concept album, and {{its title}} {{is based on}} the 1971 Andrew Lloyd Webber musical Jesus Christ Superstar. It is {{primarily}} an industrial metal record, and contains material which has been described as industrial rock and death metal, as well as progressive metal, new wave and gothic rock. The album's central storyline revolves around <b>a</b> <b>supernatural</b> being who seizes power in order to initiate an apocalyptic end event. The record is a social critique which utilizes this premise {{as a metaphor for the}} fascist elements of the Christian right in North America. The band's frontman has said that the underlying concept of Antichrist Superstar was both inspired by and a tribute to the work of German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, specifically his philosophical concept of an Übermensch.|$|E
5|$|Christian apologist and philosopher Alvin Plantinga, a {{supporter}} of intelligent design, has formalized and revised the improbability argument as the evolutionary argument against naturalism, which asserts that it is irrational to reject <b>a</b> <b>supernatural,</b> intelligent creator because the apparent probability of certain faculties evolving is so low. Specifically, Plantinga claims that evolution cannot account for the rise of reliable reasoning faculties. Plantinga argues that whereas a God {{would be expected to}} create beings with reliable reasoning faculties, evolution would be just as likely to lead to unreliable ones, meaning that if evolution is true, it is irrational to trust whatever reasoning one relies on to conclude that it is true. This novel epistemological argument has been criticized similarly to other probabilistic design arguments. It has also been argued that rationality, if conducive to survival, {{is more likely to be}} selected for than irrationality, making the natural development of reliable cognitive faculties more likely than unreliable ones.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{previous}} film's financial success, Boogeyman 2 was announced in October 2006. Production of the film began in the same month with the hiring of Betancourt as director and Sieve attached as writer. Casting began in December {{of the same year}} with the hiring of O'Connor; Savre got the lead role in January 2007. Filming took place in Los Angeles at the former hospital, Linda Vista Community Hospital, over a four-month period, beginning in January 2007 and concluding in April. Unlike the original film, which featured the Boogeyman as <b>a</b> <b>supernatural</b> entity, Betancourt strove to present a more grounded and realistic version of the mythical creature. Additionally, emphasis was placed on the writing and atmosphere to compensate for the film's small $4.5 million budget.|$|E
