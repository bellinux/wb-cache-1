30|$|During 1980 to 1995, declining habitat suitability, in {{conjunction}} with mountain lion predation (Holl and Bleich 2009), reduced the abundance of bighorn sheep and resulted in an effective population size of 63; hence, Ne approached 50, the minimum suggested for large mammals by Franklin (1980). The recurring troughs in HSF and very low Ne associated with the declining HSF suggest that ≥ 1 population bottleneck has occurred during the last 100 years, and could have reduced genetic diversity in this isolated population. Rather than considering the responses of bighorn sheep to singular fires, our examination of the fire regime indicated a relationship between wildfire history and size, and the abundance of bighorn sheep. Additional factors, including increased rates of predation, likely {{played a role in}} the decline of bighorn sheep during 1980 to 1995, but those effects probably occurred secondarily and resulted from changes in vegetation density and forage quality, both of which were concomitant with vegetative succession (Holl et al. 2004, Holl and Bleich 2009), and are examples of cascading ecological effects associated with altered fire regimes (Landres et <b>al.</b> 1999, <b>Dale</b> et <b>al.</b> 2000).

In brief, this process involved the following: motion correction and averaging of two volumetric T 1 -weighted images (Reuter et al. 2010), removal of non-brain tissue (Segonne et al. 2004), alignment of scans to the standard Talairach space, segmentation of the deep grey matter volumetric structures (Fischl et al. 2002, 2004 a), intensity normalization (Sled et al. 1998), tessellation of the grey matter/white matter boundary, topology correction (Fischl et al. 2001; Segonne et al. 2007) and surface deformation to optimally place the grey/white and grey/cerebrospinal fluid borders (<b>Dale</b> et <b>al.</b> 1999; <b>Dale</b> and Sereno 1993; Fischl and Dale 2000). The subsequent cortical representations underwent surface inflation (Fischl et al. 1999 a), registration to a spherical atlas to align individual cortical folding patterns with group cortical geometry (Fischl et al. 1999 b), parcellation of the cerebral cortex into gyral and sulcal structures (Desikan et al. 2006; Fischl et al. 2004 b) and creation of cortical thickness statistical maps, calculated as the closest distance from the grey/white boundary to the grey/CSF boundary at each vertex on the tessellated surface (Fischl and Dale 2000).

He {{did not have any}} paralyses or other neurological symptoms, and his IQ was above average. The long-term clinical outcome in patients with ADEM is usually favorable. Most children show complete, although slow, recovery over a period of 1 – 6  months. According to previous reports, about 57 – 89  % of cases show full recovery with few residual deficits (Hynson et al. 2001; Menge et al. 2005; Nasr et al. 2000; Lotze and Chadwick 2011; Tenembaum et al. 2007). However, there are also reports of cases not showing full recovery and manifesting residual symptoms. Such patients could show severe symptoms, such as hemiparesis, partial seizures, reduction of visual acuity, paraparesis, urinary retention, neuropathic bladder, dysphasia, behavioral problems or mental handicap (Murthy et <b>al.</b> 2002; <b>Dale</b> et <b>al.</b> 2000; Tenembaum et al. 2002). Moreover, subtle neurocognitive deficits in attention, executive function, behavioral changes and psychiatric disturbances and speech disturbance have been demonstrated, even after 3  years, in some children who were thought to have recovered fully (Suppiej et al. 2014; Tenembaum et al. 2007; Hynson et al. 2001; Hahn et al. 2003). Onset of illness after 6  years of age has also been shown to be associated with decreased Intelligence Quotient scores in verbal processing (Jacobs et al. 2004). In our patient reported here, the findings of high signal intensity lesions on the T 2 -weighted and FLAIR images on head MRI remained unchanged even after the patient recovered from the clinical symptoms.

30|$|PA {{could help}} to remove or reduce {{barriers}} to smoking cessation and {{factors associated with}} relapse, such as withdrawal, negative affect and low self-efficacy (Abrantes et al. 2009; Horn et al. 2013). Studies have suggested that PA can help to reduce cravings during cessation, and those who exercised reported higher continuous abstinence {{compared to those who}} were not active (Haasova et al. 2013; Taylor et al. 2007). PA could also reinforce a healthier lifestyle which does not include smoking, and this might help to enhance cessation self-efficacy (Prochaska et al. 2008). Success in achieving PA goals can also increase self-efficacy in achieving other goals, such as smoking cessation (Abrantes et al. 2009; Horn et al. 2013). While {{a number of studies have}} used PA to improve smoking cessation results, most of these studies used exercise prescription methods (Harper et al. 2012; Horn et <b>al.</b> 2013). <b>Dale</b> et <b>al.</b> (2009) who prescribed PA to participants found that 70 % of the participants did not maintain their PA after the prescription was removed. Many of the participants explained that they did not continue with the exercise because the supervision was removed (<b>Dale</b> et <b>al.</b> 2009). Stuntz and Weiss (2010) explained that it is important for participants to feel that they make their own decisions and personal choices in order to predict long-term PA participation. In a more recent study, Taylor et al. (2014) explored the efficacy of using a client-centered intervention, Exercise Assisted Reduction then Stop (EARS) in which participants set their own level of engagement in PA after having a face-to-face interview with the facilitators. Results from this study have shown that engagement in PA reduced to baseline after intervention has ended. However, Taylor et al. (2014) explained that this could be due to the high level of baseline PA of the participants. Participants who participated in this study were also given subsidized access to PA opportunities, which could explain why participants’ level of PA reduced to baseline after this access was removed at the end of the intervention.|$|R

A tutorial is presented {{on the use}} of this model for the analysis of longitudinal data, i. e., repeated ata on the same subjects. An important advantage of this approach is that differences across subjects in the numbers and spacings of measurement occasions do not present a problem, and that changing covariates can easily be handled. The tutorial approaches the longitudinal data as measurements on populations of (subject-specific) functions. Key words. Multilevel analysis, hierarchical linear model, random coefficients. 1. When and why use the hierarchical inear model for analyzing longitudinal data? A large variety of statistical methods exists for the analysis of longitudinal data. This paper is a tutorial that explains the use of the hierarchical linear model, also referred to as the multilevel model, for analysing longitudinal data. The hierarchical linear model is a random coefficient model with nested random coefficients. As an example a data set is used which was collected by Ormel and coworkers (1991), in a study of the relationship of neuroticism with aging. In this introductory section, the place of random coefficient models as compared to other models is indicated, without presenting an overview of other models. Such overviews may be found, e. g., in Lindsey (1993), Diggle et <b>al.</b> (1994), <b>Dale</b> and Davies (1994). The type of data under consideration is data about a sample of individuals, for each of whom values on an array of variables are recorded at several points in time. For the individuals I think primarily of persons, but one could also think of other units such as companies, municipalities, countries, etc. Instead of time there might be a different ordering principle. E. g., the measurements might refer to individuals under each of several experimental conditions. Depending on the research question, the time dimension can be age, but also calendar year and date, time elapsed since the onset o...|$|R
40|$|A bondingness term {{is further}} {{developed}} {{to aid in}} heat of formation (ΔfHº) calculations for C, N, O and S containing molecules. Bondingness originated from qualitative investigations into the antibonding effect in the occupied MOs of ethane. Previous work used a single parameter for bondingness to calculate ΔfHº in an alkane homologous series using an additivity scheme. This work modifies the bondingness algorithm and uses the term to parameterise a test group of 345 molecules consisting of 17 subgroups that include alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, alcohols, ethers, aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, esters, amines, amides, diazenes, nitriles, nitroalkanes, nitrates, thiols and benzenoids. Comparing experimental with calculated ΔfHº values, a standard deviation for the residuals of 6. 3 kJ mol 1 can be achieved using bondingness with a simple steric repulsion term (SSR) in a bond additivity scheme, and {{a standard deviation of}} 5. 2 kJ mol 1 can be achieved using a Lennard-Jones potential. The method is compared with the group method of Pedley, which for a slightly smaller set of 338 molecules, a subset of the test set of 345 molecules, gives a standard deviation of 7. 0 kJ mol 1. Bondingness, along with SSR or a Lennard-Jones potential, is parameterised in the lowest level of ab initio (HF-SCF) or semiempirical quantum chemical calculations. It therefore may be useful in determining the ΔfHº values for the largest molecules that are amenable to quantum chemical calculation. As part of our analysis we calculated the difference between the lowest energy conformer and the average energy of a mixture populated with higher energy conformers. This is the difference between the experimental ΔfHº value and the ΔfHº calculated for a single conformer. Example calculations which we have followed are given by Dale and Eliel et <b>al</b> [...] <b>Dale</b> calculates the energy difference for molecules as large as hexane using relative energies {{based on the number of}} 1, 4 gauche interactions.

40|$|The {{salt marsh}} mosquito, Aedes vigilax (Skuse), {{is a major}} vector of polyarthritic {{diseases}} such as Ross River and Barmah Forest virus. These are not fatal but are debilitating (MacKenzie et al. 1998, Russell 2002)). Ross River virus (RRV) has been the major arbovirus in Australia over recent decades with up to 8000 cases each year. Between 1993 and 2007 there were 62815 notifications of RRV in Australia and 52 % (32789) of these occurred in Queensland (data from the Commonwealth Department of Health and Ageing). The disease exacts a social and economic cost to society that has been estimated to be $AUD 1, 000 - 2, 500 per person (Boughton 1994, Harley et al. 2001, Ratnayake 2006). Runnelling is a minor form of Open Marsh Water Management {{that can be used}} to manage larval populations. It was implemented at Coomera Island in Queensland in 1985 and has been described in (Hulsman et al. 1989). Runnels are shallow (less than 0. 30 m deep and 0. 90 m wide (three times as wide as deep) spoon-shaped channels that connect isolated salt marsh pools to the tidal source. This increases connectivity and tidal flushing increasing predator access and flushing larvae from the marsh. In the broad area of salt marsh management for mosquito control (Dale and Hulsman 1990) reviewed a suite of habitat modification methods, concluding that runnelling had the least impact, a view supported by later research comparing its impacts with those of other water management methods (Dale and Knight 2006). As with all forms of mosquito control it is necessary to assess impacts on non-target aspects of the environment. (Latchford 1997) assessed short term impacts in Western Australia, and found minor effects. There have been several assessments of the impact of runnelling at the reference site at Coomera Island in south east Queensland. These have covered relatively short term impacts (Breitfuss 2003, Dale and Dale. 2002, <b>Dale</b> et <b>al.</b> 1993, <b>Dale</b> 1988) and have used novel approaches such as detecting change using remote sensing (<b>Dale</b> et <b>al.</b> 1996), assessing impacts on process rather than the state of variables (Dale and Dale 2002) and have considered detailed impacts such as on oviposition (<b>Dale</b> et <b>al.</b> 2002), crabs (Breitfuss et al. 2004, Chapman et al. 2004). The most recent research focussed on field variables monitored at the Coomera site (Dale 2008). The general conclusion has been that there were no significant effects of runnelling on marsh function in modified marshes. The aim here is to outline the changes over time that occurred since runnelling was implemented in 1985 and until the end of 2005. It will also illustrate the results of some related research demonstrating an interdisciplinary approach to maximise the overall scope of the monitoring.

He has a sister named Nataly and a niece and nephew named Enrique and Maria Camilla. Most of his childhood was spent traveling in different countries, and as such, he speaks five languages fluently: Spanish, German, English, French, and Italian.Ramirez graduated in 1999 from the Andrés Bello Catholic University {{with a degree in}} mass communication, minoring in audiovisual communications, although he intended to pursue international relations. While in college he worked as an emerging journalist, reporting on politics. Later, he became executive director of <b>Dale</b> <b>al</b> Voto, a Venezuelan foundation similar to Rock the Vote. He and his team created campaigns for radio, television and movie theaters. However, he was always attracted to the performing arts and while in college was involved with the arts. Ramirez was in charge of international promotions of the Viart Film Festival. Screenwriter Guillermo [...] "Memo" [...] Arriaga —then a professor in Mexico— was invited to the school's short film festival as part of the jury, that's when he saw Ramirez work in the short film he offered him an audition in the film Amores Perros. Guillermo said to Ramírez, “I didn’t know you were an actor!” and I told him, “I didn’t know either!” Laughs I’d be lying if I told you I dreamed about becoming an actor as a kid. But I wasn’t indifferent to the world of performing arts. I was always very attracted to it. I just never thought about it as a career". Ramirez passed it up, as he {{was in the middle of}} his thesis and was to attend Harvard National Model UN that year as a delegate from his school. Three years later Arriaga returned to Venezuela from the Cannes Film festival in France, where the film had won the Prize of the Critic's Week. The film went on to also be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Ramirez then decided to pursue his acting interests.|$|R
40|$|Excerpt] Part {{of a wider}} {{research}} project, {{funded by}} the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology, which analyses practices, voices and pathways of inclusive education, this paper discusses the factors behind the construction of inclusive educational practices, and the factors that interrupt the failure-dropout cycle and favour the educational remobilization of young people. Additionally, and considering a set of socio-educational practices developed {{in the framework of}} two nation-wide intervention programmes, this paper will look into the innovative dimension and the local dimension of such practices. This paper is based on a multi-case study intended to contribute significantly to the analysis of the intervention on school failure and dropout, by mapping the points of view of the institutional actors engaged in a panel of inclusive educational practices, developed in eleven different empirical contexts. These actors participate in the identification and characterization of locally-based, successful socio-educational practices to overcome school failure and dropout (henceforth designated as “inclusive practices”), contributing {{to the understanding of the}} processes, factors, rationales and partnerships which support them. This paper will address two main research questions: 1) what new approaches are identifiable in these inclusive practices, in terms of resource management, partners, audiences, formats of participation, strategies for measuring success and dissemination networks; and 2) what is the local community’s role in developing, implementing and assessing these inclusive practices. Since the 1980 s, Portugal has been the stage of a series of policies, programmes and practices which have been developed with the purpose of overcoming school failure and dropout, which have, in turn, been studied and evaluated. These assessments have highlighted a contextual and diverse appropriation and reconstruction of said policies; the teachers' perspectives about students; and the multiple rationales underlying their conception and implementation (Canário, Alves & Rolo, 2001). Recently, an external evaluation highlighted how one of the above mentioned programmes contributed to reducing dropout and grade retention in participating schools, even though subsequent data raises some uncertainty regarding the latter aspect (Figueiredo et al, 2013). Based on partially coincident data, another researcher argued in favour of the positive effects of said programme in reducing dropout rates, detecting a more modest effect on student's academic outcomes, assessed through their results on national exams (Dias, 2013). One other study raises equally relevant questions about the scope of the results of such educational policies (Neves, Ferraz & Nata, 2016). However, in an international and European perspective, the factors influencing school failure and dropout are well known as processes beginning, in some cases, even before school entry, resulting from the interaction between individual, institutional, contextual, family-related and school-related causes and processes. School alienation is frequently used as a generic concept that, in a way, leaves out much of the complexity of these processes (Ferguson et <b>al,</b> 2005; <b>Dale,</b> 2010; Costa et al, 2013). There is research about the policies, programmes and practices aimed at these socio-educational problems (Frandji et al, 2009; Ross, 2009; Dale, 2010; Rochex, 2011; Raffo, Dyson & Keer, 2014) and there is knowledge about successful practices in preventing and/or overcoming school failure and dropout (UB/CREA & UM/UEA, 2006; Ross, 2009; Edwards & Downes, 2013; Barros & Barrientos-Rastrojo, 2014). Nonetheless, fairly little is known about: a) how the local dimension influences the processes, factors, rationales and (institutional, local, community) partnerships, and contributes to the construction of successful inclusive practices; b) which socio-educational relationships are most and less challenged by these practices aimed to overcome school failure and dropout (Moulaert et al, 2013).

3000|$|Bacterial {{adhesion}} and biofilm formation {{have become}} a serious problem in healthcare and food sectors, and much investigations have been done for {{better understanding of the}} processes involved. However, most of studies have focused on the bacterial adhesion of planktonic cells but have not considered the biofilm-detached cells which may be involved in contamination spread. It has been reported that the physiology of planktonic and biofilm-detached cells are deeply different (Stewart and Costerton 2001; Donlan and Costerton 2002). In this context, our study investigated, in particular, the impact of growth conditions on the physicochemical properties of biofilm-detached and planktonic S. aureus cells and on their ability to adhere to the SS and PC. Overall, our results showed that the increase of temperature and the incubation duration slightly increased the adhesion of S. aureus to the SS and the PC. These results are in agreement with previous studies which highlighted the effect of these parameters on the adhesion of S. aureus (Abdallah et al. 2014 b), Listeria monocytogenes (Gordesli and Abu-Lail 2012) and Escherichia coli (Tsuji and Yokoigawa 2012) to different surfaces. Furthermore, our results showed that biofilm-detached cells had a higher adhesion rate than that of their planktonic counterparts. The same trend was reported by Berlanga et al. (2015), who underlined the greater ability of biofilm-detached Halomonas venusta cells to colonize new surfaces compared to their planktonic counterparts. By contrast, other studies (Allison et al. 1990), reported that {{there were no significant differences}} between the adhesion of biofilm-detached and planktonic E. coli cells to abiotic surfaces. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of growth conditions on the surface physicochemical properties of S. aureus cells. Overall, we showed that the hydrophobicity of biofilm-detached and planktonic S. aureus cells increased when the growth temperature increased from 20 to 37  °C. These findings seem to be consistent with those of Abdallah et al. (2014 a), who found that the hydrophobicity of S. aureus increased with the increase of the growth temperatures. Therefore, this result may explain the increase of S. aureus adhesion onto SS and PC. However, and if we consider, particularly, the results related to the bacterial surface hydrophobicity we could suggest that cell adhesion should be greater on hydrophobic supports such as the PC which is not the case under our experimental conditions. In accordance with a previous study (Abdallah et al. 2014 a), our results showed a greater adhesion rate of S. aureus cells on SS than on the PC. Such results highlight that the hydrophobic interactions cannot always explain the bacterial adhesion onto abiotic surfaces. It has been reported that the acid–base interactions are the main forces governing the bacterial adhesion to abiotic surfaces (Bos et al. 1999). Our study highlighted the decrease of the electron donor character of 48  h-biofilm-detached cells with the increase of growth temperature. This may result in a decrease of repulsive acid–base interactions between the cells and the abiotic surfaces. Such decrease may, therefore, explain the increase of the bacterial adhesion of 48  h-biofilm-detached cells on the SS. By contrast, our results also showed that the electron donor characters of S. aureus did not always explain the differences found in the experimental results. In fact, the increase of electron donor character of 24  h-biofilm-detached-cells, with the increase of growth temperature from 20 to 37  °C, was accompanied by an increase of the bacterial adhesion on both surfaces. Furthermore, we investigated the involvement of electrostatic interactions in the S. aureus adhesion to the SS and the PC. Our results showed that the ZP of S. aureus cells was negative whatever the studied conditions. Our findings also showed that biofilm-detached cells are less negatively charged than their planktonic counterparts, probably due to the up-regulation of cationic staphylococcal poly-N-acetylglucosamine surface polysaccharide (Otto 2008). Therefore, the low relative negative charge of biofilm-detached cells may result in a decrease of repulsive electrostatic forces between cells and negatively charged abiotic surfaces, which may explain their greater adhesion rates on abiotic surfaces as compared to that of their planktonic counterparts. Furthermore, our results showed that the increase of the growth temperature may result in a decrease of repulsive electrostatic interactions, between negatively-charged bacterial cells and abiotic surfaces. Therefore, this may explain the enhanced adhesion of the biofilm-detached S. aureus cells onto the SS. By contrast, our data showed that the increase of the growth temperature resulted in a decrease of the zeta potential of the biofilm-detached cells and simultaneously in an increase of the bacterial adhesion to the PC. Hence, we suggest that the electrostatic interactions may not always explain the bacterial adhesion to abiotic surfaces which involves other factors related to the cell envelope in this process (Hori and Matsumoto 2010). This work also investigated the effect of the growth conditions on the pathogenicity and cytotoxicity of the different studied S. aureus cultures. The DNase activity of biofilm cultures was greater than that of the planktonic cultures. In addition, the results showed that the DNase activity increased with the increase of the growth temperature and the incubation duration. These results are in disagreement with other studies (Resch et al. 2005; Wang et al. 2011), which underlined that the virulence factor production by planktonic S. aureus was greater compared to that of biofilm cultures. However, our results seem in line with those of Coenye et al. (2007), who stated that the sessile Propionibacterium acnes cells produced more virulence factors than the planktonic ones and this production increased with the increase of the incubation time. The present findings also appear to be in agreement with those of Mahoney et al. (2010), who underlined that the bacterial virulence regulation is influenced by the growth temperature. Furthermore, our findings showed that BCSs had a higher cytotoxic effect, on HeLa cells, than the PCSs whatever the studied condition. The cytotoxic effect of BCSs and PCSs increased in response to the increase of the temperature and the incubation duration. Taken together, our results may explain the influence of growth conditions on the bacterial metabolism controlling the production of virulence factors (Holler et al. 1998). According to Secor et al. (2011), the different metabolic states in planktonic and biofilm cultures likely have a large impact on the pathogenic effects on human cells. Thus, in our case, the important cytotoxic effect of S. aureus BCSs compared to that of PCSs could be related to the presence of higher amounts of virulence factors including exoenzymes such as DNase, which may disturb the biological activity of human cells (Modun and Williams 1999; Pancholi and Chhatwal 2003; Jarosław et al. 2005; Secor et al. 2011). Nevertheless, our results showed that BCSs recovered from biofilms grown on the PC surface were more cytotoxic to HeLa cells than those of biofilm grown on SS. Interestingly, our investigation showed that the siderophore production, which is enhanced under iron-limiting conditions (Vasil and Ochsner 1999; Gaonkar 2015), in the supernatant of biofilm grown on PC were higher than that of biofilm grown on SS. It has been reported that iron and nickel could be released from the SS into solution (Ortiz et al. 2011). Therefore, the limited availability of iron in the medium of biofilm grown on the PC, which is a plastic surface, could enhance the production of siderophores (Gaonkar 2015). In S. aureus, the greater production of siderophores correlated with higher virulence and more resistant (Rozalska et <b>al.</b> 1998; <b>Dale</b> et <b>al.</b> 2004). Taken together, our findings and previous studies may explain the greater cytotoxicity and pathogenicity of supernatants recovered from S.|$|R
