It made our hearts glad to hear that was your wish... but now, father, we see you drawing back, and we are sorry to see our father doing so without seeing the enemy. We must compare our father's conduct to a fat animal, that carries its tail upon its back, but when affrighted, it drops it between its legs and runs off.|$|E
25|$|My mother <b>always</b> <b>told</b> me that {{no matter}} how much you dislike a person, when you meet them face to face you will find {{characteristics}} about them that you like. Jerry Falwell was a perfect example of that. I hated everything he stood for, but after meeting him in person, years after the trial, Jerry Falwell and I became good friends. He would visit me in California and we would debate together on college campuses. I always appreciated his sincerity even though I knew what he was selling and he knew what I was selling.|$|E
25|$|The {{setting of}} Lullaby is {{constantly}} changing. In both {{the present tense}} narration and the story he is reflecting on, Streator is constantly moving in pursuit of something. He works {{in a big city}} atmosphere and lives in an apartment surrounded by other tenants who become symbolic of everything Streator hates. Soon after he meets Helen, they start their cross-country mission. Most of the towns they end up in are small, nowhere places that seem to represent the emptiness that the culling song creates in people lives. Similarly, the trucker stops that Streator and Helen drive through in their present-day adventure are representative of how the stories that they are chasing are temporary. The idea that a story is <b>always</b> <b>told</b> ‘after the fact’ seems to hint at a bigger picture: humans are a victim of their past.|$|E

25|$|Wason, {{like his}} brother Cathcart, was well over 6 feet tall. He was {{described}} {{by one of the}} contemporary Speakers of the House of Commons as ‘the largest and tallest man in the House.’ Sir Percy Harris who was Liberal MP for Bethnal Green South West and whose father was a close friend of Wason’s has recorded that Eugene and Cathcart were giants, Eugene being thick set and heavy while Cathcart was willowy and thin. Harris related that the story <b>always</b> <b>told</b> about Eugene was that if he stepped on a weighing machine the hands would go on until they could no farther as he topped the maximum 20 stone mark on the dial. Not surprisingly, according to Harris, Eugene was fond of his food and wine,) although he was also a keen sportsman listing his recreations in Who’s Who in his younger days as football, shooting, rowing, and fishing although in later life these pursuits turned into reading, bridge, backgammon, and the card game picquet.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} half of 1941, Germany which was intent upon invading the Soviet Union went {{out of its way to}} improve {{relations}} with Turkey as the Reich hoped for a benevolent Turkish neutrality when the German-Soviet war began. At the same time, the British had great hopes in the spring of 1941 when they dispatched an expeditionary force to Greece that İnönü could be persuaded to enter the war on the Allied side as the British leadership had high hopes of creating a Balkan front that would tie down German forces, and which thus led a major British diplomatic offensive with the Foreign Secretary Sir Anthony Eden visiting Ankara several times to meet with İnönü. İnönü <b>always</b> <b>told</b> Eden that the Turks would not join the British forces in Greece, and the Turks would only enter the war if Germany attacked Turkey. For his part, Papen offered İnönü parts of Greece if Turkey were to enter the war on the Axis side, an offer İnönü declined. In May 1941 when the Germans dispatched an expeditionary force to Iraq to fight against the British, İnönü refused Papen's request that the German forces be allowed transit rights to Iraq.|$|E

A talented runner, he ran with power {{both inside and outside}} the tackles, and he was as fast as McElhenny and Perry. Jim Brown called Johnson the greatest running back he had ever seen. He was also a very skilled safety and linebacker on defense. During a preseason game in 1955, Johnson hit Chicago Cardinals halfback Charley Trippi so hard that he fractured Trippi's face in multiple places, leaving him with a smashed nose and concussion and all but ended his career. [...] "Football was like a combat zone," [...] said Johnson. [...] "I was <b>always</b> <b>told</b> that you carry the impact to the opponent. If you wait for it, the impact will be on you." ...|$|E

500|$|In The Sun Also Rises, Hemingway {{contrasts}} Paris with Pamplona, and {{the frenzy}} of the fiesta with the tranquillity of the Spanish countryside.

[...] He was profoundly affected by the spectacle of bullfighting, writing, It isn't just brutal like they <b>always</b> <b>told</b> us. It's a great tragedy—and {{the most beautiful thing}} I've ever seen and takes more guts and skill and guts again than anything possibly could. It's just like having a ringside seat at the war with nothing going to happen to you. He demonstrated what he considered the purity in the culture of bullfighting—called afición—and presented it as an authentic way of life, contrasted against the inauthenticity of the Parisian bohemians.

Smith argued that he was forced down below the yellow line: [...] "I was <b>always</b> <b>told</b> that the rule is if you get forced down there, then you are {{the winner of the}} race, and on the last lap, anything goes. That’s what I was going with. I had a nose inside of him and I could have piled up the whole field."

[...] An Andrew Johnson goal on the verge of half time helped Everton to a 1–0 win at the Stadium of Light on 8 March. Sunderland lost consecutive games when Chelsea beat them 1–0 on 15 March due to a Didier Drogba goal. Andy Reid came close to putting Sunderland in front as his free kick was plucked from the top corner by Carlo Cudicini. Sunderland's first away win of the season came on 22 March when they won 1–0 at Villa Park against Aston Villa. An 83rd minute Michael Chopra scored the winning goal for Sunderland. A 2–1 win at home to West Ham United on 29 February helped Sunderland to their first consecutive wins of the season.

500|$|Seungsahn also {{developed}} his own kōan study program {{for students of}} the Kwan Um School, known today as the [...] "Twelve Gates". These twelve kōans are a mixture of ancient cases and cases which he developed. Before receiving inka to teach (in Kwan Um, inka is not synonymous with Dharma transmission), students must complete the Twelve Gates, though often they will complete hundreds more. One of the more well known cases of the Twelve Gates is [...] "Dropping Ashes on the Buddha", the Sixth Gate, {{which is also the}} title of one of his books. In the book The Compass of Zen, this kong-an is transcribed as follows: [...] "Somebody comes to the Zen center smoking a cigarette. He blows smoke and drops ashes on the Buddha." [...] Seungsahn then poses the question, [...] "If you are standing there at that time, what can you do?" [...] Not included in this version of the kōan is the Kwan Um School of Zen's following side note on the case, [...] "ere {{is an important factor in}} this case that has apparently never been explicitly included in its print versions.

500|$|A quiet, social bird, the huia was monogamous, and pairs {{probably}} paired for life. The {{bird was}} usually found in breeding pairs, although sometimes {{groups of four}} or more were encountered.

There are records of this same pair and a further, wild pair [...] "hopping from branch to branch and fanning their tails, then meeting to caress each other with their bills" [...] and uttering these noises. The male {{is said to have}} fed the female in courtship. It is thought that these behaviours may have been a sexual display. The claim that the male fed the female while she was incubating and on the nest [...] "lacks evidence". When the male of this captive pair was accidentally killed, the female [...] "manifesting the utmost distress pined for her mate and died 10 days afterwards". A Māori man in the 19th century recalled: [...] "I was <b>always</b> <b>told</b> by my old people that a pair of huia lived on most affectionate terms... If the male died first, the female died soon after of grief". The huia had no fear of people; females allowed themselves to be handled on the nest, and birds could easily be captured by hand.|$|E
