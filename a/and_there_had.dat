5|$|By 1797, Britain {{and the new}} French Republic {{had been}} engaged in the French Revolutionary Wars for nearly four years. Although there had been {{significant}} fighting in Europe, the East Indies had remained largely under British control. French forces in the region were limited, and apart from a few raiding cruises the French squadron in the region had been under intermittent blockade at Île de France. The Royal Navy, commanded in Eastern waters by Rear-Admiral Peter Rainier had focused on commerce protection {{and the elimination of}} the colonies of the French-allied Batavian Republic, capturing Dutch Ceylon, the Dutch Cape Colony and parts of the Dutch East Indies in 1795 and 1796. Rainier had been engaged in pacifying local uprisings around Malacca during {{the latter part of the}} campaign, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> been few forces left in reserve to protect British interests in the Indian Ocean.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} the amphitheatre was completed, Titus's short reign had already endured a series of disasters: two months after he had succeeded Vespasian, Mount Vesuvius had erupted, {{destroying}} Pompeii, Herculaneum, Stabiae, and Oplontis; a fire had burned {{in the city of}} Rome for three days and three nights causing substantial damage and destroying the Temple of Jupiter that had recently been restored by Vespasian; <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> been an outbreak of plague which was said to be the worst the city had ever endured. To dedicate the amphitheatre and the baths, and probably in an attempt to mollify both the Roman public and the gods, Titus inaugurated the opening of the Colosseum with lavish games which lasted for more than a hundred days.|$|E
5|$|Piłsudski's PPS, {{while not}} {{planning}} for a major uprising then <b>and</b> <b>there,</b> <b>had</b> a policy of supporting the protest and harassing Russian forces. The PPS, {{as well as other}} socialist organizations, such as Jewish Bund and SDKPiL, were as surprised by the scale of the spontaneous revolt as the Russian authorities; PPS forces in Łódź consisted of 10 regular and armed PPS members and a few dozen semi-enlisted workers. A larger group sent from Warsaw under Walery Sławek never made it in time to take control or affect the uprising; it was, in the end, an anarchic and unorganized violent protest against the Russian government.|$|E
