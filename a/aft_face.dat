40|$|The {{effects of}} thrust {{reversing}} on stability, control and vertical tail loads of advanced fighter aircraft are reviewed. Several static test stand and wind tunnel investigations of nonaxisymmetric nozzles with integral thrust reversers are presented, {{and it is}} found that base drag on the <b>aft</b> <b>face</b> of reverser panels of blockers provides a significant contribution to in-flight thrust reverser performance. The location of tail surfaces relative to the thrust reverser has significant impact on control surface effectiveness, and depending on thrust reverser location, large vertical tail side force can result from the use of in-flight thrust reversers.

40|$|A {{castable}} inhibitor {{is applied}} to the <b>aft</b> <b>face</b> of the Space Shuttle Redesigned Solid Rocket Motor (RSRM) forward segment propellant grain to control propellant surface burn area. During fabrication, the propellant surface is trimmed prior to the inhibitor application. This produces a potential for small propellant chips to remain undetected on the propellant surface and contaminate the inhibitor during application. The concern was that undetected propellant chips in the inhibitor might provide a fuse path for premature propellant ignition underneath the inhibitor. To evaluate the fuse path potential, testing was performed on inhibitor samples with embedded propellant. The internal motor environment was simulated with a calibrated CO 2 laser beam directed onto a sample which was placed in a 4100 kPa (600 psi) nitrogen pressurized bomb (laser bomb). The testing showed definitive results pertaining to fuse path formation. Embedded propellant chips did not autoignite until the receding heat affected inhibitor surface reached, or passed, the propellant chip. Samples with embedded propellant chips in alignment did not propagate ignition from one chip to another with separation distances as small as 0. 010 cm(0. 004 inc) and some as little as 0. 0051 cm (0. 002 in). Propellant chips with volumes approximately less than 0. 025 cu cm (0. 0015 cu in) (which did not propagate ignition) did not increase the inhibitor material decomposition depth more than the resulting void cavity of the burned out propellant chip. In addition, the depth of this void cavity did not increase until it was overtaken by the surrounding material decomposition depth. This was due, in part, to the retention of the protective inhibitor char layer. Samples with embedded propellant strings, whose thicknesses were below 0. 023 cm (0. 009 in), did not propagate ignition. Propellant string thicknesses above 0. 038 cm (0. 015 in) did propagate ignition. Test sample char and heat affected layer measurements and observations compared well with those from the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Motor (SRM) Technical Evaluation Motor no. 9 (TEM- 9) ...|$|E
40|$|In early 2011, the ISS Vehicle Configuration Office began {{considering}} {{the relocation of}} the Permanent Multipurpose Module (PMM) to the aft facing Common Berthing Mechanism (CBM) on Node 3 to open a berthing location for visiting vehicles on the Node 1 nadir CBM. In this position, computer-aided design (CAD) models indicated that the aft end of the PMM would be {{only a few inches}} from the stowed Functional Cargo Block (FGB) port solar array. To validate the CAD model clearance analysis, in the late summer of 2011 the Image Science and Analysis Group (ISAG) was asked to determine the true geometric relationship between the on-orbit aft facing Node 3 CBM and the FGB port solar array. The desired measurements could be computed easily by photogrammetric analysis if current imagery of the ISS hardware were obtained. Beginning in the fall of 2011, ISAG used the Dynamic Onboard Ubiquitous Graphics (DOUG) program to design a way to acquire imagery of the <b>aft</b> <b>face</b> of Node 3, the aft end-cone of Node 1, the port side of pressurized mating adapter 1 (PMA 1), and the port side of the FGB out to the tip of the port solar array using cameras on the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS). This was complicated by the need to thread the SSRMS under the truss, past Node 3 and the Cupola, and into the space between the aft side of Node 3 and the FGB solar array to acquire more than 100 images from multiple positions. To minimize the number of SSRMS movements, the Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator (SPDM) would be attached to the SSRMS. This would make it possible to park the SPDM in one position and acquire multiple images by changing the viewing orientation of the SPDM body cameras using the pan/tilt units on which the cameras are mounted. Using this implementation concept, ISAG identified four SSRMS/SPDM positions from which all of the needed imagery could be acquired. Based on a photogrammetric simulation, it was estimated that the location of the FGB solar array could be measured within an accuracy of about 1 in. in each axis relative to the ISS Analysis Coordinate System (ISSACS). In October 2011, a proposed image-acquisition plan was drafted by ISAG and released for review. The ISS Robotics flight control team (ROBO) proposed minor changes to SPDM positions 1 and 4 to meet ISS proximity requirements. The updated image acquisition plan and draft chit were presented to and approved by the Systems Working Group (SWG) November 18 and were sent to the Vehicle Configuration Board (VCB) in early December 2011. Working with ROBO on 3 successive days (February 21, 22, and 23), ISAG collected 161 images of the ISS. Approximately 40 images were collected from each of the four different SSRMS/SPDM positions, with each set mapping the region from the Node 3 end cone, across Node 1, along the forward port side portion of the FGB, and out the port side FGB solar arrays. From this imagery, the best 80 images were selected for use in the analysis. The images were radiometrically enhanced to improve color and contrast and loaded into the FotoG analysis software along with the camera parameters and control data, which consisted of the coordinates for 54 handrail attachment bolts on the <b>aft</b> <b>face</b> of Node 3, in the ISSACS coordinate system. The results of this analysis produced the measured coordinates of 116 points distributed across the face of the FGB solar array panels (see figure 3) along with propagated uncertainty estimates in each coordinate axis. These results were sent to the ISS Vehicle Configuration Office, which sent them to the Configuration Analysis Modeling and Mass Properties (CAMMP) team for comparison with the Russian-provided CAD model for the retracted FGB solar arrays. The CAMMP analysis unexpectedly showed that the measured location of the port FGB solar array was up to 41 -in. further outboard than the design and was slightly twisted about its rotational axis. The unexpected comparison results produced some initial concern regarding the accuracy of the photogrammetric measurements. To verify the measured results, ISAG personnel conducted a second analysis using just the imagery of the solar arrays in an arbitrary coordinate system defined by the three corner points of the inboard-most panel, with the design distance between points A 1 and A 10 as the only scale. The new measurements agreed with the original results to within less than 1 in. RMS in each axis, confirming the original solar array measurements. ISAG produced a final report for the ISS Vehicle Configuration Office documenting an apparent anomaly in the retracted configuration of the port FGB solar arrays. A copy of the measurement report was translated and sent to the Russian Space Agency. During a Vehicle Integrated Performance and Resources (VIPeR) teleconference September 24, 2012, the Russians acknowledged receipt of a translated copy of the ISAG report. The Russian representative stated that the head of the solar array design team claimed that the measured configuration was impossible unless the structure was physically broken. The Russians acknowledged that they had no expertise in photogrammetry, so the analysis technique employed was a "black box" to them, and they {{did not know how to}} use the ISAG results. They asked for a single image in which the overextension of the port solar array could be obviously seen. On November 10, 2012, during a face-to-face meeting with their Russian counterparts at JSC, ISAG presented nadir-view imagery of the FGB acquired during Space Shuttle rendezvous. Using the known width of the pressurized portion of the FGB as a scale, this analysis clearly showed that the port FGB solar array was extended outboard further than the Russian design for the retracted solar array...|$|E

40|$|The Natural Flow Wing design {{philosophy}} {{was developed for}} improving performance characteristics of highly-swept fighter aircraft at cruise and maneuvering conditions across the Mach number range (from Subsonic through Supersonic). The basic philosophy recognizes the flow characteristics that develop on highly swept wings and contours the surface {{to take advantage of}} those flow characteristics (e. g., forward facing surfaces in low pressure regions and <b>aft</b> <b>facing</b> surfaces in higher pressure regions for low drag). Because the wing leading edge and trailing edge have multiple sweep angles and because of shocks generated on nacelles and diverters, a viscous code was required to accurately define the surface pressure distributions on the wing. A method of generating the surface geometry to take advantage of those surface pressures (as well as not violating any structural constraints) was developed and the resulting geometries were analyzed and compared to a baseline configuration.

5000|$|Doppler {{navigation}} was {{in common}} commercial aviation {{use in the}} 1960s until it was largely superseded by inertial navigation systems. The equipment consisted of a transmitter/receiver unit, a processing unit and a gyro stabilised antenna platform. The antenna generated four beams and was rotated by a servo mechanism to align with the aircraft's track by equalising the Doppler shift from {{the left and right}} hand antennas. A synchro transmitted the platform angle to the flight deck, thus providing a measure of 'drift angle'. The ground speed was determined from the Doppler shift between the forward and <b>aft</b> <b>facing</b> beams. These were displayed on the flight deck on single instrument. Some aircraft had an additional 'Doppler Computer'. This was a mechanical device containing a steel ball rotated by a motor whose speed was controlled by the Doppler determined ground speed. The angle of this motor was controlled by the 'drift angle'. Two fixed wheels, one 'fore and aft' the other 'left to right' drove counters to output distance along track and across track difference. The aircraft's compass was integrated into the computer so that a desired track could be set between two waypoints on an over water great circle route. It may seem surprising to 21st. century readers, but it actually worked rather well and was great improvement over other 'dead reckoning' methods available at the time.

It was possible to cross the Atlantic with an error of a couple of miles when in range of a couple of VORs or NDBs.It's major shortcoming in practice was the sea state, as a calm sea gave poor radar returns and hence unreliable Doppler measurements.

40|$|Space Shuttle {{solid rocket}} motor low {{frequency}} internal pressure oscillations {{have been observed}} since early testing. The same type of oscillations also {{are present in the}} redesigned solid rocket motor (RSRM). The oscillations, which occur during RSRM burn, are predominantly at the first three motor cavity longitudinal acoustic mode frequencies. Broadband flow and combustion noise provide the energy to excite these modes at low levels throughout motor burn, however, at certain times during burn the fluctuating pressure amplitude increases significantly. The increased fluctuations at these times suggests an additional excitation mechanism. The RSRM has inhibitors on the propellant forward facing surface of each motor segment. The inhibitors are in a slot at the segment field joints to prevent burning at that surface. The <b>aft</b> <b>facing</b> segment surface at a field joint slot burns and forms a cavity of time varying size. Initially the inhibitor is recessed in the field joint cavity. As propellant burns away the inhibitor begins to protrude into the bore flow. Two mechanisms (transit time models) that are considered potential pressure oscillation excitations are cavity-edge tones, and inhibitor hole-tones. Estimates of frequency variation with time of longitudinal acoustic modes, cavity edge-tones, and hole-tones compare favorably with frequencies measured during motor hot firing. It is believed that the highest oscillation amplitudes occur when vortex shedding frequencies coincide with motor longitudinal acoustic modes. A time accurate computational fluid dynamic (CFD) analysis was made to replicate the observations from motor firings and to observe the transit time mechanisms in detail. FDNS is the flow solver used to detail the time varying aspects of the flow. The fluid is approximated as a single-phase ideal gas. The CFD model was an axisymmetric representation of the RSRM at 80 seconds into burn. Deformation of the inhibitors by the internal flow was determined through an iterative structural and CFD analysis. The analysis domain ended just upstream of the nozzle throat. This is an acoustic boundary condition that caused the motor to behave as a closed-open organ pipe. This differs from the RSRM which behaves like a closed-closed organ pipe. The unsteady CFD solution shows RSRM chamber pressure oscillations predominately at the longitudinal acoustic mode frequencies of a closed-open organ pipe. Vortex shedding in the joint cavities and at the inhibitors contribute disturbances to the flow at the second longitudinal acoustic mode frequency. Further studies are planned using an analysis domain that extends downstream of the nozzle throat...|$|R

Ducks served as general/utility amphibians for photographic, target-towing, scouting and rescue work.|$|R
