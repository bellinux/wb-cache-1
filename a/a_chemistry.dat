5|$|After {{graduating from}} DePauw, Julian wanted to obtain his {{doctorate}} in chemistry, but learned {{it would be}} difficult for an African-American to do so. Instead he obtained a position as <b>a</b> <b>chemistry</b> instructor at Fisk University. In 1923 he received an Austin Fellowship in Chemistry, which allowed him to attend Harvard University to obtain his M.S. However, worried that Euro-American students would resent being taught by an African-American, Harvard withdrew Julian's teaching assistantship, making it impossible for him to complete his Ph.D. at Harvard.|$|E
5|$|In February 1937, Agnew entered Johns Hopkins University as <b>a</b> <b>chemistry</b> major. After {{the first}} few months he found the {{pressure}} of the academic work increasingly stressful, and was distracted by the family's continuing financial problems and worries about the international situation, in which war seemed likely. In 1939 he decided that his future lay in law rather than chemistry, left Johns Hopkins and began night classes at the University of Baltimore School of Law. To support himself, he took a day job as an insurance clerk with the Maryland Casualty Company.|$|E

5|$|Seaborg kept a daily journal from 1927 {{until he}} {{suffered}} a stroke in 1998. As a youth, Seaborg was both a devoted sports fan and an avid movie buff. His mother encouraged {{him to become a}} bookkeeper as she felt his literary interests were impractical. He did not take an interest in science until his junior year when he was inspired by Dwight Logan Reid, <b>a</b> <b>chemistry</b> and physics teacher at David Starr Jordan High School in Watts.|$|E
5|$|The Creeper sneaks out and escapes while Donelly and Gates {{infiltrate}} his hideout {{and discover}} Jimmy's corpse. Donnelly also finds a newspaper clipping {{with a man}} named Hal Moffet {{and two of his}} friends, Clifford Scott (Tom Neal) and Virginia Rogers (Jan Wiley), during their college days. The police visit Clifford and Virginia, who are now married and wealthy. Clifford tells the officers during college, Hal was a handsome college football star who competed with Clifford for Virginia's affections. One day, while helping Hal prepare for <b>a</b> <b>chemistry</b> exam, a jealous Clifford deliberately gave him the wrong answers, resulting in Hal being asked by Professor Cushman to remain after class for extra work. While working on <b>a</b> <b>chemistry</b> experiment, Clifford walks by the window with Virginia to boast. Furious, Hal hurls a beaker to the ground, accidentally causing an explosion that disfigures his face. Donnelly speculates that Hal is the Creeper, and that he killed Professor Cushman and Joan because he holds them partially responsible for his accident.|$|E
5|$|With its {{enrollment}} swelling, {{the college}} almost immediately outgrew the Alumnae Gymnasium. By September 1892, a second-floor hall was converted into an assembly hall and by 1897, <b>a</b> <b>chemistry</b> laboratory was moved from Main Building to a retrofitted auxiliary gym in the Alumnae Gymnasium. The Board of Trustees allocated $25,000 {{to expand the}} gymnasium on June 12, 1905, after considering options of expansion as early as 1901.

5|$|Catherine Hicks plays Doctor Gillian Taylor, a {{biologist}} on 20th century Earth. During production a rumor circulated that the part {{had been created}} after Shatner demanded a love interest, a regular aspect of the television series that was absent from the first three films. Writer Nicholas Meyer denied this, saying that the inspiration for Taylor came from a woman biologist featured in a National Geographic documentary about whales. Nimoy chose Hicks after inviting her to lunch with Shatner and witnessing <b>a</b> <b>chemistry</b> between the two. The role was originally written for Eddie Murphy as an astrophysicist at Berkeley.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his high}} school {{graduation}} in 1981, Steve Perry left his hometown of Binghamton, New York, for Eugene, Oregon, to pursue track and field and <b>a</b> <b>chemistry</b> degree at the University of Oregon. A punk rock fan since adolescence, Perry soon became engrossed in Eugene's underground music scene, where he eventually met and befriended musician and fellow University student Dan Schmid. Sharing similar musical ambitions and a mutual disinterest in school, the pair agreed {{to drop out of}} college together and start a band, forming the punk trio The Jazz Greats in 1983, which evolved into the Paisley Underground-styled garage rock group Saint Huck, who lasted from 1984 to 1987.|$|E
5|$|From 1932 to 1934, Spedding {{worked for}} Lewis as <b>a</b> <b>chemistry</b> instructor. Around this time, he became {{interested}} in the chemistry of the rare earths. These were expensive and hard to find, and generally available only in minute amounts. In 1933 he won the Irving Langmuir Award for most outstanding young chemist. The award came with a cash prize of $1,000. He borrowed money to travel to Chicago to collect it. While he was there, he was approached by a man offering several pounds of Europium and Samarium. His benefactor was Herbert Newby McCoy, a retired chemistry professor from the University of Chicago, who had obtained a supply of these elements from the Lindsey Light and Chemical Company, where they were a byproduct of thorium production. A few weeks later, Spedding received a package in the mail containing jars of the metals.|$|E

5|$|In 2000, it was {{confirmed}} that although relativistic effects are important, bohrium behaves {{like a typical}} group 7 element. A team at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) conducted <b>a</b> <b>chemistry</b> reaction using six atoms of 267Bh produced in the reaction between 249Bk and 22Ne ions. The resulting atoms were thermalised and reacted with a HCl/O2 mixture to form a volatile oxychloride. The reaction also produced isotopes of its lighter homologues, technetium (as 108Tc) and rhenium (as 169Re). The isothermal adsorption curves were measured and gave strong evidence for the formation of a volatile oxychloride with properties similar to that of rhenium oxychloride. This placed bohrium as a typical member of group 7. The adsorption enthalpies of the oxychlorides of technetium, rhenium, and bohrium were measured in this experiment, agreeing very well with the theoretical predictions and implying a sequence of decreasing oxychloride volatility down group 7 of TcO3Cl > ReO3Cl > BhO3Cl.|$|E
5|$|Leo James Rainwater {{was born}} on December 9, 1917, in Council, Idaho, {{the son of a}} former civil {{engineer}} who ran the local general store, Leo Jaspar Rainwater and his wife Edna Eliza n√©e Teague. He never used his first name and was always referred to as James or Jim. His father died in the great influenza epidemic of 1918 and Rainwater and his mother moved to Hanford, California, where she married George Fowler, a widower with two sons, Freeman and John. In time he also acquired a half-brother, George Fowler, Jr., who became naval officer. At high school he excelled in mathematics, chemistry and physics and was admitted to the California Institute of Technology on the strength of <b>a</b> <b>chemistry</b> competition. He received his Bachelor of Science degree as a physics major in 1939.|$|E
5|$|Ruthenium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Ru and atomic number 44. It {{is a rare}} transition metal belonging to the platinum group of the periodic table. Like the other metals of the platinum group, ruthenium is inert to most other chemicals. The Baltic German scientist Karl Ernst Claus discovered the element in 1844 and named it after his homeland, Ruthenia. Ruthenium is usually found as a minor component of platinum ores; the annual production is about 20 tonnes. Most ruthenium produced is used in wear-resistant electrical contacts and thick-film resistors. A minor application for ruthenium is in platinum alloys and as <b>a</b> <b>chemistry</b> catalyst.|$|E

5|$|The three story mansion {{house was}} broken up into {{workshops}} and living quarters. The workshops were <b>a</b> <b>chemistry</b> lab, a print shop, a shipping room, a carpentry work area and machine shop facilities. The attic above the third story was devoted entirely {{for all the}} machines and associated tools necessary {{for the construction of}} airships. One first floor room was a large library with many books on aeronautics and science, where Myers researched often and brainstormed with his wife. There were out-buildings scattered throughout the five acres that contained gas engines, chemical labs, and furnace facilities.|$|E
5|$|Liddell's {{official}} debut for Liverpool came in {{the third}} round of the FA Cup, the first competitive football tournament to be organised in post-war England. He started in the first leg against Chester City on 5 January 1946 and scored in the 30th minute. The match ended in a 2‚Äì0 win and featured several additional debutants, including Bob Paisley, who would forge <b>a</b> <b>chemistry</b> with Liddell as a left half. League football completed its first full season under the provisional North and South divisional system, which facilitated the restoration of national football for the 1946‚Äì47 season. Although he established himself in the North League, scoring 17 goals in 42 matches, Liddell had yet to be discharged from the RAF and did not accompany Liverpool during its post-season tour of North America in May 1946. His unavailability extended to pre-season training and the first two matches of the 1946‚Äì47 season. On 7 September, Liddell registered his first official league appearance and scored twice in a 7‚Äì4 defeat of Chelsea.|$|E
5|$|Strong {{hurricane}} force {{winds were}} reported along the Louisiana coast at landfall. Grand Isle reported sustained winds of 100mph (160km/h), while gusts in Thibodaux and Napoleonville were estimated at 120mph (195km/h). Three churches, a warehouse, and ten stores were destroyed in Thibodaux. A weather station in New Orleans observed a peak wind gust of 52mph (84km/h). Severe damage was reported between New Orleans and Baton Rouge, which included uprooted trees and displaced barns. Roads were also blocked by debris. Window {{damage caused by}} strong winds was reported in New Orleans. Baton Rouge was affected by a power outage, resulting in $20,000 in losses to the local electric company. Communication wires were downed in Morgan City, preventing communication with other cities. Houses were also unroofed in the city by strong winds. A ferry was also wrecked by the hurricane offshore of Morgan Point. In Houma, an estimated 90% of sugar cane was lost due to the hurricane. The city's sugarhouse was also destroyed, along with an Episcopal church. Three passenger trains along the Southern Pacific Railroad were detained in Avondale, Louisiana after winds were determined to be too unsafe for rail operations. The strong winds and rain also caused a mail plane to crash. In Tulane University, <b>a</b> <b>chemistry</b> building was destroyed by a fire during the hurricane. Several other fires were reported in various areas of New Orleans.|$|E
