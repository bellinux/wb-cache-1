5|$|Mephedrone is a monoamine {{releasing}} agent. It is a chiral {{compound and}} both of its enantiomers display similar potency as substrates at dopamine transporters. R-Mephedrone is much less potent than S-mephedrone <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>substrate</b> at serotonin transporters.|$|E
5|$|Other NAD-dependent enzymes include {{bacterial}} DNA ligases, which join two DNA ends {{by using}} NAD <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>substrate</b> to donate an adenosine monophosphate (AMP) moiety to the 5' phosphate of one DNA end. This intermediate is then {{attacked by the}} 3' hydroxyl group of the other DNA end, forming a new phosphodiester bond. This contrasts with eukaryotic DNA ligases, which use ATP to form the DNA-AMP intermediate.|$|E
5|$|Because of its {{excellent}} thermal {{and chemical}} stability, boron nitride ceramics are traditionally used {{as parts of}} high-temperature equipment. h-BN can be included in ceramics, alloys, resins, plastics, rubbers, and other materials, giving them self-lubricating properties. Such materials are suitable for construction of e.g. bearings and in steelmaking. Plastics filled with BN have less thermal expansion as well as higher thermal conductivity and electrical resistivity. Due to its excellent dielectric and thermal properties, BN is used in electronics e.g. <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>substrate</b> for semiconductors, microwave-transparent windows and as a structural material for seals. It {{can also be used}} as dielectric in resistive random access memories.|$|E

5|$|Nicotinamide adenine {{dinucleotide}} {{has several}} essential roles in metabolism. It {{acts as a}} coenzyme in redox reactions, as a donor of ADP-ribose moieties in ADP-ribosylation reactions, as a precursor of the second messenger molecule cyclic ADP-ribose, as well as acting <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>substrate</b> for bacterial DNA ligases {{and a group of}} enzymes called sirtuins that use NAD to remove acetyl groups from proteins. In addition to these metabolic functions, NAD+ emerges as an adenine nucleotide that can be released from cells spontaneously and by regulated mechanisms, and can therefore have important extracellular roles.|$|E
5|$|Several enzymes {{can work}} {{together}} in a specific order, creating metabolic pathways. In a metabolic pathway, one enzyme takes the product of another enzyme <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>substrate.</b> After the catalytic reaction, the product is then passed on to another enzyme. Sometimes more than one enzyme can catalyze the same reaction in parallel; this can allow more complex regulation: with, for example, a low constant activity provided by one enzyme but an inducible high activity from a second enzyme.|$|E
5|$|Adamussium colbecki is a large, slow-growing scallop {{that lives}} on the seabed. The shell {{consists}} {{of a pair of}} ribbed calcareous valves which enclose the soft body and are joined by a ligament at a hinge. It feeds on microscopic green algae and is sometimes present in great numbers. It is able to move around by flapping its valves and to dart backwards to escape threats. The species is an important member of the Antarctic seabed community as the upper valve often acts <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>substrate</b> for seaweeds, sponges and other organisms. In addition, juveniles bind themselves by threads to the upper valve of older shells, using these as a base for several years as they grow. The adult scallops have been used in research to study the accumulation of heavy metals in marine organisms.|$|E

5|$|It is {{not known}} if C.tuberosa is {{strictly}} parasitic, and needs the host to be living, {{or whether it is}} saprobic. Either way, the fruit bodies of the fungus are found growing solitarily or in dense clusters on the decomposing, often blackened remains of other mushrooms. Hosts include agarics (particularly Lactarius and Russula), boletes, hydnums, and polypores. In the Pacific Northwest region of the United States, Russula crassotunicata is a common and abundant species that has been definitively identified as a host of both C.tuberosa and Dendrocollybia racemosa. The Russula fruit bodies are slow to decay, and are available nearly year-round <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>substrate</b> for the saprobes. Based on field observations, the authors suggest that C.tuberosa may produce fruit bodies on less decayed mushrooms, while D.racemosa produces them on much more heavily decayed mushrooms.|$|E
5|$|Physiological enzyme {{inhibition}} {{can also be}} produced by specific protein inhibitors. This mechanism occurs in the pancreas, which synthesises many digestive precursor enzymes known as zymogens. Many of these are activated by the trypsin protease, so {{it is important to}} inhibit the activity of trypsin in the pancreas to prevent the organ from digesting itself. One way in which the activity of trypsin is controlled is the production of a specific and potent trypsin inhibitor protein in the pancreas. This inhibitor binds tightly to trypsin, preventing the trypsin activity that would otherwise be detrimental to the organ. Although the trypsin inhibitor is a protein, it avoids being hydrolysed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>substrate</b> by the protease by excluding water from trypsin's active site and destabilising the transition state. Other examples of physiological enzyme inhibitor proteins include the barstar inhibitor of the bacterial ribonuclease barnase and the inhibitors of protein phosphatases.|$|E
5|$|The Western Ghats {{extend from}} the Satpura Range in the north, {{stretching}} from Gujarat to Tamil Nadu. It traverses south past {{the states of}} Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka and Kerala. Major gaps in the range are the Goa Gap, between the Maharashtra and Karnataka sections, and the Palghat Gap on the Tamil Nadu and Kerala border between the Nilgiri Hills and the Anaimalai Hills. The mountains intercept the rain-bearing westerly monsoon winds, and are consequently an area of high rainfall, particularly on their western side. The dense forests {{also contribute to the}} precipitation of the area by acting <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>substrate</b> for condensation of moist rising orographic winds from the sea, and releasing much of the moisture back into the air via transpiration, allowing it to later condense and fall again as rain.|$|E

25|$|Crithidia luciliae are haemoflaggelate single celled protists. They {{are used}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>substrate</b> in {{immunofluorescence}} {{for the detection}} of anti-dsDNA antibodies. They possess an organelle known as the kinetoplast which is a large mitochondrion with a network of interlocking circular dsDNA molecules. After incubation with serum containing anti-dsDNA antibodies and fluorescent-labelled anti-human antibodies, the kinetoplast will fluoresce. The lack of other nuclear antigens in this organelle means that using C.luciliae <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>substrate</b> allows for the specific detection of anti-dsDNA antibodies.|$|E

25|$|An {{effective}} treatment to prevent toxicity after methanol or ethylene glycol ingestion is to administer ethanol.
