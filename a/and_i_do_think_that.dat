The former was well {{received}} at its premiere in Hamburg in April 1884, but received a critical savaging when staged at Covent Garden in July of the same year. Parry commented privately, [...] "It seems very badly constructed for the stage, poorly conceived and the music, though clean and well-managed, is not striking or dramatic." [...] The most severe public criticism was in The Theatre, whose reviewer wrote, [...] "The book of Savonarola is dull, stilted, and, from a dramatic point of view, weak. It is not, however, so crushingly tiresome as the music fitted to it. Savonarola has gone far to convince me that opera is quite out of [...] line and that the sooner he abandons the stage for the cathedral, the better for his musical reputation." [...] The Canterbury Pilgrims had been premiered in London in April 1884, three months before Savonarola was presented at Covent Garden. It had a better reception than the latter, though reviews pointed out Stanford's debt to Die Meistersinger, and complained of a lack of emotion in the love music. George Grove agreed with the critics, writing to Parry, [...] "Charlie's music contains everything but sentiment. Love not at all – that I heard not a grain of. ... <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> there might be more tune. Melody is not a thing to be avoided surely." [...] In 1896 a critic wrote that the opera had [...] "just such a 'book' as would have suited the late Alfred Cellier. He would probably have made of it a charming light English opera. But Dr. Stanford has chosen to use it for the exemplification of those advanced theories which we know him to hold, and he has given us music which would incline us to think that Die Meistersinger had been his model. The effect of the combination is not happy." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I grant," [...] he said, [...] "that {{you would}} gain greater comfort by {{adopting}} something of our civilization. You might improve your dwellings, hangings round your walls would {{keep out the}} bitter winds, well made doors are in winter very preferable to the skins which hang at your entrance, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> a Carthaginian cook might, with advantage, give lessons to the tribes as to preparations of food; but beyond that I {{think that you have}} the best of it." ...|$|E

[...] "But you see, {{he did not}} know Reuben as we do; and I think, if you will excuse my saying so, you have been a little hasty, too. The squire came in to me to tell me about it, and I could see he was not satisfied in his mind, even before I gave him my positive opinion that Reuben was innocent; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> if you had not given Mrs. Ellison notice so sharply, the squire would have taken back his words; and said that at any rate, as there was nothing absolutely proved, he would hold his judgment in suspense until the matter was cleared up." ...|$|E
