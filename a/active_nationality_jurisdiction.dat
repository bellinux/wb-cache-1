40|$|Various recent {{developments}} {{within and without}} the United Kingdom have strengthened the arguments in favour of the adoption of general <b>nationality</b> based criminal <b>jurisdiction.</b> These arise from problems {{in the application of}} territorial jurisdiction, increasingly frequent crime-specific reference to <b>nationality</b> based <b>jurisdiction,</b> the development of European Union law, the ever-greater mobility of nationals, the ability to commit crimes remotely, the incorporation of the European Convention of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms into United Kingdom law, an evolution in the citizen-state relationship, and the increasing internationalisation of criminal law. It is not suggested that territory should no longer find a central place in the criminal law rather that the original and present arguments in its favour have been greatly weakened and, at the same time, the arguments in favour of <b>nationality</b> based <b>jurisdiction</b> have been strengthened. This article details the present nature of criminal jurisdiction, highlights the deficiencies with territorial jurisdiction and outlines the case in favour of a general <b>nationality</b> based criminal <b>jurisdiction...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{negotiation}} of the International Criminal Court’s jurisdiction {{proved to be}} highly controversial during the Diplomatic Conference at Rome in 1998. Despite this, {{the jurisdiction of the}} Court has not yet been a major issue in practice. Present situations before the Court, such as the situation in Palestine, however, mean that a re-examination of the Court’s jurisdictional scope is timely. In this vein, it is argued that territorial disputes between a State Party and a non-Party should not act as a bar to the exercise of the Court’s jurisdiction, and that the Court’s territorial jurisdiction may be properly understood as encompassing ‘objective territoriality’. The Court’s territorial jurisdiction, however, cannot be understood as permitting an application of the ‘effects doctrine’. Finally, the issue of <b>nationality</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> is explored, and it is concluded that this jurisdictional basis will be of limited practicality in the Court’s goal of ending impunity. If such a goal is to be achieved, States must be willing to try serious international criminals municipally...|$|R
5000|$|More specifically, the OECD Convention {{requires}} that bribery of foreign public officials be punishable, by effective, proportionate and dissuasive criminal penalties {{comparable to those}} applicable to their own public officials. It commits Parties to interpret territorial jurisdiction in as broad a manner as possible and to establish <b>nationality</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> if this is in accord with their legal system. Parties are obliged to establish corporate liability (the liability of [...] "legal persons") for foreign bribery, and where a Partys legal system does not provide criminal liability for companies, the Party must apply effective, proportionate and dissuasive non-criminal sanctions to them. Furthermore, countries must facilitate mutual legal assistance and cannot invoke [...] "bank secrecy" [...] to deny mutual legal assistance. While the OECD Convention {{is important in the}} sense that it creates the obligation for state parties to criminalize the bribery of foreign public officials, it does not directly consider the recovery of proceeds of corruption.|$|R

The theoretical background is based upon Weiner and Mc Clelland’s formulations. Groups of Argentinean and Brazilian secondary students classified as “successful” and “not successful” by their mathematics and social science grades teachers, were analysed. Multidimensional analyses of numerical and symbolic data revealed several different relationships between <b>active</b> (<b>nationality,</b> sex, schools, etc.) and illustrative (dimensional meaning of attributional causes and motivational orientation) variables. The theoretical and practical implications of the results are {{discussed in terms of}} socio-educational values in the Argentinean and Brazilian cultures...|$|R

However, under Subsection B, an offender may be indicted under the Act even if the hostage-taking occurred outside the territory of the United States if the [...] "offender or the person seized or detained is a national of the United States; the offender is found in the United States; or the governmental organization sought to be compelled is the Government of the United Stages." [...] These provisions are consistent with the fundamental principles of international criminal law, specifically <b>active</b> <b>nationality</b> principle, universal principle, and the effects principle, respectively.|$|R

40|$|When a {{host state}} does not prosecute a U. S. {{national}} who commits a violent crime abroad, the United States does not exercise jurisdiction. Should the United States eschew <b>nationality</b> <b>jurisdiction,</b> when it may provide the only basis for prosecution? Part II of this article traces the evolution of nationalitybased criminal jurisdiction in U. S. law and asserts that the United States has in fact embraced such jurisdiction in the past, usually to ensure that U. S. offenders abroad were tried by U. S. courts rather than foreign tribunals. Part III examines the current U. S. jurisdictional scheme, which relies on foreign states to prosecute U. S. offenders abroad, and concludes that the scheme is inadequate because foreign states often cannot or will not prosecute. Part In further argues that only nationality-based jurisdiction could extend to all crimes committed by U. S. nationals abroad. Part IV asserts that the establishment of nationality-based criminal jurisdiction {{would be consistent with}} the U. S. Constitution and with international law. Finally, Part V sets forth practical considerations that should inform the establishment and exercise of nationalitybased criminal jurisdiction...|$|R
40|$|Increasingly, investor-state arbitral tribunals {{have found}} {{themselves}} faced with claims by holding companies, subsidiaries or ultimate beneficiaries within “corporate groups,” where {{the basis of the}} claim concerns property acquired in, or from, a fellow group member. Whilst the primacy of the state of incorporation for the purposes of <b>nationality</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> remains fundamentally intact, the question remains as to whether the shifting of assets entirely within a group can be considered an ‘investment’ in terms of a tribunal’s ratione materiae jurisdiction. This paper offers an analysis of corporate groups predicated on their observed economic behaviour, with a view to how this might impinge on the economic conception of investment proffered in the jurisprudence of arbitral tribunals since Salini v Morocco. The author suggests that the activities of closely-held subsidiaries cannot technically be classed as investments, lacking a sufficient independent contribution and expectation of a pecuniary return. However, the outcome which is more consistent with the purposes and the consensus of prior awards is that such transactions still amount to an investment by reference to the underlying commitment of the parent company. This paper concludes with a brief discussion of whether such claims nevertheless represent an abuse of process...|$|R

40|$|As stated at Nuremberg, {{the crime}} of {{aggression}} is the “supreme international crime, differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole. ” International instruments clearly and repeatedly have outlawed initiating wars of aggression and other illegal uses of armed force. States parties recently have defined and codified the crime in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) and delineated {{the scope of the}} ICC’s jurisdiction over aggression. Although the ICC is an important mechanism for accountability and justice, it is not certain when {{it will be able to}} adjudicate {{the crime of}} aggression. Moreover, the ICC will not have jurisdiction to prosecute all individuals who wage aggressive war, nor will it be free of political cooptation by states parties interested in quashing attempts to seek justice for acts of aggression committed by their leaders. Consequently, advocates combating impunity for international crimes should continue to view the ICC as a court of last resort, especially for prosecuting cases of aggression. Despite the many legal and political challenges, primary responsibility for prosecuting individuals for the use of armed force in violation of the U. N. Charter—the crime of aggression—should still rest with national courts. Once aggression is criminalized at the domestic level, three types of extraterritorial jurisdiction—passive <b>nationality</b> <b>jurisdiction,</b> protective jurisdiction, and universal jurisdiction—are avenues for enabling criminal prosecution of leaders who illegally use armed force. This Article examines each of these principles, their potential, and the challenges inherent in prosecuting the crime of aggression in national courts. In addition, it supports scholars’ arguments for expanding national-level jurisdiction over crimes of aggression committed domestically and internationally, finding that the crime of aggression is among the ‘core’ international crimes demanding accountability at the domestic level. It challenges arguments put forth by some scholars that national legislatures and prosecutors should not criminalize or prosecute individuals who wage aggressive war and finds that domesticating international criminal law, including outlawing the crime of aggression, is essential to achieve more effective prosecution of aggression. Unless additional exceptions are made to the current legal structures, however, the challenges of bringing perpetrators of aggressive war to justice under domestic law are considerable. Individual states, therefore, should (1) exercise jurisdiction and prosecute the crime whenever possible, and (2) consider ways to widen domestic avenues for justice in cases of aggression...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} question of this thesis is if {{and to what}} extent international does international law allow home states to exercise extraterritorial jurisdiction over the TNCs in order to enforce internationally acknowledged corporate human rights standards in host states. In the first part the thesis discusses which corporate human rights standards derive from international law. This analysis is limited to standards deriving from the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), customary law and jus cogens (for the purpose of this thesis conceived as being part of customary law). In the second part the thesis analyses if {{and to what extent}} international law allows home states of TNCs to exercise extraterritorial jurisdiction over TNCs aiming at enforcement of internationally acknowledged corporate human rights standards in a host state. The discussion is limited to extraterritorial jurisdiction which is based on the internationally acknowledged <b>active</b> <b>nationality</b> principle. The second part of the thesis starts with an analysis of this principle. In this context the thesis discusses under which circumstances a home state can assert corporate nationality of a TNC entity. Subsequently, the thesis identifies the limitations international law provides for extraterritorial jurisdiction. Particular focus are the limitations deriving from the sovereignty of the host states. In a second step the identified limitations are applied to a predefined thesis scenario. For this purpose this thesis scenario is split up in several sub-scenarios. The analysis of the limitations which international law provides for extraterritorial jurisdiction are approached by two different perspectives: The perspective of the classical doctrine on international jurisdiction and a human rights perspective...|$|R
40|$|This paper explores {{international}} {{responses to}} foreign bribery {{with a specific}} focus on Canada’s increased role in combating the issue. It outlines international anti-bribery measures {{and their impact on}} Canada’s approach to foreign bribery, with an overview of Canada’s anti-bribery legislation, the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act (CFPOA). These measures have met with international criticism, to which Canada has responded with legislative amendments. Four Canadian legal decisions since the CFPOA amendment exemplify Canada’s stricter enforcement of the Act. Transparency International (TI) issued a progress report that commented on Canada’s current and future role in the fight against foreign bribery. The paper concludes with an examination of Canada’s 2014 anti-bribery legislation, the Extractive Sector Transparency Measures Act (ESTMA). Canada’s recent measures suggest it is ready to follow international leaders in enforcing foreign bribery. This will result in more prosecutions of Canadian individuals and corporations.

40|$|In the Interwar period, the Jewish {{population}} of East Central Europe experienced its {{first and last}} opportunity to engage in modern political life as a nationality among the nationalities. This study of nationality politics is organized around "Jewish nationality," a new category of political nationhood introduced after the First World War, in order to investigate questions of establishing, administering, and securing viable successor states to the multi-national Austro-Hungarian, Russian, and Ottoman empires created {{according to the national}} principle. Focusing on the territory of Slovakia, I examine what Jewish nationality meant and how it was used within the context of Czechoslovak state building, both {{from the perspective of the}} state and of the Jewish population. While Czechoslovakia offered the most favorable environment for the Jews of its neighbors, renounced anti-Semitism, supported Zionism and Jewish national rights, significant challenges to the Jewish relationship with the state remained. This was particularly true in Slovakia, where Jews were suspect as potential accomplices to the irredentist ambitions of the Interwar Hungarian regime due to their history of alignment with the Hungarian nation. The process of integrating the territory of Slovakia had the most significant impact on how the Czechoslovak state and the surrounding Slovak population viewed expressions of Jewish nationality among the Jews there. This study shows that the intensifying overlap of language, nationality, and territory eroded Jewish nationality as a means of negotiating the Jewish position among the nationalities "here," and led to the growth of Palestine-centered Jewish nationalism. I base my arguments on archival research conducted in Slovakia, Hungary, and the Czech Republic in Slovak, Czech, Hungarian, and German focusing on issues of (1) the wartime Jewish refugee crisis as a politicizing force within the Hungarian Jewish community, (2) the bureaucracy of nationalism through the lens of the Czechoslovak census, and (3) transnational investigations of Slovak Jewish loyalty to the Czechoslovak state.
