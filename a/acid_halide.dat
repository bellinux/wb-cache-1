50|$|An acyl halide (also {{known as}} an <b>acid</b> <b>halide)</b> is a {{chemical}} compound derived from an oxoacid by replacing a hydroxyl group with a halide group.|$|E
50|$|Alcohols and amines {{react with}} <b>acid</b> <b>halides</b> to produce esters and amides, respectively, in a {{reaction}} formally {{known as the}} Schotten-Baumann reaction. <b>Acid</b> <b>halides</b> hydrolyze {{in the presence of}} water to produce carboxylic acids, but this type of reaction is rarely useful, since carboxylic acids are typically used to synthesize <b>acid</b> <b>halides.</b> Most reactions with <b>acid</b> <b>halides</b> are carried out {{in the presence of a}} non-nucleophilic base, such as pyridine, to neutralize the hydrohalic acid that is formed as a byproduct.|$|R
50|$|The {{chemistry}} of <b>acid</b> <b>halides</b> and anhydrides is similar. While anhydrides cannot {{be converted to}} <b>acid</b> <b>halides,</b> they {{can be converted to}} the remaining acyl derivatives. Anhydrides also participate in Schotten-Baumann-type reactions to furnish esters and amides from alcohols and amines, and water can hydrolyze anhydrides to their corresponding acids. As with <b>acid</b> <b>halides,</b> anhydrides can also react with carbon nucleophiles to furnish ketones and/or tertiary alcohols, and can participate in both the Friedel-Crafts acylation and the Weinreb ketone synthesis. Unlike <b>acid</b> <b>halides,</b> however, anhydrides do not react with Gilman reagents.|$|R

50|$|As {{usual for}} an <b>acid</b> <b>halide,</b> acetyl bromide hydrolyzes rapidly in water, forming acetic acid and hydrobromic acid. It also reacts with {{alcohols}} and amines to produce acetate esters and acetamides, respectively.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike {{most other}} carbon nucleophiles, lithium dialkylcuprates - often called Gilman {{reagents}} - {{can add to}} acid halides just once to give ketones. The reaction between an <b>acid</b> <b>halide</b> and a Gilman reagent is not a nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction, however, and is thought to proceed via a radical pathway. The Weinreb ketone synthesis {{can also be used}} to convert acid halides to ketones. In this reaction, the <b>acid</b> <b>halide</b> is first converted to an N-methoxy-N-methylamide, known as a Weinreb amide. When a carbon nucleophile - such as a Grignard or organolithium reagent - adds to a Weinreb amide, the metal is chelated by the carbonyl and N-methoxy oxygens, preventing further nucleophilic additions.|$|E
50|$|In the Friedel-Crafts acylation, acid halides act as {{electrophiles}} for electrophilic aromatic substitution. A Lewis acid - such as {{zinc chloride}} (ZnCl2), iron(III) chloride (FeCl3), or aluminum chloride (AlCl3) - coordinates to the halogen on the <b>acid</b> <b>halide,</b> activating the compound towards nucleophilic attack by an activated aromatic ring. For especially electron-rich aromatic rings, the reaction will proceed without a Lewis acid.|$|E
50|$|Typical {{carbonyl}} compounds are ketones, aldehydes, carboxylic acids, esters, and <b>acid</b> <b>halides.</b> Carboxylic <b>acids,</b> esters, and <b>acid</b> <b>halides</b> {{can be reduced}} to either aldehydes or a step further to primary alcohols, depending on the strength of the reducing agent; aldehydes and ketones can be reduced respectively to primary and secondary alcohols. In deoxygenation, the alcohol can be further reduced and removed altogether.|$|R
50|$|The {{carboxylic}} acid derivatives can be esters, anhydrides, <b>acid</b> <b>halides</b> {{or any other}} activated species.|$|R
50|$|The {{chemistry}} of thioesters and <b>acid</b> <b>halides</b> is similar, the reactivity being reminiscent of, but milder, than acid chlorides.|$|R
5000|$|The {{sequence}} {{for preparing}} the hydroxyketone started by {{conversion of the}} acid (1) to its chloride with thionyl chloride. Reaction of that <b>acid</b> <b>halide</b> with diazomethane gives the diazoketone (...) [...] The hydroxyl group at C3 is then oxidized to the corresponding ketone {{by means of an}} Oppenauer reaction. Treatment of the product (...) with gaseous hydrogen chloride replaces nitrogen in that intermediate by chlorine. Displacement of chlorine by acetate then leads to the 21-acetate (...) [...] Saponification of the ester completes the sequence.|$|E
5000|$|Acetyl iodide is an organoiodine {{compound}} {{with the}} formula CH3C(O)I. It is a colourless liquid. It is formally derived from acetic acid. Although far rarer {{in the laboratory}} than the related acetyl bromide and acetyl chloride, acetyl iodide is produced, transiently at least, on a far larger scale than any other <b>acid</b> <b>halide.</b> Specifically, it is generated by the carbonylation of methyl iodide in the Cativa and Monsanto processes that are the main industrial route to acetic acid. [...] It is also an intermediate {{in the production of}} acetic anhydride from methyl acetate.|$|E
50|$|Aramid fibres {{are most}} {{commonly}} known as Kevlar, Nomex and Technora. Aramids are generally prepared by the reaction between an amine group and a carboxylic <b>acid</b> <b>halide</b> group (aramid); commonly this occurs when an aromatic polyamide is spun from a liquid concentration of sulphuric acid into a crystallized fibre. Fibres are then spun into larger threads in order to weave into large ropes or woven fabrics (Aramid). Aramid fibres are manufactured with varying grades to based on varying qualities for strength and rigidity, so that the material can be somewhat tailored to specific design needs concerns, such as cutting the tough material during manufacture.|$|E
25|$|Highly {{reactive}} acid derivatives such as <b>acid</b> <b>halides</b> {{are easily}} obtained by mixing with halogenation agents like phosphorus chlorides or thionyl chloride.|$|R
50|$|Esters exhibit less {{resonance}} stabilization than amides, so {{the formation}} of a tetrahedral intermediate and subsequent loss of resonance is not as energetically unfavorable. Anhydrides experience even weaker resonance stabilization, since the resonance is split between two carbonyl groups, and are more reactive than esters and amides. In <b>acid</b> <b>halides,</b> there is very little resonance, so the energetic penalty for forming a tetrahedral intermediate is small. This helps explain why <b>acid</b> <b>halides</b> are the most reactive acyl derivatives.|$|R
50|$|<b>Acid</b> <b>halides</b> are {{the most}} {{reactive}} acyl derivatives, and can easily be converted {{into any of the}} others. <b>Acid</b> <b>halides</b> will react with carboxylic acids to form anhydrides. If the structure of the acid and the acid chloride are different, the product is a mixed anhydride. First, the carboxylic acid attacks the acid chloride (1) to give tetrahedral intermediate 2. The tetrahedral intermediate collapses, ejecting chloride ion as the leaving group and forming oxonium species 3. Deprotonation gives the mixed anhydride, 4, and an equivalent of HCl.|$|R
50|$|Acid halides {{will react}} with carbon nucleophiles, such as Grignards and enolates, though {{mixtures}} of products can result. While a carbon nucleophile will react with the <b>acid</b> <b>halide</b> first {{to produce a}} ketone, the ketone is also susceptible to nucleophilic attack, and {{can be converted to}} a tertiary alcohol. For example, when benzoyl chloride (1) is treated with two equivalents of a Grignard reagent, such as methyl magnesium bromide (MeMgBr), 2-phenyl-2-propanol (3) is obtained in excellent yield. Although acetophenone (2) is an intermediate in this reaction, it is impossible to isolate because it reacts with a second equivalent of MeMgBr rapidly after being formed.|$|E
50|$|Nucleophilic acyl {{substitution}} {{describe a}} class of substitution reactions involving nucleophiles and acyl compounds. In this type of reaction, a nucleophile - such as an alcohol, amine, or enolate - displaces the leaving group of an acyl derivative - such as an <b>acid</b> <b>halide,</b> anhydride, or ester. The resulting product is a carbonyl-containing compound in which the nucleophile has taken {{the place of the}} leaving group present in the original acyl derivative. Because acyl derivatives react {{with a wide variety of}} nucleophiles, and because the product can depend on the particular type of acyl derivative and nucleophile involved, nucleophilic acyl substitution reactions can be used to synthesize a variety of different products.|$|E
5000|$|Another common {{example is}} the {{reaction}} of a primary amine or secondary amine with a carboxylic acid or with a carboxylic acid derivative to form an amide. This reaction is widely used, especially in the synthesis of peptides. On the simple addition of an amine to a carboxylic acid, a salt of the organic acid and base is obtained. To overcome this, the carboxylic acid first needs to be [...] "activated". This is usually done by converting the acid into a more reactive derivative (i.e. anhydride, <b>acid</b> <b>halide)</b> or by using a coupling agent. In some cases, high temperatures (>200 Â°C) can overcome salt formation by driving off water, {{without the need for}} [...] "activation" [...] of the carboxyl group. The downside to this simple reaction is that the compounds may decompose at these elevated temperatures.|$|E
50|$|The {{result of}} these trends in {{carbonyl}} reactivity is that <b>acid</b> <b>halides,</b> ketones, and aldehydes are usually the most readily reduced compounds, while acids and esters require stronger reducing agents.|$|R
50|$|Esters {{are less}} {{reactive}} than <b>acid</b> <b>halides</b> and anhydrides. As with more reactive acyl derivatives, they can react with ammonia and {{primary and secondary}} amines to give amides, though this type of reaction is not often used, since <b>acid</b> <b>halides</b> give better yields. Esters {{can be converted to}} other esters in a process known as transesterification. Transesterification can be either acid- or base-catalyzed, and involves the reaction of an ester with an alcohol. Unfortunately, because the leaving group is also an alcohol, the forward and reverse reactions will often occur at similar rates. Using a large excess of the reactant alcohol or removing the leaving group alcohol (e.g. via distillation) will drive the forward reaction towards completion, in accordance with Le Chatelier's principle.|$|R

40|$|Comprehensive {{understanding}} of organic and inorganic compounds in atmospheric particles of different size fractions ranging from coarse to ultrafine {{is essential for}} assessment {{of the impact of}} particles on the radiation balance. In this work the size resolved atmospheric particles were collected in the vicinity of three iron and steelmaking sites and one urban background site in Australia using an eight staged micro orifice uniform deposit impactor (MOUDI) sampler. The sampled particles were assessed using FTIR technique to determine the dominant functional groups, and XRD technique for determining the mineral content of the inorganic compounds. This study revealed variable distributions between and among bonding groups in urban and industrial areas.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to explore intramolecular ketene cycloadditions with the anticipated results of developing new synthetic methodology for the synthesis of polycyclic compounds difficult to obtain by other procedures. (o-Alkenylphenoxy) ketenes were initially selected for this study because these ketenes provided a favorable proximity for the intramolecular [2 + 2] cycloaddition reactions. The difunctional precursors, (o-alkenylphenoxy) - acetic acids, were readily prepared from o-alkenylphenols and â-halocarboxylic acids and were converted to the corresponding acid chlorides by reaction with oxalyl chloride. The acid chlorides were dehydrochlorinated to the corresponding (o-alkenylphenoxy) ketenes by treatment with triethylamine. The ketenes undergo a facile intramolecular [2 + 2] cycloaddition to give polycyclic eye 1 obutanones. The (o-vinylphenoxy) ketenes are clearly more reactive than the (o-allylphenoxy) ketenes and provide much better yields of the cycloaddition products because of electronic effects in the transition state in the cycloaddition process. The intramolecular [2 + 2] cycloadditions of keteniminium salts were included in this study as a more electrophilic alternative to ketenes that will react with less nucleophilic carbon-carbon double bonds. However, the use of keteniminium salts instead of ketenes in Intramolecular cycloadditions does have some limitations. The synthesis of benzofurans via the intramolecular [2 + 2] cycloadditions of (o-acylphenoxy) ketenes was accomplished. The initially formed Ã-lactone cycloaddition products spontaneously underwent decarboxylation to the benzofurans. The aromaticity of the benzofurans is apparently a very strong driving force for the cycloaddition. During the course of this study, two new synthetic methods were discovered which in many instances represent a significant Improvement over existing methods. The Wittig Reactions of ketoacids without protecting the carboxyl groups provide a reliable source of the precursor unsaturated acids needed for intramolecular ketene-olefin cycloadditions. Also, the one-pot preparation of intramolecular ketene cycloaddition products from the carboxylic acid via the tosylate represents a new synthetic method. This procedure eliminates the <b>acid</b> <b>halide</b> preparation, isolation and purification step, thereby significantly simplifying the synthesis...|$|E
