5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{exited the}} western coast of Africa on September26, quickly spawning an <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>low</b> <b>pressure.</b> Upon {{the formation of}} the low, the wave split into two pieces and a second <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> developed along the southern portion of the wave as it traveled west. The northern low quickly developed, spawning Tropical Depression Fourteen on September28. The southern low attached to the wave failed to develop and moved away from the intensifying tropical depression. It continued through the Atlantic, entering the Pacific Ocean, after crossing Central America, on October8. A broad <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> accompanied by showers and thunderstorms developed along the wave around 275miles (440kilometres) south of Acapulco, Mexico. However, the low remained disorganized because of strong upper-level winds. On October13, the low became better organized due to a relaxation in the shear. The low developed enough convection late on October14 to be declared Tropical Depression Fifteen-E while located about 435mi (705km) southwest of Colima, Mexico.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance is MFR's generic {{term for a}} non-frontal <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> that has organized convection and definite cyclonic surface wind circulation. The system should be estimated to have wind speeds of less than 28knots (50km/h, 32mph).|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on August 24. It developed into an <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> as it crossed the Atlantic, and organized into Tropical Depression Thirteen on August 28 while 960mi (1550km) east of the Lesser Antilles.|$|E
25|$|Air inlets were {{positioned}} in zones of high air pressure, and hot air outlets {{from the engine}} and brakes in <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>low</b> <b>pressure.</b>|$|R
50|$|On August 3, several <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> developed. Frontal systems {{extended}} from one <b>of</b> the <b>lows,</b> {{stretching from the}} Azores to the Germany coastline.|$|R
500|$|Wind is {{initially}} accelerated from <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> high <b>pressure</b> to <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>low</b> <b>pressure.</b> [...] This {{is due to}} density (or temperature and moisture) differences between two air masses. [...] Since stronger high-pressure systems contain cooler or drier air, the air mass is denser and flows towards areas that are warm or moist, which are in the vicinity <b>of</b> low-pressure <b>areas</b> in advance <b>of</b> their associated cold fronts. [...] The stronger the pressure difference, or pressure gradient, between a high-pressure system and a low-pressure system, the stronger the wind. [...] Thus, stronger <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> are associated with stronger winds.|$|R
5|$|An <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>low</b> <b>{{pressure}}</b> tracked across southeastern Canada {{during the}} 12th, which brought an arctic front across the Mid Atlantic region {{late on the}} 12th. As this occurred, a strong area of high pressure located across central Canada built down into the Northeast, allowing very cold air to spill southward ultimately leading to {{what is known as}} cold air damming. This occurs east of the mountains down through the Mid Atlantic states. Meanwhile, a Pacific storm slammed onto the California coast during the 11th and as it moved eastward, a new <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> developed across southeastern Colorado and the Texas Panhandle.|$|E
5|$|October 29, 2017â€“ Tropical Storm Philippe {{is absorbed}} by a non-tropical <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>low</b> <b>pressure,</b> which brought heavy {{rainfall}} and high winds to the state. Snow also fell in extreme western portions.|$|E
5|$|A low {{pressure}} area moved to the west off the Burmese coast on July 5 and developed into a depression {{the next day in}} the north central Bay of Bengal. The depression intensified as it moved to the northwest, becoming a deep depression on July 7. The system made landfall on the Orissa coast during the morning of July 8 and rapidly degenerated into a broad <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> overland. The remnant low moved north over western Bihar and it persisted there until July 12 when it was absorbed by the monsoon trough.|$|E
50|$|On 3 March 1997 the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) {{observed}} two <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>low</b> <b>pressure,</b> {{that had}} developed within the monsoon trough from North-eastern Australia to the Coral Sea. Over {{the next couple}} of days, both systems developed further and were classified as tropical depressions during 5 March.|$|R
50|$|Storms {{are created}} when a center <b>of</b> <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> {{develops}} {{with a system}} of high pressure surrounding it. This combination of opposing forces can create winds and result {{in the formation of}} storm clouds, such as the cumulonimbus. Small localized <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> can form from hot air rising off hot ground, resulting in smaller disturbances such as dust devils and whirlwinds.|$|R
5|$|Isobaric {{analysis}} is performed on these maps, which involves {{the construction of}} lines of equal mean sea level pressure.

5|$|A low {{pressure}} area that developed in the Bay of Bengal passed over the southern Indian subcontinent and developed into a depression in the Arabian Sea off the southern Maharashtra coast on October 11. The depression did not develop as it drifted west, and it degenerated into an <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> as it was approaching the Arabian Peninsula. The depression brought widespread rains to southern Maharashtra and Karnataka states, with 40mm (1.5in) of rain recorded in Karwar. Scattered heavy rain was also reported in the Laccadives.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave emerged off {{the western}} coast of Africa on June24, eventually emerging into the Gulf of Mexico on July7. An <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> became discernible, and {{with data from}} a reconnaissance aircraft, the system was upgraded to a tropical depression by 00:00UTC on July8. The depression failed to organize appreciably as it tracked west to west-northwest, moving ashore South Padre Island, Texas with winds of 35mph (55km/h) by 14:00UTC that day. The depression degenerated into a remnant low by 06:00UTC on July9 and dissipated over northern Mexico a day later.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on August 19, accompanied with spiral bands of convection around an <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>low</b> <b>pressure.</b> A large circulation quickly developed once it reached the Atlantic Ocean, and the system organized into Tropical Depression Four late on August 19 while located 345mi (555km) southeast of Cape Verde. Initial forecasts predicted for great intensification, including one forecast for the depression to strengthen to a hurricane within three days. However, the depression remained disorganized, and slowly intensified to attain tropical storm status on August 22.|$|E

5|$|A weak surface trough, located to {{the west}} of an upper-level low, {{developed}} convection to the east of the Bahamas on July 26. A tropical wave entered the area two days later, resulting in an increase of convective organization and area. Although conditions were not favorable for tropical cyclone formation, it sped to the northwest and steadily organized, developing a surface <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> on the 30th. On July 31, the system continued to organize, and developed into Tropical Depression One while located 200miles (320km) to the east of Jacksonville, Florida.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Kate {{originated}} from an <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> that was first identified on 22 February 2006, within a monsoonal trough. The system rapidly intensified throughout the day, with the Australian Bureau of Meteorology issuing their first advisory {{on the system}} that evening. Upon being classified, the system was immediately declared Tropical Cyclone Kate, skipping tropical low status. At the same time, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) also began issuing advisories on the system, designating it as Tropical Cyclone 13P. The storm had developed well-defined, upper-level outflow enhanced by diffluence over the system.|$|E
5|$|Gradual {{development}} {{took place}} as convection consolidated around {{the center of}} circulation while located west of Sonora. During the afternoon of September20, an <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> developed within the system, prompting the NHC to classify it as a tropical depression.

5|$|Hurricane Arlene {{originated}} {{out of an}} <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> {{associated with}} a decaying frontal system along the North Carolina coastline on August8. Tracking towards the southeast in a gradual anticyclonic loop, the system slowly increased in organization and intensity. By August10, the low neared the Bahamas but remained disorganized. The following day, while located over Andros Island, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) upgraded the system to a tropical depression, the third of the season, based on its appearance on satellite imagery.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Carlotta was {{the most}} {{powerful}} hurricane of the 2000 Pacific hurricane season. The third tropical cyclone of the season, Carlotta developed from a tropical wave on June 18 about 270miles (470km) southeast {{off the coast of}} Mexico. With favorable conditions for development, it strengthened steadily at first, followed by a period of rapid deepening to peak winds of 155mph (250km/h) on June 22. Cooler waters caused Carlotta to gradually weaken, and on June 25 it degenerated into a remnant <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> while located about 260miles (420km) west-southwest of Cabo San Lucas.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Fran rapidly tracked {{towards the}} {{northeast}} {{in response to}} an <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> within the westerlies. By October11, the hurricane attained its peak winds of 80mph (130km/h) and its lowest barometric pressure of 978mbar (hPa; 28.88inHg) after bypassing the Azores islands. Situated over exceedingly cold waters, Fran transitioned into an extratropical cyclone late on October12 as it neared the French coastline. Shortly before reaching land, the system was absorbed by a cold front. Throughout its existence, Fran had little effect on land.|$|E

50|$|During December 2013, several deep <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> {{moved across}} {{or to the}} north of the British Isles, {{bringing}} high wind speeds and heavy rain to many locations. This weather was connected to major perturbations to the Pacific and North Atlantic jet streams, which was partially caused by persistent rainfall over Indonesia and the tropical Pacific Ocean. The Northern Atlantic jet stream was also unusually strong, which was linked to an unusually strong westerly phase of the stratospheric Quasi-biennial oscillation which drove a very deep polar vortex and strong polar night jet.|$|R

5|$|Hurricane Georges {{began as}} a {{tropical}} wave that moved {{off the coast of}} Africa during mid-September 1998. Tracking westward, the wave spawned an <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> two days later, which quickly strengthened into a tropical depression. On September16, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Georges, and to Hurricane Georges the next day. The storm reached its peak intensity on September20 with winds of 155mph (250km/h), just below Category 5 status on the Saffirâ€“Simpson hurricane wind scale.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Humberto {{formed from}} an <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> {{generated}} by Hurricane Gabrielle. The low formed into a tropical depression on September 21 while south of Bermuda, tracking northwest, {{and was named}} Tropical Storm Humberto the next day.

Humberto headed over the colder waters of the far north Atlantic Ocean, and dissipated quickly on September 27.|$|E
5|$|Late on October 26, a broad <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> in {{the southwestern}} Caribbean {{developed}} and became Tropical Depression Twenty-six. Six hours later, it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Beta. Beta strengthened into a hurricane on October 29. On October 30, Hurricane Beta became a major hurricane with sustained winds around 115mph (185km/h). That brought {{the total amount of}} major hurricanes in the 2005 season to Seven, a record breaking achievement only tied by 1961.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the cardiac cycle, in early diastole, both the atria and ventricles are relaxed. Since blood moves from <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> high <b>pressure</b> to <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>low</b> <b>pressure,</b> when the chambers are relaxed, blood will flow into the atria (through the coronary sinus and the pulmonary veins). As the atria begin to fill, the pressure will rise so that the blood will move from the atria into the ventricles. In late diastole the atria contract, pumping more blood into the ventricles. This causes a rise in pressure in the ventricles. As the ventricles reach systole, blood will be pumped into the pulmonary artery (right ventricle) or aorta (left ventricle).|$|R
25|$|The Tropical {{continental}} airmass (CT) finally retreats {{from most}} part of Nigeria, and the West African atmosphere around April to May, leaving an empty atmosphere over Nigeria. The sun's rays enters {{into the atmosphere}} of Nigeria more intense than it does during {{the presence of the}} Tropical continental airmass, which contained dust (in form of haze) that reduced the intensity of the sun. The overheating of the west Africa land mass and Nigeria in particular creates a <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> region over west Africa and Nigeria. This <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> zone attracts the Tropical Maritime Airmass (MT) from the south Atlantic Ocean since <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>low</b> <b>pressures</b> experiences inward blowing winds because winds are moving air blowing outwards from regions of high <b>pressure</b> to regions <b>of</b> <b>low</b> <b>pressure.</b>|$|R
5000|$|During 1998 {{a debate}} started about {{if it was}} {{discrimination}} to name <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> high pressure with male names and the <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> with female names. The issue was subsequently resolved by alternating male and female names each year. In November 2002 the [...] "Adopt-a-Vortex" [...] scheme began, which allows {{members of the public}} or companies to buy naming rights for a letter chosen by the buyer that are then assigned alphabetically to high and <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> areas in Europe during each year. The naming comes with the slim chance that the system will be notable. The money raised by this is used by the meteorology department to maintain weather observations at the Free University.|$|R
