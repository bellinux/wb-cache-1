40|$|Since a few decades, {{dairy cows}} {{have shown a}} steep {{increase}} in milk production, which is unfortunately accompanied by a dramatic decline in reproductive performance. In these high yielding cows there are more puerperal problems than in low yielding cows, such as retained placenta, acute metritis and abnormal vaginal discharge. Cows affected by retained placenta and/or acute metritis are furthermore at a significantly higher risk of other typical 'dairy cow diseases' as <b>acetonaemia,</b> left displaced abomasum and cystic ovarian disease. Therefore {{it is important that}} puerperal metritis is treated properly with broadspectrum antibiotics both parenterally and intra-uterine during 1 - 3 days depending on the severity of the symptoms. Cows with chronic endometritis need no treatment before 30 days post partum. From day 30 on they should be treated twice with prostaglandins at an interval of 14 days. A challenge for the future is to clearly determine all risk factors for uterine disease. One of the major risk factors is a retained placenta. Correct nutrition during the dry off period and a normal calving process under hygienic conditions are the paramount factors in the prevention of this risk factor...|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} with 25 dairy cows {{was performed to}} investigate the effects of different energy intakes on food intake, performance and blood hormone and metabolite levels during the last 70 days of pregnancy and the first 125 days after parturition. Compared with animals fed ad libitum before parturition, cows fed only according to requirements {{during the same time}} showed no decrease of food intake at calving. Cows fed at a restricted level also showed a faster increase in food intake, a smaller energy deficiency at the onset of lactation and a smaller weight loss after parturition. Peak milk yield was also lower, but the peak was maintained for a longer period, and during the first 2 months of lactation these cows had higher concentrations of glucose and lactic acid, and lower concentrations of non-esterified fatty acids and ketone bodies in the blood. Weight losses, and decrease of milk production during the 1 st weeks of lactation were higher in cows fed only 0 Â· 75 of requirements during the first 60 days of lactation than in animals whose energy intake was planned to cover energy requirements, and during the first 2 months of lactation levels of unesterified fatty acids, ketone bodies and urea were higher, whereas levels of insulin, thyroxine and triiodothyronine were lower. Endocrine and metabolic changes seen during early lactation suggested improved glucose homeostasis, diminished fat mobilization and ketogenesis in cows given reduced amounts of energy during the dry period compared to animals fed ad libitum. To prevent the development of <b>acetonaemia</b> an adequate energy supply during the first part of lactation is, however, of greater importanc...|$|E
40|$|DE 102009045724 B 3 UPAB: 20110214 NOVELTY - The sensor (1) has an {{interferometer}} (30) {{provided for}} detecting vibration of a resonance body (11), which enables optical detection of {{location of a}} partial surface (116) of the resonance body. The resonance body and the interferometer are arranged on a substrate (50), which comprises semiconductor material. The resonance body is formed of a recess (51) in the substrate. A resonator (70) partially limits certain space for receiving of molecules to be detected. Optical wave guides (32, 42) are integrated on the substrate in silicon-on-insulator technology. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following: (1) a method for photo acoustic detection of molecules in a gas phase (2) a method for manufacturing the gas sensor. USE - Photo acoustic gas sensor for photo acoustic detection of presence and/or quantity of molecule species in a gas phase for process controlling in an industrial system e. g. heating system, ventilation system and/or air conditioning system and/or for monitoring carbon-di-oxide, oxygen, nitrogen oxide, nitrogen, ethane and hydrogen in an ambient air and/or for monitoring acetone and respiration alcohol content in a respiratory gas and/or for determining combustion value of combustion gas from an internal combustion engine and biogas from a biogas system and/or for monitoring fire protection and/or for analysis of skin perspiration of a living being for detection of <b>acetonaemia</b> for treatment of diabetes and and/or for quality monitoring and/or for monitoring degree of ripeness of a foodstuff e. g. fruits and vegetables, and/or plants in cooling containers (all claimed). ADVANTAGE - The gas sensor exhibits a compact construction form. The design of the sensor enables acoustic detection of presence and/or quantity of molecule species in the gas phase in a reliable manner. The gas sensor is manufactured in a simple and economical manner...|$|E
