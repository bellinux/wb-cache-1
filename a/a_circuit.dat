5|$|In United States federal courts, <b>a</b> <b>circuit</b> split {{occurs when}} {{two or more}} {{different}} circuit courts of appeals provide conflicting rulings on the same legal issue. The existence of <b>a</b> <b>circuit</b> split {{is one of the}} factors that the Supreme Court of the United States considers when deciding whether to grant review of a case. Some scholars suggest that the Supreme Court is more likely to grant review of a case to resolve <b>a</b> <b>circuit</b> split than for any other reason.|$|E

50|$|Rectifier {{circuits}} {{are often}} classified {{by the number}} of current pulses that flow to the DC side of the rectifier per cycle of AC input voltage.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} analyses {{performed on}} design techniques implemented on <b>a</b> mixed-signal <b>circuit</b> {{with the goal}} of minimizing static and dynamic power consumptions.

The techniques are applied on <b>a</b> digital <b>circuit,</b> <b>a</b> Phase Detector, as well as on <b>an</b> analog <b>circuit,</b> <b>a</b> voltage-controlled oscillator.

5|$|In Marbury, the Supreme Court {{held that}} Madison's failure {{to deliver the}} {{commission}} to Marbury was illegal, but did not grant Marbury a writ of mandamus {{on the ground that}} § 13 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 was unconstitutional insofar as it authorized the Court to issue such writs under its original jurisdiction. Stuart v. Lairdinvolving a civil judgment rendered by <b>a</b> <b>circuit</b> court constituted under the Midnight Judges Act and enforced by <b>a</b> <b>circuit</b> court constituted under the Judiciary Act of 1802challenged the constitutionality both of abolishing the circuit judgeships and of requiring the Supreme Court justices to ride circuit. In a brief opinion, the Court rejected both challenges.|$|E

50|$|<b>As</b> <b>circuit</b> {{design is}} the process of working out the {{physical}} form that <b>an</b> electronic <b>circuit</b> will take, the result of the circuit design process is the instructions on how to construct the physical electronic circuit.

50|$|In {{electrical}} engineering and science, <b>an</b> equivalent <b>circuit</b> refers to <b>a</b> theoretical <b>circuit</b> that retains {{all of the}} electrical characteristics of <b>a</b> given <b>circuit.</b> Often, <b>an</b> equivalent <b>circuit</b> is sought that simplifies calculation, and more broadly, that is a simplest form of <b>a</b> more complex <b>circuit</b> in order to aid analysis. In its most common form, <b>an</b> equivalent <b>circuit</b> {{is made up of}} linear, passive elements. However, more complex equivalent circuits are used that approximate the nonlinear behavior of the original circuit as well. These more complex circuits often are called macromodels of the original circuit. An example of a macromodel is the Boyle circuit for the 741 operational amplifier.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{address the problem of}} {{determining}} whether <b>a</b> transistor <b>circuit</b> possesses multiple dc operating points. We investigate how the sign change of the determinant corresponding to the Jacobian matrix associated with circuit equations can be used to indicate the number of dc operating points in <b>a</b> transistor <b>circuits.</b> We give circuit examples that illustrate that these criteria may not be reliable, and show that resistor values that determine the number of <b>a</b> <b>circuit's</b> dc operating points, may or may not affect the value of the calculated determinant.
