50|$|Following Sanger {{sequencing}} of the 16s rRNA, both parsimony and distance matrix <b>analyses</b> <b>were</b> <b>performed</b> {{to determine the}} position of T. celer on the tree of life. It was discovered that T. celer is {{more closely related to}} the methanogenic archaebacteria than the thermophilic archaebacteria. This discovery resulted in a re-rooting of the archaebacterial tree and subsequently placed T. celer in a clade with the methanogens based upon their close phylogenetic relationship. This placement was further supported following analysis of the organizational genome structure of the both species’ rRNA genes. Both Thermococcus and methanogenic archaebacteria have a tRNA spacer gene located between the 16s rRNA gene and 23s rRNA gene. This spacer gene is not found in any other thermophilic archaebacteria species.|$|E

50|$|Major {{developments}} in the field {{can be seen in}} the 1930s by several groups in psychology, anthropology, and mathematics working independently. In psychology, in the 1930s, Jacob L. Moreno began systematic recording and analysis of social interaction in small groups, especially classrooms and work groups (see sociometry). In anthropology, the foundation for social network theory is the theoretical and ethnographic work of Bronislaw Malinowski, Alfred Radcliffe-Brown, and Claude Lévi-Strauss. A group of social anthropologists associated with Max Gluckman and the Manchester School, including John A. Barnes, J. Clyde Mitchell and Elizabeth Bott Spillius, often are credited with performing some of the first fieldwork from which network <b>analyses</b> <b>were</b> <b>performed,</b> investigating community networks in southern Africa, India and the United Kingdom. Concomitantly, British anthropologist S. F. Nadel codified a theory of social structure that was influential in later network analysis. In sociology, the early (1930s) work of Talcott Parsons set the stage for taking a relational approach to understanding social structure. Later, drawing upon Parsons' theory, the work of sociologist Peter Blau provides a strong impetus for analyzing the relational ties of social units with his work on social exchange theory.|$|E
50|$|With {{a general}} formula for the epidote group of A2M3Si3O13H dollaseite-(Ce) {{receives}} its formula of CaREE3+Mg2AlSi3O11,(OH)F {{based on data}} from electron-microprobe analytical procedures. The results give the empirical formula (Ca.91 Ce.45 La.20 Nd.20 Pr.09 Sm.08 Gd.06)(Mg1.81 Fe.25)Al.97 Si3.0(OH)1.25 F.88 O10.99 from which the standard formula is then derived after applying Levinson’s rules for renaming REE minerals. Before any of these highly technological <b>analyses</b> <b>were</b> <b>performed</b> on dollaseite-(Ce) specimens, mistakes were made on the composition of the mineral. After further analysis were made it was determined that dollaseite-(Ce) was not the Magnesium (Mg) analogue of allanite as originally believed by Gaijer (1927) and was renamed. Geijer (1927) however, {{was not the only one}} to have had reported minerals with compositions that would be similar to an Mg analogue of allanite. Enami and Zang’s (1988), Meyer (1911), Hanson and Pearce (1941) also reported minerals that resembled the composition of an Mg analogue of allanite but none had sufficient data, or exact composition to be declared as an Mg analogue of allanite. It was not until 1991 that Edward S. Grew established dissakisite as the actual Mg dominant allanite mineral with formula Ca(Ce,La)MgAl2Si3O12(OH).|$|E

A total of 110 human root segments were instrumented to size 80 under irrigation with 1% sodium hypochlorite. Half of the roots were irrigated with a 5-mL rinse of 17% EDTA to remove the smear layer. Roots were filled with gutta-percha (GP) and AH Plus sealer (AH), GP and Apexit sealer (AP), or RealSeal cones and sealer (RS). Following storage in humid conditions at 37 degrees C for 7 days, the specimens were mounted into a bacterial leakage test model for 135 days. Survival <b>analyses</b> <b>were</b> <b>performed</b> to calculate the median time of leakage and log-rank test was used for pairwise comparisons of groups. Selected specimens were longitudinally sectioned and inspected by scanning electron microscopy for the presence of bacteria at the interfaces. In the presence of the smear layer, RS and AP leaked significantly more slowly than in its absence. In the absence of the smear layer, AH leaked significantly more slowly than RS. It was concluded that removal of the smear layer did not impair bacterial penetration along root canal fillings. A comparison of the sealers revealed no difference except that AH performed better than RS {{in the absence of the}} smear layer.|$|E
