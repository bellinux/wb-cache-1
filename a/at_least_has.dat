5|$|Emma asks Mr. Gold (Robert Carlyle) {{about the}} compass and he {{searches}} his records. He finds {{a card that}} supposedly says Michael Tillman purchased the compass, and gives Emma this name. The card is revealed to be blank. Michael is the garage mechanic, and tells Emma he can barely handle the garage let alone twins. Emma {{has no choice but}} to take Ava and Nicholas to Boston on Regina's orders, despite Henry's warnings that no one can leave Storybrooke. That evening as the three are leaving, the vehicle breaks down as they reach the city limits, prompting Emma to call for help. Moments later, Ava notices her compass working. Michael arrives in his tow truck, and Emma explains that he <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>has</b> to see his children, as she could not leave Henry after seeing the life he had. Seeing Ava and Nicholas face to face changes his mind, and Michael accepts them into his life. Later, Emma shares Henry's theory with Mary Margaret (Ginnifer Goodwin), that she is Snow White's daughter and Mary Margaret is Snow White. Mary finds this laughable, but seeing Emma's blanket triggers some sort of reaction from her. After a minute, however, she is quick to dismiss it as nothing.|$|E
5|$|The {{structure}} of solid astatine is unknown. As an analogue of iodine {{it may have}} an orthorhombic crystalline structure composed of diatomic astatine molecules, and be a semiconductor (with a band gap of 0.7 eV). Alternatively, if condensed astatine forms a metallic phase, as has been predicted, it may have a monatomic face-centered cubic structure. Evidence for (or against) the existence of diatomic astatine (At2) is sparse and inconclusive. Some sources state {{that it does not}} exist, or <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>has</b> never been observed, while other sources assert or imply its existence. Despite this controversy, many properties of diatomic astatine have been predicted; for example, its bond length would be 300 ±10 pm, dissociation energy 83.7 ±12.5 kJ·mol−1,, Cl2, Br2, I2, and At2| url=http://theochem.chem.rug.nl/publications/PDF/ft279.pdf| journal=The Journal of Chemical Physics |volume=104 |issue=22|pages=9040–9046| doi=10.1063/1.471636|bibcode= 1996JChPh.104.9040V}} and heat of vaporization (∆Hvap) 54.39 kJ·mol−1. The latter figure means that astatine may (at least) be metallic in the liquid state on the basis that elements with a heat of vaporization greater than ~42 kJ·mol−1 are metallic when liquid; diatomic iodine, with a value of 41.71 kJ·mol−1, falls just short of the threshold figure.|$|E

25|$|Plastic {{reinforcement}} {{often is}} stronger, or <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>has</b> a better {{strength to weight}} ratio than reinforcing steels. Also, because it resists corrosion, it does not need a protective concrete cover as thick as steel reinforcement does (typically 30 to 50mm or more). FRP-reinforced structures therefore can be lighter and last longer. Accordingly, for some applications the whole-life cost will be price-competitive with steel-reinforced concrete.|$|E
25|$|Sir Alan Burns, Governor of British Honduras (1934-1939), used Benque Viejo as {{an example}} of one {{challenge}} that teaching in Belizean schools presents: “I have heard German nuns trying to teach Maya children out of an English textbook which they had to explain in Spanish.” The solution, in higher education <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>has</b> been to require English in the classroom. The Garifuna have enculturated the Catholic Mass and have it in their own language. As regards the Kriol language which most speak in Belize City there has been more controversy. Several Christian churches have introduced Kriol into their services and a Kriol New Testament has been produced. But the Catholic Mass, requiring approval from Roman authorities, has not been translated into Kriol. On the other hand, Catholics are deeply involved in the Kriol Council, and St. John’s College through its Belize Institute for Social Research and Action (BISRA) publishes Belizean Studies which carries articles on the role of Kriol and other cultures in Belizean Society.|$|E

Kapadia employed a Parsi accent for the role and, while preparing for it, visited several Irani cafés in Mumbai to understand their cultural basics and get into the mood of the character. The film opened to average reviews, but her performance received generally positive feedback, with several critics noting her chemistry with Patekar.

500|$|Æthelwulf's {{reputation}} among historians {{was poor}} in the twentieth century. In 1935 the historian R. H. Hodgkin attributed his pilgrimage to Rome to [...] "the unpractical piety which had led him to desert his kingdom {{at a time of}} great danger", and described his marriage to Judith as [...] "the folly of a man senile before his time". To Stenton in the 1960s he was [...] "a religious and unambitious man, for whom engagement in war and politics was an unwelcome consequence of rank". One dissenter was [...] Finberg, who in 1964 described him as [...] "a king whose valour in war and princely munificence recalled the figures of the heroic age", but in 1979 Enright said: [...] "More than anything else he appears to have been an impractical religious enthusiast." [...] Early medieval writers, especially Asser, emphasise his religiosity and his preference for consensus, seen in the concessions made to avert a civil war on his return from Rome. In Story's view [...] "his legacy has been clouded by accusations of excessive piety which (to modern sensibilities <b>at</b> <b>least)</b> <b>has</b> seemed at odds with the demands of early medieval kingship". In 839 an unnamed Anglo-Saxon king wrote to the Holy Roman Emperor Louis the Pious asking for permission to travel through his territory on the way to Rome, and relating an English priest's dream which foretold disaster unless Christians abandoned their sins. This is now believed to have been an unrealised project of Egbert {{at the end of his}} life, but it was formerly attributed to Æthelwulf, and seen as exhibiting what Story calls his reputation for [...] "dramatic piety", and irresponsibility for planning to abandon his kingdom at the beginning of his reign.|$|E

2500|$|Philosophers such as Plato, Aristotle, Al-Farabi, Avicenna, Averroes, Maimonides, Aquinas and Hegel are {{sometimes}} {{said to have}} argued that reason must be fixed and discoverable—perhaps by dialectic, analysis, or study. In the vision of these thinkers, reason is divine or <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>has</b> divine attributes. Such an approach allowed religious philosophers such as Thomas Aquinas and Étienne Gilson to try to show that reason and revelation are compatible.

2500|$|Riessman's seminal article {{explored}} how nonprofessionals supported {{one another}} in self-help/mutual-aid support groups based on Riessman's observations of a sample of these groups, {{as well as his}} summary of the findings of research in the areas of social work, education, and leadership. This article suggested that although the [...] "use of people with a problem to help other people who have the same problem in [...] more severe form" [...] is [...] "an age-old therapeutic approach," [...] the traditional focus on outcomes for those receiving help to the exclusion of considering outcomes for those providing help is too narrow; instead, Riessman advocated for increased consideration of the experience of [...] "the individual that needs the help less, that is, the person who is providing the assistance" [...] because [...] "frequently it is he who improves!" [...] (p.27). Although Riessman expressed doubt that individuals receiving help always benefit from the assistance provided to them, he felt more sure that individuals providing help are likely experiencing important gains; thus, according to Riessman, the helping interaction <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>has</b> the potential to be mutually beneficial for both parties involved (i.e., for both the individual giving and for the individual receiving aid), but it is not absolutely necessary for the [...] "helpee" [...] to benefit in order for the [...] "helper" [...] to enjoy the benefits of helping. In instances where true mutual benefit occurs, the helper and helpee benefit in different ways, such that the person receiving help benefits by way of receiving whatever specific form of assistance is offered to them (e.g., emotional support, information, etc.) while the person providing help benefits by the very act of providing help, regardless of the type of aid they provide.|$|E
2500|$|W. A. Speck {{wrote in}} 1980 that a reason Macaulay's History of England [...] "still {{commands}} respect {{is that it}} was based upon a prodigious amount of research". Speck claims that [...] "Macaulay's reputation as an historian has never fully recovered from the condemnation it implicitly received in Herbert Butterfield's devastating attack on The Whig Interpretation of History. Though he was never cited by name, {{there can be no doubt}} that Macaulay answers to the charges brought against Whig historians, particularly that they study the past with reference to the present, class people in the past as those who furthered progress and those who hindered it, and judge them accordingly". Speck also said that Macaulay too often [...] "denies the past has its own validity, treating it as being merely a prelude to his own age. This is especially noticeable in the third chapter of his History of England, when again and again he contrasts the backwardness of 1685 with the advances achieved by 1848. Not only does this misuse the past, it also leads him to exaggerate the differences". On the other hand, Speck also wrote that Macaulay [...] "took pains to present the virtues even of a rogue, and he painted the virtuous warts and all", and that [...] "he was never guilty of suppressing or distorting evidence to make it support a proposition which he knew to be untrue". Speck concluded: [...] "What is in fact striking is the extent to which his History of England <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>has</b> survived subsequent research. Although it is often dismissed as inaccurate, it is hard to pinpoint a passage where he is categorically in error... his account of events has stood up remarkably well... His interpretation of the Glorious Revolution also remains the essential starting point for any discussion of that episode... What has not survived, or has become subdued, is Macaulay's confident belief in progress. It was a dominant creed in the era of the Great Exhibition. But Auschwitz and Hiroshima destroyed this century's claim to moral superiority over its predecessors, while the exhaustion of natural resources raises serious doubts about the continuation even of material progress into the next." ...|$|E
