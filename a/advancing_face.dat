40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{investigate}} numerically {{the evolution}} of surface settlement during continuous tunnel excavation by formulating and solving the poro-elasticity equations in a frame of reference, which is fixed to the moving face. In tunnelling through low-permeability soils, consolidation processes take place in general simultaneously with the spatial stress redistribution {{in the vicinity of}} the <b>advancing</b> <b>face.</b> Apart from the borderline case of highly permeable ground or very slow excavation, the excavation advance rate must be taken into consideration. One can readily verify by a dimensional analysis that the time-development of settlement is governed by the ratio of advance rate to ground permeability. The higher the advance rate, the lower the surface settlements and the angular distortion will be. ...|$|E

40|$|Large face {{datasets}} {{are important}} for <b>advancing</b> <b>face</b> recogni-tion research, but they are tedious to build, {{because a lot of}} work has to go into cleaning the huge amount of raw data. To facilitate this task, we describe an approach to building face datasets that starts with detecting faces in images returned from searches for public figures on the Internet, followed by discarding those not belonging to each queried person. We formulate the problem of identifying the faces to be removed as a quadratic programming problem, which exploits the observations that faces of the same person should look similar, have the same gender, and normally appear at most once per image. Our results show that this method can reli-ably clean a large dataset, leading to a considerable reduction in the work needed to build it. Finally, we are releasing the FaceScrub dataset that was created using this approach. It consists of 141, 130 faces of 695 public figures and can be ob-tained fro...|$|E
40|$|A {{knowledge}} of {{angle of repose}} and stability of waste rock dump slopes is of vital importance at all mine sites. Conventional slope stability analyses model slopes in plane strain. In reality, slopes advance in a curvilinear pattern in plan and hence produce slope faces that are either convex or concave in plan. The three - dimensional shape of the waste rock dump {{is similar to that}} of a solid body of revolution, which may be modelled using a two-dimensional grid and a radial coordinate system. A 250 m high in-pit waste rock dump at Kidston Gold Mines Limited, North Queensland, Australia was modelled using this technique. The analysis showed that adopting a non-linear Mohr-Columb envelope resulted in a more deeply - seated failure plane than would occur using a linear envelope. A slope with a concave <b>advancing</b> <b>face</b> in plan was stable at an angle at least 2 ° steeper than an identical slope advancing in a straight line in plan. On the other hand, a convex advancing slope was only just stable at an angle of 0. 5 ° flatter than an identical slope advancing in a straight lin...|$|E

The 3. 0 m high by 2. 8 m wide rectangular, tracked-tunnel was constructed by Trafalgar House Construction using drill and blast techniques to intercept a series of pre-drilled diffuser units 25 m below the sea-bed in St Ives Bay. In view of the {{close proximity to the}} sea-bed, and the risk of water ingress, systematic probe drilling was performed at regular intervals during construction.

One major fault zone required extensive grouting, as initial probe holes were making in the order of 200 gallons per minute. Tunnel advance through exceptionally poor ground required modification to the excavation methodology and implementation of additional support measures.

The tests were conducted in the mine ramp 45 m (150 ft) inward from the access portal at a 15. 25 -m- (50 -ft) long test area divided into five 3 -m- (10 -ft) long sections. The shotcrete was applied with an Aliva 240. 5 machine fitted with a predampener. Different amounts of fiber were entrained for each panel.

40|$|Generally, {{knowledge}} of stress redistribution around the longwall panel causes {{a better understanding}} of the mechanisms that lead to ground failure, especially to rock bursts. In this paper, passive seismic velocity tomography is used to demonstrate the state of stress around the longwall mining panel. The mining-induced microseismic events were recorded by mounting an array of receivers on the surface, above the active panel. To determine the location of seismic events and execute the process of tomography, double difference method is employed as a local earthquake tomography. Since passive sources are used, the ray coverage is insufficient to achieve the quality images required. The wave velocity is assumed to be the regionalized variable and it is therefore estimated in a denser network, by using geostatistical estimation method. Subsequently, the three dimensional images of wave velocity are created and are sliced into the coal seam. These images clearly illustrate the stressed zones that they are appropriately in compliance with the theoretical models. Such compliance is particularly apparent in the front abutment pressure and the side abutment pressure near the tailgate entry. Movements of the stressed zones along the <b>advancing</b> <b>face</b> are also evident. The research conclusion proves that the combined method, based on double-difference tomography and geostatistical estimation, can potentially be used to monitor stress changes around the longwall mining panel continuously. Such observation could lead to substantial improvement in both productivity and safety of mining operations...|$|E
40|$|PhD, Faculty of Engineering and the Built Environment, University of the Witwatersrand, 2010 The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to provide a proper design procedure for Merensky crush pillars, based primarily on underground measurements. Three sites with a variety of geotechnical conditions were selected. An interaction between the pillars and the rock mass around the stopes was shown by the literature, relevant laboratory tests and numerical modelling. During the investigations, nonlinear rock behaviour was observed at one of the sites. Further studies revealed that nonlinear behaviour also occurred in samples extracted from high stress conditions at the other sites, but the rock mass was not nonlinear at these sites. A methodology for determining stress from strain measured in nonlinear rock was established. The research also established that there is an approximately linear relationship between peak pillar strength and w/h ratio at ratios between about 1. 2 and 8. The so called ‘squat’ effect is not observed because pillar failure is not contained within the pillar but extends into the foundations. A linear peak pillar strength formula was established from back analyses of underground pillar failures and was confirmed by numerical modelling. Pillar behaviour was established from underground measurements on one stability pillar and six crush pillars, which included peak and residual strengths. Also, stable and unstable loading conditions were established from an analysis of pillar bursts and the minimum strata stiffness for stable pillar failure was determined. This stiffness is only achieved near the <b>advancing</b> <b>face</b> and pillars that fail in the back areas are likely to burst. For this reason, pillar design needs to include the peak strength as large pillars may be too strong and fail in the back area. The residual strength also needs to be considered as the load-bearing capacity of these pillars needs to satisfy the criterion of 1 MPa across the stope to prevent back-breaks. This translates into a pillar stress of between 8 MPa and 13 MPa if the pillar lines are spaced 30 m apart. The peak and residual requirements have been included in a design chart, and the relationship between w/h ratio and residual strength is provided in a graph for easy design...|$|E

30|$|In the {{non-periodical}} {{ground pressure}} period, {{the depth of}} coal wall spalling increased with the <b>face</b> <b>advance</b> speed at {{the upper part of}} the face, and eventually maintained at a certain depth range. When the <b>face</b> <b>advance</b> speed reached 3.05  m/d, the coal wall spalling length and depth reached their maximum values of 35  m and 0.6  m respectively, and the maximum spalling ratio was 66.67  %. The relationship between spalling length, depth, ratio and the <b>face</b> <b>advance</b> speed displayed a significant range. But generally, the values tended to increase with the <b>face</b> <b>advance</b> speed.|$|R
30|$|The <b>face</b> <b>advance</b> speed also {{significantly}} affected wall spalling. The observations at the No. 8105 coal face demonstrated {{that with the}} increase of <b>face</b> <b>advance</b> speed, there was a reduction of damage area around the coal wall, and a reduction of wall horizontal displacement. In other words, the spalling of coal wall was suppressed. It is therefore suggested that the <b>face</b> <b>advance</b> speed should be rationally increased to reduce the exposure time and spalling of coal wall. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of controlling coal wall spalling was limited through the increase of <b>face</b> <b>advance</b> speed. With a large amount of observations on site, the effect of increasing <b>face</b> <b>advance</b> speed on coal wall spalling was found.

40|$|A consistent, {{systematic}} approach for predicting settlements above tunnels in soft clay is presented. This predictive scheme provides firstly, a simple method for calculating the maximum surface settlement, and secondly, a detailed method {{for determining the}} overall pattern of displacements. In the simple method, the maximum surface settlement is estimated from {{its relationship with the}} crown displacement which can be calculated theoretically. The detailed method requires finite element analysis and comprehensive field and laboratory testing. Since the detailed analysis may be used for predicting subsurface as well as surface displacements, it is considered to be very useful for analyzing critical sections of a tunnel. The development of this technique is described and its validity and applicability are examined.;Settlement due to tunnelling is generally attributed to loss of ground and volume change in soil. In this thesis, a gap parameter is used to quantify ground loss and to model approximately the effect of soil reconsolidation in the remoulded area above the crown. The components of the gap parameter are (i) the three-dimensional elasto-plastic deformation at the <b>advancing</b> <b>face</b> of the tunnel, (ii) the physical gap defined by the shield-lining geometry, (iii) the displacement associated with workmanship which includes the effect of grouting. An additional component due to consolidation of remoulded soil above the crown may be included as part of the gap where appropriate. The practicality of using this parameter derives from its simplicity in calculation and only conventional soil parameters are required. Comparison of the calculated gap with available field observations showed reasonable agreement. From a study of thirteen case records, an empirical relationship is established for predicting surface settlement from the gap parameter.;A method of detailed analysis using the finite element method is presented. This analysis which is used in conjunction with the concept of the gap parameter, adopts an anisotropic elastic-perfectly plastic model for soil behaviour. The analysis is also formulated to permit consideration of the construction procedure, soil-liner interaction and variation of soil properties with depth.;An extensive field and laboratory investigation of the Thunder Bay soil is performed. The stratigraphy of the instrumented arrays to be examined is well defined. It is shown that the consideration of the appropriate soil stress path is essential in the selection of soil parameters for use in the analysis....

40|$|SUPPLEMENT : RESTRICTED (not {{available}} on-line) Coal {{is being}} mined from seams which lie beneath urban {{areas around the}} City of Newcastle, New South Wales, under nearby Lake Macquarie and the Pacific Ocean. Subsidence {{occurs as a result}} of pillar extraction or longwall mining and homes and other structures or surface features can be affected. Detailed field surveys commenced in the late 19602 ̆ 7 s in the coalfields north and south of Sydney. This work was developed and extended by the author in order to provide the basic information which was used to develop a method of subsidence prediction. Because of the large quantity of results, several computer programmes were designed to handle the calculations, filing and data manipulation from the field booking sheets to the presentation of calculated results from the computer. Detailed analyses of the results of these surveys have enabled the relationship between the geometry of mine workings and the subsidence at the surface to be established for the particular geological environments. This research has shown that the massive and strong conglomerates of the Newcastle area {{have a significant effect on}} the value of the maximum subsidence. For the lower range of widths of extraction, the investigations showed that the nature of the caving of the roof strata over the mined seam influenced the magnitude of the surface subsidence. Subsidence in Newcastle was shown to be significantly less than what would be experienced in areas of mainly argillaceous strata such as in the United Kingdom because of their different caving properties and strata deformation characteristics. On the basis of a theoretical subsidence prediction method developed for the Newcastle area by the author using the survey, geological and mining information, panel and pillar mining layouts are now designed for maximum coal recovery consistent with small values of maximum subsidence. With the aid of these locally established guidelines, longwall extraction is now taking place beneath the Pacific Ocean, Lake Macquarie and areas of surface development along their shorelines. The research showed that, in the Newcastle District, subsidence develops in four stages as the ratio of the width of extraction w to the depth of cover h increases for panels of critical or supercritical length. Extraction layouts with subcritical w/h values up to 0. 55 result in a slight undulation of the surface and it is within this range that panel and pillar extraction layouts have been designed for protection of structures on the surface. Where the w/h ratio is greater than 0. 55 and less than 0. 65, a pronounced subcritical subsidence trough develops. For extraction layouts where the w/h ratio is greater than 0. 65 the maximum subsidence increases rapidly as the conglomerate within the strata fails to support itself over the increasingly wide panel. The subsidence reaches its maximum possible value at a critical w/h value of around 1. 3. In the supercritical range above 1. 3 the maximum subsidence is 0. 65 of the seam height mined. The research also revealed the factors which influenced the maximum subsidence such as the recovery of coal from the seam mined, the caving of the roof strata, whether other seams have been mined, the presence of significant faulting and the stability of pillars which remain between or adjacent to extracted panels. Other features of subsidence profiles in Newcastle studied in relation to the mine geometry were the shape of the subsidence profile, the various relationships between subsidence, slope change, curvature and strain, and the time-subsidence relationships. It was also discovered that the travelling slopes and strains above an <b>advancing</b> <b>face</b> are significantly less than the final static values over the end of the panel. Strain triangles were used to investigate the magnitudes and directions of the maximum and minimum principal strains. The principles developed as a result of the author 2 ̆ 7 s research work are unique to the Newcastle district north of Sydney where they are now used as a predictive tool in the control of mine subsidence...|$|E
