25|$|Increasing {{nitrogen}} emission is {{a problem}} facing the delicate balance within the ecosystems that contain the Bay checkerspot in many areas. At Coyote Ridge the problem is well documented by conservation biologist Stuart Weiss. Faced with a declining population of Bay checkerspots at Coyote Ridge, Weiss searched for a cause. He found a link {{to a combination of}} pollution from the freeway below the ridge and, again, a cutback in cattle grazing locally. Weiss documented how nitrogen oxide emissions from cars enriched the nutrient-poor serpentine soil. This {{is a prime example of}} the nitrogen effect explained above. Aside from helping decrease nitrogen, the cattle also help to control invasive grasses by eating them. <b>Any</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> whether nitrogen emissions from cars traversing U.S. Route 101, 110,000 vehicles daily, is significant evaporates when faced with monitoring statistics from Weiss. His monitoring equipment has confirmed that 15 to 20 pounds of nitrogen per acre is deposited on Coyote Ridge annually. Some of the particles stick to the plant and ground and are washed into the soil, and others are directly absorbed by the plants themselves. By contrast, pollution from power plants and vehicles drops only about four to five pounds of nitrogen per acre per year on the Jasper Ridge preserve.|$|E

500|$|The phrase {{became a}} common witticism used among Soviet citizens; a parable {{involved}} a call-in program on Radio Moscow where <b>any</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> their living conditions {{was met with}} the answer: [...] "In America, they lynch Negroes." [...] A U.S. citizen living in the Soviet Union in 1949 was arrested after complaining the government barred him from work; a local paper made fun of his expectation of fair treatment, writing of the U.S. as [...] "the country where they lynch Negroes." [...] In 1949 Soviet author and war poet Konstantin Simonov gave a speech at a Soviet jubilee event honoring poet Alexander Pushkin, where he delineated between the Soviet Union and the Western world by simply using the phrase to refer to English-speakers: [...] "There {{is no need for}} those who hang Negroes to commemorate Pushkin!" [...] Historian Abdurakhman Avtorkhanov wrote in his 1953 book The Reign of Stalin that Soviet media put forth the notion that U.S. citizens [...] "are unanimous in pursuing an anti-colour policy, and that the average American spends his time lynching negroes." [...] Perpetuation of the phrase during the Soviet period engendered negative feelings towards the U.S. from members of the working class.|$|E

2500|$|The Morrill Tariff was {{met with}} intense hostility in Britain, where the free trade {{movement}} dominated public opinion. Southern diplomats and agents sought to use British ire towards the Morrill Tariff in order to garner sympathy, {{with the aim of}} obtaining British recognition for the Confederacy. The new tariff schedule heavily penalized British iron, clothing, and manufactured exports with new taxes and sparked public outcry from many British politicians. The expectation of high tax rates probably caused British shippers to hasten their deliveries before the new rates took effect in the early summer of 1861. When complaints were heard from London, Congress counterattacked.

[...] <b>Any</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> {{the need for}} such a law was obviated by the Ciaculli {{massacre}} in June of the following year, in which seven policemen and soldiers were killed attempting to defuse a car bomb in the suburbs of Palermo. The existence of the bomb had been disclosed by an anonymous telephone call. [...] The massacre took place in the frame of the First Mafia War in the 1960s, with the bomb intended for Salvatore Greco, head of the Sicilian Mafia Commission formed in the late 1950s. [...] The Mafia was fighting for the control of the profitable opportunities brought about by rapid urban growth and the heroin trade to North America. [...] The ferocity of the struggle was unprecedented, reaping 68 victims from 1961 to 1963. [...] The Antimafia Commission submitted its final report in 1976. The Mafia had created ties with the political world. The period 19581964, when Salvo Lima (DC) was mayor of Palermo and Vito Ciancimino (DC) was assessor for public works, was later referred to as the [...] "Sack of Palermo".|$|E
2500|$|I {{have also}} to {{acknowledge}} receipt of a letter from Mr. H.E. Holmes of Durban, enclosing the text of a pronouncement made by the South African Board of Control to the effect that, {{in the opinion of}} that body, the contest between the MCC team and The Reef at Vogelfontein on 22 and 23 December 1909, was not a first-class match. In the course of this encounter Hobbs scored 70 runs which are counted in his first-class aggregate. Seeing that the game was regarded, {{at the time it was}} played, as first-class and until a little while ago had been left in undisputed possession of that rank, the need for raising <b>any</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> the matter after more than twenty years is not at all obvious. In any circumstances, I should not advise the dragging up of what, with all due respect to the recent ruling of the South African Board, must remain a debatable matter. The Reef team included some Test match players and others who had appeared in Inter-State games so it certainly had considerable claims to be regarded as first-class and from that standing, I cannot, all things considered, agree after such a long lapse of time to reduce it. Outside the merits of the case, is there not something rather grotesque in the idea of a controlling body sitting in solemn conclave over so small a matter and deciding to upset what had been accepted for twenty years? ...|$|E
