Reviewers {{felt that the}} game would only suit existing Pokémon fans and young children: staff at 1UP.com summarized that [...] "the various diversions here are cute, slickly produced, and entertaining, <b>assuming</b> <b>you</b> really, really dig Pokémon", and that even fans would be bored if {{over the age of}} five. Justin Leeper of Game Informer claimed that fans would enjoy it but [...] "everyone else will be turned off, pun intended". Author Tokyo Drifter of GamePro guessed that the game had been [...] "tailored for die-hard fans" [...] and would please no one else. IGN's Mary Jane Irwin stated that its intuitive interface, copious instructions, and [...] "mindless entertainment" [...] would keep young players entertained.

500|$|Hadley {{found the}} most {{important}} contribution of the theoretical framework laid down in Animal Rights Without Liberation to be {{the application of a}} Razian framework of rights to animals, adding that [...] "assuming that one takes philosophical reasoning seriously, there is little to take issue with in Cochrane's analysis". However, for Hadley, there is a fundamental tension in Cochrane's theory, as there is in most animal rights literature. In denying that animals possess the psychological capacities to value freedom, Cochrane undermines the challenge to orthodox rights theory that it is not only persons who should possess rights. For Hadley, [...] "only theories that have no truck with commonsense intuitions at all, like Bentham's, are really in a position to place humans and animals on a genuinely equal moral plain. The rest, arguably, are more or less disguised versions of the person-centred orthodoxy masked by rhetorical appeals to cross-species equality." [...] Hadley denies that this tension undermines Cochrane's overall argument, writing that it [...] "ought to give no comfort to opponents of animal rights. [...] reasoning, <b>assuming</b> <b>you</b> accept animals matter at all, is as uncontroversial as his writing is accessible." ...|$|E
