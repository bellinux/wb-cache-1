5|$|Australian {{demographic}} trends {{will put}} pressure on the ADF in the future. Excluding other factors, the <b>ageing</b> of the Australian population will result in smaller numbers of potential recruits entering the Australian labour market each year. Some predictions are that population <b>ageing</b> will result in slower economic growth and increased government expenditure on pensions and health programs. As a result of these trends, the <b>ageing</b> of Australia's population may worsen the ADF's manpower situation and may force the Government to reallocate some of the Defence budget. Relatively few young Australians consider joining the military and the ADF has to compete for recruits against private sector firms which are able to offer higher salaries.|$|E
