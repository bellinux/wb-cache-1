The sea cucumbers were acclimated in three aquariums (90  ×  75  ×  60  cm) in Dalian Ocean University, Key Laboratory of Mari-culture and Stock Enhancement in North China’s Sea, Ministry of Agriculture for 2  weeks. The tap water was dechlorinated and inflated before use in experiments by letting it stand for at least 24  h to allow the chlorine to evaporate from the water (O'Beirn et al. 1998). Low salinity level was achieved by reducing the salinity of sea-water 2  psu per day by adding freshwater. High salinity level added crude sea salt to reach the aimed salinity. Control animals were cultured at a salinity of 32  psu. One-half or two-thirds of the rearing water was changed daily and remain stable with aimed salinity during the acclimation period. The sediment (feces and uneaten food) were removed by siphon method. During the experiment, sea cucumbers were fed once per day, {{at the rate of}} 3 – 5 % wet weight with a laboratory made formulated diet (mix up a solution of proportional parts of Sargassum thunbergii, fish meal and sea mud).

The pellets fed to Atlantic Cod are mostly grain based, which are made of fish oil, bone meal, vitamins and minerals.2 Atlantic Cod have a superb 1 kg of feed to 1 kg of weight gain ratio.8 In some open water environments this ratio is even more efficient, because Cod will eat other small natural organisms in the water. Cod fish are actually carnivorous animals and will even eat each other if prevalent size ratios are available. However <b>aquatic</b> <b>farms</b> have recently been trying to turn Atlantic Cod's carnivorous diet to a more herbivorous one; as already done in chickens8 This would drastically lower the already low price of feed for future generations.|$|R

When typhoon attack Taiwan the disaster situation of the drown lower coastal area will depend on the tide level and the height of the tide level will depend on the location between the sun and the moon. When the sun is on the top side of the ground the tide level will be the highest and the drown disaster will be the most serious, in the opposite side the height of tide level will be the lowest and the disaster will be the lightest, in the flank side the situation will be between the both situation. In case of the worst situation, it will be with one misfortune coming after another. Owing to the past commonly used 1 -D inundation model has not satisfied necessary, also because the drown area and each drainageway is mutually to connect, it is necessary to make an drown analysis in view of integrative watershed. This research aimed at the problem which the past used 1 -D inundation model couldn't solve. The 2 -D inundation model (SOBEK) with real topographic condition and real rainfall condition and considering the tide influence was used to simulate the present situation and inundation. From the simulated inundation results, it found several improvement plans including the drainage and the capacities of the pumping stations. We can optimize the pumping capacity from the different ameliorative effects by judging economics and analysis. In this research after I analyzed the most serious situation, I used the most conservative condition to analyze the possible maximum drown area of the test area. According the real topographical condition to simulate by 2 -D SOBEK model, it can obtain more valuable information Compare to 1 -D model. 摘 要 台灣近數十年來因沿海地區淡水養殖業如雨後春筍般之開發，已導致區域性嚴重之地層下陷，並造成種種因淹水而產生災害。在颱洪來臨時沿海低地遭受淹水之情形會受潮位影響，而潮位則受月球與地球間位置之關係所左右：當月球在地球正上方時潮位到達最高點淹水情形最嚴重，當月球在地球側面時潮位到達最低點淹水情形最輕，當月球在地球正下方時潮位到達次高點淹水情形則居中。若處於最不利下之情形，自當遭到雪上加霜之災情。過去常用於分析淹水災情之一維淹水模式，因其估算淹水之面積及深度已無法滿足需求，且因淹水區域與各排水路互相連通，進行淹水傳播分析時實需針對集水區來做整體性分析。 本研究係針對以往一維淹水模式在模擬淹水時所無法解決之問題，利用SOBEK二維淹水模式配合實際之地文條件及實際降雨條件並考量潮汐影響進行現況淹水模擬。從現況淹水模擬之結果，進行抽水站的佈置及排水路的改善措施，並由不同抽水規模搭配出不同之改善效果，最後由最經濟且有效之分析值中擇定最佳之抽水量。 本研究經以最嚴重之情況進行分析，以最保守之狀況分析本試區可能之最大淹水面積。依據實際地形條件以SOBEK二維性淹水模式進行模擬之結果，可獲得較具價值之資訊。目 錄 摘要………………………………………………………………… Ⅳ Abstract…………………………………………………………… Ⅴ 目錄………………………………………………………………… Ⅵ 表目錄……………………………………………………………… Ⅷ 圖目錄……………………………………………………………… Ⅸ 壹、前言 一、研究緣起………………………………………………… 1 二、研究動機………………………………………………… 1 三、研究目的………………………………………………… 2 貳、前人研究 一、沿海低窪地區改善對策方面…………………………… 4 二、排水改善對策及抽水規模分析方面…………………… 7 三、水文方面………………………………………………… 9 四、SCS曲線值法方面……………………………………… 10 五、以往規劃情形…………………………………………… 10 參、研究材料與方法 一、研究材料………………………………………………… 13 （一）環境概述………………………………………… 13 （二）研究材料與軟硬體設備………………………… 17 二、研究流程與方法………………………………………… 18 （一）研究流程………………………………………… 18 （二）研究方法………………………………………… 19 肆、結果分析與討論 一、水文分析………………………………………………… 20 （一）水文測站………………………………………… 20 （二）暴雨頻率分析…………………………………… 22 （三）得子口溪流量分析……………………………… 27 （四）分析檢討………………………………………… 35 （五）與以往規劃成果比較檢討……………………… 35 （六）計畫流量之決定………………………………… 36 （七）排水出口之外水位……………………………… 37 二、現況淹水模擬分析……………………………………… 38 （一）理論背景………………………………………… 39 （二）邊界條件有四：………………………………… 41 （三）輸入、輸出方式………………………………… 41 （四）模擬成果………………………………………… 42 三、現況排水之通水能力分析……………………………… 43 四、抽水站配置……………………………………………… 46 五、成果分析………………………………………………… 48 伍、結論與建議 一、結論……………………………………………………… 51 二、建議……………………………………………………… 52 陸、參考文獻……………………………………………………… 53 表 目 錄 表 2. 1 各時期規劃成果整理表………………………………… 12 表 3. 1 計畫區域之地下水位近年觀測月平均水位統計表…… 17 表 4. 1 得子口溪集水區及鄰近雨量站概況表………………… 20 表 4. 2 得子口溪集水區月雨量及年雨量一覽表……………… 23 表 4. 3 得子口溪集水區歷年最大一日、二日暴雨量一覽表… 24 表 4. 4 得子口溪集水區一日及二日暴雨量頻率分析成果表… 25 表 4. 5 得子口溪集水區歷年規劃一日及二日暴雨量頻率分析 成果比較表……………………………………………… 25 表 4. 6 得子口溪各重現期與逕流係數對照表………………… 29 表 4. 7 得子口溪各控制點集水區特性及集流時間估算表…… 30 表 4. 8 不同土壤種類、地表覆蓋、耕作方式及與土地利用情 況之SCS曲線號碼（正常臨前水份情況Ⅱ，Ia= 0. 2 S） 32 表 4. 9 得子口溪之土地利用與SCS曲線號碼估算成果表…… 33 表 4. 10 得子口溪各種推算方法之洪峰流量比較表…………… 34 表 4. 11 得子口溪各種推算方法之洪峰比流量比較表………… 34 表 4. 12 得子口溪出口歷年洪峰流量分析比較表……………… 36 表 4. 13 得子口溪集水區採用洪峰流量表……………………… 37 表 4. 14 玉田、塭底及民權排水各重現期外水位情況表……… 37 表 4. 15 玉田、塭底及民權排水現況淹水情況表（ 2 年重現期） 43 表 4. 16 抽水機規模及配置相關數據表………………………… 47 表 4. 17 玉田、塭底及民權排水改善後各種抽水規模之淹水 擬分析表（ 2 年重現期）……………………………… 49 圖 目 錄 圖 1. 1 宜蘭縣玉田、塭底及民權排水集水區概況圖…………… 3 圖 3. 1 玉田、塭底及民權集水區地理位置圖…………………… 14 圖 3. 2 玉田、塭底及民權集水區排水系統圖…………………… 14 圖 3. 3 玉田、塭底及民權排水H-A曲線圖……………………… 15 圖 3. 4 礁溪地區地盤下陷歷年趨勢圖…………………………… 16 圖 3. 5 本研究之流程圖…………………………………………… 18 圖 4. 1 得子口溪集水區雨量站位置圖…………………………… 21 圖 4. 2 得子口溪集水區月雨量分配圖…………………………… 26 圖 4. 3 得子口溪集水區一日及二日暴雨頻率曲線圖…………… 26 圖 4. 4 SCS累積超滲降雨量與累積降雨量方程式之圖解圖…… 31 圖 4. 5 得子口溪出口 7 至 10 月大潮平均高低潮位曲線圖……… 38 圖 4. 6 SOBEK模式主畫面及個案管理介面視窗圖……………… 42 圖 4. 7 玉田、塭底及民權排水集水區現況地形分佈圖………… 44 圖 4. 8 玉田、塭底及民權排水集水區現況淹水情況(2 年重現期) 45 圖 4. 9 塭底、玉田抽水站平面位置圖…………………………… 46 圖 4. 10 塭底及玉田抽水站橫斷面示意圖………………………… 48 圖 4. 11 塭底及玉田抽水站正面示意圖…………………………… 48 圖 4. 12 本試區抽排規模與淹水體積(2 年重現期) 曲線圖……… 50 圖 4. 13 玉田、塭底及民權排水集水區抽排 12 cms淹水情況（ 2 年重現期）………………………………………………… 5...|$|E

If even 20 % {{of the more than}} 500, 000 ha of the world's existing tropical and sub-tropical brackishwater ponds were to stock at the relatively low density of 50, 000 fry/ha/year, it would take thousands of new hatcheries to produce the 25 billion fry required. The availability of artificially produced diets to replace cultured live food organisms would alleviate many of the problems currently limiting shrimp hatchery production by: (i) reducing the level of technical skill required to operate a hatchery; (ii) assuring a reliable supply of a nutritionally balanced larval feed; (iii) reducing sources of contamination and larval disease; and (iv) simplifying hatchery design and capital cost requirements, thereby facilitating small scale hatchery development. <b>Aquatic</b> <b>farms</b> has been working with the Mars Microencapsulation Research Group (MMRG) to develop techniques for adapting current shrimp hatchery technology and design so that MMRG feeds can be used in existing hatcheries as a live feed replacement.

40|$|The {{visual impact}} of {{aquaculture}} is a controversial issue {{and in some}} countries must be assessed prior to any new development. However, at present, there are no definitive, objective methods {{used to evaluate the}} potential visual impacts of new <b>aquatic</b> <b>farms</b> and therefore assessment is difficult for both developers and regulators. This study presents a GIS based methodology for use in the visual assessment of a potential new coastal fish farm development, focusing on both sea cages and the associated land based structures. The methodology has been applied to a case study area, the Western Isles located off the North West coast of Scotland, which already has an extensive aquaculture industry and significant potential for future growth. Using a two stage sequential modelling process, the methodology combines visual, seascape and landscape analysis within a GIS environment to produce spatial models indicating where there is the potential for new aquaculture development with minimal visual impact. The preliminary visual assessment model combines a series of Boolean viewsheds with landscape and seascape sensitivity models to assess the potential visibility across different user groups and the sensitivity of the area to visual change. The second stage focuses on an area identified from the preliminary model as having potential for development and then performs a more detailed analysis using a site specific proportional visual impact model. This model quantifies the impact by assessing the proportion of viewpoints from which the proposed development can actually be seen. Both stages of the modelling process provide valuable information and support for decision makers regarding the potential visual impacts of aquaculture...|$|R

Locating aquaculture offshore is one strategy that may help address some issues related to nearshore development. However, offshore production is nascent and distinctions between the types of <b>aquatic</b> <b>farming</b> may not be fully understood by the public-important for collaboration, research, and development. Here we evaluate and report, to our knowledge, the first multinational quantification of the relative sentiments and opinions of the public around distinct forms of aquaculture. Using thousands of newspaper headlines (Ntotal = 1, 596) from developed (no. countries = 26) and developing (42) nations, ranging over periods of 1984 to 2015, we found an expanding positive trend of general 'aquaculture' coverage, while 'marine' and 'offshore' appeared more negative. Overall, developing regions published proportionally more positive than negative headlines than developed countries. As case studies, government collected public comments (Ntotal = 1, 585) from the United States of America (USA) and New Zealand mirrored the media sentiments; offshore perception being particularly negative in the USA. We also found public sentiment may be influenced by local environmental disasters not directly related to aquaculture (e. g., oil spills). Both countries voiced concern over environmental impacts, but the concerns tended to be more generalized, rather than targeted issues. Two factors that could be inhibiting informed discussion and decisions about offshore aquaculture are lack of applicable knowledge and actual local development issues.

The isolates were Clostridium botulinum, Clostridium perferingense, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella, Shigella, Staphylococcus aureus and Vibrio parahemolyticus. C. botulinum type E was the most prevalent type of bacteria in the fisheries products, responsible for the most cases of botulinal food poisoning. The presence of coliforms and E. coli in the seafood was due to environmental pollution. Additionally, in the processed food, the contamination of potable water and poor handling of the products are the main sources. L. monocytogenes was isolated from fresh, frozen and processed food. The microorganism is able to grow in the refrigeration condition and multiply in the processed food. The temperature of cold smoking (20 - 30 ºC) cannot stop growing of Listeria. High prevalence of Salmonella in water and fisheries product was mainly because of the low environmental sanitation and various geographical conditions. However, Compost fertilizer and flowing of the swages through the farms were considered as the major source of contamination. S. aureus is not a typical microorganism of the fisheries farms but may contaminate them during the processing or in-appropriate handling of the products. V.

40|$|The {{overarching}} aim of {{this research}} was to improve understanding of the synergies and trade-offs between economic and domestic food security benefits associated export-oriented shrimp and prawn aquaculture in a fragile developing country environmental context. The research scope covers the entire ‘seafood system’ incorporating production, distribution, trading and consumption in the south-west coastal region under greater Khulna District, Bangladesh. The primary research objective was to understand causal factors in variation of seafood nutritional quality and health outcomes, exploring correlations with seafood consumption across a range of agro-ecological, <b>aquatic</b> <b>farming</b> systems and socio-economic conditions. The study also focused on differences in intra-household allocation with a special focus on adolescent girls, being amongst the most vulnerable members of society. These objectives necessitated a highly inter-disciplinary approach to understand complex interactions between biophysical aspects (e. g. where and which species are most effective in supplying essential nutrients) and the social norms of food allocation. Fieldwork was conducted in Satkhira, Khulna, and Bagerhat Districts of Khulna Province over 17 months during 2012 to 2015. Four villages across a peak-annual surface water salinity gradient; high saline (> 10 ppt), medium saline (> 5 < 10 ppt), low saline (< 5 ppt) and freshwater (< 0. 5 ppt) were selected for case-studies. The thesis begins with a literature review of the evolution of shrimp and prawn farming in Bangladesh and the wider region and identification of knowledge gaps. Research resolved from district to community to household level. Key informant (KI) interviews were used to establish well-being criteria (based on a range of 5 social and economic assets) at community level. In each community a census of households (n= 1082 households) were derived from the same interviews and KIs asked to ranked households on the established well-being criteria. Results were validated through a short interview of all the identified households (HH). This sample-frame provided the based for two concurrent survey efforts. Stratified-random selection of 160 HH on two well-being categories (better-off and worse-off) for ‘farm level’ analysis using a semi-structured questionnaire. Key topics included inputs/outputs characteristics, economic benefits and the fate of farmed products were evaluated. Another 240 households with single adolescent girls were selected from the same frame, again with randomized-stratified sampling based on well-being categories for ‘intra-household’ analysis. This resulted in selection of 60 HH per community consisting of 30 ‘better-off’ and 30 worse-off households (further analysis was conducted on a range of secondary sampling outcomes based on livelihood options, intra-household food distribution and <b>aquatic</b> <b>farming</b> assets). A 24 -hour food recall method, food frequency questionnaire, food photography and measuring cup sets were used to estimate individual members’ food consumption at the household level. Anthropometric measures (stunting, wasting, BMI, MUAC) and biomarkers (omega- 3 index in RBC and LC n- 3 PUFA/LC PUFA in whole blood cell) were used to assess food security outcomes of adolescent girls (n= 200 subject). In an entirely separate effort, samples of shrimp/prawn and fish polyculture species (57 species and 9 by-products, 1 live feed; n= 672) were collected from the major agro-ecologies (four saline gradients; HS, MS, LS and FW) and culture systems (extensive, semi-intensive, intensive, organic and pocket gher). At least 3 sites from each saline gradient (3 × 4 = 12 sites) were selected for sampling and pooled samples to represent all the culture system in the region. The major macro and micronutrients of the collected species were analysed and these datasets were used to know the nutritional distribution among the family members in household level study. Two aggregate indices of wealth (or well-being) and aquaculture were developed based on a range of quantitative (ordinal and interval) measures. Principle Component Analysis (PCA) was used to understand how aquaculture influences on wealth gain. Wealth index of the same social well-being did not differ among the agro-ecologies. However, the aquaculture index was varied in agro-ecologies. Most of the households (60 - 80...|$|R

40|$|In May 1987, a three-man {{team from}} the United Kingdom visited Bangladesh {{to carry out a}} review of the post-harvest {{fisheries}} sector and to identify projects for British aid. lt was decided that {{the first part of this}} assignment, the review of the postharvest sector, should be written up as an ODNRI publication and made available to all governmental and non-governmental institutions interested in fisheries development in Bangladesh, and to the public at large. This has resulted in the present report on the handling, processing and marketing of fish, and which is divided into the following sections: Section 2 : An analysis of the overall supply and demand for fish and shellfish in Bangladesh and for export. Section 3 : A discussion of the way fish is handled and marketed for domestic consumption, quantitative and qualitative losses, and marketing efficiency. The role of the Government and co-operatives in fish marketing is also discussed. Section 4 : A discussion of the way shrimp is handled and marketed for export, associated losses and attempts to establish a system of quality control. Section 5 : A discussion of the main constraints preventing improved handling, processing and marketing, and the type of measures needed to overcome them. The information required in the preparation of this report was obtained from two sources: (a) past reports and publications, and (b) a programme of field visits in the following towns: Dhaka, Narayanganj, Khulna, Chittagong, Cox's Bazar, Sylhet, Sunamgonj and Habiganj. The authors were surpris~d at the amount of valuable information contained in past reports and which it is hoped to make more widely known through the present publication. One report of particular note was a PhD thesis by Ahmed (1983), containing a detailed investigation of the efficiency of domestic fish marketing. Apart from this a publication of the Bay of Bengal Programme provided useful information on the small-scale marine fisheries (FAO Bay of Bengal Programme, 1985), reports by DANIDA (1984 a, 1984 b) gave in-depth descriptions of marketing in Barisal and Chittagong, while an ADB report (<b>Aquatic</b> <b>Farms</b> Ltd., 1986) provided a valuable review of the shrimp industry...|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} {{approach}} this issue from a theoretical side, this paper considers a new simple and deterministic, but nontrivial optimal stopping (starting) problem [2, 11] on management of <b>farmed</b> <b>aquatic</b> organisms in an aquaculture system. The goal {{of the problem is}} finding an economically optimal opening time of harvesting farmed fishery resources, after which they are harvested with a known intensity and sold. The problem reduces to finding a solution (the optimal opening time) to differential equations whose behavior can be analytically resolved. This paper presents a sufficient condition for unique existence of an internal solution, its comparative statics, and a real application focusing on a current Japanese aquaculture system.|$|R

40|$|In {{spite of}} all the debates and controversies, a global {{consensus}} has been reached that climate change is a reality and that it will impact, in diverse manifestations that may include increased global temperature, sea level rise, more frequent occurrence of extreme weather events, change in weather patterns, etc., on food production systems, global biodiversity and overall human well being. Aquaculture is no exception. The sector is characterized {{by the fact that the}} organisms cultured, the most diverse of all farming systems and in the number of taxa farmed, are all poikilotherms. It occurs in fresh, brackish and marine waters, and in all climatic regimes from temperate to tropical. Consequently, there are bound to be many direct impacts on <b>aquatic</b> <b>farming</b> systems brought about by climate change. The situation is further exacerbated by the fact that certain aquaculture systems are dependent, to varying degrees, on products such as fishmeal and fish oil, which are derived from wild-caught resources that are subjected to reduction processes. All of the above factors will impact on aquaculture in the decades to come and accordingly, the <b>aquatic</b> <b>farming</b> systems will begin to encounter new challenges to maintain sustainability and continue to contribute to the human food basket. The challenges will vary significantly between climatic regimes. In the tropics, the main challenges will be to those farming activities that occur in deltaic regions, which also happen to be hubs of aquaculture activity, such as in the Mekong and Red River deltas in Viet Nam and the Ganges-Brahamaputra Delta in Bangladesh. Aquaculture in tropical deltaic areas will be mostly impacted by sea level rise, and hence increased saline water intrusion and reduced water flows, among others. Elsewhere in the tropics, inland cage culture and other aquaculture activities could be impacted by extreme weather conditions, increased upwelling of deoxygenated waters in reservoirs, etc., requiring greater vigilance and monitoring, and even perhaps readiness to move operations to more conducive areas in a waterbody. Indirect impacts of climate change on tropical aquaculture could be manifold but are perhaps largely unknown. The reproductive cycles of a great majority of tropical species are dependent on monsoonal rain patterns, which are predicted to change. Consequently, irrespective of whether cultured species are artificially propagated or not, changes in reproductive cycles will impact on seed production and thereby the whole grow-out cycle and modus operandi of farm activities. Equally, such impacts will be felt on the culture of those species that are based on natural spat collection, such as that of many cultured molluscs. In the temperate region, global warming could raise temperatures to the upper tolerance limits of some cultured species, thereby making such culture systems vulnerable to high temperatures. New or hitherto non-pathogenic organisms may become virulent with increases in water temperature, confronting the sector with new, hitherto unmanifested and/or little known diseases. One of the most important indirect effects of climate change will be driven by impacts on production of those fish species that are used for reduction, and which in turn form the basis for aquaculture feeds, particularly for carnivorous species. These indirect effects are likely to have a major impact on some key aquaculture practices in all climatic regimes. Limitations of supplies of fishmeal and fish oil and resulting exorbitant price hikes of these commodities will lead to more innovative and pragmatic solutions on ingredient substitution for aquatic feeds, which perhaps will be a positive result arising from a dire need to sustain a major sector. Aquaculture has to be proactive and start addressing the need for adaptive and mitigative measures. Such measures will entail both technological and socio-economic approaches. The latter will be more applicable to small-scale farmers, who happen to be the great bulk of producers in developing countries, which in turn constitute the “backbone’ of global aquaculture. The sociological approaches will entail the challenge of addressing the potential climate change impacts on small farming communities in the most vulnerable areas, such as in deltaic regions, weighing the most feasible adaptive options and bringing about the policy changes required to implement these adaptive measures economically and effectively. Global food habits have changed over the years. We are currently in an era where food safety and quality, backed up by ecolabelling, are paramount; it was not so 20 years ago. In the foreseeable future, we will move into an era where consumer consciousness will demand that farmed foods of every form will have to include in their labeled products the green house gas (GHG) emissions per unit of produce. Clearly, aquaculture offers an opportunity to meet these aspirations. Considering that about 70 percent of all finfish and almost 100 percent of all molluscs and seaweeds are minimally GHG emitting, it is possible to drive aquaculture as the most GHG-friendly food source. The sector could conform to such demands and continue to meet the need for an increasing global food fish supply. However, to achieve this, a paradigm shift in our seafood consumption preferences will be needed...|$|R
