I just flew up there to New York, went in the studio with her. I flew right out and went back on the road. When I do a song with people, I like to really get in the studio with them so I could feel they swag and they could feel mine. The music comes out better.|$|E

MTV rated Skins [...] "TV-MA", meaning the show is not suitable for audiences under 17. The Los Angeles Times responded in an editorial: [...] "...looking for government remedies is ineffective and unwise; we suspect the network's editors <b>are</b> <b>smart</b> enough to skirt prosecution. The Federal Communications Commission doesn't regulate the content of cable networks, {{and even if it}} did, a crackdown on shows like [...] "Skins" [...] would be a bad idea, because adults should be able to watch whatever they like on cable and federal attempts to protect kids from adult programming have never been successful." ...|$|E

Sandy, Chris, Doug, and Rex, you inspire all of us to dare to live our dreams—to know that we <b>are</b> <b>smart</b> enough and strong enough to achieve this. This song is especially for my girl Sandy and all the women who have taken us to space with them, and the girls who are our future explorers."

500|$|Pitchfork called Madvillainy [...] "inexhaustibly brilliant, with layer-upon-layer of {{carefully}} considered yet immediate hip-hop, forward-thinking but always {{close to its}} roots", noting that [...] "the samples <b>are</b> <b>smart</b> and never played-out, and the production and rhymes reveal a determined sense of cooperation, as MF Doom spouts off his most brilliant lyrical change-ups and production-conscious playoffs". Q called Madlib [...] "the most innovative beatsman since Prince Paul", who created [...] "an oddball, cartoon-heavy backdrop for MF Doom's mellifluous wordplay". Rolling Stone gave Madvillainy praised Madlib's tracks, [...] "fuzzy and crackling with dust", and MF DOOM, whose flow is [...] "a particularly elegant slur, with syllables speading over a beat, not crisply adhering to it". Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine called it [...] "a chameleonic masterpiece that alone validates the artistry of sampler culture". Robert Christgau, writing for The Village Voice, praised the album as [...] "a glorious phantasmagoria of flow". Blenders Jody Rosen called it a [...] "torrid album that marries old-school rap aesthetics to punk-rock concision." ...|$|E
500|$|Bloomberg View {{columnist}} William Pesek said: [...] "Japan's {{corporate culture}} of denial, of ignoring problems {{and letting them}} fester, keeps running up against a globalized world that values agility, innovation and transparency.

[...] While he also observed that {{the independence of the}} directors was inadequate, he said Japanese executives were much more moderately paid compared to American ones. [...] "Shareholders assume directors <b>are</b> <b>smart,</b> devoted people working for the good of Japan Inc. Tough questions are rarely asked." [...] Errol Oh of The Star said a company apology for a fall in the share price [...] "trivialises the possible wrongdoings and misplaces emphasis on an effect rather than the cause ... Takayama's remark on the 'inconvenience' of a fall in share price reflects a common flaw in the mindset of the people who run listed companies. Somehow, they {{lose sight of the fact}} that they manage businesses, not share prices." ...|$|E

500|$|Outliers has two parts: [...] "Part One: Opportunity" [...] {{contains}} five chapters, and [...] "Part Two: Legacy" [...] has four. The {{book also}} contains an Introduction and Epilogue. Focusing on outliers, defined by Gladwell {{as people who}} do not fit into our normal understanding of achievement, Outliers deals with exceptional people, especially those who <b>are</b> <b>smart,</b> rich, and successful, and those who operate at the extreme outer edge of what is statistically plausible. The book offers examples that include the musical ensemble The Beatles, Microsoft's co-founder Bill Gates, and the theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer. In the introduction, Gladwell lays out the purpose of Outliers: [...] "It's not enough to ask what successful people are like. [...] It is only by asking where they are from that we can unravel the logic behind who succeeds and who doesn't." [...] Throughout the publication, he discusses how family, culture, and friendship each play a role in an individual's success, and he constantly asks whether successful people deserve the praise that we give them.|$|E
500|$|As {{confirmed}} in January 2014, a new court show conceived by Sheindlin titled Hot Bench debuted on September 15, 2014. The courtroom series features {{a panel of}} three judges debating and deciding on cases brought to their TV courtroom. Stated Sheindlin, [...] "When my husband Jerry and I were in Ireland recently, we visited the courts and watched a three judge bench, which I found both fascinating and compelling. I immediately thought what a terrific and unique idea for a television program that brings the court genre to the next level. We have assembled three individuals with extremely varied backgrounds {{to serve as the}} judges. They <b>are</b> <b>smart</b> and talented, with terrific instincts and great chemistry, and are sure to create a hot bench." [...] The panel of judges consist of New York State Supreme Court judge Patricia DiMango, and Los Angeles attorneys Tanya Acker and Larry Bakman. As with Judge Judy, Hot Bench is executive-produced by Randy Douthit, and produced by CBS Television Distribution. It {{is important to note that}} Sheindlin originally desired the title of her personal courtroom series to be [...] "Hot Bench" [...] before producers ultimately settled on [...] "Judge Judy." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Q magazine, Like a Virgin was {{the album}} that [...] "propelled [...] into the {{stratosphere}} – and rightly so. The songs <b>are</b> <b>smart,</b> funny, sexy and irresistible." [...] Taraborrelli said, [...] "It was Like a Virgin which reflected Madonna as a more versatile and artistic performer and vocals on this album being reflectively sharper in contrast to her early works in the music industry." [...] Michael Paoletta from Billboard commented that the songs on the album sustain a [...] "fevered dance-rock momentum". Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic commented, [...] "Overall, the album adds up to less {{than the sum of}} its parts—partially because the singles are so good, but also because on the first album, she stunned with style and a certain joy. Here, the calculation is apparent, and while that's part of Madonna's essence—even something that makes her fun—it throws the record's balance off a little too much for it to be consistent, even if it justifiably made her a star." [...] Debby Miller from Rolling Stone preferred Madonna's debut album over Like a Virgin. In The Village Voice, Robert Christgau was also lukewarm towards the record, writing [...] " [...] so sure of herself she's asking men and women both to get the hots for the calculating bitch who sells the fantasy even while she bids for the sincerity market where long-term superstars ply their trade. And to make the music less mechanical, she's hired Nile Rodgers, who I won't blame for making it less catchy." ...|$|E

500|$|A femme fatale, Kim {{was among}} several fictional {{characters}} and pop culture icons to debut towards the [...] "end of the 'Girl Power' era" [...] and third-wave feminism. Thus, some critics perceive the character {{as a combination}} of Buffy Summers from Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Sydney Bristow from Alias, and The Powerpuff Girls. As an animated series, Kim Possible was revolutionary for its diverse cast of strong female characters, namely Kim and Shego. Many of the character's typically [...] "girly" [...] belongings double as powerful weapons, namely her lip gloss and compact mirror. In his book Dangerous Curves: Action Heroines, Gender, Fetishism, and Popular Culture, author Jeffrey A. Brown believes that [...] "Kim may be the epitome of a Girl Power-derived heroine", while reinforcing [...] "that {{there is a lot}} to be learned from female elders." [...] Like Kim herself, her grandmother Nana Possible also fought crime when she was young, from whom Kim is believed to have inherited her abilities. Kim's entire family is very intelligent, and constantly reiterate the phrase [...] "anything is possible for a Possible". Therefore, the character is spared [...] "the burden of being the only brain on the show." [...] The character's relationship with her parents is atypically healthy for a teenager. Kim's father James [...] "views women as equals", and thus has a good relationship with Kim although he struggles to come to terms with the reality that she is growing up and dating. Her mother Ann is essentially a [...] "grown up" [...] version of Kim. At one point, Ann insists that Kim invite her on one of her missions as her Mother's Day present, and Kim also admits to being impressed by her mother's work as a brain surgeon. The Artifice observed that Kim and Shego are strikingly similar in appearance. Metacritc believes that Shego is essentially [...] "Kim's dark reflection"; both characters <b>are</b> <b>smart,</b> athletic and attractive with green eyes, but Shego chooses to use her powers for evil instead. Despite their bitter rivalry, Kim and Shego have mutual respect for each other to the point of which they occasionally work together when the situation demands it. According to Metacritic, Kim's [...] "fiery" [...] red hair symbolizes [...] "her attitude that is best summed up by the phrase, 'I can do anything.'" [...] The character is infamous for her puppy dog pout, which she often uses to get her way.|$|E

2500|$|Although many {{authors of}} expository writing show a {{predisposition}} to capitalizing the initials {{of the expansion}} for pedagogical emphasis (trying to thrust the reader's attention toward where the letters are coming from), this sometimes conflicts with the convention of English orthography, which reserves capitals {{in the middle of}} sentences for proper nouns.

The justification is that (1) readers <b>are</b> <b>smart</b> enough to figure out where the letters came from, even without their being capitalized for emphasis, and that (2) common nouns do not take capital initials in standard English orthography.

2500|$|Ratings for Smallvilles {{second season}} were up 23% {{from the same}} point last year. It also surpassed 7th Heaven as The WB's most popular show. Gough {{contributes}} much of the second season's success to the family dynamic between Clark and his parents, whose emotional core provided {{a large part of}} the appeal, as was the move away from the overused [...] "freak of the week" [...] story lines. Gough stated, [...] "Most of the time (on TV), the kids <b>are</b> <b>smart,</b> the parents are clueless and they never talk to each other. Ours is the antithesis of that. He turns to them and relies on their guidance." [...] Smallvilles adjustment proved successful, as the second season averaged 6.3 million viewers, up from 5.9 million viewers in season one. That was also a move to #113 overall in the Nielsen ratings, up from #115 the year before.

[...] Ryan felt Lexa [...] "does not suffer fools gladly, yet Debnam-Carey made Lexa's vulnerability and her attraction to Clarke Griffin (Eliza Taylor) not just believable, but engrossing." [...] Linda Ge of TheWrap referred to her as a fan-favorite, while Eric Goldman of IGN called her [...] "a standout, highly popular character". The staff for SheWired stated that she [...] "had the best character introduction ever and never stopped being great" [...] and [...] "has proven to be endlessly engaging, even when she's making choices that make us want to crawl into a ball and cry."
