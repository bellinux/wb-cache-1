Amy's unstable upbringing in children's homes and foster care has impacted on her persona. She is a troubled character and protects herself by creating a hard exterior. Amy's biggest fear is embarrassment and she aspires to lead a normal family life with her foster parents Val and Eric Pollard. As her storylines have developed she has grown close to the pair, yet rebelled at various stages.

5|$|Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey), {{having found}} a {{loophole}} in her parenting contract with Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) which permits him to develop romantic feelings for her, attempts to attract him. She uses another technicality {{in the contract}} {{to force him to}} take her to Andy's play as a date, <b>and</b> <b>wears</b> uncharacteristically revealing clothing. But when Dwight becomes lustful, Angela rebuffs him and insists that they count the date as one of their five required instances of sexual intercourse. Meanwhile, Andy and Erin chat backstage, and Erin states how happy she is that they are spending time together outside of the Office. However, Erin's boyfriend calls and she leaves to meet him. As Andy sulks backstage, his co-workers arrive and cheer him up.|$|E
5|$|Takamatsu is {{an honor}} student who has a polite {{personality}} <b>and</b> <b>wears</b> glasses.

Though appearing to be slender, he works out and is actually well-built muscle-wise. After he first reveals this, he tends to take his shirt off, much to everyone's discomfort. He is absorbed by a shadow and is turned into an NPC. However, having strong enough feelings (according to Yuri), he is able to regain his senses and manages to disappear like the others. He carries a Desert Eagle as a side-arm, but is also seen using a Sig 552.|$|E
5|$|The Dhyana Mantra of Raja-matangi {{from the}} Purashcharyarnava {{describes}} Matangi as green in colour with the crescent moon upon her forehead.

She perspires a little around the face, which renders {{her even more}} beautiful. Below her navel are three horizontal folds of skin and a thin vertical line of fine hair. Seated on an altar and flanked by two parrots, she represents the 64 arts.

40|$|The basic {{concepts}} {{associated with the}} friction <b>and</b> <b>wear</b> of materials are discussed {{as they relate to}} ceramics. Properties of ceramics such as crystal structure, crystallographic orientation, mechanical deformation and surface chemistry are reviewed as they influence friction <b>and</b> <b>wear.</b> Both adhesive <b>and</b> abrasive <b>wear</b> of ceramics are discussed. The friction <b>and</b> <b>wear</b> of ceramics are examined in contact with themselves and when in contact with metals. The influences of environmental constituents such as water and hydrocarbons on friction <b>and</b> <b>wear</b> are reviewed. Materials discussed, by way of example, include aluminum oxide, rutile, calcium fluoride, and lithium fluoride...|$|R
40|$|The {{friction}} <b>and</b> <b>wear</b> {{properties of}} 201 HT aluminum alloys {{and the corresponding}} competitive coupons were tested on an electrohydraulic servo face friction <b>and</b> <b>wear</b> testing machine (MM-U 10 G). The microstructures of the competitive coupons were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and consequently the corresponding friction <b>and</b> <b>wear</b> mechanisms were studied. The results demonstrated that: (1) the best competitive material of friction <b>and</b> <b>wear</b> performance of the 201 HT was the 201 HTC. (2) the 201 HTC modified by carbon following the initial mill for oil storage of the micro-groove to be produced, increased the corresponding lubrication performance reduced the friction coefficient <b>and</b> <b>wear</b> rate effectively. (3) the 201 HT- 201 HTC could obtain both better friction <b>and</b> <b>wear</b> mainly due to the initial process of grinding following the 201 HT plastic deformation occurred in the surface {{and the formation of}} a series of re-melting welding points, whereas the 201 HT material hardness would be similar to the 201 HTC material hardness, which led into the competitive material friction <b>and</b> <b>wear</b> performance improvement...|$|R

5|$|The grandsons are {{depicted}} {{in very different}} styles: Alessandro acts in a formal manner <b>and</b> <b>wears</b> clothes of similar colour and tones to Paul. Ottavio, by contrast, wears the browns of the upper right-hand passage, {{an area of the}} painting that cuts him physically from the pope. His pose is awkward and difficult to interpret, but he is rendered in a more naturalistic manner than his brother. Alessandro has a distracted, brooding expression. He holds the knob of Paul's backrest, in an echo of Raphael's portrait where Clement VII holds the chair of Leo X as an indicator of his ambitions of succession. Thus Alessandro seems better placed politically, standing to Paul's right in a pose that recalls traditional depictions of Paul the Apostle, and his hand is raised as if in blessing. In the end, Paul was unable to influence his succession after Charles V weakened the Medici hold on the office.|$|E
5|$|The intergiro {{classification}} {{was marked}} by a blue jersey. The calculation for the intergiro {{is similar to that}} of the general classification, in each stage there is a midway point that the riders pass through a point and where their time is stopped. As the race goes on, their times compiled and the person with the lowest time is the leader of the intergiro classification <b>and</b> <b>wears</b> the blue jersey. Although no jersey was awarded, there was also one classification for the teams, in which the stage finish times of the best three cyclists per team were added; the leading team was the one with the lowest total time.|$|E
5|$|The {{portrait}} {{represents a}} man, estimated {{by some to}} be 45years of age, standing turned to the viewer's right, looking at the viewer with a commanding expression. In his uplifted right hand he holds a baton with a golden cap. He has a thick moustache <b>and</b> <b>wears</b> a high fur cap on which there is a golden chain with precious stones and a coat of arms in the center. From his ear a large pear-shaped pearl hangs from a golden pendant earring. He wears a reddish-brown mantle with a broad fur collar and, over it, a heavy gold chain from which the order of three horse tails, set in rich pendants, hangs on his right shoulder. A full light from the left falls {{on the right side of}} his face. The background is brownish-grey.|$|E
