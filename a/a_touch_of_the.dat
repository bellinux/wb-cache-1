25|$|The cornea has unmyelinated {{nerve endings}} {{sensitive}} to touch, temperature and chemicals; <b>a</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cornea causes an involuntary reflex {{to close the}} eyelid. Because transparency is of prime importance, the cornea does not have blood vessels. Instead, oxygen dissolves in tears and then diffuses throughout the cornea to keep it healthy. Similarly, nutrients are transported via diffusion from the tear fluid through the outside surface and the aqueous humour through the inside surface, and also from neurotrophins supplied by nerve fibres that innervate it. In humans, the cornea has a diameter of about 11.5mm and a thickness of 0.5–0.6mm {{in the center and}} 0.6–0.8mm at the periphery. Transparency, avascularity, the presence of immature resident immune cells, and immunologic privilege makes the cornea a very special tissue.|$|E

25|$|After {{suffering}} from multiple health problems (including depression and alcoholism) over many years, O'Neill ultimately faced a severe Parkinsons-like tremor {{in his hands}} which {{made it impossible for}} him to write during the last 10 years of his life; he had tried using dictation but found himself unable to compose in that way. While at Tao House, O’Neill had intended to write a cycle of 11 plays chronicling an American family since the 1800s. Only two of these, <b>A</b> <b>Touch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Poet and More Stately Mansions, were ever completed. As his health worsened, O’Neill lost inspiration for the project and wrote three largely autobiographical plays, The Iceman Cometh, Long Day's Journey into Night, and A Moon for the Misbegotten. He managed to complete Moon for the Misbegotten in 1943, just before leaving Tao House and losing his ability to write. Drafts of many other uncompleted plays were destroyed by Carlotta at Eugene’s request.|$|E

[...] The ceremony has caused difficulties for privy counsellors who advocate republicanism; Tony Benn said in his diaries that he kissed his own thumb, rather than the Queen's hand, while Jeremy Corbyn reportedly did not kneel.

[...] St. Leger recorded on August 21 that [...] "Arnold was advancing, by rapid and forced marches, with 3,000 men", and the Indians of St. Leger's expedition, who made up the majority of his force, abandoned the siege the next day. [...] As a result, St. Leger lifted the siege and began the journey back to Montreal. [...] Arnold did march to Stanwix, arriving after St. Leger had left; detachments sent by Arnold to chase after him spotted his boats on Lake Oneida.|$|E
