40|$|AbstractSelf-similar {{solutions}} are obtained for unsteady, one-dimensional isothermal flow behind a shock wave in a rotational axisymmetric non-ideal {{gas in the}} presence of an <b>azimuthal</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field.</b> The shock wave is driven out by a piston moving with time according to power law. The fluid velocities and the <b>azimuthal</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> in the ambient medium are assumed to be varying and obeying a power law. The density of the ambient medium is assumed to be constant. The gas is assumed to be non-ideal having infinite electrical conductivity and the angular velocity of the ambient medium is assumed to be decreasing as the distance from the axis increases. It is expected that such an angular velocity may occur in the atmospheres of rotating planets and stars. The effects of the non-idealness of the gas and the Alfven-Mach number on the flow-field are obtained. It is shown that the presence of <b>azimuthal</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> and the rotation of the medium has decaying effect on the shock wave.

40|$|We {{consider}} the gravitational stability of a current carrying filamentary {{cloud in the}} presence of both axial and azimuthal magnetic fields using a simple analytic model. The <b>azimuthal</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> is shown to give rise to a new contribution, dictated by Ampere's law, in the corresponding virial equation for magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium. From this we obtain a computationally inexpensive guidance on the gravitational stability of current carrying filamentary clouds. The approach not only provides a fresh insight into the essential physical mechanisms involved, but also demonstrates clearly that, for sufficiently large and yet astronomically realistic currents, the <b>azimuthal</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> can cause filamentary clouds to undergo instability.
