50|$|The {{system also}} had an <b>administrative</b> <b>processor</b> (based on a Motorola 68000) that loaded the {{microcode}} from an 8&Prime; floppy disk when the system was started. It was also able to run a suite of diagnostics over the system. It had a modem which allowed remote analysis by the manufacturer. The software run by the <b>administrative</b> <b>processor</b> was initially called the Totally Unrealistic Remote Diagnostic. This name was changed some years later.|$|E
40|$|Government of Indiaâ€™s Centre for Development of Telematics (C-DOT) has {{developed}} a modular, distributed telephone switching system. There is an ongoing effort to model, analyse, and optimise the teletraffic performance of this switching system. In this paper we report the methodology and results of {{a part of this}} work. We use analytical queuing models to estimate the capacities of the <b>Administrative</b> <b>Processor,</b> and the Space Switch Controller. We formulate the system overload control problem as a constrained optimisation problem, solve the problem, and use simulations to evaluate various adaptive overload control algorithms...|$|E
40|$|It is {{now well}} {{recognised}} that modelling and performance analysis {{is an important}} and necessary part of the development cycle of any large telecommunication system. The authors demonstrate some of the techniques that are used, {{and the kinds of}} results that can be obtained, by describing a detailed performance analysis done for the Centre for Development of Telematics' Digital Switching System (C-DoT DSS). They used a simulation model to evaluate the performance of the Base Module (BM). This model yielded an estimate of BM capacity, helped to design and evaluate a new overload control, and showed how BM capacity can be improved by a scheduling change. They used analytical queuing models to estimate the capacities of the <b>Administrative</b> <b>Processor,</b> and the Space Switch Controller. They formulated the system overload control problem as a constrained optimisation problem, solved the problem, and used simulations to evaluate various adaptive overload control algorithms...|$|E
