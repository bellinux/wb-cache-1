50|$|Above the chapel, on {{the first}} floor, there is a study with an <b>armoured</b> <b>door.</b> This door {{consists}} firstly of strongly studded fir, together with a cast iron base, the whole to be opened with a single key. This part of the chapel stored the most valuable goods of the Arthauds.|$|E
50|$|The eastern complex {{consisted}} of five drifts angled at 50 degrees reaching 105 m below the hilltop. The five drifts exited the hilltop through a concrete slab 30 m wide and 5.5 m thick. Large steel plates protected the five openings and each drift {{had a special}} <b>armoured</b> <b>door.</b> Extensive tunnels and elevator shafts supported the guns and, if the site had become operational, about 1,000 troops from Artillerie Abteilung 705 and supporting units would have been deployed at Mimoyecques. Artillerie Abteilung 705 had been organised in January 1944 under Oberstleutnant Georg Borttscheller to operate the Wiese gun complex.|$|E
50|$|The tunnels were {{surrounded}} by barracks, personnel bunkers, and watchtowers. Other buildings were used for operations, administration, and maintenance. Inside each bomb-proof tunnel, there was a rail track and a platform. The tunnel portals were protected by two-wing <b>armoured</b> <b>doors</b> with firing embrasures for the guards. Purpose-built track connected the tunnels with the Rzeszów-Jasło railway.|$|R

50|$|The Ariete's main {{armament}} {{is a local}} {{version of}} the smoothbore Rheinmetall 120 mm gun, produced by Oto Melara, autofrettaged and stress-hardened to increase durability over extended periods of firing, allowing the use of APFSDS-T and HEAT ammunition. The gun is also adapted to fire most NATO-standard rounds of the same calibre. It carries 42 rounds, 27 of which are stored in a special magazine inside the hull, {{to the left of}} the driver's station. The remaining ammunition is stored in the rear turret bustle, separated from the crew compartment with an <b>armoured</b> <b>door.</b> The gun barrel has a thermal insulating sleeve and a fume extractor; it is fully stabilized in both azimuth and elevation by an electro-hydraulic drive system.|$|E
50|$|This armour {{scheme was}} {{designed}} to withstand 1,000 pound bombs (and heavier bombs which struck at an angle); in the Home and Mediterranean theatres it was likely that the carriers would operate {{within the range of}} shore-based aircraft, which could carry heavier bombs than their carrier-based equivalents. The flight deck had an armoured thickness of 3 inches, closed by 4.5-inch sides and bulkheads. There were 3-inch strakes on either side extending from the box sides to the top edge of the main side belt, which was of 4.5 inches. The main belt protected the machinery, petrol storage, magazines and aerial weapon stores. The lifts were placed outside the hangar, at either end, with access through sliding <b>armoured</b> <b>doors</b> in the end bulkheads.|$|R
50|$|The {{drive to}} recover scrap metal {{and a strong}} dislike of {{anything}} German in the islands saw the metalwork in the battery removed and scrapped from 1947 onwards, this included the <b>armoured</b> cover, <b>doors,</b> hoists, engines etc. with the barrels and mounts cut up in 1952/3.|$|R
25|$|The LCA's crew of four ratings {{included}} a Sternsheetsman, whose action station {{was at the}} stern to assist in lowering and raising the boat at the davits of the Landing Ship Infantry (LSI), a Bowman-gunner, whose action station was {{at the front of}} the boat to open and close the <b>armoured</b> <b>doors,</b> raise and lower the ramp, and operate the one or two Lewis guns in the armoured gun shelter opposite the steering position, a stoker-mechanic responsible for the engine compartment, and a Coxswain who sat in the armoured steering shelter forward on the starboard side. Though in control of the rudders, the coxswain did not have direct control of the engines and gave instructions to the stoker through voicepipe and telegraph. The craft relayed signals and orders to the other two craft in the group by signal flags in the earlier part of the war, but by 1944 many of the boats had been fitted with two-way radios.|$|R
2500|$|All {{landing craft}} designs (and landing ship designs for ships {{intended}} to beach) {{must find a}} compromise between two divergent priorities; the qualities that make a good sea boat are opposite those that make a craft suitable for beaching. The LCA keel was produced from Canadian rock elm which was treated with steam to make it pliable and then shaped using a keel block and wedges. Twenty-four mahogany latitudinal frame pieces were joined to the keel providing the overall structure. The craft had a hull built of double-diagonal mahogany planking. The sides were plated with [...] "10lb. DIHT" [...] armour, a heat treated steel based on D1 steel, in this case Hadfield's Resista ¼". Steps were taken {{to ensure that the}} boat would not sink when swamped. In the bow section between the <b>armoured</b> <b>doors</b> and the ramp, each bulkhead was packed with [...] of Onazote buoyant material. The same Onazote packing was placed along both hull sides for the length of the well, and [...] filled the aft compartment.|$|R
50|$|However, it was {{not long}} before the police came under attack with firearms; against which the cages and {{hardboard}} of the early Land Rovers provided no protection. Plates of ballistic steel were added to each side of the rear cargo bed and an <b>armoured</b> steel <b>door</b> was fitted to the rear. Whilst this provided a greater degree of protection from low velocity weapons, there were many areas of the vehicle which were still unprotected. The RUC realised that a fresh design was required to protect their officers.|$|R
50|$|Archer, Cowley & Co's Cantay Depositories {{furniture}} warehouse {{was designed}} by Tollit and built in 1901. Behind its decorative gabled red brick facade, Cantay Depositories has a steel frame and iron columns cast by William Lucy's Eagle Ironworks in Jericho, Oxford. As a warehouse the building had 3840 sq ft of storage space and was segregated into sections by <b>armoured,</b> fire-proof <b>doors</b> that would close automatically {{in the event of}} fire. Cantay House is now Oxford Conference Centre, a nightclub, and a retail store.|$|R
50|$|The cabin {{contains}} {{seating for}} driver and one passenger. Mine, ballistic and NBC protections are optional; the mine and ballistic protection can be also mounted afterwards. Cabin and engine mine protection is {{installed on the}} chassis under the cabin and {{on the floor in}} accordance with STANAG 4569 levels 3a and 3b against anti-tank mine blasts up to 6 kg. <b>Armoured</b> steel <b>doors</b> provide STANAG 4569 level 1 ballistic protection; levels 2 and 3 are reached with optional composite doors. The cabin is produced from Ruukki Ramor steel and fitted with pressurised NBC protection system.|$|R
2500|$|The palace {{is located}} in the village of Jedlinka (German: Tannhausen) [...] In 1943, it was {{purchased}} by the Nationalsozialistische Volkswohlfahrt (National Socialist People's Welfare) from the Böhm family {{as a result of their}} financial problems. At the beginning of 1944 the plans to transform it into a hospital were disrupted because the building was confiscated by military authorities and adapted as headquarters for the Schlesische IndustriegemeinschaftAG (Silesian Industrial Company). An air-raid shelter was created in the cellar with <b>armoured,</b> gasproof <b>doors.</b> The palace and the nearby town of Jedlina-Zdrój (German: Bad Charlottenbrunn) was established as general base of operations for Project Riese.|$|R

The craft relayed signals and orders to the other two craft in the group by signal flags in the earlier part of the war, but by 1944 many of the boats had been fitted with two-way radios.The sternsheetsman and bowman were to be available to take over from the coxswain or stoker should they be killed or injured. On longer journeys they might relieve them to rest. They also manned any additional machine guns and operated the kedge anchor, if it was required. In mine fields and among anti-invasion obstacles and rocks seaman would sit on the bow or stern or move about the sides of his boat piloting or preventing it from hitting the obstacles.|$|R
50|$|A {{disadvantage}} highlighted during {{combat in}} Chechnya was {{the vulnerability of}} the T-80BV to catastrophic explosion. The reason given by US and Russian experts is the vulnerability of stored semi-combustible propellant charges and missiles when contacted by the molten metal jet from the penetration of a HEAT warhead, causing the entire ammunition load to explode. This vulnerability may be addressed in later models. When Western tank designs changed from non-combustible propellant cartridges to semi-combustible, they tended to separate ammunition stowage from the crew compartment with <b>armoured</b> blast <b>doors,</b> and provided 'blow-out' panels to redirect the force and fire of exploding ammunition away from the crew compartment.|$|R

The Russian vector for development for future however is apparently to remove the crew from the turret altogether, this has been implemented with T-14 Armata which was revealed in 2015 Victory Day parade.|$|R
500|$|The drifts were angled at 50 degrees, {{reaching}} {{a depth of}} [...] Owing to technical problems with the gun prototype, {{the scope of the}} project was reduced; drifts I and II were abandoned at an early date and only III, IV and V were taken forward. They came to the surface at a concrete slab or Platte [...] wide and [...] thick, in which there were narrow openings to allow the projectiles to pass through. The openings in the slab were protected by large steel plates, and the railway tunnel entrances were further protected by <b>armoured</b> steel <b>doors.</b> Each drift was oriented on a bearing of 299°, to the nearest degree – a direct line on Westminster Bridge. Although the elevation and direction of the guns could not be changed, it would have been possible to alter the range by varying the amount of propellant used in each shot. This would have brought much of London within range.|$|R
50|$|After the {{assassination}} attempt on Reinhard Heydrich in Prague {{at the end}} of May 1942, the Reich Chancellery would only use armoured cars for ministers and leaders of friendly powers. Beside 20 large Mercedes-Benz 770s, in 1942 they ordered an additional 20 540Ks developed as two <b>door</b> <b>armoured</b> saloons. These were delivered during 1942 and 1943. A further order for 17 armored saloons was placed in late 1943, and these were delivered in April 1944. One of these cars was given as a gift from Adolf Hitler to Ante Pavelić, leader of the Independent State of Croatia. After the war this car was captured and used first by Ivan Krajacic, and then by Josip Broz Tito.|$|R
25|$|The crew {{enters the}} front {{compartment}} through two side doors. The driver {{sits on the}} right side of the vehicle while the vehicle commander sits on the left. Two additional hatches in the roof provide emergency exits for driver and commander. The gunner sits behind commander inside the weapon turret. The engine is located behind the driver, while the left side of the vehicle is fitted with weapon turret. All of the windows are bullet-proof and also further protected by armored shutters, which can be shut entirely, leaving a small observation slit for vision. An <b>armoured</b> hydraulic ramp <b>door</b> at the rear provide access to the troop compartment. Two inward-facing, benches provide seating for 5 troops each. Communications equipment include VHF / FM (anti-jamming and hopping) and GPS with night vision equipment included. Emergency exits are present on both sides of the Anoa as well as three roof hatches in the troop compartment with one rear-facing machine gun mounting on the right cupola. A video camera was also fitted at the rear of the vehicle to help driver while reversing the vehicle.|$|R
50|$|The {{result was}} the Hotspur Land Rover, named after the brand of armour plate made in Wales used in its construction. The chassis of a {{civilian}} Land Rover 109 station wagon was used. Underneath the standard aluminium roof a second roof, fabricated from armoured steel, was installed. This provided overhead protection from gunfire, petrol bombs and IEDs. Large plates of ballistic steel were bolted {{to the sides of}} the vehicle, which wrapped around the rear pillar and met with an <b>armoured</b> double <b>door.</b> Both of these doors and the side plates were fitted with sliding pistol ports, allowing the officers inside to return fire {{in the event of an}} ambush. The rear doors, sides and roof constituted an armoured box providing all round protection to the crew in the rear of the vehicle. For the protection of the driver and the front seat passenger, the windscreen and side windows were replaced with thick sheets of bulletproof glass, along with armour-plated doors. Finally, a fabricated (not expanded) metal grille could be pulled up over the windscreen to prevent the windscreen being broken by thrown objects during civil disorder, and the side windows covered with a sheet of transparent polycarbonate for the same purpose.The Hotspur was immediately put into action and worked admirably. Myriad modifications were carried out over the years, including lining the vehicles' lower panels with sheets of polycarbonate to prevent the body panels from being dented during civil disorder. Metal grilles and rubber skirts were fitted around the lower perimeter of the vehicle to prevent projectiles being thrown under the body at officers who were sheltering behind, and also to prevent beer kegs being rolled under the vehicle in an attempt to immobilise it.|$|R
