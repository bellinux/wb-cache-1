After the installation of a third-rail it began operations as a shuttle service. With the construction of connecting trackage at 180th Street, it commenced operations as the current IRT Dyre Avenue Line.|$|E

Stokes (October 10, 1815 – July 16, 1895), a Methodist minister from Philadelphia, and others joined together to purchase a square mile of land fronting on the Atlantic Ocean. A state charter was issued to the newly formed Ocean Grove Camp Meeting Association on March 3, 1870, granting the 26trustees (13ministers and 13lay persons) the <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> <b>purchase</b> and hold the one square mile of real estate comprising Ocean Grove, and to construct and maintain all necessary works to supply the town with utilities and other municipal services, including law enforcement.|$|E

25|$|The October 1956 Suez crisis brought {{relations}} between Britain and the United States {{to a low}} ebb. When Eisenhower met with the new Prime Minister, Harold Macmillan, in Bermuda in March 1957, he {{raised the possibility of}} basing US intermediate range ballistic missile (IRBM) systems in the UK. This came to be called Project Emily. There were also discussions on exchanging nuclear submarine propulsion technology for information on the British Calder Hall nuclear power plant, allowing the United Kingdom Atomic Energy <b>Authority</b> <b>to</b> <b>purchase</b> uranium ore from Canada, and coordinating the war plans of RAF Bomber Command with those of the Strategic Air Command. Although the IRBM negotiations pre-dated the Suez crisis, it suited the British government to tout the IRBM deal as a demonstration that the rift had been healed. Britain tested its first hydrogen bomb in the Operation Grapple test at Christmas Island on 15 May 1957. The Grapple tests were facilitated by the United States, which also claimed the island. Although the initial tests were unsuccessful, the Grapple X test on 8 November 1957 achieved the desired result.|$|E
