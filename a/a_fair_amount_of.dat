5|$|Aside {{from those}} found on Corythosaurus casuarius, {{extensive}} skin impressions {{have been found}} on Edmontosaurus annectens and notable integument has also been found on Brachylophosaurus canadensis, Gryposaurus notabilis, Parasaurolophus walkeri, Lambeosaurus magnicristatus, L. lambei, Saurolophus angustirsotris and on unidentified ornithopods. Of these, L. lambei, C. casuarius, G. notabilis, P. walkeri, and S. angustirsotris have preserved polygonal scales. The scales on L. lambei, S. angustirostris and C. casuarius are all similar. Corythosaurus is one of very few hadrosaurids which have preserved skin impressions on the hind limbs and feet. A study in 2013 showed that amongst hadrosaurids, Saurolophus angustirostris preserved {{the best and most}} complete foot and limb integument, although other species like S. osborni, Edmontosaurus annectens and Lambeosaurus lambei (= L. clavinitialis) share <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> preserved tissue on those regions.|$|E

5|$|Martensite {{has a lower}} density (it expands {{during the}} cooling) than does austenite, so that the {{transformation}} between them results in a change of volume.

5|$|About 8500 {{different}} marcoremains {{have been}} found in Lo Hueco. Sauropods make up the largest amount of the remains with many articulated individuals, caudal vertebrae and teeth. The caudal vertebrae have been identified as being from a titanosaur closely related to Lirainsaurus, but with some differences. The teeth, were assigned to Ampelosaurus atacis. Apart from sauropods, the Villalba de la Sierra Formation has a good representation of carbonized plants, mostly known from branches and leaves, and invertebrates, mostly bivalves and gastropods. Fishes from the formation include lepisosteid, which have plenty of material, and unidentified actinopterygians and teleosteans. Turtle fossils are very common, even more common than fishes. Of all this material, only two different groups have been identified, the bothremydids Polysternon and Rosasia, along with an uncommon undetermined Pancryptodiran. Squamate lizards are known only from a few undetermined specimens, and eusuchian crocodiles are known from a specimen with similarities to Allodaposuchus and Musturzabalsuchus. Ornithischias and theropod dinosaurs are not as common as sauropods but still consist of much material. Basal euornithopods and probable ankylosaurians are known from Lo Hueco. The ankylosaurian remains consist of a few vertebrae. Rhabdodon sp. is known from the formation, and is known from <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> elements.

5|$|The AI sets {{added to}} Beaufighters {{were the first}} to be mass-produced. The {{operating}} frequency was 190 to 195 MHz with a wavelength of 1.5 metres. The equipment consisted of a receiver, transmitter, control panel, modulator, indicator unit and a system of fixed dipole aerials. On the nose the aerial was a double arrowhead shape with a pair of azimuth aerials protruding above and below the leading edge of each wing between the cannon and the wingtip. A pair of elevation aerials were located above and below the wing surfaces near the RAF roundel on the starboard side. The indicator display consisted of two cathode ray tubes. They displayed elevation and azimuth bearing. The set had a range-limitation of four miles (circa 20,000 feet). The minimum range of detection was usually around 400 feet. At closer ranges the target merged with the transmission pulse and was obscured. At altitudes below 1,000 feet, the returns from ground objects would swamp the tubes. Operators like Rawnsley were left to do <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> guesswork. No scales or calibration markings were put on early sets. The position and heading of the enemy in the azimuth plane, its height, and its range had to be guessed. At least the GCI could bring the Beaufighter well within range of the target, usually a mile or so behind the bomber.|$|E
5|$|The case {{established}} {{the doctrine of}} fair abridgement, which allowed that abridgements displaying <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> labour {{on the part of}} the editor, and that differed from the original published work in a significant way, could not be copyright violations. This in effect raised the abridger to the level of an author. The decision did not define the exact parameters that would qualify a work as a valid abridgement. This distinction came with a later case involving an abridgement of Hawksworth's Voyages, in a decision written by Lord Chancellor Apsley. This concept of fair abridgement eventually evolved through common law, initiated from Gyles v Wilcox, into the current concept of fair use. Hardwicke's decision also added the exercise of personal judgement to the list of admissible defences against the charge of copyright infringement, adding to the growing case law establishing that British copyright would be based on labour and not on originality. The opinion advanced the position that copyright law should serve the public interest by promoting the creation of new educational and useful works, rather than focusing on publishing rights. The case played a significant role in the development of English copyright law. The United States federal courts have cited the case as recently as the 1980s.|$|E

30|$|This {{study reveals}} an {{effective}} process to recycle the Pb-free solders. The metals in industrial waste are often present as oxides rather than sulfides.

An increase in reaction time increased the leaching efficiency. The concentration of acetic acid greatly affects the leaching efficiency. The {{results suggest that the}} low concentrations of acetic acid are also effective for metal dissolution. The use of high temperature is not favorable for metal leaching process since the loss of acetic acid volume occurs at high temperatures. But this factor is beneficial for establishing an industrial process due to less demand for energy. Also, <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> good <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> metal leaching was achieved at high pulp densities.|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} disciplinary practices of Anglo-Saxon {{studies and the}} modes of operation it has practiced as a modern, technical academic discipline, and analyzes these in terms of recent philosophical developments in critical theory of technology. It shows Anglo-Saxon studies has become a self-isolating field, and applies critical theory of technology {{as a means of}} addressing the field 2 ̆ 7 s conception of its focus, audiences, and purposes. Thanks to the work of J. R. R. Tolkien and a generation of science-fiction and fantasy literature, Anglo-Saxon studies holds <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> <b>of</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> popular interest in western cultures. Yet this interest is largely escapist, and thus is as far from applied as possible. In addition, the modern and technological functioning of the field of Anglo-Saxon studies works to wall off the field from social and political connection. Indeed the modern philosophical epistemology broadly accepted in the field deems all political involvement contaminating. In response post-modern philosophy has suggested that the latter position is itself political, and thus we cannot be apolitical. Therefore the approaches that have effectively critiqued the continuing development of our technological world can be brought to bear {{on the development of the}} field of Anglo-Saxon studies. Chapter One explains this problem as explained by Allen Frantzen but develops and connects it to the issues of technological development more broadly. Chapter Two explores and explains Andrew Feenberg 2 ̆ 7 s Critical Theory of Technology and its relationships to Anglo-Saxon studies. Chapter Three examines some of the practices of research in Anglo-Saxon studies and shows how socio-technical forces effect practice, and suggests ways scholars are working at these problems, but how we still can go further. Chapter Four suggests ways we can apply the perspective developed in the preceding chapters to teaching and researching Beowulf. ...|$|R

The Hepatics have not been neglected, but their variability and the exceptional richness of form found in Tasmania have made their study more obscure.

Still, we can safely say that the hepatic flora of Tasmania approaches three hundred, which means it is almost the richest in species of any locality in the world. Of the following mosses the Andreaeas would by some collectors be clubbed with A. petrophila, but then they would have to be treated as varieties. A. petrophila is most variable, and it is certainly desirable that prominence should be given to the principal forms. Blindid acuta was recorded as Tasmanian by J. D. Hooker. It is a European species, and as no specimen was present in any available collection it was left out of the previous work.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{addresses}} {{issues related}} to the regulation of the delivery of mental health services. The focus is primarily on regulations that are aimed at dealing with the consequences of imperfect information in the marketplace. The paper reviews and assesses what is known about the impact of regulations on efficiency and equity. One conclusion is that we know <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> <b>amount</b> about impacts <b>of</b> regulation on prices for mental health service and very little about effects on quality of care. A research agenda is proposed based on the knowledge available in 1988. There is a long tradition of regulation and government control in the mental health sector, originating in the central role played by the asylum in the mental health delivery system. This type of control arose because the mentally ill are a particularly vulnerable population. Although dependence and the availability of information vary by type of illness, many mentally ill persons cannot successfully decide for themselves the value of treatment alternatives. They can thus easily be exploited by institutions that arise to assist them in obtaining health care, pro-tection, and fulfillment of basic human needs (President’s Commission 1978) ...|$|R
