5|$|The video opens as {{the protagonist}} (Rihanna) shoots and kills a man while he walks through a busy train station. She flees before a {{flashback}} {{to the previous}} day, when she rides her bike, meets friends and is alone in a bedroom at dusk. At a nightclub the protagonist dances and flirts with another club-goer, who then attacks her when she leaves the club. Disheveled, the woman cries in the street after an implied sexual assault, and the video ends as she runs home to grab a gun hidden in <b>a</b> <b>dresser</b> drawer.|$|E

Phillip Freke (died 1729) is commemorated with a marble wall tablet {{in the north}} choir aisle. The oval wall tablet to Rowland Searchfield, English academic and Bishop of Bristol (died 1622) is made of slate. The Newton Chapel, which is between the Chapter House and south choir aisle contains a large dresser tomb of Henry Newton (died 1599) and a recumbent effigy of Sir John Newton (died 1661), as well as <b>a</b> <b>dresser</b> tomb dedicated to Sir Charles Vaughan who died in 1630.|$|E
5|$|The video, black-and-white, {{begins with}} Carey parking her antique {{automobile}} in desert. She gets out, with customized black boots with an 'M' on them, and as, she walks towards the camera, the vehicle explodes. As the music begins {{and the scene}} shifts to another where Carey applying her eye make-up and earrings. As a form of product placement, her fragrance is shown on <b>a</b> <b>dresser</b> in her Boudoir. As Carey finishes getting ready, scenery of Las Vegas is shown, before shifting to Carey, now dressed as a Vegas performer. As she walks down a runway dressed in white garments ad feathers, she catches {{the attention of a}} man. He turns out to be Carey's ex-lover, who in turn came to the show to meet with one of Carey's fellow dancers. As he caresses the female in the dressing room, Carey sees them, and walks by them, bumping into him purposely. Additional scenes are shown of Carey laying alone on the dark runway, apparently after the show has finished, as well as preparing herself for the show. During the second verse, the video then shows Carey driving down a highway in the desert, and as she drives, past memories of the pair are shown, holding each other intimately in a bed. She then pushes old gifts he had given her into the passengers seat, and pulls over the car, continuing the scene {{from the beginning of the}} video. After the car explodes, Carey tears off her necklace in despair, and begins to flail her arms in desperation. The video ends with Carey back at the show in Vegas during the finale, as glitter drops from the top of the stage. Carey, now back in the desert, looks for another ride, and gets into a black Cadillac Escalade driven by Nick Cannon.|$|E

25|$|Having {{finished}} his apprenticeship with Hammond, Keats registered {{as a medical}} student at Guy's Hospital (now part of King's College London) and began studying there in October 1815. Within a month of starting, he was accepted as <b>a</b> <b>dresser</b> at the hospital, assisting surgeons during operations, {{the equivalent of a}} junior house surgeon today. It was a significant promotion, that marked a distinct aptitude for medicine; it brought greater responsibility and a heavier workload. Keats's long and expensive medical training with Hammond and at Guy's Hospital led his family to assume he would pursue a lifelong career in medicine, assuring financial security, and it seems that at this point Keats had a genuine desire to become a doctor. He lodged near the hospital, at 28 St Thomas's Street in Southwark, with other medical students, including Henry Stephens who became a famous inventor and ink magnate.|$|E
500|$|There {{were several}} {{different}} categories of {{worker in the}} quarries. The quarrymen proper, who made up just over 50% of the workforce, worked the slate in partnerships of three, four, six or eight, known as [...] "bargain gangs". A gang of four typically consisted of two [...] "rockmen" [...] who would blast the rock to produce blocks, a splitter, who would split the blocks with hammer and chisel, and <b>a</b> <b>dresser.</b> A rybelwr would usually be a boy learning his trade, who would wander around the galleries offering assistance to the gangs. Sometimes a gang {{would give him a}} block of slate to split. Other groups were the [...] "bad rockmen" [...] who usually worked in crews of three, removing unworkable rock from the face, and the [...] "rubbish men" [...] who cleared the waste rock from the galleries and built the tips of waste which surrounded the quarry. One ton of saleable slate could produce up to 30tons of waste.|$|E

500|$|Had Cagney's {{mother had}} her way, his stage career {{would have ended}} when he quit Every Sailor after two months; proud as she was of his performance, she {{preferred}} that he get an education. Cagney appreciated the $35 a week he was paid, which he called [...] "a mountain of money for me in those worrisome days." [...] In deference to his mother's worries, he got employment as a brokerage house runner. This did not stop him looking for more stage work, however, {{and he went on}} to successfully audition for a chorus part in the William B. Friedlander musical Pitter Patter, for which he earned $55 a week—he sent $40 to his mother each week. So strong was his habit of holding down more than one job at a time, he also worked as <b>a</b> <b>dresser</b> for one of the leads, portered the casts' luggage, and understudied for the lead. Among the chorus line performers was 16-year-old Frances Willard [...] "Billie" [...] Vernon, whom he married in 1922.|$|E

2500|$|In 1835, Bagley first {{appeared}} in Lowell, Massachusetts, working at the Hamilton Mills. She worked initially as a weaver and then as <b>a</b> <b>dresser,</b> and by 1840 she had saved enough money to make a deposit on the house which her parents and siblings were living in. Bagley was dissatisfied with working conditions however and published {{one of her first}} pieces of writing, “Pleasures of Factory Life”, in an 1840 issue of the Lowell Offering, a literary magazine written, edited, and published by working women. These [...] "pleasures", she wrote, were like angels' visits: [...] "few and far between".|$|E

He subsequently purchased and managed a funeral parlor. [...] Bradley's wife later said he was tormented by memories of the war, wept in his sleep {{for the first four}} years of their marriage and kept a large knife in <b>a</b> <b>dresser</b> drawer for [...] "protection". He also had flashbacks of his best friend Iggy, Ralph Ignatowski, who was captured and tortured by Japanese soldiers. Bradley could not forgive himself for not being there to try and save his friend's life.|$|E
2500|$|In October, a {{grand jury}} began {{examining}} the case, calling 95 witnesses and amassing 975 pages of testimony. Mrs. Crater refused to appear. The conclusion was that [...] "the evidence is insufficient to warrant any expression of opinion as to whether Crater is alive or dead, or {{as to whether he}} has absented himself voluntarily, or is the sufferer from disease in the nature of amnesia, or is the victim of crime". At the time, some theorized that he had left town with another woman or fled to avoid revelations of corruption, but the case's extensive publicity would have made it virtually impossible for Crater to have begun a new life somewhere else. Six months after his disappearance, Crater's wife found envelopes in <b>a</b> <b>dresser</b> drawer containing money and a note from the judge. The discovery led to a number of new but ultimately inconclusive leads, and no trace of him was ever found. [...] Crater's wife said that he had been murdered.

2500|$|Bucky Katt is Rob's {{selfish and}} cynical Siamese Cat. His ears are nearly always drawn laid back {{flat on his}} head, a feline sign of defiance, aggressiveness, and he is missing an upper canine tooth. The Humane Society found Bucky huddled on a trash can, while the cat {{was only a few}} weeks old, in Hackensack, New Jersey, later to be adopted by Rob. While Bucky's father has never been mentioned, Bucky gave his mother's maiden name on a credit card {{application}} as [...] "Tricky Woo," [...] an allusion to the ludicrously pampered (but in fact good-natured) pet dog of that name in James Herriot's stories of his experiences as a vet. Bucky has been said to be named for Negro League baseball player Buck O'Neil. Bucky lives in <b>a</b> <b>dresser</b> located in the hall closet of Rob's apartment because he refuses to share a room with Satchel. On most outdoor excursions, when Rob is present, Bucky is carried in a strap-on [...] "Bundle-O-Joy" [...] baby carrier, referenced as a way of keeping the cat out of trouble. Most of Bucky's aggression is directed at Satchel, although most of his attempts usually fail as Satchel does not have enough intelligence for Bucky's rude sarcasm and is often unaware that he is even being insulted. Three obsessions dominate Bucky's life: Fungo Squiggly; his desire to stop the [...] "monkey invasion"; and wanting to film a movie or TV show about himself.|$|E
