It is argued that, since {{the creation of the}} United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), access to refugee aid has been globalized but has also become more and more stratified. The UNHCR has expanded its activities beyond the frontiers of Europe, but has also tailored aid for specific groups. This is because protection work increasingly articulates different modes of classifying refugees. Three modes of ordering are explored here in the Central African case: the legal approach, the labour (or developmental) approach and the basic needs (or vulnerability) approach. These modes refer to different regimes of action, different <b>actors</b> <b>of</b> <b>protection</b> and eventually different subjectivities. Each mode of classification, it is argued, {{is the product of a}} specific period of the UNHCR's history...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the use by States of the 'changed circumstances' cessation provision in Article IC(5) of the Refugee Convention, {{and the wider}} implications of this practice for international refugee law. It focuses in particular on {{the application of the}} cessation clause to refugees from Iraq and Afghanistan - two countries which, despite changes in country conditions, continue to experience civil conflict and security concerns. A number of important interpretative issues arise in relation to cessation under Article I C(5) of the Convention. These include: the relationship between the criteria for recognition and cessation of refugee status under Articles 1 A(2) and 1 C(5) of the Convention; what is required to constitute a 'change in circumstances' in the country of origin; the applicable burden and standard of proof and the meaning of 'protection'. The interpretation of 'protection' in this context is particular important, not only for elucidation of the cessation criteria, but also more broadly for the meaning of protection under international refugee law. As such the thesis canvasses debates which are pertinent to many other contentious areas of refugee law, including the relationship between the refugee definition and complementary protection, application of the Refugee Convention in situations of armed conflict, and the role of non-state bodies as <b>actors</b> <b>of</b> <b>protection.</b> It also illustrates some of the central problems with {{the way in which the}} 1951 Refugee Convention is implemented domestically in key asylum host states. The arguments put forward in this thesis have particular significance for the return of asylum-seekers and refugees to situations of ongoing conflict and post-conflict situations and is therefore highly pertinent to the future development of international refugee law...|$|E

40|$|This thesis aims {{to study}} {{what are the}} current {{protection}} challenges faced by Palestinian refugee {{children and their families}} {{in the context of the}} protracted crisis in the occupied territories of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Furthermore, this study will also look at how different factors influence on children's well-being, enabling or impeding to build their resilience under the ongoing adversarial circumstances. In addition, it will also analyse what mechanisms and strategies ensure the inclusive participation of Palestinian refugee children in their communities. Therefore, this thesis will use a mixed method approach, combining the outcomes of interviews that have been conducted with UNRWA personnel and the review of secondary sources. Two main theories will be used for the analysis of the research findings: Transactional-Ecological model and Social Ecology <b>of</b> <b>Protection.</b> The aim is to gain a better insight into how supportive environments and factors can be strengthened.

40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between the Responsibility to Protect (R 2 P) and the pursuit of the so-called ‘Women, Peace and Security’ (WPS) agenda at the UN. We ask whether the two agendas should continue to be pursued separately or whether each can make a useful contribution to the other. We argue that while the history of R 2 P has not included language that deliberately evokes the <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> women and the promotion of gender in preventing genocide and mass atrocities, this does not preclude the R 2 P and WPS agendas becoming mutually reinforcing. The article identifies cross-cutting areas where the two agendas may be leveraged for the UN and member states to address the concerns of women as both <b>actors</b> in need <b>of</b> <b>protection</b> and active agents in preventing and responding to genocide and mass atrocities, namely in the areas of early warning...|$|R
40|$|Hsp 70 s are a {{class of}} {{ubiquitous}} and highly conserved molecular chaperones playing {{a central role in}} the regulation of proteostasis in the cell. Hsp 70 s assist a myriad of cellular processes by binding unfolded or misfolded substrates during a complex biochemical cycle involving large-scale structural rearrangements. Here we show that an analysis of coevolu-tion at the residue level fully captures the characteristic large-scale conformational transi-tions of this protein family, and predicts an evolutionary conserved–and thus functional– homo-dimeric arrangement. Furthermore, we highlight that the features encoding the Hsp 70 dimer are more conserved in bacterial than in eukaryotic sequences, suggesting that the known Hsp 70 /Hsp 110 hetero-dimer is a eukaryotic specialization built on a pre-existing template. Author Summary Molecular chaperones are {{a class of}} proteins that are crucial for the correct functioning of cells. They play central housekeeping roles in the normal cell cycle, and are major <b>actors</b> <b>of</b> the <b>protection</b> system <b>of</b> the cell against cell stress conditions. In this study, we apply statis-tical inference methods to analyse the structure and function of the Hsp 70 molecular chaperone, one of the main members of chaperones. We use the correlated amino acid co-evolutions in protein sequences to identify directly interacting amino acids. Our results show that coevolutions capture an appreciable fraction of native contacts throughout the protein. Furthermore, amino acid coevolution predicts previously hypothesized functional dimer interactions between Hsp 70 s, thus giving a theoretical contribution to this debate...|$|R
40|$|International {{responses}} to conflict and complex humanitarian emergencies are diverse and multifaceted. Different actors – among them non-government organisations (NGOs), the United Nations (UN) protection mandated organisations, UN peacekeeping forces, both {{military and police}} – all {{have a role to}} play to mitigate the impact of armed conflict on civilian populations. Over the last 13 years a significant amount of work has been done to improve the international community’s response in relation to the <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> civilians (POC). This has been led by different actors – the UN Security Council, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) and the humanitarian community made up of UN humanitarian agencies, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), and NGOs – all working in the same complex humanitarian contexts. Despite the development of POC, there is a perceived ‘disconnect’ between the understanding of different forms <b>of</b> <b>protection,</b> the different disciplines practising or working on the POC, and the different guidance and legal regimes imposing obligations on both state and non-state <b>actors</b> in the area <b>of</b> <b>protection.</b> This paper is the first contribution to a broader research project that aims to determine whether the perceived disconnect between actors involved in protection work is real or anecdotal. By exploring the evolution <b>of</b> <b>protection</b> language and policy through the UN Security Council, DPKO and the humanitarian community, it is possible to develop an improved understanding of some of the reasons  for distinct protection policies and definitions that exist between different actors. Some initial variations in the interpretation of POC are quick to emerge, giving rise to additional questions about how the distinctions can be better understood...|$|R

40|$|Movable {{cultural}} heritage is not bounded nor shielded by national territorial borders. Applicable domestic laws are of limited import without {{the cooperation of}} other states and the international community. Despite a century <b>of</b> domestic legal <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> movable {{cultural heritage}} in many states, widespread non-compliance and lack of enforcement has been the norm rather than the exception. However, the tide is turning. States formerly reluctant to ratify cultural heritage treaties have done so, signalling their acceptance {{of the importance of}} multilateral action in this field. Enforcement of such laws is viewed as part of the reinforcement of good governance, rule of law and human rights in the international and domestic spheres. This new found international cooperation has emerged within the context of developments in human rights law which have necessarily redefined and informed initiatives to combat the illicit traffic of cultural objects. These efforts are clarifying the nature of the obligations owed by states (and non-state <b>actors)</b> in respect <b>of</b> <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> movable heritage, and expanded the right-holder beyond the state – to individuals and groups. This chapter seeks to outline recent developments in the human rights law and international law for the <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> cultural heritage which manifest this interrelation as it pertains to movable heritage. Part One focuses on the obligations on states and non-state actors in leading international instruments for the <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> movable heritage including prevention of its illicit transfer during armed conflict, belligerent occupation and peacetime. Part Two details how human rights norms have been referenced in multilateral instruments for the <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> cultural heritage; and examines the relationship between controls on the export of cultural material and specific human rights, namely, the right to property, right to self-determination, right to participate in cultural life, and minority protection...|$|R
40|$|Following the {{important}} work of women’s rights and feminist groups since the 1980 s, <b>actors</b> <b>of</b> refugee <b>protection</b> are now {{aware that the}} international refugee protection framework is not gender neutral. Refugees who did not fit the heterosexual male mould installed by the 1951 Refugee Convention had difficulties not only accessing refugee status, but also support services when in exile. Today, both {{at the international level}} and in the UK, non-state actors use the concept of gender to highlight the differences in access to support for different groups of refugees, such as women and more recently, LGBTI people. Despite the ubiquity of the concept of gender in the refugee support field, its meaning today remains unclear. In this research project, I looked at the place of gender in refugee support services in the UK through the work of a local organisation that supports asylum seekers and refugees in the North of England. I sought to address the following questions: is gender taken into account in the charity’s services (and how) ? Does gender {{have an impact on the}} clients’ access to support and the quality of the services given? Inspired by feminist and postcolonial thought, I focused the thesis on the experiences and views of the clients who receive services and the staff and volunteers who provide them. I analysed data from semi-structured interviews with twenty-one participants and from participant observation. The project revealed that in a context where equality is an obligation for charities, talking about (in) equality, identity and difference seems to have become more difficult. However, the analysis of participants’ accounts and discourses showed that a conversation about those themes – ‘about gender’ – remains important and necessary...|$|R

40|$|The thesis interrogates the US {{policy on}} Women, Peace and Security. This policy {{is based on}} the UN Security Council Resolution 1325 and the {{subsequent}} resolutions that address the situation of women in conflict and post-conflict settings. The main research question is as follows: How does the US policy involve the politics <b>of</b> <b>protection?</b> The research is informed by feminist studies of international relations in general, and by the contributions of Wendy Brown (1995) and Iris Marion Young (2003) on the politics <b>of</b> <b>protection</b> in particular. The archive covers a collection of documents issued by the Federal Government of the United States but the textual priority is given to one particular text: United States National Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security (2011). Through the analysis of this text, the thesis “reads off” the US policy on Women, Peace and Security. The problem representation is outlined and followed by the interrogation of this policy as discourse involving the politics <b>of</b> <b>protection</b> and specifically, formed under the logic <b>of</b> masculinist <b>protection.</b> The transformative potential of this policy is examined in regard to the objective of gender equality. The thesis further involves a juxtaposition of the US policy with the Norwegian policy on Women Peace and Security. Although {{on the face of it}} the US policy on Resolution 1325 resembles the earlier policy on oppressed women in Afghanistan and Iraq that appeared shortly after the terrorist attack of 9 / 11 and justified military interventions in these countries, my empirical findings show that at the same time this policy is a distinct case and includes new elements. The politics <b>of</b> <b>protection</b> does not exhaust the understanding of this policy and the gender power relations produced within it appear to be more complicated. Although the dominant representations of men/masculinity, that is, the perpetrator of (sexual) violence and the provider of security, are consistent with the logic <b>of</b> masculinist <b>protection,</b> the representation <b>of</b> women/femininity differs. The US policy does not constitute women as only passive victims of violence who are in need <b>of</b> <b>protection.</b> Nevertheless, this representation is still based on the old generalizations about women as peaceful mothers, caregivers and <b>actors</b> <b>of</b> positive change. Ultimately, the space of autonomy remains limited. Finally, since the US policy constructs women as “different”, it is likely to reproduce instead of reducing gender inequalities...|$|R
