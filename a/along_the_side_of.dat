5|$|Minas Geraes and São Paulo were {{originally}} armed with twelve 12-inch/45 caliber, twenty-two 4.7-inch/50 caliber, eighteen 3-pounders and eight 1-pounder naval guns. The main battery was arranged with four superfiring turrets, two each fore and aft, and two placed en echelon.

5|$|The {{greatest}} {{evolution in}} dreadnought protection {{came with the}} development of the anti-torpedo bulge and torpedo belt, both attempts to protect against underwater damage by mines and torpedoes. The purpose of underwater protection was to absorb the force of a detonating mine or torpedo well away from the final watertight hull. This meant an inner bulkhead <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the hull, which was generally lightly armoured to capture splinters, separated from the outer hull by one or more compartments. The compartments in between were either left empty, or filled with coal, water or fuel oil.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} {{armed with a}} main battery of four /35 caliber guns guns in two twin gun turrets on the centerline, one forward and aft. The {{secondary}} battery consisted of fourteen /40 caliber Mark IV guns, which were placed in casemates in the hull. For close-range defense against torpedo boats, she carried sixteen 6-pounder guns mounted in casemates <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the hull and six 1-pounder guns. As was standard for capital ships of the period, Wisconsin carried four 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes in deck mounted torpedo launchers.|$|E

September 9, 1909), a local railroad executive whose Arden estate was in the nearby hills, donated land in February 1910 in a different portion of Turner to build a brand new station to the east. The old one-story depot had a roof and structural supports that were aging and on the verge of collapsing to the ground.|$|E

5|$|At 07:00 on 4 August, {{while the}} French {{squadron}} was cruising off the Brazilian coast, lookouts sighted sails on the horizon. Uncertain {{of the identity}} of the strange ships, the French gradually closed the distance during the morning. Landolphe could see that there were seven large vessels and three smaller ships, all unmistakably British. He was unable however to tell whether they were naval ships of the line or East Indiamen. Initially he thought they might be merchant ships, but at noon he sighted double rows of gunports <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> each ship and called off the attack, turning away and signalling for his squadron to split up, believing the enemy to be large warships easily capable of destroying his small force. Captain Jurien protested Landolphe's order, insisting that the convoy was composed of merchant ships and not warships, but Landolphe over-ruled Jurien's protests. In fact, Jurien was correct.|$|E
5|$|In the chaetonotidans, the {{excretory}} system {{consists of}} {{a single pair of}} protonephridia, which open through separate pores on the lateral underside of the animal, usually in the midsection of the body. In the macrodasyidans, there are several pairs of these opening <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the body. Nitrogenous waste is probably excreted through the body wall, as part of respiration, and the protonephridia are believed to function mainly in osmoregulation. Unusually, the protonephridia do not take the form of flame cells, but, instead, the excretory cells consist of a skirt surrounding a series of cytoplasmic rods that in turn enclose a central flagellum. These cells, termed cyrtocytes, connect to a single outlet cell which passes the excreted material into the protonephridial duct.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species have}} paired {{cerebral}} organs, sacs whose only openings {{are to the}} outside. Others species have unpaired evertible organs {{on the front of}} their heads. Some have slits <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the head or grooves obliquely across the head, and these may be associated with paired cerebral organs. All of these are thought to be chemoreceptors, and the cerebral organs may also aiding osmoregulation. Small pits in the epidermis appear to be sensors. On their head some species have a number of pigment-cup ocelli, which can detect light but not form an image. Most nemerteans have two to six ocelli, although some have hundreds. A few tiny species that live between grains of sand have statocysts, which sense balance.|$|E

5|$|That night, a {{force of}} around 300 Japanese who had been falling back since they had run into the 61st Infantry Battalion on Stephen's Ridge, {{encountered}} positions manned by the 2/12th and 9th Infantry Battalions around the Gama River. In a surprise attack, the Australians inflicted heavy casualties on the Japanese. After the battle the Australians estimated that up to 90 had been killed.

Elsewhere, at the mission, starting at around 8:00pm, they carried out harassment operations in an effort to distract the Australians and assist their comrades to try to break through the Australian positions from the Gama River. This lasted throughout the night.|$|E
5|$|The Silver Reef {{area was}} first {{inhabited}} by Anasazi Native Americans between about 200AD and 1300AD.

They were also farmers and gardeners, growing corn, wheat, rye, and barley. Many were potters, and pottery {{can be found in}} abandoned villages. The Anasazi usually constructed temporary dwellings out of sticks and leaves, often using bark for the roofs. Occasionally they built more permanent dwellings out of rocks, usually <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> a mountain, often large enough to accommodate several families. Storage pits were often placed behind the rock dwellings. Settlements were typically small, as food was scarce. A group of Virgin Anasazi lived in what is now the Red Cliffs Anasazi Site in Red Cliffs Recreation Area.|$|E
