5|$|In the synoptics, the {{ministry}} of Jesus takes a single year, but in John it takes three, as evidenced by references to three Passovers. Events are not <b>all</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> order: {{the date of the}} crucifixion is different, as is the time of Jesus' anointing in Bethany, and the cleansing of the temple occurs in the beginning of Jesus' ministry rather than near its end.|$|E
5|$|The {{detailed}} {{dynamics of}} this rule are complicated, including {{the existence of}} small stable structures. However, in the aggregate (when started with all cells in random states) it tends to form large regions of cells that are <b>all</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> state as each other, with the boundaries between these regions evolving according to the curve-shortening flow.|$|E

After returning from All Blacks duty, he played for Canterbury and contributed to a Ranfurly Shield win over Waitako. Canterbury then reached the NPC final, giving Hammett {{the opportunity to be}} part of a Super 12, Ranfurly Shield, and NPC winning team, <b>all</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> year. Wellington won the NPC final however, and the opportunity was lost. Hammett was then {{selected for the}} end-of-year All Blacks tour, and played against France and Italy (both as a substitute).|$|E

5|$|Attalea {{is a large}} genus of palms {{native to}} Mexico, the Caribbean, Central and South America. This pinnately leaved, non-spiny genus {{includes}} both small palms lacking an aboveground stem and large trees. The genus has a complicated taxonomic history, and has often been split into four or five genera based on differences in the male flowers. Since the genera can only be distinguished {{on the basis of}} their male flowers, the existence of intermediate flower types and the existence of hybrids between different genera has been used as an argument for keeping them <b>all</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> genus. This has been supported by a recent molecular phylogeny.|$|E
5|$|He rebounded, however, taking {{silver in}} the 10,000 metres at the 2009 World Championships in Athletics, {{finishing}} behind Kenenisa Bekele. Zersenay had led for {{a large part of}} the race, setting a fast pace, but he was beaten to the gold by Bekele's sprint finish. Following this, he won his third World Half Marathon title, setting a Championship record of 59:35 and also winning a silver medal with Eritrea in the team competition. The gold medal over the half marathon distance made him the second runner ever to win a World Championship medal in cross country, track and road racing <b>all</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> year, a feat achieved previously by only Paul Tergat.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} side of the fence, the North Vietnamese transported and/or stored 70,000 tons of {{supplies}} in 3,000 trucks with a net loss of 13.5 percent during the year. During the same period about 80,000 PAVN troops made the trip south. A new North Vietnamese logistical effort, discovered by U.S. intelligence in late 1968, was a petroleum, oil, and lubricants (POL) pipeline running southwest from the North Vietnamese city of Vinh. By early the following year the pipeline had crossed the Laotian frontier and by summer it had reached Muong Nong and the approaches to the A Sầu Valley. The plastic line, assisted by numerous small pumping stations, could transfer diesel fuel, gasoline, and kerosene <b>all</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> pipe.|$|E

5|$|Several {{days before}} President Kennedy made his November flight to Texas, Grant had been {{assigned}} to cover the state's delegation in Washington, D.C., then fly back with the White House press corps; he was the only photographer to make the trip. At Dallas Love Field, Grant made the only published photograph from that visit of the president and Jacqueline Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson and Lady Bird Johnson, and Texas Governor John Connally and Nellie Connally, <b>all</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> image. Another of Grant's photos, from San Antonio's Aerospace Medicine Center, was published {{on the front page of}} the Dallas Morning News on November 22; a copy was signed that morning by President Kennedy—across the photo, to Jan White—and is believed to be the last item he signed before he climbed aboard the presidential limousine for his intended trip to the Dallas Trade Mart.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{introduction}} of toss-up puzzles {{at the start of}} the 18th syndicated season in 2000, the contestant at the red arrow always started round 1, with the next contestant clockwise starting each subsequent round. In addition, if a tie for first place occurred, an additional speed-up round was played between the tied contestants for the right to go to the bonus round. The wheel formerly featured a Free Spin wedge, which automatically awarded a token that the contestant could turn in after a lost turn to keep control of the wheel. It was replaced in 1989 with a single Free Spin token placed over a selected cash wedge. Free Spin was retired, and Free Play introduced, {{at the start of the}} 27th syndicated season in 2009. Between September 16, 1996 and the end of season 30 in 2013, the show featured a progressive Jackpot wedge, which had been in several different rounds in its history. The jackpot started at $5,000 and had the value of every spin within the round added to it. To claim the jackpot, a contestant had to land on the wedge, call a correct letter, and solve the puzzle <b>all</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> turn. In later years, it also offered $500 per correct letter and $500 to the jackpot, regardless of whether or not it was won in that turn.|$|E
