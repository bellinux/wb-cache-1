While there she was reunited with Johnny (Chris Coghill), her first love. Metcalfe said this caused a [...] "real mix of emotions for Mercedes". She went on to elaborate {{that there was a}} lot her character wanted to say to Johnny but [...] "at the same time she doesn't see the point. There's a lot of anger there. But there's also <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>excitement</b> for Mercedes as she sees him again, because he was the guy who won her heart for the first time. The storyline also explains why Mercedes is the way she is now". Mercedes and Johnny kissed, which Metcalfe said was them just [...] "getting lost in the moment" [...] and was partly due to Mercedes having doubts about Riley's fidelity. She added that Mercedes and Johnny spend time [...] "just talking and reliving the old times, especially how he won her over in the past".|$|E
500|$|Fogel {{commented on}} Gaga's lack of {{experience}} in a tour and {{said that it was}} an opportunity for her. [...] "As an artist with that kind of talent and vision emerges, it creates <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>excitement,</b> and ticket sales worldwide demonstrate that people are really excited to see the show. Over {{the course of the next}} many months we're trying to play to as many people in as many places as possible", Fogel added. [...] "It's an across the board home run." [...] Demands increased and another additional six dates were added to the announced itinerary. The Monster Ball sold out shows in Toronto, Vancouver and San Jose who were compelled to add second dates in each city. In Los Angeles, to ensure that concert goers had the best possible access to tickets, a second performance was announced prior to the onsale of the first shows, and both Staples Center concerts were completely sold out. Billboard estimated that by the time the tour wraps up in 2011, it would have grossed close to US$200million worldwide.|$|E

[...] If we're not {{having a good time}} making a record, it's gonna show and you're gonna hear it." [...] To capture the excitement of their live shows, DecembeRadio recorded basic tracks live in the studio. [...] Reedy said recording live is particularly useful for capturing energetic performances from drummer Boone Daughdrill. [...] "It's definitely very critical for him to be on top of his game and feeling like it's a unit, because you play off of each other. [...] It's a real push and pull thing that happens in rock and roll music that you really can't sometimes capture by just doing it track by track by track", said Reedy. [...] Miker said the band recorded a handful of songs that were [...] "out of the box of where CCM music is", and Reedy noted that some tracks [...] "stretched what we're doing ... with production." [...] "Gasoline", for example, includes a [...] "Beatlesque" [...] section with a children's choir, string section and piccolo trumpet, and [...] "Falling for You" [...] begins and ends with some guitar [...] "shred licks" [...] that started as a joke in the writing process.|$|E

30|$|The role of {{sensation}} seeking in problem gambling has been verified in several studies {{but not yet}} examined in Macau student gambling surveys. Sensation seeking is a personality trait showing an individual’s desire for experiences and feelings which are novel, complex and intense (Zuckerman 2009). The individual may ignore or tolerate potential risk associated with these experiences. Sensation seeking is often linked to thrill seeking activities such as gambling, smoking and drinking. These activities may provide <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> stimulation and <b>excitement.</b> The high sensation seekers need plenty of stimulation to obtain optimal level of arousal. Problem gambling is commonly found among high sensation seekers (Gupta and Derevensky 1998 a; Powell et al. 1999). For example, in {{a study conducted among}} youth and adult gamblers, Harris et al. (2013) found that sensation seeking was positively associated with student pathological gambling. Sensation seeking is also identified as a robust predictor of excessive gambling.|$|R

40|$|Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the Degree of Master of Business Administration at Strathmore UniversityCloud Computing has become the next frontier in the technology world. It constitutes a game changer when compared with traditional computing models thus creating <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> industry <b>excitement.</b> The Kenyan economy is largely driven by Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs). These enterprises are normally fast growing and provide employment to {{a significant portion of}} the population. The advantages of cloud computing are much in favor of SMEs especially in terms of reducing costs and ability to scale. However, despite the benefits, it appears that there isn’t significant adoption of the technology. Additionally, there is an inherent lack of proper frameworks that can be used to facilitate adoption. This research therefore aims at understanding the cloud computing landscape in Kenya and in particular to understand the factors that come in to play with respect to adoption, the benefits and key challenges. The study is limited to SMEs as they stand to gain the most from cloud adoption. The study is also focused on SMEs based in Nairobi County and has been conducted through quantitative and qualitative measures. The research focused on determining internal factors and external factors that influence adoption of cloud technologies. The results show that there is some level of adoption though more needs to be done in terms of creating awareness of the technology. In addition, it was seen that cloud technologies can have a significant impact on businesses, especially SMEs. The respondents of the study indicated that their decision to adopt cloud technologies contributed to improvement in operational efficiency and in lowering operational costs. In terms of key challenges, it was established that privacy, security and service availability and reliability were real concerns for businesses considering cloud adoption. It is hoped that the findings of this research will help in further development of adoption frameworks, create more engagement amongst key stakeholders and generally advance knowledge of cloud technologies...|$|R

40|$|University of Minnesota M. A. thesis. August 2011. Major: Mass Communication. Advisor: Catherine R. Squires. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vi, 55 pages, appendices A-B. The present research explores {{the differences in}} personal characteristics related to Korean Assembly members and constituency characteristics related to the digital divide between Korean Congresspeople using twitter and those not using twitter, {{and the effects of}} those characteristics on Korean politicians‟ communication activity on twitter. The results are inconsistent with previous research about political adoption of web technologies. Among five variables employed in most previous research (age, party status, party type, race competitiveness, and experience in politics), only the mean for age is significantly different between groups. The mean for new variable added in the present research, the number of appearances in television news, which implies the popularity of Assembly members, however, is significantly different. Among constituency variables related to the digital divide (the proportion of male voters, the proportion of voters older than fifty, the proportion of voters with higher than college degree, the proportion of office workers, Internet penetration, and Income), the proportion of male voters and those with higher than college degree, the proportion of office workers, and Internet penetration are significantly different between Korean politicians using twitter and those not using twitter. In terms of the effects of two groups of variables on Korean Assembly members‟ communication activity on twitter, the linear regression model including personal characteristics related to politicians accounts for more variances in twitter activity than the model consisted of constituency characteristics related to the digital divide. In specific, the number of appearances in television news has a higher impact on twitter communication than any other variables. The first implication of the present study is that in a country like South Korea where Internet penetration levels are high and fairly equal across the districts, it is unlikely that access to the Internet is not a detrimental element influencing political use of twitter. The second is that while <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> the <b>excitement</b> around twitter and other digital communication technologies assumes that it will change everything, the present study goes against the grain of those who predict that twitter or other new technologies will revolutionize or democratize political communication. The last implication {{of this study is that}} the diffusion of innovation or the digital divide research is not as useful theoretically in a country like South Korea or at a time when getting access to the Internet is not as expensive...|$|R
