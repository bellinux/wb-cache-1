40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to compare the effect of Solanum melongena (garden egg plant), <b>apple</b> and <b>oat</b> on serum lipid profile of rats fed a hyper{{cholesterol}}emic diet. One hundred rats were grouped into five groups of 20 animals each; one group was fed with grower`s marsh alone and acted as the sham control. One group was fed grower`s marsh and 3 % cholesterol and served as the test control. The other three groups were fed with the grower`s marsh, 3 % cholesterol and either of 4 % <b>apple,</b> <b>oat,</b> or garden egg plant for a period of one month. After 2 weeks, half of the animals in each group were sacrificed for mid-term studies. The results obtained indicate that garden egg plant significantly (P< 0. 05) reduced weight gain of rats and feed efficiency compared with the other supplementations. Garden egg plant significantly (P< 0. 05) reduced serum total cholesterol, triglyceride and increased serum HDL-cholesterol compared with <b>oat</b> and <b>apple</b> in both the mid-term and full-term studies. The study suggests that garden egg plant has a more hypolipidemic effect than <b>apple</b> and <b>oat...</b>|$|R

40|$|Endophytic entomopathogenic fungi (EEPF) are {{biological}} control agents {{able to live}} in their host plants in a symbiotic interaction and secrete secondary metabolites in the host plant tissues interacting with pests and phytopathogenic agents like plants virus.

40|$|Nineteen genotypes of Hordeum vulgare were {{characterized}} as partially resistant or susceptible regarding {{growth of the}} bird cherry - <b>oat</b> <b>aphid</b> (Rhopalosiphum padi L.). These genotypes were treated with volatiles from undamaged plants of barley cultivar Alva.

Changes in AHA induced by volatiles from the same genotype were also positively correlated with AG. All genotypes were tested as inducers with cultivar Kara as the receiver of volatiles. Five genotypes induced significant reductions in AHA of Kara. The results show that aphids are able to detect changes in responding plants induced by volatiles from another cultivar. Plant volatile interactions may thus be a component of induced resistance to aphids. These interactions could influence the results of experiments used to select for insect-resistant plants in plant breeding programmes...|$|R

These field results corroborated those obtained by previous studies with the same formulations and dosages in the laboratory. In oat, all insecticide treatments reduced aphid populations and percent- age aphid infested plants, with a residual action of ca. 25 d. Barley yellow dwarf virus-like visual symptoms were reduced with disulfoton. In winter wheat, the residual action of all insecticide treatments in the fall lasted up to 19 d.

40|$|AbstractBarley yellow dwarf virus-PAV (BYDV-PAV) is a luteovirus {{transmitted}} between {{plants by}} phloem-feeding aphids (e. g. the bird-cherry <b>oat</b> <b>aphid,</b> Rhopalosiphum padi). BYDV-PAV {{is associated with}} yellow dwarf disease in commercial cereals crops (e. g. wheat), often resulting in significant losses of grain yield and quality. Although {{there has been much}} study on the effect of predicted future elevated atmospheric CO 2 (eCO 2) on plants, the impact on plant-virus interactions is relatively understudied. The effect of eCO 2 on the growth, physiology and antioxidant defence systems of BYDV-infected wheat may impact the success of different cereal cultivars in the future. In particular, antioxidants ascorbic acid and glutathione are involved in the plant antioxidant defence system that regulates potentially harmful reactive oxygen species (ROS) associated with plant host-virus interactions. This project compared host symptom expression and antioxidant defence systems of two susceptible (Triticum aestivum cv. Yitpi and Revenue) cultivars and a recently released BYDV-resistant (T. aestivum cv. Manning) cultivar of Australian wheat, artificially infected with BYDV-PAV using the aphid vector R. padi, and grown under eCO 2 in growth chambers and in the field-based Australian Grains Free Air Carbon dioxide Enrichment (AGFACE) facility in Horsham, Victoria, Australia. BYDV-infection was associated with changes in biomass, total antioxidants, and the proportion of oxidised and reduced antioxidants. Data suggests a disruption of plant antioxidant processes with infection, which could lead to greater vulnerability to further biotic or abiotic stresses. A comparison of infection under eCO 2 of cultivars with variable susceptibility to plant viruses may provide useful information in selection for future breeding for a changing climate...|$|R
40|$|Aphids {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} insect pests of greenhouse crops yet to be controlled by biological means. Broad spectrum chemical control is becoming increasingly difficult to use in integrated pest management programmes, therefore, there is a need for a suitable biocontrol agent to be mass reared and released. The Tasmanian brown lacewing, Micromus tasmaniae Walker is an aphid predator that is found commonly throughout Australasia and has suitable characteristics that make it a candidate for mass rearing. A technique for rearing M. tasmaniae was developed. Eggs of M. tasmaniae were reared in batches of 50, 100 and 200 in 20 litre clear plastic containers. The <b>oat</b> <b>aphid,</b> Rhopalosiphum padi L. was fed to the larvae. The results revealed that the highest initial egg density (200 eggs per container) produced the cheapest adults at 22 cents per adult. However, mass rearing adults was considered not practical because of the high production cost, although, mass production of eggs is considered to be economically viable. The cost of producing one egg was 0. 015 cents. M tasmaniae was maintained in mass culture for six generations. Simple experiments were carried out to monitor the quality of laboratory-reared insects. The 'wild' insect was used as a quality standard and comparisons with laboratory-reared insect populations were made. The fecundity, development rates and tolerance to pirimicarb, a carbamate insecticide, were determined. Fecundity was found to decline with successive generations in mass culture. The lacewing development experiment indicated that larval stages of each generation suffered the highest mortality rate and that between 35 - 45 % of individuals emerged as adults. The tolerance of adults to pirimicarb did not alter over five generations. Recommendations for improving the mass rearing of M. tasmaniae are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The non-starch {{polysaccharide}} (NSP) components from <b>apple,</b> <b>oat,</b> broccoli and plantain were tested as growth substrates for {{representatives of the}} major groups of intestinal bacteria, none of which was able to fully utilise the NSPs for growth.   More bacteria {{were able to use}} the soluble plantain NSP fraction for growth than any other NSP tested, with the Bacteroides group showing the strongest growth response.   E. coli strains isolated from healthy people and Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients were all able to utilise the soluble plantain substrate to the same high extent. A wide range of commensal anaerobes were able to bind to the insoluble plantain NSP in a strain specific manner that was independent of the ability to utilize the soluble plantain NSP for growth, with E. coli binding in the highest numbers to the insoluble NSP. The effects of plantain NSP were monitored in vivo, and only the Bacteroides group increased significantly after soluble plantain supplementation.   E. coli populations were volunteer-specific and unaltered after plantain supplementation. Bacteroides and E. coli were the two main groups affected by plantain NSP after the in vitro work, both of which have been implicated in IBD.   Binding to, and growth on plantain may therefore selectively alter the composition of the gut microbiota in patients.   Despite the stimulation of E. coli growth, addition of plantain to the diet may help to prevent colonization of the gut wall by providing this alternative binding substrate.

40|$|Plants {{possess a}} complex and poorly {{understood}} network of defence mechanisms {{that enable them to}} counteract the effects of abiotic and biotic stress. Aphid phloem feeding is source of biotic stress in plants. Russian wheat aphid and Bird Cherry-Oat aphid feeding cause significant losses in the annual wheat crop, and control by conventional methods such as pesticide application, has proved to be ineffective. Infestation by the Russian wheat aphid has a particularly devastating effect in South Africa. Aphid-resistant wheat cultivars have been identified but an incomplete understanding of the mechanism of the plant’s resistance thwarts the development of improved cultivars. A two-dimensional gel electrophoresis method was developed, partially optimised and validated {{in order to determine the}} effect of Russian wheat aphid and Bird Cherry-Oat aphid phloem feeding on the Betta and Betta DN wheat proteome. Differentially expressed proteins that were up or down regulated more than two fold were identified using PDQuest™ Basic software and matched to known wheat proteins stored in the SwissProt protein database on the basis of their molecular mass and isolectric point. Initial analysis of the differential protein expression of Betta and Betta DN wheat in response to Russian wheat aphid and Bird Cherry-Oat aphid phloem feeding at different growth stages revealed that younger plants display higher levels of resistance than older plants. Feeding by the Bird-Cherry <b>Oat</b> <b>aphid</b> does not result in the upregulation of proteins implicated in a defence response, which indicates that the damage incurred by the plant due to feeding by this aphid is not enough to trigger a classic defence response. Feeding by the more damaging Russian wheat aphid resulted in a stress response in susceptible wheat cultivar Betta, and a defence response in resistant wheat cultivar Betta DN. The infestation of Betta DN resulted in the upregulation of putative thaumatins and amylase trypsin inhibitors, indicating that the Betta DN resistance response could be due to the combined effect of protease inhibitors that discourage aphid phloem feeding and the activation of the salicylic acid and jasmonic acid plant defence pathways...|$|R
40|$|Master of ScienceEntomologyC. Michael SmithThe {{bird cherry}} <b>oat</b> <b>aphid,</b> Rhopalosiphum padi, {{and one of}} the viruses it vectors, barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV), form a very {{damaging}} pest unit on cereals. Understanding how people can better manage crops to prevent damage or recognize environmental or geographic factors that put their crops at risk for BYDV could lead to improved virus aphid management strategies. One of the most successful methods for mitigating pest damage is using pest-resistant varieties of crops. Seven candidate wheat varieties were screened for resistance to R. padi, by testing aphid population densities and aphid host choice. Results of this research identified six varieties of wheat that show resistance to R. padi. One of the major knowledge gaps in BYDV management is forecasting potential damage. Our objective was to create viral presence maps, to start building the foundation of correlations between persistent and changing frequency of viruliferous R. padi. The results of BYDV assays in R. padi in wheat fields across Kansas indicated that the amount of BYDV infection in viruliferous aphids changes rapidly from year to year, and differs considerably between geographic regions and field landscape characteristics in Kansas. Neonicotinoid wheat seed treatment is a management technique that reduces R. padi populations. However, a common question among producers is whether or not seed treatments stop viral transmission. Results of greenhouse seed treatment experiments with plants from neonicotinoid treated and untreated seed infested with viruliferous R. padi indicated no significant difference in viral transmission due to seed treatment. This new information about R. padi wheat varietal resistance, geographic distribution of BYDV in Kansas, and neonicotinoid seed treatment creates a better understanding of aphid-virus-wheat interactions. Results from this thesis directly enhance producer ability to forecast risk from BYDV, select wheat varieties that effectively reduce R. padi as a BYDV vector, and to make better decisions about the use of insecticide to reduce BYDV infection...|$|R
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Grain Science and IndustryRonald L. MadlPraveen VadlaniProducers {{of whole}} wheat {{products}} {{are interested in}} marketing the health-promoting benefits of wheat antioxidants. However, they need a steady crop supply with consistent levels of antioxidants. The variable phenolic content in wheat crops is a problem. The objectives of this research were to 1) identify the factor (s) that contribute the most to the variability in phenolic content, 2) understand the mechanism (s) responsible for phenolic synthesis, and 3) artificially trigger that mechanism (s). Phenolics are hypothesized {{to be part of}} the defense response of hard red winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L) to stress. The effect of insect feeding, pathogen infection, and heat stress on phenolics in grains from wheat plants cv. Karl 92 was evaluated. Bird-cherry <b>oat</b> <b>aphid</b> (Rhopalosiphum padi) feeding stress significantly explained the variation in phenolic content. Furthermore, the relative allocation of carbon resources to grain yield/phenolic content was influenced by the stage of the plant at which aphid feeding started to occur. Based on these findings, phenolics were hypothesized to be an active defense response acting through a mechanism known as systemic acquired resistance (SAR). In order to prove this hypothesis, several synthetic elicitors of SAR were tested for their effectiveness at inducing de novo phenolic synthesis in wheat foliage and in mature grains. Elicitors that acted through the salicylic- and jasmonic acid signaling pathways were effective at inducing phenolic synthesis by 49 % and 177 %, respectively, in the leaves 36 hours post spray application. They also elicited a phenolic response in mature grains of up to 21 % induction. Enhancement of the levels of naturally occurring phenolic compounds with antioxidant activity in wheat grains through SAR activation is a value addition strategy that can potentially increase the profitability of hard red winter wheat crops. It can also provide manufacturers of whole wheat with natural antioxidants that can potentially be used to substitute their synthetic counterparts in wheat based products...|$|R

The materials were incorporated into diets yielding a concentration of 60 or 70 g kg (1) indigestible carbohydrates. The fermentability of indigestible carbohydrates was high with all diets, between 79 and 90 %. All substrates except the pure apple pectin generated intermediate to high proportions of butyric acid in the caecum (15 - 22 vs 8 %). The potato products gave high concentrations of butyric acid in the distal colon.

40|$|In this article, {{we propose}} a {{mathematical}} model that describes the competition between two plant virus strains (MAV and PAV) for both the host plant (<b>oat)</b> and their <b>aphid</b> vectors. We found that although PAV is transmitted by two aphids and MAV by only one, this fact, by itself, does not explain the complete replacement of MAV by PAV in New York State {{during the period from}} 1961 through 1976; an interpretation that is in agreement with the theories of A.

Also, although MAV wins the competition within aphids, we assumed that, in 1961, PAV mutated into a new variant such that this new variant was able to overcome MAV within the plants during a latent period. As shown below, this is sufficient to explain the swap of strains; that is, the dominant MAV was replaced by PAV, also in agreement with Power`s expectations.

40|$|Current anticholinesterase {{pesticides}} {{were developed}} during World War II and are toxic to mammals because they target a catalytic serine residue of acetylcholinesterases (AChEs) in insects and in mammals. A sequence analysis of AChEs from 73 species and a three-dimensional {{model of a}} malaria-carrying mosquito (Anopheles gambiae) AChE (AgAChE) reported here show that C 286 and R 339 of AgAChE are conserved {{at the opening of}} the active site of AChEs in 17 invertebrate and four insect species, respectively. Both residues are absent in the active site of AChEs of human, monkey, dog, cat, cattle, rabbit, rat, and mouse.

The four insects are house mosquito, Japanese encephalitis mosquito, African malaria mosquito, and German cockroach. The discovery of the two invertebrate-specific residues enables the development of effective and safer pesticides that target the residues present only in mosquito AChEs rather than the ubiquitous serine residue, thus potentially offering an effective control of mosquito-borne malaria. Anti-AgAChE pesticides can be designed to interact with R 339 and subsequently covalently bond to C 286. Such pesticides would be toxic to mosquitoes but not to mammals...|$|R
