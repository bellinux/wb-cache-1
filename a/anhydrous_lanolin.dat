40|$|Allergy to wool {{alcohols}} What are {{wool alcohols}}? Wool alcohols are the principle component of lanolin in which allergens are found. Lanolin {{is a natural}} product obtained from the fleece of sheep. Sebum is extracted from the wool, cleaned and refined to produce <b>anhydrous</b> <b>lanolin.</b> This comprises 3 parts, wool alcohols, fatty alcohols and fatty acids. Currently the wool alcohols are considered the main sensitisers in lanolin but whether they are the sole sensitisers, needs further investigation. Nowadays there is also chemically modified lanolin that may be less sensitising than natural lanolin. Wool alcohols, wool fat, <b>anhydrous</b> <b>lanolin,</b> lanolin alcohol, wool wax and wool grease {{are just some of}} the terms used interchangeably with lanolin. In this article we will use wool alcohols, as it is this fraction of lanolin that is the main cause of contact allergies. What products contain wool alcohols? Lanolin is a good emulsifier; this means it binds well with water thus it is particularly useful in the manufacture of pharmaceutical and cosmetic formulations. Wool alcohols are found in many pharmaceutical preparations, cosmetics and toiletries. They also have some industrial uses...|$|E
40|$|Sardinian folk {{medicine}} {{has given rise}} to a renewed interest in treatment of different diseases, particularly skin burns and inflammatory disorders. Rubus ulmifolius Schott shoots have been used to treat burns of different degree. During this work, a new and more effective extraction method was developed using olive oil at room temperature for 10 days. The R. ulmifolius oleolite components were mainly represented by polyphenolic compounds and tannins. To obtain a suitable topical formulation, the Rubus oleolite was incorporated in an ointment composed of <b>anhydrous</b> <b>lanolin,</b> white wax, olive oil, and Europhea oil unsaponifiables. Both R. ulmifolius oleolite and ointment were able to scavenge DPPH free radicals in vitro in a way very similar to quercetin, used as reference. In addition, R. ulmifolius ointments were biocompatible in vitro on 3 T 3 fibroblasts and did not cause any malformation or cell degeneration. Moreover, in vivo studies on Sprague-Dawley rats confirmed the ability of Rubus ointment to improve skin regeneration after burns...|$|E
40|$|Painful and/or damaged nipples {{associated}} with breastfeeding are common and represent {{a challenge for}} both the mothers experiencing nipple pain and/or trauma and for those providing treatment. However, evidence-based data has been insufficient to demonstrably minimize these common reasons for failure to initiate or continue successful breastfeeding. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the efficacy of specific-grade highly purified <b>anhydrous</b> <b>lanolin</b> (hpa lanolin) versus expressed breastmilk (EBM) for the treatment of painful and damaged nipples {{associated with}} breastfeeding in a prospective controlled clinical trial evaluating 84 lactating mothers. Nipple trauma and healing rates were rated by the Nipple Trauma Score. Nipple pain intensity was assessed on a 11 -point Numeric Rating Scale (NRS). Treatment duration was 14 days. Outcome parameters were in favor of the HPA lanolin group, reaching statistical significance for healing rates, nipple trauma and nipple pain. In our study, we found HPA lanolin more effective than EBM, inducing faster healing of nipple trauma (absolute risk reduction of 0. 43) and reducing nipple pain (absolute risk reduction of 0. 61 on day 3) withion a period of 14 days after the commencement of nipple pain. We concluded that HPA lanolin, combined with breastfeeding education, was more effective than EBM, combined with breastfeeding education, in reducing nipple pain and promoting healing of nipple trauma. Follow-up on breastfeeding status revealed no statistically significant difference in breastfeeding rates between the two groups at 32 weeks postpartum...|$|E
