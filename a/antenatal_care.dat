25|$|Pregnant {{teenagers}} face many of {{the same}} issues of childbirth as women in their 20s and 30s. However, there are additional medical concerns for younger mothers, particularly those under 15 and those living in developing countries. For example, obstetric fistula is a particular issue for very young mothers in poorer regions. For mothers between 15 and 19, risks are associated more with socioeconomic factors than with the biological effects of age. However, research has shown that the risk of low birth weight is connected to the biological age itself, as it was observed in teen births even after controlling for other risk factors (such as utilisation of <b>antenatal</b> <b>care</b> etc.).|$|E
25|$|In 2002, {{there were}} 0.58 new general {{practitioner}} (medical) consultations and 0.33 new specialist consultations per capita, and a hospital admission rate of 8.1%.

All children under one have access to well-baby clinics, and the immunization coverage rate in 2002 was above 91% for all antigens. Costa Rica has a very low malaria incidence of 48 per 100,000 in 2000 and no reported cases of measles in 2002.

25|$|This lack of {{deworming}} {{of pregnant}} women is {{explained by the fact}} that most individuals still fear that anthelmintic treatment will result in adverse birth outcomes. But a 2006 study by Gyorkos et al. found that when comparing a group {{of pregnant women}} treated with mebendazole with a control placebo group, both illustrated rather similar rates in adverse birth outcomes. The treated group demonstrated 5.6% adverse birth outcomes, while the control group had 6.25% adverse birth outcomes. Furthermore, Larocque et al. illustrated that treatment for hookworm infection actually led to positive health results in the infant. This study concluded that treatment with mebendazole plus iron supplements during <b>antenatal</b> <b>care</b> significantly reduced the proportion of very low birth weight infants when compared to a placebo control group.

25|$|The National Supplementary Food Program was {{extended}} to all primary school and to all pregnant women, regardless of their employment or income condition.

Apart from the existing Supply and Prices councils (community-based bodies which controlled the distribution of essential groups in working-class districts, and were a popular, not government, initiative), community-based distribution centers and shops were developed, which sold directly in working-class neighborhoods. The Allende Government felt obliged to increase its intervention in marketing activities, and state involvement in grocery distribution reached 33%. The CUT (central labor confederation) was accorded legal recognition, and its membership grew from 700,000 to almost 1million.

25|$|It is {{estimated}} {{that a third of}} all pregnant women in developing countries are infected with hookworm, 56% of all pregnant women in developing countries suffer from anemia, 20% of all maternal deaths are either directly or indirectly related to anemia. Numbers like this have led to an increased interest in the topic of hookworm-related anemia during pregnancy. With the understanding that chronic hookworm infection can often lead to anemia, many people are now questioning if the treatment of hookworm could effect change in severe anemia rates and thus also on maternal and child health as well. Most evidence suggests that the contribution of hookworm to maternal anemia merits that all women of child-bearing age living in endemic areas be subject to periodic anthelmintic treatment. The World Health Organization even recommends that infected pregnant women be treated after their first trimester. Regardless of these suggestions, only Madagascar, Nepal and Sri Lanka have added deworming to their <b>antenatal</b> <b>care</b> programs.|$|E

Studies {{suggest that the}} participation of men in <b>antenatal</b> and delivery <b>care</b> is associated with better health care seeking behaviour, yet many reproductive health programs do not facilitate their involvement. This qualitative study conducted in rural Western Kenya, explored men's perceptions of <b>antenatal</b> and delivery <b>care</b> services and identified factors that facilitated or constrained their involvement. Eight focus group discussions were conducted with 68 married men between 20 - 65 years of age in May 2011. Participants were of the Luo ethnic group residing in Asembo, western Kenya. The area has a high HIV-prevalence and polygamy is common. A topic guide was used to guide the discussions and a thematic framework approach for data analysis. Overall, men were positive in their views of <b>antenatal</b> and delivery <b>care,</b> as decision makers they often encouraged, some even 'forced', their wives to attend for <b>antenatal</b> or delivery <b>care.</b> Many reasons why it was beneficial to accompany their wives were provided, yet few did this in practice unless there was a clinical complication. The three main barriers relating to cultural norms identified were: 1) pregnancy support was considered a female role; and the male role that of provider; 2) negative health care worker attitudes towards men's participation, and 3) couple unfriendly antenatal and delivery unit infrastructure.

500|$|Improvements in {{maternal}} health, {{in addition}} to professional assistance at delivery, will require routine <b>antenatal</b> <b>care,</b> basic emergency obstetric care, including the availability of antibiotics, oxytocics, anticonvulsants, the ability to manually remove a retained placenta, perform instrumented deliveries, and postpartum care.

40|$|The primary {{intention}} {{of this work}} {{is to provide a}} starting point for a realisation of an electronic antenatal health record in Norway. Furthermore, the ambition was to conduction an evaluation into the potential for using archetypes for representation of structured clinical information in <b>antenatal</b> health <b>care</b> in Norway. Focus of work has been to investigate former projects in electronic solutions for antenatal health records, to gain knowledge of earlier practical experiences regarding development of archetypes and finally how lessons learnt in both can be applicable and utilised in the development of an electronic <b>antenatal</b> health <b>care</b> record in Norway. To answer these questions a qualitative case study has been performed including a literature review and interviews with informants acting within <b>antenatal</b> health <b>care.</b> As a proof-of-concept for direct reuse of formerly developed archetypes, candidate archetypes have been translated and a template has been designed. In addition all candidate archetypes have been evaluated as to clinical content coverage as regards Norwegian requirements, as well as thoroughly assessed utilising published Archetype Quality Requirements. Through this qualitative case study I have learnt the importance of involving all stakeholders as early as possible in development projects in general as in archetype development specifically. It is also important to sustain stakeholder involvement throughout the development cycle to ensure that the interests of all stakeholders are met. The in-depth validation of clinical content in candidate archetypes shows that Norwegian requirements for clinical content in <b>antenatal</b> health <b>care</b> records are met. Furthermore, the in depth validation of the quality of archetypes has resulted in significant findings for Norwegian stakeholders in antenatal health care; a thorough investigation and clarification process regarding intended use of an electronic <b>antenatal</b> health <b>care</b> record has to be initiated and concluded before development activities can commence. The need for stakeholder inclusion in a development project is also identified for antenatal health records. The identification of clinical content provided by the present project {{can be seen as a}} first step in the development of a Norwegian antenatal health record. There has also been identified significant findings regarding how translation of archetypes can be facilitated; by establishing a demonstration archetype including most commonly utilised terms in archetypes, in order to secure consistent translations with good quality in all archetypes. Finally, the in-depth evaluation regarding the metadata quality in archetypes has provided significant results with proposals for additions, specifications and needed alterations of the Archetype Quality Requirements that are published by Kalra et al (2012). To my knowledge, no other project has utilised and thoroughly evaluated these quality requirements. </p...|$|R

Many countries routinely give Anti-D to Rhesus D negative women in pregnancy. In other countries, stocks of Anti-D can run short or even run out. Before Anti-D is made routine in these countries, stocks should be readily available so that it is available for women who need Anti-D in an emergency situation.|$|E
