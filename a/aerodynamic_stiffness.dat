40|$|AbstractIn flutter {{wind tunnel}} test, the {{matching}} degree between scaled model and prototype would directly affect {{the reliability of}} test results. It is difficult to achieve completely dynamic similarity because of some material or technological constrains, and only lower order modes including mode shape and frequency are accurately simulated to construct a compromised model. Theoretical support {{would be necessary to}} answer the question which modes must be simulated to guarantee data validity of wind tunnel flutter test. An analytical study of a sweepback winghas been undertaken to estimate the flutter influence mode needed for accurate flutter prediction by analyzing generalized <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>stiffness</b> coefficient, unsteady aerodynamic force and flutter results.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} active {{suppression}} of nonlinear panel flutter {{in the high}} supersonic and hypersonic flow regime. Dynamic feedback control methods are applied to adaptive panels using piezoelectric actuators and sensors. The investigations comprise modeling and discretization of the coupled electromechanical/aeroelastic problem as well as control feedback design and numerical simualtions. The panel is modeled as a con Karman plate with pre-deformations to account for geometrical imperfections. Composite structures with piezoelectric material layers are described using classical laminate theory. Aerodynamic loads are based on linear and nonlinear piston theory. Using the Finite Element Method, discrete equations of motion are derived. Flutter analysis techniques are briefly discussed and applied to two- and three-dimensional expamples. Standard state feedback control methods are investigated as candidates for panel flutter suppression. They are based on reduced modal representations of the panel linearized about its undeflected position. For direct state feedback the modal states must be known from sensor measurements. In this case a linear optimal regulator yields robust closed-loop systems. As an alternative, linear state observers are applied. Control designs based on the Linear Quadratic Gaussian / Loop Transfer Recovery and the Normalized Left Coprime Factorization methodologies are presented. They exhibit poor robustness properties {{in the face of}} parametric uncertainties such as structural nonlinearity of flight parameter variations. To avoid these disadvantages a novel output feedback approach is proposed based on collocated actuator/sensor pairs. It is designed to compensate destabilizing <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>stiffness</b> terms, whence follows its name ACAS (Active Compensation of <b>Aerodynamic</b> <b>Stiffness).</b> ACAS control is found to be robust regarding geometric structural nonlinearity and flight parameter variations. Due to its simple feedback scheme it can be implemented using an analog circuit. Two- and three-dimensional ACAS design examples are presented. Further robustness investigations include the influences of static pressure differentials, static membrane loads, geometric imperfections, in-flow angle variations, and nonlinear aerodynamic effects. An ACAS design window for rectangular panels is determined numerically. (orig.)

40|$|The {{modeling}} of aircraft wing flutter using statically determined aerodynamic derivatives may not accurately represent the actual aeroelastic system. This paper presents an experimental method for estimating the transient aerodynamic derivatives {{relative to the}} airspeed for four 3 D airfoil models. The transient aerodynamic derivatives are used to represent the <b>aerodynamic</b> damping and <b>stiffness</b> in aeroelastic equation of motion to determine the flutter speed of the models. An oscillating dynamic aeroelastic test rig with constraint to pitch motion is developed for the wind tunnel test. A set of wing models with NACA 0010, NACA 0012, NACA 0014 and NACA 0018 airfoils respectively, with a wing span of 0. 36 m and chord of 0. 16 m (i. e. AR= 2. 25) are tested in UTM Low Speed Tunnel with the reduced frequencies range from 0. 04 to 0. 4. From the experiment, the time responses of the wing models during wind-off and wind-on conditions allow the transient <b>aerodynamic</b> damping and <b>stiffness</b> of the wing aeroelastic system to be determined. By varying the stiffness of the mechanical springs attached to the test rig, the effects of dynamically determined <b>aerodynamic</b> damping and <b>stiffness</b> on aircraft wing flutter speed prediction are observed. It is discovered that the aeroelastic equation of motion gives more realistic flutter speed estimation of the models with the inclusion of <b>aerodynamic</b> damping and <b>stiffness</b> {{with respect to the}} airspeed which can not be determined from static test. The differences between the computed wing flutter speeds and the referred wing flutter speeds show that this method gives better estimation of aircraft wing flutter speed for both thin and thick airfoils compared to Theodorsen’s method...|$|R

This method is based on the derivation of the singular contributions of the leading edge and ridges (points where the air-foil boundary conditions change) in the solutions of the uid velocity and pressure coef cient. The method has been validated by comparison with the results obtained by Theodorsen and by Postel and Leppert for rigid air-foil and aileron oscillations in translation and rotation.

40|$|The {{stiffness}} of contacting shaft seals such as brush seals and leaf seals is a required characteristic to accurately predict their performance {{and life in}} the gas turbine engine. This paper describes {{the results of a}} test campaign in which a series of eccentric rotor excursions are applied at low rotational speed and engine representative pressure differences to characterise the behaviour of a prototype leaf seal. A phenomenon that may best be described as negative seal stiffness is reported. Here, the displacement of the seal rotor to an eccentric position causes a resultant force, which, rather than trying to return the rotor to a central position, acts to amplify its displacement. These data were used to develop an empirical model of the seal behaviour. It was possible to model the negative stiffness phenomenon and show that it is caused by a combination of two effects: the inherent mechanical {{stiffness of}} the leaf pack, and the <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>stiffness</b> of the seal.

40|$|Launch {{vehicles}} frequently {{experience a}} reduced stability margin through the transonic Mach number range. This reduced stability margin {{can be caused}} by the aerodynamic undamping one of the lower-frequency flexible or rigid body modes. Analysis of the behavior of a flexible vehicle is routinely performed with quasi-steady aerodynamic line loads derived from steady rigid aerodynamics. However, a quasi-steady aeroelastic stability analysis can be unconservative at the critical Mach numbers, where experiment or unsteady computational aeroelastic analysis show a reduced or even negative aerodynamic damping. Amethod of enhancing the quasi-steady aeroelastic stability analysis of a launch vehicle with unsteady aerodynamics is developed that uses unsteady computational fluid dynamics to compute the response of selected lower-frequency modes. The response is contained in a time history of the vehicle line loads. A proper orthogonal decomposition of the unsteady aerodynamic line-load response is used to reduce the scale of data volume and system identification is used to derive the <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>stiffness,</b> damping, and mass matrices. The results are compared with the damping and frequency computed from unsteady computational aeroelasticity and from a quasi-steady analysis.

[...] University of Washington, 2016 - 06 The thesis {{presents}} {{the development of}} a new fully-integrated, MATLAB based simulation capability for aeroservoelastic (ASE) uncertainty analysis that accounts for uncertainties in all disciplines as well as discipline interactions. This new capability allows probabilistic studies of complex configuration at a scope and with depth not known before. Several statistical tools and methods have been integrated into the capability to guide the tasks such as parameter prioritization, uncertainty reduction, and risk mitigation. The first task of the thesis focuses on aeroservoelastic uncertainty assessment considering control component uncertainty. The simulation has shown that attention has to be paid, if notch filters are used in the aeroservoelastic loop, to the variability and uncertainties of the aircraft involved. The second task introduces two innovative methodologies to characterize the unsteady aerodynamic uncertainty. One is a physically based aerodynamic influence coefficients element by element correction uncertainty scheme and the other is an alternative approach focusing on rational function approximation matrix uncertainties to evaluate the relative impact of uncertainty in <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>stiffness,</b> damping, inertia, or lag terms. Finally, the capability has been applied to obtain the gust load response statistics accounting for uncertainties in both aircraft and gust profiles. The gust response analysis shows a significant increase of the critical loads when system’s uncertainties are included. The work is expected to make a contribution to the understanding of the propagation of uncertainty and the resulting reliability of realistic integrated aeroservoelastic system inherent in real modern aircraft. This work will motivate more research in the aeroservoelastic uncertainty area regarding both methods development in general and reliability studies of different configurations of interest.

Various aeroelastic {{models have been}} used to investigate the free vibration and forced response problems of mistuned bladed disks. Most of these models used simplified structural and/or aerodynamic models. The traditional way to incorporate the aerodynamic coupling in the high-fidelity structuralmodels is to use the cantilever-blade normalmodes to calculate the unsteady aerodynamic forces. In this paper, a new reduced-order modeling approach is developed by using the tuned system modes to calculate the unsteady aerodynamic forces directly. This new approach is applied to an industrial rotor. The results show that aerodynamic coupling has significant effects on the vibration of bladed disks for the case studied. Also, constraint modes are needed to yield accurate results if cantilever-blade normal modes are used to calculate the unsteady aerodynamic forces.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} a Pivot Mode Activator System (PMA) for the measurement of motion-induced forces on wind tunnel models of tall structures. The impetus for this was the desire to refine the established base balance wind tunnel technique of predicting wind loads. The system developed forces a sinusoidal oscillation of the test model in a pivoting mode about its base at controlled amplitude and frequency. The wind forces acting on the model are measured, and the motion-induced forces are extracted by correlating the total force with the motion. In this way, both the in-phase and out-of-phase components of the motion-induced forces are distinguished. These quantities are denoted by a complex aerodynamic impedance whose real and imaginary parts correspond to <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>stiffness</b> and damping parameters.;As a demonstration of the use of the system, two substantial experimental studies have been carried out. The first is a comprehensive study of a square prism. This study provides extensive data on the aerodynamic impedance for tip oscillation amplitudes less than about 15 % of the model width. The effects of varying the turbulence intensity of the wind and the aspect ratio of the model are also investigated. To complement these results, additional experiments have been carried out for the same model shape. These include forced oscillation experiments on a pressure model which provide information about the spatial and spectral distribution of the forces, as well as free oscillation experiments on several aeroelastic model structures. Rms response predictions based on base balance data, augmented with the measured data on motion-induced forces, are found to agree very well with the corresponding results from an aeroelastic model test.;The second experimental study involved base balance experiments and PMA experiments on various cross-sectional shapes. This study provides a large data set, which along with some judicious interpolation, is expected to be of valuable use to designers of tall chimneys.;The Pivot Mode Activator System has surpassed the initial design expectations.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this master thesis is to develop and {{evaluate}} a novel approach for performing structural reliability analysis and robust design of offshore wind turbine support structures. Offshore wind turbines are structures especially prone to uncertainties due to its exposure to environmental conditions. Therefore, the models that take into account probabilistic descriptions of variability are more natural approaches. In this sense, a structural reliability analysis and a robust design are two complementary approaches that allow for incorporating uncertainty and randomness in the design process. To achieve {{the objective of this}} study, it has been developed a simplified model of a monopile structure that allows for doing the necessary calculations efficiently. The simplified model is implemented as a time-domain simulation in MATLAB and allows to solve the transient dynamics of a beam. In parallel, the rotor loads are obtained from rotor simulations in FEDEM Windpower software. Uncertainty is studied in the following system parameters: <b>aerodynamic</b> damping, soil <b>stiffness</b> and cross section of the support structure. Simple probability distributions are used in order to describe the uncertainty on these parameters. The basis of the research is a probability analysis based on several approaches. First, it is raised an individual analysis for each system parameter and wind speed. Secondly, the way used to add the aerodynamic damping in the simplified model has given rise to two different analyses. The effect of the soil stiffness and the structure cross section is investigated through a correlated and uncorrelated sampling of both variables. Finally, a combined probability analysis is performed in order to observe the effect of analysing the three system parameters at the same time. Additionally, the reference offshore wind turbine is also analysed in order to enable evaluate the effects of the other analyses. The probabilistic analysis is performed with a variable number of samples and the displacements at the tower top and the bending moments at the mud-line of the structure are obtained as a result. These outputs are used to evaluate the equivalent fatigue damage of the support structure. The wind turbine considered is the 5 -MW NREL, with the reference support structure defined in the OC 3 project. The results show that the response of the proposed simplified model is significantly different depending on the system parameter. The soil <b>stiffness</b> and the <b>aerodynamic</b> damping have shown a weak effect on the response of the structure. The reason could be an underestimation of the uncertainties associated to these parameters. Conversely, the structure cross section has shown a greater impact, probably due to dynamic amplifications linked to resonance problems. The uncorrelated analysis of the soil stiffness and the structure cross section has shown the greater effects on the response of the structure, given that the sampling approach of this case leads to a greater scattering of the system parameters and, consequently, of the results...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} studies {{three aspects}} of airfoil flows: (i) second-order theoretical solutions of airfoils in steady flows; (ii) unsteady solutions for oscillating flexible airfoils; and (iii) numerical analysis of airfoil flows at low Reynolds numbers. The first part presents simple and efficient analytical solutions in closed {{form for the}} velocity and pressure distributions on airfoils of arbitrary shapes in steady flows, which are obtained using special singularities in {{the expression of the}} fluid velocity. A second-order accurate method is first developed for airfoils in inviscid incompressible flows to simultaneously solve the symmetric and anti-symmetric flow components defined by coupled boundary conditions. Then, the method is extended {{to take into account the}} viscous and compressibility effects on the pressure distribution. The resulting solutions were found to be in very good agreement with the available exact solutions (for specific airfoils), and with numerical and experimental results at various Mach and Reynolds numbers and moderate angles of attack. The second part presents a new method of solution for the analysis of unsteady incompressible flows past oscillating rigid and flexible airfoils. The method has been successfully validated by comparison with the results obtained by Theodorsen and by Postel and Leppert for rigid airfoil and aileron oscillations in translation and rotation. The <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>stiffness,</b> damping and virtual mass contributions are specifically determined, as required in the aeroelastic studies. In all cases studied, this method led to very efficient and simple analytical solutions in closed form. The third part presents an efficient numerical method for the incompressible flows past airfoils at low Reynolds numbers, which are of interest for micro-aircraft applications. The present analysis is based on a pseudo-time integration method using artificial compressibility to accurately solve the Navier-Stokes equations. Solutions are obtained with this method for airfoils at various incidences and very low Reynolds numbers between 400 and 6000. A detailed analysis is presented for the influence of the Reynolds number, incidence and airfoil shape on the pressure distribution, lift and drag coefficients. The flow separation is especially studied; the separation and reattachment positions are compared for various airfoil shapes, incidences and Reynolds numbers...|$|E
