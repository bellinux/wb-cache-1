5|$|Tropical Depression Sixteen-E {{formed from}} a {{disturbance}} in the intertropical convergence zone. Despite being located in <b>a</b> <b>hostile</b> <b>environment,</b> it managed to organize into a tropical depression on November 14. It was briefly forecast to strengthen into a tropical storm. However, wind shear prevented that from occurring. Consequently, the depression degenerated into a remnant low on November 16 and dissipated soon after that.|$|E

5|$|An area of {{disturbed}} weather near Panama {{drifted to}} a location south of Puerto Ángel, Oaxaca, and organized into Tropical Depression Four-E on July 9. It moved westward through <b>a</b> <b>hostile</b> <b>environment</b> of strong shear. The wind shear disrupted the cyclone's convection and weakened its circulation. Despite the shear, the depression strengthened into {{a tropical storm}} early on July 12 and was named Cristina. This broke down the steering ridge, and Cristina turned {{to the north and}} peaked on July 14. Then, the wind shear won out and Cristina quickly weakened. Cristina dissipated into a swirl of clouds on July 16, without ever threatening land. No impact was reported.|$|E
5|$|Edward VI acceded to the English throne in 1547, and the Protestant reformers there {{hoped to}} take the {{opportunity}} to more thoroughly reform the Church of England. Archbishop Thomas Cranmer invited Vermigli and Ochino to assist in the effort. In addition, the victory of Catholic Emperor Charles V in the Schmalkaldic War and the resulting Augsburg Interim led to <b>a</b> <b>hostile</b> <b>environment</b> for Protestants in Germany. Vermigli accepted the invitation in November and sailed with Ochino to England. In 1548, he replaced Richard Smyth, becoming the second Regius Professor of Divinity at Oxford. This was a very influential post at a university which had been slow to accept reform.|$|E
5|$|The {{role of the}} sea {{in human}} culture has been {{important}} for centuries, as people experience the sea in contradictory ways: as powerful but serene, beautiful but dangerous. Human responses to the sea {{can be found in}} artforms including literature, art, poetry, film, theatre, and classical music. The earliest art representing boats is 40,000 years old. Since then, artists in different countries and cultures have depicted the sea. Symbolically, the sea has been perceived as <b>a</b> <b>hostile</b> <b>environment</b> populated by fantastic creatures: the Leviathan of the Bible, Isonade in Japanese mythology, and the kraken of late Norse mythology. In the works of the psychiatrist Carl Jung, the sea symbolises the personal and the collective unconscious in dream interpretation.|$|E

5|$|Under {{the command}} of Colonel C. Craig Cannon, the Brigade {{prepared}} for deployment to Vietnam. The Advance Party of the 18th Engineer Brigade arrived at Saigon's Tan Son Nhut Air Base on 3 September 1965. Three days later, Brigadier General Robert R. Ploger assumed command of the Brigade. Within two weeks, the Brigade Headquarters at Tan Son Nhut was fully operational. It had been preceded by the 35th Engineer Group, which built Cam Ranh Bay on a peninsula of sand and in <b>a</b> <b>hostile</b> <b>environment.</b> The brigade assumed responsibility for I Corps and II Corps {{in the northern part}} of South Vietnam.

5|$|During the 1920s, Mexico {{underwent}} {{a period of}} instability under the Plutarco Elías Calles administration who was seeking to limit {{the influence of the}} Catholic Church to modernize and centralize the state within the religious sphere of Mexican society. To protest the policies, the Catholic Church suspended all religious services, bringing about an uprising in Mexico. This uprising, or Cristero War, lasted from 1926 to 1929 and reemerged in the 1930s. On April 6, 1926 González had a vision in which God changed his name from Eusebio to Aarón and was later told to leave Monterrey where he and his wife served Saulo and Silas. On his journey, he preached near the entrances of Catholic churchesoften facing religious persecutionuntil he arrived at Guadalajara on December 12, 1926. The Cristero Wars impacted both Catholic and non-Catholic congregations and preachers, especially evangelical movements. Small movements were attacked by the government and the Cristeros, resulting in <b>a</b> <b>hostile</b> <b>environment</b> for González's work.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights {{released}} an advisory opinion {{calling for an}} end to the use of Native American images and team names by non-Native schools. While recognizing the right to freedom of expression, the commission also recognizes those Native Americans and civil rights advocates that maintain these mascots, by promoting stereotypes, may violate anti-discrimination laws. When found in educational institutions, mascots may also create <b>a</b> <b>hostile</b> <b>environment</b> inconsistent with learning to respect diverse cultures, but instead teach that stereotypes that misrepresent a minority group are permissible. Those schools that claim that their sports imagery stimulate interest in Native American culture have not listened to Native groups and civil rights leaders who point out that even purportedly positive stereotypes both present a false portrayal of the past and prevent understanding of contemporary Native people as fellow Americans.|$|E

5|$|While {{these events}} progressed Queen Mary {{had been raised}} as a Catholic in France, and married to the Dauphin, who became king as Francis II in 1559, making her queen consort of France. When Francis died in 1560, Mary, now 19, elected to return to Scotland {{to take up the}} {{government}} in <b>a</b> <b>hostile</b> <b>environment.</b> Despite her private religion, she did not attempt to re-impose Catholicism on her largely Protestant subjects, thus angering the chief Catholic nobles. Her six-year personal reign was marred by a series of crises, largely caused by the intrigues and rivalries of the leading nobles. The murder of her secretary, David Riccio, was followed by that of her unpopular second husband Lord Darnley, father of her infant son, and her abduction by and marriage to the Earl of Bothwell, who was implicated in Darnley's murder.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, {{a team of}} {{scientists}} led by Owen Beattie, a professor of anthropology at the University of Alberta, began a series of scientific studies of the graves, bodies, and other physical evidence left by Franklin's men on Beechey Island and King William Island. They concluded that the men buried on Beechey Island most likely died of pneumonia and perhaps tuberculosis, and that lead poisoning may have worsened their health, owing to badly soldered cans held in the ships' food stores. However, it was later suggested that the source of this lead may not have been tinned food, but the distilled water systems fitted to the ships. Cut marks on human bones found on King William Island were seen as signs of cannibalism. The combined evidence of all studies suggested that the crewmen did not all die quickly. Hypothermia, starvation, lead poisoning and diseases including scurvy, along with general exposure to <b>a</b> <b>hostile</b> <b>environment</b> whilst lacking adequate clothing and nutrition, killed everyone on the expedition in the years following its last sighting by Europeans in 1845.|$|E

25|$|The Soviets {{had been}} working on early warning radar for their anti-ballistic missile systems through the 1960s, but most of these had been {{line-of-sight}} systems that were useful for raid analysis and interception only. None of these systems had the capability to provide early warning of a launch, within seconds or minutes of a launch, which would give the defences time to study the attack and plan a response. At the time, the Soviet early-warning satellite network was not well developed, and there were questions about their ability to operate in <b>a</b> <b>hostile</b> <b>environment</b> including anti-satellite efforts. An over-the-horizon radar sited in the USSR would not have any of these problems, and work on such a system for this associated role started in the late 1960s.|$|E
25|$|As Kong-rey {{began to}} take a turn {{to the north and}} east, it {{developed}} a ragged 16 nm (30km, 18mi)-wide eye. Operationally, its peak was estimated at 165km/h (105mph), though in post-season analysis, it was considered to have reached peak winds of 185km/h (115mph). It strengthened slightly further before encountering strong wind shear and colder sea surface temperatures, causing core convection to rapidly weaken, and was downgraded back to a severe tropical storm on April 4. As Kong-rey accelerated towards the northeast, it encountered <b>a</b> <b>hostile</b> <b>environment</b> related to a midlatitude trough.

However, Spanish colonization and attempts to enslave women, men, and children to work the silver-rich mines quickly created <b>a</b> <b>hostile</b> <b>environment</b> with the Chichimeca Confederation natives. The Chichimecas began defending invasion into their ancestral lands against Spanish Soldiers and colonizers and in 1551, the Guamare people of the Chichimeca Confederation attacked Spanish military posts and settlements in response to the tyrannical regime being built in San Miguel. This and continuous failed attempts by the Spanish to provide water to their own settlements in the area caused the original location to be pushed out.|$|E
