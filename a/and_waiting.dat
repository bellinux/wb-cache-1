5|$|In 1977, after {{a fire in}} March 1976, Amtrak {{undertook}} a $314,000 rehabilitation of the station. The roof and portico were rebuilt, {{two of the three}} dormers removed, new restrooms added, and the platform <b>and</b> <b>waiting</b> room repaired. The loggia, windows, and other openings were covered with cinderblocks and brick.|$|E
5|$|Spiders {{have been}} the focus of stories and mythologies of various {{cultures}} for centuries. They have symbolized patience due to their hunting technique of setting webs <b>and</b> <b>waiting</b> for prey, as well as mischief and malice due to their venomous bites. The Italian tarantella is a dance to rid the young woman of the lustful effects of a spider bite.|$|E

5|$|After {{receiving}} reinforcements, the British {{attempted to}} make a surprise attack on Pontiac's encampment. But Pontiac was ready <b>and</b> <b>waiting,</b> and defeated them at the Battle of Bloody Run on July 31, 1763. Nevertheless, the situation at Fort Detroit remained a stalemate, and Pontiac's influence among his followers began to wane. Groups of Native Americans began to abandon the siege, some of them making peace with the British before departing. On October 31, 1763, finally convinced that the French in Illinois would not come to his aid at Detroit, Pontiac lifted the siege and removed to the Maumee River, where he continued his efforts to rally resistance against the British.|$|E
5|$|At some U.S. {{international}} airports, such as O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, some seating <b>and</b> <b>waiting</b> {{areas are}} {{located away from}} the terminal building, with passengers being shuttled to terminals. These areas may {{be referred to as}} ground transportation centers or intermodal centers. Amenities at ground transportation centers typically include restrooms and seating, and may also provide ticket counters, food and beverage sales and retail goods such as magazines. Some ground transportation centers have heating and air conditioning and covered boarding areas (to protect passengers from the elements).|$|E
5|$|Columbia City station {{consists}} of two at-grade side platforms in the median of Martin Luther King Jr. Way between Edmunds and Alaska streets. The station is accessible from crosswalks at both streets, with the platforms running the entire length between the two. At both of the station's entrances are ticket vending machines and an ORCA card reader; beyond that lies the partially covered platform <b>and</b> <b>waiting</b> area, which includes seating and public art. The station, like others in the Rainier Valley, was designed by architecture firm Arai/Jackson, and incorporates references to Craftsman-style homes that populate the neighborhood.|$|E
40|$|Delay Tolerant Networks or Disruption Tolerant Networks are {{intermittent}} {{networks that}} may lack continuous connectivity {{as most of}} the time there does not exist a direct link between source and destination for message transmission. In this paper, Modified DNH (Different Neighbor-History) Spray <b>and</b> <b>Wait</b> using PROPHET is proposed.

5|$|In April 1958, S. Gill (Ferranti) {{discussed}} {{parallel programming}} {{and the need}} for branching <b>and</b> <b>waiting.</b> Also in 1958, IBM researchers John Cocke and Daniel Slotnick discussed the use of parallelism in numerical calculations for the first time. Burroughs Corporation introduced the D825 in 1962, a four-processor computer that accessed up to 16 memory modules through a crossbar switch. In 1967, Amdahl and Slotnick published a debate about the feasibility of parallel processing at American Federation of Information Processing Societies Conference. It was during this debate that Amdahl's law was coined to define the limit of speed-up due to parallelism.|$|E

5|$|The {{character}} of Barton Fink is {{loosely based on}} Clifford Odets, a playwright from New York who in the 1930s joined the Group Theatre, a gathering of dramatists which included Harold Clurman, Cheryl Crawford, and Lee Strasberg. Their work emphasized social issues and employed Stanislavski's system of acting to recreate human experience as truthfully as possible. Several of Odets' plays were successfully performed on Broadway, including Awake and Sing! <b>and</b> <b>Waiting</b> for Lefty (both in 1935). When public tastes turned away from politically engaged theatre and toward the familial realism of Eugene O'Neill, Odets had difficulty producing successful work, so he moved to Hollywood and spent 20 years writing film scripts.|$|E

When employed as a shop assistant, Louis's suit was ill-fitting and drab; he is later seen in tailored suits with satin lapels, wearing a brocade dressing gown <b>and</b> <b>waiting</b> for his execution in a quilted-collar velvet jacket. Mendleson later recounted that to dress Guinness in his many roles, the costumes were of less importance than make-up and the actor's nuances.|$|E

40|$|Delay Tolerant Networks (DTN) are mobile ad-hoc {{networks}} in which connections are often disruptive or discontinuous. Data forwarding using an appropriate routing strategy {{is a highly}} confronting issue in such networks. The traditional ad-hoc routing protocols which require end-to-end connectivity fail to function here due to frequent occurrences of network partitions. Spray <b>and</b> <b>Wait</b> (SaW) routing algorithm is a popular controlled replication based DTN protocol which provides a better delivery performance balancing the average delay and overhead ratio. An empirical analysis of various spray based approaches that have been proposed for DTN has been performed in this paper to compare and evaluate the basic Spray <b>and</b> <b>Wait</b> algorithms (Source Spray <b>and</b> <b>Wait</b> <b>and</b> Binary Spray <b>and</b> <b>Wait)</b> with some of its major improvements (Spray and Focus, Average Delivery Probability Binary Spray <b>and</b> <b>Wait</b> <b>and</b> Composite methods to improve Spray <b>and</b> <b>Wait).</b> The main aim of this comparative study is to verify the effect of utility metrics in spray based routing protocols over simple spray based approaches. The ONE simulator {{has been used to}} provide a simulation environment to evaluate these algorithms and generate results. The performance metrics used are delivery ratio (DR), overhead ratio (OR) and average latency (ALat). The simulation results show that in terms of delivery ratio and average latency, Composite methods to improve Spray <b>and</b> <b>Wait</b> which incorporates delivery predictability metric in the <b>wait</b> phase <b>and</b> also acknowledgements to delete already delivered messages from a node’s buffer, outperforms all the other variants compared...|$|R

5|$|American kestrels feed {{largely on}} small {{animals such as}} grasshoppers, dragonflies, lizards, mice, voles, and small birds. The kestrel has also been {{reported}} to have killed snakes, bats, and squirrels. The kestrel is able to maintain high population densities, {{at least in part}} because of the broad scope of its diet. The American kestrel's primary mode of hunting is by perching <b>and</b> <b>waiting</b> for prey to come near. The bird is characteristically seen along roadsides or fields perched on objects such as trees, overhead power lines, or fence posts. It also hunts by kiting, hovering in the air with rapid wing beats and scanning the ground for prey. Other hunting techniques include low flight over fields, or chasing insects and birds in the air.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{privatisation}} of British Rail, {{the station}} operation {{was taken over}} by Railtrack, and later First North Western until 2004 when it {{was taken over by}} Northern. In 1996 Railtrack launched a £1billion programme to restore and renovate every station it operated. Cheadle Hulme had £1.2million spent on repairs to its platforms, buildings <b>and</b> <b>waiting</b> shelters, and new lighting installed throughout the station. Stephen Day, the Member of Parliament (MP) for Cheadle Hulme, opened the updated station in March 1998. The junction itself was revamped in 2000 and the signal box was removed, having been superseded by a central signalling point at Stockport station. In 2011, major work was carried out after years of campaigns, with the construction of pedestrian bridges connecting all four platforms, and lifts enabling disabled access to the platforms.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, {{finding a}} {{suitable}} adhesive {{was a significant}} problem. After unsuccessful experiments {{with a variety of}} candidates, somebody suggested birdlime – a viscous sticky compound used since ancient times to trap birds by spreading it on tree branches <b>and</b> <b>waiting</b> for birds to get stuck. Birdlime performed better than anything previously tested, but it was still not good enough. Macrae's tin of birdlime was labelled with a large letter 'K' and an indication that tin came from Stockport but with no more clues as to the manufacturer. Macrae got on a train to Stockport and there found a helpful taxi driver who took him to Kay Brothers Ltd. The company's Chief Chemist was soon working on the problem of a suitable adhesive and within a matter of weeks the problem was solved to Macrae's satisfaction.|$|E

The SA was reorganised, but with Franz Pfeffer von Salomon as its head rather than Göring, and the Schutzstaffel (SS) was founded in 1925, initially as a bodyguard for Hitler. Membership in the party increased from 27,000 in 1925 to 108,000 in 1928 and 178,000 in 1929. In the May 1928 elections the party only obtained twelve seats out of an available 491. Göring was elected as a representative from Bavaria. The Wall Street Crash of 1929 led to a disastrous downturn in the German economy, and in the next election, the NSDAP won 6,409,600 votes and 107 seats in the Reichstag. In May 1931, Hitler sent Göring on a mission to the Vatican, where he met the future Pope Pius XII.|$|E
