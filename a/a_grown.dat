5|$|Duncan's reign was not {{successful}} {{and he was}} killed by Macbeth on 15 August 1040. Although Shakespeare's Macbeth presents Malcolm as <b>a</b> <b>grown</b> man and his father as an old one, it appears that Duncan was still young in 1040, and Malcolm and his brother Donalbane were children. Malcolm's family did attempt to overthrow Macbeth in 1045, but Malcolm's grandfather Crínán of Dunkeld was killed in the attempt.|$|E
5|$|Henry was Catherine's {{favourite}} son. Unlike his brothers, {{he came to}} {{the throne}} as <b>a</b> <b>grown</b> man. He was also healthier, though he suffered from weak lungs and constant fatigue. His interest in the tasks of government, however, proved fitful. He depended on Catherine and her team of secretaries until the last few weeks of her life. He often hid from state affairs, immersing himself in acts of piety, such as pilgrimages and flagellation.|$|E

5|$|After {{four years}} of doing his {{residency}} in Singkawang, Borneo, Dr. Pardi (Adnan Kapau Gani) returns to Java to open a practice. Before then, he goes to Cigading to visit his family and give them souvenirs. Upon arrival he is stunned to find that his family's maid Tati (Djoewariah), who had been his childhood playmate, is now <b>a</b> <b>grown</b> and beautiful woman. He secretly begins to fawn over Tati, although he does not tell her the reason. When Pardi's mother tells him he should marry quickly, he refuses all of her suggested brides. He says only that he already has someone in mind, aware that his mother would never approve an inter-class marriage with the maid.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not always}} easy to predict <b>a</b> <b>grown</b> Appaloosa's color at birth. Foals of any breed tend to be born with coats that darken when they shed their baby hair. In addition, Appaloosa foals do not always show classic leopard complex characteristics. Patterns {{sometimes}} change {{over the course of the}} horse's life although some, such as the blanket and leopard patterns, tend to be stable. Horses with the varnish roan and snowflake patterns are especially prone to show very little color pattern at birth, developing more visible spotting as they get older.|$|E

40|$|Rabbit {{antiserum}} raised {{against the}} rough mutant of Escherichia coli O 111 :B 4, designated J 5, was examined for cross-reactivity to an E. coli clinical isolate (A 2385). In whole-cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, J 5 antiserum reacted {{to a greater}} extent with <b>A</b> 2385 <b>grown</b> for 5 h than with the same bacteria grown for 19 h, while the homologous antiserum reacted similarly with bacteria grown for different lengths of time. J 5 antiserum reacted to the greatest extent with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from <b>A</b> 2385 <b>grown</b> for up to 10 h, and reactivity greatly diminished thereafter; homologous antiserum showed no difference in reaction over time. LPS from smooth bacteria grown for 19 h showed no reaction with J 5 antiserum in immunoblots, while LPS from <b>A</b> 2385 <b>grown</b> for 5 or 10 h showed a positive reaction. Little or no difference among the three LPS samples could be seen when homologous antiserum was used. Mice vaccinated with J 5 LPS before lethal challenge with live A 2385 were protected from this challenge, whereas most nonimmunized mice died. Toxicity tests in mice showed LPS from <b>A</b> 2385 <b>grown</b> for 19 h to be twice as lethal as LPS from <b>A</b> 2385 <b>grown</b> for 3 h. Mice vaccinated with J 5 LPS were protected {{to a greater extent}} when challenged with a lethal dose of LPS from <b>A</b> 2385 <b>grown</b> for 3 h than when challenged with LPS from <b>A</b> 2385 <b>grown</b> for 19 h. The results reported here may explain the means by which J 5 vaccination (active or passive) sometimes protects against heterologous challenge...|$|R
5|$|Nala is {{introduced}} as the childhood best friend of Simba, and ultimately becomes his wife {{by the end}} of The Lion King. Several years after Simba's uncle Scar has killed Simba's father Mufasa and usurped the throne, Nala desperately ventures into the jungle to find help. Upon unexpectedly reuniting with <b>a</b> <b>grown</b> Simba, who she had long been tricked by Scar into presuming dead, Nala encourages him to return to Pride Rock, overthrow his uncle and ultimately become king. As Simba's queen, Nala has a daughter, Kiara, whose story is explored in The Lion King: Simba's Pride.|$|E
5|$|When {{investigating}} {{a case involving}} the murder of identical doctors, the agents come across a shapeshifting Alien Bounty Hunter (Brian Thompson) responsible for executing a series of alien clones. During this case <b>a</b> <b>grown</b> woman claiming to be Mulder's sister Samantha appears, telling Mulder of the Bounty Hunter's objectives and that she {{has the ability to}} identify him. When Scully is kidnapped by the Bounty Hunter, Mulder is forced to trade Samantha for her. During a botched attempt to kill the Bounty Hunter, Samantha is killed. However, it is discovered that this was simply one of many alien clones of Samantha. With the help of X, Mulder pursues the Bounty Hunter to a submarine in the Arctic. Mulder is nearly killed when exposed to the Bounty Hunter's toxic blood, but is saved by Scully.|$|E
5|$|The Karma Society {{was founded}} to study God, who was losing {{his faith in}} {{humanity}} due to their behavior. Sera was the only survivor {{of a group of}} children with the ability to communicate with God. To hide from the pain of the experiments, Sera created an artificial environment that would become the Junkyard, populating it with benign versions of Karma Society staff: these artificial beings would become the Junkyard's five tribes. The original Serph manipulated Sera and his team for his own ends while the original Heat attempted to protect her: when Sera saw Serph killing Heat while linked to the EGG, God felt her pain and attacked Earth. The original Serph was overwhelmed by a flood of data and became a demon before being killed. Now knowing the truth, Serph escapes from the EGG, killing Heat in the process. Sera then decides to head for a secondary Karma facility to communicate with God: on the way, Gale dies defeating Angel, and Cielo sacrifices himself so Sera and Serph can reach the transmission site. As Sera begins transmission, the base is destroyed, killing her and Serph. Their data travels to the sun—the physical manifestation of God—and merges into a new being called Seraph. Aided by the data avatars of the Embryon, Seraph confronts God, fighting an avatar of him to prove humanity's worth. Upon victory, Seraph achieves enlightenment and travels with Schrödinger to new worlds, while God restores the sun and Earth. At the game's end, it is shown that the Embryon, Angel, and aspects of Sera and Serph have reincarnated, with <b>a</b> <b>grown</b> Fred acting as their caretaker.|$|E

25|$|Puzur-Ashur II (c. 1822 BC – c. 1814 BC), son and {{successor}} of Sargon I, {{was king}} of the Old Assyrian Empire for eight years.

25|$|Due {{to their}} {{formidable}} size and power, gaur have few natural predators besides humans. Leopards and dhole packs occasionally attack unguarded calves or unhealthy animals; however, only the tiger and the saltwater crocodiles {{have been reported}} to kill a full-grown adult. But the habitat of gaurs and saltwater crocodiles seldom overlaps in recent times due to the decreasing range of both species, and a crocodile needs to be <b>a</b> <b>grown</b> adult (more than 3.7 m and 300kg) to make a successful attack on healthy bulls.|$|E
25|$|Port {{was born}} in Southend-on-Sea. When he was a year old, he moved to Dagenham, {{where he grew up}} and his parents still live. He was {{described}} as being a 'loner' at school. His neighbour, Ryan, described him as having a peculiar, childlike personality, exhibiting odd behaviour as <b>a</b> <b>grown</b> man, such as playing with children's toys. He came out as gay in the mid-2000s. He lived alone in a flat in Barking, London, and worked as a chef at a Stagecoach bus depot in West Ham.|$|E
25|$|Changing Times (Les temps qui changent) (2004) is a warmhearted {{exploration}} of cultural collision in contemporary Morocco, oscillating {{between two worlds}} and two ideas {{about the meaning of}} experience and the enduring power of love.

25|$|Virginia Dare's {{name has}} become a tourist {{attraction}} for North Carolina.

Residents of Roanoke Island celebrate Virginia Dare's birthday each year with an Elizabethan Renaissance fair.

25|$|Frederick {{arrived in}} England in 1728 as <b>a</b> <b>grown</b> man, {{the year after}} his father had become King George II. By then, George and Caroline had had several younger children, and Frederick, himself now Prince of Wales, was a high-spirited youth fond of drinking, {{gambling}} and women. The long separation damaged their relationship, and they would never be close. 1728 also saw the foundation of Fredericksburg, Virginia, which was named after him — his other namesakes are Prince Frederick, Maryland (1722), Fort Frederick, Maine (1729–30), Fort Frederick, South Carolina (1730–34), Fort Frederick, New York (completed 1735) and Fort Frederica, Georgia (founded 1736), while Fort Frederick, Maryland, Point Frederick, Ontario, Fort Frederick, Ontario and Fort Frederick, New Brunswick were also named after him posthumously.|$|E
25|$|Born in Regueiro, Ourense province, on 18 November 1809, Manuel Blanco Romasanta was {{originally}} named Manuela {{as it was}} initially {{thought that he was}} female. He was raised as a girl until the age of six when a doctor discovered his true sex. Because he could read and write, very rare for the time, it is believed his family was relatively wealthy. As <b>a</b> <b>grown</b> man he worked as a tailor and, according to various accounts, was of small stature, being between 1.37m (4'6") and 1.49m (4'11") in height. Following the death of his wife in 1833, Romasanta became a travelling salesman, initially in Esgos, then eventually throughout Galicia and Portugal. Romasanta was also known to act as a guide for travellers crossing the mountains to Castile, Asturias and Cantabria which gave him further opportunities for trade.|$|E
