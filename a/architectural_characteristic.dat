40|$|Abstract. The {{importance}} of modelling the dynamic <b>architectural</b> <b>characteristics</b> of software systems {{has long been}} recognised. However, {{the nature of the}} dynamic <b>architectural</b> <b>characteristics</b> of service-oriented applications goes beyond what is currently addressed by existing architecture description languages (ADLs). At the heart of the service-oriented approach is the logical separation of service need from the need-fulfillment mechanism, i. e., the service provider: the binding between the two is deferred to runtime and established at the instance level, i. e. each time the need for the service emerges. In this paper we present an architecture-oriented model for dynamic reconfiguration that paves the way for the definition of ADLs that are able to address the specification of dynamic <b>architectural</b> <b>characteristics</b> of service-oriented applications. ...|$|R

The model describes important <b>architectural</b> <b>characteristics</b> such as transactions, security, and persistency, as well as create and use dependencies between components, and maps these higher-level concepts down to their implementation in source files.

Within {{the scope of this article}} shopping malls were discussed as a building type and the evolution of a building type was tried to be witnessed within a twenty-five year period by comparing the early and late examples of shopping malls in Istanbul. The change of Istanbul’s shopping culture / spaces and the inclusion of shopping centers into the practice of architecture as a building type are briefly mentioned. Each of the selected malls were separately examined in terms of location, concept, space organization and other functions included, and in the fourth section both early and late examples were evaluated together in the same terms with a holistic perspective. The effect of shopping malls, the number of which constantly increases in Istanbul, on the city and its architecture is highly important. These massive bodies of buildings play a significant role in the formation and even definition of the new settlement areas of the city, and generate new areas of attraction.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the implementation of}} a Variable Length Decoder (VLD) on a TriMedia/CPU 64 (FPGA-based) Reconfigurable Functional Unit (RFU). The VLD decodes run-level symbols coded as Variable-Length Codes (VLC) following the MPEG standard. The RFU consists mainly of an Altera FPGA core, and is embedded into the TriMedia as any other hardwired functional unit, i. e., it receives instructions from the instruction decoder, reads its input arguments from and writes the computed values back to the register file. Variable-length decoding is an awkward computational part of MPEG decoding. Since the location of a symbol in the stream depends of the data which precedes it, every symbol has to be decoded before the following one can be. In order to balance the complexity and the efficiency of the RFU-mapped decoder, we propose a VLD computing facility which returns a single VLC symbol (run/level pair or end-of-block) per operation. Briefly, the VLD is implemented as a parallel lookup into FPGA's Electronic Array Blocks (EAB), followed by a selection of the proper result. Since each EAB can implement a lookup table of 8 inputs, the VLC symbols have been partitioned into classes according to this FPGA <b>architectural</b> <b>characteristic.</b> When mapped on an ACEX EP 1 K 100 FPGA, our VLD computing resource exhibits a latency of 7 TriMedia cycles, and uses 6 EABs and 16 % of the logic cells of the device...|$|E
40|$|Mihrab and Its Significance {{during the}} Ottoman Period (1396 - 1700) This study investigates the Ottomans mihrab and the {{decorative}} elements used on it, and why. The mihrab {{is an important}} structure of mosque components. The mihrab in the mosque represented in the niche that mediated the Qibla wall; the wall that facing geographically the Holy Mosque the Ka ba or al-Haram al-Sharif in Mecca. The Ottomans influenced by different dynasties, like Byzantine, Umayyad, Abbasid and Seljuk. Other influences came mostly from the translations to the Greek, Old Indian and Persian philosophies that interacted the Islamic thinking during the Umayyad and Abbasid period and which had the great effect on the Ottoman belief and art. These influences gave the mihrab its distinctive <b>architectural</b> <b>characteristic</b> {{that can be seen}} in the decorations like arabesque, calligraphy, muqarnass and Qur anic texts which may reflect current theological and political trends. The Ottoman mihrab and especially those designed by Mimar Sinan or the architect Sinan show these influences elegantly and stylishly. In other word, they show Sinan s innovative ability in introducing these artistic expressions. My study is also an attempt to discover if such influences convey a meaning or are merely a decoration. It investigates if they are means of political propaganda for a specific theology or creed, or are merely decorative tools employed to establish the Ottomans art and the Ottomans identity...|$|E
40|$|Under a recently-funded ESTO award {{we are now}} designing, {{and will}} {{eventually}} implement, a sensor web architecture that couples future Earth observing systems with atmospheric, chemical, and oceanographic models and data assimilation systems. The end product will be a "sensor web simulator " (SWS), based upon the proposed architecture, that would objectively quantify the scientific return of a fully functional model-driven meteorological sensor web. Our proposed work is based upon two previously-funded ESTO studies that have yielded a sensor web-based 2025 weather observing system architecture, and a preliminary SWS software architecture that had been funded by RASC and other technology awards. Sensor Web observing systems {{have the potential to}} significantly improve our ability to monitor, understand, and predict the evolution of rapidly evolving, transient, or variable meteorological features and events. A revolutionary <b>architectural</b> <b>characteristic</b> that could substantially reduce meteorological forecast uncertainty is the use of targeted observations guided by advanced analytical techniques (e. g., prediction of ensemble variance). Simulation is essential: investing in the design and implementation of such a complex observing system would be very costly and almost certainly involve significant risk. A SWS would provide information systems engineers and Earth scientists with the ability to define and model candidate designs, and to quantitatively measure predictive forecast skill improvements. The SWS will serve as a necessary trade studies tool to: evaluate the impact of selecting different types and quantities of remote sensing and in situ sensors; characteriz...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Religious place {{attachment}} is an {{affective bond}} that develops {{between people and}} their religious settings. The published literature shows that although religion has {{a significant impact on}} the public ‘place attachment’, the architectural features and attributes of the places could still play an influencing role in strengthening this attachment. However, the role of architectural characteristics and features of the religious places, as the components that give them meaning(s), has not been adequately explored. This paper reports the impacts of factors influencing the physical and ambience quality of different styles of Malaysian mosques from the Muslim public perspective. Thereby, a survey was conducted to investigate Malaysian public attachment to selected five Malaysian state mosques with respect to their architectural characteristics and features. The survey employed the results of series of interviews as its theoretical basis. The finding proved that Malaysian ‘Muslim’ society has equally strong attachment to all selected mosques in spite of their different architectural styles. The findings also confirmed that the emotional attachment to the impressive aspects of architectural features (e. g. dome, minaret etc.) and the unique identity of the studied mosques is irrespective of the architectural styles, e. g. Modern vs. Postmodern. The paper also argued that religious activities and pleasant <b>architectural</b> <b>characteristic</b> of the studied places including the functional facilities are equally important factors in forming place attachment. This is a new approach to the study of physical and ambience quality of mosques, hence providing sufficient theoretical basis for further investigations and improvements...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{inspired}} by the experience of living in two places that both have distinctive cultures. Architecture being a form of culture motivated me to enter the school of architecture. After 6 years of study, this paper attempts to answer my initial concerns on architecture and culture. For me {{it is very important}} to understand what the relationship between architecture and culture and how they influence each other. How does one present culture and tradition in the design of architecture? How can architecture represent cultural identity in a foreign context, in a more respectful way? Can architecture become the platform to connect people with distinct cultural backgrounds? Last but not least, in the contemporary city of Cape Town, what is the multi-cultural intervention that one can create for immigrants, in this case, the Chinese community in South Africa? These are the essential questions that I want to discuss and investigate in my thesis. There are three sections in this paper. The first is an introduction to Chinese culture and its national identity, looking at traditional Chinese architecture and philosophies behind their making. The courtyard house will be studied as an example. Furthermore, contemporary Chinese architecture that looks at new approaches to representing the modern Chinese identity will be discussed. The second part explores spatial and urban manifestation in Chinese cities - how urban space affects one's cultural behavior. I will look at typical conditions of Chinatown and its <b>architectural</b> <b>characteristic</b> in the foreign context, including the new Chinatown in Johannesburg. In the last chapter, the paper will bring forward my thoughts through design development on site selection, programme and concept. I explored the subject of architecture and identity of nation and the way that cultural identity can be represented through architecture. I questioned how this can be translated into architecture when making its national image into a foreign country...|$|E
40|$|Musculoskeletal (MSK) {{models are}} used {{extensively}} {{in the study of}} human movement. The validity of a given MSK model is affected by the architectural features of the system. The Achilles tendon moment arm is one important <b>architectural</b> <b>characteristic</b> of lower extremity MSK models as it transforms ankle plantar flexion moment present during many functional weight-bearing activities to Achilles tendon force. Because the gastrocnemius muscle, which crosses both the knee and ankle joints, inserts to the Achilles tendon, the magnitude of the Achilles tendon moment arm affects knee-joint contact forces. However, current estimates of Achilles tendon moment arm vary widely and are apparently influenced by factors including ankle joint position, measurement technique, and muscle contraction level. For example, some estimates of Achilles tendon moment are a constant value while others vary as a function of ankle angle. Imaging techniques (such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) of the Achilles tendon moment arm tend to be larger than those using ultrasound (US) technology. Finally, estimates of the Achilles tendon moment arm while plantarflexor muscles are contracted tend to be larger than those measured during a state of rest. However, the effect of these varied estimates on knee joint contact and Achilles tendon forces during walking and running is unclear. The {{purpose of this study is}} to compare Achilles tendon force and knee-joint contact forces during walking and running using a musculoskeletal model and five different estimates of Achilles tendon moment arm (MRI/contracted, MRI/rest, US/contracted, US/rest, constant value). Three dimensional gait and ground reaction force data from 10 participants will be used as inputs to a knee-joint musculoskeletal model from which tibiofemoral joint, patellofemoral joint, and Achilles peak force and force*time impulse will be derived using 5 separate Achilles tendon moment arm estimates. Comparisons of the effect of Achilles tendon moment arm will be made descriptively...|$|E
