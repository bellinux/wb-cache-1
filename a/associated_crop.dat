50|$|Nahar {{also worked}} on energy crops, {{especially}} their adaptability in different soil types of Bangladesh, especially wastelands choosing second generation energy crops not {{in high demand}} in the global food market and thus has little impact on food prices and food security thereby negating the food-fuel dilemma. Second generation biofuel crops can help supply fuel and alleviate the energy crisis with greater environmental benefits. Biofuel production uses biomass generally consisting of energy crops which usually also produces food. Second generation biofuel crops are ones that are not typically used for food purposes. Some grains are can be effectively grown on already-farmed dry lands that are low in carbon storage capacity, eliminating any concerns of clearing of rainforests. Breeds not requiring much irrigation {{will be an important}} consideration in the dry areas. As a stress tolerant plant it is well adapted to tropical, arid and semi-arid regions. It can be easily propagated and grows {{on a wide variety of}} soils, including marginal lands, wastelands and also even when the soil is considered infertile, meaning it can be grown on lands where food crops are not grown, hence it does not compete with the latter for space. She explored the potential of biofuel production on a limited land space for sustaining a growing population like Bangladesh. With rapidly growing urban and national population growth rate, Bangladesh's growing demand for energy with urban expansion has led to deforestation and a steady loss of arable lands, which may result in future food shortages, where she proposes a simple required land use per capita model for establishing a relationship between the biomass production, <b>associated</b> <b>crop</b> yields, the biomass to biofuel conversion methods and the overall fuel demand, as a plan to meet the national energy and habitable land demands while considering the looming environmental effects related to energy usage.|$|E

40|$|A large {{proportion}} of the maize planted in the tropics and highlands of Latin America is associated with beans and other crops. Agronomic research generally has focused on the improvement of varieties and hybrids, and the development of systems and technology for monoculture. The high production potential of <b>associated</b> maize/bean <b>cropping</b> systems indicate that they should receive more attention in future research in the tropics. One of the important results in 1975 was the confirmed observation that maize does not suffer yield reduction when associated with beans. When the appropriate system is determined for each region, including density of planting, relative planting dates, and physical organization of the two crops in the field, there is sometimes an increase in maize production in these complex systems. It has been concluded that the land efficiency ratio (LER) is twenty to eighty percent greater in <b>associated</b> <b>cropping</b> compared to monoculture of either crop. Highest production and gross income are achieved with the monocrop climbing beans under high technology. Nevertheless, production costs are high. Net income in <b>associated</b> <b>cropping</b> systems almost always surpasses that of monocultures when the cost of labor and materials is high. These complex <b>associated</b> <b>cropping</b> systems have been developed by the farmer under certain climatic, resource, economic and cultural constraints.

On the basis of the distribution of the lateral roots, the dicotyledonous weeds were grouped under seven major categories. The distribution of lateral roots at different zones indicated their efficiency in competition with the <b>associated</b> <b>crops.</b> It is suggested that the efficacy of a weed control method on a panicular weed depends considerably on the pattern and distribution of its root system.

40|$|Maize and {{climbing}} beans are traditionally planted in association {{in the sierra}} regions of L. A. with alt. higher than 1500 m. The system has shown a series of advantages: low incidence of certain pests and diseases, less root lodging in maize, and less risk for the farmers. The types of climbing bean and maize used in <b>associated</b> <b>cropping</b> systems were studied. In general, maize and bean yields were negatively related and {{it was found that}} yields of tall maize genotypes were less affected by beans than short maize genotypes. Root lodging of tall maize genotypes was notably reduced in association. Stem lodging of short maize genotypes was due to the vigorous growth of some climbing bean var. Very vigorous bean var. could not reach their own yield potential with short maize genotypes due to the poor support system.

An agent-based modeling (ABM) framework was developed based on a theoretical economic model that incorporates a spatially explicit damage function.

The ABM evaluated the economic impacts of port-specific and importer-specific enforcement regimes, enabling regulators to improve both the allocation of scarce enforcement resources and the effectiveness of current enforcement policies.

In this study, the absolute decline in tomato yields by weed interference was a direct function of water applied (rainirrigation); however, the relative effect of weed biomass on crop loss appeared to increase under drought when compared to irrigated conditions.
