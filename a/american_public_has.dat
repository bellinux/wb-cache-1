25|$|U.S. Public {{opinion on}} the One-China Policy is much more {{ambiguous}} than {{the opinions of the}} American political elites and policy experts. A Pew Research poll from 2012 found that 84% of policy experts believe it to be very important to for the U.S. to build a strong relationship with China, where as only 55% of the general public agreed with that statement . This vast difference of agreement between policy experts and the <b>American</b> <b>Public</b> <b>has</b> been translated into recent politics; Donald Trumps phone call 25 days after his inauguration to the President of Taiwan, breaking a decades old policy, possibly representing an expression of current polling showing negative attitudes towards The Peoples Republic of China. Furthermore, U.S. populist attitudes towards the Peoples Republic of China are negative, where China is viewed as an economic adversary rather than a friendly rival. A 2015 Pew Research poll found that 60% of Americans view the loss of jobs to China as very serious, compared to only 21% who view the tensions between China and Taiwan as very serious. Historical trends conducted by Gallup demonstrate an increase in perception among Americans that China is the leading economic power in the world today, with polls in 2000 showing only 10% agreeing with that statement and in 2016, 50% concurring with the statement.|$|E
500|$|While {{academics}} {{have both}} praised and criticized Tyler, the general <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>has</b> little awareness {{of him at}} all. Several writers have portrayed Tyler as among the nation's most obscure presidents. As Seager remarked: [...] "His countrymen generally remember him, if they have heard of him at all, as the rhyming end of a catchy campaign slogan." ...|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{disclosures}} were published, President Obama {{asserted that the}} <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>had</b> no cause for concern because [...] "nobody is listening to your telephone calls", and [...] "there is no spying on Americans".|$|R
50|$|Belden {{published}} China Shakes the World in 1949, {{when the}} <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>had</b> {{lost interest in}} reports from China. The book’s reputation came only in the 1960s, when the Monthly Review Press reprinted it in paperback with a sympathetic introduction by Owen Lattimore.|$|R
50|$|The film showed Kennedy {{on a tour}} of {{the house}} with the CBS News {{correspondent}} Charles Collingwood.

500|$|Immediately {{after the}} reports were released, several writers {{said that the}} NBA's {{popularity}} would be hurt by the news. Chris Sheridan of ESPN said that [...] "the general <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>has</b> been turning away {{since the end of}} the Bulls' dynasty, and this fiasco isn't going to help bring it back", and J. A. Adande said that [...] "the integrity of the games just took a major hit".|$|E
2500|$|In early 2011, the Chinese {{government}} {{launched a}} million dollar advertising campaign, which was aimed {{to improve the}} [...] "incomplete understandings" [...] the <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>has</b> about China. A 60-second ad was shown at New York's Times Square, which featured Chinese personalities such as scientist Sun Jiadong, singer Liu Huan and news anchor Jing Yidan, ending with the message of [...] "Chinese Friendship". Newsweek noted that the ad's great production values, but criticized it as confusing and explaining little about the featured Chinese identities.|$|E
2500|$|Hasse died on July 28, 1953, with a fifty-four year {{career in}} library and {{information}} science. In those fifty-four years, Hasse {{made a significant}} mark on the field as a library assistant, indexer, cataloguer, classifier, bibliographer, editorial analyst, and author. She was an advocate of [...] "efficient and effective" [...] library service, public access to government materials, and the women's movement. Hasse overcame great obstacles in her quest for providing quick, easy access to materials. American Libraries states that she was best [...] "known for her acerbic personality"; however, Gail K. Nelson and John V. Richardson, Jr., state that, regardless of what one may say of her professional relationships and personal life, {{the basis of the}} Superintendent of Documents Classification system still in use today was [...] "essentially Hasse's." [...] Because of her work in the GPO, the <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>has</b> a system for easily accessing a century's worth of government publications and documents.|$|E

50|$|By September 1973, {{there was}} a sense that Nixon had regained some {{political}} strength, the <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>had</b> become burned out by the Watergate hearings, and that Congress was not willing to undertake impeachment absent some major revelation from the Nixon White House tapes or some major new action by the president against the investigation.|$|R
50|$|The US {{attitude}} to guns generally perplexes {{those in other}} developed countries, who cannot understand why the <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>have</b> not pushed for harsher gun control measures {{in the face of}} mass shootings. Critics contrast the US reaction to terrorism given how few deaths it causes, with their high death rates from non-terror related gun crime.|$|R
5000|$|A Gallup poll from May 2005 {{showed that}} the <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>has</b> more {{confidence}} in the military {{than in any other}} institution.

50|$|Months {{after the}} battle, the U.S. Navy knew the <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>had</b> {{to be told}} something. The battle had been too large, {{involved}} too many U.S. military personnel, and had resulted in too much loss of life just to ignore. To this end, the U.S. Navy provided {{most of the information}} to the publication Popular Mechanics to publish an article on the battle showing the <b>American</b> <b>public</b> that the battle had gone exactly as Halsey had planned. It was several years before the true story of Halsey's decision to leave the San Bernardino Strait unguarded became known to the <b>American</b> <b>public.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Asserting a {{need for}} a more aggressive, activist foreign policy, Reagan also {{suggested}} that Americans could have defeated the Vietcong and the North Vietnamese Army, alleging that the <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>had</b> turned against the war from the influence of North Vietnamese propaganda and implying that the soldiers had been let down by Johnson and Nixon administration officials who had been [...] "afraid to let them win" [...] the war in Vietnam.|$|R
5000|$|After Parker's death, some martial {{artists have}} begun to {{question}} the authenticity of Parker's training and qualifications. Dan Djurdjevic's article [...] "What did Ed Parker Study?" [...] suggests that Ed Parker was not actually a master-level martial artist by the early 1960s but developed an undeserved reputation as a master {{at a time when}} the <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>had</b> little knowledge of authentic martial arts and were unable to verify his claims.|$|R
50|$|Federal {{depository}} libraries {{have been}} established by Congress {{to ensure that the}} <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>has</b> access to its Government's information.

50|$|Since the 1970s, pro-life or anti-abortion {{groups have}} practiced civil disobedience against the U.S. {{government}} {{over the issue}} of legalized abortion. The broader <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>has</b> a long history of subverting unconstitutional governance, from the Whiskey Rebellion to the War on Drugs. However, the extent to which simple violation of sumptuary laws represents true civil disobedience aimed at legal and/or social reform varies widely.|$|E
5000|$|Human {{rights groups}} have raised {{questions}} as to why al-Awlaki was killed by the U.S. {{in a country with}} which the United States was not at war. Jameel Jaffer, deputy legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, stated [...] "If {{the government is going to}} be firing Predator missiles at American citizens, surely the <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>has</b> a right to know who’s being targeted, and why." ...|$|E
5000|$|Publishers Weekly {{said that}} [...] "The {{crux of the}} book's {{argument}} is that... the <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>have</b> grown increasingly hostile to expertise" [...] and described The Death of Expertise as a [...] "highly researched and impassioned book that's well timed", further noting that [...] "Generally, Nichols displays strong reasoning, but at times he goes off the rails.

5000|$|With Dante's death, what {{historically}} {{has been known}} as the [...] "Golden Age of Magic" [...] came to an end. Gone were the variety theaters of the world, and with it were the large traveling magic productions that had thrilled and mystified millions for generations.

5000|$|The American Civil Liberties Union {{issued a}} statement, {{beginning}} [...] "The Wikileaks phenomenon — {{the existence of}} an organization devoted to obtaining and publicly releasing large troves of information the U.S. government would prefer to keep secret — illustrates just how broken our secrecy classification system is. While the Obama administration has made some modest improvements to the rules governing classification of government information, both it and the Bush administration have overclassified and kept secret information that should be subject to public scrutiny and debate. As a result, the <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>has</b> had to depend on leaks to the news media and whistleblowers to know what the government is up to".|$|E
40|$|The negative, stereotypical {{depictions of}} the Japanese and Japanese Americans in American popular culture {{in the first half}} of the twentieth century were of great {{importance}} in the promulgation of the Asian Exclusion Act of 1924, the internment of Japanese Americans following the bombing of Pearl Harbor and the subsequent dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>had</b> been adequately prepared to accept inaccurate representations of Japanese and Japanese Americans; therefore, there was little public outcry against these actions...|$|R
5000|$|The {{process of}} quantifiably {{surveying}} public opinion {{of science is}} now largely associated with the public understanding of science movement (some would say unfairly).

5000|$|While {{academics}} {{have both}} praised and criticized Tyler, the general <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>has</b> little awareness {{of him at}} all. Several writers have portrayed Tyler as among the nation's most obscure presidents. As noted in a 2014 Time Magazine article on the “Top 10 Forgettable Presidents”: After John Tyler earned the vice presidency {{on the strength of}} a campaign slogan that tacked him on as a postscript — [...] "Tippecanoe and Tyler too" [...] — his fate as a historical footnote seemed likely; and when he ascended to the presidency following the death of William Henry Harrison, being dubbed [...] "His Accidency" [...] made it a lock.|$|E
50|$|On June 5, 2013, Staples {{addressed}} the 25th {{annual conference of}} the North American Agricultural Biotechnology Council held in College Station. In the keynote address Staples said that the <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>has</b> little understanding of what is physically required to produce the needed food and fiber because shelves in grocery stores are always full. He claimed that many fail to understand the importance of agriculture to Texas, which has the largest population of rural citizens in the nation and leads in the production of both beef and cotton. Such misunderstanding, he added, can during times of drought lead to conflict between municipalities and agricultural producers over the available water resources. While water usage declined by 40 percent between 1974 and 2010, the output of cattle, cotton, and corn has doubled since 1960, he noted.|$|E
50|$|However, he {{also argues}} American jurisdictions have {{traditionally}} resisted fines {{and community service}} as alternatives to imprisonment, notwithstanding strong support for these sanctions among academics and reformers. Why? The answer is that these forms of punishment are expressively inferior to incarceration. The public expects punishment not only to deter crime and to impose deserved suffering, but also to make accurate statements about what the community values. Imprisonment has been {{and continues to be}} Americans' punishment of choice for serious offenses because of the resonance of liberty deprivation as a symbol of condemnation in our culture. Fines and community service either don't express condemnation as unambiguously as imprisonment, or express other valuations that Americans reject as false. He uses expressive theory to explain why the <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>has</b> consistently rejected proposals to restore corporal punishment, a form of discipline that offends egalitarian moral sensibilities; and why the public is now growing increasingly receptive to shaming punishments, which unlike conventional alternative sanctions signal condemnation unambiguously.|$|E
60|$|Kipling {{had just}} {{returned}} to America, and I went at once to call upon him. I had not seen him since the dinner which he gave to Riley and me in the early Nineties, and I was in doubt as to his attitude toward the States. I found him in a very happy mood, surrounded by callers. In the years of his absence the <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>had</b> learned to place a very high value on his work and thousands of his readers were eager to do him honor.|$|R

He continued to have hits in the charts throughout the 1960s, though not at the level that he had enjoyed before. Nor did doors open to him in the US market; he was not considered part of the British Invasion, and despite four Hot 100 hits (including the top 25 [...] "It's All in the Game") between August 1963 and August 1964, the <b>American</b> <b>public</b> <b>had</b> little awareness of him.|$|R
