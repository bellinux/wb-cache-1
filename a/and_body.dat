5|$|Additionally, the DNA {{differences}} between head lice <b>and</b> <b>body</b> lice provide corroborating evidence that humans used clothing between 80,000 and 170,000 years ago, before leaving Africa. Human head <b>and</b> <b>body</b> lice occupy distinct ecological zones: head lice live and {{feed on the}} scalp, while body lice live on clothing and feed on the body. Because body lice require clothing to survive, the divergence of head <b>and</b> <b>body</b> lice from their common ancestor provides {{an estimate of the}} date of introduction of clothing in human evolutionary history.|$|E

5|$|In the holotype specimen, a female, {{the head}} <b>and</b> <b>body</b> length was 310mm (12.2in), the tail length was 210mm (8.3in), the {{hindfoot}} length was 66.8mm (2.63in), the ear length was 17.5mm (0.69in), {{and the body}} mass was 675g (24oz).

Leg muscles are significantly stronger than arm muscles; thus, proficient boulderers use their arms primarily to maintain balance <b>and</b> <b>body</b> positioning, relying on their legs to push them up the boulder. Boulderers also keep their arms straight whenever possible, allowing their bones to support their body weight rather than their muscles.|$|E

5|$|Electric Music for the Mind <b>and</b> <b>Body</b> was {{released}} on May 11, 1967. Much of the album's material continued to expand upon the band's new psychedelic medium, with it embracing all facets of the members' influences, which ranged from their folk roots, blues, raga rock and hard rock. The album also saw Cohen coming forward in a larger role with inventive distorted-organ melodies. In addition, McDonald's lyrical content, which brazenly pronounced topics of political protest, recreational drug use, and love, augmented by satirical humor, clearly introduced the band's orientation and message. The compositional structures followed discrete movement patterns emulating the style of John Fahey, whom McDonald admired. Though Electric Music for the Mind <b>and</b> <b>Body</b> {{was among the most}} complex works to date, it possessed the quality that several other San Francisco acts shared of being recorded mostly live, with only the vocals being overdubbed after the instrumentals were completed.|$|E

5|$|In 2015 a major DNA {{study of}} golden jackals {{concluded}} that the six C.aureus subspecies found in Africa should be reclassified under the new species C.anthus (African golden wolf), {{reducing the number of}} golden jackal subspecies to seven. The phylogenetic tree generated from this study shows the golden jackal diverging from the wolf/coyote lineage 1.9million years ago and the African golden wolf diverging 1.3million years ago. The study found that the golden jackal and the African golden wolf shared a very similar skull <b>and</b> <b>body</b> morphology and that this had confused taxonomists into regarding these as one species. The study proposes that the very similar skull <b>and</b> <b>body</b> morphology is due to both species having originated from a larger common ancestor.|$|E

However, there have also been alternative suggestions that the pachycephalosaurs could not have used their domes in this way.|$|E
