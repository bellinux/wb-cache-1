5|$|According to the Ramayana, Surabhi is the {{daughter}} of sage Kashyapa and his wife Krodhavasha, {{the daughter}} of Daksha. Her daughters Rohini and Gandharvi are the mothers of cattle and horses respectively. Still, it is Surabhi who is described <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> all cows in the text. However, in the Puranas, such as Vishnu Purana and Bhagavata Purana, Surabhi is described as the daughter of Daksha and the wife of Kashyapa, as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> cows and buffaloes.|$|E
5|$|Though Valmiki's Ramayana {{does not}} record Mandodari {{as being the}} mother of Sita, some later adaptations of the Ramayana depict Mandodari <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> Sita {{or at least the}} cause of the latter's birth.It's all because of Maya.|$|E
5|$|According to Jain {{traditional}} accounts, he {{was born}} to King Nabhi and Queen Marudevi in north Indian city of Ayodhya, also called Vinita. He had two wives, Sunanda and Sumangala. Sumangala is described <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> his ninety-nine sons (including Bharata) and one daughter, Brahmi. Sunanda is depicted <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> Bahubali and Sundari. The sudden death of Nilanjana, one of the dancers of Indra, {{reminded him of the}} world's transitory nature and he developed a desire for renunciation. After renouncing, the Jain legends state he wandered without food for a whole year. The day on which he got his first ahara (food), is celebrated as Akshaya Tritiya by Jains. He is said to have attained Moksha on Mount Kailash. The text Adi Purana by Jinasena is an account of the events of his life. His iconography includes colossal statues such as Statue of Ahimsa, Bawangaja and those erected in Gopachal hill. His icons include the eponymous bull as his emblem, the Nyagrodha tree, Gomukha (bull-faced) Yaksha, and Chakreshvari Yakshi.|$|E

5|$|In Bulgarian and South Slavic {{folklore}} in general, Momchil is glorified {{in numerous}} songs and epic tales as a brigand, {{defender of the}} people and a prominent fighter against the Turks. Indeed, some of the earliest heroic songs in Bulgarian folklore tradition deal with Momchil's exploits. In some folklore material, Momchil, referred to as a duke, acts as the uncle of Prince Marko, another legendary figure who in epic poetry is a fighter against the Turks. In the folklore version of Momchil's last battle, his wife, and not the citizens of Peritheorion, betrays him and is to blame for his death. On the other hand, Momchil's legendary sister Yevrosima is described <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> Prince Marko as well as a major influence on him.|$|E
5|$|In {{the smaller}} painting, Mary averts {{her eyes and}} folds her hands in a gesture that symbolised {{submission}} to God's will. Mary is not submissive, however, in the larger piece. The girl, interrupted in her reading by this unexpected messenger, puts a finger in her bible to mark the place and raises her hand in a formal gesture of greeting or surprise. This calm young woman appears to accept her role <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mother</b> <b>of</b> God, not with resignation but with confidence. In this painting, the young Leonardo presents the humanist face of the Virgin Mary, recognising humanity's role in God's incarnation.|$|E
5|$|Peggy was {{introduced}} {{as a guest}} character in April 1991, by executive producer Michael Ferguson.

5|$|The Historia syntomos of Patriarch Nikephoros I of Constantinople {{mentions}} {{a single}} brother of Heraclius the Elder, named Gregoras, {{who was the}} father of Nicetas. Theophanes the Confessor mentions Epiphania <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> Emperor Heraclius, thus wife of Heraclius the Elder. Heraclius the Elder is mentioned as the father of Emperor Heraclius in several sources, including Theophylact, John of Nikiû, Nikephoros I, Theophanes, Agapius the historian, the Suda, Georgios Kedrenos, Joannes Zonaras, Michael the Syrian, the Chronicle of 1234 and Nikephoros Kallistos Xanthopoulos. In contrast, there is no source mentioning him in the same sentence as the siblings of Emperor Heraclius. That he was their father can be safely assumed though.|$|E
5|$|The {{descendants}} of Ilā through Pururavas {{are known as}} Ailas after Ilā or as the Lunar Dynasty (Chandravamsa) due to their descent from Budha, {{the son of the}} moon-god Chandra. Most versions of tale call Ilā the father as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> the Ailas. The Linga Purana and the Mahabharata, in which Sudyumma's curse does not end, state that as a male, Sudyumma also bore three sons named Utkala, Gaya and Vinatashva (also known as Haritashva and Vinata). The three sons ruled the kingdom for their father as Sudyumma was unable to do so himself due his alternating gender. The sons and their principalities are called the Saudyumnas. Utkala, Gaya, and Vinatashva ruled Utkala country, Gaya, and eastern regions including northern Kurus respectively. With the assistance of the family priest Vasistha, Sudyumma regained control of the entire kingdom. He was succeeded by Pururavas.|$|E
5|$|There is {{a casting}} {{department}} at Elstree Studios which casts actors for Holby City {{as well as}} Casualty, EastEnders and Doctors. The programme also has two dedicated casting directors who bring in a shortlist of actors for the producer and director to audition.

Mealing appeared <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> a paediatric patient in the show's fourth series, Roberts appeared {{as the son of}} a medical professor in Holby City seventh series, and Dhillon appeared as anaesthetist Sunil Gupta in 2001. Roberts believes that his single scene in series seven was enough for him to be called in for the part of Joseph, while in contrast, Dhillon does not believe that his role contributed to his casting as Michael, but instead worried that it would work against him.|$|E

5|$|Valene Ewing first {{appears in}} Dallas in 1978, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> Lucy Ewing (Charlene Tilton) and the ex-wife of Gary Ewing (David Ackroyd, later played by Ted Shackelford), the middle {{son and the}} black sheep of the Ewing family. Valene and Gary Ewing were first married in their {{adolescence}} in 1961, when Gary was 17 years old and Valene was 15. When a pregnant Valene persuades Gary {{to take her to}} the Southfork Ranch in order to introduce her to his family, they settle down at Southfork, and Miss Ellie gave Gary a job as ranch foreman. However, Gary and Valene were soon pressured and manipulated by Gary's older brother, J.R. Ewing (Larry Hagman), who constantly tried to undermine and destroy their marriage. Meanwhile, Gary's father, Jock Ewing, put pressure on Gary to stand up and face his responsibilities for becoming a teenage husband and father-to-be. When Valene gives birth to their daughter Lucy, J.R. makes it clear that the child is an Ewing and will be raised by the Ewings themselves. J.R.'s constant interference causes Gary and Val's marriage to collapse. Under the pressure, Gary fell victim to alcoholism, became violent in the process and walked out on Val and Lucy. With Gary gone, Valene is then driven off Southfork by J.R., but she soon returns to get baby Lucy and flees to Virginia, and later to Tennessee, where she tries to get help from her mother, Lilimae Clements (Julie Harris), to take them in, but they are turned away. At this point, Valene and Lucy had already been tracked down by heavies that were hired by J.R. and the heavies rip Lucy right out of Valene's arms, and take Lucy back to Southfork to be raised by her paternal grandparents. When Valene later tried to take legal action to get Lucy back, J.R. warned Valene that he'd kill her if she came back to the state of Texas. Valene is prevented from seeing her daughter again for many years as a result of this.|$|E
