40|$|During this semester's work term I designed, built, {{packaged}} {{and tested}} nine channels of isolation amplifiers {{for each of}} the Triple Axis Servo Motor Controllers to reduce the noise on the analog input and output signals from the motor controller that is under test. This assembly {{has to be able to}} be mounted inside each of the two motor controller enclosures so as not to disturb other components in there. This noise gets jumbled together with the signal and distorts the signal by amplifying it or decreasing the signal giving a false reading. Direct connection can also produce zero shifts in the data mechanical loading. This is referenced to as a "ground loop". This noise and ground loops must be reduced or eliminated. This report discusses how to reduce noise and ground produced when the motor controller analog output signals are connected to the data collecting system. The report outlines the parts needed to build the isolation amplifier and its connecting hardware. Another important topic to be discussed will be the actual testing of the isolation <b>amplifier</b> <b>box</b> to ensure correct operation. The operation of the isolation amplifier chip and motor controller will not be discussed in great detail, as that would be another project all by itself. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|Here we {{describe}} a methodological approach for the simultaneous electroencephalographic (EEG) recording in musicians playing in ensemble. Four professional saxophonists wore pre-wired EEG caps (30 electrodes placed {{according to an}} augmented 10 - 20 system; cephalic reference and ground). Each cap was connected to a single multi-channel <b>amplifier</b> <b>box</b> [Brain Explorer (BE), EB-Neuro (c) ]. The four boxes converged to a single workstation equipped with a software (GALILEO NT, EB-Neuro (c)) allowing the simultaneous recording of sounds, digital trigger, and EEG-electrooculographic (EOG) -electromyographic (EMG) data, and providing a separate output file for each individual. Noteworthy, the subjects were electrically decoupled to satisfy international safety guidelines. The quality of the EEG data was confirmed by the rate of artifact-free EEG epochs (about 80 %) and by EEG spectral features. During the resting state, dominant EEG power density values were observed at alpha band (8 - 12 Hz) in posterior cortex. The quality of EMG {{can be used to}} identify "on" and "off" states of the musicians' motor performance, thus potentially allowing the investigation of the relationships between EEG dynamics and different characteristics of the specific performance. During the music performance, alpha power density values decreased in amplitude in several cortical regions, whereas power density values enhanced within narrow high-frequency bands. In conclusion, the present methodological approach appeared to be suitable for simultaneous EEG recordings in musicians playing in ensemble. (C) 2011 Elsevier Srl. All rights reserved...|$|E
50|$|Integrated, mini, or {{lifestyle}} systems, {{also known}} as music centres or minisystems, contain one or more sources such as a CD player, a tuner, or a cassette deck together with a preamplifier and a power <b>amplifier</b> in one <b>box.</b> Although some high-end manufacturers do produce integrated systems, such products are generally disparaged by audiophiles, who prefer to build a system from separates (or components), often with each item from a different manufacturer specialising in a particular component. This provides the most flexibility for piece-by-piece upgrades and repairs.|$|R
50|$|For {{slightly}} less flexibility in upgrades, a preamplifier and a power <b>amplifier</b> in one <b>box</b> is called an integrated amplifier; with a tuner, it is a receiver. A monophonic power amplifier, {{which is called}} a monoblock, is often used for powering a subwoofer. Other modules in the system may include components like cartridges, tonearms, hi-fi turntables, Digital Media Players, digital audio players, DVD players that play {{a wide variety of}} discs including CDs, CD recorders, MiniDisc recorders, hi-fi videocassette recorders (VCRs) and reel-to-reel tape recorders. Signal modification equipment can include equalizers and signal processors.|$|R
50|$|As {{a session}} artist, composer, and producer, David Torn has experimented with many effects <b>boxes,</b> <b>{{amplifier}}s,</b> and instruments, {{and he has}} spoken with amplifier designers and pedal builders about their craft. In an interview with Premier Guitar magazine following the release of his solo album Only Sky, he shared an extensive list of the instruments and effects he uses. He plays a Ronin Mirari guitar with Foilbucker pickups and also lists {{a large number of}} amplifiers such as a Fryette Aether amplifier, and many guitar effects pedals including the TC Electronic Classic TC XII Phaser, Catalinbread Antichthon, DigiTech Whammy DT, and the Neunaber Stereo Wet Reverb.|$|R
40|$|The Penning-trap mass {{spectrometer}} PENTATRAP aims for measurements of mass ratios of single stable and long-lived highly-charged ions with a relative uncertainty {{on the order}} of 10 − 11. For the mass-ratio measurement the cyclotron frequencies are measured for two ion species inside the magnetic field of the Penning traps. The ions’ eigenfrequencies are measured by means of a non-destructive detection of image currents. Essential part of each detection circuit is a cryogenic high-quality (high-Q) resonator, realised as a superconducting NbTi or copper coil in a copper housing. PENTATRAP incorporates detectors for the axial and the modified cyclotron mode, which enable direct cooling and detection of these modes. The tiny image currents induced by a single ion become detectable with the help of cryogenic GaAs FET amplifiers. Due to a modification of the PENTATRAP setup, a new detection system is needed. This detection system was developed in the framework of this thesis. The new detection system features identical housings for the axial and the cyclotron resonators. Both coil types were designed as toroidal coils. The previous amplifier circuit was adapted to the new <b>amplifier</b> <b>box.</b> First tests of the resonators, with and without the cryogenic amplifier, were conducted inside a cryocooler. For a 35 Cl 10 + -ion the final resonators will lead to a dip width of ~ 1. 73 Hz for a dip detection measurement with the axial resonator at the correction electrode. With the cyclotron resonator connected to one half of the correction electrode the expected cooling time constant for this ion is ~ 36. 6 s...|$|E

5000|$|Disney Sound Source. Covox-idea based DAC, marketed by Disney Software {{in early}} 1990s. It {{consisted}} of 2 parts: a DAC plugged into printer port and separate <b>amplifier</b> / speaker <b>box.</b> Its price {{was set to}} only $14 and it was supported by many games (see below). It used external power (9 volt battery) and could be turned on/off by software. Contrary to the Speech Thing the output rate {{is determined by the}} hardware (7 kHz) and the design features a 16 byte FIFO allowing for autodetection and flow control of the output. In 2015 the hardware was reverse engineered so compatible circuits can be built from easily available off the shelf components. It is also emulated by the popular DOSBox emulator.|$|R
50|$|In January 1971, {{during their}} 1970-71 tour {{in support of}} their second studio album Trespass (1970), Genesis {{returned}} to a five-member formation when guitarist Steve Hackett joined the group after a lengthy search to replace their previous guitarist, founding member Anthony Phillips, who left in July 1970. In the six months prior, the group performed live as a four-piece consisting of singer Peter Gabriel, keyboardist Tony Banks, bassist Mike Rutherford, and drummer Phil Collins, who had joined in August 1970. The four-man band got through shows by Rutherford playing the bass and bass pedals and Banks playing lead guitar lines on a Pianet through a distorted fuzz <b>box</b> <b>amplifier</b> {{in addition to his}} keyboard parts, a technique that he credited in improving his performance as it required him to play two keyboards simultaneously. After shows in the UK and Belgium, their first overseas concerts, Genesis played their first of three consecutive appearances at the annual Reading Festival. They took a break from touring in July 1971 to make their next album. Tony Stratton-Smith, the owner of their label, Charisma Records, suggested they write and rehearse at Luxford House, a 16th-century Grade II listed building he owned in Crowborough, East Sussex.|$|R
5000|$|According {{to several}} sources, the general {{architectural}} and design trend is {{for men to}} take traditionally male-only spaces, and enhance them with improvements and masculine aesthetic choices. Man caves can be equipped with accessories such as refrigerators, vending machines, putting greens, kegerators, giant TVs, musical instruments including gear such as microphone stands and <b>amplifiers,</b> pool tables, <b>boxing</b> rings, and entertainment centers. A man cave may also be fitted out with a bar and sports memorabilia such as trophies. In the book Where Men Hide which Publishers Weekly described as an affable but only “sometimes thought provoking” guide, author James Twitchell and photographer Ken Ross explore areas where men like to be alone. According to Twitchell, some public male-only spaces, such as the barbershop, are declining, while other spaces are taking their places, and the author tries to show the attractions of the [...] "grimy garage." [...] The book suggests that [...] "men make their own spaces for good or ill", according to Publishers Weekly. Twitchell focused on communal man cave spaces such as male-only groups in megachurches, possibly a modern-day replacement for declining attendance at male-only clubs such as Masonic lodges. Twitchell noted that some anthropologists have speculated that these spots are a place for men to bond before hunting or war, and where they can [...] "smoke or fart" [...] and tell the [...] "same jokes over and over again." ...|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the most}} common {{problems}} was the return to VHF frequencies by stations that had used them when they were analog. Over 480 stations were broadcasting digitally on the VHF spectrum after the transition, up from only 216 on the frequencies before. Many antennas marketed for digital TV are designed for UHF, which most digital stations use. VHF analog signals travel further than UHF signals, but watchable VHF digital signals appear to have a more limited range than UHF with the lower power they are assigned, and they don't penetrate buildings as well, especially in larger cities. Mike Doback, vice president of engineering for Scripps Television, said, [...] "It’s only now that we’ve found out the planning factors were probably wrong in terms of how much power you need to replicate analog service." [...] According to TV consultant Peter Putman, the problem with VHF reception is that VHF antennas must be large to be effective, and indoor antennas do not perform well enough. In addition, channels 2 through 6 are more susceptible to many types of interference. Richard Mertz of Cavell, Mertz & Associates says multipath interference inside the house is also a factor. Some receivers can deal with this problem better than others, but there are no standards. And with amplified antennas or amplifiers, it is possible to overload a converter <b>box.</b> <b>Amplifiers</b> can also cause noise that is interpreted as data. Raycom Media Chief Technology Officer Dave Folsom said, [...] "There’s nothing inherently wrong with VHF. It’s just easier to have interference, because it goes out further.” ...|$|R
500|$|After a short holiday, Genesis {{began to}} write and rehearse as a four piece band in Farnham, Surrey. The now empty guitar {{sections}} in their songs allowed Banks and Rutherford to expand their sound and play what Gabriel described as [...] "interesting chords". As they had not found a new guitarist, Genesis resumed as a live act with Rutherford adding bass pedals and Banks playing lead guitar lines on a Pianet through a distorted fuzz <b>box</b> <b>amplifier</b> {{in addition to his}} keyboard parts, something that he credits in helping him develop his technique. In November 1970, after a second audition with Caryl fell through, Dave Stopps, owner of Friars club in Aylesbury, suggested they use Mick Barnard of The Farm, who joined the band for their gigs which included Genesis's television debut on BBC's Disco 2. After two months of performances, the band found Barnard lacked in expertise and wished to try someone else. In December, Gabriel spotted a Melody Maker advert from Steve Hackett, formerly of Quiet World, who wanted to join a band of [...] "receptive musicians, determined to drive beyond existing stagnant music forms". Gabriel advised Hackett to become familiar with Trespass and attend their upcoming gig at the Lyceum Theatre in London. Hackett auditioned with the group in a flat in Earls Court and formed an instant rapport with Rutherford through a common interest in inversion chords. After Hackett joined in January 1971, Stratton-Smith organised a UK tour with Genesis opening for fellow Charisma acts Lindisfarne and Van der Graaf Generator. Their first overseas dates took place in March with gigs in Belgium followed by their first of three consecutive appearances at the annual Reading Festival on 26 June.|$|R
