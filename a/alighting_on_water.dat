25|$|His Geese <b>Alighting</b> <b>on</b> <b>Water,</b> painted at Enman'in, Ōtsu in 1767, is {{an early}} example of his mature style. The subject is treated {{as a part of}} nature; nothing {{philosophical}} is implied as had been done with such imagery in the East Asian tradition. Likewise, Kingfisher and Trout, painted in 1769, features a bird {{near the top of the}} image, waiting for a fish. The trout swims under a large rock near the center. Bird, fish, and stone all appear as they do in nature, creating a matter-of-fact, comprehensible, and natural-looking piece. Later in his oeuvre, Pine Trees in Snow, executed in 1773 for the wealthy Mitsui family, is realistic despite being in the Japanese idiom of ink on a gold background. The two six-panel screens show tree bark and pine needles separated by differing brush strokes, and the white snow seems to weigh down the branches. The bark is painted in the tsuketate technique, which uses no outlines, just dark and light shades to create the illusion of volume.|$|E

50|$|A {{seaplane}} is a {{fixed-wing aircraft}} {{capable of taking}} off and landing (<b>alighting)</b> <b>on</b> <b>water.</b> Seaplanes that can also operate from dry land are a subclass called amphibian aircraft. These aircraft were sometimes called hydroplanes. Seaplanes and amphibians are usually divided into two categories based on their technological characteristics: floatplanes and flying boats.|$|E
50|$|Seaplanes, flying boats, and amphibious {{aircraft}} {{are designed to}} take off and <b>alight</b> <b>on</b> <b>water.</b> <b>Alighting</b> can be supported by a hull-shaped fuselage and/or pontoons. The availability of a long effective runway was historically important on lifting size restrictions on aircraft, and their freedom from constructed strips remains useful for transportation to lakes and other remote areas. The ability to loiter <b>on</b> <b>water</b> is also important for marine rescue operations and fire fighting. One disadvantage of water alighting {{is that it is}} dangerous in the presence of waves. Furthermore, the necessary equipment compromises the craft's aerodynamic efficiency and speed.|$|R
5000|$|Early manned {{spacecraft}} {{launched by the}} United States were designed to <b>alight</b> <b>on</b> <b>water</b> by the splashdown method. The craft would parachute into the water, which acted as a cushion to bring the craft to a stop; the impacts were violent but survivable. Alighting over water rather than land made braking rockets unnecessary, but its disadvantages included difficult retrieval and the danger of drowning. The NASA Space Shuttle design was intended to land on a runway instead. Some future spacecraft are planning to permit water alightings (SpaceX Dragon, Boeing CST-100, etc.) ...|$|R
50|$|They <b>alight</b> <b>on</b> <b>water</b> {{with their}} feet retracted. They rarely land <b>on</b> <b>water</b> {{with their feet}} {{stretched}} forward like pelicans or cormorants. When they are <b>on</b> the <b>water</b> their body is rather low in the water with their tail pointing diagonally upwards. They <b>alight</b> with difficulty <b>on</b> land and often with a bump as their narrow wings do {{not allow them to}} turn easily and they have to use their feet and tail to aid in these manoeuvres. Individuals often suffer damage to their legs or feet when they land on the ground if there is not sufficient wind. Damaged or broken wings are a frequent cause of death in adults. The position of the legs towards the rear of the body means that they walk in a similar way to ducks.|$|R
50|$|A {{seaplane}} is a powered {{fixed-wing aircraft}} {{capable of taking}} off and landing (<b>alighting)</b> <b>on</b> <b>water.</b> Seaplanes that can also take off and land on airfields are in a subclass called amphibious aircraft. Seaplanes and amphibians are usually divided into two categories based on their technological characteristics: floatplanes and flying boats; the latter are generally far larger and can carry far more. These aircraft were sometimes called hydroplanes, but currently this term applies instead to motor-powered watercraft that use the technique of hydrodynamic lift to skim the surface of water when running at speed.|$|E
50|$|As large wading birds, {{great blue}} herons {{are capable of}} feeding in deeper waters, thus are able to harvest from niche areas not open to most other heron species. Typically, the great blue heron feeds in shallow waters, usually less than 50 cm deep, or at the water's edge during both the night and the day, but {{especially}} around dawn and dusk. The most commonly employed hunting technique of the species is wading slowly with its long legs through shallow water and quickly spearing fish or frogs with its long, sharp bill. Although usually ponderous in movements, the great blue heron is adaptable in its fishing methods. Feeding behaviors variably have consisted of standing in one place, probing, pecking, walking at slow speeds, moving quickly, flying short distances and alighting, hovering over water and picking up prey, diving headfirst into the water, <b>alighting</b> <b>on</b> <b>water</b> feet-first, jumping from perches feet-first, and swimming or floating {{on the surface of}} the water.|$|E

50|$|The LISA Akoya is a French {{single-engine}} light aircraft, seating two in side-by-side configuration. It is an amphibious aircraft {{capable of}} <b>alighting</b> <b>on</b> land, <b>water</b> or snow without adaptation. It has a high-aspect-ratio electrically-folding wing, with trailing edge extensions rather than flaps, and a rear-mounted tractor configuration engine.|$|R
50|$|As Helena remains helplessly pinned, another beam resumes {{probing the}} cargo area. <b>Alighting</b> <b>on</b> the <b>water</b> tank, it intensifies. Pulled through the tank's walls, a {{jet of water}} streams across the module to be absorbed by the rock. After {{draining}} the container, the rock's pulsing glow strengthens. Helena relays these facts via the open commlock channel. Outside, Koenig and company realise the rock-forms need water to survive. Some meteorological event in the past stopped the rain cycle; over time, the rocks drained this planet dry. Many of the surrounding 'normal' rocks are probably deceased members of the species.|$|R
50|$|The great frigatebird forages in pelagic waters within 80 km (50 mi) of the {{breeding}} colony or roosting areas. Flying {{fish from the}} family Exocoetidae {{are the most common}} item in the diet of the great frigatebird; other fish species and squid may be eaten as well. Prey is snatched while in flight, either from just below the surface or from the air in the case of flying fish flushed from the water. Great frigatebirds will make use of schools of predatory tuna or pods of dolphins that push schooling fish to the surface. Like all frigatebirds they will not <b>alight</b> <b>on</b> the <b>water</b> surface and are usually incapable of taking off should they accidentally do so.|$|R

5000|$|In 1893, a Canadian {{newspaper}} reported that: [...] "he has thirty-nine feats in his performance or act, the most sensational {{of which is}} his great water jump, representing a jump from England to America. In accomplishing this feat he will <b>alight</b> <b>on</b> the <b>water</b> and off again without wetting the upper leather of his boots. This marvellous feat has never been accomplished by any artist in this world." [...] More detail of this jump was given in an Australian publication: [...] "a tank {{is set in the}} middle of the stage, and is filled to the brim with water. Mr Darby takes a flying leap, and as he passes over the water be descends slightly. By this downward motion he, as it were, <b>alights</b> <b>on</b> the top of the water, and flies off again without wetting the upper leather of his boots." [...] When asked how hemanaged this feat, he replied: [...] "I really don't know, it comes naturally tome, though when I think of it myself it seems almost an impossibility." ...|$|R
50|$|Like most gulls, Bonaparte's gull has {{a varied}} diet, with prey items {{changing}} {{over the course}} of the year, and from year to year. During the breeding season, it is largely insectivorous. It is known to quickly congregate in large numbers to take advantage of termite dispersal flights, circling over the emerging swarm and hovering briefly to take the insects in flight. It also gathers in large numbers to feed on the eggs of spawning salmon, <b>alighting</b> <b>on</b> the <b>water</b> and, if necessary, diving to take drifting eggs. During migration and into the winter, insects are first supplemented, then replaced by other food items, including fish, small crustaceans, mollusks, euphausiids, marine worms, and other invertebrates. At least one immature bird has been recorded as having fed on walnut meat. Bonaparte's gulls are known to engage in kleptoparasitism, and have been observed stealing earthworms from foraging dunlins and black-bellied plovers.|$|R
2500|$|On 13 December 1916 Beagle and [...] were {{involved}} in a friendly fire incident when on patrol near Kum Kale. [...] Both destroyers raced to engage a low flying aircraft. [...] HMS Racoon fired four shells causing damaged to the aircraft and forcing it to <b>alight</b> <b>on</b> the <b>water.</b> [...] HMS Racoon rescued the French pilot and observer then towed the aircraft to Kephelo Air Base on Imbros. On 9 January 1917, Beagle was escorting the pre-dreadnought , on passage from Mudros to Malta, when Cornwallis was torpedoed twice by the German submarine [...] When attempts at damage control failed and it was clear that Cornwallis was sinking, Beagle went alongside the battleship and took off her crew. After this was complete, and Beagle had pushed off from Cornwallis, U-32 struck the battleship with a third torpedo. An attempt by Beagle to depth charge the German submarine was unsuccessful. Fifteen of Cornwalliss crew were lost in her sinking.|$|R
60|$|When Joe's {{eyes were}} {{thoroughly}} {{accustomed to the}} clear water, with its deceiving lights and shades, he saw a fish lying snug under {{the side of a}} stone. The lad thought he recognized the snub-nose, the hooked, wolfish jaw, but he could not get sufficient of a view to classify him. He crawled to a more advantageous position farther down stream, and then he peered again through the woods. Yes, sure enough, he had espied a trout. He well knew those spotted silver sides, that broad, square tail. Such a monster! In his admiration for the fellow, and his wish for a hook and line to try conclusions with him, Joe momentarily forgot his object. Remembering, he tossed out a big, fat cricket, which <b>alighted</b> <b>on</b> the <b>water</b> just above the fish. The trout never moved, nor even blinked. The lad tried again, with no better success. The fish would not rise. Thereupon Joe returned {{to the point where he}} had left Wetzel.|$|R
60|$|He who {{believes}} in separate and innumerable acts of creation may say, that in these cases it has pleased the Creator to cause a being of one type {{to take the place}} of one belonging to another type; but this seems to me only restating the fact in dignified language. He {{who believes}} in the struggle for existence and in the principle of natural selection, will acknowledge that every organic being is constantly endeavouring to increase in numbers; and that if any one being varies ever so little, either in habits or structure, and thus gains an advantage over some other inhabitant of the same country, it will seize on the place of that inhabitant, however different that may be from its own place. Hence it will cause him no surprise that there should be geese and frigate-birds with webbed feet, living on the dry land and rarely <b>alighting</b> <b>on</b> the <b>water,</b> that there should be long-toed corncrakes, living in meadows instead of in swamps; that there should be woodpeckers where hardly a tree grows; that there should be diving thrushes and diving Hymenoptera, and petrels with the habits of auks.|$|R

50|$|Overseas Tankship had a ship, the Wagon Mound, docked in Sydney Harbour in October 1951. The {{crew had}} {{carelessly}} allowed furnace oil (also {{referred to as}} Bunker oil) to leak from their ship. The oil drifted under a wharf thickly coating {{the water and the}} shore where other ships were being repaired. Hot metal produced by welders using oxyacetylene torches on the respondent's timber wharf (Mort's Dock) at Sheerlegs Wharf fell on floating cotton waste which ignited the oil <b>on</b> the <b>water.</b> The wharf and ships moored there sustained substantial fire damage. In an action by Mort's Dock for damages for negligence it was found as a fact that the defendants did not know and could not reasonably have been expected to know that the oil was capable of being set <b>alight</b> when spread <b>on</b> <b>water.</b> The dock owners knew the oil was there, and continued to use welders.|$|R
