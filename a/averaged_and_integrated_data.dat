40|$|Cell {{population}} heterogeneity {{can affect}} cellular response {{and is a}} major factor in drug resistance. However, there are few techniques available to represent and explore how heterogeneity is linked to population response. Recent high-throughput genomic, proteomic, and cellomic approaches offer opportunities for profiling heterogeneity on several scales. We have recently examined heterogeneity in vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) membrane localization in endothelial cells. We and others processed the heterogeneous <b>data</b> through ensemble <b>averaging</b> <b>and</b> <b>integrated</b> the <b>data</b> into computational models of anti-angiogenic drug effects in breast cancer. Here we show that additional modeling insight can be gained when cellular heterogeneity is considered. We present comprehensive statistical and computational methods for analyzing cellomic <b>data</b> sets <b>and</b> <b>integrating</b> them into deterministic models. We present a novel method for optimizing the fit of statistical distributions to heterogeneous data sets to preserve important data and exclude outliers. We compare methods of representing heterogeneous data and show methodology can affect model predictions up to 3. 9 -fold. We find that VEGF levels, a target for tuning angiogenesis, are more sensitive to VEGFR 1 cell surface levels than VEGFR 2; updating VEGFR 1 levels in the tumor model gave a 64 % change in free VEGF levels in the blood compartment, whereas updating VEGFR 2 levels gave a 17 % change. Furthermore, we find that subpopulations of tumor cells and tumor endothelial cells (tEC) expressing high levels of VEGFR (. 35, 000 VEGFR/cell) negate anti-VEGF treatments. We show that lowering the VEGF...|$|R
