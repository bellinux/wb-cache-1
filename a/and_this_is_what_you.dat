5000|$|In 2009, Delpy {{starred in}} The Countess, also her third {{film as a}} {{director}} in which she played the title role of Elizabeth Báthory. The film also starred Daniel Brühl, and William Hurt. In 2011 Delpy wrote and directed Le Skylab. The film received a theatrical release in France, but failed to find distribution in the U.S. In 2012 she released 2 Days in New York, a sequel to her 2007 film 2 Days in Paris. The film starred Delpy and actor Chris Rock. Delpy stated that she wrote the role specifically for Rock. In 2013, Delpy reunited with Richard Linklater and Ethan Hawke to write Before Midnight, the sequel to Before Sunrise and Before Sunset. Delpy again starred with Hawke, and the film premiered at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival. It went on to screen out of competition at the Berlin International Film Festival and was released in May 2013. Delpy was later nominated for a Best Adapted Screenplay at the Academy Awards alongside Richard Linklater and Ethan Hawke. Responding to criticism regarding the nudity in the film {{in an interview with}} GQ Magazine, Delpy remarked: [...] "Some people were like, 'it's not feminist. You're showing your tits and he's not showing his ass.' But isn't it the people who are hiding women behind layers of clothes who are the misogynists?

40|$|The {{title of}} a piece of {{legislation}} should serve a simple, single purpose. It ought provide a descriptive handle. Think of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), the Ombudsman Act 1976 (Cth) or the various Industrial Relations Acts. "This is the field I regulate <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> call me. " Language of course is not always so simple. What forms the Unfair Contracts Act to one sub-contractor may, to the powerful corporation who hires that sub-contractor, read as the Unmaking the Sanctity of Contracts Act. Legislative titling is an arcane field, negotiating the boundaries of the legislative and administrative processes of government. In theory, Parliaments can amend the {{title of a}} Bill or Regulation. (Short and long titles, the preamble or recital and purpose clause have been described as "amendable descriptive components": Bennion F, Statutory Interpretation (2 nd ed, Butterworths, London, 1992) pp 496 - 506.) But in practice Parliaments no more debate, let alone meddle with, legislative titles than they do the headings to statutory parts and sections. Naming legislation is thus an act of executive fiat, exercised by the Minister who brings the ultimate bill to Cabinet. Yet the tradition was that Ministers, like Parliaments, concerned themselves with the substance of legislation, not its form. At best, there was a Cabinet veto on inappropriate legislative titles, rarely used. Instead, the matter was {{in the hands of the}} departmental staff and parliamentary counsel who drafted the flesh of the written law on the skeleton of government policy...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the Honours Thesis is to provide the senior {{undergraduate}} student {{with an opportunity to}} carry out a piece of independent professional work, under the guidance of a faculty member or another qualified individual. The work carried out may include one of the following: A. A detailed case history description of a geological process such as a landslide, a flood, or an earthquake and its real or potential impact on engineering development, including a consideration of possible remedial measures. B. A detailed site reconnaissance report for a site containing an interesting geological engineering problem, e. g. a landslide, or a location of building settlement, erosion, contamination or similar, including a consideration of possible remedial measures. C. A detailed description of a design procedure followed at a real, or hypothetical project involving problematic geological engineering conditions, including for example, stability concerns or hydrogeology. D. A quantitative regional study of geological engineering conditions or the occurrence of a certain geological process which could have an impact on engineering developments. E. An in-depth theoretical or experimental study of a specific geological engineering problem. Other themes, consisting perhaps of combinations of the above, could be considered. Ideally, the project should include components of field work, laboratory and analysis. However, it is not required that each project have all three components. There is no problem in using experience gained during relevant summer employment, although you must provide an acceptable thesis and provide evidence of independent work. The scope of the project is given by the credit weight of the course. Ordinarily, a 6 credit course should take about 4 to 6 weeks of full time work to complete <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> should allow for EOSC 447...|$|E
