25|$|Sand{{blasting}} or {{bead blasting}} is a generic {{term for the}} process of smoothing, shaping, and cleaning a hard surface by forcing solid particles across that surface at high speeds. Sandblasting equipment typically consists of a chamber in which sand and air are mixed. The mixture travels through a hand-held nozzle to direct the particles toward the surface or workpiece. Nozzles {{come in a variety}} of shapes, sizes, and materials. Boron carbide is a popular material for nozzles because it resists <b>abrasive</b> <b>wear</b> well. In 1870, the sandblasting process was invented and patented by Benjamin Chew Tilghman.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Abrasive</b> <b>wear</b> is {{commonly}} classified {{according to the}} type of contact and the contact environment. The type of contact determines the mode of <b>abrasive</b> <b>wear.</b> The two modes of <b>abrasive</b> <b>wear</b> are known as two-body and three-body <b>abrasive</b> <b>wear.</b> Two-body wear occurs when the grits or hard particles remove material from the opposite surface. The common analogy is that of material being removed or displaced by a cutting or plowing operation. Three-body wear occurs when the particles are not constrained, and are free to roll and slide down a surface. The contact environment determines whether the wear is classified as open or closed. An open contact environment occurs when the surfaces are sufficiently displaced to be independent of one another ...|$|E

30|$|The {{increase}} in cutting temperature normally causes the premature cutting tool failure or excessive tool wear, {{while most of}} the wear processes occurs at the major flank face and rake face of the cutting tool. There are four main wear mechanisms in association with tool failure, including: oxidation, abrasion, adhesion and diffusion. All of these wears are related to the temperature sensitivity even under normal cutting conditions [20, 21]. At low cutting temperature (due to soft cutting or high cooling efficiency), adhesive and <b>abrasive</b> <b>wears</b> are dominant. While the cutting temperature is higher than a certain threshold, thermal induced wear, such as oxidation and diffusion, are activated and dominate total wear. The utilization of cutting fluid, traditionally applied to remove heat generated from the cutting process, can additionally cause environmental pollution, health hazards, surface contamination and an increased cost of production [22]. The above issues can be avoided by using an internally-cooled smart cutting tool.|$|R

50|$|Soft {{materials}} often exhibit higher {{susceptibility to}} fretting than hard materials {{of a similar}} type. The hardness ratio of the two sliding materials also {{has an effect on}} fretting wear. However, softer materials such as polymers can show the opposite effect when they capture hard debris which becomes embedded in their bearing surfaces. They then act as a very effective <b>abrasive</b> agent, <b>wearing</b> down the harder metal with which they are in contact.|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} effect of surface {{modifications}} and constraints on the mechanical properties of Ni-Mn-Ga single crystals, which are imposed by (i) structural modifications near the surface, (ii) mounting to a solid surface, and (iii) guiding the stroke. Spark eroded samples were electropolished and characterized before and after each polishing treatment. Surface damage was then produced with spark erosion and <b>abrasive</b> <b>wearing.</b> Surface damage stabilizes and pins a dense twin-microstructure and prevents twins from coarsening. The density of twins increases with increasing degree of surface deformation. Twinning stress and hardening rate during mechanical loading increase with increasing surface damage and twin density. In contrast, when a damaged surface layer is removed, twinning stresses, hardening rate, and twin density decrease. Constraining the sample by mounting and guiding reduces the magnetic-field-induced strain by locking twins at the constrained surfaces. For single-domain crystals and for hard magnetic shape-memory alloys, external constraints strongly reduce the magnetic-field-induced strain and the fatigue lifetime is short. In contrast, for selfaccommodated martensite and for soft magnetic shape-memory alloys, the twin-microstructure adapts well to external constraints and the fatigue lifetime is long. The performance of devices with MSMA transducers requires managing stress distributions through design and control of surface properties, microstructure, and constraints...|$|R
