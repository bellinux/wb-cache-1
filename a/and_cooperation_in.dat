40|$|Abstract—Chinese <b>and</b> foreign <b>cooperation</b> <b>in</b> running {{tertiary}} education {{institutions in the}} central regions of China has the characteristics of short development time, limited expansion and little practical experience. It is highly subject to {{the constraints of the}} overall level of education, and therefore still in the initial period as a whole. The analysis of Chinese <b>and</b> foreign <b>cooperation</b> <b>in</b> managing tertiary institutions has just begun and there are some problems in the process of development. The present status of Chinese <b>and</b> foreign <b>cooperation</b> <b>in</b> education management in the central regions demonstrates that {{it is very important to}} break through the difficulties. The writer has identified three contradictions in the current process and believes that we need to analyse and find the factors which currently restrict Chinese <b>and</b> foreign <b>cooperation</b> <b>in</b> tertiary institution management, and at the same time, establish an effective system for Chinese <b>and</b> foreign <b>cooperation...</b>|$|R
5|$|Croatia held an {{independence}} {{referendum on}} 19 May 1991, following the Croatian parliamentary elections of 1990 {{and the rise}} of ethnic tensions that led to the breakup of Yugoslavia. With 83 percent turnout, voters approved the referendum, with 93 percent in favor of independence. Subsequently, Croatia declared independence and the dissolution of its association with Yugoslavia on 25 June 1991, but it introduced a three-month moratorium on the decision when urged to do so by the European Community and the Conference on Security <b>and</b> <b>Cooperation</b> <b>in</b> Europe through the Brioni Agreement. The war in Croatia escalated during the moratorium, and on 8 October 1991, the Croatian Parliament severed all remaining ties with Yugoslavia. In 1992, the countries of the European Economic Community granted Croatia diplomatic recognition and Croatia was admitted to the United Nations.|$|E
