5|$|About a {{thousand}} pilot whales are killed this way {{each year on}} the Faroe Islands together with usually a few dozen up to a few hundred animals belonging to other small cetaceans species, but numbers vary greatly per year.

5000|$|Dr. Ganzert is {{a proponent}} of the [...] "five freedoms" [...] test to {{determine}} the state of an <b>animal's</b> <b>welfare.</b> The five freedoms stipulate that animals should be free from pain, free from fear, free from discomfort, free from hunger, and free to express natural behaviors.|$|R
25|$|The term ethical {{foie gras}} or humane foie gras {{is also used}} for gavage-based foie gras {{production}} that {{is more concerned with}} the <b>animal's</b> <b>welfare</b> (using rubber hoses rather than steel pipes for feeding). Others have expressed skepticism at these claims of humane treatment, as earlier attempts to produce fattened livers without gavage have not produced satisfactory results.|$|R
5|$|In some countries, geese {{and ducks}} are force-fed to produce livers with an {{exceptionally}} high fat {{content for the}} production of foie gras. Over 75% of world production of this product occurs in France, with lesser industries in Hungary and Bulgaria and a growing production in China. Foie gras is considered a luxury {{in many parts of the}} world, but the process of feeding the birds in this way is banned in many countries on <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> grounds.|$|E

The company has established a preference for purchasing eggs and pork-based products from those suppliers that use cage-free production methods.|$|E
5|$|While {{cetaceans}} {{have been}} held in captivity since the 1860s, the first commercial dolphinarium was opened only in 1938. Their popularity increased rapidly until the 1960s. Since the 1970s, increasing concern for <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> led to stricter regulation, which in several countries ultimately resulted in the closure of some dolphinariums. Despite this trend, dolphinariums are still widespread in Europe, Japan and North America.|$|E

5|$|Both {{intensive}} and free-range farming have <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> concerns. In intensive systems, cannibalism, feather pecking and vent pecking can be common, with some farmers using beak trimming as a preventative measure. Diseases {{can also be}} common and spread rapidly through the flock. In extensive systems, the birds are exposed to adverse weather conditions and are vulnerable to predators and disease-carrying wild birds. Barn systems {{have been found to}} have the worst bird welfare. In Southeast Asia, a lack of disease control in free-range farming has been associated with outbreaks of avian influenza.|$|E
5|$|Chicken now {{provides}} some 20% {{of the animal}} protein eaten by the world's human population {{in the form of}} meat and eggs. Chickens are often raised intensively in battery farms; this facilitates production but has been criticised on <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> grounds. Other species including ducks, geese, pheasants, guineafowl and turkeys are significant economically around the world. Less commonly-raised species such as the ostrich are starting to be farmed for their meat, which is low in cholesterol; they have also been kept for their feathers, and for leather from their skin.|$|E

5|$|Commercial 'dolphin encounter' {{enterprises}} and tours operate in many countries. The documentary film The Cove documents how dolphins are captured {{and sold to}} some of these enterprises (particularly in Asia) while the remaining pod is slaughtered. In addition to such endeavors, the individuals swim with and surface near surfers at the beach. Bottlenose dolphins perform in many aquaria, generating controversy. <b>Animal</b> <b>welfare</b> activists and certain scientists have claimed that the dolphins do not have adequate space or receive adequate care or stimulation. However, others, notably SeaWorld (backed by different scientists), counter that the dolphins are properly cared for, have lots of environmental stimulation and enjoy interacting with humans.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{increase}} in population after protective legislation was put into place, the Department of Conservation developed a management plan for the Kaimanawa herd in 1989 and 1990. A draft plan was made available to the public for comment in 1991, and the public made it clear that it objected to herd reduction through shooting from helicopters, and instead favored the horses remaining alive after being removed from the herd. However, core <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> groups felt that shooting was the most humane option. Trial musters were conducted in 1993, 1994 and 1995, and were successful, although costly and with a limited demand for the captured horses.|$|E

His many activities brought him into the highest social and professional circles. Like other turn of the century hunters such as Teddy Roosevelt, he was an active campaigner for <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> and succeeded in seeing legal measures introduced for their protection.|$|E
40|$|There is a {{far-reaching}} agreement within western society, that a {{high level}} of <b>animal</b> health and <b>welfare</b> can be regarded as an ethical value. An increasing number of consumers are interested to purchase products that derive from animal-friendly housing conditions. Often animal-friendly and organic products are affiliated. Although the prescriptions of the EURegulation on organic agriculture clearly exceed the minimal standards of conventional livestock production, they do not automatically lead to a high status of <b>animal</b> health and <b>welfare.</b> <b>Animal</b> health status emerges from complex interactions within a farm system and thus is not primarily related to the production method or to minimal standards. Literature reviews indicate profound discrepancies between the claim and reality of <b>animal</b> health and <b>welfare</b> on organic farms. Conflicting areas on different levels within and between the groups of retailers, producers, and consumers are responsible that efforts with regard to improvments in relation to <b>animal</b> health and <b>welfare</b> have come to a standstill. In order to preserve the credibility of organic agriculture and the confidence of the consumers in organic products {{there is a need for}} more transparency and for a change in the paradigm from a standard-oriented to an output-oriented approach. Credible information about <b>animal</b> health and <b>welfare</b> has to be provided, which consumers are able to understand. Simultaneously, {{a high level of}} <b>animal</b> health and <b>welfare</b> has to be honoured by premium prices to cover the additional costs and efforts that are needed to improve the current situation...|$|R

5|$|Hunting {{dolphins}} (at {{the time}} still often incorrectly {{referred to as}} fish or porpoises), primarily using harpoons and firearms, was considered a form of recreational hunting along {{the shores of the}} Gulf of Mexico in Texas in the late 19th and early 20th century. Pleasure dolphin hunting cruises could be booked in Corpus Christi in the 1920s, with a promise to tourists that if no successful dolphin kill was made, the excursion would be free of charge. The brutality of the practice started to spark <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> concerns and there is no reference of this practice still occurring in Texas after the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the domesticated ponies {{there is a small}} herd of Eriskay ponies living in a feral state on the Holy Isle. These ponies are descended from a group of five ponies brought to the Holy Isle to when it was owned by the Universities Federation for <b>Animal</b> <b>Welfare</b> in the 1970s to form a nature reserve. Today the island is owned by the Samye Buddhist Centre for World Peace and Health. They operate a policy of non-intervention, allowing the ponies to live without human interference.|$|E
