5|$|In 1930, {{after the}} start of the Great Depression, the price of copper fell to 14cents <b>a</b> <b>pound.</b> In response, United Verde began {{reducing}} its work force; UVX operated at a loss, and the third big mine, Verde Central, closed completely. The price of copper fell further in 1932 to 5 cents <b>a</b> <b>pound,</b> leading to layoffs, temporary shut-downs, and wage reductions in the Verde District. In 1935, the Clark family sold United Verde to Phelps Dodge, and in 1938 UVX went out of business.|$|E

5|$|The {{drive for}} decimalisation of the {{currency}} in Britain dates {{as far back as}} 1682. Although nothing was done regarding early proposals, the adoption of a decimal currency in the United States, France and other nations in the late 18th and early 19th centuries renewed the call, and commissions in 1841 and 1843 called for its adoption. In 1847, a motion was introduced in Parliament by Sir John Bowring calling for the introduction of a decimal currency and the striking of coins of one-tenth and one-hundredth of <b>a</b> <b>pound.</b> Bowring obtained surprisingly strong support for his motion, and the Russell government promised that a coin valued at one-tenth of <b>a</b> <b>pound</b> (two shillings) would be produced to test public opinion, with consideration in future to be given to the introduction of other decimal coins.|$|E
5|$|The {{weight of}} an apothecaries' pound ranged {{generally}} between 300g and 320g, {{slightly less than}} that of <b>a</b> <b>pound</b> in the Roman Empire. An important exception to this rule is that the Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia was under rule of the Habsburg monarchy 1814–1859 and therefore had the extremely large Habsburg apothecaries' pound of 420g. (See below under Habsburg standard.) E.g. in the large city of Milan the apothecaries' system based on <b>a</b> <b>pound</b> of 326.8g was officially replaced by the metric system as early as 1803, because Milan was part of the Napoleonic Italian Republic. Since the successor of this little state, the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy, fell to Habsburg in 1814 (at a time when even in France the système usuel had been introduced because the metric system was not accepted by the population), an apothecaries' system was officially introduced again, but now based on the Habsburg apothecaries' pound, which weighed almost 30% more.|$|E
5|$|A {{commonly}} cited quote by Ralph Nader {{states that}} <b>a</b> <b>pound</b> of plutonium dust spread {{into the atmosphere}} {{would be enough to}} kill 8 billion people. However, calculations show that one pound of plutonium could kill no more than 2 million people by inhalation. This makes the toxicity of plutonium roughly equivalent with that of nerve gas. Nader's views were challenged in 1976 by Bernard Cohen, as described in the book Nuclear Power, Both Sides: The Best Arguments for and Against the Most Controversial Technology. Cohen's own estimate is that a dose of 200micrograms would likely be necessary to cause cancer.|$|E

5|$|Fool's Gold Loaf is a {{sandwich}} {{made by the}} Colorado Mine Company, a restaurant in Denver, Colorado.

The sandwich's connection to Elvis Presley {{is the source of}} its legend and prolonged interest. According to The Life and Cuisine of Elvis Presley, it was the focus of a midnight sandwich run by Elvis Presley and his friends. Taking his private jet from Graceland, Presley and his friends purchased 30 of the sandwiches and spent two hours eating them and drinking Perrier and champagne before flying home. The story became legend and the sandwich became the subject of continued media interest and part of numerous cookbooks, typically focused around Presley's love of food.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Captain Philip Broke and HMS Shannon, a 38-gun frigate, were patrolling off {{the port}} of Boston on {{blockade}} duty. Shannon had been {{under the command of}} Broke since 1806 and, under his direction, the crew held daily great gun and small arms drills lasting up to three hours each. Crew members who hit their bullseye were awarded <b>a</b> <b>pound</b> (454g) of tobacco for their good marksmanship. Broke had also fitted out his cannons with dispart and tangent sights to increase accuracy as well as degree bearings on the decks and gun carriages to allowable the crew to focus their fire on a specific target. In this regard Chesapeake, with traditional gun practice and a crew that had only been together for a few months, was greatly inferior.|$|E

From 1853 to 1857, Norton and the rice dealers were involved in a protracted litigation. Although Norton prevailed in the lower courts, the case reached the Supreme Court of California, which ruled against Norton. Later, the Lucas Turner and Company Bank foreclosed on his real estate holdings in North Beach to pay Norton's debt. He filed for bankruptcy and by 1858 was living in reduced circumstances at a working class boarding house.|$|E

5|$|The apothecaries' system {{often used}} the same ounces as the {{precious}} metals system, although even then the number of ounces in <b>a</b> <b>pound</b> could be different. The apothecaries' pound was divided into its own special units, which were inherited (via influential treatises of Greek physicians such as Dioscorides and Galen, 1st and 2nd century) from the general-purpose weight system of the Romans. Where the apothecaries' weights and the normal commercial weights were different, {{it was not always}} clear which of the two systems was used in trade between merchants and apothecaries, or by which system apothecaries weighed medicine when they actually sold it. In old merchants' handbooks the former system is sometimes referred to as the pharmaceutical system, and distinguished from the apothecaries' system.|$|E
5|$|The apothecaries' {{system or}} apothecaries' weights and {{measures}} is a historical system of mass and volume units that were used by physicians and apothecaries for medical recipes, and also sometimes by scientists. The English version {{of the system is}} closely related to the English troy system of weights, the pound and grain being exactly the same in both. It divides <b>a</b> <b>pound</b> into 12 ounces, an ounce into 8 drachms, and a drachm into 3 scruples or 60 grains. This exact form of the system was used in the United Kingdom; in some of its former colonies it survived well into the 20th century. The apothecaries' system of measures is a similar system of volume units based on the fluid ounce. For a long time, medical recipes were written in Latin, often using special symbols to denote {{weights and measures}}.|$|E
5|$|The {{basic form}} of the apothecaries' system is {{essentially}} {{a subset of the}} Roman weight system. An apothecaries' pound normally consisted of 12 ounces. (In France this was changed to 16 ounces, and in Spain the customary unit was the marco, a mark of 8 ounces.) In the south of Europe and in France, the scruple was generally divided into 24 grains, so that one ounce consisted of 576 grains. Nevertheless, the subdivision of an ounce was somewhat more uniform than that of <b>a</b> <b>pound,</b> and a common feature of all variants is that 12 ounces are roughly 100 drachms (96–128 drachms) and a grain is roughly the weight of a physical grain.|$|E
