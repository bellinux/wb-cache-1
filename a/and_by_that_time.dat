5|$|Belgrano studied {{near the}} {{intellectual}} elite of Spain, <b>and</b> <b>by</b> <b>that</b> <b>time</b> there were heated {{discussions about the}} ongoing French Revolution. The principles of equality and freedom, the universal scope of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, and criticism of the divine right of kings were constant topics of debate. Among the supporters of these ideas {{it was thought that}} Spain should be remade under similar principles, and critics of such thought were rejected as tyrants or proponents of outdated ideas. However, the Spanish Enlightenment was slightly different from the French one as it still respected religion and the monarchy. Thus, despite the new influences, Belgrano remained a strong Catholic and monarchist.|$|E
5|$|Due to a {{combination}} of land interaction and strong wind shear from Typhoon Ellis, Faye became less organized. At 0000UTC on August25, the JMA downgraded Faye to a severe tropical storm while the JTWC reduced it to tropical storm status. After re-emerging into open water, Faye turned northeast under the influence of Typhoon Ellis. Initially, re-intensification was expected to occur; however, the shear did not relent. Late on August26, the JMA estimated that Faye was no longer a tropical storm. By August27, Faye began to turn east despite the JTWC forecasting the storm to continue northeast and pass west of Japan. Additionally, Faye continued to weaken, <b>and</b> <b>by</b> <b>that</b> <b>time,</b> all the thunderstorm activity was displaced from the center. At 0600 UTC on August27, the JTWC discontinued warnings on the system as only a few areas of thunderstorm activity remained present. Despite this, the JMA continued to track the cyclone.|$|E

500|$|From what {{is known}} of Edward's character, he could be {{impulsive}} and temperamental, as was seen by his actions against Stratford and the ministers in 1340/41. At the same time, he was well known for his clemency; Mortimer's grandson was not only absolved, but came {{to play an important}} part in the French wars, and was eventually made a Knight of the Garter. Both in his religious views and his interests, Edward was a conventional man. His favourite pursuit was the art of war and, in this, he conformed to the medieval notion of good kingship. [...] As a warrior he was so successful that one modern military historian has described him as the greatest general in English history. He seems to have been unusually devoted to his wife, Queen Philippa. Much has been made of Edward's sexual licentiousness, but {{there is no evidence of}} any infidelity on the king's part before Alice Perrers became his lover, <b>and</b> <b>by</b> <b>that</b> <b>time</b> the queen was already terminally ill.

500|$|In {{the middle}} of October, the {{intertropical}} convergence zone (ITCZ) was active over the northeast portion of the basin and into the adjacent Australian region, spawning a low pressure area on October15 northwest of the Cocos Islands. With a large ridge to the south, the system tracked southwestward, crossing into the south-west Indian Ocean as a tropical depression on October17. Also on that day, the JTWC began issuing warnings on the system as Tropical Cyclone 4S. On October18, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Antoinette after developing a well-defined central dense overcast, and began turning more to the west-southwest. That day, Antoinette strengthened to a peak intensity of just below tropical cyclone status, or with 10minute winds just below 120km/h (75mph). Around that time, the storm developed an eye feature, but that quickly dissipated. Antoinette began weakening steadily on October20 due to increasing wind shear, <b>and</b> <b>by</b> <b>that</b> <b>time</b> it was moving quickly westward.

500|$|Ribes nigrum, the blackcurrant, is a {{medium-sized}} shrub, growing to [...] by [...] The leaves are alternate, simple, [...] broad and long with five palmate lobes and a serrated margin. All {{parts of the}} plant are strongly aromatic. The flowers are produced in racemes known as [...] "strigs" [...] up to [...] long containing ten to twenty flowers, each about [...] in diameter. Each flower has a hairy calyx with yellow glands, the five lobes of which are longer than the inconspicuous petals. There are five stamens surrounding the stigma and style and two fused carpels. The flowers open in succession {{from the base of}} the strig and are mostly insect pollinated, but some pollen is distributed by the wind. A pollen grain landing on a stigma will germinate and send a slender pollen tube down the style to the ovule. In warm weather this takes about 48 hours but in cold weather it may take a week, <b>and</b> <b>by</b> <b>that</b> <b>time,</b> the ovule may have passed the stage where it is receptive. If fewer than about 35 ovules are fertilised, the fruit may not be able to develop and will fall prematurely. Frost can damage both unopened and open flowers when the temperature falls below -1.9°C (28.5°F). The flowers at the base of the strig are more protected by the foliage and are less likely to be damaged.|$|E
500|$|The {{positive}} reception {{accorded to}} Diệm in 1957 contrasted with increasingly negative Australian attitudes towards South Vietnam.

After six months of civil unrest, Diệm was deposed and assassinated in November 1963, <b>and</b> <b>by</b> <b>that</b> <b>time,</b> little goodwill remained. With new leadership in Saigon, and an escalation in the war against the communists, Australia sent in ground troops—including conscripts—to support South Vietnam, but over time, the bipartisanship of the 1950s evaporated. The centre-left ALP became more sympathetic to the communists and Labor leader Arthur Calwell stridently denounced South Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyễn Cao Kỳ as a [...] "fascist dictator" [...] and a [...] "butcher" [...] ahead of his 1967 visit—at the time Kỳ was the chief of the Republic of Vietnam Air Force and headed a military junta. Despite the controversy leading up to the visit, Kỳ's trip was a success. He dealt with the media effectively, despite hostile sentiment from some sections of the press and public. However, with the war becoming increasing destructive, and the death toll rising, opposition to the Vietnam War grew. Jim Cairns, the chairman of the Vietnam Moratorium Committee, led large anti-war protests. Labor won the 1972 federal election on an anti-war platform, and Whitlam withdrew the last Australian troops from South Vietnam, and recognised North Vietnam. Whitlam later refused to accept South Vietnamese refugees following the fall of Saigon to the communists in April 1975. The Liberals—led by Malcolm Fraser—condemned Whitlam, and after defeating Labor in December 1975, allowed Vietnamese refugees to settle in Australia in large numbers.|$|E
