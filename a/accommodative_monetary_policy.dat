5|$|The IMF has {{reported}} that the global financial system is on a path to improved financial stability, but faces a host of transitional challenges borne out by regional vulnerabilities and policy regimes. One challenge is managing the United States' disengagement from its <b>accommodative</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>policy.</b> Doing so in an elegant, orderly manner could be difficult as markets adjust to reflect investors' expectations of a new monetary regime with higher interest rates. Interest rates could rise too sharply if exacerbated by a structural decline in market liquidity from higher interest rates and greater volatility, or by structural deleveraging in short-term securities and in the shadow banking system (particularly the mortgage market and real estate investment trusts). Other central banks are contemplating ways to exit unconventional monetary policies employed in recent years. Some nations however, such as Japan, are attempting stimulus programs at larger scales to combat deflationary pressures. The Eurozone's nations implemented myriad national reforms aimed at strengthening the monetary union and alleviating stress on banks and governments. Yet some European nations such as Portugal, Italy, and Spain continue to struggle with heavily leveraged corporate sectors and fragmented financial markets in which investors face pricing inefficiency and difficulty identifying quality assets. Banks operating in such environments may need stronger provisions in place to withstand corresponding market adjustments and absorb potential losses. Emerging market economies face challenges to greater stability as bond markets indicate heightened sensitivity to monetary easing from external investors flooding into domestic markets, rendering exposure to potential capital flights brought on by heavy corporate leveraging in expansionary credit environments.

40|$|There has {{probably}} {{never been a}} consensus among economists {{about the role of}} expectations in formulating <b>monetary</b> <b>policy.</b> Today two widely different views seem to dominate policy research and practice. One view, which I will refer to here as the "new classical macro-economic " view, is that expectations overwhelm the influence of <b>monetary</b> <b>policy,</b> so that even a sudden change in policy, if expected, will have no real effect on the economy. Sometimes simply, but not quite accurately, called "rational expectations, " this view implies that a dramatically quick disinflation could be achieved without recession, and also that <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> is ineffective in stabilizing output and employment. The other view, which I will refer to here as the "Keyne-sian " view, is that expectations matter little, either because they are exogenous, or because people are backward-looking and do not adjust to expectations of policy change. This view is embodied in most econometric models now used for policy evaluation in practice.

40|$|In 2013, the Federal Reserve {{publicly}} described {{conditions for}} scaling back and ultimately ending its highly <b>accommodative</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>policy.</b> Some emerging market countries subsequently experienced sharp reversals of capital inflows, resulting in sizable currency depreciation.

In the wake of the global financial crisis and recession of 2007 – 09, the Federal Reserve carried out a series of large-scale purchases of government and asset-backed securities to lower longer-term interest rates and provide additional stimulus to the economy. Following then-Chairman Ben Bernanke’s May 22, 2013, congressional testimony about the possibility that the Federal Reserve would begin scaling back these purchases—a reduction widely known as tapering—some financial market participants revised their beliefs about when the central bank would begin normalizing its highly <b>accommodative</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>policy.</b> Market participants moved forward the dates they expected the Fed to start reducing its large-scale asset purchases as well as the dates when they expected it to start raising the federal funds rate, its short-term policy interest rate (Bauer and Rudebusch 2013) ...|$|E

40|$|In {{the wake}} of the {{financial}} crisis of 2007, the largest economies of our times struggled hard with adverse economic shocks. Several central banks (CBs) employed their conventional <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> tools to their limits and beyond. When failing in their attempt, unconventional <b>monetary</b> <b>policies</b> got gradually introduced in order to stimulate the overall economy, to alleviate market dysfunctions and to reduce liquidity shortages. Building on diverse research conducted by international researchers and data provided by international economic institutions, this paper gives a comprehensive overview of different types of unconventional <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> tools that were, and still are, broadly employed. The concept of Quantitative Easing (QE) with its opportunities and risks will be elaborated, as well as appropriate exit strategies from these unconventional <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> measures. Putting a special focus on the QE programs run by the Bank of Japan, the Bank of England and the European Central Bank, the successes and failures of real-world examples of unconventional <b>monetary</b> <b>policies</b> will be analyzed in detail. In order to evaluate the usefulness of QE, a comparison of theoretical and real-world results will be conducted. The paper finds that even though QE had a broad range of positive effects on selected economic aspects, the risks of both over-indebtedness and a too strong dependence of economies on highly <b>accommodative</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>policies</b> prevail. Before considering an exit from QE – if still possible at all – many years of further monetary easing and economic stimulus will pass.

40|$|Unlike {{the crisis}} years of 2007 - 2009 (when the {{insolvency}} of large banks {{was a major}} problem), the current round of the global financial crisis has fiscal origins. Almost all developed countries suffer from an excessive public debt burden that has been built up {{over the last two}} decades or more. The financial crisis caused a further deterioration of government accounts as a result of ill-tailored countercyclical fiscal response and, in some cases, a costly financial sector rescue. All excessively indebted countries must conduct fiscal adjustment, even if this involves economic and political costs in terms of lower output and higher unemployment. Central banks can reduce these costs through <b>accommodative</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>policies</b> but without compromising their anti-inflationary missions and institutional independence. The ECB is additionally constrained by its institutional status which is based on a delicate cross-country political consensus. Excessive ECB involvement in quasi-fiscal rescue operations can undermine this consensus and lead to a disintegration of the Eurozone. There are also strong arguments in favor of strengthening fiscal and banking integration within the EU, especially the fiscal discipline mechanism at national levels, and building the EU rescue capacity in respect to sovereigns and banks based on strong policy conditionality...|$|R
