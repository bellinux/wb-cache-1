40|$|An annular arc {{accelerator}} (ANAA) {{shock tube}} driver {{has been developed}} that deposits the energy of an arc discharge into a flowing gas, which then expands and cools without any delay {{for the opening of}} a diaphragm.

The ANAA driver consists of a high-pressure driver, an expansion <b>section,</b> and an <b>electrode</b> <b>section.</b> In operation, the cold gas driver is pressurized until the diaphragm bursts, sending a pressure front down the expansion tube to the arc section.

A newly {{developed}} multi-wire {{electrical discharge machining}} (EDM) method would accomplish the high performance slicing of silicon and silicon carbide with a narrow kerf width under a clean process environment.

40|$|The Compact Torus (Spheromak-type) is a near ideal plasma {{confinement}} configuration for acceleration. The fields are mostly generated by internal plasma currents, {{plasma confinement}} is toroidal, and the compact torus exhibits resiliency {{and stability in}} virtue of the ``rugged`` helicity invariant. Based on these considerations we are developing a coaxial rail-gun type Compact Torus Accelerator (CTA). In the CTA, the CT ring is formed between coaxial electrodes using a magnetized Marshall gun, it is quasistatically ``precompressed`` in a conical <b>electrode</b> <b>section</b> for inductive energy storage, it is accelerated in a straight-coaxial <b>electrode</b> <b>section</b> as in a conventional rail-gun, and it is focused to small size and high energy and power density in a final ``focus`` cone section. The dynamics of slow precompression and acceleration have been demonstrated experimentally in the RACE device with results in good agreement with 2 -D MHD code calculations. CT plasma rings with 100 {micro}gms mass have been accelerated to 40 Kj kinetic energy at 20 % efficiency with final velocity = 1 X 10 {sup 8 } cm/s (= 5 KeV/H{sup +}).

40|$|A {{microwave}} cavity is described {{which can be}} used to cool lepton plasmas for potential use in synthesis of antihydrogen. The cooling scheme is an incarnation of the Purcell Effect: when plasmas are coupled to a {{microwave cavity}}, the plasma cooling rate is resonantly enhanced through increased spontaneous emission of cyclotron radiation. The cavity forms a three <b>electrode</b> <b>section</b> of a Penning-Malmberg trap and has a bulged cylindrical geometry with open ends aligned with the magnetic trapping axis.

40|$|The {{subject of}} the present work is the {{numerical}} verification and experimental validation of the FEM model which would enable us to analyse the vibrations of collecting electrodes. The effectiveness of electrostatic precipitators (ESP) depends on many factors. One of these factors is the efficiency of periodic cleaning of the collecting electrodes; thus the dust is removed by inducing vibrations. These vibrations are caused by the axial impact of a hammer on an anvil beam. In {{the course of the}} impact, and afterwards, the stresses due to the impact are produced in both the rapper system and in the collecting <b>electrode</b> <b>section.</b> The paper presents a modified finite element method which can be used in simulations and to analyse the vibrations of collecting electrodes.

An acceptable compatibility of the results proves that the model can be applied in the analysis of vibrations of electrodes in design practice...|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} a modification approach and first measurements of commercial cylindrical Li-ion cells with multiple local potential probes and an internal temperature sensor. Local potential measurements at low currents show a non-uniform potential distribution along the electrode, {{dominated by the}} open circuit voltage (OCV) of the negative electrode. For higher currents, the overpotential along the current collector becomes dominant and instead of a corrugated potential distribution, a significant current dependent voltage gradient can be detected, indicating a highly non-uniform state of charge (SOC) distribution with increasing distance to the current collecting tab. After the discharge operation, a quick potential equalization can be witnessed which results in a non-detectable potential difference between the single <b>electrode</b> <b>sections</b> after 12 min, even though the overall cell voltage relaxation has not reached an equilibrium state yet. The presented modification approach combines the advantages of high quality industrial manufactured cells showing uniform coating thicknesses and packing density with the advantages of special tailor made cells for in situ measurements. Due to the low impact of the modification and its long-term stability, highly reproducible measurements can be conducted at different locations of the electrodes...|$|R

The resulting reduction in manual operations and reduced reagent use can lead to significant cost savings in performing biological tests. The authors have explored the use of small scale dielectrophoresis and electrophoresis as a way to manipulate DNA for sample preparation in DNA-based assays. The use of electric fields to manipulate DNA is readily achieved in MEMS devices using standard photolithography techniques to <b>add</b> <b>electrodes</b> to etched flow channels. Dielectrophoresis allows for manipulation of cells and DNA independently of the liquid. This ability is useful in small, valveless fluidic microchips. An advantage of the use of the dielectrophoretic force over an electrophoretic force is that dielectrophoresis works equally well using an AC field, thus reducing trapping of small ions and mitigating electrochemical effects at the electrodes. However, the dielectrophoretic force on the DNA {{is a function of the}} volume of the particle; thus, there is a lower practical limit to use of the dielectrophoretic force. Consequently they have also explored methods of manipulating smaller DNA fragments using what they refer to as a stepped electrophoresis method...|$|R

40|$|In this work, {{developing}} a reagentless electrochemical glucose sensor by immobilizing the wild type enzyme onto semi-conductor silicon chips {{as well as}} screen-printed carbon electrodes, was attempted. In the first immobilization procedure, the substrates were modified with nitrobenzenediazonium and glutaraldehyde. The electrodes were then put in contact with a glucose solution. The changes introduced to the surface were monitored using impedance measurements, which show that the enzyme was successfully immobilized, but its active site seems to be unavailable for glucose binding. In the second immobilization procedure, the substrates were modified with an amine terminated NTA ligand.

40|$|Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) is {{more and}} more used for {{monitoring}} soil water content in a cropped soil. Yet, the impact of roots on the signal is often neglected and a topic of controversy. In several studies related to soil-root system, it has been showed that the measured root mass density statistically correlates with the electrical conductivity (EC) data obtained from ERT. In addition, some studies suggest that some roots are more electrically conductive than soil for most water content. Thus, higher EC of roots suggest that it might have a measurable impact on ERT signals. In this work, virtual rhizotrons are simulated using the software package called R-SWMS that solves water and solute transport in plant root-soil system, including root growth. The distribution of water content obtained from R-SWMS simulation is converted into EC data using pedo-physical models. The electrical properties of roots and rhizosphere are explicitly included in the EC data to form a conductivity map (CM) with a very detailed spatial resolution. Forward ERT simulations is then carried out for CM generated for various root architectures and soil conditions to study the impact of roots on ERT forward (current and voltage patterns) and inverse solutions. It is demonstrated that under typical injection schemes with lateral electrodes, root system is hardly measurable.
