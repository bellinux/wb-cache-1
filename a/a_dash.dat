5|$|Widerøe Flight 710 {{took place}} on 6 May 1988 when <b>a</b> <b>Dash</b> 7 crashed into nearby Torghatten {{mountain}} during a landing approach, killing all 36 aboard. It remains the worst accident involving <b>a</b> <b>Dash</b> 7 and is the fourth-worst accident on Norwegian soil.|$|E

5|$|For use in {{a binary}} digital computer, the tube had {{to be capable of}} storing either one of two states at each of its memory locations, {{corresponding}} to the binary digits (bits) 0 and1. It exploited the positive or negative electrostatic charge generated by displaying either <b>a</b> <b>dash</b> or a dot at any position on the CRT screen, a phenomenon known as secondary emission. <b>A</b> <b>dash</b> generated a positive charge, and a dot a negative charge, either of which could be picked up by a detector plate in front of the screen; a negative charge represented 0, and a positive charge1. The charge dissipated in about 0.2seconds, but it could be automatically refreshed from the data picked up by the detector.|$|E

5|$|Flight 710 was {{the second}} fatal and {{write-off}} accident of <b>a</b> <b>Dash</b> 7, and remains the deadliest. It {{was at the time}} the third-deadliest aviation accident in Norwegian history, after the 1961 Holtaheia Vickers Viking crash and Braathens SAFE Flight 239 in 1972. It has since become the fourth-deadliest by Vnukovo Airlines Flight 2801. It remains the deadliest accident in Northern Norway.|$|E
5|$|After a night-time advance, the 20th Battalion was {{positioned}} {{on the ridge}} in reserve behind the 18th and 19th Battalions. On daybreak, {{it was discovered that}} the advance had bypassed numerous strong points, leaving the German line in front of the ridge largely intact. The supporting British armour {{was nowhere to be seen}} and the supporting artillery and anti-tank units were unable to break through, leaving the two New Zealand brigades in position on the exposed ridge. Kippenberger had difficulty with his radio communications and made <b>a</b> <b>dash</b> through enemy lines to make contact with the British armour. On reaching one of the British brigades, its commanding officer resisted Kippenberger's entreaties to advance and it was not until a passing British general authorised the move that the British mounted up. By the time the armoured support arrived, the flanking battalion of the 5th Brigade had been overrun, leaving the battalions of the 4th Brigade even more exposed and receiving fire from the enemy.|$|E
5|$|By mid-afternoon {{of the day}} of the programme, protesters {{had begun}} {{gathering}} outside Television Centre and there were also protesters outside regional BBC offices. By 4.30pm (BST) police estimated there were 500 chanting protesters; around 25 people who reached the main entrance of Television Centre after breaking through a cordon were expelled. They were {{part of a group of}} about 40 people that had made <b>a</b> <b>dash</b> for an iron gate that had been left open. After this breach, stand-by officers reinforced the police cordon and protesters moved to block Wood Lane, hoping to prevent Griffin entering the studios. Griffin arrived at 5.17pm unnoticed and entered on foot through a rear entrance on Frithville Road. It was reported that around 600 people had turned up to protest against Griffin.|$|E

5|$|Hammerfest {{was served}} from 1935 by {{scheduled}} seaplanes at a water aerodrome at Rypefjord. Services were interrupted by World War II, but resumed in 1945, lasting until the 1963 opening of Alta Airport. Hammerfest Airport opened on 1 August 1974, along {{with four other}} regional airport in Finnmark and Troms, and was originally served with de Havilland Canada Twin Otters. The de Havilland Canada Dash 7 was introduced in 1983 and a helicopter base was established in 1989. The Dash 8 was introduced in 1995 and the airport was nationalized two years later. <b>A</b> <b>Dash</b> 8 was damaged beyond repair after a hard landing in 2005. Because of the limited space for expansion and unfavorable wind conditions, there is a proposal {{to build a new}} airport at Grøtnes.|$|E
5|$|Interviews with random {{pilots in}} Widerøe {{showed that the}} airline had {{shortcomings}} in its training procedures, {{in part because it}} lacked <b>a</b> <b>Dash</b> 7 simulator. There was a culture in the airline to divert from cockpit procedures and cooperation. The flight plans often made procedures for mutual control of procedures impractical, and they were commonly skipped. The commission was of the impression that Widerøe's transition from an all-Twin Otter airline to also operate the more demanding Dash 7 was not properly carried out, which had resulted shortcomings in the training and operating procedures. All checklists during the flight were followed correctly. However, the pilots did not elect a method of double-control of the descent and approach, such as by using briefings and callouts.|$|E
5|$|The event's fifth leg saw a {{breakaway}} succeed; {{the group}} began with five riders and {{was reduced to}} three riders – Erik Breukink, Filippo Casagrande, and Rolf Sørensen – before the finish. Casagrande won the three-man sprint to the line to take the day. The sixth stage resulted in a field sprint that was won by Nicola Minali. The seventh stage featured an undulating stage profile, with a slight uphill finish. On the race's final incline, Rominger attacked but his move was marked by several general classification contenders. Maurizio Fondriest managed to edge out Rominger in <b>a</b> <b>dash</b> for the line which saw him gain four seconds on Rominger due to time bonuses. The eighth stage featured the first summit finish of the race, to Massiccio del Sirino. The day's breakaway was established {{early on in the}} day and managed to reach the final climb before the pursuing peloton. Stage winner Laudelino Cubino attacked with eight kilometers to go and rode solo until the finish; the time he gained during the stage allowed him to move into third overall.|$|E

5|$|To {{catch the}} public's attention, this train {{was not simply}} rolled out of the factory; it made <b>a</b> <b>dash</b> {{from one end of}} the CB, in Denver, to the other, in Chicago on May 26, 1934. The {{railroad}} spared no expense in planning the operations. All other trains along the Zephyrs route were diverted to sidings and the turnouts were spiked into the proper alignment for the Zephyrs run. Track and maintenance of way workers checked every spike and bolt along the train's route to ensure that there would not be any problems, and temporary speed signs were installed along the route to warn the Zephyrs crew of curves that would be dangerous at high speeds. On the day of the dash, every road grade crossing was manned by a flagman to stop automobile traffic ahead of the train and to ensure that the crossing was clear. Stations along the route were protected by local police officers and members of the American Legion and the Boy Scouts of America.|$|E
5|$|In October 2010, {{the network}} {{announced}} another spin-off called Kourtney and Kim Take New York which {{followed the same}} format as its predecessor. The show debuted on January 23, 2011, and followed the sisters who opened <b>a</b> <b>Dash</b> location in New York City. The series returned for another season which premiered on November 27 the same year. In January 2011, Khloé & Lamar, which featured Khloé and her husband Lamar Odom, became the third spin-off of Keeping Up with the Kardashians. The show premiered on April 10, 2011, and lasted two seasons. In March 2014, E! announced the fourth spin-off entitled Kourtney and Khloé Take The Hamptons. The series premiered on November 2, 2014, and followed Kourtney and Khloé who relocated to the Hamptons to work on opening a new Dash pop-up store. The fifth spin-off series called Dash Dolls premiered on September 20, 2015. The reality series chronicles the daily life of the employees of the Dash boutique in Los Angeles. In June 2016, the network announced another show entitled Rob & Chyna which premiered on September 11 the same year, and follows the relationship of Rob Kardashian and Blac Chyna as they prepare to welcome their first child. The show was later renewed for a second season. In July 2017, E! confirmed the series was put on hold, and not on their current schedule.|$|E
5|$|The Egyptian {{identification}} card controversy {{began in the}} 1990s when the government modernized the electronic processing of identity documents, which introduced a de facto requirement that documents must list the person's religion as Muslim, Christian, or Jewish (the only three religions officially recognized by the government). Consequently, Bahá'ís were unable to obtain government identification documents (such as national {{identification card}}s, birth certificates, death certificates, marriage or divorce certificates, or passports) necessary to exercise their rights in their country unless they lied about their religion, which conflicts with Bahá'í religious principle. Without documents, {{they could not be}} employed, educated, treated in hospitals, travel outside of the country, or vote, among other hardships. Following a protracted legal process culminating in a court ruling favorable to the Bahá'ís, the interior minister of Egypt released a decree on 14 April 2009, amending the law to allow Egyptians who are not Muslim, Christian, or Jewish to obtain identification documents that list <b>a</b> <b>dash</b> in place of one of the three recognized religions. The first identification cards were issued to two Bahá'ís under the new decree on 8 August 2009.|$|E

5|$|The naval {{section of}} Alsos flew into Paris soon {{after it had}} been liberated in August 1944. They went down to Bordeaux to inspect the {{captured}} German destroyer Z39. After the Alsos Mission became convinced that the Germans had not developed an atomic bomb, the naval section became the Naval Technical Mission Europe. They were {{particularly interested in the}} work of Dr Hellmuth Walter in the development of submarines and rockets. Most of the targets that they were interested in lay in the British sector, so they worked closely with their English allies. In {{the last days of the}} war, the Naval Technical Mission was part of a 75-man task force, most of whom were from 30 Assault Unit, that made <b>a</b> <b>dash</b> for Kiel, entering the city far in advance of the Allied advance. The whole garrison of the city, some 150,000 men, surrendered to the task force. They drove to Admiral Karl Dönitz's headquarters in Flensburg, where they saw but did not speak with him, as Dönitz was on his way to surrender. They spoke instead to Admiral Otto Backenköhler, and persuaded him to sign a release for German scientists, so men like Walter could freely discuss their work with the Allies. From April to December 1945, Mumma also served as assistant naval attaché.|$|E
