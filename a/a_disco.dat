5|$|In 1975 Pryce married Fenella, more {{commonly}} known as Nella, whom he met at <b>a</b> <b>disco</b> in Otford, Kent in 1973.

5|$|Celebrities, artists, {{and merchants}} enjoyed fine food, opium, and liquor at the Great Southern Hotel, which had novel Western pleasures, such as <b>a</b> <b>disco</b> ball {{specially}} {{imported from the}} USA. The allure of Western goods and traditions even extended to weddings held at the hotel. A prolific Chinese writer, Wu Sijing, held her 17-table wedding banquet there in 1952, and was photographed in a white bridal dress, {{with her husband in}} a white suit and bowtie. This choice of dress would have been most unusual amongst mainland Chinese due to the nationalistic influence of Mao-era China, highlighting Singapore's confluence between Eastern and Western cultures, of which the hotel was at the forefront. Both in decor, and activities.|$|E
5|$|In early 1971, Deacon was {{introduced}} to Taylor and May by a friend at <b>a</b> <b>disco</b> who told him {{that they were in}} a band that had just lost its bassist. A couple of days later he auditioned in a lecture room at Imperial College London and became the last member of Queen to join. Since the band's last bassist drew attention away from Mercury, Deacon was selected for his musical talent, his quiet demeanour and his electrical skills. A persistent legend claims Deacon was the seventh bassist auditioned, but more recent sources show Queen's bassists were, in order: Mike Grose, Barry Mitchell, Doug Bogie and Deacon. Deacon played his first show with Queen at the College of Estate Management in Kensington in June.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, dance-oriented disco music was {{very popular in}} the United States, {{particularly}} after being featured in hit films such as Saturday Night Fever (1977). Despite its popularity, disco sparked a backlash from rock music fans. This opposition was prominent enough that the White Sox, seeking to fill seats at Comiskey Park during a lackluster season, engaged Chicago shock jock and anti-disco campaigner Steve Dahl for the promotion at the July12 doubleheader, the Thursday preceding the All-Star break. Dahl's sponsoring radio station was 97.9 WLUP-FM, so attendees would pay 98 cents and bring <b>a</b> <b>disco</b> record; between games, Dahl would destroy the collected vinyl in an explosion.|$|E
5|$|The duo wrote three songs while touring {{in support}} of their debut album Felt Mountain, but decided to take their work in a {{different}} direction with more rhythmic music. Goldfrapp chose to record in a studio in a Bohemian area of Bath, England, because they needed a place to put their equipment and start working. The band began working on the album in January 2002 with a list of songs they wanted to try to record, such as <b>a</b> <b>disco</b> song with only string instruments. The studio's walls were covered in neon lights and Alison Goldfrapp used them to write down her song ideas. They recorded early demos and worked on pre-production using a Yamaha 02R digital mixing console. Goldfrapp held jam sessions with Mark Linkous and Adrian Utley and, after they built momentum writing the album, decided not to move to another studio.|$|E

The bomb killed eleven soldiers and six civilians; 30 people were injured.|$|E
25|$|Soja is {{generally}} {{credited with the}} Baccara formula—consisting of breathy lyrics, lush backing, <b>a</b> <b>disco</b> beat and the striking image of two women (Mateos dressed in black, Mendiola in white) dancing. While drawing lightly on Spanish flamenco song and dance tradition, the formula was very much rooted in 1970s disco music. Soja's song arrangements generally used Mateos as the lead singer while Mendiola contributed backing and refrains.|$|E

25|$|In {{the fall}} of 2006, the {{collecting}} society Sociedad General de Autores y Editores (SGAE) in Spain sued Ricardo Andrés Utrera Fernández, owner of <b>a</b> <b>disco</b> bar located in Badajoz who played CC-licensed music. SGAE argued that Fernández should pay royalties for public performance of the music between November 2002 and August 2005. The Lower Court rejected the collecting society's claims because {{the owner of the}} bar proved that the music he was using was not managed by the society.|$|E
25|$|The {{university}} is also host to various student pranks.

Because there is no access to the spire atop the tower, how the items were put in place remains a mystery. The colors of the lights on McGraw tower change to orange for Halloween and green for St. Patrick's Day. The clock tower also plays music.|$|E
