Flapless surgery is an alternate technique, where a small punch of tissue (the diameter of the implant) is removed for implant placement rather than raising flaps.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the fifth}} week, {{there is an}} opening in the fetal heart known as the foramen ovale.

40|$|Flapping flight {{mechanisms}} {{offers a}} power-efficient and highly manoeuvrable {{basis for the}} development of micro air vehicles. The aerodynamic knowledge and prediction tools of the flapping wing are quite important for the design of micro air vehicles. In this paper, the unsteady aerodynamics of <b>a</b> <b>flapping</b> wing is investigated by numerical simulations and the generation of reduced-order model based on the Volterra theory for predicting the unsteady aerodynamic of <b>a</b> <b>flapping</b> wing is described. The three dimensional aerodynamic calculation is performed by solving the unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations and the user-defined functions were employed to simulate the flapping motion. The training maneuver is <b>a</b> <b>flapping</b> motion with <b>a</b> linearly increasing <b>flapping</b> frequency. Based on the Volterra theory and numerical simulation results, a reduced-order model is generated to predict the unsteady aerodynamics of <b>a</b> <b>flapping</b> wing. The system identification method is employed to generate the Volterra theory reduced-order model. The results show that the Volterra theory reduced-order model agrees well with the training data and the Volterra theory reduced-order model works well to predict the unsteady aerodynamics of <b>a</b> <b>flapping</b> wing.

5|$|Polyps feed on {{a variety}} of small organisms, from {{microscopic}} zooplankton to small fish. The polyp's tentacles immobilize or kill prey using their nematocysts. These cells carry venom which they rapidly release in response to contact with another organism. A dormant nematocyst discharges in response to nearby prey touching the trigger (cnidocil). <b>A</b> <b>flap</b> (operculum) opens and its stinging apparatus fires the barb into the prey. The venom is injected through the hollow filament to immobilise the prey; the tentacles then manoeuvre the prey to the mouth.|$|E
5|$|The {{fruit body}} {{formation}} of L.torminosus is pileostipitocarpic. In {{this type of}} development, the hymenium forms early {{on the underside of}} the cap and upper stem of the mushroom primordium. As the cap enlarges, the margin, made of flaring filamentous hyphae that grow outward and downward, tends to curve inward, eventually forming <b>a</b> <b>flap</b> of tissue roughly parallel to the stem surface. As further development takes place, these hyphae make contact with and adhere to the hymenial surface of the stem, covering basidia and macrocystidia (very long cystidia) already present. The junction between the two tissues produces a cavity that provides some temporary protection to the basidia, although they are already fertile when the cap margin starts to grow.|$|E

The mouth is wide and arched, with prominent furrows at the corners.

5|$|The condor soars {{with its}} wings held {{horizontally}} and its primary feathers bent upwards at the tips. The {{lack of a}} large sternum to anchor its correspondingly large flight muscles physiologically identifies it as primarily being a soarer. It flaps its wings on rising from the ground, but after attaining a moderate elevation it flaps its wings very rarely, relying on thermals to stay aloft. Charles Darwin commented on having watched them {{for half an hour}} without once observing <b>a</b> <b>flap</b> of their wings. It prefers to roost on high places from which it can launch without major wing-flapping effort. Andean condors are often seen soaring near rock cliffs, using the heat thermals to aid them in rising in the air.|$|E
5|$|While TBI may {{be managed}} without surgery, {{surgical}} repair of the tear is considered {{standard in the}} treatment of most TBI. It is required if a tear interferes with ventilation; if mediastinitis (inflammation of the tissues in the mid-chest) occurs; or if subcutaneous or mediastinal emphysema progresses rapidly; or if air leak or large pneumothorax is persistent despite chest tube placement. Other indications for surgery are a tear more than one third the circumference of the airway, tears with loss of tissue, and a need for positive pressure ventilation. Damaged tissue around a rupture (e.g. torn or scarred tissue) may be removed in order to obtain clean edges that can be surgically repaired. Debridement of damaged tissue can shorten the trachea by as much as 50%. Repair of extensive tears can include sewing <b>a</b> <b>flap</b> of tissue taken from the membranes surrounding the heart or lungs (the pericardium and pleura, respectively) over the sutures to protect them. When lung tissue is destroyed as a result of TBI complications, pneumonectomy or lobectomy (removal of a lung or of one lobe, respectively) may be required. Pneumonectomy is avoided whenever possible due to the high rate of death associated with the procedure. Surgery to repair a tear in the tracheobronchial tree can be successful even when it is performed months after the trauma, as can occur if the diagnosis of TBI is delayed. When airway stenosis results after delayed diagnosis, surgery is similar to that performed after early diagnosis: the stenotic section is removed and the cut airway is repaired.|$|E

5|$|Pericoronitis is {{inflammation}} of the soft tissues surrounding the crown of a partially erupted tooth. The lower wisdom tooth is the last tooth to erupt into the mouth, and is, therefore, more frequently impacted, or stuck, against the other teeth. This leaves the tooth partially erupted into the mouth, and there frequently is <b>a</b> <b>flap</b> of gum (an operculum), overlying the tooth. Bacteria and food debris accumulate beneath the operculum, which {{is an area that}} is difficult to keep clean because it is hidden and far back in the mouth. The opposing upper wisdom tooth also tends to have sharp cusps and over-erupt because it has no opposing tooth to bite into, and instead traumatizes the operculum further. Periodontitis and dental caries may develop on either the third or second molars, and chronic inflammation develops in the soft tissues. Chronic pericoronitis may not cause any pain, but an acute pericoronitis episode is often associated with pericoronal abscess formation. Typical signs and symptoms of a pericoronal abscess include severe, throbbing pain, which may radiate to adjacent areas in the head and neck, redness, swelling and tenderness of the gum over the tooth. There may be trismus (difficulty opening the mouth), facial swelling, and rubor (flushing) of the cheek that overlies the angle of the jaw. Persons typically develop pericoronitis in their late teens and early 20s, as this is the age that the wisdom teeth are erupting. Treatment for acute conditions includes cleaning the area under the operculum with an antiseptic solution, painkillers, and antibiotics if indicated. After the acute episode has been controlled, the definitive treatment is usually by tooth extraction or, less commonly, the soft tissue is removed (operculectomy). If the tooth is kept, good oral hygiene is required to keep the area free of debris to prevent recurrence of the infection.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a method for}} designing <b>a</b> <b>flapping</b> wing stroke for <b>a</b> <b>flapping</b> wing vehicle. <b>A</b> <b>flapping</b> wing vehicle is a vehicle such as a bird or an insect that uses its wings for propulsion instead of a conventional propeller or a jet engine. The intent {{of this research is}} to design a wing stroke that the wings can follow which will maintain the vehicle at a desired longitudinal flight path angle and velocity. The cost function is primarily a function of the flight path angle error, velocity error and control rate. The objective maneuver is to achieve a flight condition similar to the trim of a conventional fixed wing aircraft. Gliding configurations of the vehicle are analyzed to better understand flight in minimal energy configurations as well as the modes of the vehicle. A control law is also designed using Lyapunov?s direct method that achieves stable tracking of the wing stroke. Results are presented that demonstrate the ability of the method to design wing strokes that can maintain the vehicle at various flight path angles and velocities. The results of this research show that an optimal control problem can be posed such that the solution of the problem results in a wing stroke that <b>a</b> <b>flapping</b> wing vehicle can use to achieve a desired maneuver. The vehicle velocity is shown to be stable in controlled gliding flight and flapping flight...|$|R
