25|$|It {{was common}} {{knowledge}} , {{not only that}} the decisions of the Judicial Committee in the Canadian cases had not given widespread satisfaction, but also that the Constitution of the United States was a subject entirely unfamiliar to English lawyers, while to Australian publicists it was almost <b>as</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>as</b> the British Constitution. It was known that, even if there should be any members of the Judicial Committee familiar with the subject, it was quite uncertain whether they would form members of a Board that might be called upon to determine a question on appeal from an Australian Court, by which it must necessarily be dealt with in the first instance. It could not be predicted of the Board, which would sit to entertain an appeal, that it would be constituted with any regard to the special familiarity of its members with the subject. And no disrespect is implied in saying that the eminent lawyers who constituted the Judicial Committee were not regarded either as being familiar with the history or conditions of the remoter portions of the Empire, or as having any sympathetic understanding of the aspirations of the younger communities which had long enjoyed the privilege of self-government. On the other hand, the founders of the Australian Constitution were familiar with the part which the Supreme Court of the United States, constituted of Judges imbued with the spirit of American nationality, and knowing that the nation must work out its own destiny under the Constitution as framed, or as amended from time to time, had played {{in the development of the}} nation, and the harmonious working of its political institutions.|$|E
500|$|W. L. George {{described}} the fictional Baron as a [...] "comic giant" [...] of literature, describing his boasts as [...] "splendid, purposeless lie {{born of the}} joy of life". Théophile Gautier fils highlighted that the Baron's adventures are endowed with an [...] "absurd logic pushed to the extreme and which backs away from nothing". According to an interview, Jules Verne relished reading the Baron stories as a child, and used them as inspiration for his own adventure novels. Thomas Seccombe commented that [...] "Munchausen has undoubtedly achieved ... The Baron's notoriety is universal, his character proverbial, and his name <b>as</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>as</b> that of Mr. Lemuel Gulliver, or Robinson Crusoe." ...|$|E
500|$|Every shot in {{the film}} passed through the hands of eight {{different}} teams. The art department gave each shot its color scheme and general lighting. Under Craig Good, the layout department then placed the models in the shot, framed it by setting {{the location of the}} virtual camera, and programmed any camera movement. To make the medium feel <b>as</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>as</b> possible, they sought to stay within the limits of what might be done in a live-action film with real cameras, dollies, tripods, and cranes. Headed by directing animators Rich Quade and Ash Brannon, each shot went to the animation department from the layout. Lasseter opted against Disney's approach of assigning an animator to work on a character throughout a film, but made certain exceptions in scenes where he thought acting was particularly critical. The animators used the Menv program to set each character in the desired pose. Once a sequence of hand-built poses (or [...] "keyframes") was created, the software would build poses for the frames in-between. The animators studied videotapes of the actors for inspiration, and Lasseter rejected automatic lip-syncing. To sync the characters' mouths and facial expressions to the actors' recorded voices, animators spent a week per 8 seconds of animation.|$|E

5000|$|The initial Billboard review from October 29, 1966 {{wrote that}} [...] "It's an {{important}} {{addition to the}} Christmas shelf because Mancini's arrangements are <b>as</b> fresh and <b>familiar</b> <b>as</b> the material is <b>familiar</b> and lasting." ...|$|R
500|$|Most critics felt KMFDM {{stayed close}} to its usual sound on WTF?!. [...] David Jeffries of Allmusic commented, [...] "The 'ultra heavy beat' sounds as 'ultra' and 'heavy' as ever on WTF?!" [...] He {{went on to say}} the album was [...] "an {{outstanding}} blast of dark dancefloor destruction" [...] and saying the album should be on [...] "the top shelf". [...] Gregory Burkart of FearNet mostly praised the album, saying that while the band doesn't [...] "break new creative ground" [...] on WTF?!, which he said wasn't the [...] "heaviest, fastest or most experimental album", it was [...] "still rock-solid, sporting some outstanding melodies and rhythms, and many memorable moments". [...] Ilker Yücel of ReGen Magazine called WTF?! a [...] "hard-hitting dose of industrial rock that is <b>as</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>as</b> it is unusual". [...] He concluded his review by saying, [...] "In short, it’s KMFDM by-the-numbers, and after 27 years, that's not a bad thing at all." [...] Mark von Pfeiffer of Magnetic said, [...] "WTF? is typical: electronic used to augment electric to over-human speeds and volumes, outrageous claims made in the 3rd-person". [...] He also thought the album was more accessible, saying, [...] "This is industrial, but edible for most anyone looking for a bit of roughage on their playlist." [...] Petra Whiteley of Reflections of Darkness called WTF?! [...] "a solid release bursting with power and determination". [...] She also said of KMFDM, [...] "musically they are not far of their centre and typical sound, which is not a bad thing".|$|E
2500|$|Allen again {{made a few}} changes, {{including}} the singing DeMarco Sisters, to whom he'd been tipped by arranger-composer Gordon Jenkins. [...] "We did four years with Mr. Allen and got one thousand dollars a week," [...] Gloria DeMarco remembered. [...] "Sunday night was the best night on radio." [...] Sunday night with Fred Allen seemed incomplete on any night listeners didn't hear the DeMarco Sisters, whose breezy, harmonious style became <b>as</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>as</b> their cheerfully sung [...] "Mr. Al-len, Mr. Alll-llennnn" [...] in the show's opening theme. During the theme's brief pause, Allen would say something like, [...] "It isn't the mayor of Anaheim, Azusa and Cucamonga, kiddies." [...] That device became a signature for {{three of the four}} years.|$|E
2500|$|Slant Magazine writer Jeremy Winograd called Skeleton Tree [...] "Cave's darkest, most emotionally devastating work to date" [...] {{and said}} that {{although}} it [...] "may not be Cave's most accessible album, owing both to the experimental nature {{of much of the}} music and the fact that its level of emotional rawness makes it a legitimately uncomfortable listen in places, it may very well be his best"; Wingrod rated the album four-and-a-half-out-of-five stars. Clash gave Skeleton Tree a nine-out-of-ten rating, with reviewer Josh Gray praising Cave and Ellis' songwriting and arrangements and summarising the album as [...] "a stark, beautiful rendering of deep, profound pain." [...] Paula Mejia wrote in Paste that [...] "Skeleton Tree strips down embellishments and brings to the forefront sinister bass lines and a synthesizer that will widen the tear in your heart a little more with every note"; Mejia concluded that [...] "there's something to be said about Skeleton Tree and its starkness, which is <b>as</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>as</b> life and death, an elegy, and a hell of a thing to forget", rating the album nine out of ten. Pitchfork gave the album a nine-out-of-ten rating and selected it as the week's [...] "Best New Music"; [...] "I Need You" [...] was also selected as the week's [...] "Best New Track" [...] and was described as [...] "the stirring core of the Bad Seeds' devastating new album." ...|$|E
60|$|He did so. We waited five nerve-straining minutes--ten minutes --how long it did seem!--and {{then came}} a click that was <b>as</b> <b>familiar</b> to me <b>as</b> a human voice; for Clarence had been my own pupil.|$|R
6000|$|She watched Bailey furtively. The firm {{lines of}} his face, his sturdy figure, and his frank, brusque manner were <b>as</b> <b>familiar</b> to her <b>as</b> {{the face of}} Rivers, and almost as dear--but she could not speak! ...|$|R

6000|$|Such are the [...] "contemporary foreign {{politics}}," [...] the [...] "French politics" [...] {{which the}} author knows--as intimately as Bacon might have known them.

6000|$|She {{interrupted}} {{him for the}} third time. [...] "Emily?" [...] she repeated. [...] "Are you <b>as</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>as</b> that already?

60|$|The halls {{were lined}} with faces, {{everyone}} <b>as</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>as</b> the scarred and scratched wall of the court room, and yet all were now alien--no one recognized him by a frank and friendly nod, and he moved past his old companions with sullen and rigid face.

50|$|This small, stump-tailed wren {{is almost}} <b>as</b> <b>familiar</b> in Europe <b>as</b> the robin. It is mouse-like, easily {{lost sight of}} when it is hunting for food, but is found {{everywhere}} from {{the tops of the}} highest moors to the sea coast.|$|R
5000|$|On {{hearing of}} Hawthorne's death, Alan Bennett {{described}} {{him in his}} diary, [...] "Courteous, grand, {{a man of the}} world and superb at what he did, with his technique never so obvious <b>as</b> to become <b>familiar</b> <b>as,</b> say, Olivier's did or Alec Guinness's." ...|$|R
60|$|All the {{characteristics}} of a splendid antique civilisation are mirrored in this marvellous poem, and Mr. Crawford's admirable translation should make the wonderful heroes of Suomi song <b>as</b> <b>familiar</b> if not <b>as</b> dear to our people as the heroes of the great Ionian epic.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{spirit of}} the age is, indeed, working wonders {{in the way you}} mean," [...] said John Effingham.

60|$|To Honora his {{appearance}} was <b>as</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>as</b> {{the picture of}} the Pope which had always stood on Catherine's bureau.

60|$|I got down, {{opened it}} in the middle (as my father had taught me, in order to spare the binding), opened it on a page inky black as night all over, but starred with a design <b>as</b> <b>familiar</b> to me <b>as</b> the lines on the palm of my hand.|$|R
40|$|Amidst {{the rising}} tide of anti-immigration across all of Europe – which now {{includes}} Eastern and Southern Europeans <b>as</b> much <b>as</b> <b>familiar</b> targets such <b>as</b> Muslims or undocumented Africans – there has been little questioning of the dominant mainstream progressive response to the consequences of migration: that ‘integration’ is the best and most realistic solution for nations now having to accommodate the populations who have moved into or around Europe during the past two highly mobile decades of the 1990 s and 2000 s ( [...] .) ...|$|R
60|$|They {{had always}} lived upon {{the banks of}} this same river, so that every curve and sweep of its waters, every pit and shallow of its bed, every rock and stump and wallow upon its bank was <b>as</b> <b>familiar</b> to them <b>as</b> their own mothers.

60|$|Like shadows the Kor-ul-ja {{melted into}} the {{concealment}} of the foliage upon {{either side of}} the trail.

Suddenly the quiet of that seeming peace was shattered by a savage cry and a hurled club felled a Kor-ul-lul.|$|E
60|$|Honor was {{a little}} alarmed by all this, and {{designed}} a conference with the old housekeeper, Mrs. Stubbs, to inquire into her master's health, {{but this was not}} attainable that night, and she could only go to bed in the friendly old wainscoted room, whose white and gold carved monsters on the mantelpiece were well-nigh <b>as</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>as</b> the dove in Woolstone-lane; but, oh! how it made her long for the mother whom she used to kiss there.|$|E
