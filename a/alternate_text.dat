50|$|Most Korean webpages (such as weather, {{search engine}} Naver and news) {{incorporate}} Flash and images, preferably animated. Often text is substituted with images {{in such a}} way that in order to copy and/or translate it visitor has to type it manually or, in the best case, take it from <b>alternate</b> <b>text</b> of the image. The impression is that widespread broadband created a stimulus for web developers to write overly complex and rich web-pages, which can even make the browser work slowly (when about twenty pages are opened at once).

40|$|The {{number of}} persons with disabilities {{accessing}} e-government is growing, although this growth has not come without issues. Although some countries have legal protection to ensure equal access to web sites, including e-government sites, {{the mere presence of}} a law does not guarantee compliance. This research examines the accessibility of e-government web sites for 12 developing and developed countries. The research found that there were serious accessibility issues for all e-government sites, even those whose governments claimed adherence to accessibility standards or legislation. The results show a variety of accessibility problems with the sites, but most issues were centered on a minority of specific industry checkpoint errors, such as lack of providing <b>alternate</b> <b>text</b> for images.

40|$|INTRODUCTION In this demonstration, {{we present}} a system {{designed}} to find semantically relevant images that are embedded in HTML documents in the WWW. The system has been implemented in Java on a Sun Sparc machine, and our experimental study showed {{the effectiveness of the}} system [1]. 2. IMAGE REPRESENTATION MODEL The main observation that we made is that an embedded image's semantics are typically captured by its surrounding text in the document. We have identified four parts of the textual content that are well related to the embedded image. These are the image title, image ALT (<b>alternate</b> <b>text),</b> image caption and page title. To represent the image semantics more adequately, we propose the Weight ChainNet model that is based on the concept of lexical chain. A lexical chain (LC) is a sequence of semantically related words in a text. Here, we define it as one sentence that carries certain semantics by its words...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{introduces}} {{an application}} using computer vision for letter hand gesture recognition. A digital camera records a video stream of hand gestures. The hand is automatically segmented, {{the position of}} the hand centroid is calculated in each frame, and a trajectory of the hand is determined. After smoothing the trajectory, a sequence of angles of motion along the trajectory is calculated and quantized to form a discrete observation sequence. Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are used to recognize the letters. Baum Welch and Viterbi Path Counting algorithms are applied for training the HMMs. Our system recognizes all 26 letters from A to Z and the database contains 30 example videos of each letter gesture. We achieve an average recognition rate of about 90 percent. A motivation for the development of this system is to provide an <b>alternate</b> <b>text</b> input mechanism for camera enabled handheld devices, such as video mobile phones and PDAs...|$|E

40|$|Object space text, {{although}} {{desirable for}} its correct occlusion behavior, often appears blurry or “shimmery” due to rapidly <b>alternating</b> <b>text</b> thickness when used with head tracked binocular stereo viewing. Text thickness tends to vary because {{it depends on}} scan conversion, which in turn depends on the user’s location in a head tracked environment, and the user almost never stays perfectly still. This paper describes a simple method of eliminating such blurriness for object space text that need not have a fixed location in the virtual environment, such as menu system and annotation text. Our approach positions text relative to the user’s view frustums (one frustum per eye), adjusting the 3 D position of each piece of text as the user moves, so that the text occupies a constant place {{in each of the}} view frustums and projects to the same pixels regardless of the user’s location...|$|R

[...] This continual re-use and spontaneous adaptation of existing words and tunes is an important feature of the oral folk music tradition that [...] "Say, Brothers" [...] and the [...] "John Brown Song" [...] were embedded in and no one would have begrudged their use or re-use of these folk materials.
