5|$|Inflorescences (clusters of flowers) of {{at least}} 60plant {{families}} are eaten by lemurs {{ranging in size from}} the tiny mouse lemurs to the relatively large ruffed lemurs. If the flowers are not exploited, sometimes the nectar is consumed (nectarivory) along with the pollen (palynivory). At least 24native species from 17plant families <b>are</b> <b>targeted</b> for nectar or pollen consumption.|$|E
5|$|An ambush predator, the Pacific {{angelshark}} conceals {{itself on}} the sea floor and waits for approaching prey, primarily bony fishes and squid. Prey <b>are</b> <b>targeted</b> visually and, with a quick upward thrust of the head, snatched in protrusible jaws. Individual sharks actively choose ideal ambush sites, where they stay for several days {{before moving on to}} a new one. This species is more active at night than during the day, when it stays buried in sediment and seldom moves. Reproduction is ovoviviparous, with the embryos hatching inside the mother's uterus and being sustained by a yolk sac until birth. Females give birth to an average of six young every spring.|$|E
5|$|Halfbeaks {{are not a}} major {{target for}} {{commercial}} fisheries, though small fisheries for them exist in some places, for example in South Australia where fisheries target the southern sea garfish (Hyporhamphus melanochir). and the eastern sea garfish (Hyporhamphus australis). Halfbeaks are caught {{by a variety of}} methods including seines and pelagic trawls, dip-netting under lights at night, and with haul nets. They are utilized fresh, dried, smoked, or salted, and they are considered good eating. However, even where halfbeaks <b>are</b> <b>targeted</b> by fisheries, they tend to be of secondary importance compared with other edible fish species.|$|E

5|$|Only eight {{species of}} lemur {{are known to}} be seed predators (granivores), but this may be under-reported since most {{observations}} only report fruit consumption and do not investigate whether the seeds are consumed as well. These lemurs include some indriids, such as the diademed sifaka (Propithecus diadema), the golden-crowned sifaka (Propithecus tattersalli), the indri, and the aye-aye. The aye-aye, which specializes in structurally defended resources, can chew through Canarium seeds, which are harder than the seeds that New World monkeys are known to break open. At least 36genera from 23families of plants <b>are</b> <b>targeted</b> by lemur seed predators.|$|E
5|$|Overfishing is {{a serious}} threat to {{seamount}} ecological welfare. There are several well-documented cases of fishery exploitation, for example the orange roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus) off the coasts of Australia and New Zealand and the pelagic armorhead (Pseudopentaceros richardsoni) near Japan and Russia. The {{reason for this is that}} the fishes that <b>are</b> <b>targeted</b> over seamounts are typically long-lived, slow-growing, and slow-maturing. The problem is confounded by the dangers of trawling, which damages seamount surface communities, and the fact that many seamounts are located in international waters, making proper monitoring difficult. Bottom trawling in particular is extremely devastating to seamount ecology, and is responsible for as much as 95% of ecological damage to seamounts.|$|E
5|$|The {{men of the}} Harel brigade made {{leave on}} foot from Bab al-Oued but took a wrong way and mistakenly {{attacked}} Hill 315. Located by the Jordanian sentries, they launch the attack of the hill. The Legionnaires were outnumbered but counterattacked with violence, going as far as requiring an artillery bombing on their own position. The Israelis suffered some heavy losses. When the Yiftach arrived {{at the bottom of}} Hill 346, they <b>are</b> <b>targeted</b> by firearms, grenades and artillery. Thinking that Harel men were there, they called by radio to the headquarters to ceasefire, and laid down arms. They refused, not believing that account of the events and Harel soldiers stayed in place.|$|E

5|$|Flag-of-convenience {{registries}} are criticized, {{mostly by}} trade union organizations based in developed countries, {{especially those of}} Europe. On the other hand, maritime industry practitioners and seafarers from other countries contend {{that this is a}} natural product of globalisation. Seafarers from developed countries must make themselves competitive if they wish to take advantage and practice in a global environment. , thirteen flag states have been found by international shipping organizations to have substandard regulations. A basis for many criticisms is that the flag-of-convenience system allows shipowners to be legally anonymous and difficult to prosecute in civil and criminal actions. Some ships with flags of convenience have been found engaging in crime, offer substandard working conditions, and negatively impact the environment, primarily through illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. , ships of thirteen flags of convenience <b>are</b> <b>targeted</b> for special enforcement by countries that they visit. Supporters of the practice, however, point to economic and regulatory advantages, and increased freedom in choosing employees from an international labor pool.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} {{to the use of}} sound for communication, a wide range of insects have evolved chemical means for communication. These chemicals, termed semiochemicals, are often derived from plant metabolites include those meant to attract, repel and provide other kinds of information. Pheromones, a type of semiochemical, are used for attracting mates of the opposite sex, for aggregating conspecific individuals of both sexes, for deterring other individuals from approaching, to mark a trail, and to trigger aggression in nearby individuals. Allomonea benefit their producer by the effect they have upon the receiver. Kairomones benefit their receiver instead of their producer. Synomones benefit the producer and the receiver. While some chemicals <b>are</b> <b>targeted</b> at individuals of the same species, others are used for communication across species. The use of scents is especially well known to have developed in social insects.|$|E
5|$|Lipid bilayers {{are also}} {{involved}} in signal transduction through their role {{as the home of}} integral membrane proteins. This is an extremely broad and important class of biomolecule. It is estimated that up to a third of the human proteome may be membrane proteins. Some of these proteins are linked to the exterior of the cell membrane. An example of this is the CD59 protein, which identifies cells as “self” and thus inhibits their destruction by the immune system. The HIV virus evades the immune system in part by grafting these proteins from the host membrane onto its own surface. Alternatively, some membrane proteins penetrate {{all the way through the}} bilayer and serve to relay individual signal events from the outside to the inside of the cell. The most common class of this type of protein is the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). GPCRs are responsible for much of the cell’s ability to sense its surroundings and, because of this important role, approximately 40% of all modern drugs <b>are</b> <b>targeted</b> at GPCRs.|$|E

25|$|Currently, the RAS <b>is</b> <b>targeted</b> {{pharmacologically}} by ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists. The aldosterone system <b>is</b> directly <b>targeted</b> by spironolactone, an aldosterone antagonist. The {{fluid retention}} may <b>be</b> <b>targeted</b> by diuretics; the antihypertensive effect of diuretics {{is due to}} its effect on blood volume. Generally, the baroreceptor reflex <b>is</b> not <b>targeted</b> in hypertension because if blocked, individuals may suffer from orthostatic hypotension and fainting.|$|R
5|$|Proteins <b>are</b> <b>targeted</b> for {{degradation}} by the proteasome with covalent {{modification of}} a lysine residue {{that requires the}} coordinated reactions of three enzymes. In the first step, a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (known as E1) hydrolyzes ATP and adenylylates a ubiquitin molecule. This is then transferred to E1's active-site cysteine residue {{in concert with the}} adenylylation of a second ubiquitin. This adenylylated ubiquitin is then transferred to a cysteine of a second enzyme, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2). In the last step, a member of a highly diverse class of enzymes known as ubiquitin ligases (E3) recognizes the specific protein to be ubiquitinated and catalyzes the transfer of ubiquitin from E2 to this target protein. A target protein must be labeled with at least four ubiquitin monomers (in the form of a polyubiquitin chain) before it is recognized by the proteasome lid. It is therefore the E3 that confers substrate specificity to this system. The number of E1, E2, and E3 proteins expressed depends on the organism and cell type, but there are many different E3 enzymes present in humans, indicating that there is a huge number of targets for the ubiquitin proteasome system.|$|E
5|$|Upon her joining, {{however, the}} members of the group <b>are</b> <b>targeted</b> and murdered one by one. All of their deaths relate to their fears: Mark falls down an {{elevator}} shaft, trying to escape from the darkness when the lights go out, and is torn in half. Paul accidentally consumes a cockroach while eating a bag of chips; he is given cleaning solution by a masked figure, and upon drinking it, burns a hole in his throat. Laura begins to suspect these deaths are not accidental. The hospital loses power, leaving Laura, Alison, Darren, Nicky, Dr. Jessica Ryan, and the receptionist Gloria in the dark. Gloria goes to the basement to turn the lights back on, but once the patients return to their rooms, Alison is tied to her bed by the Boogeyman. He places maggots on her arms, which burrow into her skin via her self-inflicted incisions, and she kills herself attempting to cut them out.|$|E
