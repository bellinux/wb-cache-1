5|$|On 27 December 2011, presidential {{spokesman}} Alfredo Scoccimaro {{announced that}} Kirchner {{had been diagnosed}} with thyroid cancer on 22 December and that she would undergo surgery on 4 January 2012. The standard procedure in these operations is to expose the thyroid gland so that a pathologist can take a sample, <b>analyze</b> <b>it</b> looking for carcinogenic cells, and then decide whether it needs to be removed. In Kirchner's case, this step was omitted and the gland was removed directly. After the operation, it was revealed that she had been misdiagnosed and did not have cancer. On 5 October 2013, doctors ordered Kirchner to rest for a month after they found blood on her brain caused by a head injury she received on 8 August 2012. She was re-admitted to hospital and had successful surgery on 8 October 2013 to remove blood from under a membrane covering her brain.|$|E
5|$|Although Beebe and {{his team}} enjoyed {{rewarding}} seasons at Rancho Grande in 1945 and 1946, they did not return there in 1947. The reason they gave in their annual report was that the previous two seasons had produced so much material that they needed an additional year to <b>analyze</b> <b>it,</b> but in reality this was more the result of insufficient funding {{as well as the}} unstable state of Venezuelan politics. Beebe returned to Rancho Grande in 1948, where he completed several technical papers about the migration patterns of birds and insects, as well as a comprehensive study of the area's ecology which he coauthored with Jocelyn Crane. Realizing that the area's politics might soon put an end to their research there, in spring of 1948 Jocelyn made a side trip to Trinidad and Tobago in hope of finding a site for a research station where the politics would be more secure. Finally, when the 1948 Venezuelan coup d'état installed Marcos Pérez Jiménez as Venezuela's dictator, Beebe decided that he could no longer continue to work in Venezuela. Beebe described his experiences at Rancho Grande in his 1949 book High Jungle, which was the last of Beebe's major books.|$|E

25|$|Biblical scholar George W. Young {{dismisses the}} naturalistic explanations, the {{traditional}} and the historical critical perspectives. He contends that these methods of exegesis rely on factual interpretations and fail to capture the full {{meaning of the text}} based on its structure. Instead, Young explores the pericope with literary-critical methods as narrative art. Young views the text as fiction, and uses tools and terms often associated with fantastic literature to <b>analyze</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{explicit}} psychological {{dimension of}} this tale has prompted many critics to <b>analyze</b> <b>it</b> as {{a description of}} the human psyche, comparing, for instance, the House to the unconscious, and its central crack to a split personality. Mental disorder is also evoked through the themes of melancholy, possible incest, and vampirism. An incestuous relationship between Roderick and Madeline is never explicitly stated, but seems implied by the strange attachment between the two.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, after DNA testing {{had become more}} prominent, the LAPD formed a new unit, which looked through the {{forensic}} evidence collected from the department's cold case files to determine whether any had the potential for new leads through DNA testing. Among the evidence seen as likely to do so was that collected from the Rasmussens' residence. However, {{it was not until}} 2004 that another criminalist, Jennifer Butterworth, was able to <b>analyze</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

25|$|One belief {{was that}} American Indians were too unsophisticated to have {{constructed}} such complex earthworks and artifacts. The associated stone, metal, and clay artifacts {{were thought to}} be too complex for the Indians to have made. In the American Southeast, and Midwest, numerous Indian cultures were sedentary and used agriculture. Numerous Indian towns had built surrounding stockades for defense. Capable of this type of construction, they and ancestors could have built mounds, but people who believed that the Indians did not build the earthworks did not <b>analyze</b> <b>it</b> in this manner. They thought the Native American nomadic cultures would not organize to build such monuments, for failure to devote the time and effort to construct such time-consuming projects.|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} {{focuses on the}} yearning desire {{to be with a}} loved one for Christmas, {{regardless}} of whether they have to forgo the usual commercial aspect of the holiday season such as ornamental lights, trees, snow and presents. The song incorporates various instruments, including piano, drums, violin, oboe, flute, bell chimes, bass effect, and cowbells. The song layers background vocals throughout the chorus and sections of the bridge. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, [...] "All I Want for Christmas Is You" [...] is set in common time and in the key of G major. Carey's vocal range in the song spans from the note of G3 to the high note of G5. Carey wrote the song's lyrics and melody, while Afanasieff arranged and produced the piece with synthetically created computerized equipment. Slates Ragusea counts [...] "at least 13 distinct chords at work, resulting in a sumptuously chromatic melody. The song also includes what I consider the most Christmassy chord of all—a minor subdominant, or 'iv,' chord with an added 6, under the words 'underneath the Christmas tree,' among other places. (You might also <b>analyze</b> <b>it</b> as a half-diminished 'ii' 7th chord, but either interpretation seems accurate)." [...] According to Roch Parisien from AllMusic, the song contains [...] "The Beach Boys-style harmonies, jangling bells, and a sleigh-ride pace, injecting one of the few bits of exuberant fun in this otherwise vanilla set." [...] In a piece on the song in Vogue, a writer felt the song's lyrics helped solidify its status over two decades later: [...] "those lyrics could have been sung by Frank Sinatra—well, maybe not Frank, but another singer back then. I think that's what gives it that timeless, classic quality." ...|$|E
