5|$|The episode makes {{references}} to Family Guy itself. When Bonnie, Lois and Cleveland's new girlfriend come to dance at The Drunken Clam, they state {{that they would}} like to make the bar their place to hang out, after Peter grabs Joe's gun and kills himself. It turns out that this was only Peter's imagination as he snaps out of it when Joe starts talking to him; Peter answers that he was having a Scrubs fantasy moment. Quagmire responds to Peter's moment by stating that Scrubs is the best show people are not watching. Cleveland replies that he hates shows that leave the story for a gag or joke, referring to the numerous cutaways Scrubs and Family Guy contain. While in the hospital Peter realizes that Mr. Pewterschmidt and Dr. Hartman have a similar voice, then Mr. Pewterschmidt comes into the room and they both start talking <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>their</b> voices sound alike; this is a reference to the show's creator Seth MacFarlane as he voices both characters.|$|E

25|$|The book is {{a similar}} {{publication}} to his first, where he purports to explain why drug and food companies hide the truth <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>their</b> products can cause disease. In More Natural Cures Revealed, Trudeau writes that workers at the FDA and FTC want to censor him and, figuratively, burn his books. Though the book received negative comments from some reviewers, it received average ratings on both Amazon and GoodReads.com.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Satan returns triumphantly to Hell, {{amidst the}} praise {{of his fellow}} fallen angels. He tells them <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>their</b> scheme worked and Mankind has fallen, giving them {{complete}} dominion over Paradise. As he finishes his speech, however, the fallen angels around him become hideous snakes, and soon enough, Satan himself turned into a snake, deprived of limbs and unable to talk. Thus, they share the same punishment, as they shared the same guilt.|$|E

25|$|In {{the spring}} of 2010, the University of California, San Diego became the second Fair Trade University in the United States. The University of California at San Diego {{understood}} {{the efforts of the}} Fairtrade Foundation in the UK, but they recognized they wanted to be more detailed <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>their</b> declaration as a Fair Trade University would make an actual change in the way on-campus franchises do business with the university. They also required constant assessment and improvement. The main premise of being a Fair Trade University for the University of California at San Diego is the promise between the university and the students about the continual effort by the university to increase the accessibility of Fair Trade Certified food and drinks and to encourage sustainability in other ways, such as buying from local, organic farmers and decreasing waste.|$|E
25|$|Many of the {{personnel}} {{were given a}} day's leave to attend Anzac Day services and events on Friday 25 April. Personnel from the cruiser were concerned <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>their</b> colleagues had been treated, and during the afternoon, about 100 sailors assembled in Quay Street, Auckland, and decided to not return to duty. Like the mutineers {{at the start of}} the month, the Bellona sailors had three main demands, this time that naval pay rates be increased to match those of the Army and Air Force, that committees be established to discuss problems and improve the welfare of sailors, and that the discharged sailors not be barred from the public service. Another 40 sailors mustering at Philomel before boarding Bellona were recruited into the mutiny: these men attempted to recruit more from Bellona, but the actions of the cruiser's officers prevented any additional sailors from joining them. The party then marched off the base, despite orders to halt from the Master-at-Arms stationed at the gatehouse, then dispersed.|$|E
25|$|The Aztecs {{were one}} of the last of the Nahuatl-speaking peoples who {{migrated}} to this part of the Valley of Mexico {{after the fall of the}} Toltec Empire. Their presence was resisted by the peoples who were already there, but the Aztecs were able to establish a city on a small island on the western side of Lake Texcoco. The Aztecs themselves had a story <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>their</b> city was founded after being led to the island by their principal god, Huitzilopochtli. According to the story, the god indicated their new home with a sign, an eagle perched on a nopal cactus with a snake in its beak. This image appears in Codex Mendoza, an early post-conquest manuscript, one of many Aztec codices, pictorial texts, and since Mexico's independence from Spain in 1821, the image is in the center of the Mexican flag. Between 1325 and 1521, Tenochtitlan grew in size and strength, eventually dominating the other city-states or altepetl around Lake Texcoco, and in the Valley of Mexico. When the Spaniards arrived, the Aztec Empire reached much of Mesoamerica, touching both the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific Ocean.|$|E

This was the last episode written by Morgan and Wong before they left to create [...] They decided to add several in-jokes with The X-Files creative team. The episode has several scenes involving animals, each filmed with living creatures. In one such scene frogs rain from the sky. Actor Dan Butler has been quoted as being terrified of an anaconda used during one scene.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after the}} episode {{featuring}} the kiss was aired, the characters {{were attacked by}} talkback callers and conservative groups who thought {{that they had been}} [...] "glamorising a high-risk culture" [...] and [...] "making homosexuality look cool". Chief executive of the Christian group Salt Shakers, Peter Stokes, told The Age's Kenneth Nguyen, [...] "It just saddens me that we give our young people the message that these relationships are OK." [...] However, Ray Misson, the head of Melbourne University's arts education department, described the serial's depiction of a lesbian as [...] "a real advance." [...] Neval believed that gay teenagers, who were already feeling insecure <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>their</b> sexuality would be accepted, would be devastated by the negative reaction surrounding the storyline.|$|E

She further sings about love-making with a male lover and the second line includes the lyrics: [...] "Let me take this off while you watch me / that's my'ass appeal". It features explicit and metaphorical lyrics throughout and sees Beyoncé instructing her love interest to watch her perform a striptease. She further talks <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>their</b> evening together is going to proceed with lyrics such as [...] "If you like you can touch it babe, do you wanna touch it baby?".|$|E

500|$|Hall had {{abandoned}} his rural Yorke Peninsula-based seat of Goyder {{to stand for}} the Senate, and at the 1974 Goyder state by-election the LM were concerned <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>their</b> vote would stand without the assistance of its prominent incumbent and in an area outside their urban base; the LCL had always won the seat easily. The campaign was robust, with strong accusations being traded as what was previously a safe seat became evenly poised {{and the subject of}} frantic electioneering. [...] Surprisingly, as the LM was an urban movement, they polled 46 per cent of the vote, which saw David Boundy elected on the back of Country Party preferences with a two-party preferred vote beyond 60%. Despite most of its preferences flowing to the LM, the Country Party attacked the LM for perceived hypocrisy as they had run in a rural seat despite calling for the anti-Labor forces to be separated into urban and rural divisions. This continued {{to be a source of}} tension, as the LM continued to campaign in rural seats, prompting the Country Party to threaten to deny them preferences. The LM triumph embarrassed the LCL, and Eastick survived a leadership challenge from Heini Becker in the aftermath. Over the next year, the LM focused on building the party machinery.|$|E
500|$|Constantine began co-hosting What Not to Wear with Trinny Woodall in 2001, which {{required}} using her fashion advice and expertise {{in order to}} reform participants' appearances and fashion style. Constantine and Woodall hosted What Not to Wear until 2005 and became renowned for their tactile behaviour with the participants, direct advice, and frequently referring to breasts as tits which {{has become something of}} a trademark. Never one to hold back, a notorious moment arose when Constantine spontaneously pulled a female candidate's underwear down during filming as her knicker line was visible. Critics of What Not to Wear argued that the duo were too patronising to their subjects, a claim which they strongly disagree with. Constantine insists that their subjects [...] "see we have a genuine love of women. We love women and they can see that. Women just know." [...] She also stated [...] "Ultimately, what we're doing is giving people confidence. We're probably the only people who have an opinion, who care how ordinary people dress. No one at Vogue magazine gives a shit. They work with the designers, it's more creative and artistic – they are creating something beautiful. But they don't care <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>their</b> readers end up looking – whereas we do!" [...] The show made Constantine and Woodall household names and they are now known together as Trinny and Susannah. One reporter has simply referred to Constantine as [...] "the one with 'big tits'." [...] Constantine and Woodall have even considered taking insurance out on their partnership should something unforeseen happen, although Constantine was against the move.|$|E

30|$|However, a few EGM {{players with}} higher levels of {{education}} (e.g., University students) presented more elaborate views <b>about</b> <b>how</b> to “enhance” <b>their</b> chance of winning.

While education is a protective factor in gambling, young people interested in games and systems tend to express higher levels of illusion of control (Moore & Ohtsuka, 1999).
