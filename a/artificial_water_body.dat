40|$|With {{tropical}} floodplain wetlands ranking {{among the}} world's most threatened ecosystems, <b>artificial</b> <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> are an often under-appreciated potential conservation resource for aquatic fauna in these heavily modified environments. This paper describes the fish communities in 27 <b>artificial</b> <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> having three different management and design types (ditch recycle pits, generic recycle pits and constructed wetlands) on a heavily modified floodplain in northern Australia. In these <b>artificial</b> <b>water</b> <b>bodies,</b> constructed wetlands housed significantly higher mean native fish diversity, followed by generic recycle pits and then ditches, where communities were numerically dominated by invasive, non-native fishes. Environmental parameters such as <b>water</b> <b>body</b> depth and riparian zone condition were the descriptors that best explained fish community composition across <b>water</b> <b>bodies.</b> Comparison with collated fish survey data representing broader floodplain γ-diversity showed that > 70 % of regional fish diversity was housed in <b>artificial</b> <b>water</b> <b>bodies,</b> with constructed wetlands alone accounting for 68 % of freshwater species {{known from the}} floodplain. In addition, site (α) diversity of native species in constructed wetlands {{did not differ from}} site diversity in remnant, relatively intact natural <b>water</b> <b>bodies,</b> and was significantly greater than species diversity in heavily degraded, natural floodplain habitats. Study results provide strong evidence that <b>artificial</b> <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> can make useful contributions to biodiversity conservation by providing artificial habitat in a floodplain environment dominated by agriculture...|$|R

This plain is a large active braided section located 3 km upstream of the restored site. For understanding the recovery of the restored site, it is important to evaluate the sediment connectivity between the upstream braided plain and the restored reach. One hundred artificial pebbles have been equipped with active RFID tracers and deployed in the downstream part of the Chabottes plain in order to characterize distances of transport of bedload particles. Moreover, 100 active RFID transponders have been inserted in erosion columns in order to evaluate scour-and-fill depths along the intermediate section. This equipment is completed by sequential high-resolution DTMs (from airborne LiDAR data and from SfM photogrammetry) and by time lapse cameras in order to quantify and characterize channel adjustments...|$|E

Silnica River is a small river cutting through the city of Kielce from the North to the South-West. It has its source in Masłowskie Range at a height of 360 m a. s. l. and it flows into Bobrza River. It is ranked among mountain rivers at a 6. 4 ‰ gradient. Its river-bed bas belonged to Kielecki Protected Landscape Area since 2006. Next to Szydłowek estate the <b>artificial</b> <b>water</b> <b>body</b> was build - Kielecki Bay. Beneath Kielecki Bay, Silnica River flows in regu 1 ated river-bed. Because of no separated storm water drainage, the rainwater washes away pollutants among others from industrial plants, houses, pavements, and streets into Silnica River. The wastewater treatment plant {{is located at the}} mouth of the Silnica River. It receives rainwater and snowmelt from the central - eastern part of the city with an area of 62 ha. The primary channel has a length of 1569 m and its diameter varies from 600 mm to 1250 mm. Is attached to the side of seventeen channels (with diameters from 300 mm to 1000 mm). The collector wells are 32 inspection and connection, and 24 entries. The side channels are located 119 wells and 82 outlets. The total length of the sewerage system is equal to 5583 m. The decrease of the collector changes to individual sections from 0. 04 % to 3. 9 %, and decreases in side channels to reach 2. 61 %. On average, one groove receives water from the surface of 0. 585 ha. Ordinate the highest point in the catchment area is 271. 20 m, 260. 0 m above sea level the lowest, the average decrease in surface area is equal to 0. 71 %. Within the basin was isolated six types of surface runoff: roofs (14. 3 %), walks (8. 4 %), roads (17. 7 %), parking (11. 2 %), green (47. 2 %) and pitch school (1. 3 %). Generally, paved areas with a high coefficient of runoff represent 52. 83 % of the total catchment area, which shows the typical urban character. The run-off wastewater is collected from the roofs by gutters incorporated directly into storm channels (72. 5 % of all roofs), with roads and streets on a typical street drains with cast iron grate. A qualitative and quantitative study of runoff wastewater was conducted between February 2011 and October 2011.

40|$|Water-body {{size and}} {{location}} influence zooplankton diversity in freshwaters, but less {{is known about}} systematic variations in zooplankton community composition between natural and <b>artificial</b> <b>waters</b> on different continents. We used meta-analysis to assess how zooplankton in <b>artificial</b> <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> across different biomes might differ from natural <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> of similar size. Among 79 lakes, ponds and reservoirs (11 artificial and 68 natural), proximity to other <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> apparently increased species richness in all lake types, probably reflecting dispersal. However, richness did not differ systematically between natural and <b>artificial</b> <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> of comparable size. In contrast, community composition differed between <b>artificial</b> and natural <b>waters</b> after accounting for depth, productivity, longitude and conductivity, with models explaining up to 50 % of the overall variance at genus level. Leptodiaptomus, Chydorus, Cyclops, Acanthocyclops, Skistodiaptomus, Epischura, Limnocalanus, Senecella, Heterocope, Arctodiaptomus and Aglaodiaptomus all occurred more frequently in natural waters, whilst Thermocyclops, Moina and Epischura occurred more frequently in artificial lakes.

40|$|This is a {{study of}} 45 natural and <b>artificial</b> <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> {{extending}} across the whole of eastern Australia from the tropics to Tasmania. A broad variety of physio-chemical, land-use and climatic parameters were measured. Reservoirs and other <b>artificial</b> <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> respond to stressors in their catchments {{in a similar fashion}} to natural lakes but tend to be less nutrient rich possibly due to shorter residence times and active management. pH and salinity are strongly correlated in the dataset. Bedrock has a strong influence on pH in freshwater lakes but all highly saline lakes are alkaline, irrespective of bedrock. High concentrations of anions in saline lakes preclude the existence of acid conditions by binding available hydrogen ions. Almost all lakes fall on salinity axes that indicate marine origin for their salts. An assessment of the TN:TP molar ratios from the lakes in this dataset indicates that productivity in Australian lakes could be limited by both nitrogen and phosphorus. Future research using macro-nutrient enrichment experiments should be pursued to confirm this preliminary observation. There is a strong positive correlation between regional aridity and lake eutrophication. This is typical of semi-arid and seasonally arid environments and reflects the concentration of nutrients due to evaporative flux in shallow basins with high residence times...|$|R

40|$|Although human-related {{disturbance}} {{is usually}} detrimental for biodiversity, {{in some instances}} it can simulate natural processes and benefit certain species. Changes in the disturbance regime, both natural and human-driven, can affect species that rely on it. The Apennine yellow-bellied toad Bombina variegata pachypus, an amphibian endemic to peninsular Italy, has declined throughout its range in the last 3 decades. We sought to identify the drivers {{of the decline in}} the region of Liguria, at the north-western limit of its distribution. In 2009 and 2010 we surveyed sites where the species occurred until 2005 and related the persistence of breeding activity to the characteristics of sites. Populations had disappeared from 50 % of the sites between 2005 and 2009. Current breeding sites have less aquatic and bank vegetation, fewer predators and better insolation. Frequent disturbance events (desiccation and floods) were related to reduced vegetation, which in turn may decrease predator densities and increase insolation. In this region disturbance is provided by natural factors or, in the case of <b>artificial</b> <b>water</b> <b>bodies,</b> by regular maintenance carried out by landowners. The widespread land abandonment in Liguria can disrupt disturbance regimes, interrupting the removal of vegetation, and thus rapidly reduce the suitability of artificial sites. This was confirmed in our study, with most abandoned breeding sites occurring in formerly cultivated areas. Possible short-term conservation actions include creating new ponds, maintaining <b>artificial</b> <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> and clearing vegetation. However, long-term conservation may be more problematic as the land abandonment process is unlikely to be reversed...|$|R
