5|$|Endometrial {{cancer is}} a cancer that arises from the {{endometrium}} (the lining of the uterus or womb). It {{is the result of}} the abnormal growth of cells that have the ability to invade or spread to other parts of the body. The first sign is most often vaginal bleeding not associated with a menstrual period. Other symptoms include pain with urination, pain during sexual intercourse, or pelvic pain. Endometrial cancer occurs most commonly <b>after</b> <b>menopause.</b>|$|E
5|$|Women {{are more}} prone to UTIs than men because, in females, the urethra is much shorter and closer to the anus.

5|$|Endometrial cancer appears most {{frequently}} during perimenopause (the period just before, just after, and during menopause), {{between the ages}} of 50 and 65; overall, 75% of endometrial cancer occurs <b>after</b> <b>menopause.</b> Women younger than 40 make up 5% of endometrial cancer cases and 10–15% of cases occur in women under 50years of age. This age group is at risk for developing ovarian cancer at the same time. The worldwide median age of diagnosis is 63years of age; in the United States, the average age of diagnosis is 60years of age. White American women are at higher risk for endometrial cancer than black American women, with a 2.88% and 1.69% lifetime risk respectively.

40|$|Background: Excess adiposity, {{diabetes}} mellitus, and ischaemic {{heart disease}} are common important causes of morbidity and premature mortality in postmenopausal {{women in the}} UK. A large amount of data exists on known risk factors for these conditions, and for risk factors men and women share {{there is little evidence}} to suggest sex-based differences. It has been suggested that factors unique to women (such as parity and breastfeeding) may also influence risk. The nature of the relationship between childbearing and these conditions remains to be clarified. In this thesis I explore the association between women’s childbearing histories and their adiposity, and risk of diabetes or ischaemic heart disease <b>after</b> the <b>menopause,</b> to provide evidence on the character, repeatability and public health relevance of the associations. Aim: To explore the hypothesis that childbearing (specifically parity and breastfeeding) is associated with women’s body weight and risk of excess adiposity, and also with women’s risk of diabetes mellitus, and ischaemic heart disease <b>after</b> the <b>menopause.</b> Methods: Data are analysed from a large population-based cohort of middle-aged UK women recruited in 1996 to 2001 (the Million Women Study) with complete childbearing information, and who had baseline anthropometry, and were followed for incident diabetes or ischaemic heart disease through repeat survey questionnaires, hospital admission records, and central registry databases. Results: In a large ethnically homogeneous population of postmenopausal UK women increasing parity was associated with an increase in BMI, however this increase was offset in women who breastfed. The associations between parity, breastfeeding and BMI were of a similar order of magnitude to established risk factors known to be associated with BMI, for example smoking, and physical activity. The associations between childbearing and women’s risk of diabetes mellitus <b>after</b> the <b>menopause</b> appear to be largely due to the effects of childbearing on maternal BMI. There is only limited evidence to suggest a direct effect of childbearing on women’s risk of diabetes <b>after</b> the <b>menopause.</b> There is statistically significant evidence of an association between childbearing and women’s risk of ischaemic heart disease <b>after</b> the <b>menopause.</b> Parity was associated with a modest increase in risk whereas breastfeeding was associated with a small decrease in risk, however the effects were small in comparison to known important risk factors. Conclusions In a large population of UK women childbearing was found to have a persistent influence on women’s mean BMI <b>after</b> the <b>menopause,</b> and through this postmenopausal risk of diabetes mellitus. Childbearing was also found to be mod-estly associated with women’s risk of ischaemic heart disease <b>after</b> the <b>menopause.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Background/Aim. The {{most common}} {{secondary}} manifestations of menopause are clinical manifestations of estrogen deficiency. They could be early and late. The {{aim of this}} study was to compare manifestations of somatic disturbances in early postmenopause in women after physiological and surgical menopause. Methods. This prospective study included 60 women, age 41 - 55 years, divided into two groups: physiological (30 of them) and surgically induced menopause. For every subject a special evidence list, consisting of the disease history questions, physical and gynecology examination as well as dates about physiological variables (arterial tension, height, weight, and body-mass index) and laboratory examination was formed. The values of arterial blood pressure, body height, body mass, body mass index (BMI), and lipid status were determined and gynecological examinations were performed in each patient. Results. The most frequent symptoms in both groups were vasomotor ones. Headache was the more intensive sign in the group <b>after</b> induced <b>menopause.</b> Extra systolic heart excursion was a common symptom in both study groups. Arterial tension, regardless of the type of menopause, was in the physiological range. The frequent organic signs of menopause, more intensive in the group <b>after</b> induced <b>menopause,</b> were genitourinary and skin atrophy. An analysis of the BMI showed that the women in both groups were obese (BMI > 25). The lipids analysis confirmed the predomination of hyperlipoproteinemia type IIa in the group with physiologic menopause and type IIb <b>after</b> induced <b>menopause.</b> Conclusion. The dominant signs of menopausal syndrome were vasomotor and bone-joint symptoms, more frequent in the group <b>after</b> induced <b>menopause.</b> There were no statistically significant differences between the study groups according to the genitourinary atrophy and other signs of aging. Menopausal hormonal changes, regardless of the way of menopause developing, increase the risk for hyperlipoproteinemia. The frequency of somatic signs in early post menopause is typically higher <b>after</b> induced <b>menopause.</b> More intensive follow-up in patients after surgical removing of the ovaria is necessary in order to improve the quality of life in these patients...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAbstractBackgroundOverweight {{and weight}} gain {{throughout}} adult life {{have been associated}} with increased risk of breast cancer <b>after</b> the <b>menopause.</b> However the role of body weight at a young age and of the timing of weight gain over the lifetime in postmenopausal breast cancer is not well documented. MethodsWe conducted a population-based case-control study on breast cancer in France that included 739 cases and 815 population controls in postmenopausal women. Height, weight at age 20, 40 and 50 as well as weight one year before diagnosis were obtained during in-person interviews. ResultsNo association between body mass index at the age of 20  years and breast cancer <b>after</b> the <b>menopause</b> was detected. However, we found that postmenopausal breast cancer was associated with weight gain between ages 40 and 50  years (OR per 5  kg/m 2 increase in BMI: 1. 45 [95 %ci 1. 06 − 1. 98]). The increased risk of breast cancer associated with weight gain was more consistent in leaner women at age 20, in older postmenopausal women (> 65  years), and in women who did not use menopausal hormone therapy. ConclusionsThese findings point to the importance of controlling for weight gain in middle aged-women. The role of low body weight in young adulthood in breast cancer risk <b>after</b> the <b>menopause</b> should be further scrutinized...|$|R

25|$|Menopause {{occurs because}} of the sharp {{decrease}} of estradiol and progesterone production by the ovaries. <b>After</b> <b>menopause,</b> estrogen continues to be produced mostly by aromatase in fat tissues and is produced in small amounts in many other tissues such as ovaries, bone, blood vessels, and the brain where it acts locally.

The women were studied in six groups, according {{to the number of}} years since their <b>menopause.</b> One year <b>after</b> the <b>menopause</b> androstenedione, oestrone, and oestradiol concentrations were reduced to about 20 % of the values recorded during the early proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle.

Concentrations of both gonadotrophins reached a peak of 18 - 4 and 3 - 4 times the proliferative phase value respectively after two to three years, and then gradually declined in the next three decades to values that were 40 - 50 % of these maximal levels.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{endocrine}} control of sebaceous follicles is complex in women. During aging, {{a decline in}} sebum output is often experienced. However, some women report increased seborrhea <b>after</b> the <b>menopause.</b> OBJECTIVE: In this study, the follicular reservoir function was studied during the first decade following the menopause. METHODS: Four evaluations were made at 3 -week intervals in two parallel age-matched groups of 50 postmenopausal women receiving hormone replacement therapy (HRT) or not. The Sebumeter served to measure the casual sebum level and the sebum excretion rate on the forehead. In addition, a Visioscan equipped with an ultraviolet-recording camera was used with and without lipid-sensitive tapes interposed between the camera and the skin surface. Follicular openings and sebum pore patterns were studied by image analysis. RESULTS: There was enormous diversity among individual values of sebum output at the skin surface. In untreated women, a significant decline in sebum excretion rate accompanied {{by an increase in}} both the sebum replacement time and the mean pore size were evidenced during the first decade <b>after</b> the <b>menopause.</b> The sebum excretion rate and casual level showed a wide range of interindividual differences early <b>after</b> the <b>menopause.</b> These physiological changes were less prominent in women receiving HRT. CONCLUSION: Postmenopausal aging affects the sebum production, but HRT does not significantly control the complex process of seborrhea. However, HRT mitigates the progressive enlargement of the openings of the sebum follicular reservoir. Peer reviewe...|$|R
