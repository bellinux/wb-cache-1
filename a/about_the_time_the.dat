5|$|According to {{his book}} Doctor Who: The Companions (published at <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>The</b> Trial of a Time Lord was broadcast), series {{producer}} John Nathan-Turner intended to chronicle the Doctor's {{first meeting with}} Melanie Bush in a later episode. The subsequent dismissal of Colin Baker from {{the role of the}} Doctor rendered this potential storyline moot, although the later novel Business Unusual by Gary Russell, that was published in September 1997, would attempt to fill in this gap in the show's continuity.|$|E
5|$|Billy Clanton {{was shot}} in the wrist, chest and abdomen, and after a minute or two slumped to a sitting {{position}} near his original position {{at the corner of the}} MacDonald house in the lot between the house and Fly's Lodging House. Claiborne said Clanton was supported by a window initially after he was shot, and fired some shots after sitting, with the pistol supported on his leg. After he ran out of ammunition, he called for more cartridges, but C. S. Fly took his pistol at <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> general shooting ended.|$|E
5|$|Sibelius admired Rydberg {{and often}} set his poetry to music, {{including}} the melodrama Snöfrid, Op. 29, and the War Song of Tyrtaeus. The poem Skogsrået {{was first published}} in 1882, and in 1883 Sibelius's future friend, the artist Akseli Gallen-Kallela, illustrated it. In 1888 or 1889, <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> two met, Sibelius first set Skogsrået for voice and piano. This setting is musically unrelated to Sibelius's 1894-95 treatment.|$|E

25|$|Southampton was {{a growing}} {{town in the}} nineteenth century. With {{the coming of the}} railway in 1839 and the {{development}} of the docks, Southampton grew from a population of 27,000 in 1841 to 42,000 in 1861. The first horse-drawn omnibus service in the town started <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> railway arrived, and by 1843 one Thomas Matcham was running a regular service from the station to Millbrook, Eling, Bitterne, Shirley, Portswood, Totton and Romsey.|$|E

25|$|Schurz, Carl. The Reminiscences of Carl Schurz (three volumes), New York: McClure Publ. Co., 1907–08. Schurz {{covered the}} years 1829–1870 in his Reminiscences. He {{died in the}} midst of writing them. The third volume is rounded out with A Sketch of Carl Schurz's Political Career 1869–1906 by Frederic Bancroft and William A. Dunning.

25|$|During the 1992 postseason, CBS missed {{covering}} one of {{the three}} debates among U.S. presidential candidates George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton and H. Ross Perot. The network had planned to join other broadcast and cable networks in the telecast; however, Game 4 of the ALCS between the Toronto Blue Jays and Oakland Athletics did not end until 8:30p.m. Eastern Time, <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> debate ended. The Blue Jays won the game 7-6 in 11 innings. The other networks reported very good ratings for the debate, part of {{one of the}} more compelling election campaigns in recent times.|$|E
25|$|Tabari {{was some}} {{fifty years old}} when al-Mu'tadid became caliph. He was well past seventy in the year his History was published. During the {{intervening}} years, he was famous, if somewhat controversial, personality. Among the figures of his age, he had access to sources of information equal to anyone, except, perhaps, those who were directly connected with decision making within the government. Most, if not all, the materials for the histories of al-Mu'tadid, al-Muktafi, and {{the early years of}} al-Muqtadir were collected by him <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> reported events took place.

25|$|Farnsworth {{reached the}} area at {{approximately}} 1:00 p.m., <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> massive Confederate artillery barrage started {{in preparation for}} Pickett's Charge, and his 1,925 troops took up a position in a line south of the George Bushman farm. From left to right, the regiments were the 18th Pennsylvania Cavalry, the 1st West Virginia and 1st Vermont. Battery E, 4th U.S. Artillery, occupied a small, rocky knoll in the rear and the 5th New York cavalry {{was placed in a}} nearby ravine to guard the artillery. Joined by Kilpatrick, they awaited Merritt's brigade, which arrived at about 3:00 p.m. and took up a position straddling the Emmitsburg Road, to Farnsworth's left. By this time the infantry portion of Pickett's Charge had begun, and Kilpatrick was eager to get his men into the fight.|$|E
25|$|In late July 1947 the Dutch {{launched}} Operatie Product, which {{aimed to}} capture important economic {{facilities in the}} NEI. This campaign was {{also referred to as}} the First Police Action. At this time No. 120 Squadron was still located at Semarang and was equipped with nine Kittyhawks instead of the 19 it was authorised. Early in this operation the squadron attacked Solo and Madiun and claimed to have destroyed eight Indonesian aircraft on the ground. A strike on Jakarta was delayed by fog; this may have saved the life of Indonesian Prime Minister Sutan Sjahrir as he left the city on board a C-47 Dakota transport at <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> Kittyhawks were originally scheduled to arrive. During the First Police Action No. 120 Squadron, like the other units of the NEIAF, provided support to Army units. The First Police Action ended on 4 August, though NEIAF aircraft continued to attack Indonesian positions.|$|E
500|$|Matthew's {{description}} of the miracles and portents attending the birth of Jesus {{can be compared to}} stories concerning the birth of Augustus (63 BC). Linking a birth to the first appearance of a star was consistent with a popular belief that each person's life was linked to a particular star. Magi and astronomical events were linked in the public mind by the visit to Rome of a delegation of magi at the time of a spectacular appearance of Halley's Comet in AD 66, <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> Gospel of Matthew was being composed. This delegation was led by King Tiridates of Armenia, who came seeking confirmation of his title from Emperor Nero. Ancient historian Dio Cassius wrote that, [...] "The King did not return by the route he had followed in coming," [...] a line similar to the text of Matthew's account, but written some time after the completion of Matthew's gospel.|$|E

500|$|At {{some point}} Constable West spoke to Bamber {{again on the}} telephone; Bamber {{apparently}} complained <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> police were taking, saying: [...] "When my father rang he sounded terrified." [...] He was told {{to go to the}} farm and wait for the police. Explaining why he had called a local police station and not 999, Bamber told police on the night that he had not thought it would make a difference to how soon they would arrive. He said he had spent time looking up the number, and even though his father had asked him to come quickly, he had first telephoned his girlfriend, Julie Mugford, in London, then had driven slowly to the farmhouse. He acknowledged that he could have called one of the farm workers, but had not considered it. In his early witness statements, Bamber said he had telephoned the police immediately after receiving his father's call, then telephoned Mugford. During later police interviews, he said he had called Mugford first. He said he was confused about the sequence of events.|$|E
500|$|By 2:30pm the {{shooting}} {{from the house}} had ceased. One of the detectives present walked close {{to the wall and}} pushed the door open, before retreating. Other police officers, and some of the soldiers, came out and waited for the men to exit. None did, and as part of the roof collapsed, it was clear to onlookers that the men were both dead; the fire brigade was allowed to start extinguishing the fire. At 2:40 Churchill left the scene, at <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> Royal Horse Artillery arrived with two 13-pounder field artillery pieces. When the firemen entered the property to douse the flames, they soon located Sokoloff's body, which was extracted. A wall collapsed on a group of five [...] firemen, who were all taken to the London Hospital. One of the men, Superintendent Charles Pearson, had a fractured spine; he died six months after the siege {{as a result of his}} injuries. After shoring up the building, the firemen resumed their search of the premises. At around 6:30pm the second body—that of Svaars—was found; it was taken to the mortuary.|$|E
500|$|The fruit bodies push upward {{through the}} soil {{when they are}} about [...] tall. As growth progresses, the stem elongates and the {{peridium}} becomes more rounded, increasing in size until maturity. At <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> peridium reaches [...] or slightly more in diameter, the columella exerts an upward tension on the tissue of the partial veil, and it begins {{to pull away from}} the stem. Typically, the veil tissue is weakest near the attachment to the stem, rather than to the attachment {{at the edge of the}} peridium, and the veil separates from the stem. The lower edge of the peridium is further stretched as it is pulled upward and outward. Usually, the arid environment causes the gleba to dry out rapidly. If the veil tissue at the base of the stem is [...] stronger than that attached to the edge of the peridium, the veil can rip so it remains attached to the stem as a ring. Scales begin to appear on the surface of the peridium of some specimens at about this time.|$|E

500|$|Just as the {{aircraft}} hit takeoff speed, the No.1 Engine and its pylon assembly {{separated from the}} left wing, ripping away a [...] section of the leading edge with it. The combined unit flipped {{over the top of}} the wing and landed on the runway. Robert Graham, supervisor of maintenance for American Airlines, stated: [...] "As {{the aircraft}} got closer, I noticed what appeared to be vapor or smoke of some type coming from the leading edge of the wing and the No. 1 engine pylon. I noticed that the No. 1 engine was bouncing up and down quite a bit and just <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> aircraft got opposite my position and started rotation, the engine came off, went up {{over the top of the}} wing, and rolled back down onto the runway... Before going over the wing, the engine went forward and up just as if it had lift and was actually climbing. It didn't strike the top of the wing on its way, rather it followed the clear path of the airflow of the wing, up and over the top of it, then down below the tail. The aircraft continued a fairly normal climb until it started a turn to the left. And at that point, I thought he was going to come back to the airport." ...|$|E
