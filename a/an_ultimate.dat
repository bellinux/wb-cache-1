5|$|A.J. Styles {{went on to}} Destination X {{to defend}} the TNA X Division Championship in <b>an</b> <b>Ultimate</b> X Challenge match. <b>An</b> <b>Ultimate</b> X Challenge match has three stages. Stage one {{involves}} the four men being paired up into two tag teams and having a standard tag team match, with {{the person who is}} pinned being eliminated from the bout. Then it becomes a standard match involving three people, with the one being pinned in that phase being eliminated from the match. The final two then fight to climb the ropes and retrieve the championship that hangs in the middle. The participants were announced for the match on the March 11 episode of Impact!, with Elix Skipper and Ron Killings being added to face Styles.

40|$|In {{its most}} part, {{this article is}} a {{critique}} {{of three of the}} most common ways of defining egalitarianism: 1) egalitarianism is a trend of thought in political philosophy to which belong (all) philosophers who support a form of equality, whatever it may be, between all members of a community; 2) egalitarianism is a trend of thought in political philosophy which has as <b>a</b> <b>ultimate</b> or foundational value equality in the abstract sense of treating all people as equals; and 3) egalitarianism is a trend of thought in political philosophy that defends equality in the distribution of certain goods or resources. In {{the last part of the}} article I defend the idea that egalitarianism is much better described as a trend of thought in political philosophy that defends a substantial equality between all members of a community as <b>a</b> <b>ultimate</b> principle of social justice...|$|R

5|$|The Conservative Party had {{previously}} experienced serious division during the 1850s, when the Emperor's complete {{support for the}} Conciliation policy {{gave rise to the}} Progressives. The difference then was that ultraconservatives who opposed Conciliation (led by Eusébio, Uruguai and Itaboraí) perceived the Emperor as being indispensable to the functioning of the political system: <b>an</b> <b>ultimate</b> and impartial arbiter when deadlock threatened. This new generation of ultraconservatives, unlike their predecessors, had no experience of the Regency and early years of PedroII's reign, when external and internal dangers threatened the nation's existence. They had only known a stable administration and prosperity. The young politicians saw no reason to uphold and defend the Imperial office as a unifying force beneficial to the nation. Unbeknownst to Rio Branco and PedroII, both had prepared the path to the Empire's later downfall.|$|E
5|$|The TNA X Division Championship was defended in <b>an</b> <b>Ultimate</b> X match, which {{involved}} A.J.

Styles at one point was climbing across the cables to retrieve the championship, when Sabin springboarded off the far top rope and performed a dropkick in mid-air to Styles. This caused Styles to perform a front-flip in mid-air and land {{on his back in}} the center of the ring. The finish of the match saw Williams and Sabin both hanging on the ropes, each holding one end of the belt. Styles then springboarded off the far top rope and grabbed the belt in mid-flight. After he landed on the mat, he was declared the official winner.|$|E

5|$|The {{story is}} written to follow {{principal}} landmarks with <b>an</b> <b>ultimate</b> destination, but leaves Martin room for improvisation.

Martin's editors, copy editors, and readers monitor for accidental mistakes, although some errors have slipped into publication. For instance, Martin has inconsistently referred to certain characters' eye colors, and has described a horse as being of one sex and then another.|$|E
