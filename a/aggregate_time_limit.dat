40|$|AbstractThe {{parallel}} resources {{time and}} hardware and the complexity classes defined by them are studied using the aggregate model. The equivalence of complexity classes defined by sequential space and uniform aggregate hardware is established. <b>Aggregate</b> <b>time</b> {{is related to}} (bounded fanin) circuit depth and, similarly, aggregate hardware is related to circuit width. Interelationships between <b>aggregate</b> <b>time</b> and hardware follow as corollaries. <b>Aggregate</b> <b>time</b> {{is related to the}} sequential resource reversal. Simultaneous relationships from <b>aggregate</b> hardware and <b>time</b> to sequential space and reversal are shown (and conversely), and these are used as evidence for an “extended parallel computation thesis. ” These simultaneous relationships provide new characterizations for the simultaneous parallel complexity class NC and for the complementary class SC. The evaluation of monotone planar circuits is shown to be in NC, in fact in LOGCFL...|$|R

40|$|<b>Time</b> <b>Limit</b> for Tax Assessment The thesis {{deals with}} the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> for tax {{assessment}} as it is regulated especially in the Tax Procedure Code (Act No. 280 / 2009 Coll.). The <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> for tax assessment represents {{a period of time}} during which it is possible to assess the tax. This <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> thus creates a time frame of the whole tax administration because tax decision is its aim, and in the case in which tax cannot be assessed {{there is no reason to}} proceed with any tax administration. Its main purpose consists in the establishment of certainty providing that after the lapse of the period of time, rights and duties relating to substantive tax law cannot be changed. The thesis is composed of two basic chapters. Chapter One is introductory and describes the phenomenon of <b>time</b> <b>limits.</b> It is subdivided into three parts. Part One focuses on the concept and categories of <b>time</b> <b>limits.</b> Part Two explains general aspects of the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> for tax assessment. Part Three {{deals with the}} calculation of <b>time</b> <b>limits.</b> Chapter Two focuses on legal regulation of the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> for tax assessment.

To this end, participants (N ¼ 43) {{were randomly assigned to}} a <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> pop-up condition or control condition, both of which involved gambling on an EGM in a virtual reality (VR) casino.

Macroeconomists therefore have described weak cyclicality of real wages as a salient feature of the business cycle. Contrary to this conventional wisdom, our analysis of longitudinal microdata indicates that real wages have been substantially procyclical since the 1960 's. We also find that the substantial procyclicality of men's real wages pertains even to workers that stay with the same employer and that women's real wages are less procyclical than men's. Numerous longitudinal studies besides ours have documented the substantial procyclicality of real wages, but none has adequately explained the discrepancy with the <b>aggregate</b> <b>time</b> series evidence. In accordance with a conjecture by Stockman (I 983), we show that the true procyclicality of real wages is obscured in <b>aggregate</b> <b>time</b> series because of a composition bias: the aggregate statistics are constructed {{in a way that}} gives more weight to low-skill workers during expansions than during recessions. We conclude that, because real wages actually are much more procyclical than they appear in aggregate statistics, theories designed to explain the supposed weakness of real wage cyclicality may be unnecessary. and theories that predict substantially procyclical real wages become more credible. ...|$|R
