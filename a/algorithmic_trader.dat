50|$|A zero-intelligence trader (ZI) is {{a simple}} <b>algorithmic</b> <b>trader</b> in a market based on the dumb agent theory who proposes to {{purchase}} (bid) or to sell (ask) randomly, subject only to minimal constraints. Constraints might be resource or bankruptcy constraints imposed externally {{by the rules of}} the market. Ownership of sufficient resources to buy the items the trader bids for, or ownership of resources the trader offers for sale are examples of such market-imposed constraints. Alternatively, the constraints may be internal to the trader. Not bidding more than the value of the resource to the trader, and not asking less than the cost of the resource to the trader are examples of such internal constraints. Under either interpretation, ZI traders use minimal intelligence in choosing their actions in markets.|$|E

In order {{to assess the impact}} of such concepts, e. g. effects on the price formation or the volatility of prices, a simulation environment is presented that provides stylized implementations of algorithmic trading behavior and allows for modeling latency. As simulations allow for reproducing exactly the same basic situation, an assessment of the impact of algorithmic trading models can be conducted by comparing different simulation runs including and excluding a trader constituting an algorithmic trading model in its trading behavior. By this means the impact of Algorithmic Trading on different characteristics of market outcome can be assessed.

Compared to a trader who cannot learn from market dynamics or from a view of the market, the algorithmic trader's profits are higher and more certain. Even though the trader executes a strategy based on a directional view, the sources of profits are both from making the spread as well as capital appreciation of inventories. Higher volatility of prices considerably impairs the trader's ability to learn from price innovations, but this adverse effect can be circumvented by learning from a collection of assets that comove.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} impact of market structure developments on order submission strategies and market quality. The importance of these issues is underscored by the increasing prevalence of algorithmic trading in domestic and international equities markets over the past decade, as technological advances and market structures change the way market participants, exchanges, and regulators behave and interact. <b>Algorithmic</b> <b>traders</b> are becoming an increasingly significant liquidity demanding and supplying market participant, whose growing prevalence {{can be attributed to}} the increasing speed at which they can interact with a market and/or web of interlinked markets. Each essay addresses a research question and set of testable hypotheses that are underscored by scarce or conflicting prior research findings regarding {{the impact of}} contemporary market structure developments on order submission strategies and market quality. The first essay investigates the trading performance and price impact of <b>algorithmic</b> <b>traders</b> relative to the other market participants. Results indicate that <b>algorithmic</b> <b>traders</b> trade at less favourable prices than human traders when initiating trades. <b>Algorithmic</b> <b>traders</b> also position their limit orders closer to the best bid and ask quotes compared to human traders. The second essay computes queue time as the time (seconds and milliseconds) that a passive resting order remains at the best bid (buy) or offer (sell) before it interacts with a marketable counterparty trade. This essay offers an empirical examination of waiting costs which are analysed in a range of theoretical literature. The final essay examines the relationship between cost recovery and fee models that charge brokers for market participation with respect to message traffic and trading activity, and high frequency trading and market quality.

40|$|There has {{recently}} been {{a considerable amount of}} research into algorithmic traders that learn [7, 27, 21, 19]. A variety of machine learning techniques have been used, including reinforcement learning [20, 11, 19, 5, 21]. We propose a reinforcement learning agent that can adapt to underlying market regimes by observing the market through signals generated at short and long timescales, and by using the CHQ algorithm [23], a hierarchical method which allows the agent to change its strategies after observing certain signals. We hypothesise that reinforcement learning agents using hierarchical reinforcement learning are superior to standard reinforcement learning agents in markets with regime change. This was tested through a market simulation based on data from the Russell 2000 index [4]. A significant difference was only found in the trivial case, and we concluded that a difference does not exist for our agent design. It was also observed and empirically verified that our standard agent learns different strategies depending on how much information it is given and whether it is charged a commission cost for trading.

40|$|Thesis (M. M. (Finance & Investment)) [...] University of the Witwatersrand, Faculty of Commerce, Law and Management, Graduate School of Business Administration, 2013. The {{evidence}} {{put forward}} by Zhang (2010) indicates that algorithmic trading can potentially generate the momentum effect evident in empirical market research. In addition, upon analysis of the literature, {{it is apparent that}} <b>algorithmic</b> <b>traders</b> possess a comparative informational advantage relative to regular traders. Finally, the theoretical model proposed by Wang (1993), indicates that the informational differences between traders fundamentally influences the nature of asset prices, even generating serial return correlations. Thus, applied to the study, the theory holds that algorithmic trading would {{have a significant effect on}} security return dynamics, possibly even engendering the momentum effect. This paper tests such implications by proposing a theory to explain the momentum effect based on the hypothesis that <b>algorithmic</b> <b>traders</b> possess Innovative Information about a firm’s future performance. From this perspective, Innovative Information can be defined as the information derived from the ability to accumulate, differentiate, estimate, analyze and utilize colossal quantities of data by means of adept techniques, sophisticated platforms, capabilities and processing power. Accordingly, an <b>algorithmic</b> <b>trader’s</b> access to various complex computational techniques, infrastructure and processing power, together with the constraints to human information processing, allow them to make judgments that are superior to the judgments of other traders. This particular aspect of algorithmic trading remains, to the best of my knowledge, unexplored as an avenue or mechanism, through which algorithmic trading could possibly affect the momentum effect and thus market efficiency. Interestingly, by incorporating this information variable into a simplified representative agent model, we are able to produce return patterns consistent with the momentum effect in its entirety. The general thrust of our results, therefore, is that algorithmic trading can hypothetically generate the return anomaly known as the momentum effect. Our results give credence to the assumption that algorithmic trading is having a detrimental effect on stock market efficiency...|$|R

Our dataset represents a majority of global interdealer trading in three major currency pairs in 2006 and 2007. Importantly, it contains precise observations of the size and {{the direction of the}} computer-generated and human-generated trades each minute. The empirical analysis provides several important insights. First, we find evidence that algorithmic trades tend to be correlated, suggesting that the algorithmic strategies used in the market are not as diverse as those used by non-algorithmic traders. Second, we find that, despite the apparent correlation of algorithmic trades, there is no evident causal relationship between algorithmic trading and increased exchange rate volatility. If anything, the presence of more algorithmic trading is associated with lower volatility. Third, we show that even though some <b>algorithmic</b> <b>traders</b> appear to restrict their activity in the minute following macroeconomic data releases, <b>algorithmic</b> <b>traders</b> increase their provision of liquidity over the hour following each release.

30|$|Although pairs {{trading is}} deemed {{relatively}} safe for market or sector arbitrageurs, nothing is really safe from the price swings within a sector. Such price swings could obliterate a short-term profit, and in some cases, bankrupt a financially stable hedger; see for example, Goldstein [15]. Typically, this risk is dealt with by unwinding a short position and attempting to absorb minimal losses. Such a strategy is taken by aggressive high-frequency <b>algorithmic</b> <b>traders</b> as their positions are usually neutral {{at the end of}} each trading day. Alternatively, as described in Khandani and Lo [16], a trader needs to monitor closely a constantly changing reverting level of the portfolio. This is because exit from an unprofitable trade is necessary when reversion to the mean does not materialise. This clearly implies that spread modelling and generating of forecast error bounds are critical as they provide the foundation of decision-making on when trade exits must occur.|$|R
40|$|Today's trading {{landscape}} is a fragmented and complex system of interconnected electronic markets in which <b>algorithmic</b> <b>traders</b> {{are responsible for}} the majority of trading activity. Questions about the effects of algorithmic trading naturally lend themselves to a computational approach, given the nature of the algorithms involved and the electronic systems in place for processing and matching orders. To better understand the economic implications of algorithmic trading, I construct computational agent-based models of scenarios with investors interacting with various <b>algorithmic</b> <b>traders.</b> I employ the simulation-based methodology of empirical game-theoretic analysis to characterize trader behavior in equilibrium under different market conditions. I evaluate the impact of algorithmic trading and market structure within three different scenarios. First, I examine the impact of a market maker on trading gains in a variety of environments. A market maker facilitates trade and supplies liquidity by simultaneously maintaining offers to buy and sell. I find that market making strongly tends to increase total welfare and the market maker is itself profitable. Market making may or may not benefit investors, however, depending on market thickness, investor impatience, and the number of trading opportunities. Second, I investigate the interplay between market fragmentation and latency arbitrage, a type of algorithmic trading strategy in which traders exercise superior speed in order to exploit price disparities between exchanges. I show that the presence of a latency arbitrageur degrades allocative efficiency in continuous markets. Periodic clearing at regular intervals, as in a frequent call market, not only eliminates the opportunity for latency arbitrage but also significantly improves welfare. Lastly, I study whether frequent call markets could potentially coexist alongside the continuous trading mechanisms employed by virtually all modern exchanges. I examine the strategic behavior of fast and slow traders who submit orders to either a frequent call market or a continuous double auction. I model this as a game of market choice, and I find strong evidence of a predator-prey relationship between fast and slow traders: the fast traders prefer to be with slower agents regardless of market, and slow traders ultimately seek the protection of the frequent call market...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Autonomous {{agents are}} widely applied to {{automate}} interactions in robotics, e. g. for selling and purchasing goods on eBay, and in financial markets, e. g. {{in the form}} of quote machines and <b>algorithmic</b> <b>traders.</b> Current research investigates efficient economic mechanisms that fully automate the provisioning and usage processes of Gridbased services. On the one hand, consumers want to allocate resources on demand for their various applications, e. g. data sharing, stream processing, email, business applications and simulations. On the other hand, providers of Grid services want to govern business policies to meet their utilization and profit goals. The above-mentioned processes are not manually manageable, however, because decisions need to be taken within milliseconds. Therefore, such processes have to be automated to minimize human interactions. Hence, market mechanisms and strategic behavior play important roles when it comes to achieving automated and efficient allocation of Grid services.

40|$|Technical {{analysis}} tools {{are widely used}} by short term investors in the financial market to identify trading opportunities and generate abnormal profit. Two {{of the most popular}} ones, Moving Average Convergence - Divergence and Bollinger Bands, are adopted in this study for <b>algorithmic</b> <b>traders</b> and statistical arbitragers (intraday trading) to reveal their effectiveness in terms of realizing sizeable profit before and after transaction cost. The simple oscillator signals derived from MACD and BB fail to efficiently recognize optimal trading timing and negative profit before and after transaction cost are realized under both strategies. Numerical analysis describes the sensitivity of profit with and without transaction fee to the strategies parameters. The results disclose that the selection of relevant parameters is not able to improve the performance of the strategies. A Long Only Filter Strategy (LOFS) is created to further investigate the possible strategies employed by institutional investors.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} the first {{directly}} to study the entire limit order book of a large market. Herein, I conduct a population study on the microstructure of the Eurodollar future market, to my knowledge this is a) the first study of its type and b) the largest microstructure study ever conducted. I will build a data-drive model that incorporates information from {{the entire population of}} quotes updates and transactions on this type of future market. This thesis aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the market microstructure on money market derivatives and the impact of high-speed algorithmic trading activity on the market characteristics and quality. I apply a broad battery of market volatility and liquidity measurements, and gauge the proportion of high-frequency <b>algorithmic</b> <b>traders</b> in the market. This thesis provides a standard asymmetric information based theoretical model to predict the relation on the term structure of Eurodollar future contracts. The prediction is a non-linear relation between the saturation of <b>algorithmic</b> <b>traders</b> (ATs) versus the impacts {{on the quality of the}} market. Therefore, I develop a novel semi-parametric estimator and model the non-linear relation between the impact of the fraction of algorithmic trading and a large set of different market quality indicators including volatility, liquidity and price informativeness. Finally, I consider the efficiency and the speed of high-frequency prices formation by implementing the return autocorrelations and vector autoregression, and also make a contribution to the trade classification algorithm using the order book data. My findings are fourfold. First, the impact of high-frequency trading (HFT) on market quality is a non-linear by implementing the semi-parametric model. This may partially explain why prior studies have found contradictory results regarding the impact of high-frequency traders (HFTs) on market characteristics. Second, prior studies only including the inside quotes or best bid best ask are limited to reflect all the information in the market. My findings suggest that the second level quoting in the limit order book is by far the most rapidly quoted element of the order book. Furthermore, I find that wavelet variance covariance of the bid and the ask side changes substantially over the term structure; providing further supporting evidence of the non-linear impact of HFTs. Finally, the adjustment time of the trade prices formation process is within one second, and the quote prices are even faster within 200 milliseconds (ms). The mid-quoted return autocorrelation is positive and gradually increase from the shortest time interval to the longest time interval. The trade prices are less sensitive to new information as the contract approaches its maturity. ...|$|R
