5|$|Meanwhile, the {{strength}} of the American and British bomber fleets had increased. Based in Britain, they began operations against German targets. The first thousand-bomber raid was staged on Cologne on 30 May 1942.

Göring refused to believe reports that American fighters had been shot down as far east as Aachen in winter 1943. His reputation began to decline.|$|E

40|$|The {{lift-off}} of {{jet diffusion}} flames of a liquid fuel in coflowing streams of air was established experimentally {{for a range}} of jet discharge and stream velocities. The improvement in the lift-off stability of the flame due to the presence of a small concentration of an <b>auxiliary</b> gaseous <b>fuel</b> in the surrounding air was established. Liquid n-heptane was the jet fuel while methane, ethylene, propane, and hydrogen were employed individually in small concentrations as the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>fuels.</b> It is shown that the lift-off distance and the corresponding ignition delay of the jet flame can be correlated for all the observations made in terms of derived dimensionless grouping of the main parameters varied, which included the jet discharge velocity, the sur-rounding stream velocity, and the concentration of the fuel added to the surroundings of the flame...|$|R

Armament depends on mission, but includes anti-ship missiles, torpedoes, three door-mounted machine guns, multi-purpose rocket, cannon pods, air-to-air missiles and air-to-surface missiles.

5|$|Nearly {{half of all}} U.S. Apaches were {{deployed}} to Saudi Arabia following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990. During Operation Desert Storm on 17 January 1991, eight AH-64As guided by four MH-53 Pave Low IIIs destroyed part of Iraq's radar network in the operation's first attack, allowing the attack aircraft to evade detection. The Apaches each carried an asymmetric load of Hydra 70 flechette rockets, Hellfires, and one <b>auxiliary</b> <b>fuel</b> tank. During the 100-hour ground war a total of 277 AH-64s took part, destroying 278 tanks, numerous armored personnel carriers and other Iraqi vehicles. One AH-64 {{was lost in the}} war, to a rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) hit at close range, the Apache crashed but the crew survived.|$|E
5|$|At 14:30, D Company {{launched}} an assault against the ridge {{south of the}} road, with two platoons of Sherman tanks in support from D Company, US 89th Tank Battalion. One tank platoon led the attack followed by the other carrying infantry from 10 Platoon D Company. Under the command of Lieutenant David Mannett, 10 Platoon made a right flanking assault along the road, while 11 and 12 Platoons attacked the ridge frontally across the paddy fields. Meeting stronger resistance than expected however, the attackers {{came under heavy fire}} and one of the Sherman tanks was knocked out by an armour-piercing round that hit its turret. However, with the American tanks providing vital close support to the infantry, 10 Platoon successfully secured its objective, allowing it to take the North Koreans in enfilade and to provide fire support to the assault. Thus, despite strong opposition, the remainder of D Company gained the high ground by 16:30. With the earlier airstrikes having been ineffective, D Company had been opposed by a number of T-34 tanks and SU-76 self-propelled guns, however the bulk of these were destroyed by the Shermans during the assault. Another tank had been knocked out by well-directed fire at point-blank range from a Bren light machine-gun by Private John Stafford, which caused the armoured vehicle's <b>auxiliary</b> <b>fuel</b> tanks to ignite, resulting in its ammunition exploding. Stafford was subsequently awarded the US Silver Star for his bravery.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Supercritical water {{oxidation}} in hydrothermal flames is {{a promising}} method {{for the total}} destruction of refractory compounds because it can overcome corrosion and salt deposition problems. In case of wastewater with a low reaction heat, the use of <b>auxiliary</b> <b>fuels,</b> to increase the reaction heat for the auto thermal operation is necessary. Methanol and isopropyl-alcohol were usually used as fuels. This paper compares the two fuels in hydrothermal flames and reviews the experimental results of salts, acetic acid, dioxins, ammonia, sludge and phenols of naphthalene and toluene. The {{results show that the}} destruction process obtains high TOC removals, and phenols are easy to cause soot formation problems. If soot deposition problems can be solved, supercritical water oxidation in hydrothermal flames will have a bright prospect for commercial applications...|$|R

40|$|Waste gases with {{potentially}} useful fuel value are generated at {{any number of}} points in refineries, chemical plants and other industrial and commercial sites. The higher quality streams have been utilized successfully in fuel systems for years. Lower quality streams, often difficult to capture and sometimes limited in quantity, have often not been utilized for their fuel value. Increasing environmental and economic concerns have led to greater interest in utilizing these marginal fuel value waste gas streams as <b>auxiliary</b> <b>fuels.</b> The combustion and heat transfer characteristics of these fuels are different from normal fuels and these differences must be considered when determining {{if they can be}} fired successfully in existing furnaces or when designing new furnaces to use them.

40|$|Metallurgy {{represents}} complex technological chain {{supplied with}} {{different kinds of}} primary resources. Iron metallurgy based on blast-furnace process, dominates in world steel production. Metallurgical coke is the basic fuel in this case. Its production is connected with several environmental disadvantageous impacts. One {{of them is the}} extended production chain from primary energy to final energy. The reduction of coke consumption in the process can be achieved e. g. by injection of <b>auxiliary</b> <b>fuels</b> or increasing the thermal parameters in the process. In present injection of pulverised coal dominates while recirculation of top-gas seems to be future technology. However, the latter one requires the CO 2 removal that additionally extended the production chain. The evaluation of resources management in complex energy-technological systems required application of advanced method based on thermodynamics. In the paper the system exergo-ecological assessment of pulverised coal injection into blast-furnace and top-gas recirculation has been applied. As a comparative criterion the thermo-ecological cost has been proposed...|$|R
