Previous approaches mined research community by using network connectivity or by ignoring semantics-based intrinsic structure of the words <b>and</b> <b>author’s</b> relationships present between the conferences. In this paper, we propose a novel Venue-Author-Topic (VAT) approach which can consider semantics-based intrinsic structure of words <b>and</b> <b>authors</b> correlations, simultaneously. We also show how topics <b>and</b> <b>authors</b> can be inferred for new conferences <b>and</b> <b>authors</b> correlations can be discovered by using proposed approach. Experimental results on the corpus downloaded from DBLP shows the effectiveness of proposed approach and the detailed interpretation of results reveals interesting information about the research community...|$|R
