5|$|HMS Neptune {{was laid}} down in 1873 for the Brazilian Navy {{under the name of}} Independencia by J & W Dudgeon in Cubitt Town, London. The {{shipyard}} attempted to launch her on 16 July 1874, but she stuck fast and did not budge. A second attempt was made on 30 July during which the ship got about one-third down the slipway and stuck, extensively damaging her bottom plating. She was finally launched on 10 September, after she had been lightened, and she was towed to Samuda Brothers for repairs <b>and</b> <b>fitting</b> out. The cost of the accident resulted in the bankruptcy of Dudgeons in 1875.|$|E
5|$|Labour difficulties, late {{delivery}} of equipment, additional requirements for Australian operations, and the prioritisation of merchant shipping over naval construction delayed {{the completion of}} Majestic. Incorporation of the new systems and enhancements caused {{the cost of the}} RAN carrier acquisition program to increase to AUÂ£8.3million. Construction <b>and</b> <b>fitting</b> out did not finish until October 1955. As the carrier neared completion, a commissioning crew was formed in Australia and first used to return Vengeance to the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|The 1982 work-ins {{took place}} from 24 July to 1 August and 21 August to 29 August. The work planned {{included}} {{the completion of}} the brickwork {{at the top of the}} tower, installation of the Elm curb, a start on the construction of the new cap, installing machinery and making <b>and</b> <b>fitting</b> various doors and windows. The cap frame was constructed, incorporating two beams from the original cap frame that were fit to be reused. The cap frame was completed in autumn 1982. It had been constructed upside down and a mobile crane was used to turn it over and place the windshaft into position.|$|E

5|$|The binding and {{inactivation}} {{steps of}} this reaction are investigated by incubating the enzyme with inhibitor and assaying {{the amount of}} activity remaining over time. The activity will be decreased in a time-dependent manner, usually following exponential decay. Fitting these data to a rate equation gives the rate of inactivation at this concentration of inhibitor. This is done at several different concentrations of inhibitor. If a reversible EI complex is involved the inactivation rate will be saturable <b>and</b> <b>fitting</b> this curve will give kinact and Ki.|$|E
5|$|The mass of Beta Pictoris {{has been}} {{determined}} by using models of stellar evolution <b>and</b> <b>fitting</b> them to the star's observed properties. This method yields a stellar mass between 1.7 and 1.8 solar masses. The star's angular diameter has been measured using interferometry with the Very Large Telescope and {{was found to be}} 0.84 milliarcseconds. Combining this value with the distance of 63.4 light years gives a radius 1.8 times that of the Sun.|$|E
5|$|A bill {{setting out}} {{arrangements}} for funding and building the fleet was finalized in mid-July 1914. At {{this time the}} Navy had not yet settled on a final battleship design. It was planned that the first ship's keel would be laid in December 1914 <b>and</b> <b>fitting</b> out be completed sometime in 1918. The bill was not immediately introduced into parliament, however, as Idenburg was given until 10 August to comment on it. The outbreak of the First World War led to the bill being withdrawn due to the uncertain international circumstances and the impossibility of buying battleships from foreign shipbuilders in wartime. Instead, the Government ordered three s in 1915, though only two were completed.|$|E

5|$|No.486 (Maintenance) Squadron was {{established}} at RAAF Station Schofields, New South Wales, on 26August 1946. Commanded by Wing Commander Alexander Abicair, its allocated strength was 257, including ten officers. The unit {{was part of}} No.86 (Transport) Wing, which also controlled Nos.36, 37, and 38 Squadrons, flying Douglas C-47 Dakotas, and No.386 (Base) Squadron. No.37 Squadron was disbanded in February 1948 and No.386 Squadron in March 1949. On 22June 1949, No.86 Wing, comprising Nos.36, 38 and 486 Squadrons, relocated to the nearby RAAF Station Richmond. No.486 Squadron's role included servicing and replacing engines, <b>and</b> <b>fitting</b> long-range fuel tanks and spraying equipment. It occasionally serviced CAC Wirraways {{in addition to its}} Dakota maintenance tasks.|$|E
5|$|Waldeck-Rousseau, {{named for}} the {{recently}} deceased Prime Minister of France, Pierre Waldeck-Rousseau, was ordered on 31 July 1905 and was laid down at the Arsenal de Lorient on 16 June 1906. She was launched on 4 March 1908, <b>and</b> <b>fitting</b> out work was completed in time to begin sea trials in January 1911. While on her acceptance trials on 2 February, she struck a submerged object that bent her port propeller shaft and damaged the screw. Waldeck-Rousseau was completed in August; the ship was the most powerful armored cruiser completed by France, but she entered service {{two years after the}} British battlecruiser , which rendered the armored cruiser obsolescent as a warship type. Her lengthy construction interfered with the scheduled keel-laying for the new predreadnought battleship Mirabeau, which could not be started until Waldeck-Rousseau was launched. After entering service the new cruiser was assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet, based in Toulon.|$|E
5|$|The railway {{was also}} {{upgraded}} at this time. Thomas Ward Ltd supplied replacement track in 1955, {{and a new}} 0-4-0 diesel electric shunter was ordered from Ruston and Hornsby Ltd in 1959. It was delivered from Lincoln on a low-loader in 1960, and was so successful that a second engine of the same type was ordered the following year. The Hudswell Clarke steam engine was cut up on site in 1962, but the Corporation wrote to Peckett's {{to see if they}} would convert the Peckett engine to diesel hydraulic transmission. Peckett's declined, and so the engine was converted at the works, by cutting off the boiler and saddle tank, <b>and</b> <b>fitting</b> a Perkins diesel engine removed from a crane. It was completed on 12 May 1962, and worked well, although it spent most of its subsequent life working at Thrybergh tip. It returned to Blackburn Meadows in 1967, and was cut up later that year. A prototype steel side-tipping wagon was ordered from Robert Hudson Ltd of Leeds in 1955, and a further 22 followed in 1957, to replace the original wooden wagons. Charles Roberts and Co Ltd of Wakefield supplied 12 more in 1958, and a further 35 in 1961, with Hudsons supplying the final 6 in 1963.|$|E
