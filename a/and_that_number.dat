25|$|Circular {{migration}} is also connected to health issues around the world. First, many circular migrants work {{in situations where}} they are more vulnerable to contracting sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Several factors seem to create the perfect storm for the spread of diseases such as HIV. Many times, migrants are young, isolated, lonely, and have cash, which may lead them to sex and drugs. Evidence supports the idea that circular migrants become ill while working in urban areas and return home to die with their families. In addition to their personal elevated risk of contracting and dying from STDs, they are also at risk of spreading the diseases to their home communities upon return. Circular migrants make up a substantial proportion of those dying from HIV/TB, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>number</b> continues to increase dramatically.|$|E
500|$|The {{company was}} {{constantly}} emphasizing its stock price. Management was compensated extensively using stock options, {{similar to other}} U.S. companies. This policy of stock option awards caused management to create expectations of rapid growth in efforts to {{give the appearance of}} reported earnings to meet Wall Street's expectations.

At budget meetings, Skilling would develop target earnings by asking [...] "What earnings do you need to keep our stock price up?"

Using Enron's January 2001 stock price of $83.13 and the directors’ beneficial ownership reported in the 2001 proxy, the value of director stock ownership was $659 million for Lay, and $174 million for Skilling.|$|E

500|$|The DuPont Highway was {{a boon to}} {{southern}} Delaware, which had formerly been economically isolated from the large cities of the northeast. In conjunction {{with the rise of}} the automobile, the highway spurred the growth of the Delaware Beaches by greatly improving access to the coast for tourists from northern Delaware and adjacent portions of the Northeast megalopolis. Southern Delaware also developed into a major truck farming region due to having much greater access to urban markets. No longer fully reliant on the railroads to transport their goods, farmers in Sussex and Kent counties could market their fruits, vegetables, and broiler chickens directly to consumers in the north. However, the passenger and freight traffic induced by this increased economic integration and the automobile boom of the 1920s meant that these roads in Delaware and Maryland constructed in the 1910s and 1920s, which were built with widths of , were no longer adequate for the traffic they served. In particular, by 1929 the SelbyvilleMilford portion of the DuPont Highway was the only through highway in Delaware with a width of less than [...] The highway's importance was further implied when the Pocomoke City to Dover highway became part of the United States Numbered Highway System.

In the final report the Commission raised the total estimated maximum to 30,000 deaths in order to account for the possibility of unreported deaths.The commission found that the demographic estimates by the German government of 220,000 to 270,000 civilian deaths due to expulsions from Czechoslovakia were based on faulty data. [...] The Commission determined that the demographic estimates by the German government counted as missing 90,000 ethnic Germans assimilated into the Czech population; military deaths were understated and that the 1950 census data used to compute the demographic losses was unreliable.|$|E
2500|$|Septic sores became {{common in}} the EFF {{during the summer of}} 1917. In July, 22 per cent of the Anzac Mounted Division was {{suffering}} from these sores, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>number</b> increased in August. The sores were blamed mainly on poor diet, which was lacking in variety, vegetables, and clean water. Mosquito bites contributed to the prevalence of septic sores, but flies were the main reason minor cuts and scratches became septic. Flies were everywhere, in the men's drinks, food, and tents. The sores, which took the form of superficial ulcerations {{on the surface of the}} skin, often occurred following a slight injury to the hands. They were painful and hard to treat except by antiseptics, and such treatment was [...] "hardly practicable in the field." [...] The majority of the men suffering sores on hands or faces had to wear bandages, which [...] "had a lowering and irritating effect upon the men." [...] On the hands these dressings made work difficult; and, although dressings were changed twice daily, they became [...] "filthy in no time," [...] due to the dust.

2500|$|The hymn, This {{stone to}} thee in faith we lay, was sung, {{and in his}} sermon Rev,. J.W. Bardsley spoke about {{the way in which}} the mass {{movement}} of people to cities had had a consequence in which [...] "large numbers of the people of England had grown up in habits of non-attendance in the House of God," [...] and this had caused the Church of England to split city parishes and build more churches. He said that in the 1881 Census the population of the Huddersfield parish was 9,201, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>number</b> had increased greatly since the Census. Moreover, the Parish Church had only 500 free seats. This was the reason why the parish had been split, and St Mark's built as an extra church, on land given by Sir John Ramsden. He said that poorer people had [...] "collected considerable sums of money by means of collecting cards." [...] He told the parish congregation that they must raise sufficient funds for the remaining building work, and for an endowment as well. They then sang, Christ is our corner stone. The collection was £42 1s 1d. The treasurer Mr E. Armitage said that they had been promised subscriptions of about £4,800, but that they needed £6,000 to cover the endowment. They had incurred liabilities of around £4,000, and they needed another £1,200. They had received nearly £3,700 in hard cash, but they had had to buy out the leaseholder of the land that they'd been given. So the congregation was constrained, in an area of much poverty, to raise more funds.|$|E
