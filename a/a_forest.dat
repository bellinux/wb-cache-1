40|$|Extract] Big {{trees are}} among the oldest and largest of all living organisms and store much of <b>a</b> <b>forest's</b> carbon, locking it up safely rather than {{releasing}} it as heat-trapping greenhouses gases. In general they comprise less than 2 per cent of <b>a</b> <b>forest's</b> trees, but due to their wide energy-absorbing canopies, they can make up to 25 per cent of <b>a</b> <b>forest's</b> total biomass...|$|R
5000|$|<b>A</b> high <b>forest</b> is <b>a</b> type of <b>forest</b> {{originated}} from seed or from planted seedlings. In contrast to <b>a</b> low <b>forest</b> (also known as <b>a</b> coppice <b>forest),</b> <b>a</b> high <b>forest</b> usually consists of large, tall mature trees with a closed canopy. High forests can occur naturally {{or they can}} be created and/or maintained by human management. Trees in <b>a</b> high <b>forest</b> can be of one, a few or many species. <b>A</b> high <b>forest</b> can be even-aged or uneven-aged. [...] Even-aged forests contain trees of one, or two successional age classes (generations). Uneven-aged forests have three or more age classes represented.|$|R
50|$|Example: Suppose that <b>a</b> two-way {{transitive}} <b>forest</b> trust {{exists between}} the forest root domains in <b>Forest</b> <b>A</b> and <b>Forest</b> B, and another two-way transitive forest trust {{exists between the}} forest root domains in Forest B and <b>Forest</b> C. Such <b>a</b> configuration lets users in Forest B access resources in any domain in either <b>Forest</b> <b>A</b> or <b>Forest</b> C, and users in <b>Forest</b> <b>A</b> or C can access resources in any domain in Forest B. However, it does not let users in <b>Forest</b> <b>A</b> access resources in Forest C, or vice versa. To let users in <b>Forest</b> <b>A</b> and <b>Forest</b> C share resources, a two-way transitive trust must exist between both forests.|$|R

5|$|A {{saprophytic}} fungus, H. aurantiaca obtains {{nutrients from}} forest litter and decomposing wood, causing a brown rot {{on the wood}} upon which it grows. A Finnish field study on tree stumps in <b>a</b> <b>forest</b> near Helsinki found that the species colonised them after 6–7 years.|$|E

5|$|Cariappa {{was married}} in March 1937, in Secunderabad, to Muthu Machia, <b>a</b> <b>forest</b> officer's daughter. Though their married life was happy initially, later, {{due to an}} age gap of almost 17 years, ideological differences, and Cariappa's {{professional}} commitments, their marriage broke down. In September 1945, the couple separated without any formal divorce. Three years later Muthu died in an accident.|$|E
5|$|Countershading {{existed in}} marine {{reptiles}} in the Cretaceous period. Fossilised skin pigmented with dark-coloured eumelanin reveals that both leatherback turtles and mosasaurs had dark backs and light bellies. The ornithischian dinosaur Psittacosaurus similarly {{appears to have}} been countershaded, implying that its predators detected their prey by deducing shape from shading. Modelling suggests further that the dinosaur was optimally countershaded for a closed habitat such as <b>a</b> <b>forest.</b>|$|E
5|$|Curio Bay {{features}} the petrified remains of <b>a</b> <b>forest</b> 160 million years old. This represents {{a remnant of}} the subtropical woodland that once covered the region, only to become submerged by the sea.

5|$|In {{suitable}} environments, {{such as the}} Daintree Rainforest in Queensland, or {{the mixed}} podocarp and broadleaf forest of Ulva Island, New Zealand, forest is the more-or-less stable climatic climax community {{at the end of}} a plant succession, where open areas such as grassland are colonised by taller plants, which in turn give way to trees that eventually form <b>a</b> <b>forest</b> canopy.|$|E

After passing Headline Road (County Road44), the route divides <b>a</b> <b>forest</b> and then enters an agricultural area before coming upon the community of St. Andrews West. It crosses the Raisin River and continues north through a mix of farmland and forests.|$|E

5|$|The {{corresponding}} {{concept for}} undirected graphs is <b>a</b> <b>forest,</b> an undirected graph without cycles. Choosing an orientation for <b>a</b> <b>forest</b> produces {{a special kind}} of directed acyclic graph called a polytree. However there are many other kinds of directed acyclic graph that are not formed by orienting the edges of an undirected acyclic graph. Moreover, every undirected graph has an acyclic orientation, an assignment of a direction for its edges that makes it into a directed acyclic graph. To emphasize that DAGs are {{not the same thing as}} directed versions of undirected acyclic graphs, some authors call them acyclic directed graphs or acyclic digraphs.|$|E
