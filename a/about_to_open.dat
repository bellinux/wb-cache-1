5|$|In November 1897, Frank Chapman {{sponsored}} Beebe {{to become}} an associate member of the American Ornithologists' Union, and the following month Beebe gave his first professional lecture on ornithology to a society called Uncle Clarence's Bergen Point Culture Club. In 1899, although he had completed all of the required courses for a degree in science from Columbia except for mathematics, he decided to forgo his studies {{in favor of an}} invitation from Osborn to work at the New York Zoological Park which was <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>open.</b> Several factors contributed to this decision, including both excitement at being part of the zoo, and the sense that his studies were putting too much of a strain on his family's finances.|$|E
5|$|The German {{invasion}} of Poland began on 1 September 1939, and {{marked the beginning}} of World War II in Europe. Philipp's unit was tasked with bomber escort and ground attack as well as combat air patrol missions. He was credited with his first aerial victory on 5 September 1939 without firing a single shot. Philipp maneuvered himself into a favorable attack position and aimed carefully. Just as he was <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>open</b> fire, the enemy pilot bailed out. Nevertheless, he was given credit for the destruction of the aircraft and was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class, which was presented to him on 10 October 1939. He lost his wingman during the Phoney War air skirmishes with the Armée de l'Air (French Air Force) in late November 1939.|$|E
5|$|Passengers {{traveling}} from Western to Northern Norway had to transfer from Braathens SAFE to SAS in Trondheim. Both airlines {{saw this as}} a strategic opportunity to get routes in each other's territories. On 31 August 1960, Braathens SAFE applied for an extension of its Bergen–Ålesund–Trondheim route onwards to Bodø Airport and Bardufoss Airport. The two airports had been served by SAS from Oslo via Trondheim. SAS presented estimates that between 2.5 and 6.1 passengers transferred at Trondheim each day. Braathens SAFE later proposed that they could fly directly from Bergen and Ålesund to Bodø and Bardufoss, but Braathens SAFE's application {{was rejected by the}} ministry. All concessions ended on 31 March 1961, and the ministry extended them all one year. Three new airports, Alta Airport, Lakselv Airport, Banak and Kirkenes Airport, Høybuktmoen, were <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>open</b> and the ministry wanted to award new concessions that included these airports. Braathens SAFE applied to operate to all the airports in Northern Norway, but the contract was awarded to SAS. The latter also applied to operate a route from Northern Norway via Trondheim, Ålesund and Bergen to Stavanger, while Braathens SAFE in 1964 again applied for an extension of the West Coast route to Northern Norway. This was moderated to a direct route from Tromsø Airport to Bergen, which SAS received permission for on 4 March 1965.|$|E

25|$|Mystery guests {{would usually}} {{attempt to conceal}} their identities with {{disguised}} voices, much to the amusement of the studio audience. According to Cerf, the panel could often determine {{the identities of the}} mystery guests early, as they knew which celebrities were in town, or which major movies or plays were <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>open.</b> On those occasions, to provide the audience an opportunity to see the guest play the game, the cast would typically allow questioning to pass around at least once before coming up with the correct guess.|$|E
25|$|Hartford was <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>open</b> a new, modern {{downtown}} {{arena and}} convention center, the Hartford Civic Center. The city {{had hoped to}} get an American Basketball Association team as the main tenant, but when that fell through, city leaders {{got in touch with}} the Whalers. The area, aside from various minor league teams in New Haven, had been largely bereft of professional hockey until the Whalers' arrival. The Civic Center was still being finished when the 1974–75 season began, so the Whalers played {{the first part of the}} 1974–75 season at The Big E Coliseum in West Springfield, Massachusetts.|$|E
25|$|The {{event that}} {{eventually}} {{took place in}} Manchester, billed as Project Light Rail, was jointly staged by GMPTE, British Rail, BREL, GEC Alsthom, Balfour Beatty and Fairclough Civil Engineering. It {{was the first major}} public relations event for GMPTE to promote the light rail scheme for Manchester, and to demonstrate the proposed system the organisers looked instead to a new light rail system that was <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>open</b> later that year in London, the Docklands Light Railway (DLR). The public demonstration used an operational DLR train, DLR P86 number 11, which was on loan from GEC Transportation Projects. The train had been shipped over to Britain from the manufacturer, Linke-Hofmann-Busch, in Salzgitter, Germany, prior to its introduction onto the DLR system in London.|$|E

60|$|At this momentous time, {{when the}} first {{parallel}} before the besieged city was <b>about</b> <b>to</b> be <b>opened,</b> Washington received dispatches from his faithful coadjutor, General Greene, giving him important intelligence of his co-operations in the South; to consider which we will suspend for a moment our narrative of affairs before Yorktown.|$|R
25|$|Earlier, as General Ridgway was <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>open</b> Operation Courageous, {{the gains}} {{he already had}} {{registered}} in his Killer and Ripper advances had influenced a decision in Washington by which operations above the parallel assumed new importance as a political question. The decision centered on {{how and when to}} approach the desired cease-fire. Notwithstanding the building evidence of North Korean offensive preparations, officials of the Departments of State and Defense believed that Ridgway's recent successes might have convinced the Chinese and North Koreans that they could not win a military victory and, if this was the case, that they might agree to negotiate an end to hostilities. On the advice of these officials, President Harry S. Truman planned to make a public statement suggesting the United Nations' willingness to end the fighting. The statement was carefully worded to avoid a threatening tone and so to encourage a favorable reply. Truman intended to deliver the appeal as soon as his statement had been approved by officials of all nations that had contributed forces to the U.N. Command.|$|E

The camera follows these cables to an ethereal, white room where a robot with Björk's features lies in a fetal position. As the room lightens up, two mechanical arms begin to assemble the robot, which opens its eyes and begins to sing the song. Pistons pumping white fluids, as well as drilling and penetrative motions are seen, featuring a [...] "clear" [...] sexual subtext.|$|E
500|$|On 20 February 1907, Sir George Gibb, {{managing}} director of the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL), appointed Stanley as its general manager. The UERL was the holding company of four underground railways in central London. Three of these (the District Railway, the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway and the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway) were already in operation and the fourth (the Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway) was <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>open.</b> The UERL had been established by American financier Charles Yerkes and much of the finance and equipment had been brought from the United States, so Stanley's experience of managing urban transit systems in that country made him an ideal candidate for the position. The cost of constructing three new lines {{in just a few years}} had put the company in a precarious monetary position and income was not sufficient to pay the interest on its loans. [...] Stanley's responsibility was to restore its finances.|$|E

50|$|In July 1829 Boyd {{arrived in}} Hobart. Four years later Boyd was in {{dispute with the}} Surveyor General George Frankland <b>about</b> having <b>to</b> <b>open</b> a survey branch in Launceston. Bad health {{prevented}} Boyd from surveying Launceston and he was transferred back to Hobart after his failure at Launceston. When Frankland died, Boyd became Surveyor General, however his poor performance led to the governor seeking a replacement (this was to be Robert Power in July 1841).|$|R

He also gives her a large silver cross pendant. In The Bronze, Buffy meets Willow and encourages her to seize the moment: [...] "Because tomorrow you might be dead." [...] She finds Giles and tells him about the stranger. Giles tells her to learn to hone her skills to sense vampires anywhere. Buffy uses her fashion sense to pick out a vampire (J. Patrick Lawlor) in the club and is alarmed to see Willow leave with him. She loses them and is surprised by Cordelia, nearly staking her. Cordelia immediately calls her friends {{to tell them about}} it. While Buffy looks for Willow, Jesse chats up Darla at The Bronze. Buffy is stopped by Xander, whom she convinces to help search for Willow.|$|E

His family said: [...] "We absolutely do not believe that Mark committed suicide, or that his death was a simple accident." [...] They continue to press for information on Blanco's last hours at the party from those who were present, including society junkie Paul Roundhill and former Libertines singer Pete Doherty.|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, {{with the}} National World War II Memorial <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>open</b> in Washington, D.C., Representative Karen McCarthy (D-Missouri) {{introduced}} legislation (H.Con.Res. 421) in the United States House of Representatives to designate the Liberty Memorial as [...] "America's National World War I Museum". In the Senate, Senator Jim Talent (R-Missouri) sought agreement to amend S. 2400, the Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005, with identical language. Talent's amendment was unanimously {{adopted by the}} Senate on June 15, 2004. The Senate bill was reconciled with a similar House bill (H.R. 4200) in conference committee, and passed both houses of Congress. President George W.
