40|$|Abstract   A {{qualitative}} study of stress management within geriatric care   Authors: Hildingsson, Emelie & Magnusson, JessicaSupervisor: Hjorth Aronsson, Christina   Essay topic related to stress and stress {{management in the}} geriatric care. The {{purpose of this study is}} to ascertain how the unit managers, within care of elderly, in their role as manager and leader handle possible stress reactions among its nursing staff. Our purpose will generate the following issues;          How does the employer discover stress among the employees?         In what way is the stress taken care of among the geriatric care staff? What opportunities are there to prevent stress? The study is based on a qualitative research method. As a data collection method we've used semi-structured interviews and we have implemented them in five female heads in a medium-sized municipality in Sweden. We have used out of an interview guide where we divided the issues into three different themes; observation phase, taking care of phase and the possibility of prevention. In the analytical part, we have structured and categorized the material under each theme, and used us to further sub-headings to create a transparency. In addition to previous research, the theories about stress, work-related stress and stress from a gender perspective has been used as a basis for analysis of interview material. Our conclusion after study is that the unit managers in home care have a systematic approach for working with the environment in the workplace. Because there is a standing item on workplace meetings where the work is discussed it allows the heads of units to identify stress in the staff group. The action taken when the stress revealed by the Working Group is primarily supported calls from occupational health services, but also support from the Head of Unit in the form of <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> <b>duties.</b> There is no clear stress prevention in the workplace, but health and wellness, can be interpreted as a prevention effort. Lack of resources out as an explanation for the heads of units cannot handle the work-related stress in an ideal way.  Keywords: workrelated stress, stress, leadership, social care of elderly and stress managemen...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The work {{presented}} in this paper is about the design of current-controlled oscillators (ICO). Two ICOs are proposed. Aiming at reducing the duration of the short-circuit currents caused by slowly-changing voltages in the circuits, signal conversion blocks are introduced to generate sharp pulses. In this way, the power efficiency of the circuits is improved, which leads to an extensive performance improvement of the circuits. Both ICOs can operate over a frequency range from 100 KHz to 900 MHz. The quality of the output waveforms before buffers is good and over the entire frequency range the rise/fall time is consistently short. The power dissipation of the ICOs is very low, {{the same as that of}} a 5 -stage current-starving ring oscillator. Moreover, the scheme of the ICOs allows an easy <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>duty</b> cycle <b>of</b> the output pulse signals. A simple digital control structure <b>of</b> the <b>duty</b> cycle has also been proposed. I...|$|R
40|$|Typically, in a {{half-bridge}} converter A DC {{blocking capacitor}} and inductance on the primary side combines with the inductor and capacitor on the secondary side to produce complicated converter dynamic characteristics that make converter stabilization difficult. The disclosed system and methods enable converter stabilization by modulating, {{as a function}} of the voltage across the DC blocking capacitor, the feedback output error signal or the ramp signal for the PWM controller of the converter. The modulation removes the effect of the resonant circuit formed by the primary inductance and the DC blocking capacitor in the output voltage regulation loop. Further <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>duty</b> cycle <b>of</b> the power switches enables keeping the output voltage undisturbed by voltage variation across the DC blocking capacitor. Since, this inner compensation loop results in the voltage regulation feedback loop respond to only the output inductor-capacitor filter, the transfer function of this loop displays second order characteristics from the fourth order. Hence, stability issues are simplified to conventional second order compensation network whereby the converter can be optimized for fast transient response. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

40|$|The {{liability}} {{of the employee}} for damage in theory and practice The purpose of this thesis is to analyse the national legislative framework and highlight the differences between theory and practical application of the employee's liability for damage caused to the employer. The reason for my research {{is based on the}} fact that the importance of this issue is increasing driven by the fact that more people are employed with the multinational corporations. And there is an obvious trend to broadly interpreted, unilaterally extend and refine <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> the employees to such an extent that it is appropriate to raise a question, whether these approach is still in accordance with the law. Especially due to the fact, that such duties are often bound by sanctions in the form of claiming damages or even termination of the employment by notice. While the Labour Code in its general provisions clearly states that the <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> the employee's <b>duties</b> may only be stipulated as a result of bilateral legal negotiations. The thesis is composed of nine chapters, some of which are further internally divided into sub- chapters. Chapter One is introductory and contains my considerations of the importance of Labour Law, examine its historical development in recent decades and its current status within the national legislative [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{characteristic}} {{direction of}} psychological and theological interpretations of spirituality is very important. The traditional psychological {{approach to the}} spiritual sphere is characterised by reductionism, which consists in reducing spiritual experiences to mental experiences, or even biological processes. The studies {{in the field of}} religion psychology led to distinguish between two types of spirituality. The first one is theocentric spirituality, where human being places God in the centre of his interest and life in general. The second type of spirituality is anthropocentric spirituality, focused on human being, his own aspirations, preferences and needs. Both types of spirituality have certain value. Their close characteristics includes sources of inspiration, purpose, presented image of God, as well as understanding of spirituality and manner of realizing spiritual life. In order to distinguish between two types of spirituality, anthropocentric and theocentric, in practice, a proper research method – Range of Theocentric and Anthropocentric Spirituality (SDT – DA) had to be developed. The individuals with theocentric spirituality displayed a higher level of stability and emotional balance, better social <b>adjustment,</b> higher sense <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> and attachment to acceptable social standards, deeper and more satisfactory contacts with other human beings, more trust and openness towards others, as well as higher trust to themselves and to God. Such individuals are better at handling difficulties and have optimistic attitude to life...|$|R
