Existing game-theoretic works that examine this issue use indivisible-good models, despite the fact that most issues over which states have disputes, e. g., territory, are in principle divisible. We game-theoretically investigate how {{one of the most prominent}} signaling mechanisms, namely public commitments, operate in a divisible-good setting.

50|$|Each {{state and}} society {{emerging}} from conflict have their own specific interplay of sub-national, national, regional and international drivers of insecurity and effective international engagement in fragile states requires a comprehensive understanding of local politics. Political economy and conflict analysis are increasingly used {{as a starting point}} for development and humanitarian strategies. Inclusive political settlements <b>to</b> conflict require <b>agreements</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>reached</b> between both elites and their constituencies. This process may be complicated not only by an interest in continuing conflict by particular groups and that the elites may be part of the reason for the conflicts initiative (for instance, by marginalising particular groups in their constituency), but also that key political leaders <b>are</b> necessary <b>to</b> ensure effective dialogue. Stabilisation is not a linear process from conflict to peace and rather represents a lengthy and extensive process that is characterised by power struggles and elite bargaining. Elections and the development of democratic institutions requires a lengthy process for the development of political parties and independent electoral commissions and international community expectations for quick wins or 'ideal' governance reforms must be accordingly tempered.|$|R

50|$|With {{collaborators}} Humberto Llavador and Joaquim Silvestre, Roemer has elaborated {{a formal}} theory of sustainability, which the authors {{apply to the}} problem of climate change (Llavador, Roemer, and Silvestre 2010 and 2011).

Roemer (2011) critiques the discounted utilitarian approach. In Llavador, Roemer, and Silvestre (2012) the authors propose how the bargaining problem between the global North and South can be resolved, over the allocation of rights to emit greenhouse gases. The proposal does not begin from an ethical position which postulates an a priori distribution of pollution rights to nations, but rather with a politically motivated postulate that the authors argue is necessary and sufficient for an <b>agreement</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>reached.</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} effect of supplier-retailer {{collaboration}} on logistical performance and transaction costs {{from the viewpoint of}} retail sector suppliers. The methodology consists of an empirical study conducted over nine months in the logistics department of a large Brazilian supermarket retailer and a survey of 125 representatives of 90 manufacturers. The results show collaboration contributes to an improvement in logistical performance related to urgent deliveries and deliveries that occur during periods of high demand. Interpersonal collaboration and joint actions contribute to the reduction of uncertainties among the participants. These joint actions, together with strategic collaboration, contribute to an increase in investment in specific assets, such as dedicated production lines or specialised vehicle fleets to serve partners. The study provides an analysis of logistical performance and transaction cost elements not previously investigated, including urgent deliveries and deliveries during periods of high demand, contract negotiation and renegotiation, waiting time for <b>agreements</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>reached,</b> contingency logistics planning, and various cultural, psychosocial and geographical aspects of the supplier-retailer relationship.

According to the government, the finance, defence, foreign affairs, and justice portfolios were to go to Kibaki's party, the PNU, while the ODM was to receive the roads, public works, tourism, and agriculture portfolios. Mutua said that Odinga had not submitted his list of proposed ministers to Kibaki, and he said that Kibaki had invited Odinga for talks on the morning of April 6,.

Many historical church buildings and other properties in Israel were either devastated in 1948 and {{not allowed to}} rebuild or seized by the Israeli government without being restored to the Catholic Church. In addition, Israel's character as a Jewish state and the prominent position given to Jewish Orthodox circles in social and state affairs, led to a policy of social discrimination against the local Catholic, part of them being Israeli Arabs, the others being members of mixed families who came to Israel under the Law of Return or even local Jews who converted within Israel. Article 10 of {{the agreement}} provided for a comprehensive <b>agreement</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>reached</b> in future negotiations {{under the auspices of}} the joint commission established in 1992. Fr. David-Maria A.

There was the hope-full expectation that magnanimity and trust on the part of the Church would call forth corresponding trust and magnanimity on the part of the other side. It was a courageously generous decision by the Servant of God Pope John Paul II, and I, for my part, continue to pray and hope that he will be proved to have been right all along.|$|E
