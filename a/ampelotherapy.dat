Although there is some limited evidence of positive benefits from the consumption of grapes for health purposes, extreme claims, such as its ability to cure cancer, have been widely derided as “quackery”.|$|E

Treatments offered have varied from a diet that consists of eating large quantities of grapes together with other food to those that involve consuming nothing but grapes. One recommended course of <b>ampelotherapy</b> has to last 1-2 months. It is recommended to eat 2 kilos of grapes with their seed three times per week. This intake should {{be accompanied by a}} diet that limits the intake of smoked meat, milk and all dairy products and alcohol. [...] The diet proposed by Johanna Brandt recommended fasting for two or three days, consuming only cold water, followed by a diet of only grapes and water for one to two weeks, with seven meals a day. Fresh fruits, tomatoes, and sour milk or cottage cheese are then introduced to the diet followed by raw vegetables.|$|E

In the USSR, {{the principles of the}} grape cure were developed in the 1920s by a group of physicians of the Semashko Institute (Yalta), headed by A.V. D’iakov. <b>Ampelotherapy</b> continues to be offered in health clinics and spas, particularly in Europe, together with vinotherapy, a cosmetic treatment that involves rubbing grapes into the skin. Johanna Brandt, a South African doctor, popularized the grape diet as a treatment for cancer from 1925. She published about twenty pamphlets on the subject of natural remedies for health problems with her best-known publication being The Grape Cure, which {{is said to have been}} written after Brandt had cured herself of stomach cancer by following the diet. The book was republished in 1989 as How to Conquer Cancer, Naturally, including an endorsement of Brandt’s work by Benedict Lust, who is commonly referred to as [...] "the father of naturopathy". The book may have been inspired by Arnold Ehret, a contemporary, who taught a Grape Cure course.|$|E
