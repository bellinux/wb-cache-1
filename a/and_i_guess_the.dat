2500|$|At {{the start}} of the 2015–16 season, Sutherland moved to the Queensland Fire, where she sought more {{opportunities}} to break into the Southern Stars team. [...] However, she also joined the Sydney Sixers squad for its inaugural WBBL01 season (2015–16). [...] Explaining her choice of WBBL club, she told The Daily Examiner, [...] "Sydney's a great city. The colour of the team helped <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> rest of the squad that we have was the major drawcard to play for the Sixers." [...] In June 2016, Sutherland injured her knee ligaments in a fall; the injury caused her to concentrate on her batting while she was recovering. [...] Despite that setback, she played for Queensland Fire in its last three matches of the 2016–17 WNCL competition, including the final, and was signed by Brisbane Heat for the WBBL02 season.|$|E
2500|$|In 1972, Bolland {{attended}} the British Comic Art Convention at the Waverley Hotel in London, and met [...] "a {{lot of the}} people who were key in the comics scene of the time," [...] including Dez Skinn, Nick Landau, Richard Burton, Angus McKie and – crucially – Dave Gibbons. Bolland and Gibbons became firm friends. After finishing his college course, Bolland was hit with [...] "the stark reality of unemployment" [...] and on the advice of Gibbons joined art agency Bardon Press Features. [...] "A few two-page strips" [...] for D.C. Thomson resulted, but Bolland would refer to this period as his [...] "lowest time." [...] Bardon did however produce a client called Pikin which was [...] "planning a bi-weekly comic about an African superhero," [...] Powerman, which was to be sold in Nigeria. Gibbons and Bolland were to draw alternate issues (Bolland's first issue was Powerman No. 2.), and Bolland recalls that [...] "soon Dave had drawn his entire story and I had produced just a few pages." [...] This knowledge – [...] "that Dave could produce a page a day... and that I was going to have to do the same" [...] – was a shock, but proved to be [...] "the very best kind of training ground." [...] With comics purportedly being new to Nigeria, Bolland recalls this work being created specifically to be [...] "really simple; six panels on a page and [...] the panels had to be numbered." [...] Not only was this work [...] "he best way to learn the simple rules of comic book storytelling," [...] but [...] "better still, it was going someplace where nobody I knew could see it." [...] He [...] "drew around 300 pages of that very straightforward, simple-to-follow work, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> storytelling flowed naturally from that." [...] Even so, he [...] "was always struggling to get the last eight or ten pages finished," [...] and was occasionally helped by friends, both from his [...] "Norwich School of Art days," [...] Gibbons and future-2000 AD and League of Extraordinary Gentlemen artist Kevin O'Neill.|$|E
60|$|DEAR MR. ROGERS,--Yours of Dec. 21 has arrived, {{containing}} the circular to stockholders <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> Co. will really quit--there doesn't {{seem to be}} any other wise course.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you don't}} I'll {{try not to}} cry over you," [...] she retorted; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> <b>the</b> madcap had made some wager with {{him that he could}} not leap the fence. Sally {{afterwards}} declared penitently that she never fancied he would attempt it; but I could see by the lad's face he meant to take the risk.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> why. <b>The</b> kind boy {{thinks it}} would make me unhappy. It wouldn't. But I know his ways; so <b>I</b> wait, <b>and</b> hope all will go well with him.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Now we’re {{going to}} find out where that picket is,” said Harper. “Those fellows are coming right here, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> by <b>the</b> noise they’re making they don’t belong to the Sin Verguenza.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not so fast." [...] The Kid smiled curiously. [...] "We ain't {{under way}} yet. When I go I'm going down river, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> chances are you'll go along." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Oh yes,” said Harper dryly as he sprang {{towards the}} door. “That’s quite simple, but the hint isn’t sent yet. A word from me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> Sin Verguenza {{would be left}} without a leader!” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{a week or}} two the canoes will be out," [...] Scott remarked. [...] "There's a {{big head}} of water coming down <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> jamb that's backing up the stream won't stand till morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dan Baxter won't come back," [...] {{answered}} Dick seriously. [...] "He {{ran away}} to Chicago with {{two hundred dollars}} belonging to his father, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> that's <b>the</b> end of him--so far as Putnam Hall and we are concerned. What a bully he was!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You see," [...] said Dorothy to the King, {{when the}} song ended, [...] "the rabbits {{all seem to}} like Bunnybury except you. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> you're <b>the</b> only one that ever has cried or was unhappy and {{wanted to get back}} to your muddy hole in the ground." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{means that}} Brother Gerrish thought Mr. Peck was hitting {{at him in}} that talk about the large commerce, and it means business," [...] said Putney. [...] "Brother Gerrish has made a {{beginning}}, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> it's <b>the</b> beginning of the end, unless we're all ready to take hold against him. What {{are you going to}} do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, so {{does the}} family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. But {{there is no such}} thing, sir, as a ghost, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> laws of Nature {{are not going to be}} {{suspended}} for the British aristocracy.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was {{a pretty}} close call. Snow blurred the lights, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> gale has broken a wire," [...] he said. [...] "Them folks never {{expected}} us, but they were smart with the switches. I'll say that for them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It won't hold any more, so I wouldn't {{worry about}} it. The toys are very red and yellow, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> babies won't know how cheap they are, but like {{them as much}} as if they cost heaps of money." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Well, ma'am,' says Emma, 'I can't say as I've got {{a passion}} for it. But it's {{one of those things}} that 'as to be done, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> I've learnt <b>the</b> trick.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> can <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> reason. You did {{not keep}} your word to me, though you knew how anxious I was to {{see you at the}} end of your {{fortnight}} at Kingston; and the reason is that you have something on your mind which you fear to tell me--which you are ashamed to tell." ...|$|R
5000|$|When {{interviewed by}} Alan Lomax in 1938, Morton {{recalled}} May as [...] "the greatest comedian he ever knew", describing him as [...] "a very, very swell fellow, {{over six feet}} tall, very slender with big liver lips, and light complexioned. His shoes were enormous and he wore trousers impossible to get over his feet without a shoe horn. He always had a big diamond in his front tooth. He was the first guy I ever saw with a diamond in his mouth, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess,</b> <b>I</b> got <b>the</b> idea for my diamond from him".|$|R
6000|$|... "No. I {{could tell}} you were talking, but that was all. Once you kind of raised your voice <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> fellow in front heard something, for it was then {{he got up and}} tried to crawl close in." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she said, [...] "they {{must have}} had their summer home there nearly twenty years. Lower Merritt {{was one of the}} first places opened up in that part of the mountains, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> Desmonds built the first cottage there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's a fact. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> hotel {{business}} feels it. That's {{one good}} thing, though: these hotels that've been charging five bucks a day--yes, and maybe six--seven!--for a rotten room {{are going to}} be darn glad to get four, and maybe give you a little service." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Right you are, John," [...] {{said the}} other; [...] "about the {{greatest}} victory we ever gained. It has settled the fleets of France <b>and</b> Spain, <b>I</b> <b>guess,</b> for <b>the</b> next fifty years." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah-ah--some great lord {{or another}} {{who has his}} day by candlelight, <b>and</b> so on. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> style. Somebody who no more knows how much bread is a loaf than I do the price of {{diamonds}} and pearls.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Paret," [...] he said suddenly, [...] "I don't care a {{damn about}} Grunewald--never did. I'd turn him down for ten cents. But you can tell Theodore Watling for me, <b>and</b> Dickinson, that <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> 'inducement' can be fixed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We'll {{let that}} slide. I don't like a fuss," [...] said Robertson, when I thanked him. [...] "Glad {{to do our}} best for you, Forty and me; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> Company haven't another machine short of the inter-ocean racers that would have brought you in the time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{meant to}} make my pile by selling the ore to somebody, but you treated me like a white man, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> lode belongs to you. Well, if I help you get rich {{and you want to}} give me something, I won't refuse, but I'm not out for money. Say, you'll let me go?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The man {{agreed that}} there was cause for complaint. 'I'll {{tell you what it}} is, sir,' he said. 'It was my boy Jim as trained this 'ere dawg, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> young beggar's taught 'im more about {{tackling}} rats than burglars. You leave 'im with me for a week, sir; I'll put that all right.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's <b>the</b> police lot, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> they'll want <b>the</b> grub," [...] he said. [...] "I can't quite figure why none of {{them have}} come in for it, but you could strike them for {{transport}} on anything you took along." ...|$|R
500|$|It was cool. It was {{a really}} nice session, she was really lovely. [...] <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> as <b>the</b> song ('Hold Tight') came out, her fans seem to respond it really well, so yeah, awesome! And she's a legend, and it's an awesome {{opportunity}} to work with someone like Madonna who's literally shaped the careers of so many artists that I've wanted to work with <b>and</b> that <b>I</b> look up to. She's the queen!.|$|R
50|$|As a child Wendy St. Kitts {{spent her}} summers in New York City where she {{eventually}} relocated {{and struggled to}} build her music career. Man, it was as tough as it should be. Selling sex was <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> is <b>the</b> thing to do, but that's just not me. So, like many others, I took the long, hard road of certified rejection and truly discovered who I was. Still the best thing I've ever done.|$|R
6000|$|... "Like to {{make you}} acquainted with Jedge Abner Parkinson, Mr. Wetherell, and Jim Irving. Jim's the sheriff of Truro County, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> jedge don't need any {{recommendation}} as a lawyer from me. You won't mind stayin' awhile with the jedge while Jim and I go down town with the team? You're both literary folks." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, all right," [...] said Fulkerson, with {{unabated}} joy. [...] "It's what I expected. Well, {{my course}} is clear; I shall stand by March, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> world won't {{come to an}} end if he bounces us both. But I'm everlastingly obliged to you, Colonel Woodburn, and I don't {{know what to say to}} you. I--I won't detain you now; it's so late. I'll see you in the morning. Good-ni--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{liked the}} man. He {{seemed to have}} a sense of humour. I felt sure that he, at least, was plumb straight. 'Sure, doc,' I said, 'I'm sorry about the tree, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> new bulbs will be on me. But perhaps you'd like to know what I was doing in your garden?' 'I think the facts do call for an explanation,' he replied. 'Well, to begin with, I wasn't after the spoons.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{could make}} a man of that fellow, if I had him in the {{business}} with me. There's stuff in him. But I spoke up the way I did because I didn't choose Irene should think I would stand {{any kind of a}} loafer 'round--I don't care who he is, or how well educated or brought up. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess,</b> from <b>the</b> way Pen spoke up, that 'Rene saw what I was driving at." ...|$|R
60|$|I saw Madonna Paola's eyes gleam with {{a sudden}} light of admiration, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> that in <b>the</b> matter of Giovanni's valour her {{opinions}} were undergoing the same change as the verses had caused them to undergo {{in the matter of}} his intellect.|$|R
60|$|We {{followed}} {{down the}} bank of the Thames after we came upon it. I was anxious to look with my own eyes upon <b>the</b> famous bridge, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guessed,</b> too, that <b>the</b> river would lead me into the part of London where stood Westminster Abbey and the Tower.|$|R
