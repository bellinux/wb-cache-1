500|$|Garrow's {{estate was}} valued at £22,000 {{after his death}} near Ramsgate, Kent, {{including}} £12,000 in the Bank of England, £5,000 in three insurance policies and £5,000 secured by mortgages – a total of £ in [...] terms. Garrow's will was written in 1830 and contained only two demands; {{to be buried in}} his birthplace, Hadley, with his uncle, his father's younger brother William (who had left Garrow the best part of his fortune), and to set up a trust. The trust contained his entire estate, with the trustees being Leonard Smith, a merchant, Edward Lowth Badeley of Paper Buildings, Inner Temple and William Nanson Lettsom of Gray's Inn. The money was divided between Joseph, Garrow's nephew, who received £1,000, £200 to each of the children of Garrow's sister, £2,000 to the sister and £300 a year to the widow of Garrow's son. Eliza, Garrow's daughter, received £300 a year from the interest on the trust, with an <b>additional</b> <b>provision</b> of £200 for the joint use of Eliza and her husband. The estate was structured by a legal professional, and as such no death duties were paid. The second instruction was ignored: Garrow was buried in the churchyard of St Laurence, [...] Ramsgate, his parish church.|$|E
2500|$|In January 1919, {{after the}} December 1918 general election, 73 of Ireland's 106 Members of Parliament (MPs) elected were Sinn Féin members {{who refused to}} take their seats in the British House of Commons. Instead, they set up an Irish {{parliament}} called Dáil Éireann. This first Dáil in January 1919 issued a Declaration of Independence and proclaimed an Irish Republic. The Declaration was mainly a restatement of the 1916 Proclamation with the <b>additional</b> <b>provision</b> that Ireland {{was no longer a}} part of the United Kingdom.

2500|$|The Airacuda {{was plagued}} with {{problems}} from the start. The lofty performance estimates were unobtainable as, despite its sleek looks, the Airacuda was heavy and was slower than most bombers. In {{the event of}} interception by enemy fighters, the Airacuda was not maneuverable enough to dogfight, while the meager [...] bombload was of little use in the intended fighter-bomber role. Even the 37mm cannons were of less value than predicted. The cannons {{had a tendency to}} fill the gun nacelles with smoke whenever fired and, additionally, fears persisted as to how the gunners would escape in an emergency, with the propellers directly behind them. An emergency bailout would have required both propellers to be feathered, though <b>additional</b> <b>provision</b> was made with the use of explosive bolts on the propellers to jettison them {{in the event of a}} bailout.|$|E
2500|$|In December 1998, state Representative John H. Rogers, a Democrat, {{proposed}} legislation to prevent Massachusetts from granting legal recognition to same-sex marriages established elsewhere: [...] "a purported marriage contracted between {{persons of the}} same sex shall be neither valid nor recognized in the Commonwealth." [...] In 1999, the Lesbian and Gay Political Alliance of Massachusetts called it a [...] "hate bill" [...] and a coalition of more than 150 religious leaders formed the Religious Coalition for the Freedom to Marry to oppose it. Others religious leaders organized in support of the measure. Rogers revised his proposal to define marriage as the union {{of a man and a}} woman when he offered it again in 2001, with the <b>additional</b> <b>provision</b> that [...] "Any other relationship shall not be recognized as a marriage, or its legal equivalent, or receive the benefits exclusive to marriage in the Commonwealth." [...] The chair of the Lesbian and Gay Political Alliance of Massachusetts said its prospects for passage were slim but it could serve as a countervailing proposal to efforts at establishing civil unions or providing benefits to same-sex partners of state and local government employees. Alongside these legislative maneuvers, GLAD filed a lawsuit in state court challenging the denial of marriage rights to same-sex couples in April 2001.|$|E
60|$|After {{some time}} I drew {{a bill for}} paving the city, and brought it into the Assembly. It was just before I went to England in 1757, and did not pass till I was gone, and then with an {{alteration}} {{in the mode of}} assessment which I thought not for the better, but with an <b>additional</b> <b>provision</b> for lighting as well as paving the streets, which was a great improvement. It was by a private person, the late Mr. John Clifton,--his giving a sample of the utility of lamps by placing one at his door,--that the people were first impressed with the idea of enlighting all the city. The honor of this public benefit has also been ascribed to me, but it belongs truly to that gentleman. I did but follow his example, and have only some merit to claim respecting the form of our lamps, as differing from the globe lamps we were at first supplied with from London. Those we found inconvenient in these respects: they admitted no air below; the smoke, therefore, did not readily go out above, but circulated in the globe, lodged on its inside, and soon obstructed the light they were intended to afford, giving, besides, the daily trouble of wiping them clean; and an accidental stroke on one of them would demolish it and render it totally useless. I therefore suggested the composing them of four flat panes, with a long funnel above to draw up the smoke, and crevices admitting air below to facilitate the ascent of the smoke. By this means they were kept clean, and did not grow dark in a few hours, as the London lamps do, but continued bright till morning, and an accidental stroke would generally break but a single pane, easily repaired.|$|E

60|$|Our city, though {{laid out}} with a {{beautiful}} regularity, the streets large, straight, and crossing each other at right angles, had the disgrace of suffering those streets to remain long unpaved, and in wet weather the wheels of heavy carriages ploughed them into a quagmire, {{so that it was}} difficult to cross them; and in dry weather the dust was offensive. I had lived near what was called the Jersey market, and saw, with pain, the inhabitants wading in mud while purchasing their provisions. A strip of ground down the middle of that market was at length paved with brick, so that, being once in the market, they had firm footing, but were often over their shoes in dirt to get there. By talking and writing on the subject, I was at length instrumental in getting the streets paved with stone between the market and the brick foot-pavement that was on the side next the houses. This for some time gave an easy access to the market dry shod; {{but the rest of the}} street not being paved, whenever a carriage came out of the mud upon this pavement, it shook off and left its dirt upon it, and it was soon covered with mire, which was not removed, the city as yet having no scavengers. After some inquiry I found a poor industrious man who was willing to undertake keeping the pavement clean, by sweeping it twice a week, carrying off the dirt from before all the neighbours' doors, for the sum of sixpence per month, to be paid by each house. I then wrote and printed a paper, setting forth the advantages to the neighbourhood that might be obtained from this small expense; the greater ease in keeping our houses clean, so much dirt not being brought in by people's feet; the benefit to the shops by more custom, as buyers could more easily get at them; and by not having, in windy weather, the dust blown in upon their goods, &c. I sent one of these papers to each house, and in a day or two went round to see who would subscribe to an agreement to pay these sixpences; it was unanimously signed, and, for a time, well executed. All the inhabitants of the city were delighted with the cleanliness of the pavement that surrounded the market, it being a convenience to all, and this raised a general desire to have all the streets paved, and made the people more willing to submit to a tax for that purpose. After some time I drew a bill for paving the city and brought it into the Assembly. It was just before I went to England, in 1757, and did not pass till I was gone, and then with an alteration in the mode of assessment, which I thought not for the better; but with an <b>additional</b> <b>provision</b> for lighting as well as paving the streets, which was a great improvement. It was by a private person, the late Mr. John Clifton, giving a sample of the utility of lamps, by placing one at his door, that the people were first impressed with the idea of lighting all the city. The honour of this public benefit has also been ascribed to me, but it belongs truly to that gentleman. I did but follow his example, and have only some merit to claim respecting the form of our lamps, as differing from the globe lamps we were at first supplied with from London. They were found inconvenient in these respects: they admitted no air below; the smoke, therefore, did not readily go out above, but circulated in the globe, lodged on its inside, and soon obstructed the light they were intended to afford; giving, besides, the daily trouble of wiping them clean: and an accidental stroke on one of them would demolish it, and render it totally useless. I therefore suggested the composing them of four flat panes, with a long funnel above to draw up the smoke, and crevices admitting air below to facilitate the ascent of the smoke; by this means they were kept clean, and did not grow dark in a few hours, as the London lamps do, but continued bright till morning; and an accidental stroke would generally break but a single pane, easily repaired. I have sometimes wondered that the Londoners did not, from the effect holes in the bottom of the globe-lamps used at Vauxhall have in keeping them clean, learn to have such holes in their street-lamps. But these holes being made for another purpose, viz., to communicate flame more suddenly to the wick by a little flax hanging down through them, the other use of letting in air seems not to have been thought of: and, therefore, after the lamps have been lit a few hours, the streets of London are very poorly illuminated.|$|E
