Many GoA 4 systems do have staff on trains and stations, but the key difference to GoA 3 is that the system is capable of operating without any members of staff present if necessary. This eases staff recruitment and rostering constraints [33], as well as making the system more resilient to industrial <b>action</b> <b>by</b> <b>trade</b> unions.|$|R

From the early 1980 s, in order to avoid massive labor struggles triggered by the reform of the labor system, the state began to actively promote preemptive <b>actions</b> <b>by</b> <b>trade</b> unions and actively intervene into labor disputes. This strategy of corporatism effectively prevented the cohesion of interests of the working class (Chan 1993). Grassroots-level trade unions directly intervened into mediation by developing mediation committees based on their established networks. To some extent, the regular operation of mediation committees also played a preventive role in the collective actions of workers. This article thus measures the coverage of mediation committees by the number of mediation committees inside enterprises averaged by employed urban population (unit: number per 10, 000 people). 8 [...]...|$|R

50|$|The Swiss Gemmological Institute SSEF is a gemmology {{laboratory}} {{located in}} Basel, Switzerland. It {{is a part}} of the Schweizerische Stiftung für Edelstein Forschung (SSEF, Swiss Foundation for Gemstone Research). It was founded on an independent basis, <b>by</b> <b>trade</b> <b>organisations,</b> in 1974. George Bosshart, mineralogist and GG was the first director after the laboratory's opening in Zürich. Diamond grading was the major task and colour stones were tested rather exceptionally. In 1980 Bosshart hired Dr. Henry A. Hänni, Mineralogist and FGA. In 1994 Hänni moved the laboratory to Basel. He has been teaching gemmology at Basel university, and the close link to the university proved to be very enriching for both parts, academic and laboratory work. Hänni became professor of gemmology at Basel University, also a reward for his years of steady research and supply of publications. Prof. H.A. Hänni retired in 2009 and Dr. Michael Krzemnicki took over his position as a director. Dr. Krzemnicki has been working for SSEF since 1999.SSEF has since long been offering its independent services to the global gemstone and jewellery trade. The mandate of the SSEF is to analyse precious stones and jewellery; issuing test reports for coloured gemstones, diamonds and pearls. Its forte lies in the detection of gemstone authenticity, origin, and gem treatments on a scientific and reproducible basis. It offers expert independent advice to a wide gemmological clientele including gem dealers, jewellers, auction houses and private customers in many countries. Gemmological training courses from basic to highly specialised are a further contribution to an international scholarship, ensuring a high level of gemmological knowledge and skills in the trade.|$|R

The Workplace Relations Act 1996 (WRA) represented a significant first step in this direction prior to the Liberal National coalition gaining control of the Senate in 2005. However, {{there has been no}} extensive workplace data of the kind produced by the Australian Workplace Relations Survey to take stock {{of the impact of the}} WRA.

It compares data for trade unions, employer associations, forms of employee participation, workplace reductions, industrial disputes and payment systems from the Illawarra Regional Workplace Industrial Relations Survey 1996 with a further survey in 2004. It concludes that while the WRA did impact on the region, the Illawarra nevertheless maintained a distinctive pattern of industrial relations in which the New South Wales State system was more influential. If this provides any indication of the wider impact of the WRA, it offers strong reasons as to why the government proceeded with Work Choices. 27 page(s...|$|R

The Operational Guidelines identify possible actions, tools and mechanisms to translate the Principles into practice. They will also pave the way for more effective monitoring and evaluation practices. Finally, the Principles and Guidelines will also serve as a tool to raise awareness amongst external players about the identity, dynamics and role of trade unions as actors in development.
