In the former, a spectacular succession of marls laid in the Apennine foredeep is exposed which, however, are unfortunately unsuitable for magnetostratigraphic analyses. The latter, which is represented by a shallowing-upward succession that developed in an outer-shelf environment, has the bonus of a sharp biomagnetostratigraphic record, which provides tighter <b>age</b> <b>control.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{demand for}} Internet {{services}} that require frequent updates through small messages, such as microblogging, has tremendously {{grown in the}} past few years. Although the use of such applications by domestic users is usually free, their access from mobile devices is subject to fees and consumes energy from limited batteries. If a user activates his mobile device and is in range of a service provider, a content update is received at the expense of monetary and energy costs. Thus, users face a tradeoff between such costs and their messages aging. The goal {{of this paper is to}} show how to cope with such a tradeoff, by devising <b>aging</b> <b>control</b> policies. An <b>aging</b> <b>control</b> policy consists of deciding, based on the current utility of the last message received, whether to activate the mobile device, and if so, which technology to use (WiFi or 3 G). We present a model that yields the optimal <b>aging</b> <b>control</b> policy. Our model is based on a Markov Decision Process in which states correspond to message ages. Using our model, we show the existence of an optimal strategy in the class of threshold strategies, wherein users activate their mobile devices if the age of their messages surpasses a given threshold and remain inactive otherwise. We then consider strategic content providers (publishers) that offer bonus packages to users, so as to incent them to download updates of advertisement campaigns. We provide simple algorithms for publishers to determine optimal bonus levels, leveraging the fact that users adopt their optimal <b>aging</b> <b>control</b> strategies.

Paleoceanographic reconstructions of the Late Cretaceous and early Cenozoic require enhanced geographic coverage, particularly in the Pacific, in order to better constrain meridional variations in environmental conditions. The challenge with the existing inventory of Pacific deep-sea cores is that they consist almost exclusively of pelagic clay with little existing <b>age</b> <b>control.</b> Recent work indicates that seawater Osmium (Os) isotope analyses provide useful <b>age</b> <b>control</b> for red clay sequences due to its relatively long residence time compared to oceanic mixing. The drawback to using seawater Os isotope stratigraphy to date Paleogene age sediments is that the compilation of existing data has some significant temporal gaps, notably between ~ 38 and 55 million years ago (Ma).
