5|$|The {{public image}} of homosexuals changed with liberalized social {{attitudes of the}} late 1960s. In 1969, the Stonewall riots {{occurred}} in New York City, marking {{the start of the}} gay rights movement. Though gay life in Miami was intensely closeted, and bars were subject to frequent raids, Christ Metropolitan Community Church—a congregation for gay and lesbian Christians in Miami—was founded in 1970 as a religious outlet, attracting hundreds of parishioners. The 1972 Democratic National Convention was held in Miami, featuring, for the first time, a public speech about the rights of gay men <b>and</b> <b>lesbians</b> by openly gay San Francisco political activist Jim Foster. Jack Campbell opened the Miami branch of Club Baths in 1974. When it was raided, he made sure that all charges against those arrested were dropped, filed a lawsuit against the Miami Police Department prohibiting further harassment, and received a formal apology from the police. Even the depiction of gay men <b>and</b> <b>lesbians</b> in the local newspaper had changed to that of a silent, oppressed minority. By 1977, Miami was one of nearly 40cities in the U.S. that had passed ordinances outlawing discrimination against gay men <b>and</b> <b>lesbians.</b>|$|E

40|$|As {{the number}} of {{same-sex}} parents creating families and raising children rises, the stigma surrounding parent-child sex communication (PCSC) remains constant. Parents serve {{as one of the}} primary sources of information regarding sex and sexuality to their children; however, gay <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> parent-child sex communication remains largely unstudied. Framed within grounded theory, the primary goal {{of this study is to}} investigate how gay <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> parents navigate <b>and</b> enact parent-child sex communication with their children. Through 22 in-depth interviews with gay <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> parents who have directly communicated about sex and sexuality with their children, the following four research questions were addressed: 1) How do same-sex parents understand and enact PCSC? 2) What topics and discourses are inherent within gay <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> parent PCSC? 3) How, if at all, do gay <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> parents discuss sexual orientation during PCSC? 4) How, if at all, do gay <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> parents converse with each other in preparation for PCSC? Participants discussed their experiences engaging in and enacting PCSC with their children providing a unique standpoint in gay <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> specific PCSC. Discussion of the findings are discussed in relation to the similarities of gay <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> specific PCSC <b>and</b> extant literature regarding heterosexual parent PCSC, the unique experiences of gay <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> parents during PCSC, and finally how gay <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> parent PCSC can further inform all PCSC research. Directions for future research are also addressed. ...|$|R

5|$|Due to the {{intensely}} closeted {{nature of}} Miami's gay community at that time, many voters {{who were not}} swayed by Bryant's rhetoric were persuaded instead by her campaign's point that the law was unnecessary; {{they were unable to}} see the problem of discrimination. Unlike blacks or Cubans, gay men <b>and</b> <b>lesbians</b> were able to find jobs, although they faced dismissal upon their supervisors learning of their sexual orientation. In order to see a complaint through, they would have to remain out, and many lived in constant fear of exposure. Since the advent of second wave feminism earlier in the decade, many lesbians in the U.S. were unable to see themselves as part of the same community with gay men. Accusations from Save Our Children were almost all directed at the behavior of men. As a result, much of the response by gay men was angry and many lesbians took issue with the misogynistic tone gay men used. However, with Bryant representing a common adversary, {{for the first time in}} years, gay men <b>and</b> <b>lesbians</b> united to work together on the campaign.|$|E

5|$|Lesbian {{consciousness}} {{began in}} Nicaragua in 1986, when the Sandinista National Liberation Front expelled gay men <b>and</b> <b>lesbians</b> from its midst. State persecution prevented {{the formation of}} associations until AIDS became a concern, when educational efforts forced sexual minorities to band together. The first lesbian organization was Nosotras, founded in 1989. An effort to promote visibility from 1991 to 1992 provoked the government to declare homosexuality illegal in 1994, effectively ending the movement, until 2004, when Grupo Safo– Grupo de Mujeres Lesbianas de Nicaragua was created, four years before homosexuality became legal again.|$|E
5|$|After the elation {{of change}} {{following}} group {{action in the}} 1969 Stonewall riots in New York City, in the late 1970s and the early 1980s, some gays <b>and</b> <b>lesbians</b> became less accepting of bisexual or transgender people. Critics said that transgender people were acting out stereotypes and bisexuals were simply gay men or lesbian women who were afraid {{to come out and}} be honest about their identity. Each community has struggled to develop its own identity including whether, and how, to align with other gender and sexuality-based communities, at times excluding other subgroups; these conflicts continue to this day. LGBTQ activists and artists have created posters to raise consciousness about the issue since the movement began.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s, {{literature}} {{began to}} emerge which examined information seeking behaviors of gay <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> library patrons.

In 1988, the Task Force on Gay Liberation released the “International thesaurus of gay <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> index terms,” aimed at standardizing terms used for cataloging gay and lesbian-related library materials, and making Library of Congress Subject Headings friendlier for use by gay <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> archives.|$|R

5|$|Australia allows gay men <b>and</b> <b>lesbians</b> {{to serve}} openly. Openly {{gay and lesbian}} {{personnel}} were banned from the ADF until November 1992 when the Australian Government decided to remove this prohibition. The heads of the services and most military personnel opposed this change at the time, and it caused considerable public debate. Opponents of lifting the ban on gay and lesbian personnel argued that doing so would greatly harm the ADF's cohesiveness and cause large numbers of resignations. This did not eventuate, and the reform caused relatively few problems. A 2000 study found that lifting the ban on gay service {{did not have any}} negative effects on the ADF's morale, effectiveness or recruitment and retention, and may have led to increased productivity and improved working environments.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1960s, {{explicit}} sexuality of {{any kind}} was rare in speculative fiction, as the editors who controlled what was published attempted to protect their perceived key market of adolescent male readers. As the readership broadened, it became possible to include characters who were undisguised homosexuals, though these tended to be villains, <b>and</b> <b>lesbians</b> remained almost entirely unrepresented. In the 1960s, science fiction and fantasy began to reflect the changes prompted by {{the civil rights movement}} and the emergence of a counterculture. New wave and feminist science fiction authors realised cultures in which homosexuality, bisexuality and a variety of gender models were the norm, and in which sympathetic depictions of alternative sexuality were commonplace.|$|E
5|$|Gay men <b>and</b> <b>lesbians</b> came {{together}} to work in grassroots political organizations responding to organized resistance in 1977. A coalition of conservatives named Save Our Children staged a campaign to repeal a civil rights ordinance in Dade County, Florida. Save Our Children was successful enough to influence similar repeals in several American cities in 1978. However, the same year a campaign in California called the Briggs Initiative, designed to force the dismissal of homosexual public school employees, was defeated. Reaction {{to the influence of}} Save Our Children and the Briggs Initiative in the gay community was so significant that it has been called the second Stonewall for many activists, marking their initiation into political participation.|$|E

5|$|Homosexuals in Miami {{were not}} well-connected or {{experienced}} enough {{to combat the}} coalition led by Bryant, so they invited two political organizers to the city: Ethan Geto from New York City and Jim Foster from San Francisco, {{both of whom were}} gay. Foster and Geto faced battles not only with the Save Our Children campaign, but the disjointed and often closeted gay community in Miami. When organizations outside of Florida promoted boycotting Florida orange juice, Jack Campbell disagreed, worried that an economic backlash in the state would work against local gay men <b>and</b> <b>lesbians.</b> Ruth Shack saw the issue simply, as one of civil rights; Geto and Foster agreed. Bob Kunst soon broke away from the campaign to promote the orange juice boycott, and his views were often printed in the newspapers to Geto's alarm.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, the American Psychiatric Association listed {{homosexuality}} in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) as {{a mental}} disorder. A large-scale study of homosexuality in 1962 {{was used to}} justify inclusion of the disorder as a supposed pathological hidden fear {{of the opposite sex}} caused by traumatic parent–child relationships. This view was widely influential in the medical profession. In 1956, however, the psychologist Evelyn Hooker performed a study that compared the happiness and well-adjusted nature of self-identified homosexual men with heterosexual men and found no difference. Her study stunned the medical community and made her a hero to many gay men <b>and</b> <b>lesbians,</b> but homosexuality remained in the DSM until 1973.|$|E
5|$|Since medical {{literature}} began to describe homosexuality, {{it has often}} been approached from a view that sought to find an inherent psychopathology as the root cause, influenced by the theories of Sigmund Freud. Although he considered bisexuality inherent in all people, and said that most have phases of homosexual attraction or experimentation, exclusive same-sex attraction he attributed to stunted development resulting from trauma or parental conflicts. Much literature on mental health <b>and</b> <b>lesbians</b> centered on their depression, substance abuse, and suicide. Although these issues exist among lesbians, discussion about their causes shifted after homosexuality was removed from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual in 1973. Instead, social ostracism, legal discrimination, internalization of negative stereotypes, and limited support structures indicate factors homosexuals face in Western societies that often adversely affect their mental health.|$|E
