25|$|The Drillers {{success was}} {{noted by the}} league, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> time for the annual All-Star game both Pat Onstad and coach Ongaro were {{selected}} to represent the club. Onstad later withdrew due to injury, and in his stead, Chris Handsor went. As the season progressed, their winning ways continued, and with only two games remaining (both home contests against the St. Louis Ambush), the Drillers needed only one win to clinch the conference title.|$|E

After extensive lobbying from Gregoire, House Democratic and Republican leadership met and agreed to let the measure come up for a vote.

25|$|When I was a kid, {{my father}} told me about an {{accident}} that happened while he was working on Grand Coulee Dam in Washington. (At the time, Grand Coulee Dam was the world’s largest dam.) One day, a crane operator failed to see him, swung a quarter-ton bucket of wet concrete into his side, and knocked him off the dam. He managed to reach around in midair, grabbed the bottom rim of the bucket, swung out with it, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> back in dropped into the middle of a patch of fresh concrete.|$|E

25|$|It {{is strange}} {{to look back}} and see how this frail-looking young man burst on the scene in 1953. We had sent Ken Joy, the former BBAR, to {{challenge}} for the Grand Prix des Nations, then 140 kilometres long, and dragging through the hills of the Chevreuse valley. All over Paris they talked about this burly Englishman who had ridden 160km in 4 hours and 6 minutes: <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> to it, he was hammered by a 19-year-old, but a teenager with a will of iron that was to prove inflexible for the next 19 years.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, Peled—member of the Left Camp of Israel Executive {{for the whole}} of the party's six years of existence, though he never held a public office on its behalf—claimed that the Palestinian leadership, {{representing}} its entire people, could not be expected to make in a dialogue with radical Israeli dissidents the kind of concessions that would undermine its negotiating position if <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> to negotiate with the Government of Israel. (Which, with Menachem Begin as Israel's PM at the time, and Ariel Sharon as Defence Minister, seemed a very distant possibility). In effect, the ICIPP—with Peled and Avnery at its head—became a faction within the Left Camp of Israel, embroiled in constant internecine struggle with the opposing faction.|$|E
25|$|Exxon {{recovered}} {{a significant portion}} of clean-up and legal expenses through insurance claims associated with the grounding of the Exxon Valdez. Also, in 1991, Exxon made a quiet, separate financial settlement of damages with a group of seafood producers known as the Seattle Seven for the disaster's effect on the Alaskan seafood industry. The agreement granted $63.75million to the Seattle Seven, but stipulated that the seafood companies would have to repay almost all of any punitive damages awarded in other civil proceedings. The $5billion in punitive damages was awarded later, and the Seattle Seven's share could have been as high as $750million if the damages award had held. Other plaintiffs have objected to this secret arrangement, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> to light, Judge Holland ruled that Exxon should have told the jury at the start that an agreement had already been made, so the jury would know exactly how much Exxon would have to pay.|$|E

[...] Vernon attended Central Memorial High School and Henry Wise Wood Senior High School. He was always a goaltender, often joining his father for practices by the age of 4 and always focusing on the goaltenders. [...] He considered his mother, Lorraine, his first coach and claimed his introduction to goaltending came from his family: [...] "I had three brothers <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> time to play hockey, they always said the same thing: 'Get Mikey, he'll play net.'" ...|$|E

They actually counted the kills! <b>And</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> time for the taking-of-the-courtyard scene, that was just carnage." [...] He added, [...] "It really wasn't that well plotted. We just got sent zombies towards us and we had to improvise stabbing, so it was a bit touch-and-go from time to time." ...|$|E

500|$|The first-round {{series against}} the Magic was touted as the matchup {{between two of the}} league's best young big men in Bosh and Dwight Howard. Howard {{dominated}} throughout the series, while Bosh had a serires-best effort in Game 4 with 39 points and 15 rebounds. General Manager Bryan Colangelo said at a press conference after the series, [...] "Whether it's protecting [...] inside the paint, getting {{a little bit more of}} a presence in there, to just getting him another scorer that's going to shoulder some of that burden, it's something that's clear we have to get better", hinting that the roster was in need of an overhaul. Bosh said after the loss, [...] "They played a great series, they executed on offence and defense better than we did <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> to the small things, they did a better job... I can't sit here and bark in protest that the better team didn't win. That's pretty obvious. They beat us pretty good." [...] Unlike the previous campaign, Bosh was not named to any of the All-NBA teams.|$|E
500|$|The Rokeby Venus {{was long}} {{held to be}} one of Velázquez's final works. In 1951, it was found {{recorded}} in an inventory of 1 June 1651 from the collection of Gaspar Méndez de Haro, 7th Marquis of Carpio, a close associate of Philip IV of Spain. Haro was the great-nephew of Velázquez's first patron, the Count-Duke of Olivares, and a notorious libertine. According to the art historian Dawson Carr, Haro [...] "loved paintings almost as much as he loved women", and [...] "even his panegyrists lamented his excessive taste for lower-class women during his youth". For these reasons it seemed likely that he would have commissioned the painting. However, in 2001 the art historian Ángel Aterido discovered that the painting had first belonged to the Madrid art dealer and painter Domingo Guerra Coronel, and was sold to Haro in 1652 following Coronel's death the previous year. Coronel's ownership of the painting raises a number of questions: how <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> into Coronel's possession, and why Velázquez's name was omitted from Coronel's inventory. The art critic Javier Portús has suggested that the omission may have been due to the painting's portrayal of a female nude, [...] "a type of work which was carefully supervised and whose dissemination was considered problematic".|$|E
500|$|The deluxe {{version of}} Rebel Heart {{begins with the}} track [...] "Best Night", an 80s electro {{composition}} reminiscent of Sade's songs with drums and Indian flute instrumentation. Madonna begins the song with the line, [...] "You can call me M tonight" [...] but her voice is not discernible in the chorus, only in the harmonies. There is another reference to [...] "Justify My Love" [...] {{at one point during}} the intermediate bridge."Veni Vidi Vici" [...] appears next, and is a rap [...] "origin story song" [...] with its lyrics built around Madonna's songs: [...] "I expressed myself, came like a virgin down the aisle / Exposed my naked ass, and I did it with a smile / <b>And</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> to sex, I knew I walked the Borderline / and when I struck a pose, all the gay boys lost their minds". Madonna sings the chorus over simple guitar beats, uttering [...] "I came, I saw, I conquered", the English translation of the song's title. Nas appears for a guest verse talking about his own life as Diplo backs it with shotgun and crunching horn sounds. [...] "S.E.X." [...] is the next track where Madonna asks sarcastically [...] "tell me what you know about sex" [...] over sounds of bass, synths and a string arpeggio. Near the end she lists a number of bondage items like: [...] "Twisted rope, handcuffs, blindfold, string of pearls". Described as both an embodiment and critique of act, [...] "S.E.X." [...] talks about the lack of intimacy with Madonna rapping in a [...] "dispassionate" [...] voice; she purposely made it sound like she had a lisp in her articulation of the words.|$|E

Luke Roberts explained of the plot: [...] "The brothers both went to medical school. Harry was naturally gifted but drank it all away. <b>And</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> down to taking his exams he couldn't face the pressure and took an overdose. Harry called Joseph, but his brother didn't answer the phone." [...] By the time Anne-Marie returns from Paris, Harry has deteriorated further, and is in cardiac arrest when she arrives at his bedside.
