5|$|A {{tropical}} storm watch was issued at 0900UTC for the southwestern peninsula of Haiti from Port-au-Prince to the Dominican border. This advisory was upgraded {{the next morning}} to a {{tropical storm}} warning and a hurricane watch, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>night</b> was further upgraded to a hurricane warning. The Haitian coastal authority advised all small craft to stay in port, while at Port-au-Prince, all flights to southern Haiti from Toussaint Louverture International Airport were canceled. More than 1,000people were evacuated from low-lying areas and workers from World Vision again pre-positioned relief supplies.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of World War I, Körös was based at Zemun, just {{upstream}} from Belgrade on the Danube. Her commander was Linienschiffsleutnant (LSL) Josef Meusburger, and she was accompanied by another three monitors and three patrol boats. Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia on 28 July 1914, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>night</b> the flotilla fired the first shots of the war against fortifications at the Zemun–Belgrade railway bridge over the river Sava and on the Topčider Hill, although Körös was not initially involved. The Serbs were outgunned by the monitors, and by August began to receive assistance from the Russians. This support included the supply and emplacement of naval guns {{and the establishment of}} river obstacles and mines.|$|E

5|$|British forces {{landed at}} Calvi on 19 June, and {{immediately}} began moving guns ashore {{to occupy the}} heights surrounding the town. While Nelson directed a continuous bombardment of the enemy positions, Stuart's men began to advance. On 12 July Nelson was {{at one of the}} forward batteries early in the morning when a shot struck one of the sandbags protecting the position, spraying stones and sand. Nelson was struck by debris in his right eye and was forced to retire from the position, although his wound was soon bandaged and he returned to action. By 18 July most of the enemy positions had been disabled, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>night</b> Stuart, supported by Nelson, stormed the main defensive position and captured it. Repositioning their guns, the British brought Calvi under constant bombardment, and the town surrendered on 10 August. However, Nelson's right eye had been irreparably damaged and he eventually lost all sight in it.|$|E

5|$|Receiving {{the name}} Able, the small {{hurricane}} {{turned to the}} southeast and to the east while passing near or over the Bahama Banks. Able subsequently turned to the northeast and later to the north, and finished executing its cyclonic loop on May 20. The hurricane continued to intensify with an eye 20miles (32km) in diameter, and on May 21 Reconnaissance Aircraft estimated the hurricane attained peak winds of 90mph (150km/h). Shortly thereafter Able passed about 70miles (110km) east of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, and early on May 22 Able weakened from its peak intensity after turning to the east. On May 23 it deteriorated into a tropical storm while passing over cooler waters, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>night</b> Able became an extratropical cyclone while located about 520miles (840km) south of Halifax, Nova Scotia. The extratropical remnant turned to the northeast before losing its identity late on May 24.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{entering}} the western North Pacific Ocean, tropical cyclone warning duties {{transferred from the}} CPHC to the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), and the JMA first assessed Paka as a 65km (40mph) storm. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) unofficially assumed warning duties for interests in the United States Department of Defense. Paka continued to intensify after crossing the date line, and from late on December 7 through early the following day it remained a strong tropical storm. However, upper-level wind shear increased, and it again weakened. At 1200UTC on December 9, the JTWC assessed Paka as an 85km/h (50mph) tropical storm and forecast it to continue weakening. By December 10, the shear had begun to decrease as the storm moved through the Marshall Islands, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>night</b> the JTWC upgraded Paka to typhoon status. Paka officially attained typhoon status when JMA classified it with winds of 120km/h (75mph) at 0000UTC on December 11.|$|E
5|$|A {{delegation}} of landowners presented the ORD Real Estate Branch with a petition protesting {{the acquisition of}} their property on 23 November 1942, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>night</b> over 200 landowners held a meeting at which they agreed to hire lawyers and appraisers to challenge the Federal government. Local newspapers and politicians were sympathetic to their cause. By the end of May 1943, agreements were reached covering 416 tracts totaling , but some landowners rejected the government's offers. The ORD Real Estate Branch invoked a procedure under Tennessee law that allowed for a jury of five citizens appointed by the Federal District Court to review the compensation offered. They handled five cases in which they proposed higher values {{than those of the}} ORD appraisers, but the landowners rejected them as well, so the Army discontinued the use of this method. In response to rising public criticism, O'Brien commissioned a review by the Department of Agriculture. It found that the appraisals had been fair and just, and that farmers had overestimated the size and productivity of their land.|$|E
5|$|Rochester's constable in 1264, Roger de Leybourne, {{held the}} castle {{in support of}} Henry. John de Warenne, Earl of Surrey, was the garrison's co-commander. A baronial army led by Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Hertford, laid siege to the castle on 17 April that year. Having marched from the earl's castle to Tonbridge the army {{attacked}} from the Rochester side of the river, either the south or west. While the army advanced towards the city the royalist garrison set alight the suburbs. The king's hall within the castle was also burned down, although it is unclear why. An army under Simon de Montfort marched from London {{with the intention of}} attacking the city from another direction. The earl's first two attempts to cross the Medway were fought back, but he was successful on 18April, Good Friday. The method used is uncertain, although it involved a fire-ship. The smoke may have been used as cover for the rebels, or the ship may have been used to burn the bridge while the army travelled by water. In a co-ordinated attack that had been pre-arranged, the armies of de Montfort and de Clare attacked the city. They entered Rochester in the evening <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>night</b> the cathedral was raided. The following day the rebels captured the castle's outer enclosure and the royal garrison retreated to the keep. Because the next day was Easter Sunday there was no fighting, though hostilities resumed on the Monday. Siege engines were set up and targeted the keep. As in 1215 the keep proved resistant to missiles, and after a week had not succumbed. According to one contemporary source, the besiegers were about to dig a mine beneath the tower, but the siege was abandoned on 26April when the earls received news of a relief force led by HenryIII and his son, Prince Edward.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, McKean led {{the effort}} in the General Assembly of Delaware to declare its {{separation}} from the British government, which it did on June 15, 1776.

Upon hearing of it, McKean made the long ride to Dover, Delaware from Philadelphia in a single day, went to a room in an Inn, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>night,</b> virtually by himself, drafted the document. It was adopted September 20, 1776. The Delaware Constitution of 1776 became the first state constitution to be produced after the Declaration of Independence.|$|E
25|$|Fighting {{continued}} {{throughout the}} day <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>night,</b> the Germans withdrew from the north-west corner of Delville Wood and northern Longueval to enable their artillery to bombard the entire Wood and village. This withdrawal allowed the 1st South African Regiment to push northwards and to link up with the 76th Brigade (3rd Division), which was similarly advancing on Longueval. The junction did not last long; at 08h00 on 18 July the German artillery commenced firing on Delville Wood again, but this time from three sides and the bombardment endured for seven-and-a-half hours. At times the incidence of explosions was seven per second. On that day, in an area less than one square mile, 20 000 shells fell.|$|E

Seeing this as an {{opportunity}} to use Robespierre to free Marie, Harry agrees to be his secretary. After several months he discovers that Marie is soon to be tried and executed, and that Louise and the girls are under suspicion. He asks Robespierre to free Marie as repayment of his debt, but Robespierre refuses. Soon after, Lebat asks Robespierre to free Marie, as she has agreed to marry him and he knows that she is a friend of the Revolution.

25|$|On 7 September, the {{government}} issued {{a warning that}} the invasion could be expected {{within the next few}} days <b>and,</b> <b>that</b> <b>night,</b> Bomber Command attacked the Channel ports and supply dumps. On 13 September, they carried out another large raid on the Channel ports, sinking 80 large barges in the port of Ostend. 84 barges were sunk in Dunkirk after another raid on 17 September and by 19 September, almost 200 barges had been sunk. The loss of these barges may have contributed to Hitler's decision to postpone Operation Sea Lion indefinitely. The success of these raids was in part because the Germans had few Freya radar stations set up in France, so that air defences of the French harbours were not nearly as good as the air defences over Germany; Bomber Command had directed some 60% of its strength against the Channel ports.|$|E
