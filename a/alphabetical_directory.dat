5000|$|... "Ace" [...] and [...] "Acme" [...] {{were popular}} in company names as {{positioning}} words in <b>alphabetical</b> <b>directories.</b> They were generic, laudatory of whatever products {{they were used}} to promote and appeared at the beginning of most alpha-sorted lists. The Acme Corporation of cartoon fame is one placeholder example. (Acme is a regular English word from the Greek akme meaning summit, highest point, extremity or peak, and thus sometimes used for [...] "best".) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{number of}} {{subscribers}} increased exponentially after the Second World War (reaching 5.7 million by March 1952 for example). London’s telephone directories were split (initially into 2 books in 1931: A-K and L-Z) and eventually into four (A-D, E-K, L-R and S-Z) in the 1940s. From the 1970 issue onwards, Manchester {{was the only}} other UK urban area which, owing to the large number of subscribers, also required a split into two separate directories (A-K and L-Z, pictured, 1975 editions). Due to the huge print run and cost of production, the split was discontinued in 1977 with the first appearance of the 'Manchester Central' edition. Over the next 18 months Greater Manchester was divided up geographically - into 'Manchester North East', 'Manchester North West' and 'Manchester South'), so that split <b>alphabetical</b> <b>directories</b> were no longer required and each was more relevant to its local area. Design consultants Wolff Olins were appointed in 1983 to re-design the UK’s phone directories using type which took up less space and therefore less paper, ink, weight in transportation etc. The first revised look directory (called “The Phone Book”) was produced for ‘Central Manchester’ in March 1984.|$|R
5000|$|By default Robocopy outputs to {{the screen}} (or {{optionally}} to a log file) all the directories it encounters (in <b>alphabetical</b> order). Each <b>directory</b> is preceded {{by the number of}} files in that directory that fulfill the criteria for being copied. If the directory does not yet exist in the target, it is marked [...] "New Dir". But if the directory is empty and the /E option is not used, or it contains no files meeting the criteria, a new directory should not actually be created.|$|R

These rented offices were burnt down {{along with a few}} shops and the Bank of NSW on Christmas morning 1914 It must have been a significant set back at 69 to have lost all his professional equipment in this fire. He seems to have been well regarded there and played a significant role the mining affairs of the town. In 1915 he {{was operating}} mining leases around Ardlethan and Narian. The 1917 Sands Country <b>Alphabetical</b> <b>Directory</b> lists W. C. Wall as a Mining Agent at Ardlethan, NSW (80 km east of Griffith). Two years later in 1919 Wall was at North Yalgogrin, NSW (35 Km west of West Wyalong where gold was first discovered in 1893 on Robert Payne's selection 2 Km east of the township) mining gold and processing his ore at the Yalgogrin stamper battery.

5000|$|Little else {{is known}} {{about the history of the}} land around Monsildale until May 1871, when James Steven applied to select a {{homestead}} under the Crown Lands Alienation Act 1868. James Steven is not listed in the 1868 Queensland <b>Alphabetical</b> Post Office <b>Directory,</b> nor is he listed under the Squatters or Cattle Graziers sections in the 1874 or 1876 Trades Directories. However, Monsildale is listed under [...] "Stations" [...] in the 1878 to 1879 Trades Directory as being run by Swanson and Steven. Alexander Swanson apparently selected Portion 43, some distance to the south of Monsildale homestead, in partnership with James Steven in 1877.|$|R
5000|$|In 1978 France Télécom, the country's PTT, began {{designing}} the Minitel network. By distributing terminals that could access a nationwide electronic directory of telephone and address information, it hoped to increase {{use of the}} country's 23 million phone lines, and reduce the costs of printing printed phone books and employing directory assistance personnel. Millions of terminals were lent for free to telephone subscribers, resulting in a high penetration rate among businesses and the public. In exchange for the terminal, the possessors of Minitel would not be given free [...] "white page" [...] printed <b>directories</b> (<b>alphabetical</b> list of residents and firms), but only the yellow pages (classified commercial listings, with advertisements); the white pages were accessible for free on Minitel, {{and they could be}} searched by a reasonably intelligent search engine; much faster than flipping through a paper directory.|$|R
