40|$|Flow induces {{anisotropy}} in polymeric liquid crystals. This can {{be demonstrated}} by comparing the stress transients during a sudden increase in shear rate with those during flow reversal: the damped oscillations of the shear stress resulting from these two experiments are shifted by nearly 180 -degrees. Flow-induced anisotropy decays after the flow stops. Its evolution in time is followed by stress growth experiments in the flow direction and in the opposite one, with systematic changes in the rest period. The phase shift only disappears after several thousands of seconds. This time is much longer than the time necessary for the shear stress to relax. Other rheological characteristics, such as the variation of the dynamic moduli after stopping the flow, occur on the same time scale as the anisotropy decay. The anisotropy decay is not affected by temperature and consequently viscosity can be ruled out as a governing factor.

40|$|In {{this second}} paper, we develop {{transferable}} semi-empirical parameters for the technologically important material, silicon, using Extended Huckel Theory (EHT) to calculate its electronic structure. The EHT-parameters areoptimized to experimental target {{values of the}} band dispersion of bulk-silicon. We obtain a very good quantitative match to the bandstructure characteristics such as bandedges and effective masses, which are competitive with the values obtained within an sp^ 3 d^ 5 s^* orthogonal-tight binding model for silicon. The transferability of the parameters is investigated applying them to different physical and chemical environments by calculating the bandstructure of two reconstructed surfaces with different orientations: Si(100) (2 x 1) and Si(111) (2 x 1). The reproduced π- and π^*-surface bands <b>agree</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> quantitatively with DFT-GW calculations and PES/IPES experiments demonstrating their robustness to environmental changes.

The sequence {{from the western}} part of the former Solent river system is one of the longest in Britain, with 18 mapped terrace aggradations. A set of 23 optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dates aim to provide dated tie-points within the lower part of the sequence at five stratotype locations. These dates are replicated at single sites, providing age estimates for fewer members, but increasing the reliability for those members that have been dated. The results provide two reliably dated tie-points within the sequence and suggest that (i) the lowest six terrace aggradations all postdate ca. 275 [*]kyr (MIS 8), (ii) terraces may have aggraded during cold phases within the penultimate interglacial (MIS 7) and (iii) the interglacial deposits at Stone Point whose age has previously been contested are likely to be of Ipswichian (last interglacial, MIS 5 e) age.

40|$|In his {{interesting}} and helpful paper 'McNaughton and Rawling on the Agentrelative/Agent-neutral Distinction, ' Douglas Portmore criticizes our formalization of duties {{on the grounds}} that we have overlooked an important class of conditional cases in which the antecedent of the conditional falls outside the scope of the deontic operator. He also suggests that we might do better to speak of reasons rather than pro tanto 'shoulds. ' In his note 11, Portmore sees our formulation as ruling out supererogatory acts if they conflict with even minor moral duties. We have since reformulated (see, e. g., McNaughton and Rawling, 2001) our 'S ' to abbreviate 'should, pro tanto, ensure to the best of her ability that, ' and see such 'shoulds ' as not necessarily moral; and where they are moral, they can, if sufficiently minor, be over-ridden not only by supererogatory considerations, but also by entirely non-moral considerations. However, discussion of reasons is of independent interest; and, in at least one dimension, it is simpler than discussion of 'shoulds. ' We <b>agree</b> <b>in</b> <b>part,</b> but not in whole, with Prichard in his 'Duty and Ignorance of Fact ' (1949) concerning the subjectivity of 'ought', and see this as carrying over to 'should, pro tanto.

No entanto, o trabalho de pesquisa foi feito em 13 escolas particulares e 17 pÃblicas, sendo entrevistados, ao final, 57 professores de MatemÃtica, em efetivo exercÃcio profissional. Para a coleta de dados foi elaborado um roteiro de entrevista contendo 14 assertivas e 1 questÃo aberta. Para cada assertiva o entrevistado respondeu, inicialmente, Ã escala (concordo, concordo em parte, discordo) e, a seguir, justificou sua escolha externando sua opiniÃo de forma mais detalhada. Para o registro desse procedimento, usou-se um gravador de fita cassete. Cada entrevista foi gravada, em sua Ãntegra, e depois transcrita usando-se o editor de texto Word for Windows. A anÃlise dos dados foi feita em duas etapas: uma descriÃÃo das respostas por meio da EstatÃstica Descritiva, utilizando-se o programa Statistical Parckage of Social Sciences (SPSS) e uma elaboraÃÃo de categorias por meio do mÃtodo de reduÃÃo fenomenolÃgica de HUSSERL.

However, the study in fact covered 13 private schools and 17 public schools. Fifty seven mathematics teachers, currently teaching, were interviewed. The data was collected through interviews containing 14 closed questions and one open one. In each closed question the person being interviewed initially answered as follows on the scale: I agree, I <b>agree</b> <b>in</b> <b>part,</b> I disagree. This was followed by justifying his choice or opinion in more precise detail. All interviews were fully recorded on a tape recorder.
