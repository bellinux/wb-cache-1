According to the <b>American</b> <b>Automobile</b> <b>Association</b> (AAA), distraction plays a factor in 60% of moderate to serious teen car crashes.

5|$|The {{interchange}} with I-96 (Jeffries Freeway) on {{the border}} between Plymouth Township and Livonia is where the FHWA considers I-275 to end as they do not note any overlap with I-96, however MDOT continues the designation on maps and signage to run concurrently with I-96 northward. I-96 merges from the east on the Jeffries Freeway and turns north; from the west, the M-14 freeway merges and ends. At the time the freeway from this interchange northward to Farmington Hills was opened to traffic, it was dual signed as I-96/I-275, and the unbuilt segment of freeway from Novi to Davisburg that was to be either I-275 or M-275 was still an active proposal. I-275 is shown running concurrently with I-96 through Livonia and Farmington Hills on MDOT maps, and other map makers and mapping service providers such as the <b>American</b> <b>Automobile</b> <b>Association,</b> Rand McNally and Google Maps label their maps in accordance with MDOT and not FHWA.|$|E
5|$|US8 {{was created}} with the {{beginnings}} of the United States Numbered Highway System on November 26, 1926. The highway was originally shown on maps running between Forest Lake, Minnesota and Powers, Michigan. At the time, its planned routing was not previously designated as part of the State Trunkline Highway System in Michigan. The trunkline connection from Quinnesec south into Wisconsin was part of M-57, which met WIS57 at the state line. US8 ended at WIS57 in Pembine at the time, with no connection into Michigan shown on official maps. A map by the <b>American</b> <b>Automobile</b> <b>Association</b> does show the highway continuing east through Faithorn and Hermansville in Michigan to end at US2. The Wisconsin Highway Commission previously indicated an unnumbered state highway on their 1925 state map that connected Pembine with the Menominee River near Hermansville. A later extension in 1927 moved US8 to run along US141, which had replaced WIS57 and M-57, ending in Quinnesec at US2. By the next year, the highway was shifted to end in Norway, utilizing a separate crossing of the Menominee River to enter Michigan.|$|E

500|$|Interstate 275 (I-275) is an Interstate in the US {{state of}} Michigan {{that acts as}} a western bypass of the Detroit {{metropolitan}} area. The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) maintains the highway as part of the larger state trunkline highway system. The freeway runs through the western suburbs near Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport, and crosses several rivers and rail lines in the area. The southern terminus is the interchange with I-75 near Newport, northeast of Monroe. MDOT considers the Interstate to run to an interchange with I-96, I-696 and M-5 on the Farmington Hills–Novi city line, running concurrently with I-96 for about [...] This gives a total length of about , which is backed up by official signage. According to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), the length is [...] because that agency considers I-275 to end at the junction with I-96 and M-14 along the boundary between Livonia and Plymouth Township.

High Ridge Road to the north connects back to I-70, and to the south links Bellaire to the bypass. I-470 continues easterly into a valley before intersecting a trumpet interchange with State Route 7 (SR7) along the western banks of the Ohio River. The Vietnam Veterans Memorial Bridge carries I-470 over three rail lines and the Ohio River (the state line between Ohio and West Virginia). The rail lines on the western banks of the river belong to the Norfolk Southern Railway and the Wheeling and Lake Erie Railway's River Subdivision.
