5|$|Archduke Charles, {{brother of}} the <b>Austrian</b> Emperor, had started to reform the <b>Austrian</b> army in 1801 by taking away power from the Hofkriegsrat (Aulic Council), the military-political council {{responsible}} for decisionmaking in the <b>Austrian</b> armed forces. Charles was Austria's best field commander, but he was unpopular with the royal court and lost much influence when, against his advice, Austria {{decided to go to}} war with France.|$|E
5|$|As the {{dissolution}} of Austria-Hungary was taking effect in October 1918, other such units were spontaneously formed on <b>Austrian</b> territory, mainly from rogue components of the Imperial Army. The Romanian Legion of Prague helped the Czechoslovak National Council and the Sokols gain the upper hand during an anti-Austrian uprising, while other Romanian units were breaking away from <b>Austrian</b> command in Vienna. Romanians also formed a distinct segment of the k.u.k. Kriegsmarine personnel who rioted on the <b>Austrian</b> Littoral {{and elsewhere in the}} Adriatic.|$|E
50|$|According to the Danes, 210 Danes and 406 <b>Austrians</b> {{were killed}} or wounded during the battle. According to the <b>Austrians,</b> however, the Danes lost 962 men and the <b>Austrians</b> only 431.|$|R

50|$|French {{losses are}} stated as 319 killed and wounded. The <b>Austrians</b> {{suffered}} 400 killed and wounded, plus 2,900 men and 6 cannons captured. One historian says 2,000 <b>Austrians</b> were captured. Cut off from Vienna, the <b>Austrians</b> retreated westward toward their base at Ulm.|$|R
5|$|Austerlitz and the {{subsequent}} Treaty of Pressburg in 1805 indicated that the <b>Austrian</b> army needed reform. Napoleon had offered Charles the <b>Austrian</b> throne after Austerlitz, an act that aroused deep suspicion from Charles' brother, <b>Austrian</b> emperor Francis II. Even though Charles was allowed to spearhead the reforms of the <b>Austrian</b> army, Francis kept the Hofkriegsrat (Aulic Council), a military advisory board, to oversee the activities of Charles as supreme commander.|$|E
5|$|During her trials, UB-7 {{developed}} a leak which {{took some time}} to repair. In the meantime, she was assigned the <b>Austrian</b> number of U-7 and an <b>Austrian</b> commander. Her German crew at Pola—since it was still the intent for UB-7 {{to be transferred to}} the K.u.K. Kriegsmarine—wore either civilian clothes or <b>Austrian</b> uniforms. As time dragged on, the <b>Austrian</b> U-3 and U-4 were still not ready, and eventually Admiral Anton Haus, the head of the <b>Austrian</b> Navy, reneged on his commitment because of the overt hostility from neighbor and former ally Italy.|$|E
5|$|During her trials, UB-8 was {{assigned}} the <b>Austrian</b> number of U-8 and an <b>Austrian</b> commander.

5000|$|On 19 October, Moreau with 32,000 {{soldiers}} fought Charles with 28,000 <b>Austrians</b> at the Battle of Emmendingen. The French suffered 1,000 {{killed and}} wounded, including General of Division Michel de Beaupuy killed. In addition, the <b>Austrians</b> captured 1,800 men and 2 cannons. The <b>Austrians</b> losses totaled 1,000, including Feldzeugmeister Wilhelm von Wartensleben killed.|$|R
50|$|The Turkish/Ottoman {{move up the}} River Danube {{was also}} of concern to the <b>Austrians,</b> who moved forces into Transylvania in response. However, the <b>Austrians</b> had begun to fear the Russians more than the Turks. Indeed, like the British, the <b>Austrians</b> were now coming to see that an intact Ottoman Empire was {{necessary}} as a bulwark against the Russians. Accordingly, the <b>Austrians</b> resisted Russian diplomatic attempts to join the war on the Russian side. Austria remained neutral in the Crimean War.|$|R
50|$|According to the 2001 census, {{there are}} 247 people who {{consider}} themselves <b>Austrians,</b> {{with the largest}} group (21.8% of Croatia's ethnic <b>Austrians)</b> residing in Zagreb.|$|R
5|$|Following his {{crossing}} of the Alps, Napoleon commenced military operations against the <b>Austrian</b> army. Despite an inauspicious start to the campaign, the <b>Austrian</b> forces were driven back to Marengo after nearly a month. There, a large battle took place on 14 June, {{which resulted in the}} <b>Austrian</b> evacuation of Italy.|$|E
5|$|In February 1938, Hitler {{emphasised}} to <b>Austrian</b> Chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg {{the need}} for Germany to secure its frontiers. Schuschnigg scheduled a plebiscite regarding <b>Austrian</b> independence for 13 March, but Hitler demanded that it be cancelled. On 11 March, Hitler sent an ultimatum to Schuschnigg demanding that he hand over all power to the <b>Austrian</b> NSDAP or face an invasion. The Wehrmacht entered Austria the next day, to be greeted with enthusiasm by the populace.|$|E
5|$|In July 2011 <b>Austrian</b> pastafarian Niko Alm won {{the legal}} right to be shown in his driving license photo wearing a pasta {{strainer}} on his head, after three years spent pursuing permission and obtaining an examination certifying that he was psychologically fit to drive. He got the idea after reading that <b>Austrian</b> regulations allow headgear in official photos only when it is worn for religious reasons. Some sources report that the colander in the form of pasta strainer, was recognised by <b>Austrian</b> authorities as a religious headgear of the parody religion Pastafarianism in 2011. This was denied by <b>Austrian</b> authorities, saying that religious motives were not the reason to grant the permission of wearing the headgear in a passport.|$|E
25|$|While the <b>Austrians</b> {{initially}} {{held the}} river line, Lannes' strike force crashed through Louis' defenses farther east.

5000|$|At the Battle of Montenotte, the First French Republic under Napoleon {{defeated}} the <b>Austrians</b> and destroyed an entire corps, thereby destroying {{the link between}} the <b>Austrians</b> and their allies Kingdom of Sardinia. As a result of the victory, the Sardinians were separated from Austria and were unable to defeat the French or rejoin the <b>Austrians.</b> They eventually sued for peace.|$|R
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the execution of King Louis XVI, revolutionary France was attacked by Prussian and Holy Roman forces from the <b>Austrian</b> Netherlands. Though the French defeated the <b>Austrian</b> army in the Battle of Jemappes in 1792 and briefly occupied the <b>Austrian</b> Netherlands and Prince-Bishopric of Liège, they were pushed out by an <b>Austrian</b> counterattack in the Battle of Neerwinden the following year. In June 1794, French revolutionary troops expelled Holy Roman forces from the region for the last time after the Battle of Fleurus. The French government voted to formally annex the territory in October 1795 and it was split into nine provincial départements within France.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} morning of 10 April, leading {{elements}} of the <b>Austrian</b> army crossed the Inn River and invaded Bavaria. Bad roads and freezing rain slowed the <b>Austrian</b> advance in the first week, but the opposing Bavarian forces gradually retreated. The <b>Austrian</b> attack occurred about a week before Napoleon's anticipations, and in his absence Berthier's role became all the more critical. Berthier (whose fortè was staff work) {{proved to be an}} insufficient field commander, a characteristic made worse by the fact that several messages from Paris were being delayed and misinterpreted when they finally arrived at headquarters. Whereas Napoleon had written to Berthier that an <b>Austrian</b> attack before 15 April should be met by a general French concentration around Donauwörth and Augsburg, Berthier focused on a sentence that called for Davout to station his III Corps around Regensburg and ordered the Iron Marshal to move back to the city despite massive <b>Austrian</b> pressure.|$|E
5|$|Prussia became anxious at <b>Austrian</b> {{advances}} on the Rhine frontier, and Frederick again invaded Bohemia, {{beginning a}} Second Silesian War; Prussian troops sacked Prague in August 1744.

50|$|On 9 December, in the night, the <b>Austrians</b> {{attacked}} the French advanced posts at {{the ruins of}} the old post house and church of the old village of Kehl. The fighting was bitter and short, but the <b>Austrians</b> finally took the post, to be driven out the next morning. In this subsequent attack, at which Archduke Charles was present, the <b>Austrians</b> lost about three hundred men and an officer. They attacked again on the 10 and 11 December, but could not take the posts. The <b>Austrians</b> also launched fire ships to destroy the pontoon bridge, but these were repulsed and destroyed. The <b>Austrians</b> took the Ehrlinrhin, a large island on which several of the French reserve units had been positioned. General Lecourbe removed one of the flying bridges to cut off all hope of a (French) retreat, grabbed a standard and rallied a battalion to advance against the <b>Austrians,</b> repulsing them as far as their trenches. Lecourbe's quick thinking preserved half of the island for the French.|$|R

5|$|Riesling is {{the second}} leading white grape varietal after the {{indigenous}} Grüner Veltliner. <b>Austrian</b> Riesling is generally thick bodied, coating the palate and producing a strong clarity of flavour coupled with a mouthwatering aroma. A particular <b>Austrian</b> Riesling trademark is a long finish that includes hints of white pepper. It flourishes in the cool climate and free-draining granite and mica soil of the Wachau region where <b>Austrian</b> wine laws allow for irrigation. With levels normally around 13% it has a relatively high alcohol content for Riesling and is generally at its peak after 5 years. <b>Austrian</b> Riesling is not known for its sweetness and is mostly dry with very few grapes affected by botrytis.|$|E
5|$|Shortly before Hitler was {{eligible}} for parole, the Bavarian government attempted {{to have him}} deported back to Austria. The <b>Austrian</b> federal chancellor rejected the request on the specious grounds that his service in the German Army made his <b>Austrian</b> citizenship void. In response, Hitler formally renounced his <b>Austrian</b> citizenship on 7 April 1925.|$|E

50|$|Perczel’s legion {{contained}} approximately 6,500 {{soldiers and}} 24 cannon. The northern area near Mór was disadvantageous, {{because it was}} surrounded by a forest which the <b>Austrians</b> could easily break through. Perczel had determination, {{and the fact that the}} <b>Austrians</b> had a smaller army there made him more confident. But he did not reconnoitre the <b>Austrians,</b> so he did not realise how powerful they were.|$|R
60|$|Night {{fell upon}} {{a scene of}} general confusion. The two armies were {{completely}} mixed up. In some places <b>Austrians</b> were {{in the rear of}} the Prussians, in others Prussians in the rear of <b>Austrians.</b>|$|R
25|$|Wurmser with 17,000 troops {{defeated}} Pichegru with 12,000 in the Battle of Mannheim on 18 October 1795. For {{the loss}} of 709 killed, wounded, and missing, the <b>Austrians</b> inflicted 1,500 casualties on the French. In addition, Wurmser's army captured 500 soldiers, three guns, and one color. The <b>Austrians</b> overran the French camp outside Mannheim and placed the city under siege. On 29 October, Clerfayt mounted a surprise attack on the French lines near Mainz. In the Battle of Mainz, 27,000 <b>Austrians</b> defeated 33,000 French under General of Division François Ignace Schaal. The <b>Austrians</b> suffered 1,600 casualties while the French lost 4,800 killed, wounded, and missing, plus 138 guns and 494 wagons. Clerfayt then turned south {{to deal with the}} Army of Rhin-et-Moselle. Winning the Battle of Pfeddersheim on 10 November and other actions, the <b>Austrians</b> relentlessly drove Pichegru's army south down {{the west bank of the}} Rhine until Mannheim was completely isolated. On 22 November the Siege of Mannheim ended when the 10,000-man French garrison surrendered to Wurmser's 25,000 <b>Austrians.</b>|$|R
5|$|The <b>Austrian</b> School of {{economics}} began with Carl Menger's 1871 Principles of Economics. Menger's followers formed a distinct group of economists until around the World War II when {{the distinction between}} <b>Austrian</b> economics and other schools of thought had largely broken down. The <b>Austrian</b> tradition survived as a distinct school, however, through the works of Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek. Present-day Austrians are distinguished by their interest in earlier <b>Austrian</b> works and abstention from standard empirical methodology including econometrics. Austrians also focus on market processes instead of equilibrium. Mainstream economists are generally critical of its methodology.|$|E
5|$|The Austrians had arrayed {{their own}} army {{in a line}} from the Tyrol to the Danube. A force of 46,000under command of Count Heinrich von Bellegarde formed the defence of the Tyrol. Another small <b>Austrian</b> force of 26,000commanded by Friedrich Freiherr von Hotze guarded the Vorarlberg. The main <b>Austrian</b> Army—close to 80,000 troops under the command of Archduke Charles—had wintered in the Bavarian, <b>Austrian,</b> and Salzburg territories on {{the eastern side of the}} Lech. At the battles of Ostrach (21 March) and Stockach (25 March), the main <b>Austrian</b> force pushed the Army of the Danube back into the Black Forest. Charles made plans to cross the upper Rhine at the Swiss town of Schaffhausen. Friedrich Freiherr von Hotze brought a portion (approximately 8,000) of his force west, leaving the rest to defend the Vorarlberg. At the same time, Friedrich Joseph, Count of Nauendorf, brought the left wing of the main <b>Austrian</b> force across the Rhine by Eglisau. They planned to unite with the main <b>Austrian</b> army, {{controlling}} the northern access points of Zürich and forcing an engagement with Masséna.|$|E
