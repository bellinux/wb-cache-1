5|$|The {{veracity}} of Hahn's claim was questioned {{as early as}} 1876, and the illustration appears to be plagiarised from the plate by François-Nicolas Martinet which was published at least 50 years earlier. After King Maximilian died in 1825, his collection was auctioned off, but no Mascarene parrot was mentioned in the inventory list of species. Hahn {{did not mention the}} date in which he <b>actually</b> <b>saw</b> the bird which could have been long before 1834. However, the fact that Martinet's image was copied and that no mounted specimen exists (though such a rare bird would probably have been preserved) makes Hahn's account dubious. He may instead have based his account on other sources or even hearsay.|$|E
5|$|At 05:13 on 5 August, Bridgeports lookouts spotted Ushant Light. At 06:40, SC-48 sighted a torpedo {{and sounded}} a warning. Two minutes later, men {{on board the}} tender saw the torpedo wake on Bridgeports port quarter. Orders came down for full left rudder and full speed ahead. Bridgeport swung barely out of harm's way as men on her stern {{observed}} the torpedo disappear {{on the port side}} and reappear to starboard. It passed five feet astern, barely clearing the rudder. The starboard battery fired one shot {{in the direction of the}} torpedo—which broached on the starboard quarter—while the port guns fired in the direction from which the torpedo had come. Meanwhile, two destroyers, with a number of subchasers, hurried toward the spot where the torpedo wake had apparently begun and dropped depth charges. Bridgeport ceased fire and resumed her place in the formation. Through all this activity, no one <b>actually</b> <b>saw</b> the submarine that had fired the torpedo.|$|E

50|$|The sawed lumber {{industry}} supplanted the {{squared timber}} trade {{around the time}} Ottawa was incorporated when an influx of mostly American lumber barons decided that more money could be made if the timber was <b>actually</b> <b>sawed.</b> Mills began to be constructed; some of Canada's largest sawmills were located near the Chaudière Falls. Notable lumber barons in this area were Henry Franklin Bronson and John Rudolphus Booth. The lumber industry contributed to Ottawa's growth, and evidence of it is practically nonexistent today. The major portion of this industry lasted until shortly {{after the turn of}} the century, the decline being caused by decreased markets for lumber due to the switch to steel, Britain no longer subsidizing the market, and reduced supplies of uncut timber. During a time of stagnation in manufacturing and a decrease in the city's industrialization, the city would see new government departments being formed and large increases in public service employment following 1900.|$|R
60|$|One part {{of these}} rocks, I think, no {{geologist}} interested in this subject should pass without examination; viz., the little spur of Blaitière drawn in Plate +29+, Fig. 3. It is seen, as there shown, from the moraine of the Charmoz glacier, its summit bearing S. 40° W.; and its cleavage bed leaning {{to the left or}} S.E., against the aiguille Blaitière.

5|$|Leonard Nimoy {{begins the}} episode hosting {{a show about}} alien {{encounter}}s. He talks about an encounter in a town called Springfield. At Moe's on a Friday night, a drunk Homer is forced to walk home, but takes a wrong path and {{ends up in the}} woods. In a clearing, he sees a glowing, thin-boned alien. Homer panics and runs home screaming. The rest of the family do not believe Homer's story and his attempts to report the alien sighting to police are dismissed. Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully of the FBI hear of the sighting and go to investigate. After receiving no results from their psychological tests of him, Homer fails to provide any proof that he <b>actually</b> <b>saw</b> an alien. Homer is ridiculed by most of the neighborhood; even Marge refuses to believe in his claims, but Bart admits he believes Homer. The next Friday night, the pair camp out in the forest. The alien arrives and promises peace, but Homer scares it away when he accidentally steps on their camp fire and screams in pain. Fortunately, Bart captures the entire incident on tape.|$|E
5|$|The {{exhibition}} {{opened on}} July 9, 1962, with Warhol absent. The thirty-two single soup can canvases {{were placed in}} a single line, much like products on shelves, each displayed on narrow individual ledges. The contemporary impact was uneventful, but the historical impact is considered today {{to have been a}} watershed. The gallery audience was unsure what to make of the exhibit. A John Coplans Artforum article, which was in part spurred on by the responding display of dozens of soup cans by a nearby gallery with a display advertising them at three for 60 cents, encouraged people to take a stand on Warhol. Few <b>actually</b> <b>saw</b> the paintings at the Los Angeles exhibit or at Warhol's studio, but word spread in the form of controversy and scandal due to the work's seeming attempt to replicate the appearance of manufactured objects. Extended debate on the merits and ethics of focusing one's efforts on such a mundane commercial inanimate model kept Warhol's work in art world conversations. The pundits could not believe an artist would reduce the art form to the equivalent of a trip to the local grocery store. Talk did not translate into monetary success for Warhol. Dennis Hopper was the first of only a half dozen to pay $100 for a canvas. Blum decided to try to keep the thirty-two canvases as an intact set and bought back the few sales. This pleased Warhol who had conceived of them as a set, and he agreed to sell the set for ten monthly $100 installments to Blum. Warhol had passed the milestone of his first serious art show. While this exhibition was on view in Los Angeles, Martha Jackson canceled another planned December 1962 New York exhibition.|$|E

40|$|The {{control over}} the {{products}} of the sawing of logs is important for the management of the sawmill and also to reduce environmental impacts. The yield and the time study are parameters for the assessment of unfolding in a sawmill. This study aimed to evaluate the yield and the time study of the sawing of Eucalyptus logs during the production of structural parts. This work used ten logs of Eucalyptus grandis from a plantation with 15 years of age, taken from an area of the Federal University of Lavras (UFLA). In the experimental sawmill of UFLA the logs were sawn using a band saw and the planks were resawn in a circular saw. The structural parts followed the dimensions laid down in the NBR 7190 (ASSOCIAÇÃO BRASILEIRA DE NORMAS TÉCNICAS - ABNT, 1997). The parts produced were measured and calculated yield. The times of all stages of the process were obtained using a stopwatch and then analyzed the time <b>actually</b> <b>sawing</b> and the processing time of logs and planks. The average of yield for the production of main parts was 20. 9 % and secondary part was 22. 9 %. Average yield of sawing was satisfactory if compared with the values ​​obtained in other studies. The circular saw compared to band saw showed higher percentage of effective time sawing of wood. The effective time of sawing was less than half the total processing time of the logs...|$|R

He won the affection of many newspapers and publicists including that of a then unknown Mark Twain and Walt Whitman.

25|$|In {{response}} to this turn of events, McCalmont Brothers liquidated its holdings in the Reading and withdrew from ongoing litigation. The forty-year predominance of English capital in the finances and affairs of the Reading Railroad was thus ended; but in exchange the company's future became a fresh, inviting target for opportunistic American capital. In 1881 and 1882 the Coal & Iron Co. continued to register losses, but the railroad <b>actually</b> <b>saw</b> upturns in its passenger, coal and merchandise freight business lines. Austerity measures implemented early in the bankruptcy at the railroad's car production and repair shops in Reading now found these operations taxed to their limits. Rather than rehabilitate these units, though, Gowen put money into building diverse new stations {{as well as a}} million-bushel grain elevator at Port Richmond. He also moved to expand the Reading Railroad's scope by having it lease the Central Railroad of New Jersey (the Jersey Central). Vanderbilt supported the move as it would increase the value of his own railroad's interconnection at New York Harbor. Ominously, the Jersey Central was at the time in receivership, and the deal included assumption by Gowen's Reading of the Jersey Central's US$2 million of floating debt and guaranteeing a 6% dividend on all of the Central's stock then outstanding.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} design an {{original}} plush toy, {{one needs to}} construct an appropriate 2 D pattern. However, {{it is difficult for}} ordinary people to design 2 D pattern appropriately. Therefore existing patterns for plush toys or balloon have been designed by professional designers. To help people to design their own original plush toys, we are developing two systems for pattern design. The first system, Pillow, starts with an existing 3 D model and lets the user interactively specify segmentation boundaries by drawing seam lines on the model surface. Given the user-defined segmentation, the system generates 2 D patterns by flattening the pieces. The system then visualizes the shape of the resulting plush toy by applying a simple physics simulation. This closed loop interaction allows the user to experiment with various seam line designs without <b>actually</b> <b>sawing</b> a real fabric. The second system, Plushie, is a tool for desinging an original plush toy from scratch using a sketch-based modeling interface under physical constraints. The resulting model is always associated with a 2 D cloth pattern and thus the user can generate a model that is guaranteed to be realizable as a plush toy. These two systems make the construction of 2 D patterns easier and enable the user to design his or her own original plush toys. We introduce some results of sawing plush toys and balloon.
