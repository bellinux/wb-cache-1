500|$|When Fiasco was 18, {{he began}} {{creating}} {{music as a}} solo artist in his father's basement, even though his parents were not keen on having their son be a rapper. He scoured flea markets and secondhand stores, where {{he was able to}} find an old mixing board and a record player, stacks of vinyl records, and mic stands. [...] At age 19, Fiasco joined a group called Da Pak, which was influenced by other California gangsta rappers such as Spice 1 and Ice Cube. Da Pak signed to Epic Records and released one single before splitting up. Fiasco later described the experience, saying [...] "We had a song out about cocaine, guns, and women, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> to a record store and look at it and think, 'What are you doing?' I felt like a hypocrite. I was acting like this rapper who would never be judged, and I had to destroy that guy. Because what Lupe Fiasco says on this microphone is {{going to come back to}} Wasalu Jaco. When the music cuts off, you have to go home and live with what you say." ...|$|E

The choice she made as an actress was, in playing the outsider in the Ewing family, she actually maintained somewhat of an outsider position with the cast as social equals. She didn't {{do a lot of}} the hanging out social activities that a lot of us did because we were together so much. So in that sense, she was maybe a few percentage points removed from the swirl that was the social center of our group. At least twice a year Larry Hagman <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> up to Canada – fishing trips, hunting trips, things like that. Steve Kanaly was included in that group, and we would go up together, and Steve and I would take other trips together. We were a group, and Linda Gray was also a member of that group. Victoria was always slightly outside and didn't participate in those things. It was her own choice and she felt it was conducive to her playing the part of Pamela. But the times we were together on the set, waiting for scenes to be shot, in the make-up room and everything, it was nothing but convivial." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rowling {{describes}} her character Dolores Umbridge, the Ministry-appointed headmistress of Hogwarts and under-secretary to the minister, Cornelius Fudge, saying [...] "She has good contacts at the Ministry. She {{is one of}} those people, and they do exist in real life, who will always side with the established order. As far as she is concerned authority cannot be wrong so she doesn't question it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> as {{far as to say that}} whatever happened and whoever took over at the Ministry, Umbridge would be there, she likes power. So she is going to side with the people who give her the authority." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{have said}} as much as can be necessary,--perhaps more, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> rather <b>go</b> now." [...] Then {{she left the room}} with the same slow, stately step, and he saw her no more on that day.|$|R

2500|$|In 1990, Unger ran a {{symbolic}} {{campaign for a}} seat in the national chamber of deputies. He had no money, no structure, and only campaigned for eight weeks. He ran on a platform of reforming the slums, and went around the slum neighborhoods giving lectures. He received 9,000 votes, just 1,000 votes short of winning the seat. None of the votes came from the slums, however. All his votes had come from the middle class, although he had never campaigned in those neighborhoods or to that constituency. Recalling the experience, Unger says [...] "it was kind of absurd... I had no money, no staff, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> into these slums, alone, to hand out pamphlets, often to the local drug pushers." [...] It is an experience that Unger cites as leading to his belief that the system and possibilities were much more open than he had previously imagined.|$|E

6000|$|... "If I were a soldier," [...] said Carlos, [...] "I {{would never}} get into an omnibus at all. I would have an elegant black horse with a long tail, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> {{galloping}} through the streets on my horse." ...|$|E
60|$|Towards sunset {{that evening}} I stood {{again on the}} well-remembered terrace, and looked once more at the {{peaceful}} old country house. The gardener {{was the first person}} whom I saw in the deserted grounds. He had left Betteredge, an hour since, sunning himself in the customary corner of the back yard. I knew it well; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> said <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> seek him myself.|$|R
60|$|The fishermen's song grew ever nearer and clearer, {{as their}} boat stood {{in for the}} beach; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have <b>gone</b> down to see them land their cargo of fish, had not the {{microcosm}} at my feet stirred my curiosity yet more keenly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Another thing I {{wish you}} to do, skipper, {{which is to}} give me a passage in your sloop to Athenbury. You spoke of running round there for repairs soon, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> rather <b>go</b> by sea than by that {{snorting}} railway. Will you do it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Who will go {{down over}} Lewthwaite Crag, and see if that boy is alive? Oh that I were twenty years younger, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> down myself!" [...] And so he would have done, {{as well as any}} sweep in the county. Then he said - ...|$|E
6000|$|The laird {{had left}} his phaeton and two ponies behind him, {{with the aid of}} which my father <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> the round of the estate doing such light duties as fall to an agent, or [...] "factor" [...] as it was there called, while our gentle Esther looked to our {{household}} needs, and brightened the dark old building.|$|E
6000|$|O {{ship that}} shakes on the desolate sea! O ship with the wet, white sail! Put in, put in, {{to the port}} to me! For my love <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> To the land where the daffodils blow In {{the heart of a}} violet dale! O ship that shakes on the desolate sea! O ship with the wet, white sail! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "O, {{we can get}} wood {{enough in}} New York," [...] said Marco. [...] "The carmen bring it along every morning. We might have such a fire-place down in the basement, or in that little room in the stable, <b>and</b> then <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> build fires in it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A priest!" [...] he gasped. [...] "Get me a priest! Oh, if {{you would}} be saved from the flames of {{everlasting}} Hell, get me a priest to shrive me. <b>I</b> am dying, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>go</b> hence with the burden of all this sin upon my soul." ...|$|R
5000|$|Elliottwas one of {{the people}} that always let me know that she {{believed}} in me <b>and</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> far. She has always been there and had my back. We have about 3 albums worth of songs. It’s not even like work. Jazmine Sullivan on working with Missy Elliotton [...] "Need U Bad".|$|R
6000|$|... “Ah, your absent friend,” he said, {{making a}} wry mouth. “I detest all those artists, {{and all those}} writers, and all politicos who are thieves; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> even farther and higher, laying a curse on all idle lovers of women. You think perhaps I am a Royalist? No. If there was anybody in heaven or hell to pray to I would pray for a {{revolution}}—a red revolution everywhere.” ...|$|E
60|$|We {{arranged}} {{to start on}} the following Saturday from Kingston. Harris <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> down in the morning, and take the boat up to Chertsey, and George, who {{would not be able}} to get away from the City till the afternoon (George goes to sleep at a bank from ten to four each day, except Saturdays, when they wake him up and put him outside at two), would meet us there.|$|E
6000|$|STEVE, with excusable heat, 'Not at all. But she {{is of the}} {{age when}} a woman knows her own mind--which makes the whole affair {{extraordinarily}} flattering.' With undoubtedly a shudder of disgust Amy closes the cupboard door. Steve continues to behave in the most gallant manner. 'You must not quiz me, Colonel, for her circumstances are such that her partiality for me puts her in a dangerous position, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> to the stake rather than give her away.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not quite, aunt," [...] Helen answered, smiling. [...] "Only {{it is as}} I say. I {{like the}} country best, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> really rather <b>go</b> home." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{seems to}} be so, Inkoos, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> rather <b>go</b> with you than with the king, {{but most of all}} I desire to marry Nahoon. It may be that I shall not be able to marry him, but if that is so, at least I will never become one of the king's women." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you, sir. I {{was coming}} to see you if you hadn't sent for me, to say that I wished {{to give up my}} stripes and return to the ranks. I know I shall be {{degraded}} if I don't do it of my own free-will, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> rather <b>go</b> down than be sent down." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{had fallen}} in love with Diane Sampson, was like her shadow when at home. He hated me; he treated me as if I were the scum of the earth; if he had to address me for something, which was seldom, he did it harshly, like {{ordering}} a dog. Whenever I saw his sinister, handsome face, with its dark eyes always half shut, my hand itched for my gun, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> my way with something thick and hot inside my breast.|$|E
6000|$|... "You have {{no mercy}} on me because I struck at him," [...] he said. [...] "The one thing I shall always be sorry {{for is that}} I failed, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> away with {{pleasure}} if the horse had trampled {{the life out of}} him. Well, {{there was a time when}} you could have made what you wished of me, and now, at least, I shall not see the blackleg you have showered your favors on drag you down to the mire he came from." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By {{the faith}} of Calvin, thou didst confess it, before all this goodly company! Wilt thou deny thine own words, knave, in the very face of justice? Thou canst read--thou hast it in thy countenance, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> nigh to swear, too, that thou hast some inkling of the quill, were the truth {{honestly}} said. Signor Grimaldi, I know not how you find this affair {{on the other side}} of the Alps, but with us, our greatest troubles come from these well-taught knaves, who, picking up knowledge fraudulently, use it with felonious intent, without thought of the wants and rights of the public." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> further <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> on to ask, is {{not this}} present {{exchange}} of Notes, {{appealing to the}} common sense of the world, really the beginning, and the proper beginning, of the unprecedented Peace Negotiations to end this unprecedented war? <b>And,</b> <b>I</b> submit, the longer this open discussion goes on before the doors close upon the secret peace congress the better for mankind.|$|R
60|$|He was {{throwing}} {{his finger at}} both of us, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> think <b>would</b> have <b>gone</b> on, but for his seeming to think Joe dangerous, and going off.|$|R
60|$|After all was done, William moved that {{he might}} go up again, <b>and</b> that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> with him; named several things which we had on board {{that he could not}} sell there; and, particularly, told us he had been obliged to leave several things there, the caravans being not come in; and that he had engaged to come back again with goods.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should have}} felt just the same--that ours {{was not a}} marriage. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> back to Richard without repeating the sacrament, if he asked me. But 'the world and its ways have a certain worth' (I suppose): {{therefore}} I concede a repetition of the ceremony... Don't crush all {{the life out of}} me by satire and argument, I implore you! I was strongest once, I know, and perhaps I treated you cruelly. But Jude, return good for evil! I am the weaker now. Don't retaliate upon me, but be kind. Oh be kind to me--a poor wicked woman who is trying to mend!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To which Harold Skimpole would reply, you know," [...] he {{returned}} in his gayest manner {{and with his}} most ingenuous smile, [...] "'Upon my life I have not the least idea! I don't {{know what it is}} you call by that name, or where it is, or who possesses it. If you possess it and find it comfortable, I am quite delighted and congratulate you heartily. But I know nothing about it, I assure you; for I am a mere child, and I lay no claim to it, and I don't want it!' So, you see, excellent Boythorn <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> to dinner after all!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "His pulse is {{certainly}} a little stronger," [...] Frank said, [...] "and I hope we shall pull him round, though I did not think so when I saw him yesterday. I have been giving him broth every hour, and a few spoonfuls of lemonade with brandy in it between times, and I think the brandy has done him more good than the soup; if I were in your place, I would go on doing just the same to-day. This soup Abe has brought down is very strong, {{and two or three}} spoonfuls at a time will be all he will want; there is another lemon in there, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> on giving him brandy too; I think it's just strength he wants." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will tell}} you first of all, Mr. Balfour of Shaws, as one friend to another," [...] said Alan, [...] "that if I {{were going to kill}} a gentleman, it would not be in my own country, to bring trouble on my clan; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>go</b> wanting sword and gun, and with a long fishing-rod upon my back." ...|$|R
