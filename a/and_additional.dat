The motes preview a future pervaded by networks of wireless battery-powered sensors that monitor our environment, our machines, and even us. In this paper, we simulate and comparatively analyze the tree-based routing protocols: the Mint, the Broker, the Backbone and the Adaptive Tree using PROWLER. Our simulation results indicate that among all the tree-based routing protocols the adaptive tree protocol with <b>and</b> without <b>additional</b> layers has a low energy consumption, less loss rate and high throughput for all the radio models. However, the broker routing protocol with <b>and</b> without <b>additional</b> layers shows a slightly enhanced lifetime than the adaptive tree protocol with <b>and</b> without <b>additional</b> layers for all the radio models except the normal radio model (NRM). Further, for the NRM, the adaptive tree protocol with <b>and</b> without <b>additional</b> layers depicts a better lifetime than broker, mint and backbone routing protocols with <b>and</b> without <b>additional</b> layers...|$|R
