The background color ranges from light brown to reddish to grayish to almost black above, transitioning abruptly to white or cream below, sometimes with dark blotches beneath the paired fins.

[...] Mayow perceived the part [...] "spiritus nitro-aereus" [...] plays in combustion and in increasing the weight of the calces (oxides) of metals as compared with metals themselves. [...] Rejecting the common notions of his time that the use of breathing is to cool the heart, or assist the passage of the blood from the right to {{the left side of the}} heart, or merely to agitate it, Mayow saw in inspiration a mechanism for introducing oxygen into the body, where it is consumed for the production of heat and muscular activity.

40|$|Marriages of equally {{dependent}} spouses (MEDS) {{are those}} in which each partner generates between 40 % and 59 % of the total family earnings. The author argues that such marriages will become increasingly common. Currently, <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>fifth</b> (22 %) <b>of</b> all marriages are MEDS. This article shows that when marriages become MEDS, wives become less commit-ted to the union although husbands do not. When marriages become MEDS, the odds of di-vorce also increase. Such divorces are more often at the wife’s initiative than are divorces among other couples. These findings are interpreted to suggest that wives are {{more sensitive to the}} quality of their marriages than husbands are. This is because men benefit from the sta-tus of being married (i. e., being a husband) regardless of the emotional quality of their rela-tionship. The benefits that wives derive from marriage, however, appear to depend on the quality of their unions...|$|R

A suitably large building would normally require support columns, however, leading chief architect Joe Boehning to incorporate a roof designed by the Behlen company, a [...] "stress skin system" [...] made of light gauge metal supported {{by a series of}} trusses. The 338 x 300 ft roof was constructed first, just above street level, and the ground beneath was then excavated to form the bowl of the arena.

Its compact area, steep grade, and the proximity of the seats to the floor contribute to its legendary noise level. The subterranean design won international recognition for Boehning. The arena originally had a seating capacity of 14,831 and cost a mere $1.4 million to build, <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>fifth</b> the cost <b>of</b> comparable facilities built at the time.

MAIN MEASURES [...] Grade, current specialty, details of last audit participated in and its educational usefulness, and attitude to audit. RESULTS [...] 255 (41. 8 %) completed questionnaires were returned, 148 from registrars and 101 from senior registrars; grade was not indicated in six. 27 respondents were in general medicine, 26 in general surgery, 30 in anaesthetics, and 36 in psychiatry; other specialties had fewer than 20 respondents. <b>About</b> <b>a</b> <b>fifth</b> (54) <b>of</b> respondents, most in psychiatry (19 / 36, 53 %), had not participated in audit.
