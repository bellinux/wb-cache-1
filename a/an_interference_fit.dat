[...] The exposed end of the bush was then struck with a conical tool applied to the bore. [...] This action slightly flared the exposed end and left the external diameter 0.0038 inch (0.097mm) oversize. The bush was then pushed upwards {{out of the hole}} and re-inserted from the lower surface. [...] As the bush was being re-inserted its flared end broached the anodised material and a small amount of aluminium from the wall of the hole.

40|$|The most {{commonly}} reported complications related to cementless hip stems are loosening and thigh pain; {{both of these}} {{have been attributed to}} high levels of relative micromotion at the boneâ€“implant interface due to insufficient primary fixation. Primary fixation is believed by many to rely on achieving <b>a</b> sufficient <b>interference</b> <b>fit</b> between the implant and the bone. However, attempting to achieve <b>a</b> high <b>interference</b> <b>fit</b> not infrequently leads to femoral canal fracture either intra-operatively or soon after. The appropriate range of diametrical <b>interference</b> <b>fit</b> that ensures primary stability without risking femoral fracture is not well understood. In this study, a finite element model was constructed to predict micromotion and, therefore, instability of femoral stems. The model was correlated with an in vitro micromotion experiment carried out on four cadaver femurs. It was confirmed that <b>interference</b> <b>fit</b> has <b>a</b> very significant effect on micromotion and ignoring this parameter in an analysis of primary stability is likely to underestimate the stability of the stem. Furthermore, it was predicted that the optimal level of <b>interference</b> <b>fit</b> is around 50 Î¼m as this is sufficient to achieve good primary fixation while having a safety factor of 2 against femoral canal fracture.

40|$|In this work, a {{wind turbine}} shrink disk {{is used as}} the {{research}} object to investigate load-carrying performance of <b>a</b> multi-layer <b>interference</b> <b>fit,</b> and the theoretical model and finite element model are constructed. According to those models, a MW-level turbine shrink disk is designed, and a test device is developed to apply torque to this turbine shrink disk by hydraulic jack. Then, the circumferential slip between the contact surfaces is monitored and the slip of all contact surfaces is zero. This conclusion verifies the reasonability of the proposed models. The effect of the key influencing factors, such as machining deviation, assembly clearance and propel stroke, were analyzed. The contact pressure and load torque of the mating surfaces were obtained by building typical models with different parameters using finite element analysis (FEA). The {{results show that the}} minimum assembly clearance and the machining deviation within the machining range have little influence on load-carrying performance of multi-layer <b>interference</b> <b>fit,</b> while having <b>a</b> greater influence on the maximum assembly clearance and the propel stroke. The results also show that the load-carrying performance of <b>a</b> multiple-layer <b>interference</b> <b>fit</b> can be ensured only if the key factors are set within a reasonable design range. To avoid the abnormal operation of equipment caused by insufficient load torque, the propel stroke during practical assembly should be at least 0. 95 times the designed propel stroke, which is significant in guiding the design and assembly of the multi-layer <b>interference</b> <b>fit...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} hoop {{stresses}} on the rolling-element fatigue life of angular-contact and deep-groove ball bearings was determined for common inner-ring <b>interference</b> <b>fits</b> at the ABEC- 5 tolerance level. The analysis {{was applied to}} over 1150 bearing configurations and load cases. Hoop stresses were superimposed on the Hertzian principal stresses created by the applied bearing load to calculate the inner-race maximum shearing stress. The resulting fatigue life of the bearing was recalculated {{through a series of}} equations. The reduction in the fatigue life is presented as life factors that are applied to the unfactored bearing life. The life factors found in this study ranged from 1. 00 (no life reduction) [...] where there was no net interface pressure [...] to a worst case of 0. 38 (a 62 -percent life reduction). For <b>a</b> given <b>interference</b> <b>fit,</b> the reduction in life is different for angular-contact and deep-groove ball bearings. <b>Interference</b> <b>fits</b> also affect the maximum Hertz stress-life relation. Experimental data of Czyzewski, showing the effect of <b>interference</b> <b>fit</b> on rolling-element fatigue life, were reanalyzed to determine the shear stress-life exponent.

50|$|In the {{semi-floating}} configuration, the pin {{is usually}} fixed {{relative to the}} piston by <b>an</b> <b>interference</b> <b>fit</b> with the journal in the piston. (This replaced the earlier set screw method.) The {{connecting rod small end}} bearing thus acts as the bearing alone. In this configuration, only the small end bearing requires a bearing surface, if any. If needed, this is provided by either electroplating the small end bearing journal with a suitable metal, or more usually by inserting a sleeve bearing or needle bearing into the eye of the small end, which has <b>an</b> <b>interference</b> <b>fit</b> with the aperture of the small end. During overhaul, it is usually possible to replace this bearing sleeve if it is badly worn. The reverse configuration, fixing the gudgeon pin to the connecting rod instead of to the piston, is implemented using <b>an</b> <b>interference</b> <b>fit</b> with the small end eye instead, with the gudgeon pin journals in the piston functioning as bearings. This arrangement is usually more difficult to manufacture and service because two bearing surfaces or inserted sleeves complicate the design. In addition, the pin must be precisely set so that the small end eye is central. Because of thermal expansion considerations, this arrangement was more usual for single-cylinder engines as opposed to multiple cylinder engines with long cylinder blocks and crankcases, until precision manufacturing became more commonplace.|$|E

The solution is obtained by extending the use of ‘inverse technique’ which was successfully applied earlier by the authors to problems of pins in isotropic and orthotropic domains.

40|$|Rolling-element {{bearings}} operated at {{high speed}} or high vibration may require <b>a</b> tight <b>interference</b> <b>fit</b> between the bore of the bearing and shaft to prevent rotation of the bearing bore around the shaft and fretting damage at the interfaces. Previous work showed that the hoop stresses resulting from tight <b>interference</b> <b>fits</b> can reduce bearing lives {{by as much as}} 65 percent. Where tight <b>interference</b> <b>fits</b> are required, case-carburized steel such as AISI 9310 or M 50 NiL is often used because the compressive residual stresses inhibit subsurface crack formation and the ductile core inhibits inner-ring fracture. The presence of compressive residual stress and its combination with hoop stress also modifies the Hertz stress-life relation. This paper analyzes the beneficial effect of residual stresses on rolling-element bearing fatigue life in the presence of high hoop stresses for three bearing steels. These additional stresses were superimposed on Hertzian principal stresses to calculate the inner-race maximum shearing stress and the resulting fatigue life of the bearing. The load-life exponent p and Hertz stress-life exponent n increase in the presence of compressive residual stress, which yields increased life, particularly at lower stress levels. The Zaretsky life equation is described and is shown to predict longer bearing lives and greater load- and stress-life exponents, which better predicts observed life of bearings made from vacuum-processed steel...|$|R

40|$|The Oxford Unicompartmental Knee Replacement (OUKR) is an {{effective}} treatment for symptomatic end-stage anteromedial osteoarthritis. In contrast with data from specialist centres, the National Joint Registries suggest a higher revision rate than total knee replacement. The cementless version of the OUKR was introduced to prevent cementation errors, improve fixation, {{reduce the incidence of}} radiolucent lines and ultimately reduce the discrepancy between the results of specialist centres and National Joint Registries. There are, however, anecdotal reports of tibial plateau fractures with cementless fixation. The aim of this thesis was to assess the clinical outcome and key biomechanical aspects of the fixation of the cementless OUKR. A systematic review demonstrated that modern cementless unicompartmental knee replacements (UKRs) are safe and effective. The cementless OUKR had a 10 -year survival of 97 % and 88 % good or excellent clinical results in a prospective, consecutive case series of 1000 cases from two centres. The primary stability of the cementless OUKR relies on the <b>interference</b> <b>fit.</b> The 5 -year results of a randomised controlled trial using radiostereometric analysis demonstrated that cementless components are as stable as cemented. Although sufficient in providing component stability, the <b>interference</b> <b>fit</b> could be excessive increasing the risk of fracture. A biomechanical test was carried out to study the effect of interference on the force required to implant the tibial component (push-in force) and the fixation strength (pull-out force). The results demonstrated that a reduction of the interference up to 50 % significantly reduces the force required to implant the components without affecting their primary stability. In conclusion, the cementless fixation of the OUKR is safe and effective, with excellent long-term survival. The stability of cementless components is reliable and at least as good as that of the cemented implant. However, the <b>interference</b> <b>fit</b> around the tibial component is excessive. <b>A</b> reduced <b>interference</b> <b>fit</b> could decrease the risk of fracture without affecting the stability of the components. </p...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{contains}} {{the development of}} a method for determining the contact pressure distribution along the mating surfaces of two members assembled together with <b>an</b> initial <b>interference</b> <b>fit.</b> This method utilizes superposition, Fourier-series expansion techniques, and the finite-element method to determine the desired contact pressure distribution. The general approach to the solution of this problem entails assuming a Fourier-series representation of the contact pressure distribution expressed in terms of unknown Fourier coefficients. Superposition and finite-element methods are used to determine the displacement vector at common nodal points along the mating surfaces of the two members. The correct distribution of contact pressure results when these nodal displacements satisfy the initial interference between the two members. Enforcing this displacement requirement yields a system of equations from which the unknown Fourier pressure coefficients can be determined. Once the correct contact pressure distribution is known, the resulting stress distributions and deformations in the inner and outer members can be calculated. This method is illustrated and numerical results are obtained for the case where an outer member having an irregular-shaped boundary is shrunk onto a solid circular shaft representing the inner member...|$|R

[...] In small caliber firearms, the friction holding the bullet in the case, determines how soon after ignition the bullet moves, and since the motion of the bullet increases the volume and drops the pressure, a difference in friction can change the slope of the pressure curve. In general, a tight fit is desired, to the extent of crimping the bullet into the case.

However, {{a small fraction of}} these are designed and fabricated for mechanically-demanding applications. There are two key factors (which seem to be largely independent) that are key in the design and performance of a crimpedelectromagnetic tube joint. First is the state of residual stress that exists after the crimped joint is created. <b>A</b> natural <b>interference</b> <b>fit</b> seems to be a fairly general feature of EMF crimp joints. This <b>interference</b> gives <b>a</b> backlash-free joint that will not fret. The second key issue is the configuration of the joint. The fabrication of designed interlocking geometries is required to create a joint that maximizes mechanical strength while minimizing the electromagnetic energy and forces required to create it. Both of these issues will be considered here. Here we consider crimping onto textured surfaces such as screw threads and knurls. We show experimentally that approaches of this type can give joints that exceed the strength of the tube both in torsion and axial loading. Analysis methods based on coupling impact-indentation and break-before-strip criteria can be used to compare joints made in this way with those based on the more traditional large scale deformation of the tube. One of the advantages of forming onto 'textured' surfaces is that a number of small pulses (possibly generated by small and inexpensive capacitor banks) can be used to create a joint that has the strength of the parent tube, without any heat affected zones or distortion.
