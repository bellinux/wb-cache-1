The FM routines almost always return correctly rounded results. Extensive testing has found no cases where the error before rounding the final value was more than 0. 001 unit in the last place of the returned result. This means that in rare cases the returned result di#ered from the correctly rounded value by a maximum of one unit in the last place for a given precision.

40|$|We develop {{links between}} {{harmonic}} analysis, {{the geometry of}} numbers and random matrix theory {{in the setting of}} complex and quaternion vectors spaces. Harmonic analysis enters through the computation of volumes [...] - done using the Selberg integral [...] - of truncations of SL_N(C) and SL_N(H) endowed with invariant measure, which have applications to asymptotic counting formulas, for example of matrices in SL_ 2 (Z[i]). The geometry of numbers enters through imposing an invariant measure on the space of unimodular lattices, the latter constructed using certain complex quadratic integers (complex case) and the Hurwitz integers (quaternion case). We take up the problem of applying lattice reduction in this setting, in two dimensions, giving a unified proof of convergence of the appropriate analogue of the Lagrange [...] Gauss algorithm to the shortest basis. A decomposition of measure corresponding to the QR decomposition is used to specify the invariant measure in the coordinates of the shortest basis vectors, which also encodes the specification of fundamental domains of certain quotient spaces. Integration over the latter gives rise to certain number theoretic constants, which are also present in the asymptotic forms of the distribution of the lengths of the shortest basis vectors, which we compute explicitly. Siegel's mean value theorem can be used to reclaim these same <b>arithmetic</b> <b>constants.</b> Numerical implementation of the Lagrange [...] Gauss algorithm allows for statistics relating to the shortest basis to be generated by simulation.

The best known constant fan-in circuits for these arithmetic operations had logarithmic depth, linear size, and produce no errors.

50|$|The {{existence}} of non-standard models of arithmetic {{can be demonstrated}} by an application of the compactness theorem. To do this, a set of axioms P* is defined in a language including the language of Peano arithmetic together with a new constant symbol x.

Any finite subset of these axioms is satisfied by a model that is the standard model of <b>arithmetic</b> plus the <b>constant</b> x interpreted as some number larger than any numeral mentioned in the finite subset of P*. Thus by the compactness theorem there is a model satisfying all the axioms P*. Since any model of P* {{is a model of}} P (since a model of a set of axioms is obviously also a model of any subset of that set of axioms), we have that our extended model is also a model of the Peano axioms.

The answer depends on the model of rounded arithmetic: We assume that for any arithmetic operator op(a,b), for example a+b or a cdot b, its computed value is op(a,b) cdot (1 + delta), where | delta | is bounded by some constant epsilon where 0 < epsilon ll 1, but delta is otherwise arbitrary.

40|$|Estimation of soil {{moisture}} distribution in desert regions is {{challenged by the}} deep unsaturated zone and the extreme natural environment. In this study, an entropy-based method, consisting of information entropy, principle of maximum entropy (PME), solutions to PME with constraints, and the determination of parameters, is used to estimate the {{soil moisture}} distribution in the 10 m deep vadose zone of a desert region. Firstly, the soil moisture distribution {{is described as a}} scaled probability density function (PDF), which is solved by PME with the constraints of normalization, known arithmetic mean and geometric mean, and the solution is the general form of gamma distribution. A <b>constant</b> <b>arithmetic</b> mean is determined by considering the stable average recharge rate at thousand year scale, and an approximate constant geometric mean is determined by the low flow rate (about 1 cm a year). Followed, the parameters of the scaled PDF of gamma distribution are determined by local environmental factors like terrain and vegetation: the multivariate linear equations are established to qualify the relationship between the parameters and the environmental factors on the basis of nineteen random soil moisture profiles about depth through the application of fuzzy mathematics. Finally, the accuracy is tested using correlation coefficient (CC) and relative error. This method performs with CC larger than 0. 9 in more than a half profiles and most larger than 0. 8, the relative errors are less than 30 % in most of soil moisture profiles and can be as low as less than 15 % when parameters fitted appropriately. Therefore, this study provides an alternative method to estimate soil moisture distribution in top 0 – 10 m layers of the Badain Jaran Desert based on local terrain and vegetation factors instead of drilling sand samples, this method would be useful in desert regions with extreme natural conditions since these environmental factors can be obtained by remote sensing data.

40|$|Pitch Estimation, {{also known}} as Fundamental Frequency (F 0) estimation, has been a popular {{research}} topic for many years, and is still investigated nowadays. The goal of Pitch Estimation {{is to find the}} pitch or fundamental frequency of a digital recording of a speech or musical notes. It plays an important role, because it is the key to identify which notes are being played and at what time. Pitch Estimation of real instruments is a very hard task to address. Each instrument has its own physical characteristics, which reflects in different spectral characteristics. Furthermore, the recording conditions can vary from studio to studio and background noises must be considered. This dissertation presents a novel approach to the problem of Pitch Estimation, using Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP). We take advantage of evolutionary algorithms, in particular CGP, to explore and evolve complex mathematical functions that act as classifiers. These classifiers are used to identify piano notes pitches in an audio signal. To help us with the codification of the problem, we built a highly flexible CGP Toolbox, generic enough to encode different kind of programs. The encoded evolutionary algorithm is the one known as 1 +, and we can choose the value for. The toolbox is very simple to use. Settings such as the mutation probability, number of runs and generations are configurable. The cartesian representation of CGP can take multiple forms and it is able to encode function parameters. It is prepared to handle with different type of fitness functions: minimization of f(x) and maximization of f(x) and has a useful system of callbacks. We trained 61 classifiers corresponding to 61 piano notes. A training set of audio signals was used for each of the classifiers: half were signals with the same pitch as the classifier (true positive signals) and the other half were signals with different pitches (true negative signals). F-measure was used for the fitness function. Signals with the same pitch of the classifier that were correctly identified by the classifier, count as a true positives. Signals with the same pitch of the classifier that were not correctly identified by the classifier, count as a false negatives. Signals with different pitch of the classifier that were not identified by the classifier, count as a true negatives. Signals with different pitch of the classifier that were identified by the classifier, count as a false positives. Our first approach was to evolve classifiers for identifying artifical signals, created by mathematical functions: sine, sawtooth and square waves. Our function set is basically composed by filtering operations on vectors and by <b>arithmetic</b> operations with <b>constants</b> and vectors. All the classifiers correctly identified true positive signals and did not identify true negative signals. We then moved to real audio recordings. For testing the classifiers, we picked different audio signals from the ones used during the training phase. For a first approach, the obtained results were very promising, but could be improved. We have made slight changes to our approach and the number of false positives reduced 33 %, compared to the first approach. We then applied the evolved classifiers to polyphonic audio signals, and the results indicate that our approach is a good starting point for addressing the problem of Pitch Estimation...|$|R
