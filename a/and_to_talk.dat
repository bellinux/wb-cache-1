25|$|In {{her later}} years, Stuart took {{a house in}} London at 108, Gloucester Place, Marylebone, and from there she walked in Regent's Park. At home, she would sit with her books, and {{although}} something of a recluse, on occasion she was also highly sociable. She destroyed many of her manuscripts, but continued to write letters <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> and to visit great houses. A few months before her death, she was sketched by Sir George Hayter, and died at home in London on 4 August 1851.|$|E
25|$|The {{opposition}} badly {{wanted to}} get its story out {{to the rest of}} the world and so, as soon as they acquired a territorial base in Benghazi, foreign reporters were able to join them. These reporters were, to a large extent, free to travel wherever <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to whomever they wished within opposition-controlled areas. This proximity and relative freedom of access to the opposition side of events, combined with reporters' natural sympathies for what they see as genuine popular rebellions against despotic regimes, undoubtedly aided the opposition and hurt the Gaddafi-government in getting their respective messages out.|$|E

25|$|The {{new ideas}} and discoveries were publicized {{throughout}} Europe by {{the large number of}} book publishers in Paris. Between 1720 and 1780, the number of books about science and art doubled, while the number of books about religion dropped to just one-tenth of the total. Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d'Alembert published their Encyclopedie in seventeen volumes between 1751 and 1766. It provided intellectuals across Europe with a high quality survey of human knowledge. Scientists came to Paris from across Europe and from the United States to share ideas; Benjamin Franklin came in 1766 to meet with Voltaire <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about his experiments with electricity.|$|E
25|$|On May 21, 1948, a {{bill was}} {{introduced}} before the Puerto Rican Senate which would restrain {{the rights of}} the independence and Nationalist movements in the island. The Senate, which at the time was controlled by the PPD and presided by Luis Muñoz Marín, approved the bill. This bill, also known as the Ley de la Mordaza (Gag Law) and Law 53, received the approval of the legislature on May 21, 1948. It made it illegal to display a Puerto Rican flag, to sing a patriotic tune <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> of independence. The bill, which resembled the anti-communist Smith Law passed in the United States, was signed into law on June 10, 1948, by the U.S.-appointed governor of Puerto Rico, Jesús T. Piñero and became known as Ley 53 (Law 53).|$|E
25|$|In 1917, {{with the}} blessing of the Rt. Rev. John Gardner Murray, bishop of Maryland, Sam Shoemaker went to China to start a branch of the YMCA and teach {{business}} courses at the Princeton-in-China Program. Shoemaker spent several years in China, but attracted few converts until he came {{under the influence of the}} Oxford Group and Frank Buchman. A follower of Dr. Mott as well as leader of Penn State's Y group, Buchman advised Shoemaker to look inside himself, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about his personal experiences. Buchman also told Shoemaker about the essence of the Sermon on the Mount being four absolutes: honesty, purity, unselfishness and love. After contemplating his own inadequacy compared to those absolutes, Shoemaker decided to let God guide his life. He returned to Princeton in 1919 to head the Philadelphian Society, a campus Christian organization which he had led during his senior year.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the early}} 1980s, The Philadelphia Inquirer spoke with Strom {{to get a}} {{perspective}} {{on the life of}} an NBA referee for an article. [...] The sports reporter met Strom in a hotel lobby and was later joined by Milwaukee Bucks assistant coach, John Killelea. The three of them discussed referees and life in the NBA. When the article was published, the reporter wrote that he and Strom were joined by an assistant coach, whom Strom had bought a drink, and the tendencies for Strom to go into pressboxes to drink a cup of coffee <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> with spectators that he knew in the stands. While the league had approved the article, Strom was fined $2,000 and suspended a portion of the playoffs.|$|E

2500|$|After {{classes at}} Hollywood High, Stephens rushed to Rogers Airport [...] {{at the corner}} of Wilshire Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue to look at the biplanes <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> with the pilots. (Today, not a trace of the airport remains.) As months passed, the men came to like the lad, and taught him what they knew, even taking him on short hops. Eventually, Jim Webster, airport manager, agreed—with parental permission—to give him flying lessons in {{exchange}} for work around the hangars. In his lessons he was a quick learner, and after logging more cockpit time he finally soloed. This, of course, was an era before the Federal Aviation Administration, with its requisite ground courses and instruction hours. When a pilot first took him aloft, he saw a Los Angeles unrecognizable today. He looked down on a Wilshire Boulevard surrounded by countryside, bordered by [...] "a row of stunted palms." [...] He sometimes flew out of Mines Field, one day to become Los Angeles International Airport.|$|E
2500|$|After {{taking over}} as the SDP's Secretary-General, Chee began {{regularly}} travelling abroad <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about his views {{on the lack of}} democracy in Singapore to the foreign media. He also published his second political book, [...] In 1994, to respond to criticisms of the book made by Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, Chee wrote a letter to The Straits Times. The PAP's Second Organising Secretary, Matthias Yao (a Parliamentary Secretary and MP for Marine Parade GRC), then wrote to the newspaper to reply to Chee's comments. This led to a two-month-long exchange of letters between Chee and Yao which were published in the paper, which ended with Chee issuing a challenge for Yao to stand against him in a single member constituency at the next general election. At Yao's request, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong agreed to separate Yao's MacPherson ward from the rest of Marine Parade GRC at the next general election so that he could take up Chee's challenge.|$|E
2500|$|Mark Wahlberg as Jack Salmon, Susie's father, {{who becomes}} obsessed with his daughter's murder case. Wahlberg stated that {{his role in}} the film {{encouraged}} him to be a more cautious parent with his three children <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to them more about [...] "not talking to strangers." [...] Before Wahlberg's casting, Ryan Gosling was set to play the role but dropped out of the film in October 2007, one month before filming. Gosling had gained weight and grown a beard for the role, but said, [...] "The age of the character versus my real age [...] was always a concern of mine. Peter [...] and I tried to make it work and ultimately it just didn't. I think the film is much better off with Mark Wahlberg in that role." [...] Gosling later admitted that the real reason for his firing was that he had arrived for filming 60lbs. overweight and sporting a beard, without having discussed the physical change with Jackson.|$|E
