The <b>altitude</b> <b>dependences</b> of populations of four vibration states of H_ 2 O molecule and nineteen states of O_ 3 molecule have been first calculated. Spectral and integral intensities of radiation from zenith and limb radiation in 2, 7 and 6, 3 mu m bands for H_ 2 O and 4, 8 and 9, 6 mu m bands for O_ 3 have been studied. Significant deviation of vibration temperatures of H_ 2 O and O_ 3 molecules from gas-kinetic temperature in the interval from 40 to 120 km has been revealed. Availability of altitude peculiarities in population profiles, predominance of H_ 2 O radiation over CO_ 2 radiation in the range of 2, 7 mu m and necessity of an account of local thermodynamic equilibrium violation when estimating (O_ 3) based on measurements in 9, 6 mu m band have been first proved.

Precipitation estimates based on combination of rain gauge and radar data are used for this purpose. Statistical tests proved that the areal distribution of hourly convective rainfalls does not depend on altitude. Besides data containing precipitation events only, all measured data were statistically analysed regardless of the fact whether precipitation occurred or not. In this case it was found out that the relationship between hourly rainfall totals and altitude depends on the considered threshold of rainfall totals. When all data were considered, i. e. a threshold value was set to zero, an increase of rainfall totals well correlated with <b>altitude.</b> The <b>dependence</b> slowly disappeared with an increasing threshold. The areal distribution of 6 hour rainfall totals proved higher values in the area of south Bohemia.

The Space Station will encounter dramatically increasing ambient and induced environmental effects as the orbit decays. Unfortunately, Shuttle docking, which has been of concern as a high contamination period, will likely occur during {{the time when the}} station is in the lowest orbit. The combination of ambient and induced environments along with the presence of the docked Shuttle could cause very severe contamination conditions at the lower orbital altitudes prior to Space Station reboost.

The change in the induced environment will be manifest in several parameters. The ambient density buildup in front of ram facing surfaces will change.

40|$|International audienceWe {{report on}} daytime limb {{observations}} of Mars upper atmosphere {{acquired by the}} OMEGA instrument on board the European spacecraft Mars Express. The strong emission observed at 4. 3 μm is interpreted as due to CO 2 fluorescence of solar radiation and is detected at a tangent altitude in between 60 and 110 km. The main value of OMEGA observations is that they provide simultaneously spectral information and good spatial sampling of the CO 2 emission. In this study we analyzed 98 dayside limb observations spanning over more than three Martian years, with a very good latitudinal and longitudinal coverage. Thanks to the precise altitude sounding capabilities of OMEGA, we inferred the vertical profiles of the non-LTE emission at each wavelength and we studied their dependence on several geophysical parameters, such as the solar illumination and the tangent <b>altitude.</b> The <b>dependence</b> of the non-LTE emission on solar zenith angle and altitude follows a similar behavior to that predicted by the non-LTE model. According to our non-local thermodynamic equilibrium model (Non-LTE), the pressure level where {{the peak of the}} emission is found remains constant at ∼ 0. 03 ± 0. 01 Pa, and we have shown with SPICAM stellar occultation retrievals that the seasonal variations of constant pressure level altitudes correlate well with the variations of the OMEGA peak emission altitudes, although the exact pressure level can not be defined with the SPICAM nighttime data. The tangent altitude of this atmospheric layer depends on the structure of the whole atmosphere below, and represents a strong validation tool for atmospheric models. We thus compared the altitude of OMEGA peak emission with the tangent altitude of the 0. 03 Pa level predicted by the LMD-Mars Global Circulation Model. However, the peak emission altitudes from OMEGA present a much larger variability than the tangent altitude of the 0. 03 Pa level predicted by the GCM; this variability could be possibly due to unresolved atmospheric waves. Further studies using this strong CO 2 limb emission data are proposed...|$|R

However, when the measured electric field values are 'mapped' to the Earth's surface in order to account for the geometry of the geomagnetic field lines, then the mapped values always increase with increasing <b>altitude.</b> This radial <b>dependence</b> is considered to be evidence for magnetic field-aligned electric fields. The largest electric field that was detected with the DE 1 instrument had a magnitude exceeding 840 mV/m and was found at 1. 45 R(E). This field appears to be associated with a low-frequency wave. At subauroral latitudes the average mapped electric field is nearly constant with altitude, as it should be where there are no magnetic field-aligned potential drops. Within auroral latitudes the average value of the mapped electric field increases as altitude increases. The largest gradients are found between 1. 3 and 2 R(E) ...|$|R

The overall strategy used in deriving the new scaling factors is, however, very similar to that of Lal and relies on the same and/or similar nuclear data. In this reevaluation, data are only used if the effective geomagnetic parameters (inclination, horizontal field strength) can be reconstructed for the time of measurement. The absorption free pathlengths 1 for cosmic rays selected for this study are based on observational data at altitudes relevant for exposure age dating (sea level to 7000 m).
