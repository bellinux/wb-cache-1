Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM) and laser diffraction particle size analyzer were used to characterize the <b>anionic</b> <b>starch</b> microspheres. The results showed that structure of the microspheres was compact and the hardness of microspheres was great, and the average diameter of the product was about 75 µm. The <b>anionic</b> <b>starch</b> microspheres (ASMs) were used to adsorb methylene blue (MB) from aqueous solution. Effects of adsorption time, initial concentration of MB, and temperature on the adsorption of MB onto ASMs were studied, and the equilibrium and kinetics of the adsorption process were further investigated. It shows that ASMs can effectively remove MB from the solution. The adsorption equilibrium data correlates well with the Langmuir isotherm model compared with Frendlich isotherem model. The pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order kinetic models were applied to test the experimental data. The pseudo-second-order kinetic model provided a better correlation of the experimental data {{in comparison with the}} pseudo-first-order model. Temperature variations did not significantly affect the adsorption of MB onto ASMs...|$|E
40|$|Polyelectrolyte multilayers of {{cationic}} and <b>anionic</b> <b>starch</b> {{have been}} used to enhance the strength properties of paper. All starches used in this investigation had a degree of substitution around 0. 065. Optical reflectometry showed that a combination of cationic and <b>anionic</b> <b>starch</b> could form polyelectrolyte multilayers onto silicon oxide surfaces. The same combination of starches was then applied to unbeaten, bleached softwood kraft fibres to form three layers, i. e. a cationic/anionic/cationic starch combination. The results showed {{a significant increase in the}} paper strength properties in terms of tensile index, strain at break, and Scott Bond. The adsorbed amount of starch in the sheets, determined using an enzymatic method, was found to increase with each successive starch treatment. The increased paper strength was not only due to the increase in adsorbed amount of starch; rather, the chemical composition of the starch was also important. Cationic starch with high amylose content had a more positive effect on the paper strength properties. Furthermore, it was observed that <b>anionic</b> <b>starch,</b> despite being adsorbed in large amounts, did not contribute to the increase in tensile strength or strain at break to the same extent as did cationic starch. However, the out-of-plane properties, measured as Scott Bond properties, increased with the adsorbed amount, regardless of the chemical composition of the starch used in the outermost layer...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{colloidal}} behavior of mixtures of cationic polymer particles and <b>anionic</b> <b>starch.</b> Such mixtures are commonly used for the hydrophobization of paper. The effect of the concentration of <b>anionic</b> <b>starch</b> and {{of the presence of}} different electrolytes was assessed. In a previous study, oxidized starch had been found to induce aggregation of cationic hydrophobic nanoparticles, and in the study reported here it is demonstrated that this aggregated state is beneficial for the performance, enabling a substantial reduction of the amount of polymer nanoparticles needed to reduce the water uptake. It was found that when the particles were in a highly aggregated state, the water uptake by the paper surface was very small. The effect of mono- and divalent ions on the colloidal stability was also investigated. In general, it was found that an increased ionic strength gave a less hydrophobic paper surface. Na 2 SO 4 was more detrimental than NaCl and CaCl 2, which is explained by the valence of the anion. This implies that the hydrophobization can be tuned by controlling the aggregation of the polymer particles...|$|E

Some previous studies have referred to the capability of polysaccharides and proteins to remove either surfactants (Merta and Stenius 1999; Fijan et al. 2007; Blanco et al. 2007) or dyes (Sanghi et al. 2006, 2007), so a preliminary screening is needed {{to search for the}} real position of this coagulant inside the range of natural and commercial products.|$|R

An <b>anionic</b> polyacrylamide-grafted <b>starch</b> (St-g-APAM) {{flocculant}} for {{the coal}} slurry waste water, was prepared by using corn starch and acrylamide (AM) as monomers, acrylic acid (AA) as anionic monomer through solution polymerization. The effects of initiator concentration, reaction temperature, and monomer concentration on percentage of grafting and the grafting efficiency were investigated. The {{results show that}} the optimal conditions of the polymerization are as follows: the monomer to substrate ratio of 2. 0, AM:AA ratio of 2 : 1, potassium persulfate of 0. 7 x 10 - 3 mol/L, reaction time of 4 h, the reaction temperature of 50 °C.

40|$|The {{development}} of the layer-by-layer (LbL) technique {{has turned out to}} be an efficient way to physically modify the surface properties of different materials, for example to improve the adhesive interactions between fibers in paper. The main objective of the work described in this thesis was to obtain fundamental data concerning the adhesive properties of wood biopolymers and LbL films, including the mechanical properties of the thin films, in order to shed light on the molecular mechanisms responsible for the adhesion between these materials. LbLs constructed from poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) /poly(acrylic acid) (PAA), starch containing LbL films, and LbL films containing nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC) were studied with respect to their adhesive and mechanical properties. The LbL formation was studied using a combination of stagnation point adsorption reflectometry (SPAR) and quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D) and the adhesive properties of the different LbL films were studied in water using atomic force microscopy (AFM) colloidal probe measurements and under ambient conditions using the Johnson-Kendall-Roberts (JKR) approach. Finally the mechanical properties were investigated by mechanical buckling and the recently developed SIEBIMM technique (strain-induced elastic buckling instability for mechanical measurements). From colloidal probe AFM measurements of the wet adhesive properties of surfaces treated with PAH/PAA it was concluded that the {{development of}} strong adhesive joints is very dependent on the mobility of the polyelectrolytes and interdiffusion across the interface between the LbL treated surfaces to allow for polymer entanglements. Starch is a renewable, cost-efficient biopolymer that is already widely used in papermaking which makes it an interesting candidate for the formation of LbL films in practical systems. It was shown, using SPAR and QCM-D, that LbL films can be successfully constructed from cationic and <b>anionic</b> <b>starches</b> on silicon dioxide and on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrates. Colloidal probe AFM measurements showed that starch LbL treatment have potential for increasing the adhesive interaction between solid substrates to levels beyond those that can be reached by a single layer of cationic starch. Furthermore, it was shown by SIEBIMM measurements that the elastic properties of starch-containing LbL films can be tailored using different nanoparticles in combination with starch. LbL films containing cellulose I nanofibrils were constructed using anionic NFC in combination with cationic NFC and poly(ethylene imine) (PEI) respectively. These NFC films were used as cellulose model surfaces and colloidal probe AFM was used to measure the adhesive interactions in water. Furthermore, PDMS caps were successfully coated by LbL films containing NFC which enabled the first known JKR adhesion measurements between cellulose/cellulose, cellulose/lignin and cellulose/glucomannan. The measured adhesion and adhesion hysteresis were similar for all three systems indicating that there are no profound differences in the interaction between different wood biopolymers. Finally, the elastic properties of PEI/NFC LbL films were investigated using SIEBIMM and it was shown that the stiffness of the films was highly dependent on the relative humidity.

40|$|Surface sizing {{of paper}} by <b>anionic</b> <b>starch</b> were carried out {{with the aim of}} its {{concentration}} effect on physical and strength properties of recycled paper. For this, hand sheets (100 GSM) of mixed recycled pulp containing 1 % cationic starch were prepared and were treated by the sizing agent on the sheet surface at various concentration (0, 3 - 10 %). Application and concentration increment of the starch solution caused its higher retention on the surface and lesser penetration into the paper structure (Z direction), contributed to the better hydrophobicity of sized paper and significantly reduction in water absorption of the paper, with the highest reduction in the Cobb test up to the solution concentration of 5 %. Also, the results revealed that regarding to absorption and its increment into the paper surface combined to penetration to the paper thickness, strength properties of bending stiffness, burst and tensile indices have been increased which the improvement rate were more predominant up to the 5 % cons. Penetration of a part of sizing agent into the porous structure of paper and resulted improvement in fiber bonding are possible and probable, that higher concentration and viscosity of the starch solution contributed to the lesser penetration and bonding formation with higher retention on the paper surface which resulted in continuous improvement in paper smoothness. With the sizing solution thickening, tear index decreased due to starch film formation on the paper surface with brittle character. In general, increasing of the <b>anionic</b> <b>starch</b> solution up to the 5 % could be reported as an optimum level...|$|E

In addition, drug loading and releasing properties were investigated with Methylene Blue as a model drug {{on the basis of}} single-factor study. It was found that the loading ratio of MB was significantly influenced by loading time, dissolution medium, loading temperature as well as MB concentration (P < 0. 05). Either the increase of loading time or drug concentration could lead to the increase of drug loading amount of microspheres, however, drug loading amount reached its maximum in NaCl (0. 9 %) dissolution medium at room temperature. Furthermore, the release profile contained two main expulsion processes: an initial burst release followed by a sustained swelling-controlled release...|$|E
40|$|Carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) are protein domains {{located within}} a carbohydrate-active enzyme, with a {{discrete}} fold {{that can be}} separated from the catalytic domain. Starch-binding domains (SBDs) are CBMs that are usually found at the C-terminus in many amylolytic enzymes. The SBD from Aspergillus niger B 1 (CMI CC 324262) was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli as an independent domain and the recombinant protein was purified on starch. The A. niger B 1 SBD was found to be similar to SBD from A. kawachii, A. niger var. awamori and A. shirusami (95 - 96 % identity) and was classified {{as a member of the}} CBM family 20. Characterization of SBD binding to starch indicated that it is essentially irreversible and that its affinity to cationic or <b>anionic</b> <b>starch,</b> as well as to potato or corn starch, does not differ significantly. These observations indicate that the fundamental binding area on these starches is essentially the same. Natural and chemically modified starches are among the most useful biopolymers employed in the industry. Our study demonstrates that SBD binds effectively to both anionic and cationic starch...|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} the study was {{investigation}} of influence of substituent type on the properties of starch derivates in diluted solutions. Three samples were prepared: two <b>anionic</b> (carboxymethyl <b>starch,</b> CMS) and one cationic starch (KS). Starch derivates were synthesized in two steps. The first step was preparation of alkali starch by the addition of sodium-hydroxide to the starch dispersed in ethanol or water. In the second step, the required amount of sodium monocloracetate or 3 -chloro- 2 -hydroxypropyl-threemethylamonium chloride was added to the obtained alkali starch in order to prepare CMS or KS, respectively. The degree of substitution of carboxymethyl starch was determined by back titration method, and the degree of substitution of cationic starch was determined by potentiometric titration. The degrees of substitution of prepared samples were: 0. 50 (assigned as CMS- 0. 50) and 0. 70 (assigned as CMS- 0. 70) for carboxymethyl starch and 0. 30 (assigned as KS- 0. 30) for cationic starch. The properties of starch derivatives in dilute solutions were investigated by the methods of static and dynamic light scattering. Aqueous solutions of sodium chloride of different concentrations were used as solvent. The values of the mass average molar mass, MW, radius of gyration, Rg, and second virial coefficient, A 2, were determined for all samples together with hydrodynamic radius, Rh. Molar masses of the samples were: 5. 06 × 106, 15. 4 × 106 and 19. 2 × 106 g/mol for CMS- 0. 50, CMS- 0. 70 and KS- 0. 30, respectively. The samples, CMS- 0. 70 and KS- 0. 30 had similar molar mass and hydrodynamic radius, but radius of gyration of KS- 0. 30 was smaller then radius of gyration of CMS- 0. 70 at all sodium chloride concentrations. Consequently, ρ value for KS- 0. 30 was smaller then for CMS- 0. 70, as a result of more compact architecture of KS- 0. 30 then of CMS- 0. 70. Kratky graph confirmed this result. For all samples, radius of gyration and hydrodynamic radius decreased with increasing of sodium chloride concentration, but decrease of the radius was greater for CMS- 0. 50 then for other two samples due to its significantly lower molar mass. On the other hand, change of both radius of gyration and hydrodynamic radius of CMS- 0. 70 and of KS- 0. 30 with increasing sodium chloride concentration were similar. It can be concluded that the decrease of both Rg and Rh with increasing sodium chloride concentration in water depends far more on molar mass than on degree of substitution...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we {{investigate}} the interactions between cationic nanoparticles and <b>anionic</b> <b>starch,</b> where the starch was composed of 20 wt% of amylose, a linear polymer, and 80 wt% of amylopectin, a branched polymer. The mechanism of aggregation was investigated by scattering techniques. It {{was found that the}} cationic particles formed large aggregates with the starch as a result of selective adsorption of the amylopectin. Amylose did not participate significantly in the aggregate formation even when the charge ratio of starch to particles was < 1. For starch to particle ratio 41 stabilization was recovered mostly due to the large hindrance brought about by the highly branched amylopectin. This results in a shift of the stabilization mechanism from electrostatic to electrosteric. The internal structure of the aggregates was composed of primary particles with starch coils adsorbed on the surface. This information supports the proposed aggregation mechanism, which is based on adsorption of the negatively charged starch in patches on the positively charged nanoparticles causing attractive interaction between the particles...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (PhD (Chemistry and Polymer Science)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2008. Polysaccharides were {{modified}} with selected polymers via the grafting technique. Both anionic and cationic polysaccharides were prepared. Random and crosslinked graft copolymers {{were also}} prepared. The percentage grafting {{was determined by}} gravimetric analysis and results were confirmed by cross-polarization magic angle spinning carbon- 13 nuclear magnetic resonance microscopy (CP/MAS 13 C NMR). These modified biodegradable polymers were then used to flocculate precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC). The effects of pH, percentage grafting, crosslinker concentration and polysaccharide concentration on PCC flocculation were evaluated. Furthermore, the effects of anionic and cationic starch, either added to PCC sequentially or simultaneously, on PCC flocculation were also investigated. Generally, anionically modified starch showed excellent flocculation properties, which are desirable for the end application of PCC retention. The effect of polyacrylic acid (PAA) and polyacrylamide (PAM) modified cellulose fibers on calcium carbonate crystal nucleation and growth modification was investigated. When the heterogeneous crystallization of CaCO 3 {{was carried out in}} the presence of modified cellulose fibers the CaCO 3 crystals were found to be residing {{on the surface of the}} fibers. The morphologies of the crystallized CaCO 3, polymorph and fiber surface coverage were different for cellulose materials grafted with polymers of different functionalities, meaning that there is interaction between the crystal growth modifier and the growing nuclei. The effect of the modified starch on the crystallization of calcium carbonate gave useful insight into designing CaCO 3 filler morphologies. It was found that the filler size, morphology and surface properties of fillers can be tailor-made by choosing suitable CaCO 3 crystallization conditions as well as a suitable crystal growth modifier. The crystallized CaCO 3 had a negatively charged surface. Results of fluorescence studies showed that the PAA modified starch (polymeric additive used) resided on the surface of the crystals. Thus the presence of the polysaccharide on the surface of a filler could be advantageous for strengthening fiber–filler bonding in paper applications. <b>Anionic</b> <b>starch</b> materials were also used to prepare anionic-starch-coated starch particles. Both the <b>anionic</b> <b>starch</b> and anionic-starch-coated starch particles were evaluated for PCC retention and other properties of hand sheets. When anionic-starch-coated starch particles were used there was generally an improvement in the PCC retention, while the other paper properties remained desirable. The success achieved with the use of anionic-starch-coated starch particles now opens the way for the further preparation and testing of various modified starch particles, for optimization of filler retention...|$|E

The combination of cationic nanoparticles in suspension and <b>anionic</b> <b>starch</b> in solution {{gave rise to}} aggregate formation which was studied by dynamic light scattering, revealing the initial adsorption of the starch molecules on the particle surface. By examining the stability ratio, W, {{it was found that}} even in the most destabilized state, i. e. at charge neutralization, the starch chains had induced steric stabilization to the system. At higher particle and starch concentrations relaxation of the aggregates could be seen, as monitored by a decrease in turbidity with time. This relaxation was evaluated by fitting the data to the Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts function. It was found that irrespective of the starch to particle charge ratio the relaxation time was similar. Moreover, a molecular weight dependence on the relaxation time was found, as well as a more pronounced initial aggregated state for the higher molecular weight starch. This initial aggregate state could be due to bridging flocculation. With time, as the starch chains have relaxed into a final conformation on the particle surface, bridging will be less important and is gradually replaced by patches that will cause patchwise flocculation. After an equilibration time no molecular weight dependence on aggregation could be seen, which confirms the patchwise flocculation mechanism...|$|E
40|$|Jessica Sjöberg and Hans Höglund at Fibre Science and Communication Network, Mid Sweden University, have {{developed}} a refining technique to produce unbleached kraft pulp with high strain at break and tensile energy adsorption index. In another project at Fibre Science and Communication Network, Gunilla Petterson and Lars Wågberg {{have developed}} a strategy for formation of polyelectrolyte multilayers on cellulose fibres. This method increases the joint strength between fibres. The aim of this thesis work was to use the two techniques mentioned above and to optimize {{them in order to}} produce a paper with both high tensile index and strain at break. In this study high consistency refined pulp from an atmospheric and a pressurized refiner was low consistency refined in an Escher-Wyss laboratory refiner to a SR-number between 17, 5 - 20, 5. Ordinary ISO-sheets and freely dried sheets were manufactured from those pulp samples. The laboratory sheets made from pulp samples from the pressurized system had higher strain at break and tensile energy adsorption index but lower tensile index compared to sheets from the pulp sample refined in a conventional atmospheric high consistency system. ISO-sheets and freely dried sheets were also made from refined pulp samples whose fibres had been coated with one or three layers of polymer. Polyelectrolyte multilayers were built by sequential provision of <b>anionic</b> <b>starch</b> and cationic CMC. Three different stock preparation strategies were used for the provision of polymer. Adsorption equilibrium was determined indirectly by charge titration of non-adsorbed polyelectrolyte in a particle charge detector. Physical paper properties of the sheets showed that the addition of only one layer of starch increased strain at break, tensile index, tensile energy adsorption index and Scott-Bond significantly. By using the multilayer technique tensile index could be increased further compared to sheets from fibres with one single starch layer, however, no major positive effects on strain at break and tensile energy adsorption index was obtained. When the fibres were treated with multilayers Scott-Bond, which {{is a measure of the}} internal bonding strength, increased dramatically compared to the samples with one layer of starch.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{influence}} of molecular adhesion on paper strength. By combining the use of high-resolution techniques and silica/cellulose surfaces, with various fibre–fibre and sheet testing techniques, new information regarding the molecular mechanisms responsible for paper strength has been obtained. Large parts of this research were devoted to the polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) technique, i. e. a charged surface is consecutively treated with oppositely charged polyelectrolytes. Application of PEMs incorporating polyallylamine hydrochloride (PAH) and polyacrylic acid (PAA) onto dried, fully bleached softwood fibres, prior to sheet preparation, increased tensile strength. No linear relationship was detected between the amounts of PAH and PAA adsorbed onto the fibres and the developed tensile strength, {{which suggests that the}} adsorbed amount is not the only important factor determining the tensile strength. Closer examination of PEM formation on silica indicated that both exponential PEM film growth and the occurrence of a PEM film in which the polyelectrolytes are highly mobile, favour the strength-enhancing properties of sheets containing PEM-treated fibres. This indicates that a water-rich, soft PEM film allows the polyelectrolytes to diffuse into each other, creating a stronger fibre–fibre joint during consolidation, pressing, and drying of the paper. In addition, when PAH capped the PEM film, the paper strength was higher than when PAA capped the film; this could be related to the structure of the adsorbed layer. Further analysis of the sheets revealed that the increase in tensile strength can also be linked to an increase in the degree of contact within a fibre–fibre joint, the number of efficient joints, and the formation of covalent bonds. The relative bonded area (RBA) in the sheets, as determined using light-scattering measurements, indicated no significant change until a certain tensile strength was obtained. The RBA, as determined using nitrogen adsorption via BET analysis, did show significant changes over the whole investigated tensile strength range. From this it can be concluded that light scattering cannot give any direct information regarding molecular interactions within a sheet. Furthermore, it was shown that PEMs involving cationic and <b>anionic</b> <b>starch</b> display an almost linear relationship with out-of-plane strength properties regarding the amount of starch in the sheets, whereas the tensile strength was more dependent on the physical properties of the starch, {{as was the case with}} PAH and PAA. Cationic dextran (DEX) and hydrophobically modified cationic dextran (HDEX) were used to test the importance of having compatible surface layers in order to obtain strong adhesive joints. DEX and HDEX phase separated in solution, however, this incompatibility of HDEX:DEX mixtures was not reflected in wet or dry joint strength. For both wet and dry measurements, adhesion between DEX and HDEX coated surfaces was intermediate to the adhesion of DEX:DEX and HDEX:HDEX surfaces. In addition, various types of cellulose surfaces, different regarding their crystallinity, were investigated. Depending on the preparation techniques and solution conditions used, i. e. pH and salt concentration, steric, electrostatic, and van der Waals interactions were obtained between the surfaces in aqueous solutions. The adhesion forces between polydimethylsiloxane and cellulose surfaces, measured under ambient conditions, were influenced by the degree of crystallinity. This suggests that amorphous cellulose offers more possibilities for surface groups to arrange themselves to participate in molecular interactions in the joint. Higher relative humidity could increase this adhesion force further, water probably acting as a plasticizer during joint formation. QC 2011012...|$|E
40|$|Studies on {{strength}} {{delivery and}} related fields {{have so far}} concentrated on finding the locations in the mill where fibres are damaged and what the damages consist of. However, fibres will invariably encounter mechanical stresses along the fibreline and in this thesis a new concept is introduced; the vulnerability of fibres to mechanical treatment. It is hypothesised that fibres with different properties have different abilities to withstand the mechanical forces they endure as they are discharged from the digester and transported through valves, pumps and various washing and bleaching equipment. In the thesis, results are presented from trials where pulps with significantly different hemicellulose compositions were high-intensity mixed at pH 13, 70 °C and 10 % pulp consistency and pulp strength evaluated. By varying alkalinity and temperature, pulps with different carbohydrate composition could be obtained. High alkali concentration and low temperature resulted in high glucomannan content and low xylan content, whereas cooking at low alkali concentration and high temperature rendered a pulp with low glucomannan and high xylan content. The high alkalinity pulp was stronger, determined as tear index at given tensile index. The pulp viscosity was also higher for this pulp. However, when the pulps were subjected to high-intensity mixing, the high alkalinity pulp lost in tear strength and the re-wetted zero-span tensile strength was substantially reduced. The pulp cooked at high alkalinity was thus interpreted as being more vulnerable to mechanical treatment than the pulp obtained by cooking at low alkalinity. Another pair of pulps was manufactured at high and low sodium ion concentrations, but otherwise with similar chemical charges. The pulp obtained by cooking at low sodium ion concentration became stronger, evaluated as tear index at a given tensile index and the curl index was substantially lower, 8 % compared to 12 % for the pulp cooked at a high sodium ion concentration. The viscosity was 170 ml/g higher for the pulp manufactured at low sodium ion concentration. When the pulps were subjected to high-intensity mixing, the tear strength of the pulp manufactured at high sodium ion concentration was reduced. The re-wetted zero-span tensile index decreased also after mixing. The pulp obtained by cooking at higher sodium ion concentration was thus interpreted as being more vulnerable to mechanical treatment than the pulp manufactured at lower sodium ion concentration. In the thesis, two reasons for the low strength delivery of industrially produced pulps compared to laboratory-cooked pulps are put forward. Since the ionic strength of mill cooking liquor systems {{is much higher than}} is normally used in laboratory cooking, this can partly explain the difference in strength between mill- and laboratory-cooked pulp. A higher sodium ion concentration was shown in this thesis work to give a pulp of lower strength. Secondly, it is suggested that the difference in retention time of the black liquor in laboratory cooking and continuous mill cooking systems can explain the difference in tensile strength between laboratory-cooked and mill-produced pulp. The black liquor in a continuous digester has a longer retention time in the digester than the chips. This gives a longer time for the dissolved xylan to degrade and, as a consequence, the xylan deposited on the mill pulp fibres will be more degraded than the xylan deposited on the laboratory-cooked pulp fibres. In the thesis, results are also presented from studies using different strength-enhancing chemicals. The fibre surfaces of bleached never-dried and once-dried pulp were modified by the polyelectrolyte multilayer technique using cationic and <b>anionic</b> <b>starch.</b> Although the pulps absorbed the same amount of starch, the never-dried pulp reached a higher tensile index than the once-dried pulp. When the starch-treated never-dried pulp was dried and reslushed it still had higher tensile index than the never-dried untreated pulp. The starch layers were thus able to counteract part of the hornification effect. The never-dried starch treated pulps were subsequently dried, reslushed and beaten. Pulp with starch layers had a better beatability evaluated as the tensile index obtained after given number of PFI revolutions than dried untreated pulp. Hence, there is a potential to increase the tensile index of market pulp by utilising the polyelectrolyte multilayer technique before drying. Addition of CMC to bleached mill pulp and laboratory-cooked pulp increased the tensile strength to the same degree for both pulps. CMC addition had a straightening effect on the fibres, the shape factor increased and this increased the zero-span tensile strength also. QC 2010051...|$|E
