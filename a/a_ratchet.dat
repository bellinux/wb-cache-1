25|$|Beginner slacklines are {{generally}} of two varieties: primitive slackline or ratchet slackline. A primitive slackline uses carabiners {{to form a}} simple pulley system and friction lock to tension the slackline,. <b>A</b> <b>ratchet</b> slackline uses a comealong or ratchet to tension the slackline.|$|E
25|$|The CMAS Self-Rescue Diver {{training}} {{includes the}} deployment of colour-coded DSMBs –– red for position indication, and yellow to indicate a problem –- the use of <b>a</b> <b>ratchet</b> dive reel to control ascent rate {{in the event of}} unplanned positive buoyancy due to loss of weights, and the use of a backup mask.|$|E
25|$|Another form of ascent {{which may}} be {{considered}} an emergency ascent is a tethered-ascent – where the diver has unintentionally lost full control of buoyancy due {{to a loss of}} ballast weight, and controls ascent rate by use of <b>a</b> <b>ratchet</b> dive reel {{with the end of the}} reel line secured to the bottom.|$|E

25|$|A socket wrench, more {{commonly}} referred to as <b>a</b> <b>ratchet,</b> is a type of wrench, or tightening tool, that uses separate, removable sockets to fit many different sizes of fittings and fasteners, most commonly nuts and bolts. The ratchet wrench was invented by J.J. Richardson of Woodstock, Vermont, receiving a patent for the ratchet wrench from the Scientific American Patent Agency on June 18, 1863.|$|E
25|$|The ratchet {{clutch system}} uses <b>a</b> <b>ratchet</b> and pawl {{to hold the}} pedal in place. The timpanist must first {{disengage}} the clutch before using the pedal to tune the drum. When the desired pitch is achieved, the timpanist must then reengage the clutch. Because the ratchet engages in only a fixed set of positions, the timpanist must fine-tune the drum {{by means of a}} fine-tuning handle.|$|E
25|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1949 (as {{unveiled}} {{and demonstrated}} in October at the Motor Cycle Show at Earls Court, London) an optional mechanical reversing device became available which comprised a long lever with <b>a</b> <b>ratchet</b> and a hexagonal socket on the end which fitted onto {{the centre of the}} driver's side rear wheel hub. This device could then be operated from the driving seat and allowed the car to be cranked backwards by hand to assist with maneuvering.|$|E

5000|$|A freehub {{is a type}} of bicycle hub that {{incorporates}} <b>a</b> <b>ratcheting</b> mechanism, and the name freehub is a registered trademark of Shimano. A set of sprockets (called a [...] "cassette") are mounted onto a splined shaft of the freehub to engage the chain. The <b>ratcheting</b> mechanism is <b>a</b> part of the hub, in contrast to a freewheel, an older technology, which contains both the sprockets and <b>a</b> <b>ratcheting</b> mechanism in <b>a</b> single unit separate from the hub. In many high-end and midrange bicycles, freehubs have replaced freewheel systems.|$|R

25|$|Each train {{consists}} of a locomotive pushing a single passenger car up the mountain, descending the mountain by going backwards. Both locomotive and car were originally equipped with <b>a</b> <b>ratchet</b> and pawl mechanism engaged during the climb that prevents any roll-back; during descent, both locomotive and car are braked. Recent improvements in design have replaced the ratchet (gear and pawl mechanism) with sprag clutches and disc brake assemblies. Most of the locomotives {{were made by the}} Manchester Locomotive Works.|$|E
25|$|This {{exported}} energy may {{be accounted}} for in the simplest case by the meter running backwards during periods of net export, thus reducing the customer's recorded energy usage by the amount exported. This in effect results in the customer being paid for his/her exports at the full retail price of electricity. Unless equipped with <b>a</b> <b>ratchet</b> or equivalent, a standard meter will accurately record power flow in each direction by simply running backwards when power is exported. Where allowed by law, utilities maintain a profitable margin between the price of energy delivered to the consumer and the rate credited for consumer-generated energy that flows back to the grid.|$|E
25|$|In 1836, an American, Samuel Colt {{patented}} {{the mechanism}} {{that led to}} the widespread use of the revolver, the mechanically indexing cylinder. According to Samuel Colt, he {{came up with the idea}} for the revolver while at sea, inspired by the capstan, which had <b>a</b> <b>ratchet</b> and pawl mechanism on it, a version of which was used in his guns to rotate the cylinder by cocking the hammer. This provided a reliable and repeatable way to index each round and did away with the need to manually rotate the cylinder. Revolvers proliferated largely due to Colt's ability as a salesman. But his influence spread in other ways as well; the build quality of his company's guns became famous, and its armories in America and England trained several seminal generations of toolmakers and other machinists, who had great influence in other manufacturing efforts of the next half century.|$|E

30|$|The results {{obtained}} by Bousias et al. (1992) present a strong coupling between the axial and transverse directions. For {{the relatively low}} levels of compressive axial loads considered therein, deflections induce an axial extension which has a magnitude roughly proportional to their resultant vector. For lower compressive loads, the cycling of transverse forces or deflections causes a gradual shortening in the axial direction under the axial load alone, <b>a</b> <b>ratcheting</b> extension that rapidly turns into shortening when failure is imminent. As a result of axial/lateral forces coupling, the cycling of the axial force below the balance load causes <b>a</b> <b>ratcheting</b> increase in the deflection under constant transverse force.|$|R

25|$|The {{preliminary}} hearing opened on December 11, 2006, with Reiser being represented by attorney William Du Bois. At the hearing, a forensic technician testified that blood matching Nina Reiser's DNA {{had been found}} on a bag in Hans Reiser's car, and on a pillar in his mother's (Beverly Palmer's) house, {{where he had been}} living since the separation. It later emerged that a mistake had been made when the police analysed the blood on the pillar, rendering the evidence inconclusive. Police also testified that they had found a 40-piece socket set which may have been used to remove the passenger seat, a receipt for the purchase of the socket set from Kragen Auto Parts, four seat bolts, and <b>a</b> <b>ratchet</b> wrench with a socket on it, suggesting that the seat may have been removed recently. A traffic officer who had pulled Reiser over nine days after Reiser's wife went missing testified later in the trial that the passenger seat had been present at the time, and that he had not seen any blood.|$|E
25|$|While DNA {{is able to}} {{recombine}} {{to modify}} alleles, DNA is also susceptible to mutations within the sequence that can affect an organism in a negative manner. Asexual organisms {{do not have the}} ability to recombine their genetic information to form new and differing alleles. Once a mutation occurs in the DNA or other genetic carrying sequence, there is no way for the mutation to be removed from the population until another mutation occurs that ultimately deletes the primary mutation. This is rare among organisms. Hermann Joseph Muller introduced the idea that mutations build up in asexual reproducing organisms. Muller described this occurrence by comparing the mutations that accumulate as <b>a</b> <b>ratchet.</b> Each mutation that arises in asexually reproducing organisms turns the ratchet once. The ratchet is unable to be rotated backwards, only forwards. The next mutation that occurs turns the ratchet once more. Additional mutations in a population continually turn the ratchet and the mutations, mostly deleterious, continually accumulate without recombination. These mutations are passed onto the next generation because the offspring are exact genetic clones of their parent. The genetic load of organisms and their populations will increase due to the addition of multiple deleterious mutations and decrease the overall reproductive success and fitness.|$|E

A submissive fox {{approached by a}} dominant animal will emit a ululating siren-like shriek. During aggressive encounters with conspecifics, they emit a throaty rattling sound, similar to <b>a</b> <b>ratchet,</b> called [...] "gekkering". Gekkering occurs mostly during the courting season from rival males or vixens rejecting advances.|$|E

500|$|Ratchet & Clank is {{a series}} of action-adventure games with {{platform}} elements. Players mostly take control of Ratchet as he progresses through various planets in order to save the galaxy. Clank is also playable in several segments of these games. The series is divided into 2 parts; the original series for the PlayStation 2 (Ratchet & Clank (2002), [...] (2003), [...] (2004) and [...] (2005)) and the Future series for the PlayStation 3 ( [...] (2007), [...] (2008), [...] (2009) and [...] (2013)). The first three titles in the series were remastered and packaged in the Ratchet & Clank Collection for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita, with Ratchet & Clank (2016) being the latest release on the PlayStation 4. <b>A</b> <b>Ratchet</b> & Clank animated film, with screenplay and additional marketing by Insomniac, was released in 2016 as well, to coincide with the release of the video game remake.|$|E
500|$|The handle {{material}} of the CQC-6 {{is composed of}} two titanium liners utilizing a Walker linerlock and a single or double detent as the locking mechanism, although one experimental model exists with <b>a</b> <b>ratchet</b> lock. [...] Titanium bolsters make up the front half of the knife with the back half represented by linen micarta scales. The reasons for using titanium as a linerlock material were due to its memory characteristics and corrosion resistance. [...] The screws in the handle, and pivot are traditional straight-head screws to accommodate easy disassembly in the field with an improvised tool, if needed. [...] Most models feature traction grooves for a more secure grip in a wet environment and a chamfered lockface. Early knives were made with black linen micarta and later models featured a proprietary green color made exclusively for Emerson. [...] A pocket clip {{held in place by}} three screws allows the knife to be clipped to a pocket, web-gear, or MOLLE.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most common}} {{use for a}} parking brake is to keep a vehicle {{motionless}} when it is parked.
