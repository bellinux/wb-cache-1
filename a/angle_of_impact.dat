2500|$|All {{wreckage}} {{was found}} along a 209 metre long, 50 metre wide {{section of the}} seabed {{at a depth of}} 78 metres. Investigators found no evidence of structural failure inflight. The damage to the aircraft was roughly symmetrical left-to-right, indicating the aircraft was close to wings-level flight on impact. The separation of the left landing gear leg compared to the bending of the right leg suggested to investigators that impact with the water happened with the left wing slightly lower than the right, as the left gear was the more damaged, and therefore subject to more force against the water. When the left wingtip contacted the water, investigators conclude that the aircraft cartwheeled, bringing the right wing down into the water with great force, which they report as being consistent with the nose gear being bent to the right as well as aft. The pattern of damage to the nose and the underside of the fuselage suggests the aircraft was in a slightly nose-down attitude, as if in a normal descent. Nearly neutral trim settings indicated the pilot was not trying to compensate for some abnormal flying condition, such as an engine failure or flight control problems. The pitch trim was set to a slight nose-down attitude, which the aircraft manufacturer calculated to indicate stable flight at 110–120 kts. This is consistent with investigators' calculations based on the damage to the aircraft that it had been moving at 90–130 kts at impact. Damage to the propeller blades is consistent with both of them turning and similar engine power being delivered to them. The amount of power being delivered to the propellers could not be determined. Therefore, it remains possible that ice had accumulated in the carburetors and reduced engine power.

The variation in crater depth, length, and diameter with impact angle is presented and discussed. While the main dependence on impact angle {{is found to be}} of a cos theta nature, cases are found where the magnitude of the dependence changes at discrete <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>impact.</b> This is interpreted as evidence of disruption of the projectile affecting the final size of the crater. Crater depth is found to depend on (cos theta) (n), where n is strongly dependent on the projectile density and not the traditionally assumed constant value of two-thirds. For aluminum impacting aluminum at 5 km s(- 1), n is found to be near unity. Reproducing the criteria used in analysis of crater shape in published work for the Long Duration Exposure Facility satellite yields a mean density for small particles in Low Earth Orbit of 3400 kg m(- 3).

40|$|Particle erosion is a wear {{loss from}} surface of solid body {{caused by a}} {{relative}} motion of fluid with solid particles.

In particular, we have studied the effects of using an undulating surface of the collector, and analyzed its effects taking into account the effect on <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> incidence <b>of</b> <b>impacting</b> rays. Using as a test vehicle a two-stage depressed collector for a 1. 5 -MW 110 -GHz gyrotron, we have thus been able to increase the estimated collector efficiency from 62 % to 65 %.
