5|$|A {{detachment}} of 18 {{men of the}} 1st The Royal Dragoons, commanded by Captain Methuen, arrived in Ely from Bury on 23 May in the late afternoon. They marched through the streets as <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>of</b> <b>force,</b> remaining all night. The following afternoon, 24 May, the troops marched on Littleport, led by Sir Henry Bate Dudley and John Bacon, a Bow Street constable. They were followed by the Royston troop of volunteer yeomanry cavalry summoned earlier by Henry Law, and a militia of gentlemen and inhabitants of Ely.|$|E

5|$|France, Russia and the United Kingdom {{recognised}} {{the autonomy}} of Greece, which remained a vassal state of the Ottoman Empire. The three powers agreed to a limited intervention in order to convince the Porte to accept {{the terms of the}} convention. A plan to send a naval expedition as <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>of</b> <b>force</b> was proposed and adopted. A joint Russian, French and British fleet was sent to exercise diplomatic pressure against Constantinople. The Battle of Navarino (October 1827), fought after a chance encounter, resulted in the destruction of the Turkish-Egyptian fleet.|$|E
5|$|Muhammad and the Muslims {{buried the}} {{dead on the}} battlefield, {{returning}} home that evening. The Meccans retired for the evening {{at a place called}} Hamra al-Asad, a few miles away from Medina. The next morning, Muhammad sent out a small force to harass the Meccan army on their way home. According to Watt, this was because Muhammad realized that <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>of</b> <b>force</b> was required to speed the Meccans away from Medinan territory. The Meccans, not wanting to be perceived as being chased away, remained nearby for a few days before leaving.|$|E
5|$|This defeat infuriated the Caliph, who {{prepared}} a new expedition. Intended as <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>of</b> <b>force</b> {{and a clear}} display of the Caliphate's superiority, {{it was the largest}} army sent against Byzantium {{in the second half of}} the 8th century: it allegedly comprised 95,793 men, about twice the total Byzantine military establishment present in Asia Minor, and cost the Abbasid state some 1.6 million nomismata, almost as much as the Byzantine Empire's entire annual income. Harun was the nominal leader, but the Caliph took care to send experienced officers to accompany him.|$|E

5|$|Violence erupted {{again in}} early May 1995. The RSK lost {{support from the}} Serbian {{government}} in Belgrade, {{partly as a result}} of international pressure. At the same time, the Croatian Operation Flash reclaimed all of the previously occupied territory in Western Slavonia. In retaliation, Serb forces attacked Zagreb with rockets, killing 7 and wounding over 200 civilians. The Yugoslav army responded to the offensive with <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>of</b> <b>force,</b> moving tanks towards the Croatian border, in an apparent effort to stave off a possible attack on the occupied area in Eastern Slavonia.|$|E
5|$|Andrea Doria and Caio Duilio both cruised in {{the eastern}} Mediterranean after the war, and both were {{involved}} in postwar disputes over control of various cities. Caio Duilio was sent to provide <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>of</b> <b>force</b> during a dispute over control of İzmir in April 1919 and Andrea Doria assisted in the suppression of Gabriele D'Annunzio's seizure of Fiume in November 1920. Caio Duilio cruised the Black Sea after the İzmir affair until she was replaced in 1920 by the battleship Giulio Cesare. Andrea Doria and Caio Duilio were present during the Corfu incident in 1923 {{as part of the}} naval demonstration protesting the murder of General Enrico Tellini and four other Italians. In January 1925, Andrea Doria visited Lisbon, Portugal, to represent Italy during the celebration marking the 400th anniversary of the death of explorer Vasco da Gama. The two ships performed the normal routine of peacetime cruises and goodwill visits throughout the 1920s and early 1930s; both were placed in reserve in 1933.|$|E
5|$|As the Soviet Army {{pushed the}} Wehrmacht {{back on the}} Eastern Front, it became {{necessary}} to reactivate Prinz Eugen as a gunnery support vessel; on 1 October 1943, the ship was reassigned to combat duty. In June 1944, Prinz Eugen, the heavy cruiser Lützow, and the 6th Destroyer Flotilla formed the Second Task Force, later renamed Task Force Thiele after its commander, Vizeadmiral August Thiele. Prinz Eugen was at this time {{under the command of}} KzS Hans-Jürgen Reinicke; throughout June she steamed in the eastern Baltic, northwest of the island of Utö as <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>of</b> <b>force</b> during the German withdrawal from Finland. On 19–20 August, the ship steamed into the Gulf of Riga and bombarded Tukums. Four destroyers and two torpedo boats supported the action, along with Prinz Eugens Ar 196 floatplanes; the cruiser fired a total of 265 shells from her main battery. Prinz Eugens bombardment was instrumental in the successful repulse of the Soviet attack.|$|E
50|$|In 109, South Xiongnu, {{which had}} been a loyal vassal up to this point, rebelled as well, believing that Han had been so {{weakened}} by Qiang rebellions {{that it would be}} easy target. However, after Han made <b>a</b> strong <b>show</b> <b>of</b> <b>force,</b> South Xiongnu submitted again and would not become a trouble spot for the rest of Han Dynasty.|$|R
50|$|They {{were soon}} making {{preparations}} for <b>a</b> combined <b>show</b> <b>of</b> <b>force.</b> Under the wary {{eyes of the}} Japanese, fifteen British warships rode anchor alongside four Dutch vessels, while a British regiment from Hong Kong augmented their display of military might. The French maintained a minimal naval presence, with the bulk <b>of</b> their <b>forces</b> in Mexico trying to bolster Emperor Maximilian's unstable regime.|$|R
50|$|For Chicago, MOBE {{originally}} planned for two large-scale marches {{and an end}} of convention rally at Soldier Field. The goal was originally <b>a</b> massive <b>show</b> <b>of</b> <b>force</b> outside the International Amphitheatre.

5|$|Ernest had {{the support}} of the {{previous}} Elector, now Salentin IX of Isenburg-Grenzau, Frederick, Duke of Saxe-Lauenburg, and, probably most important, several thousand Spanish troops hired by the pope. While representatives from the Cathedral chapter, the seven imperial electors, the emperor, and the pope tried to resolve differences around the negotiating table, first in Frankfurt am Main, and then in Muhlhausen in Westphalia, the armies of both sides rampaged throughout the southern portion of the Electorate, called the Oberstift, plundering abbeys and convents, burning villages and small cities, and destroying crops, bridges, and roads. None of the combatants were prepared to commit their troops in a fixed battle; it was far more lucrative, and safer as well, to use them in <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>of</b> <b>force,</b> intimidating the peasantry, besieging walled towns and small cities, and limiting trade and the sale of food-stuffs in the marketplaces.|$|E
5|$|Habsburg saw {{action at}} the Battle of Lissa in July 1866, though she was not {{significantly}} engaged during the battle. In 1870, she was used in <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>of</b> <b>force</b> {{to try to prevent}} the Italian annexation of Rome while the city's protector, France, was distracted with the Franco-Prussian War, though the Italians took the city regardless. The ship's armament was revised several times in the 1870s and 1880s, before she was ultimately withdrawn from frontline service and employed as a guard ship and a barracks ship in Pola in 1886. She served in this role until 1898 when she was stricken from the naval register and broken up for scrap in 18991900.|$|E
5|$|Harrison {{left the}} {{territory}} for business in Kentucky {{shortly after the}} meeting with Tecumseh, and secretary John Gibson was acting governor. Gibson, who had lived among the Miami tribe for many years, was quick to learn of Tecumseh's plans for war; he immediately called out the territory's militia and sent emergency letters calling {{for the return of}} Harrison. By mid-September, most of the militia regiments had formed. By then, Harrison had returned, accompanied by a small force of army regulars, and had taken command of the militia. Harrison had already communicated with his superiors in Washington, D.C., and he had been authorized to march against the confederacy in <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>of</b> <b>force,</b> in the hopes that its members would accept peace.|$|E
50|$|Nyah finally {{responds}} with <b>a</b> little <b>show</b> <b>of</b> <b>force.</b> First, she entices Professor Hennessy aboard her spaceship {{to view the}} technological marvels of Martian civilization, and with her raygun, she incinerates the Jamiesons’ hunchbacked handyman. She then adopts the two-pronged strategy of also kidnapping their young nephew, Tommy, and then turning her robot loose to vaporize much of the manor’s grounds.|$|R

5|$|In 1811, while Tecumseh was traveling, Harrison was {{authorized}} by Secretary of War William Eustis to march against the nascent confederation as <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>of</b> <b>force.</b> Harrison led {{an army of}} more than 1,000 men north, to intimidate the Shawnee into making peace. Instead, the tribes launched a surprise attack on Harrison's army early on November 7, in {{what became known as}} the Battle of Tippecanoe. Harrison defeated the tribal forces at Prophetstown, next to the Wabash and Tippecanoe Rivers. Harrison was hailed as a national hero and the battle became famous. However, his troops had greatly outnumbered the attackers, and suffered many more casualties during the battle.|$|E
5|$|On 16 December, Minnesota steamed out of Hampton Roads {{with the}} Great White Fleet for a circumnavigation of the globe. The cruise was {{intended}} as <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>of</b> <b>force</b> to Japan, the United States' rival in the Pacific, to assert the United States' status as a global naval power, and to convince Congress {{of the need to}} support increased naval expenditures. The fleet cruised south to the Caribbean and then to South America, making stops in Port of Spain, Rio de Janeiro, Punta Arenas, and Valparaíso, among other cities. After arriving in Mexico in March 1908, the fleet spent three weeks conducting gunnery practice. The fleet then resumed its voyage up the Pacific coast of the Americas, stopping in San Francisco and Seattle before crossing the Pacific to Australia, stopping in Hawaii on the way. Stops in the South Pacific included Melbourne, Sydney, and Auckland.|$|E
5|$|On Omega 3 {{they find}} several {{original}} sets from Star Trek, {{and most of}} the original cast with their bodies and eternal youth. An energy being named Melllvar appears and explains that he became an obsessed Star Trek fan after watching the dumped tapes over and over again. Melllvar gives Nimoy a body, and orders the actors and the Planet Express crew to participate in a Star Trek convention until the end of time. Welshie is killed in <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>of</b> <b>force</b> to force their obedience. While Melllvar forces the cast to perform his fan script, Bender, Leela and Fry escape in the Planet Express Ship. Fry convinces the crew to attack Melllvar to save the actors, but Melllvar destroys the ship's engine as he drags it back to the planet.|$|E

5|$|Project A119, {{also known}} as A Study of Lunar Research Flights, was a top-secret plan {{developed}} in 1958 by the United States Air Force.

If the explosive device detonated on the surface, not in a lunar crater, the flash of explosive light would have been faintly visible to people on earth with their naked eye, <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>of</b> <b>force</b> resulting in a possible boosting of domestic morale in the capabilities of the United States, a boost that was needed after the Soviet Union took an early lead in the Space Race and was also working on a similar project.|$|E
5|$|Resolution 1313 was a {{significant}} shift in attitude for UNAMSIL, away from its previous neutrality to support of the Sierra Leone government, a shift that made the governments of several troop-contributing nations uncomfortable. In particular, the governments of Jordan and India—two of the largest contributors, with nearly 5,000 troops between them serving with UNAMSIL—were moved to withdraw their forces. The withdrawal coincided {{with the end of}} the rainy season, after which there were fears that the RUF would resume its advance towards Freetown, and the UN and British government feared that UNAMSIL would be vulnerable. As a deterrent, the ARG was once more deployed off the coast, and was instructed to conduct amphibious landing demonstrations as <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>of</b> <b>force.</b>|$|E
5|$|Some historians {{argue that}} the British government's {{decision}} reflected what James Gelvin, Professor of Middle Eastern History at UCLA, calls 'patrician anti-Semitism' in the overestimation of Jewish power in both the United States and Russia. American Zionism was still in its infancy; in 1914 the Zionist Federation had a small budget of about $5,000 and only 12,000 members, despite an American Jewish population of three million. But the Zionist organizations had recently succeeded, following <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>of</b> <b>force</b> within the American Jewish community, in arranging a Jewish congress to debate the Jewish problem as a whole. This impacted British and French government estimates of {{the balance of power}} within the American Jewish public.|$|E

5|$|Most Native Americans in {{the region}} decided against joining the uprising, and so the {{conflict}} ended after U.S. officials responded with <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>of</b> military <b>force.</b> Ho-Chunk chiefs surrendered eight men {{who had participated in}} the violence, including Red Bird, who American officials believed to be the ringleader.
