The portable <b>access</b> <b>units</b> may also be mated to various non-personal devices such as cameras or environmental sensors for providing a method for setting up wireless sensor nets from which reported data may be accessed through the portable <b>access</b> <b>unit.</b> The reported data may alternatively be automatically logged at a remote computer for access and viewing through a portable <b>access</b> <b>unit,</b> including the user's own...|$|R

40|$|More {{customization}} {{and adaptation}} of coded data streams may {{be achieved by}} processing the information signal such that the various syntax structures obtained by pre-coding the information signal are placed into logical data packets, each of which being associated with a specific data packet type of a predetermined set of data packet types, and by defining a predetermined order of data packet types within one <b>access</b> <b>unit</b> of data packets. The consecutive <b>access</b> <b>units</b> in the data stream may, for example, correspond to different time portions of the information signal.; By defining the predetermined order among the data packet types it is possible, at decoder's side, to detect the borders between successive <b>access</b> <b>units</b> even when removable data packets are removed from the data stream on {{the way from the}} data stream source to the decoder without incorporation of any hints into the reminder of the data stream. Due to this, decoders surely detect the beginnings and endings of <b>access</b> <b>units</b> and therefore are not liable to a buffer overflow despite a removal of data packets from the data stream before arrival at the decoder...|$|R

30|$|The {{elementary}} concept at the NAL {{level is}} the NAL unit (NALU). An AVC NALU contains a header {{followed by a}} raw byte sequence payload. This header is made of a unique byte and includes a field to identify the type of NALU. A complete picture can be segmented into multiple NALUs, each carrying usually a coded slice or control information. The set of NALUs needed to decode a complete picture is called <b>access</b> <b>unit.</b> AVC introduces a special type of <b>access</b> <b>unit</b> called instantaneous decoding refresh (IDR), which can be identified through the inspection of the NALU header. A sequence of <b>access</b> <b>units</b> starting with an IDR can be decoded independent of any previous pictures in the bitstream. The maximum NALU size can be configured as a parameter of the encoder {{in order to be}} adjusted to the maximum transmission unit (MTU).|$|R
5000|$|A set of NAL {{units in}} a {{specified}} form {{is referred to}} as an <b>access</b> <b>unit.</b> The decoding of each <b>access</b> <b>unit</b> results in one decoded picture.Each <b>access</b> <b>unit</b> contains a set of VCL NAL units that together compose a primary coded picture. It may also be prefixed with an <b>access</b> <b>unit</b> delimiter to aid in locating the start of the <b>access</b> <b>unit.</b> Some supplemental enhancement information containing data such as picture timing information may also precede the primary coded picture.The primary coded picture consists of a set of VCL NAL units consisting of slices or [...] slice data partitions that represent the samples of the video picture.Following the primary coded picture may be some additional VCL NAL units that contain redundant representations of areas of the same video picture. These are referred to as redundant coded pictures, and are available for use by a decoder in recovering from loss or corruption of the data in the primary coded pictures. Decoders are not required to decode redundant coded pictures if they are present.Finally, if the coded picture is the last picture of a coded video sequence (a sequence of pictures that is independently decodable and uses only one sequence parameter set), an end of sequence NAL unit may be present to indicate the end of the sequence; and if the coded picture is the last coded picture in the entire NAL unit stream, an end of stream NAL unit may be present to indicate that the stream is ending.|$|R
