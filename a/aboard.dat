5|$|Casualty figures vary, {{ranging from}} two dead and one injury <b>aboard</b> Meteor and three wounded <b>aboard</b> Bouvet to only two Prussian sailors killed with ten killed and wounded on Bouvet. Meteor joined Bouvet in Havana, where the wounded men {{were taken to}} a hospital. The two dead <b>aboard</b> Meteor were buried in Havana, and a {{monument}} was later erected there. On 1 January 1871, Knorr was promoted {{to the rank of}} Korvettenkapitän (Corvette Captain), and two men were awarded the Iron Cross.|$|E
5|$|During their expeditions <b>aboard</b> Mir, {{the astronauts}} carried out various experiments, {{including}} growth of crops and crystals, and took hundreds {{of photographs of}} the Earth spinning serenely beneath them. They also assisted in the maintenance and repair of the aging station, following various incidents with fires, collisions, power losses, uncontrolled spins and toxic leaks. In all, the American astronauts would spend almost a thousand days <b>aboard</b> Mir, allowing NASA to {{learn a great deal}} about long-duration spaceflight, particularly in the areas of astronaut psychology and how best to arrange experiment schedules for crews <b>aboard</b> space stations.|$|E

5|$|In 1996, {{treasure}} hunter Brock Lovett and {{his team}} <b>aboard</b> the research vessel Akademik Mstislav Keldysh search the wreck of RMS Titanic for a necklace with a rare diamond, the Heart of the Ocean. They recover a safe containing a drawing {{of a young woman}} wearing only the necklace dated April 14, 1912, the day the ship struck the iceberg. Rose Dawson Calvert, the woman in the drawing, is brought <b>aboard</b> Keldysh and tells Lovett of her experiences <b>aboard</b> Titanic.|$|E
5|$|In March 2010, the Department of Defence {{revealed}} that the generators {{in five of the}} submarines were flawed and had to be replaced. The three Australian-made generators <b>aboard</b> each of the five submarines (the generators <b>aboard</b> Collins were French-built, and exhibited no defects) are to be replaced in the submarines as they come in for their next maintenance docking.|$|E
5|$|On July 4, The {{newly arrived}} crew of EO-19 undocked {{temporarily}} {{from the station}} <b>aboard</b> Soyuz TM-21 to observe and photograph {{the departure of the}} STS-71 and EO-18 crews <b>aboard</b> Atlantis. TM-21 undocked at 10:55 GMT, followed by STS-71 at 11:09:45 GMT. The EO-19 crew redocked <b>aboard</b> TM-21 at 11:39 GMT as Atlantis conducted a fly-around of the station. Atlantis, carrying the crews of EO-18 and STS-71, landed on July 7 after several more days in Earth orbit.|$|E
5|$|Polyakov was {{selected}} as a cosmonaut in Medical Group 3 on March 22, 1972. His first flight into space occurred on Soyuz TM-6 in 1988. After staying <b>aboard</b> the Mir space station and conducting research for 240 days, Polyakov returned to Earth <b>aboard</b> Soyuz TM-7.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{production}} {{appears to}} have ended about March 25, 1933. Van Dyke was back <b>aboard</b> a commercial ship, headed for California, while Frank Messenger (<b>aboard</b> the Nanuk) continued to shoot second unit footage for the next month or two.|$|E

5|$|The Shuttle–Mir Program was a {{collaborative}} space program between Russia and the United States, which involved American Space Shuttles visiting the Russian space station Mir, Russian cosmonauts flying on the shuttle, and an American astronaut flying <b>aboard</b> a Soyuz spacecraft {{to engage in}} long-duration expeditions <b>aboard</b> Mir.|$|E
5|$|The plot {{involves}} a couple, Annie and Alex, vacationing in the Caribbean <b>aboard</b> a luxury cruise ship, which is hijacked by a villain named Geiger. As they are trapped <b>aboard</b> the ship, Annie and Alex {{work with the}} ship's first officer {{to try to stop}} it after they discover it is programmed to crash into an oil tanker.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{instruments}} <b>aboard</b> CryoSat-2 are SIRAL-2, the SAR/Interferometric Radar Altimeters; {{which uses}} radar to determine and monitor the spacecraft's altitude {{in order to}} measure the elevation of the ice. Unlike the original CryoSat, two SIRAL instruments are installed <b>aboard</b> CryoSat-2, with one serving as a backup in case the other fails.|$|E
5|$|The two-man EO-21 {{crew was}} {{launched}} on 21 February 1996 <b>aboard</b> Soyuz TM-23 and were soon joined by US crew member Shannon Lucid, who {{was brought to}} the station by Atlantis during STS-76. This mission saw the first joint US spacewalk on Mir take place deploying the Mir Environmental Effects Payload package on the docking module. Lucid became the first American to carry out a long-duration mission <b>aboard</b> Mir with her 188-day mission, which set the US single spaceflight record. During Lucid's time <b>aboard</b> Mir, Priroda, the station's final module, arrived as did French visitor Claudie Haigneré flying the Cassiopée mission. The flight <b>aboard</b> Soyuz TM-24 also delivered the EO-22 crew of Valery Korzun and Aleksandr Kaleri.|$|E
5|$|After {{a futile}} attempt to {{approach}} Herald Island, the ship began the journey back to Alaska; {{next day she}} encountered Bear, with Bartlett <b>aboard.</b> McConnell records that the party were unanimous in their desire to remain with the ship that had effected their rescue, but Bartlett ordered them <b>aboard</b> Bear. Before returning to Alaska, Bear made a final attempt to reach Herald Island; ice limited their approach to , and they saw no signs of life. The reunited party arrived at Nome on 13 September, to a great welcome from the local population.|$|E
5|$|After the victory, a {{prize crew}} was put <b>aboard</b> Chesapeake. The {{commander}} of the prize, Lieutenant Falkiner, had {{a good deal of}} trouble from the restive Americans, who outnumbered his own men. He had some {{of the leaders of the}} unrest transferred to Shannon in the leg-irons that had, ironically, been shipped <b>aboard</b> Chesapeake to deal with expected British prisoners. The rest of the American crew were rendered docile by the expedient of a carpenter cutting scuttles (holes) in the maindeck through which two 18-pounder cannon, loaded with grapeshot, were pointed at them.|$|E

5|$|As far as is known, no radars were {{installed}} <b>aboard</b> Mutsu before her loss. While in drydock in May 1943, a Type 21 air-search radar was installed <b>aboard</b> Nagato {{on the roof}} of the 10-meter rangefinder at the top of the pagoda mast. On 27 June 1944, two Type 22 surface-search radars {{were installed}} on the pagoda mast and two Type 13 early warning radars were fitted on her mainmast.|$|E
5|$|As {{invasion}} neared in mid-1944, the two battalions {{moved from}} their camps to ports in southern England and embarked <b>aboard</b> troopships and landing ship tanks. Much of the Liverpool Irish embarked <b>aboard</b> the Ulster Monarch, a passenger ship that had {{served on the}} Belfast-Liverpool line before the war. Having been delayed, the invasion fleet proceeded to Normandy on 5 June. Both King's battalions landed on D-Day, the 5th at Sword with the 3rd British Infantry Division and the Liverpool Irish at Juno with the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division.|$|E
5|$|As the {{lifeboats}} {{were brought}} alongside Carpathia, the survivors came <b>aboard</b> the ship by various means. Some were {{strong enough to}} climb up rope ladders; others were hoisted up in slings, {{and the children were}} hoisted in mail sacks. The last lifeboat to reach the ship was Lightoller's boat No.12, with 74people <b>aboard</b> a boat designed to carry 65. They were all on Carpathia by 09:00. There were some scenes of joy as some families and friends were reunited, but in most cases hopes died as loved ones failed to reappear.|$|E
5|$|As {{the race}} continues, {{several of the}} vessels are {{destroyed}} by explosions. The Doctor suspects that the crew <b>aboard</b> the Buccaneer, a 17th-century pirate ship, responsible {{as it was the}} closest vessel at the time of destruction. Turlough, while attempting to escape control of the Black Guardian, ends up <b>aboard</b> the Buccaneer, and meets the Eternal Captain Wrack, learning she too is working for the Black Guardian. He finds equipment <b>aboard</b> her ship that appears to be the source of the device destroying the other ships and hears the Black Guardian's voice nearby. Later, Wrack offers the Edwardian officers a reception <b>aboard</b> her ship. During the reception, Turlough demonstrates the equipment to the Doctor, while Wrack gifts Tegan with a tiara with a red crystal. After the reception and continuation of the race, the Doctor sees the Buccaneer nearing the Edwardian ship, and determines that the red crystal is used as a focal point of the weapon, and gets rid of the tiara before Wrack can destroy the ship.|$|E
5|$|Bonnet {{returned}} to Topsail Island {{to find that}} Blackbeard had beached {{the majority of their}} former crew, robbed the Revenge and two other vessels of the squadron of most of their supplies, and sailed away for parts unknown <b>aboard</b> the sloop Adventure, carrying all the loot with him. Bonnet now (probably late June or early July 1718) resumed command of the Revenge. Few, if any, of his original crew from Barbados were still <b>aboard.</b> Bonnet reinforced the Revenge by rescuing a number of men whom Blackbeard had marooned on a sandbar in Topsail Island.|$|E
5|$|Continuous US {{presence}} <b>aboard</b> Mir {{started in}} 1996 with the March 22 launch of Atlantis on mission STS-76, when the Second Increment astronaut Shannon Lucid {{was transferred to}} the station. STS-76 was the third docking mission to Mir, which also demonstrated logistics capabilities through deployment of a Spacehab module, and placed experiment packages <b>aboard</b> Mirs docking module, which marked the first spacewalk which occurred around docked vehicles. The spacewalks, carried out from Atlantis's crew cabin, provided valuable experience for astronauts in order to prepare for later assembly missions to the International Space Station.|$|E
5|$|Criticism of {{the program}} was {{primarily}} concerned with the safety of the aging Mir, particularly following the fire <b>aboard</b> the station and collision with the Progress supply vessel in 1997.|$|E

5|$|During the 1990s, bulkers were {{involved}} in an alarming number of shipwrecks. This led ship-owners to commission a study seeking to explain the effect of various factors on the crew's effectiveness and competence. The study showed that crew performance <b>aboard</b> bulk carriers was the lowest of all groups studied. Among bulker crews, the best performance was found <b>aboard</b> younger and larger ships. Crews on better-maintained ships performed better, as did crews on ships where fewer languages were spoken.|$|E
5|$|During the 7 July 2005 {{terrorist}} attacks on London, a bomb was exploded <b>aboard</b> an Underground train that had departed Liverpool Street toward Aldgate. Seven passengers were killed.|$|E
5|$|During the {{afternoon}} of 12 October, a gale sprang up which inflicted further damage to the battered ships and caused water to gush through the many shot holes in the ships' hulls. <b>Aboard</b> the Dutch ships, the situation was especially dangerous. Casualties had been significantly higher, particularly on Vrijheid, than on board the British vessels and the small numbers of British sailors placed <b>aboard</b> as prize crews were unable to cope alone, and in the high winds many masts collapsed to the deck and huge quantities of water leaked into the hulls.|$|E
5|$|During {{the long}} period of peace between 1815 and 1846 midshipmen had few {{opportunities}} for promotion, and their warrants were often obtained via patronage. The poor quality of officer training in the US Navy became visible after the Somers Affair, an alleged mutiny <b>aboard</b> the training ship USS Somers in 1842, and the subsequent execution of midshipman Philip Spencer. Spencer had gained his post <b>aboard</b> the Somers via the influence of his father, United States Secretary of War John C. Spencer.|$|E
5|$|Entering the Navy {{fully in}} May 1774, Harvey became a {{midshipman}} <b>aboard</b> the sloop HMS Lynx {{and spent the}} next two years in the West Indies. Briefly returning to Britain at the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War, Harvey returned to the eastern seaboard of North America late in 1776 <b>aboard</b> HMS Mermaid, before transferring to the flagship of the North America Station HMS Eagle. From there Harvey joined HMS Liverpool on temporary assignment, only to be wrecked on Long Island <b>aboard</b> the frigate in 1778. Harvey rejoined Eagle after the wreck and returned to Britain in her. He was promoted to lieutenant on 25 February 1779.|$|E
5|$|Glorious {{returned}} on 18 May {{with six}} Supermarine Walrus amphibious flying boats of 701 Squadron and 18 Hawker Hurricanes of No. 46 Squadron RAF. The latter aircraft had been loaded <b>aboard</b> by crane. The Walruses were quickly flown off to Harstad, but the airfield at Skånland {{was not yet}} ready for the Hurricanes and they were still <b>aboard</b> when Glorious returned to Scapa on 21 May. Glorious {{came back to the}} Narvik area on 26 May and the Hurricanes were quickly flown off.|$|E
5|$|However, in 1801 he fell ill, {{contracting}} Yellow Fever. He {{was sent}} to sea by his doctors {{in an attempt to}} regain his health but died <b>aboard</b> HMS Tisiphone in September 1801.|$|E
5|$|In March 1937, {{five months}} after the wreck, the hulk of Ohioan—still aground near Seal Rock—caught fire when a {{watchman}} <b>aboard</b> the ship attempted to burn some meat in a refrigerator. The flames died out before reaching the explosives that remained <b>aboard</b> the wreck. A Pacific storm in December the same year caused the hulk of Ohioan to break in two. By 1939, only remnants of some of Ohioans rusty steel beams were still visible on the rocks.|$|E
