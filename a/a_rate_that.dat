Most of the understory plants and animals from the upper spruce-fir zone, however, {{can be found in}} this forest. Moisture causes nutrients to be stripped from the soil and brought to lower elevations, and decomposition takes place at <b>a</b> <b>rate</b> <b>that</b> is too slow to replenish them.|$|E
5|$|Once dissolved, {{distribution}} of the dissolved gas may be by diffusion, {{where there is no}} bulk flow of the solvent, or by perfusion where the solvent (in this case blood) is circulated around the diver's body, where gas can diffuse to local regions of lower concentration. Given sufficient time at a specific partial pressure in the breathing gas, the concentration in the tissues stabilizes, or saturates, at <b>a</b> <b>rate</b> <b>that</b> depends on solubility, diffusion rate and perfusion, all of which vary in the different tissues of the body. This process is referred to as in-gassing, and is usually modeled as an inverse exponential process.|$|E
5|$|On February 24, 2016, the MTA {{allocated}} $66 {{million to}} speed up the construction of the first phase so that it could open in December. However, by June, the project was not being built at <b>a</b> <b>rate</b> <b>that</b> would allow a December 2016 completion. Concerns about the line's timely opening persisted through October and November, with key systems such as elevators, escalators, and fire alarms not having been tested. The third rail was energized and test trains began running through the new line on October 9, 2016, with weights to simulate rush hour loads; non-revenue Q trains, taken out of service at 57th Street–Seventh Avenue, started running through the subway in November 2016.|$|E

40|$|In {{gradient}} descent learning algorithms such as error backpropagation, the learning rate parameter {{can have a}} significant effect on generalization accuracy. In particular, decreasing the learning <b>rate</b> below <b>that</b> which yields the fastest convergence can significantly improve generalization accuracy, especially on large, complex problems. The learning rate also directly affects training speed, but not necessarily in the way that many people expect. Many neural network practitioners currently attempt to use the largest learning <b>rate</b> <b>that</b> still allows for convergence, in order to improve training speed. However, <b>a</b> learning <b>rate</b> <b>that</b> is too large can be as slow as <b>a</b> learning <b>rate</b> <b>that</b> is too small, and <b>a</b> learning <b>rate</b> <b>that</b> is too large or too small can require orders of magnitude more training time than one that is in an appropriate range. This paper illustrates how the learning rate affects training speed and generalization accuracy, and thus gives guidelines on how to efficiently select <b>a</b> learning <b>rate</b> <b>that</b> maximizes generalization accuracy. ...|$|R

5|$|So far {{some success}} has been {{achieved}} in using string theory methods to describe the transition of a superfluid to an insulator. A superfluid is a system of electrically neutral atoms that flows without any friction. Such systems are often produced in the laboratory using liquid helium, but recently experimentalists have developed new ways of producing artificial superfluids by pouring trillions of cold atoms into a lattice of criss-crossing lasers. These atoms initially behave as a superfluid, but as experimentalists increase {{the intensity of the}} lasers, they become less mobile and then suddenly transition to an insulating state. During the transition, the atoms behave in an unusual way. For example, the atoms slow to a halt at <b>a</b> <b>rate</b> <b>that</b> depends on the temperature and on Planck's constant, the fundamental parameter of quantum mechanics, which does not enter into the description of the other phases. This behavior has recently been understood by considering a dual description where properties of the fluid are described in terms of a higher dimensional black hole.|$|E

50|$|It {{is worth}} tuning {{parameters}} {{such as the}} mutation probability, crossover probability and population size to find reasonable settings for the problem class being worked on.
