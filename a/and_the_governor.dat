The Burmese would not, however, take the Siamese capital so easily.|$|E
5|$|Bradley {{was inaugurated}} December 10, 1895. During his term, Republicans {{controlled}} the Kentucky House of Representatives, while Democrats controlled the Kentucky Senate. This led to infighting {{between the two}} houses of the General Assembly and between the General Assembly <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>governor.</b> On joint votes, such as the election of U.S. Senators, the parties were even with sixty-eight members each; two Populists were also members of the Assembly, one who supported the Democrats and another who supported the Republicans.|$|E

5|$|Following Italy's September 1911 {{invasion}} of Libya, al-Qassam began collecting funds in Jableh {{for the joint}} Ottoman-Libyan resistance movement and composed a victory anthem. Jableh's district governor sought to gain control over the fundraiser and when locals nevertheless continued to send their donations to al-Qassam, he attempted to have him jailed. The district governor alleged that al-Qassam was working against the Ottoman state, but an official investigation found him not guilty <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>governor</b> was consequently dismissed.|$|E
5|$|In 1861 Kentucky {{governor}} Beriah Magoffin appointed Buckner adjutant general, promoted him {{to major}} general, and {{charged him with}} revising the state's militia laws.

5|$|Behan {{utilized}} his existing {{position and}} his superior political connections to successfully lobby for the position.

Behan reneged on his deal with Earp and appointed Harry Woods as undersheriff instead. Behan said he broke his promise to appoint Earp because Wyatt Earp used Behan's name to threaten Ike Clanton when Wyatt recovered his stolen horse from Clanton.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the heated}} {{political}} {{environment of the}} Old Court-New Court controversy, allies of his father claimed that the governor's political enemies had framed his son. The governor's legislative allies passed legislation providing for a favorable change of venue for the trial, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>governor</b> used his appointment power to ensure that sympathetic judges would hear the case. Isaac Desha was twice convicted, but both times, {{the judge in the}} case set aside the verdict on procedural grounds. While awaiting a third trial, Desha attempted suicide by slitting his throat, but doctors saved his life, reconnecting his severed windpipe with a silver tube. Shortly after the suicide attempt, Governor Desha issued a pardon for his son.|$|E

5|$|His knighthood {{involved}} some controversy, {{following his}} wife's public comment {{that he was}} the only Australian state governor without such an honour. As knighthoods were then conferred by the Queen on the recommendation of her Federal and State governments, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Governor</b> was the Queen's representative in the state, this was seen as highly inappropriate, especially given the Western Australian ALP State government of the day, led by John Tonkin had a policy of not recommending Imperial Honours. However, the Tonkin Government was defeated in April 1974 and the incoming Liberal Premier, Sir Charles Court, was happy to make the necessary recommendation.|$|E
5|$|In 1779, Seymour was {{promoted}} once more, making post captain in HMS Porcupine and serving {{in command of}} HMS Diana, HMS Ambuscade and HMS Latona, all in the Channel Fleet. The only major operation in which he participated during the period was {{the conclusion of the}} Great Siege of Gibraltar, when Latona was attached to Lord Howe's fleet that relieved the fortress. During this service, Seymour was repeatedly engaged in scouting the Franco-Spanish fleet in Algeciras, a task made difficult by bad weather and the erratic movements of the enemy. During much of the operation, Captain Roger Curtis was stationed aboard Latona to facilitate communicate between Howe <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Governor</b> of Gibraltar. The effort to relieve and resupply the fortress was a complete success and Latona was sent back to Britain with dispatches, although Seymour remained in Gibraltar.|$|E
5|$|In Commonwealth realms {{other than}} the UK, royal assent is granted or {{withheld}} either by the realm's sovereign or, more frequently, by {{the representative of the}} sovereign, the governor-general. In federated realms, assent in each state, province, or territory is granted or withheld by the representatives of the sovereign. In Australia, this is the governors of the states, administrators of the territories, or the governor-general in the Australian Capital Territory. For Canada, this is the lieutenant governors of the provinces. A lieutenant governor may defer assent to the governor general, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>governor</b> general may defer assent to federal bills to the sovereign.|$|E

5|$|In March 1695, captain Juan Díaz de Velasco set {{out from}} Cahabón in Alta Verapaz with 70 Spanish soldiers, {{accompanied}} by {{a large number of}} Maya archers from Verapaz, and native muleteers; four Dominican friars led by Criollo friar Agustín Cano accompanied the expedition. Theoretically the Spanish soldiers were provided solely as an escort for the Dominicans. The Guatemalan expedition, under orders of President Jacinto de Barrios Leal, were secretly trying to reach the Itzas before Martín de Ursúa could reach them from Yucatán; the existence of the expedition was carefully concealed during all communications between Guatemala <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>governor</b> of Yucatán.

5|$|Judges in a High Court are {{appointed}} by the President of India {{in consultation with the}} Chief Justice of India <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>governor</b> of the state. High Courts are headed by a Chief Justice. The Chief Justices are ranked fourteenth (in their state) and seventeenth (outside their state) in the Indian order of precedence. The number of judges in a court is decided by dividing the average institution of main cases during the last five years by the national average, or the average rate of disposal of main cases per judge per year in that High Court, whichever is higher.|$|E

In November 1341, Abu Bakr was executed by the governor of Qus on orders from Qawsun. After his death, Qawsun installed Abu Bakr's infant half-brother, Kujuk, as sultan and became the Kujuk's regent. Meanwhile, dissent mounted against Qawsun in Syria and Cairo and he was ousted in a revolt, along with Kujuk.

Three others charged in the assassination turned state's evidence. Only five of the sixteen went to trial; two of those were acquitted. Three men were eventually convicted for playing roles in Goebel's assassination. Kentucky's Secretary of State, Caleb Powers, was accused of being the mastermind behind the assassination.
