5|$|December 14: Definite {{evidence}} of <b>achievable</b> compression obtained in a RaLa test.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the state-funded sector {{had grown to}} the point where {{universal}} secondary education seemed <b>achievable,</b> and changes in society had made the idea more popular.|$|E
5|$|In April 2014, {{disarmament}} experts such as Ralf Trapp {{characterized the}} pace of the operation as impressively quick. With 92.5% of the arsenal removed or destroyed, Trapp noted that many people hadn't expected such speed to be <b>achievable</b> given the ongoing civil war.|$|E
5|$|In earlier {{historical}} periods obesity was rare, and <b>achievable</b> {{only by a}} small elite, although already recognised as {{a problem}} for health. But as prosperity increased in the Early Modern period, it affected increasingly larger groups of the population.|$|E
5|$|By 17 August 1942, {{production}} {{had climbed}} rapidly after Blohm & Voss BV 138 production was scaled down and licence work had shut down at WFG. Production now reached some 150 Ju 87 D airframes per month, but spare parts were failing {{to reach the}} same production levels. Undercarriage parts were particularly in short supply. Milch ordered production to 350 Ju 87s per month in September 1942. This was not <b>achievable</b> due to the insufficient production capacity in the Reich.|$|E
5|$|Chrysler Corporation {{approved}} {{the development of}} the model on the assumption that Chrysler Europe would sell 60,000 C9 models per year, which translated into a projected 5percent share of the executive car market. This estimate seemed <b>achievable</b> because Chrysler had a 7percent market share in Europe overall. The projected sales would have covered the car's tooling costs, with the development costs accounted for separately, as part of an independent annual budget.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom, for example, the Carbon Trust {{recently}} {{estimated the}} extent of the economically viable offshore resource at 55 TWh per year, about 14% of current national demand. Across Europe, the technologically <b>achievable</b> resource has been estimated to be at least 280 TWh per year. In 2003, the U.S. Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) estimated the viable resource in the United States at 255 TWh per year (6% of demand).|$|E
5|$|Total {{wind power}} could be {{captured}} {{only if the}} wind velocity is reduced to zero. In a realistic wind turbine this is impossible, as the captured air must also leave the turbine. A relation between the input and output wind velocity must be considered. Using the concept of stream tube, the maximal <b>achievable</b> extraction of wind power by a wind turbine is 59% of the total theoretical wind power (see: Betz' law).|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} {{unstable}} −1 state, three more oxidation states are predicted; +5, +3, and +1. The +1 state should be especially stable {{because of the}} destabilization of the three outermost 7p3/2 electrons, forming a stable, half-filled subshell configuration; astatine shows similar effects. The +3 state should be important, again due to the destabilized 7p3/2 electrons. The +5 state is predicted to be uncommon because the 7p1/2 electrons are oppositely stabilized. The +7 state has not been shown—even computationally—to be <b>achievable.</b> Because the 7s electrons are greatly stabilized, it has been hypothesized that tennessine effectively has only five valence electrons.|$|E
5|$|Synthetic {{diamonds}} {{for use as}} gemstones {{are grown}} by HPHT or CVD methods, and currently represent approximately 2% of the gem-quality diamond market. However, {{there are indications that}} the market share of synthetic jewelry-quality diamonds may grow as advances in technology allows for larger higher-quality synthetic production on a more economic scale. They are available in yellow and blue, {{and to a lesser extent}} colorless (or white). The yellow color comes from nitrogen impurities in the manufacturing process, while the blue color comes from boron. Other colors, such as pink or green, are <b>achievable</b> after synthesis using irradiation. Several companies also offer memorial diamonds grown using cremated remains.|$|E
5|$|The tournaments {{were not}} without controversy. Players complained about Microsoft's {{tardiness}} in posting the official {{rules for the}} first playoff, and {{it was believed that}} the top posted score was not <b>achievable</b> by fair means. Officials, however, stated that the score was possible, and allowed the results to stand. In the second playoff, Microsoft initially named the runner up as the North American finalist, after disqualifying the winner for no publicly stated reason, but eventually had to send the second runner up to Tokyo when the first was unable to produce a passport in time.|$|E
25|$|Materials implicitly control <b>achievable</b> spatial resolution.|$|E
25|$|Break {{down the}} task into small <b>achievable</b> steps, going from simple to complex.|$|E
25|$|Astral {{projection}} {{is one of}} the Siddhis considered <b>achievable</b> by yoga practitioners through self-disciplined practice.|$|E
25|$|Some {{scientists}} {{are making the}} case that a vaccine against rhinoviruses, the predominant cause of the common cold, is <b>achievable.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Achievable</b> mass ratios {{are highly}} {{dependent}} on many factors such as propellant type, the design of engine the vehicle uses, structural safety margins and construction techniques.|$|E
25|$|Often {{incorporating}} vacuum tube-based electronics, surviving analog delay {{units are}} sought by modern musicians {{who wish to}} employ some of the timbres <b>achievable</b> with this technology.|$|E
25|$|Researchers in Switzerland {{believe that}} this vision is <b>achievable,</b> despite a {{projected}} 65% increase in economic growth by 2050, by using new low-carbon technologies and techniques.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} Solow model {{predicts that}} in the long run, growth is <b>achievable</b> only through technological progress. To allow a continued growth condition in the long-term the Solow Romer model is used.|$|E
25|$|Palo Cortado Sherry is very rare, {{as it is}} an Oloroso {{wine that}} ages in a different, natural way not <b>achievable</b> by human intervention. It often {{contains}} 17 to 22% of alcohol.|$|E
25|$|Most Mahayana teachings {{assert that}} all beings who {{correctly}} practice the dharma may reach enlightenment, since all possess an innate buddha nature. Enlightenment being <b>achievable</b> {{even in a}} single life.|$|E
25|$|The {{efficiency}} is measured under ideal laboratory conditions and represents the maximum <b>achievable</b> {{efficiency of the}} PV material. Actual {{efficiency is}} influenced by the output Voltage, current, junction temperature, light intensity and spectrum.|$|E
25|$|Non-imposition, or citizen sovereignty: Every {{possible}} societal preference order {{should be}} <b>achievable</b> by some set of individual preference orders. This {{means that the}} social welfare function is surjective: It has an unrestricted target space.|$|E
25|$|A gram of {{activated}} carbon {{can have a}} surface area in excess of 500 m2, with 1500 m2 being readily <b>achievable.</b> Carbon aerogels, while more expensive, have even higher surface areas, and are used in special applications.|$|E
25|$|Such {{groups as}} all {{translations}} and all scalings {{of the image}} are not compact, as they allow arbitrarily big transformations. However, they are locally compact. For locally compact groups, invariance is <b>achievable</b> within certain range of transformations.|$|E
25|$|In fact in an axiomatic setting {{rigorous}} adds {{nothing to}} the idea of proof. Pure mathematics, according to a view that can be ascribed to the Bourbaki group, is what is proved. Pure mathematician became a recognized vocation, <b>achievable</b> through training.|$|E
25|$|The {{organism}} {{is intrinsically}} resistant to gentamicin and colistin, and {{this fact is}} helpful {{in the identification of}} the organism. Kanamycin is used to kill B.pseudomallei in the laboratory, but the concentrations used are much higher than those <b>achievable</b> in humans.|$|E
25|$|Artificial {{intelligence}} {{can also}} be evaluated on specific problems such as small problems in chemistry, hand-writing recognition and game-playing. Such tests have been termed subject matter expert Turing tests. Smaller problems provide more <b>achievable</b> goals and there are an ever-increasing number of positive results.|$|E
25|$|Conservation of mass {{requires}} {{that the amount of}} air entering and exiting a turbine must be equal. Accordingly, Betz's law gives the maximal <b>achievable</b> extraction of wind power by a wind turbine as 16/27 (59.3%) of the total kinetic energy of the air flowing through the turbine.|$|E
25|$|In a 2-player game, {{the maximum}} score {{that can be}} made in one hand is 4,600 points. In a {{standard}} 4-player game there is no extension, so the maximum score is 4,400. In a 3-player or 6-player game, two shutout bonuses are <b>achievable,</b> yielding a perfect score of 5,100.|$|E
25|$|The {{school has}} Speech, Language and Communications Needs ('SCLN') and SEN trained staff to improve {{education}} for children who struggle in communication and in an educational setting respectively. SEN children are wherever <b>achievable</b> within the school's financial constraints totally integrated into {{all aspects of the}} school community.|$|E
25|$|Although Mahayana Buddhism {{has some}} texts against {{homosexuality}} (from later Abhidharma texts & Buddhist apocrypha), {{the majority of}} its teachings assert that all beings who correctly practice the dharma may reach enlightenment, since all possess an innate Buddha nature. Enlightenment being <b>achievable</b> even in a single life.|$|E
25|$|Parts of Babbage's {{incomplete}} {{mechanisms are}} {{on display in the}} Science Museum in London. In 1991, a functioning difference engine was constructed from Babbage's original plans. Built to tolerances <b>achievable</b> in the 19th century, the success of the finished engine indicated that Babbage's machine would have worked.|$|E
25|$|Rarely, {{thread cutting}} or {{grinding}} (usually the latter) {{will be followed}} by thread lapping in order to achieve the highest precision and surface finish <b>achievable.</b> This is a toolroom practice when the highest precision is required, rarely employed except for the leadscrews or ballscrews of high-end machine tools.|$|E
25|$|The {{school has}} a lower degree of Speech, Language and Communications Needs ('SCLN') and SEN {{children}} than nearby schools. Children who struggle in these area receive extra support wherever <b>achievable</b> within the school's financial constraints and it is natural that these children are totally integrated into {{all aspects of the}} school community.|$|E
25|$|Quality {{controls}} are <b>achievable</b> and indeed performed in many ABC-based works, but for certain problems, {{the assessment of}} the impact of the method-related parameters can be challenging. However, the rapidly increasing use of ABC can be expected to provide a more thorough understanding of the limitations and applicability of the method.|$|E
