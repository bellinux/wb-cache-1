The chromaticity diagrams that have been corrected for the Abney effect are therefore excellent illustrations of the non-linear nature of the visual system. Also, the Abney effect does not disallow any and all straight lines on chromaticity diagrams. One may mix two monochromatic lights <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> a shift in hue, thereby suggesting a straight-line plot for the different levels of mixture would be appropriate on a chromaticity diagram.|$|E
500|$|Harvey and Stewart {{said that}} the fatwa was a {{departure}} from the previous legal opinions among Islamic scholars, which typically emphasised the obligation to emigrate from any country where proper religious observance was not possible. Notably, the Maliki scholar al-Wansharisi, the leading living authority on the issue, was among the proponents of this view. Stewart contended that, while the fatwa's text did not mention any opponent, it was intended as a rebuke against the views of al-Wansharisi. Recipients of this fatwa would be able to stay put, outwardly conforming to Christianity <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> themselves as abandoning their faith. The fatwa addressed the recipient as [...] "al-guraba", a word that means [...] "outsiders" [...] or [...] "those living abroad", but this word also appears in several hadiths (sayings of Muhammad) and evokes a spiritual meaning of heroic Muslims loyal to their faith in spite of great suffering. The sympathy shown by the author, as well as his acknowledgement of the Muslims' loyalty and suffering, is in contrast with the predominant opinion such as al-Wansharisi's which saw them unfavourably.|$|E

Although Inception {{was not part}} of an existing franchise, Sue Kroll, president of Warner's worldwide marketing, said the company believed it could gain awareness due to the strength of [...] "Christopher Nolan as a brand". Kroll declared that [...] "We don't have the brand equity that usually drives a big summer opening, but we have a great cast and a fresh idea from a filmmaker with a track record of making incredible movies. If you can't make those elements work, it's a sad day." [...] The studio also tried to maintain a campaign of secrecy—as reported by the Senior VP of Interactive Marketing, Michael Tritter, [...] "You have this movie which {{is going to have a}} pretty big built in fanbase... but you also have a movie that you are trying to keep very secret. Chris [...] really likes people to see his movies in a theater <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> it all beforehand so everything that you do to market that—at least early on—is with an eye to feeding the interest to fans." ...|$|E

Winter had been interested in creating a series set in the 1920s, feeling that it had never properly been explored before. It was {{for this reason that}} he decided to focus his adaption of the novel on the Prohibition era section. On September 1, 2009, it was announced that Academy Award-winning director Martin Scorsese would direct the pilot. It would be {{the first time he had}} directed an episode of television since an episode of Steven Spielberg's Amazing Stories in 1986.

Melinda Newman of HitFix, polarised by its lyrical content, wrote that women want men to pretend their flaws {{do not exist}} <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> them. Both Kate Wills of The Independent and Rolling Stone writer Jon Dolan criticised the lyrical content as jarring. Although Bill Lamb of About.com shared Smith's sentiment, he favoured Gosling's [...] "beautiful" [...] production of the song and the group's [...] "top notch" [...] vocal performance. Al Fox of BBC Music, who noted a [...] "pursuit for credibility", felt that One Direction were [...] "handing in their identity" [...] with [...] "Little Things". Jon Caramanica of The New York Times dismissed Sheeran's songwriting as [...] "unusually lumpy {{in the hands of}} such a polished group". In contrast, Alexis Petridis for The Guardian described the track as [...] "noticeably more sophisticated lyrically and emotionally than anything else on the album." [...] The Boston Globe editor Sarah Rodman selected the [...] "essential" [...] song as the album's [...] "best" [...] attribute, and Matt Collar from AllMusic considered the ballad [...] "an air of maturity to One Direction's admittedly squeaky-fresh sound." [...] Robert Copsey of Digital Spy felt that [...] "Little Things" [...] can be interpreted as [...] "minor signs of growth" [...] for the boy band.|$|E
