5000|$|Another {{advantage}} of the circuit was that the tube {{could be made to}} oscillate, and thus a single tube could serve as both a beat frequency oscillator and a detector, functioning as a heterodyne receiver to make CW radiotelegraphy transmissions audible. [...] This mode was called an <b>autodyne</b> <b>receiver.</b> To receive radiotelegraphy, the feedback was increased until the tube oscillated, then the oscillation frequency was tuned {{to one side of the}} transmitted signal. The incoming radio carrier signal and local oscillation signal mixed in the tube and produced an audible heterodyne (beat) tone at the difference between the frequencies.|$|E

40|$|Possible {{application}} of a retarding-field velocity-sorting process to detection in a microwave receiver was investigated. The receiver consisted of a double-ended backward-wave oscillator operating as an autodyne. Operating parameters of the receiver such as dynamic range, electronic tuning, stability, and sensitivity were measured and the results compared with those obtained from a similar <b>autodyne</b> <b>receiver</b> using an external crystal detector. It {{was found that the}} velocity-sorting detector is equal to the crystal type in sensitivity and nearly equal in dynamic range, but inferior in gain stability. The poor gain stability is due to the variation of detection efficiency with beam current, which is inherent in a retardin-field detector. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
25|$|Early <b>Autodyne</b> <b>receivers</b> {{typically}} used IFs of only 150nbsp&kHz or so, {{as it was}} difficult to maintain reliable oscillation if higher frequencies were used. As a consequence, most <b>Autodyne</b> <b>receivers</b> needed quite elaborate antenna tuning networks, often involving double-tuned coils, to avoid image interference. Later superhets used tubes especially designed for oscillator/mixer use, which were able to work reliably with much higher IFs, reducing the problem of image interference and so allowing simpler and cheaper aerial tuning circuitry.|$|R
50|$|The Allied fuze used {{constructive}} {{and destructive}} interference to detect its target. The design had four tubes. One tube was an oscillator connected to an antenna; it functioned {{as both a}} transmitter and an <b>autodyne</b> detector (<b>receiver).</b> When the target was far away, it would reflect little of the oscillator's energy back to the fuze and have almost {{no effect on the}} circuit. When a target was nearby, it would reflect {{a significant portion of the}} oscillator's signal back to the fuze. The amplitude of the reflected signal indicated the closeness of the target. This reflected signal would affect the oscillator depending on the round trip distance from the fuze to the target. If the reflected signal were in phase, the oscillator amplitude would increase and the oscillator's plate current would also increase. If the reflected signal were out of phase, then the plate current would decrease.|$|R
