40|$|Investigations {{carried on}} in these {{laboratories}} concerning the r 6 le of surface tension in certain bacteriological phenomena (Larson, 1921), {{have led to}} the development of an apparatus for the rapid determination of surface tension by the drop-weight method. After using the more common methods of surface tension measurement the belief is expressed that the most reliable and constant results for bothpureand biological liquids can be obtained from their drop weights. The apparatus here described repre-sents a means of determining the surface tension of a liquid by the drop-weight method without any mathematical calculation or the determination of the drop weights and is termed a surface tension balance. The apparatus is designed primarily for rapidity of measurement and an accuracy is obtained which is consistent with ordinary experimental conditions. In general the apparatus consists of three mechanical parts, <b>a</b> <b>dropping</b> <b>pipette,</b> a balance beam mounted on a torsion wire and an adjustable scale. The dropping pipette (A) differs in no way from those already in use and all the inaccuracies and corrections, which have been recorded for this method, occur but such errors may be mini-mized and reduced to an order of magnitude which is of no concern to the biologist, by using a dropping surface of the proper dimensions (Morgan, 1911). The rate at which the drops fall may be easily controlled by using a fine capillary tube for an air inlet protected by larger tubing (I) ...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY: Equipment can {{be readily}} made in the {{laboratory}} for the mechanical preparation of roll-tubes. Roll-tubes so prepared can largely replace Petri dishes both for counting and for single colony isolations. The recent shortage of Petri dishes has compelled the adoption of an alternative method for counting viable bacteria. The roll-tube method, which consists essentially in the replacement of Petri dishes by test-tubes, was chosen (Wilson, 1922). Apart from considerations of accuracy, rolled tubes are more economical than Petri dishes since ordinary test-tubes may be used; only one-fifth of the medium is required {{and the number of}} dilutions is reduced since it is customary to use <b>a</b> standardized <b>dropping</b> <b>pipette</b> to deliver <b>a</b> known volume of inoculum into the tube. Against this must be set the disadvantage that streaking and picking of individual colonies requires a greater manipulative skill than with Petri dishes. Withell (1938) obtained a standard error of & 5 yo with roll-tube counts. Using similar statistical methods Jenninson & Wadsworth (1940) obtaine...|$|R
40|$|Although the {{literature}} contains {{a number of}} reports regarding the bactericidal efficiency of certain specified concentrations of sodium hydroxide against various test organisms, very little of this information is presented in a manner suitable for mathematical analysis. To obtain the data required for analysis, an experi-mental study {{was made of the}} bactericidal efficiency of sodium hydroxide. This study was conducted along the lines of a previously described study of the bactericidal efficiencies of some of the phenols and alcohols (Tilley, 1939). EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE Bactericidal efficiency was determined by the Rideal-Walker technique, modified as follows: Either infusion broth or FDA beef extract broth was used instead of R-W standard broth; instead of <b>a</b> standardized <b>dropping</b> <b>pipette</b> <b>a</b> 1 -ml pipette graduated into tenths was used to measure out the 0. 5 ml of culture required for the test; medication temperatures were sometimes 20 C and some-times 30 C instead of 15 C to 18 C; dilutions were made in sterile Erlenmeyer flasks instead of in cylinders; fixed amounts of the stock solution of disinfectant were added to varying amounts of distilled water, all measured with sterile standardized pipettes; the time of exposure was extended beyond 15 minutes, subcultures being made at 2. 5 -minute intervals when exposure varied from 2. 5 to 30 minutes, at 5 -minute intervals when exposures varied from 30 to 80 minutes, and at 10 -minute intervals when exposures were beyond 80 minutes; and Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli were used as test organisms instead of Eberthella typho 8 a. The bactericidal efficiency of sodium hydroxide was determined by the tech-nique described above, and from the experimental data thus obtained values of the concentration exponent, n, were calculated as described in a previous paper (Tilley, 1939) by the equation, n = log- log C etc., for results presented in tabular form, and by the equation, n = Y 2 - Yfor results presented graphically...|$|R
40|$|THE {{method of}} Miles, Misra and Irwin (1938) has {{for many years}} been the {{standard}} tech-nique for the determination of viable bacterial counts by surface inoculation of solid media. However, this method requires precision and skill if accurate results are to be obtained. One problem is the difficulty of preparing pipettes that accurately and consistently deliver 50 drops per ml. The method is also not without hazard to the operator. Johannson and Ferris (1946) have demonstrated aerosol formation when <b>a</b> liquid is <b>dropped</b> on to <b>an</b> agar surface, and the necessary agitation of dilutions during mixing also produces airborne bacteria. We describe and evaluate a procedure in which a semi-automatic pipette with glass capillary tubes is used. This method {{does not require the}} preparation and calibration of accurate <b>dropping</b> <b>pipettes</b> but has the accuracy of the Miles, Misra and Irwin technique; it also has the advantages of being faster and of producing less bacterial contamination of the working surface.

In this paper, we demonstrate the effectiveness of nanogap capacitor in detecting the changes of pH measurement via Dielectric analyzer (C-V and C-F characterization) as its stables under each reading and repeatability. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to report on the fabrication and electrical characterization of nanogap device. We introduce the conventional lithographic combined with the size expansion technique for the transition from micro (3. 13 µm) to nano-sized (42 nm) gap. The evolution of gaps nanogap pattern expansions were verified by using SEM by controlling the dry oxidation time of device. Then, Ti/Au layer were deposited onto the final device for probing purpose. Different level of pH (3, 5, and 10) has been tested and conformed by repeating each test. About 10 µm of pH liquid were <b>dropped</b> using <b>pipette</b> in the middle of gap probing (2 -wire measurements) is done on the Au pad fabricated on the nanogap device. 10 µm of pH liquid were <b>dropped</b> using <b>pipette</b> onto the target and the reading will be taken.
