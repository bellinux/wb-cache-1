40|$|The Spitzer SAGE survey {{has allowed}} the {{identification}} and analysis of significant samples of Young Stellar Object (YSO) candidates in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). However the angular resolution of Spitzer is relatively poor meaning that at {{the distance of the}} LMC, it is likely that many of the Spitzer YSO candidates in fact contain multiple components. We present high resolution K-band integral field spectroscopic observations of the three most prominent massive YSO candidates in the N 113 H ii region using VLT/SINFONI. We have identified six K-band continuum sources within the three Spitzer sources and we have mapped the morphology and velocity fields of extended line emission around these sources. Brγ, He i and H_ 2 emission is found at the position of all six K-band sources; we discuss whether the emission is associated with the continuum sources or whether it is <b>ambient</b> <b>emission.</b> H_ 2 emission appears to be mostly <b>ambient</b> <b>emission</b> and no evidence of CO emission arising in the discs of YSOs has been found. We have mapped the centroid velocities of extended Brγ emission and He i emission and found evidence of two expanding compact H ii regions. One source shows compact and strong H_ 2 emission suggestive of a molecular outflow. The diversity of spectroscopic properties observed is interpreted {{in the context of a}} range of evolutionary stages associated with massive star formation.

40|$|Asthma is a {{respiratory}} disease whose prevalence {{has been increasing}} since the mid 1970 s and that affects more than 14. 6 million residents of the United States. Environmental triggers of asthma include air pollutants that are respiratory irritants. Air toxics emitted into the ambient air {{are listed in the}} 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments as hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) if they can adversely affect human health, including the respiratory tract. HAPs include particulate and gaseous-phase pollutants, individual organic compounds and metals, and mixtures. Associations between asthma exacerbation and both particles and indoor volatile organic compounds (VOCs), often referred to as indoor air quality, have been reported. Studies conducted in the United States, Canada, and Europe {{over the past two decades}} have shown that most people living in the developed countries spend the majority of their time indoors and that the air concentrations of many air toxics or HAPs are higher indoors than in the ambient air in urban, suburban, and rural settings. Elevated indoor air concentrations result from emissions of air toxics from consumer products, household furnishings, and personal activities.

40|$|The ambient permit system {{proposed}} in the literature for cost-effective pollution reduction is difficult to implement and may result in lower net benefits than using another instrument. The article develops a model for comparing the environmental net benefits of three policy instruments for Santiago, Chile, when the policy problem is to meet a given ambient quality standard. Two market-based instruments [...] the ambient permit system and a simpler emission permit system [...] are examined along with an emission standard, a command and control instrument usually favored by regulators. Both emission permit system and emission standard are costlier than the ambient permit system, sometimes {{in large part because}} they improve <b>ambient</b> <b>emission</b> concentrations beyond the required target in much of the city, but the ambient permit system requires a lower degree of control to comply with the standard. The somewhat costlier emission permit system and emission standard provide much higher net benefits than the ambient permit system when the health benefits of their "excessive" air quality improvements are taken into account. These benefits are different from the fact that an ambient permit system is administratively costlier to implement. Copyright The Author 2007.

We confirm that HH 47 A and HH 47 D each show a bow shock/Mach disk morphology, and that velocity variability in the outflow can account for the observed structures. While it was suggested a decade ago that the inner working surface HH 47 A appears to be traveling into the wake of HH 47 D, we find kinematic evidence that the outer bow shock HH 47 D is also not the primary ejection event in the outflow but follows {{in the wake of}} previously ejected material. By comparing the observed line ratios and line profiles to those predicted by our bow shock models, we find that both bow shocks have substantially lower shock velocities than their space motions would imply, and that the emission from each bow shock is systematically blueshifted from the rest-frame velocity of the <b>ambient</b> <b>emission,</b> indicating a comoving preshock medium. We derive kinematic ages of approximately 1150 yr for HH 47 D and approximately 550 yr for HH 47 A, which implies that the stellar driving source may undergo repetitive eruptions similar to FU Orionis-type outbursts every several hundred years. This timescale is similar to estimates made by Reipurth and collaborators for the separation between major outbursts in the HH 34 and HH 111 stellar jets...|$|E

Several observed spectra exhibit sharply enhanced resolution. We interpret this as bright auroral emission foreshortened on the morning limb with a maximum intensity at least as high as 2000 kR. We have searched for evidence that the primary precipitating particles exciting the aurora include the heavy ions known to exist in Jupiter's plasma torus and magnetosphere. We have also searched for such ambient heavy ions and neutrals at rest in the auroral ionosphere, the end products of previous precipitation, excited by the auroral cascade. We argue that primary emission would be characterized by a dramatically Doppler-broadened (similar to 10 - 15 Angstrom) and redshifted line profile resulting from the cascade process and the angle between the line of sight and the magnetic field lines in the atmosphere. In contrast, <b>ambient</b> <b>emission</b> would be distinguished by narrow emission lines. We have modeled the theoretical sulfur and oxygen line shapes for ion precipitation and conclude that electron precipitation is responsible for most of the H- 2 emissions. O ions contributed < 13 % of the precipitating energy flux, and S ions contributed < 50 %. This dominance suggests that field-aligned magnetospheric currents are more important than energetization of energetic ions and subsequent scattering by plasma waves as a mechanism for generating the Jovian aurora. We set an upper limit over our spectra of 35 - 43 R to the emission from ambient oxygen and sulfur ions and their neutrals, except that for the S II 1256 triplet, the upper limit for the nominally brightest line, at 1260 Angstrom, is 74 R. Hence, we find no evidence for the accumulation of sulfur in the auroral ionosphere. A single narrow emission line from an unidentified ambient specie near 1254 Angstrom may be detected at the 4 sigma level, introducing the possibility of complex auroral aeronomy. Differences were observed in the auroral spectral hydrocarbon absorption at different locations, which cannot be interpreted without ambiguity between auroral and atmospheric structural causes. We have found that the brighter emission in an auroral sector consistently shows more spectral hydrocarbon absorption than the dimmer emission. We suggest two alternative physical explanations for this phenomenon. Peer reviewe...|$|E

It was recently reported that <b>ambient</b> <b>emissions</b> of N 2 O from the Great Boiling Spring in the United States Great Basin are high, and attributed to incomplete denitrification by Thermus thermophilus and related bacterial species [Hedlund BP, et al. (2011) Geobiology 9 (6) 471 - 480]. In the present work, we have isolated and characterized the NO reductase (NOR) from T. thermophilus. The enzyme {{is a member of the}} cNOR family of enzymes and belongs to a phylogenetic clade that is distinct from previously examined cNORs. Like other characterized cNORs, the T. thermophilus cNOR consists of two subunits, NorB and NorC, and contains a one heme c, one Ca 2 +, a low-spin heme b, and an active site consisting of a high-spin heme b and FeB. The roles of conserved residues within the cNOR family were investigated by site-directed mutagenesis. The most important and unexpected result is that the glutamic acid ligand to FeB is not essential for function. The E 211 A mutant retains 68 % of wild-type activity. Mutagenesis data and the pattern of conserved residues suggest that there is probably not a single pathway for proton delivery from the periplasm to the active site that is shared by all cNORs, and that there may be multiple pathways within the T. thermophilus cNOR. © PNAS 2013.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a geographic information systems (GIS) model to relate biogenic {{volatile organic compounds}} (BVOCs) isoprene emissions to ecosystem type, as well as environmental drivers such as light intensity, temperature, landscape factor and foliar density. Data and techniques have recently become available which can permit new improved estimates of isoprene emissions over Hong Kong. The techniques are based on Guenther et al., 1993 and Guenther et al., 1999 model. The spatially detailed mapping of isoprene emissions over Hong Kong at a resolution of 100 m and a database has been constructed for retrieval of the isoprene maps from February 2007 to January 2008. This approach assigns emission rates directly to ecosystem types not to individual species, since unlike in temperate regions where one or two single species may dominate over large regions, Hong Kong's vegetation is extremely diverse with up to 300 different species in 1 ha. Field measurements of emissions by canister sampling obtained a range of <b>ambient</b> <b>emissions</b> according to different climatic conditions for Hong Kong's main ecosystem types in both urban and rural areas, and these were used for model validation. Results show the model-derived isoprene flux to have high to moderate correlations with field observations (i. e. r 2 = 0. 77, r 2 = 0. 63, r 2 = 0. 37 for all 24 field measurements, subset for summer, and winter data, respectively) which indicate the robustness of the approach when applied to tropical forests at detailed level, {{as well as the}} promising role of remote sensing in isoprene mapping.

Using residential woodburning emissions as our case study, this paper reports on the first three stages of a four-stage protocol to measure, estimate, and validate <b>ambient</b> residential woodsmoke <b>emissions</b> in Vancouver, British Columbia. The first step is to develop an initial winter nighttime woodsmoke emissions surface using inverse-distance weighting of emissions information from consumer woodburning surveys and property assessment data.

Third, the spatial variation of the surface is used in a location-allocation algorithm to design a network of samplers for the woodsmoke tracer compound levoglucosan and fine particulate matter. Measurements at these network sites are then used in the fourth stage of the protocol (not presented here) : a mobile sampling campaign aimed at developing a high-resolution surface of woodsmoke concentrations for exposure assignment in health effects studies.

It was observed that the post-growth annealing in nitrogen and oxygen ambients strongly affected the green, yellow, orange, and red emissions of ZnO nanotubes. The EL intensities of the green, the yellow, the orange, and the red emissions were gradually increased after annealing in air, oxygen ambients, and decrease in argon ambient. However, in nitrogen <b>ambient,</b> the EL <b>emission</b> of the red peak {{in the range of}} 690 -- 750 nm was increased, and in the range of 620 - 690 nm, it was decreased as compared with the as-grown samples. It was found that more than one deep level defect are involved in producing the red emission in ZnO.|$|R
