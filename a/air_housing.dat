At the start of the 2011-2012 school year, however, a major restructuring took place at the elementary level. This new configuration lead to Bon <b>Air</b> <b>housing</b> all of the Kindergarten through Third Grade students, while Stewart Elementary houses all of the Fourth and Fifth Graders for the district. Bon Air's principal is Ms. Amy Lenart.|$|E

There are parking tiedowns {{for up to}} 36 aircraft on a spacious parking ramp adjacent to the Olympic Air maintenance shop. In 2006, a new 10000 sq ft hangar was built {{to the north of}} Olympic <b>Air,</b> <b>housing</b> the airport's newest FBO (Fixed-Base Operator) Kapowsin Air Sports. The new facility was built to house two planes equipped for skydiving operations as well as an on-site pilot's cafe.|$|E
40|$|Early life is {{a dynamic}} period of growth for the lung and immune system. We {{hypothesized}} that ambient ozone exposure during postnatal development can affect the innate immune response to other environmental challenges in a persistent fashion. To test this hypothesis, we exposed infant rhesus macaque monkeys to a regimen of 11 ozone cycles between 30 days and 6 mo of age; each cycle consisted of ozone for 5 days (0. 5 parts per million at 8 h/day) followed by 9 days of filtered air. Animals were subsequently housed in filtered air conditions and challenged with a single dose of inhaled LPS at 1 yr of age. After completion of the ozone exposure regimen at 6 mo of age, total peripheral blood leukocyte and polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) numbers were reduced, whereas eosinophil counts increased. In lavage, total cell numbers at 6 mo were not affected by ozone, however, {{there was a significant}} reduction in lymphocytes and increased eosinophils. Following an additional 6 mo of filtered <b>air</b> <b>housing,</b> only monocytes were increased in blood and lavage in previously exposed animals. In response to LPS challenge, animals with a prior history of ozone showed an attenuated peripheral blood and lavage PMN response compared with controls. In vitro stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with LPS resulted in reduced secretion of IL- 6 and IL- 8 protein in association with prior ozone exposure. Collectively, our findings suggest that ozone exposure during infancy can result in a persistent effect on both pulmonary and systemic innate immune responses later in life...|$|E

But {{they could not have}} anticipated the phenomenal force required by Cell 4 - even with all eight exhausters running the suction was insufficient. The solution was to build another exhauster set directly next to Cell 4. As there are eight in the <b>Air</b> <b>House,</b> this one was named number 9.|$|R

50|$|The <b>Air</b> <b>House</b> had two functions: blowing or sucking air, {{at up to}} 2,000 mph (for Cell 4). There {{were eight}} {{identical}} GEC compressor/exhauster sets which aggregated to 352,000 horsepower, then the largest installation {{of its kind in}} the western world.|$|R

50|$|For over 50 years Pyestock {{was at the}} {{forefront}} of gas turbine development. It was probably the largest site {{of its kind in the}} world.

Every gas turbine installed in Royal Navy ships was checked here; captured Soviet engines were discreetly examined.|$|R

50|$|The {{amount of}} energy {{required}} to run the <b>air</b> <b>house</b> (see below) at the speed needed was too great for the site's own power station, so electricity {{had to be taken}} from the National Grid. By the early 1970s, Pyestock had to negotiate with the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB) to have enough electricity generated. So as not to strain the grid, Cell 4 could only be powered up at night.|$|R
50|$|Aspergillus penicillioides is {{typically}} found in indoor <b>air,</b> <b>house</b> dust, and on substrates with low water activity, such as dried food, foxy papers and binocular lenses.

The abundance of the fungus is influenced by outdoor climate, with highest numbers found in tropics and lowest numbers in Mediterranean climate. Cool temperature tends to decrease number of A. penicillioides in house dusts.|$|R

50|$|International air waybills {{that contain}} {{consolidated}} cargo are called master air waybills (MAWB). MAWBs have additional papers called <b>house</b> <b>air</b> waybills (HAWB). Each HAWB contains information {{of each individual}} shipment (consignee, contents, etc.) within the consolidation. International AWBs that are not consolidated (only one shipment in one bill) are called simple AWBs. A <b>house</b> <b>air</b> waybill can also be created by a freight forwarder. When the shipment is booked, the airline issues a MAWB to the forwarder, who in turn issues their own <b>house</b> <b>air</b> waybill to the customer.|$|R
5000|$|The largest {{test cell}} on site, Cell 4 {{was built in}} 1965, {{at a cost of}} £6.5 million, as part of the Concorde {{programme}} but also to test other supersonic jet engines. The test cell, unique in the world, takes up most of the steel clad structure with its mass of pipes, blast doors and electronics. It is connected to the <b>Air</b> <b>House</b> by blue pipes and was designed to simulate Concorde's flying conditions - Mach 2 (1522 mph) at 61,000 feet, but could test Concorde's engines at a maximum wind speed of 2,000 mph.|$|R

Construction began in 1949 with small test [...] "cubicles" [...] inside buildings like the Plant House. When the possibility of supersonic jets arose, the site was expanded to the north west, with the <b>Air</b> <b>House</b> and several large test cells built circa 1961.|$|R
