40|$|The thesis {{provides}} methodologies {{for determining}} railway structure gauge and distance between track centres. The first part provides information about reference profile, which is base for determining structure gauge. This {{is followed by}} description {{of different types of}} gauges, related to railway transport. The thesis also presents separation of railways according to number of tracks. The second part is based on Slovenian standard SIST EN 15273 - 3 : 2013. It describes methods for determining structure gauge including all presented widenings (<b>additional</b> <b>overthrows,</b> quasi static effect and random transverse phenomena). In accordance with same standard there are presented methods for determining distance between track centres. The last part of the thesis discusses differences between standard and UIC code 505 - 4 OR. Calculation examples of different railway gauges and distances between track centres are also included...|$|E

One example is that it provides <b>additional</b> incentive to <b>overthrowing</b> governments, which in turn contributes to a cycle of political instability where a promising government might just as soon be toppled as a brutal military regime. [...] There is little incentive for foreign governments to challenge the situation because they benefit from it. [...] The Washington Post quotes Thomas Pogge as saying “most of us do not merely let people starve, but also participate in starving them.” [...] We elect officials that let the corporations buy the natural resources that should belong to the people is the argument for why we are involved. For example oil wealth and dictatorship go together as seen in Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. This international economic and political system perpetuates and reproduces poverty in such that western nations have a negative duty not to do harm {{to the people of}} these nations.|$|R
