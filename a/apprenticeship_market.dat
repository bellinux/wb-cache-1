40|$|We {{examine the}} role of social and {{geographical}} networks in structuring entry into premodern London's skilled occupations. Newly digitized apprenticeship indenture records for 1600 - 1749 offer little evidence that personal ties strongly shaped apprentice recruitment. The typical London apprentices had no identifiable tie to their master through kin or place of origin. Migrant apprentices' fathers were generally outside the craft sector. The <b>apprenticeship</b> <b>market</b> was strikingly open: well-to-do families accessed {{a wide range of}} apprenticeships, and would-be apprentices could match ability and aptitude to opportunity. This fluidity aided human capital formation, with obvious implications for economic development...|$|E
40|$|The most {{important}} {{aim of the}} 'Federal Government's immediate action programme to reduce youth unemployment' is undoubtedly the reduction of youth unemployment and in particular long-term unemployment among young people. In this respect one may assume that in regions with poor initial situations on the labour market and <b>apprenticeship</b> <b>market</b> the possibilities of the immediate action programme for young people will also be used more intensively. Even though this thesis is confirmed, further examination {{makes it clear that}} the range of measures is used very differently in the employment office areas. The behaviour of the labour market players is determined both by structural basic conditions and by alternative possibilities, experiences and co-operation partners. The co-operation of the employment offices with relevant labour market partners is evaluated in depth in ten selected employment office areas. The immediate action programme is seen to {{have a positive effect on}} the intensity of co-operation between the employment office and the youth welfare and social assistance offices. The analysis provides first indications of intensive co-operation between the employment office and other regional players in labour market and social policy resulting in a reduction in youth unemployment. After this the effect that regional disparities and different strategies for implementing the immediate action programme in 1999 had on the development of youth unemployment and persistent unemployment among young people between 1998 and 2000 is analysed using multivariate regression models. Here the considerable influence of the general employment trend on the regional reduction of youth unemployment can be seen. Taking into account regional and structural basic conditions it becomes clear in addition that the use of the immediate action programme only explains to a small extent the differences in the regional development of youth unemployment. It is necessary to emphasise in particular the positive effects that the immediate action programme for young people has on the reduction of long-term unemployment among young people. The proportion of long-term unemployed young people fell more considerably in employment office areas which make increased use of wage subsidies and employment creation measures with partial qualificationfor young people than it did in other areas.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} some first {{empirical evidence}} on premature ter-minations of apprenticeship contracts in Germany. Unlike in previous research, we use human capital theory with a spatial component (follow-ing Wheeler 2001) as a clear-cut {{framework for the}} analysis. Using a German data set that we enriched with various regional-level and job-specific information, we find some evidence for the appropriateness of human capital theory, especially {{with respect to the}} short-term cost of an <b>apprenticeship.</b> Labor <b>market</b> demand (measured as unemployment) also seems to have a decisive impact on the decision to drop out from vocational training...|$|R

30|$|From a {{theoretical}} perspective, apprentice pay must {{be determined by}} the number of days that an apprentice spends in the training firm (and not at school or in other courses), the productivity of an apprentice when performing skilled work, and the intensity of general skills that the training firm provides in the workplace. Thus, to the extent that high quality apprenticeships may be associated with low apprentice pay, an additional emerging factor is the age of an apprentice: while low apprentice pay may be problematic for young adults, it can become an even more important issue for older apprentices. Therefore, in countries where apprenticeships are a potential form of training for young adults that have already acquired at least an upper-secondary education in a general schooling setting, instead of an upper-secondary education for adolescents, apprentice pay is an important issue for firms and can impede their willingness to train {{to such a degree that}} a functioning <b>apprenticeship</b> training <b>market</b> will not emerge.|$|R
30|$|In {{addition}} to having the opportunity to select “the best employees” that would not otherwise be available on the external labour market, firms may {{also be able to}} pay former apprentices a wage below the value of their marginal productivity, provided that labour markets are imperfect (Acemoglu and Pischke 1998, 1999 a,[b]; Stevens 1994 a). Thus, labour market frictions increase a firm’s willingness to make a net investment in apprenticeship training (while at the same time reducing an apprentice’s willingness to make such an investment), as the training firm will obtain part of the return from <b>apprenticeship</b> training. Labour <b>market</b> frictions potentially leading to imperfect labour markets include social partner agreements (collective bargaining), mobility costs of workers, moral hazard, monopsonies (see Muehlemann et al. 2013 b) or the interaction between firm-specific and general skills (see Lazear 2009).|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{main reason}} for the decline of craft guilds in Antwerp should not be sought in the labour market but rather in the product <b>market.</b> <b>Apprenticeship</b> systems, master pieces, and {{trademarks}} were conducive to a]about market monopsony {{but at the same}} time to the representation of product quality. On the one hand, product quality was legitimized through the superior manual skills of masters; on the other, it was objectified through the attribution of quality marks to the characteristics of the raw material used. This strategy was successful for the sale of the durable, expensive, luxury products Antwerp was renowned for until the first half of the seventeenth century, but economic elites and customers stopped favouring corporative regulations when demand shifted towards less expensive and more fashionable products. As guild-based skills were not necessarily superior in reallity, and consumer loyalty ultimately depended upon the masters' trustworthiness, the craft guilds were bound to lose credibility...|$|R
