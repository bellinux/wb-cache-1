50|$|The <b>African</b> <b>firefinch</b> {{generally}} prefers humid, thickly vegetated habitats such as bracken Pteridium aquilinum at forest edges, savanna with acacia woodland, rank grass {{within and}} belowscrub or thornbush, along {{streams and rivers}} with thick vegetation, often near quiet paths or roads. The <b>African</b> <b>firefinch</b> {{can also be seen}} in and around gardens and rural villages but not as commonly as some other firefinch species.|$|E
50|$|The Mount Selinda area {{is home to}} a {{staggering}} array of indigenous African flora, fungi, birds, butterflies, insects and reptiles. This is mainly due to its position adjoining the Chirinda Forest Botanical Reserve which is protected by law.Among the hundreds of indigenous trees found in Mount Selinda are Red mahogany, Brown mahogany, Natal mahogany, Albizia, White stinkwood, Chirinda stinkwood, Ironwood and colossal specimens of strangling figs. The largest Red Mahogany tree in southern Africa, a 1,000- to 2,000-year-old leviathan with a trunk diameter of some 6 metres stands at Mount Selinda.Other smaller flora include thousands of specimens of the yucca-like Dracaena fragrans, numerous ferns, creepers, vines, epiphytes, montbretia, orchids and flame lilies.Due to its proximity to the botanical reserve, Mount Selinda boasts a dazzling array of bird life, with Trumpeter hornbills, Livingstone's turaco, <b>African</b> pygmy kingfishers, <b>Firefinches,</b> Sunbirds, <b>African</b> green pigeons, Owls, Nightjars, Eagles and Bee-eaters.The sheer variety and brilliant colours of butterflies in the area is also noteworthy.Samango monkeys are often seen in the area.The reptile population consists of, amongst others, pythons, cobras, vipers, mambas, adders, chameleons, geckos, skinks and lizards. The endemic chameleon Marshall's leaf chameleon, Rhampholeon marshalli, is found within the forest and at the forest margin and it is scattered sparsely in suitable forest habitat throughout the mountains of the Eastern Highlands.|$|R
5000|$|Four {{subspecies}} of the <b>African</b> <b>firefinch</b> {{are currently}} recognised {{and they are}} set out below with their distributions: ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>African</b> <b>firefinch</b> {{occurs in}} patches across sub-Saharan Africa, from Senegal east to Ethiopia then {{south to the}} {{southern}} Democratic Republic of Congo and Tanzania south through Mozambique to the Eastern Cape province of South Africa.|$|E
50|$|The <b>African</b> <b>firefinch</b> (Lagonosticta rubricata), {{also called}} the dark firefinch or blue-billed firefinch due {{to the color of}} its bill, is a common species of estrildid finch found in almost all parts of Africa. It has an {{estimated}} global extent of occurrence of 5,400,000 km2.|$|E
5000|$|... ==Habits== The <b>African</b> <b>firefinch</b> mainly {{feeds on}} seeds which are {{supplemented}} with insects, it mostly forages on the ground, searching through the soil looking for food. It occurs in pairs or small family parties and may mix with other firefinches, staying close to cover and retreating {{quickly into the}} cover if alarmed.|$|E
50|$|The male <b>African</b> <b>firefinch</b> {{builds the}} nest, {{which is a}} round {{structure}} with a side entrance, the outer shell consists of long, dry grass blades {{and there is an}} inner shell of soft grass inflorescences, this is sometimes lined with feathers. The nest is typically hidden deep in long, thick grass, bracken-briar undergrowth or in grass growing among fallen branches or tree stumps. The 2-5 eggs are laid, in southern Africa, from November-June, with a peak from January-April, further north it breeds later in the year. Both sexes incubate the eggs, incubation lasting about 12 days, once hatched the chicks are fed both parents for 2-3 weeks up to fledging, after which they are fed for 10 more days at which point they become fully independent. The dusky indigobird is a brood parasite of the <b>African</b> <b>firefinch.</b>|$|E
50|$|The pale-billed firefinch Lagnosticta landanae {{of western}} Angola, Cabinda {{and the western}} Democratic Republic of Congo is {{sometimes}} considered a fifth subspecies of <b>African</b> <b>firefinch.</b> Molecular studies have shown is being {{more closely related to}} the nominate subspecies than to any of the other subspecies but it shares some morphological features with L.r. congica.|$|E
50|$|The <b>African</b> <b>firefinch</b> is a {{small red}} or red and brown species of estrildid finch. The male has a lead grey crown, nape and neck, merging on to an olive brown mantles with the scapulars, wing coverts and tertials also olive brown, {{sometimes}} with a grey tinge. The rump, uppertail coverts, outer tail fathers are deep carmine red, {{the rest of the}} tail is black. The underparts from the chin to the belly are deep scarlet, with small white spots on the upper breast and flanks, the scarlet of the flanks continues {{to the side of the}} rump. The centre of the belly is greyish becoming black on the vent and the undertail coverts. the short, pointed bill is blackish-grey with a pink base to the lower mandible. Females are similar to the male but they are less intensely coloured, juveniles lack any red on the underparts. The <b>African</b> <b>firefinch</b> measures 10-11 cm in length and weighs 8.6-11.7g.|$|E
5000|$|The {{song of the}} <b>African</b> <b>firefinch,</b> {{which is}} given by both sexes, {{is made up of}} various ringing notes which are {{randomly}} repeated and interspersed with squeaky whistle, trills and warbles. The alarm call is a harsh ticking which resembles the scolding call of the Eurasian wren. more usual calls are rising trilling twitter [...] " [...] trrrrrrrr-t" [...] and a lowd clear [...] "tui-tui-tui-tui", which is often followed by [...] "wink-wink-wink".|$|E
5000|$|Cameroon Indigobirds {{are known}} for several {{different}} behaviors: song determination and song mimicry. These indigobirds mimic the songs of other bird species (1). The males pick and choose which song they want to mimic; however, when one male chooses a song from a host bird, the other males mimic other songs from a different host species (1). This is {{an effective way to}} discriminate each male from another when mimicking the songs. There are also several distinct host species that the Indigobirds mimic from and the most common host species are Black-bellied Firefinch (Lagonosticta rara) and <b>African</b> <b>Firefinch</b> (L. rubricata) (1).|$|E
