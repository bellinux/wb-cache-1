40|$|Progress in {{the field}} of {{molecular}} genetics has made it possible to identify individuals with an increased risk for a variety of hereditary diseases. To ensure successful implementation of genetic testing and counselling according to patients best interests the attitudes and motives behind testing intentions are important to consider. The main aim of the current thesis was to investigate factors which might facilitate the uptake of genetic testing. Furthermore this research investigated whether potential relatives want to be informed about the existence of hereditary conditions within their family, and under which conditions they want healthcare providers to breach confidentiality in order be informed. Finally, the thesis compares the attitudes of patients with hereditary conditions within their family to the attitudes of the general public concerning these issues. It was hypothesized that interest in receiving genetic risk information would be influenced by both characteristics of the individual and by characteristics of the disease. The role of disease characteristics was studied by using scenarios with systematically varied disease features, namely fatality, treatability and penetrance. Individual factors were investigated by using an extended version of Ajzen’s (1985; 1991) Theory of Planned Behaviour, as well as several individual difference measures such as uncertainty avoidance, worry, coping, self-efficacy, consideration for future consequences, knowledge about genetics, and familiarity with genetic testing. Results showed interest in learning about ones genetic risk to be relatively high, as was the <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> confidentiality <b>breaches.</b> Among the predictors the most important disease characteristic was the treatability of the disease, and the most important individual predictor was uncertainty avoidance. Patients were found to be more positive towards receiving genetic risk information and towards <b>breaches</b> <b>of</b> confidentiality then the general population...|$|R

40|$|The {{crisis of}} 1931 {{was a world}} crisis. The nations of the world, {{just as much as}} they lacked the desire and the {{capacity}} for united political action, lacked the economic techniques and the financial and fiscal apparatus which could have dealt with the fierce and corrosive maladies by which they were beset. The events of 1931 were tragic in themselves, but they were the first act of a far more massive and all-embracing tragedy, whose completion was to take many years. For Britain the crisis was severe and protracted; both in her political life and in her economy she was affected externally and internally, by industrial depression and the growing dangers of military aggression. On September 18, 1931, Japanese troops in Manchuria occupied Mukden on the pretext that the railway had been cut: probably they had done ita themseleves. In any case it was the occasion, not the cause, of the seizure of Manchuria, for which elaborate preparations had been made. Japan had broken the Covenant, the Washington Nine-Power Treaty, and the Pact of Paris; the National Government of Britain, formed in the autumn of 1931, played for safety. Great Britain held the key position at Geneva. As she was the strongest naval power in the League, no sanvtionary action, whether economic or military, could be of any effect without her full participation. Sir John Simon, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, was sharply criticized in various quarters for his cool <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> a gross <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> the Covenant. Inaction, while avoiding danger at the moment, was bound to increase the perils of the future by encouraging aggression elsewhere. Thus, Sino-Japanise crisis of 1931 - 33, in the sequence of events which culminated in the Second World War, provides effective illustrations of British "appeasement policy" of the interwar period...|$|R

The offense of fraud should not be blamed on someone who did it for acts <b>of</b> <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> contract because it is the domain of criminal law.

The characteristic <b>of</b> <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> {{contract is}} seen from the negligence of somebody inimplementaing achievement in the good faith.
