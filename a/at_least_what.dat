500|$|In May 1864, Sherman {{began his}} [...] Atlanta Campaign. [...] Foraker fought {{in a number}} of fierce battles in that campaign, {{including}} Resaca, New Hope Church, and Kennesaw Mountain. [...] Atlanta, or <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>what</b> was left of it after devastating fires, fell on September 2. [...] Foraker was detailed to the Signal Corps school that had been set up by the army at Atlanta, and spent a month there. [...] He was then assigned to Major General Henry W. Slocum's division, and remained with that division as it participated in Sherman's March to the Sea, leaving a swath of destruction behind. [...] In late December 1864, the army reached Savannah, and Foraker, despite a storm, was able to communicate with US Navy ships offshore to alert them to the presence of Sherman's army. [...] After a month, the army marched north into South Carolina, determined to bring even more devastation to the state that had first seceded. [...] Foraker was in charge of maintaining signals between the wings of the army, and was stationed on a gunboat as it moved up the Savannah River. [...] He saw more active duty as a courier between Sherman's main army and Slocum's forces in March 1865 as they met Confederate forces in North Carolina in the Battle of Bentonville. [...] On the day of the battle, March 19, 1865, Foraker was promoted to brevet captain, and was soon thereafter made aide-de-camp to General Slocum. [...] In April, as Sherman's army moved slowly northward, word came of the surrender of Confederate General Robert E. Lee and his forces at Appomattox, Virginia, effectively ending the war. [...] In early May, Sherman's Army of Georgia journeyed north towards Washington, passing in review on May 23 before the new president, Andrew Johnson, sworn in after Lincoln's assassination the previous month. [...] Foraker soon thereafter returned to Ohio, and was mustered out.|$|E

2500|$|Baldwin, on {{the other}} hand, was {{situated}} at Tiberias, a province situated on the Sea of Galilee, approximately a half day’s march from Jacob’s Ford. If any attack were to befall his project, reinforcements {{would be able to}} arrive relatively quickly. Moreover, the fortification at Jacob’s Ford, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>what</b> was completed of it, was relatively strong and was likely able to hold out until relief could arrive in case of siege. As one Crusades author asserts and inquisitively asks, [...] "he siege was effectively a race – could the Muslims crack the stronghold’s defenses before the Latin forces arrived?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Much of {{the play}} is steeped in scriptural allusion. The boy from Act One {{mentions}} {{that he and his}} brother mind Godot's sheep and goats. Much can be read into Beckett's inclusion of the story of the two thieves from Luke 23:39–43 and the ensuing discussion of repentance. It is easy to see the solitary tree as representative of the Christian cross or the tree of life. Some see God and Godot as one and the same. Vladimir's [...] "Christ have mercy upon us!" [...] could be taken as evidence that that is <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>what</b> he believes.|$|E
2500|$|In 1984, the {{long-term}} {{efforts of a}} Navy Jewish chaplain, Rabbi Arnold Resnicoff, to convince the Department of Defense {{to participate in the}} national DRVH were successful. For a number of years he had been making the case at many levels of military leadership that General Eisenhower had already initiated a remembrance program when, after U.S. forces liberated Ohrdruf (a sub-camp of Buchenwald), Eisenhower called for reporters from the U.S. and U.K. to document evidence of the Holocaust, so that, Eisenhower said, the time would never come when such atrocities could be denied, and reports about them could be regarded as mere propaganda. [...] Additionally, Eisenhower's words -- that the American GI did not always understand what he was fighting for, so he should see this evidence, to understand, <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>what</b> he was fighting against —became, Resnicoff successfully argued, the foundation of an historic military effort to remember and learn from the Holocaust that today's military had the duty to honor and carry on.|$|E
2500|$|Upon leaving Mitchell-Lama, {{the owners}} of rental {{buildings}} built since 1974 can raise rents without restriction. Tenants whose buildings had federally-subsidized [...] "236" [...] mortgages may qualify for federal [...] "enhanced" [...] vouchers, which allows them to pay <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>what</b> they were paying and no less than 30% of their income in rent, with a government paying the balance. [...] Tenants who do not qualify for enhanced vouchers, including all tenants in post-1973 buildings that were not federally subsidized, must pay the rent set by the landlords. That the buildings {{are no longer in}} a rent-regulation program poses a particular problem for tenants who were receiving special subsidies that may not cover the new, higher rent payments, such as subsidy programs because of proverty age, and disability. In some of the buildings, tenant associations are negotiating [...] "landlord assistance plans" [...] (LAPs) to implement the increases at a slower rate and to protect some of the weakest tenants. The plans are often limited to a specific number of years, and upon their expiration, tenants may be vulnerable. LAPs do not preserve the stock of affordable housing for future tenants.|$|E
