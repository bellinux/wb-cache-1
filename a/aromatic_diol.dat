The selected diol was 2, 2 -bis[4 -(2 -hydroxyethoxy) phenyl]-propane (Dianol 220). Mixtures consisting of 85 mol % PBT and 15 mol % Dianol were isothermally polymerized in the solid-state at 180 °C while the polymerization time was varied. Combining HPLC and 1 H NMR spectroscopy results showed that Dianol monomer reacts with PBT via two consecutive first-order reactions, the Dianol monoester being an intermediate and fully incorporated Dianol as the final product. The two corresponding reaction rate constants were determined by fitting the first-order equations with experimental data, revealing that free Dianol monomer is more reactive toward transesterification with PBT than its monoester. Dianol was fully incorporated in PBT after a reaction time of 4 h. This result was confirmed by 13 C NMR sequence distribution analysis. SEC measurements showed that the molecular weight and polydispersity first decrease during the SSP reaction due to chain scission of PBT. The subsequent recombination of polymer chains after complete incorporation of all Dianol monomer leads to a buildup of the molecular weight resulting in high molecular weight copolymers...|$|E

The mesogenic diimide diacid was prepared by reacting 3, 32 ̆ 7, 4, 42 ̆ 7 - biphenyltetracarboxylic dianhydride with 11 -amino undecanoic acid using the method of Augl and Wrasidlo. The synthesized polymers were characterized by Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC), IR Spectroscopy, Dilute Solution Viscosity, Thermogravimetry (TGA), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Polarizing Light Microscopy (PLM). The data obtained from GPC indicated {{the presence of a}} wide distribution of molecular weights. The infrared spectra of the polymers showed multiple peaks due to the vibrational coupling of the imide carbonyl groups. The inherent viscosities ranged from 0. 5 g/dL to 1. 65 g/dL. Thermogravimetric analysis showed that these PEIM(s) have high thermal stability in both oxidizing and inert atmosphere. DSC and PLM studies indicated that these poly(ester-imide) s are semi-crystalline and the degree of crystallinity can be increased by annealing above glass transition. They showed all major thermal transitions. The DSC curves of these polymers showed crystal ordering exotherm(s), glass transition and melting endotherm(s). The glass transition temperature of the polymers decreased with {{increase in the number of}} methylene units. The melting point of the even polymers decreased from 136 C (n = 4) to 122 C (n = 12) and interestingly an opposite trend was noticed for 2 ̆ 7 odd 2 ̆ 7 polymers. The melting point of the 2 ̆ 7 odd 2 ̆ 7 PEIM(s) were lower than the 2 ̆ 7 even 2 ̆ 7 ones. These polymers showed a definite odd-even effect in melting point. An additional melting endotherm was observed in the DSC heating curves obtained after annealing the samples at the crystal ordering temperature. This indicated that the title polymers exhibited an enantiotropic liquid crystalline behavior. The optical micrographs of the 2 ̆ 7 even 2 ̆ 7 PEIM(s) observed between crossed polarizers after annealing indicated the presence of an ordered smectic phase below Tm 2 and a less ordered smectic phase around Tm 2. Formation of droplets near the clearing temperature followed by the formation of a coarse texture at a lower temperature in the case of 2 ̆ 7 odd 2 ̆ 7 PEIM(s) are indicative of the presence of a nematic phase, below the isotropic transition temperature. Poly(esterimide) s containing <b>aromatic</b> <b>diols</b> showed higher transition temperatures than those containing aliphatic diols. Multiple endotherms were evident in the DSC thermograms of poly(ester-imide) s containing <b>aromatic</b> <b>diols.</b> The optical micrographs of the aromatic polymers taken at temperatures around Tm were comparable to the fine scale versions of the Schlieren texture. PLM studies and analysis of the cooling traces revealed that poly(ester-imide) s containing aliphatic diols have slow crystallization kinetics.

40|$|Crystals {{constructed}} by hydrogen bonded molecules {{can be viewed}} as having nanostructural elements consisting of ordered, supramolecular hydrogen bonded networks. These networks, whose dimensionalities and motifs are governed by the molecular structure and hydrogen bonding topology of their components, can serve as buildingblocks in the design and synthesis of molecular materials. Robust supramolecular buildingblocks can reduce significantly the number of possible solid state packing motifs, a key goal of crystal engineering strategies which aim to design and synthesize molecular solids with controlled solid state structure and properties. One route to obtain materials with special and novel properties consist in the design of solid state structures by cocrystalization of suitable molecules. The chosen buildingblocks which should be connected via hydrogen bonds were 1, 4 -diaza-components and bifunctional hydrogen bond donors. Phenazine and substituted 1, 4 -diaza- 1, 3 -butadienes are the used diazacomponents whereas the bifunctional hydrogen bond donors are substituted meso- 1, 2 -ethanediols, <b>aromatic</b> <b>diols,</b> dicarboxylic acids and 5, 10 -dihydrophenazine.

In this lecture {{recent advances in}} DMC chemistry for chlorine-free synthesis of five- and six-membered heterocycles will be presented. Reaction of 1, 4 -diols with DMC {{in the presence of}} a base resulted in the chlorine-free synthesis of five-membered cyclic compounds. This synthetic procedure can be also used for the quantitative intramolecular heterocyclisation of bifunctional compounds, i. e., 4 -amino- 1 -butanol to achieve pyrrolidine. Six-member cyclic carbamates have also been synthesized by chlorine-free approach employing DMC chemistry. In fact, reacting a primary amine or a hydrazine with a di(methylcarbonate) derivative of 1, 3 -diols oxazinan- 2 -ones can be synthesized in a one-pot chlorine-free reaction.

40|$|Mounting {{evidence}} {{suggest that}} members of the subfamily of cytosolic glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) possess roles far beyond the classical glutathione-dependent enzymatic conjugation of electrophilic metabolites and xenobiotics. Namely, monomeric forms of certain GSTs are capable of forming protein: protein interactions with protein kinases and regulate cell apoptotic pathways. Due to this dual functionality of cytosolic GSTs, they might be implicated in both the development and the progression of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Prominent genetic heterogeneity, resulting from the gene deletions, as well as from SNPs in the coding and non-coding regions of GST genes, might affect GST isoenzyme profiles in renal parenchyma and therefore serve as a valuable indicator for predicting the risk of cancer development. Namely, GSTs are involved in the biotransformation of several compounds recognized as risk factors for RCC. The most potent carcinogen of polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> hydrocarbon <b>diol</b> epoxides, present in cigarette smoke, is of benzo(a) pyrene (BPDE), detoxified by GSTs.

As a general trend Kau 2 proved to be an extremely enantioselective biocatalyst, the diol products and remaining epoxides of the bioconversions being obtained – with two exceptions – in nearly enantiomerically pure form. Furthermore, the reaction times were usually very short (around 1 h, except when stilbene oxides were used), and the use of organic co-solvent was well tolerated, enabling very high substrate concentrations (up to 75 g/L) to be reached. Even extremely sterically demanding epoxides such as cis-and trans-stilbene oxides were transformed on a reasonable time scale. All reactions were successfully conducted on a 1 -g preparative scale, generating diol-and epoxide-based chiral synthons with very high enantiomeric excesses and isolated yields close to the theoretical maximum. Thus we have here demonstrated the usefulness and versatility of lyophilizedEscherichia coli cells expressing Kau 2 epoxide hydrolase as a highly enantioselective biocatalyst for accessing very valuable optically pure <b>aromatic</b> epoxides and <b>diols</b> through kinetic resolution of racemates or desymmetrization of meso epoxides...|$|R
40|$|The {{function}} of the human nucleotide excision repair (NER) apparatus is to remove bulky adducts from damaged DNA. In an effort to gain insights into the molecular mechanisms involved in the recognition and excision of bulky lesions, we investigated a series of site specifically modified oligonucleotides containing single, well-defined polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> hydrocarbon (PAH) <b>diol</b> epoxide-adenine adducts. Covalent adducts derived from the bay region PAH, benzo[a]pyrene, are removed by human NER enzymes in vitro. In contrast, the stereochemically analogous N(6) -dA adducts derived from the topologically different fjord region PAH, benzo[c]phenanthrene, are resistant to repair. The evasion of DNA repair {{may play a role}} in the observed higher tumorigenicity of the fjord region PAH diol epoxides. We are elucidating the structural and thermodynamic features of these adducts that may underlie their marked distinction in biologic function, employing high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance studies, measurements of thermal stabilities of the PAH diol epoxide-modified oligonucleotide duplexes, and molecular dynamics simulations with free energy calculations. Our combined findings suggest that differences in the thermodynamic properties and thermal stabilities are associated with differences in distortions to the DNA induced by the lesions. These structural effects correlate with the differential NER susceptibilities and stem from the intrinsically distinct shapes of the fjord and bay region PAH diol epoxide-N(6) -adenine adducts...|$|R
40|$|A {{new class}} of {{well-defined}} neutral mono-, and dicationic ruthenium(II) complexes containing a neutral terdentate donor system [C 5 H 3 N(CH 2 E) (2) - 2, 6] (E = PPh 2 (PNP) or NMe 2 (NN'N)) has been found effective as catalyst precursor in N-(cyclo) alkylation reactions of <b>aromatic</b> amines with <b>diols</b> Y(CH 2 CH 2 OH) (2) (Y = CH 2, NR). With these catalysts, N-phenylpiperidine is synthesized from aniline and 1, 5 -pentanediol in 85 % yield (at 180 degrees C for 24 h in 1, 4 -dioxane). With neutral RuCl 2 (NN'N) (PPh 3) as a catalyst precursor, aniline can be selectively N-monoalkylated with diols of the type HO(CH 2) (n) OH (n = 4 - 6, 10) to give N-(n-hydroxyalkyl) anilines in 40 - 75 % yield. To our knowledge, this represents the first useful catalytic route {{to this type of}} compounds. The new catalysts can also be used in the synthesis of arylpiperazines. For example, N-phenyl-N'-methylpiperazine is obtained from aniline and MeN(CH 2 CH 2 OH) (2) in yields up to 34 %. N-[m-(Trifluoromethyl) phenyl]-N'-methylpiperazine, TFMPMP, is successfully produced from m-(trifluoromethyl) aniline and MeN(CH 2 CH 2 OH) (2) in 44 % yield using monocationic [RuOTf(NN'N) (PPh 3) ]OTf as the catalyst precursor. A mechanism for the N-(cyclo) alkylation reaction is proposed...|$|R
40|$|Two {{series of}} {{polyamides}} and polyesters derived from 2, 2 ′-bipyridine- 5, 5 ′-dicarboxylic acid have been synthesized. Different types of aliphatic and <b>aromatic</b> diamine and <b>diol</b> monomers with different structure were polymerized with the diacid or diacid chloride by using different polymerization methods. Most of these polymers exhibited modest thermal stabilities with decomposition {{temperatures in the}} range 320 - 500 °C, depending {{on the structure of}} the polymer main chain. It was found that some polyamides with a rigid main chain formed a lyotropic mesophase when dissolved in concentrated sulfuric acid or HMPA- 4 % LiCl solvent systems. For those polyamides and polyesters with a more flexible main chain, a thermotropic liquid crystal phase was observed. If a long and flexible pendant chain was attached to the polyesters, side chain melting was observed before the onset of the crystalline-nematic transition. The 2, 2 ′-bipyridyl moieties were able to form a complex with ruthenium. These polymer-ruthenium complexes were either synthesized by metalation of the polymers or synthesized directly from the corresponding ruthenium-containing monomer. After the formation of ruthenium complexes, they were able to enhance the photosensitivity and charge carrier mobility of the polymers. The ruthenium-containing polymers also emit red light at ca. 700 nm owing to the emission from the metal-ligand charge-transfer excited states. Some polymers with good film forming properties were fabricated into simple single-layer light-emitting devices, and red light emission was observed when the devices were subjected to forward bias. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Immunoperoxidase methods {{using two}} {{antibodies}} were developed for detection and quantitation of DNA damage in single cells. A monoclonal antibody that recognizes 4 -aminobiphenyl (4 -ABP) -DNA adducts was initially tested on liver tissues of BALBIC mice treated with 4 -ABP, then {{applied to the}} detection of adducts in oral mucosa and exfoliated urothelial cells of smokers and nonsmokers. Levels of 4 -ABP-DNA in exfoliated urothelial cells were elevated in each of 20 smokers (mean relative staining intensity, 517 ± 137) compared with age-, race-, and sex-matched nonsmokers (313 ± 79; P < 0. 0005). Significantly higher damage levels were also observed in oral mucosa cells of smokers compared with nonsmokers (552 ± 157 versus 326 ± 101; P < 0. 0005). A polyclonal antiserum that recognizes benzo(a) pyrene and structurally related polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> hydrocarbon (PAH) <b>diol</b> epoxide-DNA adducts was also applied to the same study samples after validation by staining of 10 T 1 J 2 cells treated with (±) -trans-anti-benzo(a) pyrene diol epoxide. Smokers had higher levels of PAH-DNA damage in oral mucosa and exfoliated urothelial cells than nonsmokers (oral mucosa cells, 684 ± 107 versus 370 ± 83; P < 0. 0005; urothelial cells, 689 ± 72 versus 495 ± 57; P < 0. 0005). A similar 2 - 3 -fold range in relative staining was found in smokers and nonsmokers for both 4 -ABP- and PAIl-DNA, suggesting the importance of individual differences in capacity to metabolize the carcinogens and/or repair damaged DNA. Significant correlations were found among the biomarkers in both cell types. This noninvasive method, requiring small numbers of cells and with a relatively low cost, will be useful for monitoring DNA damage in large-scale molecular epidemiology studies...|$|R
40|$|The {{results from}} the {{laboratory}} experiments of iodine oxide particle (lOP) formation processes and properties are presented. The formation and growth of lOPs, originating from molecular iodine precursor, have been studied at 293 K {{as a function of}} water vapour and sulphuric and oxalic acids vapour. Under dry conditions, a linear variation in total lOP mass in particles was observed for a range of iodine concentrations. The observed hygroscopic growth factors of < 1 at RH 10 - 90 % on addition of H 20 vapour to the particles formed under dry conditions are consistent with the particles having a fractal-like, aggregated structure. The uptake of sulphuric acid vapour onto humidified particles lead to condensational growth, with an accommodation coefficient (α) of 0. 75 ± 0. 05 at RH = 90 % and a predicted growth rate of ~ 0. 03 - 0. 3 nm per hour with respect to marine boundary layer (MBl) conditions. In contrast, growth of particles exposed to oxalic acid vapour was not observed on the experimental timescales employed, indicating an upper limit for ex of 10 - 3 • The deliquescence behaviour of crystalline HI 03 and 1205 at 273 - 303 K, and the properties (e. g. water activity, density, viscosity, and efflorescence) of subsaturated and saturated iodate solutions were investigated. The deliquescence of 1205 and HI 03 crystals at 293 K occurred at a relative humidity of 80. 8 ± 1. 0 % and 85. 0 ± 1. 0 % respectively. These values are consistent with measured water activity values for saturated 1205 and HI 03 solutions at 293 K of 0. 80 ± 0. 01 and 0. 84 ± 0. 01 respectively. Optical and Raman microscope studies at low relative humidity indicate that 103 - solution droplets do not exhibit efflorescence and may become ultra-viscous or glassy under atmospherically relevant conditions. In the presence of humic acid, 103 - photo-chemically transforms to aqueous rand soluble iodinated humic acid and the fixing of iodine within humic structures is likely to occur at <b>aromatic</b> 1, 2 <b>diol</b> groups. Transfer of 12 to the gas phase from the reduction of 103 - to r, shows the oscillatory behaviour of the 'Bray-Liebhafsky' reaction and is enhanced in the presence of H 202 and salinity (CI). The reduction of 103 - to r shows first - order loss rate of (1. 1 ± 0. 1) x 10 - 5 s- 1 which corresponds to a lifetime ~ 2 days for 103 - in marine aerosol. This lifetime is consistent with the THAMOD model predictions. The predicted uptake coefficient of 03 (35 ppbv i. e. an atmospherically relevant concentration) on 100 nM I solution at 293 K was determined as (7. 0 ± 0. 2) x 10 - 7 with a resulting I 2 flux of (2. 9 ± 0. 1) x 109 cm- 2 s- 1 which is ~ 5 times larger than the modelled flux at Sao Vicente (Cape Verde Island) in the tropical Atlantic Ocean. vEThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
