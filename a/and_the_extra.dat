5|$|Cordon area {{congestion}} pricing is a fee or tax paid by users {{to enter a}} restricted area, usually within a city center, {{as part of a}} demand management strategy to relieve traffic congestion within that area. The economic rationale for this pricing scheme is based on the externalities or social costs of road transport, such as air pollution, noise, traffic accidents, environmental and urban deterioration, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>extra</b> costs and delays imposed by traffic congestion upon other drivers when additional users enter a congested road.|$|E

5|$|In March, NASA was {{studying}} {{the possibility of}} flying the first Apollo mission as a joint space rendezvous with the final Project Gemini mission, Gemini 12 in November 1966. But by May, delays in making Apollo ready for flight just by itself, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>extra</b> time needed to incorporate compatibility with the Gemini, made that impractical. This became moot when slippage in readiness of the AS-204 spacecraft caused the last-quarter 1966 target date to be missed, and the mission was rescheduled for February 21, 1967.|$|E

5|$|The Broncos' {{first drive}} {{of the second}} quarter was halted after a holding penalty and an {{incomplete}} pass denied BSU {{a chance for a}} first down. Boise was forced to kick the ball away once more. The Pirates' second drive of the quarter began at their 26–yard line. ECU needed just four plays to march 74yards down the field for a touchdown. On the drive, Chris Johnson rushed for 46yards and threw an 18–yard pass for a touchdown. After the touchdown <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>extra</b> point kick, ECU led 24–7.|$|E

5|$|Odin and Ägir {{used the}} same {{transverse}} and longitudinal steel frame construction as the Siegfried-class ships. The ships had eight watertight compartments and a double bottom for about 60% {{of the length of}} the hull. As in the Siegfrieds, a ninth watertight compartment was added when the ships were lengthened. The ships were described as good sea boats; they had gentle motion and were very responsive to commands from the helm. The ships lost significant speed in heavy seas, however. The ships had a crew of 20officers and 256 enlisted men, with an additional 6officers and 22men when serving as a flagship. The refit increased crew requirements, to an additional 31sailors normally, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>extra</b> flagship crew increased to 9officers and 34men.

5|$|Promotion, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>extra</b> income {{this would}} bring, now became {{a matter of}} {{considerable}} concern to Scott. In the Royal Navy however, opportunities for career advancement were both limited and keenly sought after by ambitious officers. Early in June 1899, while home on leave, {{he had a chance}} encounter in a London street with Clements Markham, who was now knighted and President of the Royal Geographical Society (RGS), and learned for the first time of an impending Antarctic expedition with the Discovery, {{under the auspices of the}} RGS. It was the opportunity for early command and a chance to distinguish himself, rather than any predilection for polar exploration which motivated Scott, according to Crane. What passed between them on this occasion is not recorded, but a few days later, on 11 June, Scott appeared at the Markham residence and volunteered to lead the expedition.|$|E

5|$|Ship {{services}} in Nordhordland started in 1866, and in 1923 {{the first car}} was purchased. A car ferry service between Isdalstø in Lindås and Steinestø in Åsane on the mainland was established on 7 July 1936. A plan was launched whereby all traffic from Nordhordland would be collected {{in one place and}} transported across Salhusfjorden to Åsane. By moving the ferry quay from Isdalstø to Knarvik, the length of the ferry service could be reduced. However, the fares would be kept the same <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>extra</b> revenue used to finance a bridge from Flatøy to Lindås. This allowed the Alversund Bridge to open in 1958, and the ferry service from Flatøy and Meland to move to Knarvik. The proposal to cross Salhusfjorden was launched during the planning of the Alversund Bridge. Cost estimates were made based on the Golden Gate Bridge in the United States, but it proved too expensive for a suspension bridge crossing between Frekhaug and Salhus.|$|E

5|$|Following the kickoff, Virginia Tech's offense {{began work}} to cut Nebraska's lead before halftime. The Hokies started at their 20-yard line after a touchback, and Druckenmiller {{completed}} a 20-yard throw to Bryan Jennings after Oxendine was stopped for no gain on a carry to the left. From the Tech 40-yard line, Oxendine carried the ball 39 yards for another first down deep inside Nebraska's {{half of the}} field. Nebraska committed a five-yard offsides penalty, but Virginia Tech was stopped for short gains on the two plays following the penalty. Virginia Tech was forced to use a timeout {{in order to stop}} the clock from moving and to allow time to plan the third-down play. With 57 seconds remaining in the first half, Parker ran the remaining two yards for a first down at the Nebraska 11-yard line. Druckenmiller then completed a five-yard pass to Cornelius White, but because White was unable to get out of bounds or cross the goal line, Tech was again forced to call a timeout to stop the clock with 25 seconds remaining. On the next play, Druckenmiller completed a six-yard pass to Shawn Scales for Tech's second touchdown of the game. The score came with 19 seconds remaining in the first half, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>extra</b> point was good, cutting Nebraska's lead to 1714.|$|E

It is also called Compton Place Lock or Twyford Lock, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>extra</b> flow {{compared}} to other locks may explain the erosion that has taken place, resulting in a circular area of water between {{the upper and lower}} gates. Just above Shawford Bridge, the river and navigation diverged, with Shawford Mill just below the junction. The building still stands. The bridge is a modern construction, and is located at a point where the towpath crosses to the western bank. Just to the south is a weir at the site of Shawford Single Gates, which probably ensured the mill had an adequate head of water. The village of Twyford lies to the east, and the Twyford Drain splits, with the western channel rejoining the river below the mill, and the eastern channel continuing as a relief channel. There are two more locks on the navigation, called Malm Lock and College Mead Lock, before the navigation rejoins the river. By the junction is the intake for Otterbourne Water Treatment Works.|$|E
