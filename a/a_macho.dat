5000|$|Sam {{is subject}} to and satire of masculinity. He is {{described}} as [...] "a sleazy, promiscuous, aggressive, exhibitionistic narcissist", one of the [...] "new macho heroes" [...] of the 1980s pop culture, [...] "the target of humor," [...] and not a [...] "likely candidate to lead the post-feminist counter revolution." [...] Like Sam, <b>a</b> new <b>macho</b> hero of the 1980s {{is the opposite of}} <b>a</b> pre-1980s <b>macho</b> hero that [...] "constituted an antifeminist backlash".|$|R

25|$|David is {{a failed}} comedian and rocker who also fails {{to grasp the}} notion of {{political}} correctness. He tends to either {{make a fool of}} himself in front of the office crew or make it intensely uncomfortable.

The problem is that Anne is engaged to Luc, <b>a</b> <b>macho</b> warehouse employee.|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} [...] "Beat It" [...] have been {{described}} as a [...] "sad commentary on human nature". The line [...] "don't be <b>a</b> <b>macho</b> man" [...] is said to express Jackson's dislike of violence, whilst also referring to the childhood abuse he faced at the hands of his father Joseph. The song is played in the key of E [...] minor at a moderately fast tempo of 138–139 beats per minute. In the song, Jackson's vocal range is B3 to D5.|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert, {{who gave}} the film {{three and a half}} out of four stars in a Chicago Sun-Times review, enjoyed that the story is [...] "always about more than boxing" [...] with its deeper themes [...] "about a girl growing up in <b>a</b> <b>macho</b> society and ... {{discovering}} she has a nature probably more macho than the men around her". On the other hand, the San Francisco Chronicle Edward Guthmann opined that Kusama [...] "ultimately undercuts her theme of female self-reliance by having Diana fall for Adrian" [...] and criticized the plot for [...] "tak too much time justifying a woman's right to be in the ring – instead of celebrating her achievement".|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} less positive reviews as well. Allan Johnson of the Chicago Tribune {{wrote that the}} episode is good, but not great: [...] "It proves stunt-casting doesn't necessarily work unless the actor {{is up to the}} script and lead performers. And Douglas, an otherwise fine actor, basically does a caricature of <b>a</b> <b>macho</b> gay man." [...] Ted Cox of the Daily Herald wrote that the idea of Douglas being cast as a neurotic gay man [...] "isn't a whole lot to this episode." [...] A television reviewer from Deseret News thought that because of his role on Will & Grace, Douglas should give the Oscar he won earlier in his career back. The reviewer concluded: [...] "He's embarrassingly bad, as is this episode." ...|$|E
500|$|On its release, Me Estoy Enamorando was {{met with}} {{positive}} reviews from music critics. AllMusic editor Terry Jenkins gave the album four-and-a-half out of five stars, calling it a [...] "fine romantic record". John Lannert of Billboard magazine noted that the recording sports [...] "a daring blend of bolero/pop/ranchera sounds". Mario Tarradell of The Dallas Morning News felt that Fernández's vocals [...] "caresse... every song on Me Estoy Enamorando" [...] and praised his delivery. Taradell also complimented the production commenting that the recording [...] "benefits from Mr. Estefan Jr's hallmark production: uncluttered, bright, easy on the ears" [...] as well as Santander's songwriting. On the title track, he compared Fernández to Mexican ranchera singer Javier Solís: [...] " [...] Like Solis, Fernandez can whisper soft and compassionate requests for requited love, and belt out tortured sobs of pain while still retaining <b>a</b> <b>macho</b> posture that says, 'Yes, I'm crying, but I'm not giving up'." ...|$|E
500|$|Ultimately, the {{producers}} turned to 30-year-old Sean Connery for five films. It is often reported that Connery won the role through a contest {{set up to}} [...] "find James Bond". While this is untrue, the contest itself did exist, and six finalists were chosen and screen tested by Broccoli, Saltzman, and Fleming. The winner of the contest was a 28-year-old model named Peter Anthony, who, according to Broccoli, had a Gregory Peck quality, but proved unable {{to cope with the}} role. When Connery was invited to meet Broccoli and Saltzman he appeared scruffy and in unpressed clothes, but Connery [...] "put on an act and it paid off" [...] as he acted in the meeting with <b>a</b> <b>macho,</b> devil-may-care attitude. When he left both Saltzman and Broccoli watched him through the window as he went to his car, both agreeing that he was the right man for Bond. After Connery was chosen, Terence Young took the actor to his tailor and hairdresser, and introduced him to the high life, restaurants, casinos and women of London. In the words of Bond writer Raymond Benson, Young educated the actor [...] "in the ways of being dapper, witty, and above all, cool".|$|E

500|$|Adam Baldwin as Jayne Cobb– a mercenary. He and Mal {{met when}} they were on {{opposite}} sides of a dispute; Mal, while held at gunpoint, offered Jayne his own bunk and a higher cut than his current employer, so Jayne switched sides and shot his then-partners. In the original pilot, [...] "Serenity", he intimates to Mal that he did not betray him because [...] "The money wasn't good enough." [...] However, previously he had pointedly asked the Alliance agent whether he would be required to turn on the captain to help him, and in [...] "Ariel" [...] defends his actions in alerting the authorities regarding Simon and River by claiming he had not intended to betray Mal. He is someone who can be depended on in a fight. He tends to act like a [...] "lummox" [...] who thinks he is the smartest person in space, but occasional hints of intelligence peek through this façade, giving the impression that he acts dumber than he is. As Whedon states several times, Jayne is the man who will ask the questions that no one else wants to. Even though he is <b>a</b> <b>macho</b> character, he has shown a particularly intense fear of Reavers, more so {{than the rest of the}} crew. Despite his amoral mercenary persona, he sends a significant portion of his income to his mother, again suggesting that there is more to his character than what he presents to the rest of the crew.|$|E

This production emphasised the physical brutality of the taming, with <b>a</b> <b>macho</b> Lockhart often aggressively lashing out at [...] Scardifield, who began as a punk rebel, but who became less and less assertive as the play went on. Katherina's final speech was delivered in a manner suggesting she was terrified of disagreeing with Petruchio.|$|E
2500|$|Wilson Yip {{stated that}} Ip Man 2 {{is a much}} better film than its {{predecessor}} in terms of characterization and storyline. The film focuses on disputes between the disciples of Hung Ga and Wing Chun martial arts, as well as the conflict and rivalry of the two practitioners. Wing Chun, as taught by Ip Man, is being viewed as a martial art meant only for girls; Hung Ga, as taught by Hung Chun-nam, is being seen as <b>a</b> <b>macho</b> form of boxing. Of the two characters, Yip commented, [...] "Sammo Hung's character is not exactly villainous, but he's very overbearing, just like his torrential Hung Ga. In contrast, Ip Man is very unassuming, much like his fist." [...] Yip also stated that the film has some moments of [...] "family drama", such as the ongoing conflict between Ip and his wife Wing-Sing.|$|E
2500|$|Peter [...] "Pete" [...] Beale is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the BBC soap opera EastEnders, played by Peter Dean. He makes {{his first appearance}} in the programme's first episode, on 19 February 1985. The character was created by Tony Holland, one of the creators of EasEnders; he {{was based on a}} member of Holland's family. Pete is featured in the soap for eight years as the local fruit and veg trader of Albert Square; {{he is a member of}} the original focal clan in the serial, the Beales and Fowlers. Pete is portrayed as <b>a</b> <b>macho</b> and somewhat insensitive individual who struggles to cope with emotion. Pete was axed from the soap in 1993 and departed in May that year after over eight years on-screen. The character was killed off-screen later that year following Peter Dean's public criticism of the BBC.|$|E
