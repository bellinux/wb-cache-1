Roughly two dozen people worked on the game, though not <b>all</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time. It was initially planned for a 16-megabit cartridge, but four additional megabits were eventually added to expand the game. Development spanned about two years.|$|E

Dallager was appointed as superintendent of the USAF Academy in June 2000 and was promoted to lieutenant general on 1 August of the same year. Dallager's appointment and promotion were criticized by observers because of his involvement in the controversial shootdown after-actions and refusal to testify for the senate investigation. Dallager retired on 1 September 2003, but at the rank of major general.|$|E
5|$|Carl Berners plass {{became a}} public {{transport}} station on 1 February 1923, when the then single-track Sinsen Line of the tramway opened as {{a branch of}} the Rodeløkka Line. The station took its name from the square it was located at, Carl Berners plass, which is again named for the politician Carl Berner. The station was served by the newly created Line 13 that operated through the city center and ran every twelve minutes, and since 29 June 1924 every fifteen minutes. The line was built by Kristiania Sporveisselskap, but they were taken over by the municipality in 1924, and the line became part of Oslo Sporveier. On 28 June 1938, the line was rebuilt to double track. From 19 December 1939, the line was extended along Trondheimsveien to Sinsen; this section was built with double track. In 1948, the tracks at Carl Berners plass was rebuilt to run through the roundabouts {{at both ends of the}} square. The station was served by various services numbers along the Sinsen Line, including 1, 3, 7, 13 and 17, although not <b>all</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time. At the most, three services operated to the station, giving a five-minute headway.|$|E
5|$|Forum members whose ruses are {{discovered}} by their support groups are frequently banned from such communities—sometimes after demanding that site administrators do so—moving to other websites to display other ailments. Denise Grady noted in The New York Times {{that the woman}} with the eating disorder moved to a group for sexual abuse survivors then another where she claimed to be dying of AIDS. An article in The Weekend Australian highlighted an example of this in 2003: a woman in London admitted to belonging to online support forums dedicated to helping members cope with migraines, grieving over dead children, and breast cancer, <b>all</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time. She told a psychiatrist that she would study a specific malady and subsequently present herself with its symptoms; her time at each forum followed a daily schedule.

25|$|Barotraumas of ascent {{are also}} caused when the free change of {{volume of the}} gas in a closed space {{in contact with the}} diver is prevented. In this case the {{pressure}} difference causes a resultant tension in the surrounding tissues which exceeds their tensile strength. Besides tissue rupture, the overpressure may cause ingress of gases into the tissues and further afield through the circulatory system. This pulmonary barotrauma (PBt) of ascent is also known as pulmonary over-inflation syndrome (POIS), lung over-pressure injury (LOP) and burst lung. Consequent injuries may include arterial gas embolism, pneumothorax, mediastinal, interstitial and subcutaneous emphysemas, not usually <b>all</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time.|$|E

25|$|Since the Stelo was the {{currency}} of Esperantists, {{a good example of}} its utility was the publication of a monthly magazine and the payment of rents and salaries.

25|$|On 28 October 2011, the Japanese Atomic Energy Commission {{presented}} a timetable in a draft report titled, “how to scrap the Fukushima reactors”. Within 10 years, a start {{should be made}} with the retrieval of the melted fuel within the reactors. First, the containment vessels of reactors 1, 2 and 3 should be repaired, then all should be filled with water to prevent radiation releases. Decommissioning {{would take more than}} 30 years, because the pressure vessels of the reactor vessels are damaged also. After the accident at Three Mile Island in 1979, some 70 percent of the fuel rods had melted. There, the retrieval of the fuel was started in 1985, and completed in 1990. The work at Fukushima was expected to take significantly longer because of the far greater damage and the fact that 4 reactors would need to be decommissioned <b>all</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time.|$|E

After his multi-year {{residency}} at Wynn Las Vegas, yet not embarking on a multi-city tour for thirteen years, Brooks announced plans for a world tour during an interview on Good Morning America in December 2013. He later confirmed his tour and plans for an upcoming album during a press conference on July 11, 2014. On July 15, Brooks stated on his website that each city on the tour will be individually released, and the first concert {{will take place at}} the Allstate Arena in Rosemont, Illinois. Days later, Brooks announced ten additional shows, <b>all</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> arena. Brooks has continued the pattern of announcing the next city every few weeks, both in an effort to generate excitement and urgency, as well as an attempt to combat ticket resale. Since its official announcement in July 2014, the tour has been in extremely high demand. Typically, two or three shows are announced in one market at a time, with more shows added based on real-time statistics of demand.|$|E
