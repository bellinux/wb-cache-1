500|$|Endoscopic {{retrograde}} cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is {{the most}} common approach in unblocking the bile duct. This involves endoscopy (passing a fiberoptic tube through the stomach into the duodenum), identification of the ampulla of Vater and insertion of a small tube into the bile duct. A sphincterotomy (making a cut in the sphincter of Oddi) is typically done to ease the flow of bile from the duct and to allow insertion of instruments to extract gallstones that are obstructing the common bile duct; alternatively or additionally, the common bile duct orifice can be dilated with a balloon. Stones may be removed either by direct suction or by using various instruments, including balloons and baskets to trawl the bile duct in order to pull stones into the duodenum. Obstructions that are caused by larger stones may require the use of an instrument known as a mechanical lithotriptor in order to crush the stone prior to removal. Obstructing stones that are too large to be removed or broken mechanically by ERCP may be managed by extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy. This technique uses <b>acoustic</b> <b>shock</b> waves administered outside the body to break down the stones. [...] An alternative technique to remove very large obstructing stones is electrohydraulic lithotripsy, where a small endoscope known as a cholangioscope is inserted by ERCP to directly visualize the stone. A probe uses electricity to generate shock waves that break down the obstructing stone. [...] Rarely, surgical exploration of the common bile duct (termed choledochotomy), which can be performed with laparoscopy, is required to remove the stone.|$|E

40|$|Abridged) Aims: We {{characterize}} {{the dynamics of}} the quiet inter-network chromosphere by studying the occurrence of <b>acoustic</b> <b>shocks</b> and their relation with the concomitant photospheric structure and dynamics. Methods: We analyze a comprehensive data set that includes high resolution chromospheric and photospheric spectra obtained with the IBIS imaging spectrometer in two quiet-Sun regions. This is complemented by high-resolution sequences of MDI magnetograms of the same targets. From the chromospheric spectra we identify the spatio-temporal occurrence of the <b>acoustic</b> <b>shocks.</b> We compare it with the photospheric dynamics by means of both Fourier and wavelet analysis, and study the influence of magnetic structures. Results: Mid-chromospheric shocks occur as a response to underlying powerful photospheric motions at periodicities nearing the acoustic cut-off, consistent with 1 -D hydrodynamical modeling. However, their spatial distribution within the supergranular cells is highly dependent on the local magnetic topology, both at the network and internetwork scale. Large portions of the internetwork regions undergo very few shocks, as "shadowed" by the horizontal component of the magnetic field. The latter is betrayed by the presence of chromospheric fibrils, observed in the core of the CaII line as slanted structures with distinct dynamical properties. The shadow mechanism appears to operate also on the very small scales of inter-network magnetic elements, and provides for a very pervasive influence of the magnetic field even in the quietest region analyzed.

For initial flux densities of 1, 000, 000 ergs/sq cm/sec in the lower chromosphere, the local efficiency of acoustic transmission into the corona can be much higher than that calculated for a plane parallel atmosphere. Acoustic energy will tend to be deposited at higher chromospheric levels in diverging magnetic fields, and magnetic guiding may influence the temperature profile of the network and plages. The total flux that can be transmitted into the corona along such diverging fields is severely limited since the magnetic elements occupy a small fractional area of the photosphere and the transmission efficiency is a rapidly decreasing function of initial flux density.
