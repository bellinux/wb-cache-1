5|$|It {{had long}} been {{established}} Marcher custom to solve conflicts through private warfare. Hereford's problem, however, was his relative weakness in the Marches, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>he</b> was facing open conflict with two different enemies. He therefore {{decided to take the}} issue to the king instead, in a break with tradition. King Edward again ordered Gloucester to stop, but the earl ignored the order and initiated raids on Hereford's lands. Hostilities continued and Hereford responded, until both earls were arrested and brought before the king. The real offense was not the private warfare in itself, {{but the fact that the}} earls had not respected the king's injunction to cease. In the parliament of January 1292, Gloucester was fined 10,000 marks and Hereford 1,000. Gloucester's liberty of Glamorgan was declared forfeit, and confiscated by the crown, as was Hereford's of Brecon.|$|E
5|$|One day, Santosh meets Hasini, {{a college}} student and is {{immediately}} attracted seeing her childish attitude and jovial nature. Santosh slowly befriends Hasini and both fall in love, {{but he does not}} have the courage to inform about his love to his father. Santosh gets spotted along with Hasini by Subramaniam <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>he</b> reveals his love affair. Subramaniam is furious upon hearing this as Santosh is already engaged to Rajeshwari. Subramaniam asks Santosh to bring Hasini to his home and make her stay with them for a week so that he will make Santosh understand that Rajeshwari is the better bride for him. Santosh agrees, believing that Hasini will impress Subramaniam. Hasini lies to her father Govindan that she is going for a college trip and leaves for Santosh’s home.|$|E
5|$|Other researchers, like Larry Martin {{believe that}} dromaeosaurids, {{along with all}} maniraptorans are not dinosaurs at all. Martin {{asserted}} for decades that birds were unrelated to maniraptorans, but in 2004 he changed his position, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>he</b> agrees that the two are the closest of relatives. Martin believes that maniraptorans are secondarily flightless birds, and that birds evolved from non–dinosaurian archosaurs, so {{that most of the}} species formerly called theropods would now not even be classified as dinosaurs.|$|E

5|$|It {{was at this}} battle, {{regardless}} of exactly when and where this occurred, that a defining moment of Epaminondas's early life would happen. Epaminondas saved the life of his fellow Theban Pelopidas; Pelopidas, after receiving seven wounds in front, sank down upon a great heap of friends and enemies who lay dead together; but Epaminondas, although he thought him lifeless, stood forth to defend his body and his arms, and fought desperately, single-handed against many, determined to die rather than leave Pelopidas lying there. <b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>he</b> too was in a sorry plight, having been wounded in the breast with a spear and in the arm with a sword, when Agesipolis the Spartan king came to his aid from the other wing, and when all hope was lost, saved them both. Plutarch says that this incident firmly cemented their friendship, and Pelopidas would be Epaminondas's partner in politics for the next twenty years.|$|E

25|$|As {{an amateur}} linguist, Evans was {{acquainted with the}} Devanagari script used in British India; in Devanagari, each letter stands for a syllable, and is {{modified}} to represent the vowel of that syllable. Such a system, now called an abugida, readily lent itself to writing a language such as Swampy Cree, which had a simple syllable structure of only eight consonants and four long or short vowels. Evans was also familiar with British shorthand, presumably Samuel Taylor's Universal Stenography, from {{his days as a}} merchant in England; <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>he</b> acquired familiarity with the newly published Pitman shorthand of 1837.|$|E
25|$|Having {{dealt with}} the {{foregoing}} issues, Holmes now confronted whether West Virginia had a duty {{to pay for the}} new bonds and certificates issued by Virginia between 1871 and 1900 in its attempt to discharge the one-third debt remaining on its books. The Supreme Court had ruled on the legality of Virginia's debt substitution and duty to pay in numerous cases over the past. Citing Hartman v. Greenhow, 102 U.S. 672 (1880) and McGahey v. Virginia, 135 U.S. 662 (1890), in particular, Holmes observed that the Court had already intimated that West Virginia had a duty to pay these outstanding debts, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>he</b> reaffirmed that duty explicitly.|$|E
25|$|This {{rebellion}} became entangled {{with the}} Kumul rebellion, when a Chinese Muslim and Uyghur army under Ma Zhancang and Timur Beg marched on Kashgar against the Chinese Muslim Daotai Ma Shaowu and his garrison of Han Chinese troops.

The Kirghiz were not amused at how their rebellion was crushed the previous year by Ma Shaowu, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>he</b> wanted them to defend the city. They defected en masse to the enemy. However, Ma Zhancang also entered into secret negotiations with Ma Shaowu; he and his troops soon defected to the Han Chinese garrison in the city.|$|E

People shouted anti-government remarks and sang the national anthem and the Szekler anthem, then marched to the nearby city hall. Later, at the proposal of the MIÉP chairman, they went to the Hungarian Socialist Party's (MSZP) headquarters on Corvin Street, which was secured by the police. Traffic was blocked by the demonstrators in parts of the inner city.|$|E

25|$|In 1860 London {{intellectual}} life was alive with talk of evolution.

Busk was an FRS, became PRCS, {{and a member of the}} X Club. Flower succeeded John Thomas Quekett as Conservator of the Hunterian Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons of England on the recommendation of Huxley and others. He started work in January 1862 and held the post for 22 years.|$|E

25|$|Marzuban then laid siege to Barda, but {{received}} {{news that}} the Hamdanid amir of Mosul, Nasir al-Daula, had sent his nephew al-Husain b. Sa'id to take over Azerbaijan. In 942, during the war between Marzuban and Daisam, al-Husain had been invested {{with the government of}} the province by the caliph, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>he</b> intended to make good on his claim. The Hamdanid had reached Salmas and had gained the support of the Kurds. Marzuban left a small force to keep the Rus in check, and in a winter campaign (945-946) defeated al-Husain. A short time later al-Husain was recalled by Nasir al-Daula, who was preparing for a war against the Buwayhid amir of Baghdad. The Rus meanwhile decided to leave, taking as much loot and prisoners as they could.|$|E
25|$|During 1812 {{the people}} of the Caribbean provinces in New Granada {{remained}} mostly royalist. Those in the Santa Marta region had built strongholds at Tenerife and Chiriguana on the Magdalena River, leading the revolutionaries of Cartagena to burn the towns. On August 14, 1813, insurgent forces from Cartagena attacked Santa Marta itself, but were repulsed by a flank of royalist defenders near the city. With the defeat of Napoleon in 1814 and the return of Ferdinand VII to the throne, the Spanish authorities, {{at the behest of the}} king, decided to send troops to the Americas to reclaim the territories that had proclaimed themselves independent. From the point of view of the criollos, the king was ignoring the loyalty the American provinces had shown when he was in exile in France, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>he</b> was asserting his right to govern as an absolute ruler.|$|E
