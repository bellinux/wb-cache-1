Massive farmland conversion requires a tremendous amount of funding for resettling the farmers. In addition, to compensate farmers for their loss in <b>agricultural</b> <b>profit,</b> the state has committed to supplying them with grains and funds for planting trees and grass. This results in a prescribed allotment of 60 yuan per mu by the central policy. A further complication is farmer dissatisfaction when the government fails to deliver on its contract, since the local government usually bases compensation on actual production value, resulting in compensation between 20-50 yuan, plus a 300 jin appropriation of grain.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{measures}} {{the economic impact}} of climate change on US agricultural land by estimating the effect of the presumably random year-to-year variation in temperature and precipitation on <b>agricultural</b> <b>profits.</b> Using long-run climate change predictions from the Hadley 2 Model, the preferred estimates indicate that climate change will lead to a $ 1. 1 billion (2002 $) or 3. 4 % increase in annual profits. The 95 % confidence interval ranges from -$ 1. 8 billion to $ 4. 0 billion and the impact is robust {{to a wide variety of}} specification checks, so large negative or positive effects are unlikely. There is considerable heterogeneity in the effect across the country with California’s predicted impact equal to -$ 2. 4 billion (or nearly 50 % of state <b>agricultural</b> <b>profits).</b> Further, the analysis indicates that the predicted increases in temperature and precipitation will have virtually no effect on yields among the most important crops. These crop yield findings suggest that the small effect on profits is not due to short-run price increases. The paper also implements the hedonic approach that is predominant in the previous literature. We conclude that this approach may be unreliable, because it produces estimates of the effect of climate change that are very sensitive to seemingly minor decisions about the appropriate control variables, sample and weighting. Overall, the findings contradict the popular view that climate change will have substantial negative welfare consequences for the US agricultural sector.

40|$|AbstractDesigning landscapes {{that can}} meet human needs, while {{maintaining}} functioning ecosystems, {{is essential for}} long-term sustainability. To achieve this goal, we must better understand the trade-offs and thresholds {{in the provision of}} ecosystem services and economic returns. To this end, we integrate spatially explicit economic and biophysical models to jointly optimize <b>agricultural</b> <b>profit</b> (sugarcane production and cattle ranching), biodiversity (bird and mammal species), and freshwater quality (nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment retention) in the Brazilian Cerrado. We generate efficiency frontiers to evaluate the economic and environmental trade-offs and map efficient combinations of agricultural land and natural habitat under varying service importance. To assess the potential impact of the Brazilian Forest Code (FC), a federal policy that aims to promote biodiversity and ecosystem services on private lands, we compare the frontiers with optimizations that mimic the habitat requirements in the region. We find significant opportunities to improve both economic and environmental outcomes relative to the current landscape. Substantial trade-offs between biodiversity and water quality exist when land use planning targets a single service, but these trade-offs can be minimized through multi-objective planning. We also detect non-linear profit-ecosystem services relationships that result in land use thresholds that coincide with the FC requirements. Further, we demonstrate that landscape-level planning can greatly improve the performance of the FC relative to traditional farm-level planning. These findings suggest that through joint planning for economic and environmental goals at a landscape-scale, Brazil's agricultural sector can expand production and meet regulatory requirements, while maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem service provision...|$|E
40|$|Agriculture-based {{irrigation}} {{communities of}} northern New Mexico have survived for centuries despite the arid {{environment in which}} they reside. These irrigation communities are threatened by regional population growth, urbanization, a changing demographic profile, economic development, climate change, and other factors. Within this context, we investigated the extent to which community resource management practices centering on shared resources (e. g., water for agricultural in the floodplains and grazing resources in the uplands) and mutualism (i. e., shared responsibility of local residents to maintaining traditional irrigation policies and upholding cultural and spiritual observances) embedded within the community structure influence acequia function. We used a system dynamics modeling approach as an interdisciplinary platform to integrate these systems, specifically the relationship between community structure and resource management. In this paper we describe the background and context of acequia communities in northern New Mexico and the challenges they face. We formulate a Dynamic Hypothesis capturing the endogenous feedbacks driving acequia community vitality. Development of the model centered on major stock-and-flow components, including linkages for hydrology, ecology, community, and economics. Calibration metrics were used for model evaluation, including statistical correlation of observed and predicted values and Theil inequality statistics. Results indicated that the model reproduced trends exhibited by the observed system. Sensitivity analyses of socio-cultural processes identified absentee decisions, cumulative income effect on time in agriculture, and land use preference due to time allocation, community demographic effect, effect of employment on participation, and farm size effect as key determinants of system behavior and response. Sensitivity analyses of biophysical parameters revealed that several key parameters (e. g., acres per animal unit or percentage of normal acequia ditch seepage) which created less variable system responses but which utilized similar pathways to that of the socio-cultural processes (e. g., socio-cultural or physical parameter change → <b>agricultural</b> <b>profit</b> → time in spent in agriculture → effect on socio-cultural or physical processes). These processes also linked through acequia mutualism to create the greatest variability in system outputs compared to the remainder of tests. Results also point to the important role of community mutualism in sustaining linkages between natural and human systems that increase resilience to stressors. Future work will explore scenario development and testing, integration with upland and downstream models, and comparative analyses between acequia communities with distinct social and landscape characteristics. acequia irrigation; community sustainability; system dynamics; coupled natural-human systems; connected hydrologic-human systems; dynamic hypothesis; leverage points; model development; sensitivity analysi...|$|E

Therefore, upstream farmers have no incentive to consider the economic impacts that salinity inflict on others. Downstream salinity is generated principally by upstream agricultural activities. Downstream irrigation and municipal water users are impacted by salinity. Water policies can be designed to reduce salinity considering impacts on <b>agricultural</b> <b>profits.</b> This study evaluates the economic impacts on <b>agricultural</b> <b>profits</b> of six salinity control alternatives for the Rio Grande Project. These alternatives are no control, land retirement, irrigation water price, water allocation adjustments, water allocation based on economic efficiency, and canal lining. ^ A salt balance analysis was first conducted to investigate salt trends, salt flow, and/or salt accumulation in the region. Second, agricultural production functions were estimated. Third, salinity control alternatives were evaluated within a regional optimization model (RGP) {{to determine the effect}} of changes in salinity on agricultural users. The RGP model included agricultural benefits, water and land availability, and water quality constraints. The model estimated river water quality, crop patterns, and cost of salinity control alternatives that maximized agricultural benefits. Then, a benefit cost analysis was developed to select the cost effective alternative. ^ The annual salt flow passing between gage stations from San Marcial (New Mexico) to Fort Quitman (Texas) seemed to be invariable. While downstream salinity concentration increases as irrigation deliveries reduce water flow in the river, indicating that salinity policies for the Rio Grande Project should address salinity concentration and not salt load. ^ The RGP results showed that the downstream regional profits may be increased by reducing downstream salinity concentration as TDS. Downstream farmers respond by substituting less profitable crops for economically more profitable crops. The proposed salinity control policies contribute differently to regional <b>agricultural</b> <b>profits</b> because each alternative differs in its effects on water allocation, land use, and water quality. The estimated benefit-cost ratio for salinity control using water allocation based on adjustment and economic efficiency are greater than estimated ratios for the other alternatives, but the feasibility of a alternative not only depend of the economic variables but also on other legal and political factors. The economic, political, legal implications of a canal lining scenario are less significant than the estimated for other alternatives. Therefore, the lining of canal systems in the Rio Grande Project is considered the preferred alternative to improve water quality for downstream users in the Rio Grande Project, with a direct benefit of $ 2 per $ 1 of estimated cost. ...|$|R
