25|$|Immunity is the {{capability}} of multicellular organisms to resist harmful microorganisms from entering it. Immunity involves both specific and nonspecific components. The nonspecific components act as barriers or eliminators {{of a wide range}} of pathogens irrespective of their <b>antigenic</b> <b>make-up.</b> Other components of the immune system adapt themselves to each new disease encountered and are able to generate pathogen-specific immunity.|$|E

Sharp discontinuities are shown to exist between the 2 groups in some parameters, sufficient, under certain conditions, to justify {{creation of a new}} species designation for the Laredo-type amoebae. Nevertheless, this action is not recommended at the present time because of the small number of “aberrant” strains so far isolated, and because of the limited comparative studies so far carried out...|$|E
40|$|Studies on the {{characterization}} of salivarian trypanosomes are at present developing rapidly and difficulties in communication tend to arise because of different procedures in the different laboratories concerned. Terms {{can be divided into}} two classes, those that are purely operational and simply describe the laboratory history of the organism, and those that imply characterization. Of the Linnaean taxa, the section Salivaria and the four subgenera thereof, Duttonella, Nannomonas, Pycnomonas, and Trypanozoon, are useful at the present time but lower taxa are often unsatisfactorily defined. Characters such as the clinical course of infection, which have been used for subspeciation, are being found to correlate with such characters as isoenzyme patterns, <b>antigenic</b> <b>make-up</b> and DNA constitution...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY A biphasic {{system for}} the bulk growth of Neisseria gonorrhoeae is described. It appears to combine the {{convenience}} of liquid media with the growth qualities of solid media. By using the agar in dialysis tubes rather than as slabs the surface-to-volume ratio was improved and harvesting made easier. The system is also useful in isolating gonococci from blood and joint fluids in patients with disseminated infection. Introduction Materials and method Any major investigation of the <b>antigenic</b> or chemical <b>make-up</b> of Neisseria gonorrhoeae requires the growth of large quantities of bacteria. Although N. gonorrhoeae grows well on solid media, and suc...|$|R
40|$|The surface <b>antigenic</b> <b>make-up</b> of 10 HHV- 6 {{isolates}} from {{cases of}} infantile disease was analyzed by immunofluorescence assay with 5 monoclonal antibodies (Mabs). Three Mabs {{were directed to}} glycoproteins (gps) expressed in cells infected with the HHV- 6 variant A prototype GS, and 2 to gps expressed in cells infected with the HHV- 6 variant B prototype Z 29. Of the 10 viral isolates, all belonging to HHV- 6 variant B, 9 showed a similar Mab reactivity, while 1, from a case of gastroenteric illness, differed widely from the others. The HHV- 6 isolates studied also differed from the variant B prototype Z 29 {{for the absence of}} reactivity to one of the Mabs. The choice of the HHV- 6 new isolates as variant B prototypes is recommended...|$|E
40|$|T THE PRESENT TiME most {{investigators}} {{will accept}} the morphologic evidence suggesting that platelets originate from the cytoplasm of megakaryocytes. 1. 2 The demonstration of a common chemical make-up of platelets and megakaryocytes can be approached by recently developed im-munochemical technics. In the present study an anti-human platelet serum was labeled with fluorescein and the conjtmgated antibody {{was used as an}} immunocytochemical stain on human platelets and megakaryocytes according to the fluorescent antibody technic of Coons and Kaplan. 3 The results gave direct evidence for the presence of at least one common antigen in platelets and megakaryocytes. Using a similar approach, Humphrey 4 demonstrated a common antigenic strtmcture between guinea pig platelets and megakaryocytes. The similar <b>antigenic</b> <b>make-up</b> of these cells offers additional support to the original hypothesis of that platelets take their origin from megakaryo-cytes...|$|E
40|$|In 42 {{patients}} with autoimmune thrombocytopenia (AITP) {{and a positive}} direct platelet suspension immunofluorescence test (PSIFT), the antigenic specificity of the autoantibodies was studied. Because the autoantibodies were often not detectable in the serum and additional HLA antibodies may disturb the reaction pattern with the platelet panel, we used eluates prepared from the patients' platelets for this study. Thirty-five patients had antibodies equally reactive with normal platelets, irrespective of their <b>antigenic</b> <b>make-up,</b> {{but not with the}} platelets from two Glanzmann's disease patients. Absorption and elution experiments in two patients showed that his was probably not due to the presence of a combination of anti-Zwa and anti-Zwb antibodies. Thus, the majority of autoantibodies against platelets seems to be directed against antigenic determinants not present on Glanzmann's disease platelets, but perhaps located on the platelet-membrane glycoproteins IIb and/or IIIa. In ten patients, antibodies of no, or still unknown, specificity were detected. Three of these had additional antibodies not reactive with the platelets of the two Glanzmann patient...|$|E
40|$|Biochemical {{investigation}} of the pathogenesis of Heymann Nephritis. This study describes biochemical comparison of proximal tubule antigens from the brush border membrane (BBM) of dog and rat kidney. The purpose {{was to determine if}} a difference in BBM composition could explain the inability to produce either active or passive Heymann Nephritis in the dog. Although the membrane composition as revealed by coomassie blue staining on 4 to 11 per cent polyacrylamide electrophoresis varied considerably between rats and dogs, polyclonal antibodies (rabbit anti-rat, rabbit anti-dog) against purified BBM from both species immunoprecipitated five identical polypeptides. Four bands were visualized between 70 kd and 170 kd; but the major polypeptide had an apparent molecular wt of ˜ 460 kd. This high molecular wt constituent and three of the other peptides were bound specifically to lentil lectin column, confirming their glycoprotein nature. Only the 460 kd polypeptide was immunoprecipitated by monoclonal antibody against gp 330. Since both rat and dog BBM contain gp 330, believed to be the sole pathogenic antigen in Heymann Nephritis, we conclude that failure to produce active or passive Heymann Nephritis in the dog using the same protocol that is successful in rats cannot be attributed to differences in <b>antigenic</b> <b>make-up</b> of the brush border membrane...|$|E
40|$|The factors {{regulating}} {{the expression of}} the Lewis blood group related antigens in tissues have yet to be clarified. In an attempt to resolve some of the existing controversies the quantitative interrelationship of the Le(a), Le(b), X and Y antigens in normal urothelium and transitional cell carcinomas (TCC) was studied using biopsy specimens derived from 22 patients whose ABO and Lewis red blood cell phenotype was known. A quantitative scale was devised to encompass both the extent and intensity of the immunohistochemical reactivity in one numerical value (score). The expression of these four antigens in the normal urothelium followed a characteristic pattern that is related to but not identical with the red blood cell phenotype. An excess of Le(b) and Y in the urothelium correlated with the Le(a-b+) red blood cell phenotype, while a relative increase in Le(a) and X (at the expense of Le(b) and Y) was associated with the Le(a+b-) red blood cell phenotype. This pattern can be accounted for by the combined effects of differential gene expression and substrate availability. The quantitative comparison of the <b>antigenic</b> <b>make-up</b> of TCCs with the corresponding normal tissue phenotype shows consistent trends, suggesting that the changes associated with neoplasia derive primarily from the suppression of specific gene products and, secondarily, from altered competitive substrate utilisation...|$|E
40|$|The 3 '-terminal 853 nt (and the {{putative}} 283 aa) {{sequence of the}} VP 2 -encoding gene from 29 field strains of porcine parvovirus (PPV) were determined and compared both {{to each other and}} with other published sequences. Sequences were examined using maximum-parsimony and statistical analyses for nucleotide diversity and sequence variability. Among the nucleotide sequences of the PPV field strains, 26 polymorphic sites were encountered; 22 polymorphic sites were detected in {{the putative}} amino acid sequence. Mapping polymorphic sites of protein data onto the three-dimensional (3 D) structure of PPV VP 2 revealed that almost all substitutions were located on the external surface of the viral capsid. Mapping amino acid substitutions to the alignment between PPV VP 2 sequences and the 3 D structure of canine parvovirus (CPV) capsid, many PPV substitutions were observed to map to regions of recognized antigenicity and/or to contain phenotypically important residues for CPV and other parvoviruses. in spite of the high sequence similarity, genetic analysis has shown the existence of at least two virus lineages among the samples. in conclusion, these results highlight the need for close surveillance on PPV genetic drift, with an assessment of its potential ability to modify the <b>antigenic</b> <b>make-up</b> of the virus.

40|$|Rat thymus and T cell-surface antigens were {{analyzed}} using one-and two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). For this purpose, cell-surface glycoproteins of rat lymphocytes were radiolabeled with 125 I by lactoperoxidase, purified on a Lentil lectin-coupled Sepharose 4 B column, and were reacted with anti-rat T lymphocyte xenoantiserum (ATLS). When 125 I labeled glycoproteins of rat thymus and T cells were immunoprecipitated with unabsorbed ATLS and analyzed by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE, a number of antigenic components with different molecular weights (M. W.) were found on these cells. Thus, these components comprised glycoproteins with M. W. of 150 K. 130 K, 94 K, 90 K, 75 K, 67 K, 62 K, 57 K, 55 K, 50 K, 45 K, 43 K and 30 K daltons, respectively. Among these components, 90 K (T 90), 67 K (T 67), 62 K (T 62) and 43 K (T 43) M. W. glycoproteins appeared specific for rat thymus and T cells, because these components could be found on rat thymus and T cells {{as well as on}} thymoma cells but not on rat bone marrow and leukemic B cells (KNL- 14). Absorption studies demonstrated that these antigenic components did not exist in non-lymphoid tissues, including rat brain, liver, kidney and fibrosarcoma cells (KMT- 17). Two dimensional PAGE analysis of these rat T cell-specific glycoproteins clearly showed that, while T 67 and T 62, the latter being found in some preparations of rat T cell glycoproteins, exhibited marked charge heterogeneity with pI between 5. 8 and 7. 5, T 90 and T 43 were identified as acidic glycoproteins with pI of 5. 7 and 5. 5, respectively. The anti-rat Tcell serum (ATLS) used in this study was also cross-reactive with mouse thymus and T cells, from which the antiserum immunoprecipitated cell-surface glycoproteins similar to found on rat thymus and T cells. These data clearly suggest that rat thymus and T cells possess a complex <b>antigenic</b> <b>make-up</b> on their cell surfaces, comparable to that of murine T cells with a variety of Ly antigen systems...|$|E
40|$|Monoclonal {{antibodies}} (MoAbs) directed primarily against immature {{lymphoid cells}} (VIL-A 1, BA- 2, OKT 10) or recognizing antigens {{associated with the}} B cell lineage (VIB-C 5, OKI 1) {{were used for the}} identification of lymphoid cells in liver, bone marrow, spleen and thymus of human fetuses between 8 and 20 weeks of gestational age. Many lymphocytes in liver, bone marrow and spleen reacted with the MoAbs used. In the fetal thymus, however, cells did not bind to the VIL-A 1 and VIB-C 5 MoAbs and only a few cells were BA- 2 + or OKI 1 +. In the liver and bone marrow the VIL-A 1, VIB-C 5 and BA- 2 MoAbs reacted almost exclusively with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) containing cells, pre-B and B cells. TdT+ cells were present in liver, bone marrow and thymus, but not in the spleen. In liver and bone marrow the relative numbers of TdT+ cells decreased during gestation, in the thymus they increased. The <b>antigenic</b> <b>make-up</b> of the TdT+ cells in liver and bone marrow was comparable to that of pre-B and B cells in these organs: most of them reacted with VIL-A 1, VIB-C 5 and OKT 10 MoAbs and many were BA- 2 + and OKI 1 +. TdT+ cells in liver and bone marrow did not bind to T-cell-markers, i. e. OKT 6 and WT- 1. A few lymphoid cells in these organs contained TdT and mu heavy chains. TdT+ cells in the thymus had a completely different phenotype: most of them were OKT 6 + and they did not react with the VIL-A 1 and VIB-C 5 MoAbs. These findings suggest that TdT+ cells in fetal liver and bone marrow are precursors of the B cell lineage, whereas those in the thymus probably belong to the T cell lineage. In the fetal spleen almost all B cells displayed the VIB-C 5 and OKI 1 antigens. At 12 weeks of gestation greater than 80 % of splenic B cells were also VIL-A 1 + and BA- 2 +; with ongoing gestation far less B cells in spleen expressed these antigens, however, indicating that these B cells are more mature than those in fetal liver and bone marrow, but still less mature than the B cells in postnatal blood and bone marrow, which do not display the VIL-A 1 and BA- 2 markers. These findings suggest that some further maturation of B cell stages takes place in the spleen during human fetal life...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects on}} the {{antibody}} content of the population which result from repeated exposure to antigenic variants of influenza viruses have been studied by measuring, with many strains, the antibody content of lots of gamma globulin prepared in different years and the patterns of antibody found in sera collected in 1 year from various age groups. In all samples of gamma globulin collected from 1943 through 1951, high levels of antibody were found with strains of Type A and Type B influenza viruses isolated prior to 1941. The highest levels {{were found in the}} more recent collections of gamma globulin. Antibodies to A-prime, and to B strains of 1945 and 1952, were present at low levels in gamma globulin collected prior to the isolation of these viruses. A moderate increase in antibody was observed in the gamma globulin of recent years. The pattern of distribution of antibody by age found with most A-prime strains in serum pools exhibited high levels in infancy and childhood, but after the age of 20, little or no antibody was detected. With Type A strains antibody was usually not observed until the 11 th year of age. Thereafter, high levels were present until age 20, when the amount of antibody declines to a moderate and relatively constant level which persists throughout life. Antibody against swine influenza virus did not become detectable until the 29 th year. The intermediate antigenic character of a few A-prime isolates was reflected in the antibody pattern obtained with them. Antibody was not found until age 13 with the Lee (1940) strain of Type B influenza virus, but thereafter the level was high. With the type B isolates of 1945 and 1952, antibody became measurable at earlier ages. The present data clearly demonstrate that {{in the early years of}} life the range of the antibody spectrum is narrow, and that it becomes progressively broader in later life. A striking correlation was found between what is known of the periods of prevalence of certain strains of influenza viruses and the age of the people in whom strain-specific antibodies are currently found. It has been observed that the age at which antibodies to certain strains are first detectable has progressively advanced with the passage of time. From these data the following immunologic thesis is formulated. The antibody which is acquired during the initial infections of childhood is of limited scope and reflects the dominant antigens of the prevailing strains. The immunity conferred by the initial experiences with influenza is also limited. Successive experiences later in life with viruses of related but differing <b>antigenic</b> <b>make-up</b> result in a composite of antibody which is oriented toward a larger number of the common antigens which comprise influenza virus. These experiences confer a broader immunity which limits infection with, and antibody response to, the more recently encountered strains. The antibody-forming mechanisms appear to be oriented by the initial infections of childhood so that exposures later in life to antigenically related strains result in a progressive reinforcement of the primary antibody. The highest cumulative antibody levels detectable in a particular age group tend, therefore, to reflect the dominant antigens of the virus responsible for the childhood infections of that group. Hence the pattern of antibody distribution determined currently in different age groups provides a serologic recapitulation of past infection with antigenic variants of influenza viruses...|$|E
