40|$|ABSTRACT. This paper {{considers}} {{the question of}} what <b>knowing</b> <b>a</b> logical rule consists in. I defend the view that <b>knowing</b> <b>a</b> logical rule is having propositional knowledge. Many philosophers reject this view and argue for the alternative view that <b>knowing</b> <b>a</b> logical rule is, at least at the fundamental level, having a disposition to infer according to it. To motivate this dispositionalist view, its defenders often appeal to Carroll’s regress argument in ‘What the Tortoise Said to Achilles’. I show that this dispositionalist view, and the regress that supposedly motivates it, operate with the wrong picture of what is involved in <b>knowing</b> <b>a</b> logical rule. In particular I show that it gives us the wrong picture of the relation between <b>knowing</b> <b>a</b> logical rule and actions of inferring according to it, {{as well as of the}} way in which <b>knowing</b> <b>a</b> logical rule might be a priori...|$|R

25|$|The {{classical}} Advaita Vedanta explains all {{reality and}} everything in the experienced world to be same as the Brahman. To Advaitins, there is a unity in multiplicity, {{and there is no}} dual hierarchy of a Creator and the created universe. All objects, all experiences, all matter, all consciousness, all awareness, in Advaita philosophy is not the property but the very nature of this one fundamental reality Brahman. With this premise, the Advaita school states that any ontological effort must presuppose <b>a</b> <b>knowing</b> self, and this effort needs to explain all empirical experiences such as the projected reality while one dreams during sleep, and the observed multiplicity of living beings. This Advaita does by positing its theory of three levels of reality, the theory of two truths, and by developing and integrating these ideas with its theory of errors (anirvacaniya khyati).|$|E
25|$|When Walter {{arrives in}} Albuquerque – on his 52nd {{birthday}} – he intimidates Gretchen and Elliott into putting his remaining {{money into a}} trust fund for Walter Jr. He then visits Skyler and gives her the location of Hank's body so she can clear herself as a suspect in his death, and finally admits {{to her that he}} entered the meth business for himself, not his family. As a token of appreciation, Skyler lets him see his children one last time. He then arranges to see Lydia, secretly poisoning her with ricin after learning where Jack has taken Jesse. Walt drives to Jack's compound and demands to see Jesse. When they bring Jesse, who has been chained up in a lab and forced to cook meth since his abduction, Walt dives atop him while simultaneously starting a remote machine gun mounted in his car that kills most of Jack's men. Walt and Jesse kill Jack and Todd. Walt urges Jesse to kill him, but Jesse notices Walt had been shot by his own trap and tells him to do it himself. Walt then finds that he has been fatally wounded. He answers a call from Lydia on Todd's phone and coldly informs her that she is going to die. He exchanges <b>a</b> <b>knowing</b> nod with Jesse, who escapes the compound. Walt takes a moment to admire the lab equipment that Jesse had been using, and finally succumbs to his wounds and collapses dead on the floor as the police arrive and sweep the lab.|$|E

Ashby and Schofield agree with Mulvany that musically, Viking metal bands generally are unconnected with a real Viking past, but instead connote a broader sense of the maritime, presuming that [...] "this conflation of maritime contexts is <b>a</b> <b>knowing</b> one, but one nonetheless felt to be somehow evocative." ...|$|E

[...] As the Old Coot walks away, his voice grows deeper with a more exaggerated Scottish accent, further supporting this idea.

500|$|Despite {{its many}} inconsistencies, Knight's and Gorman's {{conspiracy}} theory {{has captured the}} imagination of other authors, who have made further modifications to the story. For example, Melvyn Fairclough's The Ripper and the Royals (London: Duckworth, 1991) asserted that Lord Randolph Churchill was the [...] "third man", although Fairclough later disowned his own book and told reporters that [...] "he no longer believes the theory". Andy Parlour, Sue Parlour and Kevin O'Donnell, authors of The Jack the Ripper Whitechapel Murders (St. Osyth, Essex: Ten Bells Publishing, 1997), supposed that Mary Jane Kelly was pregnant with Albert Victor's child instead of Annie Crook. These, and other books which promote Sickert from <b>a</b> <b>knowing</b> accomplice to being Jack the Ripper himself, such as Jean Overton-Fuller's Sickert and the Ripper Crimes (Oxford: Mandrake, 1990) and Patricia Cornwell's Portrait of a Killer (2002), are marketed as non-fiction books, but they are dismissed almost universally as derivative fantasies based on Knight's initial flawed analysis.|$|E

500|$|The music video, {{directed}} by Mary Lambert, {{who worked with}} Madonna in her video for [...] "Borderline", was shot in Venice and partly in New York City in July 1984.

It alternated with scenes of a provocative-looking Madonna on board a gondola. She commented, [...] " [...] {{wanted me to be}} the modern-day, worldly-wise girl that I am. But then we wanted to go back in time and use myself as an actual virgin." [...] The video starts with Madonna boarding on a boat from the Brooklyn Bridge and travels to Venice. As she steps down into the city, she moves like a stripper and undulated sinuously. She wears a black dress and blue pants with a number of Christian symbol embedded jewelry around her neck. She sings the song at full volume as she watches a lion walking between the columns of the Piazza San Marco of Venice and along the statute of Saint Mark.|$|E
