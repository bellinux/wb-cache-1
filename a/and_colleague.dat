Eventually, a mono mix-down of North's original recordings, which had survived in the interim, would be released as a limited-edition CD by Intrada Records.|$|E
5|$|Hergé's {{decision}} {{to name a}} character Topolino was a reference to Walt Disney, whose character of Mickey Mouse was known as Topolino in Italian. Hergé included a reference to his friend <b>and</b> <b>colleague,</b> the former opera singer Edgar P.

5000|$|About 80 {{species of}} Morchella were {{described}} until {{the turn of}} the century (http://www.indexfungorum.org/), a number of which were later shown to be illegitimate or synonyms. As molecular tools became widely available in the new millennium, a revived interest in the genus commenced and several new species were proposed. In 2008 Kuo described Morchella tomentosa from burned coniferous forests in western North America. In 2010 Işiloğlu <b>and</b> <b>colleagues</b> described Morchella anatolica, a basal species from Turkey later shown to be sister to Morchella rufobrunnea. A study by Clowez described over 20 new species in 2012. In the same year, another study by Kuo <b>and</b> <b>colleagues</b> described 19 species from North America, while molecular phylogenetics currently suggest there are over 60 species of Morchella worldwide. An extensive taxonomical and nomenclatural revision of the genus provided by Richard <b>and</b> <b>colleagues</b> in 2014, applied names to 30 of the genealogical lineages recognized so far and clarified several synonymities. Also in 2014, Elliott <b>and</b> <b>colleagues</b> described Morchella australiana from sclerophyll forests in Australia, while Clowez <b>and</b> <b>colleagues</b> described Morchella fluvialis from riparian forests in Spain. In 2015, Loizides <b>and</b> <b>colleagues</b> clarified the taxonomy of Morchella tridentina, a cosmopolitan species described under many names, and recombined Morchella kakiicolor as a distinct species. [...] Later in the same year, Clowez <b>and</b> <b>colleagues</b> described Morchella palazonii from Spain, while Voitk <b>and</b> <b>colleagues</b> described Morchella laurentiana from Canada and Morchella eohespera, a cosmopolitan species present in several continents. In an extensive phylogenetic and morphological study from Cyprus in 2016, Loizides <b>and</b> <b>colleagues</b> added two more Mediterranean species, Morchella arbutiphila and Morchella disparilis, and resurrected Morchella dunensis as an autonomous species. In the same year, Taşkın <b>and</b> <b>colleagues</b> described four of the previously unnamed phylospecies from Turkey: Morchella conifericola, Morchella feekensis, Morchella magnispora and Morchella mediteterraneensis.|$|R
30|$|In this study, tDCS {{was applied}} on F 3 and F 4 {{to stimulate the}} right and left DLPFC. This agreed with Mottaghy <b>and</b> <b>colleagues</b> [35] who {{demonstrated}} that {{the right and left}} DLPFC are involved in working memory. Berryhill <b>and</b> <b>colleagues</b> [36] concluded that anodal tDCS applied on F 3 or F 4 improves performance of working memory in highly educated subjects. Sarkis <b>and</b> <b>colleagues</b> [28] stated that F 3 and F 4 are the most common electrode placement positions in the studies attempting to enhance cognition using tDCS. Baschi <b>and</b> <b>colleagues</b> [37] concluded that anodal tDCS applied over F 3 with intensity 2  mA activated DLPFC. Mir-Moghtadaei <b>and</b> <b>colleagues</b> [38] also reported that DLPFC is represented by F 3 -F 4 in respect to the international 10 - 20 electroencephalography (EEG) electrodes.|$|R

5|$|Dustbin Baby is a BBC {{television}} film directed by Juliet May, based on Jacqueline Wilson's 2001 {{novel of the}} same name. It was first broadcast on BBC One on 21 December 2008. The film stars Dakota Blue Richards as April, a troubled teenager who was abandoned in a dustbin as an infant, and Juliet Stevenson as Marion Bean, April's adoptive mother. David Haig stars as Elliot, Marion's friend <b>and</b> <b>colleague.</b> The screenplay was written by Helen Blakeman, and the film was produced by Kindle Entertainment. Dustbin Baby deals with themes including maternal bonding, bullying, and youth crime. The story revolves around April running away on her fourteenth birthday, while Marion searches for her.

5|$|In 2012, McDonald {{conducted}} a phylogenetic analysis of iguanodonts incorporating data from new Eolambia specimens. Contrary to previous authors, he found instead that Eolambia was the sister group of Probactrosaurus. This close relationship {{was based on}} two shared characteristics: the quadrate being straight save for the top end, which is curved backwards; and {{the top and bottom}} margins of the scapular blade being nearly parallel. Wenjie Zheng <b>and</b> <b>colleagues</b> added Jintasaurus to the group in 2014, while José Gasca <b>and</b> <b>colleagues</b> recovered the original group in 2015. However, McDonald extensively revised his phylogenetic dataset further in preparation for the 2017 description of the FMNH specimens. As with Horner <b>and</b> <b>colleagues,</b> as well as Prieto-Márquez and Norell, McDonald <b>and</b> <b>colleagues</b> found that Eolambia was the sister group of Protohadros, with both of them being placed as basal hadrosauromorphs (results reproduced below). Using the 2012 version of the McDonald dataset, Francisco Verdú <b>and</b> <b>colleagues</b> independently recovered a similar result, with Eolambia being closely related to Protohadros and Jeyawati; however, McDonald <b>and</b> <b>colleagues</b> found the latter to be more derived in 2017.|$|R
5|$|Gray was {{a leading}} {{opponent}} of the Scientific Lazzaroni, a group of mostly physical scientists who wanted American academia to mimic the autocratic academic structures of European universities. A {{large percentage of the}} original 50 members of the National Academy of Sciences were Lazzaroni members. The American Academy of Arts and Sciences was opposed to the National Academy and collectively elected Gray and his friend, colleague, and fellow Charles Darwin supporter William Barton Rogers to the National Academy. Rogers founded the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This is one of the areas where Gray and his friend <b>and</b> <b>colleague,</b> Louis Agassiz, were in disagreement; Agassiz {{was a member of the}} Lazzaroni group.

5|$|Hergé's {{depiction}} of the San Theodoran carnival was drawn largely from images of the Nice Carnival. Among the revelers, he included those dressed in the costumes of various different cartoon and film characters, such as Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Asterix, Snoopy, Groucho Marx, and Zorro. Hergé also included a band known as the Coconuts into the carnival scene; these were not developed by Hergé himself but were rather the creations of his friend <b>and</b> <b>colleague</b> Bob de Moor, who had devised them for his own comic series, Barelli. The street that they were marching down, Calle 22 de Mayo, was named after Hergé's own birthday, 22 May.|$|E

5|$|In San Francisco, a {{group of}} young men drive to an {{abandoned}} factory, and drug one of their members with LSD, leaving him to be torn apart by what he perceives to be a monster. Later, a large quantity of suspicious ash found in a nearby park is proven to be from human remains. A private investigative organisation, the Millennium Group, dispatches offender profiler Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) <b>and</b> <b>colleague</b> Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) to investigate the multiple homicide that led to this. Black believes that the victims were burnt alive; while chemical analysis of the ash leads the Group to the same factory.|$|E

Bryce accosts Roe, calling her a failure. That night, Gordon is killed, and Bryce is kidnapped. Millennium Group criminal profiler Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) learns that Gordon {{died of a heart}} attack, which the coroner believes was caused by fear. Black visits the crime scene, and sees visions of Lucy Butler (Sarah-Jane Redmond), a woman who killed his friend <b>and</b> <b>colleague</b> Bob Bletcher (in season one's Lamentation). Meanwhile, Bryce is bound and gagged in a remote farmhouse, then left in a room with the would-be escapee. The woman from earlier tells Bryce she loves him.|$|E
5|$|In early 1950, St. Laurent {{considered}} recommending {{the appointment}} of Howe as governor general. The governor general {{had always been a}} British peer; many nationalists wanted a Canadian to hold the post, and St. Laurent agreed with them. The governor general, The Viscount Alexander, was due to retire by 1953, by which time Howe would be 68. St. Laurent saw this as a way of allowing his friend <b>and</b> <b>colleague</b> to step away from politics for a quieter life. The minister was willing to take the post, but the position unexpectedly opened early when Alexander was appointed to the British Cabinet. Howe decided he still had work to do as a minister. He was also reluctant to exchange real power for the nominal power of the governor generalship. St. Laurent recommended {{the appointment of}} Canadian-born Vincent Massey, who was duly appointed by King George VI.|$|E
