5|$|King {{shows how}} enslaved {{children}} were educated for survival and resistance. This education was usually informal <b>and</b> <b>parental</b> and {{taught how to}} deal with slaveowners and their abuse. King also named literacy and religion's role in their education. Kids were taught mutual cooperation as a virtue between slaves. Few slaves had formal education and those who did were artisans. Those educated or given religious training were only by the fortune of their owner's interests. King's stories tell of children in domestic, farm, and industrial work, who spent their free time in celebrations, dances, games, folk rituals, and hunting.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Research {{explaining}} {{childhood obesity}} has been usually focused on {{cognitive and behavioral}} predictors assessed in parents only or in children only. In contrast, the dyadic approach allows to evaluate how <b>parental</b> <b>and</b> child predictors operate together to explain child physical activity (PA) and body fat. This study investigated relationships among: (1) <b>parental</b> <b>and</b> child perceptions of accessibility and safety of exercise facilities for children, (2) <b>parental</b> <b>and</b> child PA, <b>and</b> (3) <b>parental</b> <b>and</b> child body fat percentage. Design: A prospective and dyadic study with two measurement points was conducted. The follow up (Time 2) took place at 7 – 8 -month after the baseline (Time 1). Methods: Data were collected among 922 dyads of parents (mean age 35. 97 years old; 83. 9...|$|R
5|$|The 2007 {{version was}} {{announced}} September 12, 2006. A tabbed interface {{allows users to}} access the Norton Protection Center and the program settings without separate tray icons and windows open. Symantec revised Norton Internet Security and made this version more modularized, which has reduced the suite's memory usage to 10–15 megabytes and scan times by 30–35 percent. Another result is that spam filtering <b>and</b> <b>parental</b> controls are separate components to install. When installed, the features consume 100 MB of disk space.|$|E
5|$|The period since Madsen's {{monograph}} {{has been}} marked by a great expansion in studies dealing with topics concerning Allosaurus in life (paleobiological and paleoecological topics). Such studies have covered topics including skeletal variation, growth, skull construction, hunting methods, the brain, and the possibility of gregarious living <b>and</b> <b>parental</b> care. Reanalysis of old material (particularly of large 'allosaur' specimens), new discoveries in Portugal, and several very complete new specimens have also contributed to the growing knowledge base.|$|E

The former pair look for meaning in life and try out the freedom and excitement of the city. Tunny quickly gives up on life in the city, joins the military and is shipped off to war. Johnny turns to drugs and finds a part of himself that he grows to dislike, has a relationship and experiences lost love.|$|E

40|$|<b>Parental</b> <b>and</b> School Influences upon Career Development 2 Critical career {{development}} tasks for adolescents include developing vocational expectations and {{a connection to}} the world of work. Given the sociopolitical barriers to the {{career development}} of poor Youth of Color, it is vital to identify contextual resources facilitative of their career development. The present study examines the impact of relational <b>and</b> instrumental <b>parental</b> support <b>and</b> instrumental school support upon vocational expectations and work salience among poor Youth of Color. Participants from the National Educational Longitudinal Study (NELS) were examined longitudinally from 12 th grade to two years after they had finished high school.

Instrumental school support <b>and</b> relational <b>parental</b> support had direct effects upon vocational expectations and nonsignificant indirect effects two years later. These findings illuminate contextual factors facilitative of vocational expectations and work salience, provide support for school-based career development programs, and suggest that incorporating relationa...|$|R

Later on August 26, 2015, YouTube launched YouTube Gaming—a video gaming-oriented sub-site and app that is intended to compete with the Amazon.com-owned Twitch.tv. 2015 also saw the announcement of a premium YouTube service titled YouTube Red, which provides users with both ad-free content as well as the ability to download videos among other features.

5|$|In {{the absence}} of a {{standardized}} diagnosis system, many popular, informal classification systems or checklists, outside the DSM and ICD, were created out of clinical <b>and</b> <b>parental</b> experience within the field known as attachment therapy. These lists are unvalidated and critics state they are inaccurate, too broadly defined or applied by unqualified persons. Many are found on the websites of attachment therapists. Common elements of these lists such as lying, lack of remorse or conscience and cruelty do not form part of the diagnostic criteria under either DSM-IV-TR or ICD-10. Many children are being diagnosed with RAD because of behavioral problems that are outside the criteria. There is an emphasis within attachment therapy on aggressive behavior as a symptom of what they describe as attachment disorder whereas mainstream theorists view these behaviors as comorbid, externalizing behaviors requiring appropriate assessment and treatment rather than attachment disorders. However, knowledge of attachment relationships can contribute to the cause, maintenance and treatment of externalizing disorders.|$|E

5|$|There {{is also a}} {{considerable}} variety of treatments for alleged attachment disorders diagnosed on the controversial alternative basis outlined above, popularly known as attachment therapy. These therapies {{have little or no}} evidence base and vary from talking or play therapies to more extreme forms of physical and coercive techniques, of which the best known are holding therapy, rebirthing, rage-reduction and the Evergreen model. In general these therapies are aimed at adopted or fostered children with a view to creating attachment in these children to their new caregivers. Critics maintain these therapies are not based on an accepted version of attachment theory. The theoretical base is broadly a combination of regression and catharsis, accompanied by parenting methods which emphasise obedience <b>and</b> <b>parental</b> control. These therapies concentrate on changing the child rather than the caregiver. An estimated six children have died {{as a consequence of the}} more coercive forms of such treatments and the application of the accompanying parenting techniques.|$|E
