5|$|One of many {{exceptions}} to Seattle's {{reputation as a}} damp location occurs in El Niño years, when marine weather systems track as far south <b>as</b> <b>California</b> and little precipitation falls in the Puget Sound area. Since the region's water comes from mountain snow packs during the dry summer months, El Niño winters can not only produce substandard skiing but can result in water rationing and a shortage of hydroelectric power the following summer.|$|E

The trunkline continues east to the twin communities of Theodore and Felch. The river and the road part ways until meeting again at Foster City. This is also {{the location of a}} unique junction of highways. M-69 meets G-69, a County-Designated Highway that runs south to Loretto in southern Dickinson County. The intersection in unique because some states, such <b>as</b> <b>California,</b> do not allow two highways to share a common number.|$|E
5|$|Brown's {{second year}} as coach {{was the best}} in Stanford rugby history: the team was undefeated {{entering}} the Big Game at California, who was also undefeated. A record crowd of 26,000 turned out to see Stanford defeat the Bears, 26–8. This {{would be the last}} Big Game for several years <b>as</b> <b>California</b> returned to football for the 1915 season. Despite Stanford's success in rugby, the previous year's humiliating defeats to the All Blacks and the switch by rivals USC and California to football intensified the sentiment for Stanford to switch back as well.|$|E

5|$|During the {{petition}} drive, groups supporting Morse accused the firm collecting the signatures of hiring convicted felons and gathering personal information. Recall backers said that Morse's group was misleading the public. In addition, the recall drives brought in support from national groups {{on both sides}} of the issue. The National Rifle Association (NRA) supported the recall effort with mailers and donations. National groups opposing the recall included America Votes, believed to be financially supported by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, as well <b>as</b> <b>California</b> billionaire Eli Broad.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, the {{trunkline}} {{running through}} Boyne City was originally labeled M-57. In 1927, the entire highway was renumbered, and since this change, the trunkline has carried the M-75 moniker. The M-75 designation was left unaltered when US27 between Gaylord and Indian River was {{converted to a}} freeway; this freeway was redesignated as I-75 in 1962. Some states, such <b>as</b> <b>California,</b> do not allow two highways in their state to carry the same highway number, {{which is not the}} case in Michigan. A reconstruction project in 1966 bypassed some sharp curves in the roadway and straightened sections between Boyne City and Walloon Lake. As of 2008, the highway remains unaltered since the reconstruction.|$|E
5|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century, {{the range of}} the mockingbird {{expanded}} northward towards provinces such as Nova Scotia and Ontario and states such as Massachusetts, although the sightings were sporadic. Within the first five decades of the twentieth century, regions that received an influx of mockingbirds were Maine, Vermont, Ohio, Iowa, and New York. In western states such <b>as</b> <b>California,</b> the population was restricted to the lower Sonoran regions but by the 1970s the mockingbirds was residential in most counties. Islands that saw introductions of the mockingbird include Bermuda (in which it failed), Barbados, St. Helena, Socorro Island, the Cayman Islands and Tahiti.|$|E

5|$|Most common ravens prefer wooded {{areas with}} large expanses of open land nearby, or coastal regions for their nesting sites and feeding grounds. In {{some areas of}} dense human population, such <b>as</b> <b>California</b> in the United States, they take {{advantage}} of a plentiful food supply and have seen a surge in their numbers. On coasts, individuals of this species are often evenly distributed and prefer to build their nest sites along sea cliffs. Common ravens are often located in coastal regions because these areas provide easy access to water and a variety of food sources. Also, coastal regions have stable weather patterns without extreme cold or hot temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Pinnipeds mostly feed on {{fish and}} cephalopods, {{followed}} by crustaceans and bivalves, and then zooplankton and warm-blooded prey (like sea birds). Most species are generalist feeders, {{but a few}} are specialists. They typically hunt non-schooling fish, slow-moving or immobile invertebrates or endothermic prey when in groups. Solitary foraging species usually exploit coastal waters, bays and rivers. When large schools of fish or squid are available, pinnipeds hunt cooperatively in large groups, locating and herding their prey. Some species, such <b>as</b> <b>California</b> and South American sea lions, may forage with cetaceans and sea birds.|$|E
5|$|Politics in the Bay Area {{is widely}} {{regarded}} as one of the most liberal in California and in the United States. Since the late 1960s, the Bay Area cemented its role as the most liberal region in California politics, supporting the center left Democratic Party's candidates for U.S. President and continued to support Democratic candidates more than other regions of the state, even <b>as</b> <b>California</b> trended towards the Democratic Party over time. According to research by the Public Policy Institute of California, the Bay Area and the North Coast counties of Humboldt and Mendocino were the most consistently and strongly liberal areas in California.|$|E

50|$|In 1850, John C. Fremont {{chose the}} 120th {{meridian}} west <b>as</b> <b>California's</b> eastern boundary. However, because no survey had thus far been done, most assumed this line just tracked {{the crest of}} the Sierra Nevada Mountains.|$|R
5|$|SR 28 {{begins at}} U.S. Route 50 (US50) in Douglas County, Nevada. It heads north from there, forming {{part of the}} {{boundary}} of Lake Tahoe – Nevada State Park until crossing into Carson City. The highway then enters Washoe County, where the highway enters Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest. It then turns northwest, running through Incline Village. In western Incline Village, SR28 junctions with SR431, which is a direct link to Reno to the northeast. Just short of the California state line, it turns south to run parallel to the line and finally crosses into California at Crystal Bay. The road continues west of the California border <b>as</b> <b>California</b> State Route 28.|$|E
5|$|Two {{types of}} {{amphibians}} {{are found in}} the mounded prairie region, typically around vernal pools. The Pacific tree frog lives in large numbers on the rocks, while tadpoles of the rarer western toad can be seen between March and May. Mammals such <b>as</b> <b>California</b> voles, Heermann's kangaroo rats, raccoons, and long-tailed weasels can also be found in this region. The western meadowlark and two species of sparrows are the most common types of birds that are seen in the area. Turkey vultures, rock wren, three species of hawks, and other birds patrol the cliffs {{on the sides of the}} plateaus.|$|E
5|$|All {{pinnipeds}} are carnivorous and predatory. As a whole, {{they mostly}} feed on fish and cephalopods, followed by crustaceans and bivalves, and then zooplankton and endothermic ("warm-blooded") prey like sea birds. While most species are generalist and opportunistic feeders, {{a few are}} specialists. Examples include the crabeater seal, which primarily eats krill, the ringed seal, which eats mainly crustaceans, the Ross seal and southern elephant seal, which specialize on squid, and the bearded seal and walrus, which feed on clams and other bottom-dwelling invertebrates. Pinnipeds may hunt solitarily or cooperatively. The former behavior is typical when hunting non-schooling fish, slow-moving or immobile invertebrates or endothermic prey. Solitary foraging species usually exploit coastal waters, bays and rivers. An exception to this is the northern elephant seal, which feeds on fish at great depths in the open ocean. In addition, walruses feed solitarily but are often near other walruses in small or large groups that may surface and dive in unison. When large schools of fish or squid are available, pinnipeds such as certain otariids hunt cooperatively in large groups, locating and herding their prey. Some species, such <b>as</b> <b>California</b> and South American sea lions, may forage with cetaceans and sea birds.|$|E
