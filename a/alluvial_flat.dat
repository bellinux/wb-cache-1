Turning north from that village, the country undulates, exposing the rocky nucleus, and presenting the usual concomitant vegetation. Occasionally park-like views occurred, which, where diversified by the rocky valleys, resemble much the noble scenery of the Forest of Dean on the borders of Wales; the Mahowa especially representing the oak, with its spreading and often gnarled branches.

50|$|The {{municipality}} is in {{a valley}} bounded on the east by the Palusong Mountain Range moving south and on the west by the Hitaasan Mountain Range. The land is generally <b>alluvial</b> <b>flat</b> and swamplands which has an elevation of less than 10 meters above sea level, while going south, south easterly, the physiography abruptly rises to moderately rugged hills with a peak of 68 m. The drainage system in the area generally flows north-east towards Carangian Channel. Vegetation in this area generally consists of mangrove trees and shrubs, cogonal growth, and coconuts. The flat areas are planted with rice, corn and coconuts.|$|E

50|$|Geology of {{the area}} {{surrounding}} Mudgee and Gulgong forms part of the north eastern margin of the Lachlan Fold Belt tectonic zone. This northern area is traversed by the Cudegong River which rises {{in the mountains of}} the Great Divide, flowing west into the Murray-Darling river system. At the head of the valley, to the east, high mountains are of volcanic origin, and capped in basalt lava flows deposited some 17 million years ago. Nullo Mountain is the most extensive, and Mount Coricudgy the loftiest at 1256 m. The high mountainous eastern area is a spectacular landscape with basalt peaks, sandstone ravines and rainforest gorges. This high land falls to the west into wide basins of agricultural country. The Cudgegong River collects the fertile basalt enriched volcanics from the mountains and deposits them in the broad fertile <b>alluvial</b> <b>flat</b> agricultural lands to the west.|$|E
50|$|The Planter {{settlement}} on the St John River flourished. By December 1766, a government census revealed there were 261 {{people in the}} Maugerville community who were keen to fulfill the obligations of their grants as they possessed 78 oxen and bulls, 145 cows, 156 young cattle and 10 horses. Total crop production for the year, measured in bushels, amounted to wheat 599, rye 1866, beans 145, oats 57, peas 91 and barley 38. A gristmill and a sawmill had been built and the settlers owned two sloops. Due {{to a lack of}} adequate streams on Maugerville’s <b>alluvial</b> <b>flat,</b> it is conjectured that windmills located at “Windmill Point,” situated opposite Middle Island, powered these first mills. Given the success of the settlement, new settlers from New England continued to arrive. Charles Morris revisited the settlement in 1767, commenting that in spite of never ploughing the land, they were able to grow 20 bushels of corn and wheat per acre simply by harrowing their fields. By the mid 1770s, 80 families were living in Maugerville.|$|E
50|$|The {{plans for}} the {{settlement}} began in 1862, {{as a result of}} miners being forced upstream from rising water levels in the Clutha and Kawarau Rivers. Though the area was settled around this period, the population was not stationary. As miners followed gold up the creeks, the settlements tended to follow, and by 1868 the original settlement had been strung out along what is now the Bannockburn-Nevis road. As miners swept over the area, from 1862-1871 the face of the landscape underwent drastic changes as the <b>alluvial</b> <b>flat</b> was washed away by sluicing operations to the foreboding landscape that exists today. Water during this period was a pivotal resource, not just for mining but to supply the town as well. Evidence of the complex water system that once existed is spread throughout the landscape. Multiple dams, (technically reservoirs) feed a water system that extends from high on the nearby Carrick range down to the abandoned sluicing sites. Tippet's Dam was one of, if not the largest of these reservoirs. The water has since been redirected for horticultural and viticultural use and the sluicings rest dormant on land belonging to the Department of Conservation.|$|E

5000|$|During the British Raj, Patna {{was part}} of the Bengal Presidency. After Nalanda {{district}} was carved out of Patna district in 1976, Patna was purged of all hilly regions.

40|$|A {{lower jaw}} {{of the large}} Pleistocene cat Panthera atrox (Leidy) was found on an <b>alluvial</b> <b>flat</b> {{near the mouth of}} Lost Chicken Creek, about 180 miles {{northeast}} of Fairbanks, Alaska. It was probably washed out of carbonaceous silt deposits which, in the adjacent area, have also yielded bones of Equus, Bison, Rangifer, Cervus, and Elephantidae. The Panthera jaw falls within the size range of the series from Rancho La Brea, California, and differs from Rancho La Brea specimens only in a few characteristics. P. atrox appears to have been significantly larger than extinct or modern Asian tigers. Despite continuity of the American and Asian land masses at times during the late Pleistocene, present evidence indicates discontinuity between the populations of great cats on the two continents...|$|E

40|$|Humans {{played an}} {{important}} role in modifying the prehistoric environments of most Pacific Islands. In this paper we reconstruct the role of Polynesians in transforming the late Holocene landscape of the 'Opunohu Valley, Mo'orea, Society Islands (French Polynesia). Stratigraphic, sedimentary, chronometric, and paleobotanical evidence are used to reconstruct a sequence of geomorphological and vegetation changes during the past 1500 yr. Our results indicate substantial human inputs to landscape changes in the 'Opunohu Valley during the late Holocene. Vegetation burning in the upper 'Opunohu Valley, possibly for agricultural purposes, led to conversion of primary forests into early successional forests and degraded fernlands. Erosion of slopes in the upper valley led to massive deposition of sediments onto the valley floor, thus transforming the valley bottom swamp into a relatively dry <b>alluvial</b> <b>flat.</b> These results contribute substantially to an appreciation of the role played by the indigenous Polynesian people in modifying the Society Islands ecosystems and landscapes...|$|E
30|$|The Gisborne Dataset, G, is from {{measurements}} of two single, but complete, root systems of poplar (Populus deltoides Marshall x P. nigra L. clone ‘Veronese’) trees grown from poles: one tree aged 1  year and one tree aged 2  years. Trees {{were part of}} a field trial established in September 2009 near Gisborne on the east coast of the North Island (see Phillips et al. 2014 for details). The trial was established on a low-lying, even-surfaced <b>alluvial</b> <b>flat</b> terrace adjacent to the Taraheru River, at the site of previous ‘plant growth performance’ trials to allow comparisons between species (e.g. Marden et al., 2005). The soil is a free draining ‘Te Hapara’ Typic Sandy Brown Soil (Hewitt, 1998). The site (50  m by 50  m) was tilled before planting, weed mat laid to reduce competition from weeds, and trickle irrigation installed (to deal with summer dry periods). Poles (3  m un-rooted stem cuttings approximately 50 – 60  mm in diameter at the base) were pushed/rammed vertically into the soil to 0.7  m depth on a 5  m[*]×[*] 5  m grid. Root distribution was measured by the complete excavation of the root systems. The number and the dimension of roots were measured along regularly spaced concentric circles centred on the middle of the stem (0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5,…m). Root diameters were measured manually with a pair of callipers. The number of roots was calculated for root diameter classes of 1  mm interval (0 – 1.5, 1.6 – 2.5, 2.6 – 3.5,…). Fine roots are defined as having a diameter less than 1.5  mm.|$|E
40|$|Pittosporum obcordatum (Pittosporaceae) is a {{threatened}} lowland shrub, primarily found in alluvial sites with widely separated populations throughout the North and South Islands of New Zealand. Threats to P. obcordatum include small population size, habitat loss, competition with exotic plants and grazing from introduced mammals. The {{primary goal of}} this thesis was to was to better understand genetic and ecological factors that could assist with the conservation of P. obcordatum. I used Inter Sequence Repeat (ISSR) markers to study the genetic diversity of 128 individuals from 10 populations of P. obcordatum from Kaitaia to Fiordland. Populations of P. obcordatum had low to moderate genetic diversity, and smaller populations contained less genetic diversity than larger populations. A high degree of geographic genetic structure was found, suggesting little or no recent gene flow between populations. Small population sizes and geographic isolation of the populations likely {{have an effect on}} this. Based on this data, recommendations are made for site restoration planting designed to maximise population size and genetic diversity, accompanied by conservation strategies targeting threats from land use. Further, a newly discovered population of P. obcordatum on Banks Peninsula has been found growing on a hillside, and this thesis investigated why the species was growing in an unexpected habitat. When pot seedlings from Banks Peninsula and a Fiordland <b>alluvial</b> <b>flat</b> population were subjected to drought, mortality was lower for Banks Peninsula seedlings than for Fiordland but not significantly so. When radishes (Raphanus sativus) were used as a phytometer, Banks Peninsula soil produced significantly less biomass than soil from three alluvial flats. Taken together, these findings indicate that slope and soil fertility have less of an impact on the success of P. obdorcatum than would previously have been assumed based on its alluvial sites, indicating that further populations may yet be found on other hillsides or in less fertile areas. Search and further genetic study of such populations are therefore recommended in order to elaborate on the habitat and genetic profile advanced by this research, allowing for a well rounded approach to conservation planning...|$|E
