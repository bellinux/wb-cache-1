40|$|International audienceThis paper {{investigates the}} {{stability}} of nonlinear networked control systems (NCSs) with dynamic controllers that possess direct-feedthrough terms (i. e. that are of relative degree zero). The presence of the direct-feedthrough terms obstructs the application of existing stability results for NCSs. Indeed, the uniform global exponential stability (UGES) of an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>system</b> induced by the plant and the network protocol needs to be verified. In prior work, this <b>auxiliary</b> <b>system</b> depends solely on the protocol (and not on the plant or on the controller) and, consequently, the analysis is simpler. Checking UGES of this <b>auxiliary</b> <b>system</b> {{turns out to be}} non-trivial when direct-feedthrough terms are present (even for the simplest protocols). Still, we are able to show UGES of the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>system</b> for Round-Robin (RR) and Try-Once-Discard (TOD) network protocols, which, together with other requirements on the maximum allowable transmission intervals (MATIs), ensures {{the stability of}} the overall system.

25|$|Hydrogen's low {{viscosity}} and high thermal conductivity {{make it the}} most powerful working gas, primarily because the engine can run faster than with other gases. However, because of hydrogen absorption, and given the high diffusion rate associated with this low molecular weight gas, particularly at high temperatures, H2 leaks through the solid metal of the heater. Diffusion through carbon steel is too high to be practical, but may be acceptably low for metals such as aluminum, or even stainless steel. Certain ceramics also greatly reduce diffusion. Hermetic pressure vessel seals are necessary to maintain pressure inside the engine without replacement of lost gas. For high temperature differential (HTD) engines, <b>auxiliary</b> <b>systems</b> {{may need to be}} added to maintain high pressure working fluid. These systems can be a gas storage bottle or a gas generator. Hydrogen can be generated by electrolysis of water, the action of steam on red hot carbon-based fuel, by gasification of hydrocarbon fuel, or by the reaction of acid on metal. Hydrogen can also cause the embrittlement of metals. Hydrogen is a flammable gas, which is a safety concern if released from the engine.|$|E
