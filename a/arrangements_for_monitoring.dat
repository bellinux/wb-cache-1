40|$|The idea of Payments for {{environmental}} services (PES) has an appealing simplicity, {{which may explain}} {{the success of the}} concept. However, successful projects are far limited though and two constraints have been identified in literature. The first is limited demand: too few service users are so confident about the mechanism {{that they are willing to}} pay. The second obstacle is poor knowledge on the institutional requirements entailing incentive and livelihood mechanisms which so far have received comparatively less attention. This paper focuses on both constraints by arguing that monitoring effectiveness and conditionality of PES schemes are crucial and that institutional <b>arrangements</b> <b>for</b> <b>monitoring</b> should be in place. By analysing in a systematic way what types of measurement problems there are, the paper shows that the type of monitoring that is required within a PES has consequences for the institutional arrangement needed for a successful PES. We find that the institutional <b>arrangements</b> <b>for</b> <b>monitoring</b> vary according to (i) the type of environmental service and its underlying production process, (ii) the extent to which the environmental service can be freely observed or measured, (iii) the extent to which activities of the resource managers who provide the environmental service can be freely observed, and finally (iv) the deterministic or stochastic nature of production processes.

40|$|One of the {{purposes}} of Environmental Assessment (EA) is to minimize potentially adverse impacts and enhance the overall quality of the project. The effectiveness of an EA in meeting these objectives is determined during project implementation through performance monitoring by the borrower and Bank supervision.

Bank environmental supervision activities ensure diligence of Borrowers in implementing mitigation measures. A recent review of the Bank’s experience with EA concluded that <b>arrangements</b> <b>for</b> <b>monitoring</b> and supervision could be made more effective. The 1992 Wapenhans Task Force Report “Effective Implementation: Key to Development Impact ” emphasized the importance of managing the quality of projects under implementation.

Since {{the introduction of a}} specific legal duty to control this risk in 1992, many Trusts have developed manual handling risk management strategies. Anecdotally, however, practice varies between Trusts and there is no published description of common practice among NHS employers. The latter would be useful as a benchmark for risk managers. Therefore, we undertook a cross-sectional survey of 158 UK trusts (81 % of those invited) using a structured interviewer-administered questionnaire to collect information about manual handling risk controls. Most Trusts had basic systems for risk management, including defined management accountability, written policies, provision of handling equipment, training, expert advice about manual handling and access to occupational health services and physiotherapy for injured employees. However, there was wide variation in important aspects, including the extent of expert manpower and criteria for referral to occupational health. <b>Arrangements</b> <b>for</b> <b>monitoring</b> risk controls were generally poor, and the variation in practice was a cause for concern.

40|$|Payment for {{environmental}} services (PES) {{is seen as}} a mechanism that can achieve two goals, providing poor resource managers with an additional source of income and maintaining environmental services. Although some reservations have been made on the effectiveness of PES of reaching the poor, similar reservations can be made about achieving the second goal. Because many environmental services are intangible, developing simple and straightforward indicators to measure and monitor the environmental service provided and linking these to the efforts supplied by the resource managers is difficult and costly. But establishing this link is crucial to those who are paying and ultimately for the success of the PES concept. By reviewing the literature on this topic and analysing in a systematic way what types of measurement problems there are, we will show that the type of monitoring that is required within a PES has consequences for the institutional arrangement needed for a successful PES.

Environmental Development, 9, 43 - 60 The Nigerian economy depends on the petroleum industry for revenue and fuel to drive its growth. However, the petroleum industry {{has been associated with}} major issues of accidents and disasters which have contributed to vast safety and environmental problems. This is especially true for all sectors of the industry including the downstream. Against this back-drop, this paper critically examines the provisions in various environmental and petroleum laws and the institutional <b>arrangements</b> <b>for</b> <b>monitoring</b> and enforcement to evaluate their adequacy for ensuring safety and proper environmental management within the downstream sector. The review revealed the limitations of the framework such as incoherent laws, overlaps, duplications and conflicting regulatory functions. In addition, the paper looked beyond the regulatory framework to factors within wider socio-political and governance context that contribute to the lack of effectiveness of the regulatory framework. Poor governance, rent seeking culture and inadequate funding were also identified as the key contributing factors to implementation deficit.

40|$|Monitoring {{tropical}} deforestation and forest degradation {{is one of}} the central elements for the Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in developing countries (REDD+) scheme. Current <b>arrangements</b> <b>for</b> <b>monitoring</b> are based on remote sensing and field measurements. Since monitoring is the periodic process of assessing forest stands properties with respect to reference data, adopting the current REDD+ requirements for implementing monitoring at national levels is a challenging task. Recently, the advancement in Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) and mobile devices has enabled local communities to monitor their forest in a basic resource setting such as no or slow internet connection link, limited power supply, etc. Despite the potential, the use of mobile device system for community based monitoring (CBM) is still exceptional and faces implementation challenges. This paper presents an integrated data collection system based on mobile devices that streamlines the community-based forest monitoring data collection, transmission and visualization process. This paper also assesses the accuracy and reliability of CBM data and proposes a way to fit them into national REDD+ Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) scheme. The system performance is evaluated at Tra Bui commune, Quang Nam province, Central Vietnam, where forest carbon and change activities were tracked. The results show that the local community is able to provide data with accuracy comparable to expert measurements (index of agreement greater than 0. 88), but against lower costs. Furthermore, the results confirm that communities are more effective to monitor small scale forest degradation due to subsistence fuel wood collection and selective logging, than high resolution remote sensing SPOT imagery...|$|E

DESIGN [...] Descriptive study of coverage of screening programme and its variation by mobility, district of residence, and ethnic group. SUBJECTS [...] 1727 infants born between 1 October and 31 December 1991. SETTING [...] Former West Lambeth and Camberwell District Health Authorities, London. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE [...] Proportion of infants with an identifiable screening test result. RESULTS [...] Screening covered 1663 / 1727 (96. 3 %) infants overall (745 / 786 (94. 8 %) in West Lambeth; 918 / 941 (97. 6 %) in Camberwell). The relative odds ratio of an African infant not having been tested compared with a white infant was 3. 05 (95 % confidence interval 1. 30 to 7. 14) (2. 08 (0. 86 to 5. 01) after adjustment for mobility and district of residence). For infants whose families moved into the districts after the birth compared with those born and resident in the districts the relative odds ratio of having been tested was 10. 16 (4. 85 to 21. 29). The odds ratio of locally delivered infants in West Lambeth not having been tested compared with those in Camberwell was 2. 12 (1. 08 to 4. 16) after adjustment for ethnic group. CONCLUSION [...] Coverage of the screening programme is incomplete and poorer in infants of African ethnic group than in white infants. Poorer coverage is also associated with mobility of the family {{around the time of}} birth. The findings have implications for using the neonatal programme for testing for sickle cell disease and other disorders. <b>Arrangements</b> <b>for</b> <b>monitoring</b> the existing screening programme are inadequate and an improved system should be established, similar to the scheme that monitors the immunisation programme...|$|E
40|$|This audit {{assessed}} {{the effectiveness of}} the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre 2 ̆ 7 s (AUSTRAC) arrangements for processing financial intelligence, to assist domestic partner agencies and international counterparts in their operations and investigations. Overall conclusion: AUSTRAC plays an important part in the fight against organised crime and in protecting the integrity of Australia’s financial environment. Its financial intelligence is intended to contribute to the operations of its partner agencies in combating money laundering, the financing of terrorism and other forms of serious and organised crimes. These crimes can range from tax and welfare fraud, drug related crimes, to threats to national security, including people smuggling. AUSTRAC’s financial intelligence is highly valued by partner agencies for its contribution to their operations and management of risks. Through its systems, AUSTRAC provides partner agencies with near real-time access to financial transactions data, and is uniquely positioned to prepare financial intelligence based on its analysis of this data. While AUSTRAC’s financial intelligence is highly valued both domestically and internationally, its effectiveness in terms of countering money laundering and the financing of terrorism and other forms of serious and organised crime is not readily quantifiable. Data on the impact of AUSTRAC’s financial intelligence on the operations of law enforcement agencies is limited. However, the ATO and DHS–Centrelink have reported using AUSTRAC’s financial intelligence in more than 2700 cases in 2011 – 12, resulting in savings of more than 255  million. AUSTRAC has well established and sound arrangements for processing and disseminating its financial intelligence. AUSTRAC regularly seeks the advice of its partner agencies as to their priorities for financial intelligence, and is continually refining its approach to analysing and disseminating its intelligence to meet their requirements. The agency has mature arrangements to process assessments, and disseminate financial intelligence reports to domestic partner agencies and international counterparts. A sound quality assurance mechanism is also in place for all financial intelligence reports. However, there is room to strengthen the administration of the financial intelligence function. In particular, improvements could be made to: the <b>arrangements</b> <b>for</b> <b>monitoring</b> access to, and further dissemination of, AUSTRAC’s data by partner agency personnel; workload management; and performance reporting. In addition, attention needs to be given to the long–term contingency management of the agency’s IT infrastructure (data centre). In this regard, the Government announced as part of the 2013 – 14 Budget that it will invest 16. 1  million over four years to establish a new off‑site data centre. AUSTRAC has in place MOUs (Memorandum of Understanding)  with each of its partner agencies, and exchange agreements with international counterparts which clearly set out respective obligations for all parties in respect of the exchange of financial intelligence. Appropriately, the MOUs set out arrangements in respect to AUSTRAC and partner agencies’ obligations in safeguarding AUSTRAC’s financial intelligence. At present, assurance as to partner agency compliance in this regard is provided by way of a letter from the partner agency to AUSTRAC. These arrangements would be enhanced by AUSTRAC exercising its right to periodically review access to, and further dissemination of, AUSTRAC’s data by partner agency personnel. With over 59  million FTRs being provided annually, AUSTRAC is faced with the challenge of maintaining assessment throughput and prioritising key assessment types. A workload queue (backlog) developed for two key financial intelligence assessment types, and agreed processing times were not being met. Management reporting did not provide adequate visibility as to the extent, and reasons {{for the development of the}} workload queues or for performance against agreed processing times. AUSTRAC has advised that its Enhanced Analytics Capability Project is intended to improve administrative arrangements including internal reporting. AUSTRAC has arrangements to monitor and review feedback provided by partner agencies about the intelligence it disseminates. However, these arrangements are not yielding useful management information because of the low rates of feedback being returned by partner agencies. Reviewing its approach to gathering structured feedback from partner agencies would assist AUSTRAC to better report the use and value of its financial intelligence. In addition, AUSTRAC’s approach to measuring and reporting its performance provides only limited insight into whether it is meeting the objectives of the FIU and the impact of the program overall. Reviewing the performance indicators and setting appropriate targets would provide greater assurance and transparency to its public reporting. The ANAO has made three recommendations that are directed towards improving AUSTRAC’s arrangements for processing financial intelligence to assist domestic partner agencies and international counterparts in their operations and investigations. The recommendations relate to: strengthening administrative arrangements in relation to periodically reviewing access to, and dissemination of, AUSTRAC financial intelligence; improving management of the assessment of financial intelligence; and providing greater assurance and transparency to AUSTRAC’s public reporting of performance against program deliverables and key performance indicators...|$|E

Despite the great {{progress}} has been made in contemporary clinic medicine some forms of neuroblastoma disease are still found very difficult to treat. This work focuses on the effects of histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDAC) in the neuroblastoma cell lines. It is known that HDAC inhibitors may contribute to recurrence of the tumor cells by affecting the chromatin structure and thus increase the expression of critical tumor suppressor genes. These genes activate apoptotic pathways that may even be independent of caspases. We observed the efficiency of used HDAC inhibitors as under standard conditions an in hypoxia (1 % O 2). Inadequate amount of oxygen supply is one of the characteristic features of tumors and it also may contribute to chemoresistance. With the hypoxia-induced chemoresistance of tumor cells, the influence of HIF- 1 α is expected. Some HDAC inhibitors reduce the amount of HIF- 1 α in hypoxia and thus HIF transcription factor activity.

40|$|Since {{the advent}} of {{professional}} forestry in the 17 th century, forest monitoring has been {{part and parcel of}} forest management, and has been implemented in different forms in many European countries. The practice of forest monitoring was later exported to the European colonies, and has since been taken over and conducted by post-colonial governments in many developing countries. From an earlier focus on assessment of timber stocks, the practice has evolved to include assessments of other forest variables than timber. Despite this evolution, national forest monitoring has remained largely timber-oriented, and a closed system with little participation of actors outside the state forestry bureaucracy. However, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) decision on reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, and the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries (REDD+) has opened up new discussions on forest monitoring in developing countries. Specifically, the global discourse on monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) of REDD+ outcomes has introduced new ideas and demands on the scope and objectives of forest monitoring, the actors to be involved, and resources to be used. Taken together, the emergence of the REDD+ MRV discourse and associated ideas calls for change in the institutional <b>arrangements</b> <b>for</b> forest <b>monitoring</b> in developing countries. Furthermore, while these ideas and demands are determined and agreed upon in an international negotiation process, they need to be translated and implemented in highly diverse country-specific contexts, with country-specific actors, ideas, interests, and institutions. Translating the REDD+ MRV discourse and ideas into national institutional arrangements thus involves negotiation and contestation among national stakeholders. This dissertation examines the performance of REDD+ MRV in terms of its implementation and institutionalization in developing countries, and the political processes by which such institutionalization occurs. Specifically, it examines (1) the institutional effectiveness of REDD+ MRV; (2) how the concept of REDD+ MRV and associated ideas have materialized in new institutional <b>arrangements</b> <b>for</b> forest <b>monitoring</b> in developing countries; and (3) how discursive processes of policymaking and the argumentation and contestation inherent in such processes enable or constrain institutionalization. With this, the dissertation contributes to the literature on REDD+ MRV by examining forest monitoring from a social science perspective. While current research on REDD+ MRV remains highly technical, since it is assumed that forest monitoring is a neutral, apolitical activity, this study argues that monitoring deforestation is also political, and contributes by highlighting the political contestation involved in implementing REDD+ MRV at the national level. The dissertation also contributes to scientific debates on the performance of international environment agreements at the national level, and how contestation and negotiation among domestic stakeholders enable or constrain their institutionalization at the national level. Chapter 1 introduces the research presented in this dissertation. It provides an overview of the emergence of reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries (REDD+) within the United Nations Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) as a climate mitigation strategy, and argues that the UNFCCC’s decisions on monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) for REDD+ pose new ideas and demands <b>for</b> forest <b>monitoring</b> in developing countries. It elucidates the research that has been done on REDD+ MRV so far, identifies gaps in the existing literature on forest <b>monitoring</b> <b>for</b> REDD+, and delineates the objectives of the study. It discusses the theoretical basis and framework for the study, explaining how the main theoretical concept – discursive institutionalism – is combined with the Policy Arrangement Approach (PAA) to examine how REDD+ MRV has been shaped and institutionalized in new or reformed institutional <b>arrangements</b> <b>for</b> forest <b>monitoring</b> in developing countries, and discursive processes by which such institutionalization occurs. After presenting the conceptual framework, four research questions are outlined, namely: 1.          What is the institutional effectiveness of REDD+ MRV in terms of its implementation in developing countries? 2.          How have institutional <b>arrangements</b> <b>for</b> forest <b>monitoring</b> in Peru evolved, and how and to what extent has their evolution been shaped by international discourses on forests, especially REDD+ MRV? 3.          How and to what extent has the concept of MRV become institutionalized in new or reformed institutional <b>arrangements</b> <b>for</b> forest <b>monitoring</b> in Indonesia, Peru and Tanzania, and how can differences in this extent of institutionalization across the countries be explained? 4.          How  has  discursive  politics  enabled  or  constrained  institutionalization  of  MRV  in Indonesia, Peru and Tanzania? The chapter then describes the study’s overall research design and methodology, and ends by outlining the structure of the dissertation. Chapter 2 examines the institutional effectiveness of REDD+ MRV. The chapter draws on regime literature to conceptualize UNFCCC and its decisions on REDD+ MRV as an international institution or regime, and outlines the technical and good governance requirements for MRV. Drawing on Young and Levy’s (1999) framework for assessing effectiveness of international institutions, and building on UNFCCC and IPCC methodological guidelines for Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF), and good governance literature, it develops criteria and indicators for assessing progress in implementing the identified technical and governance requirements for MRV. Three dimensions on which effectiveness of REDD+ MRV can be evaluated are developed: ‘owning technical methods for MRV’, ‘developing administrative competence’ and ‘integrating good governance’ in MRV. The framework is applied to assess and compare institutional effectiveness of REDD+ MRV in 13 REDD+ countries, based on a review of national and international documents. The Chapter shows that REDD+ countries have high to very high ownership of technical methods. However, the majority of the countries rank only low to moderate on administrative capacity and good governance. This means that although countries have started developing technical methods for MRV, they are yet to develop the competence necessary to administer MRV and to incorporate aspects of good governance in MRV. The chapter explains the scores and suggest ways of improving implementation of REDD+ MRV. Chapter 3 examines how and to what extent global discourses and ideas on forests, especially the concept of REDD+ MRV, have shaped institutional <b>arrangements</b> <b>for</b> forest <b>monitoring</b> in developing countries, using the case of Peru. It draws on discursive institutionalism to conceptualize REDD+ MRV as a discourse and identify the ideas represented in the discourse. It then combines discursive institutionalism with the policy arrangement approach to craft a framework for examining the extent to which REDD+ MRV, and other global discourses, have shaped national institutional <b>arrangements</b> <b>for</b> forest <b>monitoring</b> in Peru. An analytical distinction is made between ‘shallow’ and ‘deep’ institutional change. The chapter identifies three distinct discourses – productivist forest philosophy, multiple-use and sustainable forest management philosophies and REDD+ MRV – that have shaped forest monitoring in Peru. The chapter shows that while all the three discourses have shaped the scope and objectives of forest monitoring, the actors involved, resources used, and rules governing forest assessments, none of them has led to ‘deep’ institutionalization of forest monitoring. On REDD+ MRV specifically, the chapter shows that it has expanded the scope and objectives of forest assessments in Peru, inspired the mobilization of new actors and resources, and spawned the development of new rules to govern forest monitoring. However, these institutional changes are not yet ‘deep’, since the new rules for forest inventories have not yet been formally adopted, and the agencies envisioned to implement forest monitoring have not been established. The chapter concludes that forest monitoring in general, and REDD+ MRV in particular, is only shallowly institutionalized in Peru. Chapter 4 compares how and to what extent the concept of REDD+ MRV has institutionalized in Indonesia, Peru and Tanzania. To do so, the chapter draws on insights from discursive institutionalism operationalized by means of the policy arrangement approach to develop the analytical categories of ‘shallow’, ‘shallow-intermediate’, ‘deep-intermediate’ and ‘deep’ institutionalization, and uses these categories to examine the extent of institutionalization across the countries. The chapter shows that in all three countries, REDD+ MRV has institutionalized in new or revised aims, scope and strategies <b>for</b> forest <b>monitoring,</b> and the development of new agencies and mobilization of new actors and resources. New legislation to anchor forest monitoring in law, and procedures to institutionalize the roles of the various agencies, are also being developed. Nevertheless, the extent of institutionalization of MRV varies across the countries, with Indonesia experiencing ‘deep’ institutionalization, Peru ‘shallow-intermediate’, and Tanzania ‘intermediate-deep’ institutionalization. To explain the differences in institutionalization, the chapter examines the theoretical factors for discourse institutionalization and their manifestation in each country. It shows that the relatively ‘deep’ institutionalization of REDD+ MRV in Indonesia and Tanzania is due to the presence of all five factors for discourse institutionalization. Only one factor is found to be present in Peru, and the ‘shallow- intermediate’ institutionalization of REDD+ is largely due to the absence of other factors. Based on the findings and conclusions, the chapter draws lessons to inform institutionalization of MRV in other countries. Chapter 5 examines how the discursive politics of MRV policymaking has enabled or constrained institutionalization of REDD+ MRV in Indonesia, Peru and Tanzania. To do this, it draws on the concept of discourse – understood as ideas and the interactive process of policymaking and public deliberation – to examine the actors involved in MRV policy development in the respective countries, and how the deliberation, argumentation and contestation among them (discursive politics) have enabled or constrained institutionalization. The chapter shows that in all countries, the methodologies to be used for MRV, the actors to be involved and their roles were contentious. However, it shows that in Indonesia and Tanzania, where there was a broad-based national discourse on MRV, and where policy actors agreed on the strategies to implement MRV and the role of different actors in forest monitoring, there is relatively ‘deep’ institutionalization compared to Peru, where such discourse and agreement were lacking. The chapter discusses how the discursive process facilitated institutionalization of REDD+ MRV in Indonesia and Tanzania and constrained the same in Peru. It concludes that how discursive politics is played matters in institutionalization. Chapter 6 presents the conclusions on the study. It draws on the empirical chapters to answer the research questions, concluding that majority (60 %) of the analysed countries has achieved at least a ‘moderate’ institutional effectiveness for MRV. Further, it concludes that the concept of REDD+ MRV has materialized in reformed institutional <b>arrangements</b> <b>for</b> forest <b>monitoring</b> in Indonesia, Peru and Tanzania, albeit to varying degrees. The chapter also concludes that forest <b>monitoring</b> <b>for</b> REDD+ is not only a technical activity, but is also political. Specifically, it concludes that decisions on what exactly is to be monitored and reported, by whom and using what methods are determined through political negotiations, and that how this political process is managed has a significant influence on how, and the extent to which, MRV is institutionalized. After drawing the conclusions, the chapter reflects on the key theoretical concepts used in the study by outlining how discursive institutionalism and the policy arrangement approach can be used to enrich one another. The chapter ends by outlining several policy recommendations. First, it recommends that while the development of new agencies to implement REDD+ MRV is necessary in some countries, care should be taken to avoid establishment of many agencies. Where possible, policy makers and donors should consider working with and strengthening existing agencies before deciding to establish new agencies. Second, it recommends that more investments be directed to organizing inclusive MRV policy coordination processes, since the politics involved in these processes {{determine the extent to which}} REDD+ MRV is institutionalized. Lastly, investments in policy coordination should be accompanied with investments in broader communicative political discourse to enlighten all REDD+ stakeholders on MRV policy processes and the strategies being proposed, while seeking the views and feedback these strategies. This is necessary if the proposed strategies are to be legitimate in the eyes of key REDD+ stakeholders...|$|R
40|$|Financial {{markets have}} been {{subjected}} to numerous regulations during the last two decades. MiFID 2 /MiFIR and MAD 2 /MAR are two extensive regulations that will apply on European level during 2016 - 2018. Both these regulations stress areas that are of relevance to trade surveillance. Trade surveillance systems are IT systems applied to the market for financial instruments to identify market abuse or other harmful patterns in participants’ trading activity. The purpose of this report is to map the market of trade surveillance technology in Stockholm, Sweden, and examine the impact on these actors in conjunction with the regulations. Since MiFID 2 /MiFIR and MAD 2 /MAR are extensive regulations, these were condensed to key points that were considered as relevant for surveillance.   This research is a qualitative study and data was gathered by interviews with market actors. A pre-study and a literature study were made. These were used as basis to construct an analytical framework for market dynamics, which was used as a descriptive concept to design interview questions, structure data and analyze results. The framework was named Market Dynamics Framework and considered the macro-environmental factors: Technology, Actors’ preferences, Market structure and Regulations.   The market was segmented in order to more accurately examine regulatory impact. Market actors were divided into four groups. The results were analyzed according to the framework and for each of the segmented market actor groups. Preference of surveillance solution was shown to be one distinct difference between every segment. A purchased surveillance system from a vendor was most common, and actors of smaller scale preferred to outsource.   The market is concluded to be prepared in terms of having systems and <b>arrangement</b> <b>for</b> <b>monitoring</b> trades in place. Expected impact is mostly related to new market structures and more detailed data of larger amounts. Increased capacity need for surveillance departments is expected in combination with a need for more advanced technologies; e. g. automatic screening of social media, efficient minimization of false positives, functionality coverage for a broader range of financial instruments.   This research introduces two concepts as descriptive frames, Market Dynamics Framework and a segmentation. These are proposed as methods when conducting a market analysis. A validation study for these methods is suggested as a possible topic for future studies...|$|R
40|$|This thesis project lasted during {{five weeks}} at SSAB in Luleå {{and dealt with}} two tasks. The first task was to {{research}} {{the best possible way}} to synchronize network equipment and monitoring platforms at SSAB. The second task was to examine the requirements and <b>arrangements</b> <b>for</b> the <b>monitoring</b> platform SCOM. There are three main protocols used to achieve time synchronization: NTP, SNTP and PTP. The most common techniques to synchronize the time is either through the Internet, GPS, radio communications, or manual time setting. After collecting data from two different time sources (local server with attached GPS receiver, and externally via the Internet), and comparing the results, the equipment was configured. The results showed that the most appropriate solution would be to synchronize the equipment to the local server using the NTP protocol. For future implementations new and more powerful hardware with support for redundancy is proposed. SCOM is a modular monitoring and management platform developed by Microsoft. SCOM uses the SNMP protocol for communication between SCOM and various networking equipment. A survey on SCOM consisting of discussions with staff at SSAB regarding requests and comments on the design was conducted. Based upon the information gathered a design idea was conceived. It was made up of logical network equipment diagrams and geographical maps of the plant areas. These maps and diagrams were then integrated into SCOM to create a system which was easy to navigate and understand. Validerat; 20121006 (anonymous...|$|R
40|$|Research PaperThe Dominican Republic {{shares the}} island of Hispaniola with Haiti. The country has a total area of 48, 442 km², a narrow insular shelf of 9, 484 km² and an EEZ of {{approximately}} 238, 000 km². Around 10, 000 fishers with a fleet of 3, 750 boats, operate from the 1, 575 km of coastline to exploit the fisheries resources of the country. Fisheries is mainly artisanal, {{with high levels of}} import accounting for more than 50 % of local fish consumption. With average annual production of 13, 000 MT, the fishery is believed to be exploiting the traditional resources at or beyond their maximum sustainable yields. Preliminary assessments made by team members of the Caribbean regional Mechanism confirmed that there are major deficiencies in the institutional and organization system for sustainable development and management of the fisheries and aquaculture resources. Significant improvements are needed in: the institutional <b>arrangements</b> and capacity <b>for</b> planning and policy formulation; the systems and capacity for research and collection of data; and the <b>arrangements</b> <b>for</b> extension services, <b>monitoring,</b> control and surveillance as well as compliance with international agreements. There is also a need for greater organization and involvement of fishers in fisheries planning and decision-making regarding the fisheries. On the positive side there is strong political will to improve the fisheries sector with the support of national and international partners. In this paper a review of past and current management measures as well as the role played by international cooperation agencies to responsible fisheries in the Dominican Republic is discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{framework}} of the Kyoto Protocol, an agreement for the world's rich countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, is deeply flawed. This paper explains why. The Protocol lacks essential country coverage, provides an inadequate basis for allocating emission rights, lacks provision <b>for</b> <b>monitoring</b> and enforcement, and implies politically unacceptable transfers among governments under a (necessary and desirable) <b>arrangement</b> <b>for</b> trading emission rights. In addition, it would by itself do little to limit climate change. An alternative approach to limiting greenhouse gas emissions is suggested, focussing on international agreement on common actions to reduce emissions.
