5|$|Kovalainen's car had {{apparently}} been fitted with mismatched tyres {{at the front of}} the car during the first stint, meaning that the tyres spun in the opposite direction to which they were designed, causing his understeer. At his first pit stop his team, not realising the cause of the problem, had <b>adjusted</b> <b>his</b> front wing to compensate for the understeer and replaced the tyres correctly. This caused further handling problems, and eventually led to his retirement.|$|E
5|$|Stroheim had met casually with Jean Hersholt {{to discuss}} the role of Marcus Schouler, but he was {{initially}} reluctant to cast him. However, after Hersholt <b>adjusted</b> <b>his</b> appearance and wardrobe to more closely resemble Schouler, Stroheim changed his mind on the spot. With the exception of Gowland, Stroheim shot extensive screen tests {{of all the other}} actors at Goldwyn with cinematographer Paul Ivano. A scene from the Goldwyn film Souls for Sale is thought to be behind-the-scenes footage of Stroheim directing Greed, but it actually depicts him directing Hersholt during one of these screen tests.|$|E
5|$|The two clubs {{were due}} to meet a month earlier, but the stadium {{disaster}} at Hillsborough, which killed 96 of Liverpool's supporters, meant the fixture was postponed out of respect. It was moved to late May, days after the FA Cup Final which Liverpool won. Arsenal manager George Graham prepared for the match by giving his squad a minibreak and created a calming atmosphere in their training sessions. He <b>adjusted</b> <b>his</b> usual formation to a defensive one to stop Liverpool's attacking threat; David O'Leary was employed as a sweeper in a back five.|$|E

5|$|As Wilson <b>adjusted</b> <b>his</b> {{lineup of}} {{potential}} Cabinet appointees, he and House considered Lane for {{the positions of}} Attorney General and Secretary of War. Finally, Wilson wrote to him on February 24, 1913, offering him the Interior position, and, although the two had never met, he accepted the post. According to The New York Times, Chairman Lane was selected since {{he was one of}} the few California Democrats who had fought the railroads and who was not beholden to Hearst. At the time, it was customary not to make an official announcement of Cabinet appointments until the new President formally submitted the names to the Senate on the afternoon of Inauguration Day, March 4; however, The New York Times obtained the list of Wilson's appointees a day early. The Senate met in special session on March 5, and approved all of President Wilson's Cabinet appointees.|$|E
5|$|Cunningham {{took off}} this night from RAF Middle Wallop in Hampshire to patrol north of London. When the {{direction}} of the raid was known he was ordered to proceed to the East Midlands. GCI vectored Cunningham and his temporary radar operator John Phillipson—a former ground radar operator—onto an enemy aircraft, but the crew were forced much further westward. Search lights attracted their attention and Phillipson was able to make a contact and guide him. Soon visual confirmation was made. A tell-tale sign of an aircraft was a blank patch of sky surrounded by a cluster of stars. Keeping in the enemy's blind spot, he flew below it and <b>adjusted</b> <b>his</b> speed to match the German pilot. After closing the range as much as he dared, he fired with all four cannons and the Junkers Ju 88 exploded upon hitting the ground near Wittering, Cambridgeshire at 00:35. Cunningham's victim, 3./KG 54 Ju 88 flown by Unteroffizier Kaspar Sondermeister, was not claimed as destroyed. However, after interrogation of the two German survivors who affirmed the circumstances, Cunningham was granted the victory.|$|E

25|$|His {{method was}} {{the reverse of}} the general {{approach}} of impressionism. He produced works slowly and carefully. They {{were the result of}} close and detailed study. With some of his paintings, he made one hundred or more preliminary sketches. He was never satisfied with his works, and often painted multiple versions, years apart. He also changed and <b>adjusted</b> <b>his</b> methods constantly in order to obtain more effective arrangement, grouping and coloristic power. Repin's style of portraiture was unique, but owed something to the influence of Eduard Manet and Diego Velázquez.|$|E
25|$|In May 2017, {{during a}} visit to China, Miloš Zeman was visibly tired and {{required}} assistance from his security staff to walk. His spokesman Jiří Ovčáček attributed this to his demanding program, including ten days of work without any time to rest. His tiredness was also visible at the subsequent NATO summit, when Zeman was absent for speeches by political leaders such as Donald Trump, Jens Stoltenberg, and Angela Merkel, during which he would have been required to stand. These events revived speculation about Zeman's health, with some commentators speculating that Zeman may withdraw from the election due to this. Zeman's doctors recommended that Zeman rest for one or two weeks, and that his program was too exhausting, and Zeman <b>adjusted</b> <b>his</b> program as a result.|$|E

25|$|In October 2014, Rippon competed at the 2014 CS Finlandia Trophy {{finishing}} {{first in}} the free program and second overall. At the end of October he finished 7th in the free skate and 10th overall at the 2014 Skate Canada International. In November he finished 5th at the 2014 Trophee Eric Bompard after placing third in the free skate. It was a season plagued with equipment issues. Rippon <b>adjusted</b> <b>his</b> blade brand and mount, took on a new trainer to work with his team and met with renewed consistency at U.S. Championships, landing effortless triple axels and once again including a quad lutz in his short and long programs. He {{went on to win}} the free-skate portion of the competition and finished second overall with the silver medal. He was assigned to both the Four Continents team and the Worlds team.|$|E
500|$|The {{head coach}} dealt with young players who {{differed}} from the white, East-Coast students {{with whom he had}} previously worked. At the beginning, he used the then-customary coaching methods of rough language and a strict routine. The Native American students were unaccustomed to such an approach, and several key players stopped attending practices. Warner <b>adjusted</b> <b>his</b> technique, saying that he [...] "found I could get better results. I don't think I ever swore at a player from that time. Maybe I did a little cussing, now and then, but never at players." ...|$|E
500|$|At first, Ohno's {{commitment}} at Lake Placid was low {{until his}} teammates nicknamed him [...] "Chunky", which motivated him to train harder. In January, {{he failed to}} make the 1997 U.S. Junior World Team. Ohno <b>adjusted</b> <b>his</b> training and made a comeback winning the 1997 U.S. Senior Championships overall title, taking a gold medal in the 1500m, a silver in the 300m, and came in fourth in the 500m races. At the age of 14, he became the youngest person to win the title. [...] Ohno then relocated to the Colorado Springs Olympic Training Center to begin training with the senior level skaters, despite being only 14years old.|$|E

500|$|Prior to the 2007 season, Meskó <b>adjusted</b> <b>his</b> kicking {{technique}} to a straight motion {{instead of a}} cross-over like National Football League punters. [...] He was a preseason Ray Guy Award watchlist nominee. [...] After Rivas graduated, [...] the 2007 Michigan Wolverines football team had a battle for the placekicking duties for the 2007 season between redshirt freshman Bryan Wright and two walk-ons. [...] When the team had two fourth quarter field goal attempts blocked during their season-opening 3432 loss to the two-time defending FCS champion Appalachian State Mountaineers, Meskó was an uninvolved third stringer but handled punting duties. Meskó finished the season fifth in the Big Ten in punting average, and was again Academic All-Conference.|$|E
500|$|Stephen Doig, a {{professor}} at Arizona State University, estimated that 1.1 millionpeople attended the inauguration ceremony using the same satellite image. Although the image was taken {{a little less than}} 45minutes before Obama's swearing-in ceremony, Doig <b>adjusted</b> <b>his</b> estimate to include people who were still arriving in the area before the event. In spite of his crowd estimate, Doig stated that [...] "if I had to bet, I would say the [...] Obama crowd is in fact bigger than those that showed up for [...] {{or any of the other}} things... I'm wholly prepared to think it was the largest crowd." [...] Approximately 1.2million people had attended the second inauguration of Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965.|$|E
500|$|John Arlott called him, [...] "a cricketer {{of effect}} {{rather than the}} graces". An {{animated}} presence at the batting crease, he constantly <b>adjusted</b> <b>his</b> equipment and clothing, and restlessly tapped his bat {{on the ground as}} the bowler ran in. Basing his game on a sound defence learned during many hours of childhood lessons, Chappell employed the drive and square cut to full effect. He had an idiosyncratic method of playing back and across to a ball of full length and driving wide of mid on, but his trademark shot was the hook, famously saying [...] "three bouncers an over should be worth 12 runs to me". A specialist slip fielder, he was the fourth player to take one hundred Test catches.|$|E

500|$|As captain, Hutton {{believed}} {{that the key to}} success was a strong pace attack, stemming from his experiences against Lindwall and Miller, which influenced his selection of several promising fast bowlers. His natural inclination and the background to his appointment made him a cautious captain, for example slowing down the game to allow the fast bowlers to rest, which set a precedent for other captains. Tactically, Norman Yardley found him [...] "sound rather than venturesome". Run saving was his main priority, but during matches, he quickly <b>adjusted</b> <b>his</b> approach to attack the weakness of particular batsmen. Jim Kilburn {{believed that}} Hutton pursued a serious approach to all matches, {{to the point where he}} missed some enjoyment of the game. Kilburn wrote that the [...] "outstanding characteristic of his captaincy was shrewdness. He made no romantic gestures; he lit no fires of inspiration. He invited admiration rather than affection and would have exchanged either or both for effective obedience." ...|$|E
500|$|In the 1979 NBA draft, Los Angeles {{selected}} [...] {{point guard}} Magic Johnson from Michigan State {{with the first}} overall pick. It took Johnson's teammates time to acclimate themselves to his passing ability, as his [...] "no-look" [...] passes often caught them unaware. Once they <b>adjusted,</b> <b>his</b> passing became {{a key part of}} Los Angeles' offense. The Lakers won 60 games in Johnson's rookie year, and defeated the Philadelphia 76ers in six games in the 1980 NBA Finals. Johnson won the Finals MVP award, after starting at center for the injured Abdul-Jabbar in game six, and tallying 42 points, 15 rebounds, and seven assists. The team fell off in the 1980–81 season, though, as the Lakers lost Johnson for most of the season to a knee injury. The team turned in a 54–28 record and finished second behind the Phoenix Suns in the Pacific Division. The Rockets, led by Moses Malone, defeated Los Angeles {{in the first round of}} the playoffs.|$|E
500|$|The {{early months}} of 1706 also proved {{frustrating}} for the Duke as Louis XIV's generals gained early successes in Italy and Alsace. These setbacks thwarted Marlborough's original plans for the coming campaign, but he soon <b>adjusted</b> <b>his</b> schemes and marched into enemy territory. LouisXIV, equally determined to fight and avenge Blenheim, goaded his commander, Marshal Villeroi, to seek out Monsieur Marlbrouck. The subsequent Battle of Ramillies, fought in the Spanish Netherlands on 23 May, was perhaps Marlborough's most successful action, and {{one in which he}} had himself characteristically drawn his sword at the pivotal moment. For the loss of fewer than 3,000 dead and wounded (far fewer than Blenheim), his victory had cost the enemy some 20,000 casualties, inflicting in the words of Marshal Villars, [...] "the most shameful, humiliating and disastrous of routs". The campaign was an unsurpassed operational triumph for the English general. Town after town subsequently fell to the Allies. [...] "It really looks more like a dream than truth", wrote Marlborough to Sarah. With Prince Eugene's rout of the French army at Turin in September, 1706 proved a miraculous year for Allied arms.|$|E
