50|$|This gene is {{a member}} of the ras superfamily, and is {{expressed}} in normal ovarian <b>and</b> <b>breast</b> epithelial cells, but not in ovarian <b>and</b> <b>breast</b> <b>cancers.</b> It is an imprinted gene, with monoallelic expression of the paternal allele, which is associated with growth suppression. Thus, this gene appears to be a putative tumor suppressor gene whose function is abrogated in ovarian <b>and</b> <b>breast</b> <b>cancers.</b>|$|R

5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the Russos' studies found similar risk rates between virgin and {{pregnancy}} interrupted rats, their research would be used to support the contention that abortion created a greater risk of breast cancer for the next twenty years.

40|$|Background: Although {{multifocal}} <b>and</b> multicentric <b>breast</b> <b>cancers</b> are {{a common}} entity, their clinical behavior is not well characterized. With {{the widespread use of}} mammographic screening and improved sensitivity of imaging modalities, the detection of multifocal <b>and</b> multicentric <b>breast</b> <b>cancers</b> is likely to continuously increase. Many studies have consistently shown a correlation between multifocality and multicentricity and the rate and extent of lymph node metastases. There is little clinical data on the impact of multifocal <b>and</b> multicentric <b>breast</b> <b>cancers</b> on survival outcomes. This study investigates the difference between multifocal <b>and</b> multicentric <b>breast</b> <b>cancers</b> <b>and</b> unifocal <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> regarding pathologic <b>and</b> clinical parameters. We have evaluated the impact of multifocal <b>and</b> multicentric <b>breast</b> <b>cancers</b> on disease-free <b>and</b> overall survival of <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> patients. Methods: In this retrospective study, we reviewed the records of female patients newly diagnosed with <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> who presented to the department of Cancer Management and Research, Medical Research Institute, Alexandria University in the time period from January 2009 till December 2009. Patients with pathologically proven stages I-III invasive <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> were included in this study. Patients’ clinical and pathological characteristics were compared between the two studied groups. The disease free and overall survivals were analyzed using the Kaplan–Meier method. Results: Multifocal <b>and</b> multicentric <b>breast</b> <b>cancers</b> were associated with a number of known adverse prognostic factors such as higher clinical stage, larger tumor size and lymphovascular invasion. There was a significant correlation between multifocal <b>and</b> multicentric <b>breast</b> <b>cancers</b> <b>and</b> increased rate of axillary lymph node metastasis and higher N stage. Multifocal <b>and</b> multicentric <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> patients had shorter median 5 -year disease free survival and overall survival compared to unifocal <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> patients. In multivariate analysis, after adjustment of other factors, only clinical stage and multifocality/multicentricity were independent predictors of poor disease free and overall survival. Conclusion: There is an association between multifocal <b>and</b> multicentric <b>breast</b> <b>cancers</b> <b>and</b> known adverse prognostic factors such as increased incidence of regional lymph node metastases. This association may suggest that multifocal <b>and</b> multicentric <b>breast</b> <b>cancers</b> have an aggressive biology and more propensity for metastasis. Whether multifocal <b>and</b> multicentric <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> is an adverse prognostic factor in <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> remains controversial...|$|R
40|$|Using {{differential}} display PCR, {{we have identified}} a gene [NOEY 2, ARHI (designation by the Human Gene Nomenclature Committee) ] with high homology to ras and rap that is expressed consistently in normal ovarian <b>and</b> <b>breast</b> epithelial cells but not in ovarian <b>and</b> <b>breast</b> <b>cancers.</b> Reexpression of NOEY 2 through transfection suppresses clonogenic growth of <b>breast</b> <b>and</b> ovarian <b>cancer</b> cells. Growth suppression was associated with down-regulation of the cyclin D 1 promoter activity and induction of p 21 WAF 1 /CIP 1. In an effort to identify mechanisms leading to NOEY 2 silencing in cancer, {{we found that the}} gene is expressed monoallelically and is imprinted maternally. Loss of heterozygosity of the gene was detected in 41 % of ovarian <b>and</b> <b>breast</b> <b>cancers.</b> In most of cancer samples with loss of heterozygosity, the nonimprinted functional allele was deleted. Thus, NOEY 2 appears to be a putative imprinted tumor suppressor gene whose function is abrogated in ovarian <b>and</b> <b>breast</b> <b>cancers...</b>|$|R

An article in The Weekend Australian highlighted an example of this in 2003: a woman in London admitted to belonging to online support forums dedicated to helping members cope with migraines, grieving over dead children, <b>and</b> <b>breast</b> <b>cancer,</b> all at the same time. She told a psychiatrist that she would study a specific malady and subsequently present herself with its symptoms; her time at each forum followed a daily schedule.

5|$|Some anti-abortion {{activists have}} {{continued}} to advance a discredited causal link between abortion <b>and</b> <b>breast</b> <b>cancer.</b> In the United States, they have advanced state legislation that in several states requires health care providers to present abortion {{as a cause of}} breast cancer when counseling women who are seeking abortion. This political intervention culminated when the George W. Bush administration altered the National Cancer Institute website to suggest that abortion might cause breast cancer. In response to public concern over this intervention, the NCI convened a 2003 workshop bringing together over 100 experts on the issue. This workshop concluded that while some studies reported a statistical correlation between breast cancer and abortion, the strongest scientific evidence from large prospective cohort studies demonstrates that abortion is not associated with an increase in breast cancer risk, and that the positive findings were likely due to response bias.|$|E
