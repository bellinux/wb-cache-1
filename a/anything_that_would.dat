5|$|Meechum remains Underwood's {{bodyguard}} once {{he becomes}} the president, and there {{does not appear to}} be any continuing sexual relationship. Meechum remains fiercely loyal, however; he warns Underwood's biographer Tom Yates (Paul Sparks) not to write <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> damage Underwood's reputation. In season 4, Underwood traces Meechum's hand with a marker on one of the walls of the White House when he wants to replace a Confederate painting; Meechum suggests he put up something he likes instead.|$|E

5|$|As Hogue {{approached}} her sinking sister, her captain, Wilmot Nicholson, {{realized that it}} had been a submarine attack and signaled Cressy to look for a periscope although his ship continued to close on Aboukir as her crew threw overboard <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> float to aid the survivors in the water. Having stopped and lowered all her boats, Hogue was struck by two torpedoes around 06:55. The sudden weight loss of the two torpedoes caused U-9 to broach the surface and Hogues gunners opened fire without effect before the submarine could submerge again. The cruiser capsized about ten minutes after being torpedoed and sank at 07:15.|$|E

5|$|His {{appointment}} in September 1990 as Personal Representative of the UN Secretary-General for Humanitarian Assistance Relating to the Crisis between Iraq and Kuwait required diplomatic finesse.

5|$|U-9, {{commanded}} by Kapitänleutnant Otto Weddigen, {{had been ordered}} to attack British transports at Ostend, but {{had been forced to}} dive and take shelter from the storm. On surfacing, she spotted the British ships and moved to attack. She fired one torpedo at 06:20 at Aboukir that struck her on the starboard side; the ship's captain thought he had struck a mine and ordered the other two ships to close to transfer his wounded men. Aboukir quickly began listing and capsized around 06:55.

25|$|An astrologer {{claimed that}} he was able to {{ascertain}} a person's astrological sign after talking with them for a few minutes.

After the astrologer talked to them, he had them go and sit in front of the astrological sign that the astrologer thought was theirs.

25|$|Nero Wolfe is {{a fictional}} character, a brilliant, oversize, {{eccentric}} armchair detective created in 1934 by American mystery writer Rex Stout.

He lives in a luxurious brownstone on West 35th Street in New York City, and he is loath to leave his home for business or <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> keep him from reading his books, tending his orchids, or eating the gourmet meals prepared by his chef, Fritz Brenner. Archie Goodwin, Wolfe's sharp-witted, dapper young confidential assistant with an eye for attractive women, narrates the cases and does the legwork for the detective genius.|$|E
25|$|His {{relations}} with superiors continued to sour {{as he began}} to criticize both the War and Navy Departments for being insufficiently farsighted regarding air-power. He advocated the development of a number of aircraft innovations, including bomb-sights, sled-runner landing gear for winter operations, engine superchargers, and aerial torpedoes. He ordered the use of aircraft in fighting forest fires and border patrols. He also encouraged the staging of a transcontinental air race, a flight {{around the perimeter of the}} United States. He also encouraged Army pilots to break aviation records for speed, endurance and altitude. In short, he encouraged <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> further develop the use of aircraft, and that would keep aviation in the news.|$|E

25|$|By 11 September 1915, Townshend had {{concentrated}} {{his forces}} at Ali Gharbi along the Tigris river. At his disposal {{he had the}} Poona Division, as well the 6th Indian Cavalry Brigade, 10th Royal Field Artillery Brigade, {{as well as two}} battalions from the 12th Division's 30th Indian Brigade. In all, Townshend's force was comprised 11,000 men and 28 artillery pieces. Townshend's force advanced along the Tigris from Ali Gharbi. Without any rail or motorized transport, they were reliant either on animal transport or river transport. Accompanying his force, Townshend was supported by a mixed riverine force manned by the Royal Navy and Royal Indian Marine. However, the transport available to him was only adequate. Despite lobbying for an advance, Nixon had refused <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> ease Force D's logistical situation. Not only had Nixon not accepted additional logistical support, he had failed to ask for the return of animals that his predecessor had sent back to India, which were required to haul Townshend's supplies.|$|E
25|$|McNeil's actions {{came too}} late. Ogdensburg rammed Atlantic {{on the port}} side, forward of the paddlewheel, cutting into Atlantic side down to the waterline. Ogdensburg {{reversed}} and backed away from Atlantic, while Atlantic continued away under full steam. Perhaps reassured by Atlantic steaming away, McNeil steered Ogdensburg back onto its regular course. Many passengers on Atlantic were awakened by the collision, but the crew of Atlantic {{made no effort to}} alert all the passengers. Water flowing in through the hole in Atlantic soon flooded the boilers, bringing the ship to a halt. The passengers and crew began to panic, many throwing <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> float {{over the side of the}} ship before jumping over the side themselves, where many drowned. An attempt was made to launch Atlantic three boats; one capsized, and Captain Petty suffered a concussion while lowering another, leaving him unable to provide any more assistance. The two other boats were lowered, carrying mostly crew members. The bow of Atlantic began to sink, but the stern was kept above water by air trapped inside the ship.|$|E
25|$|I {{put before}} the whole House my own views with an appalling frankness. From 1933, I {{and my friends}} were all very worried about what was {{happening}} in Europe. You will remember at that time the Disarmament Conference was sitting in Geneva. You will remember at that time there was probably a stronger pacifist feeling running through the country {{than at any time since}} the War. I am speaking of 1933 and 1934. You will remember the election at Fulham in the autumn of 1933...That was the feeling of the country in 1933. My position as a leader of a great party was not altogether a comfortable one. I asked myself what chance was there...within the next year or two of that feeling being so changed that the country would give a mandate for rearmament? Supposing I had gone to the country and said that Germany was rearming and we must rearm, does anybody think that this pacific democracy would have rallied to that cry at that moment! I cannot think of <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> have made the loss of the election from my point of view more certain...We got from the country – with a large majority – a mandate for doing a thing that no one, twelve months before, would have believed possible.|$|E

25|$|On May 20, 2004, Chen {{was sworn}} in for his second term as President amid {{continued}} mass protests by the pan-blue alliance over the validity of his re-election. Having heard protests from pro-independence figures in Taiwan, he did not explicitly re-state the Four Noes and One Without but did state that he reaffirmed the commitments made in his first inaugural. He defended his proposals to change the constitution, but asked for constitutional reform to be undertaken through existing procedures instead of calling for a referendum for an entirely new constitution which was proposed by former president Lee Teng-hui. This would require approval by a three-fourths majority of the National Assembly which could authorize a referendum. This has two major implications. First, by going through existing constitutional amendment procedures, this has the symbolic effect of maintaining continuity with the existing constitution which was originally written in China. Second, this has the practical effect of requiring the Chen administration to get {{the consent of the}} opposition Pan-Blue coalition to pass any amendments, and while the opposition is willing to consider constitutional reforms that would increase governmental efficiency, they are unlikely to support <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> imply a de jure declaration of independence.|$|E
