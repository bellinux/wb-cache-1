The report {{confirmed}} the immediate cause of the accident was a breach in {{the leading edge of}} the left wing, caused by insulating foam shed during launch. The report also delved deeply into the underlying organizational and cultural issues that led to the accident. The report was highly critical of NASA's decision-making and risk-assessment processes. It concluded the organizational structure and processes were sufficiently flawed and that a compromise of safety was expected no matter who was in the key decision-making positions. An example was the position of Shuttle Program Manager, where one individual was responsible for achieving safe, timely launches and <b>acceptable</b> <b>costs,</b> which are often conflicting goals. The CAIB report found that NASA had accepted deviations from design criteria as normal when they happened on several flights and did not lead to mission-compromising consequences. One of those was the conflict between a design specification stating that the thermal protection system was not designed to withstand significant impacts and the common occurrence of impact damage to it during flight. The board made recommendations for significant changes in processes and organizational culture.|$|E

The non-random cost and medical parameters connected with patient status were defined before HCT and HCT outcomes. The application of reduced toxicity (RTCR) or myeloablative conditioning regimens (MCR), the presence of relapse before HCT, and the cost of drugs and blood transfusion all have an influence on the outcome, and the weight coefficients of these parameters were calculated. This allows the connection of costs and clinical parameters, and the calculation of the minimal <b>acceptable</b> <b>cost</b> of HCT...|$|R

Traditional centralized approaches achieve this by constructing the KNN graph offline and exploiting elastic cloud platforms to massively parallelize the recommendation jobs on numerous nodes [36, 37].

Our methodology consists of comparing performance in terms of distance traveled of two competing transit services, a traditional fixed-route and a demand responsive service, while ensuring a comparable service to the same set of customers. We consider several scenarios, which depend on the road network, service quality level, and demand density. According to our findings, demand responsive transit services perform better for highquality service levels and low demand density scenario...|$|E

40|$|Knowledge of the {{worst-case}} execution time of software components {{is essential in}} safety-critical hard real-time systems. The analysis thereof is not trivial as the execution time depends on many factors, including the underlying hardware platform, the program structure, and the code produced by the compiler. Often, the execution time is variable and highly sensitive to the input data the program has to process. This paper presents a code transformation applicable in a compiler backend that produces time-predictable code. The resulting code contains a single input-data independent execution path, {{in order to obtain}} programs of stable timing behaviour. The transformation technique has been validated by applying it on a number of benchmarks. Experiments show a reduction of execution time variability, at <b>acceptable</b> <b>costs</b> for the single execution path...|$|E
