5|$|Prior to the 2000 season, Six Flags New England {{was known}} as Riverside Park. Six Flags {{purchased}} the park and added their own DC Comics theming. The site that Superman the Ride operates on is the former site of the Riverside Park Speedway. The Speedway was demolished after the 1999 season {{to make room for}} a new themed area, DC Superhero Adventure. As part of the $40 million expansion, the park built Superman: Ride of Steel. Six Flags worked with Swiss manufacturer, Intamin, to build and design the ride a year earlier. The final track piece of Superman was installed on March 27, 2000, about 40 days before opening day. The ride officially opened on May 5, 2000 as the tallest and longest roller coaster on the East Coast of the United States. The entrance and station were themed to Superman with Superman logos <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> of him located above the entrance. The second tunnel also had a mist effect.|$|E

5|$|As soon as late 1961, United Artists {{started a}} {{marketing}} campaign to make James Bond a well-known name in North America. Newspapers received a box set of Bond's books, {{as well as}} a booklet detailing the Bond character <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> of Ursula Andress. Eon and United Artists made licensing deals revolving around the character's tastes, having merchandising tie-ins with drink, tobacco, men's clothing and car companies. The campaign also focused on Ian Fleming's name due to the minor success of the books. After Dr. No had a successful run in Europe, Sean Connery and Terence Young did a cross-country tour in March 1963, which featured screening previews for the film and press conferences. It culminated in a well-publicised premiere in Kingston, where most of the film is set. Some of the campaign emphasised the sex appeal of the film, with the poster artwork, by Mitchell Hooks, depicting Sean Connery and four scantily clad women. The campaign also included the 007 logo designed by Joseph Caroff with a pistol as part of the seven.|$|E
