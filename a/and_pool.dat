5|$|As the IIHF grew, more teams {{began to}} {{participate}} at the World Championships, so more pools were introduced. Pool C games were first played in 1961 <b>and</b> <b>Pool</b> D {{was introduced in}} 1987. In 2001, the pools were renamed: Pool B became Division I, Pool C became Division II <b>and</b> <b>Pool</b> D became Division III.|$|E
5|$|Gameplay is {{identical}} to the previous instalment: races are viewed from a top-down perspective, and players race in environments such as bathrooms <b>and</b> <b>pool</b> tables (many tracks contain obstacles such as common household objects) in vehicles including powerboats and helicopters. The game adds sixteen vehicles.|$|E

40|$|Relationships between {{variations}} in river topography, such as riffles <b>and</b> <b>pools,</b> <b>and</b> fish, benthos, etc., {{have long been}} studied. The topographical classification of riffles <b>and</b> <b>pools,</b> however, is still conducted qualitatively. To take measures for the restoration or improvement of habitats, {{it is necessary to}} quantify these relationships and explain them in hydraulic terms. Meanwhile, studies on river -bed morphology have been conducted from the sediment hydraulics viewpoint, allowing for expression with physical indices. This paper examines the quantitative classification of riffles <b>and</b> <b>pools</b> of mountain streams, based on the findings of sediment hydraulics, to clarify their characteristics...|$|R
5|$|Columbia {{has many}} bars and {{restaurants}} that provide diverse styles of cuisine, which is {{in part due to}} it being a college town with three colleges. One such establishment is the historic Booches bar, restaurant <b>and</b> <b>pool</b> hall, which was established in 1884 and is frequented by college students, as well as others from all walks of life.|$|E
5|$|In 1987, Sindy's {{product manager}} Edward Machin {{announced}} that Sindy would reclaim the lead over Barbie within two years. Hasbro redesigned Sindy and spent approximately £1.5m on advertising. A Sindy magazine was also launched {{in this period}} to challenge the fortnightly Barbie magazine. A £1 million advertising campaign was introduced in 1991 with five advertisements highlighting Sindy's collection of beach <b>and</b> <b>pool</b> wear. The advertisement showed footage of Sindy combined with live action sequences from a look-alike.|$|E
5|$|Micro Machines is a {{top-down}} racing game: players observe races from above. Players race in environments such as breakfast <b>and</b> <b>pool</b> tables, work desks, and treehouses, driving {{toy vehicles}} such as powerboats, helicopters, formula one cars, and tanks that can shoot other racers. Courses have a predefined path that racers must follow: {{if a player}} leaves the defined route for too long they are {{sent back to the}} track. Many have obstacles such as cereal boxes on breakfast tables, and pencil sharpeners on desks.|$|E

5|$|The young {{municipality}} got {{its first}} boost in 1889 when Frank Ross and James McLaren opened {{what would become}} Fraser Mills, a $350,000, then state-of-the-art lumber mill on the north bank of the Fraser River. The District of Coquitlam was incorporated in 1891. By 1908, a mill town of 20 houses, a store, post office, hospital, office block, barber shop, <b>and</b> <b>pool</b> hall had grown around the mill. A mill manager's residence was built that would later become Place des Arts.|$|E
5|$|There {{were also}} a few road {{modifications}} on the Sheet Harbour {{side of the bridge}} {{as a result of the}} new bridge. Trunk 7 was aligned with what was Riverside Drive, which is now nonexistent. Church Point Road <b>and</b> <b>Pool</b> Road were slightly modified. The access road to Sheet Harbour Consolidated School and Duncan MacMillan High School was slightly modified. Sprott Lane, a minor loop, was extended along a part of the old Trunk 7 for a few households.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} innovation of the 4th {{century was}} the corps of protectores, which contained cadet senior officers. Although protectores {{were supposed to be}} soldiers who had risen through the ranks by meritorious service, it became a widespread practice to admit to the corps young men from outside the army (often the sons of senior officers). The protectores formed a corps that was both an officer training-school <b>and</b> <b>pool</b> of staff officers available to carry out special tasks for the magistri militum or the emperor. Those attached to the emperor were known as protectores domestici and organised in four scholae under a comes domesticorum. After a few years' service in the corps, a protector would normally be granted a commission by the emperor and placed in command of a military regiment.|$|E
50|$|Prior to the 1934 consolidation, {{there were}} {{separate}} lifeguard forces {{for most of}} the individual park districts in Chicago.

5|$|Bridgwater had {{a series}} of {{swimming}} pools from 1890 until 2009. The first pool, in Old Taunton Road, was replaced by the Bridgwater Lido on Broadway, opened in 1960 by Princess Alexandra. The lido, which had three pools, a diving bay and paddling pool, was demolished in the late 1980s {{to make way for a}} supermarket, and to fund the indoor Sedgemoor Splash swimming pool in Mount Street, which opened in 1991. In 2009, after the local council were unable to raise the funds needed to upgrade the pool, it was closed and demolished to make way for another supermarket. A new pool was planned as part of the Building Schools for the Future (BSF) rebuild of Chilton Trinity School, however, the government's review of the BSF programme may result in the cancellation of the new school <b>and</b> <b>pool</b> build.|$|E
5|$|During the 1930s, The Beverly Hills Hotel became {{increasingly}} popular with Hollywood film stars. Fred Astaire took a shine to the hotel, and enjoyed reading the Daily Variety and The Hollywood Reporter by the pool. Cesar Romero and Carole Lombard were pictured {{together at the}} hotel in 1937. In 1938, the Sand <b>and</b> <b>Pool</b> Club was established at the hotel. It proved extremely popular, with white sand imported from Arizona, which made the pool area look like a beach. The following year, it began hosting fashion shows sponsored by local department stores such as Bullock's Wilshire. In 1940, one of the hotel's long-time patrons, Marlene Dietrich, was instrumental in bringing about a change in policy in the Polo Lounge, which had made it compulsory for women to don skirts which she refused to wear.|$|E

5|$|In 1931, the Government of Canada {{enacted the}} Unemployment and Farm Relief Act which {{provided}} {{public works projects}} in the national parks during the Great Depression. In Banff, workers constructed a new bathhouse <b>and</b> <b>pool</b> at Upper Hot Springs, to supplement Cave and Basin. Other projects involved road building in the park, tasks around the Banff townsite and construction of a highway connecting Banff and Jasper. In 1934, the Public Works Construction Act was passed, providing continued funding for the public works projects. New projects included {{construction of a new}} registration facility at Banff's east gate and construction of an administrative building in Banff. By 1940, the Icefields Parkway reached the Columbia Icefield area of Banff and connected Banff and Jasper. Most of the infrastructure present in the national park dates from public work projects enacted during the Great Depression.|$|E
5|$|On June 29, 1946, {{the owner}} of the All-America Football Conference's (AAFC) Miami Seahawks Harvey Hester {{announced}} Crisp had been hired as the last member of the inaugural Seahawks staff. Hired as the line coach, Crisp served under head coach Jack Meagher and alongside assistants Hamp Pool and Ralph Jordan for the 1946 season. After the squad opened the season with only one win and six losses (1–6) Meagher resigned as head coach of the Seahawks on October 22. At the time of his resignation, Harvey Hester announced both Crisp <b>and</b> <b>Pool</b> were to serve as co-head coaches {{for the remainder of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|The video {{opens with}} the news of a fight {{circulating}} at a diner. This scene repeats itself at a pool hall, where gang members arrive via foot, forklift, and out of sewers, while the video's titular song begins to play. The camera cuts to a scene of Jackson lying on a bed, revealing he's the one singing contemplating the senseless violence. The singer notices rival gangs and leaves. Michael Jackson dons a red leather J. Parks brand jacket, and dances his way towards the fight through the diner <b>and</b> <b>pool</b> hall. A knife fight is taking place between the two gang leaders in a warehouse. They dance battle for an interlude of music until MJ arrives; the singer breaks up the fight and launches into a dance routine. The video ends with the gang members joining him in the dance, agreeing that violence is not the solution to their problems.|$|E

5|$|Thermotropic chiral LCs whose pitch varies {{strongly}} with temperature {{can be used}} as crude liquid crystal thermometers, since the color of the material will change as the pitch is changed. Liquid crystal color transitions are used on many aquarium <b>and</b> <b>pool</b> thermometers as well as on thermometers for infants or baths. Other liquid crystal materials change color when stretched or stressed. Thus, liquid crystal sheets are often used in industry to look for hot spots, map heat flow, measure stress distribution patterns, and so on. Liquid crystal in fluid form is used to detect electrically generated hot spots for failure analysis in the semiconductor industry.|$|E
5|$|Wayte {{graduated}} from the University of Florida with a bachelor's degree in telecommunications in 1989. She retired from competition swimming following the 1988 Olympics, {{and worked as a}} fund-raiser for the International Swimming Hall of Fame. She became a celebrity promoter and endorsed products and services on behalf of Alamo Rent a Car, the National Spa <b>and</b> <b>Pool</b> Institute, and Speedo. She later worked as a television broadcaster for the Sports Channel network, covering NCAA and international swimming competitions and interviewing fans at NBA games.

5|$|An {{alternate}} {{video was}} shot for the song's remix. It too {{was directed by}} Carey, and was shot in black and white. The shot of Carey in a beret that would become the cover for this single is {{a scene from the}} video. The video features cameo appearances by Da Brat and Xscape. It begins with Carey and the duo spending time recording the song in Carey's in-home studio. In the video, Carey is wearing a large white, straw hat and features long golden hair. As the trio finishes the song, scenes of Carey by her pool are shown, with cameos made by her dog, Jack. Brat and Xscape are seen poolside with Carey, playing cards and drinking beer, as the trio further bond and laugh. Towards the end of the video, scenes of the trio in the studio are shows, and intermingled with snippets of Carey walking inside her mansion, shared with then husband Tommy Mottola. The video ends with Carey and Brat bonding by the studio <b>and</b> <b>pool.</b>|$|E
