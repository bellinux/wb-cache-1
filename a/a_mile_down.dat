25|$|Bacon became Jefferson's primary {{overseer}} {{and business}} manager, working at Monticello beginning September 29, 1806 until 1822. He {{lived with his}} family in a modest house near the base of Monticello mountain. The home was close to Jefferson's nail forge (called a nailry) and several cabins belonging to slave families, all situated along a carriage road approximately <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>down</b> the same road that passed along the Monticello estate and plantation grounds.|$|E
25|$|As {{early as}} 1850, the {{inhabitants}} of the hamlet of La Croix du Bac, which is included as a part of Steenwerck, but is just over <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>down</b> the road, had designed a project to build a church, despite opposition from the parish priest of Steenwerck, {{as well as from the}} town council and local merchants. A plot of land was offered by Mr. Amand Chieux. Some residents of La Croix du Bac gave money, others gave their labour and materials: and, so the Church of Our Lady of Sorrows was built.|$|E
25|$|The Princess and {{her husband}} had homes in London, Chesterfield House and in Yorkshire, first Goldsborough Hall, and later Harewood House. While at Goldsborough Hall, Princess Mary had {{internal}} alterations made by the architect Sydney Kitson, to suit the upbringing of her two children and instigated the development of formal planting of beech-hedge-lined long borders from the south terrace looking for a quarter of <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>down</b> an avenue of lime trees. The limes were planted by her relatives as they visited the Hall throughout the 1920s, including her father George V and her mother Queen Mary.|$|E

500|$|De Laurentiis visited Ridley Scott {{on the set}} of Gladiator and {{suggested}} to Ridley he read the novel he had bought the rights to. Scott was in the third week before principal photography was due to finish on Gladiator. Gladiator became a commercial and critical success, earning 12 Academy Award nominations. De Laurentiis asked Scott if he would like to direct the film version of Hannibal. Scott misunderstood which Hannibal he meant, thinking De Laurentiis was speaking of the general and historical figure from Carthage who nearly brought down the Roman Empire back around 200 B.C., so he replied: [...] "Basically, Dino, I'm doing a Roman epic right now. I don't wanna do elephants coming over the Alps next, old boy." [...] Scott read the manuscript in four sittings within a week, believing it to be a [...] "symphony", and expressed his desire to do it. Scott further explains how he got involved: [...] "I was shooting Gladiator in Malta and one day, for the hell of it, I went for a walk for half <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>down</b> the road to the Malta Film Studio to see my old buddy Dino. I had not seen him since I'd worked on a version of Dune. This was pre-Blade Runner. Dino had pursued me to direct Dune and another film. He's always enthusiastic and aggressive and came after me when I did both Blade Runner and Alien, but I couldn't do the films. Anyway, we had an espresso together and a few days later, he called me to ask if he could visit the Gladiator set. He arrived with a manuscript of Hannibal, about a month before it was published in book form. He said: 'Let's make this one.' I haven't read anything so fast since The Godfather. It was so rich in all kind of ways." ...|$|E

According to Merle Travis, [...] "At that time [...] "Western swing" [...] was a household word. Al Dexter {{had had a}} million-seller on his [...] "Pistol Packin' Mama" [...] record. Bob Wills was heard on every jukebox with this [...] "San Antonio Rose". T. Texas Tyler was doing well with his [...] "Remember Me (When the Candlelights are Gleaming)". It was practically impossible to wedge your way into the Palace Barn where Red Murrell and his band were playing. <b>A</b> <b>mile</b> <b>down</b> the hill was the Riverside Rancho. You were lucky to find a ticket on a Wednesday night. Tex Williams and his Western Caravan were playing there." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{contrast}} to the western slopes and ridge-top grass promenade, the Coniston face is all crag. A short high level spur juts out from the summit, ending in the shattered cliffs of Raven Tor. To either side of this promontory is a corrie tarn, Low Water {{to the south and}} Levers Water to the north. Low Water is the smaller, its depth increased by a stone faced dam built by the nearby slate quarries. The outflow drops via a fine waterfall to join Levers Water Beck <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>down</b> stream. Levers Water was also dammed in times past for industrial use (in this case the Coniston Coppermines), but now provides domestic supply for Coniston village. The stone faced dam has increased its depth to some 125ft. Running parallel to the ridge below Low Water is an unusual lateral valley, named [...] "Boulder Valley" [...] on Ordnance Survey maps due to the number of large erratics on its floor.|$|E
