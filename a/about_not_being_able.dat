He has noted that some players have complained <b>about</b> <b>not</b> <b>being</b> <b>able</b> to decorate their houses non-functionally, but is unsympathetic, saying that the game is not FarmVille. The game was, however, influenced by Minecraft, which—while heavily tied to cosmetic decoration—involves similar themes of protecting one's creations from other players as in The Castle Doctrine.|$|E

[...] "A Plague of Lighthouse Keepers" [...] was inspired by Hammill's fascination with the sea, and the narrative is about a lighthouse keeper who keeps seeing people die offshore. He feels guilty <b>about</b> <b>not</b> <b>being</b> <b>able</b> to help, and the song's ending is left open, leaving the listener to decide if the keeper has committed suicide or rationalised events to live in peace. Banton was against putting [...] "A Plague of Lighthouse Keepers" [...] on the album, wanting more commercial material such as the previous album H to He, Who Am the Only One's [...] "Killer", but after a band meeting he agreed to rehearse the song and worked out an arrangement.
