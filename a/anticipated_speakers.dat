2500|$|Santorum {{received}} a primetime speaking slot at the 2012 Republican National Convention. He was originally slated to speak {{early in the}} evening, but convention organizers moved him to 9pm with the other highly <b>anticipated</b> <b>speakers</b> of the evening, Ann Romney and convention keynote Chris Christie. Santorum spoke of the American dream his immigrant grandfather worked to give his family, and said Obama was turning the dream into a nightmare. He talked about his experiences on the presidential campaign trail, speaking with emotion about his daughter Bella and meeting disabled people and their families. He {{emphasized the importance of}} strengthening marriage and the family. He also condemned Barack Obama's actions on the welfare reform law, of which {{he was one of the}} chief proponents in Congress, and his actions on education, including school choice and student loans. Santorum concluded his speech to a standing ovation, saying, ...|$|E
40|$|Conversational turns often {{proceed with}} very brief pauses between speakers. In order to {{maintain}} “no gap, no overlap” turntaking, we {{must be able to}} anticipate when an ongoing utterance will end, tracking the current speaker for upcoming points of potential floor exchange. The precise set of cues that listeners use for turn-end boundary anticipation is not yet established. We used an eyetracking paradigm to measure adults’ and children’s online turn processing as they watched videos of conversations in their native language (English) and a range of other languages they did not speak. Both adults and children <b>anticipated</b> <b>speaker</b> transitions effectively. In addition, we observed evidence of turn-boundary anticipation for questions even in languages that were unknown to participants, suggesting that listeners’ success in turn-end anticipation does not rely solely on lexical information...|$|R
5000|$|Recognitional overlap {{occurs when}} a <b>speaker</b> <b>anticipates</b> the {{possible}} remainder of an unfinished sentence, and attempts to finish it for the current speaker. In other words, the overlap arises because the current speaker tries to finish the sentence, when simultaneously the other speaker [...] "think aloud" [...] to reflect {{his understanding of the}} ongoing speech.|$|R
40|$|Lateral {{is one of}} {{the four}} voiced consonants in Standard Chinese and it often {{displays}} many variants in pronunciation because of different following vowels. It’s distribution of formant frequency changes greatly with different vowels and assumes strong coarticulation. It is suggested that the coarticulation is different from person to person. Whereas lateral has relative stability and value of formant frequency of the same speaker assumes relative stable state. Therefore, the individual features of the coarticulation may be <b>anticipated</b> in <b>speaker’s</b> sound. The aim of the article is to study coarticulation of lateral with different vowels, it’s behavior in different speakers and application in speaker identification. 1...|$|R
60|$|Ladies and gentlemen--Fortunately for me, and {{fortunately}} for you, {{it is the}} duty of the Chairman on an occasion of this nature, to be very careful that he does not <b>anticipate</b> those <b>speakers</b> who come after him. Like Falstaff, with a considerable difference, he has to be the cause of speaking in others. It is rather his duty to sit and hear speeches with exemplary attention than to stand up to make them; so I shall confine myself, in opening these proceedings as your business official, to as plain and as short an exposition as I can possibly give you of the reasons why we come together.|$|R
40|$|Generally, speech {{recognition}} engines can employ two different grammar methods, rule and dictation, to recognize an utterance. The {{purpose of these}} grammars is to constrain the search space {{in a way that}} <b>anticipates</b> the <b>speaker's</b> utterance. The research described in this paper attempts to maintain the accuracy of a rule grammar without limiting the speaker to rigorous phraseology. Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) is used to connect specific grammar rules with the meanings underlying matching phrases resulting in utterances being matched to knowledge base elements even though the exact phrase did not match any grammar rule. A separate knowledge base is used to dynamically add or remove grammar rules in the {{speech recognition}} engine as the conversation context changes. Finally, a learning technique is used to create new regular expressions based on utterances that matched semantically through LSA...|$|R
40|$|Non-native {{speakers}} {{have lower}} linguistic competence than native speakers, which renders their language less reliable in conveying their intentions. We suggest that expectations of lower competence lead listeners to adapt their manner of processing when {{they listen to}} non-native speakers. We propose that listeners use cognitive resources to adjust by increasing their reliance on top-down processes and extracting less information from {{the language of the}} non-native speaker. An eye-tracking study supports our proposal by showing that when following instructions by a non-native speaker, listeners make more contextually-induced interpretations. Those with relatively high working memory also increase their reliance on context to <b>anticipate</b> the <b>speaker’s</b> upcoming reference, and are less likely to notice lexical errors in the non-native speech, indicating that they take less information from the speaker’s language. These results contribute {{to our understanding of the}} flexibility in language processing and have implications for interactions between native and non-native speaker...|$|R
40|$|Adults achieve {{successful}} coordination during conversation {{by using}} prosodic and lexicosyntactic cues to predict upcoming changes in speakership. We examined the relative weight of these linguistic cues in {{the prediction of}} upcoming turn structure by toddlers learning Dutch (Experiment 1; N = 21) and British English (Experiment 2; N = 20) and adult control participants (Dutch: N = 16; English: N = 20). We tracked participants' anticipatory eye movements as they watched videos of dyadic puppet conversation. We controlled the prosodic and lexicosyntactic cues to turn completion for {{a subset of the}} utterances in each conversation to create four types of target utterances (fully incomplete, incomplete syntax, incomplete prosody, and fully complete). All participants (Dutch and English toddlers and adults) used both prosodic and lexicosyntactic cues to <b>anticipate</b> upcoming <b>speaker</b> changes, but weighed lexicosyntactic cues over prosodic ones when the two were pitted against each other. The results suggest that Dutch and English toddlers are already nearly adult-like in their use of prosodic and lexicosyntactic cues in anticipating upcoming turn transitions. 18 page(s...|$|R
40|$|When {{listeners}} {{search for}} the referent of a speaker's expression, they experience interference from privileged knowledge, knowledge outside of their 'common ground' with the speaker. Evidence is presented that this interference reflects limitations in lexical processing. In three experiments, listeners' eye movements were monitored as they searched for {{the target of a}} speaker's referring expression in a display that also contained a phonological competitor (e. g., bucket/buckle). Listeners <b>anticipated</b> that the <b>speaker</b> would refer to something in common ground, but they did not experience less interference from a competitor in privileged ground than from a matched competitor in common ground. In contrast, interference from the competitor was eliminated when it was ruled out by a semantic constraint. These findings support a view of comprehension as relying on multiple systems with distinct access to information and present a challenge for constraint-based views of common ground...|$|R
5000|$|As Italy {{joined the}} war {{on the side of}} the Allies in 1915, Tolomei joined the Italian armed forces under the {{pseudonym}} [...] "Eugenio Treponti", to avoid being executed as a traitor if caught by the Austrians. He was immediately assigned to the Chiefs of Staff committee. The Archivio continued to appear as Serie di Guerra - War series, printed in Rome. The spectrum of the topics changed, and most articles were now written by Tolomei himself. As a result, the magazine's propagandistic intentions became more obvious. From 1915 onwards, Tolomei increased his lobbying activities, sending several letters to government officials and nationalistic associations detailing his views on the steps to be taken for and after the annexation of South Tyrol. He <b>anticipated</b> that German <b>speakers</b> would assimilate to the Italian language and culture, although there were already thoughts of a possible resettlement. Also in 1915, he published his programmatic points for the [...] "annexation and adaptation" [...] of South Tyrol in the Archivio per l'Alto Adige. In its Volume 11 of 1916 appeared the Prontuario dei nomi locali dell'Alto Adige, a translation of over 10,000 village and place names. [...] "... for the first time, the entirety of the indigenous nomenclature of place names, including the names of geographical features and farmsteads, were transformed into another language through one man's act of will".|$|R
40|$|This study investigates {{tasks in}} which {{international}} graduate {{students who are}} non-native speakers of English must use a second or foreign language (L 2) in simulated conflict and stressful situations with native speakers. In particular, the study examines conflicts where the non-native speaker (NNS) must issue a directive to a native speaker (NS) {{in order to achieve}} an important outcome or avoid unwanted or even dangerous consequences. Unlike previous studies which place equal or no emphasis on the consequences of the directive under investigation, this study focuses on the perlocutionary effect that the <b>speaker</b> <b>anticipates</b> {{as a result of the}} utterance of a directive. Although this is an empirical study, it also critically examines the directive as a macro or discursive speech act colored by the relationships Power, Distance and perceived Consequences of the speaker based on the context of the situation in which it is uttered. The analysis of the data reveals that most advanced NNS have difficulty in high stakes situations based on a comparison of their directives to NS directives, supporting the hypothesis that the encoding of power in a directive is essential to the NNS as well as to the NS in attaining or avoiding some important result. The qualitative evidence further suggests that an important source of this difficulty is the constant awareness that even the advanced NNS is still a NNS and this produces a diminished sense of power relative to NSs...|$|R
40|$|This study investigates {{potential}} L 1 -effects at the syntax-discourse interface in L 2 English, specifically L 1 -transfer {{of information}} status properties of Left Dislocation (LD). According to the Interface Hypothesis (Sorace, 2003), L 2 -learners {{are prone to}} L 1 -influence at interfaces between various types linguistic knowledge, even at advanced stages. LD is a syntactic construction that requires the coordination of syntactic and pragmatic knowledge, thereby representing an interface at which L 2 -learners may be vulnerable to influence from their L 1. English, French, and Norwegian differ {{with respect to the}} information status of discourse referents that LD can encode. While English and Norwegian LD predominantly encode new information, evoked information occurs very frequently in French LD. It was therefore <b>anticipated</b> that native <b>speakers</b> of French would exhibit a preference for evoked referents in LD in their L 2 English, while native speakers of Norwegian would have the same preferences in their L 2 English as L 1 speakers of English regarding the information status of referents encoded in LD. Furthermore, as LD is an extremely frequent phenomenon in French compared to English, it was expected that L 1 speakers of French would show an overall higher acceptance of LD in their L 2 English compared to L 1 speakers of English. Two groups of L 2 speakers of English were included in the study, one whose L 1 was French and one whose L 1 was Norwegian, in addition to a control group of native speakers of English. Participation involved completing an electronic survey in which participants were asked to judge samples of LDs encoding referents of varying degrees of newness according to how ‘natural’ the sentences felt to them. The results showed that {{there was no significant difference}} between the groups regarding overall acceptance of LD. However, a significant difference within each group regarding the acceptance of different referent types in the LD was found. In the French group, there was a preference for evoked referents over new referents in LD, while the control group and the Norwegian group displayed the opposite pattern of preference. This suggests that L 1 -effects exist at this particular aspect of the syntax-discourse interface in speakers at relatively advanced levels of proficiency...|$|R
