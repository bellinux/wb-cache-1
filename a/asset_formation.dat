40|$|Employee {{participation}} in the capital or profit of the firm {{is regarded as a}} suitable way to increase labour productivity if the employees' performance can not be monitored directly. Nonetheless employee {{participation in}} <b>asset</b> <b>formation</b> is currently used by few German firms. In this paper we show that the direct effect on productivity of employee participation in <b>asset</b> <b>formation</b> is only small and is furthermore statistically insignificant. The study was conducted using the representative data of the 1999 and 2000 waves of the IAB establishment panel. This result contradicts previous studies, some of which have derived impressive positive productivity effects. The methodological innovation in this study is the consideration of unobserved heterogeneity between firms that use employee participation in <b>asset</b> <b>formation</b> and firms that do not. It emerges here that firms which offer employee participation are more productive on average as a result of unobserved factors. Thus the cause for their higher productivity can not be attributed to the existence of employee participation. In addition it is shown that the production functions of firms with and without employee participation differ greatly from each other.

In this paper the effect of employee participation in <b>asset</b> <b>formation</b> as an incentive to increase performance is examined as a way of raising the productivity within an individual firm. Linking employees' pay with the success of the firm can lead to an improvement in the overall success of the firm via an increase in the employees' performance, and thus to higher individual remuneration. Using the data from the 1998 IAB establishment panel this paper first ascertains that firms not using employee participation in <b>asset</b> <b>formation</b> have poorer average productivity values. The median for western German firms not using employee participation is 64 % of the value for the firms that do use it (eastern German firms: 72 %). In addition to this there are also clear productivity deficits.

A total of 482 households (195 irrigation users and 287 non-users) were used to generate all the necessary variables. To capture {{the impact of the}} irrigation on household welfare, two indicators were consideredv namely household farm income (Y) and household fixed <b>asset</b> <b>formation</b> (F) (evaluated at market Price during the survey period).

This shows how important the micro-irrigation schemes are in improving the welfare of poor farmers in the research areas. Furthermore, the empirical results show that the probability of using one of the water sources (irrigation scheme) is associated with farm experience (age as proxy), farmer-to-farmer contact (the existence of an irrigation user neighbour), family size, the state of credit constraint, the number of visits by extension agents and the cost of irrigation development.

A substantial number of populations in Mumbai city are the fishing communities, popularly known as ‘Koli’. They are the earliest inhabitants of the city. Coastal cities are most productive as well as most vulnerable to environmental changes. They support a number of economic activities which include fishing, agriculture, urbanization, real estate, tourism, transport, oil exploration etc. As a result, the anthropogenic pressure on coastal cities is increasing. Koli communities in Mumbai encounter diverse socio-economic and climatic pressures including sea level rise, floods, storms, etc. The implications of climate change on Koli communities as well as other environmental issues pertaining to fishing villages in Mumbai are discussed in detail in this study. Five fishing villages from Mumbai are selected for a primary study based on a structured questionnaire.

To this effect primary and secondary data was collected from the rural households of the study area. Both descriptive analysis and econometrics models were used for data analysis. The study has two main impact indicators, i. e, asset holding and sustainable land management. Under asset the livestock asset is converted to the Tropical Livestock Unit (TLU) while the non-livestock assets are measured based on their current market value as reported by the respondents. Under the land management there are two groups: soil conservation (stone and soil bunds, in meter per timad) and fertility improvement practices (chemical and natural fertilizer application, in kg and quintal per timad respectively). Based on the econometrics estimation results selection (participation in the productive safety net programs) was significantly influenced by household demographic characteristics, such as household head gender, family size, number of active female labor, and housing condition and number of food gap months per year experienced by the household. The second stage outcome that is the impact of program participation was found to be positive and significant for both <b>asset</b> <b>formation</b> (livestock, productive and non-productive) and land management (soil and stone bund, and chemical and natural fertilizer).
