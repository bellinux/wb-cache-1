The 1992, 1993 and 1994 series <b>all</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> NSW as the talent and experience of Blues players such as Brett Mullins, Daley and Stuart in the backs and Benny Elias and Bradley Clyde in the forwards gave the Blues the edge when the games were on the line.

25|$|In 2009, {{under the}} Phase II of the city's Select Bus Service (SBS) program, faster bus service to LaGuardia Airport was {{recommended}} {{as a primary}} need. Under the LaGuardia Airport Access Alternatives Analysis study, another SBS study which was conducted by NYCDOT in partnership with MTA Bus, New York City Transit, and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in 2011-2012, it was recommended that a bus route should connect the central terminals of LaGuardia and transit hubs in Jackson Heights and Woodside. At these transit hubs, transfers {{could be made to}} the subway, Long Island Rail Road and buses from the new connector route. The reason for the creation of the study was the slow bus service on the , and Q72, which <b>all</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> LaGuardia Airport.|$|E

25|$|In Metro Center, some of Springfield's former hotels, factories, {{and other}} {{institutions}} have been converted into apartment buildings and luxury condominiums. For example, Springfield's ornate Classical High School (235 State Street), with its immense Victorian atrium– where Dr. Seuss, Timothy Leary, and Taj Mahal <b>all</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> high school– is now a luxury condominium building. The Hotel Kimball, (140 Chestnut Street), which hosted several U.S. Presidents as guests and once featured the United States' first commercial radio station (WBZ), has been converted into The Kimball Towers Condominiums. The former McIntosh Shoe Company (158 Chestnut Street), one of Springfield's finest examples of the Chicago School of Architecture, has been converted into industrial-style condominiums; and the red-brick, former Milton Bradley toy factory is now Stockbridge Court Apartments (45 Willow Street). In the Ridgewood Historic District, the 1950s-futurist Mulberry House (101 Mulberry Street), is now a condominium building that features {{some of the finest}} views of Springfield.|$|E
25|$|Poirot and {{the police}} {{question}} the suspects and examine alibis. Kenneth was heard typing letters specifically responding to figures in previous mail. Linda falsely claims she was fond of her stepmother. By her watch, she and Christine went to Gull Cove at 10:30 and returned at 11:45, giving them an alibi. The Gardeners were with Poirot the entire time. Rosamund was seen reading at Sunny Ledge (above Pixy Cove) by Emily and Patrick. Rev. Lane and Major Barry were absent the whole day and Sir Horace Blatt went sailing. Christine, Rosamund, Kenneth and Mr Gardener <b>all</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> play tennis at noon. Earlier in the day, Miss Brewster was nearly hit on the head by an empty bottle tossed {{from one of the}} bedroom windows, so Poirot asks the chambermaid if she has observed a bottle missing.

On 18 March 2011 they played to a sellout crowd at the University of Hull, a move which saw local media refer to the show as [...] "the comeback of the century". The group subsequently performed at Butlin's in Bognor Regis and various university Freshers' Week events, with a scheduled tour of Australia in May 2012.

500|$|Roberts {{was born}} in Pineland, Texas but grew up in Oakland, California. He {{attended}} McClymonds High School in West Oakland, the same high school future professional athletes Frank Robinson, Vada Pinson, Bill Russell and Curt Flood <b>all</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> {{within a few years}} of each other. Soon after finishing high school at the age of 17, Roberts began his professional career with the Kansas City Monarchs in the Negro Leagues. He played four seasons (1947–1950) with the Monarchs, where his teammates included Satchel Paige, Hilton Smith, Buck O'Neil and Elston Howard. Roberts was signed by the Boston Braves in 1951 by the recommendation of scout Andy Cohen, who saw him play in the Mexican League during the 1950 off-season. They sent Roberts to their minor leagues affiliate in the Western League, the Denver Bears where Cohen was the manager. Prior to the 1952 season, the Bears became an affiliate of the Pittsburgh Pirates, and as part of a working agreement between the Braves and the Pirates, Roberts {{became a member of the}} Pirates organization for a $10,000 sum. Originally a shortstop in the Negro Leagues, he became a second baseman during his tenure with the Bears, and started to build a reputation as an excellent fielder, leading all minor league second basemen in fielding percentage in 1953. He stayed with the Bears for the next two seasons, playing a combined total of 280 games with 15 home runs and a [...]285 batting average.|$|E
