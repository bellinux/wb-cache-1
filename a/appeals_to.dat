40|$|Aim: This paper {{examines}} <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> fear in general: its perceived positive aspects, its negative characteristics, its appropriate {{as well as}} its fallacious use. Background: <b>Appeal</b> <b>to</b> fear is {{a commonly}} used marketing method that attempts to change behaviour by creating anxiety in those receiving a fearful message. It is regularly used in public health initiatives such as anti-smoking, anti-drunk driving campaigns as well as in hypertension awareness campaigns. Some chiropractors appear <b>to</b> use <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> fear to promote subluxation awareness and thereby encourage the use of chiropractic treatment. Research supporting its use is equivocal; nevertheless, when used judiciously, <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> fear probably has sufficient strengths to warrant its continued conditional use. When used to promote care {{for which there is no}} supporting evidence, its use is fallacious. Discussion: <b>Appeal</b> <b>to</b> fear has been used in health promotion campaigns for sixty years or more with the intent of modifying behaviours. While there is evidence <b>to</b> suggest that <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> fear may motivate some individuals to modify offending behaviour or adopt recommended behaviour there is growing resistance to the use of <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> fear on ethical and psychological grounds. Using <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> fear as a tool of persuasion can be valid or fallacious depending on the truth of the premises within the argument. When used to raise awareness about genuine health concerns such as smoking, drunk driving and hypertension <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> fear is considered to be a valid approach with certain caveats. However, when <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> fear, not based on evidence or reason, is used as motivator to get others to accept unnecessary interventions for unproven disorders, the use of <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> fear is fallacious. Conclusion: In spite of the evidence against its use, it seems likely that <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> fear will continue to be used in conjunction with other public awareness initiatives to modify recognized detrimental behaviours such as smoking and drunk driving as well as silent killers such as hypertension. However, when used to promote a treatment that has no evidentiary basis such as subluxation based practice in chiropractic the <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> fear is a fallacy and must be stopped...|$|R

5|$|One {{does not}} only feel a social or {{external}} pressure to fulfill roles {{and expectations of}} being a good parent, sibling, or child, however. There is a distinctly emotional and internal pressure to be ‘good’ due to psychological attachments in spousal, sibling and/or parent-children relationships. Psychological persuasion in advertisements <b>appeals</b> <b>to</b> one's motives, attitudes and personalities. The family symbol is psychologically persuasive in that it <b>appeals</b> <b>to</b> the emotional attachments between spouses, siblings, or parent-child relationships. To continue the above example, the mother not only wants to purchase a product that purportedly limits irritation or harm for her child due to her social role and expectations, but also because she feels an emotional attachment to her child. The attempt to activate the emotions of audiences and to psychologically persuade is popular among advertisements.
