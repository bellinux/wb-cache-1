5|$|According to {{traditional}} accounts, Laozi was a scholar {{who worked as}} the Keeper of the Archives for the royal court of Zhou. This reportedly allowed him broad access to {{the works of the}} Yellow Emperor and other classics of the time. The stories assert that Laozi never opened a formal school but nonetheless attracted a large number of students <b>and</b> <b>loyal</b> disciples. There are many variations of a story retelling his encounter with Confucius, most famously in the Zhuangzi.|$|E
5|$|On 28 June 1540 Cromwell, Henry's {{longtime}} advisor <b>and</b> <b>loyal</b> servant, was executed. Different {{reasons were}} advanced: that Cromwell would not enforce the Act of Six Articles; {{that he had}} supported Barnes, Latimer and other heretics; {{and that he was}} responsible for Henry's marriage to Anne of Cleves, his fourth wife. Many other arrests under the Act followed. Cranmer lay low.|$|E

The commissar returned for the funeral <b>and,</b> <b>loyal</b> to his Bolshevik principles, refused to allow his wife's coffin to enter the local church. With the only way into the churchyard through the church, he had the coffin lifted and passed over the fence into the burial ground, shocking the village.|$|E
5|$|As one of {{the last}} {{remaining}} major poets of the Silver Age, she was newly acclaimed by the Soviet authorities as a fine <b>and</b> <b>loyal</b> representative of their country and permitted to travel. At the same time, by virtue of works such as Requiem, Akhmatova was being hailed at home and abroad as an unofficial leader of the dissident movement, and reinforcing this image herself. She was becoming representative of both the Soviet Union and Tsarist Russia, more popular in the 1960s than she had ever been before the revolution, this reputation only continuing to grow after her death. For her 75th birthday in 1964, new collections of her verse were published.|$|E

5|$|Barring a few {{exceptions}} where Trijata is cast as Ravana's agent, she is generally portrayed as a friend <b>and</b> <b>loyal</b> companion of Sita in her adversity. On numerous occasions, she offers solace to Sita and brings news from the outside world; she also dissuades Sita from committing suicide. After Rama's victory and Ravana's death, Trijata is richly rewarded by Sita and Rama. While some Ramayana adaptations mention her being a devotee of Rama, Southeast Asian versions often depict her as the wife of Rama's monkey general Hanuman, whom she bears a son. She is worshipped as a local goddess in Varanasi and Ujjain; both in India.|$|E
5|$|Details of the {{assassination}} attempt were allegedly known by the principal Jesuit of England, Father Henry Garnet. Although {{he was convicted of}} treason and sentenced to death, doubt has been cast on how much he really knew of the plot. As its existence was revealed to him through confession, Garnet was prevented from informing the authorities by the absolute confidentiality of the confessional. Although anti-Catholic legislation was introduced soon after the plot's discovery, many important <b>and</b> <b>loyal</b> Catholics retained high office during King James I's reign. The thwarting of the Gunpowder Plot was commemorated for many years afterwards by special sermons and other public events such as the ringing of church bells, which have evolved into the Bonfire Night of today.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool and Newcastle United {{are two of}} {{the biggest}} clubs in English football. Despite not having won a major honour since 1969, the Tyneside club is {{recognised}} for its passionate <b>and</b> <b>loyal</b> fanbase—over the course of 53 out of 63 seasons between 1946–47 and 2009–10, more people attended Newcastle home matches, on average, than home games played by the league champions. During the 1970s and 1980s, Liverpool became the most successful club in England, amassing 11 league championships in a 17-year period. Both clubs had previously faced each other five times in the Premier League, following Newcastle's promotion for the 1993–94 season; Newcastle had won three times and Liverpool once, with the remaining match ending in a draw.|$|E

5|$|Prospective colourists at A. Farsari & Co. {{were interviewed}} by Farsari himself, who ensured they were {{familiar}} with Japanese painting techniques. Once hired, they were given unpaid instruction for several months, and then a basic salary that steadily increased as Farsari became satisfied with their work. A capable <b>and</b> <b>loyal</b> colourist could earn twice the rate offered at other Yokohama studios and double his own daily rate for work on Sundays. Colourists also received regular bonuses and gifts. On the other hand, Farsari complained {{in a letter to}} his sister that to motivate his employees he had to rage, swear and beat them, which he did according to a fixed schedule. By 1891 A. Farsari & Co. had 32 employees, 19 of whom were hand-colouring artists.|$|E
5|$|Ruth {{is portrayed}} as being strong-willed, {{determined}} <b>and</b> <b>loyal.</b> She is also a New Woman and a farmer, traits that made her {{stand out from the}} other female characters in The Archers {{at the time of her}} introduction. In later years, Ruth has mellowed and is more open to negotiation. Her storylines have often revolved around her marriage to David and her work on Brookfield Farm. In the early 2000s, the scriptwriters had Ruth and David isolate themselves from the community during a foot-and-mouth outbreak. Ruth was also diagnosed with breast cancer, a storyline which Finch undertook extensive research for and later named as one of her Archers highlights.|$|E
5|$|The Clumber Spaniel is a {{breed of}} dog of the spaniel type, {{developed}} in the United Kingdom. It is {{the largest of the}} spaniels, and comes in predominantly white with either lemon or orange markings, but can sometimes be either brown or lemon predominantly. The name of the breed is taken from Clumber Park in Nottinghamshire where the breed was first developed. It is a gundog that specialises in hunting in heavy cover. They are gentle <b>and</b> <b>loyal,</b> and can act aloof with strangers. They have several habits which could be considered disadvantages, including a constant shedding of its coat and snoring.|$|E

5|$|The Molossian {{kingdom of}} Epirus {{had been an}} {{important}} subject ally of Macedon since 350 BC, when Philip had taken the son of king Arybbas, Alexander hostage. During this time at court, Alexander (brother of Philip's wife Olympias), had grown into an admirer of Philip, and Philip therefore decided to replace Arybbas with Alexander. The exact date this occurred is unclear; Cawkwell suggests this happened in early 342 BC, when Alexander would have been 20, {{as a prelude to}} his Thracian campaign. Arybbas went into exile in Athens, where he was promised help to regain his kingdom; however, Alexander would remain on the throne (<b>and</b> <b>loyal</b> to Philip) until his death in 334 BC. Philip certainly campaigned against the Epirote Cassopaeans in early 342 BC, taking control of three cities to secure the southern regions of his kingdom.|$|E
5|$|The film marked {{something}} of an {{end of an era}} for its creator. The director himself recognized this {{at the time of its}} release, telling critic Donald Richie that a cycle of some kind had just come to an end and that his future films and production methods would be different. His prediction proved quite accurate. Beginning in the late 1950s, television began increasingly to dominate the leisure time of the formerly large <b>and</b> <b>loyal</b> Japanese cinema audience. And as film company revenues dropped, so did their appetite for risk—particularly the risk represented by Kurosawa's costly production methods.|$|E
5|$|The monastery runs a {{fundraising}} {{program for}} cataract {{operations in the}} city, and receives wide support due to public suspicion of charities affiliated with the ruling Communist Party government, due to the communists' strong reputation for rampant corruption. Following the fall of Saigon and the communist takeover, religious bodies were required to be registered with <b>and</b> <b>loyal</b> to the party. The khat si complied {{and became one of}} the nine schools within the state-sanctioned Vietnamese Buddhist Congregation. However, the temple does not fly the national flag, and the only government material or symbols on display within Tịnh Xá Trung Tâm are letters of congratulations for charity initiatives.|$|E
