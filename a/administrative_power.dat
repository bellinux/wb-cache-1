5|$|In 1947, a {{trusteeship}} {{was established}} by the United Nations, with Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom as trustees. Under those arrangements, the UK, Australia and New Zealand were a joint administering authority. The Nauru Island Agreement provided for the first Administrator to be appointed by Australia for 5 years, leaving subsequent appointments {{to be decided by}} the three governments. However, in practice, <b>administrative</b> <b>power</b> was exercised by Australia alone.|$|E

5|$|The city {{reached its}} peak in the 12th century, with a {{population}} of approximately 200,000. It was the centre of <b>administrative</b> <b>power</b> in Egypt, until it was ordered burnt in 1168 by its own vizier, Shawar, to keep its wealth {{out of the hands of}} the invading Crusaders. The remains of the city were eventually absorbed by nearby Cairo, which had been built to the north of Fustat in 969 when the Fatimids conquered the region and created a new city as a royal enclosure for the Caliph. The area fell into disrepair for hundreds of years and was used as a rubbish dump.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of Justinian I's reign he had {{inherited}} a surplus 28,800,000 solidi (400,000 pounds of gold) in the imperial treasury from Anastasius I and Justin I. Under Justinian's rule, measures were taken to counter corruption in the provinces and to make tax collection more efficient. Greater <b>administrative</b> <b>power</b> was given to both {{the leaders of the}} prefectures and of the provinces, while power was taken away from the vicariates of the dioceses, of which a number were abolished. The overall trend was towards a simplification of administrative infrastructure. According to Brown (1971), the increased professionalization of tax collection did much to destroy the traditional structures of provincial life, as it weakened the autonomy of the town councils in the Greek towns. It has been estimated that before Justinian I's reconquests the state had an annual revenue of 5,000,000 solidi in AD 530, but after his reconquests, the annual revenue was increased to 6,000,000 solidi in AD 550.|$|E
5|$|By {{taking this}} new role, Rainilaiarivony {{became the first}} Hova to {{concurrently}} serve as both Prime Minister and Commander-in-Chief. The sociopolitical transformation that had been triggered by the strangling of RadamaII reached its zenith with Rainilaiarivony's consolidation of <b>administrative</b> <b>power.</b> Rasoherina and her successors remained the figureheads of traditional authority, participated in political councils and provided official approval for policies. The Prime Minister issued new policies and laws in the Queen's name. However, the day-to-day governance, security and diplomatic activities of the kingdom principally originated with, and were managed by, Rainilaiarivony and his counselors. This new level of authority enabled the Prime Minister to amass a vast personal fortune, whether through inheritance, gifts or purchase, including 57 houses, large plantations and rice paddies, numerous cattle and thousands of slaves. The most prominent of Rainilaiarivony's properties was the Andafiavaratra Palace, constructed {{for him on the}} slope just below the royal Rova compound by English architect William Pool in 1873.|$|E

5|$|Municipalities in Rhode Island can {{incorporate}} as a town or city {{by a special}} act of the state legislature {{and there is no}} minimum population requirement. Eight municipalities were reincorporated as cities operating under a charter, while the other thirtyone remain as towns which perform similar services. Since Rhode Island has no county level of government, cities and towns provide services commonly performed by county governments in other states. Rhode Island's cities and towns may adopt one of four different forms of government: councilmanager, mayorcouncil, town counciltown meeting, or administratorcouncil. The primary difference between these forms of government is how the chief executive is selected. The Councilmanager system involves an elected council who exercise overall control of the local government and a chief executive termed city or town manager who is generally appointed by and responsible to the council for the administration of local policies. Councilmanager systems may elect a mayor but they have no formal administrative functions with the potential exception of a degree of veto power. Mayorcouncil systems have a similarly elected council however the mayor is elected and yields <b>administrative</b> <b>power.</b> In the town counciltown meeting system, there is no fulltime chief executive. There are no towns or cities in Rhode Island that use the administratorcouncil form of government.|$|E
5|$|The Lord Howe Island Board is a NSW Statutory Authority {{established}} {{under the}} Lord Howe Island Act 1953, {{to administer the}} island {{as part of the}} state of New South Wales. It reports directly to the state's Minister for Environment and Heritage, and is responsible for the care, control and management of the island. Its duties include: the protection of World Heritage values; the control of development; the administration of Crown Land, including the island's protected area; provision of community services and infrastructure; and regulating sustainable tourism. In 1981 the Lord Howe Island Amendment Act gave islanders the <b>administrative</b> <b>power</b> of three members on a five-member Board. The Board also manages the Lord Howe Island Kentia Palm Nursery which, together with tourism, provides the island's only sources of external income. Under an amendment bill in 2004 the Board now comprises seven members, four of whom are elected from the islander community, thus giving about 350 permanent residents a high level of autonomy. The remaining three members are appointed by the Minister to represent the interests of business, tourism and conservation. The full Board meets on the island every three months while the day-to-day affairs of the island are managed by the Board's administration, with a permanent staff that had increased to 22 people by 1988.|$|E

25|$|The {{purpose of}} {{indirect}} rule was to allow natives to govern their own affairs through “customary law.” In practice though, the native authority decided on and enforced its own unwritten rules {{with the support}} of the colonial government.

25|$|The supreme clerical, {{judicial}} and <b>administrative</b> <b>power</b> for {{the whole}} domain of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church is exercised by the Holy Synod, which includes the Patriarch and the diocesan prelates, who are called metropolitans. Church life in the parishes is guided by the parish priests, numbering some 1,500. The Bulgarian Orthodox Church also has some 120 monasteries in Bulgaria, with about 2,000 monks and nearly as many nuns.|$|E
25|$|In 1557, {{during the}} Protestant Reformation, the city adopted Protestantism. Under Mayor Heinrich Stroband (1586–1609), the city became centralized. <b>Administrative</b> <b>power</b> {{passed into the}} hands of the city council. In 1595 Jesuits arrived to promote the Counter-Reformation, taking control of St. John's Church. The Protestant city {{officials}} tried to limit the influx of Catholics into the city, as Catholics (Jesuits and Dominican friars) already controlled most of the churches, leaving only St. Mary's to Protestant citizens.|$|E
50|$|Things {{escalated}} when Fox News began {{reporting on}} the issue.

Days later Wales voluntarily relinquished his <b>administrative</b> <b>powers</b> on Commons under heavy criticism from the Wikimedia community. Fox News also received criticism for its handling of the reporting, especially for misrepresenting the situation regarding the self removal of <b>administrative</b> <b>powers</b> by Wales as leaving the Foundation without clear leadership.|$|R

25|$|From the 14th century onwards, {{most of the}} Salerno {{province}} {{became the}} territory of the Princes of Sanseverino, powerful feudal lords who acted as real owners of the region. They accumulated an enormous political and <b>administrative</b> <b>power</b> and attracted artists and men of letters in their own princely palace. In the 15th century the city was the scene of battles between the Angevin and the Aragonese royal houses with whom the local lords took sides alternatingly.|$|E
25|$|After {{establishing}} the Ming Dynasty, Zhu Yuanzhang began {{to consolidate the}} authority of the royal court. He assigned territories {{to the members of the}} royal family and stationed them across the empire. These members of the royal family did not have the <b>administrative</b> <b>power</b> over their territory, but they were entitled to a personal army that ranges from 3,000 to 19,000 men. Royal members that were stationed in the northern frontier were entitled to even larger forces. For instance, the Prince of Ning was said to have an army of over 80,000 men.|$|E
25|$|The {{discovery}} of tin in Malaya in 1820s {{led to an}} influx of Chinese miners. This discovery led to disputes among the Malay Rulers, Chinese miners, affluent chieftains and villagers, resulting in formal British colonial rule in 1874. By 1885, Malaya became the largest tin producer in the world, accounting for 55% of global tin output. The prosperity brought about by tin mining was primarily shared between the British and the Chinese. As mining towns grew larger and became more economically important, urban infrastructure improved and these mining towns became the seat of <b>administrative</b> <b>power</b> for the British and traditional Malay capitals became insignificant.|$|E

25|$|Cornwall was {{included}} in the survey, initiated by William the Conqueror, the first Norman king of England, which became known as the Domesday Book, where it is included as being part of the Norman king's new domain. Cornwall was unusual as Domesday records no Saxon burh; a burh (borough) was the Saxons' centre of legal and <b>administrative</b> <b>power.</b> Moreover, nearly all land was held by one person, William's half-brother Robert of Mortain, who may have been the first Norman to bear the title Earl of Cornwall. He held his Cornish lands not as a Tenant in Chief of the King, {{as was the case with}} other landowners, but as de facto Viceroy.|$|E
25|$|The Commissioners were {{replaced}} following {{the passing of}} the Land Drainage Act in 1861. A special commission, which was only responsible for King's Sedgemoor, was created, but like their predecessors, they found that their powers were limited, and their ability to raise funds by rates was inadequate. A high tide in 1876 carried the clyse gates away, and the adjacent bridge had to be demolished for safety. Tides passed up the channel and flooded the moors. Work to construct a new bridge with tidal doors cost £16,000, and the area was impoverished by the debt. The Somerset Drainage Act of 1877 was another attempt to sort out the lack of <b>administrative</b> <b>power,</b> but no work was undertaken in King's Sedgemoor. Serious breaches of the banks occurred in 1872, 1891, 1894, 1924 and 1929.|$|E
25|$|When a court protects an applicant's {{substantive}} legitimate expectation, it {{is effectively}} mandating {{the outcome of}} a public body's decision-making process. One criticism is that this undesirably fetters the body's discretion as it will {{no longer be able to}} formulate policy without constraints. Nevertheless, it has been acknowledged that protecting substantive legitimate expectations ensures good administration. Consistency and fairness are reinforced in decision-making processes where the <b>administrative</b> <b>power</b> to alter policy is not used to unduly frustrate legitimate expectations. Furthermore, when a public body acts contrary to what it had induced an individual to expect, it may cause that individual severe hardship, especially if he or she relied on the representation and there is no satisfactory alternative to the substance of the promise. The problem is alleviated if the court orders that the individual's legitimate expectation be given effect.|$|E
