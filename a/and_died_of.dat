40|$|Individuals' {{death anxiety}} or {{fear of death}} has been {{extensively}} investigated, and there are numerous conceptualisations used in the literature, including {{a distinction between the}} dimensions <b>of</b> death <b>and</b> <b>dying</b> <b>of</b> self, <b>and</b> death <b>and</b> <b>dying</b> <b>of</b> others. This paper addresses a gap in the literature, and re-examines the relationship between these two dimensions, which are assumed to be positively, linearly related. Using both quantitative and qualitative data, this study indicates that regardless {{of the degree to which}} individuals fear their own death, most individuals fear the death <b>and</b> <b>dying</b> <b>of</b> others. Specifically, the leaving, or loss of loved ones was a central theme in people's fear of death and this is discussed in relation to current trends in the literature.
