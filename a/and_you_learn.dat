'Misi,' said he, 'you have told me there were wise men, not pastors, not even holy, who knew many things useful to be taught--about trees, for instance, and beasts, and to print books, and about the stones that are burned to make knives of. Such men teach you in your college, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>learn</b> from them, but take care not to learn to be unholy. Misi, Case is my college.' ...|$|E

"Hang it all, miss," [...] said Harry--he used a {{stronger}} expression, {{for he was}} not particular about swearing before ladies, but I won't transcribe all his oaths--"hang it all, that's the way of you girls who have been to England. If I had fifty daughters I'd never send one of 'em home, not I. You go over there, and you get enlightened, as you call it, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>learn</b> a lot of radical fal-lal about equality and a-man-and-a-brother, and all that humbug: and then you come back and despise your own people, who are gentlemen and the sons of gentlemen for fifty generations, from the good old slavery days onward.

6000|$|Now, {{with the}} city's lapse into this tranquiler humor, the promenades cease. The facchino gives all his leisure to {{sleeping}} in the sun; and in the mellow afternoons there is scarcely a space of six feet square on the Riva degli Schiavoni which does not bear its brown-cloaked peasant, basking face-downward in the warmth. The broad steps of the bridges are by right the berths of the beggars; the sailors and fishermen slumber in their boats; and the gondoliers, {{if they do not}} sleep, are yet placated by the season, and forbear to quarrel, and only break into brief clamors at the sight of inaccessible Inglesi passing near them under the guard of valets de place. Even the play of the children ceases, except in the Public Gardens, where the children of the poor have indolent games, and sport as noiselessly as the lizards that slide from shadow to shadow and glitter in the sun asleep. This vernal silence of the city possesses you,--the stranger in it,--not with sadness, not with melancholy, but with a deep sense of the sweetness of doing nothing, and an indifference to all purposes and chances. If ever you cared to have your name on men's tongues, behold! that old yearning for applause is dead. Praise would strike like pain through this delicious calm. And blame? It is a wild and frantic thing to dare it by any effort. Repose takes you to her inmost heart, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>learn</b> her secrets--arcana unintelligible to you in the new-world life of bustle and struggle. Old lines of lazy rhyme win new color and meaning. The mystical, indolent poems whose music once charmed away all will to understand them, are revealed now without your motion.
