One of the physical models which motivate this framework is a quantum particle moving in {{a more or less}} disordered medium. One may however also envisage other scenarios where operators are allowed to depend on interaction terms in a manner we are going to discuss below. The central idea is to vary the occurring infinitely many perturbing potentials independently. As a side aspect this then leads naturally to the analysis <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> interesting <b>questions</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> more or less purely mathematical flavor which belong to the field of infinite dimensional holomorphy or holomorphy in Banach spaces.

Although the quality engineering literature contains a vast collection of work related to this issue, <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> still remain unanswered. First, a quality loss function approach using conventional quality loss functions, such as step-loss and Taguchi loss functions, has been extensively used to determine the optimum process target mainly due to mathematical convenience. When historical data concerning a customer loss associated with product performance are available, a quality loss function using a well-established statistical method, such as regression analysis, may be a more practical alternative procedure. Second, many researchers have carried out their studies based on a single quality characteristic. From the customer's viewpoint, however, products are often judged based on more than one characteristic. To address these questions, this paper first develops a multivariate empirical loss function based on historical data associated with product performance and its associated customer loss and then proposes an optimization scheme for the most economical process target...|$|E
