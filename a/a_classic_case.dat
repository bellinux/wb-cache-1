The contrast of Australian laminal nh/ny and lh/ly and apical n and l has been lost, voicing has become phonemic and s, z, t, d, o and òò have developed. This also affected the phonology of Australian vocabulary, such that these 'foreign' sounds occur in such words.|$|E
25|$|One form of imputed bias {{is based}} on the {{decision-maker}} being a party to a suit, or having a pecuniary or proprietary interest in the outcome of the decision. Once this fact has been established, the bias is irrebuttable and disqualification is automatic – the decision-maker will be barred from adjudicating the matter without the need for any investigation into the likelihood or suspicion of bias. <b>A</b> <b>classic</b> <b>case</b> is Dimes v. Grand Junction Canal Proprietors (1852), which involved an action between Dimes, a local landowner, and the proprietors of the Grand Junction Canal, in which the Lord Chancellor, Lord Cottenham, had affirmed decrees made to the proprietors. However, it was discovered by Dimes that Lord Cottenham in fact owned several pounds worth of shares in the Grand Junction Canal. This eventually led to the judge being disqualified from deciding the case. There was no inquiry as to whether a reasonable person would consider Lord Cottenham to be biased, or as to the circumstances which led Lord Cottenham to hear the case.|$|E

500|$|The {{origin of}} the English word [...] (Old English catt) and its {{counterparts}} in other Germanic languages (such as German Katze), descended from Proto-Germanic *kattōn-, is controversial.

Many references refer to [...] "Berber" [...] (Kabyle) kaddîska [...] "wildcat" [...] and [...] "Nubian kadīs" [...] as possible sources or cognates, but M. Lionel Bender says the Nubian term is a loan from Arabic قِطَّة qiṭṭa.

[...] Huehnergard opines it is [...] "equally likely that the forms might derive from an ancient Germanic word, imported into Latin and thence to Greek and to Syriac and Arabic". Guus Kroonen also considers the word to be native to Germanic (due to morphological alternations) and Northern Europe, and suggests that it might ultimately be borrowed from Uralic, cf.
