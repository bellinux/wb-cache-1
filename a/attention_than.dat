5|$|Though Lancashire was a {{football}} stronghold {{in the early}} years of the professional game, providing a large proportion of Football League teams, the cup final had never been contested between two Lancashire clubs until the 1904 final. 30,000 supporters from the region travelled to London, sparking press reports of records for North-South rail travel. Lacking alternative accommodation, several thousand slept on the platforms at Euston and St Pancras. A jovial atmosphere built up, with the Manchester Industrial Boys Band playing Hiawatha. However, in London itself, the match received less <b>attention</b> <b>than</b> a final featuring a southern team would have done. Tickets in an uncovered stand cost 5s.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the late}} 20th century, Wollstonecraft's life, which {{encompassed}} several unconventional personal relationships, received more <b>attention</b> <b>than</b> her writing. After two ill-fated affairs, with Henry Fuseli and Gilbert Imlay (by {{whom she had}} a daughter, Fanny Imlay), Wollstonecraft married the philosopher William Godwin, one of the forefathers of the anarchist movement. Wollstonecraft {{died at the age}} of 38, eleven days after giving birth to her second daughter, leaving behind several unfinished manuscripts. This daughter, Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin, became an accomplished writer herself, as Mary Shelley, the author of Frankenstein.|$|E
5|$|Women in {{athletics}} often wear bikinis of similar size as those worn in beach volleyball. Amy Acuff, a US high-jumper, {{wore a black}} leather bikini instead of a track suit at the 2000 Summer Olympics. Runner Florence Griffith-Joyner mixed bikini bottoms with one-legged tights at the 1988 Summer Olympics, earning her more <b>attention</b> <b>than</b> her record breaking performance in the women's 200 meters event. In the 2007 South Pacific Games, the rules were adjusted to allow players to wear less revealing shorts and cropped sports tops instead of bikinis. At the West Asian Games in 2006, organizers banned bikini-bottoms for female athletes {{and asked them to}} wear long shorts.|$|E

Claiming to act on Bruce's best interest, she pushes Selina into confessing her feelings to Bruce, thus stealing him from Jezebel Jet before it's too late.|$|R
30|$|In this study, MD are {{employed}} for embedding watermark. Note {{that it is}} not meaningful to analyze the KOA for this study, since the watermark extraction of the proposed method does not require the original image. Besides, the attacker can deduce more knowledge about the secret key from the watermarked content than from pairs of original and watermarked contents, so WOA context deserves much more <b>attentions</b> <b>than</b> the KOA. Thus, only the case of KMA and WOA are considered in this study. The following section will investigate if our scheme can withstand KMA and WOA.|$|R

5|$|Casualty Clearing Stations were {{deliberately}} sited {{as close}} to the front line as possible, since many injuries caused during battle required more urgent <b>attention</b> <b>than</b> the time to travel to a field hospital allowed. Often within seven miles of the front line, they were considered extremely dangerous, and the appropriateness of having nurses attend such stations was hotly debated within the military. As a result of its proximity to the front, the station would often come under enemy attack, as was the case of the 38th British Casualty Station on 23 August. The Casualty Station suffered a heavy air raid by German forces, with the sterilisation room being destroyed and the camp being hit by numerous bombs. Despite the heavy attack, Corkhill, who was attending to the wounded at the time, remained calm and continued to aid the patients. For her actions, she was recommended for and later awarded the Military Medal.|$|E
5|$|Dennis Showalter, {{writing in}} 1975, defended Starship Troopers, {{stating that the}} society {{depicted}} in it did not contain many elements of fascism. He argues that the novel does not include outright opposition to bolshevism and liberalism that would be expected in a fascist society. Others have responded by saying Showalter's argument {{is based on a}} literal reading of the novel, and that the story glorifies militarism to a large extent. Ken Macleod argues that the book does not actually advocate fascism because anybody capable of understanding the oath of Federal Service is able to enlist and thereby obtain political power. Macleod states that Heinlein's books are consistently liberal, but cover a spectrum from democratic to elitist forms of liberalism, Starship Troopers being on the latter end of the spectrum. It has been argued that Heinlein's militarism is more libertarian than fascist, and that this trend is also present in Heinlein's other popular books of the period, such as Stranger in a Strange Land (1961) and The Moon is a Harsh Mistress (1966). This period of Heinlein's writing has received more critical <b>attention</b> <b>than</b> any other, though he continued to write into the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to Majority Leader Gary Hooser's {{statement that he}} intended to bring the bill to a vote before the full Senate, the Hawaii Family Forum stated other issues demanded more <b>attention</b> <b>than</b> civil unions and the bill would create legal challenges for child care and education. The group held demonstrations on Maui and Kauai and stated their intention to hold demonstrations to ask the governor to veto the legislation should the bill advance. Hooser argued for the bill using President Barack Obama's support of civil unions and the support of labor unions and the majority of Hawaii House representatives. The Honolulu Advertiser reported that Senate President Colleen Hanabusa privately told senators the bill could lead to a lawsuit to legalize same-sex marriage. The American Civil Liberties Union of Hawaii and Supreme Court of Hawaii judge Steven H. Levinson told the legislature that a lawsuit would have little chance of success.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{tried to}} {{understand}} the problems encountered by the elderly while using mobile phones through their user models. The purpose was to show the different dimensions of the discrepancies between user and designers models regarding mobile phones. Protocol analysis, structural hinting, and coaching methods were applied in the usability test. The results showed the different levels of operational problems of mobile phones, including physical, perceptual, functional, and conceptual. The problematic scripts of mobile operation, therefore, can be systematically categorized. Finally, conceptual misunderstanding of mobile phones should receive more <b>attentions</b> <b>than</b> the physical features of mobile phones...|$|R

5|$|In {{this book}} I {{maintained}} that a sphere of freedom is still desirable {{even in a}} socialist state, but this sphere has to be defined afresh and not in liberal terms. This doctrine I still hold. The thesis of this book seems to me important, and I hoped that it would attract more <b>attention</b> <b>than</b> it has done. It {{was intended as a}} refutation both of Marx and of the classical economists, not on a point of detail, but on the fundamental assumptions that they shared. I argued that power, rather than wealth, should be the basic concept in social theory, and that social justice should consist in equalisation of power to the greatest practicable degree. It followed that State ownership of land and capital was no advance unless the State was democratic, and even then only if methods were devised for curbing the power of officials. A part of my thesis was taken up and popularised in Burnham's Managerial Revolution, but otherwise the book fell rather flat. I still hold, however, that what it has to say is of very great importance if the evils of totalitarianism are to be avoided, particularly under a Socialist régime.|$|E
5|$|Since Yellowstone {{is one of}} {{the most}} famous {{national}} parks in the world, news coverage was extensive and sometimes sensational. Federal officials sometimes had only limited information to present to the media. The National Park Service received some 3,000 media requests, not all of which the two park public information officers were able to grant, even with the assistance of a staff of over 40 employees. 16 more park personnel were assigned the role of liaisons with the media where fire fighting manpower was concentrated. By the time the fires were under control in mid-November, the park was still receiving 40 to 70 media requests daily. Media coverage of the fires brought the National Park Service more national <b>attention</b> <b>than</b> it had ever received, and the 1988 fire season has been called one of the most important events in the history of that agency.|$|E
5|$|The Navy was {{reasonably}} {{pleased with}} the first ship, Bayan, and decided to order another cruiser {{after the start of}} the Russo-Japanese War in February 1904. Russian shipyards were still unavailable, so the Navy decided to simply order a repeat with minor modifications based on war experience. This was an attempt to minimize the work load on the Naval Technical Committee (Morskoi tekhnicheskii komitet), but they proved to require more <b>attention</b> <b>than</b> planned and a contract was not signed until 20 April 1905. The contract specified that all drawings would be turned over to allow for the construction of two identical ships in St. Petersburg, using newly available slipways. These changes generally added weight and the armor was reduced in thickness to compensate, although the change from Harvey armor to more resistant Krupp armor meant that there was little actual loss in protection.|$|E

Some features are revealed to be interesting issues and need more <b>attentions</b> <b>than</b> expected, such as operating condition, collective effects between cavities, HOM coupler issues, end-group stability, cavity-coupler interactions, and vacuum/gas physics, waiting for more investigations. Up to now SNS cryomodules were mainly tested at 2. 1 K/ 4. 4 K, 10 pulse per second (pps) and 30 pps/ 60 pps tests are under progress. This paper presents briefly the experiences and the observations during tests of cryomodules...|$|R
5|$|The book aroused {{international}} interest and a widespread debate, with no sharp line between scientific issues and ideological, social and religious implications. Much {{of the initial}} reaction was hostile, in a large part because very few reviewers actually understood his theory, but Darwin {{had to be taken}} seriously as a prominent and respected name in science. There was much less controversy than had greeted the 1844 publication Vestiges of Creation, which had been rejected by scientists, but had influenced a wide public readership into believing that nature and human society were governed by natural laws. The Origin of Species as a book of wide general interest became associated with ideas of social reform. Its proponents made full use of a surge in the publication of review journals, and it was given more popular <b>attention</b> <b>than</b> almost any other scientific work, though it failed to match the continuing sales of Vestiges. Darwin's book legitimised scientific discussion of evolutionary mechanisms, and the newly coined term Darwinism was used to cover the whole range of evolutionism, not just his own ideas. By the mid-1870s, evolutionism was triumphant.|$|E

40|$|Built-up area {{detection}} is {{very important}} for applications such as urban planning, urban growth detection and land use monitoring. In this paper, we address the problem of built up area detection from the perspective of visual saliency computation. Generally, areas containing buildings attract more <b>attentions</b> <b>than</b> forests, lands and other backgrounds. This paper explores a Bayesian saliency model to automatically detect urban areas. Firstly, prior probability is computed by using fast multi-scale edge distribution. Then the likelihood is obtained by modelling the distributions of colour and orientation. Built up areas are further detected by segmenting the final saliency map using Graph Cut algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can extract built-up area efficiently and accurately...|$|R
