25|$|The Type 87 Chi-I had a Type 90 57mm cannon as {{its main}} armament, with one machine {{gun in the}} front hull glacis and another located in a small rear turret. The armour was riveted steel plates with a minimum {{thickness}} of 6mm and a maximum of 17mm. The engine compartment was located {{in the middle of}} the hull and the tank was powered by a V8 gasoline engine. The tank chassis had a complex parallelogram suspension system with two pairs of road bogie wheels per leaf spring arrangement. Hara later designed a bell crank scissors suspension which paired the bogie wheels and connected them to <b>a</b> <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> mounted horizontally outside the hull. This suspension became standard on the majority of the subsequently designed Japanese tanks and can be seen on the Type 95 Ha-Go light tank and Type 97 Chi-Ha, as examples.|$|E
500|$|The Rheinmetall 120mm gun is a smoothbore {{tank gun}} {{designed}} and {{produced by the}} West German Rheinmetall-DeTec AG company, developed in response to Soviet advances in armor technology and development of new armored threats. Production began in 1974, with {{the first version of}} the gun, known as the L/44 as it was 44 calibers long, used on the German Leopard 2 tank and soon produced under license for the American M1A1 Abrams and other tanks. The American version, the M256, uses <b>a</b> <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> recoil system instead of a hydraulic system. The [...] gun has a length of , and the gun system weighs approximately [...]|$|E
2500|$|In 1912, Harley-Davidson {{introduced}} their patented [...] "Ful-Floteing Seat", {{which was}} suspended by <b>a</b> <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> inside the seat tube.

2500|$|The Skyboy has a {{distinctive}} main landing gear, {{consisting of a}} trailing idler link, with suspension consisting of <b>a</b> <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> mounted over a shock absorber. The company describes the main landing gear: [...] "one of the best landing gears in the market (makes bad landings look good)".|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, IBM {{made their}} own keyboards, using their own {{patented}} technology: Keys on older IBM keyboards were made with a [...] "buckling spring" [...] mechanism, in which <b>a</b> <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> under the key buckles {{under pressure from the}} user's finger, triggering a hammer that presses two plastic sheets (membranes) with conductive traces together, completing a circuit. This produces a clicking sound and gives physical feedback for the typist, indicating that the key has been depressed.|$|E
2500|$|Hooke {{recorded}} that he {{conceived of}} a way to determine longitude (then a critical problem for navigation), {{and with the help of}} Boyle and others he attempted to patent it. [...] In the process, Hooke demonstrated a pocket-watch of his own devising, fitted with <b>a</b> <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> attached to the arbour of the balance. [...] Hooke's ultimate failure to secure sufficiently lucrative terms for the exploitation of this idea resulted in its being shelved, and evidently caused him to become more jealous of his inventions.|$|E

2500|$|Gravity feed saws {{fall under}} their own weight. [...] Most such saws have a method to allow the cutting force to be adjusted, such as a movable {{counterbalancing}} weight, <b>a</b> <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> with a screw-thread adjustment, or a hydraulic or pneumatic damper (speed control valve). The latter does not force the blade downwards, but rather simply limits {{the speed at which}} the saw can fall, preventing excessive feed on thin or soft parts. This is analogous to door closer hardware whose dampering action keeps the door from slamming. Gravity feed designs are common in small saws.|$|E
2500|$|The V20 Camry {{originated}} {{from a time}} at Toyota when considerable cost and attention to detail was engineered into its cars such as high-quality materials and build quality to transcend the competition. Sedans retained the V10's rear quarter glass; however, the styling is less angular than before. To appease export customers, styling {{lost some of its}} Japanese legacy in its transition to a more Americanized design, with a softer and sleeker silhouette. Toyota designed the body with aerodynamics in mind, with performance of [...] for the sedan. V20 also features headlamps and a grille that are sculptured into a gently curved hood that partially conceal the windscreen wipers, wind splitters up the ends of the windscreen, near-flush glass, and a third door seal to close the gap between the body and window frames. Body dimensions were largely unchanged from the previous model, including an identical wheelbase, although length increases [...] Basic sub-skin hardware is also closely related, including the platform and the fully independent suspension with a strut and <b>a</b> <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> at each corner and an anti-roll bar at each end. Noise isolation is improved by mounting the rear suspension on a subframe akin to the Toyota Celica (T160) that had now switched to Camry-based mechanicals. As before, the braking package encompasses ventilated discs up front, conventional drums in the rear, upgraded to rear discs in some cars. The braking system has a tandem-type booster and diagonally divided hydraulic circuits. Wagons receive a load-sensing proportioning valve that grants greater braking pressure when laden and prevents wheel lockup under light payloads. Entry-level V20 wheel size increases from 13 to 14inches.|$|E

40|$|The <b>spring</b> {{rates of}} <b>a</b> <b>coiled</b> helical <b>spring</b> under <b>an</b> axial force and an axially {{directed}} torque are derived by a consistent application of Castiglianoâ€™s second theorem, {{and it is}} shown that the coupling between the two loads {{may not always be}} neglected.
