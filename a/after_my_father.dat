500|$|Chopra found Mary Kom a {{very special}} and {{personal}} film due to the inspiring theme. She revealed that she channelled the grief of father's death into the film: [...] "I started this film at the hardest point in my life, four days <b>after</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> passed away. All my grief, everything, I have shoved into this movie. A part of my soul has gone into it." [...] In an interview with Daily News and Analysis, Chopra revealed that since she could not look like her, she {{did not try to}} imitate Kom as her main focus was to represent Kom's spirit and personality. In July 2013, Chopra visited Kom's home town of Manipur to learn more about her life. As part of her research, Chopra stayed with Kom and her family for three to four days, and went to her boxing academy and church to learn more about her. Kom stated, [...] "When she came to Manipur, she knew about boxing so I gave her tips as a mother and a wife, how I went about managing my home and profession, how I live with my family– basically she got to know aspects of my family life." ...|$|E

2500|$|Our {{street was}} called Carr Street <b>after</b> <b>my</b> <b>Father.</b> We {{had a very}} nice house and a lovely garden... Carr Street was a very fine street. The dirt road waved {{up and down and}} in and out. the horses made it that way, zigzagging the carts and {{carriages}} through it. The rest of the street was green grass and wild roses. [...] In front of our place Father had made a gravel walk but after our trees stopped there were just two planks to walk on.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, but it man {{be that he}} had {{an equally}} {{accurate}} knowledge of the state of <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> health.

2500|$|I am Mesha, son of Chemosh-gad, king of Moab, the Dibonite. My father reigned over Moab thirty years, and I have reigned <b>after</b> <b>my</b> <b>father.</b> And I {{have built}} this {{sanctuary}} for Chemosh in Karchah, a sanctuary of salvation, for he saved me from all aggressors, {{and made me}} look upon all mine enemies with contempt. Omri was king of Israel, and oppressed Moab during many days, and Chemosh was angry with his aggressions. His son succeeded him, and he also said, I will oppress Moab. In my days he said, Let us go, and I will see my desire upon him and his house, and Israel said, I shall destroy it for ever. Now Omri took the land of Madeba, and occupied it in his day, and {{in the days of}} his son, forty years. And Chemosh had mercy on it in my time. And I built Baal-meon and made therein the ditch, and I built Kiriathaim. And the men of Gad dwelled in the country of Ataroth from ancient times, and the king of Israel fortified Ataroth. I assaulted the wall and captured it, and killed all the warriors of the city for the well-pleasing of Chemosh and Moab, and I removed from it all the spoil, and offered it before Chemosh in Kirjath; and I placed therein the men of Siran, and the men of Mochrath. And Chemosh said to me, Go take Nebo against Israel, and I went in the night and I fought against it from the break of day till noon, and I took it: and I killed in all seven thousand men, but I did not kill the women and maidens, for I devoted them to Ashtar-Chemosh; and I took from it the vessels of Jehovah, and offered them before Chemosh. And the king of Israel fortified Jahaz, and occupied it, when he made war against me, and Chemosh drove him out before me, and I took from Moab two hundred men in all, and placed them in Jahaz, and took it to annex it to Dibon. I built Karchah the wall of the forest, and the wall of the Hill. I have built its gates and I have built its towers. I have built the palace of the king, and I made the prisons for the criminals within the wall. And there were no wells in the interior of the wall in Karchah. And I said to all the people, ‘Make you every man a well in his house.’ And I dug the ditch for Karchah with the chosen men of Israel. I built Aroer, and I made the road across the Arnon. I took Beth-Bamoth for it was destroyed. I built Bezer for it was cut down by the armed men of Daybon, for all Daybon was now loyal; and I reigned from Bikran, which I added to my land. And I built Beth-Gamul, and Beth-Diblathaim, and Beth Baal-Meon, and I placed there the poor people of the land. And as to Horonaim, the men of Edom dwelt therein, on the descent from old. And Chemosh said to me, Go down, make war against Horonaim, and take it. And I assaulted it, And I took it, for Chemosh restored it in my days. Wherefore I made......year...and I....|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes; I {{have been}} brought up, I may say, in the Scottish regiment, and <b>after</b> <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> death the {{officers}} and men were all very kind to me, and I learnt my drill both as a soldier and an officer, to fence, use my pistols, and ride.

5000|$|... my mother's need to fill {{space with}} daily-life objects {{resulted}} from a need to fill the emptiness <b>after</b> <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> death.
