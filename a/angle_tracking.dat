5000|$|It is {{possible}} to jam a lobe switching radar with relative ease if one knows the basic operating frequencies of the radar. In {{the case of a}} lobe switching set that switches lobes 30 times a second, a jammer can be constructed to send out a weak signal on the same frequency that also varies 30 times a second, but only sends out a signal when the radar's lobe is pointed away from the aircraft [...] - [...] which is easily found by looking for a low point in the received signal. At the receiver end the two signals are mixed, and the additional signal from the aircraft's jammer [...] "smooths out" [...] the strong/weak signal that would otherwise be seen.

50|$|A solar {{tracking}} system tilts a solar panel throughout the day. Depending {{on the type}} of {{tracking system}}, the panel is either aimed directly at the sun or the brightest area of a partly clouded sky. Trackers greatly enhance early morning and late afternoon performance, increasing the total amount of power produced by a system by about 20-25% for a single axis tracker and about 30% or more for a dual axis tracker, depending on latitude.Trackers are effective in regions that receive a large portion of sunlight directly. In diffuse light (i.e. under cloud or fog), tracking has little or no value. Because most concentrated photovoltaics systems are very sensitive to the sunlight's <b>angle,</b> <b>tracking</b> systems allow them to produce useful power for more than a brief period each day. Tracking systems improve performance for two main reasons. First, when a solar panel is perpendicular to the sunlight, it receives more light on its surface than if it were angled. Second, direct light is used more efficiently than angled light. Special Anti-reflective coatings can improve solar panel efficiency for direct and angled light, somewhat reducing the benefit of tracking.|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} of {{approach and landing}} longitudinal flying qualities, based on data generated using a variable stability NT- 33 aircraft combined with significant control system dynamics is described. An optimum pilot lead time for pitch tracking, flight path <b>angle</b> <b>tracking,</b> and combined pitch and flight path <b>angle</b> <b>tracking</b> tasks is determined from a closed loop simulation using integral squared error (ISE) as a performance measure. Pilot gain and lead time were varied in the closed loop simulation of the pilot and aircraft to obtain the best performance for different control system configurations. The results lead to the selection of an optimum lead time using ISE as a performance criterion. Using this value of optimum lead time, a correlation is then found between pilot rating and performance with changes in the control system and in the aircraft dynamics. It is also shown that pilot rating {{is closely related to}} pilot workload which, in turn, is related to the amount of lead which the pilot must generate to obtain satisfactory response. The results also indicate that the pilot may use pitch <b>angle</b> <b>tracking</b> for the approach task and then add flight path <b>angle</b> <b>tracking</b> for the flare and touchdown...|$|E

40|$|Because of {{hydrodynamic}} model error {{of the present}} dynamic model, there is a challenge in controller design for the underwater snake-like robot. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes an adaptive control schemes based on dynamic model for a planar, underwater snake-like robot with model error and time-varying noise. The adaptive control schemes aim to achieve the adaptive control of joint <b>angles</b> <b>tracking</b> and the direction of locomotion control. First, through approximation and reducibility using Taylor expansion method, a simplified dynamics model of a planar amphibious snake-like robot is derived. Then, the L 1 adaptive controller based on piecewise constant adaptive law is applied on the simplified planar, underwater snake-like robot, which can deal with both matched and unmatched nonlinear uncertainties. Finally, to control the direction of locomotion, an auxiliary bias signal is used as the control input to regulate the locomotion direction. Simulation results show that this L 1 adaptive controller is valid to deal with different uncertainties and achieve the joint <b>angles</b> <b>tracking</b> and fast adaptive at the same time. The modified L 1 adaptive controller, in which the auxiliary bias item is added, {{has the ability to}} change the direction of locomotion, that is, the orientation angle is periodic with arbitrarily given constant on average...|$|R

40|$|A {{prototype}} particle tracking telescope {{has been}} constructed using Timepix and Medipix ASIC hybrid pixel assemblies as the six sensing planes. Each telescope plane consisted of one 1. 4 cm 2 assembly, providing a 256 x 256 array of 55 micron square pixels. The telescope achieved a pointing resolution of 2. 3 micron {{at the position}} of the device under test. During a beam test in 2009 the telescope was used to evaluate in detail the performance of two Timepix hybrid pixel assemblies; a standard planar 300 micron thick sensor, and 285 micron thick double sided 3 D sensor. This paper describes a detailed charge calibration study of the pixel devices, which allows the true charge to be extracted, and reports on measurements of the charge collection characteristics and Landau distributions. The planar sensor achieved a best resolution of 4. 0 micron for <b>angled</b> <b>tracks,</b> and resolutions of between 4. 4 and 11 micron for perpendicular tracks, depending on the applied bias voltage. The double sided 3 D sensor, which has significantly less charge sharing, was found to have an optimal resolution of 9. 0 micron for <b>angled</b> <b>tracks,</b> and a resolution of 16. 0 micron for perpendicular tracks. Based on these studies it is concluded that the Timepix ASIC shows an excellent performance when used as a device for charged particle tracking. Comment: 51 pages, 39 figures. Submitted to Nucl.
