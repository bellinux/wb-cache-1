2500|$|The {{residential}} {{tower was}} to be 42½ storeys tall consisting of one and two bedroom apartments with penthouse suites on the upper floors. It will be [...] tall, becoming the second tallest building in the city, behind the BT Tower, and the tallest residential tower in the city. The tower is slender and the curvature of the façade will respond to the changing effects of daylight. It will be covered in <b>anodised</b> <b>aluminium</b> panels, glass and polished concrete. The <b>anodised</b> <b>aluminium</b> sills will project [...] from the building. The service area will be concealed by fritted glass spandrel panels, which will also accommodate the extract vents. The columns will rise from a polished concrete base on the ground floor. The top two floors will be surrounded by a light-weight perforated metal screen. There will be a total of 332 apartments in the tower, 10% of which shall be designed to be wheelchair accessible. There will be a single central core containing lifts and stairs. The apartments will be sold on 125 year leases.|$|E

The pores are uniformly distributed and their structure can be controlled by varying the anodising parameters. In this study, the pore structure of the anodic alumina films is varied systematically by varying the anodising time and a subsequent pore widening chemical etch.

40|$|Implementation {{of silicon}} nitride into the {{fabrication}} process of commercial silicon solar cells {{was a significant}} development leading to a large performance improvement. A key reason for the commercialization of silicon nitride is its multifunction applications, since it provides both surface passivation and anti-reflection coating. Anodic aluminium oxide (AAO) has several properties which potentially provide multifunctional applications, especially for the solar cell rear design. These properties can be easily adjusted by varying the type and concentration of the electrolyte, and the anodisation voltage. Implementation of AAO layers in the rear surface design improves both the surface passivation {{and the formation of}} rear contacts. It is shown that when AAO layers are formed by <b>anodising</b> <b>aluminium</b> over an intervening dielectric layer of either silicon dioxide or silicon nitride on n-type silicon surfaces, the implied open circuit voltage (Voc) of wafers can be increased by up to 40 mV. This thesis also explored several methods for enabling cell metallisation through AAO layers. The first method utilises the pore structure of AAO film, the second facilitates metal contacting by laser doping through high concentrations of aluminium, while the third selectively <b>anodises</b> an <b>aluminium</b> layer by pre patterning the aluminium prior the anodisation. AAO can be simply adopted into different cell structures such as PERL cell, bifacial solar cell and back contact solar cell while providing improved performance and reduced fabrication cost...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{introduces}} {{a method to}} manipulate stored charge density and polarity in anodic aluminium oxide (AAO) for silicon solar cell passivation. The method {{involves the use of}} a pulse current source to <b>anodise</b> <b>aluminium</b> layers instead of the typically used constant current/voltage source, with the test structures experiencing positive and negative cycles periodically. By tuning the positive cycle percentage, it is demonstrated that the effective stored charge can be manipulated in a range from - 5. 2 × 1011 to 2. 5 × 1012 q/cm 2 when the AAO is formed over a thin silicon dioxide layer. Photoconductance decay measurements on symmetrical n-type test structures with ∼ 150 Ω/□ boron-diffused surfaces were used to estimate the recombination current density associated with the diffused surface (Jop+), which was then correlated to the stored charge. As the effective stored charge changed from positive towards negative values, the Jop+ was reduced from 210 fA/cm 2 to 100 fA/cm 2. The stored charge in various test structures was monitored constantly to study the stability. It was found that the positive stored charge deteriorated with time while the negative charge was relatively stable...|$|R

40|$|The {{corrosion}} {{properties of}} hydrothermally sealed <b>anodised</b> 2024 <b>aluminium</b> alloy specimens in tartaric-sulphuric acid (TSA) and sulphuric acid (SA) are investigated using electrochemical techniques. A new mechanism is proposed {{to describe the}} improvements observed for the sealed porous layer grown in the mixed electrolyte. This mechanism involves the dissociation of the residual organic acid present inside the pores {{as a consequence of}} the pH increase during hydrothermal sealing (HT). Tartrate ions form chelate complexes with Cu(II) cations embedded in the oxide film. This results in a decrease in the heterogeneity of the film and consequently, better protective properties. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Aluminium gets {{attacked}} by different media and several surface treatments {{are used for}} effectively reducing corrosion. Of these, the versatile method is <b>anodising</b> the <b>aluminium</b> surface, the others being chromating and phosphating. However, these treatments give only short-term protection.

This papers deals with a study of the comparative performance of coatings with different conversion coatings applied over aluminium.

40|$|Hard <b>anodising</b> on <b>aluminium</b> and its alloys {{has been}} widely practised {{for many years in}} order to improve the {{resistance}} of the otherwise poor wear characteristics of aluminium. In recent years there has been an increasing interest in other treatments and coatings, on both aluminium and other base metals. The aim of this investigation is to explain the tribological performance and wear mechanism(s) of an uncoated aluminium alloy, four anodic coated alloys, and also an electroless nickel alloy. All of the coatings are produced on three different aluminium alloys. The thickness of the anodic films is 30 - 35 micron, as this thickness falls within the range commonly used by industry. In an endeavour to explain the role of coating thickness on wear life, electroless nickel alloy has been produced in a range of thicknesses of 10, 20 and 30 micron.
