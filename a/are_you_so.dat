500|$|She's Mariah Carey. She's not beefin', she's a vegetarian. People {{keep saying}} [...] was {{directed}} at certain people. To be completely honest, she did the record 'cause she's {{a huge fan of}} this movie Mean Girls, and there's a line in the movie where one of the girls is like, 'Why <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>so</b> obsessed with me?' She says that {{at the beginning of the}} song, and that's where the concept came from. But, you know, art imitates life.|$|E
500|$|This slow-moving blues {{number is}} {{highlighted}} by Hargus [...] "Pig" [...] Robbins's [...] "dusky barrelhouse piano" [...] and Dylan's [...] "brief wheeze of harmonica". In the song, the narrator has been spurned by his lover, {{who has already}} taken up with her latest boyfriend. Referring to his rival as [...] "Achilles", the narrator senses the new suitor may end up being discarded {{as quickly as he}} was. The refrain that ends each of the main verses—"Honey, why <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>so</b> hard?"—is a double entendre Dylan had been wanting to work into a song.|$|E
500|$|After the song's release, critics heavily {{compared}} its {{lyrics to}} Eminem, and suggested Carey alluded {{to him and}} his 'obsession' with her. [...] "Obsessed" [...] never mentions the rapper's name, although reviewers felt it to be very obvious. The song begins with [...] "I was like, 'Why <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>so</b> obsessed with me?'", before the music begins. This line references the 2004 film Mean Girls. As the first verse begins, Carey describes the tracks' subjects constant lies: [...] "All up in the blogs sayin' we met at a bar / When I don't even, know who you are / Sayin' you up in my house sayin' you up in my car / When you in L.A. and I'm at Jermaine's". Additionally, the song suggests the stalker is under the influence of drugs: It must be the weed, it must be the E / 'Cause you be poppin', heard you get it poppin'." [...] During the chorus, Carey confronts her stalker, asking: Why <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>so</b> obsessed with me / Boy I wanna know / Lying that you're sexing me / When everybody knows/ It's clear that you're upset with me / Oh, Oh, Oh, finally found a girl that you couldn't impress / last man on the earth still couldn't get this." [...] During the song's second verse, critics complimented Carey's lyrics, highlighting phrases such as: You're a mom & pop, I'm a corporation / I'm the press conference, you're a conversation", [...] "suggesting the rapper isn't a worthy suitor".|$|E

500|$|Minh {{placed the}} blame on Thiệu, after the latter became President, for the assassinations. In 1971, Minh claimed that Thiệu was {{responsible}} for the deaths by hesitating and delaying the attack by his Fifth Division on Gia Long Palace. Đôn was reported to have pressured Thieu during the night, asking him on the phone [...] "Why <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>so</b> slow in doing it? Do you need more troops? If you do, ask Đính to send more troops– and do it quickly because after taking the palace you will be made a general." [...] Thiệu stridently denied responsibility and issued a statement which Minh did not publicly rebut: [...] "Dương Văn Minh has to assume entire responsibility for the death of Ngô Đình Diệm." ...|$|E
500|$|Herodotus recounts that Megabates made {{inspections}} {{of the ships}} (probably whilst beached for the night), and came across one ship from Myndus which had not posted any sentries. Megabates ordered his guard to find {{the captain of the}} ship, Scylax, and then had the captain thrust into one of the ship's oar holes with his head outside and his body inside the ship. News reached Aristagoras of the treatment of his friend and he went to Megabates and asked him to reconsider his decision. When Megabates refused to grant Aristagoras's wishes, Aristagoras simply cut the captain loose himself. Predictably, Megabates was furious with Aristagoras, who in turn retorted [...] "But you, what have you to do with these matters? Did not Artaphrenes send you to obey me and to sail wherever I bid you? Why <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>so</b> meddlesome?". According to Herodotus, Megabates was so enraged by this that he sent messengers to the Naxians to warn them of the approach of the Persian force.|$|E
500|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Brett Ratner, who had previously worked with Carey on six other music videos, and was shot from June 28 to 29, 2009. Throughout the video, Carey plays herself and a male stalker, dressed as both a bellhop and {{a man wearing a}} gray hoodie and sweatpants. Two videos were shot for [...] "Obsessed", one for the original version, and one for the remixed version, which features Gucci Mane. The video was shot predominantly at the Plaza Hotel, and on the streets of New York City. After several photographs of Carey dressed as the stalker were leaked, critics and bloggers immediately compared Carey's costume to Eminem's usual attire, and many wrote that aside from the goatee, the pair looked alike. Carey tweeted [...] "I am not at any point in the video playing a specific person. I'm dressed as a 'stalker' in 3 different ensembles." [...] Carey also revealed that the music video would reference several of her favorite films, such as Mean Girls (2004), with the line [...] "Why <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>so</b> obsessed with me?", as well as The Devil Wears Prada (2006).|$|E

500|$|The video {{begins with}} Carey at a photoshoot {{in a private}} room at the Plaza Hotel, {{speaking}} the line, [...] "And I was like, why <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>so</b> obsessed with me?" [...] Next, a Rolls-Royce Phantom is shown pulling up to the hotel, with Carey {{stepping out of the}} vehicle. As she gets out of the car, Carey dressed as a bellhop, assists her to the ramp where she is walking and greeting fans. The next scene finds Carey walking into the hotel, and waving to everyone, with the camera zooming to the bellhops face to reveal him intently staring at her. As the first verse begins, Carey is shown at the photo-shoot in the hotel, with a cameo by Patrick Demarchelier as the photographer. The bellhop, now dressed in a gray hoodie and sweatpants, is shown holding a hair-blower at Carey, apparently assisting with the shoot. As the shoot continues, scenes of the bellhop are shown in his room, where he has dolls of Carey on the wall, as well as quilts with the cover of her 2005 album, The Emancipation of Mimi.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} Beyoncé {{and her husband}} saying a few words, {{including}} [...] "intimacy", [...] "honesty", and [...] "commitment", and then saying the words [...] "you", [...] "me", and [...] "us" [...] together. When the action starts, Beyoncé is seen working as a police officer. Her husband (played by NFL player Eddie Goines) is very supportive. He makes her breakfast, spends time at work looking for a present for her and forgoes socializing with attractive coworkers so he can be available when his wife arrives home. However, Beyoncé is not thinking about him at all. Instead, she spends her free time with other officers, particularly her male partner, whom she seems enamored with. Her husband calls her, but she ignores the phone. Later, when her husband gives her earrings, she puts them on to go dancing with her partner at a party. Her husband is upset when he sees them, and when he confronts her about this, she acts like he is making {{a big deal out}} of nothing. [...] "When you act like that, I don't think you realize how it makes me look or feel", he tells her. Beyoncé then asks him in a condescending tone, [...] "Why <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>so</b> jealous? It's not like I'm sleeping with the guy." [...] Then the story reverses, and Beyoncé starts to cry. Her husband's situation is actually her experience—he is a police officer who takes his supportive wife for granted.|$|E
500|$|Fellini was {{a notorious}} perfectionist, {{and this could}} be trying for his cast. At an American Film Institute student seminar, Quinn spoke of Fellini's intransigence over {{selecting}} a box in which Zampanò carries his cigarette butts, scrutinizing over 500 boxes before finding just the right one: [...] "As for me, any of the boxes would have been satisfactory to carry the butts in, but not Federico". Quinn also recalled being particularly proud of a certain scene in which his performance had earned applause from onlookers on the set, only to receive {{a phone call from}} Fellini late that night informing him {{that they would have to}} re-do the entire sequence because Quinn had been too good: [...] "You see, you're supposed to be a bad, a terrible actor, but the people watching applauded you. They should have laughed at you. So in the morning we do it again." [...] As for Masina, Fellini insisted that she re-create the thin-lipped smile he had seen in her childhood photographs. He cut her hair by putting a bowl on her head and shearing off anything that wasn't covered up, afterwards plastering what remained with soap to give it a [...] "spiky, untidy look", then [...] "flicked talc into her face to give it the pallor of a kabuki performer." [...] He made her wear a World War I surplus cloak that was so frayed its collar cut into her neck. She complained: [...] "You're so nice and sweet to the others in the cast. Why <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>so</b> hard on me?" ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{answer to}} this lies in a player's {{position}} on the board.

2500|$|The Scholls and Probst were {{scheduled}} to stand trial before the Volksgerichtshof— the Nazi [...] "People's Court" [...] infamous for its unfair political trials, which {{more often than not}} ended with a death sentence — on 22 February 1943. They were found guilty of treason. Roland Freisler, head judge of the court, sentenced them to death. The three were executed the same day by guillotine at Stadelheim Prison. All three were noted for the courage with which they faced their deaths, particularly Sophie, who remained firm despite intense interrogation, and intimidation by Freisler during the trial. She replied: [...] "You know as well as we do that the war is lost. Why <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>so</b> cowardly that you won't admit it?" [...] Immediately before Hans was executed, he cried out [...] "Es lebe die Freiheit! - Long live freedom!", as the blade fell.|$|E
