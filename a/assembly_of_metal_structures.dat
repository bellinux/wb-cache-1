40|$|This {{dissertation}} describes (1) size-dependent electrochemical oxidation/stripping of {{gold and}} silver nanoparticles (NPs), (2) alloying of copper with gold nanoparticles at underpotential deposition potentials, (3) electrochemical characterization of Au/Ag core-shell <b>structures,</b> (4) characterization <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> nanoparticle alloys by stripping voltammetry, and (5) layer-by-layer <b>assembly</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> nanoparticle/polymer <b>structures.</b> The motivation of this work is to better understand fundamental properties <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> nanostructures {{as a function of}} size, shape, and composition. We synthesized Au and Ag NPs with different size by electrochemical reduction <b>of</b> the <b>metal</b> salt directly on the electrode surface and by seed-mediated growth in solution followed by chemisorption on a silane functionalized electrode surface, respectively. Linear sweep voltammetry results demonstrated a negative shift in peak potential for oxidation with decrease in size. For Ag NPs, the oxidation potential is 275 mV and 382 mV for 8 and 50 nm particles, respectively. In the case of Au NPs, the peak potentials are 734 and 913 mV for 4 and 250 nm particles, respectively. This shift in oxidation potential with change in size <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> nanoparticles is consistent with Plieth theory. Underpotential deposition of copper on Au NPs of different size led to alloying of Au and Cu. Several peaks were observed on linear sweep voltammograms. We assigned these peaks to different copper locations in the alloy structure: (1) Cu UPD on the surface of Au NP, (2) outer-shell Cu-Au alloy, and (3) core of Cu-Au NP alloy. Au/Ag core-shell nanostructures were synthesized by seed-mediated growth directly on the electrode surface and characterized with electrochemical techniques. During electrochemical characterization, dealloying of Au from Au/Ag alloy structures occurred by cycling in bromide containing electrolyte solution. Composition analysis based on LSV showed that less than 3...|$|R
40|$|The {{lubrication}} {{process of}} mechanical equipment and treatment <b>of</b> <b>assembly</b> <b>metals</b> <b>structures</b> using fluids with efficient rheological properties requires {{a knowledge of}} their behavior in the presence {{and in the absence}} of organic impurities. The intrinsic physical property of the lubricating fluids has a dependency to the mechanical and physicochemical environment. This paper is focused on the assessment of the behavior of SAE 20 W 40 multigrade oil under normal temperature and pressure, through the addition of water in vapor phase and solid paraffin. Results show that there is a decrease in the dynamic and kinematic viscosity for heterogeneous oils. The rate of degradation is greater in the mixture of water with oil. The addition of paraffin in the mixture caused an increase in viscosity. However, after certain RPM points, it is noted that the data curve became similar to the first mixture. This relaxation phenomenon is caused by the turbulence created by the rotating cylinder in oil. The use of a retentate paraffin shows that the added agent has acted as a surfactan...|$|R
