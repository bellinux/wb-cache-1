5|$|The Perm {{authorities}} distributed a concocted {{cover story}} that Michael was abducted by unidentified men and had disappeared. Chelyshev and Borunov were arrested. Shortly before his own arrest, Colonel Peter Znamerovsky, a former Imperial army officer also exiled to Perm, managed to send Natalia a brief telegram saying that Michael had disappeared. Znamerovsky, Chelyshev and Borunov were all {{killed by the}} Perm Bolsheviks. Soviet disinformation about Michael's disappearance led to unfounded rumours that he had escaped and was leading a successful counter-revolution. In the ultimately forlorn hope that Michael would ally with Germany, the Germans arranged for Natalia <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>daughter</b> to escape to Kiev in German-controlled Ukraine. On {{the collapse of the}} Germans in November 1918, Natalia fled to the coast, and she <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>daughter</b> were evacuated by the British Royal Navy.|$|E

5|$|After Williams' death, Audrey Williams filed a suit in Nashville against MGM Records and Acuff-Rose. The suit {{demanded that}} both of the {{publishing}} companies continue to pay her half of the royalties from Hank Williams' records. Williams had an agreement giving his first wife half of the royalties, but allegedly there was no clarification that the deal was valid after his death. Because Williams may have left no will, the disposition of the other fifty percent was considered uncertain; those involved included the second Mrs. Williams <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>daughter</b> and Hank Williams' mother and sister.|$|E

5|$|After {{her husband}} died in 1841, a series of {{complications}} obstructed Hańska's marriage to Balzac. Chief of these was the estate <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>daughter</b> Anna's inheritance, both of which might be threatened if she married him. Anna married a Polish count, easing some of the pressure. About the same time, Hańska gave Balzac the idea for his 1844 novel Modeste Mignon. In 1850 they finally married, and moved to Paris, but he died five months later. Though she never remarried, she took several lovers, and died in 1882.|$|E

One day, when Flik, an individualist and would-be inventor, inadvertently knocks the offering into a stream with his latest invention, a grain harvesting device, Hopper demands twice as much food as compensation. When Flik suggests in earnest that they seek help from other stronger bugs, the other ants see it as an opportunity to remove him and send him off.|$|E
5|$|As King William {{intensely}} {{disliked the}} Duchess and Conroy, {{he vowed to}} wait until Victoria came of age to die simply {{to keep them from}} a regency. In 1831, the year of William's coronation, Conroy and the Duchess embarked on a series of royal tours with Victoria to expose her to the people and solidify their status as potential regents. On one trip Conroy was awarded an honorary degree by the University of Oxford. Their efforts were ultimately successful and, in November 1831, it was declared that the Duchess would be sole regent in the event of Victoria's young queenship, while Conroy could claim to be the closest adviser to the Duchess <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>daughter.</b>|$|E
