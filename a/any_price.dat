5|$|Even {{prior to}} the cost {{increases}} which plagued the design and construction of the tram, the project has been subject to criticism from the public. Many residents in the neighborhoods under the tram's route object to the tram's presence. The cost increases themselves, and the perceived machinations of public officials, have been controversial. Some consider the project an unworthy use of public funds at <b>any</b> <b>price,</b> either {{due to a lack}} of benefit for those not associated with OHSU, or due to opposition to such projects in general.|$|E
5|$|Turner's {{painting}} achieved widespread critical acclaim, and accolades {{from the}} likes of John Ruskin and William Makepeace Thackeray. It was Turner's particular favourite; he only lent it once and refused to ever do so again. He also refused to sell it at <b>any</b> <b>price,</b> and on his death bequeathed it to the nation. It hangs today in the National Gallery, and in 2005 it was voted the nation's favourite painting in a poll organized by BBC Radio 4's Today programme.|$|E
5|$|By {{this stage}} McCudden was {{suffering}} from combat fatigue. It manifested itself in his decisions, of late, to seek a victory at <b>any</b> <b>price,</b> which was alien to his normal, calculated approach to combat. Knowing he was to soon be sent home, he was obsessed with catching up to von Richthofen's score. His contribution to 56 Squadron at this time was impressive; the unit had claimed 175 enemy aircraft while reporting 14 pilots killed and missing and seven captured. As Flight Commander, B Flight, McCudden's pilots had shot down 77–52 of which were his—while losing four pilots. To celebrate his success he dined with Brigadier General John Higgins and the following evening was invited to the headquarters of General Julian Byng, General Officer Commanding the British Third Army, to be personally congratulated.|$|E
