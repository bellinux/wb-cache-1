40|$|Abstract: In the {{environment}} of supply chain, the market price of the poultry <b>and</b> <b>eggs</b> is greatly affects by different chains which increase the forecasting complexity. This paper focuses on the poultry <b>and</b> <b>eggs</b> market price forecasting methods {{in order to increase}} the predication accuracy. A market price forecasting expert system for the poultry <b>and</b> <b>eggs</b> based on neural network is proposed in this paper to build the market data system of the poultry <b>and</b> <b>eggs</b> in the supply chain. According to the neural network estimation model based on the data, the poultry <b>and</b> <b>eggs</b> market price can be accurately predicted. The experiment illustrates the improved algorithm can predicate the poultry <b>and</b> <b>eggs</b> market price in the supply chain, which can increase the accuracy and meet the practical demands in poultry <b>and</b> <b>eggs</b> market. ...|$|R

5|$|A pisco sour is an {{alcoholic}} cocktail of Peruvian origin that {{is typical of}} the cuisines from Chile and Peru, considered also a South American classic. The drink's name comes from pisco, which is its base liquor, and the cocktail term sour, in reference to sour citrus juice and sweetener components. The Peruvian pisco sour uses Peruvian pisco as the base liquor and adds freshly squeezed lime juice, syrup, ice, egg white, and Angostura bitters. The Chilean version is similar, but uses Chilean pisco and pica lime, and excludes the bitters <b>and</b> <b>egg</b> white. Other variants of the cocktail include those created with fruits like pineapple or plants such as coca leaves.|$|E
5|$|Black mambas breed {{annually}} and mating {{occurs in the}} early spring, when male mambas locate a female by following her scent trail. After finding a potential mate the male will inspect the female by flicking his tongue over her entire body. As in other species of snakes and many other reptiles, fertilization is internal and the intromittent organs of the males are {{in the form of}} hemipenes. Females lay clutches of eggs with an incubation period of some 80 to 90 days. Like most snakes female mambas are both oviparous and iteroparous. Egg-laying typically occurs during the middle of summer <b>and</b> <b>egg</b> clutches range from 6 to 17 eggs.|$|E

5|$|Currently 1,500,000 (2% of all U.S children) are adopted. There are {{different}} types of adoption; embryo adoption when a couple is having trouble conceiving a child and instead choose to have their sperm <b>and</b> <b>egg</b> conjoined outside the womb, international adoption where couples adopt children that come from foreign countries, and private adoption {{which is the most}} common form of adoption. In private adoption, families can adopt children via licensed agencies or with by directly contacting the child's biological parents.|$|E
5|$|Homologous {{recombination}} {{is a type}} {{of genetic}} recombination in which nucleotide sequences are exchanged between two similar or identical molecules of DNA. It is most widely used by cells to accurately repair harmful breaks that occur on both strands of DNA, known as double-strand breaks. Homologous recombination also produces new combinations of DNA sequences during meiosis, the process by which eukaryotes make gamete cells, like sperm <b>and</b> <b>egg</b> cells in animals. These new combinations of DNA represent genetic variation in offspring, which in turn enables populations to adapt during the course of evolution. Homologous recombination is also used in horizontal gene transfer to exchange genetic material between different strains and species of bacteria and viruses.|$|E
5|$|Regarding A Song of Ice and Fire as his magnum opus, Martin {{is certain}} never to write {{anything}} {{on this scale}} again and would only return to this fictional universe {{in the context of}} stand-alone novels. He prefers to write stories about characters from other Ice and Fire periods of history such as his Tales of Dunk <b>and</b> <b>Egg</b> project, instead of continuing the series directly. A possible future side project is a prequel set during Aegon's conquest of Westeros. Martin said he would love to return to writing short stories, novellas, novelettes, and stand-alone novels from diverse genres such as science fiction, horror, fantasy, or even a murder mystery. However, he will see if his audience follows him after publishing his next project.|$|E

5|$|The Jesuits left an {{extension}} of the epistle transept used as living quarters. In 1872, it was expanded to become a proper convento under Father Cabañas. The convento is a typical bahay-na-bato with its first floor made out of coral stones <b>and</b> <b>egg</b> white mixed with plaster as binder and the second floor made out of light materials like bamboo. The convent which serves as the priest's house, it is much used as the church's ecclesiastical museum.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} that enzymes could be crystallized eventually allowed their structures {{to be solved}} by x-ray crystallography. This was first done for lysozyme, an enzyme found in tears, saliva <b>and</b> <b>egg</b> whites that digests the coating of some bacteria; the structure was solved by a group led by David Chilton Phillips and published in 1965. This high-resolution structure of lysozyme {{marked the beginning of}} the field of structural biology and the effort to understand how enzymes work at an atomic level of detail.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{preparation}} of pisco-based mixed beverages possibly {{dates back to the}} 1700s, historians and drink experts agree that the cocktail as it is known today was invented in the early 1920s in Lima, the capital of Peru, by the American bartender Victor Vaughen Morris. Morris left the United States in 1903 to work in Cerro de Pasco, a city in central Peru. In 1916, he opened Morris' Bar in Lima, and his saloon quickly became a popular spot for the Peruvian upper class and English-speaking foreigners. The pisco sour underwent several changes until Mario Bruiget, a Peruvian bartender working at Morris' Bar, created the modern Peruvian recipe of the cocktail {{in the latter part of}} the 1920s by adding Angostura bitters <b>and</b> <b>egg</b> whites to the mix.|$|E

In France, marrows (courge) are traditionally {{served as a}} gratin, sieved and cooked with butter, milk, <b>and</b> <b>egg,</b> and flavored with salt, pepper, and nutmeg, and as soups. In Italy, zucchini and larger squashes are served {{in a variety of}} regional dishes, such as cocuzze alla puviredda cooked with olive oil, salt and herbs from Puglia; as torta di zucca from Liguria, or torta di zucca e riso from Emilia-Romagna, the squashes being made into a pie filling with butter, ricotta, parmesan, egg, and milk; and as a sauce for pasta in dishes like spaghetti alle zucchine from Sicily. In Japan, squashes such as small C. moschata pumpkins (kabocha) are eaten boiled with sesame sauce, fried as a tempura dish, or made into balls with sweet potato and Japanese mountain yam.|$|E
5|$|Like dry ice, {{the main}} use of liquid {{nitrogen}} is as a refrigerant. Among other things, {{it is used}} in the cryopreservation of blood, reproductive cells (sperm <b>and</b> <b>egg),</b> and other biological samples and materials. It {{is used in the}} clinical setting in cryotherapy to remove cysts and warts on the skin. It is used in cold traps for certain laboratory equipment and to cool infrared detectors or X-ray detectors. It has also been used to cool central processing units and other devices in computers that are overclocked, and that produce more heat than during normal operation. Other uses include freeze-grinding and machining materials that are soft or rubbery at room temperature, shrink-fitting and assembling engineering components, and more generally to attain very low temperatures whenever necessary (around −200°C). Because of its low cost, liquid nitrogen is also often used when such low temperatures are not strictly necessary, such as refrigeration of food, freeze-branding livestock, freezing pipes to halt flow when valves are not present, and consolidating unstable soil by freezing whenever excavation is going on underneath.|$|E
5|$|Poultry, {{kept for}} their eggs {{and for their}} meat, include chickens, turkeys, geese and ducks. The great {{majority}} of laying birds used for egg production are chickens. Methods for keeping layers range from free-range systems, where the birds can roam as they will but are housed at night for their own protection, through semi-intensive systems where they are housed in barns and have perches, litter and some freedom of movement, to intensive systems where they are kept in cages. The battery cages are arranged in long rows in multiple tiers, with external feeders, drinkers, <b>and</b> <b>egg</b> collection facilities. This is the most labour saving and economical method of egg production but has been criticised on animal welfare grounds as the birds are unable to exhibit their normal behaviours.|$|E
