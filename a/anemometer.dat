5|$|On 26January 2010, nearly 14years later, the World Meteorological Organization {{announced}} that the wind gust was the highest recorded worldwide. This gust surpassed the previous non-tornadic wind speed of 372km/h (231mph) on Mount Washington in the United States in April 1934. The long delay was {{partly due to the}} <b>anemometer</b> not being owned by the BoM, and as a result the agency did not enact a follow-up investigation. Despite the high winds, the <b>anemometer</b> and a nearby building were not damaged due to the winds occurring over a very short time.|$|E
5|$|From February 1922 the airfield, {{which was}} in use as an {{emergency}} landing ground, had an illuminated T {{as part of the}} illumination of the London-Paris airway. Also at the airfield were coloured lamps connected to an <b>anemometer</b> to indicate wind strength, green for no wind, white for moderate wind and red to indicate strong wind.|$|E
5|$|By a {{day after}} the storm made landfall, the record power outages were largely restored. However, salt damage {{prevented}} restoration in some areas for several days. The outages left residents temporarily without water after water pumps were shut down. In Hiroshima, lack of power caused traffic congestion, shut down banks, and disrupted hospitals. The widespread power outages related to Mireille prompted the government to reconstruct transmission towers with <b>anemometer,</b> or wind measurement devices. Following the storm, insurance companies paid $6billion to policy holders in Japan, which was a world record related to wind damage; this was surpassed {{less than a year later}} by Hurricane Andrew striking Florida. The typhoon still holds the title as the costliest non-Atlantic hurricane.|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} is conducted concerning the problems {{involved in the}} conduction of wind measurements on the planet Mars, {{taking into account the}} currently known characteristics of the Martian atmosphere.

40|$|Cup <b>anemometers</b> are {{frequently}} {{employed in the}} wind power industry for wind resource assessment at prospective wind farm sites. In this paper, we demonstrate a method for identifying faulty three cup <b>anemometers.</b> This method is applicable to cases where data is available from two or more <b>anemometers</b> at equal height and cases where data is available from <b>anemometers</b> at different heights. It is based on examining the Weibull parameters of the distribution generated from {{the difference between the}} <b>anemometerâ€™s</b> reported measurements and utilizing a discriminant function technique to separate out the data corresponding to bad cup <b>anemometers.</b> For <b>anemometers</b> at different heights, only data from the same height pair combinations are compared. In addition, various preprocessing techniques are discussed to improve performance of the algorithm. These include removing data that corresponds to poor wind directions for comparing the <b>anemometers</b> and removing data that corresponds to frozen <b>anemometers.</b> These methods are employed on the data from the PHM 2011 Data Competition with results presented. 1...|$|R

5|$|In 1984, the NHC was {{separated}} from the Miami Weather Service Forecast Office, which meant the meteorologist in charge at Miami {{was no longer in}} a position above the hurricane center director. By 1988, the NHC gained responsibility for eastern Pacific tropical cyclones as the former Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center in San Francisco was decommissioned. In 1992, Hurricane Andrew blew the WSR-57 weather radar and the <b>anemometer</b> off the roof of NHC's/the Miami State Weather Forecast offices. The radar was replaced with a WSR-88D NEXRAD system in April 1993 installed near Metro Zoo, near where Hurricane Andrew made landfall.|$|E
5|$|In northwestern Madagascar, Josie dropped heavy {{rainfall}} and caused widespread flooding. Several towns were isolated, forcing residents to travel by boat. The storm heavily damaged crops in the region, particularly to vanilla. The rains caused rivers to exceed their banks, resulting in flooding up to 3.6m (12ft) deep. Nationwide, at least 36people were killed due to Josie, {{although there were}} initial reports of 500people missing. On Europa Island, Josie produced maximum sustained winds of 130km/h (81mph), with gusts to , before blowing the <b>anemometer</b> away.|$|E
5|$|Around midday on September13, {{the storm}} {{strengthened}} into a Category5 hurricane, {{based on the}} <b>anemometer</b> at San Juan observing sustained winds of 160mph (268km/h). The hurricane peaked with sustained winds at the intensity. About six hours later, the system made landfall in Puerto Rico; {{it was the only}} recorded tropical cyclone to strike the island as a Category5. Very strong winds resulted in severe damage in Puerto Rico. Throughout the island, 24,728homes were destroyed and 192,444were damaged, leaving over 500,000 people homeless. Heavy rainfall also led to extreme damage to vegetation and agriculture. On Puerto Rico alone, there were 312 deaths and about $50million in damage. After emerging into the Atlantic, the storm weakened slightly, falling to Category4 intensity. It began crossing through the Bahamas on September16. Many buildings and houses were damaged or destroyed, especially on Bimini, Eleuthera, New Providence, and San Salvador Island. Nineteen deaths were reported, eighteen from a sloop disappearing and one due to drowning.|$|E

5|$|Cebu {{was one of}} {{the worst}} {{impacted}} cities. At the local airport, an <b>anemometer</b> recorded sustained winds of 160km/h (100mph) early on December10, which remains a record for the city. Rainfall peaked at 195.3mm (7.69in); at the time this made the typhoon the wettest tropical cyclone in Cebu history. All buildings made of light construction materials were at least partially damaged, with many large structures sustaining roof or other damage. At least 29people were killed in the city, including the drownings of three due to the resultant flooding. The typhoon's effects caused the cessation of the city's power supply. Damage in Cebu totaled 560million Philippine pesos. At least a hundred other people in Cebu City were displaced. Offshore, 28ships capsized due to winds caused by Amy, including 7 inter-island vessels. This set a new record for vessels sunk by a typhoon in Cebu, and held until Typhoon Mike sunk 88ships in 1990.|$|E

5|$|VÃ¦rÃ¸y Airport {{was plagued}} by bad wind {{conditions}} and low regularity. The airport had {{the highest number of}} cancellations in the country, with 31 of 609 flights canceled in the first eleven months of operation. During some periods, regularity was as low as 50%. The navigational aids were moved in 1989 to increase safety, more runway lights were installed and an <b>anemometer</b> was installed on the mountain, costing NOK1 million. WiderÃ¸e introduced self-imposed restrictions on landing at VÃ¦rÃ¸y from 31 October 1988. Aircraft were not allowed to land or take off if the wind came from 090Â°â€“240Â° (though south) if the wind speed exceeded , including gusts. Additional restriction were introduced following an incident on 18 January 1989. These were again modified on 1 November 1989.|$|E

5|$|Wind {{direction}} is usually {{expressed in terms}} of the direction from which it originates. For example, a northerly wind blows from the north to the south. Weather vanes pivot to indicate the direction of the wind. At airports, windsocks indicate wind direction, and {{can also be used to}} estimate wind speed by the angle of hang. Wind speed is measured by anemometers, most commonly using rotating cups or propellers. When a high measurement frequency is needed (such as in research applications), wind can be measured by the propagation speed of ultrasound signals or by the effect of ventilation on the resistance of a heated wire. Another type of <b>anemometer</b> uses pitot tubes that take advantage of the pressure differential between an inner tube and an outer tube that is exposed to the wind to determine the dynamic pressure, which is then used to compute the wind speed.|$|E
5|$|The Mk 8 Rangekeeper was an {{electromechanical}} {{analog computer}} whose function was to continuously calculate the gun's bearing and elevation, Line-Of-Fire (LOF), {{to hit a}} future position of the target. It did this by automatically receiving information from the director (LOS), the FC Radar (range), the ship's gyrocompass (true ship's course), the ship's Pitometer log (ship's speed), the Stable Vertical (ship's roll and pitch), and the ship's <b>anemometer</b> (relative wind speed and direction). Also, before the surface action started, the FTs made manual inputs for the average initial velocity of the projectiles fired out of the battery's gun barrels, and air density. With all this information, the Rangekeeper calculated the relative motion between the ship and the target. It then could calculate an offset angle and change of range between the target's present position (LOS) and future position {{at the end of}} the projectile's time of flight. To this bearing and range offset, it added corrections for gravity, wind, Magnus effect of the spinning projectile, earth's curvature, and coriolis effect. The result was the turret's bearing and elevation orders (LOF). During the surface action, range and deflection Spots and target altitude (not zero during Gun Fire Support) were manually entered.|$|E
