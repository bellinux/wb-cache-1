25|$|A {{burglar alarm}} {{contains}} sensors which {{are connected to}} <b>a</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> via a low-voltage hardwire or narrowband RF signal {{which is used to}} interact with a response device. The alarm was patented (U.S. patent #9,802) on June 21, 1853, by the Reverend Augustus Russell Pope of Somerville, Massachusetts. As the first person to commercialize Pope's invention, Edwin Holmes acquired Pope's patent rights in 1857 for US$1,500.|$|E
25|$|Another {{conversion}} of the Fahd APC enables it to become a mine laying vehicle. The mine are of anti-tank type, where these vehicles are used as mobile systems with high maneuverability, {{and the ability to}} lay anti-tank mine fields in a short time. The mine laying system used on the Fahd is the Nather-2. The mine laying system is equipped with <b>a</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> that computes the tube firing sequence delay time to set mine densities, and adjusts the required dispensing direction. The mines can be dispensed on right, left and backwards of the vehicle.|$|E
25|$|Following these {{killings and}} other similar incidents, Norman Carlson, then {{director}} of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, argued that a more secure type of prison needed to be designed, where uncontrollable inmates could be isolated from correction officers and other prisoners {{for the sake of}} security and safety. The control unit at USP Marion became a model for the subsequent construction of ADX, a facility designed from the ground up as <b>a</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> prison. Years later, Carlson said he felt such a prison was needed to house inmates so desperate that they would commit murder (of another prisoner, or a guard) in the hopes of being sentenced to death.|$|E
40|$|The {{search for}} {{increasing}} productivity in agriculture has prompted many proposals for automatic and semi-automatic tractor guidance systems. This project involved {{the investigation and}} development of a master-slave tractor guidance system. The guidance system developed, which operated the slave tractor, was composed of <b>a</b> sterring <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> and <b>a</b> speed <b>control</b> <b>unit.</b> Large and small-signal mathematical models indicated that <b>a</b> relatively simple <b>control</b> system {{would be capable of}} adequately slaving a tractor-implement <b>unit</b> to <b>an</b> operator <b>controlled</b> <b>unit.</b> An experimental system was constructed and field tested which confirmed this indication...|$|R

25|$|In 2013 {{the first}} {{digitally}} controlled, full-LED glare-free adaptive highbeam is introduced by Audi on the facelifted Audi A8, with 25 individual LED segments (Matrix LED). The system dims light that would shine directly onto oncoming and preceding vehicles, but continues to cast its full {{light on the}} zones between and beside them. This works because the LED high beams are split into numerous individual light-emitting diodes. High-beam LEDs in both headlights are arranged in a matrix and adapt fully electronically to the surroundings in milliseconds. They are activated and deactivated or dimmed individually by <b>a</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit.</b> In addition, the headlights also function as a cornering light. Using predictive route data supplied by the MMI navigation plus, {{the focus of the}} beam is shifted towards the bend even before the driver turns the steering wheel. In 2014: Mercedes-Benz introduced a similar technology on the facelifted CLS-Class in 2014, called MULTIBEAM LED, with 24 individual segments.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the capital}} outlay can be high, it is {{desirable}} to use a meter-mix or dispense unit for even low-volume production operations that require a steady output of finished parts. Dispense equipment consists of material holding (day) tanks, metering pumps, a mix head, and <b>a</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit.</b> Often, a conditioning or heater-chiller unit is added to control material temperature {{in order to improve}} mix efficiency, cure rate, and to reduce process variability. Choice of dispense equipment components depends on shot size, throughput, material characteristics such as viscosity and filler content, and process control. Material day tanks may be single to hundreds of gallons in size, and may be supplied directly from drums, IBCs (intermediate bulk containers, such as totes), or bulk storage tanks. They may incorporate level sensors, conditioning jackets, and mixers. Pumps can be sized to meter in single grams per second up to hundreds of pounds per minute. They can be rotary, gear, or piston pumps, or can be specially hardened lance pumps to meter liquids containing highly abrasive fillers such as chopped or hammer milled glass fibres and wollastonite.|$|E
500|$|To {{improve the}} tank's firepower, the gun mount around the loader's turret hatch was {{modified}} {{to allow the}} installation of a 12.7-millimeter (0.5in) machine gun, while the main gun's firepower was augmented through {{the introduction of the}} new CETME437A armor-piercing, fin-stabilized discarding sabot (APFSDS). [...] The gun's accuracy was improved through the installation of the new Mark9 modification A/D fire control system, designed by Hughes Aircraft Company. [...] The new system allowed firing during the day and during night operations, and increased the likelihood of a first round impact. [...] The fire control system was also modernized through the exchange of the old M282 gunner's periscope with a new periscope and a new [...] laser rangefinder. [...] A new ballistics computer, the NSC-800, was issued, as well as a new digital panel for the gunner, designed and manufactured by the Spanish company INISEL. [...] The tank commander also received <b>a</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> that allowed the choice of ammunition for the gun and provided information on the ballistics of the round and the target to be engaged. [...] As a result, the loader received a presentation unit to display information on which round to load into the gun's breech and to communicate ballistic data received, including angular velocity, wind velocity, gun elevation and vehicle inclination. [...] The fire control system also allowed for the future upgrade to a more sophisticated stabilization system for the tank's main gun. [...] Survivability improvements included the addition of new steel side-skirts, a new smoke generating system linked to the engine and a new fire suppression system.|$|E

2500|$|The air/water-brine/water {{heat pump}} is a hybrid heat pump, {{developed}} in Rostock, Germany, that uses only renewable energy sources. [...] Unlike other hybrid systems, which usually combine both conventional {{and renewable energy}} sources, it combines air and geothermal heat in one compact device. The air/water-brine/water heat pump has two evaporators — an outside air evaporator and a brine evaporator — both connected to the heat pump cycle. This allows use of the most economical heating source for the current external conditions (for example, air temperature). [...] The unit automatically selects the most efficient operating mode — air or geothermal heat, or both together. [...] The process is controlled by <b>a</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit,</b> which processes the large amounts of data delivered by the complex heating system.|$|E
2500|$|Tesla coils {{can also}} be used to {{generate}} sounds, including music, by modulating the system's effective [...] "break rate" [...] (i.e., the rate and duration of high power RF bursts) via MIDI data and <b>a</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit.</b> The actual MIDI data is interpreted by a microcontroller which converts the MIDI data into a PWM output which can be sent to the Tesla coil via a fiber optic interface. The YouTube video [...] shows a performance on matching solid state coils operating at 41kHz. The coils were built and operated by designer hobbyists Jeff Larson and Steve Ward. The device has been named the Zeusaphone, after Zeus, Greek god of lightning, and as a play on words referencing the Sousaphone. The idea of playing music on the singing Tesla coils flies around the world and a few followers continue the work of initiators. An extensive outdoor musical concert has demonstrated using Tesla coils during the Engineering Open House (EOH) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The Icelandic artist Björk used a Tesla coil in her song [...] "Thunderbolt" [...] as the main instrument in the song. The musical group ArcAttack uses modulated Tesla coils and a man in a chain-link suit to play music.|$|E
