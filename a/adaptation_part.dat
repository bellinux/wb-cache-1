40|$|This is {{the first}} part of a {{publication}} that describes the generation of adaptive grids (this part), and simulations with vector-ocean-model (VOM) in unstructured grids resulting from the <b>adaptation</b> (<b>part</b> 11). A static vertical adaptive grid in z-coordinates allows improving the approximation of topography and vertical resolution at slopes. Adaptive grids use elements from a set of grid sizes by multiplying a basic smallest cell size with powers of two, as in cell division. Grids with locally isotropic vertical resolution at surface, seabed, and slopes can be generated whereby resolution decreases towards the ocean interior. The adaptation to topography yields unstructured grids that are organised in a one-dimensional vector by column-wise storage of cells, discarding land cells. The vector storage suggested the model's name. Grids are generated by an iterative procedure that relies on rules, i. e. criteria and directives to control the grid structure in favour of a good representation of physics and smooth numerical operations. The directives govern vertical resolution at sea surface and seabed, and at slopes. For the latter vertical resolution is extended in the horizontal. In the ocean interior horizontal distances between changes in grid size can be controlled for the sake of smooth numerics. The use of a z-grid that avoids transformation errors, the depth-independence of vertical resolution, and the lateral extension of vertical resolution at slopes towards the ocean interior are the most significant differences of adaptive grids in comparison to vertical coordinate transformations. Unstructured grids do not rely on a smoothing of topography and can be used within any of the horizontal Arakawa-grids. For the same topography directives allow creating various grids as demonstrated for a shelf-ocean topography. The number of cells per column in two unstructured grids generated for the North Atlantic may locally well exceed typical layer numbers in conventional model matrices. But the domain average is similar to layer numbers of today's ocean models. Thus, with the same investment of cells per domain a higher resolution in slope regions can be achieved by unstructured grids as compared to conventional z-grids. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Legal scholars have in turn begun to explore how the many different fields of law will and should respond. During this nascent period, one overarching question has gone unexamined: how will the legal system as a whole organize around climate change adaptation? Will a new distinct field of climate change adaptation law and policy emerge, or will legal institutions simply work away at the problem through unrelated, duly self-contained fields, as in the famous Law of the Horse? This Article is the first to examine that question comprehensively, to move beyond thinking about the law and climate change adaptation to consider the law of climate change <b>adaptation.</b> <b>Part</b> I of the Article lays out our methodological premises and approach. Using a model we call Stationarity Assessment, Part I explores how legal fields are structured and sustained based on assumptions about the variability of natural, social, and economic conditions, and how disruptions to that regime of variability can lead to the emergence of new fields of law and policy. Case studies of environmental law and environmental justice demonstrate the model’s predictive power for the formation of new distinct legal regimes. Part II applies the Stationarity Assessment model to the topic of climate change adaptation, using a case study of a hypothetical coastal region and the potential for climate change impacts to disrupt relevant legal doctrines and institutions. We find that most fields of law appear capable of adapting effectively to climate change. In other words, without some active intervention, we expect the law and policy of climate change adaptation to follow the path of the Law of the Horse - a collection of fields independently adapting to climate change - rather than organically coalescing into a new distinct field. Part III explores why, notwithstanding this conclusion, it may still be desirable to seek a different trajectory. Focusing on the likelihood of systemic adaptation decisions with perverse, harmful results, we identify the potential benefits offered by intervening to shape a new and distinct field of climate change adaptation law and policy.

40|$|Traditional rugby-specific {{resistance}} training programmes typically concentrate on quantifying load via volume or intensity and use lower body exercises that principally {{work in the}} vertical plane. The experimental studies in this thesis sought to explore alternatives to such strategies and to establish methods that can be utilised to maximise the development of rugby specific strength, power and speed. The intention of this thesis was to enhance the current understanding of rugby-specific strength and power development therefore professional rugby players were specifically chosen as subjects, mindful of the population specific nature of training <b>adaptation.</b> <b>Part</b> One investigated the effect of utilising instantaneous performance feedback. Specifically, determining the reliability of jump squat velocity under feedback and non-feedback conditions over three training sessions; quantifying the effect of feedback on jump squat velocity over six training sessions; and quantifying the effect over a six week training block on sport specific performance tests. The first study determined an approximately 50 % probability that the provision of feedback was beneficial to consistency of performance in the variable of interest i. e. velocity. Smaller changes in mean peak velocities between Sessions 1 - 2 and Sessions 2 - 3 (0. 07 and 0. 02 m. s- 1 vs. 0. 13 and - 0. 04 m. s- 1), less random variation (TE = 0. 06 and 0. 06 m. s- 1 vs. 0. 10 and 0. 07 m. s- 1) and greater consistency (ICC = 0. 83 and 0. 87 vs. 0. 53 and 0. 74) between sessions for the feedback condition were observed. The second study established a 78 % chance feedback was practically beneficial in producing superior performances during training. An average 2. 1 % increase in mean velocity during training was observed with feedback whilst a plateau in velocity occurred once feedback was withdrawn. The third study concluded the provision of feedback provided a greater potential for adaptation and larger training effects. Probabilities feedback was beneficial to increasing performance of sport specific tests were 45 % for vertical jump, 65 % for 10 m sprints, 49 % for 20 m sprints, 83 % for horizontal jump, and 99 % for 30 m sprints. It is suggested the provision of feedback is utilised to improve consistency and performance during training and optimise transference to sport specific tests. Part Two investigated the effect of prescribing lower body exercises with a horizontal component. Specifically, quantifying the effect of training using an equated horizontal component squat exercise for five weeks (vertical vs. horizontal squats) on typical measures of vertical strength and power and other sport specific performance tests. The first study outlined the methodological approach to equating the vertical force production of a vertical squat and horizontal component squat exercise. The second study established that the increased specificity of training did not compromise performance adaptations achieved through traditional vertical based training. Probabilities the horizontal component training had practically reduced adaptive potential were low for squat (11 %), deadlift (4 %), and powerclean (8 %). The third study concluded horizontal component lower body was more effective for improving sprint ability than vertical training. Probabilities there was a practical difference, whereby five weeks of horizontal component training had a superior adaptive potential were large for 30 m (74 %), 10 - 30 m (75 %), and 20 - 30 m (94 %) sprint intervals. It is suggested horizontal component lower body exercises are prescribed during training to optimise transference to sprinting performance...|$|E
40|$|Mangrove trees grow in an {{environment}} that is highly demanding for their water transport. Frequent tidal inundation may impede water uptake at the soil side, while in the prevailing tropical conditions, heat and wind are ‘pulling’ at the atmospheric side of the water column. On top, the mangrove environment is highly dynamic. Environmental conditions can quickly change in an unpredictable way. However, mangrove trees seem to make a virtue of necessity, thriving very well in these harsh environmental conditions. How can a water transport system of trees adapt to such environmental conditions? Is such <b>adaptation</b> <b>part</b> of the ecological success of the mangrove genus Avicennia in this environment as well as stretching its range into different climate zones? We address these two research questions through functional wood anatomy and ecophysiology, two research disciplines that search for anatomy-environment relationships both by physiological interpretation of observed internal structure and direct physiological experiments. In part one of the study we investigate the requirements of the hydraulic system for survival in the mangrove environment and its adaptation to the gradient of environmental conditions within the intertidal zone. We compare the vessel characteristics of nine mangrove genera - representing all but one families with core mangrove species - with those of their respective non-mangrove sister taxa (Chapter 1). Furthermore, we assess the wood anatomy of Avicennia marina and Rhizophora mucronata - the two most widespread species of the only two pantropical mangrove genera - along the intertidal gradient in soil water salinity and inundation frequency of the mangrove forest in Gazi Bay (Kenya) (Chapter 2). Our results show that survival in the mangrove forest requires a vascular system composed of numerous narrow water conducting vessels. This structure allows for bypassing air-filled vessel sections present to a greater extent in conditions of limiting water availability. With increasing soil water salinity and decreasing inundation frequency, the wood anatomy of mangrove trees has a more pronounced safety structure, i. e. numerous narrow vessels, and this at between-species and within-species level. Avicennia trees have the most pronounced hydraulic safety structure. This can partly explain the ecological success of the genus. In part two, we focus on the study of the successive cambia in the genus Avicennia. Unlike in other mangrove trees, the radial growth of Avicennia trees occurs through several vascular cambia, characterizing the tree stem with internal phloem tissue. We investigate the possible ecological advantage this anatomical feature could offer Avicennia trees for survival in the mangrove environment, both by the presence of internal phloem (Chapter 3 and 5) and the special patchy nature of radial growth (Chapter 4). We make a three-dimensional reconstruction of the internal hydraulic structure of Avicennia trees along the intertidal gradient through (micro-) CT-scanning (Chapter 3), investigate the link between species with internal phloem and drought-characterized habitats through a database analysis (Chapter 3), study the growth patterns of two Avicennia trees through a dendrometer analysis (Chapter 4) and assess the internal water content of three species with internal phloem, Bougainvillea spectabilis, Avicennia marina and A. cf. officinalis, a non-mangrove and two mangrove species respectively, through Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) (Chapter 5). The internal hydraulic structure of Avicennia is a complex network of xylem and phloem patches that can change extensively with small vertical distance. A large amount of internal phloem tissue is present in conditions that are highly demanding for the water transport, i. e. higher soil water salinity and less frequent inundation. Also, trees and shrubs with internal phloem mainly occur in habitats that are characterized by periodical or continuous physiological drought. This indicates the ecological significance of internal phloem tissue. Since internal phloem tissue shows high water content on MRI-scans, a high water storage capacity could allow trees with internal phloem to better overcome air-filling of vessel sections. Avicennia trees show a high degree of patchiness in their anatomical structure and in the shrinking and swelling patterns of their stems. Different locations around the stem circumference can, but do not necessarily, react in a similar way to the prevailing environmental conditions. Correspondingly, radial stem increment can be patchy, but is not a systematic feature. In this way, Avicennia has a large adaptive toolbox of possibilities to interact with the environment and to optimally distribute available resources over the tree stem, dynamic both in space and in time, adding to the explanation for its ecological success within the mangrove forest. We can conclude that the vascular factor is important in the survival of mangrove trees in their environment. It is the combination of a safe water conducting vessel system, an internal phloem tissue with high water content and a spatially and temporally dynamic growth system that contributes to the success of Avicennia in the mangrove environment, allowing for withstanding a gradient in soil water salinities and inundation frequencies. This research adds to the general understanding of tree functioning since it has brought insight in important vascular factors for tree survival in harsh environmental conditions. Future research focusing on ecological wood anatomy in a phylogenetic context and on the link between anatomy and physiology could deepen these insights...|$|E
