Methods and Materials: 31 Females (20 NUI & 11 PA) participated in this study. For measuring the strength, each individual performed 5 continuous concentric-eccentric maximal contraction at angular velocities of 90 °/s, 135 °/s. Twenty five percent of each individual (Maximum Voluntary Isometric Contraction) MVIC was determined and used as Pre-load force. Results: Averages concentric & eccentric torques were greater in PA group in comparison with NUI group. The significant difference (P< 0. 02) existed between PA and NUI groups. <b>Average</b> concentric <b>torques</b> of quadriceps muscle decreased (with increasing of speed from 90 °/s to 135 °/s) and <b>average</b> eccentric <b>torques</b> increased. <b>Average</b> eccentric <b>torques</b> were greater (P< 0. 01) in PA & NUI groups in comparison with <b>average</b> concentric <b>torques.</b> Conclusion: PA group strength was greater in comparison with NUI group.

40|$|In {{this study}} the torque output of {{intermittently}} stimulated paralyzed human knee extensor muscles during imposed isokinetic cyclical lower leg movements {{was investigated in}} four paraplegic subjects. During prolonged (10 min) experiments the influence of knee angular velocity and stimulation parameters on fatigue-induced torque decline was studied. Pulse width and amplitude were set to obtain maximal recruitment. The cycle time was maintained constant at 2 s, comparable to a walking cycle. The maximum <b>torque</b> and <b>averaged</b> <b>torque</b> per cycle were estimated to determine the muscle's performance during sustained intermittent stimulation. The overall loss in time of these parameters had a typical exponential decay reaching asymptotic values.

Identification trials, determining the (isometric) torque-angle and (isokinetic) torque-angular velocity relation, were performed. The relations appeared to change due to fatigue.

40|$|Since the {{permanent}} magnets (PMs) and armature windings of partitioned stator (PS) PM machines {{are located in}} two separate inner and outer stators, their positions can be exchanged to optimize the space utilization, especially in radial field rotating machines. Therefore, in this paper, the influence of PM and armature winding stator positions on the electromagnetic performance of PS-PM machines is investigated {{based on the novel}} PS-PM machines (PS-PMMs) with surface-mounted PM (SPM) stator. Similar to the single-stator surface-mounted PMMs (SS-PMMs), flexible rotor pole number, bipolar phase flux linkage, and symmetrical phase back electromotive force (EMF) are also obtained in PS-PMMs. Based on the same 12 / 10 stator/rotor pole number combination, PS-PMM-I (PMs located in the inner stator) and PS-PMM-II (PMs located in the outer stator) exhibit 120 % and 160 % higher phase back EMFs as well as 120 % and 139 % larger <b>average</b> <b>torques,</b> respectively, than the SS-PMM together almost without scarifying the PM utilization efficiency under the same machine size and the same rated copper loss.

Meanwhile, for both PS-PMM-Is and PS-PMM-IIs with 12 -pole stator, the machines with the 11 -pole rotor exhibit the optimal torque capabilities. Moreover, the reluctance torque is also negligible in the proposed PS-PMMs due to very low saliency ratio. The analyses are validated by experiment results of the prototype machine...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{isokinetic}} dynamometer {{has been}} considered the gold-standard measurement of muscle performance. However, the reliability for the passive mode in children has not been reported to date. OBJECTIVES: The purpose was to evaluate {{the reliability of the}} isokinetic dynamometer in passive mode in children. METHOD: Twenty-one healthy children (ten girls, eleven boys), aged 5 to 12 years (age: 8. 5 &# 177; 2. 2 years), were evaluated using an isokinetic dynamometer. Each participant was tested twice with a one-week interval and performed five consecutive cycles of knee extension and flexion. The test was performed at 60 &# 186;/s in the concentric passive mode and the children performed maximal contractions. The measured variables were peak <b>torque,</b> <b>average</b> peak <b>torque,</b> total work, and average power, time to peak torque and angle of peak torque for dominant and non-dominant lower limbs. Reliabilities were determined using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC 3, 1), standard error of measurement (SEM and SEM%), and coefficient of variation (CV). RESULTS: We found good reliability in both lower limbs for peak <b>torque,</b> <b>average</b> peak <b>torque,</b> total work and average power of knee flexors and extensors, with ICC 3, 1 values greater than 0. 80; SEM ranging from 6. 7 to 79. 2; SEM% ranging from 10. 4 % to 16. 8 %; CV lower than 15 %. Bland-Altman analysis showed that the bias was low than 10 % and limits of agreement (LOAs) ranging from 33. 9 % to 59. 2 %, and - 28. 8 % and - 52. 8 %, showing that measures tended to disagree. However, time to peak torque (ICC 3, 1 0. 34; SEM%> 37. 4 %; CV> 41. 7 %; bias > 24. 0 %; LOA> 101. 0 %) and angle of peak torque (ICC 3, 1 9. 3; SEM%> 27. 6 %; CV> 15. 3 %; bias> 11. 0 %; LOA> 61. 0 %) were not reliable.
