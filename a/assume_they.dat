5|$|After hearing {{news that}} Syed {{is trying to}} find his wife Amira Shah (Preeya Kalidas), Yusef visits her father, Qadim (Ramon Tikaram) at his office and offers to avenge his family for causing Amira pain. When Zainab and Yusef attend an event together, people <b>assume</b> <b>they</b> are married and Zainab does not correct them. Afterwards, Yusef admits to Zainab that he has great {{feelings}} for her but they should maintain some distance as she is married. Yusef continues to manipulate Zainab and ply her with pills, but she says she wishes to stop taking them, so Yusef crushes up a bottle of pills and conceals them in Zainab's food. Zainab passes out and is hospitalised, with her family believing she took a deliberate overdose, as was Yusef's plan. Concerned that he himself is causing Zainab's worries, Masood divorces Zainab by saying the triple talaq.|$|E

They were lying in such a position that one can <b>assume</b> <b>they</b> were killed by machine-gun bursts. It struck me at once that the dead soldiers were not wearing helmets, nor did they have any equipment on them...I took pictures of the dead bodies, and the whole farm. At Thum's request these were to be placed at the disposal of the division...I believe I was already sitting there in the vehicle when Thum...told me that in the field which he had returned the equipment...the shot British soldiers were lying in a heap, from which he had {{come to the conclusion that}} a summary trial had taken place.|$|E

25|$|Structuration is {{very useful}} in synthesising micro and macro issues. On a micro scale, one of individuals' {{internal}} {{sense of self}} and identity, consider the example of a family: we are increasingly free to choose our own mates and how to relate with them, which creates new opportunities but also more work, as the relationship becomes a reflexive project that has to be interpreted and maintained. Yet this micro-level change cannot be explained only by looking at the individual level as people did not spontaneously change their minds about how to live; neither can we <b>assume</b> <b>they</b> were directed to do so by social institutions and the state.|$|E
25|$|All dime-novel {{publishers}} were canny about reusing and refashioning material, but Street & Smith {{excelled at}} it. They developed {{the practice of}} publishing four consecutive, related tales of, for example, Nick Carter, in the weekly magazine, then combining the four stories into one edition of the related thick-book series, in this instance, the New Magnet Library. The Frank Merriwell stories appeared in the Medal, New Medal and Merriwell libraries, Buffalo Bill in the Buffalo Bill Library and Far West Library, and so on. The thick books were still in print {{as late as the}} 1930s but carry the copyright date of the original story, often as early as the late nineteenth century, leading some dealers and new collectors today to erroneously <b>assume</b> <b>they</b> have original dime novels when the books are only distantly related.|$|E
25|$|There is less {{research}} on anal sexual activity among {{women who have}} sex with women compared to couples of other sexual orientations. In 1987, a non-scientific study (Munson) was conducted of more than 100 members of a lesbian social organization in Colorado. When asked what techniques they used in their last ten sexual encounters, lesbians in their 30s were twice as likely as other age groups to engage in anal stimulation (with a finger or dildo). While author Tom Boellstorff, when particularly examining anal sex among gay and lesbian individuals in Indonesia, stated that he had not heard of oral-anal contact or anal penetration as recognized forms of lesbian sexuality but <b>assume</b> <b>they</b> take place, author Felice Newman cites anal sex as a part of lesbian sexual practices. A 2014 study of partnered lesbian women in Canada and the U.S. found that 7% engaged in anal stimulation or penetration at least once a week; about 10% did so monthly and 70% did not at all.|$|E

25|$|The {{controversy}} raged {{within the}} navy and in public for about {{a decade after the}} war. Criticism focused on Jellicoe's decision at 19:15. Scheer had ordered his cruisers and destroyers forward in a torpedo attack to cover the turning away of his battleships. Jellicoe chose to turn to the south-east, and so keep out of range of the torpedoes. Supporters of Jellicoe, including the historian Cyril Falls, pointed to the folly of risking defeat in battle when one already has command of the sea. Jellicoe himself, {{in a letter to the}} Admiralty seventeen months before the battle, said that he intended to turn his fleet away from any mass torpedo attack (that being the universally accepted proper tactical response to such attacks, practised by all the major navies of the world). He said that, in the event of a fleet engagement in which the enemy turned away, he would <b>assume</b> <b>they</b> intended to draw him over mines or submarines, and he would decline to be so drawn. The Admiralty approved this plan and expressed full confidence in Jellicoe at the time (October 1914).|$|E
25|$|Vijay soon discovers {{how quickly}} {{the media and the}} public can make a villain out of a hero. Unable to bear the shock and humiliation, Ram suffers a brain hemorrhage. Nandini takes the {{responsibility}} to care for Ram and take in Vijay. Vijay and Nandini fly to Australia to have surgery on his back. The surgery is successful and Vijay soon realises that Nandini, his childhood friend, could be his life partner. He nurtures his feelings for her but Nandini is still healing after Vijay's bad side took over and is finding it hard to trust him and behave like his true friend again. They return to Jaisalmer and Vijay vows to be a better cricketer for his country. He proves himself to his father and Nandini that he can play for his country and his coach relies on him too. He gets selected once again to play in the major international cricket tournament. He injures himself whilst playing but vows to play no matter his health. He wins the cricket tournament and returns to his hometown Jaisalmer, to see his father and Nandini. Vijay and his father reconcile and just when everything is going fine Ram dies in Vijay's arms. They hold the funeral and we see Vijay and Nandini comforting each other in the end scene. We <b>assume</b> <b>they</b> get together. And it finishes with Vijay once again playing in a cricket tournament and playing for his country.|$|E

Amy is arrested early by two of Eggman's robots for associating with Sonic when she claims to be his girlfriend. Annoyed, Sonic rescues her and realizes she is a fugitive and must remain with the Freedom Fighters. Amy becomes a valued member, frequently fighting with a bow and arrow. She occasionally saves the day without Sonic, once leading the Freedom Fighters in his absence. Unlike most other Sonic media, Amy's love for Sonic in Sonic the Comic is shallow (although others [...] <b>assume</b> <b>they</b> are dating, and she plays along).|$|E

500|$|Their first {{performance}} {{together as}} a band was at the Austin Irish pub Mother Egan's. Given a noon to 3pm time slot, they began to fill the pub with patrons week after week. Their fans at Mother Egan's soon began calling them the [...] "Bluegrass Bunch". Several months later, The Greencards began performing an additional {{three to five times}} per week in Austin, in addition to their Mother Egan's Sunday show. Warner credited the frantic pace of their performance schedule during their Austin formation to their cohesion as a group and with driving them to create more new original music. During their time performing locally in Austin, they toured with various local Texas musicians, including Robert Earl Keen. Warner said that during their early career performing together, audiences would always <b>assume</b> <b>they</b> were American musicians until they finally spoke between songs, revealing their English and Australian accents.|$|E
500|$|Kyle, Cartman, Stan, [...] and Kenny enjoy a {{nice day}} outside with the weather being warm until {{a large group of}} Harley riders disturb them. The {{residents}} of South Park are frustrated by a large group of Harley riders frequently making noise in town. The Harley riders eat lunch and talk about how nobody is paying attention to them, so one of the Harley riders comes up with a noise to get everyone's attention. Before the Harley riders take off, Cartman confronts the bikers, describing them as insecure losers who ride loud motorcycles to draw attention to themselves. Cartman tells them their behavior makes them look like [...] "fags" [...] and, when other children begin referring to the bikers with the same slur, the bikers <b>assume</b> <b>they</b> are being insulted because they are not being loud enough. They believe that they should be louder because after all, children are around loud stuff today (such as the Xbox 360 and Surround sound system). The motorcyclists equip their motorcycles with horns, sirens and various musical instruments. The boys devise a plan to rid the town of the bikers. However, once Butters reveals that he likes Harley motorcycles, he is not allowed to participate in the scheme. As the riders eat at a diner, Cartman defecates on the seats of their motorcycles while Kyle and Stan spray paint [...] "FAGS GET OUT" [...] on several buildings around town. The boys are pleased when the bikers temporarily leave town, but the graffiti alarms Big Gay Al and Mr. Slave because they interpret it as homophobia.|$|E
500|$|After {{stuffing}} {{themselves with}} turkey on Thanksgiving, {{it is time}} to take the annual Christmas card family photo, and when Bart and Lisa complain about it, Marge notes that they will grow to appreciate the photos when they become older and have children of their own. Lisa questions why Marge would <b>assume</b> <b>they</b> will even have children in the first place, and the episode jumps thirty years into the future via a series of Simpsons Christmas cards. The photos finally settle on a future where Bart is a deadbeat, divorced father with two sons whom he does not see often; Lisa is a successful businesswoman who is married to Milhouse and has a rebellious daughter named Zia; and Maggie is the lead singer of a famous band and in the late stages of pregnancy. In his apartment at the former Springfield Elementary, Bart is visited by his sons, who inform him that their mother Jenda teleported them to his place because she wants him to act like a proper father by having him spend time with them. However, he plans on dropping them off at his parents' house instead. Meanwhile, Lisa fears that Zia is spending too much of her time going into the [...] "Ultranet", a digital world that people enter with their consciousness by plugging themselves into a laptop. Milhouse suggests to Lisa that she spend time with Zia {{in order for them to}} have a better connection, so Lisa decides to take Zia to her parents' house, too. Meanwhile, Maggie flies home from London to Springfield to also celebrate Christmas with her parents.|$|E

However, {{there is an important}} distinction between taking an [...] "intentional stance" [...] toward something and entering a [...] "shared world" [...] with it. The intentional stance is a detached and functional theory we resort to during interpersonal interactions. A shared world is directly perceived and its existence structures reality itself for the perceiver. It is not just automatically applied to perception; it in many ways constitutes perception.|$|E
