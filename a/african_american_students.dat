ANAK {{played a major role in}} establishing several of Georgia Tech's most active student organizations – including its yearbook, the Blueprint; its student newspaper, the Technique; and its Student Government Association – as well as several lasting Georgia Tech traditions. The society also claims involvement in a number of civil rights projects, most notably in peacefully integrating Georgia Tech's first <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>students</b> and preventing the Ku Klux Klan from setting up a student chapter at Georgia Tech.

5|$|Around 1960, ANAK held {{a series}} of secret dinner {{meetings}} with the families of Ford Greene, Ralph A. Long, Jr. and Lawrence Michael Williams, Georgia Tech's first three <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>students.</b> The goal of these meetings, facilitated through the Georgia Tech YMCA, was to discuss the range of potential situations that could arise when the three students enrolled at Georgia Tech the following year, as well as appropriate reactions to each of these situations. When Greene, Long, and Williams enrolled in the fall semester of 1961, ANAK members discreetly kept a close watch on the three students for the first two weeks to ensure their safety. As a result of ANAK's efforts and those of other Institute and city organizations, none of the students was involved in any serious incident, paving the way for continued peaceful racial integration.|$|E
5|$|Educating the Disfranchised and Disinherited is a 1999 {{biography}} of American General Samuel Chapman Armstrong and his associated normal school for freedmen, Hampton Institute, written by Robert Francis Engs {{and published by}} the University of Tennessee Press. The first full {{biography of}} its kind, the book portrays Armstrong as a complex politician and administrator in the postbellum period who balanced the needs of opposed parties surrounding the Virginia school: its <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>students,</b> Southern white neighbors, and Northern philanthropist funders. Previous works presented Armstrong in a polarized fashion, as either a savior or handicap for freedmen.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine four {{variables}} that impact <b>African</b> <b>American</b> male <b>students??????</b> perceptions of their transition from elementary school to middle school. This study determined what role social, emotional, physical, and academic variables have in the transition process from elementary school to middle school for <b>African</b> <b>American</b> males. The two guiding questions for this mixed methods study were: 1. What are <b>African</b> <b>American</b> male <b>students??????</b> perceptions of personal development variables on their transition from elementary school to middle school? 2. How do <b>African</b> <b>American</b> male <b>students</b> describe their transitional experience from elementary school to middle school? Participants in this study were 149 <b>African</b> <b>American</b> male <b>students</b> from five middle schools in southeast Texas. Findings of the study were derived from the use of a self-developed 52 -item questionnaire (Student Transition Perception Survey) with one free-response question and interviews of ten students (two from each school). The major findings in this study were: 1. Social variable ??????<b>African</b> <b>American</b> male <b>students</b> felt that schools did not provide a positive school climate, teachers did not treat them with respect, and their parents were supportive of their education. 2. Emotional variable ??????<b>African</b> <b>American</b> male <b>students</b> felt that schools did not make them feel successful, and they did not feel equal to their peers. 3. Physical variable ??????<b>African</b> <b>American</b> male <b>students</b> were equally divided in the acceptance of their physical appearance and when they compared themselves to others. 4. Academic variable ??????<b>African</b> <b>American</b> male <b>students</b> felt that teachers did not give them valuable attention in class. 5. When looking at the trend of student responses among the five schools, <b>African</b> <b>American</b> male <b>students</b> shared similar feelings about the social, emotional, physical, and academic variables. 6. <b>African</b> <b>American</b> male <b>students</b> expressed their feelings about being unsafe, experiencing differentiated teacher treatment, declining grades, and difficulty in their middle school transition...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The {{majority}} of <b>African</b> <b>American</b> college <b>students</b> in the U. S. attend predominantly white institutions (PWIs). However, there is minimal research examining this population’s HIV/STI risk behaviors. The {{purpose of this}} investigation was to assess HIV/STI behavioral risk factors among <b>African</b> <b>American</b> college <b>students</b> (aged 18 – 24 years) attending PWIs. (n = 2, 568) Methods: Backwards step-wise logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine factors associated with a positive HIV/STI diagnosis (past year) among sexually active <b>African</b> <b>American</b> college <b>students</b> who participated in the Spring, 2006 National College Health Assessment. Findings: Nine factors were significantly associated with an HIV/STI diagnosis among <b>African</b> <b>American</b> college <b>students</b> attending PWIs. Different risk factors were associated with having a HIV/STI diagnosis among <b>African</b> <b>American</b> male and female college students. These results may be useful to HIV/STIs prevention programs targeting <b>African</b> <b>American</b> college <b>students</b> attending PWIs...|$|R

25|$|Between 1966 and 1968, Northwestern {{increased}} African American enrollments {{from less}} than 50 to 160. After the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. in April 1968, <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>students</b> on campus began expressing increasingly militant and separatist views demanding the administration increase recruitment activity and provide separate facilities for black students. After the university rejected their demands, on May 3, 1968 a group of 100 <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>students</b> identifying themselves as For Members Only and the Afro-American Student Union barricaded themselves the Bursar's Office and began a sit-in, demanding the university implement an admissions quota, increase financial aid, construct an all-black dorm and student center, create a Black Studies curriculum, and desegregate the university's real estate holdings in Evanston. In light of controversy surrounding the student protests at Columbia and Berkeley that spring, negotiations between Dean of Students Roland Hinz and AASU leader James Turner led to the sit-in dispersing peacefully after 38 hours. Although the administration rejected demands for racial preferences in admissions and financial aid, it made several concessions regarding desegregation, increasing student participation in policy matters, and developing a Department of African-American Studies.|$|E
