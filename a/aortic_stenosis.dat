5|$|The heart can be {{affected}} by congenital diseases. These include failure of the developmental foramen ovale to close, present in up to 25% of people; ventricular or atrial septal defects, congenital diseases of the heart valves (e.g. congenital <b>aortic</b> <b>stenosis)</b> or disease relating to blood vessels or blood flow from the heart (such as a patent ductus arteriosus or aortic coarctation).; These may cause symptoms {{at a variety of}} ages. If unoxygenated blood travels directly from the right to {{the left side of the}} heart, it may be noticed at birth, as it may cause a baby to become blue (cyanotic) such as Tetralogy of Fallot. A heart problem may impact a child's ability to grow. Some causes rectify with time and are regarded as benign. Other causes may be incidentally detected on a cardiac examination. These disorders are often diagnosed on an echocardiogram.|$|E
40|$|<b>Aortic</b> valve <b>stenosis</b> is {{a common}} disease. Despite this, the {{diagnosis}} may often be missed; {{a significant proportion of}} patients are still identified at post-mortem examination, and 5 % of operations are performed at end stage. Unrecognized <b>aortic</b> valve <b>stenosis</b> is an important cause of anesthetic mortality. One reason for failing to make a diagnosis is that the clinical signs can be difficult to interpret due to the confounding association with arterial hypertension, coronary artery disease and systemic arteriosclerosis, potentially blunting the effects of <b>aortic</b> valve <b>stenosis</b> on the circulation. Moreover, most patients with <b>aortic</b> valve <b>stenosis</b> have a long asymptomatic period and may not seek medical attention. In patients with severe, symptomatic, calcific <b>aortic</b> valve <b>stenosis,</b> <b>aortic</b> valve replacement is the only effective treatment; much evidence suggests that it should be offered to patients regardless of age, after appropriate clinical evaluation. Doppler echocardiography plays a pivotal role in confirming the diagnosis of <b>aortic</b> valve <b>stenosis</b> in assessing the severity of the disease and, ultimately, in giving prognostically relevant information. Moreover, echocardiography is suitable for monitoring of disease progression and left ventricular function in these patients, and is of fundamental support for clinical follow-up. Accurate noninvasive quantification of <b>aortic</b> valve <b>stenosis</b> is, however, a technically demanding and time-consuming procedure, with several potential pitfalls. Considering the frequency and importance of <b>aortic</b> valve <b>stenosis,</b> a comprehensive echocardiographic study should be offered and carefully performed in all patients with noteworthy murmurs and repeated regularly (at appropriate time intervals), together with clinical review, in patients in whom <b>aortic</b> valve <b>stenosis</b> has been diagnosed...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of aortic valve replacement (AVR) on left ventricular (LV) function and LV remodeling, comparing patients with <b>aortic</b> valve <b>stenosis</b> to patients with aortic regurgitation. BackgroundAortic valve disease is associated with eccentric or concentric LV hypertrophy and changes in LV function. The relationship between LV geometry and LV function and the effect of LV remodeling after AVR on diastolic filling, in patients with <b>aortic</b> valve <b>stenosis</b> compared with <b>aortic</b> regurgitation, are largely unknown. MethodsNineteen patients with aortic valve disease (12 <b>aortic</b> valve <b>stenosis,</b> 7 <b>aortic</b> regurgitation) were studied using magnetic resonance imaging to assess LV geometry and LV function before and 9 ± 3 months after AVR. Ten age-matched healthy males served as control subjects. ResultsBefore AVR, the ratio between left ventricular mass index (LVMI) and left ventricular end-diastolic volume index (LVEDVI) was only increased in patients with <b>aortic</b> valve <b>stenosis</b> (1. 37 ± 0. 16 g/ml) compared with control subjects (0. 93 ± 0. 08 g/ml, p < 0. 05). After AVR, LVMI/LVEDVI decreased significantly in <b>aortic</b> valve <b>stenosis</b> (to 1. 15 ± 0. 14 g/ml, p < 0. 0001), but increased significantly in aortic regurgitation (1. 02 ± 0. 20 g/ml to 1. 44 ± 0. 27 g/ml, p < 0. 0001). Before AVR, diastolic filling was impaired in both <b>aortic</b> valve <b>stenosis</b> and <b>aortic</b> regurgitation. Early after AVR, diastolic filling improved in patients with <b>aortic</b> valve <b>stenosis,</b> whereas patients with aortic regurgitation showed a deterioration in diastolic filling. ConclusionsEarly after AVR, patients with <b>aortic</b> valve <b>stenosis</b> show a decrease in both LVMI and LVMI/LVEDVI and an improvement in diastolic filling, whereas in patients with aortic regurgitation, LVMI decreases less rapidly than LVEDVI, causing concentric remodeling of the LV, most likely explaining the observed deterioration of diastolic filling in these patients...|$|R

25|$|Subvalvular <b>aortic</b> <b>stenosis</b> (Subaortic stenosis; SAS) is a {{congenital}} {{disease in}} dogs characterized by left ventricular outflow tract obstruction by a discrete ring or tunnel of fibrous tissue immediately below the aortic valve. It is inherited in Newfoundlands, and {{also found in}} Golden Retrievers, Rottweilers, Boxers, Bulldogs, German Shepherds, and Samoyeds. Signs include a left basilar systolic heart murmur, weak femoral pulse, fainting and exercise intolerance. Dogs with severe SAS are predisposed to dying suddenly.|$|E
25|$|In animal {{models of}} cardiac disease, {{functions}} of beta-catenin have been unveiled. In a guinea pig model of <b>aortic</b> <b>stenosis</b> and left ventricular hypertrophy, beta-catenin {{was shown to}} change subcellular localization from intercalated discs to the cytosol, despite {{no change in the}} overall cellular abundance of beta-catenin. vinculin showed a similar profile of change. N-cadherin showed no change, and there was no compensatory upregulation of plakoglobin at intercalated discs in the absence of beta-catenin. In a hamster model of cardiomyopathy and heart failure, cell-cell adhesions were irregular and disorganized, and expression levels of adherens junction/intercalated disc and nuclear pools of beta-catenin were decreased. These data suggest that a loss of beta-catenin {{may play a role in}} the diseased intercalated discs that have been associated with cardiac muscle hypertrophy and heart failure. In a rat model of myocardial infarction, adenoviral gene transfer of nonphosphorylatable, constitutively-active beta-catenin decreased MI size, activated the cell cycle, and reduced the amount of apoptosis in cardiomyocytes and cardiac myofibroblasts. This finding was coordinate with enhanced expression of pro-survival proteins, survivin and Bcl-2, and vascular endothelial growth factor while promoting the differentiation of cardiac fibroblasts into myofibroblasts. These findings suggest that beta-catenin can promote the regeneration and healing process following myocardial infarction. In a spontaneously-hypertensive heart failure rat model, investigators detected a shuttling of beta-catenin from the intercalated disc/sarcolemma to the nucleus, evidenced by a reduction of beta-catenin expression in the membrane protein fraction and an increase in the nuclear fraction. Additionally, they found a weakening in the association between glycogen synthase kinase-3β and beta-catenin, which may indicate altered protein stability. Overall, results suggest that an enhanced nuclear localization of beta-catenin may be important in the progression of cardiac hypertrophy.|$|E

500|$|Heart murmurs are {{abnormal}} heart sounds {{which can}} be either related to disease or benign, {{and there are several}} kinds. There are normally two heart sounds, and abnormal heart sounds can either be extra sounds, or [...] "murmurs" [...] related to the flow of blood between the sounds. Murmurs are graded by volume, from 1 (the quietest), to 6 (the loudest), and evaluated by their relationship to the heart sounds, position in the cardiac cycle, and additional features such as their radiation to other sites, changes with a person's position, the frequency of the sound as determined {{by the side of the}} stethoscope by which they are heard, and site at which they are heard loudest.Phonocardiograms can record these sounds, and echocardiograms are generally required for their diagnosis. Murmurs can result from valvular heart diseases due to narrowing (stenosis), or regurgitation of any of the main heart valves, such as <b>aortic</b> <b>stenosis,</b> mitral regurgitation or mitral valve prolapse. They can also result from a number of other disorders, including atrial and ventricular septal defects. Two common and infective causes of heart murmurs are infective endocarditis and rheumatic fever, particularly in developing countries. Infective endocarditis involves colonisation of a heart valve, and rheumatic fever involves an initial bacterial infection by Group A streptococcus followed by a reaction against heart tissue that resembles the streptococcal antigen.|$|E

SETTING [...] District general hospital. RESULTS [...] The patients showed reduced retention in the high shear platelet function tests. (a) Platelet retention in the filter test was 53. 6 (12. 6) % in patients with <b>aortic</b> valve <b>stenosis</b> and 84. 8 (9. 6) % in the controls (P < 0. 001). (b) Retention in the glass bead column test was 49. 8 (19. 2) in the patients and 87. 4 (8. 7) in the controls (P < 0. 001). (c) The standard bleeding time was longer in the patients (P < 0. 06). Results of the high shear tests (a, b, and c) after aortic valve replacement were within the normal range. The platelet count was low but within the normal range before surgery and increased postoperatively (P < 0. 01). There were no differences in the results of standard clotting tests, plasma and intraplatelet von Willebrand's factor, or in 15 platelet aggregation tests using five agonists between patients with <b>aortic</b> valve <b>stenosis</b> and controls. CONCLUSIONS [...] The high shear haemodynamics of <b>aortic</b> valve <b>stenosis</b> modify platelet function in vivo predisposing to a bleeding tendency. This abnormality of platelet function is detectable only in vitro using high shear tests. The abnormal function is reversed by aortic valve replacement.
