40|$|Current legal {{scholarship}} on <b>architectural</b> <b>regulation</b> of software focuses on how {{its lack of}} transparency may frustrate public accountability or, by the same token, enhance its effectiveness. This paper argues that <b>architectural</b> <b>regulation</b> poses deeper dangers to {{the very concept of}} law. Ordinarily, we think of law as rules that a person thinks about when deciding how to act, and which human beings must decide to enforce. Law as architecture operates differently. instead of affecting our calculus of choice, it structures the very conditions of action, such as social settings and the resources available in those settings. Thus, <b>architectural</b> <b>regulation</b> operates surreptitiously and may not even be perceived as governmental action. <b>Architectural</b> <b>regulation</b> thus allows government to shape our actions without our perceiving that our experience has been deliberately shaped, engendering a loss of moral agency. Because our norms are often the product of social experience with and discourse about new technologies, <b>architectural</b> <b>regulation</b> poses the danger that government can distort the evolution of constitutional norms like privacy...|$|E

40|$|Building on work in {{architectural}} theory, this Article {{demonstrates how}} additional attention to cities, neighborhoods, and individual buildings can reduce criminal activity. The field of cyberlaw {{has been transformed}} by the insight that architecture can regulate behavior in cyberspace; this insight will now {{be applied to the}} regulation of behavior in real space. The instinct of many lawyers, however, is to focus on legal rules, without thinking about the constraint of physical space. Ironically, even an architectural problem in crime control - 2 ̆ 2 broken windows 2 ̆ 2 - has prompted legal, not architectural solutions. Four architectural concepts are considered: increasing an area 2 ̆ 7 s natural surveillance (its visibility and susceptibility to monitoring by private citizens); introducing territoriality (by demarcating private and semiprivate spaces); reducing social isolation; and protecting potential targets. Some of these mechanisms are subtle, often times invisible, methods that prevent criminal activity. The Article then illustrates specific legal mechanisms that harness the power of architecture to prevent crime. Distinguishing between situations where the government acts as a builder, civil regulator, and criminal enforcer, solutions are suggested in a variety of legal fields, drawing on property, torts, taxation, contracts, and criminal law. Procurement and taxation strategies can promote effective public architecture; crime impact statements, zoning, tort suits, and contractual regulation may engender private architectural solutions as well. Criminal law, particularly through forfeiture, may also play a role. Several problems with <b>architectural</b> <b>regulation</b> are considered, such as the extension of social control and potential losses in privacy. Nevertheless, the Article concludes by suggesting that local jurisdictions should emphasize architecture more, and standard law-enforcement methods less...|$|E

30|$|This study {{concerns}} the practical {{application of the}} law in achieving an objective, not in establishing guilt or innocence ex post facto. This is important to understand, as for example, a judge, by consulting specific legal provisions and applying the law ex post facto, may be able to rule that an architect did not construct a building legally. The same judge may have great difficulty, however, applying those same <b>architectural</b> <b>regulations</b> and laws to build a safe and secure building. A judge, furthermore, may not be considered qualified to do so. Premised on this logic, we can infer therefore, that an architect is responsible for the application of the law during construction. In practical terms, architects are the professional incumbents of the laws that govern construction. They hold, in effect, an office responsible for ensuring that a building is constructed in accordance with the law.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the legal and}} governance issues presented by internet blocking (“filtering”) systems {{through the use of}} the United Kingdom’s Cleanfeed system as a national case study. The Cleanfeed system – which aims to block access to child abuse images – has been influential both domestically and internationally but {{has been the subject of}} relatively little sustained scrutiny in the literature. Using a mixed doctrinal and empirical methodology this work discusses the evolution of Cleanfeed and considers the way in which government pressure has led to a private body without any express legislative basis (the Internet Watch Foundation) being given the power to control what UK internet users can view. The thesis argues that the Cleanfeed system sits at the intersection of three distinct trends – the use of <b>architectural</b> <b>regulation,</b> regulation through intermediaries and self-regulation – which individually and collectively present significant risks for freedom of expression and good governance online. It goes on to identify and examine the fundamental rights norms and governance standards which should apply to internet blocking and tests the system against them, arguing in particular that Cleanfeed fails to meet the requirements developed by the European Court of Human Rights under Articles 6 and 10 ECHR. It considers the extent to which Cleanfeed might be made amenable to these principles through the use of judicial review or actions under the Human Rights Act 1998 and concludes that the diffuse structure of the system and the limited availability of horizontal effect against private bodies will leave significant aspects beyond the effective reach of the courts. This work also assesses claims that the Cleanfeed system is a proof of concept which should be extended so as to block other material considered objectionable (such as websites which “glorify terrorism”). It argues that the peculiar features of the system mean that it represents a best case scenario and does not support blocking of other types of content which are significantly more problematic. The thesis concludes by considering proposals for reform of the Cleanfeed system and the extent to which greater public law oversight might undermine the desirable features associated with self-regulation...|$|E

Accurate controlling {{the amount of energy}} consumed in building and providing the required designing criteria to save energy is quite vital. Traditional architecture as applied in Iran is of a great value for its extensive capabilities to provide solutions for effective use of energy. So, by taking advantage of collective wisdom of the architects of precedent generations as well as historical experience, an Iranian architect has achieved to this capability and contemporary artists could be inspired by this achievement to design new and modern buildings. Since, Zavareh is one of ancient cities of Iran and comprehensive studies have not been made on this city, then desirable recognition of climatic aspect of this city may be valuable to know the Iranian local /domestic architecture. In the present paper, the residential architecture of this city is going to be studied to provide reasonable solutions for designing. Then, by application of these solutions, designing regulations, optimized materials and <b>architectural</b> <b>regulations</b> consistent with the climatic conditions of this city will be established and finally an effective measure to achieve a lasting architecture is taken.

40|$|Property law regimes have a {{significant}} impact on the ability of individuals to engage in freedom of expression. Some property rules advance freedom of expression, and other rules retard freedom of expression. This Article examines the inhibiting effects on expression of public land use regulations. The focus is on two types of aesthetic regulations: (1) landscape regulations, including weed ordinances, that regulate yards; and (2) <b>architectural</b> <b>regulations</b> that regulate the exterior appearance of houses. Such regulations sometimes go too far in curtailing a homeowner 2 ̆ 7 s freedom of expression. Property owners 2 ̆ 7 expressive conduct should be recognized as “symbolic speech” under the First Amendment. The Supreme Court developed the symbolic speech doctrine in contexts other than land use, but the rationale for the doctrine supports its extension to aesthetically based land use regulations. The clearest case of protected speech is a homeowner 2 ̆ 7 s conduct that conveys a political message, such as a yard display that protests a decision made by a local government. Other conduct, however, that is nonpolitical in nature can convey a particularized message, and thus can merit First Amendment protection. Examples are a homeowner 2 ̆ 7 s decision to plant natural landscaping, motivated by ecological concerns, or to install a nativity scene at Christmas. A regulation that restricts an owner 2 ̆ 7 s protected speech is unconstitutional unless the government proves both that the regulation is narrowly tailored and that it protects a substantial public interest. If the public interest is solely based on the protection of aesthetic values, ordinarily it is not substantial enough to justify the restriction on speech. The government must come up with a plausible justification other than aesthetics to prevail. When the justification consists of an interest in addition to aesthetics, the balancing rules developed by the Supreme Court for symbolic speech should apply. If the regulation restricts expressive conduct, it may survive scrutiny only if it protects the community from conduct that causes significant economic or other non-aesthetic harm, while minimizing infringement on expression...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{one in a series}} that {{attempts}} to express concepts about architecture in mathematics. The reason is clarity. Although it may be quite useful in preliminary design stages to discuss architecture in verbal terms such as `harmony', `unity', c̀har-acter', or `diversity', a practicing designer will, eventually, have to address those terms by locating physical materials in physical space. Visual diversity is particularly relevant to the design communities because over 90 % of the cities in the United States, and cities in many other countries, regulate architectural aesthetics (Lightner, 1993; Uzzell and Jones, 1996), and visual diversity is a commonly regulated design principle (pro-moting visual diversity, avoiding monotony, avoiding chaos, or a combination of all three) (Duerksen and Goebel, 1999; Lightner, 1993). For instance: ‘‘There are several variations of <b>architectural</b> design <b>regulations.</b> Some ordinances contain anti-similarity provisions permitting an architectural board to disapprove a permit for excessive similarity to any other standing or approved structure within a specified distance.

The first form of transcriptional regulation is predominantly pairwise and specific, representing digitial control, while the second form is (in strength and distribution) continuous, representing analog control. Results Here we look at the properties of effective networks derived from significant gene expression changes under variation of the two forms of control and find that upon limitations of one type of control (caused e. g. by mutation of a global DNA architectural factor) the other type can compensate for compromised regulation. Mutations of global regulators significantly enhance the digital control, whereas in the presence of global DNA <b>architectural</b> proteins <b>regulation</b> is mostly of the analog type, coupling spatially neighboring genomic loci. Taken together our data suggest that two logically distinct – digital and analog – types of control are balancing each other.

We anticipate that the general concept of distinguishing logical types of control will apply to many complex biological networks. </p...|$|R

Between the urban fabric, architectural character and the human asset, traditional quarters exhibit their distinctiveness and authenticity. What is unjustifiably ignored {{is the fact that}} traditional quarters have never been frozen in time.

Modernity was the aim of every process of architectural production, and technology played significant part in every construction at all historical periods. This paper investigates the tendency to modernity that shaped the traditional quarters of the Arab city and how best new buildings are integrated in the historic core of cities in an attempt to offer new economic and social possibilities for sustainable urban structure. <b>Architectural</b> practice and <b>regulations</b> in traditional quarters, hence, have become counter-productive and misleading, {{when it comes to the}} future of historical contexts.
