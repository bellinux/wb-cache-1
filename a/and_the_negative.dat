5|$|In epileptic {{seizures}} a {{group of}} neurons begin firing in an abnormal, excessive, and synchronized manner. This results {{in a wave of}} depolarization known as a paroxysmal depolarizing shift. Normally, after an excitatory neuron fires it becomes more resistant to firing for a period of time. This {{is due in part to}} the effect of inhibitory neurons, electrical changes within the excitatory neuron, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>negative</b> effects of adenosine.|$|E
5|$|Respiratory failure {{may require}} {{intubation}} of the trachea and breathing support through mechanical ventilation, generally on an intensive care unit. The need for ventilatory support can be anticipated by measurement of two spirometry-based breathing tests: the {{forced vital capacity}} (FVC) <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>negative</b> inspiratory force (NIF). An FVC of less than 15ml per kilogram body weight or an NIF of less than 60cmH2O are considered markers of severe respiratory failure.|$|E
5|$|Sitti Nurbaya is {{generally}} {{considered one of the}} most important works of Indonesian literature, with its love story being compared to William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet and the Chinese legend of the Butterfly Lovers. Some Western critics, including Dutch critic A. Teeuw and writer A. H. Johns, consider it to be the first true Indonesian novel, as opposed to Azab dan Sengsara, which was less developed in its theme of forced marriage <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>negative</b> aspects of adat.|$|E

5|$|In 1980, Narayan was {{nominated}} to the Rajya Sabha, the upper {{house of the}} Indian Parliament, for his contributions to literature. During his entire six-year term, he was focused on one issue—the plight of school children, especially the heavy load of school books <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>negative</b> effect of the system on a child's creativity, which was something that he first highlighted in his debut novel, Swami and Friends. His inaugural speech was focused on this particular problem, and resulted {{in the formation of}} a committee chaired by Prof. Yash Pal, to recommend changes to the school educational system.|$|E
5|$|Integer {{powers of}} 2 are {{important}} in computer science. The positive integer powers 2n give the number of possible values for an n-bit integer binary number, e.g. 28 = 256 different values for 1byte. For a given number the binary number system denotes {{on one side of}} the binary point all the positive integer powers of 2, that are contained in the integer part of this number, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>negative</b> powers to the other side of the binary point represent the fractional part. This system is consistently used to represent numbers in computers for hardware reasons.|$|E

5|$|On 19 January 1957, Jordan {{signed the}} Arab Solidarity Agreement (ASA) with Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Syria which entailed those countries' {{financial}} assistance to replace the annual British aid to Jordan that ended with the abrogation of the Anglo-Jordanian Treaty in November 1956 (the treaty was officially and mutually abrogated in March 1957). However, implementation of the ASA was hindered by Egypt and Syria's inability or unwillingness to subsidize the Jordanian army, whose budget rivaled that of their own armies. Furthermore, by then, Abu Nuwar was steadily losing Hussein's confidence due to dissatisfaction with Abu Nuwar among the army brass <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>negative</b> effects that his anti-Western hostility was having on relations with Jordan's principal Western allies, the UK and US; Hussein viewed the latter two as much-needed alternatives of financial support to Jordan in lieu of his disappointment with the ASA.|$|E

They also bemoaned the politicisation of the military, whereby regime loyalists {{who were members of}} the Ngô family's covert Cần Lao Party were readily promoted ahead of more competent officers who were not insiders. Đông was supported in the conspiracy by his brother-in-law Lieutenant Colonel Nguyen Trieu Hong, whose uncle was a prominent official in a minor opposition party. The main link in the coup was Đông's commanding officer Thi, whom he persuaded to join the plot.|$|E
5|$|Though Sachsen entered {{service in}} 1878, she only participated in one annual fleet exercise, in 1880, before all four ships were {{assigned}} to the 1884 maneuvers. This was due to the poor performance of Sachsen in the 1880 maneuvers <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>negative</b> reputation of the class. Among the problems associated with the Sachsen-class ships was a tendency to roll dangerously due to their flat bottoms, which greatly reduced the accuracy of their guns. The ships were also poorly armored, compared to their contemporaries. In addition, they were slow and suffered from poor maneuverability. The four ships served rotations with the fleet for the next two years, though in 1886, all four were demobilized as the Reserve Division in the Baltic. Aside from the Sachsens half-sister , the German Navy took a hiatus on capital ship building until the late 1880s when the first of the s were laid down. The poor performance of the sortie corvettes, coupled with the rise of the Jeune École, led Leo von Caprivi to abandon capital ship construction in favor of torpedo boats.|$|E
