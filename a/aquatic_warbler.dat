500|$|The {{committee}} {{keeps the}} list of species it considers under review and, from time to time, makes changes. These are usually because species have increased in frequency and no longer meet the numerical criteria for inclusion. A species is removed if {{it has more than}} 150 records in the preceding ten years, with ten or more in at least eight of those years. Different criteria were used in a review in 2006 (see below). [...] There have been three major [...] "purges" [...] of species since the committee's formation. The first was soon after the committee's formation, in 1963, when 16 species were removed: red-crested pochard, snow goose, pectoral sandpiper, Mediterranean gull, Sabine's gull, melodious warbler, icterine warbler, yellow-browed warbler, northern goshawk, golden eagle, red kite, Kentish plover, crested tit, bearded tit, marsh warbler and Dartford warbler. Records of the last eight species had been considered only outside their [...] "normal" [...] British range (e.g. crested tits outside Scotland, and red kites outside Wales). The second was in 1982, when ten further species were removed: Cory's shearwater, purple heron, white stork, buff-breasted sandpiper, Richard's pipit, tawny pipit, Savi's warbler, <b>aquatic</b> <b>warbler,</b> serin and common rosefinch. Savi's warbler was re-admitted to the committee's list in 1998, due to declining numbers of occurrences. Thirdly, in 2006, a further 17 species were dropped from the list: ferruginous duck, Wilson’s petrel, great white egret, black kite, red-footed falcon, American golden plover, white-rumped sandpiper, white-winged black tern, alpine swift, red-rumped swallow, red-throated pipit, subalpine warbler, greenish warbler, dusky warbler, Radde's warbler, Arctic redpoll and rustic bunting. Their selection was based on different criteria from those previously used: more than 200 records in Britain ever, and more than 100 occasions in the last decade.|$|E

50|$|At the {{beginning}} of 2012 some disturbing news about the <b>aquatic</b> <b>warbler</b> population was reported. In 2012 the population was severely affected by the breeding sites in Europe rapidly overgrowing with reeds and the wintering grounds in Africa affected by droughts, therefore causing an unprecedented crash. The latest monitoring results, conducted by The BirdLife International <b>Aquatic</b> <b>Warbler</b> Conservation Team (AWCT), showed decrease of approximately 1/3 {{in each of the}} countries where the species breed (Lithuania, Poland, Belarus and Ukraine).

This MoU provides the basis for governments, NGO’s and scientists to work together to save the <b>aquatic</b> <b>warbler,</b> Europe’s rarest songbird. The MoU covers 22 range states (Belarus, Belgium, Bulgaria, France, Germany, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Russian Federation, Senegal, Slovakia, Spain, Switzerland, Ukraine and United Kingdom). As of August 2012, 16 range states have signed the MoU as well as two cooperating organizations.|$|E

The <b>aquatic</b> <b>warbler</b> is the rarest and the only internationally threatened passerine bird found in mainland Europe. Apart from a very small remnant population in Western Siberia, its breeding grounds are completely confined to Europe. As of May 2010, its global population of only 10,200-13,800 males is confined to less than 40 sites in only six countries, with four sites supporting over 80% of the global population. [...] The main threat the <b>aquatic</b> <b>warbler</b> is facing {{is the loss of}} habitat due to the decline of traditional, extensive agriculture and overgrowing of the species’ habitat with reeds and bushes or trees.|$|E
50|$|The natural {{heritage}} of the reserve is especially remarkable for the abundance and variety of its waterbird communities. Located on major migration routes, the Audomarois marsh provides food and necessary rest for birds such as Sedge Warblers (Acrocephalus schoenobaenus), the Bluethroat (Luscinia svecica), the warbler effarvate (Acrocephalus scirpaceus) and the rare <b>Aquatic</b> <b>Warbler</b> (Acrocephalus paludicola).|$|E
50|$|The MoU aims to {{safeguard}} the <b>aquatic</b> <b>warbler</b> (Acrocephalus paludicola) a small migratory waterbird that is estimated to have declined sharply at a rate equivalent to 40 per cent in the last 10 years.

50|$|The Second Meeting of Signatories {{took place}} in Biebrza National Park, Poland, 13-15 May 2010. At the meeting France and Mali added their {{signatures}} and became signatories to the MoU. France is especially important, because the entire world population passes through France {{once or twice a}} year, when the birds depend on intact refueling stations. Furthermore, the signatories decided to extend the geographical coverage of the MoU to include an additional seven new countries in Europe and Africa (Luxembourg, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, Portugal, Slovakia and Switzerland), bringing the range state total to 22. Finally, a new International Species Action Plan for the <b>Aquatic</b> <b>Warbler,</b> prepared by CMS’s partner BirdLife International on behalf of the European Union, was adopted. This plan helps to protect the species throughout its range and its breeding populations expand to other sites that had been lost in the past. In addition to giving a detailed account of distribution, biology and conservation status of the bird species, it envisages concrete actions to be taken by the countries. Future project implementation priorities were also discussed, and high among these is the continued search for confirmed wintering sites in sub-Sahelian Africa.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe <b>Aquatic</b> <b>Warbler</b> Acrocephalus paludicola {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{threatened}} Western Palearctic passerine species, classified as globally Vulnerable. With its breeding grounds relatively secure, a clear need remains for the monitoring and protection of the migration and wintering grounds of this rare and endangered migrant. Recent research has shown that the <b>Aquatic</b> <b>Warbler</b> migrates through northwest Africa in autumn and spring. The wintering grounds are apparently limited to wetlands of sub-Saharan West Africa, with records from only about 20 localities in Mauritania, Mali, Senegal and Ghana. Given the lack of knowledge of its whereabouts, we decided to use the available data to predict the wintering distribution of the <b>Aquatic</b> <b>Warbler</b> with the help of Geographic Information Systems (GIS). We used a novel approach to model the distribution of rarely recorded species, which is based on a combination of presence-only and presence-absence modelling techniques. Using the program BIOMOD, we thus generated four progressively more conservative predictions of where the <b>Aquatic</b> <b>Warbler</b> overwinters in Africa. Whereas the most permissive model predicts the <b>Aquatic</b> <b>Warbler</b> to be found in a latitudinal band stretching from the Senegal river delta all the way to the Red Sea coast, the most restrictive model suggests a much smaller area concentrated within the regions around the Senegal river delta in northern Senegal and southern Mauritania and around the Niger inundation zone in southern Mali and eastern Burkina Faso. Such model predictions may be useful guidelines to focus further field research on the <b>Aquatic</b> <b>Warbler.</b> Given the excellent model predictions in this study, this novel technique may prove useful to model the distribution of other rare and endangered species, thus providing a means to guide future survey efforts...|$|E
