5|$|Cordyline australis {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely {{cultivated}} New Zealand native trees. In Northwest Europe and other cool oceanic climates, it is very popular as an ornamental tree because it looks like <b>a</b> <b>palm</b> <b>tree.</b> Hardy forms from the coldest areas of the southern or inland South Island tolerate Northern Hemisphere conditions best, while North Island forms are much more tender. It is easily grown from fresh seed — seedlings often spontaneously appear in gardens from bird-dispersed seed — and can be grown very easily from shoot, stem and even trunk cuttings. It does well in pots and tubs.|$|E
5|$|September 16–17, 2014: Hurricane Odile's outer rainbands brought {{thunderstorms}} {{to parts}} of Southern California, as a tropical storm.

Ramallah women were famous for their distinctive dress of white linen fabric embroidered with red silk thread.
