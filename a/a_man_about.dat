The Ohio delegation to the 1876 Republican National Convention was united behind him, and Senator John Sherman did all {{in his power to}} bring Hayes the nomination. In June 1876, the convention assembled with James G. Blaine of Maine as the favorite. Blaine started with a significant lead in the delegate count but could not muster a majority. As he failed to gain votes, the delegates looked elsewhere for a nominee and settled on Hayes on the seventh ballot. The convention then selected Representative William A.

500|$|The {{character}} of John Marston {{was developed to}} be a [...] "family man". The team developed him as a nuanced character, {{as opposed to a}} straightforward hero or villain, in order to provide an interesting experience. Wiethoff considered Marston to be very determined about his goals. [...] "He was <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>about</b> things," [...] Wiethoff remarked. Technical director Ted Carson felt that Marston became interesting due to the combination of cynicism and realism. Wiethoff felt that Marston was aware that his past actions were [...] "wrong", resulting in his attempt to abandon his former life. He stated that Marston's early decisions in his life were a direct result of his need for acceptance. [...] "I don't know if he knew that what he was doing was wrong or not," [...] Wiethoff said.|$|E

500|$|In {{the right}} panel, Dyer is shown {{with his eyes}} shut, {{vomiting}} into a hand basin. In the two outer frames his figure is shadowed by arrows, pictorial devices that Bacon often used to place a sense of energy into his paintings. In this work, the arrows point to <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>about</b> to die, and according to Tóibín they scream [...] "Here!", [...] "Him!". The arrow of the right panel, according to Tóibín, points to a [...] "dead figure on the lavatory bowl, as though telling the Furies where to find him". The triptych is centralised by the lightbulb, and {{by the fact that}} Dyer faces inwards in the two outer canvasses. The triptych's composition and setting are poised to suggest instability, and the doors in each side panel are splayed outwards as if to look into the darkness of the foreground.|$|E
500|$|Braxton's second studio album, Secrets, was {{released}} in 1996. Featuring songwriting and production by Reid, Babyface, Diane Warren, R. Kelly and David Foster, the album peaked at number two on the Billboard 200 chart and was certified eight-times platinum by the RIAA. It also made the top-ten in many other countries including Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. The album features four singles, including two double A-sides. The first single, [...] "You're Makin' Me High", became Braxton's first number one single in the United States, where it topped the Hot 100 and R charts. [...] "Un-Break My Heart", the album's second single, topped the charts in the United States, Sweden, and Switzerland and peaked within the top-five in Canada, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom; it became the second biggest-selling single by a female artist in the United States. Secrets has sold about fifteen million copies worldwide. The following year, Braxton {{filed a lawsuit against}} LaFace, which asked for a release from her record contract. However, LaFace countersued, a move which prompted Braxton to file for bankruptcy. She spent the next year in a state of oblivion, but reached an agreement with LaFace the year after. Her third studio album, The Heat, {{was released}} in April 2000. The album debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 chart and topped the R/Hip-Hop Albums chart. It also reached number one in Canada and charted within the top-ten in France, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. The lead single, [...] "He Wasn't Man Enough", became another top-five Hot 100 hit in the United States for Braxton and the second single, [...] "Just Be <b>a</b> <b>Man</b> <b>About</b> It", became a top-ten R hit. The Heat was certified double platinum by the RIAA and has sold four million copies worldwide. Braxton released her first Christmas album, Snowflakes, the next year. Her fifth studio album More Than a Woman {{was released in}} 2002. In the United States the album charted within the top-twenty and also received a gold certification.|$|E

2500|$|Many critics found {{fault with}} the plot, and in 1865, The New York Times [...] {{described}} it as an [...] "involved plot combined with an entire absence of the skill to manage and unfold it". In the London Review, in the same year, an anonymous critic felt that [...] "the whole plot in which the deceased Harmon, Boffin, Wegg, and John Rokesmith, are concerned, is wild and fantastic, wanting in reality, and leading to a degree of confusion which is not compensated by any additional interest in the story" [...] and he also found that [...] "the final explanation is a disappointment." [...] However, the London Review also thought, that [...] "the mental state of <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>about</b> to commit the greatest of crimes has seldom been depicted with such elaboration and apparent truthfulness." ...|$|E
2500|$|Flappers were {{associated}} with the use of a number of slang words, including [...] "junk", [...] "necker", [...] "heavy petting", and [...] "necking parties", although these words existed before the 1920s. Flappers also used the word [...] "jazz" [...] in the sense of anything exciting or fun. Their language sometimes reflected their feelings about dating, marriage and drinking habits: [...] "I have to see <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>about</b> a dog" [...] at this period often meant going to buy whiskey; and a [...] "handcuff" [...] or [...] "manacle" [...] was an engagement or wedding ring. Also reflective of their preoccupations were phrases to express approval, such as [...] "That's so Jake",(okay); [...] "That's the [...] ", (a superb person); [...] "Cake-eater," [...] (a ladies' man); and the popular: [...] "the ," [...] (anything wonderful).|$|E
2500|$|Other {{expressions}} include [...] "squirting" [...] and [...] "taking a leak", and, predominantly by younger persons {{for outdoor}} female urination, [...] "popping a squat", {{referring to the}} position many women adopt in such circumstances.

Australian English has coined [...] "I am off to take a Chinese singing lesson", derived from the tinkling sound of urination against the China porcelain of a toilet bowl. British English uses [...] "going to see my aunt", [...] "going to see <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>about</b> a dog", [...] "to piddle", [...] "to splash (one's) boots", as well as [...] "to have a slash", which originates from the Scottish term for a large splash of liquid.

2500|$|With the {{retirement}} of President Ulysses S. Grant after two terms, the Republicans had to settle on a new candidate for the 1876 election. Hayes's success as Governor of Ohio immediately elevated him to the top ranks of Republican politicians under consideration for the presidency, alongside James G. Blaine of Maine, Senator Oliver P. Morton of Indiana, and Senator Roscoe Conkling of New York. Despite {{the strength of the}} other candidates, the Ohio delegation to the 1876 Republican National Convention was united behind Hayes, and Senator John Sherman did all in his power to aid the nomination to his fellow Ohioan. In June 1876, the convention assembled in Hayes's hometown of Cincinnati with Blaine as the favorite. Hayes did not see himself as the favorite to win the presidential nomination, but made an effort to position himself as a potential compromise candidate. Hayes placed fifth on the first ballot of the convention, behind Blaine, Morton, Secretary of the Treasury Benjamin Bristow, and Conkling. After six ballots, Blaine remained in the lead, but on the seventh ballot, Blaine's adversaries rallied around Hayes, granting the presidential nomination to the latter. The convention then selected Representative William A. Wheeler of New York for Vice President, <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>about</b> whom Hayes had recently asked, [...] "I am ashamed to say: who is Wheeler?" [...] Hayes's views were largely in accord with the party platform, which called for equal rights for all (including women), continued Reconstruction, the prohibition of public funding for sectarian schools, and the resumption of specie payments. Hayes's nomination was well received by the press, with even Democratic papers describing Hayes as honest and likable. In a public letter accepting the nomination, Hayes vowed to support civil service reform and pledged to serve for only one term.|$|E
