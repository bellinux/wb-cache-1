2500|$|The {{first two}} Lunar Modules to fly, Apollo 5 and Apollo 9, also carried {{a pair of}} VHF scimitar antennas for the {{transmission}} of Developmental Flight Instrumentation (DFI) telemetry data. [...] One was located on the front face, just inboard of the right-hand side cockpit window, {{and the other was}} located {{on the left side of}} the <b>aft</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>bay.</b> [...] Since the Lunar Module never operated in the Earth's atmosphere, no aerodynamic covering was necessary, and the scimitar shape was externally visible. [...] After Apollo 9, the Lunar Module was considered operational, so the DFI and scimitar antennas were not present on subsequent flights.|$|E
50|$|The Command Module {{could be}} {{modified}} to carry extra astronauts as passengers by adding jump seat couches in the <b>aft</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>bay.</b> CM-119 was fitted with two jump seats as a Skylab Rescue vehicle, which was never used.|$|E

50|$|On the interior, {{the first}} floor {{originally}} housed and <b>equipment</b> <b>bay</b> {{on one end of}} the building, and stables on the other end. The interior is finished with plaster and lath with wood wainscoting and some wood paneling between the <b>equipment</b> <b>bay</b> and the stables. The original flooring cork pine, but this flooring was replaced with terrazzo early in the life of the building. The terrazzo includes red colored inlays outlining vehicle tires tracks and an 'NFD' badge in the center. In the 1930's the stables were removed and a concrete slab installed in the former stables ti support another <b>equipment</b> <b>bay.</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} define random {{vibration}} test requirements for Galileo bus-mounted hardware, an extensive vibroacoustics test program {{was conducted on}} hardware available from the previous Voyager spacecraft development program. The Galileo test program consisted of acoustic tests on three configurations of the Voyager Dynamic Test Model bus and shaker random vibration tests on two flight-like bus <b>equipment</b> <b>bay</b> assemblies and one dummy <b>equipment</b> <b>bay</b> assembly. The primary goal of the acoustic tests was to define vibration levels at locations on the bus structure representative of inputs to bus <b>equipment</b> <b>bay</b> assemblies and to obtain response data on bus bay subassemblies for correlation with the vibration tests response data. The {{primary purpose of the}} vibration tests was to determine if the vibration tests excited subassembly responses at least as severely as the bus acoustic tests...|$|R

50|$|The OAMS had 16 small, fixed-position, fixed-thrust rocket engines which burned hypergolic {{propellants}} (monomethylhydrazine fuel using {{nitrogen tetroxide}} as oxidizer) fed {{under pressure from}} a pair of tanks located in the <b>aft</b> <b>Equipment</b> Module. Besides providing attitude control, the OAMS provided for linear up, down, sideways, forward or aft translation of the spacecraft. This gave the spacecraft the capability to change its orbit, required for space rendezvous and docking with another spacecraft, the Agena Target Vehicle.The system was also used to push the spacecraft away from the spent second stage of the Titan II launch vehicle on first reaching orbit.|$|R
50|$|The Old Central Fire Station is a {{historic}} former fire station at 506 Main Street in North Little Rock, Arkansas. It is a two story brick building, with a three-bay front facade dominated by a large <b>equipment</b> <b>bay</b> on the ground floor, now enclosed by glass doors. The building, whose construction date is not known, was acquired by the city in 1904, shortly after its incorporation, and initially housed city offices, the jail, and the fire station. In 1914 the town offices were moved to North Little Rock City Hall, and in 1923 the building's original two <b>equipment</b> <b>bays</b> were replaced by one. The horse stalls were also removed, as the new equipment was powered by gasoline engines. The building served as the city's main fire station until 1961.|$|R
