5|$|By {{the middle}} of the 2000s (decade), the {{increased}} Indian gaming that McCain had helped bring <b>about</b> <b>was</b> a $23billion industry. He was twice chairman of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, in 1995–1997 and 2005–2007, and his Committee helped expose the Jack Abramoff Indian lobbying scandal. By 2005 and 2006, McCain was pushing for amendments to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act that would limit creation of off-reservation casinos, as well as limiting the movement of tribes across state lines to build casinos.|$|E
5|$|The Great Vowel Shift {{affected}} the stressed long vowels of Middle English. It was a chain shift, meaning that each shift triggered a subsequent {{shift in the}} vowel system. Mid and open vowels were raised, and close vowels were broken into diphthongs. For example, the word bite was originally pronounced as the word beet is today, and the second vowel in the word <b>about</b> <b>was</b> pronounced as the word boot is today. The Great Vowel Shift explains many irregularities in spelling, since English retains many spellings from Middle English, and it also explains why English vowel letters have very different pronunciations from the same letters in other languages.|$|E
5|$|The {{conjunction}} of several planets which Brad Dourif's character Dennis Hoffman speaks <b>about</b> <b>was</b> reliably predicted {{at the time}} of the episode's broadcast. The effects of such an alignment had been debated for some time, with studies both linking conjunction to several major earthquakes and debunking the theory entirely. Several similar alignments have occurred in the past without resulting in any additional natural activity on Earth. The predicted conjunction did occur in May 2000, with no consequence on Earth.|$|E

5|$|A second scandal {{occurred}} in 1936 when Blamey attempted {{to cover up}} details of the shooting of the superintendent of the Criminal Investigation Branch, John O'Connell Brophy, whom Blamey had appointed to the post. The story put <b>about</b> <b>was</b> that Brophy had taken two women friends and a chauffeur along with him to a meeting with a police informant. While {{they were waiting for}} the informant, they had been approached by armed bandits, and Brophy had opened fire and had himself been wounded. In order to cover up the identities of the two women involved, Blamey initially issued a press release to the effect that Brophy had accidentally shot himself (three times). The Premier, Albert Dunstan, gave Blamey the choice of resigning or being dismissed. The latter meant the loss of pension rights and any future prospects of employment in the Public Service or the Army. He reluctantly submitted his resignation on 9 July 1936.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{invasion}} of Yugoslavia by the Axis powers and their creation of the Independent State of Croatia, Stojanović was arrested {{at the behest of}} the Ustaše, Croatia's fascist ruling party. He escaped prison and went to Kozara, where he joined fellow communists that had escaped from Prijedor. The KPJ chose Stojanović to lead the communist uprising in Prijedor. The uprising began on 30July 1941, although neither Stojanović nor any of the other communists had much control over it at this stage. The Serb villagers of the district seized control of a number of villages and threatened Prijedor, which was defended by the Germans, Ustaše, and Croatian Home Guards. In August 1941, Stojanović was recognised as the principal leader of the Kozara insurgents, who were then organised into Partisan military units. Under Stojanović's direction, the Kozara Partisans began attacking the fascists from the end of September 1941. In early November 1941, all Partisan units in Kozara were merged into the 2nd Krajina National Liberation Partisan Detachment, commanded by Stojanović. By the end of the year, most of Kozaracovering <b>about</b> <b>was</b> controlled by Stojanović's detachment.|$|E

From the Russian point of view Elizabeth's greatness as a stateswoman consists in her steady appreciation of Russian interests, and her determination to promote them at all hazards. She insisted throughout that the King of Prussia must be rendered harmless to his neighbors for the future, and {{that the only way to}} bring this <b>about</b> <b>was</b> to reduce him to the rank of a Prince-Elector.|$|E
