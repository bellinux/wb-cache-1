5|$|The choreography for {{the ballet}} was {{elaborated}} by the ballerina's father, Filippo Taglioni. The audience's prurient delight in this scandalous scene is well conveyed by the reviewer for the Revue des Deux-Mondes: A crowd of mute shades glides through the arches. All these women cast off their nuns' costume, they {{shake off the}} cold powder of the grave; suddenly they throw themselves into the delights of their past life; they dance like bacchantes, they play like lords, they drink like sappers. What <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> these light women... The set for the ballet was an innovative and striking design by Henri Duponchel and Pierre-Luc-Charles Ciceri. Duponchel had also introduced technical innovations for the staging, including 'English traps' for the sudden appearance and disappearance of the ghosts. (Meyerbeer was led to complain that the spectacle was too much and was pushing his music into the background). Taglioni danced the Abbess only six times in Paris; she was replaced by Louise Fitzjames, (who danced the role 232 times).|$|E

It received good reviews, was very popular, and Karthi's performances was praised by critics. Sreedhar Pillai wrote for Sify: [...] " [...] nails the character to perfection"...He is one good reason to see the film." [...] Bhama Devi Ravi of Times of India wrote: [...] "...what <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Karthi deliver his best performance to date...". Rediff wrote that [...] "Karthi has simply had a ball..." [...] and [...] "It's {{been a long time}} since you saw an actor who can be as convincing in sadness and rage, as in happiness." [...] Naan Mahaan Alla was dubbed into Telugu and released as Naa Peru Shiva in 2011; it was very successful and earned Karthi some Telugu film offers.|$|E
500|$|Barrymore's {{first film}} for MGM was the 1932 mystery Arsène Lupin, {{in which he}} co-starred with his brother Lionel. [...] In The New York Times, Hall called Barrymore's {{performance}} [...] "admirable" [...] and wrote that [...] "it is <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> [...] again in something in a lighter vein." [...] The same year, Barrymore starred as jewel thief Baron Felix von Geigern together with Greta Garbo in the 1932 film Grand Hotel, in which Lionel also appeared. Critical opinion of Barrymore's acting was divided; John Gilbert's biographer Eve Golden refers to Barrymore as seeming [...] "more like... affectionate father than her lover", while George Blaisdell of International Photographer praised the dialogue and wrote that a viewer would be [...] "deeply impressed with the rarity in screen drama on which he is looking." [...] Grand Hotel won the Academy Award for Best Picture {{and was one of}} the highest-grossing films of the year. It was later added to the National Film Registry.|$|E

2500|$|If I {{wished to}} take the results of my {{philosophy}} as the standard of truth, I should have to concede to Buddhism pre-eminence over the others.

And this agreement must be yet the more pleasing to me, inasmuch as in my philosophizing I have certainly not been under its influence [...] For up till 1818, when my work appeared, there was to be found in Europe only a very few accounts of Buddhism.|$|R
60|$|And {{she brought}} out a slice of cold bacon, and some bread, and warmed some beer at the fire. She would go without bacon and beer herself to- morrow, but that was nothing to her. It was <b>a</b> real <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the colour come into Paul's bony yellow cheeks at the hearty meal, which he could not refuse; {{but he did not}} speak much, for he was tired out, and the fire and the beer were making him very sleepy.|$|R

60|$|A {{hundred or}} more horses grazed in the grassy meadow, and as Jean rode on among {{them it was}} <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> stallions throw heads and ears up and whistle or snort. Whole troops of colts and two-year-olds raced with flying tails and manes.|$|E
60|$|It {{filled him}} with <b>a</b> {{momentary}} <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> wry stick of purple black flash out into {{the form of a}} snake, and vanish amidst the brown. After all, the infernal valley WAS alive. And then, to rejoice him still more, came a little breath across his face, a whisper that came and went, the faintest inclination of a stiff black-antlered bush upon a little crest, the first intimations of a possible breeze. Idly he wetted his finger, and held it up.|$|R

2500|$|Writing in the Sunday Express on 30 December 2007, Marshall Julius {{described}} the 2007 Christmas special as [...] "so cosy and old-fashioned that I {{could easily have}} dismissed it with a cynical wave".

60|$|In two {{or three}} minutes there was another knock, and Mr. Hubbard himself, the celebrated frame-maker of South Audley Street, came in with a {{somewhat}} rough-looking young assistant. Mr. Hubbard was a florid, red-whiskered little man, whose admiration for art was considerably tempered by the inveterate impecuniosity of most of the artists who dealt with him. As a rule, he never left his shop. He waited for people to come to him. But he always made an exception in favour of Dorian Gray. There was something about Dorian that charmed everybody. It was <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> even <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him.|$|R

There was soul in her, real hopes I should be happy, while Jane seemed only to think it tolerable, because I might end in being an ambassadress. I will see her again before the party, and draw my own conclusions.' ...|$|E
60|$|Almighty! {{how those}} men fought, {{especially}} Jan and Ralph. It was <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> them, for I watched {{the whole thing}} from the stoep, though I admit that I was anxious, since {{it was evident that}} neither of them seemed to care whether he lived or died. However, as it turned out, it was not they who died, but the Kaffirs, who went off with some few cattle and afterwards left us in peace.|$|E

It’s <b>a</b> rare <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> film made with such an elegant compositional eye... Deep-focus shots of Lyokha at his most pensive, standing on the shores of the lake, are loaded with a sense of place, and of belonging. The same goes for the hypnotic Steadycam sequences of him zooming along in his boat, the sound of the motor quietly giving way to a slow build of electronica composer Eduard Artemyev’s stirring ambient score with choral elements." ...|$|R
60|$|It gave me <b>a</b> {{malicious}} <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that I had startled {{the unknown}} dispenser of shocks {{quite as much}} as he had startled me. The movement he made as he faced towards my direction was almost a leap; and it suddenly flashed upon me that I had better at once establish my identity as a non-combatant. I appeared to have wandered inadvertently into the midst of a private quarrel, one party to which--the one standing a couple of yards from me with a loaded revolver in his hand--was evidently a man of impulse, the sort of man who would shoot first and inquire afterwards.|$|R
