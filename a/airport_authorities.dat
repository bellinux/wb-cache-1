5|$|As Prapiroon neared Hong Kong, {{thousands}} of people were stranded in airports as hundreds of flights {{in and out of the}} area were cancelled. Twenty cargo containers in the harbour were tipped over and one person was injured by the falling containers. A total of 381 flights were cancelled and 725 were delayed, affecting about 10million people. Compensation costs from the travel delays amounted to $1.9million (2006USD). According to <b>airport</b> <b>authorities,</b> the storm caused the worst disruption in the airport's 20-year history. Winds were recorded up to 103km/h (63mph) in the harbour. The highest gust was recorded on Green Island at 193km/h (119mph). Seven people were injured by objects blown around by the wind. A cargo vessel, with a crew of 23, ran aground near the harbour. No injuries were reported from the incident. Two other incidents with vessels occurred near Ma Wan and Tuen Mun. Seven hundred trees were blown down and another 1,600 sustained damage. Maximum rainfall from Prapiroon was estimated at 8.1in (207.5mm). Two landslides were also reported and about 200 hectares of farmland was damaged. A storm surge of 2.71m (8.89ft) was recorded.|$|E
5|$|On May 3, 1969, while Hendrix {{was passing}} through customs at Toronto International <b>Airport,</b> <b>authorities</b> {{detained}} him after finding {{a small amount}} of what they suspected to be heroin and hashish in his luggage. Four hours later, he was formally charged with drug possession and released on $10,000 bail. He was required to return on May 5 for an arraignment hearing. The incident proved stressful for Hendrix, and it weighed heavily on his mind during the seven months that he awaited trial, which took place in December of that year. For the Crown to prove possession they had to show that Hendrix knew the drugs were there. During the jury trial he testified that a fan had given him a vial of what he thought was legal medication, which he put in his bag not knowing what was in it. He was acquitted of the charges. Mitchell and Redding later revealed that everyone had been warned about a planned drug bust the day before flying to Toronto; both men also stated they believed that the drugs had been planted in Hendrix's bag without his knowledge.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} {{invasion}} of Norway by Nazi Germany on 9 April 1940, German Luftwaffe-aircraft landed at Fornebu. There was no attempt by the civilian <b>airport</b> <b>authorities</b> to hinder this, such as driving cars onto the runway, although several German aircraft collided with each other during the landing. A KLM aircraft had a scheduled service that morning, and the captain was ordered to leave the passengers, take the crew and return to Oslo. On 12 April, the airport was bombed by the British Royal Air Force. On 14 April, the KLM captain was granted permission to fly back to Amsterdam with the crew, albeit without any passengers. The German military used Fornebu heavily during the war, {{but it was never}} of any strategic importance, since it was located far from any battle zones. During the war, the airport officially remained owned by the municipality. By orders of the German authorities, the main north–south runway was expanded to , and all facilities not yet built were completed. However, during the war all other runways than the main north–south were taken out of use. At {{the north end of the}} runway, the Luftwaffe built several hangars and a prison camp. Prisoners were used to keep the runways free of snow during winter, by marching along them and stomping the snow down.|$|E

25|$|Despite this conclusion, the German <b>airport</b> <b>authorities</b> took {{legal action}} against Captain Thain, as the one pilot who had survived the crash.

De-icing the aircraft was the captain's responsibility, while {{the state of the}} airport's runways was the responsibility of the <b>airport</b> <b>authorities,</b> among whom there was widespread ignorance of the danger of slush on runways for aircraft such as the Ambassador.|$|E

25|$|An {{investigation}} by West German <b>airport</b> <b>authorities</b> originally blamed Thain, {{saying he did}} not de-ice the aircraft's wings, despite eyewitness statements to the contrary.

25|$|With a {{new airport}} under consideration, {{the project for}} a {{parallel}} runway {{has been put on}} hold and the total land required for the airport expansion reduced from 1,069.99 acres to 800 acres. AAI planned to operate 2,400m even after removing obstructions. About 2,085m of the runway was earlier used for landing only smaller aircraft, like ATR types. In February 2012, <b>airport</b> <b>authorities</b> announced that only about 2,160m of the secondary runway would be operational as there will be 330m permanent displacement at GST road side and 780m displacement at the other end. This restricted length would be enough to operate Airbus A320 and Boeing 737 aircraft without load penalty. Bad planning by the <b>airport</b> <b>authorities,</b> which has resulted in the removal of the very-high-frequency omni range equipment (VOR) from its original location where a link way has been constructed between the main and the secondary runways, has been considered the reason behind the delay.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{spectacular}} crash of Court Line and Clarksons {{at the height}} of the 1974 holiday season, the failed carrier's fairly new aircraft were acquired by other airlines.

These aircraft needed to be re-registered to avoid having them impounded by overseas <b>airport</b> <b>authorities</b> in lieu of the airport user charges Court Line owed them.|$|E

25|$|For flights {{within the}} Schengen Area (either between Schengen member states or {{within the same}} Schengen member state), law {{enforcement}} agencies, <b>airport</b> <b>authorities</b> and air carriers are only permitted to carry out security checks on passengers and may not carry out border checks. Such security checks can be conducted through the verification of the passenger's passport or national identity card: Such a practice must only be used to verify the passenger's identity (for commercial or transport security reasons) and not his or her immigration status. For this reason, law enforcement agencies, <b>airport</b> <b>authorities</b> and air carriers cannot require air passengers flying within the Schengen Area who are third-country nationals to prove the legality of their stay by showing a valid visa or residence permit. In addition, according to European Commission guidelines, identity checks on air passengers flying within the Schengen Area should take place only either at check-in, or upon entry to the secured zone of the airport, or at the boarding gate: passengers should {{not be required to}} undergo a verification of their identity {{on more than one occasion}} before their flight within the Schengen Area. Nevertheless, the identity checks function as practical border controls anyway, and are a problem for illegal immigrants who arrive in Greece (which has no land border to another Schengen country) and want to go to some other Schengen country. The requirements as to which identity document to possess varies by country and airline. Normally a passport or EU national identity card is needed. Greece, Iceland and Malta do not share land borders with other Schengen member states.|$|E
25|$|In September 2017, {{the body}} of Randy Potter, 53, of Lenexa, Kansas, was found in his truck in Economy Lot B.

The apparent failure of this system to locate Potter's truck for eight months has led to a investigation by city government.|$|E
25|$|The non-aviation {{forecasting}} work, including cyclone warnings, is supervised and co-ordinated by the ACWC at Regional Meteorological Centre, Chennai, {{by means}} of the Cyclone Detection Radar. The Cyclone Detection Radars are located at Chennai, Machilipatnam, Vishakhapatnam, Karaikal and Kochi which track tropical cyclones over the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea. The Cyclone Detection Radar Station in Chennai is located at the Port Trust Building of the Chennai Port. Data from this Doppler radar is currently being used by the Chennai airport. The aviation weather forecasting activities, which are required by pilots and <b>airport</b> <b>authorities,</b> are controlled and coordinated by the Aerodrome Meteorological Office at Chennai Airport in Meenambakkam.
