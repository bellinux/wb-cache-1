5|$|Professor Pete Wilson, {{on behalf}} of English Heritage's Portico Properties Research Project, has {{suggested}} questions for future research and investigation of the site, including: excavation to establish its date and function; examination of historic documentation for medieval mention of use of the monument as a route or in a boundary dispute; <b>and</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> site via a detailed aerial survey, lidar or other remote sensing technique to establish {{the extent of the}} monument beyond the length so far excavated.|$|E

The team was led by a game director, Agent 12, and two co-directors, ZeaLitY and Chrono'99. To create a story that was compatible with Chrono Trigger and Chrono Cross, the team took full advantage of the Chrono Compendium's encyclopedia and the fandom's knowledge <b>and</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> series.|$|E

5|$|The Nefertiti bust {{has become}} a {{cultural}} symbol of Berlin as well as ancient Egypt. Nefertiti herself has become quite an icon. Nefertiti is widely known for her beauty and versatility. It has also {{been the subject of}} an intense argument between Egypt and Germany over Egyptian demands for its repatriation. It was dragged into controversy by the Body of Nefertiti art exhibition and also by doubts over its authenticity. However various testing <b>and</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bust have proved it to be authentic.|$|E

5|$|Due {{partly to}} their ready {{availability}} and {{the ease with}} which they may be grown in the laboratory, C.micaceus and other coprinoid mushrooms were common subjects in cytological studies of the 19th and 20th centuries. The German botanist Johann Heinrich Friedrich Link reported his observations {{of the structure of the}} hymenium (the fertile spore-bearing surface) in 1809, but misinterpreted what he had seen. Link thought that microscopic structures known today as basidia were thecae, comparable in form to the asci of the Ascomycetes, and that each theca contained four series of spores. His inaccurate drawings of the hymenium of C.micaceus were copied in subsequent mycological publications by other authors, and it was not until microscopy had advanced that mycologists were able to determine the true nature of the basidia, when nearly three decades later in 1837 Joseph-Henri Léveillé and August Corda independently published correct descriptions of the structure of the hymenium. In 1924, A. H. Reginald Buller published a comprehensive description <b>and</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> processes of spore production and release in the third volume of his Researches on Fungi.|$|E

5|$|Pilot {{whales are}} {{cetaceans}} {{belonging to the}} genus Globicephala. The two extant species are the long-finned pilot whale (G. melas) and the short-finned pilot whale (G. macrorhynchus). The two are not readily distinguishable at sea, <b>and</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> skulls {{is the best way}} to distinguish between the species. Between the two species, they range nearly worldwide, with long-finned pilot whales living in colder waters and short-finned pilot whales living in tropical and subtropical waters. Pilot whales are among the largest of the oceanic dolphins, exceeded in size only by the killer whale. They and other large members of the dolphin family are also known as blackfish.|$|E

The Battle Ultimania {{provides a}} description <b>and</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new battle {{system and its}} components, and developer interviews. The Scenario Ultimania describes the main scenarios in the game, profiles on the characters and areas in Ivalice, developer interviews, and details on each location. The last guide, the Ultimania Ω, includes voice actor interviews, the complete story of Final Fantasy XII including additional character profiles, a collection of artworks and illustrations, the complete play guide, and a novella written by Benny Matsuyama, author of Hoshi wo Meguru Otome from the Final Fantasy VII Ultimania Ω Guide. Another Ultimania edition, the Final Fantasy XII International Zodiac Job System Ultimania, was released on September 6, 2007, as a guide book for the international version of the game. On December 18, 2012 the game was re-released {{as part of the}} Final Fantasy 25th Anniversary Ultimate Box Japanese package.|$|E
5|$|The {{preliminary}} experimentation for {{the modern}} restoration began in 1979. The restoration team comprised Gianluigi Colalucci, Maurizio Rossi, Piergiorgio Bonetti, and others, who took as their guidelines the Rules for restoration {{of works of art}} as established in 1978 by Carlo Pietrangeli, director of the Vatican's Laboratory for the Restoration of Pictures, which govern the procedure and methods employed in restoration. An important part of modern restoration procedure, as established by these rules, is the study <b>and</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> artwork. Part of this was the recording of every stage of the restoration process. This was done by the photographer Takashi Okamura for Nippon Television Network Corporation.|$|E
