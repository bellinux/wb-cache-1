5|$|With Misery we had {{the luxury}} of doing a two-day shoot, which is totally luxurious these days. <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> do what we love the most, which is just fashion and making {{beautiful}} images, and not having any rules. It was very much on the fly. We went downtown to the abandoned Sears building; it’s all destroyed and creepy in there. We were there for two days and it was like an art project.|$|E
500|$|The {{nonlinear}} narrative involving Joan's storyline and Don's Jaguar pitch was [...] "a {{solution to}} how to tell the story" [...] according to Weiner. [...] "The ordering of those events really was a problem <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> {{a point where we}} can either show Don doing the pitch, or show Joan being with the guy, but we can't do them both," [...] he said, explaining that he felt [...] "if Don gives the pitch after [...] seen Joan do this, {{no one is going to}} listen to a word that he says. It doesn't matter how good it is. [...] not going to believe he could have won." ...|$|E

You're {{talking about people}} living {{together}} from the ages of seventeen to twenty-two and that's a growing up {{part of your life}} <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> hate each other, no doubt about it. We didn't speak to each other for fucking years. Maybe ten years." [...] – Marriott ...|$|E
60|$|The {{conversation}} turned {{upon the}} Bishop, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> Ernest <b>to</b> explain {{what he had}} been doing with him.|$|R
60|$|The captain made us {{trim the}} boat, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> her <b>to</b> lie {{a little more}} evenly. All the same, we were afraid to breathe.|$|R
6000|$|So they {{softened}} {{down and}} said it was all right; <b>and</b> when <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> the village they yawled us ashore. About two dozen men flocked down when they see the yawl a-coming, and when the king says: ...|$|R
60|$|He {{ordered a}} cup of coffee. He said {{he was waiting for}} someone, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> chatting about old times.|$|E
60|$|Strickland shaded {{his eyes}} with his hands for a moment <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> work. This part {{is not to be}} printed.|$|E
6000|$|... "His connection!" [...] said Mrs. Coombes scornfully. [...] "That's what he's always a-saying. We {{got to do}} this, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> do that--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I heard {{something}} about it," [...] Brown replied. [...] "All the same, Cartwright sent us {{to lift her}} <b>and</b> <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> try. Will you let me hire some of your factory boys?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he said, though Jimmy had not spoken, [...] "old man Leeson is right; we {{will have}} to fight for it. Still, I have put my pile in, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> win." ...|$|R
5000|$|Mangione has {{described}} the process of composing the instrumental's music, saying that his [...] "vision was {{to think about the}} athletes and their efforts to do their best now. They're giving it all they've <b>got.</b> <b>And</b> <b>we</b> almost <b>got</b> <b>to</b> be like the athletes because <b>we</b> also <b>got</b> <b>to</b> perform the song at the ceremonies for a worldwide audience." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's the way I feel, too, Jim. But we've {{got them}} on our hands, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> {{remember}} what they are, and make allowances. Sometimes I wish we could hear of a country that's out of kings." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We met at Grindelwald, you know. He always {{calls me}} his Ice Maiden because {{we first got}} to know each other on the skating rink. Quite romantic, wasn't it? Then we asked him to tea one day, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> be quite friendly. Then he proposed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's that or go," [...] she said. [...] "There ain't a livin' {{for us on}} {{the farm}} any more, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> do somethin'. If there was {{anything}} else I could do! But I've thought it out and thought it out, and I guess there ain't anything I can do but take boarders--if I can get them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{might have}} waited {{a few minutes}} longer," [...] Jerry grumbled, [...] "then we should have had our tea comfortable. Now the fire is out and the water is spilt, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> fetch in some more snow; that is the last lot there was melted." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Will {{you be so}} good as {{to tell me what}} you're talking about?" [...] Delia enquired sternly. [...] "Where is it printed <b>and</b> {{what have}} <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> do with it?" ...|$|R
60|$|It was a cool, gray {{afternoon}} <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> back <b>to</b> Green Gables just as {{the rain}} was beginning to fall. When we went {{up to my room}} the wind was rising and whistling through the boughs of the big old Snow Queen outside of my window. Diana was excited, and, I really believe, a little bit frightened.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, we can't {{always tell}} {{ourselves}} from these Dutch. But they know us, and they don't want us, except just for one thing, and that's our money. I tell you, the Americans are the chumps over here. Soon's they got all our money, or think they have, they say, 'Here, you Americans, {{this is my}} country; you get off;' <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> get. Ever been over before?" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{descent from}} the top of the pass was much steeper and more severe than the ascent had been, and the train of mules was a very long time making its way to the bottom. Every animal that fell, every load which shifted, brought the whole line to a standstill. However, {{patience}} and care will effect wonders; <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> the foot of the steep portion without a casualty among the animals.|$|E
6000|$|... "There's a lot {{of these}} fellows," [...] Babbitt was {{complaining}} to his wife, [...] "that think if workmen go on strike they're a regular bunch of fiends. Now, of course, it's a fight between sound business and the destructive element, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> lick the stuffin's out of 'em when they challenge us, but doggoned if I see why we can't fight like gentlemen and not go calling 'em dirty dogs and saying they ought to be shot down." ...|$|E
50|$|Gopi Chand (Krishna Bhagavan): He is {{a friend}} of Divakaram. By the words of colony people <b>and</b> Divakaram <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> know about his {{business}} and he kills his friend when he refuses to marry his sister after running an affair with her. Finally, he is killed {{in the hands of the}} doctor played by Shubha, for which Divakaram goes to jail.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{just what}} I {{was telling the}} boys last night. There were {{two or three of}} them from Traverse staying at the hotel, <b>and</b> when <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> talking about the hail they allowed that he'd have to cut the creamery plan out. I said that when Elcot Hunter took a thing up he stayed with it until he put it through." ...|$|R
5000|$|Nordsjaelland {{head coach}} Morten Wieghorst applauded Queen of the South's {{efforts in the}} Scottish side's defeat. [...] "I must give lot of credit to Queens, my players looked under pressure. They couldn't handle {{it in the first}} half <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> off <b>to</b> a dreadful start with the early goal for Queens. Overall, I think Queens had more chances than us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was leading}} a horse," [...] said Slocum, [...] "and I met Harry, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> talking, and {{something}} I said made him mad, and he jerked out his knife and jumped at me. The horse got scared and yanked me around, and just then Harry got his knife into me. I {{saw he was}} in for my life and I threw down the whip and run, the blood a-spurting out o' me, hot as b'ilin' water. I was scared, I admit that. I thought he'd opened a big artery in me, and I guess he did." ...|$|E
6000|$|Personally, before I {{consented to}} accept the chairmanship, which carried with it a salary of £100 a year (which I never got), I bought and paid for in cash, shares {{to the value of}} £1,000 sterling. I {{remember}} that Jacob and his friends seemed surprised at this act of mine, as they had offered to give me five hundred of their shares for nothing [...] "in consideration of the guarantee of my name." [...] These I refused, saying that I would not ask others to invest in a venture in which I had no actual money stake; whereon they accepted my decision, not without enthusiasm. In the end the balance of £4,000 was subscribed <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> work. Work is a good name for it so far as I was concerned, for never in all my days have I gone through so harrowing a time.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, gentlemen, I'm {{afraid it}} is. The {{whole thing is}} going to turn on the tariff {{question}}. I wish it were otherwise. I think it madness, but they're bent on it, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> fight it on that line. Why they can't fight it merely on the question of graft," [...] continued the old war horse, rising from his seat and walking up and down, [...] "Heaven only knows. I warned them. I appealed to them. I said, fight the thing on graft and we can win easy. Take this constituency,--why not have fought the thing out on whether I spent too much money on the town wharf or the post-office? What better issues could a man want? Let them claim that I am crooked and let me claim that I'm not. Surely that was good enough without dragging in the tariff. But now, gentlemen, tell me about things in the constituency. Is there any talk yet of who is to run?" ...|$|E
60|$|We {{went up to}} {{the cold}} weather to freeze 'em out, and stayed a little spell, and then come back to the {{comfortable}} weather and went lazying along twenty or twenty-five miles an hour, the way we'd been doing for the last few hours. The reason was, that the longer we was in that solemn, peaceful desert, the more the hurry and fuss got kind of soothed down in us, and the more happier and contented <b>and</b> satisfied <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> feeling, <b>and</b> the more <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> liking the desert, and then loving it. So we had cramped the speed down, as I was saying, and was having a most noble good lazy time, sometimes watching through the glasses, sometimes stretched out on the lockers reading, sometimes taking a nap.|$|R
6000|$|That evening Adeline {{said to her}} sister, {{at the end of}} the meagre dinner {{they allowed}} {{themselves}} in these days, [...] "Elbridge says the hay is giving out, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> do something about those horses that are eating their heads off in the barn. And the cows: there's hardly any feed for them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As {{luck would}} have it he never tumbled to a thing <b>and</b> when <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> the pond there was old Mr. Turtle lying out in the sun as if his very last day had come. He acted so sick that even though I knew he'd never had a tooth in his head I almost began to believe he really did have the toothache.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{you know}} how it is. You meet a guy who's been in the same line of {{business}} as yourself and you find you've got a heap to talk about. I'd never happened across the gink Whiting, but I knew of him, and, of course, he'd heard of me, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> discussing things. I seen him lose on a foul to Tommy King in the eighteenth round out in Los Angeles, and that kept us busy talking, him having it that he hadn't gone within a mile of fouling Tommy and me saying I'd been in a ring-seat and had the goods on him same as if I'd taken a snap-shot. Well, we was both getting pretty hot under the collar about it when suddenly there's the blazes of a noise behind us, and there's the two kids scrapping all over the lot. The Whiting kid had started it, mind you, and him ten pounds heavier than Bill, and tough, too." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was never}} after dark she came, but {{daylight}} always, {{as far as}} I mind, but wanst, and that was on a Hallow Eve night. My mother was by the fire, making ready the supper; she had a duck down and some apples. In slips the Wee Woman, 'I'm come to pass my Hallow Eve with you,' says she. 'That's right,' says my mother, and thinks to herself, 'I can give her her supper nicely.' Down she sits by the fire a while. 'Now I'll tell you where you'll bring my supper,' says she. 'In the room beyond there beside the loom--set a chair in and a plate.' 'When ye're spending the night, mayn't ye as well sit by the table and eat {{with the rest of}} us?' 'Do what you're bid, and set whatever you give me in the room beyant. I'll eat there and nowhere else.' So my mother sets her a plate of duck and some apples, whatever was going, in where she bid, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> our supper and she to hers; and when we rose I went in, and there, lo and behold ye, was her supper-plate a bit ate of each portion, and she clean gone!" ...|$|E
60|$|MY DEAR COLVIN,--I {{got back}} on Monday night, after twenty-three hours in an open boat; the keys were lost; the consul (who had promised us a bottle of Burgundy) nobly broke open his storeroom, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> bed about midnight. Next morning the blessed consul promised us horses for the daybreak; forgot all about it, worthy man; set us off at last {{in the heat of}} the day, and by a short cut which caused {{infinite}} trouble, and we were not home till dinner. I was extenuated, and have had a high fever since, or should have been writing before. To-day for the first time, I risk it. Tuesday I was pretty bad; Wednesday had a fever to kill a horse; Thursday I was better, but still out of ability to do aught but read awful trash. This is the time one misses civilisation; I wished to send out for some police novels; Montépin would have about suited my frozen brain. It is a bother when all one's thought turns on one's work in some sense or other; I could not even think yesterday; I took to inventing dishes by way of entertainment. Yesterday, while I lay asleep in the afternoon, a very lucky thing happened; the Chief Justice came to call; met one of our employés on the road; and was shown what I had done to the road.|$|E
6000|$|... 'And {{we must be}} up to the difference,' pursued her husband; 'we must {{be equal}} to the change; that's what we must be. We've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> hold our own now, against {{everybody}} (for everybody's hand is stretched out to be dipped into our pockets), <b>and</b> <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> recollect that money makes money, as well as makes everything else.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Unless you accustom {{yourself}} {{always to}} say [...] "Ned" [...] the other words {{are sure to}} slip out sometimes. This journey {{is going to be}} a hard one, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> share the hardships and the danger and to be comrades to each other, and so you must practise calling me Ned from the time we go on board the steamer.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "`But I {{believe in}} 'em,' {{said the boy}} Jeff, who was seated {{on the other side}} of the table, and looked at us so earnestly that we could scarce help smiling--though we didn't feel in a smiling humour at the time, for it was getting dark, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> had <b>got</b> <b>to</b> talking in low tones and looking anxiously over our shoulders, you know-- ...|$|R
