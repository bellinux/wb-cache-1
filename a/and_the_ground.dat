5|$|In the Biscay quarter, {{the wolves}} {{of the arms}} of the Haro family were {{suppressed}} in 1986 and the field changed from gules to argent, the bordure from argent to gold, the crosses from sinople to gules, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> (terrase) from sinople to maroon.|$|E
5|$|In the Gipuzkoa quarter, {{the field}} changed from argent to gold, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> (terrase) was removed, {{leaving only the}} trees and the waves.|$|E

5|$|A {{photograph}} of the building that was to house the theater appeared in The Morning Oregonian newspaper in 1913. Known as the Kleist Building after its owner, Edward Kleist, it had a pressed brick front and walls with hollow tiles. The second floor was intended for residential rooms and apartments, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> floor was designed for business storerooms and a movie theater. According to a February 1915 newspaper advertisement, The Exploits of Elaine, {{the first in a}} continuing series of Craig Kennedy detective stories, was to show at The Clinton on March 1.|$|E
5|$|After {{the initial}} ESRO program was initiated, the agency moved towards {{satellites}} {{with a higher}} orbital eccentricity and escape orbits. The facilities in Ny-Ålesund were unsuitable for telemetry with such satellites, as they would operate at a different frequency, {{the size of the}} antenna dish was too small <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> station's geographical position was out of range. Because of the change of ESRO's focus, the need for a telemetry station on Svalbard disappeared after the termination of ESRO's initial program, and the facility was closed in 1974.|$|E

5|$|After {{this the}} commandos came up against {{part of the}} Siegfried Line defences around Roermond. A short halt {{followed}} and during this time No. 6 Commando sent {{out a number of}} patrols mounted on the tanks of the 8th Hussars. In February, the snow thawed <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> turned to mud which rendered the tanks useless and as a result the commandos carried out their patrols on foot.|$|E
5|$|As of 2009, four FA Cup {{semifinal}}s {{have taken}} place at St Andrew's, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> has hosted semifinal replays on five occasions, most recently in 1961. It was the venue for the 1987 play-off final replay, in which Charlton Athletic beat Leeds United {{to remain in the}} Football League First Division, and for the final of the FA Vase in 2004 and 2006.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} early days of Sicilian Baroque, the first {{buildings}} of the new neoclassical era were often copies or hybrids of the two styles. The Palazzo Ducezio (Illustration 19) was begun in 1746, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> floor with arcades creating play of light and shadow is pure Baroque. However, when a few years later the upper floor was added, despite the use of Baroque broken pediments above the windows, the neoclassical French influence is very pronounced, highlighted by the central curved bay. The Sicilian Baroque was gradually and slowly being superseded by French neoclassicism.|$|E

5|$|At 14:06 two UH-1E Huey {{helicopters}} carrying General Carey and Colonel Gray (commander of Regimental Landing Team 4 (RLT4)) {{landed at}} the DAO Compound. During {{their approach to}} the compound, Carey and Gray got a firsthand view of the PAVN's firepower as they shelled nearby Tan Son Nhut Airport with ground, rocket, and artillery fire. They quickly established an austere command post {{in preparation for the}} arrival of the Marine CH-53s <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> security force.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{short period}} of abandonment, Park Hall was {{purchased}} from the council by Mike Harris with a view to redevelopment and The New Saints moving back to the ground. The New Saints started to use Park Hall as their regular home ground again in 2007 <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> was further improved so that it was able to host matches in the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League. It has since been used to host youth international fixtures for both England and Wales while also hosting Non-League football for community teams in Oswestry.|$|E
5|$|In 1913 the brothel was {{expanded}} again. A one-story structure {{was added to}} the building, increasing the number of cribs by eight; four of the added cribs opened directly onto Pleasant Alley, by that time known as Venus Alley. When copper prices went up, the more than 14,000 miners in the city experienced a pay-rise of twenty-five cents and injected an additional $6,000 into Butte's economy. The Dumas also experienced an upswing in patronage. As a result of the added patronage, the brothel added five partitions and a staircase in 1916, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> floor, once a grand parlor, was partitioned into cribs.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} shown that the couple created by gravity <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> {{reaction}} forces is necessary for a bicycle to turn at all. On a custom built bicycle with spring-loaded outriggers that exactly cancel this couple, so that the bicycle and rider may assume any lean angle when traveling in a straight line, riders find it impossible to make a turn. As soon as the wheels deviate from a straight path, the bicycle and rider begin to lean in the opposite direction, {{and the only way to}} right them is to steer back onto the straight path.|$|E
5|$|Kharak Singh Haveli was the haveli of Kharak Singh, {{the heir}} to Ranjit Singh. It lies in the {{south-east}} of the Jahangir's Quadrangle. It was later occupied by the British where the first <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> floor were used as a Commandant's Quarters and godown and servants house respectively. Currently it houses the archaeological survey office.|$|E
5|$|Malaysian {{investigators}} set up {{an international}} working group—the Joint Investigation Team (JIT)—consisting of various agencies with experience in aircraft performance and satellite communications, to further analyse the signals between Flight 370 <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> station, especially the signal at 08:19. These included representatives from the UK's Inmarsat, Air Accidents Investigation Branch, and Rolls-Royce; China's Civil Aviation Administration and Aircraft Accident Investigation Department; the US National Transportation Safety Board and Federal Aviation Administration; and Malaysian authorities.|$|E

5|$|Site {{testing for}} both the Commonwealth Avenue and Kings Avenue bridges took place during late 1959 to early 1960. The {{construction}} of the Kings Avenue Bridge began in 1960, followed by Commonwealth Avenue Bridge the year after. Fortunately for the builders, Canberra was in a drought <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> remained dry during construction. Both bridges use post-tensioned concrete, reinforced with rustproof steel cables.|$|E
5|$|The AH-64A then entered phase 2 of the AAH program {{under which}} three {{pre-production}} AH-64s would be built, additionally, the two YAH-64A flight prototypes <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> test unit were upgraded {{to the same}} standard. Weapons and sensor systems were integrated and tested during this time, including the laser-guided AGM-114 Hellfire missile. Development of the Hellfire missile had begun in 1974, originally known {{by the name of}} Helicopter Launched, Fire and Forget Missile ('Hellfire' being a shortened acronym), for the purpose of arming helicopter platforms with an effective anti-tank missile.|$|E
5|$|The club's {{first two}} home matches were played at another venue as Fulfordgate was not ready, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> hosted its first match against Mansfield Town in September 1922. The highest {{attendance}} at the ground was 12,721, which came against Sheffield United in an FA Cup match in 1931. York {{decided to move to}} Bootham Crescent, which had been vacated by York Cricket Club in 1932, as Fulfordgate was relatively inaccessible. The ground was sold and developed as a housing estate, and Eastward Avenue now lies at its former location.|$|E
