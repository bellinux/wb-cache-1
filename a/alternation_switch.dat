40|$|Enhancers {{are defined}} as DNA {{elements}} that increase transcription when placed in any orientation relative to a promoter. The major immediate-early (MIE) enhancer region of murine cytomegalovirus is flanked by transcription units ie 1 / 3 and ie 2, which are transcribed in opposite directions. We have addressed the fundamental mechanistic {{question of whether the}} enhancer synchronizes transcription of the bidirectional gene pair (synchronizer model) or whether it operates as a genetic switch, enhancing transcription of either gene in a stochastic <b>alternation</b> (<b>switch</b> model). Clonal analysis of cytokine-triggered, transcription factor-mediated MIE gene expression from latent viral genomes provided evidence in support of the switch model...|$|E
40|$|During {{the viewing}} of certain patterns, widely known as {{ambiguous}} or puzzle figures, perception lapses into {{a sequence of}} spontaneous <b>alternations,</b> <b>switching</b> every few seconds between two or more visual interpretations of the stimulus. Although their nature and origin remain topics of debate, these stochastic switches are generally {{thought to be the}} automatic and inevitable consequence of viewing a pattern without a unique solution. We report here that in humans such perceptual alternations can be slowed, and even brought to a standstill, if the visual stimulus is periodically removed from view. We also show, with a visual illusion, that this stabilizing effect hinges on perceptual disappearance rather than on actual removal of the stimulus. These findings indicate that uninterrupted subjective perception of an ambiguous pattern is required for the initiation of the brain-state changes underlying multistable vision...|$|R

Static Synchronous Compensator (STATCOM) is the major application of the inverter to compensate reactive power in power system. The proposed strategy is simple, high precision, fast response speed, while it has less fluctuation {{with the impact of}} load parameters, and good robust characteristics. STATCOM employing the multilevel inverter provides good performance such as enlarging capacity and decreasing even frequency harmonics, and the control of <b>alternation</b> working <b>switch</b> order based PWM can be applied in related research fields...|$|R
30|$|Torus canards were {{originally}} identified in a fifth order {{model of a}} Purkinje cell [21], where it was shown that the torus canard explosion occurs within the transition region between tonic spiking and bursting. Some basic aspects {{of the dynamics of}} torus canards were studied in [20] {{in the context of an}} elementary third order model, obtained by rotating a planar bistable system of van der Pol type and introducing symmetry-breaking terms. In this article, we extended this work and presented two primary results. First, we showed that torus canards are common among model neuronal systems of fast-slow type for which the fast systems have a saddle-node of periodic orbits (a.k.a. a fold of limit cycles) and the full systems have a torus bifurcation. The torus canard orbits spend long times near branches of attracting and repelling periodic orbits of the fast system in <b>alternation,</b> <b>switching</b> over from the former to the latter exactly near the saddle-node of periodic orbits. Moreover, these torus canards are the natural analog in one higher dimension of the by-now classical canards of limit cycle type, which spend long times near branches of attracting and repelling fixed points in alternation, as for example in the van der Pol and FitzHugh-Nagumo equations [28, 43]. It was shown here that the Hindmarsh-Rose (HR) system, the Morris-Lecar-Terman (MLT) model, and the Wilson-Cowan-Izhikevich (WCI) model all have the essential ingredients to possess torus canards, namely a saddle-node of periodic orbits in the fast system and a torus bifurcation in the full system. Also, we described in detail the families of torus canards that exist in these models, and identified the torus canard explosions.|$|R

40|$|Background: Visual {{perception}} is usually stable and accurate. However, {{when the two}} eyes are simultaneously presented with conflicting stimuli, perception falls into a sequence of spontaneous <b>alternations,</b> <b>switching</b> between one stimulus and the other every few seconds. Known as binocular rivalry, this visual illusion decouples subjective experience from physical stimulation and provides {{a unique opportunity to}} study the neural correlates of consciousness. The temporal properties of this alternating perception have been intensively investigated for decades, yet the relationship between two fundamental properties - the sequence of percepts and the duration of each percept - remains largely unexplored. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we examine the relationship between the percept sequence and the percept duration by quantifying their sensitivity to the strength imbalance between two monocular stimuli. We found that the percept sequence is far more susceptible to the stimulus imbalance than does the percept duration. The percept sequence always begins with the stronger stimulus, even when the stimulus imbalance is too weak to cause a significant bias in the percept duration. Therefore, introducing a small stimulus imbalance affects the percept sequence, whereas increasing the imbalance affects the percept duration, but not vice versa. To investigate why the percept sequence is so vulnerable to the stimulus imbalance, we further measured the interval between the stimulus onset and the first percept, during which subjects experienced the fusion of two monocular stimuli. We found that this interval is dramatically shortened with increased stimulus imbalance. Conclusions/Significance: Our study shows that in binocular rivalry, the strength imblanace between monocular stimuli has a much greater impact on the percept sequence than on the percept duration, and increasing this imbalance can accelerate the process responsible for the percept sequence...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the case of Kali'na, a minority Indigenous language of French Guiana, {{from the point of}} view of descriptive categories available in the literature (namely dominated language, minoritized language, endangered language). These terms are discussed, favouring more dynamic categories which focus on processes (minoritization/deminoritization). The article uses both micro- and macrosociolinguistic levels of analysis. At the macro level, indicators are proposed to gauge the minorization of Kali'na as it occurs on the scale of Guiana as a whole, by observing attitudes towards Kali'na language and culture, particularly as expressed in the media and in epilinguistic comments made by speakers. At the local level, we explore the effects of the recognition by the State of a Kali'na township and their influence on language minoritization in the village and more generally at the level of the linguistic community. We also attempt to determine to what extent, as far as interactions are concerned, <b>alternations</b> and code <b>switching</b> between Kali'na and French might constitute indicators of the process of minoritization or deminoritization or of language death currently underway...|$|R

40|$|This article {{describes}} {{the results of a}} follow-up sociolinguistic study to assess changes which have taken place in Strasbourg, France, since the early 1980 s, when the situation there was studied by the same author. The linguistic context and the results of the original study are described, as well as the implications and difficulties of such real-time studies. Although the latest large-scale statistical surveys are not directly comparable with the earlier ones, an accelerating shift away from the Alsatian dialect to the use of French is nonetheless evident. This results partly from diverse social changes affecting the city as opposed to the countryside. Alongside this, there is a snowball effect of trends which were already visible in the 1980 s, reflecting the loss of an elderly dialect-speaking generation who helped maintain Alsatian within the family. Rapid anonymous surveys carried out in town show the dialect to be used only in specific “pockets”. Some six hours of conversations involving code-switching were also compared with a similar corpus collected earlier, and revealed a decline in more complex grammatical forms of switching in favor of more single-word <b>switches.</b> <b>Alternation</b> was the dominant pattern although different proportions of switch-types occurred in different conversations. The functions of code-switching, e. g., for humor and solidarity, remained similar. The conclusion reiterates the difficulties but also the advantages of real-time sociolinguistic comparisons, as different socioeconomic and lifestyle factors interact with ongoing linguistic shift and change...|$|R
