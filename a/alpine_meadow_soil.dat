40|$|The {{principles}} of remotely estimating grassland cover density in an <b>alpine</b> <b>meadow</b> <b>soil</b> from space {{lie in the}} synchronous collection of in situ samples with the satellite pass and statistically linking these cover densities to their image properties according to their geographic coordinates. The principles and procedures for quantifying grassland cover density from satellite image data were presented with an example from Qinghai Lake, China demonstrating how quantification could be made more accurate through the integrated use of remote sensing and global positioning systems (GPS). An empirical model was applied to an entire satellite image to convert pixel values into ground cover density. Satellite data based on 68 field samples was used to produce a map of ten cover densities. After calibration a strong linear regression relationship (r(2) = 0. 745) between pixel values on the satellite image and in situ measured grassland cover density was established with an 89 % accuracy level. However, to minimize positional uncertainty of field samples, integrated use of hyperspatial satellite data and GPS could be utilized. This integration could reduce disparity in ground and space sampling intervals, and improve future quantification accuracy even more...|$|E

The addition of NH 4 NO 3 and NH 4 Cl increased the microbial respiration in C poor soil, but KNO 3 had no effect. The inorganic N forms had no effects on C rich soil, but decreased microbial respiration in C moderate soil. Soil microbial respiration levels across the different types were ordered as follows: C poor soil < C rich soil < C moderate soil, regardless of N addition. These results suggest that the effect of N on microbial respiration in <b>alpine</b> <b>meadow</b> <b>soils</b> is more dependent on the initial soil pH than on soil C availability...|$|R

Enzyme activities differed by meadow type, and in general were higher in the upper soil layers (0 – 10 and 10 – 20 [*]cm) than in the 20 – 40 [*]cm layer. Community differences in plant composition or functional group composition were reflected in plant biomass distribution. The identity of a species (or a functional group) was a greater determinant of ecosystem function than the number of plant species. A significant correlation was found between the coverage per functional group and the aboveground biomass of functional groups in four <b>alpine</b> <b>meadows.</b> <b>Soil</b> microbial biomass carbon (Cmic) and enzyme activity were each affected by both functional group biomass and CAB in the different meadow types. The negative correlation between diversity and CAB in the KTS may be influenced by a high soil nutrients input as a result of a higher litter input because of high aboveground biomass. Soil enzyme activities have been related to soil physio-chemical characters and plant primary production to change in vegetation.

There was high abundance of methanotrophs (1. 2 – 3. 4 × 108 pmoA gene copies per gram of dry weight soil) assessed by real-time PCR, and warming significantly increased the abundance regardless of grazing. A total of 64 methanotrophic operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were obtained from 1, 439 clone sequences, of these OTUs; 63 OTUs (98. 4 %) belonged to type I methanotrophs, and only one OTU was Methylocystis of type II methanotrophs. The methanotroph community composition and diversity were not apparently affected by the treatments. Warming and grazing significantly enhanced the potential CH 4 oxidation activity. There were significantly negative correlations between methanotrophic abundance and soil moisture and between methanotrophic abundance and NH 4 –N content.

A two-year field {{study was conducted to}} assess the effects of various forms of N (NH 4 + and N- 3 (-)) and associated N deposition rates (0, 10, 20 and 40 kg N ha(- 1) yr(- 1)) on <b>alpine</b> <b>meadow</b> <b>soil</b> CH 4 fluxes on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, China. Soil CH 4 fluxes, soil temperature, and soil moisture were monitored weekly using the static chamber technique and gas chromatography. Soil inorganic N pools, soil pH and aboveground biomass were measured monthly to examine the key controlling factors of soil CH 4 flux. Our results showed that N addition significantly promoted plant growth and changed soil water-filled pore space (WFPS), but did not alter soil inorganic N storages over the short term. Low rates of N addition significantly decreased the seasonal amount of CH 4 uptake by 8. 6 % compared with the control. Soil CH 4 fluxes were mainly determined by soil WFPS, followed by inorganic N availability. N addition increased the contribution of soil WFPS, pH and soil NO 3 - storage. The observed reduction in CH 4 uptake caused by N addition may be largely due to a decrease in physical diffusion, as the biochemical inhibition effects on methanotrophic bacteria are minor. These results suggest that soil inorganic N is a regulatory factor of soil CH 4 uptake, and its promotion or inhibition to soil CH 4 uptake depends on the N status in terrestrial ecosystems.

In addition, low temperature in alpine meadows {{might be one of}} the primary factors limiting soil organic matter decomposition and thus N mineralization. A laboratory incubation experiment was performed using an <b>alpine</b> <b>meadow</b> <b>soil</b> from the Tibetan Plateau. Two levels of NH 4 NO 3 (N) or glucose (C) were added, with a blank without addition of C or N as the control, before incubation at 5, 15, or 25 degrees C for 28 d. CO 2 efflux was measured during the 28 -d incubation, and the mineral N was measured {{at the beginning and end}} of the incubation, in order to test two hypotheses: 1) net N mineralization is negatively correlated with CO 2 efflux for the control and 2) the external labile N or C supply will shift the negative correlation to positive. The results showed a negative correlation between CO 2 efflux and net N immobilization in the control. External inorganic N supply did not change the negative correlation. The external labile C supply shifted the linear correlation from negative to positive under the low C addition level. However, under the high C level, no correlation was found. These suggested that the correlation of CO 2 efflux to net N mineralization strongly depend on soil labile C and C:N ratio regardless of temperatures.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the distribution profile, composition characteristics and sources of OCPs, soil samples collected from Wolong Natural Reserve (WNR) in spring and autumn in 2005 were analyzed using gas chromatography coupled with electron capture detector (GC-ECD). Results showed that all OCPs concentrations were in the range of 10 (- 2) ng/g- 10 (- 1) ng/g, representing the background level in those remote sites. Generally, their concentrations were slightly higher in spring than in autumn, which could be explained by OCPs: 1) may be released to soil from snow-melting water in spring; 2) partially evaporate into air from soil due to high temperature and intense radiation in summer and 3) can be relatively high degradation rate in summer. There were notable differences of OCPs seasonal variations between samples from <b>alpine</b> <b>meadow</b> and those from under-treeline.

Therefore, {{it is important}} to evaluate accurately the effects of applied N levels and forms on the amount and stability of soil organic carbon (SOC) in terrestrial ecosystems. In this study, a multi-form, small-input N addition experiment was conducted at the Haibei <b>Alpine</b> <b>Meadow</b> Ecosystem Research Station from 2007 to 2011. Three N fertilizers, NH 4 Cl, (NH 4) (2) SO 4 and KNO 3, were applied at four rates: 0, 10, 20 and 40 kg N ha(- 1) year(- 1). One hundred and eight soil samples were collected at 10 -cm intervals to a depth of 30 cm in 2011. Contents and delta C- 13 values of bulk SOC were measured, as well as three particle-size fractions: macroparticulate organic C (MacroPOC, > 250 mu m), microparticulate organic C (MicroPOC, 53 - 250 mu m) and mineral-associated organic C (MAOC, 250 mu m soil MacroPOC, and the C lost in the medium or large N treatments was from the > 53 mu m POC fraction. Five years of ammonium-N addition increased significantly the surface soil POC:MAOC ratio and increased the instability of soil organic matter (SOM).

The contents of SOC, WSOC, EOC, humic C fractions and aggregate-associated C, the proportions of macro-aggregates (2 - 0. 25) and micro-aggregates (0. 25 - 0. 053 mm), and the aggregate stability indices all increased in the order alpine desert < alpine steppe < <b>alpine</b> <b>meadow.</b> The alkyl C, O-alkyl C, and aliphatic C/aromatic C ratio of HA increased as alpine desert < <b>alpine</b> <b>meadow</b> < <b>alpine</b> steppe, and the trends were reverse for the aromatic C and HB/HI ratio.

Here we tested effects of litter species identity and diversity on carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) dynamics during litter decomposition in N-limited <b>alpine</b> <b>meadow</b> <b>soil</b> from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. We incubated litters of four meadow species, a sedge ("S", Kobresia humilis), a grass ("G", Elymus nutans), a herb ("H", Saussurea superba), and a legume ("L", Oxytropis falcata), in monoculture and in mixture with meadow soil. CO 2 release was measured 21 times during the incubation, and soil available N and microbial biomass C and N were measured before and after the experiment. The organic C decay rate did not differ much among soils amended with monocultures or mixtures of litter, except in the H, S, L, and S+H treatments, which had much higher decay rates. Potential decomposable C pools were lowest in the control, highest in the L treatment, and intermediate in the S treatment. Mineralized N was completely immobilized by soil microbes in all treatments except the control, S+L, and S+G+L treatments. Litter mixtures had both additive and non-additive effects on CO 2 -C emission (mainly antagonistic effects), net N mineralization (mainly synergistic), and microbial biomass C and N (both). Overall, these parameters were not significantly correlated with litter species richness. Similarly, microbial C or N was not significantly correlated with litter N content or C/N. However, cumulative CO 2 -C emission and net N mineralization were positively correlated with litter N content and negatively correlated with litter C/N. Litter N content and C/N rather than litter species richness drove the release of CO 2 -C and net available N in this ecosystem. The antagonistic effects of litter mixtures contributed to a modest release of CO 2 -C, but their synergistic effects enhanced net available N. We suggest that in alpine meadow communities, balancing species with high and low N contents will benefit soil carbon sequestration and plant competition for available N with soil microbes...|$|E

Here we quantified the regional SOC stock and its uncertainty using 298 soil profiles surveyed from 35 sites across the TRSR during 2006 – 2008.

Soil respiration, ER, GEP and AGB were significantly higher in slightly degraded (D 3 and D 6, group I) than in severely degraded land (D 1, D 2, D 4 and D 5, group II).

40|$|Ecosystems in alpine mountainous {{regions are}} {{vulnerable}} and easily disturbed by global environmental change. <b>Alpine</b> swamp <b>meadow,</b> a unique grassland {{type in the}} eastern Tibetan Plateau that provides important ecosystem services to the upstream and downstream regions of international rivers of Asia {{and other parts of}} the world, is undergoing severe degradation, which can dramatically alter soil hydraulic properties and water cycling processes. However, the effects of <b>alpine</b> swamp <b>meadow</b> degradation on <b>soil</b> hydraulic properties and the corresponding influencing mechanisms are still poorly understood. In this study, soil moisture content (SMC), field capacity (FC) and saturated hydraulic conductivity (K s) together with several basic soil properties under lightly degraded (LD), moderately degraded (MD) and severely degraded (SD) <b>alpine</b> swamp <b>meadow</b> were investigated; the variations in SMC, FC and K s with <b>alpine</b> swamp <b>meadow</b> degradation and their dominant influencing factors were analysed. The results showed that SMC and FC decreased consistently from LD to SD, while K s decreased from LD to MD and then increased from MD to SD, following the order of LD [*]>[*] SD [*]>[*] MD. Significant differences in soil hydraulic properties between degradation degrees were found in the upper soil layers (0 – 20  cm), indicating that the influences of degradation were most pronounced in the topsoils. FC was positively correlated with capillary porosity, water-stable aggregates, soil organic carbon, and silt and clay content; K s was positively correlated with non-capillary porosity (NCP). Relative to other soil properties, soil porosity is the dominant factor influencing FC and K s. Capillary porosity explained 91. 1  % of total variance in FC, and NCP explained 97. 3  % of total variance in K s. The combined effect of disappearing root activities and increasing sand content was responsible for the inconsistent patterns of NCP and K s. Our findings suggest that <b>alpine</b> swamp <b>meadow</b> degradation would inevitably lead to reduced water holding capacity and rainfall infiltration. This study provides a more comprehensive understanding of the soil hydrological effects of vegetation degradation. Further hydrological modelling studies in the Tibetan Plateau and similar regions are recommended to understand the effects of degraded <b>alpine</b> swamp <b>meadows</b> on <b>soil</b> hydraulic properties...|$|R

In {{order to}} {{investigate}} to quantify losses by Alpine vegetation in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, typical Swamp <b>meadow</b> and <b>Alpine</b> <b>meadow</b> were investigated {{in the growth}} period.

The experimental results indicate that: under different coverage of Swamp <b>meadow</b> and <b>Alpine</b> <b>meadow,</b> rainfall interception in the growing period (June-September) both show an increasing trend. And, both the maximum rainfall interception and maximum interception rate emerge in September under different vegetation cover of Swamp <b>meadow</b> and <b>Alpine</b> <b>meadow.</b> However, With vegetation degeneration, interception quantity and interception rate of Swamp <b>meadows</b> and <b>Alpine</b> <b>meadows</b> both show decreasd trends.

30|$|The {{degraded}} <b>alpine</b> <b>meadow</b> {{provides the}} plateau pika with a suitable habitat while the overabundant plateau pika population aggravates {{the degradation of}} the <b>alpine</b> <b>meadow</b> [2]. The long-term degradation of the <b>alpine</b> <b>meadow</b> will greatly reduce its ecological function, whereas the temporary reduction of plateau pika is helpless for {{the recovery of the}} degraded <b>alpine</b> <b>meadow.</b> Therefore, alternate methods like establishing artificial or semiartificial grassland are applied to manage the degraded <b>alpine</b> <b>meadow</b> [4]. After restoring the vegetation, the <b>alpine</b> <b>meadow</b> is no longer a suitable habitat for plateau pika, namely, the carrying capacity of plateau pika decreases. From the analysis in Sections 2 and 3, no matter whether there is control or not, the population size at the positive equilibrium reduces as long as the carrying capacity decreases. Therefore, restoring vegetation is the fundamental method to root out plateau pika.|$|R
40|$|In Colorado <b>alpine</b> dry <b>meadow</b> <b>soils,</b> {{microbial}} biomass {{has been}} observed to increase during fall and winter and to rapidly decline after snowmelt in the spring. It {{has been shown that}} these microbial population dynamics are linked to N availability to alpine plants, but the underlying mechanisms have not been explained. We hypothesized that: (1) freeze-thaw events in the spring cause reduction of the microbial biomass, (2) the winter microbial community is sensitive to prolonged temperatures above 08 C, and (3) the increase of biomass in fall and its decline in spring are due to changes in C availability. We performed laboratory experiments to test the eect of temperature regime on soil microbial biomass, respiration and C availability, and made seasonal measurements of C pools. Soil microbial biomass was unaected by freeze-thaw events in which realistic rates of freezing and thawing were used. Some significant eects were observed at faster freezing rates. Despite this tolerance to temperature fluctuations, the winter microbial community showed sensitivity to prolonged temperatures above 08 C. This eect may have been caused indirectly by an eect of temperature on substrate availability. Two week incubations at increased temperatures caused a reduction in the quantity of extractable organic C in the soil. The soil concentrations of cellulose and hot water-soluble organic C were the lowest in the summer and the highest in spring and autumn, mirroring previously measured patterns of microbial biomass. This suggests that C from litter inputs could be a strong control over microbial biomass. Respiration rates in soils collected before snowmelt were high at 08 C, and did not respond immediately to addition of glutamate...|$|R

The results indicated that zokor mounds significantly increased the dispersion area, number of individ-uals in each dispersion area, height and number of branches of flixweed tansymustard on the area disturbed by zokor mounds compared to those in undisturbed <b>alpine</b> <b>meadow.</b> These results suggest that ecosystem engineering by native species of rodent could promote the invasions of alien plant species in <b>alpine</b> <b>meadow</b> ecosystem, leading to higher abundances of invaders...|$|R

The energy flow through the population of rodents was estimated in this ecosystem. The <b>alpine</b> <b>meadows</b> ("polonina's") have an autonomous community of small rodents. The voles (Pitymys sub-terraneus and Microtus agrestis) are dominating, other meadow rodents (Sicista betulina, Apodemus agrarius, Arvicola terrestis) occur only sporadically while the forest rodents (Apodemus flavicollis, Clethrio-nomys glareolus) may occasionally feed in <b>alpine</b> <b>meadows.</b> The distri-bution of rodents in the <b>alpine</b> <b>meadows</b> is uneven; in the dwarf shrubs (scrub) they are four times as abundant as in the open meadows. The estimated mean rodent density on grass <b>alpine</b> <b>meadows</b> was 15 per hectare (13 P. subterraneus and 2 M. agrestis). The energy flow through these populations of P. subterraneus and M. agrestis amounts to 61, 012 Kcal/ha/year.

40|$|Biological soil crusts (BSCs) are the {{important}} components of <b>alpine</b> <b>meadow</b> ecosystems. The extent and morphology of BSCs vary greatly with <b>alpine</b> <b>meadow</b> retrogressive succession due to grazing pressure. There is significant interest in impacts of crust composition on plant seed germination, especially in (semi-) arid environments. However, {{little is known}} about the influences of BSCs, and their associations with <b>alpine</b> <b>meadow</b> succession, on germination of typical <b>alpine</b> <b>meadow</b> vascular plant species. In a full factorial common-garden experiment, we studied effects of: (1) crust type, (2) seed position, and (3) surface texture on seed germination. We chose three typical <b>alpine</b> <b>meadow</b> plant species (i. e. Poa pratensis, Tibetia himalaica and Potentillen nivea), which belonged to different functional groups (graminoids, legumes, and forbs) and play important roles in all <b>alpine</b> <b>meadow</b> succession stages. Crust type and seed position influenced seed germination, and the inhibitory effects of BSCs depended on the crust type and seed species tested. The major factors influencing seed germination were BSC type, seed position, soil texture, and the interactions between BSC type and seed position; species and seed position; species and surface texture; and species, crust type, and surface texture. Cyanobacteria crust significantly inhibited germination of all seeds. Seed position also had a significant effect on seed germination (p < 0. 001). Fewer seedlings germinated on the surface than below the surface, this was especially true for P. nivea. seeds within cyanobacteria and lichen crusts. Only germination rates of T. himalaica on the soil surface were significantly correlated with plant occurrence frequency within the <b>alpine</b> <b>meadow</b> community. The poor correlation for the other two species is possibly that they are perennials. Our results clearly demonstrated that BSCs can be biological filters during seed germination, depending on the BSC succession stage. Through their influences on seed germination, BSCs can strongly influence community assemblages throughout <b>alpine</b> <b>meadow</b> retrogressive succession...|$|R
