40|$|Background: Myeloperoxidase (MPO) <b>anti-neutrophil</b> <b>cytoplasm</b> <b>autoantibody</b> (ANCA) -associated {{vasculitis}} commonly causes life-threatening pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage or fibrosis. Only {{a limited}} number of candidate gene variants have been explored, but hitherto, are not widely confirmed. In the present study, we investigated the importance of energy homeostasis associated gene (Enho) mutations and adropin deficiency in the development of MPO-ANCA associated lung injury. Methods: We analyzed the peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 152 unrelated patients and 220 population-matched healthy individuals for genetic variations in Enho. Functional studies with adropin knockout (AdrKO) on C 57 BL/ 6 J mice were also performed. Findings: Sequencing revealed six patients with p. Ser 43 Thr and that five patients shared Cys 56 Trp amino acid substitution in Enho. Serum concentration of adropin was significantly lower in patients than that of the healthy subjects (P <  0. 0001), especially those with Enho mutations. In vivo, homo- and heterozygous carriers of the null adropin allele exhibited MPO-ANCA associated pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage as compared to wild-type mice. AdrKO mice exhibit reduced eNOS (Ser 1177) and Akt 1 (Ser 473) phosphorylation and loss of Treg cells. Interpretation: Our findings indicate that the presence of Enho mutations or adropin-deficiency is a probable molecular basis for the initial events triggered in MPO-ANCA associated lung injury...|$|E

We studied whether urinary and plasma levels of MMP- 2, - 9, and TIMP- 1 reflect renal {{expression of}} these proteins and renal disease-activity in AAV. Urine and plasma samples {{of patients with}} AAV who underwent a renal biopsy were collected (n = 32). Urinary activity of MMP- 2 and - 9 was measured by activity assays. Urinary and plasma levels of MMP- 2, MMP- 9, and TIMP- 1 proteins were measured by ELISA. Healthy controls provided plasma and urine for comparison (n = 31). In patients, the relationship of urinary and plasma levels with renal expression of MMP- 2 and MMP- 9 and clinical and histological disease activity was studied. Renal MMP expression was compared between patients and controls (n = 8). Urinary MMP- 2 and MMP- 9 activity and urinary and plasma TIMP- 1 levels were significantly higher in patients than in controls. In glomeruli of patients, both MMP- 2 and MMP- 9 expression reflected active glomerular inflammation. Urinary activity of MMP- 2 and MMP- 9 did not correlate with renal MMP expression or plasma levels. Urinary MMP activity correlated negatively with glomerular inflammation, but positively with fibrous crescents. Urinary MMP- 2 and TIMP- 1 levels showed a positive correlation with tubulointerstitial damage and a negative correlation with creatinine clearance. Urinary MMP- 2, MMP- 9, and TIMP- 1 are elevated in AAV but do not reflect renal MMP expression and glomerular inflammation. However, urinary MMP- 2 activity and TIMP- 1 levels reflect tubulointerstitial damage and correlate negatively with creatinine clearance at biopsy.

40|$|Human <b>anti-neutrophil</b> <b>cytoplasm</b> <b>autoantibodies</b> to proteinase 3 (PR 3 -ANCA) bind to neutrophils. Background. Recently, the in vivo {{pathogenic}} role of <b>anti-neutrophil</b> <b>cytoplasm</b> <b>autoantibodies</b> (ANCA) in ANCA-associated vasculitis {{has been}} challenged by Abdel-Salam et al. In their report, they observed that ANCA directed against proteinase 3 (PR 3) cannot bind to their target autoantigen PR 3 on circulating neutrophils (PMN). Here we present evidence that human PR 3 -ANCA do specifically bind to PMN that express PR 3 on their membrane. Methods. PMN were isolated from donors showing bimodal membrane PR 3 expression on their PMN (N= 3). TNF alpha-primed PMN or PMA-stimulated PMN were incubated with serum or plasma from PR 3 -ANCA-positive patients with Wegener's granulomatosis (WG) (N= 8) or healthy controls (N= 8). Binding of IgG in serum or plasma samples to PMN was assessed by indirect immunofluorescence. Results. Binding of IgG in undiluted plasma or serum from PR 3 -ANCA-positive WG-patients to PMN was significantly increased compared to plasma or serum from healthy controls. Dilution of plasma and serum showed concentration-dependent binding of IgG. Double staining for PR 3 and IgG demonstrated that IgG in plasma or serum from PR 3 -ANCA-positive patients only bound to those PMN that expressed PR 3, and not to PMN that lacked PR 3 expression on their membrane. Conclusion. PR 3 -ANCA in undiluted serum or plasma from PR 3 -ANCA-positive WG patients bind to TNF alpha- primed and PMA-stimulated PMN that express PR 3 on their membrane. Therefore, the hypothesis that PR 3 -ANCA can bind and activate primed PMN {{is still the most}} attractive explanation for the contribution of PR 3 -ANCA to the pathogenesis of Wegener's granulomatosis...|$|R
40|$|In humans, {{circulating}} <b>anti-neutrophil</b> <b>cytoplasm</b> <b>autoantibodies</b> (ANCAs) with specificity for myeloperoxidase (MPO) {{are strongly}} associated {{with the development of}} pauci-immune necrotizing and crescentic glomerulonephritis (NCGN). In mice, we have demonstrated that intravenous injection of mouse antibodies specific for mouse MPO induces NCGN that closely mimics the human disease. We now report that the development of NCGN in this experimental model is accompanied by glomerular accumulation of neutrophils and macrophages. Neutrophil infiltration was most conspicuous at sites of glomerular necrosis and crescent formation, with macrophages also most numerous in crescents. Lymphocytes, however, were sparse in acute lesions. Importantly, mice that were depleted of circulating neutrophils with NIMP-R 14 rat monoclonal antibodies were completely protected from anti-MPO IgG-induced NCGN. These findings provide direct evidence that neutrophils {{play a major role in}} the pathogenesis of anti-MPO-induced NCGN in this animal model and implicate neutrophils in the induction of human ANCA disease. This raises the possibility that therapeutic strategies to reduce circulating neutrophils could be beneficial to patients with ANCA-induced NCGN...|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} of circulating autoantibodies with the endothelium {{may be an}} important mechanism in the pathogenesis of systemic vasculitis. In a prospective study, we looked for circulating antiendothelial cell <b>autoantibodies</b> (AECA) and <b>anti-neutrophil</b> <b>cytoplasm</b> <b>autoantibodies</b> (ANCA) in 80 patients with suspected systemic vasculitis. AECA were measured using an isotype-specific cellular ELISA incorporating human umbilical vein endothelial cells. ANCA activity was determined by indirect immunofluorescence and radioimmunoassay. Sequential studies were performed on sera from four cases with dual positivity, where autoantibody binding was compared with von Willebrand factor (vWF) concentration and disease activity. IgG AECA were significantly higher in the 27 ANCA-positive sera as compared with normal controls (P = 0. 027) with IgG (P = 0. 009) and IgA (P = 0. 046) AECA isotypes correlating with ANCA positivity; in contrast, no differences were found between AECA levels in the ANCA-negative sera and the normal controls. Cross-inhibition studies pointed to the co-existence of two autoantibody populations. An association between autoantibody binding, disease activity and vWF concentration was found for both ANCA and AECA. Some patients with systemic vasculitis have detectable AECA that recognize different epitopes to ANCA and like ANCA, their titre correlates with disease activity and thus they may have a pathogenetic role in these conditions...|$|R
40|$|Renal {{histology}} in ANCA-associated vasculitis: Differences between {{diagnostic and}} serologic subgroups. BackgroundDifferences in renal histopathology between microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) and Wegener's granulomatosis (WG), and between <b>anti-neutrophil</b> <b>cytoplasm</b> <b>autoantibody</b> (ANCA) test results {{in patients with}} ANCA-associated vasculitis may {{provide insight into the}} differences in pathogenesis and raise the opportunity of classifying the vasculitides more accurately. The possible differences in histopathology are investigated in this study. MethodsWe report an analysis of 173 patients with renal disease in microscopic polyangiitis or Wegener's granulomatosis. A total of 173 renal biopsies, performed at diagnosis, were scored by two observers separately, using a previously standardized protocol. Consensus on each biopsy was achieved during a central review. ResultsNormal glomeruli were more common in WG than in MPA (P < 0. 001). Glomerulosclerosis was more prominent in MPA than in WG (P = 0. 003). Interstitial fibrosis (P < 0. 001), tubular atrophy (P < 0. 001), and tubular casts (P = 0. 005) were more frequently present and more severe in MPA than in WG. Presence of glomerulosclerosis was more extensive in patients with myeloperoxidase (MPO) -ANCA than with proteinase 3 (PR 3) -ANCA (P = 0. 022). Interstitial fibrosis (P = 0. 008), tubular necrosis (P = 0. 030), tubular atrophy (P = 0. 013), and intra-epithelial infiltrates (P = 0. 006) were more frequently present and more severe in MPO-ANCA than in PR 3 -ANCA. ConclusionsGlomerulonephritis in relation to MPA has more characteristics of chronic injury at the time of presentation than glomerulonephritis in relation to WG. This difference may be due to a delayed establishment of diagnosis in patients with MPA compared to patients with WG. Both active and chronic lesions are more abundantly present in MPO-ANCA–positive patients than in patients with PR 3 -ANCA–positivity, which suggests that the pathogenesis of renal disease in these ANCA subsets could be different. Our results also suggest that ANCA test results may be useful in classifying ANCA-associated vasculitides...|$|E
40|$|Autoantibodies to {{neutrophil}} cytoplasmic antigens {{are found}} in patients with small or medium-size vessel systemic vasculitis such as Wegener's granulomatosis and microscopic polyarteritis. We studied the specificity of <b>anti-neutrophil</b> <b>cytoplasm</b> <b>autoantibodies</b> (ANCA) by examining the binding of sera from patients with different forms of systemic vasculitis, to neutrophil extract size-fractionated by gel filtration for high performance liquid chromatography. Sequential fractions were collected for solid-phase radioimmunoassay. Patients with Wegener's granulomatosis showed two peaks of activity over fractions of 12 and 2 kD. Patients with microscopic polyarteritis had two different peaks of activity over fractions of 100 and 25 kD. Patients with Takayasu's arteritis and dermal lymphocytic vasculitis were studied as controls (all were ANCA negative by indirect immunofluorescence studies and solid-phase radioimmunoassay). However, the patient with lymphocytic vasculitis showed a distinct peak of activity over 22 kD and patients with Takayasu's arteritis had a single peak of activity over 200 kD. These results suggest the binding pattern of sera to fractionated neutrophil extract could be useful in differentiating between different diseases within the spectrum of systemic vasculitis. Cryptic antigen recognition in certain vasculitides may only be revealed by this procedure. We conclude that the association of ANCA and systemic vasculitis may {{not be limited to}} diseases of small or medium-size vessels, but could also include large vessel disease such as Takayasu's arteritis...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>anti-{{neutrophil}}</b> <b>cytoplasm</b> <b>autoantibodies</b> (ANCA) on neutrophil activation was studied by pre-incubating neutrophils with IgG and F(ab') 2 prepared from ANCA patients with Wegener's granulomatosis or microscopic polyarteritis. We measured {{the generation of}} inositol triphosphate (IP 3) (a product of hydrolysis of membrane phospholipid which acts as a second intracellular messenger), and the translocation of protein kinase C (PKC) upon stimulation by a chemotactic peptide, fMet-Leu-Phe (fMLP). ANCA+ F(ab') 2 did not induce {{a significant increase in}} IP 3 generation. Nonetheless, ANCA+ F(ab') 2 and ANCA+ IgG pretreatment of human neutrophils reduced the production of inositol phosphates upon subsequent fMLP stimulation compared with experiments performed when cells were pretreated with F(ab') 2 and IgG prepared from ANCA- healthy subjects. A significantly reduced generation of IP 3 and inositol biphosphate (IP 2) was observed. ANCA+ F(ab') 2 pretreatment of neutrophils inhibited fMLP-stimulated IP 3 generation in a dose-dependent manner. The membrane-bound PKC activity upon stimulation by FMLP and PMA was reduced in neutrophils pretreated with ANCA+ F(ab') 2 and IgG. These results indicate that ANCA affect in vitro signal transduction (IP 3 generation, and translocation of PKC) in human neutrophils. Apparently, further activation of signal transduction by chemotactic peptide is significantly blunted in cells pre-incubated with ANCA+ F(ab') 2 but not with F(ab') 2 from healthy controls...|$|R
40|$|Necrotizing leucocytoclastic vasclitis in the histopathological {{hallmark}} of the small vessel systemic vasculitides (SV), a group of human diseases commonly associated with <b>anti-neutrophil</b> <b>cytoplasm</b> <b>autoantibodies</b> (ANCA). Necrotizing vasculitis is seen {{in a number of}} experimental systems, but none of these provide an ideal animal model for human SV. Vasculitis occurs in serum sickness reactions; in murine models of systemic lupus erythematosus; in association with infection, particularly chronic viral infections; and after treatment with certain drugs or inflammatory mediators. 'Spontaneous' vasculitis has been reported in specific mouse strains, especially with ageing, and in some larger species. The size of vessel involved and the type of inflammatory cells predominating are variable in these experimental situations, and none of these models feature antibodies analogous to ANCA. We have recently reported that Brown Norway rats treated with mercuric chloride (HgCl 2) develop necrotizing leucocytoclastic vasculitis, especially in the gut, and also develop antibodies to myeloperoxidase (MPO) which recognize smilar determinants on MPO to those bound by a subset of ANCA. Transfer of serum from HgCl 2 -treated rats to naive animals does not induce tissue injury. Preliminary experiments using pooled immunoglobulin or an anti-CD 4 monoclonal antibody did not show useful therapeutic benefit from these treatments. HgCl 2 -induced vasculitis has weaknesses as an animal model of human SV, but is the only experimental model in which anti-MPO autoantibodies have so far been demonstrated, and therefore may be of particular relevance to ANCA-associated SV. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|<b>Anti-neutrophil</b> <b>cytoplasm</b> <b>autoantibodies</b> (ANCA) {{directed}} against proteinase 3 (PR 3) are highly sensitive and specific markers for Wegener's granulomatosis (WG). Consequently, antigen-specific assays for detection of PR 3 -ANCA are helpful for {{the diagnosis and}} follow-up of patients with WG. Purification of PR 3 is laborious and requires large amounts of granulocytes. Therefore, several {{attempts have been made}} to produce recombinant PR 3 that is recognized by PR 3 -ANCA. The purpose of this stud, was to compare the recognition of different recombinant forms of PR 3 (rPR 3) by anti-PR 3 antibodies. Recombinant PR 3 produced in E. coli (rcPR 3), P. pastoris (rpPR 3), insect cells using the baculovirus system (rbPR 3), the human mast cell line, HMC- 1 (HMC- 1 /PR 3 -S 176 A), or the human epithelial cell lint, 293 (Delta -rPR 3 -S 176 A) as well as purified neutrophil PR 3 (nPR 3) were used. Recognition of these rPR 3 s by anti-PR 3 antibodies was determined by direct and capture ELISA with 19 PR 3 -ANCA sera, 13 anti-PR 3 mAbs and a rabbit serum raised against human PR 3. In the capture ELISA rabbit anti-PR 3 strongly bound nPR 3 and all rPR 3 products. By capture ELISA rcPR 3 and rpPR 3 were recognized by 11 (57 %) and 13 (68 %) of the 19 PR 3 -ANCA sera, respectively, whereas rbPR 3, HMC- 1 /PR 3 -S 176 A, Delta -rPR 3 -S 176 A and nPR 3 were recognized by all PR 3 -ANCA sera. By direct ELISA rabbit anti-PR 3 strongly bound nPR 3 and all tested rPR 3 products. Using the direct ELISA none of the PR 3 -ANCA sera recognized rcPR 3, whereas rpPR 3 and rbPR 3 were recognized hv two (11 %) and 17 (89 %) of the 19 PR 3 -ANCA sera, respectively. All 13 anti-PR 3 mAbs recognized nPR 3 in the direct as well as in the capture ELISA. The rcPR 3 was recognized by two mAbs in the capture ELISA but by none of the mAbs in the direct ELISA. The rpPR 3 was recognized by seven mAbs in the capture ELISA and only by two mAbs in the direct ELISA. All but one of the anti-PR 3 mAbs recognized rbPR 3, whereas HMC- 1 /PR 3 -S 176 A and Delta -rPR 3 -S 176 A were recognized by all anti-PR 3 mAbs. In conclusion, rPR 3 expressed in insect cells, HMC- 1 and 293 cells is recognized by anti-PR 3 antibodies, whereas conformational epitopes recognized by anti-PR 3 mAbs and PR 3 -ANCA are not well preserved on rPR 3 expressed in E. coli or P. pastoris.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Mercuric {{chloride}} (HgCl 2) induces an autoimmune syndrome in Brown Norway (BN) rats {{characterized by}} the presence of a number of autoantibodies, including antibodies to glomerular basement membrane. Tissue injury has previously been reported to be rare in this model, but in the accompanying paper we describe changes in a number of organs including a necrotizing leucocytoclastic vasculitis in the gut. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is one of the target antigens for <b>anti-neutrophil</b> <b>cytoplasm</b> antibodies, that are present in the majority of patients with the human autoimmune disease systemic vasculitis and have been implicated in pathogenesis. There is at present, no animal model for <b>anti-neutrophil</b> <b>cytoplasm</b> antibody positive systemic vasculitis. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Ten BN rats were given five injections of HgCl 2, each of 1 mg/kg, over 10 days. Sequential serum samples were tested for autoantibodies to MPO using solid phase assays, indirect immunofluorescence on normal rat neutrophils, and Western blot analysis. The specificity of these antibodies in the solid phase assay was confirmed by inhibition studies with purified antigen, and by testing binding to uncoated plates. Sera from control animals treated with saline were also tested. RESULTS: BN rats given HgCl 2 developed antibodies to MPO, which in Western blots bound to similar determinants to those bound by human anti-MPO antibodies. The anti-MPO antibodies resolved spontaneously, with a time course {{similar to that of the}} anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies, but there was no correlation between the two antibody responses in individual animals. There was no anti-MPO activity in sera taken before HgCl 2 was given, nor in sera from saline-treated controls. CONCLUSIONS: BN rats treated with HgCl 2 develop anti-MPO antibodies. Together with the description in the accompanying paper of necrotizing vasculitis in these animals, these observations suggest that HgCl 2 -induced autoimmunity in the BN rat may provide a useful model of <b>anti-neutrophil</b> <b>cytoplasm</b> antibody positive systemic vasculitis. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

The expression of recombinant MPO in Chinese hamster ovary cells has produced a source of pure protein, suitable for molecular studies. We have shown that this protein is an antigen recognized by 95 % of anti-MPO antibodies from patients with systemic vasculitis. This recombinant molecule will be of use in providing an additional specific solid-phase assay for these antibodies and further forms of this protein which mirror the antigenicity of native MPO more exactly may replace chemically purified antigen. It will also be of great value in studies examining the epitopes recognized by anti-MPO antibodies and in studies of immunoregulation and T cell activation...|$|R
40|$|Nephritis is {{the most}} {{frequent}} severe manifestation of <b>anti-neutrophil</b> <b>cytoplasm</b> antibody associated (ANCA) systemic vasculitis (AASV) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and carries substantial morbidity. Although immunosuppressive medications and glucocorticoids are effective at inducing remission, patients still suffer from high relapse rates and experience significant treatment-related toxicity. Rituximab (RTX), a chimeric antibody directed against CD 20, found on B lymphocytes, shows potential {{as a treatment for}} both AASV and SLE. Although direct comparisons with standard therapies are currently unavailable, patients in several studies of refractory and relapsing disease have achieved a remission despite the failure of standard therapies. These reports are supported by several lines of experimental evidence that underlie the rationale for using targeted B-cell therapies and have improved our understanding of the pathogenesis of these complex diseases. Future randomized control trials and long-term follow-up studies are required to confirm the role of RTX and other B-cell targeting therapies in AASV and SLE...|$|R
40|$|In the {{pathogenesis}} of <b>anti-neutrophil</b> <b>cytoplasm</b> antibodies (ANCA) -associated vasculitis, T cell contribution is indicated by T cell-dependent ANCA production combined {{with the presence of}} T cells in inflammatory infiltrates. However, the exact pathogenic role of T cells in ANCA-associated vasculitis remains to be determined. The Th 1 /Th 2 concept is useful for understanding T cell involvement in pathological processes. This review focuses on T cells and particularly the Th 1 /Th 2 paradigm in ANCA-associated vasculitis. Most research has been done in Wegener's granulomatosis, where a shift in T cell response, from a Th 1 pattern in localized disease towards a Th 0 /Th 2 pattern in generalized disease, appears to occur. Although less thoroughly studied, data in Churg-Strauss syndrome and microscopic polyangiitis indicate that these diseases are predominantly associated with Th 2 patterns. Further studies elucidating {{the true nature of the}} polarization towards Th 1 or Th 2 in ANCA-associated vasculitis are clearly needed. Copyright (C) 2003 S. Karger AG, Basel...|$|R
40|$|Granulomatosis with polyangiitis, {{formerly}} known as Wegener's granulomatosis or disease, is a systemic, necrotizing small-vessel vasculitis, belonging {{to the group of}} <b>anti-neutrophil</b> <b>cytoplasm</b> antibody vasculitis. The therapeutic strategy includes, in most cases, corticosteroids associated, at least in severe forms of the disease, with immunosuppressive agents: cyclophosphamide and rituximab to induce remission, methotrexate, azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil to prevent relapses. Intravenous immunoglobulins represent an alternative adjuvant therapy. We described 5 cases of patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis treated with monthly high-dose intravenous immunoglobulins (500. mg/kg/daily for 3 consecutive days for 9. months). No patients experienced adverse reactions, and 4 patients (80 %) achieved a complete remission after 9 courses of this therapy, which was maintained also 3. months later, although we are unable to determine whether improvement in outcomes was {{a direct result of the}} IVIG. We also discussed the beneficial effects of intravenous immunoglobulins in patients suffering from granulomatosis with polyangiitis, reporting the previously published data...|$|R
40|$|The {{systemic}} vasculitides are {{an uncommon}} group of autoimmune diseases capable of causing multi organ failure and death. Current immunosuppressive strategies have substantially improved the outcome, but {{the natural history}} of treated disease is unstable, typically characterised by frequent relapses, drug toxicity and an increasing burden of damage. Early diagnosis, accurate staging and regular evaluation of disease status are important in the management of the vasculitides. Clinical evaluation tools have been developed and provide a comprehensive assessment of patients. Serological markers, especially <b>anti-neutrophil</b> <b>cytoplasm</b> antibody (ANCA), pathology and imaging investigations are a useful addition, but are more valuable in diagnosis rather than monitoring of disease activity. Advances in magnetic resonance imaging in large vessel vasculitis have improved our ability to characterise disease and may lead to earlier diagnosis and better control in future. Development of new biomarkers is required in vasculitis, and this is likely to advance our understanding as well as the management of these complex conditions...|$|R
40|$|Recently, autoantibodies {{directed}} against a cytoplasmic antigen of human neutrophil granulocytes (<b>anti-neutrophil</b> <b>cytoplasm</b> antibodies [ACPA; {{also known as}} ANCA]) have been described to be closely associated with Wegener's granulomatosis, a granulomatous disorder associated with systemic necrotizing vasculitis (1 - 3). Furthermore, ACPA serum concentration appears to be correlated with disease activity (1, 4 - 7). Together with the known involvement of granulocytes in granuloma formation, a hallmark of Wegener's granulomatosis, this correlation supports the hypothesis that ACPA play a pathogenetic role (8). Therefore, identification of the target antigen of ACPA is of crucial importance for further investigations into the pathogenesis of this disease. Here we report that ACPA are {{directed against}} an elastinolytic neutral serine proteinase, which is most probably identical with the recently described proteinase 3 (9 - 11), the third neutral serine proteinase ofhuman neutrophils. Materials and Methods Purification of the Target Antigen ofACPA. The target antigen of ACPA was released from human neutrophils during degranulation induced by PMA (12) and was further purified b...|$|R
40|$|A 13 -year old boy is {{described}} with painful joints, papular skinlaesions, malaise and haematuria. Impaired renal function and hypertension were found. In the past he frequently suffered of otitis media. Biopsies of kidney and skin lesions showed a vasculitis, furthermore the C-ANCA-titer (<b>anti-neutrophil</b> <b>cytoplasm</b> antibodies) was strongly elevated which justified the diagnosis Wegener's granulomatosis (WG). This disease is seldom seen in childhood. It is a necrotizing vasculitis with granulomas of mostly the respiratory tract and kidneys. Autoantibodies directed against intracellular antigens of neutrophils were first associated with vasculitis in 1982. Since 1988 two ANCA-subtypes have been recognized: C-ANCA and P-ANCA. The C-ANCA {{appear to be}} highly specific for diagnosis and follow-up of WG, and to differentiate of other forms of vasculitis (with P-ANCA). If children present with frequent and serious upper respiratory tract infections, with suspicion of a systemic disease {{it is important to}} perform the ANCA-test to differentiate between WG and other forms of vasculitis. The patient was treated with prednisone and cyclophosphamide, after which the symptoms and the ANCA-titer decrease...|$|R
40|$|Fifty two serum {{samples from}} {{patients}} with Crohn's disease, 24 from patients with ulcerative colitis, and 12 from patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis were analysed {{for the presence}} of <b>anti-neutrophil</b> <b>cytoplasm</b> antibodies (ANCA) of IgG and IgA class by means of enzyme linked immunosorbent assays using lactoferrin, myeloperoxidase, and antigen extracted from azurophil granules, 'alpha antigen' (that is, an antigen preparation containing proteinase 3) as substrates. A high frequency of positive tests for IgG anti-lactoferrin antibodies was found in sera from patients with ulcerative colitis (50 %) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (50 %). In Crohn's disease only 4 of 52 (8 %) sera had anti-lactoferrin antibodies [...] in all four instances the sera belonged to patients with disease involving the colon. All patients with sclerosing cholangitis and positive tests for anti-lactoferrin had ulcerative colitis. Low levels of IgG antibodies against myeloperoxidase or alpha antigen were also found occasionally in sera from patients with ulcerative colitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis. IgA antibodies directed against lactoferrin and alpha antigen (but not myeloperoxidase) were seen in all three conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} vasculitis-associated <b>anti-neutrophil</b> <b>cytoplasm</b> {{antibodies}} (ANCA) to activate neutrophils and mediate release of radiolabel from 111 Indium-labeled cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) was determined {{as a measure}} of the potential cytotoxicity of ANCA-activated neutrophils against vascular endothelium. Priming of neutrophils with low doses of phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate (PMA) (1 ng/ml) and ionomycin (0. 1 mumol/ 1) was required, together with pretreatment of endothelial cells with BCNU (1, 3 -bis-[2 -chloroethyl]- 1 -nitrosourea; 0. 26 mmol/l). Under these conditions and using a 4 -hour serum-free assay system, mouse monoclonal antibodies (MAb) to the target autoantigens proteinase- 3 (Pr- 3) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) mediated enhanced release of 111 Indium from HUVEC compared with control MAb. Human IgG Fab 2 C-ANCA (recognizing Pr- 3) and P-ANCA (recognizing MPO) did likewise. Preactivation of HUVEC with TNF (50 U/ml, 4 hr) enhanced the release of 111 Indium from HUVEC generated by neutrophils activated with anti-Pr- 3 and anti-MPO MAb. These data support the suggestion that activation of neutrophils by ANCA within the vascular lumen may contribute to endothelial cell injury...|$|R
