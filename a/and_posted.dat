Plasma samples were analyzed using spectrophotometer methods, plasma concentration of these enzymes showed increased in chronic renal failure pre <b>and</b> <b>post</b> dialysis. The mean values of lactate dehydrogenase pre dialysis is 259 IU/L, post dialysis is 276 IU/L, the mean of creatine kinase pre dialysis is 252 IU/L, <b>and</b> <b>post</b> dialysis is 241 IU/L but the mean of amylase pre <b>and</b> <b>post</b> dialysis is the same 144 IU/L.

40|$|Aim: To {{study the}} effect of {{integrated}} yoga on pain, morning stiffness and anxiety in osteoarthritis of knees. Materials and Methods: Two hundred and fifty participants with OA knees (35 - 80 years) {{were randomly assigned to}} yoga or control group. Both groups had transcutaneous electrical stimulation and ultrasound treatment followed by intervention (40 min) for two weeks with follow up for three months. The integrated yoga consisted of yogic loosening and strengthening practices, asanas, relaxation, pranayama and meditation. The control group had physiotherapy exercises. Assessments were done on 15 th (<b>post</b> 1) <b>and</b> 90 th day (post 2). Results: Resting pain (numerical rating scale) reduced better (P< 0. 001, Mann-Whitney U test) in yoga group (post 1 = 33. 6 % <b>and</b> <b>post</b> 2 = 71. 8 %) than control group (post 1 = 13. 4 % <b>and</b> <b>post</b> 2 = 37. 5 %). Morning stiffness decreased more (P< 0. 001) in yoga (post 1 = 68. 6 % <b>and</b> <b>post</b> 2 = 98. 1 %) than control group (post 1 = 38. 6 % <b>and</b> <b>post</b> 2 = 71. 6 %). State anxiety (STAI- 1) reduced (P< 0. 001) by 35. 5 % (<b>post</b> 1) <b>and</b> 58. 4 % (post 2) in the yoga group and 15. 6 % (<b>post</b> 1) <b>and</b> 38. 8 % (post 2) in the control group; trait anxiety (STAI 2) reduced (P< 0. 001) better (post 1 = 34. 6 % <b>and</b> <b>post</b> 2 = 57. 10 %) in yoga than control group (post 1 = 14. 12 % <b>and</b> <b>post</b> 2 = 34. 73 %). Systolic blood pressure reduced (P< 0. 001) better in yoga group (post 1 =− 7. 93 % <b>and</b> <b>post</b> 2 =− 15. 7 %) than the control group (post 1 =− 1. 8 % <b>and</b> <b>post</b> 2 =− 3. 8 %). Diastolic blood pressure reduced (P< 0. 001) better in yoga group (post 1 =− 7. 6 % <b>and</b> <b>post</b> 2 =− 16. 4 %) than the control group (post 1 =− 2. 1 % <b>and</b> <b>post</b> 2 =− 5. 0 %).
