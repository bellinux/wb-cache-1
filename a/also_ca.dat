An amazing season with 30 national championships helped CA retain its crown as the top program in the world. They take their overall title count to 116 - despite going to fewer national competitions than the year before. They set several marks for excellence this year. The Jags won their 6th NCA National Championship in a row - the first cheerleading program in history to reach that mark. The Panthers won the NCA Grand Championship with a 9.77, giving CA the coveted Grand Champion trophy. (CA has won each year of the award's ftheir year history.)

40|$|AbstractThe {{effects of}} quinine and tetraethylammonium (TEA) on single-channel K+ {{currents}} recorded from excised membrane patches of the insulin-secreting cell line RINm 5 F were investigated. When 100 μM quinine {{was applied to}} the external membrane surface K+ current flow through inward rectifier channels was abolished, while a separate voltage-activated high-conductance K+ channel was not significantly affected. On the other hand, 2 mM TEA abolished current flow through voltage-activated high-conductance K+ channels without influencing the inward rectifier K+ channel. Quinine is therefore not a specific inhibitor of Ca 2 +-activated K+ channels, but instead a good blocker of the Ca 2 +-independent K+ inward rectifier channel whereas TEA specifically inhibits the high-conductance voltage-activated K+ channel which is <b>also</b> <b>Ca</b> 2 +-activated...|$|E

40|$|We have {{discovered}} an efficient algorithm for matching and unification in associativecommutative (AC) and associative-commutative-idempotent (ACI) equational theories. In most cases of AC unification {{and in all}} cases of ACI unification our method obviates the need for solving diophantine equations, and thus avoids one of the bottlenecks of other associative-commutative unification techniques. The algorithm efficiently utilizes powerful constraints to eliminate much of the search involved in generating valid substitutions. Moreover, {{it is able to}} generate solutions lazily, enabling its use in an SLD-resolution-based environment like Prolog. We have found the method to run much faster and use less space than other associative-commutative unification procedures on many commonly encountered AC problems. 1 Introduction A number of computer science applications, including term rewriting, automatic theorem proving, software verification, and database retrieval require AC unification (<b>also</b> <b>ca</b> [...] ...|$|E

In the first step, a cation-exchange membrane, Nafion (R) 117, modified by electrodeposition of polyethylenimine (PEI) was used to separate successfully Cr(III) from NaCl solutions. In the second step, conventional electrodialysis with Nafion (R) 117, Nafion (R) 324 or CMX membranes permits to increase the concentration of Cr(III) in the solutions produced in the separation stage...|$|E

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of drying leaf samples using microwave oven on the foliar concentrations of macronutrients of brachiaria grass, cane sugar and guava. For this, a study was carried out in a 3 x 2 factorial arrangement, with three plant species and two drying methods, microwave oven and forced-air circulation oven, arranged in a randomized block design with six replications. Leaf samples were analyzed for determining their macronutrient levels.

However, leaves dried in microwave oven showed higher values of sulfur in all three species. <b>Also,</b> <b>Ca</b> content was higher in guava leaves dried in microwave oven...|$|E
40|$|The proper {{distribution}} of mitochondria is particularly vital for neurons {{because of their}} polarized structure and high energy demand. Mitochondria in axons constantly move in response to physiological needs, but signals that regulate mitochondrial movement are not well understood. Aside from producing ATP, Ca 2 + buffering is another main function of mitochondria. Activities of many enzymes in mitochondria are <b>also</b> <b>Ca</b> 2 +-dependent, suggesting that intramitochondrial Ca 2 + concentration is important for mitochondrial functions. Here, we report that mitochondrial motility in axons is actively regulated by mitochondrial matrix Ca 2 +. Ca 2 + entry through the mitochondrial Ca 2 + uniporter modulates mitochondrial transport, and mitochondrial Ca 2 + content correlates inversely {{with the speed of}} mitochondrial movement. Furthermore, the miro 1 protein plays a role in Ca 2 + uptake into the mitochondria, which subsequently affects mitochondrial movement. close 211...|$|E
