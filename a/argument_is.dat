5|$|Christoph Benzmuller and Bruno Woltzenlogel Paleo used an {{automated}} theorem prover to validate Scott's version of Gödel's ontological argument. It {{has been shown}} by the same researchers that Gödel's ontological <b>argument</b> <b>is</b> inconsistent. However, Scott's version of Gödel's ontological <b>argument</b> <b>is</b> consistent and thus valid.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the original function of lactation (milk production) was to keep eggs moist. Much of the <b>argument</b> <b>is</b> based on monotremes, the egg-laying mammals.|$|E
5|$|The <b>argument</b> <b>is</b> {{extended}} to 'all the organized {{parts of the}} works of nature'. Paley considers whether chance alone could explain these, and concludes not.|$|E

40|$|The {{paper is}} a short {{presentation}} {{of some of the}} main ideas of the author's "Practical Theory of Argument". The function of <b>arguments</b> <b>is</b> analysed in an epistemological way, it is: rationally convincing, i. e. leading to new knowledge. Then, the way of functioning of <b>arguments</b> <b>is</b> analysed, i. e. presenting material which guide a process of cognizing the thesis. On this basis the structure of arguments which fulfil the function of <b>arguments</b> <b>is</b> determined, first for deductive arguments. Finally an outlook on non-deductive <b>arguments</b> <b>is</b> given...|$|R
50|$|<b>Arguments</b> <b>are</b> pushed right-to-left. The three lexically first (leftmost) <b>arguments</b> <b>are</b> {{passed in}} EAX, EDX, and ECX {{and up to}} four floating-point <b>arguments</b> <b>are</b> passed in ST(0) through ST(3), {{although}} space for them is reserved in the argument list on the stack. Results are returned in EAX or ST(0). Registers EBP, EBX, ESI, and EDI are preserved.|$|R
5|$|Alastair Hudson {{has also}} argued that the fraud <b>argument</b> <b>is</b> {{significantly}} flawed. The theory suggests that liability for the property comes about from fraud; in fact, liability comes about {{as soon as the}} trustee accepts the property to hold on trust, and so the fraud theory is not necessary to bind the trustee's hands.|$|E
5|$|Another {{well-known}} artefact with {{an astronomical}} use is the Antikythera mechanism. In this case {{analysis of the}} artefact, and reference to the description of similar devices described by Cicero, would indicate a plausible use for the device. The <b>argument</b> <b>is</b> bolstered {{by the presence of}} symbols on the mechanism, allowing the disc to be read.|$|E
5|$|The frailty of the <b>argument</b> <b>is</b> that {{it implies}} that God, a being which does not suffer from transworld depravity by the {{assumption}} of omnibenevolence, is unable to recreate a transworld-depravity-free being, which is seemingly contradictory to the assumption of omnipotence.|$|E
25|$|Normal order: The leftmost, {{outermost}} redex {{is always}} reduced first. That is, whenever possible the <b>arguments</b> <b>are</b> substituted {{into the body}} of an abstraction before the <b>arguments</b> <b>are</b> reduced.|$|R

5|$|There is also {{a debate}} in the {{linguistic}} literature whether Greenlandic has noun incorporation. This is because Greenlandic does not allow the kind of incorporation common in many languages in which a noun root {{can be incorporated into}} almost any verb to form a verb with a new meaning. On the other hand, Greenlandic does often form verbs that include noun roots. The question then becomes whether to analyse these verb formations as incorporation or as denominal derivation of verbs. Greenlandic has a number of morphemes that require a noun root as their host and which form complex predicates that correspond closely in meaning to what is often seen in languages that have canonical noun incorporation. Linguists who propose that Greenlandic does have incorporation argue that these morphemes are in fact verbal roots that must obligatorily incorporate nouns to form grammatical clauses. This <b>argument</b> <b>is</b> supported by {{the fact that many of}} the derivational morphemes that form denominal verbs work almost identically to canonical noun incorporation. They allow the formation of words with a semantic content corresponding to an entire English clause with verb, subject and object. Another <b>argument</b> <b>is</b> that the morphemes used to derive denominal verbs come from historical noun incorporating constructions that have become fossilized. Other linguists maintain that the morphemes in question are simply derivational morphemes that allow the formation of denominal verbs. This <b>argument</b> <b>is</b> supported by the fact that the morphemes cannot occur without being latched on to a nominal element. The examples below illustrate how Greenlandic forms complex predicates including nominal roots.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{evidence}} of this theory is uncovered by examining Twin pregnancies. The main <b>argument</b> <b>is,</b> if there are social behaviors that are inherited and developed before birth, then one should expect twin foetuses to engage {{in some form of}} social interaction before they are born. Thus, ten foetuses were analyzed {{over a period of time}} using ultrasound techniques. Using kinematic analysis, the results of the experiment were that the twin foetuses would interact with each other for longer periods and more often as the pregnancies went on. Researchers were able to conclude that the performance of movements between the co-twins were not accidental but specifically aimed.|$|E
5|$|Ryholt dates Sheshi's reign to the mid 18th century BC. His main <b>argument</b> <b>is</b> the {{presence}} of seals of Sheshi and of two kings of the mid 13th Dynasty Sekhemrekhutawy Khabaw and Djedkheperew in the Egyptian fort of Uronarti in Nubia. The fort of Uronarti was abandoned {{at some point in}} the 13th Dynasty, an event which Ryholt dates to the reign of Djedkheperew given the lack of seals attributable to subsequent kings. Ryholt thus proposes that Sheshi reigned from c. 1745 BC until 1705 BC and was a contemporary of Khabaw and Djedkheperew.|$|E
50|$|In {{computer}} science, {{a function}} accepting a variable number of <b>arguments</b> <b>is</b> called variadic. In logic and philosophy, predicates or relations accepting a variable number of <b>arguments</b> <b>are</b> called multigrade, anadic, or variably polyadic.|$|R

5|$|Studies {{examining}} the health impact of sugars are inconclusive. The United Nations meta-analysis and WHO studies showed contrasting impacts of sugar in refined and unrefined forms. Other studies indicated variable results between health effects, particularly on obesity, {{and whether the}} research {{was funded by the}} sugar industry or those by independent sponsors. The 'empty calories' <b>argument</b> <b>is</b> that a diet high in added sugar will reduce consumption of foods that contain essential nutrients.|$|E
5|$|The {{debate about}} whether Tyrannosaurus was a {{predator}} or a pure scavenger {{is as old as}} the debate about its locomotion. Lambe (1917) described a good skeleton of Tyrannosaurus close relative Gorgosaurus and concluded that it and therefore also Tyrannosaurus was a pure scavenger, because the Gorgosaurus teeth showed hardly any wear. This <b>argument</b> <b>is</b> no longer taken seriously, because theropods replaced their teeth quite rapidly. Ever since the first discovery of Tyrannosaurus most scientists have speculated that it was a predator; like modern large predators it would readily scavenge or steal another predator's kill if it had the opportunity.|$|E
5|$|The {{second of}} these {{theories}} is the genocide hypothesis, which {{asserts that the}} aboriginal populations of the Northern and Western Isles were eradicated and replaced wholesale with settlers of Scandinavian stock. The strength of this <b>argument</b> <b>is</b> the almost total replacement of pre-existing place names by those of Norse origin {{throughout much of the}} region. Its weakness is that the place name evidence is from a relatively late date and the nature of this transition remains controversial. Genetic studies show that Shetlanders have almost identical proportions of Scandinavian matrilineal and patrilineal ancestry, suggesting that the islands were settled by both men and women in equal measure.|$|E
50|$|If {{the value}} of {{only some of the}} <b>arguments</b> <b>are</b> known, the {{compiler}} may still be able to perform some level of compile-time function execution (partial evaluation), possibly producing more optimized code than if no <b>arguments</b> <b>were</b> known.|$|R
5000|$|Such {{interleaving}} of keywords and <b>arguments</b> <b>is</b> {{meant to}} improve readability of code, since <b>arguments</b> <b>are</b> explained by their preceding keywords.

50|$|This will {{compute the}} average of an {{arbitrary}} number of arguments. Note that the function does not know the number of arguments or their types. The above function expects that the types will be , and {{that the number of}} <b>arguments</b> <b>is</b> passed in the first <b>argument</b> (this <b>is</b> a frequent usage but by no means enforced by the language or compiler). In some other cases, for example printf, the number and types of <b>arguments</b> <b>are</b> figured out from a format string. In both cases, this depends on the programmer to supply the correct information. If fewer <b>arguments</b> <b>are</b> passed in than the function believes, or the types of <b>arguments</b> <b>are</b> incorrect, this could cause it to read into invalid areas of memory and can lead to vulnerabilities like the format string attack.|$|R
5|$|This <b>argument</b> <b>is</b> {{based in}} part on the U.S. Supreme Court {{decision}} in the case of United States v. Bevans. In Bevans, the parties argued over whether a federal court in Massachusetts had jurisdiction over the case of a U.S. Marine charged with a murder that occurred on a ship in Boston Harbor. No issues regarding federal income taxation or the Internal Revenue Code were presented to or decided by the Court in the Bevans case. The Internal Revenue Code and the Internal Revenue Service did not yet exist in 1818, when the Bevans murder case was decided.|$|E
5|$|After Reggie catches Delsin vandalizing a billboard, their {{subsequent}} <b>argument</b> <b>is</b> interrupted when a military truck carrying three Conduit prisoners crashes on the Akomish reservation. Two of the Conduits escape, but Delsin manages {{to pull the}} third one, Hank, out of the wreckage, and inadvertently absorb his smoke powers. Shocked and frightened, Delsin pursues Hank {{in an effort to}} figure out what has happened and how to control his powers. However, they are both cornered by Brooke Augustine. She encases Hank in concrete and questions Delsin, suspecting him of hiding something. Delsin can choose to either tell Augustine the truth about his powers or reveal nothing. Regardless, Augustine renders him unconscious before moving on to the other tribe members.|$|E
5|$|Alvin Plantinga's {{free will}} defense {{is a logical}} {{argument}} developed by American analytic philosopher Alvin Plantinga, the John A. O'Brien Professor of Philosophy Emeritus at the University of Notre Dame, and published in its final version in his 1977 book God, Freedom, and Evil. Plantinga's <b>argument</b> <b>is</b> a defense against the logical problem of evil as formulated by philosopher J. L. Mackie beginning in 1955. Mackie's formulation of the logical problem of evil argued that three attributes of God, omniscience, omnipotence, and omnibenevolence, in orthodox Christian theism are logically incompatible with the existence of evil. In 1982, Mackie conceded that Plantinga's defense successfully refuted his argument in The Miracle of Theism, {{though he did not}} claim that the problem of evil had been put to rest.|$|E

5|$|Architecture {{during the}} early English Renaissance was far less formal than that of {{mainland}} Europe and drew from a greater selection of motifs both ancient and modern, with less emphasis placed on the strict observance of rules derived from antique architecture. This {{has led to an}} argument that the style was an evolution of Gothic rather than an innovation imported from Europe. This <b>argument</b> <b>is</b> evident at Montacute, where Gothic pinnacles, albeit obelisk in form, are combined with Renaissance gables, pediments, classical statuary, ogee roofs and windows appearing as bands of glass. This profusion of large, mullioned windows, an innovation of their day, give the appearance that the principal façade is built entirely of glass; a similar fenestration was employed at Hardwick Hall in Derbyshire. However, despite the Dutch gables, a feature of the English Renaissance acquired as the style spread from France across the Low Countries to England, and the Gothic elements, much of the architectural influence is Italian.|$|E
5|$|Cochrane's own sympathies lie most {{strongly}} with utilitarianism and liberalism; {{his own account}} is most influenced by them. He argues that rights derived from considerations of interests can protect individual animals and place limits on {{what can be done}} to them. These rights cannot be violated, even in the name of the greater good, which means that the cultural and economic practices of human beings will be affected. Anticipating criticism, Cochrane explains that not every interest leads to a right. A full consideration of this <b>argument</b> <b>is</b> outside the scope of the book. The argument was expanded in Cochrane's Animal Rights Without Liberation (2012) which, though published after An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory, was based on his doctoral thesis.|$|E
5|$|Rowan {{was known}} {{throughout}} his life as an avid gamester. On January 29, 1801, Rowan joined Dr. James Chambers and three other men for a game of cards at Duncan McLean's Tavern in Bardstown. After several beers and games of whist, Chambers suggested playing Vingt-et-un for money instead. Rowan had determined not to gamble during this session of gaming, but impaired by the alcohol, he agreed. After a few hands, an argument broke out between Chambers and Rowan. The exact nature of the <b>argument</b> <b>is</b> not known. Some accounts claim it was over who was better able to speak Latin and Greek; others suggest that general insults were exchanged between the two men. A brief scuffle followed the disagreement.|$|E
