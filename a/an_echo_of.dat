Although {{he has been}} noted to be <b>an</b> <b>echo</b> <b>of</b> similar detached shōnen manga characters, the duality of Kakashi's apathetic and serious sides have been praised. Kakashi has been highly popular with the Naruto reader base, placing high in several popularity polls. Merchandise based on Kakashi has also been released, including key chains and plush dolls.|$|E
5|$|The various {{historically}} driven {{changes have}} had a very significant influence on the architectural space of the city. Most other Polish cities have suffered similarly, but the processes in Białystok, {{have had a}} particularly intense course. Numerous historic works of architecture no longer exist, while many others have been rebuilt to their original configuration. Very few historic buildings of the city have been preserved – the sights are merely <b>an</b> <b>echo</b> <b>of</b> the old historical shape of Białystok.|$|E
5|$|Fleming {{also used}} {{historical}} references {{for some of}} his names and Marc-Ange Draco's name is based upon that of El Draco, the Spanish nickname for Sir Francis Drake, a fact also used by J. K. Rowling for the naming of her character Draco Malfoy. For Tracy's background, Fleming used that of Muriel Wright, a married wartime lover of Fleming's, who died in an air-raid and Bond's grief {{for the loss of}} his wife is <b>an</b> <b>echo</b> <b>of</b> Fleming's at the loss of Wright. Fleming did make mistakes in the novel, however, such as Bond ordering a half-bottle of Pol Roger Champagne: Fleming's friend Patrick Leigh Fermor pointed out that Pol Roger was the only champagne at the time not to be produced in half-bottles.|$|E

5|$|This is an {{apparently}} rare example of Western Australian swan symbolism being transferred eastward, then transformed to symbolise something else, retaining only <b>an</b> <b>echo</b> <b>of</b> its formerly symbolic values. None {{of the current}} AFL teams have taken a black swan emblem in allusion to any natural qualities of the bird, and its sole representation in the symbology of the league refers to the largely unresearched phenomenon of late 19th-mid 20th century migration between Western Australia and Victoria - now borne by a club that has emigrated to New South Wales. It is an ironic transformation in the symbolism of a bird that that was for so long thought to be non-migratory.|$|E
5|$|The grandsons are {{depicted}} {{in very different}} styles: Alessandro acts in a formal manner and wears clothes of similar colour and tones to Paul. Ottavio, by contrast, wears the browns of the upper right-hand passage, {{an area of the}} painting that cuts him physically from the pope. His pose is awkward and difficult to interpret, but he is rendered in a more naturalistic manner than his brother. Alessandro has a distracted, brooding expression. He holds the knob of Paul's backrest, in <b>an</b> <b>echo</b> <b>of</b> Raphael's portrait where Clement VII holds the chair of Leo X as an indicator of his ambitions of succession. Thus Alessandro seems better placed politically, standing to Paul's right in a pose that recalls traditional depictions of Paul the Apostle, and his hand is raised as if in blessing. In the end, Paul was unable to influence his succession after Charles V weakened the Medici hold on the office.|$|E
5|$|During {{the final}} stages of Ceaușescu's rule, when {{liberalization}} was curbed, matein writings were rediscovered and reclaimed by the Optzeciști group of authors, themselves noted for attempting to evade cultural guidelines by adopting fantasy and avant-garde literature. Mircea Cărtărescu, a leading exponent of the Optzeciști and an advocate of Postmodernism, referred to Caragiale as one of his interwar precursors, while Ștefan Agopian acknowledged he pursued Mateiu's interests in his 1981 novel Tache de catifea ("Tache de Velvet"). According to critic Dumitru Ungureanu, it was mainly through Radu Albala that the matein model seeped into the work of various Optzeciști—Cărtărescu, Horia Gârbea and Florin Șlapac among them. Another Postmodernist author, Fundulea native Mircea Nedelciu, paid tribute to matein prose by basing a character of his 1986 novel Tratament fabulatoriu ("Confambulatory Treatment") on Caragiale, and again much later, by adopting the same practice in his final novel Zodia Scafandrului ("Sign of the Deep-sea Diver"). The isolated Postmodernist figure and former Communist Party ideologue Paul Georgescu is also believed to have used elements of Craii... as inspiration for his novels of the 1980s. In parallel, as <b>an</b> <b>echo</b> <b>of</b> mateism, more critics grew interested in subjects relating to Caragiale's work. Various comprehensive monographs were published after 1980, including a volume edited by the Museum of Romanian Literature and two influential works written by, respectively, Alexandru George and philosopher Vasile Lovinescu. The latter, with its claim to uncover esoteric layers in Matein texts, remains controversial.|$|E

Once again, Adrastus accidentally killed Croesus' son and then committed suicide.|$|E
25|$|Schopenhauer's {{politics}} were, for {{the most}} part, <b>an</b> <b>echo</b> <b>of</b> his system of ethics (the latter being expressed in Die beiden Grundprobleme der Ethik, available in English as two separate books, On the Basis of Morality and On the Freedom of the Will).

25|$|The {{difficulty}} and unmotivated appearance of these algorithms has long led educators to question this curriculum, advocating the early teaching of more central and intuitive mathematical ideas. One notable movement {{in this direction}} was the New Math of the 1960s and 1970s, which attempted to teach arithmetic {{in the spirit of}} axiomatic development from set theory, <b>an</b> <b>echo</b> <b>of</b> the prevailing trend in higher mathematics.|$|E

25|$|In 1975 Lynch allowed Charles Haughey {{to return}} to his Front Bench as Spokesperson on Health. There was much media {{criticism}} of Lynch for this move.

25|$|The {{struggle}} between Hutchinson and the magistrates was <b>an</b> <b>echo</b> <b>of</b> a larger struggle at work throughout the Christian world {{between those who}} believed in direct, personal, and continuing revelation from God (Anabaptists) and those who believed that the Bible represented the final authority on revelation from God (Calvinism, Lutheranism, and Anglicanism). The first group regarded the continuing revelations which they were receiving as equal in authority to Scripture, while the latter group saw Scripture as ultimately authoritative.|$|E
