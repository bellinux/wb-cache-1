5000|$|An <b>alcoholmeter</b> is a {{hydrometer}} {{that indicates}} the alcoholic strength of liquids which are essentially {{a mixture of}} alcohol and water. It {{is also known as}} a proof and Tralles hydrometer (after Johann Georg Tralles, but commonly misspelled as traille and tralle). It measures the density of the fluid. Certain assumptions are made to estimate the amount of alcohol present in the fluid. Alcoholometers have scales marked with volume percents of [...] "potential alcohol", based on a pre-calculated specific gravity. A higher [...] "potential alcohol" [...] reading on this scale is caused by a greater specific gravity, assumed to be caused by the introduction of dissolved sugars. A reading is taken before and after fermentation and approximate alcohol content is determined by subtracting the post fermentation reading from the pre-fermentation reading.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Aims: There is sparse {{literature}} on drink alcohol content in developing countries. This study documented {{detailed information on}} drink sizes and ethanol content of alcoholic beverages consumed in three different parts of India. Methods: Data primarily from formative phases of studies on alcohol use patterns in the states of Delhi, Rajasthan and Goa are reported. Participant observation and semi-structured interviews with key informants and drinking respondents {{were used to assess}} different beverage types and to empirically measure actual drink sizes as poured. Investigation of ethanol content included the use of biochemical analyses, the <b>alcoholmeter</b> and the Analox Analyser AM 3. Respondents interviewed in the post-formative phase in one study were also asked to define the volume of their drinks by indicating pour levels in select drinking vessels. Results: A wide range of alcoholic drinks were documented that varied in ethanol concentration across and within sites. Drink sizes, particularly for high-strength beverages, varied both by study site and respondent, with pours of distilled spirits on average being larger than standard measures. Conclusion: Estimates of both mean volume of alcohol consumption and heavy drinking amounts are influenced by variability in alcohol concentration and respondent-defined pour sizes. The variation in drink alcohol content found across Indian states indicates that prior to conducting quantitative surveys, preliminary work on sources of drink alcohol content variation should be undertaken to tailor measurement tools to specific beverages and drinking practices observed. Recommendations for alcohol research in developing countries are provided...|$|E

A obten??o da imagem de um objeto por scanner geralmente usa uma barra de radia??o, que ao atingir a imagem, reflete a radia??o para o sensor permitindo a reconstru??o e armazenamento da imagem digital. Cada imagem, gerada de acordo com o sistema vermelho-verde-azul (RGB), fornece uma matriz de valores das componentes RGB. A norma dos vetores RGB foi adotada como resposta anal?tica para a constru??o das curvas de titula??o baseadas nas imagens digitais. Para avaliar os resultados obtidos com o alco?metro com aqueles obtidos por imagens digitais, um teste t emparelhado foi aplicado ao conjunto de dados para um n?vel de confian?a de 95 %.
