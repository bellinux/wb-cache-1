5|$|Qeshm Island {{is part of}} the Simply Folded Belt, {{the most}} seismically active part of the Zagros fold and thrust belt. Similar to most {{earthquakes}} in the area, the 2005 event resulted from reverse slip faulting. Since it lies in such a seismically active area, there is <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> destructive earthquakes in Iran; 1 in 3,000 deaths are attributable to earthquakes. One geophysicist has cited the lack of strict building codes as a serious concern.|$|E
5|$|Significant {{severe weather}} was ongoing {{at the start}} of April 27 and {{continued}} for the entire day virtually unbroken. For the second day in a row, the SPC issued <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> severe weather for the Southern United States, and late that morning the SPC increased the probability for tornadoes to 45 percent along a corridor from Meridian, Mississippi, to Huntsville, Alabama, an extremely rare issuance exceeding the high risk standards. Conditions for tornadoes became increasingly favorable for an extreme tornado outbreak.|$|E
5|$|The use of {{alprazolam}} {{during pregnancy}} {{is associated with}} congenital abnormalities, and use in the last trimester may cause fetal drug dependence and withdrawal symptoms in the post-natal period as well as neonatal flaccidity and respiratory problems. However, in long-term users of benzodiazepines, abrupt discontinuation due to concerns of teratogenesis has <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> causing extreme withdrawal symptoms and a severe rebound effect of the underlying mental health disorder. Spontaneous abortions may also result from abrupt withdrawal of psychotropic medications, including benzodiazepines.|$|E
50|$|Some arrhythmias do {{not cause}} symptoms, {{and are not}} {{associated}} with increased mortality. However, some asymptomatic arrhythmias are associated with adverse events. Examples include <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> blood clotting within the heart and <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> insufficient blood being transported to the heart because of weak heartbeat.

5|$|A UTI affects {{parts of}} the urinary system {{including}} the urethra, bladder, and kidneys. There is about a one percent risk of UTIs in boys under two years of age, {{and the majority of}} incidents occur {{in the first year of}} life. There is good but not ideal evidence that circumcision of babies reduces the incidence of UTIs in boys under two years of age, and there is fair evidence that the reduction in incidence is by a factor of 310 times (100 circumcisions prevents one UTI). Prevention of UTIs does not justify routine use of the procedure, however. Circumcision is most likely to benefit boys who have <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> UTIs due to anatomical defects, and may be used to treat recurrent UTIs.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> severe storms—the {{first such}} {{issuance}} since April7, 2006—was issued {{for a large}} part of the Deep South for March1 as the cold front moved eastward. The activity began almost immediately, with several isolated tornadoes taking place that morning across the Mississippi Valley, with one of them leading to the first fatality of the outbreak. Isolated tornadoes were also reported as far north as Illinois, near the center of the low. However, the most intense activity began around noon and continued throughout the afternoon and evening, with southern Alabama and southern Georgia hit the hardest. Nearly continuous supercells formed north of the Gulf of Mexico and produced many tornadoes, some of which hit large population centers with devastating effects. Twenty people were killed by those tornadoes.|$|E
5|$|After {{the mint}} closed, it {{performed}} {{a variety of}} functions for the Federal government. It was first downgraded to an assay office for the U.S. Treasury {{as it had been}} from 1876 to 1879. Then, in 1932, the assay office closed and the building was converted into a Federal prison, in which capacity it served until 1943. The Coast Guard then took over the building as a nominal storage facility, though in truth the structure was largely abandoned and left to decay until it was transferred to the state of Louisiana in 1965. During the Cold War, when many believed there to be <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> nuclear war, the old Mint was considered to be the best fallout shelter in the city.|$|E
50|$|A meta {{analysis}} of all trials from 2010 confirmed <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> heart failure and a double risk when rosiglitazone was administered as add-on therapy to insulin. Two meta analyses {{of real life}} cohortstudies found <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> heart failure against pioglitazone. There were 649 excess cases of heart failure every 100,000 patients who receive rosiglitazone rather than pioglitazone.|$|R
30|$|The “frailty syndrome” {{is defined}} as an individual’s {{inherent}} vulnerability leading to difficulties to overcome acute stress [33, 34]. The frailty model includes areas such as physiological functioning, comorbidities, functional impairment and social difficulties [34, 35]. An easy-to-use Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) was proposed in 2008, ranking patients in nine group from “very fit” to “terminally ill” (Table  1) (Additional file 1) [36, 37]. An increased CFS is associated with <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> mortality [36]. Furthermore, frailty is associated with <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> falls, worsening mobility and institutional care [38]. A recent meta-analysis concludes that there is <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> not returning to home and <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> in-hospital and long-term mortality in frail patients admitted to the ICU [33]. In the VIP 1 study, which included 5132 critically ill patients[*]≥[*] 80  years from 311 European ICUs, frailty (CFS[*]>[*] 4) was present in 43.1 % and was independently related to ICU (22.2 %) and 30 -day mortality (35.8 %) [39].|$|R

5|$|An {{entry level}} diver must learn the {{techniques}} of breathing underwater through a demand regulator, including clearing it of water and recovering it if dislodged from the mouth, and clearing the mask if it is flooded. These are critical survival skills, and if not competent the diver is at <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> drowning. A related skill is sharing breathing gas with another diver, both as the donor and the recipient. This is usually done with a secondary demand valve carried for this purpose. Technical and professional divers will also {{learn how to use}} a backup gas supply carried in an independent scuba set, known as the emergency gas supply or bailout cylinder.|$|E
5|$|On February 5 at 6:39am CST (1239 UTC), the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) issued <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> severe storms {{for most}} of Arkansas, the first in February since 1998. At 10:16 am CST (1616 UTC), the high risk area was {{extended}} farther northeast to include western Kentucky, northwestern Mississippi, the Missouri Bootheel, West Tennessee, and Southern Illinois. A moderate risk of severe weather was issued for northwestern Alabama, the rest of Arkansas, the rest of southern Illinois, southern Indiana, {{most of the rest}} of Kentucky, northern Louisiana, central Mississippi, parts of southeastern Missouri, southwestern Ohio, eastern Oklahoma, middle Tennessee and northeastern Texas. A total of fifteen watches were issued by the SPC during the outbreak, including thirteen tornado watches (two of which were PDS watches) and two severe thunderstorm watches.|$|E
5|$|On May 5, the SPC issued <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> {{severe weather}} for Central Kansas and central Nebraska, while {{moderate}} and slight risks for severe weather extended for areas far beyond. The low pressure {{system in place}} moved northward, but the extending front had barely moved. The storms were quick to develop. Severe weather reports were already coming in by late morning, and the first tornado reports came in during the early afternoon hours. The most intense activity {{took place during the}} late afternoon and evening hours as supercells developed along a long line from South Dakota to North Texas. Over 80 tornadoes were confirmed that day, along with hail as large as softballs and straightline winds as strong as 90mph (145km/h). The activity weakened in the late evening, but not before the last tornadoes were reported in Iowa in the overnight hours.|$|E

5|$|The ACCP {{recommended}} {{treatment for}} three months in those with proximal DVT provoked by surgery. A three-month course is also recommended for those with proximal DVT provoked by a transient risk factor, and three months is suggested over lengthened treatment when bleeding risk is low to moderate. Unprovoked DVT patients {{should have at least}} three months of anticoagulation and be considered for extended treatment. Those whose first VTE is an unprovoked proximal DVT are suggested for anticoagulation longer than three months unless there is <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> bleeding. In that case, three months is sufficient. Those with a second unprovoked VTE are recommended for extended treatment when bleeding risk is low, suggested for extended treatment when bleeding risk is moderate, and suggested {{for three months}} of anticoagulation in high-risk scenarios.|$|E
5|$|The Fijian parrotfinch is {{endemic to}} a single country; {{although}} its population is unknown, it is described as uncommon or locally common. In the absence of evidence for any decline in numbers, its population {{is believed to be}} stable, and it is therefore classed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. It is protected under Schedule 2 of Fiji's Endangered and Protected Species Act 2002, which regulates the import and trade of species that are not thought to be at <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> extinction, but may be threatened if trade in those species is not regulated. In the early 20th century, Europeans in Fiji kept these finches as cagebirds, calling them croton finches because of their liking for the croton bush, but the pet trade appears not to be a significant factor at present.|$|E
5|$|The Trait du Nord is large, with stallions {{weighing}} {{upwards of}} , and is bred for traction ability and pulling power. The breed {{is found in}} many solid colors, although bay and roan are the most common, and {{is known to be}} gentle and easy to handle. Two slightly different types of Trait du Nord are found – a larger type used for heavier pulling and a lighter type used for faster work. The breed is considered to be endangered by the French government, with fewer than 100 new foal births a year. The national breed registry in France is working with local groups in an attempt to promote this breed and bring population numbers back up. The breed currently has <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> inbreeding, due to the low number of breeding stallions, and is at risk of extinction.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{the system}} being {{classified}} as a tropical depression, <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> landfall near Port Arthur, Texas was noted, giving federal officials sufficient lead time to warn local residents about a possible approaching hurricane. As the system neared landfall, tropical cyclone watches and warnings were issued for the Gulf Coast of the United States. At 1200UTC on June25, the National Hurricane Center issued a gale warning and a hurricane watch, stretching from Port O'Connor, Texas {{to the mouth of}} the Mississippi River. A few hours later, a hurricane warning was issued for area west of Morgan City, Louisiana to Freeport, Texas. In advance of the approaching storm, roughly 22,000residents were evacuated, with 10,000from Galveston County, Texas alone.|$|E
5|$|A strong {{jet stream}} moved {{northeast}} across the Great Plains region {{and a strong}} surface low in western Kansas strengthened as it moved to the Nebraska-South Dakota border. Ahead of the low, very warm and moist air spread throughout the South Central United States into Nebraska, eastern sections of South Dakota and the upper Mississippi Valley. The combination of strong winds and warm and moist air created conditions favorable for strong thunderstorms. On June 5, <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> severe weather was issued for six different states in the Midwestern United States, with a moderate risk area surrounding the high risk area. Forecasters had warned of a potentially historic outbreak, as computer forecasting models for June 5resembled those on June 8, 1974, when 39tornadoes struck the southern Great Plains and killed 22people. Wichita State University canceled evening classes because of the weather predictions. Severe weather began developing across eastern Colorado and northwestern Kansas during the morning and into the early afternoon, producing several weak tornadoes in the process. An EF1tornado impacted a campground near Kellogg, Iowa and injured two people. Despite extremely favorable conditions, severe weather for the day was limited and the tornadoes generally caused minimal damage.|$|E
5|$|Fixtures between Millwall and West Ham United are {{currently}} categorised by the Metropolitan Police as category C– games which carry <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> disorder amongst supporters. For the 2011–12 season, the Metropolitan Police implemented London-wide operations {{to ensure that}} the games passed by without any incident. In 2013 a member of West Ham's hooligan Inter City Firm was jailed for 12 months for organising violence between West Ham and Millwall fans during an FA Cup match between Dagenham & Redbridge and Millwall on 7 January 2012. He chose this game in the belief fewer police would be in attendance at a match in Dagenham, but who instead, turned out in force to prevent trouble. In November 2014 the two sides' development squads were drawn against each other in the U21 Premier League Cup. The Metropolitan Police took preventative measures against any trouble occurring, demanding the game at Rush Green kick-off at 12pm and be played behind closed doors.|$|E
