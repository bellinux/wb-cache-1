25|$|John Leslie (1766–1832) noted a {{weakness}} in the views of Amontons and Coulomb: If friction arises from a weight being drawn up the inclined plane of successive <b>asperities,</b> why then isn't it balanced through descending the opposite slope? Leslie was equally skeptical {{about the role of}} adhesion proposed by Desaguliers, which should on the whole have the same tendency to accelerate as to retard the motion. In Leslie's view, friction should be seen as a time-dependent process of flattening, pressing down <b>asperities,</b> which creates new obstacles in what were cavities before.|$|E
25|$|The van der Waals {{force of}} {{adhesion}} is also {{dependent on the}} surface topography. If there are surface <b>asperities,</b> or protuberances, that result in a greater total area of contact between two particles or between a particle and a wall, this increases the van der Waals force of attraction {{as well as the}} tendency for mechanical interlocking.|$|E
25|$|Tectonic {{earthquakes}} occur {{anywhere in}} the earth where there is sufficient stored elastic strain energy to drive fracture propagation along a fault plane. The sides of a fault move past each other smoothly and aseismically only {{if there are no}} irregularities or <b>asperities</b> along the fault surface that increase the frictional resistance. Most fault surfaces do have such <b>asperities</b> and this leads to a form of stick-slip behavior. Once the fault has locked, continued relative motion between the plates leads to increasing stress and therefore, stored strain energy in the volume around the fault surface. This continues until the stress has risen sufficiently to break through the asperity, suddenly allowing sliding over the locked portion of the fault, releasing the stored energy. This energy is released as a combination of radiated elastic strain seismic waves, frictional heating of the fault surface, and cracking of the rock, thus causing an earthquake. This process of gradual build-up of strain and stress punctuated by occasional sudden earthquake failure {{is referred to as the}} elastic-rebound theory. It is estimated that only 10 percent or less of an earthquake's total energy is radiated as seismic energy. Most of the earthquake's energy is used to power the earthquake fracture growth or is converted into heat generated by friction. Therefore, earthquakes lower the Earth's available elastic potential energy and raise its temperature, though these changes are negligible compared to the conductive and convective flow of heat out from the Earth's deep interior.|$|E

For this purpose, we calculate the theoretical slip deficit distribution for a given <b>asperity</b> distribution. Then, we synthesize surface displacement data and analyze them to estimate the slip deficit distribution. Next, we conduct a quantitative comparison between the assumed <b>asperity</b> distribution and the estimated slip deficit distribution; hence, we can determine the difference in size and position on the plate interface between the true <b>asperity</b> and the estimated slip deficit. <b>Asperity</b> size is important information for predicting the magnitude of future earthquakes. The position of the <b>asperity</b> affects the strong ground motion prediction, since seismic waves attenuate rapidly with the distance between the observation site and the <b>asperity.</b>|$|R
40|$|Stick slip {{experiments}} were {{performed in a}} direct shear apparatus using large Inada granite blocks. The dimensions of the pre-existing fault surface were 100 cm (length) × 10 cm (width). By applying heterogeneous normal stress using three actuators of which forces could be independently controlled, two asperiti-es with different strengths were formed on a fault plane. Under a certain normal stress distribution, single <b>asperity</b> failure and double <b>asperity</b> failure occurred alternately. The single <b>asperity</b> failure refers to a stick slip event in which a weaker <b>asperity</b> ruptures alone, without triggering the rupture of a stronger as-perity. The double <b>asperity</b> failure is an event in which a rupture of a weak as-perity triggers the rupture of a strong <b>asperity,</b> resulting in {{a failure of the}} whole fault. For triggering of a rupture, it is necessary that stress at the strong <b>asperity</b> is accumulated to a certain level just prior to the failure of the weak <b>asperity...</b>|$|R
30|$|We {{describe}} the {{different stages of}} fault behaviour, including {{the interaction between the}} weak region and the <b>asperity</b> responsible for earthquakes. During the interseismic intervals, the <b>asperity</b> accumulates stress that is released by <b>asperity</b> slip in seismic events. When the <b>asperity</b> slips, it transfers stress to the weak region, triggering the afterslip. In the same way, we expect that afterslip transfers stress back to the <b>asperity,</b> thus changing its state and subsequent evolution. An analytical solution for the evolution equations of the system will be obtained.|$|R
25|$|Static {{friction}} is {{friction between}} {{two or more}} solid objects that are not moving relative to each other. For example, static friction can prevent an object from sliding down a sloped surface. The coefficient of static friction, typically denoted as μs, is usually higher than the coefficient of kinetic friction. Static friction is considered to arise {{as the result of}} surface roughness features across multiple length-scales at solid surfaces. These features, known as <b>asperities</b> are present down to nano-scale dimensions and result in true solid to solid contact existing only at a limited number of points accounting for {{only a fraction of the}} apparent or nominal contact area. The linearity between applied load and true contact area, arising from asperity deformation, gives rise to the linearity between static frictional force and normal force, found for typical Amonton-Coulomb type friction.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe coupled normal-shear contact {{behavior}} of rough surfaces remains {{a problem of}} interest with applications in many practical engineering problems. In this paper, we have further developed a micromechanical approach for obtaining the stress–displacement {{behavior of}} rough interfaces. The micromechanical approach considers the mechanics of <b>asperity</b> contacts and utilizes statistical description of interface roughness. Here we have focused upon the role of <b>asperity</b> contact orientations. To that end, we have incorporated <b>asperity</b> contact relative curvature distribution in our model and derived a relationship for the extent of <b>asperity</b> contact orientations {{in terms of the}} <b>asperity</b> contact relative curvature and interface closure. This relationship allows us to define the range of <b>asperity</b> contact orientation as the interface is subjected to combined normal and shear loading. We have consequently refined our stress–displacement relationship and its numerical evaluation procedure to include the <b>asperity</b> contact relative curvature distributions. We find that the <b>asperity</b> contact relative curvature has a significant effect on the extent of <b>asperity</b> contact orientation, and consequently on the shear behavior of the interface. We also find that the coupling between the normal and the shear responses, the interface frictional strength and the shear displacement hardening behavior are closely related to the extent of <b>asperity</b> contact orientations...|$|R

Elastic deformations and inelastic frictional sliding are considered at inclined <b>asperity</b> contacts. A modified spherical harmonic expansion is used to model the orientation distribution of <b>asperity</b> contacts. Evolution laws for <b>asperity</b> heights and <b>asperity</b> contact orientations are introduced to account for the change in surface roughness resulting from <b>asperity</b> damage under shear.

40|$|The {{important}} aspects of elastohydrodynamic lubrication, with a single, one-dimensional <b>asperity,</b> have been found by solving numerically the coupled transient Reynolds equation and the elasticity equation. Even though the assumption of a single <b>asperity</b> is highly ideal, this study sheds {{some light on the}} effect of surface roughness on elastohydrodynamic lubrication. The results show that the film pressure tends to increase more than the steady state pressure, and in particular, the increase in pressure reaches a maximum as the <b>asperity</b> approaches the inlet of the contact region. The <b>asperity</b> height and the pressure increase above the steady state pressure are closely related to each other; the higher the <b>asperity</b> height, the larger the pressure increase. In the pure rolling case, it has been found that a local pressure peak is not developed. However, in the cases of sliding and rolling, a small, local pressure peak is developed on the pressure profile when the <b>asperity</b> moves into the contact region. In general, the overall film thickness profile increases with increasing <b>asperity</b> height, but is not significantly affected by the <b>asperity</b> width. Moreover, the slope of the overall film thickness profile for the transient cases is much greater than the steady state profile, which is approximately constant across the contact width.
