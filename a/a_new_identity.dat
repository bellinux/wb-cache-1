5|$|When in 2002 {{another life}} {{sentence}} prisoner challenged the Home Secretary's power to set minimum terms, Hindley {{and hundreds of}} others, whose tariffs had been increased by politicians, looked likely {{to be released from}} prison.

The investigation was headed by Superintendent Tony Brett, and initially looked at charging Hindley with the murders of Pauline Reade and Keith Bennett, but the advice given by government lawyers was that because of the DPP's decision taken 15 years earlier, a new trial would probably be considered an abuse of process.|$|E
