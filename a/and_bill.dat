After 10 days on the road, three other Allied personnel—a Frenchman, an Austrian and a Pole—joined the trek, having met Smith <b>and</b> <b>Bill</b> at a partisan camp. The lingua franca of the group having changed to Italian, the five men hiked to the border, where they were taken in by an old farmer, Jean Batiste Chambrin, who gave them {{instructions on how to}} pass the German sentries guarding the border with France.

40|$|Abstract—The future metropolitan-area {{wireless}} mesh networks (WMNs) {{are expected}} to contain compromise-prone Mesh Access Points (MAPs) with a high frequency of inter-domain roaming/handoff events. This paper introduces a novel secure localized authentication <b>and</b> <b>billing</b> (SLAB) scheme, which aims to address both security guarantee and performance in terms of system compromise resilience capability, inter-domain handoff authentication latency, and workload of the roaming broker (RB). With extensive analysis and simulation, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme can be a practical solution for achieving secure roaming <b>and</b> <b>billing</b> in metropolitan-area WMNs.
