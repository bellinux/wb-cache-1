50|$|Camden Assets Recovery Interagency Network (CARIN) is an {{informal}} network of experts-practitioners {{in the field}} of <b>asset</b> <b>tracing,</b> freezing and confiscation. It is an interagency network which means that each member state is represented by a law enforcement officer and a judicial expert (prosecutor, investigating judge, etc. depending on the legal system). The purpose of CARIN is to increase the effectiveness of its members' efforts, on a multi-agency basis, to deprive criminals of their illicit profits. The concept is that the whole process from the starting point in the investigation, to the <b>asset</b> <b>tracing,</b> to end forfeiture/confiscation is covered. The representatives of the member states are called “national contact points”. All of them are English speaking because the working language of the network is English and may be contacted directly by phone or email.|$|E

50|$|In a {{majority}} opinion written by Justice Clarence Thomas, the Court held that plan fiduciaries cannot recover medical expenses from a beneficiary's separate assets unless those <b>assets</b> can be <b>traced</b> {{back to the}} original ERISA payment. Justice Thomas concluded stated that historically, equitable liens have only been available to plaintiffs when plaintiffs can identify the specific property that was wrongfully withheld by the defendant. If a defendant's general <b>assets</b> cannot be <b>traced</b> to funds that were wrongfully withheld, then equitable liens cannot be used to attach untraceable general assets. Justice Thomas therefore held that the Board could not recover the cost of the initial payment from Montanile's general assets. However, because the lower courts did not determine which of Montanile's <b>assets</b> could be <b>traced</b> back to the medical payment, the Supreme Court remanded the case for further proceedings.|$|R

Based on the framework a roadmap for introducing tracking in businesses operations is outlined. The proposed roadmap circumvents the most challenging business cases for introducing tracking and RFID-technology in the supply chain and focuses on asset management as a more accessible route for business. © 2008 Elsevier B.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} investment {{strategies of}} {{three types of}} Dutch institutional investors - pension funds, life insurers and non-life insurers - over the period 1999 - 2005.

We <b>trace</b> <b>asset</b> reallocations back to both active trading and revaluations and link investment decisions to firm-specific characteristics and macroeconomic variables. Overall, our results indicate that all three investor types tend to be contrarian traders, i. e. they buy past losers and sell past winners. Especially pension funds showed this behaviour in the most turbulent part of the sample - the crash of 2002 and early 2003 - implying that these institutions have a stabilising impact on financial markets when this is needed most.

5000|$|The two dissenting judges, Lord Goff and Lord Woolf, {{also thought}} {{that there should be}} no {{resulting}} trust of the money because if a proprietary claim were available, in other cases like this it would have an unfair impact on other creditors of an insolvent debtor, and similarly because it could potentially be unfair if <b>assets</b> could be <b>traced.</b> However, they would have held that compound interest should be available on personal claims. Lord Goff, however, expressly did not enter into a discussion of the points about unjust enrichment that went beyond the scope of the present case. Lord Woolf quoted De Havilland v Bowerbank where Lord Mansfield CJ stated, [...] "that though by the common law, book debts do not of course carry interest, it may be payable in consequence of the usage of particular branches of trade; or of a special agreement". There was no reason why compound interest should not be awarded if it was ordinary commercial practice.|$|R
2500|$|Although {{beneficiaries}} of a trust, or those owed fiduciary duties, will ordinarily wish to sue trustees first for breach of obligations, the trustee may have disappeared, or become insolvent, {{or perhaps the}} beneficiaries will desire to have a specific asset returned. In all these situations, the law allows a limited remedy if a person that received trust property is not [...] "equity's darling": the [...] "bona fide purchaser" [...] of the asset. A bona fide purchaser of property, even if property is received after a breach of trust, has long been held to take free of any claims by prior owners, if they acted in good faith, committed no wrong, and they have paid for the property. When the value in <b>assets</b> is <b>traced,</b> this process is technically said to be [...] "genuinely neutral as to the rights" [...] a claimant may have. Only if recipients have committed additional wrongs, through some form of negligence, knowledge or dishonesty, will they liable, with a good claim {{at the end of}} the tracing process. However, the law is unsettled on what is needed, and divides between a traditional common law or equity approach, on the one hand, and a more modern unjust enrichment and tort law analysis on the other hand. In all cases, however, the recipient must have received property for their [...] "own use and benefit". This means that in cases where solicitors, and potentially banks, or other parties that merely act as conduits, that receive money simply to pass it onto someone else, they have not been regarded as a liable recipient.|$|R
25|$|When {{trustees}} fail {{in their}} main duties, the law imposes remedies {{according to the}} nature of the breach. In general, breaches of rules surrounding performance of the trust's terms can be remedied through an award of specific performance, or compensation. Breaches of the duty of care will trigger a right to compensation. Breaches of the duty to avoid conflicts of interest, and misapplications of property will give rise to a restitutionary claim, to restore the property taken away. In these last two situations, the courts of equity developed further principles of liability that could be applied even when a trustee had gone bankrupt. Some recipients of property that came from a breach of trust, as well as people who had assisted in a breach of trust, might incur liability. Equity recognised not merely a personal, but also a proprietary claim over assets taken in breach of trust, and perhaps also profits made in breach of the duty of loyalty. A proprietary claim meant that the claimant could demand the thing in priority to other creditors of the bankrupt trustee. Alternatively, the courts would follow an <b>asset</b> or <b>trace</b> its value if the trust property was exchanged for some other asset. If trust property had been given to a third party, the trust fund could claim back the property as of right, unless the recipient was a bona fide purchaser. Generally, any recipient of trust property who knew about the breach of trust (or maybe ought to have known) could be made to give back the value, even if they had themselves exchanged the thing for other assets. Lastly, against people who may never have received trust property but had assisted in a breach of trust, and had done so dishonestly, a claim arose to return the property's value.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In {{the pursuit}} of {{enhanced}} competitiveness organisations are today searching for innovative business models in order to foster economic benefits. In Slovenia, several clusters are being formed, including the Slovenian Transport Logistics Cluster (STLC) {{as one of the}} most important. The STLC is currently in the stage of dynamic growth, demanding business model formation and adequate informatisation. The main goal of the paper is to present the informatisation of the STLC, bridging the gap between Supply Chain Management (SCM) and e-Logistics. The STLC’s informatisation of is presented in several phases. The first phase involves business modelling of the existing business processes of organisations (AS-IS model). The results of the first phase allow an in-depth view of the STLC that is used in the future in the business model setup. Next, TO-BE processes are created which are to be implemented and supported via informatisation. The result of the informatisation project is revealed to be homogenous and transparent business activity between cluster members. The purposes of the STLC’s informatisation are to create a business model, standardise business processes, allow cost cutting and improved business performance, reduce operating times, support <b>asset</b> management, and <b>trace</b> shipments which are the basics of economic competitiveness...|$|R
