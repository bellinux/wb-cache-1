5|$|In May 1972, Nutting Associates chief {{engineer}} Nolan Bushnell, {{designer of the}} first commercial arcade video game, Computer Space, saw {{a demonstration of the}} Odyssey at a dealership. Inspired, when he quit Nutting to start his own company, Atari, he assigned Allan Alcorn to create a cheap ping pong arcade game as a training exercise, though he did not tell Alcorn that it was for training nor that the idea was based on the Odyssey Table Tennis game. Alcorn soon developed Pong, which Bushnell recognized as a potential hit, and it became the company's first game. Pong was very successful, and in turn helped drive sales of the Odyssey; Baer once noted that customers bought the console because of Table Tennis, in turn because of Pong, and joked that they may <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> stopped designing games after that game card. In 1974, however, Magnavox sued Atari along with several competitors including Nutting, Allied Leisure, Bally Midway, and Williams Electronics for infringing on Baer's patents for video games played on a television screen. Baer has stated that the lawsuits were not filed right away because Magnavox and Sanders needed to wait until they could expect to be awarded more money than it would cost to pursue the suits. The root of the conflict was a pair of patents by Baer—one which described how the Odyssey showed player-controlled objects, or dots, on a video monitor and described a number of games that could be played with the system, and an earlier one that went into detail about how the Odyssey used that system to have two dots collide with each other and have one bounce off, specifically using a game of ping pong as an example.|$|E

25|$|On 30 October 2012, Polish {{magazine}} Rzeczpospolita {{reported that}} traces of explosives had been detected by investigators {{in the wreckage}} of the Tupolev, on the wings and in the cabin.

Rzeczpospolita's editor-in-chief and three other staff, including the reporter of the initial claim, resigned from their jobs. The author of the article in question, Cezary Gmyz, maintained that what he wrote was confirmed by four independent sources. In November 2015, a court in Poland ruled in favour of the sacked journalists, stating that the information published in the article correctly reflected the state of knowledge at the time of publication.|$|E

500|$|The Iowa State Cyclones {{football}} {{program is a}} college football team that represents Iowa State University in the Big 12 Conference in the National Collegiate Athletic Association. The team has had 32 head coaches since organized football at the school began in 1892, and was officially sanctioned in 1894. Originally, the Iowa Agricultural College teams were known as the Cardinals. The name was changed after September 29, 1895, when under coach Pop Warner, the Cardinals defeated the Northwestern Wildcats, 36–0. Inspired by an extremely active tornado (then known as a [...] "cyclone") season, the next day, the Chicago Tribune headline read: [...] "Struck by a Cyclone." [...] The article went on to say, [...] "Northwestern might <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> tried to play football with an Iowa cyclone as with the Iowa team it met yesterday."

500|$|Near {{the end of}} Tucker's third congressional term in 1824, Thomas Jefferson {{presented}} him with an offer {{on behalf of the}} fledgling University of Virginia, sanctioned by Trustees James Madison and Joseph C. Cabell, to serve as the first Professor of Moral Philosophy. The offer met the school's desire to appoint a non-Federalist to the post, and Tucker's connections with Cabell and St. George would also have facilitated his selection. Another factor was Tucker's recent 1822 Essays on Various Subjects of Taste, Morals, and National Policy, which included papers from the Port Folio. Madison had been provided a copy of these and recommended them to Jefferson, saying they were [...] "among the best answers to the charges of our national ...backwardness." [...] Tucker's selection may <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> been an accommodation to some of the school's opponents, including Episcopalians, Federalists, and notable western Virginians, many of whom were friends of Tucker's. Presumably, his prior monetary indiscretions were overlooked since no related formal charges were extant.|$|E

After Webster's arrest the media continued to search for any outside agency that might have been responsible for the event. From the beginning, media reports highlighted the lack of parental supervision at the party, and in sentencing Webster, Justice Wood made comments criticising the lack of parental supervision. Researchers Jonathan Morrow and Mehera San Roque in the Sydney Law Review wrote that Wood's comments [...] "might <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> been quoted from the very newspapers that were covering the crime"; his comments, in turn, were heavily reported in the media. Webster's sentencing also received considerable media coverage, possibly due to his youth and the length of his sentence, as well as curiosity about the newly established [...] "truth-in-sentencing" [...] principles. His appeal regarding the length of his sentence received similar coverage.|$|E

500|$|Two {{other player}} {{gambling}} affairs marked Landis's early years as commissioner. In 1922, Giants pitcher Phil Douglas, embittered at McGraw for disciplining him for heavy drinking, {{wrote a letter}} to Cardinals outfielder Leslie Mann, suggesting that he would take a bribe to ensure the Giants did not win the pennant. Although Mann had been a friend, the outfielder neither smoked nor drank and had long been associated with the YMCA movement; according to baseball historian Lee Allen, Douglas might <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> sent the letter to Landis himself. Mann immediately turned over the letter to his manager, Branch Rickey, who ordered Mann to contact Landis at once. The Giants placed Douglas on the ineligible list, an action backed by Landis after meeting with the pitcher. [...] On September 27, 1924, Giants outfielder Jimmy O'Connell offered Phillies shortstop Heinie Sand $500 if Sand didn't [...] "bear down too hard against us today". [...] Sand was initially inclined to let the matter pass, but recalling the fate of Weaver and other Black Sox players, told his manager, Art Fletcher. Fletcher met with Heydler, who contacted Landis. O'Connell did not deny the bribe attempt, and was placed on the ineligible list.|$|E
