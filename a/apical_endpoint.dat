40|$|Adverse outcome {{pathways}} (AOPs) organize {{knowledge on}} {{the progression of}} toxicity through levels of biological organization. By determining the linkages between toxicity events at different levels, AOPs {{lay the foundation for}} mechanism-based alternative testing approaches to hazard assessment. Here, we focus on growth impairment in fish to illustrate the initial stages in the process of AOP development for chronic toxicity outcomes. Growth is an <b>apical</b> <b>endpoint</b> commonly assessed in chronic toxicity tests for which a replacement is desirable. Based on several criteria, we identified reduction in food intake to be a suitable key event for initiation of middle-out AOP development. To start exploring the upstream and downstream links of this key event, we developed three AOP case studies, for pyrethroids, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and cadmium. Our analysis showed that the effect of pyrethroids and SSRIs on food intake is strongly linked to growth impairment, while cadmium causes a reduction in growth due to increased metabolic demands rather than changes in food intake. Locomotion impairment by pyrethroids is strongly linked to their effects on food intake and growth, while for SSRIs their direct influence on appetite may play a more important role. We further discuss which alternative tests could be used to inform on the predictive key events identified in the case studies. In conclusion, our work demonstrates how the AOP concept can be used in practice to assess critically the knowledge available for specific chronic toxicity cases and to identify existing knowledge gaps and potential alternative tests...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we propose {{for the first time}} an {{approach}} for the tentative derivation of effect-based water quality trigger values for an <b>apical</b> <b>endpoint,</b> the cytotoxicity measured by the bioluminescence inhibition in Vibrio fischeri. The trigger values were derived for the Australian Drinking Water Guideline and the Australian Guideline for Water Recycling as examples, but the algorithm can be adapted to any other set of guideline values. In the first step, a Quantitative Structure Activity Relationship (QSAR) describing the 50 % effect concentrations, EC 50, was established using chemicals known to act according to the nonspecific mode of action of baseline toxicity. This QSAR described the effect of most of the chemicals in these guidelines satisfactorily, with the exception of antibiotics, which were more potent than predicted by the baseline toxicity QSAR. The mixture effect of 10 - 56 guideline chemicals mixed at various fixed concentration ratios (equipotent mixture ratios and ratios of the guideline values) was adequately described by concentration addition model of mixture toxicity. Ten water samples were then analysed and 5 - 64 regulated chemicals were detected (from a target list of over 200 chemicals). These detected chemicals were mixed in the ratios of concentrations detected and their mixture effect was predicted by concentration addition. Comparing the effect of these designed mixtures with the effect of the water samples, it became evident that less than 1 % of effect could be explained by known chemicals, making it imperative to derive effect-based trigger values. The effect-based water quality trigger value, EBT-EC 50, was calculated from the mixture effect concentration predicted for concentration-dditive mixture effects of all chemicals in a given guideline divided by the sum of the guideline concentrations for individual components, and dividing by an extrapolation factor that accounts for the number of chemicals contained in the guidelines and for model uncertainties. While this concept was established using the example of Australian recycled water, it can be easily adapted to any other set of water quality guidelines for organic micropollutants. The cytotoxicity based trigger value cannot be used in isolation, it must be applied in conjunction with effect-based trigger values targeting critical specific modes of action such as estrogenicity or photosynthesis inhibition.

40|$|An {{emerging}} {{vision for}} toxicity {{testing in the}} 21 st century foresees in vitro assays assuming the leading role in testing for chemical hazards, including testing for carcinogenicity. Toxicity {{will be determined by}} monitoring key steps in functionally validated molecular pathways, using tests designed to reveal chemically-induced perturbations that lead to adverse phenotypic endpoints in cultured human cells. Risk assessments would subsequently be derived from the causal in vitro endpoints and concentration vs. effect data extrapolated to human in vivo concentrations. Much direct experimental evidence now shows that disruption of epigenetic processes by chemicals is a carcinogenic mode of action that leads to altered gene functions playing causal roles in cancer initiation and progression. In assessing chemical safety, it would therefore be advantageous to consider an emerging class of carcinogens, the epigenotoxicants, with the ability to change chromatin and/or DNA marks by direct or indirect effects on the activities of enzymes (writers, erasers/editors, remodelers and readers) that convey the epigenetic information. Evidence is reviewed supporting a strategy for in vitro hazard identification of carcinogens that induce toxicity through disturbance of functional epigenetic pathways in human somatic cells, leading to inactivated tumour suppressor genes and carcinogenesis. In the context of human cell transformation models, these in vitro pathway measurements ensure high biological relevance to the <b>apical</b> <b>endpoint</b> of cancer. Four causal mechanisms participating in pathways to persistent epigenetic gene silencing were considered: covalent histone modification, nucleosome remodeling, non-coding RNA interaction and DNA methylation. Within these four interacting mechanisms, 25 epigenetic toxicity pathway components (SET 1, MLL 1, KDM 5, G 9 A, SUV 39 H 1, SETDB 1, EZH 2, JMJD 3, CBX 7, CBX 8, BMI, SUZ 12, HP 1, MPP 8, DNMT 1, DNMT 3 A, DNMT 3 B, TET 1, MeCP 2, SETDB 2, BAZ 2 A, UHRF 1, CTCF, HOTAIR and ANRIL) were found to have experimental evidence showing that functional perturbations played “driver” roles in human cellular transformation. Measurement of epigenotoxicants presents challenges for short-term carcinogenicity testing, especially in the high-throughput modes emphasized in the Tox 21 chemicals testing approach. There is need to develop and validate in vitro tests to detect both, locus-specific, and genome-wide, epigenetic alterations with causal links to oncogenic cellular phenotypes. Some recent examples of cell-based high throughput chemical screening assays are presented that have been applied or have shown potential for application to epigenetic endpoints...|$|E

Specifically, nitrapyrin induced a dose-related increase in the Cyp 2 b 10 /CAR-associated transcript and protein. Interestingly, the corresponding enzyme activity (7 -pentoxyresorufin-O-dealkylase (PROD) was not enhanced due to nitrapyrin-mediated suicide inhibition of PROD activity. Nitrapyrin exposure elicited a clear dose-responsive increase in hepatocellular proliferation in wild-type mice, but not in CAR knock-out mice, informing that CAR activation is an obligatory key event in this test material-induced hepatocarcinogenesis.

So far, ecotoxicology focuses mainly on <b>apical</b> <b>endpoints</b> such as growth, lethality and reproduction, but does not consider sublethal toxic effects that may indirectly cause ecological effects. One such sublethal effect is toxicant-induced impairment of neurosensory functions which will affect important behavioural traits of exposed organisms. Here, we critically review the mechanosensory lateral line (LL) system of zebrafish as a model to screen for chemical effects on neurosensory function of fish in particular and vertebrates in general. The LL system consists of so-called neuromasts, composed of centrally located sensory hair cells, and surrounding supporting cells. The function of neuromasts is the detection of water movements that is essential for the fish's ability to detect prey, to escape predator, to socially interact or to show rheotactic behaviour. Recent advances in the study of these organs provided researchers with a broad area of molecular tools for easy and rapid detection of neuromasts dysfunction and/or disturbed development. Further, genes involved in neuromasts differentiation have been identified using auditory/mechanosensory mutants and morphants.

Although valuable for predicting fish full life-cycle toxicity, FELS tests are labor and resource intensive and, due to an emphasis on <b>apical</b> <b>endpoints,</b> provide little to no information about chemical mode of action.

We explore the utility of toxicogenomics in risk assessment, using published gene expression data from C 57 BL/ 6 mice exposed to 18, 54 and 162 μg Printex 90 carbon black nanoparticles (CBNP). Analysis of CBNP-perturbed pathways, networks and transcription factors revealed concomitant changes in predicted phenotypes (e. g., pulmonary inflammation and genotoxicity), that correlated with dose and time. Benchmark doses (BMDs) for <b>apical</b> <b>endpoints</b> were comparable to minimum BMDs for relevant pathway-specific expression changes.

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Master of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. Evidence suggests that chemicals acting as endocrine disruptors can modulate amphibian sex differentiation and induce sex reversal and gonadal abnormalities. However, consequences of gonadal abnormalities such as testicular oocytes on amphibian reproductive potential remain unclear. Assessing this linkage requires suitable experimental models, such as partial life-cycle exposure, in order to correlate accessible <b>endpoints</b> with <b>apical</b> <b>endpoints</b> indicative of reproductive fitness. Larvae of the emerging amphibian model Silurana tropicalis were exposed to EE 2 in the ng/L range from NF stage 51 - 52 until completion of metamorphosis, and endpoints related to the reproductive function were assessed on completion of metamorphosis and at sexual maturity. Exposure to EE 2 skewed the sex ratio toward phenotypic females in the treated groups, but also affected growth {{and development of the}} tadpoles. At sexual maturity, absence of one or both oviducts was observed in some female frogs that had been exposed to EE 2. Regressed testicular oocytes were observed in most males, including males from the control group. The occurrence of regressed testicular oocytes seems to be dependent on genetic background, rather than xenoestrogens exposure. Mature testicular oocytes and presence of oviduct-like ducts in frogs displaying testis were only seen in treatment groups exposed to EE 2. The incidence and the severity of gonadal abnormalities observed in Silurana tropicalis males and females exposed to EE 2 were dependent on the nominal dose but also dependent on parentage. No link could be made between gonadal abnormalities and the reproductive potential of the frogs. These findings suggest that further development of partial life cycle models using Silurana tropicalis may be warranted in order to support identification and characterization of endocrine disrupters in chemical safety testing, for risk assessment and registration...|$|R
40|$|The anuran Xenopus tropicalis tadpole is an {{attractive}} model animal in toxicological evaluation of suspected thyroid disrupting xenobiotics. Due to its reliance of a functioning hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis for normal metamorphosis, effects on the HPT axis produces <b>apical</b> <b>endpoints,</b> which are easy to measure. More sensitive endpoints of mRNA expression and histological evaluation of the thyroid gland itself provide strong indications of in vivo thyroid endocrine disruption. X. tropicalis is traditionally exposed in groups of 20 animals in four replicates for each treatment group. However, exposing tadpoles individually can provide stronger statistics and a reduction of total animal sacrifice. In this study we have developed and optimized an individual exposure system by a method development study. This method was then applied in an exposure experiment of a suspected thyroid endocrine disruptor, propylparaben (PrP). Prometamorphotic (NF stage 51) X. tropicalis tadpoles were distributed in three treatment groups (0. 05, 0. 5 and 5. 0 mg PrP/L water) and maintained semi-statically for 14 days. Afterwards, apical measurements (body weight (BW), total body length (BL), snout to vent length (SVL) and hind limb length (HLL)) and reached developmental stage were assessed. In addition, mRNA expression of HPT axis relevant genes encoding deiodinase 2 (D 2, hepatic tissue), deiodinase 3 (D 3, hepatic and tail tissue) and transthyretin (Ttr, hepatic tissue) were measured by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). The PrP exposure did not affect general growth and development, but it did cause a downregulation of dio 3 and ttr. The downregulation of dio 3 could possibly {{be associated with a}} reduced serum content of thyroid hormone, while ttr might be connected to a previously described xenoestrogenic effect of PrP in vitro and in fish...|$|R
3000|$|While {{these efforts}} are promising, {{there is still}} a great deal of {{uncertainty}} regarding the use of in vitro tests as a replacement of in vivo assays. Specifically, {{there is a lack of}} understanding of the relevance of results obtained by means of in vitro assays to whole organisms. In vitro systems often represent highly simplified and/or artificial (e.g. yeast cells transfected with a human receptor) systems that lack the complexity of an organism with its feedback loops, cross-talk between different biological pathways, metabolism, etc. There have been a few studies in the past that compared in vitro with in vivo data, and which have produced ambiguous results (e.g. [57, 58]). In general, however, our understanding of the biological pathways currently used in vitro assays are [...] "equipped" [...] with is rather limited, and there is need for additional studies specifically designed to address these uncertainties. Similarly, many in vitro but also some in vivo assays make decisions based on effects that are measured at the sub-organismal (molecular, sub-cellular or cellular) level. What is often lacking, though, is the ability to link these endpoints with biological relevant responses [59]. Thus, one of the key future challenges is to align the primary mechanistic data obtained by means of genomic or other sub-organismal studies with outcomes of demographic relevance such as survival and reproduction. In fact, recent efforts are underway to align the mechanistic data obtained by means of genomic or other sub-organismal studies with <b>apical</b> <b>endpoints</b> that are required in risk assessment, and which have been termed adverse outcome pathways (AOPs; [60]). AOPs present a promising concept that aims to identify critical initiating molecular events that are specific to certain vital pathways. For example, vitellogenin (VTG; egg yolk protein) production by females is a pre-requisite for successful egg production in egg-laying vertebrates, and inhibition of VTG synthesis has been successfully used as a predictor of decreased fecundity [60].|$|R
40|$|Determining mechanism-based {{biomarkers}} {{that distinguish}} adaptive and adverse cellular processes {{is critical to}} understanding {{the health effects of}} environmental exposures. Shifting from in vivo, low-throughput toxicity studies to high-throughput screening (HTS) paradigms and risk assessment based on in vitro and in silico testing requires utilizing toxicity pathway information to distinguish adverse outcomes from recoverable adaptive events. Little work has focused on oxidative stresses in human airway for the purposes of predicting adverse responses. We hypothesize that early gene expression-mediated molecular changes could be used to delineate adaptive and adverse responses to environmentally-based perturbations. Here, we examined cellular responses of the tracheobronchial airway to zinc (Zn) exposure, a model oxidant. Airway derived BEAS- 2 B cells exposed to 2 - 10 μM Zn 2 + elicited concentration- and time-dependent cytotoxicity. Normal, adaptive, and cytotoxic Zn 2 + exposure conditions were determined with traditional <b>apical</b> <b>endpoints,</b> and differences in global gene expression around the tipping point of the responses were used to delineate underlying molecular mechanisms. Bioinformatic analyses of differentially expressed genes indicate early enrichment of stress signaling pathways, including those mediated by the transcription factors p 53 and NRF 2. After 4 h, 154 genes were differentially expressed (p < 0. 01) between the adaptive and cytotoxic Zn 2 + concentrations. Nearly 40 % of the biomarker genes were related to the p 53 signaling pathway with 30 genes identified as likely direct targets using a database of p 53 ChIP-seq studies. Despite similar p 53 activation profiles, these data revealed widespread dampening of p 53 and NRF 2 -related genes as early as 4 h after exposure at higher, unrecoverable Zn 2 + exposures. Thus, in our model early increased activation of stress response pathways indicated a recoverable adaptive event. Overall, this study highlights the importance of characterizing molecular mechanisms around the tipping point of adverse responses to better inform HTS paradigms...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: International {{concern over}} {{endocrine}} active substances (EASs) {{has led to}} intensive research programs to establish fish reproductive and developmental toxicity tests for use in environmental (ecological) risk assessment. This chapter gives an overview of key themes of in vivo ecotoxicology research, including fish screening assays, partial life-cycle tests (the draft Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) fish reproduction test and the new fish development test) and fish full life-cycle tests. In {{the context of the}} OECD test guidelines program, fish species of primary interest include fathead minnow, medaka, and zebrafish, while guppy, rainbow trout, sheepshead minnow, and three-spined stickleback are also of scientific importance. Critical factors for evaluation include baseline reproductive biology and definition of EAS sensitive life-stages. For regulatory applications, a critical review of existing fish EAS data suggests that <b>apical</b> adverse effect <b>endpoints,</b> namely development, growth and reproduction (e. g., fecundity, fertilization rates and hatching success) should be used to derive predicted no effect concentrations (PNECs) for the environmental risk assessment of EASs. In support of these <b>apical</b> adverse effect <b>endpoints,</b> biomarker responses (e. g., vitellogenin, gonadal-somatic index, and gonad histopathology) should be used to provide mechanistic data, compare species (e. g., cyprinids vs. salmonids) and allow extrapolation between laboratory and field studies...|$|R
40|$|Human {{exposures}} to {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAHs) occur as components of complex mixtures. Evaluations of health risks posed by complex mixtures containing PAHs rely on the toxicological knowledge of prioritized PAH mixture components, assuming that these PAHs share a common mode of action and that {{the sum of the}} contributions of these PAHs equals the toxic potency of the mixture (i. e., additivity). Traditional toxicity testing methods emphasizing <b>apical</b> <b>endpoints</b> have had limited success at evaluating the validity of these assumptions. Toxicogenomic tools that are able to rapidly generate toxicologically-relevant and mechanistic information have gained acceptance in the regulatory arena for individual chemicals; however, the applicability of these tools for chemical mixtures has been inadequately addressed. This thesis used toxicogenomic tools to (1) improve the understanding of mechanisms underlying the adverse, toxicological responses induced by individual PAHs and (2) evaluate the contention that transcriptional profiles and pathway information can be used to critically examine interactions between individual PAHs in PAH-containing mixtures, and the assumption of additivity. Microarrays were used to profile gene expression changes (transcriptomes) in forestomach, liver, and lung tissues (targets of PAH exposure) from mice orally exposed to three doses of eight individual PAHs, two defined PAH mixtures, and one complex PAH-containing mixture (coal tar). The results revealed that each PAH induced transcriptional changes that were significantly associated with several pathways implicated in carcinogenesis. However, despite a uniform ability to induce DNA damage (i. e., DNA adducts), mutations, and increases in enzyme activity, the pathways differ across PAHs and tissues. A novel strategy that employs single-PAH transcriptome data to models of additivity revealed that the assumption of additivity in PAH mixtures is valid at the pathway level; however, the independent action model of additivity yielded better estimates compared to concentration addition (used in human health risk assessment of PAH mixtures) or generalized concentration addition. Additionally, predicted and observed coal tar-induced transcriptional benchmark doses were comparable to those derived from previously published coal tar-induced murine lung tumour incidence data. Overall, this thesis demonstrates the utility of toxicogenomic data to expand the current understanding regarding the toxic potential of individual PAHs and PAH-containing complex mixtures...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{legislative}} mandates worldwide are requiring systematic {{consideration of}} much {{larger numbers of}} chemicals. This necessitates more efficient and effective toxicity testing, as a basis to be more predictive in a risk assessment context. This in turn requires much more emphasis early {{in the design of}} test strategies on both potential exposure and mechanism or modes of toxicity and a resulting shift based on the latter, from hazard identification to hazard characterization in order to group substances and additionally inform development of predictive computational tools. It also requires a much better common understanding in the regulatory risk assessment community of the nature of appropriate information to inform consideration of mode of action and resulting implications for dose-response and ultimately, risk characterization. This requires a shift in focus from the previously principally qualitative considerations of toxicological science to the necessarily more predictive and quantitative focus of risk assessment and has implications for appropriate communication and training of risk assessors. Human relevance of mode of action frameworks continue to {{play a critical role in}} hypothesis generation and the systematic consideration of the weight of evidence supporting the use of mechanistic data in regulatory risk assessment. Framework analyses increase the transparency of delineation of the relative degrees of uncertainty associated with various options for consideration in dose-response and risk characterization for impacted populations. Framework analyses are also instrumental in acquiring transparency on critical data gaps that will further reduce uncertainty. As such, they force distinction of choices made on the basis of science policy versus those that are science judgment related, including reliance on default, based on erroneous premise that it is always health protective. The potential of these frameworks to increase consistency and transparency in decision making contributes to increase common understanding among communities and jurisdictions. They are an important tool for coordination and communication between the research and regulatory risk assessment communities. They are also an essential “bridge” in the evolution of toxicity testing to be more predictive, relevant and risk-based, through relation of early perturbations to <b>apical</b> <b>endpoints</b> in a context relevant to current application in regulatory risk assessment. As we move forward to develop more integrative test strategies to meet evolving and demanding regulatory mandates to deal efficiently with significantly larger numbers of chemicals including groups and combined exposures, early assimilation of the information in a mode of action context as envisaged by application of these frameworks is essential...|$|R
40|$|NERC Post Genomics and Proteomics ProgrammeIn {{this thesis}} {{the effects of}} {{individual}} and multiple environmental stressors (physical and chemical) are examined in inbred and outbred zebrafish (Danio rerio, Hamilton), a model species used in ecotoxicology and environmental risk assessment (ERA). The central question addressed is, are inbred laboratory animals representative and protective of wild populations? That is, are inbred fish equally or more sensitive to chemicals and other stressors compared with more outbred (wild) fish? A combination of tools and approaches incorporating traditional (eco) toxicology and population genetics have been employed, together with more contemporary molecular genetics and population modelling, to compare and contrast a range of responses in inbred and outbred zebrafish exposed to the endocrine disrupting chemical clotrimazole and/or temperature elevation in the laboratory. The choice of test species was based on our broad understanding of its basic biology, extending from the molecular level to the population level, and its wide use as a model organism in (eco) toxicology. Selection of the test chemical clotrimazole and temperature {{was based on a}} shared mode of action, aromatase inhibition, and therefore their ability to block oestrogen production, impair reproduction, promote male development and skew population sex ratios in zebrafish. A cascade of responses were compared in inbred and outbred zebrafish, including changes in the levels of expression of genes for gonadal aromatase and other steroidogenic enzymes, circulating sex steroid hormones, gonadal sex differentiation and development (via gonadal histopathology) and reproductive fitness (female fecundity, paternity and viability of embryos). Amongst the most striking results were directional skews in sex ratio towards males in response to clotrimazole (Chapter 5) and elevated temperature exposure (Chapter 7). Inbred fish were generally more responsive compared to outbreds, which showed evidence of physiological and developmental compensation, resulting in lower male-sex skews and superior fitness in terms of male reproductive success (paternity and viability of embryos). The greater effects observed in inbred fish were attributed to inbreeding×environment interactions and the amplification of inbreeding depression. Although no empirical genetic evidence of this mechanism is presented (loss of heterozygosity at quantitative trait loci and concomitant loss of heterosis and/or the expression of recessive, deleterious alleles in homozygotes), supporting evidence was provided by increased phenotypic variance in some <b>apical</b> <b>endpoints</b> in inbred fish, including specific growth rate and fecundity. This increased variance also has the potential to counteract the higher levels of response observed in inbreds, because the power to detect statistically significant changes in responses is reduced. This trade-off was demonstrated for specific growth rate. Crucially, significant male-sex ratio skews (> 80...|$|R

Many of these chemicals {{are thought to}} perturb endocrine function, leading to declines in reproductive health and fertility, and increases {{in the incidence of}} cancer, metabolic disorders and diabetes. There are over 90 million unique chemicals registered under the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS), of which only 308, 000 were subject to inventory and/or regulation, in September 2013. However, as a specific aim of the EU REACH regulations, the UK is obliged to reduce the chemical safety initiatives reliance on in vivo <b>apical</b> <b>endpoints,</b> promoting the development and validation of alternative mechanistic methods. The human health cost of endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC) exposure in the EU, has been estimated at € 31 billion per annum. In light of the EU incentives, this study aims to evaluate current in silico and in vitro tools for EDC screening and hazard characterisation; testing the hypothesis that in silico virtual screening accurately predicts in vitro mechanistic assays. Nuclear receptor binding interactions are the current focus of in silico and in vitro tools to predict EDC mechanisms. To the author’s knowledge, no single study has quantitatively assessed the relationship between in silico nuclear receptor binding and in vitro mechanistic assays, in a comprehensive manner. Tripos ® SYBYL software was used to develop 3 D-molecular models of nuclear receptor binding domains. The ligand binding pockets of estrogen (ERα and ERβ), androgen (AR), progesterone (PR) and peroxisome proliferator activated (PPARγ) receptors were successfully modelled from X-ray crystal structures. A database of putative-EDC ligands (n= 378), were computationally ‘docked’ to the pseudo-molecular targets, as a virtual screen for nuclear receptor activity. Relative to in vitro assays, the in silico screen demonstrated a sensitivity of 94. 5 %. The SYBYL Surflex-Dock method surpassed the OECD Toolbox ER-Profiler, DfW and binary classification models, in correctly identifying endocrine active substances (EAS). Aiming to evaluate the current in vitro tools for endocrine MoA, standardised ERα transactivation (HeLa 9903), stably transfected AR transactivation (HeLa 4 - 11) assays in addition to novel transiently transfected reporter gene assays, predicted the mechanism and potency of test substances prioritised from the in silico results (n = 10 potential-EDCs and 10 hormone controls). In conclusion, in silico SYBYL molecular modelling and Surflex-Dock virtual screening sensitively predicted the binding of ERα/β, AR, PR and PPARγ potential EDCs, and was identified as a potentially useful regulatory tool, to support EAS hazard identification...|$|R
40|$|Chemical {{contamination}} of the environment and thus of aquatic ecosystems is steadily increasing. Whenever environmental pollutants enter a water body, they affect not only the water, but also the sediment. Substances that bind to sediment particles can be stored for a long time, whereby sediments act as sinks for some contaminants. Therefore, sediment assessments often more accurately describe the {{contamination of}} a water body than investigations of the water itself. Among environmental chemicals, endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) have gained more and more attention in recent years. Since they interfere with endocrine systems and may disturb reproduction, they endanger the survival of populations or even species. Hazardous substances enter the aquatic environment by different pathways, with sewage treatment plants (STPs) belonging to the most important contamination sources. The main objective of this work is a comprehensive sediment assessment of predominantly small surface waters in the German federal state of Hesse. The 50 study sites, located in 44 different creeks and small rivers, are situated in the densely populated and economically important Frankfurt/Rhine-Main area, as well as in rural and less urbanized regions. Chemical analytical data, provided by the Hessian Agency for the Environment and Geology (HLUG), indicated different contamination levels of the study sites. In order to investigate the general toxicity of the sediment samples, the oligochaete Lumbriculus variegatus and the midge Chironomus riparius were exposed to whole sediments and <b>apical</b> <b>endpoints</b> regarding biomass, survival, and reproduction were determined. In further experiments, special attention was paid to the contamination with endocrine active compounds. For this purpose, the reproductive success of the New Zealand mudsnail Potamopyrgus antipodarum was analyzed after exposure to whole sediments. Additionally, a yeast-based reporter gene assay was applied with sediment eluates to assess the estrogenic and androgenic activity of the samples. Biotest results were compared with chemical analysis data to investigate whether the test organisms reflect the measured pollution of the study sites and if the observed effects can be explained by chemical contamination. Five study sites, all located less than 1 km downstream of a STP discharger, were selected for further investigations {{based on the results of}} the sediment monitoring. The sediments from these sites were conspicuous due to their general toxic and/or estrogenic activity. In order to investigate whether the observed effects can be ascribed to the effluents, an active biomonitoring study was conducted with the mudsnail P. antipodarum and the zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha, exposed at study sites located up- and downstream of the discharger. In addition to endocrine activity, genotoxic effects were investigated using the comet assay and the micronucleus assay. Endocrine activity was examined based on the reproductive output of P. antipodarum and the content of vitellogenin-like proteins in D. polymorpha. Yeast-based reporter gene assays were used to estimate the endocrine potential (estrogen, anti-estrogen, anti-androgen, dioxin-like) of sediment and water samples. 22...|$|R
40|$|The {{access to}} clean water {{is one of}} the {{prerequisites}} for a modern, industrialized society. The amount of water withdrawn for human activities has risen exponentially during the last 100 years. This rise in water use is accompanied by the production of vast quantities of contaminated water. These wastewaters may be contaminated by substances ranging from heavy metals and organic compounds to nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorous. The aggregate effect of combinations of water contaminants can be difficult to predict as different contaminant substances may interact, leading to additive, synergistic or antagonistic toxic effects in a receiving aquatic ecosystem. With increasing water quality legislation, the pressure to characterize and potentially treat contaminated waters increases. Suitable effect-based assessment methods may greatly reduce the costs of both the wastewater characterization process and the water treatment evaluation. The overall aim of this thesis was to show how a combination of ecotoxicity bioassays may be employed in water treatment method development for initial characterization, assessment of treatment requirements and finally treatment evaluation. The wastewaters characterized originated from different activities such as waste management, metal surfacing and explosives destruction. To fully assess the hazard of the waters sampled, a holistic approach using a combination of chemical tests and bioassays was taken. A combination of acute and chronic assays was used to determine mode-of-action effects and <b>apical</b> <b>endpoints</b> in the aquatic environment. The basic battery consisted of the acute Vibrio fischeri test, the chronic algae test using Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and either the planktonic crustacean Daphnia magna (for aqueous samples) or the meiobenthic crustacean Heterocypris incongruens (for whole-sediment/soil samples).  In addition to the basic test battery, the mode-of-action Salmonella typhimurium test was used to assess genotoxic effects. Results from the water hazard characterization show that ecotoxicological tests contribute to the evaluation of treatment methods for complex wastewaters by assessing the aggregate biological effect of water treatment. The tests may be used as a screening method to indicate where further treatment may be required, even when chemical measurements show a satisfactory reduction of known contaminants. The toxic effect exerted by the assessed waters did not always correlate with measured levels of contaminants or the chemical measures of bioavailability, e. g. leached fraction. The water treatment evaluation showed that the industrial by-product pine bark is an effective adsorbent for capturing metal contaminants from landfill leachates and stormwater. The pine bark column filter had higher zinc removal efficiency than the polonite filter and the combination filter column with pine bark/polonite. In conclusion, a pine bark filter is a suitable alternative to activated carbon for small-scale, decentralized treatment of wastewaters. Furthermore, the ecotoxicity tests were able to detect effects of unknown contaminants and provided unique characterization data, which complemented the information provided by the chemical analyses.

All of these previous approaches suffer from limitations. In the present study, the authors draw on experience from previous prioritization exercises and present a holistic approach for prioritizing pharmaceuticals in the environment in terms of risks to aquatic and soil organisms, avian and mammalian wildlife, and humans. The approach considers both <b>apical</b> ecotoxicological <b>endpoints</b> as well as potential nonapical effects related to the therapeutic mode of action. Application of the approach is illustrated for 146 active pharmaceuticals that are used either in the community or in hospital settings in the United Kingdom. Using the approach, 16 compounds were identified as a potential priority. These substances include compounds belonging to the antibiotic, antidepressant, anti‐inflammatory, antidiabetic, antiobesity, and estrogen classes as well as associated metabolites. In the future, the prioritization approach should be applied more broadly around the different regions of the world. Environ Toxicol Chem 2016; 9999 : 1 – 10. © 2016 SETA...|$|R
