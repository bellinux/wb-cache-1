If somewhere inside such binary systems are injected very high energy (VHE) γ-rays, {{as suggested by}} some Cherenkov observations, they may initiate the inverse Compton e ± pair cascade in the soft radiation of a massive companion, and the detected high energy γ-ray emission {{may be caused by}} the secondary γ-rays of such cascade process. Since VHE γ-rays has to propagate in the anisotropic radiation of a massive star (the place of injection does not cover with the source of soft radiation), the intensities of secondary γ-rays depend on the <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>observation</b> measured from direction defined by the place of injection of VHE γ-rays and the center of a massive star. We compute γ-ray spectra formed in such anisotropic cascade by using the Monte Carlo method. It is found that the intensity of secondary γ-rays does not varies strongly for the <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>observation</b> greater than ∼ 90 o, but the highest intensities are observed at the angles corresponding to the limb of a massive star. Moreover, some cascade γ-rays can also emerge from behind the massive star, i. e. from the opposite site than the location of a source of primary γ-rays. This interesting feature can be called as a focusing of γ-rays by the soft radiation of a massive star...|$|R

A TF signal model is proposed and studied using two statistical descriptors related to the signal stationary aspect and coherence in the time-frequency domain.

Finally, some description of PolSAR data TF correlation properties are proposed and commented. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{opposition}} surge (sometimes {{known as}} the opposition effect, opposition spike or Seeliger effect) is the brightening of a rough surface, or an object with many particles, when illuminated from directly behind the observer. The term is most widely used in astronomy, where generally {{it refers to the}} sudden noticeable increase in the brightness of a celestial body such as a planet, moon, or comet as its phase <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>observation</b> approaches zero. It is so named because the reflected light from the Moon and Mars appear significantly brighter than predicted by simple Lambertian reflectance when at astronomical opposition. Two physical mechanisms have been proposed for this observational phenomenon: shadow hiding and coherent backscatter.|$|E
50|$|Iridescence is {{an optical}} {{phenomenon}} of surfaces in which hue changes with the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>observation</b> and {{the angle of}} illumination. It is often caused by multiple reflections from two or more semi-transparent surfaces in which phase shift and interference of the reflections modulates the incidental light (by amplifying or attenuating some frequencies more than others). The thickness of the layers of the material determines the interference pattern. Iridescence can for example be due to thin-film interference, the functional analogue of selective wavelength attenuation as seen with the Fabry-Pérot interferometer, and {{can be seen in}} oil films on water and soap bubbles. Iridescence is also found in plants, animals and many other items. The range of colours of natural iridescent objects can be narrow, for example shifting between two or three colours as the viewing angle changes, or a wide range of colours can be observed.|$|E
50|$|Teams {{dress in}} the nearby Dr. Romain Clerou Field House, located up the hill from the field next to the gym and {{swimming}} pool complex. The field house contains B.C.'s practice and game locker room and offers an adjacent locker room for a visiting team with showers. Teams often opt to use the larger men's locker room in the gym when visiting. The field and stadium are unusual {{in that it is}} not on a traditional north-south axis from goal post to goal post. Due to being built into a pre-existing ravine the axis of the field runs at an approximate northeast-southwest angle. The northeast end of the stadium is closed into the top of the ravine which was filled in to build a parking lot with a concourse connecting each side of the stadium. Most football fields are built on a north-south axis with the press box on the western sideline so that the press box is not looking into the setting sun. Memorial Stadium's press box is built so that the sun sets to its left-front. The press box was built on this side so that it would overlook the track's finish line which could only be built on {{the eastern side of the}} stadium due to the closed end on the north end of the stadium. If the finish line was on the western side then it would be out of view of most of the spectators and the press box would have an indirect <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>observation.</b> Because of this emphasis on track and field the scoreboard operator was and still is positioned at the finish line on the field near the northern 30-yard line. This necessitates the use of a spotter on the roof of the press box to relay down, distance, and the yard line to the scoreboard operator with a walkie-talkie. Another quirk due to the odd angle of the stadium is the naming of the two seating areas. The campus side of the stadium is officially called the northern side and the Mt. Vernon Avenue side is called the southern side. Most people refer to the campus side as the western side and the Mt. Vernon Avenue side as the eastern side. Because the stadium was built prior to the Americans With Disabilities Act there are no elevators or escalators. It is 64 steps from the bottom row to the top row of the lower deck. From there to get to the press box you need to go behind the superstructure to enter the steps to the upper deck mezzanine, then go up to the entrance to the seating area, then go up the aisle to the press box, a tedious workout! The press box is partitioned into two coaches booths which is separated by the George Pavletich Memorial Radio Booth named for longtime KERN-1410 AM radio play-by-play announcer George Pavletich. The main room is sectioned into an upper and lower seating area for media with the P.A. announcer stationed here. There is a small bathroom on the back side of the press box. The roof of the press box is used to film games from, has been used to broadcast live local television coverage of B.C. football games from, and used to broadcast live internet webcasts by visiting teams.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the collective spontaneous emission {{in a system}} of two identical quantum dots (QDs) strongly coupled through the dipole-dipole (d-d) interaction. The QDs are modeled as two-level quantum objects, while the d-d interaction is described as the exchange of a virtual photon through the photonic reservoir. The master equation approach is used in the analysis. The main attention is focused on antenna characteristics of the two-QD system—the radiation intensity dependence on the meridian and azimuthal <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>observation.</b> We show that the radiation pattern of such a system is nonstationary and its temporal behavior depends on the initial quantum state. In particular, for entangled initial states the radiative pattern exhibits oscillations on the frequency which corresponds to the d-d interaction energy. We also analyze spectral properties of the directional diagram. The comparison of radiation patterns is carried out for two QDs and two classical dipoles. The concept of quantum nanoantenna is proposed based on collective spontaneous emission in QD ensembles...|$|R

Geometrical aspect <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>observations</b> were about 10 °. One short event was considered. For this event, the electron ¯ow direction was changing periodically (period about 9 minutes) presumably due {{to the passage of}} a magnetospheric MHD wave through the ionosphere. It was found that for the radar observations along the electrojet ¯ow, the skewness had the same sign as the mean Doppler shift with average absolute values in between 0. 5 ± 1. 0. For observations perpendicular to the electrojet ¯ow, spectra were more symmetrical (average skewness was around 0) and the sign of the skewness was sometimes opposite to the sign of the mean Doppler shift. These observations are interpreted in terms of contribution from both the Farley-Buneman and gradient-drift instabilities to the resultant spectrum. Di€erences with radar observations at small aspect angles are discussed. ...|$|R
