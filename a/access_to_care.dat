5|$|Given {{the limited}} {{resources}} of many developing nations, funding vitally effects how emergency medicine {{fits into the}} health system. Preventive care is {{a crucial part of}} healthcare in developing countries, and {{it may be difficult to}} budget for emergency medicine without cutting into those resources. This is a particular problem for poorer nations such as Zambia, which had a per capita health expenditure of 23 US dollars in 2003. Regardless of the amount of preventive care available, health problems requiring immediate attention will still occur, and emergency medical programs could increase <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>care.</b> Kobusingye et al. argue that expanding emergency medicine does not need to be unreasonably expensive, particularly if developing countries focus on low-cost but effective treatments administered by first responders.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of {{cultural}} factors that reinforce this practice. These include the child's financial future, her dowry, social ties and social status, prevention of premarital sex, extramarital pregnancy and STIs. The arguments against it include interruption of education and loss of employment prospects, and hence economic status, as well as loss of normal childhood and its emotional maturation and social isolation. Child marriage places the girl in a relationship where she is in a major imbalance of power and perpetuates the gender inequality that contributed to the practice in the first place. Also in the case of minors, there are the issues of human rights, non-consensual sexual activity and forced marriage and a 2016 joint report of the WHO and Inter-Parliamentary Union places the two concepts together as Child, Early and Forced Marriage (CEFM), as did the 2014 Girl Summit (see below). In addition the likely pregnancies at a young age are associated with higher medical risks for both mother and child, multiple pregnancies and less <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>care</b> with pregnancy being amongst the leading causes of death amongst girls aged 15–19. Girls married under age {{are also more likely to}} be the victims of domestic violence.|$|E

40|$|<b>Access</b> <b>to</b> health <b>care</b> is an {{important}} resource for sexually experienced adolescent females {{in the prevention of}} unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections, including HIV. However, a paucity of research exists regarding the extent to which social disparities in <b>access</b> <b>to</b> health <b>care</b> exist among this vulnerable population of adolescents, including the potential contribution of the neighborhood context. Therefore, the primary aims of this dissertation were to examine (1) the extent to which racial and socioeconomic disparities in <b>access</b> <b>to</b> health <b>care</b> exist among sexually experienced adolescent females, (2) the extent <b>to</b> which <b>access</b> <b>to</b> health <b>care</b> among sexually experienced adolescent females varies across neighborhoods, and (3) {{the extent to which the}} neighborhood racial and socioeconomic context contribute to racial and socioeconomic disparities in <b>access</b> <b>to</b> health <b>care</b> among sexually experienced adolescent females. A multilevel design was employed for this dissertation utilizing secondary data from Wave I of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health). Analyses included hierarchical generalized linear modeling to examine the receipt of a routine physical, the receipt of contraceptive services, and reported unmet health needs among the dissertation sample of 1, 526 sexually experienced Non-Hispanic Black and Non-Hispanic White adolescent females between 15 years to 19 years of age who were dispersed across 546 neighborhoods. After adjusting for a variety of factors that may influence <b>access</b> <b>to</b> health <b>care,</b> the findings revealed no racial disparities and few socioeconomic disparities in <b>access</b> <b>to</b> health <b>care</b> among this sample of adolescents. No significant relationship was noted between the neighborhood racial and socioeconomic context and <b>access</b> <b>to</b> health <b>care</b> or social disparities in <b>access</b> <b>to</b> health <b>care</b> among this sample of adolescents. However, the findings revealed that <b>access</b> <b>to</b> health <b>care</b> among this sample of sexually experienced adolescent females varied across neighborhoods, above and beyond the individual composition of the neighborhood. Further studies are indicated to explore the underlying factors that contribute to socioeconomic disparities in <b>access</b> <b>to</b> health <b>care</b> among sexually experienced adolescent females, and the potential neighborhood characteristics that may contribute <b>to</b> differential <b>access</b> <b>to</b> health <b>care</b> across neighborhoods among this vulnerable population of adolescents...|$|R

5|$|Of {{near miss}} events, {{obstetrical}} fistulae (OF), including vesicovaginal and rectovaginal fistulae, remain {{one of the}} most serious and tragic. Although corrective surgery is possible it is often not available and OF is considered completely preventable. If repaired, subsequent pregnancies will require cesarian section. While unusual in developed countries, it is estimated that up to 100,000 cases occur every year in the world, and that about 2 million women are currently living with this condition, with the highest incidence occurring in Africa and parts of Asia. OF results from prolonged obstructed labor without intervention, when continued pressure from the fetus in the birth canal restricts blood supply to the surrounding tissues, with eventual fetal death, necrosis and expulsion. The damaged pelvic organs then develop a connection (fistula) allowing urine or feces, or both, to be discharged through the vagina with associated urinary and fecal incontinence, vaginal stenosis, nerve damage and infertility. Severe social and mental consequences are also likely to follow, with shunning of the women. Aprt from lack of <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>care,</b> causes include young age, and malnourishment. The UNFPA has made prevention of OF a priority and is the lead agency in the Campaign to End Fistula, which issues annual reports and the United Nations observes May 23 as the International Day to End Obstetric Fistula every year. Prevention includes discouraging teenage pregnancy and child marriage, adeaquate nutrition, and access to skilled care, including caesarian section.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, the United Nations created Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 5 {{to improve}} {{maternal}} health. Target 5A sought to reduce maternal mortality by three quarters from 1990 to 2015, using two indicators, 5.1 the MMR and 5.2 {{the proportion of}} deliveries attended by skilled health personnel (physician, nurse or midwife). Early reports indicated MDG 5 had made the least progress of all MDGs. By the target date of 2015 the MMR had only declined by 45%, from 380 to 210, most of which occurred after 2000. However this improvement occurred across all regions, but the highest MMRs were still in Africa and Asia, although South Asia witnessed the largest fall, from 530 to 190 (64%). The smallest decline {{was seen in the}} developed countries, from 26 to 16 (37%). In terms of assisted births, this proportion had risen globally from 59 to 71%. Although the numbers were similar for both developed and developing regions, there were wide variations in the latter from 52% in South Asia to 100% in East Asia. The risks of dying in pregnancy in developing countries remains fourteen times higher than in developed countries, but in Sub-Saharan Africa, where the MMR is highest, the risk is 175 times higher. In setting the MDG targets, skilled assisted birth was considered a key strategy, but also an indicator of <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>care</b> and closely reflect mortality rates. There are also marked differences within regions with a 31% lower rate in rural areas of developing countries (56 vs. 87%), yet there is no difference in East Asia but a 52% difference in Central Africa (32 vs. 84%). With the completion of the MDG campaign in 2015, new targets are being set for 2030 under the Sustainable Development Goals campaign. Maternal health is placed under Goal 3, Health, with the target being to reduce the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70. Amongst tools being developed to meet these targets is the WHO Safe Childbirth Checklist.|$|E

In general, immigrants in Canada had better <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>care</b> than those in the U.S., but most of the differences were explained by differences in socioeconomic status (income, education) and insurance coverage across the two countries.

As a result of the measures put in place by the government, enormous progress has been registered since their enforcement, in respect of <b>access</b> <b>to</b> health <b>care</b> services. However, as evident in some reports such as the 7 th Report on Economic and Social Rights by the South African Human Rights Commission and studies conducted by the Studies in Poverty and Inequality Institute (SPII), it is revealed that the measures adopted by the government <b>to</b> improve <b>access</b> <b>to</b> health <b>care</b> services have not effectively translated the entitlements of this right to the population of South Africa.

40|$|Although the {{controversy}} over the lack of consent in fetal-tissue clinical trials is relatively new, history is replete with instances of medical researchers who have conducted clinical trials with minorities and the economically disadvantaged without their consent. Traditionally, American bioethics has served as a safety net for the rich and powerful (for they are not forced to act as research subjects <b>to</b> obtain <b>access</b> <b>to</b> health <b>care</b> for themselves or their children) while failing to protect the vulnerable, which includes minorities and the economically disadvantaged. Without <b>access</b> <b>to</b> health <b>care,</b> minorities and the economically disadvantaged are unduly influenced to participate in clinical trials that promise <b>access</b> <b>to</b> health <b>care.</b> The “respect for persons” principle requires that “individuals be treated as autonomous agents” by obtaining their informed consent before they participate in clinical trials. In order for the consent to be valid, it must be free of undue influence, which includes inducements such as promises of <b>access</b> <b>to</b> health <b>care.</b> Promises of <b>access</b> <b>to</b> health <b>care</b> invalidate the voluntariness of consent because it leaves potential research subjects without choice, especially when the very institutions that are denying minorities and the economically disadvantaged <b>access</b> <b>to</b> health <b>care</b> are conducting the clinical trial. Without any meaningful choice <b>to</b> <b>access</b> health <b>care</b> other than participation in clinical trials, minorities and the economically disadvantaged are induced into consenting. In this paper, I discuss how race and class biases are central to the bioethical debate about informed consent, why these biases prevent <b>access</b> <b>to</b> health <b>care,</b> and thus, must be addressed to ensure that research subjects are not being unduly influenced into participating in clinical trials <b>to</b> attain <b>access</b> <b>to</b> health <b>care.</b> <b>To</b> measure whether consent is voluntary, federal agencies such as the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) should require researchers to use the Vulnerability and Equity Impact Assessment tool, which I have created based on the Health Equity Impact Assessment tool, to determine whether minorities and the economically disadvantaged are being unduly influenced into participating in clinical trials in violation of the “respect for persons” principle...|$|R

It could also result from lower post-infection mortality among those more affluent, due to better <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>care</b> and nursing.
