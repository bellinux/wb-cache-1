5|$|Dixon then {{travelled}} to Australia {{with his}} wife to engage in itinerant preaching there. Dixon hoped to find Jenner there, although Dixon did not yet {{know the name of}} the man he was looking for. In Adelaide, Dixon told the stories of Culver and Stanton while preaching. Murray Wilkes then approached Dixon and said that he had also become a Christian after having been asked Jenner's question on George Street. At a Methodist church in Perth, Dixon told Culver's, Stanton's, and Wilkes' stories again, and met yet another person who had become a Christian after an encounter with Jenner. Finally arriving in Sydney, Dixon asked Alec Gilchrist of Campaigners for Christ if he knew a man who asked strangers on George Street {{whether or not they were}} headed for heaven or hell. Gilchrist was familiar with Jenner and informed Dixon about how to contact Jenner. Dixon visited Jenner at his house and told him <b>about</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> people he had met who had become Christians because of Jenner's evangelism. Jenner, now fifty years old, had never before heard of even one person living their lives as Christians as a result of his evangelism, and he cried upon hearing that there were several.|$|E
5|$|Structural {{alignments}} {{can compare}} two sequences or multiple sequences. Because these alignments rely on information <b>about</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> query sequences' three-dimensional conformations, the method {{can only be}} used on sequences where these structures are known. These are usually found by X-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy. It is possible to perform a structural alignment on structures produced by structure prediction methods. Indeed, evaluating such predictions often requires a structural alignment between the model and the true known structure to assess the model's quality. Structural alignments are especially useful in analyzing data from structural genomics and proteomics efforts, {{and they can be}} used as comparison points to evaluate alignments produced by purely sequence-based bioinformatics methods.|$|E
5|$|The Girls He Left Behind Him and The Iron Clad Lover are two 1910 American silent short comedies {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. Both films were originally released together on a single reel and are two distinct and separate subjects. The Girls He Left Behind Him focuses on a young man, Jack Redfern, who receives a letter from an old sweetheart of his. This prompts him to reminiscence <b>about</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> girls he has had affections for {{on the eve of}} his wedding. All the old sweethearts of his life then appear at his wedding to wish him well. The Iron Clad Lover concerns two suitors who are vying for the affections of Bessie. Tom, who plays a game of chess with her father, ends up quarreling with him and he is thrown out of the house. The next day, Tom attempts to bring flowers and candy for Bessie's birthday, but is dismissed by the angry father. Tom decides to dress up in a suit of armor and ends up breaking a vase when trying to announce himself. The suit of armor is thrown out and Bessie and the other suitor chase down the junk dealer to free Tom from the suit of armor. Both films were released on December 9, 1910 and were met with positive reviews by The Moving Picture World and The New York Dramatic Mirror. Both films are presumed lost.|$|E

5|$|The census {{enumeration}} {{was carried}} out from 16 October to 15 November 2010 by 25,000 school leavers and 8,400 census supervisors deputed by the Census Statistical Office of Zambia. Civil servants from various government departments trained the enumerators. There were two forms: Form A, which had basic details like full name, sex, membership status, expected to be answered by senior members of each household; Form B which had details about individual members of the family. When the respondent was a minor, proxy members having knowledge about the family were questioned. The details in form B were not sufficiently captured in the forms answered by the proxy members, most of whom did not have full information <b>about</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> family members. All buildings that were complete, incomplete, abandoned, habitable or inhabitable were accounted by the enumerators. Compared to the form used during 2000 census enumeration, there were additional details on death of household members, maternal deaths, albimism, orphanhood and fosterhood in the forms used in 2010. The enumeration was completed by 15 November 2010 for majority of the regions, while all the remaining {{regions of the country}} were completed by 30 November 2010. A total of 3.2 million questionnaires were used for data collection and the Central Statistical Office started processing the forms from April 2011. OMR and ICR technologies were used for data processing.|$|E

25|$|The {{objective}} is also cultural. The movement aims {{to bring a}} new look on Syria by focusing on its cultural diversity and richness, beyond ubiquitous images of despair. According to Leila Shahid for La Marseilleise, Syria is a great cultural nation, a pluricultural leader of artistic creation. Journalist Alain Laurens commented that the Syrian cultural caravan’s involvement makes the public forget during the performance <b>about</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> bombings in Aleppo and Damascus and {{make room for a}} humane and fraternal communion. It is a way of showing that the Syrian cultural scene and its artists is alive and thriving. Finally, the road trip allows the Cultural Caravan to make art and culture come to the people, therefore going upstream of artistic and cultural centralisation. Most of the time, the exhibition is set up outside, making it accessible to a greater number.|$|E
25|$|After {{successful}} completion of the MBBS course, one has to compulsorily work in the hospital attached to the medical college {{or in any other}} approved hospital allowed in some medical colleges, for a period of one year. This posting is called the Compulsory Rotatory Residential Internship or the House Surgeon in Tamil Nadu. The student gets the degree only after satisfactory completion of the CRRI. An Intern (also called an Internee or a CRRI) is posted in all the clinical departments of the hospital on a rotation basis. This gives him or her the basic clinical and practical knowledge <b>about</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> disciplines of medicine and makes the medical graduate fit to work in the community as a General Physician. The schedules of an intern is usually extremely exhaustive. For example, one may have to work for the whole night and then have to start the next day duty only after about one or two hours. This may last till the afternoon. 24-hour sleepless duty at a stretch is not uncommon and sometimes the scheduled breaks are also not allowed by the superiors. He or she is also paid a monthly stipend for his work in the hospital which differs in different medical colleges {{on the basis of the}} management. The person is licensed to practice medicine only after completion of this internship. And only after finishing internship, one can receive his MBBS degree and can pursue postgraduate studies. The Interns are entrusted with clinical responsibilities under the supervision of a Medical teacher or a Resident/ PGT/ Senior medical officer. Interns are not supposed to issue medical certificates, death certificates or medico-legal documents under their own signatures.|$|E
