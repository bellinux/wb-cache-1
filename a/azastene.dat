5000|$|... 3β-HSD is {{potently}} inhibited by <b>azastene,</b> cyanoketone, epostane, and trilostane. Medroxyprogesterone acetate and medrogestone {{are weak}} inhibitors of 3β-HSD which may substantially inhibit it at high dosages.|$|E
50|$|<b>Azastene</b> (INN, USAN) (developmental {{code name}} WIN-17625) is a steroidogenesis {{inhibitor}} {{described as a}} contraceptive and abortifacient which was never marketed. It acts as a competitive inhibitor of 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (IC50 = 1 μM), and thereby inhibiting the formation of progesterone, corticosteroids, androgens, and estrogens.|$|E
50|$|One {{synthesis}} of this compound involves initial alkylation of methyl testosterone {{by means of}} strong base and methyl iodide to afford the 4,4-dimethyl derivative. Formylation with alkoxide and methyl formate leads to the 2-hydroxymethyl derivative. Reaction of this last with hydroxylamine leads to formation of an isoxazole ring. There is then obtained <b>azastene.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... 3β-Hydroxysteroid {{dehydrogenase}} (3β-HSD) inhibitors such as amphenone B, <b>azastene,</b> cyanoketone, epostane, mitotane, and trilostane {{inhibit the}} conversion of Δ5-3β-hydroxysteroids into Δ4-3-ketosteroids and thereby inhibit the production {{of most of the}} steroid hormones. Due to inhibition of progesterone biosynthesis, they have been investigated as contraceptives and abortifacients (though ultimately have never been marketed for this indication), and trilostane was formerly used to inhibit corticosteroid synthesis in the treatment of Cushing's syndrome.|$|E
