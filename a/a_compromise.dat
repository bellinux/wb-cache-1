5|$|The Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), the sport's {{governing}} body, refused <b>a</b> <b>compromise</b> {{proposal from}} Michelin {{to allow a}} chicane to be installed, maintaining that such rule changes would be grossly unfair to the Bridgestone-shod teams, who had come prepared with properly working tyres, and that a last-minute change to the track layout would be dangerous in case of crashes.

50|$|In such cases, {{where both}} {{arguments}} are sound or {{perceived to be}} sound, {{it is possible that}} <b>a</b> true <b>compromise</b> of sorts, as opposed to <b>a</b> false <b>compromise,</b> could be made. <b>A</b> true <b>compromise</b> can produce <b>a</b> deductively valid and sound argument which is also acceptable, utilitarian and desirable. <b>A</b> false <b>compromise</b> can produce <b>a</b> deductively invalid or unsound argument, or even if the argument is sound and valid, a pragmatically undesirable conclusion. The problem therefore with the method is it is not always obvious how to discern <b>a</b> true <b>compromise</b> from <b>a</b> false <b>compromise.</b> If the new argument is both sound and valid, one idea is that it can be considered <b>a</b> true <b>compromise</b> if it is accepted by a majority {{on both sides of the}} argument. Indeed, such heuristics are used to gauge political opinion on different policies (see Overton window).|$|R

5|$|Berryman {{was also}} {{involved}} in the plan's execution, once more becoming chief of staff at New Guinea Force under Blamey in August 1943. Berryman was frustrated at the failure of Vasey's 7th Division to destroy the Japanese retreating from Lae, and personally annoyed by the way that Vasey forwarded compliments to Major General Ennis Whitehead while leaving any complaints about air support to be taken up by Berryman. Berryman was next involved with the planning for the landing at Finschhafen, brokering <b>a</b> <b>compromise</b> landing plan between Rear Admiral Daniel E. Barbey and Lieutenant General Sir Edmund Herring. When Berryman discovered that the United States Seventh Fleet {{did not intend to}} reinforce the 9th Division he immediately went to Blamey, who took the matter up with MacArthur. However, it was Berryman who brokered <b>a</b> <b>compromise</b> deal with Vice Admiral Arthur S. Carpender to reinforce Finschhafen with a battalion in APDs.|$|E
