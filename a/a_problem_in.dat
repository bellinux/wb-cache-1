5|$|A delayed or {{deployable}} surface {{marker buoy}} (DSMB) is a soft inflatable tube which {{is attached to}} a reel or spool line at one end, and is inflated by the diver under water and released to float to the surface, deploying the line as it ascends. This provides information to the surface that the diver is about to ascend, and where he is. This equipment is commonly used by recreational and technical divers, and requires a certain level of skill to operate safely. Once deployed, it can be used for the same purposes as the standard surface marker and reel, and in the same way, but they are mostly used to signal the boat that the diver has started ascent or to indicate <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>in</b> technical diving.|$|E

5|$|According to the Miami Herald the {{financing}} {{structure of the}} plan is notable {{for the amount of}} financial risk taken by the builders in return for the long term concession on the tunnel. Opposition to the project states that it is a waste of taxpayer money, and may become Miami's Big Dig, the nickname of a tunnel megaproject in Boston, which was a $4 billion project that ended up costing $22 billion in cost overruns. Many believe that the Port of Miami Tunnel Project will be likely to have similar cost overruns, even though the Secretary of the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) promised that the project would finish on time and without overruns. They also state that truck traffic is not <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>in</b> Downtown, and that since 1991 car and truck traffic had reduced significantly.|$|E

5|$|Bacteriophages are {{viruses that}} infect {{bacteria}} and archaea. The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses officially recognises 28 genera of bacteriophages {{that belong to}} 11 families. They are important in marine ecology: as the infected bacteria burst, carbon compounds are released back into the environment, which stimulates fresh organic growth. Bacteriophages are useful in scientific research because they are harmless to humans and can be studied easily. These viruses can be <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>in</b> industries that produce food and drugs by fermentation and depend on healthy bacteria. Some bacterial infections are becoming difficult to control with antibiotics, {{so there is a}} growing interest in the use of bacteriophages to treat infections in humans.|$|E

5|$|Carlisle is an {{ambassador}} for the Kick It Out scheme, which campaigns for inclusion and equality in football.

As part of his work with the PFA, he collects the views of his fellow professionals and reports back to the committee. He also visits local schools to give talks to the students. Carlisle was among those who criticised FIFA president Sepp Blatter following his comments in November 2011 that racism was no longer <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>in</b> football. In February 2012, he was part of a PFA delegation that met with British Prime Minister David Cameron to discuss the issues of racism and homophobia in the sport.|$|E
