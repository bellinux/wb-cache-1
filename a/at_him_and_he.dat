25|$|When Napoleon's Grand Army finally {{occupies}} {{an abandoned}} and burning Moscow, Pierre takes {{off on a}} quixotic mission to assassinate Napoleon.

Natasha recognizes and smiles <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> in turn realizes the full scope of his love for her.|$|E
25|$|The {{son of the}} rector of Dallinghoo, Walford {{was educated}} at Harrow School and at Trinity College, Cambridge. As a cricketer, he was a middle- or lower-order batsman, {{though it is not}} known whether he batted right- or left-handed. His two {{first-class}} matches came within a fortnight of each other in May 1860. In the first, scores of 7 and 25 for the Cambridge University team against the Cambridge Town Club were enough for the university team to want to take a second look <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> was duly picked for the MCC team to play against the university, a frequent ploy in university cricket at the time, but then failed to score in his only innings. Although he played in minor matches for the Cambridge team across the rest of the 1860 season, he was not picked for the University Match against Oxford University and played no further first-class games.|$|E

25|$|Phillips {{was arrested}} {{that day at}} his school. He was held in maximum {{security}} {{as he made his}} first court appearance. It was determined that Clifton's cause of death was due to stabbing and clubbing with a baseball bat. Phillips claimed the event happened one afternoon when he was home alone, Maddie came to his house asking him to come outside and play baseball, Phillips agreed even though he was not allowed to have friends over while his parents were not home. As the two were playing baseball, Maddie threw the ball <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> hit it, which caused the ball to strike the 8-year-old's eye, causing her to bleed, leading Clifton to cry and scream. Phillips panicked, fearing the reaction that his father would give when he got home and saw the aftermath. Phillips proceeded to drag Clifton into his home and then into his room and strangle her with a phone cord for approximately 15 minutes. Soon after, he hit her again with the baseball bat and stashed her under his bed, not long after Josh's father entered the house, Phillips went to interact with his father for a short moment and then went back to his room and found that Clifton was still alive moaning under his bed, he took off the mattress and stabbed her 11 times, killing the 8-year-old.|$|E
25|$|In particular, I {{shall never}} forget the Barbarians game at Cardiff Arms Park to end our Grand Slam tour of 1984. We weren't in such good shape – our {{discipline}} had surrendered to celebration after beating Scotland and we knew {{this was to be}} Europe's game of retribution against us. We seemed to be constantly counter-attacking to get out of trouble and then Campese struck. He made a break from within his own half, the defence came <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> stepped left and right with remarkable speed. And in the twinkling of an eye, the try line was his. But he had one defender to beat, the Welsh centre Robert Ackerman. Ackerman, unfortunately, had criticised the Australian victory after our crushing victory in the Test against Wales and Campo didn't have the words to retaliate then. But he retaliated now, with his feet and hands. He turned Ackerman inside out, threatening to go past, then changing direction, offering himself to be tackled then accelerating away until the crowd erupted, first in disbelief, then in sheer amusement and joy at what they were seeing. One yard from the line, Campo passed to Michael Hawker, and I'm sure, to this day, the pass was forward, but the referee knew he had seen artistry of incomparable dimension at work and the only reward he could offer was a try, which he duly did. It's an image I'll always associate with Campese. It remains for me the metaphor of his career.|$|E
500|$|Meyers {{claims the}} story is not autobiographical though it is an early example of Hemingway's ability to tell stories [...] "true to life." [...] In the story, Nick Adams' father, who is portrayed as [...] "professionally cool", is based on Hemingway's own father, Clarence Hemingway. Hemingway's {{paternal}} uncle, George, appears in the story, and is treated unsympathetically. Hannum suggests George {{may have been the}} child's father, writing that in the story remains the [...] "never-resolved implication of the paternity of the Indian child". During the surgery the mother bites Uncle George, the Indians laugh <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> leaves when the father is found dead.|$|E

500|$|White {{pleaded guilty}} to theft and disorderly conduct; in the October 13, 2009 {{incident}} at the Mall of America, he was initially accused of taking $100 worth of clothes and of fifth-degree assault when he allegedly pushed a mall security officer to the ground twice, but he claimed the security officer was charging <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> was defending himself. He was suspended for the 2009–10 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. [...] The suspension was for competition and travel, but {{at the discretion of}} head coach Tubby Smith, White could attend practices. According to his grandfather, he attended some Gopher practices in December.|$|E
500|$|In the 2016 MLS Cup Final against Seattle, held at BMO Field on 10 December, Giovinco's {{performance}} was largely stifled by Seattle's heavy and aggressive defending, despite initially creating an early goalscoring chance for Altidore; throughout the match, he was fouled {{a total of}} six times and had several shots blocked. A scoring opportunity came in the 48th minute, but his shot was skewed wide of the near post. He was eventually substituted for Tosaint Ricketts in the 103rd minute, due to an apparent injury, and consequently, despite being the club's main penalty kick taker, was not used in the resulting shoot-out, which Toronto lost 5–4, following a 0–0 draw after extra-time. Regarding Giovinco's surprising substitution, Toronto's coach, Greg Vanney, stated in the post-match press conference: [...] "He couldn't move. He looked at me. It's not like I take him off because I want to. I look <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> gives me the sign that he can’t go any more and when he feels like he can’t go, he feels like he’s more of a liability to the group than anything. That’s the decision. It's not one that I generally want to make, but we had to." ...|$|E

[...] His request was granted by General Greene who named General Huger, Colonel Harrison of the artillery and Lieutenant Colonel Washington of the cavalry to conduct the review.|$|E

2500|$|One {{police report}} {{described}} that McDonald [...] "raised the knife across chest" [...] and pointed it at Van Dyke. Van Dyke {{told investigators that}} he feared McDonald would rush him with the knife or throw it <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> also recalled a 2012 Police Department bulletin warning about a knife that was also capable of firing a bullet, as well as throwing knives and also spring-loaded knives capable of propelling the blade. One report noted that McDonald's knife [...] "was in the open position" [...] but, when announcing charges against Van Dyke, Cook County State's Attorney Anita Alvarez said the knife was found folded at the scene.|$|E
2500|$|The {{crossing}} gate struck {{the top of}} Brody's SUV before sliding down its rear and becoming stuck. Hope backed up to give her room to do the same. He instead saw Brody get out and walk to the rear, apparently trying to free it. [...] "What struck me was how calm she was—she didn't seem to be panicking, or in a hurry at all, even though the gate was down," [...] he said later. [...] "She wasn't in a hurry at all, {{but she had to}} have known that a train was coming." [...] Brody looked <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> motioned to her to come back in his direction, although he allows that she may not have seen him due to the glare from his headlights. Brody then returned to her vehicle and, according to Hope, seemed to pause as if she was adjusting her seat belt. The train was getting closer and the situation more urgent. [...] "The thing's dinging, red lights are flashing, it's going off," [...] he said. [...] "I just knew she was going to back up—never in my wildest dreams did I think she'd go forward." ...|$|E
2500|$|On January 26, 2011 (Australia Day), Buffett was {{performing}} {{a concert in}} Australia at Sydney's Hordern Pavilion and fell off the stage after an encore. A concert-goer said, [...] "He just {{went over to the}} edge of the stage, like he had numerous times through the night, just to wave, and people were throwing stuffed toys and things <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> <b>And</b> <b>he</b> just took one step too many and just disappeared in a flash. He didn't have time to put his arms out to save himself or anything, he just dropped." [...] Coincidentally, one of Australia's leading trauma surgeons was at the concert and close to the stage; Dr. Gordian Fulde treated Buffett at the scene. Fulde said, [...] "I thought he'd broken his neck.... I heard the clunk of his head on a metal ledge, he has a deep gash on his scalp, which is all right now.... But at first I thought: this guy is going to be a spinal injury." [...] Dr Fulde turned him on his side so he could breathe and administered first aid. Buffett regained consciousness within a few minutes. He was then transported to St Vincent's Hospital Emergency centre for treatment and was released the next day. Buffett returned to Australia in 2012 for two shows in Brisbane and Melbourne, and made much fun of the incident during those shows. In the Melbourne show in the historic Palais Theatre in the Melbourne beachside suburb of St. Kilda he presented additional verses of [...] "Margaritaville" [...] in which he made humorous references to the accident, much to the audience's delight.|$|E

2500|$|In [...] "Me²" [...] (1988), Rimmer {{is shown}} {{moving in with}} his double as better company in the next bunkroom over from Lister. Rimmer's double reveals that all of Rimmer's brothers, but not Rimmer, were academy educated. Rimmer claims that this was because his father couldn't afford it. Rimmer also {{mentions}} taking a film course at night school, although he confuses a cartoon showing at the cinema in the episode with Citizen Kane. Lister watches a video of Rimmer's death, where his last words are [...] "gazpacho soup". Demonstrating intense, literal self-hatred, the second cruelly insults and berates the first. Believing that Lister is going to wipe his hologram anyway because of the two Rimmers' constant arguing, Rimmer explained his dying remark as referring to [...] a dinner at the captain's table with six officers, during he made a faux pas where he had his gazpacho soup taken away to be brought back hot, not realising that gazpacho soup {{is meant to be}} served cold. This caused the officers at the table to laugh <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> was never invited back. The incident haunted Rimmer {{for the rest of his}} life (and beyond). Gradually, his obsession over the incident caused him to remember it as the most disastrous, imbecilic action of his life, and it undermined his self-esteem out of all proportion. Lister, displaying deep empathy, tried to comfort Rimmer, assuring him that [...] "anybody could make a mistake like that." [...] His confession complete, Rimmer prepares to be wiped, but Lister wipes the second Rimmer instead; Lister had allowed Rimmer to believe his [...] "death" [...] was imminent because Lister wanted to know what the [...] "gazpacho soup" [...] remark meant, and he knew that Rimmer would never tell him any other circumstances.|$|E
