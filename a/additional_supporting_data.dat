40|$|AbstractChange in {{transcription}} start site (TSS) usage is {{an important}} mechanism for the control of transcription process, and has {{a significant effect on}} the isoforms being transcribed. One of the goals in the study of TSS is the understanding of how and why their usage differs in different tissues or under different conditions. In light of recent efforts in the mapping of transcription start site landscape using high-throughput sequencing approaches, a quantitative and automated method is needed to process all the data that are being produced. In this work we propose a statistical approach that will classify changes in TSS distribution between different samples into several categories of changes that may have biological significance. Genes selected by the classifiers can then be analyzed together with <b>additional</b> <b>supporting</b> <b>data</b> to determine their biological significance.

In conclusion, The Dewine–Kennedy Bill, at best, was mixed in terms of the enhancement of the public health. On the one hand, proponents of this legislation argued stronger FDA regulatory requirements would have some effect on reducing youth and adult tobacco consumption.

40|$|During {{the last}} two decades the problem of space debris and safe access to Low Earth Orbit {{has been one of the}} most {{controversial}} and discussed issue in the space community. Along with mitigation actions (e. g. the 25 -year Post Mission Disposal rule currently adopted by most agencies), analyses of the current situation and future projections have shown the necessity of active debris removal (ADR) operations aimed to a direct intervention in relatively short time as a remediation action. Apart from the problem of considering the potential political and legal consequences of dealing with spent space objects, many methods have been proposed for the despinning and grabbing phases of ADR missions, but in spite of the variety in the ideas and concepts on the ground, not all of them are ready to be sent to space. Starting from an overview on the different approaches proposed for in-orbit grabbing of uncooperative targets, this work analyses the current status of the solutions designed so far, both in terms of technical readiness and methodological maturity, and identifies the characteristics that can be used as a metric for the quality and feasibility of those systems.

We successfully used a simple inverted compound microscope and a commercially available program to study and quantify in vivo changes in sonic hedgehog (shh expression during early development in a green fluorescence protein (GFP) transgenic zebrafish (Danio rerio) line. We applied the 4 D system to study the effect of 100 μM cadmium exposure on shh expression. In control zebrafish embryos, shh:GFP expression was detected at about 9 h post-fertilization (hpf) and increased steadily in the next 7 h, peaking at about 17 hpf and decreasing in the following 4 h. In the same time period, different shh expression volumes were observed in cadmium-treated and control embryos. Embryos affected by cadmium-exposure demonstrated a down-regulation in shh expression. The number of GFP-expressing cells measured by flow cytometry decreased, and expression of neurogenin- 1, a downstream target of the shh signaling pathway, was down-regulated, providing <b>additional</b> <b>supporting</b> <b>data</b> on the effects of cadmium on shh.

40|$|Thesis (D. M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityThe Wisconsin Choral Directors Association (WCDA) has a {{long history}} leading the {{professional}} development and performance standards for choral conductors and music teachers since its formation in 1961. During a period from 1985 - 1999, WCDA realized an unprecedented 98 % growth in membership and expansion of program offerings, revenue, and managerial initiatives resulting in organizational stability into the twenty-first century. The purpose of this research was to: (1) chronicle the historical initiatives of WCDA during the period 1985 - 1999, (2) document the leadership decisions that created this era of unprecedented expansion, (3) describe how organizational reform transformed WCDA into a major professional advocacy organization prepared for the challenges of the twenty-first century, (4) consider whether this era of dynamic growth can be a model for WCDA itself or other similar organizations in the future. As there are few archival records documenting the history of WCDA, interviews were conducted with decision makers of the late twentieth century. Content analysis of available newsletters, programs, annual reports, and journal articles were cross-referenced with interviews to establish accuracy of the data. <b>Additional</b> <b>supporting</b> <b>data</b> from the American Choral Directors Association (ACDA) International Archives for Choral Music helped establish a time-line of the organization. Research provided data for a chronological narrative of WCDA from 1961 - 2013 with a particular focus on the period 1985 - 1999. This study concluded that WCDA, benefited from a peaceful and financially strong period in American history. Through the leadership of its presidents and decision makers, WCDA engaged the challenging issues of the day and pursued a successful course of reorganization. Organizational restructuring, retooling of communication instruments, recruiting initiatives, and visionary thinking, all contributed to the emergence of WCDA as a lead organization in the professional advocacy for its members and the choral art in general. Through its ingenuity and resourcefulness, WCDA positioned itself as a fiscally stable corporation {{by the end of the}} twentieth century. By 1998 the Association plateaued as membership stagnated and began a decline. A Sigmoid Curve was used to describe WCDA through each era.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{efficiently}} and effectively assess {{the risks of}} large numbers of existing chemicals and new chemical entities, there is an increasing emphasis in the regulatory setting on the use of so-called ¿non-testing¿ methods, either as a supplement to, or as a substitute for, traditional testing methods. In particular, alternatives to animal methods are being developed to reduce the need for animal testing in pharmacology and toxicology. Non-testing methods are {{based on the premise that}} the properties (including physicochemical properties and biological activities) of a chemical depend on its intrinsic nature and can be directly predicted from its molecular structure or inferred from the properties of similar compounds whose activities are known. Non-testing methods include a range of predictive approaches, including Structure-Activity Relationships (SARs), Quantitative Structure Activity Relationships (QSARs), chemical grouping and read-across, and computer-based tools based on the use of one or more of these approaches. The main question for the assessor when applying non-testing methods for regulatory purposes concerns the usefulness of the approach, which can be broken down into the practical applicability of the method and the adequacy of the predictions. Considerable progress has been made at the EU and international levels to develop a harmonised framework for assessing and documenting non-testing methods and their predictions. Exactly how this framework is applied in practice will depend on the provisions of the specific legislation (e. g. chemicals, pesticides, biocides, cosmetics) and the context in which the non-testing data are being used (including, for example, whether a traditional testing method is being replaced, whether <b>additional,</b> <b>supporting</b> <b>data</b> are available, and the consequences of making an inaccurate prediction). The general framework leaves largely open the difficult question of how to determine the adequacy of predicted data, and there is a considerable need to develop detailed guidance on how the predictions generated by non-testing methods can be translated into regulatory decisions. This chapter introduces the conceptual basis of SARs and QSARs, collectively referred to as (Q) SARs, as well as the related approach of chemical grouping (category formation) and read-across within chemical groups (categories). The current international framework for (Q) SAR models and predictions is then described (a similar framework has been developed for category and read-across approaches). The practical applicability of this framework. is illustrated by focussing on a checklist of 10 key questions, with respect to some well known software tools and their predictions of genotoxicity of two case study compounds. The purpose of these case studies is to highlight some of the scientific issues that need to be considered, as well the difficulties encountered.

Background According to economic theory well-being or utility depends on consumption and possibly other inputs such as leisure. However, at the household level total consumption is rarely observed because its collection requires a great deal of survey time. 1 As a result income has been widely used to assess well-being and poverty rates. Because households can use wealth to consume more than income or save to consume less than income, an income-based measure of well-being could yield misleading results for many households. As argued in a number of studies consumption is therefore a better measure than income for assessing material well-being and poverty status (Cutler and Katz, 1991; Jorgenso...|$|R
