5|$|Karas is {{the title}} for the city's {{appointed}} agents. Capable of transforming into automobiles and aircraft, they are suits of armor animated by human souls infused into them through Yurine's chanting of a Shinto prayer. Director Sato told his animators to enhance the Karas dark nature by drawing their faces in shadows. Fight scenes involving Karas take place mostly in dark settings shrouded with steam or lit with spotlights. Animators touched up film frames by hand, creating an effect different from cel-shaded animation. To make the Karas more menacing, they highlighted the eyes as if light bulbs were shining through them, a technique inspired by the suitmation practice of using light bulbs for the eyes of costumes. Producer Takaya Ibira explained the presence of ravens in Tokyo and the Tower of London, inspired him and Sato to model the agents of the city after them. He stated ravens {{are believed to be}} omens of good and bad in superstitions, and they <b>always</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> watching over the cities. This resonated with his view of the raven in the story Noah's Ark, which cursed Noah as it scouted for land. The presence of ravens all over Tokyo led Ibira to notice the same of cats and conceive the Yurines as catgirls.|$|E
25|$|Consequently, intense {{feelings}} of anger may frequently surface, sometimes in inappropriate or unexpected situations, as danger may <b>always</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> present, {{as much as}} it is actually present and experienced from past events. Upsetting memories such as images, thoughts, or flashbacks may haunt the person, and nightmares may be frequent. Insomnia may occur as lurking fears and insecurity keep the person vigilant and on the lookout for danger, both day and night. Trauma doesn't only cause changes in one's daily functions but could also lead to morphological changes. Such epigenetic changes can be passed on to the next generations, thus making genetics as one of the components of the causes of psychological trauma. However, some people are born with or later develop protective factors such as genetics and sex that help lower their risk of psychological trauma.|$|E
500|$|... "I {{was stunned}} by their performance" [...] was Sinden's assessment. Former Montreal Canadiens' coach Claude Ruel commented that the Soviets' {{forwards}} {{were one of the}} most finely honed units he had ever seen. [...] "They are always moving, never standing around, they head-man the puck as well as anyone has ever done — and they <b>always</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in the right place." [...] According to Canada's goaltender Ken Dryden: [...] "We didn't play our game at all. After they tied it up, we started playing a panic type of game. Sometimes there were five men going for the puck at once." [...] At the end of the game, Team Canada accidentally snubbed the Soviets by returning to the dressing room directly without shaking hands with the Soviets after the game.|$|E

500|$|Stewart, {{who earned}} $270,136 for the victory, {{appeared}} in victory lane {{to celebrate his}} first win of the season, and his first at Talladega Superspeedway, {{in front of a}} crowd of 145,000. He was delighted to take the victory: [...] "It's one thing to get back to Victory Lane, but to do it at Talladega wow." [...] "I've wanted to win here for so long. This hasn't been one of my favorite places on the fan side. People haven't always liked me here. But this was for those guys up in the stands today." [...] Second-place finisher Menard was pleased with his result, saying he had a good car throughout the duration of the race: [...] "Car had speed in it all day. Didn't make any chassis adjustments, just did a little bit of air pressure after the first run to free it up. It was just all track position really." [...] In the post-race press conference, third-place finisher Ragan said that he felt that he had a car which could have secured the victory under the right circumstances, but believed it was a good day for his team: [...] "We <b>always</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> pretty fast here on the superspeedway track, so that just goes to show you how much effort our Roush Fenway team is putting into this program." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, as the Byzantinist Rodolphe Guilland commented, {{references}} to a stratopedarchēs are rare before the 10th century, and <b>always</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{a different way}} of referring—often anachronistically—to a magister militum, or later a thematic stratēgos. Such references exist to emperor Jovian (r. 363–364), who was a general before his rise to the throne, by Theophanes the Confessor; Rusticius, a general of Leo I (r. 457–474), by Zonaras; Busur, an Arab commander in c. 650, by Theophanes; Krateros, a [...] "stratopedarchēs of the East" [...] who was sent to arrest Theodore Stoudites; Eudokimos, stratopedarchēs/stratēgos of Cappadocia and Charsianon under Theophilos (r. 829–842); and a certain Mousilikes, subordinate of the thematic stratēgos of Sicily. A prōtospatharios Constantine, whose seal mentions him as a stratopedarchēs, can not be further identified.|$|E
2500|$|Retrospective {{reviews from}} critics {{have been more}} negative. In May 2014, WatchMojo placed the episode at number one on their list of the most disappointing TV show finales, calling it [...] "sloppy" [...] and [...] "perturbingly messy" [...] with [...] "so many {{unanswered}} questions". Six months later, Chris E. Hayner of Zap2It similarly named [...] "The End" [...] as the number one worst series finale, calling it [...] "the king of disappointing series finales". Indiewire also branded the finale as the number one worst ever, criticizing it for being [...] "unbelievably long" [...] and having a [...] "decided lack of dramatic tension and any real thrills". Discussing the final season as a whole, Indiewire described season six as [...] "directionless" [...] and [...] "largely a 'miss. Writing for MTV in 2015, Josh Wigler called the episode [...] "the finale that sucks", and {{said that it would}} live on [...] "as the model for how NOT to finish your show". Daniel D'Addario, writing for Salon.com, listed [...] "The End" [...] as one of the [...] "worst finales ever", describing the series as [...] "a show whose twists and turns didn't <b>always</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> undertaken by people who knew what they were doing." ...|$|E
