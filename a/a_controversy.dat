However, molecular and morphological analysis supports the inclusion of Pantholops in Caprinae.|$|E
5000|$|Common {{claims for}} declaratory {{judgment}} in patent cases are non-infringement, patent invalidity, and unenforceability. To bring {{a claim for}} declaratory judgment {{in a situation where}} a patent dispute may exist or develop, the claimant must establish that <b>an</b> actual <b>controversy</b> exists. [...] If there is <b>a</b> substantial <b>controversy</b> of sufficient immediacy and reality, the court will generally proceed with the declaratory-judgment action. The court may even hear the action if the patentee has not filed a cease and desist letter. [...] The standard for <b>an</b> actual <b>controversy</b> was most recently addressed by the Supreme Court in MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc., 549 U.S. 118 (2007). But even if <b>an</b> actual <b>controversy</b> exists, the declaratory-judgment statute is permissive—a district court, in its discretion, may decline to hear a declaratory-judgment action.|$|R
