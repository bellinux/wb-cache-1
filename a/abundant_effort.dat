40|$|In the 90 's the taxanes {{paclitaxel}} and docetaxel, both {{belonging to}} the so-called naturally occurring drugs, because of their origin from the yew trees Taxus brevifolia and Taxus baccata, respectively, were registered for clinical use {{in the treatment of}} cancer patients. Although their mechanism of action is the same, inducing cell death by promoting polymerization of tubulin into microtubules and particularly by inhibiting depolymerization of these microtubules, they are not simply two of a kind. Differences in activity, toxicity and pharmacokinetic behavior have been described over the last decade. In order to increase activity they have been combined with various other (anticancer) agents. To judge combination treatment on its merits, changes in the pharmaco-dynamics as well as modulations in the pharmacokinetics of the combined drugs have to be evaluated. This thesis explores the influence of other chemical entities on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel and paclitaxel. Intended modulation of docetaxel by co-administration of a multidrug-resistance convertor is the topic of {{the first part of the}} thesis, the unintended and underestimated pharmacokinetic implications of the choice of Cremophor EL as the formulation vehicle of paclitaxel is the subject of the second part. Multidrug resistance is the phenomenon thought to be partly responsible for failure of cancer treatment with naturally occurring anticancer drugs such as taxanes. It is associated with overexpression of the transmembrane transport protein P-glycoprotein, which acts as an ATP-dependent drug efflux pump, yielding to a decrease in the intracellular concentrations of the substrate drugs. <b>Abundant</b> <b>effort</b> has been put into the development of agents that are able to inhibit P-glycoprotein, and when used in combination with anticancer drugs increase the intracellular exposure to these drugs. However, many clinical studies involving a wide range of P-glycoprotein inhibitors and coadministered anticancer drugs have shown that these combination treatments almost always resulted in increased toxicity of the anticancer drugs particularly because of pharmacokinetic interaction between the two agents due to competition at the level of cytochrome-P 450 3 A isozymes, the major metabolic pathway of many drugs including docetaxel. Recently, a new 'second generation' P-glycoprotein inhibitor, R 101933, has been developed which known major metabolic route is cytochrome-P 450 unrelated. Since docetaxel is known to be a more pure substrate of P-glycoprotein than paclitaxel, it was obvious that co-treatment of docetaxel with R 1 01933 could have great clinical importance. Therefore, we performed several pharmacokinetic and phase I studies with docetaxel combined with R 101933, orally as well as intravenously. In order to determine the physiological and pharmacological consequences of inhibition of P-glycoprotein activity with respect to the disposition of docetaxel we monitored both plasma and fecal drug levels of docetaxel. Modulation of P-glycoprotein, particularly in the hepatobiliary tract, by Cremophor EL, the formulation vehicle of paclitaxel, was postulated as one of the explanations of the distinctly nonlinear pharmacokinetic behavior of this taxane. The operation of Michaelis-Menten kinetics, saturable distribution in combination with saturable elimination, was hypothesized as another cause of the nonlinear disposition of paclitaxel. However, studies in mice demonstrated that in the absence of Cremophor EL the pharmacokinetic behavior of paclitaxel was linear. An explanation could be that, by its nature, Cremophor EL in blood is capable of forming micelles with a highly hydrophobic interior that can entrap the solubilised compound, consequently influencing the pharmacokinetic behavior of this drug. So we postulated that the nonlinear disposition of paclitaxel is caused by dose and time-related variations in Cremophor EL concentrations in the central compartment. To prove this hypothesis we performed a comprehensive pharmacokinetic analysis of paclitaxel and Cremophor EL in vitro and in patients, measuring paired whole blood and plasma levels of paclitaxel. Based on the results of these studies, we were able to develop and describe explicit modeling of the disposition of paclitaxel and free paclitaxel to permit a formal explanation of the observed phenomenon...|$|E
40|$|Denoising {{is one of}} {{the most}} common and {{important}} task in video processing systems and <b>abundant</b> <b>efforts</b> have been made on video denoising nowadays. Multihypothesis motion compensated filter (MHMCF) is an effective video denoising method, which combines multiple hypotheses obtained from motion estimation through a number of reference frames by weighted average to suppress noise. However, MHMCF only considers denoising of grayscale video signal. In this paper, we apply MHMCF to color video denoising, where the RGB video is first transformed to the luminance-color difference space before denoising. Instead of using traditional YCbCr color conversion, we propose a novel color conversion matrix which is adaptive to the noise variance in R, G, B channels. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed color space conversion method can successfully improve the denoising performance for color video. © 2010 IEEE...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Building {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{widespread}} human activities, as it involves a far greater number of people and professional profiles than all other industries and absorbs about half of world energy consumption. Its multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary nature makes the design-construction process, as well as the building product, increasingly complex. It is thus always more difficult, with usual design methods and efficiently to obtain correctly designed solutions and to favour creativity, while respecting assigned time schedules and budgets. These are very well known problems, on which <b>abundant</b> <b>efforts</b> and resources have been spent in pursuit of an efficient solution. One generally agreed solution is efficient collaboration among the design actors, although all the forms and tools proposed hitherto do not allow all the difficulties embedded in the problem itself to be overcome. The great potentialities of the new media are considered to be crucial for the resolution of the previously mentioned problem, although, until now, this approach has raised new problems than it has solved the old ones...|$|R
40|$|Denoising {{is one of}} {{the most}} common and {{important}} tasks in video processing systems and <b>abundant</b> <b>efforts</b> have been made on video denoising nowadays. In this paper, we propose a novel denoising scheme based on minimum mean square error (MMSE) filter in the 2 D transform domain, which we call 2 DTD-MMSE. The current input noisy frame is processed block-by-block, and for every block, the current noisy observation and multiple prediction blocks found by motion estimation (ME) in denoised previous frames as well as noisy future frames constitute a 2 D observed representation array. Afterwards, 2 D transform is applied to every block in the representation array, and every transform coefficient of current block is estimated by weighted average of the coefficients in the same frequency position of all the transformed blocks. The weighting coefficients are adaptively determined through MMSE for every block after the estimation of statistical parameters in the transform domain. Experimental results on commonly used test sequences demonstrate that the proposed 2 DTD-MMSE achieves comparable or favorable performance when compared to several state-of-the-art algorithms...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{popularity of}} biometrics and cryptography {{is driven by}} the widespread stipulation on information security. <b>Abundant</b> <b>efforts</b> have been made in developing successful methods in these areas in order to accomplish an enhanced level of information security. There are two dominant issues in information security enhancement. One is to defend the user ownership and control the access to information by authenticating an individual’s identity. The other is to make sure the privacy and integrity of information and to secure communication. Cryptography is the science of writing in secret code. Secret-key cryptography and public-key cryptography are the two most important cryptographic architectures. The security of a cryptographic system is reliant on the secrecy of the cryptographic key. Biometric authentication or simply biometrics refers to establishing automatic personal recognition based on the physical and behavioral characteristics of an individual (e. g. face, voice, fingerprint, gait, hand geometry, iris, gene, etc.). Biometrics offers superior security and easier than traditional identity authentication systems (based on passwords and cryptographic keys). Since biometrics characteristics are naturally related with a particular individual, making them insusceptible to being stolen, forgotten, lost or attached. This paper presents a survey on various techniques proposed earlier in developing an authentication system for ensuring individual’s information security by combining biometric characteristics of that particular individual and the cryptographic techniques. In addition, it provides some fundamental idea for future research that may help in eliminating the problems associated with the present authentication systems...|$|R

30|$|Several well-studied {{models have}} been {{established}} for personality traits, among which the Big Five model is the most popular [35, 36]. In this model, human personality is depicted on five dimensions, namely, openness, neuroticism, extraversion, agreeableness and conscientiousness, and personality type is determined based on an individual’s behavior over time and under different circumstances. The Internet, currently {{one of the most}} pervasive scenarios, has profoundly changed human behavior and experience. With its explosive development, <b>abundant</b> research <b>efforts</b> have been devoted to investigating the relation between personality and Internet usage [37]. For example, research findings have demonstrated distinctive patterns of Internet use and usage motives of individuals with different personality types, where extroverts made more goal-oriented use of Internet services [38]. Focusing on online social media as a vital component of the Internet, extraversion and openness to experiences are found to be positively related with social media adoption [39] and introverted and neurotic people locate their “real me” through social interaction [40].|$|R
40|$|High-grade gliomas {{account for}} the {{majority}} of intra-axial brain tumors. Despite <b>abundant</b> therapeutic <b>efforts,</b> clinical outcome is still poor. Thus, new therapeutic approaches are intensely being investigated. Overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (HER 1 /EGFR) is found in various epithelial tumors and represents {{one of the most common}} molecular abnormalities seen in high-grade gliomas. Dysregulated HER 1 /EGFR is found in 40 % to 50 % of glioblastoma, the most malignant subtype of glioma. Several agents such as tyrosine kinase (TK) inhibitors, antibodies, radio-immuno conjugates, ligand-toxin conjugates, or RNA-based agents have been developed to target HER 1 /EGFR or its mutant form, EGFRvIII. To date, most agents are in various stages of clinical development. Clinical data are sparse but most advanced for TK inhibitors. Although data from experimental studies seem promising, proof of a significant clinical benefit is still missing. Among the problems that have to be further addressed is the prediction of the individual patient's response to HER 1 /EGFR-targeted therapeutics based on molecular determinants. It is quite possible that blocking HER 1 /EGFR alone will not sufficiently translate into a clinical benefit. Therefore, a multiple target approach concomitantly aimed at different molecular sites might be a favorable concept. This review focuses on current HER 1 /EGFR-targeted therapeutics and their development for high-grade gliomas. (Mol Cancer Res 2009; 7 (7) : 1000 – 12...|$|R
40|$|Non-indigenous (NIS) have {{negatively}} impacted ecosystems worldwide. When {{a species}} is introduced, its population will generally be small. This {{is the best}} time to eradicate NIS, however, detection at this stage is difficult. I hypothesize that rare species will be more easily found as they become <b>abundant,</b> when sampling <b>effort</b> is increased, and morphologically distinct species are more likely to be detected. I spiked different densities of NIS into zooplankton samples from Hamilton Harbour to simulate rarity and assess detection rate with both microscopy and FlowCAM. My results indicate a positive relationship between detection and abundance, counting effort, and distinctiveness. FlowCAM can process more data, but morphologically similar taxa will be distinguished more readily with microscopy. This study provides tools to monitor rare aquatic species as well as a means to combat NIS at the frontiers of invasion and provides a way to further test hypotheses of establishment and invasion...|$|R

However, to interact with humans or to be incorporated into a human “collective ” robots have to be provided with some human-like cognitive abilities. What does it mean? – Nobody knows. But, robotics research communities are trying hard to find out a way to cope with this problem. Meanwhile, despite <b>abundant</b> funding these <b>efforts</b> did not lead to any meaningful result (only in Europe, only in the past ten years, Cognitive Robotics research funding has reached a ceiling of 1. 39 billion euros).

There is no reason to expect that this time the result will be different. We would like to try to explain why we are so unhappy about this...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSub-Saharan Africa is {{typically}} regarded as land <b>abundant,</b> and previous <b>efforts</b> {{to estimate the}} true extent of potentially available cropland (PAC) have largely affirmed this perception. Such efforts, however, have largely focused on production potential and have underemphasized economic profitability and other constraints to expansion. This paper re-estimates PAC for Africa in a more explicit economic framework that emphasizes the returns to agricultural production {{under a variety of}} assumptions, using recent geospatial data. Existing PAC estimates for Africa are shown to be highly sensitive to assumptions about land productivity and market access, and are moderately influenced by the use of alternative data sources. The region’s underutilized land resources are concentrated in relatively few countries, many of which are fragile states. Between one-half and two-thirds of the region’s surplus land is currently under forest cover; conversion of forests to cropland would entail major environmental costs. Most of the continent’s unexploited land resources are located far from input and output markets, limiting their economic attractiveness. In the long run, improvements in infrastructure and agricultural productivity and the growth of hinterland towns will enhance the economic returns to cropland expansion. In the short to medium term, however, the potential for profitable smallholder-based cropland expansion in most African countries is likely to be much more limited than it {{is typically}} perceived to be...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} climate change and fishing {{pressure}} on demersal fish communities can be difficult to disentangle. The response of the demersal fish community to these factors was tested using long term data (1913 - 2006) collected by the Marine Biological Association (MBA) off Plymouth. Exploration of biomass by size class and size spectra analysis showed that the community was more responsive to climate change than fishing <b>effort.</b> <b>Abundant</b> small bodied fish responded to climate variation and not to fishing pressure, accounting for the response observed at the community level. Within the community large, slow growing fish showed a response to fishing pressure. These were hidden at the community level. The wider implications of the community response to climate change were explored using stomach content analysis. Temporal, intra and inter species variation in diet was observed. No change in diet was observed for fish in seperate length or gape size classes, and no specific ontogenetic change in diet was identified. Demersal fish responses to climate change off Plymouth are likely to affect all lower trophic levels equally.

30|$|Despite the <b>abundant</b> ongoing {{research}} <b>efforts,</b> cancer {{remains one}} of the most challenging diseases to treat globally. Due to the heterogenous nature of cancer, one of the major clinical challenges in therapeutic development is the cancer’s ability to develop resistance. It has been hypothesized that cancer stem cells are the cause for this resistance, and targeting them will lead to tumor regression. A pentaspan transmembrane glycoprotein, CD 133 has been suggested to mark cancer stem cells in various tumor types, however, the accuracy of CD 133 as a cancer stem cell biomarker has been highly controversial. There are numerous speculations for this, including differences in cell culture conditions, poor in vivo assays, and the inability of current antibodies to detect CD 133 variants and deglycosylated epitopes. This review summarizes the most recent and relevant research regarding the controversies surrounding CD 133 as a normal stem cell and cancer stem cell biomarker. Additionally, it aims to establish the overall clinical significance of CD 133 in cancer. Recent clinical studies have shown that high expression of CD 133 in tumors has been indicated as a prognostic marker of disease progression. As such, a spectrum of immunotherapeutic strategies have been developed to target these CD 133 pos cells with the goal of translation into the clinic. This review compiles the current therapeutic strategies targeting CD 133 and discusses their prognostic potential in various cancer subtypes.|$|R
40|$|Sustainability and {{the debate}} over climate change have become hot topics in the {{literature}} and news. Global reactions to the mounting scientific evidence have evolved rapidly in recent years, as an increased sense of urgency has emerged. On September 27, 2013, the IPCC announced {{that there is a}} 95 % probability that climate change has been caused by humans. This announcement, in conjunction with extreme weather events in recent years, has created even more urgency for policymakers to address climate change issues. Since the EU has been successful in decreasing its GHG emissions, its institutional factors, governance structure, and energy tax policies are examined. Institutional structures vary greatly between developed and developing countries, which may impact the “green-ness” of firms operating within those regions. Previous studies examine institutional factors in both developed and developing nations; however, the literature lacks sufficient {{research in the area of}} “green-specific” institutional factors. The “green-ness” of firms in developed versus developing countries is examined. The “greenness” of firms from EU-member nations are also compared to those based in both developed and developing countries. The Newsweek Green Index is tested for significance. Governance issues, specifically agency problems, are <b>abundant</b> in <b>efforts</b> to reduce global carbon emissions. Extensive research has been conducted related to firm-level governance; however, research is lacking in the area of agency issues inherent in global collaboration. Despite the EU’s multilateral governance structure, the EU was one of the few Kyoto members to reach its emissions reduction target for the period ended 2012; however, this could be offset by the inaction of developing countries. Since the EU “green” policies have focused on energy-related emissions, Eurostat’s emission data relative to developing countries (excluding deforestation) is tested. Tax policy is one of many methods which countries can use to reduce GHG emissions. Previous studies have focused on cap and trade as well as international tax competition; however, the literature lacks sufficient research on the effectiveness of the EU’s energy tax policies. This section examines the effectiveness of the 2003 EU Energy Taxation Directive in encouraging “green” activities. Eurostat’s “implicit tax rate on energy” is tested for significance.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} current discussions in the built environment, architectural practice, theory, and procedures is “Passive Design”. It is becoming very difficult to ignore the issues of passive architectural design strategies in buildings. Recent studies emphasized the need for passive architectural design strategies and the application of the courtyard as a passive design strategy for cooling in buildings. Also, that the courtyard is very suitable in almost all building typologies in all the climatic zones due to its passive tendencies for cooling. Its cooling potentials can be achieved only when design requirements are not ignored. The courtyard has social, cultural, religious, and environmental benefits. Despite its <b>abundant</b> advantages, research <b>effort</b> towards courtyard design requirements is very scarce. Therefore, the main objective {{of this study is to}} investigate the design of central courtyard as a passive cooling strategy for improving indoor thermal comfort in Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) Buildings. Courtyard design requirement such as the courtyard configurations, orientation, and natural features in courtyard buildings in UTM were investigated. Besides the design variants, courtyard usage in such buildings was also examined. The methodology of this study involved the developing of a checklist based on literature for the field survey. Forty-six (46) courtyards in thirty-two (32) buildings in UTM were surveyed, and the statistical description method was used to interpret and analyzed the data. The Results of this quantitative study shows that UTM central courtyards buildings were designed based on a cautious consideration to orientation and configurations to enhance their effective passive cooling potentials, however, only two courtyards had water pools.
