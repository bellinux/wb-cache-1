25|$|Khalil Gibran's The Prophet is a {{book that}} has touched many people very deeply since its {{publishing}} in 1923. It has been translated into more than twenty languages, and the American edition alone {{has sold more than}} four million copies. It is considered both by Gibran himself, and by the general public to be his literary masterpiece. The Prophet is about a man who is leaving a small town called Orphalese where he has made his home for the past twelve years. He has, for that time period, been waiting for a boat to take him back to the land of his youth. We are not told where that land is, only that he has been waiting to return there for twelve years. The entire book occurs on the date of his departure. As he is about to leave, the townsfolk stop him in the town and request that he tell them about certain things. He talks to them about life's lessons and imparts his wisdom to them. He is asked about giving, and he tells the people to give without recognition, because their reward is their own joy. He also talks about things like marriage, work, friendship and also love. He speaks about each, and more, describing the way that people should deal with each issue. This book is an interesting book. It is ninety-three pages of life's lessons set down in writing. These are words to live by, and tell others to live by. This book is certainly a book that everyone should read. Even if people don't agree with some of the beliefs, they should still read the book, if only to get their mind thinking about life, and its many quandaries from a different perspective. This book is not unlike the musings of an aging man imparting his life's lessons to an audience of just about anyone whom he can gather to listen to him. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Its lessons and stories are wise beyond the ages, and still hold up to be as true today as they were when Gibran wrote them in 1923. The lessons enumerated within this pages are lessons that one would hope were followed by the general population, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> if more people read this book, then {{the world as a whole}} might become a more easily survivable place.|$|E

500|$|The song {{opens with}} the main melody from the Hungarian piece [...] "Csárdás" [...] by Italian {{composer}} Vittorio Monti played on violin, as a distressed Gaga (speaking in a Spanish accent) states: [...] "I {{know that we are}} young, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> you may love me/But I just can't be with you like this anymore, Alejandro." [...] The track then changes to a stomping Europop beat. Gaga bids her ex-lovers farewell with a bitter-hearted pre-chorus where she sings: [...] "You know that I love you, boy/Hot like Mexico, rejoice!/At this point I've got to choose/Nothing to lose." [...] By the end of the song, the three protagonists – Alejandro, Fernando, and Roberto – are bidden farewell by Gaga.|$|E

500|$|Andrew Hampp {{felt that}} [...] "for an album [...] {{inspired}} by performance art, {{it was the}} one moment where music and shock value merged indelibly and credibly." [...] The performance also received criticism for the vomiting act. Recovered bulimic Demi Lovato complained that the show [...] "glamorized" [...] eating disorders. In response to the controversy, Brown told MTV News, [...] "I can understand why people would make that association, but my performance is really not a statement about eating disorders themselves." [...] Gaga confessed on Today, [...] "Millie <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> not everybody's going to love that performance, but we both really believe in artistic expression and strong identities, and I support her and what she does. Artpop, my new album, is about bringing art and music together in the spirit of creative rebellion, and for us, that performance was art in its purest form." ...|$|E
500|$|It {{is likely}} that the {{composition}} and style of John Everett Millais's controversial The Knight Errant was influenced by Musidora, but other than Millais, and Etty's admirer and imitator William Edward Frost, few other artists were directly influenced by Etty's work. In 1882 Vanity Fair commented on Musidora that [...] "I know only too well how the rough and his female companion behave in front of pictures such as Etty's bather. I have seen the gangs of workmen strolling round, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> their artistic interest in studies of the nude is emphatically embarrassing." [...] By the early 20th century Victorian styles of art and literature fell dramatically out of fashion in Britain, and by 1915 the word [...] "Victorian" [...] had become a derogatory term. Frederick Mentone's The Human Form in Art (1944) {{was one of the few}} 20th-century academic works to favourably view Musidora.|$|E
500|$|In a 24 August 2012 {{newsletter}} to fans {{about the}} upcoming release of [...] "Trouble," [...] {{it was announced that}} aspiring musicians and fans could produce their own remix for [...] "Trouble" [...] and win the chance to have their remix released along with the single. Lewis told fans, [...] "I can't wait for you guys to start remixing 'Trouble'. It is such an important song to me <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> you will put all your creative talents into it! I'm looking forward to hearing what you come up with and don't forget there are some great prizes to be won too!" [...] Lewis and Fraser T Smith (co-producer and co-writer of the song) were amongst the judges for the shortlisted songs. Matty Graham won the competition, and his remix of [...] "Trouble" [...] was released alongside the original version as part of a Digital EP available exclusively to MyPlayDirect.com, Lewis' official music store.|$|E

500|$|Shortly after Candaules was {{exhibited}} Etty, needled by repeated {{attacks from}} the press on his supposed tastelessness, indecency and lack of creativity, decided to produce an explicitly moral piece. The result was his 1832 The Destroying Angel and Daemons of Evil Interrupting the Orgies of the Vicious and Intemperate, which was {{seen by many as}} a renunciation of his earlier, more openly sensual works. Etty remained a prominent painter of nudes, but from 1832 onwards made conscious efforts to reflect moral lessons. Despite this he continued to be regarded as a pornographer by many, long after his death in 1849; as late as 1882 Vanity Fair was able to comment that [...] "I know only too well how the rough and his female companion behave in front of pictures such as Etty's bather. I have seen the gangs of workmen strolling round, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> their artistic interest in studies of the nude is emphatically embarrassing." ...|$|E
500|$|After Sonnen's {{win over}} Nate Marquardt in early 2010, Sonnen became a {{polarizing}} figure {{due to his}} criticism of Silva and overall trash talk (including comments directed towards Silva's manager, teammates, coaches, wife and home country of Brazil). Silva remained relatively quiet until a UFC 148 media call in June 2012, when he stated through an interpreter: [...] "Chael Sonnen's {{going to get his}} ass kicked like he's never gotten his ass kicked before. What I'm going to do inside the Octagon is something that's going to change the image of the sport. This is going to be violent and I am sorry. I'm {{going to make sure that}} every one of his teeth are broken, that his arms are broken and his legs are broken. He's not going to be able to walk out of the Octagon by himself. I can guarantee that. He will need a plastic surgeon afterwards. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> he’s listening, so the game’s over. No more shit talking. It’s on now." [...] This caught some by surprise, who perceived his remarks as out of character.|$|E
500|$|After leaving Connecticut on a Sunday {{morning in}} 2007 for Monday Night Football in Pittsburgh, Scott had a {{stomachache}}. After the stomachache worsened, {{he went to}} the hospital instead of the game and later had his appendix removed. After testing the appendix, doctors learned that he had cancer. Two days later, he had surgery in New York that removed part of his colon and some of his lymph nodes near the appendix. After the surgery, they recommended preventive chemotherapy. By December, Scott—while undergoing chemotherapy—hosted Friday night ESPN NBA coverage and led the coverage of ABC's NBA Christmas Day studio show. Scott worked out while undergoing chemotherapy. Scott said of his experience with cancer at the time: [...] "One of the coolest things about having cancer, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> sounds like an oxymoron, is meeting other people who've had to fight it. You have a bond. It's like a fraternity or sorority." [...] When Scott returned to work and people knew of his cancer diagnosis, the well-wishers felt overbearing for him as he just wanted to talk about sports, not cancer.|$|E

500|$|The album's {{characters}} {{include the}} [...] "Dogs", representing fervent capitalists, the [...] "Pigs", symbolising political corruption, and the [...] "Sheep", {{who represent the}} exploited. Croskery described the [...] "Sheep" [...] as being in a [...] "state of delusion created by a misleading cultural identity", a false consciousness. The [...] "Dog", in his tireless pursuit of self-interest and success, ends up depressed and alone {{with no one to}} trust, utterly lacking emotional satisfaction after a life of exploitation. Waters used Mary Whitehouse {{as an example of a}} [...] "Pig"; being someone who in his estimation, used the power of the government to impose her values on society. At the album's conclusion, Waters returns to empathy with the lyrical statement: [...] "You know that I care what happens to you. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> you care for me too." [...] However, he also acknowledges that the [...] "Pigs" [...] are a continuing threat and reveals that he is a [...] "Dog" [...] who requires shelter, suggesting the need for a balance between state, commerce and community, versus an ongoing battle between them.|$|E
500|$|Insane Clown Posse {{is known}} for their {{elaborate}} concert performances. In Marley Brant's Tales from the Rock 'n' Roll Highway, Bruce described a typical performance: [...] "We toss out, kick out, and shoot out into the crowd about three to four hundred two-liters of Faygo at every show...We bring with us monsters, dancing clowns, girls, trampolines, and pure and absolute madness to the stage...Shaggy <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> without all that crazy shit going on around us, we'd just be two more idiots walking back and forth, rapping on stage...ICP's motto has always been 'Fuck keepin' it real: we just keep it entertaining.'" [...] Performances feature backdrops including, among other settings, a game show set and a cemetery. Bruce stated, [...] "We always have a different set, not only for Hallowicked but every tour we go out on. We've been around so long that we get to dig up the many cool sets that we used {{back in the day}} and then get to use them again on a national level. Something we might've done once in '94 at St. Andrew's Hall, we can go back again and now do it nationwide-style".|$|E
500|$|According to David Prior, {{producer}} of the subsequent two-disc special edition, the initial bare bones edition [...] "was only reluctantly agreed to by Fincher because I needed {{more time on the}} bonus material. The studio was locked into their release date, so Fincher allowed that version to be released first. It {{had nothing to do with}} Fincher 'double dipping his own movie before it even makes it to stores' and everything to do with buying more time for the special edition". He stated that the theatrical cut would only be available on the single-disc edition. Prior elaborated further: [...] "Nobody wants fans feeling like they're being taken advantage of, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> double-dipping creates that impression. That's why it was so important to me that consumers be told there was another version coming. In this case it really was a rock-and-a-hard-place situation, and delaying the second release was done strictly for the benefit of the final product... But this is a very ambitious project, easily the most far-reaching I've ever worked on, and owing largely to studio snafus that I can't really elaborate on, I didn't have enough time to do it properly. Thus Fincher bought me the extra time by agreeing to a staggered release, which I'm very grateful for". [...] In its first week, rentals for the DVD earned $6.7 million.|$|E

500|$|The {{season finale}} {{received}} generally positive reviews from television critics. Entertainment Weekly columnist Abby West wrote that it [...] "was hands {{down one of}} the most satisfying hours of television I have ever had the pleasure of watching," [...] explaining that it created [...] "entirely new dynamics" [...] for the fourth season, hit [...] "all major beats," [...] and had [...] "real story progression" [...] and heart. Give Me My Remote writer Kath Skerry declared that the episode was [...] "brilliantly written, acted, and well paced. It was filled with twists and turns that I didn’t see coming. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> it sounds cliche, and I know saying it sounds cliche, sounds cliche. Maybe I’m being cliche but I don’t care. I am what I am – a full fledged Office addict who got exactly what she wanted, and in fact needed from the finale." [...] James Poniewozik of Time magazine voiced similar sentiments, believing the finale to be a [...] "good if not great season-ender, and if the conclusion didn't have the holy-crap factor of The Kiss last year, Pam’s closeup reaction to Jim’s return during her interview was–like everything Jenna Fischer does on this show–winning and sweet." [...] Poniewozik disliked how the season left Karen, calling it [...] "an uncharacteristic way to end this love triangle, which was distinguished by the writers’ refusal to make anyone the bad guy." ...|$|E
500|$|It's {{something}} that's {{very difficult}} for me. Because it is lines on paper when I {{do it in the}} comic book series. It's like, 'Oh, okay, Charlie Adlard [...] doesn’t have to draw that arrangement of lines anymore, that person is dead.' But it's very uncomfortable for me to be on set, because I see these actors that are there and, in the source material, I have killed all but two of them. I walk through the set and I'm like, 'Yep, killed that one, killed that one, killed that one.' And it is firing those people. I feel really bad for Emma Bell, just because she was great and I {{would have liked to have}} had her in the show. But, you know, this is The Walking Dead, characters have got to die. Thankfully, Emma was brought onto the show with the understanding that she was only going to be in a certain number of episodes and she knew that she was going to die from the very beginning. But it doesn’t really make it any easier. When they were shooting those scenes, I had to fly to Comic-Con and so I wasn’t actually there for when she died. But it was very emotional on set <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> she was very upset about having to leave the crew and the actors. You kind of become a family when you're doing a TV show and it’s a little upsetting to have to get rid of somebody.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} {{features}} an inspirational message of inner strength, and finds Carey {{reaching out to}} listeners. The song uses a rainstorm {{as a metaphor for}} troubles in life, while encouraging others to [...] "make it through the rain" [...] through perseverance. The first chorus begins: [...] "When you get caught in the rain / With no where to run / When your distraught and in pain without anyone / When you keep crying out to be saved", illustrating a moment in an individual's life where they are surrounded by conflict. The chorus then serves as a guide to those still suffering, [...] "I can make it through the rain, I can stand up once again on my own / <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> I'm strong enough to mend / And every time I feel afraid I hold tighter to my faith / And I live one more day and I make it through the rain". Similarly, the second verse once again revisits difficult times when [...] "shadows grow close", before continuing into the second chorus and climax. While the song in meant for listeners to gain confidence and strength, it also allows them into Carey's personal struggles she endured throughout 2001. Lola Ogunnaike of The New York Times described the song as a [...] "triumph over adversity", while a writer from the Sydney Morning Herald wrote [...] "it's an insight into her recent troubles." [...] In an interview with MTV News, Carey described the song's lyrical content in depth: ...|$|E
